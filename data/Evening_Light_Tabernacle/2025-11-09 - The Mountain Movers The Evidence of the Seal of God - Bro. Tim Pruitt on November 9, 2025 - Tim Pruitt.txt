[singing] [music] [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; No one knew [singing] how alone I was feeling. And the [music] emptiness [singing] I tried so hard to hide. Though I [singing] laughed and [music] said my life was fine without you. I was covering [singing and music] up the secret tears I cried. But then one [singing and music] day someone told me of your mercy &gt;&gt; and the love [singing and music] you showed on a hill called Calary. There you purchase [singing and music] my redemption.

No one else has ever cared for me &gt;&gt; like you, Lord. Other friends can [music] never [singing] be as close to me. I'm [music] not afraid to face problems of tomorrow.

I believe that's where we want to be hidden is in the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Under the shed blood of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you haven't been here in a while, we want you to feel very welcome. If you've been here regularly, well, we sure want you to feel welcome, too. Amen. [music] It's just good to gather in the presence of the Lord &gt;&gt; and to have this moment today to worship him, to praise him, [music] to give him glory, to give him honor. He's our Lord, our Savior. Amen. Our soon coming King. Amen. God bless you. So good to have you with [music] us today. I look around and and uh think of as [music] we have filled the baptistry pool, we got Sister Hannah Middleton wants to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I'm so thankful to see her heart turned to God. And I believe he's going to do great things in her life. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, there's nothing like serving Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; And we want to serve him with all our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Today I I want to just take a special moment here and um wish a a dear lady, a special lady, a mother in Israel a happy birthday. She's turning [music] 94 this week, Sister Helen Williams. She's a a faithful daughter of God for many, many years now. And I think all how we loved her, her husband, Brother Earl, her son, Brother Daniel Williams, one of my best friends [music] of my life. And of course, uh, the mother, she's also the mother to our dear sister, Rachel Shaw. And we just want to wish her a happy birthday today. [music] Amen. Why don't you give her a hand of applause today? [applause] Amen. God bless you. Amen. You are loved in the Lord. [applause] I tell you what, why don't we sing that birthday song?

Well, if you turn to 94, maybe I can sing it if I have breath left. Amen. Ain't God good to us? Gives us so many blessings. I want to sing that one, too. Ain't God good to give us so many blessings? &gt;&gt; You're a blessing this morning. It's a blessing to be together. Amen. Well, ain't God good to give us so many [music] blessings undeserving. That's what we are. We ought to thank him, love and praise him more today and a whole lot more [music] tomorrow. Well, ain't God to give us so many blessings and [music] that's what they are. We are thanking for love and praise [music] him for today and a whole lot more. [singing] [music] Amen. Let's just talk to the Lord now. Maybe you got a request on your heart today and you just like to bring it before the Lord and ask his grace upon your life on the need that you have. Father, as we bow before you today, we just want [music] to express our thanksgiving to you for all the good things, the great things that [music] you've done. Lord, as the song says about Jesus, he ain't never done me nothing but good. &gt;&gt; Certainly, Lord, we can say that today. Your blessings have been upon our lives. Your mercies have endured. I pray Lord a special blessings upon your children today as we have come and we we [music] need you today to anoint our ears to hear to anoint our hearts to receive to anoint this mouth to speak oh God as an oracle of God. Oh father that we could hear what the spirit [music] has to say to the church. I pray Lord you'll bless your children that have assembled Lord. There have got needs in their lives. Lord, there's desires in their hearts. Oh God, there's longings in their soul. And I pray that you'll meet every need today. And anoint us now as we read your word. [music] We know nothing to do but do that, Lord. Because if we're really going to say anything, it's got to come from the Bible, the word of God. It's the infallible word. Every other man's word will fail, but your word never fails. Bless us, I pray, together in your presence in Jesus' [music] name. Amen. If you'll turn with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 21. I have several scripture readings I want to read. Um, a couple of more from the book of Ephesians. So, 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 21. Now he which established us with you in Christ hath anointed us is God who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts. Notice something here in this scripture because it's going to be important as we go along that he hath anointed us and that one that has anointed us is God. But he has also sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts. Now, if you'll turn with me to Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 30, we're going to read from there as well. Ephesians 4:30, and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption. And in Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ, who in whom all ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. Amen. God bless you. Can be seated. you know, um today really we're living in a very uh treacherous time &gt;&gt; uh because um of the the con condition of the world in which we live and u the situations that are around us &gt;&gt; and even in Christianom there is it's a dangerous time because there's too many that are content to just live in a shallow Christianity that is satisfied with emotion or with form or or doctrine without truly knowing him. &gt;&gt; But the call of the spirit in this hour is to lead God's people into a deeper life into a hidden fellowship of Christ where your roots go down real deep and and where fruit then comes forth out of your life. Paul would say, "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God." And again, he said that I might know him in the power of his resurrection. And that's what we're after today is not a surface religion, but some a life that is flowing from the depths of his presence to to be sealed to the day of redemption. Now, Paul was describing in the divine process of salvation that gives us an inheritance in three stages. And this is what we're going to speak on today is is the evidence of the seal of God &gt;&gt; because we we have been speaking about the Holy Spirit and its works and his life. And even last week we spoke on the strongholds there that we are to cast down. How that every believer, every Christian, ever born again, sealed of God believer has battles within the mind. And we get to battles with the flesh &gt;&gt; because neither one of them are redeemed. &gt;&gt; It is the soul that has been redeemed and and has started a fight within us. &gt;&gt; And of course um it's the battleground where that we we fight against not flesh and blood but against powers and and principalities and spiritual wickedness um in in in high places. So you see um in this scripture that we have just read from Ephesians chapter 1, Paul is describing the divine process of salvation that gives us an inheritance in three stages. And and one is hearing the word of truth. Um I actually if you'll just put back up for me verse 13 of chapter 1 there and and um you can follow me down through verse 14 if you will. But anyway, you again, you know, here here it is. It's described if you see you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation in whom that you believed. So here's believe in the gospel, hearing the word of truth, and then you're sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise. &gt;&gt; Now the the spirit is called the earnest. It means the down payment or the guarantee. It is the pledge that what God began in you, he will complete. &gt;&gt; And and this is what he says in Philippians 1 and6. He said, "Being confident of this," and this is where your confidence has got to rest this morning. If you're just starting out, if you're if you're sealed to the day of redemption, doesn't matter what the level that you're in, that you must be confident of this, that he that began a good work in you will perform it or carried it on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ. So you see, Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit as the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession. Now when Paul says the purchased possession, he's referring to the believer themselves. And and so by extension, the entire creation that Christ redeemed through his blood. So he as he said in the book of Corinthians, HE SAID, "YOU'RE NOT your own. You have been bought with a price." &gt;&gt; And then he he says in Acts chapter 20, he says to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood. So you have been purchased with his own blood. You have been bought with a price with a price. You are not your own because through the cross Christ legally purchased us. Redemption is both a a transaction the price paid by blood and a transformation the life restored by the spirit. So thus the purchased possession refers to the bloodbought believer who has been paid for in full but YET NOT FULLY REDEEMED in manifestation because our mortal bodies have not been changed. And and while the soul has been redeemed, the body awaits redemption. And that's what Paul calls the redemption of our body. AND HE SAYS ALL CREATION the groans and travails in pain together until even now. And he said not only they but ourselves also WHICH HAVE THE FIRST FRUITS of the spirit. Even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption that is the redemption of our body. And that is true. We grown. We struggle. We are here in a life of struggle. And we're longing for that day when we will be fully redeemed. Now, this fully redemption though will take place at the change of our bodies at the resurrection or the rapture when we are glorified. And as as Philippians says, WHO SHALL CHANGE OUR BOUND BODY that we might be fashioned into his own glorious body. So we have already been redeemed &gt;&gt; because we are been bought with a price. when we are sealed with the Holy Spirit as a earnest are of our inheritance, but we're waiting for the full redemption, the complete deliverance of this mortal frame into immortality. And the Holy Ghost is the seal and the earnest. It is and that is the first installment of glory. IT IS GOD SAYING, "THIS one belongs to me and I will finish what I started." So, so the seal of course means ownership. So, if I can just kind of get your thoughts together with me for a moment, I want you to get it. The first thing that seal signifies is ownership. Uh, you see 2 Timothy 2:19 says, "Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his, and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity." &gt;&gt; Right? So you see, the Lord knows who is his. So he has claimed you by his own blood. He paid for you. You are his. You are NOT A CHILD OF THE DEVIL. You belong to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, you never was originally a child of the devil. You belong to God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; But because of sin, you were lost in sin and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But now God rich in mercy hath redeemed you by his blood paid the purchase price. And he's not through working on you. &gt;&gt; He will perform it to the day of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we are people that are are living in imperfection while we are striving for that day where perfection will come. &gt;&gt; AND SO WE DON'T EXPECT OUR LIVES TO BE PERFECT HERE. WE EXPECT OUR LIVES to be progressing here. &gt;&gt; Now now and of course then another thing is security. The Bible says in Ephesians 4:30, "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption." And so the seal marks you as God's property. It's God's mark of approval on your life. It is heaven's identification stamp on your soul. And without that seal, the claim of redemption cannot be completed because the seal is what binds your mortal to the immortal, the human to the divine. BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS US IN the breach between the church ages and the seals, he said another thing a seal signifies is ownership. The seal has a mark on it. Shows ownership. WHEN YOU ARE BOUGHT BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost, you are no longer belong to the world or anything pertain to the world. You are owned by God. Another thing, a seal is security. It means you're secure. And now you you that don't believe in eternal security, I don't know. But a seal signifies security to his destination. And woe to that guy that would try to break that seal. And the Holy Spirit's seal cannot be broken. You've heard me pe me me say that people said the devil made me do this. No. No. The devil didn't do it. You just wasn't sealed in. So then because you when you're sealed in, he's sealed out. Now you went out to him. He couldn't get out to you because the only way he could get into you is to come through the same process that you have. He'd have to be saved, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost, and then he'd be your brother. So he did, he didn't do it. No. No. You just went out to the borderline. You went to the borderline and come back lusting for the things of the world. You never went all all the way over into Canaan. You see, across Jordan to death to self. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS US THESE THINGS, you know, that it's a security. It it signifies ownership in the FUTURE HOME. BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT temptation and he says Satan can tempt BUT HE CANNOT GET a born again Christian. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; For God from the FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD FORSAW HIM, sent Jesus to redeem him and the blood speaks for him. So how can he sin when it can't be seen even by God? And and of course, Satan can tempt and it can bring wrong thoughts into the mind, but he cannot cancel the security of the soul. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE ENEMY'S ATTEMPT to keep you from walking in victory because if he can't possess you, then he will oppress you. &gt;&gt; And and so again, as we're looking at this, that's that a seal is an identity. identity. The Bible said in Romans 8:16, the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. &gt;&gt; So he as he said, you're not your own. YOU'VE BEEN BOUGHT WITH the price, his own blood. So again, we're looking at this and we are sealed until the redemption of the purchased possession. Now, that's the scripture we want to be looking at. You know, the the redemption of the purchased POSSESSION IS THE FINAL ACT OF GOD'S great drama of grace. CHRIST BOUGHT US at Calvary. THE HOLY SPIRIT SEALED US AT PENTECOST. And soon at the coming of the Lord, he will redeem the body that he has purchased, transform it into his glorious likeness. And the spirit in you is not the full inheritance yet. It's the earnest. IT'S THE DOWN PAYMENT. IT SAYS THERE'S MORE TO COME. &gt;&gt; AND I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU, you know, how great it is to know this morning that there's more to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that even though we receive the Holy Spirit of promise, it is promises there's something greater coming. &gt;&gt; And that greater coming will be when when you your not only your soul will be saved, but your spirit will be delivered and your body will be changed. So you see, I want YOU TO HOLD FAST THIS MORNING AND KNOW that you are already his property. YOU ARE SEALED WITH THE SPIRIT AND YOU'RE WAITING FOR THAT DAY WHEN THE TRUMPET SOUNDS and the purchased possession. Your whole being and your spirit, SOUL, AND BODY will be redeemed and glorified to the praise and glory of God. So you see, as we're looking at this though, I I want you to understand, it's vitally important though to receive this down payment, this first installment of of the God's plan OF REDEMPTION. AND THAT is the earnest of your inheritance, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And and it's not optional. IT IS ESSENTIAL. IT IS absolutely necessary. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT'S THE TOKEN THAT YOU BELONG to God. IT. IT'S THE POWER THAT WILL CHANGE HIS MORTAL BODY. IT'S THE FIRE THAT KEEPS YOUR LAMP BURNING until the bridegroom comes. &gt;&gt; SO WITHOUT THE EARNEST, YOUR CANDLE'S UNLIT. THE BODY'S UNPREPARED AND THE SOUL IS UNSEALED. BUT with the earnest, oh glory to God, you are marked. You are empowered. You are destined for transformation. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR THE BIBLE SAID THIS CORRUPTION, DISCORPTABLE, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE IN. CORRUPTIBLE BODIES MUST PUT ON INCORRUPTION AND THIS MORTAL MUST PUT ON immortality and and it IS THE SPIRIT THAT IS within that will perform IT BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE CHANGE BEGINS from the inside out. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not the other way. It ain't one day you get your body changed and then your soul will be saved. NO, YOUR SOUL IS SAVED AND THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're changed from the inside out. Now, I want to take a scripture that is very pertinent to the last days. And this is found in Revelation 7, and we're going to look at verse one through verse three. Now, as I'm saying this, as you know, the book of Revelation is the book of symbols. &gt;&gt; And so, it's a vision that God showed John, caught him up into this vision, showed him different events, and he shows him of this end time event. And he says, "After these things, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth." Now, uh I I don't care how much you flatearthers think this don't make the earth flat. This is referring to the four directions of the earth for the north, south, east, and west. And and he's holding the four winds of the earth. Now, BROTHER BRANDHAM EXPLAINS THIS SYMBOLOGY, and he says winds are wars of strife. and and there is and he said that the earth the wind should not blow on the earth nor the sea nor any tree. So is something that is holding back they're holding back the the the wars of the earth. Actually, he'll take it even to the first world war and he'll talk about at the 11th day on of the on the 11th month, the 11th day and and and um you know at the 11th hour how that the the first world war was stopped before poisonous gas went all over the earth and and just mass destruction. God held it back and he said, "No, I you you can't destroy the earth yet. &gt;&gt; I've got to get a I got to get Israel back in her homeland. I I've got to get a bride in her place. &gt;&gt; You know, YOU CAN'T DESTROY THE EARTH. AND OF COURSE, WE'VE HAD OTHER WARS OF STRIFE, BUT IT'S HOLDING BACK. WHY HASN'T THERE COME THE BURNING OF THE EARTH YET? BECAUSE GOD'S been holding it back. &gt;&gt; So, you see there again, it was it was there. I SAW THIS ANOTHER ANGEL. NOW, we we see another angel coming from the east having the seal of the living God. And he cries with a loud voice to the four angels which to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea. Next verse saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. Now, I want you to notice this real carefully because this is a critical part of end time events. And that IS SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING IN THE supernatural realm that is keeping the earth from being destroyed. THAT BEFORE THAT the winds of destruction are loose. BEFORE THE JUDGMENT FIRES SWEEP ACROSS THE EARTH, GOD COMMANDS THESE angels of WRATH TO HOLD BACK THE FOUR WINDS. WOW. BECAUSE there is a work of sealing yet to be done. &gt;&gt; And and THERE IS AN ANGELIC ANOINTING THAT MUST COME FIRST. &gt;&gt; I want you to see this. THIS IS SHOWING YOU. Give me the the verse before verse verse. Yeah. And I SAW ANOTHER ANGEL HAVING THE SEAL of the living God. NOTICE THIS IS AN ANGELIC ANOINTING &gt;&gt; THAT is coming now from the east. &gt;&gt; And he has the seal of the living God because the you see THERE'S A WORK OF SEALING that has to be done. UH AN ANGELIC ANOINTING COME FIRST, AN OUTPOURING OF THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD upon his elect. &gt;&gt; NOW NOTICE THIS MIGHTY ANGEL. He ascends from the east. THE GOSPEL FIRST CAME OUT OF THE EAST AT Pentecost &gt;&gt; when THE HOLY GHOST FELL IN THE UPPER ROOM. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; IT SEALED THE CHURCH WITH DIVINE FIRE. AND THAT SAME SPIRIT WHICH BEGAN IN JERUSALEM NOW RETURNS IN THE LAST DAY. NOTICE I I I want you to get this. The token comes in the evening time. THIS IS THE DAY OF THE FULLNESS of the Holy Ghost. THIS IS A TIME WHERE THE ANGEL COMES FROM the east. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WITH THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD. BRINGING THE SEAL BACK &gt;&gt; THAT HAD BEEN LOST DOWN THROUGH THE AGES. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A DIVINE INJUNCTION BEFORE DESTRUCTION COMES. HERE HE COMES TO POUR OUT THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD. NOW I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE GOSPEL FIRST CAME OUT OF THE EAST and when THE CHURCH WAS BORN ON the day OF PENTECOST AND IT SEALED THAT EARLY CHURCH WITH THE DIVINE FIRE OF GOD AND THAT SAME SPIRIT WHICH BEGAN AT JERUSALEM NOW RETURNS IN THE LAST DAY ASCENDING AGAIN TO FINISH THE WORK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO SEAL THE FINAL SERVANTS OF GOD BEFORE THE world's last shaking. Now let me tell you this is the token. &gt;&gt; This is the evening message to apply the token. You see in other times in other stages there was more than just applying the blood in that in that um the call of of out of Egypt to the promised land. And they had to leave out of Egypt under the token under the blood. &gt;&gt; And remember there were they had to take up the lamb. They had to examine the lamb. They had to keep him so many days. Right? He had to be judged and made sure that he was spotless lamb. &gt;&gt; All of this was part of the process. Then the lamb was then the the blood of the lamb, the final acts of the blood of the lamb applied. &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S BEEN OTHER ACTS OF THE WORK OF THE LAMB THROUGH the church ages where that where they they accepted the lamb. They judged him without blemish that HE WAS KEPT UP AND EXAMINED. AND SO THERE'S A TIME OF EXAMINING THE LAMB AND SAYING, "YEAH, YOU KNOW, HERE'S HIS WORKS. This is WHAT HE DOES." BUT IN THE LAST DAYS, IN THE EVENING time is the TIME WHERE THE TOKEN HAS TO BE APPLIED. &gt;&gt; THE LIFE OF THE BLOOD MUST COME BACK ON THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE SEAL, THE MARKING OF GOD. &gt;&gt; NOW, SO AS YOU look at this, THIS IS THE TOKEN. THIS IS THE evening message. IT IS TO APPLY THE BLOOD, THE LIFE of Christ. Now, if you would look at verse four, I I want you to see this. And he said, "I heard the number of them which were sealed and it was sealed was 144,000." Now, we we know this is the Jews. We know this is to Israel. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Tim, how are you applying this to the bride? How in the world can you apply this? Because you got to understand that this ceiling in Revelation 7 is directed to the predestinated remnant of Israel, the 144,000, the fornown of God that's chosen to receive the mark of the spirit after THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS TAKEN THEIR sealed during the tribulation for protection while the judgment falls. BUT IN THE BROADER SCOPE OF THE SCRIPTURE, every believer in this age, I want you to get this. Every believer in this age is sealed by the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:30, which we read, GRIEVE NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD, WHEREBY YOU ARE sealed &gt;&gt; to the day of redemption. SO EVEN AS GOD TURNS TO SEAL THE NATURAL SEED OF ABRAHAM, HE REVEALS THE COMPLETION OF the redemption of the royal seed of Abraham. I want you to GET IT'S NOT JUST A NATURAL seed that is getting sealed. BUT IT'S ALSO THE ROYAL seed that is GETTING SEALED BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE IS THE GENTILES, THE GENTILE BRIDE IS THE SPIRITUAL ISRAEL. THE THE THE JEWS ARE THE PHYSICAL ISRAEL. SO, you know, IF YOU SEE THEM IN THEIR HOMELAND, YOU SEE THE BRIDE COME IN THEIR HOMELAND. IF YOU SEE HER EXPELLED FROM THE NATIONS, UH THEN YOU SEE THE BRIDE EXPELLED FROM THE DENOMINATION. IF YOU SEE THE ATTACK COMING ON THEM IN A IN A PHYSICAL MANNER DRIVING THEM TO THE HOMELAND, YOU SEE THE ATTACK COMING against the bride in an ecclesiastical manner. You see, you see whatever is working in one is working in another. So if you see the Holy SPIRIT COMING AND ASCENDING FROM THE EAST &gt;&gt; COMING THERE for where IT FIRST STARTED AND THE GOSPEL GOING NOW BACK TO THE JEWS AND THEN BEING SEALED, YOU KNOW, THEN THE GENTILES, &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE &gt;&gt; IS THE ONE IT'S REALLY SENT FOR &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS TO BE SEALED TO THE DAY OF REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So, as we look at this, the bride of Christ is sealed by the Holy Ghost before the rapture &gt;&gt; and the 144,000 Jews are sealed during the tribulation. And both carry the same principle. God is marking his own with his spirit for perseveration and for redemption. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THUS THE GENTILE AND the Jewish dispensations both close under the same divine operation, &gt;&gt; THE COMING OF THE SEAL OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE HOLY GHOST HIMSELF, NOT NOT NOT A FEELING, NOT A JUMP, NOT A SHOUT, NOT AN EMOTION, BUT HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AND THIS OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY GHOST IDENTIFIES HIS OWN. AND IT happens in order to finish redemption. finish the redemption for both peoples, &gt;&gt; the natural Israel and spiritual Israel. Now, so here again IS SCREAMING OUT, "HOLD BACK THE JUDGMENT UNTIL MY SERVANTS ARE SEALED with the Holy Ghost." Of course, the Jews are his servants, the Gentiles are his children, but both are sealed in this final act of redemption. &gt;&gt; AND WHERE DOES THE SEAL GO? BACK UP ONE VERSE. and and he said TILL WE HAVE SEALED THE SERVANTS OF GOD where in their foreheads now this is not a visible mark but it's the mind of Christ &gt;&gt; the spirit's forehead of understanding as as Philippians 2:5 says let this mind &gt;&gt; be in YOU &gt;&gt; THAT WAS ALSO IN CHRIST Jesus &gt;&gt; now this The true evidence of the Holy Ghost is not emotion or sensation, but revelation. IT'S THE MIND AND FAITH OF CHRIST BIRTHED INTO THE BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; AND IT CAUSES THE BRIDE TO BELIEVE THE word for her day TO THINK AS CHRIST THINKS, TO SEE AS CHRIST SEES, AND TO WALK IN FULL AGREEMENT with his revealed truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's what you're wanting to see in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the Apostle Paul believed that the spirit they had received had given them the mind of Christ. Look at 1 Corinthians 2:16. For who had known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. So he definitely believed that the Holy Spirit that they had received had given them the mind, the thinking of Christ. &gt;&gt; And I want YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHAT THIS message is about. &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT REVEALING THE MIND OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IN GOD'S THINKING. THAT'S WHY WHEN HE REVEALS HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT YOU, HE TAKES YOU NOT AS YOU ARE NOW, &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT YOU WERE IN HIM &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. &gt;&gt; What is he doing? He's revealing his mind concerning you. &gt;&gt; THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW CHRIST'S MIND, CHRIST THOUGHTS OF YOU, THAT YOU WERE IDENTIFIED WITH HIM BEFORE YOU EVER SINNED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You were his. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you were unlovable, HE DIED for you. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU WERE UNGODLY, HE REDEEMED YOU. &gt;&gt; AND HE DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU WERE GOOD. HE DID IT WHEN YOU WERE BAD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU WERE HOLY, BUT HE DID IT TO MAKE YOU HOLY. &gt;&gt; He didn't do it BECAUSE YOU WERE BLAMELESS, BUT TO MAKE YOU BLAMELESS. &gt;&gt; Unreprovable in his sight. Now, I don't care what the devil says as long as it I'm in his sight. &gt;&gt; Too many of you say, "Well, the devil said to me, well, what did Jesus say?" &gt;&gt; So, which word carries more weight? &gt;&gt; What are what are you repeating even what the devil said? &gt;&gt; Why are you even entertaining what he said? &gt;&gt; Throw it out. &gt;&gt; Cast it down. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, this is a true mark. The inward seal that distinguishes the redeemed from the deceived as the mark of the beast, you know, identifies those conformed to the world system. THE SEAL OF GOD IDENTIFIES THOSE WHO ARE TRANSFORMED by the word. SO BEFORE THE WINDS of war blow, BEFORE THE FINAL JUDGMENTS COME, you know, GOD SENDS FORTH HIS SPIRIT ONE MORE TIME, ASCENDING FROM THE EAST with the seal of the living God. And he's marking his own, BOTH THE BRIDE and the Gentiles, dispensation, both of them, the remnant of Israel, BOTH OF THEM. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER BRIDE OR OR THE REMNANT OF ISRAEL. THEY ARE BOTH SEALED WITH THE SAME HOLY SPIRIT THAT FELL AT PENTECOST. THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD &gt;&gt; AND THE SAME LIFE THAT WILL CHANGE OUR MORTAL BODIES WITH THE TRUMPET SOUNDS. &gt;&gt; SO THE CEILING COMES FIRST, THEN THE STORM, AND THE BRIDE IS SEALED AND and raptured, then the judgment fall. The mark in THE FOREHEAD IS THE WORD MADE FLESH IN THE BELIEVER AND CHRIST REVEALED IN HIS OWN BODY. SO HE SAYS, "HURT NOT THE EARTH TILL WE HAVE SEALED HIS SERVANTS OF OUR GOD IN THEIR FOREHEAD." SO BEFORE THE DESTRUCTION, THERE'S REDEMPTION'S FINAL ACT. AND I WANT YOU TO GET IT. WE ARE IN REDEMPTION'S FINAL ACT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS HE CALLS OUT A PEOPLE FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND AND THAT IS THE SEALING OF THE SPIRIT. THAT'S WHAT HE'S GOING FORTH TO do as he send the sealing angels as IN EZEKIEL CHAPTER 9. And he sends THE SEALING ANGELS TO MARK THOSE WHO SIGH AND CRY FOR THE abominations &gt;&gt; that sin makes them sick. &gt;&gt; Now, so before the destruction, here comes the seal where in the forehead. And it's not a physical mark. It represents spiritual identification. It represents ownership. AND IN THE BIBLE, THE FOREHEAD SYMBOLIZES THE MIND, the seed of belief, conviction, allegiance, and and and Paul said, "Don't be don't be conformed TO THE WORLD, BUT BE TRANSFORMED BY THE RENEWING of your mind." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this sealed IN IS THE SPIRIT OF GOD MARKING THOSE who belong to him. Do you belong to him this morning? &gt;&gt; Well, then there's a mark upon your life. IT'S AN INVISIBLE BUT REAL identification in the realm of the of the of the soul. &gt;&gt; NOW, BEFORE THE JUDGMENT STRIKES, God commands his angels. I'm so glad he does. When we hear wars and rumors of wars, when we hear threats of nuclear destruction, when we hear of the trouble coming on this earth, &gt;&gt; when we hear of the strife and the troubles, are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Here, before it can even happen, God says, "Wait a minute. Don't allow them to hurt the earth. &gt;&gt; Don't let them Don't let them destroy it until we have sealed the servants of the living God." &gt;&gt; Amen. And this OF COURSE IS THE PATTERN THAT IS SHOWN IN THE TYPES OF THE SCRIPTURE LIKE EZEKIEL 9 AND 4-6. HE SAID GOD TOLD THE THE ANGELS TO SET A MARK ON THE FOREHEADS OF THE MEN WHO SIGH AND CRY FOR THE ABOMINATIONS. &gt;&gt; THOSE WITHOUT THE MARK, THEY WERE ALL DESTROYED. And the SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES RIGHT HERE IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION. BEFORE THE WINDS OF JUDGMENT BLOW, GOD MARKS HIS OWN FOR DIVINE PROTECTION, &gt;&gt; PRESERVING HIS OWN, SEALING THEM TO THE DAY OF REDEMPTION. AND THAT SEAL SAYS, "THESE ARE MINE. &gt;&gt; TOUCH THEM NOT." &gt;&gt; JUDGMENT WILL NEVER STRIKE A CHILD OF GOD SEALED BY THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; You have passed from death into life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see again, the Lord knows them that are his &gt;&gt; and he PUTS A MARK ON THEM &gt;&gt; AND IT'S CALLED A SEAL. AND so you when we look in the the book of Revelation, YOU SEE ANOTHER MARK AND WE CALL THAT THE MARK OF THE BEAST AS it said and and it's to be in the right hand or the forehead. And the forehead IS THE BELIEF, THE DOCTRINE, THE MINDSET. AND AND THE BIBLE SAID THAT THESE HAVE ONE mind and give their power and strength unto the beast. And you can see those WHO ARE MARKED BY SATAN BECAUSE THEY give their mind AND THEIR POWER TO THE BEAST. &gt;&gt; And that's the way that you lived &gt;&gt; IN THE FLESH &gt;&gt; BEFORE CHRIST PUT A MARK ON YOU. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, you you live, YOU HAD YOU HAD A MIND and you gave WITH THAT WITH THAT MINDSET, YOU GAVE YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR POWER TO THIS BEAST, &gt;&gt; the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so will they in the tribulation. &gt;&gt; Now, the hand of course is deeds and actions and works. And God's seal and the forehead simply means the mind of Christ that governs the believer. and and they have received the word revelation sealed by the Holy Ghost. AND AND SATAN'S MARKED BY CONTRAST. It marks those whose thinking and ACTIONS ARE CONTROLLED BY THE ANTICHRIST SPIRIT. AND AND LISTEN, you're you're following one another, one or the other. YOUR MIND IS EITHER SET ON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS DEATH, OR YOUR MIND IS SET ON CHRIST. AND IF YOU'VE BEEN REDEEMED, HE HAS SET YOUR AFFECTIONS ON THINGS THAT are above. That's where your desires are. &gt;&gt; It turned them all heavenly. &gt;&gt; Now, so as you notice, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF TYPES IN THE BIBLE. WE WON'T go through them all, but just briefly touch them just for a minute. The blood on the doorpost in Egypt. And what was it? It was protection FROM JUDGMENT. WHEN I see the blood, I will pass over you. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE FREE PASS OUT OF Egypt &gt;&gt; into Canaan. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. That's what we need. You know, the token, THE FREE PASS OUT OF THIS WORLD OF EGYPT into glory. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, THE MARK ON THE FOREHEADS IN EZEKIEL 9 is was persuasion during uh the destruction OF JERUSALEM. SET A MARK ON THOSE WHO SIGH AND CRY FOR THE ABOMINATION THAT ARE DONE IN THE CITY. AND AND THE SEALING ANGEL WENT FORTH AND FINDING THOSE &gt;&gt; THAT SIN made them sick. &gt;&gt; And that's an identification of a real Christian. Sin literally makes you sick. Now, of course, the seal in Revelation chapter 7 that we just read of the 144,000 during the tribulation um judgments and the same pattern, it runs through all dispensations. As I said before, the judgment fall, God marks his redeemed. &gt;&gt; And in this Friday, THE SEAL OF GOD IS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. THAT IS GOD'S OWN LIFE. IT'S THE LIVING TOKEN THAT IDENTIFIES THE BELIEVER as God's possession. &gt;&gt; I want you to know if you've got the Holy Ghost, that's God saying, "You're mine. &gt;&gt; You belong to me. &gt;&gt; I'm your God. You're my people." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you see again as the scripture said in John for him whom the him hath God the father sealed. So the seal the seal in the forehead signifies the believer's mind HAS BEEN RENEWED BY THE WORD. THEIR LIFE IS FILLED BY THE SPIRIT. THEIR HEART IS UNDER DIVINE OWNERSHIP. And before THE WRATH IS POURED OUT, HE SEALS US SO THAT WHEN THE JUDGMENT STRIKES, WE'RE UNTOUCHED. WE'RE HIDDEN under the his covenant blood and by and in his by his indwelling spirit. I want you I want you to get the scripture. You know, brother Bradam preached the rapture from Psalms 27 verse 5 well through 1-5. But let's just look at verse five. For in the time of trouble, in the time of trouble. &gt;&gt; And friends, friends, we're looking at the time of trouble. &gt;&gt; Pre-tribulation strife is already striking the world. &gt;&gt; The winds are blowing. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's something holding them back until that last one's sealed in. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? BUT IN THAT TIME, WHAT he will do? HE WILL HIDE me in his pavilion. &gt;&gt; In the secret OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE ME. HE SHALL SET ME UPON A ROCK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So you see THIS IS WHAT HE DOES. He th this is referring to the holiest of holies. HE WILL HIDE YOU in his presence. THIS IS WHERE GOD'S GOT THE BELIEVER HIDDEN. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE DEAD AND YOUR LIFE IS HIDDEN IN GOD THROUGH CHRIST SEALED BY the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So the forehead represents revelation. A mind illuminated and and it's illuminated by truth and a seal represents that spirit's indwelling power AND PROTECTION. SO, WHILE THE WORLD is marked and bearing the mark of the beast, there's another people ON EARTH &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE ALSO MARKED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT THEY BEAR THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD, THE HOLY GHOST, UNTO THE DAY OF REDEMPTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now look, we hear a lot about the image of the beast, the systems of man that are rising, the powers of deception that are forming all over the earth. &gt;&gt; Just got an article today, you know, where the the pope is is moved with ecumenical things, bringing all of the all the Protestants together. So the spirit of ecomunism isn't dead. They're they're working steadily. the cog the clogs the cogs of God's wheels of prophecies grind slow but sure &gt;&gt; and and so you there are the powers of deception that are forming on the earth and that image is coming near and you can see it you can see it people are modeling it they're actually living &gt;&gt; the image of the beast &gt;&gt; you you know there you can see it in their dress you can see it in their music. You can see it in their spirit and you can see it in the moral collapse &gt;&gt; all around us. &gt;&gt; The image of the beast is being made flesh. &gt;&gt; But if the image of the beast is coming to maturity, then the IMAGE OF CHRIST IS ALSO COMING NEAR. &gt;&gt; For the Bible said when the enemy comes in like a flood, then the spear OF THE LORD LIFTS UP A STANDARD AGAINST IT. SO YOU see before the image of the beast is enthroned THE IMAGE OF CHRIST WILL ALREADY BE WALKING UPON THE EARTH IN his bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Brandham SAID IN THESE LAST DAYS the true bride comes the headstone becoming the super church the super race as she nears that head that capstone revelation. THEY WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM &gt;&gt; THAT THEY WILL BE IN HIS VERY IMAGE, united with him as one, THE LIVING BREATHING MANIFESTATION of the word of the living God. &gt;&gt; Ah, what a promise. &gt;&gt; That means that image is not a creed or it's not a not a religion. It's a people. &gt;&gt; It's Christ living in his bride. And just as a world is growing more and more like the beast, the church is becoming more like our Lord. &gt;&gt; And you can see it. You can see the image of Christ being made flesh today in the what? You can see it, you know, in our behavior, in our walk, in our holiness, the way we live, the way we do. We can see it in in the modesty of her dress. you know, and I want to stop just for a moment and and just put a warning out there because I want to you to make certain what you're wearing reflects the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; You know, I you know, I I visited this fundraising event that on Friday and and thank you for all of you that did that for the young people. God bless you for it. It'll help them to go to camp. But there was um one of our visitors that came there to the fundraising event was a Pentecostal lady, I assume. I I didn't ask her what denomination she was of, but she wore no makeup. She had nice hair, was nicely dressed until she walked away. And there she had a slit in her skirt about halfway up her thigh. And I thought, my god, you go to all of that trouble to be modest and ruin it as you walk away with a slit exposing yourself. &gt;&gt; Goodness. You know, if you just read what the clothes designers say about the design, you know, I challenge you, do a little research before you wear some of these things that these designers put out. Do a little research. They'll tell you exactly. The slit is designed to catch the eye of the male for sex appeal. IT'S DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT FLASH OF LEG THAT moves in and out of the dress to draw attention of the male. And and and that's the design that is done by these perverts of Hollywood, these clothes designers. And and they themselves say this is why it's put there. I mean, it's no secret. You say, "Well, brother Tim, mine's below the knee." Well, problem is Satan in content to leave it below the knee &gt;&gt; and he just keeps creeping up. &gt;&gt; And the designers to the designers say there's nothing more sexy than a sexy exit as a woman walks away with a slit in the back. And I'm just quoting what they say. That's their words. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just telling you God didn't design them. &gt;&gt; They didn't come from the Bible holiness. And for the bride, you're going to see the image of Christ being made flesh today. &gt;&gt; And it will reflect in the modesty of her dress. I'm talking about the bride of Christ in the meekness of her spirit, in the purity of her worship, IN THE FAITHFULNESS OF HER TESTIMONY, IN HER BURNING LOVE FOR THE WORD OF GOD, AND THAT HOLY DETERMINATION DEEP WITHIN HER heart that says, "I'M GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE THAT BREAKS THE CYCLE IN THIS AGE, &gt;&gt; AND I'M NOT GOING WITH THE WORLD &gt;&gt; AND BEING MARKED BY THE BEAST. I WILL MARK I WILL WEAR THE MARK OF CHRIST &gt;&gt; and I will reflect his IMAGE IN MY LIFE. MY DRESS, MY BEHAVIOR AND MY BUSINESS DEALS. EVERYTHING THAT I DO, I will reflect Christ. &gt;&gt; Now as we are looking at this, I want you to underside whom the father is sealed. And we want to look and say, "But what is the evidence of that seal? How did I do I know?" And let's just go back for a moment. Let's just go back at Pentecost BECAUSE THE SEAL OF GOD CAME THERE AS the Holy Ghost fell as a consuming fire. It burned sin out of their lives. IT IGNITED THEM WITH OVERCOMING POWER. AND THOSE BELIEVERS, THEY STAGGERED OUT OF THE UPPER ROOM filled with new wine, drunk fully intoxicated &gt;&gt; with with the spirit. THEY WERE GLORIFYING GOD IN OTHER LANGUAGES. AND THEN THEN OF COURSE WE KNOW WHAT happened that as time progressed the seed that was mature ready for rapture could have been raptured but was predestined to go in the ground because there were more names on the book that had to be manifested on the earth. And so the seed went in the ground and to the dark ages. And and so it deteriorated and and as it deteriorated then there came a LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT the new birth is. What is the seal of God? And and AND OF COURSE IN THAT DARK TIME WHEN the seed was decaying, the proof of the spirit in that time for them was believed that you receive the catechism of Rome and the HOLY GHOST WAS SOMETHING THOUGHT that to be something imparted to you by the priest. BUT LUTHER CAME OUT and he WAS THE FIRST ONE OUT OF THAT DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; And he was nothing like the seed. It was the LIFE OF IT, BUT IT WASN'T THE SEED. It was a chute. It was a a blade. Now, it didn't look like Pentecost. And it wasn't Pentecost. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the original seed, the grain, I mean, &gt;&gt; but it was had the life of it. And it was the spirit of God moving back toward the seed again which would come in the last day as and we would have again the seal of the living God. So Luther comes out of the dark AGES PROCLAIMING THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And for the PEOPLE OF THAT TIME, THOSE early Lutheran, THOSE REBAPTIZERS WE CALL BAPTISTS NOW, you know, faith then became the evidence of the birth. Now, let me let me just tell you that's where A LOT OF MESSAGE BELIEVERS HAVE WENT BACK TO. WELL, if I just believe. &gt;&gt; And they don't realize that, you know, though they may have rejected the Pentecostal Isuza Street idea of speaking in tongues being the evidence, that they've actually went back and and progressed back several more church ages, back to Luther's time &gt;&gt; AND AND FAITH NOW BECOMES THE EVIDENCE OF THE BIRTH because I believe. So I believe the message. So that's my evidence. Well, Wesley knew better than that when he came along. He said, 'Look, there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; You know, yeah, you believed. I'm saying your faith was genuine, &gt;&gt; but there's some reason you're not living holy. &gt;&gt; There's impurities in the life of believers, and we need a good dose of sanctification. &gt;&gt; So, we we need to sanct be sanctified. Well, well, then they began to receive the blessing of sanctification. Now, I want you to get this. When that blessing came or WHEN THAT SANCTIFICATION CAME, many times it exhibit itself in demonstrative um actions such as fainting or falling out and and and you know they would just be so overwhelmed THEY WOULD JUST PASS OUT or maybe they would shout, you know, and and dance for glee. and and it wasn't long until some of them confused the emotion &gt;&gt; with the with the actual cleansing &gt;&gt; and so they were getting the emotion without getting the cleansing. &gt;&gt; SO THEY WERE SAYING IF YOU SHOUT YOU GOT IT. SO THE SHOUTING BECAME the evidence that WE HAVE NOW BEEN SANCTIFIED THAT WE FINALLY BEEN CLEANSED by the spirit. And of course, MANY OF THEM SHOUTED AND DIDN'T AND IT wasn't sanctified. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE, THEY LOOKED TO THE EMOTION THAT CAME WITH IT AND THOUGHT, WELL, WHEN YOU GET HAPPY and left enough to shout, you you got it. And and that became an evidence. And then, you know, WE COME NOW TO THE 20TH CENTURY. And in 1906, the spirit of God began to be poured out as the early rain. It was preparing the soil for the seed for an end time harvest. &gt;&gt; Now you know there were you know there there are rains that come or seasons of blessings &gt;&gt; and there and and there was reigns of the spirit. Don't think of it as just only this last DAY BECAUSE THERE'VE BEEN REIGNS of the spirit &gt;&gt; THAT THAT BROUGHT LUTHER UP. IT WOULD IT REQUIRED the rain of the spirit that caused him to get that revelation. The just shall live by faith. AND THEN ANOTHER REFRESHING COME WITH SANCTIFICATION. Another refreshing come which was the outpouring at Iusa Street &gt;&gt; 1906. Now the problem is is THEY THOUGHT this was Pentecost and it wasn't. and they misnamed it Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Now, this age started, and I'm quoting brother Brandham now in the church age book. THIS AGE STARTED just at the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age when the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost. Now, I don't know where you plan to aim up or aim to to to wind up, but I tell you the the true church must return to being the bride she was at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Now, he says, as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being in the bride she was at Pentecost, WE KNOW THERE must be a necessity, a return of dynamic power. And the believers sense this in their spirit and they begin to cry out to God for a new outpouring as it was in the first century. And what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit. It was then believed that this was indeed the longawwaited restoration. It was not. For the latter RAIN CAN ONLY COME after the former rain, which is a spring or teaching rain. And the latter rain then is the harvest rain. And how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come? The prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come. THUS, WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE RESTORATION AND THE final quickening to the rapture had not come. And in it was a mixture of unrighteous protecting and spiritual blessings and manifesting in the Holy Ghost. As we kept pointing out to you, is also was devil power as men were under controls the devil. Yet no one seemed to realize it. And then to prove it was not the real. These people before the second generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did. So, Brother Brandham says the THE REASON WE KNOW THEY WAS NOT the restoration because they organized. &gt;&gt; They set up decrees. &gt;&gt; And he said, "So, so as we're looking at this, I want you to get this. So because so what we're seeing was a true move of God. It was not Yeah. The devil got in it. Sure he did. Devil gets in all. THE DEVIL GOT IN THE METHODISTS. THE DEVIL GOT IN THE LUTHERAN. The devil got in the Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; But what we was seeing in each one of them was a true move of God. &gt;&gt; Don't ever think it wasn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. that and that true move of God came from that original birth of the seed there at as it come up from Pentecost and and came as a blade through Luther as A TASSEL THROUGH WESLEY AND and now Isusa Street would be just another stage of the wheat plant before the grain and it was the shock and and from that would come the grain. Now, brother Brandham in the resume of the ages, he says, "But what about the true seed?" It will happen just as we said. The people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger of this age. In her will be the fullness of Pentecost. For the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning. THIS IS THUS SAID THE LORD. And he points it out from Joel chapter 2 where he says um be GLAD CHILDREN OF ZION AND REJOICE FOR HEATH GIVEN YOU the former rain moderately and will because she comes down for you the rain the former rain and the and the latter rain in the first month. And and anyway he said God said THE CHURCH IS GOING TO BE RESTORED and he said the Lutheran age did not restore. THE WESTERLY AGE DID NOT RESTORE. THE PENTECOSTAL AGE DID NOT RESTORE. BUT GOD HAS TO RESTORE BECAUSE HE CAN'T DENY HIS WORD. This is not the resurrection of the church. It's the res restoration. GOD WILL TAKE THE CHURCH RIGHT BACK TO PENTECOST of the beginning. &gt;&gt; Now you can see it as we have just read it to you from Revelation chapter 7. SO THE ISUZA Street Pentecostals began to speak with tongues. And and let me tell you, church, they wasn't some madeup gibberish. &gt;&gt; They wasn't some manufactured thing by getting somebody at an altar and jerking their chin and saying words over and over. Listen, there were genuine manifestations of the spirit of God. You know, a Jew heard about it. I just telling you one testimony and there's thousands if you just read the history but a Jew walked into a meeting where in in Isuza street and he had heard about uh this um this outpour and he was he was a represent representative of a secret organization and and that was to to infiltrate some of these uh religious things in order to FIND OUT WHAT THEY were doing in order to warn the Jews. news about the the deception that was going on to keep them from being swept up into into fads of Christianity. AND SO THIS PHENOMENA WAS GOING ON. HE HEARD ABOUT IT AND and he went in there incognito, nobody knowing who he was, nobody know his name, his address, where he'd come from, anything. And he walks into there and and um you know, he hears praying that's going on, but hardly nobody in the little chapel there. and there was an upper room said somebody explained to him well they're up in this upper portion there and they're having a prayer meeting you're welcome to go up there. So he goes in there and as he walks in there's a 14-year-old girl begins to speak in other tongues and it's perfect Hebrew and it tells him his name and the the the religious system he's representing and what he's trying to do AND HIS WHOLE LIFE and and even his sins are exposed. And he goes to this girl and said, "Where did you learn Hebrew? And how did YOU KNOW MY NAME?" SHE SAID, "I don't know Hebrew. I DIDN'T KNOW I was speaking in Hebrews. I was speaking in tongues as the spirit gave me utterance. &gt;&gt; I I'm just telling you these were DON'T DON'T EVER MOCK IT. DON'T MAKE FUN OF IT. &gt;&gt; It was a move of God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT IT WAS NOT THE RESTORATION. NOW, let me just get to you. And and to say they the Zeus of Pentecostals begin to speak with tongues. And to them, this was the evidence. [snorts] But tongues is not the evidence. It's just simply one of the manifestations. It's like me saying, you know, that hair is the evidence of a human. &gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot of things that has hair that ain't human. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it's just one of the things that mammals have, right? &gt;&gt; They have hair. &gt;&gt; It's not everything. &gt;&gt; It's just one of the things. And that's EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. THAT'S one of the manifestations of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; NOW UNDER UNDERSTAND clearly then that tongues ARE A MANIFESTATION. THEY ARE NOT THE EVIDENCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; They are the gift of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; They're not even the spirit &gt;&gt; gifts. They're gifts from the spirit. &gt;&gt; They're a gift, NOT THE GUARANTEE. THE TRUE EVIDENCE IS NOT A SOUND FROM THE MOUTH, BUT IT'S A LIFE CHANGED BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST FORMED IN THE HEART. IT'S IT'S THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT MANIFESTING CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; NOW, NO SCRIPTURE THERE. There is absolutely no scripture that ever declares tongues as the sole evidence of the Holy Ghost. No scripture. In fact, of the matter, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12:30, he says, "Do all speak with tongues with the obvious answer, no." Because he says, "Does all work miracles? You know, have all gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? No. That's an obvious answer. So you see, no scripture declares that tongues is the sole evidence of the Holy Ghost. The Isuza Street movement, they'll build MOST OF ITS DOCTRINE AROUND THIS IDEA of speaking in tonesues as the initial evidence. In other words, it's the initial thing that happens when you receive the Holy Ghost. But I, you know, I want you to see the first time that the Holy Ghost came and possessed an individual. Now, I want you to get some real doctrinal truths right here. &gt;&gt; Because in the Old Testament, there was not a new birth. &gt;&gt; And yeah, they were filled with the spirit in the sense that they were anointed with the spirit, therefore, therefore used of the spirit. And so you will have THOSE LIKE EVEN JOHN THE BAPTIST FILLED WITH THE HOLY Spirit from his mother's womb which means he was anointed by the spirit of God from a baby. &gt;&gt; BUT TO BE POSSESSED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT, IT HADN'T YET been given. &gt;&gt; And the Bible's clear about that. Jesus very word says uh THE SPIRIT HAD NOT YET been given. &gt;&gt; So you see, and there's a reason for THAT. WE'LL GO INTO IT FOR a minute, but let's first of all go into this. The first time the Holy Ghost came was not on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; The first time it came and remained was at the River Jordan. &gt;&gt; When it descended upon Jesus Christ like a dove, &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PATTERN. YES. &gt;&gt; The original pattern of receiving the Holy Ghost is this. It happens to every individual that gets it. Heaven's open. The spirit descends &gt;&gt; and God claims you as his son or daughter. &gt;&gt; Now, you may NOT HAVE A PROPHET SAYING IT. YOU MAY NOT HAVE A vision giving you the dove. YOU MAY NOT HEAR THE VOICE. BUT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; Every person who EVER RECEIVES THE HOLY GHOST, THIS HAPPENS. HEAVEN OPENS. The spirit descends. &gt;&gt; It comes on you and remains. &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS DECLARING THIS IS MY SON. &gt;&gt; MY BELOVED SON, THE SON I LOVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS COME ON SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT GOD IS DOING. AND THERE IS THE FIRST TIME THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME AS HE SAID to John when you the the one you see THE HOLY SPIRIT COME upon and remain. &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; Now, so the original pattern of the Holy Ghost coming to dwell in man was at the River Jordan, not the day of Pentecost, &gt;&gt; that's where it came into men, &gt;&gt; but it came into the man Christ Jesus, &gt;&gt; WHICH WAS WHICH WAS BORN OUTSIDE OF SEX. SOMEBODY HELP me now. &gt;&gt; AND NOW AS A VIRGIN BORN CHILD OF GOD, THE SPIRIT LED him there and he surrendered HIMSELF AND HE WAS BAPTIZED IN OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD. AND IN HIS OBEDIENT ACT, God filled him with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now notice this. Jesus did not speak in tongues. That was not the evidence of his infilling. &gt;&gt; So I want to ask you, what was the evidence of his infilling? The real evidence, the true seal of the spirit was shown when Jesus was led into the wilderness and confronted the devil face to face. &gt;&gt; And he in every temptation, in every way, he overcame. HE RESISTED SATAN'S LIES. HE DIDN'T SIN. HE DIDN'T WHAT I MEAN he didn't sin. HE DIDN'T DISBELIEVE THE WORD. HE STOOD FIRMLY ON WHAT WAS WRITTEN AND SAID, "It's written." &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S THE EVIDENCE. A LIFE THAT CAN FACE THE ENEMY AND STAND UNSHAKEN ON THE WORD. &gt;&gt; That's what you WANT TO SEE IN YOUR LIFE. Tongues are a gift. YES. BUT THE TRUE EVIDENCE of the Holy Ghost is a VICTORIOUS LIFE. A LIFE THAT RESISTS SIN, A life that BELIEVES THE WORD THAT OVERCOMES THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YET, despite the word's clear teaching, this this movement formed a doctrine. I'm talking about the Isuza movement. And when they formed a when they did that, they it signals death. They organized around it. &gt;&gt; And and when man organizes around a partial truth and makes it the requirement of salvation and fellowship, they have left the leadership of the spirit and entered into spiritual death. &gt;&gt; And I want to show I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHERE THAT WENT TO. I want to show you where that went to. Yes. Originally, genuine gifts. And I'm not even saying there's not any genuine gifts because I I I BELIEVE THEY CAN STILL SPEAK with genuine tongues. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about in Isusa Street. &gt;&gt; They can still speak with genuine tongues, &gt;&gt; but not all. Because I'm going TO TELL YOU WHY. THEY HAD SO MANY BECAUSE OF THIS requirement of of salvation being speaking in tongues. And the scripture IS CLEAR THAT ALL DON'T SPEAK WITH TONGUES. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY DON'T RECEIVE THAT one particular gift. &gt;&gt; So what did they do? THEY HAD TO FORCE IT upon the people. In other words, it was it was taught and there would be many people that was Christian people. Brother Jimbo, you know this Christian people, godly people lived right. uh dinner that but couldn't speak with tongues and they pray and pray and pray and couldn't speak with tonesues &gt;&gt; and they never prayed through as they called into speaking in tongues and so what you know in the 1950s because I I was born in 54 so even it was going on in the 60s when I was old enough to remember you know there were moves that would began to go through sweeping through the movement the Pentecostal movement while we have 50 that was filled with the Holy Ghost. Last night we had a hundred over here that was filled with the Holy Ghost. WE HAD OH, WE'RE HAVING great revival. You know why? Because one of those preachers figured out how to get these people that were living Holy Ghost filled lives that were living triumphant Christian lives. Figured out how to get them speak in tongues. And that was to get them to the altar and say a word over and over and over again until they got a confusion of language. So they would say Jesus until they've spoken in what they called other tongues. And so much of the tongues even John G. Lake said most much of our tongues are now rattly and not genuine. &gt;&gt; He began to see it move and it WAS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRED EVERYBODY TO SPEAK IN OTHER TONGUES. SO THEY HAD TO MANUFACTURE IT &gt;&gt; AND IT CAUSED BABYLON CONFUSION. a confusion of languages. Now again they and and and they took the letter of of their of their doctrine and killed with it and it looked like a return to Pentecost but it proved it wasn't. It couldn't be BECAUSE IT ORGANIZED AROUND A falsehood and that's death not life. IT LOOKED SO CLOSE THAT MULTITUDES WERE DECEIVED. But it was the chaff. IT WAS THE CHAFF OR THE SHUCK, not the grain. And yet it looked good. And it had the sounds and the energies of revival. IT HAD GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT. It had miracles. It it came with shouting AND GREAT JOY. AND IT LOOKED LIKE A return to Pentecost, but it proved it wasn't because it organized. IT FORMED A SYSTEM OF MAN AROUND A MANIFESTATION INSTEAD INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE PERSON OF CHRIST THROUGH HIS WORD. AND IT WAS not the grain. It was a husk. It was the chap. And then to PROVE IT, THERE WAS SO SET THAT WHEN GOD DID SEND THEM A PROPHET with correction of THE WORD OF GOD, THEY TURNED IT DOWN. That's true. &gt;&gt; NOW AGAIN YOU SEE AND TO DO WHEN THEY DID THEY DIED [screaming] BECAUSE THE HUSK WILL DRY UP AS THE GRAIN matures &gt;&gt; and in ITS GRAIN BUT IN ITS GRAIN STATE THE HUSK LOOKS IDENTICAL ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE GRAIN. It even will protect the seed for a time. It would be it would be the the group of people that GOD WOULD SEND A PROPHET TO AND OUT OF THERE WOULD COME A MESSAGE AND CALL A BRIDE. OUT OF THAT WOULD COME A GRAIN. &gt;&gt; NOW, so you see, BUT IT'S NOT THE LIFE. It's and IT CANNOT BE THE FINAL FRUIT. LISTEN, Matthew 3:12 SAID, "HE WILL GATHER HIS WHEAT into the garner." That's the rapture. But he will BURN UP THE CHAFF WITH UNQUENCHABLE FIRE. That's the tribulation. &gt;&gt; So what was this hus movement of the Isuza Pentecost? It was a necessary part. &gt;&gt; You know, YOU CAN'T LOOK BACK AT AND SAY, "OH, THEY WERE NOTHING." OH, NO. THEY WERE. They were the move of God. Listen, God would use those men even in the infancy of this message TO HELP HELP BROTHER BRANDHAM ORGANIZE the meeting or set up his campaigns. Print the books, &gt;&gt; give the testimonies of the miracles, &gt;&gt; WRITE A MAN SENT FROM GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; PUT out books, you know, booklets of his sermons and and and get THE THE PILLAR OF FIRE PICTURE AUTHENTICATED. &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD USE THOSE MEN. THEY WERE THEY WERE PART OF THE MOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; But there come a time of maturity where IT SEPARATED THE CHAFF FROM the grain. &gt;&gt; Now you see It's it's was the sheath. IT WAS THE SOFT OUTER FORM. IT LOOKED LIKE THE REAL THING, BUT INSIDE THERE WAS NO MATURE SEED, but it could not be back to the original until the word was restored. I I want you to get that &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET HAD NOT COME ON THE SCENE. AND and but according to the TIME THAT WE NOW stand here in this last age, the prophet messenger of Revelation 10:7, he's already sounded his message. &gt;&gt; AND ONCE MORE, WE HAVE THUS SAYETH THE LORD. AMEN. And it's it's it was PROVEN WITH INFALLIBLE VINDICATION. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND SO THUS WE'RE NOW IN A TIME WHERE THE true seed is is already maturing. And of course, WE ARE NOW IN THE HARVEST CYCLE. THIS IS THE BRIDE AGE. THIS IS THE RAPTURE AGE. THIS IS BRIDE TIME. So as brother Brandham said in the church age book, and I quote now, Luther had the spirit of God, but his age was not the age of full re restoration by another outpouring like in the beginning. It was the same with Wesley, Booth, Knox, Whitefield, Brainard, Jonathan Edwards, Mueller, and so forth. Surely they were full of the Holy Ghost. Yes, they certainly were. But in the age in which they live was not the age of restoration. Neither was any AGE BUT THIS LAST AGE, THE AGE OF COMPLETE BLACKOUT IN APOSTASY. This is the age of apostasy. And this is the age of the restoration. It is the age of the finished cycle and with this it's all over. AGAIN HE WOULD SAY in the sardanian churches and the way that IT WAS DONE BY GOD'S PERFECT will and programming the Lutheran had the Holy Ghost potentially under justification. The Methodists had it potentially under sanctification and to he and today it has brought back a restoration. THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let me read that again. The Lutherans had the Holy Ghost potentially &gt;&gt; under justification. &gt;&gt; That was a work of the spirit. &gt;&gt; The Methodists had it potentially under this sanctification, a deeper work of the spirit. &gt;&gt; AND TODAY IT IS BROUGHT BACK A RESTORATION. THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER REVIVAL OF EMOTION. ALTHOUGH, let me tell you, there will be great emotion. There will BE GREAT JOY. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT'S THE SOUND OF THE HARVEST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S REJOICING IN THE TIME OF THE HARVEST. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE TIME WHERE THE WORD IS BEING RESTORED. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when it's restored, AMEN. DAVID DANCED BEFORE THE ARK. &gt;&gt; DAVID'S SAYING THEY REJOICED. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE IN THE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; SO, WELL, NOW THAT'S WHY A MAN DIED. NO, IT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY WERE DANCING REJOICING BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT IT ON A MAN-MADE CART. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T CONSULT THE WORD IN THE WAY TO BRING BACK. AND YOU CANNOT BRING BACK PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT BRING BACK THE MERCY SEAT. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT BRING BACK THE BLOOD &gt;&gt; ON A MAN-MADE SYSTEM. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN BRING IT BACK IS BY A PROPHET AUTHENTICATED WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT TELLS YOU THE INSTRUCTION IS GOT TO BE CARRIED UPON THE HEART. ONLY THE HEART CAN CARRY THE MERCY SEAT. &gt;&gt; Only the heart can restore the word. &gt;&gt; You can't bring it back. &gt;&gt; It's got to be restored upon the heart. &gt;&gt; Therefore, brought to its place. &gt;&gt; Amen. It had to be brought back on the shoulders of the priesthood. &gt;&gt; And you're the priesthood. &gt;&gt; GOT TO BE PUT OVER THE HEART. IT'S GOT TO CHANGE THE LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND IT CAN'T COME ON A MAN-MADE CART LIKE THE PHILISTINES DID. IT &gt;&gt; David was trying to BRING IT BACK THAT WAY. AND SO HAVE THEY DONE IN ALL THESE OTHER MOVEMENTS WITH ALL their emotion, BUT THEY DIDN'T BRING BACK THE ARK &gt;&gt; THAT CAUSED DEATH. OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; BUT WE COME BACK TO THE LAST DAY AND I WANT YOU TO GET THIS. AMEN. IS NOW IT IS A TIME WHERE THE WORD IS BEING RESTORED BY [screaming] THE AUTHENTICATED MESSENGER &gt;&gt; WHO SAYS NOW UPON THE HEART OF THE BELIEVER IS WHERE THE HOLY GHOST HAS GOT TO BE PLACED. AND THAT'S WHEN THE ART OF THE WORD CAN BE PUT BACK AND BROUGHT BACK. HERE IS WHERE FULL RESTORATION COMES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So it wasn't because they jumped and shouted. They jumped and shouted both times. &gt;&gt; We have emotion. We should have emotion. &gt;&gt; Brother, we are the people of the new wine. &gt;&gt; We are the people that he said don't hurt the oil in the wine. &gt;&gt; We are the people. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have got the word in the spirit. &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE NOT ANOTHER REVIVAL OF OF EMOTION. We are looking for the ripened grain, A WORDBORN BRIDE FULL of spirit AND TRUTH WITH SIGNS. OH YES, WITH SIGNS. THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT SIGNS ALONE, BUT CHARACTER, POWER, DISCERNMENT. THE BRIDE WILL MIRROR THE ORIGINAL SEED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT JUST IN NOISE AND EMOTION, BUT IN NATURE. They'll have the nature of Christ. &gt;&gt; SO I SAY WITH THIS WITH URGENCY THIS MORNING, DON'T SETTLE FOR THE HUSK. DON'T STOP AT A SHOUT &gt;&gt; OR A TONGUE OR THE THRILL OF SENSATION AND AND DON'T DRY [screaming] UP IN FORMALISM LIKE THE HUSK. THERE'S A DANGER EITHER WAY. I KNOW WE ALWAYS POINT, OH THE EMOTION, EMOTION. I TELL YOU WHAT'S WORSE IS YOUR formalism &gt;&gt; because it's BETTER TO HAVE WILDFIRE than no fire. &gt;&gt; FORMALISM, YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE A CATHOLIC CHURCH. &gt;&gt; TAKES THE SHOUT THE GLORY OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; TAKES THE REJOICING out of it &gt;&gt; while the seals are open. Brother Tim, we're mature people. And when the seals were open in heaven, everything said amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. THERE WAS A REVIVAL GOING ON IN HEAVEN AND THAT'S ONLY A REFLECTION OF WHAT SHOULD BE GOING ON ON EARTH BECAUSE WE ARE REFLECTION OF GLORY. [applause] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO SAY DON'T IDOLIZE EXPERIENCES. &gt;&gt; RETURN TO THE WORD MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; And we'll do that sometimes. You'll see people idolize them. They see somebody do this and get blessed that way. They try to do the same thing. We don't need impersonators. &gt;&gt; Our imitators, &gt;&gt; let God say, "Well, Brother Tim, I never shout." Well, you don't have to. &gt;&gt; Some people cry. Well, I don't ever cry. Well, I you know, maybe you just sit there stunned. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TODAY, YOU KNOW, DON'T IDOLIZE AN EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. JUST RETURN TO THE WORD MADE FLESH. IT'S THE WORD MADE FLESH IN YOU. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK AT. &gt;&gt; You see, the Bible said in John 8:31, "If you continue in my word, then you are my disciples indeed." &gt;&gt; Sanctify them through thy truth. John 17:17. Thy word is truth. So be washed by the washing of the water by the word. Now this is this is what you know even sermons like I did last Sunday and even this morning is washing. But I I want to I want to I want to bring out something very very important. And maybe this is as far as I'll get today. I'm not sure how how deep I'll get into this. I've got lots I want to say. But there is a difference between the anointing of the spirit and the seal of the spirit. &gt;&gt; But both are needed. And it seemed like we can't keep a balance in the message because we will castigate the anointing of the spirit and make it worthless and and without value and say all we need is just the seal. Well, you do need the seal and without it, you're not going. But the Bible said, "He that hath anointed us has also sealed us." &gt;&gt; But there is a difference between the anointing and the seal and both are needed. Now let's just dive into the details. Let's look at this. Scriptures clearly distinguishes between being anointed with the spirit and being filled with the spirit. And the these sometimes will actually overlap in in purpose, but they're not identical in measure or relationship or indwelling. In the Old Testament, the spirit of God would come upon men and women. It would anoint them for a task. &gt;&gt; It would empower them for a mission. IT WOULD INSPIRE THEM TO SPEAK. But in the New Testament, John the Baptist introduced a new and a greater dimension of the spirit's work. Now, I want you to listen carefully. John 1:33 says, "He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, upon whom thou seeth the spirit descending and remaining on him, the same as he which baptized with the Holy Ghost. Now, are you going to stop just for a minute and let's just talk about this descending and remaining? Because the spirit of God would descend upon Moses and and and and would come upon him, but then the spirit would leave. &gt;&gt; It could not possess an individual until it had been purchased. Amen. &gt;&gt; He won't possess the devil's property. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, you would have men in the Old Testament who would be anointed with the spirit for a mission, for a purpose, WOULD BE INSPIRED TO SPEAK, would speak prophetical word, dynamic words. Now I want you to notice HE SAID THE ONE THAT YOU see that you shall see the spirit descended and reign on it is the same the SAME AS HE WHICH BAPTIZES WITH THE HOLY GHOST. Now here's where we get the word baptism of the Holy Ghost. It means an immersion. &gt;&gt; It means to BE COMPLETELY SATURATED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It means to be filled with the spirit. &gt;&gt; And he SAID, "NOW THE ONE YOU see the spirit descending and remaining, he's the one &gt;&gt; that is GOING TO IMPART THE BAPTISM or the immersion into the spirit." &gt;&gt; Now, this had never happened. John speaking of this coming Messiah, the Christ, which means anointed one, that he would not merely anoint men, but he would immerse them into the very life of the spirit himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in Matthew 3:11, he said, "I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, BUT HE THAT COMETH after me shall baptize YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND with fire. NOW, THIS WAS SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW. The prophets had been anointed. The judges were empowered. The kings were overshadowed. But none had ever been indwelt. &gt;&gt; The spirit could visit, but he couldn't abide. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE UNTIL JESUS SHED his blood, there was no perfect atonement. The blood of bulls and goats could not COULD NEVER REMOVE SIN COULD ONLY cover it. &gt;&gt; AND THE HUMAN HEART REMAINED unregenerated and unfit for the permanent indwelling of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus cried, "It is finished." WHEN THAT VEIL WAS TORN, THERE WAS A WAY THAT WAS MADE INTO THE holiest and it WAS OPENED AND THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST DID NOT JUST MERELY COVER SIN. IT CLEANSED IT. &gt;&gt; AND NOW THROUGH THAT CLEANSING, THE HOLY GHOST COULD TAKE UP RESIDENCE within man's soul. And the anointing of the spirit though that came was an empowerment for a task. And throughout the scripture, men and women were were per they were anointed by the spirit to and they would do specific roles and they would DO IT WITHOUT POSSESSING THE INDWELLING fullness of the Holy Ghost. They could be anointed meaning the spirit came on THEM FOR A DIVINE PURPOSE. LET'S TAKE THE LET'S TAKE THE APOSTLE uh not the apostle, the king Saul. The Bible said in 1st Samuel 10:1 that Samuel took a a vial of oil and and poured it on Saul's head. And and then it says in verse six, "And the spirit of the Lord will come UPON THEE AND THOU SHALT PROPHESY." WELL, SAMUEL or Saul was anointed and the spirit came upon him temporarily for kingship. But later this fear OF THE LORD DEPARTED FROM SAUL. &gt;&gt; I want to say something that's different from you. &gt;&gt; Well, the Holy GHOST CAN LEAVE ME. NO, he can't. You're sealed. &gt;&gt; How long &gt;&gt; to your body change? &gt;&gt; The day of redemption. For he said, "I will never leave you &gt;&gt; or forsake you." &gt;&gt; ONCE GOD CLAIMED YOU AS HIS OWN, &gt;&gt; HE WILL NEVER EVER LOSE YOU. &gt;&gt; HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; BUT SAUL WAS ANOINTED AND PROPHESIED, &gt;&gt; WHICH MEANS TO SPEAK UNDER THE UTTERANCE OF THE SPIRIT. AND THE SPIRIT CAME UP ON HIM TEMPORARILY. &gt;&gt; But then it departed. &gt;&gt; He was anointed for service but not fueled for life transformation. &gt;&gt; Balum. Here's another example. The spirit of God came upon him and he prophesied truth. &gt;&gt; Not a lie. Truth. &gt;&gt; But yet he was a false prophet. Yes. &gt;&gt; And taught Israel to sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Remember, it wasn't his inspiration from God, his prophecy that misled Israel. &gt;&gt; It was his doctrine. &gt;&gt; What about Samson? The spirit of the Lord began to move on him at times. IT MOVED ON HIM FOR ACTS OF DELIVERANCE. YET, he lacked that inner sanctification and control. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Look at David. You know there the you KNOW SAMUEL POURED THE OIL UPON him and the Bible said AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD CAME UPON David from that day forward. You see it came upon him for service. BUT EVEN HE PRAYED CUZ he knew BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'D done that he could lose what he had. So he prays, "Take not thy holy spirit from me." because he knew what happened with Paul or Saul rather when the spirit left an evil spirit took him. &gt;&gt; But in the new covenant, I want you to get this. This is different BECAUSE IN ALL OF THESE CASES, the spirit came on them for empowerment. Yet, it didn't dwell on them like in the new covenant sense. THEY WERE TOUCHED BY THE SPIRIT BUT NOT TRANSFORMED. THAT THE OIL FLOWED OVER THEM BUT couldn't fill them. &gt;&gt; BUT NOW THE PROMISES IS DIFFERENT. HERE WE COME TO A NEW COVENANT. AND JOHN 7:37 SAYS, "IF ANY MAN THIRST, LET HIM COME TO ME AND DRINK. HE THAT BELIEVETH ON ME, AS THE SCRIPTURE HAS SAID, OUT OF HIS BELLY SHALL FLOW RIVERS OF LIVING WATERS." BUT THIS SPAKE HE OF THE SPIRIT THAT THEY WHICH BELIEVE ON HIM SHOULD RECEIVE. FOR THE HOLY GHOST WAS NOT yet given. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS WAS NOT YET GLORIFIED. &gt;&gt; SO THE HOLY GHOST COULD NOT BE GIVEN UNTIL JESUS ASCENDED &gt;&gt; AND WOULD SEND BACK THE COMFORTER. And he and HE SAID, "NOW THE HOLY SPIRIT IS WITH YOU." NOW, &gt;&gt; I want you to GET THIS. IT'S BY THE SPIRIT YOU HAVE PERFORMED MIRACLES. IT IS BY THE SPIRIT THAT YOU have absolutely cast out devils. &gt;&gt; IT IS BY THE SPIRIT &gt;&gt; THAT you've done this. &gt;&gt; He is with you now, but he shall be in you. Let that sink down real deep. He's with you now. That's him. You performed miracles by him. &gt;&gt; Peter, you got a revelation by him. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood didn't give this to you. Listen, you know this this this is He's with you now, but there's coming a change. &gt;&gt; HE SHALL BE IN YOU. &gt;&gt; NOW, I WANT YOU TO GET THIS BECAUSE YOU see the the believer COULD NOT WOULD NO LONGER WOULD NO LONGER BE ANOINTED FOR A SEASON, BUT WOULD BE FILLED FOR ETERNITY. LOOK, THE SPIRIT DESCENDING AND REMAIN. &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT WOULD NO LONGER COME FROM UPON HIM FROM WITHOUT, BUT WOULD WOULD FLOW LIKE A RIVER WITHIN. IT WOULD BE A CONTINUAL CLEANSING. IT WOULD BE A RENEWING. IT WOULD BE A LIFEGIVING STREAM SPRINGING UP INTO eternal life. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS A BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. NOT NOT JUST THE SPIRIT UPON YOU. NOT THAT'S THE ANOINTING, but the spirit WITHIN YOU. THAT'S THE SEAL. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST A VISITATION, BUT A HABITATION. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST POWER FOR A TASK, BUT THE LIFE OF GOD TRANSFORMING THE SOUL. &gt;&gt; And when it came when we come to the the New Testament, especially after Calvary and Pentecost, the spirit worked shift from resting upon to dwelling within. John 14:17, he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. &gt;&gt; Even the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because receiveth him not, neither knoweth him, but you know him, for he dwelleth with you AND SHALL BE IN YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So Jesus MARKED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPIRIT'S OLD TESTAMENT PRESENCE UPON AND WITH AND AND and the New Testament indwelling in &gt;&gt; Acts 2 and 4. And they were filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT WAS NOT A TEMPORARY ANOINTING, &gt;&gt; but it was a permanent indwelling. IT WAS CHRIST IN THEM, THE HOPE OF GLORY. SO TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT IS TO HAVE THE LIFE, THE NATURE, THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST LIVING WITHIN. IT IS A CONSTANT ABIDING PRESENCE THAT PRODUCES THE LIFE OF GOD, THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT, THE MANIFESTATIONS of God in your life. &gt;&gt; But the anointing gives empowerment for task or an office. You can be sealed with the Holy Spirit, but you still need the anointing to preach &gt;&gt; or to operate any gift. &gt;&gt; A gift of healing requires an anointing. A gift of faith requires an anointing. &gt;&gt; And you can be sealed with the spirit of God and not anointed. Oh, you're confusing me, Brother Tim. How in the world? How in the world can you be filled and not anointed? Well, I tell you what. You know, I I'm filled with the spirit every day. &gt;&gt; I'm sealed to the day of redemption, &gt;&gt; but there are times THAT I'M ANOINTED TO PREACH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, YOU SEE, THOSE DAYS I'M FILLED, BUT I'M NOT NECESSARILY ANOINTED. BUT THE ANOINTING COMES TO empower me, &gt;&gt; to give me THE ABILITY TO SPEAK GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; To speak under inspiration, &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, SO, SO AGAIN, YOU KNOW, WHEN WHEN Jesus now, now listen, WHEN JESUS WAS FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND HE GOES INTO THE wilderness and he's tempted of the devil, remember, he can see the devil. You can't. And I guarantee you, he didn't FEEL SAVED AT THAT TIME. &gt;&gt; He was feeling an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; And he was hearing a wrong voice. &gt;&gt; And he WAS HAVING TO JUDGE THAT VOICE BY THE WORD. AND HE was in a battle. &gt;&gt; And the heavy breath of Satan was in his face. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And the gloomy spirit was all around him. I WANT YOU TO KNOW HE DID NOT FEEL ANOINTED AT THAT MOMENT. &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAID THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME AND HEATH anointed me to preach &gt;&gt; and HE WOULD TAKE THE WORD OF GOD UNDER THAT ANOINTING AND PREACH &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEALED WITH THE SPIRIT. BUT WHEN YOU COME TO CHURCH, YOU NEED TO GET ANOINTED WITH THE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE SING THE SONGS OF ZION. THAT'S WHY BROTHER WAIT AND AND AND sometimes people get confused. They get anointed and aren't sealed &gt;&gt; and they jump and dance and shout and run the aisle and they wouldn't field. They wouldn't seal &gt;&gt; but they were anointed because Judas was anointed and he cast out devils. anointed and he preached anointed &gt;&gt; not with the evil spirit, the genuine Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and had no seal. &gt;&gt; But Peter did too. &gt;&gt; So when it come time between him and ugly self and Christ, he he chose self over Christ. &gt;&gt; He wasn't converted. &gt;&gt; But after he was converted, he could strengthen his brethren. So don't tell me the anointing isn't important. Let's go a little bit further. Now they're not the same. Though they both flow from the same divine source. The anointing empowers. The infilling transforms. And at Pentecost, THEY BOTH FELL TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. We want to BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SEAL AND BE ANOINTED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW AGAIN, BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS US IN THE EASTER SEAL, he said, "And you're quickened." And he said, "This quickening power brings your body INTO A RAPTURED CONDITION ALREADY." And the Pentecostal people up there when they got quickened by the spirit, listen to me, when those Pentecostal group got up there, up there on the day of Pentecost received their abstract deed from God, SURE IT GLORIFIED THEIR SOULS. THEY SCREAMED. THEY SAW TONGUES OF FIRE separated upon each of them. It so quickened THEIR BODY TILL THEY COULDN'T EVEN speak in the earthly language anymore. It quickened their body to heavenly language. The place that they're going to quickening POWER SHOOK THEIR MORTAL BODIES TILL THEIR ENTIRE MORTAL LANGUAGE WAS TRANSFIGURED, TRANSFORMED into an immortal language. What quickening power? WHAT something that belongs? If the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead DWELLS IN YOUR MORTAL BODIES, it shall also quicken your mortal bodies. WE ARE QUICKENED THEN BY THE power of the living God. TONGUES QUICKENED UP TO QUICKEN TO A new heavenly language to speak to them a rapturing up RAISING UP INTO A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE THAN WHAT THEY EVER lived in. ALSO WITH NEW QUICKENING LIFE IN THEM THAT COME in them. It quickened their language. They spoke in new tongues. Oh yes. [snorts] That's what I love about coming to church &gt;&gt; is you get caught up into a new atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. You get raptured up sitting right in church. You be brought into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; What is that? It's the anointing. And when THAT ANOINTING COMES, IT breaks the yoke. &gt;&gt; OH, THE CLOUDS OF DEPRESSION AND UNBELIEF AND FAITH COMES AND HEALINGS comes and miracles come. That's right. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THE ANOINTING COMES. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN BE HEALED. YOU CAN PRAY FOR THE SICK AND NOT BE SEALED. You you you can you CAN HAVE MIRACLES AND NOT BE SEALED. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'RE SEALED, YOU CAN'T DENY THE ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; That's why I wonder if a lot of these are sealed out there claiming the seal of the Holy Ghost and deny the anointing. Now listen. Brother Brandham explained what it took for his divine healing gift to work and he explained the difference between anointing and power and why people are taugh tossed about. He said some people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is. Did you ever think of that? When was the greatest anointing ever given to anyone? And what did they do when they had the anointing? The greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ. We have the spirit by measure. He had it without measure. And one day he entered in the temple. And he picked up the scroll and he read, "The spirit of God is upon me. For he hath anointed me to preach the acceptable year, to bind up the broken hearts, to heal the sick, to give sight to the blind." And now we would think if such an anointing was on him that had been prophesied 800 years before that would come that he with that type of anointing the full blessing anointed upon him. We would all want to run all over the building and scream and holler. But the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth. NOW THAT'S WHAT HE DONE under the anointing. The anointing is not emotions. The anointing is supreme power in CONTROL LIKE KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT AND HOW. And that's what's here. &gt;&gt; So he was explaining his gift and he said, "NOW HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. It doesn't make me want to run the aisle and scream and shout." &gt;&gt; You see, the anointing IS NOT EMOTION. THAT'S not emotions. or the the the ANOINTING IS NOT EMOTION BUT the anointing can make you emotional. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW JESUS UNDER the anointing OF THE SPIRIT TAUGHT THE PEOPLE SAYING THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME BECAUSE he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. HE HAS SENT ME to heal the brokenhearted. So even Jesus though he WAS THE WORD MADE FLESH, HE DID NOT MINISTER IN HIS OWN STRENGTH. HE WAITED until the spirit came upon him at Jordan. Remember that. And then he declared, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me." &gt;&gt; Now that WAS NOT JUST A BLESSING. That's empowerment. &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING EQUIPS A MAN FOR his calling. That's right. &gt;&gt; IT TURNS HUMAN WORDS INTO DIVINE UTTERANCE. IT TURNS INTELLECT INTO REVELATION. It sermons it it it TURNS SERMONS INTO FIRE. YOU SEE, A MAN MIGHT STAND BEHIND THE DESK AND GIVE A LECTURE, BUT HE CANNOT PREACH UNTIL HE'S ANOINTED. &gt;&gt; HE MIGHT BE SEALED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. HE MIGHT CARRY THE LIFE OF GOD WITHIN HIM, but yet there's another measure that comes upon him when God calls him to preach. And that's what John spoke about when he said in Revelation 19:10. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. &gt;&gt; When the anointing comes, it lifts a man beyond himself and he becomes a vessel through which the spirit bears witness of Christ. Brother Brandham said he's a preacher and when he preaches he has that anointing. You ministers have that anointing. You people who speak with tongues have that anointing. If it's really the Holy Ghost speaking through you is see it's the same spirit only operating in different forms. So when a person speaks in tonesues if it's genuine tonesues it's the spirit's anointing. &gt;&gt; It's not emotion. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit's anointing. It's not manufactured &gt;&gt; when a man preaches. It's the spirit anointing. &gt;&gt; Is not human intellect. &gt;&gt; It's divine uncction. &gt;&gt; It's an anointing. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham talks about that and he says and he's preaching on who is this? HE WANTS TO IDENTIFY WHO IS THIS IN OUR MIDST. AND HE SAID, WHO IS THIS THAT COME INTO a congregation that will anoint it till one will speak with tongues and another give the interpretation? That's anointing. Exactly. Tell a sinner of his sins and where he's at. WHO IS THIS THAT STANDS IN A in an illiterate woman that can't read her name and will stand under the anointing of God of the Holy Ghost and speak words that she's never heard? And a Mexican raised up in the church and say, "I understood every word of it." has even called me by name and has called me to repentance. God have mercy on my soul. He said, "Who is this?" So, the anointing is power in supreme CONTROL. IT'S THE POWER OF GOD CONTROLLING THE TONGUE. IT'S THE POWER OF GOD CONTROLLING THE GIFT. IT'S NOT AN EMOTION. TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT THOUGH is something much deeper. IT'S NOT MERELY A POWERFUL TASK. IT'S THE LIFE OF CHRIST living in you. &gt;&gt; You know, AGAIN, HE THAT DWELLETH WITH YOU SHALL be in you. Again, he says, EPHESIANS 3:19, THAT YOU MIGHT BE FILLED WITH ALL THE FULLNESS of God. Get this. The anointing comes and goes as needed. infilling abides. &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING ENABLES YOU TO SERVE. &gt;&gt; The infilling enables you to live. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN A MAN IS FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT, THE VERY NATURE OF GOD IS IMPARTED IN HIS SOUL. AND LOVE, PEACE, JOY, LONGSUFFERING, GENTLENESS, GOODNESS, FAITH, MEEKNESS, TEMPERANCE, ALL OF THAT. IT'S TRANS IT'S TRANSFORMATIONAL. IT'S NOT JUST A VISITATION. YOU ARE TRANSFORMED. YET, let me say this. You can be anointed to shout and it's not just emotion. It's a spirit on you. &gt;&gt; And you can be anointed to rejoice and it's the joy of the Lord. And you can ble be blessed. I want I want just and you and brother Brandham even said, you know, that's not necessarily the power of God. He said that's the blessings of God. &gt;&gt; And let me just say this, but what's wrong with having the blessings? &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. &gt;&gt; I mean, Jacob didn't just want the birthright. &gt;&gt; He wanted the blessing to go with it. AND ESAU WANTED THE BLESSING having rejected the birthright. &gt;&gt; That's the difference between the Jacob AND ESAU'S. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THEM TAKE THE BLESSINGS of God and the and and the demonstrations of the SPIRIT OF GOD WITHOUT receiving the birthright and the other wants the birthright and the blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, a Jacob that has a heart for God will even cheat to get it. &gt;&gt; He'll do whatever he has to do &gt;&gt; to lay hold on the promise. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Now, you can put you can be blessed beyond measure. You can shout, you can dance, rejoice under the touch of the spirit and and yet never move one mountain of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Blessing is God's goodness. Empowerment is God's authority. &gt;&gt; And many shout under the blessings of God, but very few stand under the burden of the anointing. And the difference is the blessing refreshes you. And I don't know about you, but I WANT HIS BLESSINGS. &gt;&gt; I WANT THAT REFRESHING FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I WANT MY BURDENS LIFTED. &gt;&gt; I WANT JOY IN my heart. &gt;&gt; I want it to bubble over and overflow. &gt;&gt; And it should. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; BLESSINGS REFRESHING YOU, BUT ANOINTING commissions you and the seal fills you. AMEN. NOW JESUS SAID IN Acts 1:8, "You shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me." Now that's not just joy. That's authority. That's a mantel for divine testimony. On the other hand, you can have great anointing and still lack true character. This is why Paul said, "Though I speak with tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, which is God's basic nature, I've become the sound and brass and tinkle and symbol. I'm just noise. And though I have all faith so that I could move mountains and I don't have God's basic nature, which is love, I'm nothing. &gt;&gt; And you can have THE POWER TO PROPHESY, HEAL THE SICK, PERFORM MIRACLES, and not yet bear the nature of the one who gave the power. And that's why Jesus warned in Matthew 7:22, "MANY SHALL COME TO me in that day and say, "Have we not prophesied in thy name?" And then what did he say? I will profess to them, I never knew you. You weren't born of me. &gt;&gt; YET THEY CONFESS. WE HAVE DONE. PUT it Put that up. Ma Matthew 7:22. and many shall come to me in that day. Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many mighty, many wonderful works. Now listen, don't get confused. Nothing wrong with prophesying, nothing wrong with the works, nothing wrong with casting out devils. It's the signs of believers. &gt;&gt; These things follow believers. When faith is exhibited, this happens. &gt;&gt; But he said the problem is is not the works. You were never born of me. &gt;&gt; I never knew you. &gt;&gt; So power without love, without the nature of God is like lamp without oil. It's like a gift without the giver. &gt;&gt; It's anointing. The anointing comes on you to enable. The infilling comes within you to transform you. The anointing empowers your hands. THE INFILLING SANCTIFIES the heart. To be anointed is to be equipped. THE INFILLING THOUGH SANCTIFIES THE HEART and makes your heart right with God. So you see, it's to be changed. So it's not BY MIGHT NOR BY POWER, BUT BY MY SPIRIT, SAYETH THE LORD. SO WHEN THE SPIRIT FILLS YOU, YOU BEAR THE LIFE OF CHRIST. WHEN THE SPIRIT ANOINTS YOU, YOU MANIFEST THE WORKS of Christ. So we need them both. &gt;&gt; But the problem of it is is that when we realize that you can have the anointing and not be sealed, THEN PEOPLE THROW AWAY THE ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; WELL, WE DON'T WANT the anointing. Yes, YOU WANT THE ANOINTING. THE ANOINTING EMPOWERS YOU. THE ANOINTING GIFTS YOU. THE ANOINTING GIVES YOU ABILITY. THE SEAL SAVES YOU TO THE DAY OF REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; And this is where we get the criticism because we're a church that believes in the anointing and the infilling. We want the seal. &gt;&gt; But if you really have the seal, then the spirit that feels anoints. &gt;&gt; AND JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE THE FALSE ANOINTED OUT HERE doesn't mean it was even for them. &gt;&gt; THE TRUE ANOINTING CAME. THE RAIN COMES TO FALL UPON THE WHEAT. &gt;&gt; The others JUST END THE FIELD WITH IT. GOD SENDS IT FOR THE GRAIN. AND THE TRUE ANOINTING IS WHAT GOD HAS SENT IN THIS LAST DAY TO ANOINT THE BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO FILL THEM WITH HIS SPIRIT TO SEAL THEM INTO THE DAY OF REDEMPTION TO GIVE THEM POWER TO LIVE AN OVERCOMING LIFE. &gt;&gt; And together they make a complete man of God, a spiritfilled and spirit empowered, a vessel of his nature &gt;&gt; and of his power. that the musicians come. You know, as we labor on this, just look at the Bible. You can tell the difference. Capas is the high priest. This is in John chapter 11. The Bible said, "Be in the high priest the same year." Verse 49, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation. Think of that. Keeps the one that he wasn't a believer. He crucified &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ yet prophesied under the spirit. Look at the disciples at Ephesus. He says, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" They had believed. They had the word but had not received them dwell in full fullness. They had they had faith and perhaps a measure of the spirit, but not the baptism or the infilling of it. They had heard anointed preachers preach. John the Baptist was anointed of the spirit of God &gt;&gt; but not yet filled. &gt;&gt; Peter got revelation but wasn't converted. Judas healed the sick by the power of God. &gt;&gt; Priest in his name, &gt;&gt; anointed by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Well, but then we don't want the anointing. Oh, yes. You just don't want it alone. &gt;&gt; You want to be filled with the spirit &gt;&gt; and have his anointing &gt;&gt; because if you're truly sealed with the spirit, you can't deny his anointing. That's why when you hear them speaking against anointed preachers today and oh don't don't preach anymore just play tapes. You know that ain't the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; cuz he cannot deny his own word. &gt;&gt; Men did not set up preachers in this in this message. God ordained them. &gt;&gt; And men can't tell us to sit down. That's right. &gt;&gt; And you cannot by the spirit of God say such a thing &gt;&gt; because to do it is deny the word. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. [snorts] Jesus is the sweetest name I know. And he's just the [music] same as his [music] lovely name. And that's the reason why I love him so [music] [music] the sweetest day I sing it one more time now. Oh [music] my Jesus, the sweetest name I know. And he's just the same as [music] his lovely day. And [music and singing] that's the reason why I love [music] him so far is the sweetest [music] name I know. Just raise your hands to me and sing it again. Well, [singing] my Jesus is the sweetest [music] name I know. &gt;&gt; Oh, let him be real to your heart today. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's the same as [singing] his [music] lovely name. And that's [singing] the reason [music] why I love him so far. [singing] [music] Jesus is the sweetest I know. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; How many [music] are sealed with the spirit today? But you'd say, "I'd like to have a refreshing from the presence of the Lord." Till the sunlight of God just burst through upon my soul. The angels [music] come and strengthen me. You've been through temptation and [music] trials. Even Jesus needed strengthening after [music] his great hour of temptation. You needed his Holy Spirit, the angel of his presence, just to come down over you and to strengthen you until you're so in love with Jesus again. Till the things of this world just grow strangely dim, till it all fades [music] away until you see Jesus only. Just invite him today and say, "Lord, I don't ask for a special way [music] for you to do it. Maybe just to scream or to shout or to dance or have some display of great emotion, but just in the simplest of the spirit. Lord, I've been through a battle. There's been a battle in my mind. There's been an overclouding of the spirit of the enemy. It's come. It's not you. It's not you. It's the devil. It's your enemy want you to give in. But you can say by the word today, it's written. Your question whether you're a son or a daughter of God, the devil comes and tempts you soar and tries to make you doubt. And God's here to reassure you. I could never forget you. Your names is engraved in the palms of my hand. I have come to give you a hope and a future, an expected end. Why don't you just be refreshed in his presence this morning until Jesus means everything? As I said, till the world fades away and the sweetness of his presence lifts you up out of that darkness into his presence. And because in [music] his presence is the fullness of joy. Oh, just invite him to your pew today. Maybe if you're not a Christian, today would be a moment you could just say, "I want to know that lovely Lord Jesus. I want him to take away my sins. I've been wrong. [music] I've lived wrong, but I'd like to have him in my life. I want to be anointed with him. I want to have the joy of the Lord. I've I've experienced the depths of Satan in my life. I've been taken down to a dark pit. But today I hear a word that there is a promise given in the last day where the Holy Spirit is seeking those whose hearts are turned toward him who want to change and they say, "Lord, come with the seal of the living God and change my heart in your presence. [music] Make it real to me." Maybe you want to raise a hand to God and say, "Lord, that's me. I want the seal of the living God. I want it in my heart. I want it in my life. I want it in my forehead. I want a [music] new thinking. I want my mind on you." Because that's where real [music] peace is. Is when our mind is stayed on Christ. Where we're centered on Jesus. Where everything else fades. and we see him and that's the [snorts] reason why I love him so for Jesus is the [music] sweetest day I know it is no [singing and music] secret what God [music] can do. What he's done [music] [singing] for us, he'll [singing] do for you. Oh, with arms wide open [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; he call you. &gt;&gt; It is [singing] [music] what God can do. Hannah, we're singing this for Hannah now. It is no [music] secret. [singing] &gt;&gt; What God can do. Can you sing that for Hannah? &gt;&gt; What he's done for [singing and music] us. &gt;&gt; What he's done for you, &gt;&gt; for [music and singing] he'll do for you. And with arms wide open, [singing] &gt;&gt; he know your sins [music] were scarlet. They'll be white as snow. &gt;&gt; Though they were red lights, cursing, they'll be white as [music] far as the east is. From the west, I'll remove your sins from you. This is his [music] promise. I won't make you fight this battle alone. I'll go with you. I'll be even in you to the end of the world. How does it start? [music] Repentance. A change of heart. Coming to God humbly. Say, [music] "Lord, I need you. Save me. I can't save myself. I can't deliver myself. I got myself in a heap of trouble. But oh God, only you can get me out of it. That's why I need a [music] savior. And he came to save people just like you. He didn't come to call the righteous to [music] repentance, but he come to call the sinner, the ungodly. Those that realize, I need a savior. You swam along for a long time thinking you could do this on your own. You couldn't. [music] You were drowning, but you've been calling out, "I need a savior. Help me. I perish." We're throwing out a lifeline to her this morning. We're believing God for a change in her life. That this is a day of change, a transformation. It won't be a time of just a visitation of the spirit, but where the spirit will come to indwell to abide with [music] her forever as she comes. Let's sing that again for Hannah.

We're coming to bring this child of God here today to be immersed in water. And you know, here's the thing. You know, John the Baptist declared, you know, that I, you know, I baptize you with water, but he that comes after me, he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. And so, this is the promise of the scripture that we fulfill him, the fulfill the word. We're baptized in his name. We take on his name, identify ourselves with him, then he comes and gives us the Holy Ghost. You see this is is the first steps of salvation is is is us accepting Christ. But when he comes as the Holy Spirit, it's him accepting you. And so here today as we know that you cannot come unless the father draws. And God has drawn God's been moving on her life dealing with her heart. And she has come with a surrendered heart to God. Yes, she was baptized before we know. But you know, she was blessed by the spirit of God and been anointed by the spirit of God. But you know, today she wants more than an anointing. &gt;&gt; She wants the filling of the spirit of God. So today, Hannah, I come as a servant of Christ. And the Lord Jesus sent me to preach the gospel. And he commissioned me to baptize those that believe. For he said to go into all the world and to preach the gospel and baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Now, in obedience to that divine command, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you, Lord. [applause] Praise the Lord. [music] Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [singing] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. [music] &gt;&gt; Praise [singing] God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today. We have a couple announcements [music] before we go. We have need some help moving some things back from the fellowship hall tables [music] and such. So, if you could some of you, especially young fellas, could help with that, we sure appreciate it. [music] Also, coming up very quickly is our fall festival behind.
