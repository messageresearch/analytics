the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent amen let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just thankful for this opportunity to gather together with this group of young people and and those that have gathered to support Lord not just pray that you'll come and that you'll speak and that you'll just help us Lord not to necessarily just look at some slides and read some things but Lord I pray that you'll just unveil yourself to to Hearts tonight Lord and that you'll just show us father and allow us to see them even the mistakes not just the glories of the past but the mistakes of the past so that we Lord won't make those same mistakes I pray you'll just come now and move and speak to hearts in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen you can have your seats it's good to be with you all again for another church age study we're going to be looking tonight at the chapter three not all of chapter three because it is a quite a long chapter and I just had you to read um half of the chapter and yet still that half was longer than most of the other chapters that we have done and so we're looking at chapter three the Ephesian age now this age is is important to us because we we point back to it so often because that's where the the church began there on the day of Pentecost so this is the age of Paul and the age of Peter the age of Stephen the age of the Apostles this is that First Apostolic age and brother Branham begins to talk and he as he begins to to look at this he says that I sought God for many days for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit he says then only did I read the scriptures on the church ages and delve into the many Church histories and as I read this I thought that this was an awesome thing because if we go back to early one of our first studies he tells us how that you can never pray too much for Revelation he tells us you know that you should always be praying for Revelation seeking and it encourages my heart when I see the prophet of God that he does exactly what he tells us to do he doesn't just take it upon himself and think well I'll be able to read through this and understand these things but he begins to seek God for Revelation and I want to remind or remind you and encourage you again not to just come to church services and just think you know I'm just going to sit there and the preacher is going to say some good things and we're going to enjoy it but come seeking Revelation come seeking more from God and and not just a head knowledge but come seeking that God will reveal himself to your heart amen and he says he says I was enabled by the Holy Spirit to see unfolded a pattern so as you go through the church age book it's not just brother Branham studying histories and look we could all go study histories and I promise you we wouldn't have been able to come up and write the church age book but what it is is there was things revealed to him the Holy Spirit allowed him to see a pattern that that unfolded and I say Lord reveal yourself to me tonight open yourself up to me tonight and he says that he was able to find a key he says that the lord gave him a key by which to discover the messengers for each age because if you think about it there were a lot of Great Men of God in every age there was great Ministries I mean even in Paul's day even though it's very clear by the scripture there were a lot of powerful Ministries it's very clear that Paul is is the messenger but you could look at it as a man and go well this ministry was just as powerful in this ministry and and down through the different ages there were always very powerful God called God anointed ministers but brother that Branham says I was given a key to by which I could tell and discover the messengers of the age and that key is the scripture that it's at the very core of everything we believe tonight as message Believers Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said it is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is in other words what he did at the very very first he's going to keep doing all the way until the last time if he ever did it one way God Don't Make Mistakes so if he ever did it one way he's going to keep doing it until it is done for the last time and so what brother Branham realizes through Revelation is the kind of man that God chose in the very first age which is what we're studying the Ephesian age and how he operated and manifested through that Ministry he says will be how God does it in every age so once he receives who the messenger is in the first age and how God manifests himself in that messenger that's how God's going to operate in every messenger down through every age amen he says the word can't change or be changed because the word is God he says thus what the church was at Pentecost now look as you go through the church age book hopefully you're starting to recognize why we preach what we preach hopefully you're starting to see oh this isn't brother Tim's opinion or brother Aaron her brother Joe's opinion these things are coming right out of the message this is this is the message of the hour as you read this and and what you're going to find is I know even myself as I go through it is that a lot of the quotes that you hear every Sunday and every Wednesday come out of the church age book you're reading that you're going yep I've heard that before yep I've heard that before yep I've heard that before and that's all in here he says thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that's not a Tim Pruitt Doctrine all right we find that right here what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church age closes that's why we preach the New Birth the way we do church that's why we preach you have to be born again because if we preach anything else we're taken away from the pattern we have to preach it the way we preach it we can't take away from the word we're commanded in revelation 22 18. it says for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book so in other words we have no choice but to preach it the exact same way it was preached on the day of Pentecost we have no choice but to preach it that way because if God ever did it that way he still does it that way today he says the promise of power which with the apostles were endowed at Pentecost is to you that's Jews and to your children that's Jews and to all that are far off Gentiles that's where we come into it to as many as the Lord Our God shall call both Jews and Gentiles and he says this until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease let that settle in tonight because there's going to be people that tell you that's for a day gone by that's for another age brother Branham says the Pentecostal message and power will not cease so I can tell you tonight that he still heals the same way he still delivers the same way he still fills with the Holy Ghost the same way he still operates within the body the same way as he did at Pentecost because that is the standard amen he says you he he says what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right he says originally she had the pure word of God now a lot of people want to stop right there it's back to the word back to the word I couldn't agree more with you he says it was the pure word of God originally she he says she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse times and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost Church it is your right to have gifts operate in an evening like Tabernacle it is your right to have the spirit moving in our services those things that other people say well I'm not so sure about I don't know if we need that I'm telling you that it is your right to have those things it is your right to have an experience at the altar in your seat where the Holy Ghost sweeps down and fills your life and changes you forever it's not an option it's not something somebody can tell you you can't have it is your right and I'm telling you especially as Americans we ought to know what it's like to fight for our rights there's people telling you you don't have to have it that has gone by and I say we're not going to stand for it it's my right I'm going to fight for it Whatever It Takes listen you're going to come sometimes on a Wednesday or sometimes on a Sunday and it's not going to be easy but you're gonna have to fight for it I have a right to the spirit moving tonight I have a right to be touched by the Holy Ghost I have a right to be refilled tonight and it's something that you have to be willing to fight for amen I believe that we're a church that that has experienced it but I want to warn us not to take it for granted not to let it become common to you don't just let it be we're going to evening like Tabernacle again and maybe we'll have a good time you gotta it should be so precious to you it's something that you come and you want to fight for and and fight for it for for your generation other Generations have experienced it we've experienced it but will you continue to fight for it will you continue to stand for it to where we don't let it slip away because what we'll find as we go on is it's so easy to let these things slip away the pattern he says that is how it is done the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost he makes it to where it is an actual effort the true church will try to be like the original at Pentecost he says the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one so if you're putting off on those things and you don't want to see those things I would never say this but I say when I read that if you're not trying to be like that original Pentecost you're not the true church the true church will sometimes the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost now going a little further because we're getting now to talk about The Messengers he says and The Messengers to the churches having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul now he tells us they won't be carbon copies they're not going to be somebody that's walking around just trying to imitate him but it's because it's the same spirit of God in them back to the church it's not that we're trying to manufacture why are we like the church at Pentecost because it's the same spirit that fell there and moved in that first age that's moving once again unhindered in this age he says all the Ministries are Mighty gifts in an age he looks through and he says all the all the different Ministries all the mighty gifts and age the Messenger will be the one most like Paul in other words it's not going to be a carbon copy but this is back to the key that he found how does he know which one which messenger which Ministry is the messenger and he'll look and he'll compare and the one that comes out most like Paul free from denomination um sold out pure word manifestations of the power of the Holy Spirit the mess the ministry that fits this mold is the one that's going to be the messenger of the age and he says as the light begets light the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost listen I've gotten to the point where it's not something that we have to debate with people anymore it's not up for argument it's just right there the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first age he says it's that simple and that wonderful and that's why it tells us that if the vine were to ever put forth another Branch it will write another book of Acts because it's just like the founders there at Pentecost we don't have to work it up nor should we ever we should never work something up our worship should be from the depths of sincerity if we come out of our seek to worship it's because there was something within us that we could no longer stay there it was something that that pulled us out bubbled us if we dance it shouldn't be just because everybody's dancing it's because something on the inside of you begins to dance and you can't contain yourself it's a true worship it's it's not a workup we don't have to work it up but if we see ourselves falling short of what they have if we look at what we are and compare it to what they are and we see that we don't measure up or that we're falling short to where how the spirit moved there it's not moving here we have to be willing to take account and say why we have to be willing to measure ourselves against the standard against the pattern every Church and maybe we won't be carbon copies but we have to be willing to put ourselves up against the the pattern and it's and it's important it's very important that we're able to recognize who the true church is and able to recognize the true word because there is a false that's going to be a theme as we go forward in in every Church age from this point forward there is a true church and there is a false there is a True Vine and there is a false and so it is important that we know what the pattern is that way we could compare that way we can determine what is the false Vine we know there's two Vines it tells us in Matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall Grow Show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now sometimes I can remember even as a kid and sometimes even in sermons how how this comes across almost as a scary scripture it comes across almost as a oh be careful it's so close be careful it's so close but I don't see it as a scary scripture at all this is one of the most uplifting scriptures that I can find anywhere in the Bible because it tells me that no matter what I will not be deceived no matter how bad things get no matter how difficult no matter the situation no matter the false doctrines no matter what I'm told no matter what people try to say the elect will not be deceived and tonight I did I identify as the elect I'm not going to put myself somewhere so I know I'm gonna make it I'm not going to be deceived my soul is not going to be led astray this is an uplifting and wonderful verse in the Bible you're gonna make it you're not gonna be deceived you're not going to fall short you are the elect God put that seed on the inside of you man didn't do it man can't take it away Satan didn't do it he has no right to it you are going to overcome because it's him his seed on the inside of you being drawn back to him he says there is a true church and a false Church there is a True Vine and a false Vine but of course that false Church false Vine body will always try to assert the position of the true church and contend that she and not the elect are the real and authentic the false will try to kill the truth the false has been trying to take that position and stomp out the True Vine from the very beginning you can find it right there in the Book of Genesis but I'd like to tell the devil we're still standing we're still here and he can try whatever but what I know is the elect shall not be deceived we see the two Vines throughout the scripture like I said even from the very beginning we see two trees in the garden one brings life and one brings death two children Cain and Abel both worship both bring sacrifices listen to this he says and the Lord had respect unto Abel unto his offering but unto Cain into his offering he had not respect now this is one thing and we'll deal with Cain and Abel a lot as we go forward in the church ages but just to hit on a point that we've already mentioned brother Branham says that Abel knew what to offer and what to sacrifice because of what does anybody know revelation we need Revelation Even in our worship we need Revelation in everything Cain is rejected here in this sense because he doesn't have the revelation God even tells him don't you know if you'll do what your brother in other words you did it wrong because you didn't have Revelation it is important that we seek Revelation brother Bradham says here one was the elect of God and the other was reprobate both worshiped God in every single case there was worship of God involved he's talking about the two Vines he's talking about the twins down through through the Bible the worship of God involved in every case the evil hated the righteous and persecuted the righteous in some cases the evil destroyed the righteous but notice they were planted together they lived together they both made claims upon God and worshiped God we see twins of Isaac and Rebecca Jacob and Esau let me tell you one way to tell the difference in the true and the false the true will never despise the birthright Esau despised the birthright but Jacob believed in the birthright let me tell you this ain't exactly the same angle but I'm gonna tell you this the true do not despise our inalienable right to Pentecost we do not despise those rights we believe in those rights and we fight for those rights but the Esau's just as they despise the birthright despise the fact that we stand for those rights that seed despise the fact that we still believe and fight for the for those rights in our lives but the vines are planted together they grow together and for many for a long time especially when they're young they look identical they can grow together and early on it's hard to tell the difference it's hard to tell you know I was having a conversation with the brother today about he was asking me about another brother and his testimony and I said I I don't know us I'm not inside the brother's heart I said in reality do any of us really know outside of us I I I know that y'all are wonderful people I know that you come to church I believe every one of you is going to be saved Ah that's how I choose to believe I don't ever believe to or preach to you like I think you're going to hell I believe but but but you are the only one that knows you're the only one only one you're ahead on your pill at night you may fool mommy and daddy you make you know exactly where you at and this kind of went sideways for just a second but let's stay there for just a second we're at that we're at the end time I know right now we're starting on the very first church age but this ain't where we're living we're living at the end of the end at the very end of laodicea and then I I was listening to a minister today saying people keep asking me what has to happen before God for Jesus can come back and he said absolutely nothing he said he can come back right now he can come back before this service is dismissed I don't believe any of your tears I believe you're all weak but what I'm saying is right now you know where you're at you know that if if Jesus were to come during this service whether or not you'd be sitting on the Pew when we were all gone or not hold that in your heart as we continue you know where you're at I believe you're wheat but you know where you're at in your relationship the wheat and the tares he says another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened into a man which sowed good seed in his field now remember what we're dealing with here we're talking about two Vines two seeds growing up together from the very beginning we saw it with Cain and Abel he says but while men slept well he says the Kingdom of Heaven is likened into a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sow tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also notice God didn't plant the tears it says Satan planted those tares right Among The Good Seed of God the two kinds of plants and in parentheses brother Branham says people two kinds of plants people from two different seeds grew up together and I just want to emphasize again this is something that we're going to study more and more as we go down through the church ages the two seeds side by side growing up together the true church and the Falls Church are intertwined especially early on as it comes to maturity the differences become more and more plain but early on it's so intertwined it's hard to tell one from the other which is true which is false planted together but of different seeds we turn now and began to look at how is it that God began to deal with the Gentiles we know that that God's chosen people all down through the Bible were the Jews and at some point though it turns to the Gentiles as he begins looking into the church ages the seven churches that we deal with are all in Asia Minor and he does not speak there's another church there's many other churches but the biggest major church is in Jerusalem but the reason he doesn't speak to that church is because it's made up mostly of Jews and at this point the gospel has turned from the Jews and it has turned to the Gentiles so the church there at Jerusalem isn't even addressed he says the reason for this is that God has turned from the Jews to the Gentiles thus the whole of the church ages the entire book of the church is that from from when it starts all the way till now God is dealing with the Gentiles and calling out a gentile Bride for himself that is something that we can rejoice in because had he not turned from the Jews had he not turned to us what chance would we have but he said I'm going to have a gentile Bride for my name's sake and I'm so thankful that he called my name I'm so thankful that he called your name he says that makes the church ages and the term the fullness of the Gentiles one and the same thing so these ages and these churches that we're talking about these are Gentile churches acts 13 and 45 says but when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with Envy so the Jews see the multitudes of of Gentiles and they're filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming then Paul and Barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should have first been spoken to you he's talking to the Jews first been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles in other words the Jews had opportunity at it Jesus came to the Jews the word himself made flesh came to the Jews and they crucified it and he says you didn't want it so now we're going to give others an opportunity I'm so thankful tonight listen others may want to throw this aside others may not want the message of the eye where others may not want the Holy Ghost I say I'll take it I'm so thankful I have the opportunity at it when others turn it down God doesn't just give up he doesn't just say oh well I guess anywhere he said I'll find somebody somebody will accept it somebody will take this word somebody will be born again verse 47 he says for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad that's us when the Gentiles heard this they were glad come on somebody we got to get glad tonight about this and glorify the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed so the gospel has turned to the Gentiles and these are the Gentile Church ages brother Branham teaches us about the characteristics of the ages and he says here at these seven churches located in Asia Minor contained certain characteristics within them at that ancient date which became mature fruit of later ages so these characteristics if it becomes mature fruit later we can conclude that these characteristics are seeds they are seeds that are become mature fruit later they were just little things maybe hard for most historians maybe didn't pick it up most of us as we read through maybe didn't pick it up but a prophet seeking Revelation reads these things and he sees these little seeds and he recognized what these characteristics are and what it's going to become so these little things these little seeds these little characteristics they're so small but hundreds and even thousands of years later when that age that that church had represented comes into fruition then those seeds become manifested as fruits of that age the seeds in other words would come to harvest we know and brother Brown tells us that the messenger of the Ephesian age that we're studying is the Apostle Paul he says Paul founded the church at Ephesus about the middle of the first century this enables us to set the date of the beginning of the Ephesian Church age about 53 A.D he says he was the prophet Messenger to the Gentiles his prophetic office by which he received the full revelation of the word for the Gentiles authenticated him as the apostolic messenger and just as we said that the the first age was the pattern or Pentecost was the pattern for all other ages so was Paul the the first messenger the pattern for all other Messengers but it goes beyond that brother Branham says that Paul is the pattern for every God called Minister he says every God called Minister should be patterned after Paul amen so we're looking here at Paul and if we're going to pattern after Paul if we should know what a god-called Ministry is like we're going to look at what Paul's was like and he says Paul's Ministry had a three-fold quality he says first he was true to the word he was not tied to organization not sent by the Council of Jerusalem not afraid to stand up to the religious leaders and as I read that I say you could have just easily described brother Branham right there he wasn't afraid to stand up to the organizations of the day he didn't matter if it cost him we heard the other day how how he was offered one and a half million dollars one time for one healing think about the kingdom he could have had think about the money he could have had the planes the Jets the churches and yet he lived a humble life why because he was A God Called Ministry amen Galatians 1 and 8 describe this is Paul now says but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed I'd say he wasn't afraid to stand up to other people he says not only is what I'm telling you the truth if you preach anything different you're going to be accursed that's why we got to preach it just like it was at Pentecost I ain't trying to be accursed I'm going to preach it just like they preached it in the first stage I don't care what you can show me what you think's a better idea he said preach it like I preached it exactly like I did first Corinthians 14 36 says what came the word of God out from you now these people are challenging Paul and so I don't know in terms maybe young people might understand he's almost talking trash to him a little bit he's like oh what are you the messenger no I didn't think so I'm the messenger he says what did the word of God come out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord he was bold sometimes we listen to to brother Bradham because it's something we understand it's more in our language it's not old English and sometimes we're like ouch that was harsh ouch that was bold and Paul's standing in here telling people y'all shut up and sit down I'm telling I'm laying it down here you just agree with me or be accursed you talk about boldness Galatians 1 1 Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead in other words I am an apostle I am telling you I'm an apostle he wasn't afraid to stand up he wasn't tied to organization or the council at Jerusalem second his ministry was in the power of the spirit when Ministry is in the power of the spirit it brings about a demonstration and not just a telling now hear that when a Ministry has the power of the spirit it doesn't just tell you about things but there is a demonstration remember it is the pattern of all true ministers his ministry was in the power of the spirit acts 14 Lamer healed Acts 20 the dead are raised acts 28 all diseases are healed second Corinthians 12 12 says truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patients in signs and wonders and mighty deeds and this is the pattern of all God called Ministry so how then will a Ministry stand up and say these things are no longer needed or no longer applicable you are disqualifying yourself I don't have to do it you're doing it you're going me right here I'm not God called you're doing it yourself when you lay these things aside First Corinthians 2 1-5 and I Brethren when I came unto you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I am determined not to know anything among you in other words he's not there to try to blow your mind with fancy words and fancy doctrines and and make things sound right and just fit just perfect he says save Jesus Christ and him crucified I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power that your face should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God this is the pattern this is the pattern why do you all preach on this so much why do you harp on this so much we're not we're just lining up to the pattern we're just doing exactly what Paul said to do what the word said to do amen and finally evident fruits First Corinthians 9 and 1. am I not an apostle Here We Go Again think of all the things that has happened in his ministry am I not an apostle am I not free have I not seen Jesus Christ Our Lord are not ye my work in the Lord if I be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless I am to you for the Seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord now what I want you to understand from this real quick young people is it is not uncommon for the messenger of the age to come under attack oh but they're saying this about brother Brown and and they found this and they said this right here and they said and half the scriptures I've read as Paul having to defend himself because people are attacking him and saying he's false that ain't real he's not really that he's not really a messenger he's not really an apostle and he's constantly coming under attack he's under reproached false Brethren or questioning his apostleship says and we're very industrious to lessen his character and sink his reputation particularly here at Corinth a place to which he had been instrumental in doing so much good some among the Corinthians questioned if they did not disown his apostolical character here at Corinth where he's done so much they've seen so much and they're trying to ruin him they're trying to to disown him and trying to ruin his character and he says am I not an apostle am I not free he says it was Paul's Ministry to that age that was preparing these people to be presented to Christ it was by his ministry that so many Gentiles had come to know the Lord and been added to the kingdom he's saying are you not my work in the Lord he says the Seal of my apostleship is that you even know the Lord and here they are attacking don't think it's strange when people attack the messenger of this day it's what's been happening it's the pattern from the very first age they're always finding something wrong they're always finding something to point to but these converts here that he's pointing to are the evident fruit he's saying you are the Seal of my apostleship fruits of his ministry he said Paul had been the means of bringing in multitudes of the Gentile sheep he fed them and cared for them until they brought forth righteous fruit and were prepared to meet the Lord as a part of the Gentile bride then we get to this city of Ephesus there's actually some very um very neat looking for lack of better word ruins that are left behind at the city of Ephesus these are just a couple small pictures and it was it was considered one of the greatest cities of all of Asia all of Asia full of wealth full of influence very prominent in the early church it was I actually often referred to as the third city of the Christian faith with the first being Jerusalem the the second being Antioch and then the third being Ephesus Paul would actually Pastor here for three years he spent three years of his life pastoring here at Ephesus and now as we get into this some of the things that that we know but things that we need to take to heart because this age is the age that mirrors our age in so many ways the meaning of Ephesus is aimed at and relaxed he says the high and aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of God whereby they were aiming at the High Calling of God began to give way to a less watchful attitude remember young people this is the age of the upper room we talk about this all the time oh Upper Room experience Upper Room experience The Upper Room the the apostles and here this is the age of Paul Peter Stephen and they're beginning to drift no not Paul Peter and Stephen but the age that they were in the age that they were in slowly it begins to drift and we can never let that be our testimony never let that be your Testament where are you at tonight where are you at in your experience or are you still there with the same fire that you had when you met the Lord do you have the same fire right now as you had on say Saturday night at Youth Camp let's just go back that far is that the same firefits if it's not it's time to check up right now don't slide too far don't relax too much too many times we drift too far and relax too much and then we got a war to get back through to get to where we were but if we'll be willing to admit tonight maybe I've taken a step in the wrong direction maybe I've slid a little bit maybe I'm not where I'm supposed to be maybe it's not burning in me right now like it was when I was in that prayer line come on Church you can't live in a prayer line you know I'm all for it but it's time that we take some of the fire and some of the things we get in those services and it goes with us on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and do it all the way through a calendar year it's time to that it's not just that you can't experience or an altar experience you know I love those things but it's time to take those things into every day overcoming life where are you at this age was aimed at and relaxed they had so much fervor listen this youth group this youth group has been one of the most full of fervor and fire youth groups we've ever had you have set this church on fire you have turned it on its ear we love you but there is no age that was on fire like Ephesus there was no age that experienced things like the upper room but things began to slip in what will be the testimony of this youth group five years from tonight what will be the testimony of this youth group 10 years from tonight because that's what happens when little things begin to come in I'm not even talking about you're going out into full-blown sin or leaving the church I'm talking about the little things the little seeds that eventually have a harvest things began to slip in little ideas listen you got to guard the door guard the door of your heart guard the door of your mind guard the door of your eyes those things are seeds that will have a harvest you feed on the things of Hollywood long enough your mind begins to think I was just talking to this lady that cuts my hair the other day and she was talking about how things have gotten so crazy and she said it's so crazy because things have become normal that just 10 years ago were insane and the thing is that first time you watch something you shouldn't you know you shouldn't and it's almost hard to get through it but then the next time you do something you're not supposed to it gets a little easier and the next time it gets a little easier you use those words you shouldn't use and say things you shouldn't say and at first you know but after a while it gets easier and easier to wear the things that 10 years ago you would have never done become normal guard the door don't let the little things in because it was in these little things that the Antichrist came in shapeless not fully manifested not openly but in small seeds and attitudes we talked about how each City had characteristics characteristics that that would show how the age would go we spoke about the characteristics of the city and how they were seeds and how they foreshadowed a later Harvest so brother Branham goes into great detail breaking down how the Pagan worship at the Temple of Diana symbolized and showed forth what would happen in the age so we kind of got this in stages the the priest of the Temple of Diana were eunuchs they were incapable of reproducing life and brother Branham says this symbolized how when you get away from the word you begin to drift from the word that you have become barren he says that he says there was virgin Priestess who performed the religious Acts of the temple he says this showed forth the day that ceremony and form and ritual and works would take the place of the Holy Spirit and no longer would charismatic manifestations fill the temple of God we are to want charismatic manifestations to fill the temple of God he said this is just a sign he says when you depart from the word going back to the eunuchs you depart from life when you depart from the word many times we find we find it to where when it's when it's all about the lip Services word word word word word and how long has it been since you had a baptism or somebody born again or some when you depart from the word you depart from new births you depart from Life coming out Beyond this he says the high priest was a man of political power and although not fully manifested yet this showed that the church very soon would no longer be under the leadership of the Holy Ghost but would soon be ruled over and led by man and then there were Temple slaves no choice but to do exactly what they're told and that's okay if you're a slave to the Holy Spirit but these weren't slaves to that these were slaves to man and what this represented was the laity the people in the congregation no longer having a say but being ruled over by a clergy no longer served by the church but serving the church no longer led by the spirit but the laity were Bound by Creeds Bound by tradition and in so doing it bound up their worship what started as the age of the upper room aimed at higher high aspirations we're going to take a Rapture those of us who are alive and remain aimed at and relaxed and the next step slaves slaves to Creed slaves to Dogma slaves to denomination no life no freedom aimed at But realize Church we've been set free young person if you've ever been set free from an addiction or you've ever been set free from a spirit or you've ever had an experience with God don't ever go back to the slavery that you were set free from listen we've come to a place where we've been pulled out of denominations as a church and we're no longer bound by that don't don't ever allow our worship and our thinking to go back into a denominational box don't ever allow yourself to go back beyond your last experience that's why we say drive down a stake listen I was I was telling somebody the other day there are times I know where young people haven't experience and they feel like in their testimony is I got it I got it but then somewhere along the way they realize they might not have got what they thought they'd got and the devil says see you didn't get nothing that is a lie that is a lie maybe you didn't get what you thought you got but don't ever let him Rob from you the fact that you had an experience that God did something from you don't go back beyond that point say okay maybe that wasn't it but I'm gonna build on this experience and I'm going to go from experience to experience to experience never go back Beyond or behind the last place God met you don't ever let him talk you out of something that God did for you maybe just because you didn't get what you thought you did maybe you stumbled maybe you're like you know for sure I couldn't have got it that's fine but don't let him say see it was just emotion see it was nothing no God did something for you now build on what God did take another step seek more of God and grow and grow more and more and mature and quit backing off what God has done for you in your life don't ever relax Revelation 2 and 1. the heading here was Jesus in the church ages it says these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks now if you'll remember we talked about what the seven golden candlesticks were they were the seven churches and so that's why this scripture here is so important because once again it shows us that he will never leave us and never forsake us it didn't show him in the midst of the first three candlesticks it didn't show him in the first couple of churches it shows him in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks in other words he's still here tonight he's still moving he hasn't left us he hasn't forsaken us it may be getting dark we may be in the seventh Church age but the scripture plainly shows him in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks you don't have to be afraid tonight he's still here he's still moving the god of Miracles you don't have to look back to find the god of Miracles I'm telling you the god of Miracles is still here tonight the god that heals is still here tonight the god that will save you and fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't got to look back he's still here tonight we see him in the word walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks what he was in the first age he is in all ages because he is in the midst and it's not and notice it's not him and somebody it's not Jesus and the Pope it's not Jesus and a preacher it's not even Jesus and a word prophet it's Jesus he alone died for you he alone can save you he alone deserves your worship listen after what he's done for you and he's fought for you and he's still standing you for this age how dare us give our worship to some movie star how dare us give our worship to some ball star or something like that listen I'm not against that you want a love ball I've always loved Ball but that ain't where our worship goes that ain't where our heart goes that ain't where our desires and our affections go our desires and our affections are to him he's the one standing for us in the last day he's the one still fighting for you he's the one pulling on your heart tonight because he's not back in Ephesus he's not back at Azusa Street he's here right now in the midst of the church he alone deserves Our Praise Seven Stars in his right hand we covered some of this before but we know that these are the seven Messengers but showing that he they're in his right hand is showing a symbol of power and Authority the very power and authority of God are with the messengers of each age I believe that we can say that we have witnessed that in in this generation we can hear it on tape as night after night the messenger would come forth and not make himself known but he would make God known to the people night after night he didn't build something for himself but he pointed people back to Christ he pointed to you that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever he pointed to you that Jesus is a living God he pointed to you that Jesus is coming again he moved in the power and the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ he held out the word of Truth and God came night after night and backed it up that's the same thing that happens here it's the same thing that happens in all God called Ministries they hold forth the truth and God comes behind it and backs it up why do miracles happen why do these things happen God's coming down behind the truth and backing it up saying that's true what they said is true this is the truth I'm still alive I'm still here I'm still in the midst of the churches and he still moves that way we don't have to look back he's still here he's here now and in this very hour he's walking in the midst of the last ages golden candlestick he says what he was as he walked in the first age he is even now in this last stage Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm so grateful for that don't ever let that become a slogan you know there's many times as many times that we don't understand how things turn out you know there's many times that we maybe we pray for people and they go by the way of the grave but I was just thinking this was just on my heart the other day I said you know we believe for so much more than other people believe for we believe so far beyond for things that other people don't even attempt to believe for and I said sometimes in that now we're never disappointed we're never left ashamed we've heard that we're never ashamed to be Believers but sometimes in that people you pray for go by the way of the Grave or people you pray for but but I said look at all the things we get because of the things we believe for sometimes we look at the well this one died and that one died I want to say but look at this one that was healed and look at this when that was saved and this one that if we hadn't held on for if we hadn't believed four but he's the same yesterday today and forever I still believe brother Brown said if I pray for ten thousand a day and they die tonight I'll pray for ten thousand tomorrow because it's his word he's the Healer he is the same and I say that we have not been left ashamed because of our testimony we have not been left ashamed because of what we believe for but we have gained great rewards because of what we have stood for in this day I say it's worth standing for though there's disappointments along the way you don't think there's disappointments for people that don't believe but think of the things we've won because of the high calling and the things we hold on to I believe it's worth it the seven golden candlesticks are to be made of pure gold we're likened here to pure gold I know sometimes we don't feel like pure gold but it's because our attributes are his attributes they're they're credited to us because our identity is found in him so we're found to be pure gold says in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God I want you to hear that again because it's talking about you the next time you don't feel like you're very much you feel like a failure and you don't know which way to turn which way to go he says in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God has spoken it I accept it tonight I accept what the word said about me tonight not only are we gold but according to Exodus 25 it says and thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the Candlestick be made uh oh these candlesticks are made by people taking the gold and they beat it and they beat it and it gets burned and they beat it till it gets all the draws out it's not going to be easy thing they don't just take a block of gold and all of a sudden it's a candlestick no it says it's a beaten work what is it this church has been hunted this church has been persecuted people have been in this bride have been killed and murdered down Through the Ages by the millions beaten and molded and made and as gold is malleable brother Branham says whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of God will bear her suffering for the Lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and a joy Forever by the trials and testings of this life listen to me you're going to get knocked down in life let's be real you probably haven't experienced hardly any of the disappointments and hardships of life that you're going to experience and Satan tells you I'm going to break you you're not going to make it make it and God's saying all the time you're just molding them you're just making them into the golden lampstands that you can't you can't break these young people you can't break this bride because they're not made of brass they're not going to break but they're malleable they're filled with the Holy Ghost they know who their God is and they they're going to stand and they're going to be made and they're going to be molded not broken take that in mind the next trial you get hit with no I know it's not easy to celebrate in a trial but if you can find purpose in the trial if you can recognize this is a molding this is a making then it makes it easier for you to get through that trial when you find purpose in it Revelations 2 2-3 Christ Praises his own we're going to start to bring this to an end as we're getting closer to the end here it says I Know Thy works and I labor and thy patience and how thou can'tst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not feigning young people many times the devil wants you to think that God's just a judge and every time you mess up and every time you fall he's just there to whip you and judge you until you're not good enough and the word says right here he notices the good that you've done he notices the fact that you overcame yesterday he saw the situation that you faced and you stood the test he's not just sitting there going yep you messed up here you messed up there no he's up there recording I see where you overcame here I see where you did a good work here I see where you stood the test here he's not he is like a proud parent right here and he's saying I see what you've done I see how you've stood and many times the devil wants to make it so hard for you to come back because you mess up you say this is all that God sees God ain't looking at that stand up repent and come back to God just get up from where you're at get up from where you're falling from it if you fall and you get discouraged don't stay down get up he's not sitting there keeping a tally of all your mistakes he says I know it's hard out there I've seen you stand I've seen you fight I've seen your victories he's not just keeping up with your defeats he's not just keeping up with your stumbles he's keeping a tally of all the times you've won amen that gave my heart such courage just repent and return he's not sitting there as just well you're so bad you're so he's going look at all the good you've done look at all the things that you have done he points out all the good things that they've done in the age persecution always has been a part of the church and the church always will be persecuted brother Brown says the children of this world controlled by the devil hate the children of God who are controlled by the spirit Cain persecuted Abel Esau hated Jacob Judas betrayed Jesus and the list goes on and on and on you can be the nicest guy in the world you can treat everybody with kindness you cannot have a blip on your life but let people find out that you believe in being filled with the Holy Ghost that you believe in signs and wonders and gifts and that your life surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ and see if there ain't some mocking and things that'll start to come your way see if little jokes and things and persecution won't begin to come your way in the world Listen we're sheltered sometimes from a lot of it because we live in What's called the Bible Belt and as crazy as the world is where we live you just don't even know just Drive West a little ways or drive to the Northeast a little ways you know it's getting to where just drive to Walmart it's getting pretty bad here too but it still ain't what it was there is real persecution against people who hold to the testimony he says let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy healing Miracles and he will be condemned the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God but trials always have been and they always will be maybe you've been persecuted maybe at school maybe you have a hard time holding your testimony amongst friends maybe you struggle maybe you feel like you can't keep going I don't know where all of y'all are at tonight but don't give up don't give in I know some days you feel like you've reached the breaking point sometimes you feel like I just can't take another step some days you feel like I'm just so sick of it all just get up and take another step just keep fighting just listen I promise you the reward is great the struggle may be hard but I promise you the reward is great and it's not that far away it's not listen we're at the end of the end just keep fighting another day one of these mornings one of these days your reward will be Eternal every struggle and every battle and every depression and every anxiety and everything that came and fought against you all those days you felt all alone will feel like nothing every fear you won't even remember them because the reward is going to be so great keep pressing the battle keep pressing the battle do not give up where you are so you're persecuted so you're in a trial remember you're being made into pure gold don't give up now we're so close we are so close I'm just telling you just to keep fighting and keep pushing the the reward is right at hand we're right there at it he says Thou cannot bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say their Apostles and are not and has found them Liars and I want to deal with something here for just a minute these people had come out of the world they had worked so hard and fought so hard for Truth Listen being a Christian in the first age was not an easy thing I'll just put like this Christianity was a very new religion this was a world where there was thousands upon thousands upon thousands of gods normal people had a God for everything they had a God for everything and here comes Paul saying no there is one God all your gods are false there is one God for everything listen Christians were a hated people because it wasn't just that they believed something different is that what they believed cast down everything everybody in the world believed it was not an easy time and these people had come out of the world and they had fought so hard for truth fought so hard for the life that they had they had endured so much it says Thou cannot bear them which are evil what's this saying they weren't about to let the world come in amongst them come on young people listen we shouldn't ostracize anybody who's struggling we shouldn't make anybody feel like an awful sinner but we got to have the courage look we fought too hard we've come too far we've got Godly homes we've got a Godly church we got Godly youth groups you ought to have enough backbone about you to say hey we don't talk like that here hey we're not going to listen to that kind of music you ought to have enough Christianity about you to be able to stand up and say we fought too hard and we've come too far we're not going to let that stuff come in here we're not going to allow that stuff in you got to be willing to say no not on my watch I've fought too hard to allow to come in Jesus Praises them for for these things and it says he says you have found talking about false Apostles now you have found them to be Liars how do they find these false Apostles to be Liars he's praising them for identifying false Apostles for being able to pick out the wolves in sheep's clothing as it were because what it is we're going back to the key at the very beginning of tonight's lesson what was the key Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and Paul had come and he had warmed and they recognized that what Paul preached was the truth what Paul preached was the Revelation what Paul was was the messenger and so what they did is they took that key the same key brother Brown told us about and they applaud it to the doctrines that were being taught they applaud it to these false Apostles they knew that the Revelation that God had given to Paul was the only revelation so if someone came preaching something different from Paul they said you're false that is false and that's not true you talk about boldness you know today we pet things and we got well we should draw our Circle bigger and fellowship and in that day they said you're Liars I'm not advocating that I'm just telling you what the pattern is they said you're Liars well that's because they got up and they were just preaching totally off no that's not what the word says matter of fact brother Branham and tells us that it was so subtle so close to exactly what Paul preached that they didn't see it coming in but they were willing to stand up and say y'all are liars stand for what the truth was he says they looked at these false prophets in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you therefore are false he says oh that sets my heart on fire that would set a lot of us offended but for brother Branham it set his heart on fire get back to the word oh wait I thought it was I don't know listen get back to the word it is not that you that really tries the apostles and the prophet and the teacher it's the word that tries them it's not for us to say well I think I don't necessarily agree and you know what he says just take it to the word if what they're preaching lines up with the word it's true but if it don't line up to the pattern they're Liars they're false or his brother Timothy was preaching that he said you traitors because we know what the pattern is anti-word is Antichrist he said already they were denying the word and setting up their own Creeds and philosophies instead of the word now we know that Jesus is the word so if your anti-word you're Antichrist if you argue with the word you're Antichrist he says these people are not blatantly deniers seed it starts real small the original trick of Satan in the garden he didn't come tell even though everything he told you is a lie no no he changed one word he says that in Ephesus it was just the same just a word added just a word taken away and the anti-word Antichrist Spirit began to flourish it's just a seed but it begins to grow a little more in every age a little more in every age until that Antichrist system eventually takes over complete control and and then it gets to a point toward the truth of the word is actually fought against by the false prophets just to see if I can bring it down tonight to your relationship but brother and it's just a small thing it's just a song it's just a this it's just a that it's just a it's just a it's just a seed but seeds hear me young people seeds will have a harvest I'll tell you there's not one person that is backslid away from God I'll bring it right here there's not one young person that used to be amongst us that has went out into the world that when they were sitting here at the age of 12 13 14 15 16 thought I'm gonna be a sinner I can't wait I want to get on the road to hell I want to be a druggie I want to get to the place where I can't even hold a job and I'm worthless and I'm no good and I'm reprobating promise you that ain't nobody's thought their thought is what's wrong with that song their thought is that's just Mom that's just brother Tim he's a little bit old-fashioned no that's the pattern and that seed in and of itself might not can do much but that seed has a harvest you will reap what you sow what's that mean most of us probably know but whatever seeds you throw in the garden that's what's coming out of your garden you sow righteousness you'll reap righteousness you sow Rebellion you'll reap Rebellion these things were small in Ephesus they come in unawares but this church Falls so far that in the Book of Revelation she's the cage of every unclean and hateful bird she falls that far because of seeds that come to harvest the name of Christ as we said a while ago it was a time of idolatry and there were so many gods and so many different things but the Lord commends them because they stood for the name of Christ he says there that you have stood and labored for my name they stood for the name he says these people weren't only giving lip service to that name all they did they did in the name these Ephesians were Christians they bore a name and that name was Christ who was the spirit of God within them and which was one of the threefold names of their lord they knew the power in that name they knew the righteousness of that name they bore the name so much until it became their identification and Antioch and they became known as Christians because they followed Christ now you don't get that name because you went to church on Wednesday they got that name because everything they did the way they lived the way they acted the way they conducted themselves was after the spirit of Christ and it became who they were and it was something that they bore and the Lord commends them for this because in this age as we said there's so many other gods there's so many other names but they were willing to Bear up the name of Christ they were willing to hold it up they were willing to say no we're Christians and they held up the name of Christ then we get to the the very end of the age or towards the end of the age here it says the complaint of God Revelation 2 4 nevertheless now he's listed all the good things but there isn't nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love when he says this he he's not necessarily speaking of the original Christians that they're at the very beginning of Ephesus but he's speaking to the entire age so all the generations that live within this 120 year age it's the exact same thing that we see all through the Old Testament as God would move in Israel and they would be on fire and they would repent and they would come back to God but then the next Generation would be a little less fervor than the Next Generation a little less fervor and then he said by the fourth generation the Revival fires would be nothing but a little bit of Embers they've left their first love that doesn't mean they're out sinning and doing awful things that means Jesus isn't coming first in their life I like to try to bring it down to things we can relate to there's more reals than scriptures more movies than messages whatever however I can get it to relate to you your first love has now been replaced by things of the world notice it doesn't even say they don't love Jesus I'm not saying you don't love the Lord I'm asking is he still your first love is he still your first love because that's what he had against the entire age you left your first love you left the one the the passion that you had for me the Zeal that you had for me when you left from Youth Camp and you said I'll never go back to that lukewarmness again the first love where is it he says I have somewhat against you he says the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for the reaching out and the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that Church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal it's the cycle of Revival and death and we've heard it many times from here the cycle of Revival and death has never failed until now the cycle of Revival and death has to fail because it's been Revival and death Revival and death Revival and death but we're coming to a place where it's Revival and rapture there's going to be a people willing to fight for their inalienable rights willing to say I have a right to that I have a right to what they had at Pentecost I have a right to what they had in the first age I have a right to a body change I have a right to a Rapture but you're gonna have to be willing to fight for it because what happened in the first age it wasn't something big they began to care what the world thought think about it they begin to care what the world thought instead of caring only what God thought and they began to cool off and to try to tame down their services young people we can't leave our first love it's the history of the church he says oh Ephesian Church something's happening to you take the take the word church out of it put your name there tonight put your name between the commas where it says Ephesian Church put your name Oh Aaron something is happening to you he says but they're doing it so subtly that you can't see it go back to Pentecost before it's too late go back to your first love before it's too late go back he says remember therefore for once Thou Art Fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove that Candlestick out of his place except thou repent God says remember where they are fallen in other words no is he didn't tell them you didn't

the glory of it I'll get back to the Wonder of it all repent before your light goes out he says don't hesitate he says the glory of God decreased ever so rapidly it was not long until the city was in Ruins its glorious Temple became a shapeless Mass the land became a marsh inhabited by waterfowl the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a squalid Village there was not even one Christian left think about this oh Peter James John the disciples the apostles the great there wasn't one Christian left because he said don't hesitate repent but apparently they hesitated will you
