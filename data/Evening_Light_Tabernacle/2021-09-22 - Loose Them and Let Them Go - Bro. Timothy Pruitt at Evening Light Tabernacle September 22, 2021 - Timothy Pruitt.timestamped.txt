[38:14] came to pass in process of time that the
[38:17] king of egypt died and the children of

[38:22] and they cried
[38:24] and their cry came up to god
[38:26] by the reason of the bondage
[38:28] and god heard their groaning and god
[38:31] remembered his covenant with abraham
[38:33] with isaac and jacob
[38:35] and god looked upon the children of
[38:37] israel and god had respect unto them
[38:41] now moses kept the flock of jethro his
[38:43] father-in-law the priest of medium
[38:46] and he led the flock to the back side of
[38:47] the desert and came to the mountain of
[38:49] god even to horeb and the angel of the
[38:52] lord appeared unto him in the flame of
[38:54] fire out of the midst of the bush and he
[38:55] looked and behold the bush burned with
[38:58] fire and the bush was not consumed
[39:01] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[39:04] see this great sight while the bush is
[39:06] not burnt
[39:07] and when the lord saw that he had turned
[39:09] aside the sea god called unto him out of
[39:11] the midst of the bush
[39:12] and said moses moses and he said here am
[39:15] i
[39:16] and he said draw not nigh hither put off
[39:18] thy shoes from off thy feet
[39:21] for the place wherein on thou standest
[39:23] is holy ground
[39:25] moreover he said i am the god of thy
[39:27] father the god of abraham the god of
[39:30] isaac and the god of jacob
[39:32] and moses hit his face and for he was
[39:34] afraid to look upon god
[39:36] and the lord said i've surely seen the
[39:38] affliction of my people which are in
[39:40] egypt and have heard their cry by reason
[39:42] of their taskmasters for i know their
[39:45] sorrows
[39:46] and i have come down to deliver them out
[39:48] of the hand of the egyptians and to
[39:50] bring them out of that land into a good
[39:52] land and a large into a land flowing
[39:55] with milk and hunting unto the place of
[39:57] the canaanites and the hivites and the
[39:59] amorites and the perizzites and the
[40:02] hivites and the jebusites now therefore
[40:05] behold the cry of the children of israel
[40:06] has come unto me
[40:08] and i've also seen the oppression where
[40:10] with the egyptians oppressed them
[40:12] come now therefore and i will send thee
[40:14] unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[40:17] forth my people the children of israel
[40:19] out of egypt
[40:20] moses said unto god who am i that i
[40:22] should go to pharaoh and that i should
[40:24] bring forth the children of israel out
[40:26] of egypt and he said certainly i will be
[40:29] with thee and this shall be a token unto
[40:31] thee that i have sent thee when thou has
[40:34] brought forth the people out of egypt
[40:36] you shall serve god upon this mountain
[40:39] and moses said unto god behold when i'm
[40:42] coming to the children of israel and
[40:43] shall say unto them the god of your
[40:46] fathers has sent me unto you and they
[40:48] shall say what is his name
[40:50] what shall i say unto them
[40:53] and god said to moses
[40:54] i am that i am and he said thus shalt
[40:58] thou say unto the children of israel i
[41:00] am has sent me unto you and god said
[41:04] moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say
[41:06] unto the children of israel
[41:07] the lord god of your fathers the god of
[41:10] abraham the god of isaac and the god of
[41:12] jacob has sent me unto you and this is
[41:15] my name forever and this is my memorial
[41:19] unto all generations
[41:21] amen we'll let you be seated this
[41:23] evening
[41:27] as we have been on the thought of jesus
[41:29] christ the same yesterday today and
[41:31] forever we can no doubt as we read this
[41:34] scripture see it very clearly
[41:36] of him expressing himself
[41:38] as the same
[41:40] he said i am the god of abraham isaac
[41:42] and jacob but he didn't leave it there
[41:45] he said i want you to understand that i
[41:47] am so i am the god i am that i am amen i
[41:51] i even whatever i was to them i'm also
[41:55] in this situation and in this time and
[41:58] you know and we see that as they were in
[42:00] a difficult time and it was no doubt
[42:03] very chaotic as their life would unfold
[42:05] every day as slaves in egypt and
[42:08] under the first exodus and they they
[42:10] found themselves under very much a
[42:12] hardship and under very much toiling as
[42:14] long as they would go
[42:16] amen and it seemed like
[42:18] there had been a promise of a deliverer
[42:20] but it seemed like it went on and on and
[42:22] on until god had completely forgot about
[42:25] it but god never forgets his promises we
[42:28] can see here that time does not matter
[42:30] to god at all time only matters to man
[42:33] because we're time beings and we only
[42:35] really have a short time here on this
[42:37] earth so we expect things to be very
[42:39] quickly and very fast but god is an
[42:42] eternal being as we know and so time
[42:44] means nothing to him whether it be five
[42:46] minutes five years 50 years 100 years or
[42:49] 400 years it means nothing to god but
[42:51] what means something to god is that his
[42:54] word is fulfilled
[42:56] and so and so we find as it came down it
[42:58] seemed to be a the dark really dark time
[43:01] and it was a very dark time for the
[43:02] children of israel and it seemed like
[43:04] their cries were no it wasn't going to
[43:07] heaven you know they would cry out to
[43:08] god why why are you forsaking us why
[43:10] were your children you know we we come
[43:12] to this place
[43:14] and and we came to and then there became
[43:16] a pharaoh that didn't know joseph and
[43:18] now we're slaves and what have you
[43:20] forgot about us and and their cries
[43:23] began to go up and no doubt they thought
[43:25] their prayers were not being heard they
[43:27] thought their prayers would would never
[43:29] be answered but you know i love it how
[43:31] he told moses in the very beginning as
[43:33] we read in the scriptures he said god
[43:36] heard their groanings
[43:38] he heard their cries the cries came up
[43:40] to god amen and i want you to understand
[43:43] he's still a god that hears
[43:45] he understands even what we're going
[43:47] through in this exodus that we're facing
[43:50] and you know i don't think we should be
[43:52] surprised that if they in that exodus
[43:54] would have a very it would be a very
[43:55] dark time and a very chaotic time that
[43:58] in this exodus it'll be also a very dark
[44:00] time and a very chaotic time
[44:03] but in the middle of it god's word is
[44:05] going to be fulfilled it's going to come
[44:07] to pass as he said it would you know and
[44:10] it doesn't matter that is 50 or 60 years
[44:13] past when the prophet of god came upon
[44:15] the earth time means nothing to god it
[44:17] means something to us because we're a
[44:19] time being but unto god amen that means
[44:22] nothing what means something to god is
[44:24] i'm going to fulfill what i promised i
[44:27] would but i'm very thankful in this time
[44:29] that we're living in because it is a
[44:31] very difficult time and it's a very
[44:33] trying time seems like every day there's
[44:35] more and more things that are happening
[44:37] and more and more things that are going
[44:39] on darkness is increasing every moment
[44:41] and every day amen every day you get up
[44:44] and there's news and more darkness and
[44:46] news and more darkness and news and more
[44:48] fear and more anxiety and more plagues
[44:51] upon the earth amen it's not going to
[44:52] get any better it's only going to get
[44:54] worse because this world is going into a
[44:57] tribulation
[44:58] amen i didn't say the bride is i said
[45:00] the world is going into a tribulation
[45:03] but i'm thankful in the time that we're
[45:05] living in we still serve a god that is i
[45:08] am not i just i was or i will be but a
[45:12] god that is i am and so if he's a god
[45:14] that is i am he's the same god that
[45:17] heard their cries here's our cries
[45:20] the same god that heard their groanings
[45:22] here's your groanings he hears your cry
[45:24] he hears your requests he sees the tears
[45:27] that fall he sees and hears the
[45:30] questions in your heart amen we're not
[45:32] serving a god that's somewhere off
[45:33] somewhere you know you know and his mind
[45:36] is off of us but he's very involved in
[45:38] the situation that we're in even now
[45:41] amen behind the scenes
[45:43] it's not you know i understand this is
[45:45] satan's eden but satan is only given the
[45:48] reigns by god he can only do things as
[45:50] god allows him to do it so he builds
[45:52] governments he builds kingdoms and but
[45:55] it's under the rulership of god to bring
[45:57] about an end time amen so we're serving
[46:00] a very personal god a god who is present
[46:04] even tonight for your need
[46:06] no matter how little it is no matter how
[46:08] great it is that matters not to god but
[46:11] he is present for your need he's an
[46:13] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[46:16] so if you need a healer he is i am if
[46:19] you need a savior he is i am if you need
[46:22] a deliverer tonight he's i am if you
[46:25] need a waymaker he's i am if you need a
[46:28] promise keeper he is i am if you need a
[46:31] comforter he is i am
[46:34] hallelujah if you need a god he is i am
[46:37] if you need a friend he is i am so
[46:40] whatever your need is in this present
[46:43] situation that you find yourself in he
[46:46] is i am amen he knows amen exactly what
[46:49] it's like to carry the human burdens
[46:51] that we are carrying because he also
[46:54] came in a time a very dark time of the
[46:56] human race amen as he would come up on
[46:58] the earth it was a very chaotic time it
[47:01] was a very unnerving time it was unruly
[47:04] rulers are unruly
[47:06] unruliness and things that was going on
[47:08] amen but he came in that moment and then
[47:11] that time so he knows exactly what it's
[47:14] like to face the pressures of an age he
[47:16] knows what it's like to face the
[47:18] pressures even that you're what you're
[47:20] going on hey man he as brother donny
[47:22] would bring it out there in my mom's
[47:24] memorial he knows what it's like to ask
[47:26] why
[47:28] amen he knows because why why hast thou
[47:31] forsaken me he knows the feeling of
[47:34] being forsaken
[47:35] or feeling forsaken therefore he
[47:38] promised you i will never leave you or
[47:41] forsake you
[47:42] well hallelujah so in your middle of
[47:45] your trial he is still there
[47:48] no matter how much your feelings may not
[47:49] declare it or your sight may not declare
[47:52] it that does not matter he is still
[47:54] there because his promise declares that
[47:57] he is he's heard your cry he's seen the
[48:00] devil and what he's been doing against
[48:02] you and coming against you and he has
[48:05] come down to deliver you
[48:08] hallelujah now this god is a
[48:10] supernatural god and when god comes
[48:13] supernatural things takes place when the
[48:16] supernatural comes and falls into the
[48:18] midst amen that's what we saw there in
[48:21] moses it was a supernatural thing that a
[48:23] burning bush would appear and a bush
[48:26] would catch on fire but yet not burn and
[48:28] it was so supernatural that it caught a
[48:31] backslidden prophet
[48:32] and he's on the backside of a desert no
[48:34] doubt his mind was a million miles away
[48:37] amen from the children of israel and
[48:39] he'd put it out of his mind been out
[48:41] there for 40 years and was having a good
[48:43] life but all of a sudden the
[48:45] supernatural fell in place and he said
[48:48] i'm going to see what that's all about
[48:50] and a voice begins to speak and his
[48:52] voice began to declare god in that
[48:55] present time amen of god for that
[48:58] present situation it was showing in that
[49:01] moment he's always present tense
[49:04] he's never in the future or oh never
[49:07] just in the past but this god is always
[49:10] present tense amen a voice spoke and he
[49:13] said i have come down to deliver my
[49:17] people and when that voice spoke pharaoh
[49:20] lost his power
[49:24] amen pharaoh may not have realized it at
[49:26] that moment but a voice spoke and said
[49:28] i've come down to deliver them and at
[49:30] that moment pharaoh lost his power
[49:34] amen amen pharaoh's day was over he lost
[49:38] his power and god began to plague his
[49:41] kingdom he began to plague his god the
[49:43] gods of egypt until every god of egypt
[49:47] amen was destroyed it was a pillar of
[49:49] fire that appeared in that day amen as
[49:53] in that first exodus he appeared in a
[49:55] pillar of fire and again in this exodus
[49:58] he has once again come in the form of a
[50:00] pillar of fire
[50:02] it's another supernatural event that has
[50:05] taken place in our day
[50:07] amen
[50:08] oh hallelujah and a voice has spoken our
[50:11] day
[50:12] amen i'm not i don't just want to point
[50:15] to the first text of this what good is
[50:16] it it's just the first exodus and he was
[50:19] just a god there he's still a god today
[50:21] [Applause]
[50:24] amen and a voice spoke
[50:27] amen out of the prophet's mouth in our
[50:30] day
[50:32] and it wasn't just a man speaking it was
[50:34] god speaking through a man
[50:37] and at that moment satan lost his power
[50:43] hallelujah amen the seals were tore off
[50:46] the questions and the liens that have
[50:48] been struck off and now as satan lost
[50:51] his power we can realize we are a free
[50:54] people
[50:57] satan has lost his power to hold you any
[51:00] longer
[51:00] [Applause]
[51:03] hallelujah i'm here to declare to you
[51:05] depression has lost his power
[51:11] anxiety and fear has lost his power
[51:15] it once could hold a people but now a
[51:18] voice is spoke in our generation
[51:20] [Applause]
[51:22] hallelujah amen it was his last days
[51:26] pharaoh had a last day
[51:29] he lost his ability to hold people amen
[51:33] just as the devil in this day has lost
[51:36] his ability to hold people in sin
[51:40] oh praise be to god amen they're used to
[51:42] he used to have that ability to hold
[51:45] somebody in sin because there wasn't a
[51:47] power great enough but a power came back
[51:50] in this day as it did on the day of
[51:52] pentecost and a holy ghost can fall in a
[51:54] bed and a man or a woman and satan lose
[51:58] every bit of his power
[52:01] where once there was power of cigarettes
[52:03] to hold somebody amen the holy ghost can
[52:06] come and cleanse it and it loses power
[52:09] you all have a witness in the building
[52:11] tonight you knew when it lost that that
[52:13] demon of a cigarette that demon of
[52:16] drinking one day lost his power
[52:19] [Applause]
[52:22] i love to remind the devil you've lost
[52:24] your power
[52:25] [Applause]
[52:27] amen amen you are the very proof tonight
[52:30] you are the very proof tonight that
[52:33] satan has lost his power
[52:36] [Applause]
[52:43] we know the stories they would go and
[52:45] the ten plagues that fell
[52:47] and it was actually a plague against
[52:49] every god
[52:51] the god of the nile and the god of the
[52:53] flies and the god of this and the god of
[52:56] that all the worship the gods they
[52:57] worship
[52:59] they i am showed i have authority over
[53:01] that
[53:03] amen
[53:04] and i want that devil to remember that
[53:06] tonight the i am still has authority
[53:08] over you
[53:10] i may not have power over you as a human
[53:12] being but as a son of god the i am has
[53:16] power and authority over you
[53:19] amen we saw it expressed amen when
[53:21] demonic expressions would come out of
[53:24] people it'd be a son of god that would
[53:25] take his god-given rights and say you
[53:28] devil you can't hold her no more you
[53:30] can't hold him no more and begin to
[53:33] preach the word of god and the prayer of
[53:35] faith and that demon realize i'm done
[53:39] i'm done i gotta get out of here i've
[53:41] lost my power
[53:44] hallelujah i'm looking at a people
[53:46] tonight that the devil has lost it he
[53:49] don't have power to hold you no more
[53:53] he's lost it all i'm looking at young
[53:56] people that the devil lost power
[54:01] you would have been there
[54:03] when he saved them you want to be there
[54:06] when he turned them around you want to
[54:08] be there when he moved on the scene
[54:14] hallelujah
[54:16] no wonder we could sing hallelujah
[54:19] no wonder we can say as long as i'm
[54:20] alive i'm gonna glorify
[54:25] you can take your church of christ
[54:27] spirit and pack it out of here there's
[54:29] worshipers that realize the devil lost
[54:33] his power
[54:35] and i'm gonna see why there there's a
[54:37] lamb that will sway
[54:46] hallelujah
[54:51] so it seemed like you know what this is
[54:52] going to be a wonderful thing
[54:54] we just got released we're out of here
[54:57] god says i got one more thing up my
[54:59] sleeve
[55:02] i want you to go tell moses about the
[55:04] battle plan and the you know they didn't
[55:06] have waze or gps back then i don't
[55:08] reckon he said but i want you to go buy
[55:10] this play and you're going in camp over
[55:13] here and you're going to move over here
[55:15] he said the reason this is going to be
[55:17] because pharaoh is going to hear about
[55:18] it you know man they don't lost their
[55:20] mind
[55:21] they're entangled
[55:24] they're entangled in the wilderness
[55:26] and i will harden pharaoh's heart that
[55:29] he'll follow after them and i will be
[55:32] honored on faith on pharaoh
[55:36] amen maybe that's the reason the bible
[55:38] has been walking for about 50 or 60
[55:40] years
[55:42] you think god don't have a plan he's got
[55:44] a plan
[55:45] may not fit your plan but it's his plan
[55:47] and i mean as far as i know he's still
[55:49] god
[55:50] [Applause]
[55:52] i don't know why we're still here but
[55:53] amen maybe it's to entangle the amen
[55:56] for the devil to say what you don't look
[55:58] at that that bride don't got as much
[56:00] power as she thought she did
[56:02] she don't have as much as what she once
[56:04] thought she had look at her she's still
[56:06] walking around here's 2021. we ought to
[56:09] go down there and god's saying come on
[56:13] amen come on amen i'm building a trap
[56:15] for your devil and you just don't even
[56:17] know it
[56:18] i'm bringing you to a place i'm inviting
[56:20] you into a place amen for your
[56:23] destruction
[56:25] hallelujah so he's invited cancer and
[56:28] he's invited coach i'm gonna get
[56:29] somewhere with him he's invited every
[56:31] kind of devil into this rail not for
[56:33] your destruction
[56:35] not for your destruction it's for his
[56:37] destruction
[56:40] hallelujah because he knows he don't
[56:42] have power
[56:44] [Applause]
[56:48] so he made ready his cancer and he made
[56:50] ready his covenant and whatever other
[56:52] disease and he's riding after him
[56:55] he made it already his sin and different
[56:57] things trying to come back after them
[56:59] with his whips and as well and and these
[57:01] things of the past
[57:03] did you hear me the things of the past
[57:06] you try to come hold it over them again
[57:08] but god had a plan
[57:10] he said he got here he's coming don't
[57:12] worry about it in god's mind he wasn't
[57:15] worried about it it was the children of
[57:16] israel started thinking what is there no
[57:18] graves in egypt you brought us out here
[57:20] to die in
[57:22] i just like to say this i'd rather die
[57:24] free man than die slaves
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:30] amen if i get down to the end of all of
[57:32] this and i close my eyes and there's
[57:35] nothing to it i got a free man
[57:40] because i drank all i want to i've
[57:42] smoked all i want to i've seen all i
[57:45] want to i just don't want to cause it's
[57:47] been broke in my life
[57:51] i'm a free man
[57:58] amen and so here they go
[58:00] but what happened
[58:02] that pillar of fire moved between them
[58:04] and the egyptians
[58:06] amen we know the story
[58:08] moses began to speak the word of god he
[58:10] said fear ye not
[58:12] stand still and see the salvation of the
[58:14] lord which it shall show you this day
[58:17] for the egyptians whom you've seen today
[58:19] you'll see them no more again no no
[58:21] again no more forever and the lord shall
[58:24] fight for you and you shall hold your
[58:26] peace
[58:28] you know i i i thought that was it was
[58:31] really good when i
[58:32] thought about it being just good old
[58:33] southern you know the lord shall fight
[58:35] for you and you'll shut up
[58:37] but it's more than that
[58:39] it's time for you to hold your peace
[58:42] because you got a peace the world didn't
[58:43] give and the world can't take away
[58:46] so it doesn't matter if the egyptians
[58:47] are breathing down your neck hold your
[58:49] peace
[58:50] it doesn't matter if the death the
[58:51] doctors tell you you ain't got four more
[58:53] days to live or four more months to live

[1:03:29] oh my and the egyptians fled against it
[1:03:32] but the lord overthrew them in the midst
[1:03:33] of the sea and the waters returned and
[1:03:36] covered the chariots and the horsemen
[1:03:37] and all the hosts of pharaoh but the
[1:03:39] children of israel walked upon dry land
[1:03:42] and the waters were a wall in them on
[1:03:44] the right and on their left thus the
[1:03:46] lord saved israel that day out of the
[1:03:48] hands of the egyptians and israel saw
[1:03:50] the egyptians dead upon the seashore
[1:03:55] dead upon the seashore he just told him
[1:03:57] the egyptians you see today you'll see
[1:03:58] no more forever
[1:04:03] it was a little different egyptian
[1:04:08] when they saw them before they had whips
[1:04:10] in their hands had reigns in their hands
[1:04:13] and they were coming after them and they
[1:04:14] were snarling to make this time they saw
[1:04:16] them
[1:04:17] ain't no breath in their body
[1:04:20] you know what miriam realized they're
[1:04:22] that one right there
[1:04:24] he can't pick that whip up no more
[1:04:27] there ain't no strength in him anymore
[1:04:28] to pick up a whip and whip me one more
[1:04:31] time
[1:04:32] amen one of them realized there's that
[1:04:33] one that took me around the corner and
[1:04:35] beat me and ravished me he can't do that
[1:04:37] not one more time
[1:04:39] and some joy came on their hearts amen
[1:04:42] you should have been there
[1:04:43] [Applause]
[1:04:45] amen you either think there's something
[1:04:46] against shouting and dancing you should
[1:04:48] have been there
[1:04:49] when you realize the egyptians are dead
[1:04:52] they don't have no more breath they
[1:04:54] don't have no more abilities they've
[1:04:57] lost
[1:05:00] hallelujah you should have been there
[1:05:02] when that little girl realized that fear
[1:05:05] can't hold me no more that anxiety can't
[1:05:08] hold me no more amen that depression
[1:05:10] can't hold me no more
[1:05:13] hallelujah this should have been there
[1:05:16] when that sister realized that cancer
[1:05:18] can't hold me no more
[1:05:20] and around and around this church he
[1:05:23] went leaning on the arms of the beloved
[1:05:26] you should have been there it was a
[1:05:28] glorious time but you're here tonight
[1:05:32] you're here tonight he's i am he's still
[1:05:36] the same one who heals delivers set free
[1:05:44] they no longer had power
[1:05:46] no wonder that people could
[1:05:49] no wonder they're dancing around
[1:05:57] brother branham would look at that woman
[1:05:59] dancing there in this church and said
[1:06:01] they're going to turn in my to my church
[1:06:02] into a tavern he said she's over there
[1:06:05] beating on that piano said there been
[1:06:06] four rows of keys i think should have
[1:06:08] hit every one of them
[1:06:10] so the next thing you know this little
[1:06:11] girl got something started beating on a
[1:06:13] little
[1:06:14] washboard
[1:06:16] wouldn't work in some churches
[1:06:19] that's drums
[1:06:22] beating on the watch board
[1:06:24] amen that's rock and roll music
[1:06:26] that's what brother brown thought too he
[1:06:28] said they're turning my church into a
[1:06:29] tavern
[1:06:30] playing that stuff like that he said
[1:06:32] next thing you know this little girl got
[1:06:33] out dancing in the aisle that really
[1:06:35] stirred him up
[1:06:37] it was wrong with my hand
[1:06:39] i shouldn't have had half time
[1:06:41] that's what it was he said he was
[1:06:43] teaching on the second coming of christ
[1:06:45] and said he'd be going about four hours
[1:06:48] that don't go against that goes against
[1:06:50] some of your message believers too don't
[1:06:51] it
[1:06:52] church order brother churchill okay four
[1:06:54] hours he said i thought i'd have a
[1:06:56] little half time let him have a little
[1:06:57] rest
[1:07:04] hey man
[1:07:08] amen it's time some of you lose that
[1:07:09] slave mentality
[1:07:11] some of you two slave too much a slave
[1:07:13] to a clock
[1:07:15] i didn't mean to go there but we went
[1:07:17] there
[1:07:19] my beans are burning let them burn who
[1:07:21] cares
[1:07:22] they got more beans
[1:07:23] there's only one eternal life
[1:07:28] amen
[1:07:29] amen he said they're turning into a
[1:07:30] tavern he started thinking about it said
[1:07:32] where i danced he said there's he said
[1:07:34] you know
[1:07:35] where's dancing is it in the bible he
[1:07:36] said there's a lot of things we don't
[1:07:38] know
[1:07:38] what's fundamentalist i think is what he
[1:07:40] called himself you know what he said
[1:07:42] though something but we ought to all
[1:07:44] take the heart
[1:07:46] he said i wouldn't say nothing about it
[1:07:48] he said because they might be right and
[1:07:50] i might be wrong
[1:07:54] man
[1:07:55] oh to be more like the prophet well try
[1:07:57] that
[1:08:01] amen
[1:08:02] this is the next thing you know he
[1:08:03] started thinking about where is dancing
[1:08:05] ordained in the bible
[1:08:07] we got to thinking about miriam
[1:08:09] seeing no dead attack masters
[1:08:12] and he said wow yeah she danced she
[1:08:14] played the tambourine and danced got
[1:08:16] thinking about david
[1:08:17] and how he saw the word being restored
[1:08:19] and he got so tore up about that he
[1:08:21] started dancing he said but you know
[1:08:23] what he said there was one thing about
[1:08:24] that he said this his little wife got
[1:08:26] tore up about it because he was out of
[1:08:28] order
[1:08:30] he said what did god do he said he
[1:08:32] cursed her seed
[1:08:34] she never could bring forth life
[1:08:37] so be careful what you say
[1:08:39] it might be the holy ghost you're
[1:08:41] mocking
[1:08:43] amen and so here we go he said but the
[1:08:45] next thing i knew he said you know what
[1:08:47] happened i got to realize as i was
[1:08:48] looking at that listening that music and
[1:08:50] watching that girl dance he said my
[1:08:52] methodist foot got the patent
[1:08:55] he said next thing i knew he said i was
[1:08:57] out there dancing with her he said i've
[1:08:59] never done ain't nothing that before he
[1:09:01] said but i think he'd done a pretty good
[1:09:02] job
[1:09:04] amen amen so we need to realize amen
[1:09:07] that we we
[1:09:08] we want more than just a intellectual
[1:09:11] knowledge
[1:09:12] amen that we want more than intellectual
[1:09:15] knowledge that satan has lost his power
[1:09:18] we want a reality of it
[1:09:20] a revelation of it amen it's one thing
[1:09:23] to know god and say pharaoh lost his
[1:09:25] power or this lost his power amen that
[1:09:28] one got free but what about you
[1:09:32] when you see him dead
[1:09:35] when you see that devil that's tormented
[1:09:37] you dead it'll do something to you
[1:09:40] it'll put a shout in you it'll put a
[1:09:42] dance in you
[1:09:44] i said this before but i say it again
[1:09:46] amen ii timothy paul would say in the
[1:09:48] last days perilous times shall come last
[1:09:51] days for who
[1:09:53] where are we living in we're living in
[1:09:55] the last days for the devil
[1:09:58] we're living in the last days pharaoh
[1:10:00] had a last day philistines had a last
[1:10:03] day goliath had a last day haman had a
[1:10:06] last day
[1:10:09] hallelujah he had such a last day that
[1:10:12] even this in this hour we're living in
[1:10:14] they still write his name on the bottom
[1:10:16] of the soles of their feet and they read
[1:10:18] the book of esther and every time
[1:10:20] haman's name comes up they stomp their
[1:10:22] feet
[1:10:23] until every mark of that name is gone
[1:10:28] amen if the devil's not under your feet
[1:10:31] he's out of his place
[1:10:35] hallelujah he belongs under your feet
[1:10:41] he belongs unto you amen what was meant
[1:10:44] for your destruction god is turning
[1:10:46] around for your good satan has lost
[1:10:51] well think about that
[1:10:53] anxiety has come to his last
[1:10:56] service lust has come to his last
[1:10:59] service suicide has come to his last
[1:11:02] service
[1:11:03] fear has come to his last service
[1:11:07] would it be tonight cancer has come to
[1:11:10] his last service
[1:11:12] it did before
[1:11:15] it comes service after service but there
[1:11:17] came a last service
[1:11:21] oh mercy jesus
[1:11:24] let's turn to acts 12 and verse 5.
[1:11:30] mercy
[1:11:31] had time to go we got the armor girl
[1:11:34] flip it back the other way
[1:11:36] come to her last day
[1:11:41] last time sweeping the floor
[1:11:43] last time taking out the trash
[1:11:46] last time
[1:11:48] just like they did there as they walked
[1:11:50] out
[1:11:51] one day a slave the next day free
[1:11:56] do you hear that book board coming
[1:11:59] i think i hear it
[1:12:03] amen we've been hearing it
[1:12:05] been preached
[1:12:07] actually acts 12 and verse 5 peter
[1:12:09] therefore was kept in the prison
[1:12:12] but prayer was made without ceasing of
[1:12:14] the church unto god for him
[1:12:16] and when herod had would have been would
[1:12:18] have brought him forth the same night
[1:12:21] peter was sleeping between two soldiers
[1:12:23] bound with two chains and the keepers
[1:12:25] before the door kept the prison
[1:12:28] but did that matter to god
[1:12:31] oh i got him this time
[1:12:33] i got two right beside him and i got two
[1:12:35] at the door
[1:12:37] he's done
[1:12:41] and behold the angel lord came up to him
[1:12:44] and a light shined in the prison
[1:12:46] and he smoked peter on the side and
[1:12:48] raised him up saying arise
[1:12:51] up quickly
[1:12:52] and his chains fell off of his hands
[1:12:55] and the angel said on him gird thyself
[1:12:57] and bind on thy sandals and so he did
[1:13:00] and saith unto them cast that garment
[1:13:02] about me and follow me and he went out
[1:13:04] and followed him and was not it was true
[1:13:06] that was done by an angel but thought he
[1:13:08] saw a vision but when he was past the
[1:13:10] first and he was past the second and it
[1:13:13] came to that
[1:13:14] he was past justification
[1:13:16] sanctification
[1:13:18] and the holy ghost
[1:13:19] amen it came to the iron gate that
[1:13:21] leadeth into the city which opened to
[1:13:23] him of his own accord and they went out
[1:13:25] and passed on through one street and
[1:13:27] fought with the angel departed from him
[1:13:29] and when peter was come to himself he
[1:13:31] said now i know of a surety the lord has
[1:13:34] sent his angel and has delivered me out
[1:13:37] of the hand of herod and from all the
[1:13:39] expectation of the people of the jews i
[1:13:42] love that word right there from all the
[1:13:45] expectation of the people of the jew now
[1:13:47] the devil had a lot of expectations for
[1:13:49] your life
[1:13:51] he tried to keep you covered up he tried
[1:13:53] to keep you bound with chains and guards
[1:13:55] all around you but there was an angel
[1:13:57] that could get beyond every guard get
[1:14:00] beyond every chain get beyond every gate
[1:14:02] every door amen you might have been in
[1:14:04] the innermost part and seemed like it
[1:14:06] was so hopeless but an angel still could
[1:14:09] get to you
[1:14:11] i'm so thankful i couldn't go down far
[1:14:13] enough that that angel couldn't still
[1:14:15] get to me
[1:14:16] but he picked me up and he smoked me on
[1:14:19] the side and said timothy this ain't
[1:14:21] your life this ain't who you are let me
[1:14:24] lead you to where you belong
[1:14:26] [Applause]
[1:14:28] and it led me past all the things in my
[1:14:30] life all of all my past mistakes all my
[1:14:33] past failures and all the things that
[1:14:36] try to hold me down
[1:14:38] i'm beginning to realize i'm free
[1:14:41] and the devil's expectations didn't come
[1:14:43] to pass
[1:14:45] whoo
[1:14:47] some of you he expected you to end a
[1:14:49] drunk he'll expect you to end a dope
[1:14:51] head he expects you to end in all kind
[1:14:54] of misery and strife but god sent an
[1:14:56] angel
[1:14:58] and he changed the expectations
[1:15:02] he even changed your expectations
[1:15:05] maybe peter's expectations in the
[1:15:07] morning i'm going to be stoned or i'm
[1:15:09] going to die but almighty god came on
[1:15:11] the scene and it changed even his
[1:15:14] expectations
[1:15:16] to where now
[1:15:17] he realized i ain't bound no more he's
[1:15:20] loosed me and he set me free
[1:15:24] and we also the story
[1:15:26] as we bring this on down
[1:15:28] of lazarus
[1:15:30] and it's really where we want to draw
[1:15:32] from
[1:15:33] we know the story of he went down into
[1:15:35] the grave going through a lot
[1:15:37] here passing a lot and he goes and jesus
[1:15:39] is seemingly going another direction
[1:15:42] he seemingly didn't know he's he's heard
[1:15:44] the request but he's not answering it
[1:15:47] he's heard it but he's not answering it
[1:15:50] just give him time
[1:15:52] he will answer
[1:15:56] he will answer
[1:15:58] he may not answer the way you expect him
[1:16:00] to answer
[1:16:01] but he will answer
[1:16:03] i've realized that even the last few
[1:16:05] months i expected a different answer
[1:16:08] but he still answered
[1:16:13] you know when that ipad played and began
[1:16:14] to speak about the down down from his
[1:16:16] glory
[1:16:18] and all that as i was speaking about
[1:16:20] amen the the three hebrew children going
[1:16:22] into the fire and he came down and that
[1:16:24] ipad began to play behind me amen the
[1:16:26] worst sinner in the city in 56
[1:16:29] favorite of all the hymns
[1:16:32] because it expresses his extreme deity
[1:16:34] especially in the day that we're living
[1:16:36] in when they want to make him just a
[1:16:38] prophet but he's more than a prophet
[1:16:39] he's god
[1:16:42] my expectation was that was for my
[1:16:44] mother
[1:16:46] she would rise up there out of there
[1:16:47] without a smell of smoke on her
[1:16:50] she did
[1:16:52] she was in a place saying another brain
[1:16:53] bleed can get her
[1:16:59] we saw god heal we know god heals brain
[1:17:01] bleeds he did it
[1:17:03] but it wasn't my expectation
[1:17:06] that wasn't what i expected but then i
[1:17:08] get to realize and afterwards as the
[1:17:10] time would go and i'd go down to her
[1:17:12] bedroom there in the or i see your room
[1:17:14] i see your room in the hospital she
[1:17:16] ain't spoke for 17 hours hadn't even
[1:17:18] said a word we prayed for her and she
[1:17:20] didn't even act like was praying for her
[1:17:22] but tim walks into the bathroom i get
[1:17:24] down in her face and i begin to talk to
[1:17:26] her about i just begin to speak about
[1:17:28] he's come down to deliver
[1:17:31] and she starts singing me the song down
[1:17:33] from his glory
[1:17:34] whole first verse into the course
[1:17:37] and through this time i began to realize
[1:17:40] that was for me
[1:17:42] i was about to walk through fire
[1:17:45] but he's with me
[1:17:48] about to go through one of the hardest
[1:17:49] trials of my life
[1:17:51] but he's right there with me
[1:17:53] amen you can take that for yourself
[1:17:55] tonight because he's still with you too
[1:17:57] because his word says he is
[1:17:59] he said i will never leave you or
[1:18:01] forsake you so it may seem like he's
[1:18:03] walking four days away but he's still
[1:18:06] right here beside you
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:12] and here he went
[1:18:14] disciple he tells us you know disciples
[1:18:16] he sleeps
[1:18:17] and they said well my if he's sleeping
[1:18:19] he's doing well
[1:18:22] good nap
[1:18:24] he said lazarus is dead
[1:18:27] and i'm glad for your sakes that i was
[1:18:28] not there to the intent you may believe
[1:18:31] nether nevertheless let's go unto him
[1:18:36] and so he begins to come and they come
[1:18:37] and tell martha he's come
[1:18:40] but mary still sat in the house
[1:18:43] martha came to and said lord if i would
[1:18:45] have been here my brother would not have
[1:18:46] died but i know that even now
[1:18:50] whatsoever thou ask of god god to give
[1:18:52] it to you and he said thy brother shall
[1:18:54] rise again she said i know in the last
[1:18:56] days in the resurrection he said i am
[1:19:00] here we go again i am
[1:19:02] i am the resurrection and the life and
[1:19:04] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:19:06] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[1:19:09] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:19:10] die believeth thou this
[1:19:15] amen believeth thou this
[1:19:17] she said yea lord i believe that thou
[1:19:19] art the christ the son of god which
[1:19:21] should come into the world amen she was
[1:19:23] coming to the moment okay he's i am
[1:19:26] thou art the cries sees i am when she
[1:19:29] had said so she went away and called
[1:19:30] mary and said the masters come and
[1:19:32] called us for thee and as soon as she
[1:19:34] heard that she arose and came unto him
[1:19:36] and jesus not yet come to town but was
[1:19:38] in that place where martha met him and
[1:19:40] the jews in which were there in the
[1:19:42] house comforting her and when they saw
[1:19:44] mary she rose up hastily she said well
[1:19:46] she's going to the grave to weep
[1:19:48] mary came to where jesus was she fell
[1:19:50] down at his feet saying lord
[1:19:53] if i was being here my my brother not
[1:19:55] died
[1:19:56] and jesus saw her weeping and the jews
[1:19:59] also weeping and he groaned in his
[1:20:00] spirit and was troubled so where have
[1:20:02] you laid him he said lord come and see
[1:20:05] and jesus swelled he's the jew said well
[1:20:08] he must have loved him someone said
[1:20:09] could not this man which opened the eyes
[1:20:11] of the blind caused even this man should
[1:20:13] not have died
[1:20:14] jesus therefore again groaning himself
[1:20:16] coming to the grave he said take away
[1:20:18] the stone
[1:20:21] we know how do we know what happened is
[1:20:23] he would stand there
[1:20:24] and he would scream with a loud voice
[1:20:26] lazarus
[1:20:28] come forth
[1:20:30] branham said if he wouldn't have said
[1:20:32] lazarus
[1:20:33] it'd have been a general resurrection
[1:20:35] because that was the voice of the
[1:20:37] resurrection
[1:20:39] amen lazarus come forth and lazarus was
[1:20:41] on a four-day journey
[1:20:44] but a voice caught him where he was
[1:20:47] and he turned around and he moved back
[1:20:48] to where the voice was coming from and
[1:20:51] the dead came forth bound hand and foot
[1:20:53] with grave clothes and his face was
[1:20:56] bound about with a napkin and jesus said
[1:20:58] unto
[1:20:59] loose him and let him go
[1:21:03] hallelujah listen he don't want you to
[1:21:05] just rise up he wants you to be loosed
[1:21:09] you don't have to be bound by those
[1:21:11] things
[1:21:12] walk away from those grave clothes
[1:21:20] he wants his children free
[1:21:23] free to serve him we can see that in
[1:21:25] luke chapter 13 and verse 10.
[1:21:28] he was teaching in one of the synagogues
[1:21:30] on the sabbath and behold there was a
[1:21:32] woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18
[1:21:35] years
[1:21:37] that was bowed together and could not no
[1:21:39] wise lift herself up
[1:21:41] and when jesus saw her
[1:21:44] he called her unto him and said woman
[1:21:46] thou art loose from thy infirmity
[1:21:49] and he laid hands on her and immediately
[1:21:51] she was made straight and glorified god
[1:21:56] it doesn't matter how long you had it
[1:21:58] it doesn't matter how difficult it is
[1:22:01] when that voice speaks it's over with
[1:22:06] you may come into services bowed down
[1:22:08] maybe your whole life has been bent over
[1:22:11] under the weight but let that voice of
[1:22:13] resurrection speak
[1:22:15] and say you're loosed
[1:22:22] and the ruler you thought the church had
[1:22:24] been oh hallelujah praise the lord got a
[1:22:27] free one in the house
[1:22:28] she's dancing all over the place she's
[1:22:30] loosed
[1:22:34] they answered with indignation
[1:22:36] because of jesus healed on the sabbath
[1:22:38] day
[1:22:40] and said unto the people there are six
[1:22:42] days which men ought to work
[1:22:44] and them therefore come and be healed
[1:22:45] and not on the sabbath day and the lord
[1:22:48] then answered them said thou hypocrite
[1:22:51] oh he knows who they are
[1:22:53] no every one of you on the sabbath day
[1:22:55] loose his ox or his ass from the stall
[1:22:57] and lead him away to water then ought
[1:22:59] not this woman
[1:23:01] being a daughter of abraham
[1:23:03] who satan has bound lo these 18 years
[1:23:06] be loosed from this bond on the sabbath
[1:23:08] day
[1:23:11] hallelujah
[1:23:12] oh i pray that that voice will speak
[1:23:14] tonight and say you devil you hypocrite
[1:23:17] you held them too long
[1:23:20] that's a daughter of abraham that's the
[1:23:22] son of abraham they have a right to be
[1:23:26] free
[1:23:27] [Applause]

[1:23:35] moment

[1:23:41] heavens and earth shall pass away but my
[1:23:44] word shall not pass away

[1:29:10] something in it that keeps the fire from
[1:29:12] going and burning and causing some real
[1:29:14] red hot hot coals you want some fire
[1:29:16] that's been dried out of itself it's
[1:29:18] life is gone it's everything it ever was
[1:29:21] it's gone it's just it's it's just that
[1:29:23] wood laying on there and you light that
[1:29:25] old fire and it gets to crackling it
[1:29:27] gets to popping it gets to spitting and
[1:29:29] sputtering and the fire gets to jumping

[1:29:53] ain't looking for some green wood
[1:29:55] it ain't looking something that's got to
[1:29:56] steal its own wants and its own ways and
[1:29:58] its own desire still and it's still
[1:30:00] soggy and wet it's looking for something
[1:30:02] that's been dried out and said i don't

[1:30:08] more my arrogance i don't want no more
[1:30:11] of timothy pruitt i don't want no more
[1:30:13] myself then that fire will fall
[1:30:17] then it can light up upon that wood and
[1:30:19] it'll go to jumping and popping and
[1:30:22] carrying on and every devil in hell
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:28] my my my
[1:30:29] the devil don't like fire but he's about
[1:30:31] to get burnt up with
[1:30:32] it amen
[1:30:35] he said this will change the whole
[1:30:36] surface of the entire earth she'll burst
[1:30:40] and blow to pieces on the outside the
[1:30:42] crust and 100 feet below it'll simply be
[1:30:45] demolished the atmospheres the gases
[1:30:47] that's in the earth now they're finding
[1:30:49] their missiles they can't get through to
[1:30:51] it great spheres up there way up some
[1:30:53] kind of fear all the gases they say that
[1:30:55] will burst the holy wrath of god will
[1:30:58] come upon it it'll cleanse it it'll
[1:31:00] change the entire service surface
[1:31:02] heavens and earth will pass away now
[1:31:04] this word means passing from one form to
[1:31:07] another it does not mean annihilation as
[1:31:10] the english word would mean pass away
[1:31:12] it's annihilated but the hebrew word
[1:31:14] or the greek word here does not mean
[1:31:16] that it means passing from one form to
[1:31:19] another it from one condition to another
[1:31:23] it's being loosed from the curse of the
[1:31:25] fall
[1:31:26] and being restored back to an eden
[1:31:29] hallelujah amen same word would be used
[1:31:32] in titus 3 verse 5 not by works of
[1:31:35] righteousness which we have done but
[1:31:37] according to his mercy he saved us by
[1:31:39] the washing of regeneration regeneration
[1:31:43] is loosed
[1:31:45] it's bringing us changing what it was
[1:31:48] into something new again
[1:31:51] paul is using the same word means
[1:31:53] regeneration of a man that man has
[1:31:55] passed from being a sinner to being a
[1:31:58] saint
[1:31:59] not annihilated but the man's been
[1:32:02] changed he isn't annihilated he's a
[1:32:05] changed person
[1:32:06] he's been changed from what he was to
[1:32:09] what he should be
[1:32:12] jesus would use it again and then
[1:32:14] matthew 19 and verse 28 jesus said unto
[1:32:17] them verily i say unto you that ye which
[1:32:19] follow me in the regeneration
[1:32:22] in the regeneration when the son of man
[1:32:24] shall sit on the throne of his glory
[1:32:26] amen you shall sit upon twelve thrones
[1:32:28] judging the twelve tribes of israel
[1:32:30] jesus used the same word you set with me
[1:32:32] and my father's kingdom regenerate it
[1:32:35] you're changed he used that same word
[1:32:37] when he said to the cut said to the colt
[1:32:39] loose the colt and let him go he said
[1:32:41] the same thing at the resurrection of
[1:32:43] lazarus loose him change him he's been
[1:32:46] tied let him go what did it mean the
[1:32:48] earth will be loosed from the grip of
[1:32:51] satan
[1:32:52] it'll be loose from politics
[1:32:56] it'll be loose from denominational
[1:32:58] religious systems and be used for the
[1:33:00] kingdom of god to establish the kingdom
[1:33:02] of god here on the earth but as long as
[1:33:04] in the hands of satan politics
[1:33:09] as we heard well i'm not a democrat what
[1:33:12] are you a republican
[1:33:15] i'm a conservative
[1:33:18] no i'm a christian
[1:33:20] i'm not from this kingdom
[1:33:23] gets down to it i'm not a u.s citizen
[1:33:28] i'm a heavenly citizen
[1:33:32] right now satan is the ruler of this
[1:33:34] earth he owns it
[1:33:36] but christ has come to redeem it
[1:33:39] he said
[1:33:40] just like one time i was satan's
[1:33:42] property
[1:33:44] but not now
[1:33:46] how many can say that tonight one time i
[1:33:48] was but not now
[1:33:51] one time that little woman was his
[1:33:53] property but not now he's talking about
[1:33:55] the woman at the well he came to loose
[1:33:57] the grip of satan on that line he came
[1:34:00] to loose the sin of satan on my life on
[1:34:04] your life and now we are no longer

[1:35:01] of god
[1:35:02] shall be established
[1:35:04] forever
[1:35:06] he would also say this in revelation 1
[1:35:08] and i'm bringing this down one in verse
[1:35:10] 5
[1:35:11] unto him that loved us
[1:35:12] and washed us
[1:35:14] from our sins
[1:35:16] in his own blood
[1:35:19] hmm
[1:35:20] this word washed is loosed
[1:35:23] he's loosed us from our sins
[1:35:25] in his own blood loose from sin
[1:35:29] bound up in the blood
[1:35:32] oh i'm wrapped up tied up tangled up in
[1:35:34] jesus
[1:35:35] i used to be a tangled up soul
[1:35:38] but now i'm tangled up for the right
[1:35:39] things
[1:35:41] amen he said isn't that wonderful did
[1:35:43] you catch it it was his own blood that
[1:35:45] loosed us completely from our sins not
[1:35:48] our human blood it was the blood of god
[1:35:51] peter called it the blood of christ paul
[1:35:53] called the blood of the lord the blood
[1:35:54] of jesus not three but one person
[1:35:57] there's a revelation again one god that
[1:35:59] omnipotent jehovah god came down and
[1:36:01] made himself a body by means of the
[1:36:03] virgin birth and indwelted that it might
[1:36:06] be the blood of god that would free us
[1:36:08] loose us entirely
[1:36:13] he don't lose you partway
[1:36:16] if you're only part way is cause you're
[1:36:18] holding on to something
[1:36:21] there was a lot of part way in the first
[1:36:23] exodus and they end up staying in egypt
[1:36:27] don't be partway
[1:36:29] he wants to loose us entirely
[1:36:34] he said he that loveth the world don't
[1:36:36] love god
[1:36:39] you're saying you're loose from sins and
[1:36:40] yet you still
[1:36:42] sin
[1:36:46] that's what i call an idiot
[1:36:49] how can you be loosed from something and
[1:36:51] still do it
[1:36:53] well it's okay long as you don't indulge
[1:36:57] you're trying to tell me it don't got
[1:36:58] you it's got you
[1:37:02] you know these people who wants to walk
[1:37:03] away from the message they claim they're
[1:37:05] loose they're more bound than ever
[1:37:08] they're so bound by demons they can't
[1:37:09] even walk away without scratching back
[1:37:11] at the door and haunting and screaming
[1:37:13] and cursing and this that and the other
[1:37:14] why because they're tormented souls
[1:37:16] they're not loosed they're bound
[1:37:25] mercy
[1:37:28] we're going down to this
[1:37:34] as you can see i got way too much
[1:37:42] we could go through many of them as he
[1:37:44] would loose them the woman with a blood
[1:37:46] issue loosed
[1:37:48] blind bartimaeus loosed
[1:37:51] woman at the well loosed
[1:37:55] complete
[1:37:56] the woman the man i love that story
[1:37:59] about the man that was born blind
[1:38:02] he was born in this condition and the
[1:38:04] disciples are even asking is this man
[1:38:06] born blind because he sinned or is
[1:38:08] mom and dad saying he said no
[1:38:11] he said that the glory of god might be
[1:38:12] revealed
[1:38:14] you're wondering why you're going
[1:38:15] through something and so the glory of
[1:38:17] god can be revealed
[1:38:19] in you
[1:38:22] you wonder why you're having to go
[1:38:23] through this difficult trial it's so
[1:38:26] that the glory of god
[1:38:28] can be revealed in you
[1:38:36] and we know the story he's spitting some
[1:38:38] clay putting his eyeballs
[1:38:40] his eye sockets
[1:38:42] and he created the eyeball
[1:38:46] to me that would have told them who that
[1:38:47] was
[1:38:49] ain't no man can do that
[1:38:54] he come
[1:38:55] he coming and created in my boss
[1:38:58] you guys go wash he wouldn't wash and he
[1:39:00] came back seeing
[1:39:02] and asked him who did this
[1:39:05] they called his parents
[1:39:07] they didn't want to get thrown out so
[1:39:08] they said ask him it happened to him he
[1:39:10] said you mean before the world was ever
[1:39:13] formed never has a man been born blind
[1:39:15] given his sight
[1:39:16] and you don't know who that is
[1:39:23] who was blind
[1:39:30] they want to say we're blind because
[1:39:32] we're following a man and you're telling
[1:39:33] you to ask me let me ask you this
[1:39:36] there's never been a ministry like what
[1:39:38] took place in that man that wasn't not
[1:39:40] the ministry of a man that was a
[1:39:42] ministry of christ in a man
[1:39:45] only christ could do the things that he
[1:39:47] did
[1:39:49] oh sure there's been people lay hands on
[1:39:51] the sick and they recover that's part of
[1:39:52] it but the discernments of the heart
[1:39:54] time after that's the sign of the
[1:39:56] messiah
[1:39:59] now i want to ask who's blind
[1:40:01] if you don't know who that is
[1:40:07] but god wants to make a loose to do a
[1:40:09] loosing
