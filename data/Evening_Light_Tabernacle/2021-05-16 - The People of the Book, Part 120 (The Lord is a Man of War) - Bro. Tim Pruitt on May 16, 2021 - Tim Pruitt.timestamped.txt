[53:20] wonderful to be in the house of the lord
[53:22] together
[53:23] all of you that's assembled in the
[53:26] wonderful
[53:26] name of the lord jesus i hope you've
[53:29] come to lift that name high today
[53:32] amen to give him the praise that is due
[53:34] his name
[53:36] and that not just in church that we do
[53:38] that but every day of our lives
[53:40] we surrender ourselves to him to serve
[53:43] him
[53:44] exodus chapter 15 verse 1 then sang
[53:46] moses and the children of israel this
[53:49] song
[53:50] unto the lord and spake saying i was
[53:52] singing to the lord
[53:54] for he hath triumphed gloriously
[53:57] the horse and his rider hath the throne
[54:02] into the sea the lord is my strength
[54:06] and song and he has become my salvation
[54:10] he is my god and i will prepare him a
[54:13] habitation
[54:14] my father is god and i will exalt him
[54:18] the lord is a man of war
[54:21] the lord is his name amen god bless you
[54:25] can be seated
[54:27] that's what we're going to be speaking
[54:28] on this morning is the lord
[54:31] is a man of war
[54:34] and that word lord there in the
[54:38] in the original in the hebrew is
[54:40] actually jehovah
[54:42] jehovah is a man of war and jehovah
[54:45] is his name and then the very name
[54:49] jehovah is implied to all
[54:52] might and all power and so necessarily
[54:55] the strength
[54:56] to prevail in battle
[54:59] and in psalms 24 it says who is the king
[55:03] of glory
[55:04] the lord is strong and mighty the lord
[55:07] mighty in battle and then isaiah 42 and
[55:11] 13
[55:12] said the lord goes forth like a mighty
[55:14] one and
[55:15] he stirs up zeal like a warrior he
[55:18] shouts
[55:18] yes he roars and triumphs over his
[55:21] enemies so god is showing himself as a
[55:25] man of war and he did this in
[55:27] moses day and the book of revelation
[55:30] before the book closes before
[55:34] that he completes the revelation that he
[55:36] gives to john
[55:38] he shows that he is still the man of war
[55:42] in revelation 19 and 11 and i saw
[55:46] heaven open and behold the white horse
[55:49] and him that sat upon him was called
[55:51] faithful and true and in righteousness
[55:55] he that judge and make war
[55:58] so he made war then he makes war now
[56:02] and in the final scene before the
[56:04] millennium we just
[56:06] read about here he comes as a god who
[56:09] makes war exodus 14
[56:12] 14 israel was instructed
[56:16] the lord shall fight for you and you
[56:18] shall hold your peace
[56:21] this scene it opens with the children of
[56:23] israel
[56:24] who were entrapped at the red sea and
[56:27] and their god is reassuring them that he
[56:31] will personally fight for them
[56:34] that they are not in this alone that
[56:37] they are not
[56:37] going through this by themselves israel
[56:41] was not a nation of warriors they had
[56:43] never been
[56:44] trained to fight israel was a bunch of
[56:47] slaves that had just been
[56:49] uh just been set free from their
[56:52] bondage and and of course this
[56:56] this scene opens with the children of
[56:58] israel
[56:59] entrapped and at the red sea and god is
[57:03] telling them
[57:04] you know i'm going to do the fighting
[57:06] for you
[57:07] and and in exodus 23 23 he had told him
[57:11] i will be an enemy unto thine enemies
[57:14] and an adversary unto thy adversaries
[57:18] for my angels shall go before thee
[57:21] and bring thee in and what a comfort
[57:24] that ought to be
[57:25] to people today who have received a
[57:28] message that was brought to us
[57:29] by an angel amen that the angel of the
[57:33] covenant
[57:34] has gone up before us to bring us in
[57:38] that we have not had to walk in a
[57:41] in a in a path of of uh of
[57:44] of confusion but we have been able to
[57:47] walk
[57:48] in the very leadership of god
[57:51] and directed by the holy ghost to the
[57:53] very hour that we're in
[57:56] isn't it comforting to know that as the
[57:58] bible said that
[57:59] he that toucheth you toucheth the apple
[58:02] of his eye
[58:04] now in moses day he showed himself as
[58:06] one who fights
[58:08] his people's battles and later in the
[58:11] generation
[58:11] after moses he was still showing that he
[58:15] was fighting for his people
[58:17] and i want to just assure you today that
[58:19] god is still
[58:20] a man of war he is still one who goes to
[58:24] war
[58:24] on the behalf of his children if he was
[58:27] ever an intercessor he's still an
[58:29] intercessor
[58:30] if he was ever a healer he's still a
[58:33] healer
[58:34] if he was ever delivered he still is a
[58:38] god
[58:38] of deliverance in joshua 23 and 9
[58:42] even after moses had will pass off the
[58:45] scene
[58:46] um joshua could recount that the lord
[58:48] has driven out great and
[58:50] powerful nations before you and to this
[58:52] day
[58:53] no one can stand against you and one of
[58:56] you can put a thousand to flight because
[58:59] the lord your god fights for you just as
[59:02] he promised he would
[59:04] what a comfort what a word that this is
[59:07] especially
[59:08] in the hour that we're living in and and
[59:10] we know that
[59:11] even at the very day of the rapture we
[59:15] are in an
[59:15] hour of entrapment because the bible
[59:19] said that
[59:20] that we that we should pray that we
[59:22] would escape
[59:23] the things that are coming upon the
[59:24] earth so we know that we're
[59:26] surrounded that in the last day that all
[59:29] hell breaks loose against the bride of
[59:32] christ
[59:34] and and so therefore because of that we
[59:37] are entrapped we really can't
[59:38] perpetuate the ages the ages are over
[59:42] we cannot go back you know that is that
[59:45] is now behind us
[59:47] we can't go around it it is it is
[59:50] something we have to face
[59:52] and yet we can't face it so therefore
[59:55] the thing that we have to do is realize
[59:57] that there is a way
[59:59] out of this that we are been commanded
[1:00:02] to
[1:00:02] lift up our head when we see these
[1:00:05] things come to pass
[1:00:06] to lift up our head for our redemption
[1:00:09] draweth
[1:00:10] nigh amen so we're here in the hour
[1:00:13] where
[1:00:14] where our only way up is out of here
[1:00:18] amen our only escape the only way that
[1:00:21] we can give
[1:00:22] make it out of this the mess that we're
[1:00:25] in today that we find ourselves in the
[1:00:27] world in the world condition
[1:00:29] in society and the society's condition
[1:00:32] the only way out of this is is a rapture
[1:00:37] and we're here at a rapture hour now
[1:00:40] here the the five kings and the amorites
[1:00:43] had come against
[1:00:44] israel and you remember in the days of
[1:00:47] joshua
[1:00:48] that that uh as it came to pass as
[1:00:51] a as they were as they were fighting
[1:00:54] against those kings that
[1:00:56] the lord himself cast down great stones
[1:00:59] from heaven
[1:01:00] upon them upon aziac and and they died
[1:01:03] and there were still
[1:01:05] more that died with hailstones in whom
[1:01:07] the children of israel slew
[1:01:09] with the sword it shows again that god
[1:01:13] was fighting for israel it was at a time
[1:01:16] that joshua would command the sun to
[1:01:19] stand still and
[1:01:20] and if the bible would say of that day
[1:01:22] that there had never been one like it
[1:01:24] before or after it that the lord
[1:01:26] hearkened to the voice of a man and and
[1:01:30] for the lord fought for israel
[1:01:33] this is what it has been all down to
[1:01:36] history
[1:01:37] god has always fought our battles
[1:01:41] we're the children of the great most
[1:01:44] high god
[1:01:45] and he is here in this last day to fight
[1:01:48] our battles
[1:01:49] we can see that as he discerned the
[1:01:51] hearts as he made demons to flee
[1:01:54] as demons would tremble in his presence
[1:01:57] and begin to
[1:01:58] call on one another even as the prophet
[1:02:00] would discern
[1:02:02] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:02:04] and would tell of diseases and those
[1:02:06] diseases and sicknesses
[1:02:08] would begin to scream to one another and
[1:02:09] said come help me to get this one to um
[1:02:12] disbelief and they would try to band
[1:02:15] together
[1:02:15] but every time they were defeated
[1:02:19] because again the lord is mighty in
[1:02:22] battle
[1:02:24] amen now at the red sea where we find
[1:02:27] that he said the lord will fight for you
[1:02:29] and you will hold your peace
[1:02:32] only put your trust in god without
[1:02:35] grudging or doubting this is what it
[1:02:37] means
[1:02:38] hold your peace just just put your trust
[1:02:40] in god
[1:02:41] without grudging without doubting now
[1:02:44] it was here at the red sea that israel
[1:02:48] expressed their doubts and their
[1:02:52] fears and their unbelief
[1:02:55] you know it was here that they were
[1:02:57] complaining
[1:02:58] that they were here in the in the
[1:03:01] entrapment they were in
[1:03:02] the enemy coming behind them the
[1:03:05] mountains on the side the red sea in
[1:03:07] front of them
[1:03:08] and how could they ever get through and
[1:03:11] they were they began to scream and
[1:03:13] cry out and say because there were no
[1:03:16] grades in egypt
[1:03:17] has thou taken us to die in in the
[1:03:20] wilderness
[1:03:21] is it is it not this word that we told
[1:03:23] you in egypt
[1:03:24] sayeth let us alone that we may serve
[1:03:28] the egyptians
[1:03:29] for it been better for us to serve the
[1:03:31] egyptian than us to die in the
[1:03:33] wilderness
[1:03:34] can you imagine here they were willing
[1:03:37] to trade
[1:03:38] their freedom amen to remain
[1:03:42] and be slaves down in egypt than to face
[1:03:45] what they were facing at that time
[1:03:48] and they were now expressing their
[1:03:51] doubts and their fears
[1:03:52] isn't that exactly what we do as humans
[1:03:56] i mean we get tested instead of trusting
[1:03:58] god
[1:03:59] we complain am i we we talk about
[1:04:03] uh we talk about our symptoms we talk
[1:04:05] about our
[1:04:06] problems we bemoan the fact that
[1:04:09] god hasn't answered and that we're still
[1:04:12] waiting on god
[1:04:13] and it seemed like he's a million miles
[1:04:16] away and
[1:04:17] my prayers are going up and they're
[1:04:19] empty or they're they're
[1:04:20] not even reaching the ceiling or
[1:04:22] whatever our thoughts are
[1:04:24] and that you know and we forget who we
[1:04:27] are
[1:04:28] in those moments we forget we are the
[1:04:31] sons of god
[1:04:32] and we forget that we're in a battle
[1:04:36] amen look at the unbelief that these
[1:04:38] people exhibited
[1:04:40] and and even when they got down to the
[1:04:43] border of the promised land down at
[1:04:46] cades barnea
[1:04:47] they're still the same thing as the same
[1:04:49] old vicious cycle
[1:04:51] god showed himself god god proven
[1:04:53] himself real
[1:04:55] god coming along and delivering them
[1:04:58] over
[1:04:58] and over and over again and yet they
[1:05:02] turn and they complain and they murmur
[1:05:04] and they doubt
[1:05:06] and by one moment they're on the
[1:05:08] mountaintop and they're shouting the
[1:05:09] victory in the next moment
[1:05:11] they're down in the valley and they're
[1:05:13] complaining about where they're at
[1:05:17] and i want you to know wherever you are
[1:05:19] right now
[1:05:20] you're not there alone there is a
[1:05:24] god that is concerned about you and your
[1:05:27] situation
[1:05:28] no matter how dire the situation is no
[1:05:31] matter
[1:05:32] nobody else has ever had it this bad or
[1:05:35] this situation has never been before or
[1:05:38] there's never been an
[1:05:39] age like this age and there's never been
[1:05:41] a problem like this
[1:05:42] problem but i want you to know god has
[1:05:45] shown himself god
[1:05:46] in every situation every age every time
[1:05:49] every problem
[1:05:51] he's never left his people fighting
[1:05:54] alone
[1:05:57] this is a god who pledges himself
[1:06:00] to his promise
[1:06:03] and i want you to remember as we look
[1:06:06] here in deuteronomy chapter 1
[1:06:08] as moses recounts where they were at
[1:06:11] cadence barnea
[1:06:13] i want you to remember brother branham
[1:06:15] would bring a pentecost and say
[1:06:17] eurocades barnea he would bring and say
[1:06:20] the world is at cades barnea
[1:06:22] and i want to tell you we are right now
[1:06:25] at a time of crossing over
[1:06:28] don't make the cicadas barnea
[1:06:32] make this a time of going into the
[1:06:34] promise
[1:06:37] deuteronomy chapter 1 19
[1:06:40] so we departed horeb
[1:06:43] and went through all the great and
[1:06:46] terrible wilderness
[1:06:47] which you saw on your way to the
[1:06:49] mountains of the amorites
[1:06:51] as the lord our god hath commanded then
[1:06:54] we came to kadesh barnea
[1:06:57] and i said to you you have come to the
[1:07:00] mountains
[1:07:00] of the amorites which the lord our god
[1:07:04] is giving us now notice this
[1:07:08] god is very clear through his prophet i
[1:07:10] am
[1:07:11] giving you this
[1:07:14] this is your mountain these are your
[1:07:17] promises
[1:07:20] amen this is your fruitful lamb
[1:07:23] and i'm giving it to you and i want you
[1:07:26] to know
[1:07:27] god has given you every great and
[1:07:29] special
[1:07:30] promise in his word he's given you
[1:07:33] healing he's giving you deliverance he
[1:07:36] gives the holy ghost
[1:07:38] he gives the power of god amen he gives
[1:07:41] a revelation of the word
[1:07:43] he will no good thing will he withhold
[1:07:46] from them
[1:07:47] who walk uprightly
[1:07:50] and he says the lord is giving this to
[1:07:53] you
[1:07:54] it's yours now
[1:07:57] look he says the lord your god has set
[1:07:59] the land before you
[1:08:01] go up and possess it and as the lord
[1:08:05] god of your father has spoken to you do
[1:08:07] not fear
[1:08:08] or be discouraged so he
[1:08:12] cautions them before the whole thing
[1:08:14] don't fear
[1:08:15] whatever you do god's given to you but
[1:08:18] your
[1:08:18] here's the instructions don't fear and
[1:08:22] don't be discouraged
[1:08:25] not on where you are today but neither
[1:08:28] one has a place
[1:08:30] in the bride of christ she is not a
[1:08:33] people of fear
[1:08:34] god has not given you the spirit of fear
[1:08:38] but a butt of love and a sound mind
[1:08:41] that sound mind is a disciplined mind a
[1:08:44] mind that has been
[1:08:45] trained to take down strongholds
[1:08:48] to pull down unbelief knowing that the
[1:08:52] mind is a battleground
[1:08:54] come on and every one of you will have
[1:08:56] your mind battles
[1:08:57] and every one of you will be the enemy
[1:08:59] will come like a dark evil spirit
[1:09:02] and haunt at you hey man as long as
[1:09:05] you're human and as long as you're in
[1:09:07] this flesh it did jesus
[1:09:09] amen the spirit walked her i didn't take
[1:09:12] jesus present
[1:09:13] here lucifer himself and and challenge
[1:09:17] his his sonship if thou be the son of
[1:09:20] god
[1:09:21] and the devil will come along and
[1:09:23] challenge your sonship
[1:09:25] if you were really a child of god this
[1:09:27] wouldn't happen
[1:09:28] if you were really a son of god this
[1:09:30] wouldn't take place you wouldn't have
[1:09:32] this battle
[1:09:33] you wouldn't have that problem
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] now so you say he instructs

[1:10:10] to have something to calm their nerves
[1:10:13] there's trouble on every hand
[1:10:16] and you were told if it to conquer
[1:10:19] a promise of god to take a hold of one
[1:10:22] of god's promises
[1:10:24] you must not fear so of course the devil
[1:10:26] comes along and that's his weapon his
[1:10:28] fear
[1:10:30] he wants to come there you know in a
[1:10:32] hideous spirit
[1:10:33] come along hunt you hover over you do
[1:10:36] you know what's he doing trying to hold
[1:10:38] you in slavery
[1:10:40] trying to keep you from prop from the
[1:10:42] promise of god amen now
[1:10:44] so he says do not fear or be discouraged
[1:10:48] now
[1:10:49] here in israel came to the edge of the
[1:10:51] promised land and
[1:10:52] we can say this you know right be that
[1:10:55] we are
[1:10:55] right here before the rapture and and
[1:10:58] we're here
[1:10:59] and we we know our land lays just ahead
[1:11:04] amen oh my it's a wonderful land
[1:11:08] that lays right ahead hey man there's a
[1:11:10] new body laying ahead
[1:11:12] there's every every wonderful thing that
[1:11:15] sublime as
[1:11:16] brother branham would say can't match it
[1:11:19] no word can describe it it's
[1:11:21] it's totally uh indescribable you you
[1:11:24] can't
[1:11:25] can't even draw word pictures to be able
[1:11:28] to say what it's going to be like
[1:11:32] and we're right there on the border of
[1:11:34] it
[1:11:39] and now let's go back here for a moment
[1:11:42] and see these people that were
[1:11:44] right on the border and let's hear what
[1:11:47] these men had to say
[1:11:50] because it was though they were not sure
[1:11:54] that what god said was really right
[1:11:59] in exodus 3 and 8
[1:12:03] i want to remind you what god had
[1:12:06] already told them
[1:12:08] exodus 3 and 8 i have come down to
[1:12:11] deliver them
[1:12:13] out of the hands of the egyptians and to
[1:12:16] bring them out of that land into a good
[1:12:18] land and a large
[1:12:20] into a land that is flowing with milk
[1:12:22] and honey
[1:12:24] now god has already told him i have come
[1:12:26] down
[1:12:27] to deliver i want you to know this is
[1:12:31] where the pillar of fire comes to a
[1:12:32] prophet of god
[1:12:34] it parallels the rapture day that we are
[1:12:36] in
[1:12:38] where again a pillar of fire comes to a
[1:12:40] prophet of god
[1:12:42] amen if parallels the lord himself shall
[1:12:45] descend from heaven with a shout
[1:12:47] there is a message and that message is a
[1:12:49] message of deliverance
[1:12:53] come on amen now you know so he says
[1:12:57] i am come down to deliver them
[1:13:01] and i am going to bring them to a land
[1:13:04] that is flowing with milk
[1:13:06] and honey and you know these
[1:13:09] men can't grasp what god has said about
[1:13:13] them
[1:13:15] they just can't believe that a bunch of
[1:13:17] slaves
[1:13:18] would inherit such a land that somebody
[1:13:22] with as many complexes
[1:13:24] as i got as many problems as i have
[1:13:28] could possibly possess that
[1:13:33] you don't know what i've been through
[1:13:34] you don't know the problems i've been
[1:13:36] through you don't know the problems in
[1:13:38] my marriage you don't know the problems
[1:13:40] of my children
[1:13:41] you don't know the problems of my past
[1:13:44] or my ancestry of what men and women did
[1:13:47] back there what somebody did to me you
[1:13:49] don't
[1:13:49] know
[1:13:53] but god knew all of that
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:56] he knew they had been slaves he knew
[1:13:59] they had been mistreated
[1:14:01] he said i saw your affliction but i've
[1:14:04] come down to deliver you
[1:14:08] i haven't come to leave you in your
[1:14:10] affliction
[1:14:11] i have come to deliver you from your
[1:14:13] afflictions
[1:14:16] i'm going to be the lord to heal you of
[1:14:18] all your diseases
[1:14:20] i'm going to be everything a god could
[1:14:22] possibly be to you
[1:14:25] i've come to deliver
[1:14:28] i've come to bring you into a rapture
[1:14:34] and that's what the message is about it
[1:14:37] was about bringing
[1:14:39] divine healing to the people about
[1:14:42] restoring
[1:14:42] faith this is why the angel came
[1:14:46] if you can get the people to believe you
[1:14:50] and man if you can get faith up to a
[1:14:52] level i'll heal
[1:14:55] i mean i can't heal where there is doubt
[1:14:58] and unbelief
[1:14:59] i can do no mighty miracles
[1:15:03] for people who won't believe me so i
[1:15:06] come and i'm sending a gift to
[1:15:08] elevate your faith to give you where you
[1:15:11] can believe
[1:15:13] because you've been wandering around a
[1:15:15] long time in unbelief
[1:15:18] down in egypt's bondage but i've come
[1:15:21] down to bring you to a place of faith
[1:15:24] again
[1:15:25] word that you will believe now remember
[1:15:27] this is what he said
[1:15:28] when the son of man cometh will i find
[1:15:31] church members
[1:15:33] now when i find faith i'm looking for
[1:15:36] faith i'm looking for somebody
[1:15:38] that believed me
[1:15:42] now that's why the angel came
[1:15:46] that's why it comes to profit that's why
[1:15:49] it comes to moses
[1:15:50] he has to get the people to believe him
[1:15:53] and yes is more than delivering more
[1:15:56] than just deliverance from
[1:15:58] us from sickness but it's delivering us
[1:16:00] from
[1:16:01] unbelief
[1:16:04] amen if god can't bring you to a place
[1:16:07] where you can believe for divine healing
[1:16:10] then how is he going to get you to
[1:16:11] believe for rapture
[1:16:15] amen if my you know if i got a sickness
[1:16:18] in my body and and
[1:16:20] you know and there's a situation there
[1:16:23] if i can't believe
[1:16:24] for divine healing that god can is a
[1:16:26] healer
[1:16:28] then how can i believe that god's going
[1:16:29] to rapture me
[1:16:32] are you with me amen now that's that
[1:16:34] that's not the
[1:16:35] to the individual now if you don't have
[1:16:37] faith for this sickness and you die of
[1:16:39] it well you just
[1:16:40] you you couldn't go in the rapture
[1:16:42] that's not what he said he is saying if
[1:16:44] the church if i can't get
[1:16:46] my church to even believe for divine
[1:16:49] healing
[1:16:50] how am i going to get them to believe
[1:16:52] for a rapture
[1:16:54] why healing will only heal that one part
[1:16:56] if i got a bad heart to get a
[1:16:58] get a a better heart or get it renewed
[1:17:00] or
[1:17:01] get the problem fixed but still an aged
[1:17:03] heart
[1:17:05] right amen but that's divine healing you
[1:17:08] know
[1:17:08] and and it lasts as long as my faith
[1:17:11] lasts
[1:17:12] but notice the rapture is is a is a
[1:17:16] healing from the top of the head the
[1:17:17] soul of the feet
[1:17:18] it's the change of the color of the hair
[1:17:20] it's getting rid of the glasses and
[1:17:22] every artificial thing
[1:17:26] hey man well you know somebody told me
[1:17:28] the other day said i
[1:17:30] brother tim they they just put i just
[1:17:32] got a artificial knee and i said well
[1:17:34] you know you can't take that in the
[1:17:35] rapture
[1:17:38] plan on leaving it here
[1:17:44] now so but i believe
[1:17:47] which is sin you know
[1:17:50] we we can see it was there in egypt
[1:17:55] but it's got to be conquered in our day
[1:17:58] in order to have a rapture you know
[1:18:02] and it's a good land let me just say
[1:18:04] again he said
[1:18:05] it's a good land it's a fertile land
[1:18:09] it's a fertile land where plants prosper
[1:18:12] and bloom in abundance
[1:18:15] so much that bees that make their honey
[1:18:17] from it it's sweetness and
[1:18:19] where cows and the goats you know the
[1:18:22] milk's camels give them milk
[1:18:24] from the grass that is nourished by this
[1:18:26] rich soil
[1:18:27] it's a good land it flows with milk and
[1:18:30] honey the pastures are lush
[1:18:33] man there it's a good land can we say it
[1:18:37] today
[1:18:37] it's a good land where there is healing
[1:18:41] and miracles in the holy ghost it's a
[1:18:44] good land
[1:18:46] where we prosper in his abundance and
[1:18:49] tired of its goodness
[1:18:51] and man it's a good land where we can
[1:18:53] raise children up to serve the lord
[1:18:56] amen where our young people can be
[1:18:59] filled with the holy ghost
[1:19:01] amen it's a good land where there are
[1:19:03] sanctified homes
[1:19:05] and good marriages it's a good laugh
[1:19:09] i'm talking about the promised land of
[1:19:11] this world
[1:19:12] is a good land hallelujah
[1:19:17] now so he says in verse 22 he talks
[1:19:21] about
[1:19:22] every one of you came near to me and
[1:19:24] said let us send men before us
[1:19:26] let us search out the land for us and
[1:19:28] bring back word to us by the way we
[1:19:30] should go and
[1:19:32] and of the cities into which we would
[1:19:34] come and
[1:19:35] and i can't help but wonder so why do we
[1:19:38] need
[1:19:38] men to go and give a report
[1:19:42] when god has chosen the land for you and
[1:19:44] said
[1:19:45] it's a good land
[1:19:48] why does trust god why question the word
[1:19:51] why
[1:19:52] why somebody send somebody over there to
[1:19:54] to find out
[1:19:55] if it's really true
[1:19:58] and moses you know he said you know it
[1:20:01] sounded sensible to him said
[1:20:03] the plan pleased me well so i took 12
[1:20:05] year men one man from each tribe they
[1:20:07] departed went to the mountain
[1:20:08] came to the valley of escort and spied
[1:20:11] it out and they took some of the fruit
[1:20:12] of
[1:20:13] the land in their hands and brought it
[1:20:15] down to us
[1:20:17] and they brought that word to us saying
[1:20:18] there's a good land which the lord our
[1:20:20] god has given you
[1:20:23] nevertheless you would not go up
[1:20:27] but you rebelled against the command of
[1:20:29] the lord your god and you complained in
[1:20:31] your
[1:20:32] tents and said because the lord
[1:20:35] hates us
[1:20:42] can you imagine how these words stung
[1:20:45] the almighty
[1:20:47] as it slaps him in his face i mean here
[1:20:50] his great
[1:20:51] love and his compassion has been moved
[1:20:53] for the people
[1:20:56] and they responded said you brought us
[1:20:58] here
[1:20:59] because you hate us
[1:21:07] you brought us out of the land of egypt
[1:21:09] to deliver us into the hand of the
[1:21:11] amorites
[1:21:12] to destroy us i'm going to just tell you
[1:21:14] god didn't call us out of denominations
[1:21:18] for us to die somewhere
[1:21:22] amen god did not call us out and send an
[1:21:25] angel come on
[1:21:26] send the prophet the seventh messenger
[1:21:30] the seventh angel sent a message to us
[1:21:32] to abandon us in the wilderness
[1:21:35] to just let us die here it is because he
[1:21:38] hates us
[1:21:39] because he left us he
[1:21:42] loved us so much he would leave us out
[1:21:44] there
[1:21:45] he wouldn't leave us in sin bondage
[1:21:49] i'm going to bring you out i'm going to
[1:21:51] bring you to a place where
[1:21:52] milk and honey flows
[1:22:01] the honey is sweet and the milk is
[1:22:03] nourishing
[1:22:04] i mean there's there's plenty of it for
[1:22:06] the families
[1:22:08] there nobody goes hungry
[1:22:13] amen everybody is filled to the room to
[1:22:16] the brown
[1:22:17] ever need and supplied i'm a god who
[1:22:20] wants to survive
[1:22:21] all your needs
[1:22:26] where where can we go up our brethren
[1:22:29] have
[1:22:29] discouraged our hearts saying the people
[1:22:31] are greater and taller than we
[1:22:34] and the cities are great and fortified
[1:22:36] up to heaven
[1:22:37] moreover we have seen the sons of anakin
[1:22:39] there now listen
[1:22:41] here again they the problem becomes
[1:22:44] exaggerated in their sight
[1:22:47] there was no wall that was fortified all
[1:22:50] the way up to heaven
[1:22:54] neither did they look like grasshoppers
[1:22:55] in their sights
[1:22:57] they they felt like grasshoppers in
[1:22:59] their own sight
[1:23:00] it's because of how they viewed their
[1:23:03] own self
[1:23:06] is that right and god comes along in
[1:23:09] this day to send a message to you to
[1:23:11] change
[1:23:12] turn your heart where you view every
[1:23:15] promise of god to be true
[1:23:17] and real for you
[1:23:21] and they said we can't take it and that
[1:23:24] evil report discouraged their hearts it
[1:23:26] it demoralized them you see
[1:23:30] it takes faith to fight
[1:23:34] because no one can fight without faith
[1:23:38] are you with me now you might think if i
[1:23:40] have faith then i won't have to fight
[1:23:42] and that's the mistake people make
[1:23:45] that well if i have faith i wouldn't
[1:23:47] have to fight no
[1:23:49] the faith is given to you to fight with
[1:23:53] amen faith is the strength to hold the
[1:23:56] sword
[1:23:58] amen the power to weld the weapon
[1:24:02] the sword is the word but the word is
[1:24:04] useless
[1:24:06] no matter how sharp it is no matter if
[1:24:09] it's
[1:24:10] known to defeat the devil anywhere any
[1:24:13] place
[1:24:13] anytime the sword is useless in the
[1:24:16] scabbard
[1:24:18] the sword is useless as decoration
[1:24:21] the sword is only good it is taken in
[1:24:24] the hand of faith
[1:24:25] and pressed to the heart of the enemy
[1:24:28] that's only time it cuts
[1:24:31] that's the only time it'll break through
[1:24:33] so you might think oh well
[1:24:35] if we had faith brother tim we wouldn't
[1:24:37] have a battle no
[1:24:38] we have faith that's why we fight
[1:24:42] fighters can't fight without faith
[1:24:49] well god gave us the land why ain't i
[1:24:51] got it because you've got to fight for
[1:24:52] it
[1:24:55] but i gave it to you that's all you need
[1:24:57] to know i've given it to you
[1:25:00] that's all you need to know for any
[1:25:02] promise that you're looking for today
[1:25:05] is god gave it to me it's mine
[1:25:11] and he gave me a weapon that is able to
[1:25:14] defeat the devil anywhere
[1:25:15] any place anytime come on and that's the
[1:25:18] word of god
[1:25:21] is that right and i made sure your word
[1:25:24] is sharp
[1:25:26] there never been aids that the world has
[1:25:28] been so sharpened and honed
[1:25:31] amen all the rest of the ages
[1:25:35] has been taken off of it is that right
[1:25:39] amen the things that dulled the sword in
[1:25:41] other ages
[1:25:43] trinity doctrines ideas of man
[1:25:47] creeds of man that would dull the effect
[1:25:50] of the word
[1:25:51] has all been dripped away
[1:25:54] amen god has made sure that it's sharp
[1:25:58] the word of god to be sharp and he would
[1:26:01] show us how
[1:26:02] sharp it was he said it could divide
[1:26:04] between
[1:26:05] soul and spirit it can go right down
[1:26:08] into the very
[1:26:09] most secret parts of man and expose the
[1:26:12] sin thereof
[1:26:16] now you know he gave
[1:26:19] laws concerning warfare
[1:26:23] now the reason i'm talking about this
[1:26:24] because i'm preaching on the lord is a
[1:26:26] man of war
[1:26:28] but if he's a man of war
[1:26:31] his people are a people of war
[1:26:38] so he's going to fight the battle
[1:26:42] but he's not going to fight it in the
[1:26:44] man of galilee
[1:26:48] jesus is not going to come down and
[1:26:50] fight your battle
[1:26:53] not in the nail scarred body
[1:26:56] the only way he's going to come as as
[1:26:59] the holy spirit to come
[1:27:00] use your body
[1:27:04] to face your goliaths
[1:27:08] no preacher can do it nobody else can do
[1:27:11] it it's your battle
[1:27:14] you've got your own battle to win
[1:27:16] there's somebody with me
[1:27:18] amen you've got your old enemy to
[1:27:20] conquer
[1:27:21] you got your own goliath
[1:27:29] oh yeah your demons are unique you
[1:27:31] praise them enough
[1:27:33] nobody's got devils like i got nobody
[1:27:36] fights battles like i fight
[1:27:38] nobody's got problems like i got
[1:27:41] so yeah yours are unique to you but you
[1:27:44] got them i got them everybody's got them
[1:27:47] and you got to fight them
[1:27:54] say i have depression brother tim i ask
[1:27:56] why
[1:27:58] why aren't you fighting it
[1:28:07] you see you can't win a battle without
[1:28:09] fighting
[1:28:11] and faith is not a decoration
[1:28:15] faith is there for you to fight with
[1:28:20] it gives you it's the courage that you
[1:28:22] need to hold on to the promise
[1:28:24] there's laws concerning warfare but
[1:28:26] deuteronomy 2 and 1
[1:28:29] and when thou going start to battle
[1:28:30] against thine enemies
[1:28:32] and you see horses and chariots and the
[1:28:35] people more than thou
[1:28:37] be not afraid of them for the lord thy
[1:28:40] god is with thee
[1:28:42] which brought you up out of the land of
[1:28:44] egypt
[1:28:45] notice here now your enemies
[1:28:48] they got horses and they got chariots
[1:28:53] israel had no horses they didn't have
[1:28:55] chariots
[1:28:56] in fact to the matter is god told them
[1:28:58] even not to have them
[1:29:01] even when joshua would win this battle
[1:29:03] he said i want you to kill every one of
[1:29:05] them and hamstring every horse
[1:29:08] what was it he did not want them
[1:29:10] depending
[1:29:11] on human abilities he wanted them to
[1:29:15] know
[1:29:15] that he was the one that was the force
[1:29:18] in the battle amen
[1:29:22] amen now they've got horses and they got
[1:29:24] chariots that's what they're relying on
[1:29:26] but he says but the lord thy god is with
[1:29:29] thee so they got horses they got church
[1:29:31] but we got god
[1:29:36] amen like isaiah said for these
[1:29:38] egyptians are mere humans
[1:29:40] not god their horses are puny flesh not
[1:29:43] mighty spirits and when
[1:29:44] the lord raises his fist against them
[1:29:47] those
[1:29:48] who help them will stumble and those
[1:29:50] being helped will fall
[1:29:51] and they will all fall down and die
[1:29:53] together
[1:29:55] so this is this is isaiah's prophecy
[1:29:58] when he was telling them
[1:29:59] you're fighting humans now we are
[1:30:00] fighting spirits
[1:30:02] but i want you to know there has never
[1:30:04] been a spirit
[1:30:05] that has ever overcome the name of jesus
[1:30:08] christ
[1:30:11] and it shall be when you come nigh unto

[1:34:34] they said let him return home
[1:34:36] so the hearts of his brother will not
[1:34:39] melt
[1:34:40] like his own because fear and
[1:34:42] discouragement
[1:34:43] is contagious
[1:34:49] you know that you sit down with somebody
[1:34:52] a little while and they're
[1:34:54] they're fearful and all of a sudden you
[1:34:56] get children
[1:34:58] they're they're you know they're
[1:35:00] discouraged and
[1:35:01] you woke up like oh my goodness
[1:35:07] fear and discouragement are contagious
[1:35:12] i want to say if you got anything
[1:35:14] discouraging to say shut up
[1:35:19] i don't want to hear it
[1:35:22] whatsoever is not a faith is of sin
[1:35:27] come on it's time to look in the promise
[1:35:30] of god don't talk fear talk
[1:35:31] faith imagine you know
[1:35:35] listen get your stinking heads out of
[1:35:38] cnn
[1:35:39] and all the liberal stations where
[1:35:43] they're promoting all this fear and all
[1:35:45] this trouble and
[1:35:46] all the liberal media and all the other
[1:35:48] stuff and changing your mind and pulling
[1:35:51] you down
[1:35:54] and if you can't go to school and not
[1:35:57] and and
[1:35:57] tune out you know that the the the
[1:36:01] teachers that will come along they ain't
[1:36:03] know god and they ain't real
[1:36:05] and you know and challenge your beliefs
[1:36:08] and you know
[1:36:09] you know there's nothing to it and
[1:36:10] nothing to religion that's as far as
[1:36:12] they know
[1:36:15] oh man you know it's like a man was
[1:36:17] sitting there one day
[1:36:18] listening to an atheist talk
[1:36:22] brother branham tells this story he said
[1:36:23] he's sitting to an eye point
[1:36:25] this this atheist talk oh there's no god
[1:36:27] i can prove and
[1:36:28] this natalie you know and he was just
[1:36:31] laying out his case
[1:36:33] and a little boy that didn't look like
[1:36:35] he had much sense for sitting over
[1:36:37] eating on an apple
[1:36:41] and listened to him finally he looked at
[1:36:44] him
[1:36:45] and he said hey hey hey sir said uh
[1:36:49] is this apple i'm eating is it sweet or
[1:36:51] sour
[1:36:53] he said i know boy you're the one eating
[1:36:55] it he said that's what i thought
[1:36:59] i mean they don't know there's a god
[1:37:02] because they ain't never had an
[1:37:03] experience
[1:37:05] but i never god i know i've gotten
[1:37:08] healed
[1:37:08] i know a god that's real i know a god
[1:37:11] that delivers
[1:37:13] i see my god in action i seem to
[1:37:18] raise men up from the dead things of sin
[1:37:20] and turn their lives together
[1:37:22] again and make us pay now i see my god
[1:37:26] in action
[1:37:28] you don't know you never taste it but
[1:37:31] all
[1:37:31] taste and seed for the lord is good
[1:37:40] you better have the holy ghost sitting
[1:37:42] on your ear filtering what's coming
[1:37:44] through
[1:37:46] because without the holy ghost it'll
[1:37:48] absolutely twist your mind all around
[1:37:53] well i got television for the news what
[1:38:00] news
[1:38:02] a bunch of filthiness that'll change
[1:38:05] your mind
[1:38:06] make you perverted make you think things
[1:38:09] that
[1:38:10] totally against the word of god make you
[1:38:12] make you listen when you hear the
[1:38:14] prophet's voice it's archaic
[1:38:16] and and something of oh the dark ages
[1:38:19] somewhere
[1:38:23] don't talk fear talk faith now what is
[1:38:26] satan's weapon against you
[1:38:28] doubt unbelief discouragement
[1:38:31] discouragement
[1:38:33] is the loss of confidence
[1:38:38] you're discouraged this morning because
[1:38:40] you lost confidence
[1:38:42] you really lost confidence that god's
[1:38:44] able
[1:38:47] or it's a loss of enthusiasm
[1:38:51] which brother branham said himself in
[1:38:54] 1965 easter seal
[1:38:56] you must never lose your enthusiasm
[1:39:00] so discouragement is loss of confidence
[1:39:02] or enthusiasm
[1:39:05] depression is feelings of severe
[1:39:08] despondency or rejection
[1:39:11] so you know you get
[1:39:15] depressed nobody cares for me
[1:39:19] nobody loves me nobody's ever been
[1:39:22] through what i've been through
[1:39:25] nobody's got time for me nobody cares
[1:39:30] that's a lie not only does god's people
[1:39:35] care
[1:39:38] maybe they can't live with you and be
[1:39:40] with you 24 7 every minute of the day
[1:39:42] keeping you propped up
[1:39:44] that's what you've got the holy ghost
[1:39:46] for
[1:39:49] come on you want a pastor to be your
[1:39:52] holy ghost always there to lift you up
[1:39:54] and always there
[1:39:55] in any moment you know you need to you
[1:39:58] need not a pastor you need the spirit of
[1:40:00] god
[1:40:01] a man will be your comforter in the dark
[1:40:05] times
[1:40:06] but the you know there again the
[1:40:08] depression is feelings are
[1:40:10] of severe despondency or rejection
[1:40:14] and there's so many people feel so
[1:40:16] rejected
[1:40:18] oh you know nobody nobody understands me
[1:40:22] nobody i you know i'm different
[1:40:24] i'm i'm a little peculiar i well
[1:40:28] what you're saying is you're unique well
[1:40:30] all of us are
[1:40:32] i'm unique you're unique every one of us
[1:40:35] we're not cookie cutters
[1:40:37] everybody isn't in the same mold
[1:40:41] is that right amen so you know they're
[1:40:44] there again you you have depression as a
[1:40:47] feeling of
[1:40:48] rejection nobody cares
[1:40:51] god cares
[1:40:54] he cared so much that he become a man
[1:41:01] that his brother philip sang this
[1:41:02] morning on the cross he
[1:41:04] died for me when he died he was doing
[1:41:07] that
[1:41:07] for me god so loved me
[1:41:11] that he gave his only begotten son i
[1:41:14] can't even speak for the world i just
[1:41:16] know what he did for me
[1:41:22] yet he says god's loved the world
[1:41:26] so what is satan's weapon
[1:41:31] against is to try to get you to
[1:41:33] disbelieve or have no
[1:41:35] faith in your weapon
[1:41:38] that will disarm you listen if he can
[1:41:42] get you to believe
[1:41:43] that your weapon is not strong enough he
[1:41:45] has you disarmed
[1:41:49] he disarmed you when when he gets you to
[1:41:52] disbelieve that
[1:41:53] that weapon when you lay that down when
[1:41:55] in that moment when your faith turns to
[1:41:58] jello
[1:42:01] and you put down your sword when you
[1:42:04] quit
[1:42:04] saying it's thus saith the lord
[1:42:07] it's thus saith the lord this is what
[1:42:10] god said
[1:42:11] and he never fails jesus never fails
[1:42:15] jesus never fails when you when you quit
[1:42:17] when you start laying it down
[1:42:20] remember when you stop for just a moment
[1:42:23] and begin to listen to your adversary
[1:42:30] as i've said a lot of people come to me
[1:42:31] and say brother tim the devil's been
[1:42:33] talking to me well that ought to
[1:42:35] stop it right there
[1:42:39] you need not tell me no more if you
[1:42:42] realize the devil's talking to you then
[1:42:44] consider the source please
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:50] the devil's been talking to me okay so
[1:42:52] the devil has he the devil talks to me
[1:42:54] too it's the devil what do you think
[1:42:55] devils do
[1:42:56] devil's torment
[1:43:01] devils don't come and prop me up and
[1:43:03] help me along and make me jolly and
[1:43:05] happy what devils don't do that
[1:43:07] devil's torment devils come along and
[1:43:11] and question my faith they question my
[1:43:13] belief their question believe in who i
[1:43:15] am is the son of god they question the
[1:43:16] word
[1:43:17] devils come along and put every other
[1:43:19] thought above the word of god that's
[1:43:21] what devils do that's devil's work but
[1:43:24] your work is in my name you shall cast
[1:43:26] out devil
[1:43:28] hallelujah you're gonna have to listen
[1:43:31] to him
[1:43:32] shut him up
[1:43:48] then he says i said to you do not be
[1:43:51] terrified or afraid of them this is what
[1:43:53] moses said
[1:43:54] don't be afraid don't be terrified the
[1:43:57] lord who goes with you he will fight for
[1:43:59] you according to all he did for you in
[1:44:01] egypt before your eyes
[1:44:03] and in the wilderness you saw now he
[1:44:05] comes and brings the testimonies
[1:44:08] you saw how the lord your god carried
[1:44:10] you as this
[1:44:12] man carries his son and all the way you
[1:44:15] went until you came to this place you
[1:44:16] saw it
[1:44:18] you saw you saw you didn't make this way
[1:44:22] along you didn't get here by yourself
[1:44:28] you look back over life's journey and
[1:44:30] you realize
[1:44:32] i couldn't have made it by myself it was
[1:44:35] him that
[1:44:36] carried me in the tough times
[1:44:39] i remember years and years ago and of
[1:44:41] course now it's become a plaque and now
[1:44:43] it's on everybody's walls but
[1:44:45] many many years ago in the early 70s it
[1:44:48] came out a little story about
[1:44:50] a man who looked back on life's journey
[1:44:52] remember footprints
[1:44:54] he looked back on life's journey and he
[1:44:56] saw the two
[1:44:58] two sets of footprints in the sand then
[1:45:01] he comes in some of the roughest and the
[1:45:03] most hardest times of his life
[1:45:05] and there was only one set
[1:45:08] and the man's looking back and he said
[1:45:10] lord why is it
[1:45:12] why is it in all of the times when it
[1:45:15] was easy you were right there walking
[1:45:16] with me
[1:45:18] how come when things were going good and
[1:45:21] the paycheck was coming in
[1:45:22] the kitties were well and there was no
[1:45:24] struggles at home and there were no
[1:45:26] problems in the church and
[1:45:28] well why is it you know that you walked
[1:45:30] with me but when trouble came
[1:45:32] in those dark times there's only one set
[1:45:36] of footprints how come you left me
[1:45:39] he said child you don't understand the
[1:45:41] reason you're seeing one set of
[1:45:42] footprints
[1:45:44] because during those times i carried you
[1:45:47] when you couldn't make another step
[1:45:53] when you couldn't put another foot in
[1:45:54] front of you
[1:45:56] i can't pick you up and i carried you
[1:46:00] right through
[1:46:02] he's carrying you this morning
[1:46:05] when you can't make it on your own he's
[1:46:08] there carrying you thank you
[1:46:14] isaiah 63 and 8 says
[1:46:17] for he said surely they're my people oh
[1:46:20] i love it when god says that's
[1:46:21] my people that's my son that's what
[1:46:25] happened when you got the holy ghost it
[1:46:26] was god said
[1:46:27] this is my son i'm pleased to dwell in
[1:46:29] him
[1:46:35] surely they are my people children that
[1:46:37] will not lie in other words children
[1:46:38] ought to be true to me so he was their
[1:46:40] savior
[1:46:42] and all their affliction he was
[1:46:44] afflicted
[1:46:45] think of that you don't go through a
[1:46:48] thing
[1:46:50] that he hasn't hurt with it too
[1:46:56] and the angel of his presence saved them
[1:46:58] in his love and his pity
[1:47:00] he redeemed them and he bear them and
[1:47:02] carried them all the days of
[1:47:06] old
[1:47:08] so here was
[1:47:12] isaiah is saying this but you can just
[1:47:14] name a scripture
[1:47:15] name a time through the scripture that
[1:47:18] he wasn't there
[1:47:18] carrying his church he carried him in
[1:47:21] the dark ages
[1:47:23] he carried him in luther's age he was
[1:47:26] there carrying them in methodist age
[1:47:28] come on
[1:47:29] he was there in the pentecostals on
[1:47:31] azusa street
[1:47:32] he was darren william branham's ministry
[1:47:35] he's right here
[1:47:36] today amen i'm right there with you
[1:47:39] and and i carried him all the days of
[1:47:41] old
[1:47:43] then he says there yet for all of that
[1:47:46] you didn't you did not believe the lord
[1:47:48] your god who went in the way before you
[1:47:50] just search out a place for you to pinch
[1:47:52] your tents
[1:47:54] and to show you the way you should go in
[1:47:56] the fire by day in the cloud by night i
[1:47:59] led you by a pillar of fire you didn't
[1:48:02] get here on your lawn you just
[1:48:04] didn't wonder here you didn't wonder
[1:48:07] aimlessly in the wilderness i
[1:48:09] i picked out the camps for you
[1:48:12] and i brought the church through luther
[1:48:14] and i brought him to wesley and i
[1:48:16] brought him through azusa
[1:48:17] i brought him to the message of the and
[1:48:19] i'm here to take you all the way to the
[1:48:21] rapture
[1:48:27] and the lord heard the sound of your
[1:48:28] words and he was angry
[1:48:30] and he took an oath saying surely not
[1:48:32] one of these men of these evil
[1:48:34] generations
[1:48:35] shall see the good land which i swore to
[1:48:37] give to your fathers
[1:48:40] except caleb the son of jafani and he
[1:48:42] shall see it unto him
[1:48:44] and his children i'm giving the land on
[1:48:46] which they walk because
[1:48:47] he holy followed the lord
[1:48:52] moreover your little ones and your
[1:48:53] children who you say will be victims
[1:48:55] today that
[1:48:56] who today have no knowledge of good and
[1:48:58] evil they shall go in there and to them
[1:49:00] i will give it
[1:49:01] and they will possess it but for you go
[1:49:03] wander in the wilderness
[1:49:05] god reaches a point until he says i'm
[1:49:07] through with your rebellion
[1:49:10] amen oh he would look over and say oh
[1:49:12] faithless and perverse generation
[1:49:15] god wants a people that believes him
[1:49:18] so what a sad ending for people who
[1:49:20] started out so jubilant with a high hand
[1:49:22] but were
[1:49:23] were kept out of the promised land
[1:49:25] because of their unbelief
[1:49:29] you see they received the word but they
[1:49:32] didn't mix it with faith
[1:49:35] you see they wanted a god that was a god
[1:49:37] of war
[1:49:38] but they themselves didn't want to yield
[1:49:40] their bodies to be the one he
[1:49:42] fought through they were willing to
[1:49:45] for god to mow down their enemy but they
[1:49:48] didn't want to
[1:49:48] wield the sword they wanted to have a
[1:49:50] slave mentality
[1:49:52] let somebody else do your fighting
[1:49:56] now god's going to do your fighting but
[1:49:59] he's going to fight through you
[1:50:02] so you're going to be in the heat of the
[1:50:04] battle
[1:50:06] so you don't do you don't don't expect
[1:50:08] to be on a picnic while god does it
[1:50:13] expect yourself to be in the midst of
[1:50:15] the battle
[1:50:16] and god fighting through you
[1:50:19] are you with me this is why he said
[1:50:22] in first timothy 6 12 fight the good
[1:50:25] fight of faith
[1:50:26] lay hold on eternal life where to also
[1:50:29] you're called
[1:50:30] you see this is this is what you have to
[1:50:32] be to be tenacious
[1:50:34] you lay hold on a promise you don't let
[1:50:37] go
[1:50:38] of it if god said i can be healed and i
[1:50:40] can be healed you say i'm 80 years old
[1:50:42] it doesn't matter
[1:50:46] everybody said well i'm 90. that don't
[1:50:47] matter so i'm 100 it don't matter
[1:50:51] or god's a healer regardless of whether
[1:50:53] you're young or whether you're old
[1:50:54] whether you're middle aged whatever
[1:50:56] he's a healer and his promises are just
[1:50:58] as real for you as anybody else
[1:51:00] [Applause]
[1:51:03] god is willing to show up in you
[1:51:08] the moment he can get you to believe him
[1:51:12] let's go back to time where god let him
[1:51:14] out
[1:51:15] these israelites were slaves down in
[1:51:17] egypt
[1:51:18] but then when israel realized who their
[1:51:21] god was
[1:51:23] that he was a man of war then his people
[1:51:26] was supposed to also become a people of
[1:51:28] war
[1:51:31] too long they had lived a defeated
[1:51:33] people
[1:51:34] they had lived in slavery for many of
[1:51:38] them they still had a defeated mentality
[1:51:42] wanting somebody else to care for them
[1:51:47] that lived with their demons they were
[1:51:48] whipped by them every day
[1:51:50] sound familiar
[1:51:55] they looked at themselves as downtrodden
[1:51:58] people who would always be this way
[1:52:02] forgotten people yes they remembered a
[1:52:05] god of history to
[1:52:07] abraham isaac and jacob but it seemed
[1:52:09] that the gods
[1:52:10] of egypt were more powerful
[1:52:14] and they were caught in this situation
[1:52:16] seemed like forever
[1:52:19] but god had given a promise
[1:52:23] amen and he had to do something now to
[1:52:26] turn
[1:52:26] their hearts back to faith does that
[1:52:29] sound familiar
[1:52:30] don't you know why elijah the prophet
[1:52:33] was sin on this day
[1:52:34] to get people to believe it again
[1:52:42] now moses when he looked on him he
[1:52:44] looked on him with different eyes
[1:52:47] he actually disdained being this the son
[1:52:50] of pharaoh's daughter
[1:52:52] and he esteemed greater the the
[1:52:55] the reproaches of of israel than the
[1:52:57] treasures
[1:52:58] of egypt so he looked at them
[1:53:02] with a different eye he he saw them as a
[1:53:05] people
[1:53:06] who god was gonna free
[1:53:09] who were to be liberated who
[1:53:13] had never reached their potentials who
[1:53:16] all
[1:53:16] they had ever known was how to be a mud
[1:53:19] daughter
[1:53:21] and to build something for satan's
[1:53:23] kingdom
[1:53:24] remember moses looked at him with
[1:53:26] different eyes he saw them as
[1:53:28] god saw them when god looked up on him
[1:53:31] he said these are my people
[1:53:33] they are not my daughters they don't
[1:53:36] belong to pharaoh
[1:53:38] they are not slaves they are my children
[1:53:42] and i have come down to deliver them
[1:53:46] the problem is too many people
[1:53:49] look at themselves still as slaves
[1:53:53] servants to failures always defeated
[1:53:57] unable to win a loser
[1:54:05] well brother tim i don't even know why
[1:54:06] i'm here tonight i don't know why you
[1:54:08] can come up in this prayer line i don't
[1:54:10] even know why i'm asking for prayer i
[1:54:11] tell you i've been up here so many times
[1:54:13] why are you coming up
[1:54:16] stay in your seat
[1:54:23] you just couldn't go back another
[1:54:24] failure you come down believing you're a
[1:54:27] failure believing that you know it ain't
[1:54:29] going to happen this sound i'll try
[1:54:31] again
[1:54:31] no don't even try it
[1:54:34] sit there in your cotton picking seat
[1:54:36] until you finally realize
[1:54:38] my god is real my god
[1:54:41] is a healer my god is fine over his
[1:54:45] enemy
[1:54:45] my god will prevail my god will overcome
[1:54:49] my god
[1:54:50] has never failed any place anywhere
[1:54:53] anytime
[1:54:54] and i'm coming down to meet my god
[1:55:10] you got to quit looking at yourself as a
[1:55:11] slave
[1:55:16] i am not a slave to this thing in my
[1:55:19] life
[1:55:20] i'm not a slave to this affliction i
[1:55:24] don't have to live with this monkey on
[1:55:26] my back
[1:55:29] i'm a people who has promised
[1:55:31] deliverance
[1:55:33] amen you can't look at yourself as
[1:55:35] slaves and servants to failures always
[1:55:38] defeated
[1:55:38] unable to win a loser you know david
[1:55:42] realized he was a winner because god was
[1:55:45] on his side
[1:55:47] and man he realized that you know in
[1:55:50] in comparison to the weaponry of the
[1:55:53] enemy
[1:55:54] that you know his his weapon was a
[1:55:57] slingshot
[1:55:58] and the enemies with a big sword and a
[1:56:00] spear and a seer
[1:56:01] you know like a weaver's beam and and
[1:56:03] helmet and all the protection
[1:56:06] and the big shield and all of the the
[1:56:08] ornaments of
[1:56:09] warfare and he he had fought battle
[1:56:11] after battle after battle
[1:56:13] and he knew how to handle himself and
[1:56:15] david's never
[1:56:16] thought nothing but a lion and a bear
[1:56:18] nothing but a lion and a bear
[1:56:26] that's what we look at we look and we
[1:56:29] see
[1:56:30] the enemy but then we judge things as
[1:56:37] well all of that may be true
[1:56:40] but you come to me in the name of a
[1:56:43] philistine
[1:56:46] but i come to you in the name of the
[1:56:48] lord god of israel
[1:56:50] and i am anointed to bring you down
[1:56:54] hallelujah do you know you have been
[1:56:56] anointed for the throne
[1:56:59] to him that overcometh will i grab to
[1:57:01] sit with me in my throat
[1:57:03] even as i overcame i had to fight
[1:57:06] i fought for my throne you fight for
[1:57:08] yours
[1:57:20] but david said this day
[1:57:23] i'm going to feed your carcass to the
[1:57:25] birds
[1:57:27] this day i'm going to take your head off
[1:57:29] and he didn't even have a sword
[1:57:33] he said i'll use the devil's sword
[1:57:38] isn't it about time we turn the thing
[1:57:40] that the devil has been using us
[1:57:41] against him tell him what a defeated
[1:57:45] being
[1:57:45] that he is that he ain't chosen
[1:57:50] that he ain't called that nobody loves
[1:57:53] him
[1:57:54] [Applause]
[1:57:58] ain't it about time that you look back
[1:58:00] at your adversary
[1:58:01] and tell him what he's been telling you
[1:58:06] you was a failure from the beginning you
[1:58:08] were predicted to be a failure at the
[1:58:10] end
[1:58:11] i have been called to be an overcomer
[1:58:14] industry
[1:58:14] i shall rise above every difficulty
[1:58:18] i have not been called to lose i have
[1:58:21] been born
[1:58:22] to win
[1:58:29] i didn't travel in this age to be
[1:58:31] defeated
[1:58:32] i came
[1:58:39] [Applause]
[1:59:00] hallelujah
[1:59:02] david said for by thee by my god
[1:59:06] i've run through a troop and by my god
[1:59:08] i've leaped over a wall
[1:59:09] [Music]
[1:59:11] i've went over insurmountable things
[1:59:15] by my god i've run through the troop of
[1:59:18] death
[1:59:18] by my god i've done all this by my god
[1:59:24] because my god my lord is the lord
[1:59:28] a man of war now god
[1:59:31] brings israel to the red sea they must
[1:59:33] learn
[1:59:35] they must learn something very important
[1:59:39] that you must take note of today
[1:59:43] first corinthians 10 13 says god is
[1:59:45] faithful
[1:59:46] we can preach a whole sermon on that god
[1:59:49] is faithful
[1:59:50] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:59:53] above that which are able
[1:59:55] but with will with the temptation also
[1:59:58] make
[1:59:58] a way to escape that you may be able to
[2:00:02] to bear it so so let me tell you
[2:00:06] he is our escape
[2:00:10] so you're not trapped after all
[2:00:14] he's your escape now
[2:00:17] deuteronomy 33 would say there is no god
[2:00:21] like
[2:00:21] the no one like the the god of jesus now
[2:00:25] that
[2:00:26] word is god's name for israel meaning
[2:00:28] the upright one so
[2:00:29] he says there's no god like the god of
[2:00:31] the upright ones
[2:00:37] so many times we know we've got to pray
[2:00:40] the prayer of faith
[2:00:43] we know the effects of fervent prayer
[2:00:46] of a righteous man availeth much
[2:00:51] so we go to pray and we get reminded of
[2:00:54] our past
[2:00:57] now god doesn't do that the devil does
[2:01:00] that
[2:01:01] he that's he's the adversary so this is
[2:01:04] the weapons of his warfare
[2:01:08] he comes right down you know and he
[2:01:10] reminds you of your past he reminds you
[2:01:12] of your failures he remember
[2:01:13] how many times you tried and failed
[2:01:20] and so you know then then he reminds you
[2:01:25] it tells you you are unrighteous
[2:01:30] now let's talk about this for a moment
[2:01:33] because when our sins are plunged in the
[2:01:35] blood of jesus
[2:01:40] then we are the upright ones
[2:01:44] not because we've done everything right
[2:01:48] but because he even the score
[2:01:52] he crossed out the values his blood
[2:01:56] atoned for
[2:01:57] our loss come on somebody amen dude this
[2:02:01] is what it is
[2:02:02] you know we are the upright one so
[2:02:04] therefore any of us can pray the
[2:02:06] effects of fervent prayer of a righteous
[2:02:09] one
[2:02:09] because you know because our
[2:02:12] righteousness is
[2:02:13] not in our own efforts our righteousness
[2:02:17] is on what
[2:02:18] god did for us
[2:02:24] there's no god like the god of jesus
[2:02:27] who rides across the heavens to help you
[2:02:30] on the clouds in his majesty the eternal
[2:02:33] god
[2:02:34] is your refuge and under needs are the
[2:02:37] everlasting arms
[2:02:38] he will drive out your enemies before
[2:02:40] you say and
[2:02:41] destroy them wait
[2:02:45] he's going to drive him out and he tells
[2:02:47] you to destroy him
[2:02:50] so israel will live in safety and jacob
[2:02:52] will
[2:02:53] dwell secure in the land of grain a new
[2:02:55] wine where
[2:02:56] heavens drop dew blessed are you israel
[2:02:59] who is like you
[2:03:00] a people saved it by the lord
[2:03:04] he is your shield and helper and your
[2:03:06] glorious sword
[2:03:09] your enemies will cower before you and
[2:03:11] you will tread on their heights
[2:03:14] these are the things that god said about
[2:03:16] israel
[2:03:18] and in the book of exodus where we've
[2:03:20] been reading the bible said
[2:03:22] it came to pass in the morning
[2:03:25] watch that's just before the dawn now
[2:03:28] here
[2:03:29] they're surrounded here the enemies
[2:03:32] behind them
[2:03:33] but now just before the morning watch
[2:03:36] just
[2:03:37] just before the dawn in the morning
[2:03:40] watch just before the dawn let me tell
[2:03:42] you
[2:03:42] it's just before the dawn little
[2:03:45] children
[2:03:48] can you hear me amen we are here the
[2:03:51] bible said we'll need a way of escape
[2:03:53] that we should pray always to escape the
[2:03:56] things coming on the earth
[2:03:57] that escape is a rapture amen it was
[2:04:01] impossible to get to a red sea
[2:04:02] it's impossible for you to pick yourself
[2:04:04] up by the bootstraps
[2:04:06] and get out of here
[2:04:09] you know it's going to take a
[2:04:10] supernatural god
[2:04:12] to get you out of the mess you're in
[2:04:14] today
[2:04:16] come on somebody but i want you to
[2:04:18] understand where we're at
[2:04:19] it's morning
[2:04:24] it's morning let me tell you it's just
[2:04:26] before the dawn it's
[2:04:28] the prophet said shalom amen it's the
[2:04:32] greatest darkness ever but it's the time
[2:04:34] when
[2:04:34] the lord capital l ord turns
[2:04:38] his eye upon the enemy so i want you to
[2:04:40] see this
[2:04:41] exodus 14 24 it came to pass in the
[2:04:44] morning watts
[2:04:45] the lord looked unto the host of the
[2:04:47] egyptians
[2:04:48] through the pillar of fire and the cloud
[2:04:51] and troubled
[2:04:52] the host of the egyptians
[2:04:56] now watch these words as we talk about
[2:05:00] it because
[2:05:01] god now waits until the last
[2:05:04] person is across the red
[2:05:08] sea now there was
[2:05:12] several million of them to go across
[2:05:16] but the last one had to finally make it
[2:05:19] over
[2:05:22] come on the last one had to get on
[2:05:26] the other side the last one
[2:05:31] i hope you're hearing what we're saying
[2:05:33] now god waits until the last person is
[2:05:36] safely
[2:05:37] through the red sea now watch
[2:05:41] don't get offended here don't shut me
[2:05:43] down here
[2:05:44] but the red sea represents pentecost
[2:05:48] in the types i'm not talking about azusa
[2:05:50] street
[2:05:52] amen but i'm talking about the book of
[2:05:54] acts church
[2:05:56] i'm talking about the day of pentecost
[2:05:58] i'm talking about the original
[2:06:00] experience
[2:06:01] and god has to let the last person
[2:06:05] get the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:06:11] oh church come on you're one to see the
[2:06:13] lord come oh we want to see him come
[2:06:15] hold at the rapture
[2:06:16] the trouble the trouble get the last one

[2:06:20] [Applause]
[2:06:21] amen don't give up on altar calls don't
[2:06:24] give up on holy ghost meeting
[2:06:26] don't give up on the power of god to
[2:06:28] save the lost
[2:06:30] don't come on don't quit believing for
[2:06:33] your children
[2:06:34] don't be satisfied to leave one of them
[2:06:36] out there
[2:06:37] everybody's gotta come through the red
[2:06:39] sea get up through pentecost
[2:06:42] get about the experience with god
[2:06:45] get them filled with the holy ghost
[2:06:49] because we can't go
[2:06:51] [Music]
[2:06:53] the enemies come on somebody all the
[2:06:56] enemies can't be destroyed
[2:06:58] and are safely on the other side till
[2:06:59] the last one
[2:07:01] comes in
[2:07:05] well there's no more intercessor that's
[2:07:07] the devil's lie
[2:07:08] there's no more mediator that's the
[2:07:10] devil's lie
[2:07:12] come on church amen this is what he was
[2:07:15] doing he was mediating on their behalf
[2:07:17] he began to look down at the sea with
[2:07:20] angry eyes
[2:07:22] he looked at pharaoh and all his army
[2:07:25] was angry
[2:07:28] hallelujah why do you think this message
[2:07:31] was accompanied by a pillar of fire
[2:07:34] come on somebody why do you think that
[2:07:36] night after night he showed himself
[2:07:38] over and over again why do you think god
[2:07:41] looked through diseases through a pillar
[2:07:43] of fire
[2:07:43] that's a devil that's a demon and that
[2:07:46] demon's gotta go
[2:07:47] if i can get him to believe in leaving a
[2:07:50] moment
[2:07:51] hallelujah because he looked at him with
[2:07:54] angry eyes
[2:07:58] and george about to turn his eyes on
[2:08:01] america
[2:08:02] god's about to turn his eyes on on the
[2:08:05] under
[2:08:06] liberal condition god is about to turn
[2:08:08] his eyes on the devil
[2:08:10] [Music]
[2:08:13] and look through the pillar of fire
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:16] now if you're looking through cnn you
[2:08:18] don't see what i'm talking about
[2:08:21] if you're looking through the liberal
[2:08:23] agenda today or even the conservative
[2:08:25] agenda
[2:08:31] god's about to get the last one through
[2:08:34] the last person is about to step
[2:08:37] on the other side then the angry eyes of
[2:08:41] god
[2:08:41] will fasten upon lucifer
[2:08:49] now when i say pentecost
[2:08:52] i don't want anybody to misunderstand me
[2:08:55] i am not talking about azusa street
[2:08:59] this is not a repeat of pentecost for
[2:09:03] the return
[2:09:04] the azusa street movement represented
[2:09:06] that again in that they spoke with
[2:09:08] tongues
[2:09:09] and we are not simply repeating gifts
[2:09:16] and besides all of that let's just get
[2:09:18] some clarification here
[2:09:20] that azusa street was misnamed pentecost
[2:09:25] it was not pentecost
[2:09:28] brother branham goes to great lengths to
[2:09:30] explain that in the church age book
[2:09:32] over and again and even in his sermons
[2:09:35] azusa street
[2:09:36] was not the original grain
[2:09:41] it was not what god planted in the
[2:09:43] beginning returning back to its mature
[2:09:45] form again
[2:09:46] it was only a stage of the plant it was
[2:09:49] a shock and not the grain
[2:09:52] but i want you to understand again
[2:09:55] that the red sea here and i'm going to
[2:09:58] lay belabor this point for a few
[2:10:00] minutes and like i said don't
[2:10:02] misunderstand don't get sidetracked and
[2:10:04] don't get in the wrong direction
[2:10:06] and if you're listening to me out there
[2:10:08] across the land i am not advocating
[2:10:10] going back to azusa street
[2:10:13] and the confusion and the unbelief and
[2:10:16] the darkness and the things and
[2:10:18] and the evil spirits that got in the
[2:10:20] whole movie we're not even talking about
[2:10:22] we're talking about a book of acts
[2:10:23] church
[2:10:25] but i do want to remind you the job of
[2:10:28] malachi 4
[2:10:29] was to turn the hearts of the children
[2:10:31] back to the faith of the pentecostal
[2:10:33] fathers
[2:10:34] and that's what we're talking about
[2:10:37] we're talking about malachi 4 was to
[2:10:40] turn
[2:10:40] our hearts back to that faith
[2:10:48] now azusa street as i said with misnamed
[2:10:52] pentecost it was not
[2:10:54] i want you to understand what pentecost
[2:10:56] is it was what we saw in the book of
[2:10:59] acts
[2:11:00] and it's what god is bringing about in
[2:11:02] this last day
[2:11:04] with his end time message this is
[2:11:07] the jubilee this is the seven
[2:11:11] sevens this is the end of the church
[2:11:14] ages
[2:11:15] in this day the day of pentecost fully
[2:11:18] comes
[2:11:20] pentecost means 50 and there were seven
[2:11:22] sabbaths from the passover
[2:11:24] called the feast of weeks and these
[2:11:26] seven sabbath
[2:11:27] represented seven church ages and when
[2:11:30] you reach the end of the last
[2:11:32] age then the day of pentecost
[2:11:36] or the 50th comes
[2:11:39] and we are in the jubilee of all
[2:11:41] jubilees
[2:11:44] now just quickly let's talk talk about
[2:11:47] the feast for a moment
[2:11:48] so we can understand because brother
[2:11:50] branham talks about this red sea that we
[2:11:53] that we have been preaching about that
[2:11:56] we've said everyone must get through he
[2:11:58] said it's
[2:11:58] pentecost and he said
[2:12:02] passover or this is the way the the
[2:12:05] feasts are
[2:12:06] passover is the feast of salvation in
[2:12:08] both testaments
[2:12:09] the blood the lamb delivers from slavery
[2:12:12] uh the jew from
[2:12:14] from egypt and the christian from sin so
[2:12:16] both of them are delivered from slavery
[2:12:19] and it's no common coincidence that
[2:12:21] jesus was sacrificed
[2:12:23] on the on passover at passover time
[2:12:27] and then egypt the jew marches house
[2:12:29] with the blood of the lamb
[2:12:31] and today every christian
[2:12:34] must mark his house or his body
[2:12:38] the house of his spirit with the blood
[2:12:41] of jesus christ everyone must have
[2:12:45] the token the blood the holy ghost
[2:12:49] now the next day after the passover
[2:12:51] becomes a feast of unleavened bread
[2:12:54] and the leviticus 23 6 it puts the
[2:12:58] second feast
[2:12:59] on the next night on the 15th day of the
[2:13:01] second month
[2:13:03] is a feast of unleavened bread to the
[2:13:04] lord seven days you must
[2:13:06] eat unleavened bread again god laid
[2:13:09] these things
[2:13:10] out in the natural we can look at them
[2:13:13] as a spiritual israel and see ourselves
[2:13:15] in the types
[2:13:16] because once again this type 7 church
[2:13:19] agent because
[2:13:20] seven days we are commanded to eat bread
[2:13:23] without leaven unleavened bread in the
[2:13:25] new testament
[2:13:26] of course is the body of our lord he's
[2:13:29] described as the bread of life he was
[2:13:31] born in bethlehem
[2:13:32] which in hebrews means a house of bread
[2:13:35] and that
[2:13:36] the church is to feast on him
[2:13:39] amen the word of life until he comes
[2:13:41] right
[2:13:42] now and it's to all be unleavened as
[2:13:46] brother branham said seven days what
[2:13:47] does that templify
[2:13:49] the complete seven church ages seven
[2:13:52] days and
[2:13:52] the whole church age from beginning to
[2:13:54] end has
[2:13:56] only to live only on the word of god of
[2:13:58] that
[2:13:59] age so notice again the seven days of
[2:14:03] unleavened bread
[2:14:04] in itself is a type of seven church ages
[2:14:08] where we are to eat on the living
[2:14:10] unleavened bread
[2:14:11] of the body word of the son of man
[2:14:15] each one getting their portion or their
[2:14:17] peace
[2:14:18] broken off for their day now
[2:14:21] then of course comes sunday morning
[2:14:25] following the unleavened bread remember
[2:14:28] morning cometh
[2:14:30] and on that on that sunday morning the
[2:14:32] day after the sabbath
[2:14:34] uh following the unleavened bread it
[2:14:38] it begins the first fruits
[2:14:41] and it's the feast of acknowledging the
[2:14:43] fertility of the land that
[2:14:45] god gave the israelites and they were to
[2:14:49] bring the early crops of the spring
[2:14:50] planting
[2:14:51] and wave a sheep before the lord you
[2:14:54] remember this in the bible
[2:14:55] and of course this celebrates to us the
[2:14:58] resurrection of the lord
[2:15:00] on first fruits which which incur when
[2:15:03] which
[2:15:04] incurred exactly the same time
[2:15:07] that the high priest was waving
[2:15:11] the first fruits on that sunday morning
[2:15:15] out of the dead came the first fruits
[2:15:19] of the resurrection hallelujah
[2:15:23] and he didn't come along but all the old
[2:15:26] testament saints rose with him
[2:15:29] is that right and appeared undemeaning
[2:15:33] or was waived or shown before them
[2:15:36] that the land is good and the word
[2:15:39] is fertile and it comes to pass just
[2:15:42] like he said
[2:15:45] amen hallelujah now
[2:15:48] from the day after that sabbath they
[2:15:51] start
[2:15:51] counting seven days ours
[2:15:55] our 50 days our seven sabbaths
[2:15:58] seven sabbath would be seven times seven
[2:16:01] forty nine the next day
[2:16:02] the jubilee the 50th day is called the
[2:16:05] day of pentecost
[2:16:07] and when the seventh sabbath um since
[2:16:11] when when the seventh sabbath since
[2:16:14] passover
[2:16:15] are the feasts of weeks it began has
[2:16:17] been completed
[2:16:19] now so we know then by all of this
[2:16:23] if i just stop briefly and explain the
[2:16:26] first four fruits reveals
[2:16:28] that jesus was crucified on passover he
[2:16:31] was buried
[2:16:32] on on unleavened bread he was
[2:16:35] raised on the first fruits and 50 days
[2:16:38] later he sends the holy spirit to us
[2:16:41] on pentecost now
[2:16:45] i want to say that even that
[2:16:48] was a type because it was prefiguring
[2:16:53] again what god would do in a gentile
[2:16:56] church
[2:16:57] so we had to pass over 2 000 years ago
[2:17:00] but now we have marked seven weeks and
[2:17:03] now we come back
[2:17:05] to pentecost or to the jubilee
[2:17:08] again are you with me now
[2:17:12] you know so we are now at the end of the
[2:17:15] seventh church age
[2:17:17] which brings us to the end of the feast
[2:17:19] of weeks
[2:17:20] and the beginning of the jubilee it's
[2:17:23] the time where the jubilee trumpet
[2:17:25] sounds
[2:17:26] it's a time where where that um
[2:17:30] that it becomes what is called the day
[2:17:33] of pentecost when it fully comes because
[2:17:36] these weeks have been rolling up
[2:17:40] church ages now rolling up and grinding
[2:17:43] down
[2:17:44] until it finally comes to where it's all
[2:17:47] complete the 50 days
[2:17:49] are complete the cycle is complete
[2:17:52] the church ages are complete and we're
[2:17:55] living in the
[2:17:56] end of the last church age
[2:17:59] there are no more so we're right here
[2:18:02] at the pentecost of all pentecost
[2:18:08] now did you know what the
[2:18:12] did you know that during pentecost
[2:18:16] that the jews read the book of ruth
[2:18:19] every pentecost this is what they read
[2:18:22] the book of ruth now what is it
[2:18:25] it's where the man of war becomes the
[2:18:29] intercessor the go-between
[2:18:31] the kinsmen redeemer and to do that
[2:18:34] christ
[2:18:34] has to put on the garments of warfare
[2:18:39] now his garments of warfare he will take
[2:18:43] on human flesh to become the warrior god
[2:18:48] where he literally fights human
[2:18:52] battles just like you fight
[2:18:55] human battles
[2:18:58] so that there's nothing you go through
[2:19:02] that your general hadn't went through
[2:19:05] there is nothing that you've got to
[2:19:07] conquer that your general hasn't
[2:19:09] conquered for
[2:19:10] you already he showed you
[2:19:13] it can be done and i'm going to lead you
[2:19:17] now into battle
[2:19:19] are you with me now so it's the man of
[2:19:22] war becomes
[2:19:23] the intercessor to go between the
[2:19:25] kinsmen redeemer
[2:19:27] and so christ puts on the garments of
[2:19:30] war let's look at him in isaiah 59
[2:19:32] he saw that there was no man he was
[2:19:36] amazed that there was no one to
[2:19:38] intercede
[2:19:39] isaiah 59 16. so his own arm brought
[2:19:42] salvation
[2:19:44] and his own righteousness sustained him
[2:19:47] and he put on righteousness like a
[2:19:49] breastplate
[2:19:50] and the helmet of salvation on his head
[2:19:53] and he put on
[2:19:55] garments of vengeance oh my
[2:19:58] vision now as kinsmen he is not just
[2:20:01] kinsmen redeemer but he's also kinder
[2:20:05] adventure amen
[2:20:08] so he does purchasing work at calvary
[2:20:12] amen come on redeeming the book
[2:20:15] claiming work and by opening the seven
[2:20:19] seals
[2:20:20] so we're in the days of his claim and
[2:20:22] work
[2:20:23] but he's about to bring forth his
[2:20:26] avenging work
[2:20:28] hallelujah there's going to be a
[2:20:30] tribulation
[2:20:31] for those that trouble you the devil is
[2:20:34] in trouble
[2:20:36] his kingdom is coming down
[2:20:39] did you hear what i'm saying give me a
[2:20:41] little more sound up here brother jim
[2:20:43] amen so he will prepay listen what he's
[2:20:45] gonna
[2:20:46] he's gonna repay according to their
[2:20:48] deeds fury to his
[2:20:50] enemies oh wait a minute amen
[2:20:53] retribution to his
[2:20:54] suppose recompense to the islands
[2:20:58] so that they that fear the name of the
[2:20:59] lord where the sun sets
[2:21:01] and his glory where it rises for he will
[2:21:04] come
[2:21:05] like a raging flood driven by the breath
[2:21:08] of the lord
[2:21:09] oh my this is how he's coming with a
[2:21:11] flood
[2:21:13] against his enemy they lay when the
[2:21:16] enemy
[2:21:16] comes in then like a flood the spear of
[2:21:20] the lord
[2:21:20] lifts up a standard against him
[2:21:24] hallelujah now this is him the redeemer
[2:21:27] will come to zion
[2:21:29] so the redeemer comes to the bride to
[2:21:33] further his redemption work is not that
[2:21:36] he
[2:21:36] ceases redemption he is completing
[2:21:40] redemption he did his purchasing work at
[2:21:43] calvary
[2:21:44] now he does claim and work and he first
[2:21:46] claims the book
[2:21:50] hallelujah that was sealed with seven
[2:21:53] seals
[2:21:55] that no one could look upon until he
[2:21:58] came
[2:21:59] because he was the only one worthy to be
[2:22:02] able to do it
[2:22:04] and he claims the book because it's the
[2:22:06] book of our
[2:22:07] inheritance and when he claims it he is
[2:22:10] claiming it for you
[2:22:12] he is claiming it for me come on
[2:22:15] somebody now
[2:22:16] and then and he claims the people for
[2:22:18] his namesake
[2:22:20] the names that are written in the book
[2:22:25] so as kinsmen he is not only kinsmen
[2:22:29] redeemer to purchase back what we lost
[2:22:32] but he also does the claiming work
[2:22:36] in order that he might be the avenger of
[2:22:40] blood because he's going to pay
[2:22:43] back everything that the devil's done
[2:22:49] i'm telling you friends you're not the
[2:22:51] one in trouble in this age

[2:26:02] now when moses said the lord
[2:26:06] is a man he wasn't a man yet
[2:26:12] but again this was prophesying of the
[2:26:14] incarnation of christ
[2:26:17] for yet he was not really a man although
[2:26:19] he was prophesied a seed would come
[2:26:21] since genesis
[2:26:23] he would be a man amen
[2:26:26] he would come as a man but yet he's not
[2:26:29] a mere man
[2:26:32] but he's a man of war come on somebody
[2:26:36] or a warrior he's one that is
[2:26:38] experienced in war
[2:26:41] amen he's fought with many powerful
[2:26:43] enemies
[2:26:44] satan and his principalities and his
[2:26:46] powers
[2:26:48] the world the great men of it the
[2:26:49] antichrist a warrior that's
[2:26:52] well-vested in all the odds of war
[2:26:56] he's abundantly qualified
[2:26:59] to be the man of war he has achieved
[2:27:02] wisdom and strength
[2:27:04] and courage and thoroughly dress for it
[2:27:07] he's been preparing for this battle
[2:27:12] hallelujah amen and he's dressed for it
[2:27:16] he's got on the helmet of salvation the
[2:27:18] garment of vengeance
[2:27:21] amen a coca-ceo
[2:27:24] he's got a passion about it he's got a
[2:27:27] passion about his pride
[2:27:29] he's got a passion about her deliverance
[2:27:32] he got a zeal he would say the seal for
[2:27:35] my house
[2:27:36] has eaten me up
[2:27:37] [Applause]
[2:27:40] and he's going for concrete and the
[2:27:41] concrete he's a victorious one
[2:27:43] he's conquered sin satan the world and
[2:27:46] he'll subdue others
[2:27:50] and he makes his people
[2:27:54] more than conquerors
[2:27:57] said i'm a conqueror but you're going to
[2:27:59] be more than one
[2:28:01] and he is the captain of the lord's army
[2:28:04] or the host
[2:28:05] he is the leader and commander of his
[2:28:07] people
[2:28:09] he is the general of the armies in
[2:28:11] heaven and earth
[2:28:12] and he's a prince and king at the head
[2:28:14] of them
[2:28:16] he's all of it his alpha and omega
[2:28:19] beginning to the end
[2:28:20] that's a redeemer and he came to dwell
[2:28:24] in us at pentecost
[2:28:29] so like i said at pentecost the story of
[2:28:33] ruth is read
[2:28:34] new story is one of a gentile woman
[2:28:38] an outcast a rejected
[2:28:41] race a reject that comes into the
[2:28:44] promised land
[2:28:46] at barley harvest and becomes married
[2:28:50] to the owner of the field and winds up
[2:28:52] owning the field
[2:29:00] are you with me now amen now in order to
[2:29:03] get ruth
[2:29:05] he has to redeem naomi
[2:29:12] so he comes to the juice
[2:29:15] in order to get a gentile bride and in
[2:29:18] the last day
[2:29:20] he restored israel back to her natural
[2:29:23] land
[2:29:23] while he's restoring ruth
[2:29:26] in her promised land
[2:29:30] somebody with me amen so the first
[2:29:33] pentecost
[2:29:34] now let's go back here the first
[2:29:36] pentecost was
[2:29:37] 50 days after they left egypt
[2:29:41] at mount sinai and mount sinai now that
[2:29:44] was the first official pentecost
[2:29:45] brother branham calls the red sea he
[2:29:47] types it as pentecost
[2:29:49] but you know again literally the real
[2:29:52] pentecost comes the seven weeks after
[2:29:54] that
[2:29:55] they come to mount sinai to the mount of
[2:29:56] god and at the mount of god there
[2:29:59] on mount sinai god gives them the
[2:30:02] covenant of the law
[2:30:03] the second pentecost is where god gave
[2:30:06] his word
[2:30:07] on the day of pentecost the pouring out
[2:30:10] of his spirit
[2:30:11] upon all flesh and gave them
[2:30:15] and and there he espoused to himself
[2:30:19] a bride now remember at mount sinai he
[2:30:23] made a covenant with israel
[2:30:24] and espoused himself to israel we know
[2:30:27] the story
[2:30:28] of israel and her betrayal and her sins
[2:30:31] and
[2:30:32] how god said i've divorced thee and so
[2:30:34] on like that but now you come to the
[2:30:35] second pentecost
[2:30:36] where god gives his word on the day of
[2:30:38] pentecost
[2:30:40] and espouses to himself a bride
[2:30:43] what did paul say you know i feel less
[2:30:46] as a serpent because eve so will the
[2:30:49] satan do the same thing to you and he
[2:30:52] said for i have espoused you
[2:30:54] i've engaged you to a husband
[2:31:00] amen now so we are espoused to him
[2:31:04] to be his bride at pentecost
[2:31:08] listen every person that's why you have
[2:31:11] to have your pentecost
[2:31:13] because it's there that you realize
[2:31:16] that on you has always been
[2:31:19] that wedding band a predestinated
[2:31:22] unmerited grace
[2:31:24] and god opens your eyes to knowing you
[2:31:28] have always been his
[2:31:31] that you didn't come his at the altar
[2:31:33] you always
[2:31:34] were his and he slipped a ring
[2:31:38] of unmerited grace on your finger
[2:31:42] before the foundation of the world and
[2:31:44] he
[2:31:45] called you to be his own
[2:31:48] amen so if you want to be united to
[2:31:50] christ get
[2:31:51] pentecost that's why this is a pentecost
[2:31:54] because it's the invincible
[2:31:56] union of the bride it is where a
[2:31:59] marriage takes place
[2:32:05] now of course the first visits
[2:32:09] mount sinai given the law the second in
[2:32:12] the upper room the given of the spirit
[2:32:14] where god took the law and didn't write
[2:32:17] it in stone but wrought and
[2:32:19] wrote it in tables of the heart the
[2:32:22] third
[2:32:23] now we come to the third see it realms
[2:32:25] and threes
[2:32:26] right first mount sinai second day of
[2:32:29] pentecost third
[2:32:31] this last day where god finishes the
[2:32:34] pouring out
[2:32:36] of his spirit and he takes a people
[2:32:40] in a rapture now the conclusion of the
[2:32:44] weeks of
[2:32:45] unleavened bread the seven church ages
[2:32:48] it's here that god concludes
[2:32:50] his waving as
[2:32:53] in this waving it is a waving of two
[2:32:56] loaves
[2:32:58] and it was it's it's two loaves here
[2:33:01] that
[2:33:01] that has been infused with the life now
[2:33:04] in
[2:33:05] in in other types 11 is a type of sin
[2:33:09] but in this type this 11 is not sin
[2:33:12] this 11 it could even be called change
[2:33:16] you know where you know what what
[2:33:18] happens when when
[2:33:20] god puts his life into you it rises up
[2:33:24] right it rises up swells out
[2:33:28] amen but then you know the the god
[2:33:32] allows through the trials and
[2:33:33] punch you back down and you rise up
[2:33:37] again
[2:33:38] and he punches you back down and you
[2:33:41] rise up again
[2:33:44] amen what's he getting what's he doing
[2:33:46] now he has got his life in you
[2:33:48] god then puts it in the fire and he
[2:33:51] firmly
[2:33:52] completely puts him exactly that way
[2:33:56] unchangeable the breath never falls
[2:33:58] again
[2:34:00] come on somebody now god god does this
[2:34:04] now
[2:34:04] and these two loaves are waved
[2:34:07] before the people the complete covenant
[2:34:10] of law and grace jew and gentile
[2:34:14] and he begins to elevate his pride
[2:34:17] until she raptures this is the day
[2:34:21] where a bride is elevated
[2:34:25] she's being waved now this is
[2:34:30] he's already started this elevation by
[2:34:32] showing signs
[2:34:34] wonders miracles by taking the seals off
[2:34:37] the book of the inheritance
[2:34:39] as he gives to ruth the gentile bride
[2:34:42] the
[2:34:42] full inheritance somebody said full
[2:34:45] inheritance
[2:34:47] now this is now becomes the jubilee
[2:34:50] of all jubilee or the pentecost of all
[2:34:53] pentecost
[2:34:55] now this fulfills the 50th year in the
[2:34:57] bible
[2:34:58] where the lands that were lost due to
[2:35:00] indebtedness returns back
[2:35:02] to its original owners this fulfills the
[2:35:06] 50th year
[2:35:07] where slaves throw down their shovels
[2:35:10] and lay down their hoes and go free
[2:35:14] and this is a jubilee where all who have
[2:35:16] been in the bondage
[2:35:18] of mortality crippled and in chains
[2:35:21] of mortal weaknesses thrown down their
[2:35:24] shovels

[2:37:04] even as he has done in our day
[2:37:06] [Applause]
[2:37:09] one day his eyes are going to turn
[2:37:11] toward the mortality of my body
[2:37:31] now in our day we saw diseases exposed
[2:37:34] and trembled when he looked through the
[2:37:35] pillar of fire
[2:37:37] we saw sin exposed false doctrines
[2:37:40] exposed
[2:37:41] you think that's something when he looks
[2:37:44] down to the bill of fire upon death
[2:37:46] and the shackles of age oh my

[2:38:16] pentecost
[2:38:18] we're in the day of stepping over into
[2:38:20] eternity
[2:38:21] the day of pentecost where is the time
[2:38:24] of marriage
[2:38:25] where the seals are taken off of the
[2:38:27] inheritance
[2:38:29] and the names are called of the redeemed
[2:38:33] do you hear what i'm saying amen if
[2:38:36] you're elevated
[2:38:37] you have been caught up out of
[2:38:38] laodicea's
[2:38:40] lukewarmness in the glories of the
[2:38:43] throne where the book is open
[2:38:45] and you see yourself there as the people
[2:38:48] of the book
[2:38:50] revelation 5 and 9 i want you to turn
[2:38:53] with me
[2:38:54] we're trying to get this down to close
[2:38:56] we're going to let you out by two
[2:38:57] o'clock
[2:38:58] on my part and that's never a promise
[2:39:04] amen revelation 5 9 and they sung the
[2:39:08] new song
[2:39:09] moses sang one hello
[2:39:12] at the red sea moses sang a new song
[2:39:16] pentecost is where you sing a new song
[2:39:21] come on amen and they sung a new song
[2:39:24] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[2:39:29] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[2:39:31] slain
[2:39:32] and has redeemed us to god by the blood
[2:39:36] out of every kindred and tongue and
[2:39:39] people
[2:39:40] and nation and we ain't slaves no more
[2:39:44] [Music]
[2:39:45] because thou has made us into our god
[2:39:47] kings and priests
[2:39:49] and we shall reign
[2:39:53] hallelujah not in heaven on the earth
[2:39:57] we will reign right here because we are
[2:40:00] kings and priests and we have a dominion
[2:40:04] look what the lord has done remember the
[2:40:07] red sea the song of moses
[2:40:09] that was pentecost brother branham told
[2:40:12] us that
[2:40:13] in exodus 15 6 thy right hand o lord
[2:40:17] has become glorious in power thy right
[2:40:19] hand oh lord
[2:40:20] hath that's in pieces the enemy
[2:40:24] amen but look over here here's another
[2:40:26] pentecost
[2:40:27] at the finishing of the seven ages well
[2:40:31] watch now
[2:40:32] verse 11 of revelation 5 and i beheld
[2:40:35] and i heard the voice of many angels
[2:40:38] round about the throne
[2:40:40] and the beast and the elders and the
[2:40:42] number of them
[2:40:43] oh they were ten thousand times ten
[2:40:46] thousand
[2:40:47] and thousands of thousands saying with a
[2:40:50] loud voice
[2:40:51] worthy is a lamb that was slain to
[2:40:54] receive
[2:40:55] power and riches and wisdom and strength
[2:40:58] and honor and glory and blessing amen
[2:41:01] and every creature which is in heaven
[2:41:03] and on the earth
[2:41:04] and under the earth and such are in the
[2:41:06] sea and all of them
[2:41:08] heard i say it blessing and honor and
[2:41:11] glory and power be unto him that sitteth
[2:41:14] upon the throne and unto the lamb
[2:41:17] forever and ever brother they were
[2:41:19] having
[2:41:20] a jubilee they were having a pentecost
[2:41:23] and i tell you what if the opening of
[2:41:25] the seal doesn't bring you to a
[2:41:27] pentecost
[2:41:28] you went to a theology but you didn't
[2:41:30] see the book open
[2:41:32] because when the book is opened by the
[2:41:34] lamb and you see your name there
[2:41:36] hallelujah then you know the promise is
[2:41:39] yours
[2:41:39] and then enough devils in hell gonna
[2:41:42] keep you from it
[2:41:44] hallelujah pentecost was the second
[2:41:47] harvest
[2:41:48] the wheat harvest and we're here at the
[2:41:50] final harvest
[2:41:52] the first harvest was barley and the old
[2:41:54] testament ended with the coming
[2:41:56] of the old the messiah and the
[2:41:59] resurrection of the dead now
[2:42:01] seven seven weeks later seven church
[2:42:04] ages later
[2:42:05] comes pentecost and it's harvest time
[2:42:08] and the new testament ends
[2:42:10] with the coming of the messiah and the
[2:42:12] resurrection of the dead in christ
[2:42:15] amen so the last church will be a
[2:42:18] pentecostal church
[2:42:22] don't hang up on me let me quote your
[2:42:24] prophet
[2:42:25] he said the original church at pentecost
[2:42:28] with the power of god
[2:42:29] mark 16 an action is the true church
[2:42:33] that jesus claims as his own all else is
[2:42:36] false
[2:42:37] christ in the true church is a
[2:42:39] continuation
[2:42:40] of the book of acts well you said but
[2:42:43] that was
[2:42:44] then but what a what if the vine ever
[2:42:46] puts up with another branch brother tim
[2:42:48] well puts it forth another branch here's
[2:42:50] what he said if the vine never puts
[2:42:52] forth another branch of
[2:42:53] itself that branch will be exactly like
[2:42:56] the branch itself
[2:42:57] it will be the same kind of branch that
[2:42:59] brought forth on the day of pentecost
[2:43:01] it will speak in tongues and prophesy
[2:43:04] and have the power
[2:43:06] and the signs and the resurrected christ
[2:43:08] jesus christ in it
[2:43:10] amen may you get it you take that up
[2:43:12] with the prophet of god that's what he
[2:43:14] said the church would be like
[2:43:15] amen and he said dust what was the
[2:43:18] what the church was at pentecost is the
[2:43:21] standard
[2:43:22] that's the pattern there is no other
[2:43:25] pattern
[2:43:26] so i don't know what you're patting your
[2:43:28] church is after
[2:43:29] amen but the real church will be
[2:43:32] patterned
[2:43:33] and right after a book of acts a new
[2:43:35] testament
[2:43:36] church a people of the new covenant a
[2:43:38] people who knows their god
[2:43:40] or people who have been to the upper
[2:43:42] room of people that have been
[2:43:44] filled with the holy ghost or people who
[2:43:46] knows that power
[2:43:47] who lays hands on the set and they shall
[2:43:50] recover
[2:43:50] that in his name they cast out devils
[2:43:53] they speak with new tongues
[2:43:59] and even if they drink any deadly thing
[2:44:01] it won't hurt them
[2:44:05] the true church will always try to be
[2:44:09] like the original at pentecost
[2:44:11] what are we trying to be like today the
[2:44:14] frozen chosen
[2:44:17] what are we trying to be like a morgue
[2:44:20] what are we trying to be like today come
[2:44:24] on church
[2:44:25] the true church will always try to be
[2:44:28] like
[2:44:29] the original of pentecost the true
[2:44:31] church today will try to approximate
[2:44:33] the early first one the messengers to
[2:44:36] the churches
[2:44:37] having the same spirit of god in them
[2:44:39] will try to approximate
[2:44:41] the apostle paul the promise i'm just
[2:44:45] i'm just reading some of these one right
[2:44:46] after another these are all from the
[2:44:48] church age book
[2:44:49] the promise of power with the apostles
[2:44:51] were endued at pentecost
[2:44:53] is to you jews and to you
[2:44:56] your children jews and to all there are
[2:44:59] far off
[2:45:00] gentiles amen and as many as the lord
[2:45:03] our god shall call both jew and gentiles
[2:45:06] and until he stops calling the
[2:45:09] pentecostal message and power
[2:45:11] will not cease
[2:45:14] amen so it's pentecost where a church of
[2:45:18] all nations comprised of two loaves
[2:45:21] jew and gentile is waves
[2:45:24] before the people god elevates that
[2:45:28] church
[2:45:31] now what the church had at pentecost is
[2:45:34] her
[2:45:34] inalienable right originally she had the
[2:45:37] pure worthy god she had the power
[2:45:39] of the spirit manifested in diverse
[2:45:42] signs and wonders gifts of the spirit
[2:45:45] and if the church is the true church
[2:45:47] it'll have the same spirit
[2:45:49] and word and acts of power that they had
[2:45:52] at pentecost
[2:45:53] by experience oh we don't need
[2:45:57] experience well by experience it will be
[2:46:00] a pentecostal church
[2:46:02] and there will be tongues and
[2:46:05] interpretation
[2:46:06] and prophecies and healings and god will
[2:46:10] be in the midst of her
[2:46:11] and god will declare himself in the
[2:46:13] midst of her
[2:46:14] as he always has hallelujah
[2:46:18] amen in this last age there will be a
[2:46:21] group rise up the true bride of the last
[2:46:23] day
[2:46:24] she'll listen to the spirit in that day
[2:46:26] of gross darkness the light will return
[2:46:28] by the pure word
[2:46:30] and we will return to the power of
[2:46:32] pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus
[2:46:34] christ
[2:46:36] what's wrong with our fundamentals they
[2:46:38] have no power
[2:46:39] for they stop short of pentecost the
[2:46:42] church is no longer the mouth of peace
[2:46:44] of god it's his own mouthpiece
[2:46:46] so god is turning on her and he will
[2:46:48] confound her
[2:46:49] through the prophet and the bride for
[2:46:51] the voice of god will be in her
[2:46:53] yes it says in the last chapter of
[2:46:55] revelation verse 17
[2:46:56] the spirit and the bride say come once
[2:46:59] more the world will hear from god
[2:47:02] as at pentecost but of course that word
[2:47:05] bride
[2:47:06] will be repudiated as it was in the
[2:47:09] first age
[2:47:10] but what about the true seed it will
[2:47:12] happen just as we said
[2:47:14] the people of god are being made ready
[2:47:16] by the word of truth from the messenger
[2:47:18] to this age
[2:47:20] ever will be the fullness of pentecost
[2:47:23] for the spirit will bring the people
[2:47:25] right back
[2:47:26] to where they were at the beginning that
[2:47:29] is thus saith the lord
[2:47:32] and it's here when the last one
[2:47:38] like the last israelite
[2:47:41] passed through the red sea
[2:47:44] when the last member of the bride
[2:47:48] has had their pentecost
[2:47:52] you can't go in the rapture
[2:47:55] without having your own pentecost
[2:47:59] amen when the last member comes in
[2:48:03] then the rapture will go is that right
[2:48:07] amen now let's let's just come to our
[2:48:11] close now
[2:48:13] exodus 14 24 it came to pass
[2:48:16] in the morning watch the lord looked
[2:48:20] to the host of the egyptians to the
[2:48:23] pillar of fire
[2:48:24] and the cloud now listen
[2:48:29] trouble always comes sickness comes on
[2:48:33] every hand
[2:48:35] but when when it does the angel of god
[2:48:39] goes out between you the bible would
[2:48:42] describe
[2:48:43] the pillar of fire went and stood
[2:48:45] between
[2:48:47] israel and the egyptians
[2:48:51] so they did not come near each other
[2:48:54] all night so now
[2:48:57] when sickness when trouble
[2:49:01] comes before you the pillar of fire goes
[2:49:05] to stand
[2:49:06] between you challenging you
[2:49:10] to take god at his word
[2:49:13] amen now that's what he does he gets
[2:49:16] there
[2:49:17] to make a way but standing between you
[2:49:20] and trouble
[2:49:20] even brother branham told his death he
[2:49:22] said to every believer
[2:49:24] born again child of god when death comes
[2:49:27] stealing at your door
[2:49:29] prematurely the angel of god stands
[2:49:32] between
[2:49:33] you and the sickness now if you want to
[2:49:35] run right on to it that's your business
[2:49:38] but you don't have to he's standing
[2:49:41] between you
[2:49:42] and death he was the go between them
[2:49:46] he's the go-between now he was the
[2:49:49] mediator then
[2:49:51] he is the mediator now he was the lamb
[2:49:54] then he is the lamb now amen let me just
[2:49:58] tell you in case you're
[2:49:59] thinking he's no more lamb and he's
[2:50:02] already turned lying
[2:50:03] listen let me tell you even in the even
[2:50:06] in the
[2:50:07] in the in the ages ahead when he's with
[2:50:10] his people
[2:50:11] he's the lamb
[2:50:14] when he's with him on 144 000 the lamb
[2:50:18] is with his people the lamb amen the
[2:50:21] bible
[2:50:22] said that they have to face the wrath of
[2:50:24] the lamb
[2:50:26] the lamb is still there interceding on
[2:50:29] behalf
[2:50:29] of the remnants and somebody with me
[2:50:33] the lamb is that but you say he's a lion
[2:50:36] oh yeah
[2:50:37] my husband he's a liar
[2:50:40] man when the enemy comes that man he's
[2:50:43] ferocious
[2:50:44] he roars and then he's got cheese he
[2:50:47] bites
[2:50:48] amen he tramples down he destroys
[2:50:52] the man the king is a lion but when i
[2:50:55] look at him
[2:50:55] i don't ever see him as a lion i see him
[2:50:58] as my lamb
[2:50:59] he's the lamb of god slain before the
[2:51:02] foundation of the world he's melchizedek
[2:51:05] both king and priest
[2:51:08] intercessor then intercessor now
[2:51:11] in fact i want to show you
[2:51:14] the position of the lamb revelation five
[2:51:18] and six
[2:51:20] and i beheld i looked when you get
[2:51:22] elevated
[2:51:24] by revelation into this place you look
[2:51:27] and i beheld and i lo in the midst of
[2:51:30] the throne and the four beasts
[2:51:33] in the midst of the elders
[2:51:37] stood a lamb
[2:51:40] as had been slain
[2:51:43] i want you to notice as he
[2:51:47] takes the book he is stood
[2:51:51] he stands to claim his inheritance
[2:51:56] he's been sitting as mediator and his
[2:51:58] blood's still atones
[2:52:02] listen his purchasing work is not
[2:52:05] ineffective because he's not on the
[2:52:07] cross anymore
[2:52:08] he's still doing the purchasing work
[2:52:11] somebody help me
[2:52:12] yes he purchased you at calvary by his
[2:52:15] bud but he actually did that before the
[2:52:17] world
[2:52:17] began but in time you met him in an
[2:52:21] altar and there you found out
[2:52:22] he purchased your salvation amen
[2:52:25] now but watch now he stands and he
[2:52:29] stands there
[2:52:30] as a lamb and he takes
[2:52:34] the book as a lamb
[2:52:39] amen oh i want you to get this because
[2:52:42] he's a lamb
[2:52:43] he's our intercessor he is our mediator
[2:52:47] as a lamb he's our go-between as a lamb
[2:52:51] he is there as a redeemer as a lamb
[2:52:55] he is a kinsman is somebody with me
[2:52:59] now watch this this parallels
[2:53:02] daniel chapter 12 because
[2:53:05] in the bible says at that time
[2:53:09] michael come on somebody michael
[2:53:12] his name is archangel whose name means
[2:53:15] who is like jehovah an angel who is like
[2:53:18] jehovah
[2:53:20] my goodness he was there in the pillar
[2:53:22] of fire he was there down to the ages
[2:53:25] and he was always like jehovah
[2:53:28] and we saw him in a pillar of fire and
[2:53:30] it was the same jesus
[2:53:31] that was on that met paul on the road to
[2:53:33] damascus
[2:53:35] one like jehovah come on somebody
[2:53:39] and then that time shall michael stand
[2:53:42] up
[2:53:47] and i looked and i saw a lamb
[2:53:54] now look at the parallel michael
[2:53:57] standing
[2:53:58] the archangel and now the lamb standing
[2:54:03] what's now the great prince
[2:54:07] which standeth for the children of thy
[2:54:09] people
[2:54:12] oh and there shall be a time of trouble
[2:54:14] such as never was since there was a
[2:54:16] nation
[2:54:17] until that same time but in that time of
[2:54:21] trouble
[2:54:22] at that time shall thy people be
[2:54:25] delivered
[2:54:26] everyone whose name is found
[2:54:30] in the book that was sealed with seven
[2:54:32] seals and you couldn't look at it until
[2:54:34] it was open
[2:54:35] until a lamb stood
[2:54:39] and when michael stands up it is a time
[2:54:42] of deliverance
[2:54:45] don't you realize what the rapture is
[2:54:47] it's a deliverance
[2:54:48] don't you realize what the resurrection
[2:54:50] is is a deliverance
[2:54:52] do you realize everything that god's
[2:54:54] done in this age has delivered i
[2:54:56] have come down for deliverance
[2:54:59] when the lamb stands up it's pentecost
[2:55:02] again
[2:55:04] hey man it's like the red sea where god
[2:55:06] stands up and looks to the pillar of
[2:55:08] fire
[2:55:09] it's like the day of pentecost when god
[2:55:11] comes down and looks to that pillar of
[2:55:13] fire
[2:55:13] and gives each one a lick of his own
[2:55:16] life
[2:55:17] and you're free you're not a slave
[2:55:19] anymore
[2:55:20] can i preach this for a moment men let
[2:55:23] me
[2:55:24] let's just look and see what happened in
[2:55:25] pentecost and i want you to equate it to
[2:55:28] where we are now
[2:55:29] with an open book with our names
[2:55:32] revealed
[2:55:33] with heaven come on and if you're you
[2:55:36] say brother
[2:55:36] but i'm in the earth no if you are a
[2:55:39] believer you are in heavenly places
[2:55:42] in christ jesus is that right if you're
[2:55:45] there you see a lamb that's taken the
[2:55:48] book
[2:55:48] has opened the seals and it's made you
[2:55:51] rejoice
[2:55:52] come on you're not some dead dragon hope
[2:55:55] so anymore
[2:55:57] you're somebody that's got victory
[2:55:59] because you see your name in the book
[2:56:02] and the book has been opened and every
[2:56:04] promise is now
[2:56:05] mine
[2:56:09] let's look for a moment let's look down
[2:56:12] here
[2:56:12] men men 120 of them
[2:56:17] in the upper room who were a lifetime of
[2:56:20] slavery
[2:56:22] they were now free from the bondage of
[2:56:25] sin
[2:56:27] peter that denier who exalted his cursed
[2:56:31] flesh
[2:56:32] over jesus christ and denied the lord
[2:56:36] three times
[2:56:38] and chose his own self over his lord
[2:56:43] now so his ego and his pride
[2:56:46] all conquered and dead and drowned
[2:56:50] in the red sea at pentecost
[2:56:55] that enemy that had troubled peter all
[2:56:57] his life
[2:56:58] and gave him that o ego and that pride
[2:57:03] and then turned into be a denier
[2:57:06] when the time when the trouble come and
[2:57:09] that thing that made him like that in
[2:57:11] the time of trouble
[2:57:13] now was gone
[2:57:17] and at pentecost that enemy was dead
[2:57:20] and peter jumps up on the bus and he
[2:57:23] said this
[2:57:24] is that which the prophet joel spoke up
[2:57:28] for in the last days god will pour out
[2:57:30] his spirit
[2:57:31] upon all flesh and he just poured it out
[2:57:34] on me
[2:57:34] my ego is gone my pride is gone my
[2:57:37] ambition is gone
[2:57:38] my cowardness is gone and now i got the
[2:57:41] keys to the kingdom
[2:57:44] at pentecost and man thomas the doubter
[2:57:47] wasn't a doubter anymore
[2:57:50] amen at the red sea pharaoh looked on as
[2:57:53] as his mighty army drowned his captains
[2:57:56] his chair tears
[2:57:58] his best cherries the wheels come on and
[2:58:00] it pentecost
[2:58:01] men saw lust that enslaved him drowned
[2:58:05] in the sea
[2:58:06] amen men saw slave addictions
[2:58:09] to drug and alcohol drowned in the sea
[2:58:13] of god's great forgetfulness now there
[2:58:16] was a new stimulant
[2:58:17] as new wine had been poured into new
[2:58:20] bottles
[2:58:21] come on church on the day of pentecost
[2:58:23] god had a 120
[2:58:25] new wineskins hallelujah that had just
[2:58:29] been made new
[2:58:30] and they were sitting there with their
[2:58:31] bottled necks up
[2:58:33] waiting for the outpouring amen waiting
[2:58:36] for the outpouring
[2:58:37] and here it came when this holy spirit
[2:58:40] fell from heaven
[2:58:41] and began to feel little bottles 120 of
[2:58:44] them with the holy ghost
[2:58:46] hallelujah that new wine began to work
[2:58:49] on the inside of them
[2:58:50] and bubble up on the inside of them and
[2:58:52] they bounced out on the street come on
[2:58:54] somebody
[2:58:55] they were drunk in the spirit they were
[2:58:57] intoxicated with a new wine
[2:59:00] amen what revival they were having you
[2:59:03] see that's god's order
[2:59:04] amen because when the pentacles come
[2:59:08] it brings a revival and if the message
[2:59:11] of the hour don't bring you a revival
[2:59:13] you're in the wrong message you're
[2:59:15] hearing the wrong voice
[2:59:17] it should cause a revival and an
[2:59:19] enthusiasm and get rid of your
[2:59:21] discouragement
[2:59:24] hallelujah and what happened when they
[2:59:26] bubbled out there
[2:59:28] they went right down the street just a
[2:59:30] bubbling over
[2:59:31] and they found a crippled man there at
[2:59:33] the on the side that the gate called
[2:59:35] beautiful
[2:59:36] and they said we don't have silver and
[2:59:38] gold but we got something
[2:59:39] there's something there's a light
[2:59:41] pulsating in us
[2:59:43] hey man just reach here and we're gonna
[2:59:45] give you what we got
[2:59:46] amen and when it happened that man went
[2:59:48] down screaming and shouting
[2:59:50] and glorifying god why he was having his
[2:59:53] own pentecost now
[2:59:54] he had his own liberation he was set
[2:59:57] free
[2:59:59] at the red sea satan saw his army
[3:00:03] with his powers of the horse and the
[3:00:07] riders
[3:00:08] thrown into the sea his best
[3:00:11] horses well-bred champions
[3:00:16] tangled in their harness tied to a
[3:00:19] chariot like an anchor
[3:00:21] drowned in the midst of the red sea
[3:00:25] at this pentecost we see white
[3:00:29] red black pale horses
[3:00:32] and his riders drowned exposed
[3:00:35] uncovered powerless
[3:00:38] it has no hold on you it's rider
[3:00:42] is death and it's dead in the sea
[3:00:46] a man laodicea where this lukewarmness
[3:00:49] has no power
[3:00:50] its forms has no power its creeds have
[3:00:53] no
[3:00:53] power its dumbness have no power no more
[3:00:57] does it have
[3:00:58] power over no more can they champion
[3:01:00] over us
[3:01:02] man made theology has no more
[3:01:05] power you pastors out there you say to
[3:01:09] me brother tim
[3:01:11] why is it our people are not advancing
[3:01:15] why is it their heads are stuck in
[3:01:17] movies
[3:01:18] why is it there's no faith among people
[3:01:20] why is it
[3:01:21] people won't come to church anymore why
[3:01:24] is it they ain't fervent known fire
[3:01:27] why is it that the sick aren't healed
[3:01:30] and young people are denied their
[3:01:31] pentecost
[3:01:33] brother tim we got the word we got the
[3:01:34] full word it's the word brother tim
[3:01:37] that's not the word let me just say it
[3:01:39] again that's not the word that's a cold
[3:01:42] dead theology and man your spiritual
[3:01:45] thermometer
[3:01:46] of your church is about 40 degrees below
[3:01:49] zero
[3:01:49] that's not the word the word has life
[3:01:53] the word has power amen if the book
[3:01:56] unsealed does not bring you to a
[3:01:58] pentecost where sin is dead
[3:02:00] and the flesh is denied it's still in as
[3:02:03] powerless
[3:02:04] and worthless as a as a denominational
[3:02:06] creed out there
[3:02:08] hey man you know better you've been just
[3:02:10] as well to stay in a denomination
[3:02:12] somewhere
[3:02:13] it shows you're not a part of the
[3:02:14] elevating
[3:02:17] of the chief of the harvest grain
[3:02:21] and you're certainly not a part of the
[3:02:22] waving
[3:02:24] because when he elevates you he lifts
[3:02:27] you up
[3:02:28] where all your sin is dead your tempers
[3:02:32] are gone
[3:02:33] your pride is gone your sins are gone
[3:02:37] the lust demons are dealt with no more
[3:02:41] do you have to pull them out of
[3:02:42] pornography
[3:02:43] don't even have to have a keeper on
[3:02:45] their own on their tablets or on their
[3:02:47] computers
[3:02:48] they got a keeper in their soul and man
[3:02:51] they can never go around they can never
[3:02:53] rise up above
[3:02:54] they can never kick out because once it
[3:02:56] seals it seals you to the day of
[3:02:57] redemption
[3:02:58] they don't want to be free from it they
[3:03:00] are happy
[3:03:02] amen they're part of the bride age
[3:03:06] aren't you glad to be a part of that ace
[3:03:09] part of the waving
[3:03:12] stand together as the musicians come now
[3:03:15] for the bright age for resurrection out
[3:03:19] of dark denominationalism
[3:03:21] will be a message
[3:03:26] anybody want to hear what the message is
[3:03:28] about

[3:03:34] for the bride ate how many believes
[3:03:36] we're in the bright h
[3:03:40] for the bright age for out of our
[3:03:43] resurrection
[3:03:44] out of dark denominationalism
[3:03:49] will be a message that the full maturity
[3:03:54] of the word has turned back again in its
[3:03:56] full power
[3:03:58] and being waved over the people by the
[3:04:00] same signs
[3:04:01] and wonders that he did back there
[3:04:05] that's the message the message is is the
[3:04:08] word is here
[3:04:08] in its full power and it's being waved
[3:04:11] over to people
[3:04:13] amen by the same signs and wonders that
[3:04:16] he did back there
[3:04:17] because i live you speaking to his wife
[3:04:20] shall live also
[3:04:22] what a resurrection that was 2 000 years
[3:04:25] ago
[3:04:26] when he was way before the people in the
[3:04:28] resurrection and what a resurrection
[3:04:30] this
[3:04:30] is when we're resurrected out of cold
[3:04:32] dark denominationalism
[3:04:34] back to the word again he was waved to
[3:04:36] them the word which he was
[3:04:38] and waved to them on the day of
[3:04:39] pentecost the word is made manifest
[3:04:42] and as i say is to be waved again
[3:04:45] in the last days
[3:04:49] don't tell me your anti-word things
[3:04:53] don't come and repeat the dogmas of
[3:04:57] the formal denominationalism of a christ
[3:05:00] yesterday and not today
[3:05:03] don't come along and say well
[3:05:06] we got the perfect word now and so
[3:05:10] now those like prophesying and in
[3:05:13] tongues and
[3:05:14] all that is all done away with because
[3:05:16] we got the perfect word
[3:05:18] that's not what he's saying he says that
[3:05:21] which is perfect has come
[3:05:23] and when that which is perfect has come
[3:05:26] then just having part of it
[3:05:28] is done away
[3:05:32] longer do we just have part of
[3:05:33] justification or sanctification or
[3:05:35] gifts but when we got the word we got
[3:05:39] out of it
[3:05:44] amen don't tell me
[3:05:47] you're childish that those things are
[3:05:50] thought childish
[3:05:51] because we're now so mature the message
[3:05:55] that came to us was waved over us
[3:05:57] it spoke in tongues it prophesied it
[3:06:00] healed the sick
[3:06:01] it made the cripples walk it opened the
[3:06:04] eyes of the blind it's a message
[3:06:06] that the full maturity of the word has
[3:06:08] turned back in its full power
[3:06:10] and has been waved over the people by
[3:06:12] the same wonders
[3:06:14] signs and wonders he did back there and
[3:06:16] that the son of god is alive again
[3:06:18] with the baptism of the holy ghost right
[3:06:21] among us
[3:06:22] and has given us life life
[3:06:27] michael has stood up
[3:06:31] the lamb has stood up he stands now and
[3:06:35] looks too angry eyes
[3:06:38] through the pill of fire he's turning on
[3:06:41] your enemy now
[3:06:43] he's turning on that enemy of mortality
[3:06:47] he's about to change you
[3:06:51] he's staying he's looking right down
[3:06:54] upon the dead in christ
[3:06:56] with angry eyes where death has laid him
[3:06:58] down in the grave
[3:06:59] year after year of year but there comes
[3:07:02] a time
[3:07:03] he looks then through the pillar of fire
[3:07:09] and all the way back from this age back
[3:07:12] to paul
[3:07:13] the last that went down will be the
[3:07:16] first
[3:07:18] each age will call its brethren and as
[3:07:20] each one calls its brethren
[3:07:22] as the voice of god ripples through the
[3:07:24] bride calling the resurrection
[3:07:27] the dead in christ shall rise
[3:07:33] we're living in the greatest hour that
[3:07:34] there's ever been
[3:07:37] because our god is a man of war
[3:07:44] he's looking at your enemy today
[3:07:48] he's got zeal that he's cut himself with
[3:07:53] he's got righteousness on his breast
[3:07:57] he's got a cloak of vengeance he's
[3:07:59] dressed
[3:08:02] to chase your adversary and i will be an
[3:08:05] adversary against your adversary
[3:08:08] and i will be of enemy to your enemy
[3:08:11] and one of you shall chase a thousand
[3:08:14] for the lord your god will fight for you
[3:08:17] and you're not here fighting alone
[3:08:19] anymore little children
[3:08:21] for i am here in the midst of you in the
[3:08:23] pillar of fire
[3:08:24] and i'm here infusing faith into the
[3:08:26] hearts of people and send a message to
[3:08:28] turn your heart back from unbelief to
[3:08:30] believing again
[3:08:34] and i've seen my name in the book
[3:08:38] and when michael stood up all those
[3:08:41] whose names were in the book
[3:08:46] rises
[3:08:48] he calls for those names
[3:08:57] father
[3:09:00] you men of war this morning you actually
[3:09:03] became a man
[3:09:05] not a second person not a third person
[3:09:08] but the person not some minor god under
[3:09:12] god
[3:09:13] the lord god almighty
[3:09:17] the jehovah the old testament is the
[3:09:19] jesus of the new
[3:09:22] it was god just changing his mask same
[3:09:25] god all the time
