we appreciate you we thank you for your grace that you bestowed upon us in such a time as this bless your word tonight we ask it in jesus name amen amen we can turn our bibles to hebrews 13 and verse 8. amen also again the first kings 18. amen it's good to be in the house of the lord good to be with believers of like precious faith amen to feel the surge of the holy ghost as we gather our lick of fires together amen that's why it's important to be in the house of god together amen in the times that we're living in amen so you can gain courage to press on amen hebrews 13 and verse 8 says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever also first kings 18 and 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god amen we let you be seated i'd like to read this quote again as as it would be played to me from my ipad as i would minister it brother ron spencer's something that's really been speaking to me in the last few days be okay it would come from the worst center in the city you'd say my favorite hymn the background of it you would know that how it came about my friend brother booth cleburne wrote that on his knees by inspiration in the cornfield one night with pasteboard pieces in the bottom of his shoes for soles on his shoes and he sold it to wycliffe for one hundred dollars and taking the taking the copyright of the song he said but that's my favorite of the hymns it expresses the extreme deity of the lord jesus and especially in a day like this when they try to make him just a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was god and this word extreme extreme deity no brother tim ministered some years back on a god who does extreme things but the extreme deity of the lord jesus you know i got to looking at the word extreme it means to exist in a very high degree it's to go to great or exaggerated links it's exceeding the ordinary or the usual or the expected and i have to say this is exactly what had happened in that moment as i stood there in his ministry ministering that god came in a very unexpected way at an unexpected time and it exceeds the ordinary the usual or or the expected and i would like to speak to you tonight on jesus christ the same extreme deity extreme deity you know as we look at this scripture of elijah as he would make the decree or make the lay it all out between him and the prophets of baal that they would beats build an altar and they would and they would you know do whatever they wanted to it and put a sacrifice on it but they said but elijah would make this this one statement that would bring the difference between who he was and who they was was let the god who answers by fire let him be god now this would be extreme this would be this would not be just lighting a fire it wouldn't be just you know your normal thing but it was beyond even what a human could even comprehend and it would be an extreme thing it would go exceeding it would exceed the ordinary or the usual or the expected and they said this is a good thing you know the children of israel this is a good thing let the god who answers by fire let him be god and we know the story is how the prophets of baal they would get their stuff together and they would begin to dance and shout and scream and cut themselves and elijah would actually begin to uh rebuke them or even make fun of them as they would do this and he would tell them you know maybe god's out there on a vacation or maybe he's doing something they'll scream a little louder amen because he knew of where he was standing he knew he served the one true living god amen that this god could do exactly what he said he would do and so and elijah and confidence would bring it to a place and he would bring the altar and it would very type out our elijah in this day how he'd bring all the loose sins together and all the broken pieces back together place the stones back in their place the wood back in his place everything in exact order according to the word of god and he would he would bring the waters upon it he would do all these things and then he would stand back and he said if i've done all that you have asked see brother brandon would pick this up he said see elijah had saw a vision he saw god had spoke to him to tell and told him exactly what to do and how to do it and he said see he and he said see he come and he come to this moment but it still had to take the fire of god he could ask for it he could speak about it he could talk about it but it had to take the fire of god to come down upon the altar and burn up the sacrifice and that as we read that's exactly what took place god done the extreme and he showed a sign and a wonder amen amen to to bring the people's attention back to himself that i am truly god bale's not god he couldn't answer he couldn't he if he couldn't answer this simple request he can't do anything for you but i can answer this and so therefore if i can answer this request i can do what i said i will do amen so you know i began thinking about the different things through the through the old testament how god showed extreme he showed the extreme deity not just uh not just himself but extreme deity took it beyond ordinary of course god himself is beyond ordinary but amen he took it even to a point that people couldn't they couldn't say anything about it they couldn't question it they couldn't you know they had to say this was god amen and so we of course you know it begins with the very creation of all things the sun the earth the universe that we live in today actually expresses his extreme deity that when you know we look at that universe that we live we've talked about it how that they have looked with their best instruments and they've come to the conclusion maybe not exact conclusion but to their best ability to say that if they could go out to the furthest point they don't think they could ever get to it because it's almost unlimited or is unlimited amen because it's showing or expressing his extreme deity amen who he is and and what he's doing amen so as we would read in the scriptures in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth his word began to speak and it became the past amen as sun began to form earth began to form stars upon stars upon stars unlimited amount of stars began to be put in their place and he began to express himself as brother branham would say he wrote his first bible in the heavens and he expressed himself in a place to be an extreme god who can do extreme things and so you know the greatest miracle that is the creation of all things and this is what even john 1 would say in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he was in the beginning with god all things were made through him and without him nothing was made that was made so the greatest miracle is the creation of all things his deity his extremeness his greatness his vastness everything that he is is expressed in his creation amen it shows and it shows all the way down through the bible his deity how he can move how he could orchestrate how he could bring something so unbelievably to pass to where amen it would it would blow the minds of men that were there amen i know men today wants to look at it and say it wasn't happening but the men that was there could say this truly was god this truly was god and he would show it in abraham and sarah hey we'd call him out of a nation and he would say come walk with me and he would give him a promise of a son and and it would again it seemed like this promise would linger and linger until amen abraham and sarah was even well past childbearing and well past the ability to produce amen life and and god would come in such an extreme way that he would change their bodies they meant to receive the promised son how he would give them the promise and and though their body be dead and and lifeless and and it seemed impossible his word his deity his extreme deity would still prevail it would it would be it was extreme to take an old man an old woman and change them into such a place that they could give birth to a child amen the burning bush was an extreme expression of his deity that god could come down and light a bush on fire and it'd not burn that was a expression of some self it was a sign it was a wonder it was showing who he was it was pointing to something amen amen we would see the ten plagues that would take place and and it would bring about the uh the freedom of israel out of egypt and it would show his extremeness and how he could create frogs and fleas and dust out of dust and out of nothing and turned water into blood and do and darkness upon the earth and and the death angel and all that it was showing his extreme deity it was showing who he was amen of course the red sea he would bring them to that place and that would have definitely would show who he was and you know the morning i was woke up to this as brother branham would speak these words he would say stand still and see the salvation of god he said what was he doing he was expressing himself in that moment of need and he was making the red sea stand to attention as his people walked through it it was expressing his extreme deity it was expressing who he was and how he was a deliverer and how he could make a way where there seemed to be no way how he could open up things that seems impossible and how he can move mountains and how he can move seas it was showing who he was and who he is and he would show himself as he would turn bitter waters into sweet and drinkable waters and he would show himself as he would he would go down and he would feed people out of adam quail and manna that fell from heaven and he would it would show himself how he would deliver them from their enemies and how he'd move in a in a moment he would he would show himself as he would make them bring come break them come to the moment of crossing the jordan when it was out of his banks and and it seemed impossible but yet god always makes the possible or the impossible possible and it would tell them to take me and be in faith and to step into the water and that water would move back again as he did at the red sea it was showing the same god today is the same god that was yesterday he was showing himself he was extreme his extreme deity these are extreme things this is not your normal things it's not your explainable things these are extreme it's beyond the usual amen until where he would come to the jericho and and it seemed impossible seemed too high it seemed too wide it seemed to too great and then and he would tell them and give them the instructions and they would follow him and they would give a shout and the walls would fall down he was showing himself i'm god over every situation he would show himself in the sun that would stand still as joshua was trying to get his victory over his enemies and he was saying look i need more time i'm not done with this battle they're going to get away if it goes dark son you stand still moon you don't move and it will so amen it may go beyond your thinking and your imagination but it happened anyhow and god showed who he was in that moment [Music] amen in his battles he would show his deity where he would reign hail stones and he would send hornets he would set and b ambushments he would send angels you know to where even one angel would come into the camp of the syrians and kill 185 000 one angel oh come on somebody we're talking about the greatness of our god tonight and who he is amen he would put words even in a donkey's mouth that's extreme that's that's beyond human comprehension amen it was so far beyond that even the man that was riding him didn't even catch it for a few moments it was so extreme amen his anointing is would fall upon a man named sham guard to where that man with an ox goat could kill 600 philistines he would it was so extreme that his anointing would fall upon a man and a man named simpson and he would kill a thousand philistines with a jawbone his anointing was so extreme that it would fall upon a young boy and it would kill a goliath with a sling and a stone his deity would sustain widows and doubts or in droughts it would give barren women children he would stand in the lion's den and shut their mouth he would stand in the fire and three hebrew children would talking about your god tonight would stand up through fire and three hebrew children would walk out without even a smell of smoke and to think that deity came down into flesh how striking it is to know that he wasn't he wasn't satisfied with being able to just send down hail stones and and be able to put this over here and do this over here he wanted to come down himself the extreme deity he said brother was saying he said how striking it is that god himself would come become a baby that god so loved the world that one of the greatest scriptures there is the love of god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life the very dust that he created on earth he became that dust the extreme deity of god stepped into the flesh and was called emmanuel not just god above us god with us hallelujah changing his his form or his face or his mass from god to man he said he stretches tents from the stars of heaven down to live here on earth with filthy creatures as we are the love of god he said how striking it is to be as for a sinner it ought to be to a sinner to know the little jehovah crying in his mother's arms little jehovah not not a polished up angel or polish of an angel he came as abraham's seed he came as a man he never came down to the golden corridors of heaven if it would it would have been for the rich but he was born in a manger so poor he had to borrow a womb so poor he had to borrow a place to be born but when he left he had a border grave to be buried in jehovah emmanuel amen the extreme deity of god is that a super son god sent prophets he sent signs he said everything but he said i'll give you a super sign this sign is going to be me myself i'm coming down to dwell among you to be called emmanuel he said that ought to strike the people himself be made flesh and dwelt among us born in a dirty stinking stable little jehovah not laying in a pink basket in a hospital room but a stinking manger over a manure pile in a barn emanuel the creator of heavens and earth emmanuel the swat on the cloth of emmanuel oh hallelujah little jehovah playing as a child jehovah as a teenager jehovah as a carpenter it ought to strike us amen it ought to strike us that it was god veiled in flesh and extreme expression of his deity and he showed who he was because he came and he had the same power and the same anointing and the same abilities [Music] hallelujah he would see people that was walled in by spirits of hell and he would break down those spirits and set that person free he would see people bound by all kinds of things uh their blinded eyes that story that blind man when they would walk up to him and always has been one of my personal favorites of how he was born blind and and the disciples asked did he sin or did his mother or daddy sin that this man is born by blind and he said jesus said no but that the glory of god may be made manifest why are you going there through things church because that the glory of god might be made manifest why are we having trials why are we having a situation so the glory of god might be made his extreme deity might be shown to a dying world that he is still the same yesterday today and forever this is why the man was born blind so i can show people who i am he said i don't want to serve a god like that well then serve the devil he does it too he tears your body apart with drugs and alcohol to show who he is i'd rather be born and lifted up out of this old mary clay to that god can show amen the manifestation of himself even if it may be extreme it may seem impossible it may seem like a million miles from happening but god works in impossibilities i mean how many impossibilities are we looking at here tonight impossible that you're here tonight impossible that you heard the cry of god impossible that you would even want to know more about god but you're here why because god went past what was impossible and made it possible showing you who he is brother bryan will tell the story about a woman while he's preaching on the deity of jesus christ he said mr branham he said i appreciate your preaching but one thing i don't agree with you she said what's that i like his reply she said there's one thing i don't agree with you he said what is it sister if there's just one thing i'm thankful to meet you because usually it's about a hundred things she said well there's one thing outstanding of course you belong to church that didn't believe in the deity of christ just like when i see today when they go to push him back and just make him a prophet she said you may you brag too much about jesus you make him divine i said he was divine it couldn't be divine i can prove it to you about your bible it was it wasn't divine so i'd like to see you do that all right take your bible and turn to saint john 11. all right i know what you're going to say and she said jesus on the road down to raise lazarus up by the grave the bible said he wept i said sure he said well now how can he be divine and weep i said that was the man part weeping that's right but you failed to see that he was emmanuel he was both man and god i said he was going he was a man going to a grave weeping but when he pulled them little shoulders back together and said lazarus come forth that man had been dead four days stinking came forth and lived again that took more than a man he was a man when he came off the mountain that night hungry looking on a tree to find something to eat but when he took five biscuits and two fish and he fed five thousand that was more than a man that was the creator jehovah at work again he was a man when he was laying in the ship that night and ten thousand devils of the sea swore he would drown him bats bouncing him up there like a bottle stopper and when waves coming up he was tired from preaching until he couldn't even move they didn't even wake him but once he was aroused and went forth he put his foot up on the bow that boat and looked at that storm right in the eye and said peace be still and there wasn't even more than a ripple that took more than a man that could steal the waves of the sea it was a man that cried for mercy at a cross my god my god why has that forsaken me but on easter morning when he broke the seals of death hell in the grave and he rose up again and said i am he that was dead but i'm alive forevermore that was more than a man that was god in man expressing his extreme deity he said every man that ever amounted to a hill of beans believes that so if you don't believe that tonight you don't even mount to a hill of beans you don't know where you're standing at you don't know who's standing among you that's truly what it is you don't know who's standing among you you want to make him just a prophet or or a lower part of the godhead or something second but second part whatever he he was god veiled in flesh the extreme deity he would show it over and over even though you know he didn't come with a salute from heaven he he didn't come as an angel he didn't come with this big applaud or anything like that he came down amen as abraham's seed to show that last day super sign of god to make a supersede a super race a race that has been promised abraham's race to bring forth a supersede that we've been talking about a super christ what did he do with him to him when he would come to earth they made fun of him they called him called the spirit that was working in him a devil it's a devil it's beelzebub a fortune teller but they failed to realize who was veiled behind that flesh it was a super sign he rose up again on the third day for he trusted the word of god hello deity trusted his own word he trusted his own word david has spoken under inspiration he said i'll not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption therefore jesus knew that the scripture spoke of him that he wouldn't see corruption corruption sets in about 72 hours on a dead body we know that we know he knew sometime between that he would raise from the dead and he rose prophets were signs that but they died and went into a grave but jesus was a superside amen expressing the extreme deity of god building flesh oh my that same deity that would open up the red sea and it would it would call hailstones down it would it would do all kinds of things extreme it would come now in this flesh and it would cost stan at a friend's grave and call him back to life again it would heal the lame it would heal the halt it would heal the sick it would give ice to the blind he showed that indeed the jehovah of the old is jesus of the new it's the same power it's the same anointing it's the same works it's the same life it's the same god hallelujah and to think that that god was not happy just being in one flesh amen he wants to show himself in an extreme way at extreme times amen to show that he's god and the same deity fell on about 120 in the upper room filled them with the power of god and they went forth to heal deliver and set free god's people why it was the same deity are you with me tonight it's the same god it's the same god at work it's the same god moving it's a it's the same now it's not just one body it's 120 bodies and it's breaking out and it's breaking out and it's breaking out what god is expressing himself as a portion of deity is actually being placed in every person by the holy ghost i'm about to use this mic brother tim my voices ain't got it his extreme deity being shown now that was not just god above us it wasn't just god with us it's now god in us this is why he would say i'll be with you even in you amen it's one thing for god to be with you it's another thing for him to be in you because it makes him a very personal god amen a very personal savior a very personal one that can move on your need and for your situation to where you're no longer saying yeah he did it there and he did it there and he did it there but god's doing it here god's moving here god's touching here god's changing lives here hallelujah he said some of them thinks he's a little baby back there but he's the one that stood on the invisible platform and reached out and said let there be light and there was light that was jesus christ for he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not but i recognize him i recognize that he's still the same guard that answers by fire and i recognize he's still the same god that heals every disease i recognize he's still the same god that'll take the violent sinner and cleanse her life and fill him with the holy ghost and a part of god be dwelled on the inside he's still that same kind of god he said that was jesus christ for he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not he was that he is the deity of god look what he did back there he said you talk about the miraculous you talking about shouting when he performed the miraculous things to make those things which are now out of things that were not he spoke it and it was so hallelujah the son at one time was not this earth that you're on today at one time was not but he spoke and it was so he spoke it and it took to it came into form it might have took a meal you might have took a billion i don't know it might have been one day i don't know how long it was really didn't matter to an eternal creature time only matters to us it don't matter to god but god spoke it and it happened he brought it to pass by his word he said oh he brought something that is now out of something that was not that ought to be that ought to give us confidence that if we're standing upon something that is now that was not then what it what what is now can be not amen god can take something in your situation that seems to be so impossible and make it in a moment disappear he can take something in just a moment and change the whole scene he's an extreme god that does extreme things we got a witness right over here amen at one moment a cancer victim at another moment a free daughter of god totally free and set free and delivered and not even a sign of it anymore oh hallelujah he has the same power because he's the same christ he said let them people who deny the power of god say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in the people that's got the holy ghost it's in those people that's got the holy ghost men and women it's time you realize who you are come on now this is a service we're going to realize who we are we're not some little trodden down somebody that's not who i am no more i'm no longer a dope head i'm no longer a drug head i'm no longer a slave to sin i i'm no longer a slave to a devil but i've met the same god that spoke this world into existence and he brought life into my body and i know he's got the same power [Applause] so the devil's trying to hide you back and tell your little somebody a little trotting down something you're not you're sons and daughters of god deity is now not in heaven it is in you we're talking about his extreme deity it would be extreme when that deity would fall on 120 so extreme that two would walk to the gate called beautiful and say silver and gold have i none but such as i have give unto thee and that lay man jumped to his feet he's the same god he's got the same power he has the same authority deity's not in heaven it's in you he said i know you think i'm crazy you'll tell but let me tell you something brother when you realize almighty god lives in you my life my god life of god lives in you he stood back there the creator of all things he made life frogs ducks chickens animals created everything nothing that was made but nothing was made but what was made by him christ the deity he brought down the plagues down into egypt who christ the deity he stopped the mouse of lions who christ he quenched the violence of the fire who christ he escaped the heads of the sword they raised the dead from a grave who did that christ the deity and brother and sister that deity is in you a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age it's christ in a manger no christ in you we're not worship him in a manger we're worship him in a man a man and a woman a daughter of god is that why he'd say what two or three are gathering in my name there i'll be who brought him here you did amen and god himself dwelling in the human being people around here saying they're christ in the church of christ churches of christ they go to what happened jesus is around christmas time he said they opened their christmas presents looked at this at the other had a big box of beer no room for jesus all beer opened up mama's deck of cards no room for jesus all cards it's a little bible or something to the children it's a little bit of this book or that no room for jesus he said but we want that deity of god by the holy spirit come into our hearts it calls everything out that christ hasn't created did you catch that christ the hope of glory in you not in a cradle in you that was one time that was at one time but now it's not there it's here amen god was back in the beginning when he came into moses he came to the children of israel he came to the cradle but now they're worshiping back there in some pre-historic something but now it's not there it's in you oh my be going down he says here he said when you realize the hope of glory the baptism of the holy ghost has come into people's hearts and they don't recognize what it is they think it's a little church joining or something just a little club he said but that but that is the god the creator living in you the god who opened the red sea living in you the god who rained down hailstones living in you the god who closed the mouth of the lion living in you the god who quenched the violence of the fire living in you amen this is the god this is in you he said so it's in you amen he said see you in all malice hatred striving in me so forth flees away from you when you realize who is there and he comes and you receive him embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart he said i'll tell you the church together and that kind of power has the power to bind the heavens hello somebody it has the power to heal the sick it has the power to open the eyes of the blind and the deaf speak and the dumb speak amen the deaf hearing that don't speak the cripples walk the blind see it's recognizing the power of almighty god in you that is where he is the deity his extreme deity has come down in this moment not just to be beside you in the fire but to be in you in the fire hallelujah he would go on different places he talked about god manifesting his son came through the virgin birth conceived by a virgin that's pretty extreme did i do like brother andrew glover check check check his mic working that's that's extreme a virgin would conceive and bear a son that she would get a visitation of an angel that's beyond human comprehension you can't you can't believe that by human intellect matter of fact you can't believe god by human intellect period amen there's got to be something on the inside of you that anchors down a faith to hold on he said see you see god himself coming down in a blood cell wrapped the blood around him the blood cell the germ of life of god himself wrapped his blood cell that brought forth the sun christ jesus amen he does that to make you perfect to bring you back to fellowship he brings you through that blood cell into himself through the blood cell of the lord jesus that unveiled the life of jehovah and we're coming through that same blood cell to become part of that life so deity itself lays in the man that's received the holy ghost because you come to the same life you come through the same blood cell oh hallelujah you're a son he said i'm a branham by birth a part of mr misery's brain but you become a son or a daughter of god part of deity lays in you when you receive the holy ghost see how the devil robs you oh you can't do this and you can't do that but all things are possible to the people that has the holy ghost all things are possible amen no matter what it is you're part of deity well it surpasses all angels archangels it comes right into the presence of the potter himself through the blood and you come into deity become part think of god folding around him now we're going to enlarge it billions of times from this blood cell and their god in his blood cell folding himself up wrapping himself in a blood cell to come down to redeem man to life he said when that blood cell began to spread out and spread out it brought the body of christ jesus jehovah himself was tabernacled in him through it bursting to that blood cell at calvary that it might bring sons and daughters to himself and now through the blood of jesus christ we have become a part of god he said that's what makes satan mad he said that's what shakes him when the church of christ knows who they are you say i know there's nothing impossible with god he said there's nothing impossible with you we want to put it on god he said it said nothing is impossible with you if you believe all things are possible this is what he's saying when he says all things are possible that means there's nothing impossible it makes it very simple there's nothing impossible to gods what they keep saying he said there's nothing impossible with you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them hello somebody do you desire something from god when you pray believe and you shall have it that's not a if maybe you're a but it's you shall have it sister karen would slip very dark into a dark place on sunday and on monday very dark me and sister ruth would go up there to see her but tim had been there earlier that day and him brother joe would go later again in the evening be a very dark place but i would look at that darkness and i would speak to it you darkness you're not going to win you're going to move back in jesus name amen i said because i don't come on my own i come as a son of god and i come under the authority that had to know that in a very personal real way he has come down therefore i know i'm not standing by this bed outside by myself and not even just with my wife i'm standing with almighty god because that life is living on the inside of me and that same life would look at storms and say peace be still and i'm looking at this storm and i'm saying peace be still brother tim brother joe we go that evening and pray for her amen i would see her maybe open her eyes and look at me maybe once they they saw no no reaction no nothing i would talk to brother tim on his way home and he said timothy i don't know he said but i know one thing i've left the hospital more confident than ever god's got this god's going to move god's going in the morning she's going to be better that was his words i said but i said i'll bind with you on that i'll believe with you on that because i know the same god that walked on waters is the same god in us he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not just a god 2000 years ago he's a god of right now we don't need him 2000 years ago we need him right now and he's that god they would walk in the next morning and she would be back to herself and she'd be giving kisses and saying words and speaking amen he's the same god hallelujah he's the same god he's showing us amen his extreme deity i would actually come home from there and go to brother david and sister atlanta and give the testimony again of what all had taken place and i said i have to fully believe god is here to show his extreme deity he's here to show himself in a real powerful way to show he is still god and i'm looking at it i'm seeing strength come to a body i'm seeing mine return to a to a mind i'm seeing god move in the impossibilities i say god continue the work you are the author but you're also the finisher who who started the work will finish the work because he's the same yesterday today and forever if he can make dry bones live again he can make a body that's been torn down by satan's attacks he knows that old devil has been against her as his enemy and i heard the prophet of god say it today as i would watch deep call it to the d he would say when they when the when the devil or satan gets out after one of god's children he said he better watch out he's got jesus christ on his hands hallelujah amen the devil is not just dealing with you as a man or you as a man or you or you as a man or me as a man or you as a woman he's dealing with almighty god filled in [Applause] flesh he said he broke open that blood cell and he washed us and he brought us us into himself by the holy spirit there you are now we are sons of god part of god deity itself lives in every believer how many believers every man that's born of the spirit of god is a part of god no wonder that man believes in the supernatural no wonder he can believe in anything because an in him is a portion of god in other words in him is the supernatural mercy jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils speak with new tongues take up serpents drink deadly things or lay hands on the sick and they shall recover jesus said that he's become a part of him yes sir god on the instance of the on the instance of deliver anything he'll make a way when there's no way he'll make a way any man that believes in him believes the same thing he has to he's a part of god he's the offspring of god he's the son of god or a daughter of god he can't do nothing else because god's right with him even in him he's just a portion of god everything that god was in the pillar of fire he emptied into the son jesus christ and everything he wasn't the son jesus christ he's now emptied into his body the bride oh my god the mighty one the buckler the shield all his redemptive names everything he was he emptied into jesus christ he was saying jesus would say it like this what you say to this mountain be raised up and cast in the sea don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say is coming to pass you will have it what you say what you say then how can a man move a mountain only deity can move a mountain but so if we're sons and daughters of god then you go out and say mountain move that's not what he said you say i'll show you i can move it that's wrong it's you if you're but if your objectives is right and your motive is right then it's not you speaking it's deity speaking i am the vine you're the branches when you can get out of your own way so away from you that it's not you no more but let christ speak through you he said like these anointed ministers when they get anointed by the holy spirit to preach the word you don't have to worry about any words the holy spirit just delivers them you don't know what you're going to say the spirit just says it that's all that's what makes it all right he said that's the way it is by speaking to the mountain if your objective is right and your motive is right it isn't you speaking anymore it's the spirit of god speaking and when that that's what moves the mountain not you the spirit of god [Music] hallelujah you can learn you can learn more about the deity of christ and in the pergament church age he'd speak some wonderful things about it he would say this jesus would say i'm the way the truth and the life there he there it is he is a spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that's exactly what jesus says he is the word so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places upon his lips while that's the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man hallelujah oh can somebody say hallelujah hallelujah he said if the church way back there in that third age had only held to the revelation of the living word in their midst the power of god would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word and faith we can say without a doubt that the glory of god and all of his wonderful acts of gods will be in her midst again he said because it's deity in the hearts of men once again oh my we saw it also in this day wow undeniable proofs of his resurrection lame would walk people would jump out of wheelchairs watching the deep calling to the deep cancers would fall off there was a woman in the meeting that was carrying around one of the gross said it fell off turned white and fell off in that meeting what was it god showing his extremeness his extreme deity you know and it's just our position and our place to continue to speak faith to continue to speak what god has said you know it's it's our position and our place amen to use the words of god and speak it it's what he told us to do so it's our position it's who we are you know brother brandon i just want to bring this in the end as we look at these things for a moment he had his little little mexican brother that had a son he said a man about my age his wife is a finnish woman a little blind brother danny stevens shared this with me blessed me so much very lovely lady he was a gentleman went to the hospital he said i've seen a lot of sites we all do he said that disturbs us and brings our emotions but that was one of the worst i ever seen they brought this little lad to near the nursery room to with a special nurse when i looked there's cancer that spread his little jaws out so far they had to put a rag around his head to keep the keep from bursting his head open in his little jaws where the doctor tried to cut the cancer away they had made great big ditches back and forth all the way around his little throat just just aggravated the cancers he said just scattered it maybe it would be the right word said it went into his little tongue and little baby's mouth not over that wide little tongue had swollen and run out about that far and turned black and it was shutting the air off that he's trying to breathe so that daddy walked around the side of his little baby and said hello ricky daddy's little baby daddy's brought you to brother brannon to pray for you little baby recognized his father and it did not have any breathing up here so they had to cut a hole in his throat this little round whistle that we used to have for years ago that was in his throat he's catching its breath through that whistle and a nurse had to stay there all the time because the cancer was draining out of this little hole sounds terrible darn and the cancer was draining out of the from and from it and said the little arms wasn't splints and he couldn't catch it with with this with his hands to pull it out when it was so he couldn't pull it out he said the nurse was there all the time and started straining she'd reach up and take something and pull the cancer stuff out of that little whistle so he could breathe again his little hands like this reaching for his daddy he said you know i i just almost tore my heart apart as i was standing there i thought lord jesus if thou art the fountain of all sympathy and all mercy lays within you would you get any joy out of seeing this little dart and lay here like that i just can't believe i never will believe that this will be the will of almighty god to see such as this i thought you are the fountain of mercy and if you be the fountain of mercy then how would you or how could you be a merciful god enjoy seeing something like that what would you do if you were standing here he said i want to be honest when i meet god i want to meet him with an honest heart i've done the best i know how to do he said but when i said that something spoke down within me and said lord well as i said lord what would you do if you were standing here something spoke said and said i'm waiting to see what you'll do hello somebody i'm waiting to see what you will do and i looked at that little thing i took this little baby's hand not that wide and put in my fingers like this and held i said by faith in god i placed between this cancer and the baby the blood of the lord jesus christ and i turned around and walked out and the father came with me i just couldn't say no more i got in the car and he said brother branham here's a little titans i've been saving for i said i don't take that money put it on the baby's bill but within about two hours from that time the little jaw had gone back to normal the tongue had come back into his mouth and the loving mercy of the kind loving father had seen fit to heal the baby and the next morning the baby was going to be sent home a well baby that's the extreme deity of god and he has come down to show us his extreme deity that is the shame yesterday today and forever he'll tell again about how that little boy's brother came to him a little later jumped out of a station wagon tears running down his cheek jerked off his hat with his little finished wife standing there brother branham i come here to give you that ties again i said i said oh brother i don't want that he said you know ricky's going home today i said i'm grateful for that but i told you to put that on ricky's bill that's just what i had to tell you about brother brad when i went to pay the doctor this morning to put that money over to him i said doctor i want to pay you some on the bill he said mister don't you even mention to me that anymore about that bill you don't owe me nothing that's the greatest thing i ever seen done in my life he said that's the phenomena of the phenomena you don't owe me a penny it just goes to show that the living god still lives he's come to show the phenomena of the phenomena the extreme of the extreme that he's still a god of miracles he's still the god who heals he's still the god who sets free he's still the god who brings life into a body it may look impossible it may look dark but god is still on the throne and he's come down to show his deity his glory and his people we've seen it god move in impossible situations it would be a sin for us to disbelieve because we've seen god do some impossible things and i'd say he's not finished yet he's not gonna he's gonna get so extreme that one of these days these old bodies have been bound down by every pain and every kind of discomfort and every kind of thing and going slowly into a grave all of a sudden gonna come so extreme that god is gonna change every molecule change it all back to what it was supposed to be at the beginning he has come down in this hour to have a bribe without spot without wrinkle and he's going to fulfill that word they ain't a devil in hell there ain't enough devils that's going to stop it but there's going to be a bride that says yes lord be it unto me according to that word and they're going to let that deity begin to work in their lives until it heals the it raises the dead it changes lives it brings the prodigals home until it culminates into a resurrection this is what we're in for and this is

know you in the power of your resurrection lord that the sins of each one would be under the blood lord that they would be one of these that we were talking about deity living on the inside so that they could speak to their mountains so that there would be a faith that would resolve would be on the inside of them and a resolve on the inside that they know who their redeemer is and they know that they're a son or daughter of god i pray lord that you'll just do a extreme work within their lives lord in this moment lord may not one of them wait to rapture day and see one's missing here and missing there and then decide to seek the lord but may it today today while they hear their your voice that they will harden up their hearts but they'll just yield herself to you make us surrender their lives to you lord completely and totally in jesus name thank you father thank you for every heart that you've touched tonight lord i pray for those that are prodigals that are listening to me right now lord those that are on the internet that are being touched father i remember a night a night lord when you spoke to me about a one of your children that was trained a prodigal and told them tonight they were about to receive their last call i remember hearing that voice from another dimension and i looked in the middle of the night and i could see as it was a vision and a dark line go across the sea and i remember lord knowing i was the messenger [Music] knowing that i had a message to bring that individual and i remember you were rich in mercy you didn't let them cross that line but lord the way in the middle of the night you came open up the scripture to them show them the prodigal son there a daughter of yours came to herself that night you saved her you turned her life around and she lived as a solid christian ever since lord i thank you for those moments i thank you that you care [Music] i thank you lord that you reach out you can reach further down than what we can even look up i pray lord for that prodigal wherever they are maybe they're in this building tonight may they come to their self may lord o god they realize there is a land they can cross but a god rich in mercy is reaching call and given them opportunity may they surrender their lives and come in jesus name thank you for jesus name thank you father amen thank you lord on the everlasting will [Music] safe and secure from all along [Music] lady [Music] what have i to dread what have i to [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Applause] [Music] [Music] i know how from day to day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen the doctor called me while i was in church tonight and i stepped out to return a call back to him we have some obstacles that we are having to to work around and actually the doctors are you know i've decided exactly what to do the situation at hand is that the mris has shown that sister karen has some um showers of small clots that are in her her uh brain and um they don't know where the clots are coming from it could possibly be her legs could be from her heart they will be doing some tests tomorrow to try to discover uh and determine where they're coming from they will do some sonograms on the legs it will do a scope down her throat and take pictures inside there trying to figure out what well where this is coming from because of the because of the the brain bleed uh it could be dangerous to give her blood thinners could start new bleedings or the bleeding to start again and yet uh you know they they feel like they need something to to uh dissipate the clots so you know their wrists this ways and their wrists that ways and they they are back and forth on what to do and you know wanting me to make decisions on what to do and you know i need leadership from the lord as to and some guidance by the holy spirit we need god to undertake amen and god's still god you know i am satisfied and i know this if god gives us an answer of no and and he says it's her time upon earth i'm confident i know she's a child of god and i know god's got all it in control but i think tonight when we come before the throne of grace and we can come as children of the most high god we come boldly before the throne and tonight as we have been preaching and speaking about changing dimensions and transcending dimensions and the war that goes on into the heavenly realms and we also know that we are seated with power and authority we know our position in christ and we know we're seated with him so we have a right to come before the throne of grace to find help in our time of need 2 000 years ago my lord was beat and his head that no doubt had [Music] concussions and bleeds and all kinds of things that were going on he did this as a man that he might be able to sit as a man and we could approach him as a man so man would not come and approach a god that has never felt pain and never felt sorrow never felt problems but we can find somebody that is compassionate that went through what we go through the bible said he was a man of sorrows he was acquainted with grief in other words he was familiar with pain he was familiar he knows what we go through we as the children of god right now in our closing prayer tonight we are moving beyond this building we're moving in realms beyond here and by faith we're approaching the ivory throne where that he sits there as the high priest who can be touched with how we feel i want you to carry your feelings to there we're the bride of christ esther you have a right to go before the king [Music] you don't have to be scared i'm afraid you have a right to approach the throne the scepter has already been held out you're walking there and you're telling what wicked haman has been doing amen you tell him this wicked haman this weekend heyman is doing this to your children but we're the children of the most high god and we're here to say we're going to hang the devil on his own

and i stood there with with them around brother brown's grave as we were traveling back from a meeting i want to say was 1985. of those young men that's stood there only my son i think is the only one that still continues with the lord today but i took him there to brother madam's grave and i said listen this is where a prophet of god was laid to rest but i'm going to tell you somebody's going to believe this message somebody's going to stand for this truth somebody's gonna see that christ is the same yesterday today and forever and i said it might as well be us i'm one of them that will amen
