[22:54] different testing that's being done to

[22:57] remember her in prayer tonight
[23:00] we also want to remember to pray for
[23:03] sister Liz butts she's going to the
[23:07] doctor for a possible torn rotator cuff
[23:10] so remember that need also we want to
[23:12] continue to remember Sister Jeanette
[23:14] Pruitt as she heals from her surgery the
[23:16] surgery went very well and already have
[23:19] heard that she's having some better
[23:21] feeling in her legs and things so very
[23:23] good report there and we're so thankful
[23:25] for that but amen we want to continue to
[23:27] keep her in prayer as well as brother
[23:30] Ross and those that are suffering from
[23:32] cancer in our congregation also we have
[23:34] a prayer request for
[23:37] for brother Jordan
[23:40] pull up the request here brother Jordan
[23:42] uh Pruitt he had a four-wheeler accident
[23:45] today and he has a fractured collarbone
[23:47] [Music]
[23:49] Also may have another broken bone and
[23:51] they say that a portion of the upper
[23:54] right lung is collapsed so he's been
[23:57] transferred over towards LSU and asked
[24:01] that we would remember that need in
[24:02] prayer tonight that the Lord would touch
[24:04] him in a very special way and be with
[24:06] those that are caring for him if you
[24:08] have a need you want to lift up to the
[24:09] Lord tonight as just before brother Joe
[24:11] comes let's just sing that course now
[24:13] with our needs lifted holy
[24:18] foreign
[24:19] [Music]
[24:51] oh me
[24:56] oh the Lord this evening
[24:58] amen I just want to follow up with you
[25:01] in regards to brother Isaiah Robinson we
[25:03] shared his testimony this past Sunday
[25:05] and he had messaged me shortly
[25:08] thereafter and said he thoroughly
[25:09] enjoyed the sermon and the message and
[25:11] he said brother Joe he said you did my
[25:13] testimony perfect
[25:16] he said I was in tears the entire time
[25:19] he goes I hope and I pray that my
[25:21] testimony will reach thousands if not
[25:24] Millions to see what God has done and
[25:27] what God is doing he says I'm excited
[25:29] about what God has done in my life so
[25:31] I'll say that to say that if God can do
[25:33] that for somebody who is in that
[25:36] lifestyle for 19 years surely the same
[25:39] God could come and minister to your need
[25:41] tonight to minister to the lives of of
[25:43] your loved ones tonight because he
[25:46] he is God
[25:48] and the Bible was saved that his arm has
[25:50] not shortened that he cannot save and
[25:52] his ear is not heavy that he cannot hear
[25:54] and I believe tonight we can petition
[25:56] Our God and he will hear our prayer and
[25:59] he will stretched down his arm and
[26:00] minister to that need so let's just take
[26:02] these needs that were mentioned in your
[26:04] need if you have one tonight let's take
[26:06] them before the Lord and believe
[26:08] we've seen a living God

[42:37] Isaiah 44th chapter and the 28th verse
[42:42] once we get going they're going to be
[42:44] quite a number of scripture readings I
[42:48] think they sent you a list of scriptures
[42:50] to try to help out so
[42:52] you may not have the opportunity or time
[42:54] to turn there but I sent a list so maybe
[42:56] we'll build a to keep up be a little bit
[42:59] like a Bible study I guess we'll see
[43:03] Isaiah 44 and 28 we're going to read one
[43:06] verse there and then we're going to look
[43:07] over to Isaiah 45 one verse and then
[43:10] also another verse in Isaiah 45 so we're
[43:13] gonna go I'd like to speak to you for a
[43:15] little bit this evening on returning to
[43:18] receive
[43:19] returning to receive
[43:23] verse 28 it says that saith of Cyrus he
[43:28] is my shepherd and shall perform all my
[43:31] pleasure even saying to Jerusalem Thou
[43:36] shalt be built and to the temple thy
[43:39] Foundation shall be laid now over in
[43:43] chapter 45 and verse 1 it says
[43:46] thus saith the Lord to his anointed to
[43:50] Cyrus whose right hand I have Holden to
[43:53] subdue Nations before him and I will
[43:56] loose the loins of Kings to open before
[43:58] him the two lived Gates and the gates
[44:02] shall not be shut and then we're going
[44:04] to skip down to verse 13. it says I have
[44:07] raised him up in righteousness
[44:10] and I will direct all his ways he shall
[44:14] build my city and he shall let go my
[44:17] captives not for Price nor reward saith
[44:21] the Lord of hosts amen you may have your
[44:24] seats this evening
[44:27] foreign
[44:29] what we want to do is we want to take a
[44:32] look at Israel and their captivity in
[44:35] Babylon
[44:36] and the return back to the Homeland as
[44:39] it relates to the church down Through
[44:42] the Ages and her captivity in mystery
[44:45] Babylon
[44:46] we know that Israel oftentimes is used
[44:49] and is a perfect type of the church and
[44:52] last week we looked at the effects that
[44:55] Babylon had on Israel during their 70
[44:58] years of Exile and how it had affected
[45:01] them and how it had affected even their
[45:03] thinking and we saw that how in an
[45:05] attempt to stay true in what was a good
[45:08] attempt in their hearts in an attempt to
[45:10] practice their religion they began to
[45:11] build synagogues and they began to
[45:13] worship and they began to have a it
[45:15] wasn't like the worship they had in
[45:17] Jerusalem but at least they were doing
[45:19] their best to continue on with the
[45:22] worship as best as they could while they
[45:24] were in that land and I understand that
[45:26] the issue there wasn't with their
[45:29] worship
[45:31] um even though they couldn't fully
[45:33] worship as we would say in spirit and in
[45:35] truth because it wasn't the original
[45:37] Temple worship there even though that
[45:40] even though they couldn't sacrifice in
[45:42] the temple because they were in a
[45:44] Strange Land and the temple had been
[45:45] destroyed they were worshiping as best
[45:48] they could with what they had so they
[45:51] were given it everything and they were
[45:53] worshiping to the best of their ability
[45:55] the issue came when there was an
[45:58] opportunity for them to go back
[46:01] there was nothing wrong with worshiping
[46:03] the way they worshiped as long as that
[46:04] was the best they had as long as that
[46:07] was all the light that was shining on
[46:09] the word at that time there was nothing
[46:10] wrong with that worship but when it came
[46:14] time to move the issue came when the
[46:16] opportunity to go back to the original
[46:19] was presented to the people they no
[46:22] longer saw the need to be restored back
[46:25] they had settled into their religion
[46:27] they had settled in right where they
[46:29] were they had grown accustomed to a
[46:31] little bit of Babylon being mixed in
[46:34] with their religion they didn't see the
[46:37] need for an Acts 2 38 experience anymore
[46:39] they didn't see the need for an acts 4
[46:42] experience they just believed on the
[46:45] Lord or or they believed that God sent a
[46:47] prophet and they figured they could stay
[46:48] right where they were and they were
[46:50] going to be okay because they had
[46:52] settled in where they were at but God
[46:55] had provided a way to go back and if God
[46:58] says go back if God says to Rich turn
[47:01] that I want to tell you tonight you
[47:03] should return whatever it is God's
[47:05] telling you to do wherever he's sending
[47:07] you wherever he's leading you even if it
[47:09] doesn't make sense to you even if it's
[47:11] the harder way if he says do it I
[47:13] recommend to you tonight that you do it
[47:15] if he lays that opportunity before you
[47:18] now now as we looked at this our opening
[47:20] scripture I opened the scripture to me
[47:23] they're so amazing in in the fact that
[47:26] it's Isaiah and he's prophesying of one
[47:29] who's going to come and God is going to
[47:31] use him to return Israel home again and
[47:35] what you have to realize is Isaiah is
[47:37] writing this more than a hundred years
[47:39] before Cyrus ever comes to the throne
[47:41] this is more like 140 years before he
[47:44] ever comes to the throne this is before
[47:46] he's ever been born or ever even been
[47:48] thought of and Isaiah writes in 45 1
[47:51] thus saith the Lord to his anointed to
[47:55] Cyrus whose right hand I have hold him
[47:57] to subdue Nations before him and I will
[48:01] loose the loins of the Kings to open
[48:03] before him the two lead gates in the
[48:05] gate shall not be shut verse 13.
[48:08] I have raised him up in righteousness I
[48:11] will direct all his ways he shall build
[48:14] my city and he shall let go
[48:17] my captives now as we know because we
[48:19] read it last week in in the first
[48:21] chapter of Ezra in the first year of
[48:23] Cyrus's Reign he does exactly these
[48:26] things he comes in and he loses them and
[48:28] he begins to fulfill prophecy listen
[48:30] what I want us to get tonight is that
[48:32] God does things the way God wants to do
[48:36] things
[48:36] okay it doesn't have to be how you
[48:39] expect it to be when you expect it to be
[48:41] or through the person that you expect it
[48:43] to come through right God is in control
[48:46] no matter what you think tonight quit
[48:50] fussing about who the president is quit
[48:52] fussing about politics quit worrying
[48:54] about this and all the world affairs
[48:56] they are doing exactly what they are
[48:59] supposed to be doing they are nothing
[49:02] more than Pawns in the hands of God God
[49:05] chose Cyrus
[49:07] God chose Sorrows he was a pagan
[49:10] polytheistic King of Persia who was out
[49:13] to conquer the world and God says that's
[49:15] my anointed one I have raised him up in
[49:18] righteousness I'm directing all his ways
[49:21] he's gonna build my city he's gonna lose
[49:23] my captives Cyrus
[49:27] Cyrus is a murderer he's killing
[49:29] everybody he's Conquering the world he's
[49:31] he's polytheistic he's a pagan
[49:34] but in this God knew who to let come
[49:37] into control because being polytheistic
[49:39] what Cyrus believed was as many gods as
[49:42] I can get looking on me favorably the
[49:45] better
[49:46] so when he takes over and he's like wait
[49:48] they destroyed your temple
[49:50] well we got to fix that I can't have
[49:52] this God angry with me I can't have him
[49:55] mad at me I want my kingdom to prosper
[49:57] go back go back go fix this mess before
[50:00] the god takes out his wrath on me
[50:03] and so God allows him to come into this
[50:05] place and and God does it how he wants
[50:09] to do it
[50:10] well surely some great deliverer is
[50:13] going to rise up like Moses did
[50:15] surely one of our Brethren is going to
[50:17] rise up surely one of the priests who
[50:19] used to sacrifice in the original Temple
[50:21] God is going to use him
[50:23] nope
[50:25] Cyrus
[50:27] God's gonna do things the way he wants
[50:30] to do things these people are going to
[50:33] be delivered the way God wants to
[50:34] deliver them listen in the problems that
[50:37] you're going through in the situation
[50:38] that you're facing God is going to
[50:40] deliver you in the way that he wants to
[50:42] deliver you don't get it in your mind
[50:45] how it's going to work I'm going to work
[50:46] out just say God I trust you in
[50:48] whichever Avenue you open to me I'm
[50:50] gonna take that Avenue because so many
[50:53] times we get it in our mind how things
[50:54] are going to be and it causes us to miss
[50:56] what it is we're supposed to receive
[50:58] listen Jesus came the way God wanted him
[51:01] to not the way they expected him to and
[51:05] because of this so many people missed
[51:06] him so many people couldn't receive him
[51:08] this message came how God wanted this
[51:11] message to come oh surely it's going to
[51:14] come through some great University some
[51:16] great organization some great doctor of
[51:18] divinity nope William Branham
[51:22] God chose the messenger god picked who
[51:25] he wanted to deliver it through and the
[51:27] message was delivered exactly the way
[51:29] God wanted it to be delivered to a
[51:32] people he knew could receive it in that
[51:34] way don't listen to it or hear you go I
[51:36] wish he'd have said this or I wish he'd
[51:37] done that mile I couldn't have been this
[51:39] way it came exactly the way God wanted
[51:42] it to come to deliver the people that
[51:44] God wanted to deliver in this last day
[51:48] yeah
[51:49] God sent the message and it was
[51:52] delivered exactly how he wanted it to be
[51:54] delivered
[51:55] and it also was foretold as we know in
[51:58] Malachi 4 5-6 behold I will send you
[52:01] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[52:03] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[52:05] and he shall turn the heart of the
[52:07] fathers to the children in the heart of
[52:09] the children to their fathers lest I
[52:11] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[52:14] here what we see is prophesied is an
[52:17] opportunity
[52:19] to go back
[52:21] just like was given to the children of
[52:23] Israel
[52:24] an opportunity to return to the original
[52:27] an opportunity here to return to the
[52:30] land of the word to return to the faith
[52:32] of the original fathers now the church
[52:35] had need to go back because they
[52:37] themselves had found themselves captured
[52:39] and then exiled down in Babylon just
[52:42] like Israel had been
[52:43] the church had started free and full of
[52:45] power right there in Jerusalem
[52:48] free
[52:49] they operated
[52:51] to Mark 16. according to John 14 12
[52:54] according to James 5 there were no
[52:57] claims on the church such as false
[52:59] doctrines or Trinity doctrines or false
[53:01] baptisms the doctrines and the Deeds of
[53:04] the Nicolaitans had not yet taken hold
[53:06] and so this church was free of any claim
[53:09] of the enemy and they operated in a way
[53:11] where the spirit moved freely where the
[53:13] spirit fell on people and they received
[53:16] it and and we know how it would cause
[53:18] them to act there was tongues and there
[53:19] was gifts and there was healings that's
[53:21] how the first church operated
[53:23] and they were the pattern they were the
[53:27] original they are the standard
[53:32] so many people get uncomfortable when
[53:34] you say that but the prophet of God said
[53:35] Pentecost was our pattern
[53:38] no one will have to say but what the
[53:41] church was inaugurated on the day of
[53:43] Pentecost he goes on to say this what
[53:45] the church was at Pentecost is the
[53:48] standard that is the pattern there is no
[53:51] other pattern no matter what the
[53:53] scholars say God has not changed that
[53:56] pattern what God did at Pentecost he has
[53:59] to keep on doing until the church age is
[54:02] close
[54:04] he says the true church will always try
[54:07] to be like the original Pentecost
[54:10] there's a lot of people that obviously
[54:11] have never read that
[54:13] the true church will try to be
[54:17] like the original at Pentecost the true
[54:19] church of today will try to approximate
[54:22] that early first one
[54:25] brother Branham here makes it very clear
[54:27] what we are to return to and what we are
[54:31] to act like
[54:33] what you are to return to and what this
[54:35] church is to be like
[54:37] but what was it that happened to that
[54:39] church why is it that there's a need for
[54:42] a return why isn't it that it didn't
[54:45] stay right where it was down Through the
[54:47] Ages
[54:48] the same thing happened to them that had
[54:51] happened to Israel they left their first
[54:53] love
[54:54] they followed after other gods they
[54:57] began to drift and allow the ideas of
[54:59] man to enter into the church
[55:01] and these next few quotes all come from
[55:03] from the Ephesian Church age
[55:05] he says the fervent desire to please God
[55:07] the passion to know his word The Cry of
[55:10] reaching out in the spirit all began to
[55:13] fade and instead of that church being on
[55:15] fire with the fire of God it has cooled
[55:18] off and become a bit formal
[55:20] he says what can this mean but the day
[55:22] would come when the vested clergy by
[55:25] political maneuvering
[55:27] and the substitution of word and spirit
[55:29] for Creeds and dogmas and human
[55:31] leadership would enslave the laity
[55:34] notice the wording used there
[55:37] it would enslave the laity while the
[55:40] leaders luxuriated in ill-gotten wealth
[55:43] he said the second generation coming on
[55:45] was just like Israel they demanded a
[55:48] king to be like other nations when they
[55:50] did that they rejected God but they did
[55:52] it anyway this is the history of the
[55:56] church
[55:57] he said they let down the bars and the
[55:59] goats came in and took over the Cry Of
[56:01] Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit
[56:04] was gone oh they kept on with the form
[56:07] but the fire had died down and the
[56:10] Blackness of Ashes is about all that is
[56:13] left
[56:15] he said but as usual people don't heed
[56:17] God's warning that Revival fire built
[56:20] upon the sacred word is so wonderful and
[56:23] the manifestation of the spirit is so
[56:25] blessed that a little fear Creeps in and
[56:29] Whispers in the heart and says how can
[56:32] we protect this truth we have
[56:35] what can we do to see this revival goes
[56:38] on now notice how slick the enemy is
[56:40] none of this sounds bad at all
[56:43] I think it's a great idea that we
[56:45] shouldn't let the Revival die down I
[56:47] think it's a great idea to protect the
[56:49] truth I believe we should fight for the
[56:51] truth these are all things that seem
[56:53] very reasonable
[56:54] he says what can we do to see the
[56:56] Revival go on that is when the
[56:58] Antichrist Spirit comes in and Whispers
[57:01] look you have the truth now see that it
[57:05] doesn't get lost
[57:07] that's Antichrist you have the word
[57:11] make sure it doesn't get lost just focus
[57:13] on that part of it don't worry about the
[57:15] other aspects that are needed just focus
[57:17] on one part make sure it don't get lost
[57:20] make sure that you get you get this and
[57:23] right here is where the Exile or the
[57:25] capture takes place right here is where
[57:27] the church goes down into Babylon there
[57:30] the very moment that that first move of
[57:33] God organized they were in Babylon
[57:36] that very moment they were captured and
[57:39] the devil is so slick that he uses the
[57:42] fear of losing the truth to ensnare you
[57:47] think about this
[57:48] and even as the church begins its
[57:51] Journey even once there was some freedom
[57:53] from Rome and even as people began to
[57:55] come back to the unfolding of the word
[57:57] and their Journey from Babylon back to
[58:00] the Homeland begins
[58:02] even as they become back from exile to a
[58:05] restored truth even as God would send
[58:07] Messengers down Through the Ages that
[58:10] Spirit kept on working to keep people
[58:12] from going all the way back
[58:16] oh sure yeah you've come out of Babylon
[58:18] You Broke Free from that Roman system
[58:19] but this is for protect this truth you
[58:22] have protect this truth right here even
[58:25] as they left Rome or even as they left
[58:27] Babylon if he could get them with that
[58:30] same denominational mindset
[58:33] then he still had a claim on them
[58:35] he would still have a claim on if he
[58:37] could get the church from being
[58:38] completely free and completely restored
[58:41] if he could use the fear of losing truth
[58:44] to do it that's how he would ensnare the
[58:47] people
[58:48] how do you mean so brother Aaron look
[58:51] the revelation of justification was so
[58:53] special
[58:54] it brought such a freedom and they said
[58:57] we can't lose this we can't lose this
[58:59] truth this is a wonderful truth that has
[59:01] loosed us from the bounds of Catholicism
[59:03] and yet they walled up so tight around
[59:06] it to protect it that when justification
[59:09] came they couldn't move on to it and
[59:11] they had been snared by the truth
[59:15] no no the truth liberates you not
[59:17] everybody the truth snares some people
[59:21] and they're snared by the truth and they
[59:23] can't go on to the next truth but those
[59:25] who did those who fought through that
[59:27] they see a true
[59:29] sanctification and they get the a holy
[59:32] life a true Bible sanctification and
[59:35] then the restoration of the gifts come
[59:36] but they're so walled up
[59:39] that they can't move on and accept the
[59:41] the restoration of their gifts and then
[59:43] those see that and it's such a special
[59:44] thing and it's such a powerful thing and
[59:47] they get so walled up that they can't
[59:48] move on to anything other than tongues
[59:51] and they're walled up right there snared
[59:53] by a truth not able to move beyond the
[59:56] truth
[59:57] and they're bound up with the same
[59:59] denominational mindset
[1:00:01] God sent a prophet
[1:00:05] it's a truth a truth you must see and
[1:00:09] yet they get so walled up with God sent
[1:00:11] a prophet that they can't even move on
[1:00:13] into the message that the prophet
[1:00:15] brought
[1:00:16] they're snared by God sent a prophet and
[1:00:18] they're stuck right there and they can't
[1:00:20] even move on into what was opened up to
[1:00:22] them
[1:00:23] so walled up in Traditions to our
[1:00:25] message people have has more Traditions
[1:00:27] than any of the denominations we've ever
[1:00:29] preached about
[1:00:30] message people are the most traditional
[1:00:33] people on the face of the earth I
[1:00:34] believe
[1:00:38] snared
[1:00:40] not able to move on into the opening of
[1:00:42] the word because it's just this portion
[1:00:45] or it's just this part
[1:00:48] and Babylon still holds a claim on them
[1:00:50] because they're under the spirit of
[1:00:52] denomination
[1:00:54] it's the same chain that has grabbed a
[1:00:56] hold of every age
[1:01:00] to where his brother Brown would say the
[1:01:01] Cry Of Joy was gone
[1:01:03] the freedom of the spirit gone oh they
[1:01:06] kept on with the form of godliness
[1:01:09] but the fire had died down and the
[1:01:11] Blackness of Ashes is about all that is
[1:01:14] left
[1:01:16] but that's not everybody
[1:01:19] there is a people who are determined in
[1:01:21] their hearts I'm going all the way back
[1:01:23] I'm not going to stop short they're
[1:01:25] refusing to stop short of all the way
[1:01:28] because they recognize what all of this
[1:01:30] has been for God didn't send a prophet
[1:01:33] in order to send a prophet God sent a
[1:01:36] prophet to gather abroad to gather and
[1:01:38] elect to take them back to the Homeland
[1:01:41] to take them back to the faith to put
[1:01:43] them back in the original place where he
[1:01:45] started the church they recognized I
[1:01:47] can't stop short of that I can't stop
[1:01:51] short of that
[1:01:52] it's a return to where and how our
[1:01:55] fathers worshiped the original faith in
[1:01:58] the homeland of the word and we refuse
[1:02:01] to stop anywhere along the journey
[1:02:03] remember you might come up to something
[1:02:04] that's very good say justification
[1:02:07] but that's not the stopping point that's
[1:02:08] just on the way sanctification is
[1:02:11] wonderful but it's on the way the gifts
[1:02:13] is wonderful but that's on the way God
[1:02:15] sent a prophet that's wonderful but it's
[1:02:16] on the way you can't stop there you got
[1:02:19] to keep going
[1:02:21] all the way
[1:02:23] all the way back
[1:02:26] Jeremiah prophesied they would return
[1:02:28] back to the land of their fathers
[1:02:31] the land of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:02:34] in Jeremiah 29 10 he said for thus saith
[1:02:36] the Lord
[1:02:37] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[1:02:39] Babylon I will visit you
[1:02:41] and perform my good word towards you and
[1:02:44] causing you to return
[1:02:47] to this place
[1:02:50] the same thing was prophesied with
[1:02:51] Malachi concerning the church
[1:02:54] prophesied that one would come and turn
[1:02:56] our hearts back to the faith or the land
[1:02:58] of Peter of Paul of Stephen back to the
[1:03:02] land of the original
[1:03:04] but by but by getting away from their
[1:03:07] first love the church found themselves
[1:03:09] in captivity
[1:03:11] prophets and servants had kept hope
[1:03:13] alive for a full return to the land
[1:03:16] Malachi prophesied Joel prophesied I
[1:03:19] will restore there were prophets along
[1:03:21] the way that kept hope survives that one
[1:03:23] day we can come out of this one day we
[1:03:25] can be returned back one day and God
[1:03:28] sent men down through the ages to keep
[1:03:30] Faith alive that one day would come a
[1:03:32] full return just like he had sent
[1:03:34] prophets to Babylon to let them know one
[1:03:36] day there's going to be a return the
[1:03:38] church held out hope the church looked
[1:03:40] for it the church longed for it the
[1:03:41] church wanted to be free but then
[1:03:44] finally the return comes
[1:03:46] it's time to go back
[1:03:47] now let's go back as we go back and
[1:03:49] forth through this just keep in mind
[1:03:51] that we may be interchanging Israel in
[1:03:54] the church
[1:03:54] Israel in the church because we're
[1:03:56] dealing with the same thing the time
[1:03:58] came to leave Babylon and go back to
[1:04:00] Jerusalem the time came to return back
[1:04:02] to the Homeland to return back to the
[1:04:04] original faith the prophet came said
[1:04:07] it's time to go back it's time to
[1:04:08] rebuild a prophet comes on the scene
[1:04:10] with a message from the King he's
[1:04:12] declaring Bible Truth Bible doctrines
[1:04:15] returned to Pentecost you must have the
[1:04:17] token
[1:04:18] only to find that most Christians had no
[1:04:20] desire to go back
[1:04:22] only to find that most Christians were
[1:04:25] pretty comfortable in their religion in
[1:04:27] Babylon
[1:04:29] they had settled down to where they were
[1:04:30] comfortable they had got comfortable in
[1:04:33] Babylon they didn't really want Bible
[1:04:34] holiness
[1:04:36] they liked wearing their Babylonian
[1:04:38] garments
[1:04:39] they didn't really want true Bible
[1:04:41] sanctification they liked having some of
[1:04:43] their Babylonian habits they wanted to
[1:04:46] say I'm still saved but I still want to
[1:04:48] partake of this and I still want to wear
[1:04:50] that they were comfortable in Babylon
[1:04:52] they did not want to return they wanted
[1:04:55] a form of godliness
[1:04:57] that's what they wanted a form of God is
[1:05:00] they were comfortable with worldly
[1:05:01] comfort with worldly entertainment most
[1:05:04] didn't see the need why do I need to go
[1:05:07] back
[1:05:07] why must I do that they had their
[1:05:10] religion they could hold their religion
[1:05:12] and they could hold on to the world too
[1:05:13] so why do I got to do this but the king
[1:05:17] had decreed that we could go back this
[1:05:20] is the decree of the king we can rebuild
[1:05:22] the Temple we can have the same worship
[1:05:24] our fathers had
[1:05:26] but why do I need that
[1:05:28] I'm comfortable just coming on Sunday
[1:05:30] singing a couple I'm comfortable living
[1:05:32] the life I'm living
[1:05:34] to do this is going to get me out of my
[1:05:36] comfort zone some of us need to get out
[1:05:38] of our comfort zone
[1:05:40] our comfort zones for a lot of us are
[1:05:42] leading us to a state of lukewarmness
[1:05:45] all right it's easy to get comfortable
[1:05:47] and fall asleep get uncomfortable step
[1:05:48] out of your Comforts don't say God move
[1:05:50] in my life do whatever you need to do to
[1:05:52] wake me up to shake me to make sure I'm
[1:05:55] prepared for the Return of the King
[1:06:00] we have the opportunity to go back to
[1:06:02] the faith and to the worship that the
[1:06:04] father's had we can rebuild the walls
[1:06:06] and have the same protection of the word
[1:06:08] that they had
[1:06:11] and just like in Ezra some came out
[1:06:14] you're proof of it
[1:06:16] some came out
[1:06:17] some heard the call come out of her my
[1:06:19] people and they heard the call and they
[1:06:21] said I'm not comfortable here and some
[1:06:23] began the journey to go back and some
[1:06:25] came out and we know that around 42 000
[1:06:28] came out of Babylon around this time I
[1:06:30] dropped in the bucket a mere five to ten
[1:06:33] percent of those that happen to be in
[1:06:35] captivity why didn't more come out
[1:06:38] why didn't Moore leave how could they
[1:06:41] see the Vindication of the Prophet night
[1:06:43] after night after night and see thus
[1:06:45] saith the Lord night after night see
[1:06:47] discernment night after night and never
[1:06:49] fail and go I think I'll stay right here
[1:06:51] in in Babylon
[1:06:54] listen
[1:06:56] if one percent of the people that
[1:06:58] witnessed the ministry of the Prophet
[1:07:00] had come out there wouldn't be an empty
[1:07:02] seat in this building
[1:07:03] just the ones that witnessed it in
[1:07:05] Louisiana
[1:07:06] but they witnessed the Vindicated power
[1:07:09] of God and said I'm comfortable right
[1:07:11] here with my religion I don't need to go
[1:07:14] back to Pentecost I don't need to return
[1:07:16] to the original I don't need to go back
[1:07:18] and rebuild the Temple
[1:07:20] I'm good right where I'm at
[1:07:25] how could the how could they declare
[1:07:27] Bible days are here again
[1:07:29] they declared Bible days are here again
[1:07:34] but I'm gonna stay right here
[1:07:37] Bible days are here
[1:07:39] why are you here
[1:07:41] and others aren't
[1:07:43] why did you come out why did your
[1:07:45] parents come out what stirred you
[1:07:48] why are you sitting here tonight
[1:07:50] returned back
[1:07:53] Ezra one and five this is after the
[1:07:56] decree
[1:07:57] where the king says if any man will go
[1:08:00] it says then rose up the chief of the
[1:08:02] fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the
[1:08:04] priests and the Levites with all of them
[1:08:06] whose Spirit God had raised to go up to
[1:08:10] build the house of the Lord which is in
[1:08:13] Jerusalem it's no accident you're here
[1:08:16] tonight it's no accident Your Heart Was
[1:08:18] Heard God moved on your heart God called
[1:08:21] you God said you're going back he set
[1:08:24] your mind he said you you you and he
[1:08:27] moved on your heart it's not by accident
[1:08:30] that they went back
[1:08:32] it's no accident your heart has been
[1:08:34] turned back to the fathers
[1:08:36] it's no accident that you want to be
[1:08:38] completely free of Babylon
[1:08:40] it says the spirit of God raised you up
[1:08:43] the spirit of God took you out of
[1:08:45] Babylon the spirit of God placed you
[1:08:47] where you are tonight
[1:08:49] you have been called to go back home you
[1:08:52] have been called to go back to the
[1:08:54] original
[1:08:55] there was something burning in the
[1:08:57] hearts of those forty two thousand you
[1:08:59] know what it feels like
[1:09:01] there was something burned in their
[1:09:02] hearts I can't stay here I know I have a
[1:09:05] good life I know we have some truth I
[1:09:07] know we have some church but I just
[1:09:08] can't stay here I gotta take another
[1:09:10] step I got to go further I got to go
[1:09:13] back to the land of the fathers I got to
[1:09:15] go back how it was that the original I
[1:09:17] want to worship the way they worship
[1:09:18] them the temple
[1:09:20] I want it rebuilt I want it restored I
[1:09:23] want to see Jerusalem built back up
[1:09:26] I've got to go back
[1:09:28] I've got to return
[1:09:31] something burning in their hearts we've
[1:09:33] got to get back
[1:09:34] we have to go back to the faith of the
[1:09:36] fathers there's a work that I have to do
[1:09:39] there's a work we have to do I can't be
[1:09:42] stopped I won't be stopped I won't stop
[1:09:45] short something's driving me back
[1:09:47] something's pushing me brother Daryl I
[1:09:49] can't stop today I got to go a little
[1:09:50] further tomorrow I can't give up even
[1:09:52] though others have quit even though
[1:09:54] others have stayed back I gotta go
[1:09:55] others say I don't need to go that's
[1:09:57] okay but I'm going I don't I don't see
[1:09:59] the reason it's okay something within me
[1:10:01] says go back get back in that place
[1:10:04] rebuild it prepare Jerusalem
[1:10:10] the return in the rebuilding restored
[1:10:13] the worship that the fathers had had
[1:10:15] not the version of worship that they had
[1:10:18] practiced in Babylon
[1:10:21] come on Church
[1:10:23] we shouldn't be practicing the same kind
[1:10:25] of worship they're practicing in Babylon
[1:10:27] it should be a different kind of worship
[1:10:29] it should be a restored worship it
[1:10:31] should be a return worship
[1:10:34] their hearts were turned to the faith of
[1:10:36] their fathers by the moving of the
[1:10:38] spirit
[1:10:42] I will restore
[1:10:44] saith the Lord
[1:10:47] and what's awesome about this is the
[1:10:49] king begins to give back
[1:10:52] that does my heart good man
[1:10:54] all that was stolen through the years of
[1:10:56] Babylonian captivity
[1:10:58] all the years that the church was stuck
[1:11:01] under Roman rule all the years that they
[1:11:03] were stuck there in mystery Babylon Ezra
[1:11:05] one and seven also Cyrus the king
[1:11:07] brought forth the vessels of the house
[1:11:09] of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had
[1:11:11] brought forth out of Jerusalem and had
[1:11:13] put them in the house of his gods notice
[1:11:16] these are things stolen from the
[1:11:18] original place of worship for the
[1:11:20] worship of false gods
[1:11:22] and King Cyrus goes now this don't
[1:11:24] belong here
[1:11:25] this needs to be put back even those did
[1:11:28] Cyrus King of Persia bring forth by the
[1:11:30] hand of mystery death the treasurer and
[1:11:33] numbered them unto chest Bazaar the
[1:11:35] prince of Judah and this is the number
[1:11:36] of them 30 Chargers of gold a thousand
[1:11:39] Chargers of silver nine and twenty
[1:11:42] knives 30 basins of gold silver basins
[1:11:45] of a second sort 410 and other vessels a
[1:11:48] thousand all the vessels of gold and
[1:11:50] silver were 5 400. all these the chest
[1:11:54] Bazaar bring up with them of the
[1:11:55] Captivity that were brought up from
[1:11:58] Babylon unto Jerusalem
[1:12:00] the king says these things
[1:12:02] still belong in the house of God
[1:12:06] come on Church these things still belong
[1:12:10] this was taken from the church down in
[1:12:12] Babylon these doctrines were robbed from
[1:12:15] the church when they were down in
[1:12:16] Babylon true baptism put it back God had
[1:12:20] put it back serpent seed put it back
[1:12:23] eternal security put it back put them
[1:12:26] back where they belong this doesn't
[1:12:28] belong here put it back in the house of
[1:12:31] God the Supernatural is robbed put it
[1:12:34] back the gifts have been brought from
[1:12:36] the church take them back put them back
[1:12:38] in their worship back to the original
[1:12:40] worship the freedom of worship has been
[1:12:43] railed from the people given God give
[1:12:46] them back their worship give them back
[1:12:48] their freedom give it back to them they
[1:12:51] won't be robbed anymore this belongs to
[1:12:54] them give it back
[1:12:57] he says this doesn't belong to me this
[1:13:00] is God's and the King says you can have
[1:13:03] it back tonight
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:07] oh and this that the canker worm took
[1:13:10] and this that the Palmer worm took here
[1:13:13] are the gifts of the Spirit put them
[1:13:14] back in the worship
[1:13:16] these blessings belong to you
[1:13:20] and the king decrees take these things
[1:13:22] back and put them in the worship where
[1:13:26] they belong
[1:13:29] in order to worship like they did at the
[1:13:31] original
[1:13:32] you're going to need these things
[1:13:34] because if you go back and build a
[1:13:36] temple
[1:13:37] and you have all the form of godliness
[1:13:39] but you don't have these things it ain't
[1:13:41] the original worship
[1:13:43] you haven't returned
[1:13:47] Hallelujah
[1:13:50] and as the work begins
[1:13:52] and progresses
[1:13:55] and there's no way for me to go into the
[1:13:57] depths of a lot of these things so we're
[1:13:58] going to go
[1:13:59] best we can
[1:14:01] even though they're a small group
[1:14:03] even though they're a hated group even
[1:14:05] though there's opposition to them on
[1:14:07] every hand nobody wants to see this
[1:14:10] Temple rebuild
[1:14:11] nobody wants to see these walls rebuilt
[1:14:15] there's opposition
[1:14:17] but the king keeps providing for them
[1:14:20] every step of the way
[1:14:24] Ezra 3 7 they gave money also to the
[1:14:27] Masons and to the Carpenters and meet
[1:14:30] and drink and all unto them of Zidane
[1:14:32] and to them of Tire to bring cedar trees
[1:14:35] from Lebanon to the Sea of Joppa
[1:14:38] according to the grant that they had of
[1:14:40] Cyrus King of Persia listen when you're
[1:14:43] on this journey this is the King's
[1:14:45] journey and he says I'm going to provide
[1:14:47] everything you have need of you're
[1:14:50] trying to get back to the original I'll
[1:14:52] pay the wages I'll provide the materials
[1:14:54] I'll give you the blessings I'll give
[1:14:56] you the faith I'll give you the strength
[1:14:57] I'll give you everything you have need
[1:14:59] of in this journey the king is supplying
[1:15:02] everything you have need of along this
[1:15:04] journey you don't gotta worry you ain't
[1:15:06] gonna want you ain't gonna come up short
[1:15:08] you're not gonna stop I can't stop he's
[1:15:10] pouring strength in he's pouring faith
[1:15:13] in he's pouring overcoming power in he's
[1:15:15] giving me everything I need to get all
[1:15:18] the way back
[1:15:22] but it Brown says but God protected them
[1:15:26] and they had forgotten it
[1:15:28] how quickly our Pentecostal Believers
[1:15:30] are forgetting
[1:15:31] that you were saved by his grace
[1:15:34] filled with his spirit
[1:15:36] in this great tremendous dying time to
[1:15:38] the church don't forget that that God
[1:15:41] that give you the Holy Spirit to live by
[1:15:43] and to make this journey is with you
[1:15:45] every step
[1:15:47] of the way
[1:15:50] the journey that we're on is a
[1:15:53] Vindicated Journey
[1:15:55] and it's been Vindicated by an edict
[1:15:57] from the King
[1:15:58] and when the king sends you on a mission
[1:16:00] he's going to provide you with
[1:16:02] everything that you have need of to be
[1:16:04] successful
[1:16:05] because once he signs off on it it ain't
[1:16:07] your mission it's his mission
[1:16:09] it's the king's Mission with the King
[1:16:11] Signet and he don't want it to fail he's
[1:16:14] not going to let it fail but quit
[1:16:16] listening to the devil

[1:16:20] the well you're not going to make it you
[1:16:22] just don't have enough this is the
[1:16:24] King's work this is the King's edict
[1:16:26] this is the King's return I can't not
[1:16:29] make it the king is walking with me

[1:16:33] every step of the way everything you
[1:16:35] have need of he will supply you right on
[1:16:39] time

[1:17:48] God's got a ladder there if you're
[1:17:50] interested in getting it
[1:17:53] now see that's where a lot of people are
[1:17:55] they want it they say they do but it's
[1:17:57] just Out Of Reach well I guess I
[1:17:58] can't have it
[1:18:00] they got to kick over a few things they
[1:18:02] come no no no that ain't my nature
[1:18:06] it's not in my nature to do that that's
[1:18:08] why we preach a nature change
[1:18:16] listen
[1:18:17] I don't know that it's in anybody's
[1:18:19] nature to act the way they acted on the
[1:18:21] day of Pentecost
[1:18:24] nobody just wakes up and just goes
[1:18:26] stumbling around acting drunk why are
[1:18:27] you doing that this is just my nature
[1:18:32] it's about laying your nature down
[1:18:35] it's about saying whatever I got to do
[1:18:37] to get it I'm going to get it I don't
[1:18:38] care what anybody says I don't care what
[1:18:39] anybody calls me I don't care how I
[1:18:41] don't care how I look I don't care if

[1:18:51] to get it I'm going to do whatever I
[1:18:53] gotta do to get it it's in the store
[1:18:56] it's paid for it don't walk away cause
[1:18:58] you can't quite reach it don't give up
[1:19:00] fight for it tonight do whatever you got
[1:19:03] to do to get it
[1:19:09] even though the majority of folks are
[1:19:10] staying in Babylon
[1:19:13] there's a drive in these people
[1:19:17] we must rebuild Jerusalem
[1:19:19] we must rebuild the city we must rebuild
[1:19:22] the Temple the wall it must be rebuilt
[1:19:25] there must be a restoration
[1:19:28] and with edicts from the king with
[1:19:30] everything they need provided by the
[1:19:32] king they return
[1:19:33] and they begin to work they begin to
[1:19:35] rebuild
[1:19:37] and as they return to the original
[1:19:38] worship
[1:19:40] and to the original faith
[1:19:43] it could not be mixed with other
[1:19:47] worships
[1:19:48] excuse me it couldn't be mixed with the
[1:19:51] Theology of man
[1:19:53] it couldn't be polluted with Babylon
[1:19:56] it had to be free from denomination
[1:20:00] it has to be pure worship as it was at
[1:20:03] the beginning in spirit and in truth
[1:20:07] Ezra 4 1
[1:20:09] . now when the adversaries notice this
[1:20:11] is the key word
[1:20:13] the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin
[1:20:16] heard that the children of the Captivity
[1:20:17] Bill did the temple unto the Lord God of
[1:20:19] Israel
[1:20:20] then they came to zerubul and to the
[1:20:22] chief of the fathers and said unto them
[1:20:24] let us build with you
[1:20:26] man awesome
[1:20:28] help
[1:20:30] who doesn't want help
[1:20:33] everybody would like some help
[1:20:35] I mean it would be rude and
[1:20:36] unchristian-like to turn down their help
[1:20:40] let us build with you for we seek your
[1:20:42] God these people want to be saved
[1:20:47] remember they're adversaries
[1:20:52] we seek your God as you do and we do
[1:20:55] sacrifice unto him since the days of
[1:20:57] Essa Hardin king of Asser which brought
[1:21:00] us up hither
[1:21:02] it's very reasonable
[1:21:04] but remember I'm gonna say it
[1:21:06] adversaries
[1:21:08] sure brother Brown and we'll support you
[1:21:10] we'll help you just knock off the women
[1:21:13] a little bit
[1:21:15] oh we'd love to be a help to you well
[1:21:17] we'll even get behind you and support
[1:21:18] this campaign just quit preaching that
[1:21:20] serpent seed so much but we want to help
[1:21:23] you we want to get the message out there
[1:21:25] we want to serve God just like you we'll
[1:21:28] we'll support this campaign but make
[1:21:30] sure you don't you know preach about the
[1:21:32] invisible Union or anything like that
[1:21:35] it couldn't be mixed
[1:21:40] the word adversary here means oppress or
[1:21:44] press someone hard
[1:21:46] prior to the Jews returning from Exile
[1:21:49] these people had been the rulers and
[1:21:52] people of the area and now they are
[1:21:54] resenting losing the power of the region
[1:21:57] they don't want to lose their people and
[1:22:01] so they offer a hand
[1:22:03] let me help
[1:22:04] but reservable verse 3 and Joshua and
[1:22:07] the rest of the chief of the fathers of
[1:22:09] Israel said unto them you have nothing
[1:22:11] to do with us to build a house unto our
[1:22:13] God but we ourselves together will build
[1:22:16] unto the Lord God of Israel as king
[1:22:18] Cyrus the King of Persia hath commanded
[1:22:21] us
[1:22:22] the king told us to return the king
[1:22:26] commanded us to build a temple the edict
[1:22:28] told me to take the land
[1:22:31] so the Samaritan's generous offer to
[1:22:33] help with the construction is actually a
[1:22:35] very thinly veiled plot to retain
[1:22:37] control and influence because if the
[1:22:40] Jewish leaders accept their help then
[1:22:42] the worship of Yahweh will be corrupted
[1:22:44] by mixture with Pagan practices
[1:22:47] well you can't keep us from doing that
[1:22:49] we helped you build this
[1:22:52] we can sacrifice here too we helped you
[1:22:54] build this
[1:22:56] and so they say no no no you'll have no
[1:22:58] hand in this it must be a pure
[1:23:00] unadulterated word it must be pure
[1:23:03] original faith of the fathers
[1:23:06] and when they find here no compromise
[1:23:10] when the Samaritans find that that these
[1:23:12] are going to stay true to the King's
[1:23:14] Command no matter what the pressure
[1:23:16] then instead of offering help they turn
[1:23:18] and they begin to try to hinder it
[1:23:21] verse 4 then the people of the land
[1:23:23] weaken the hands of the people of Judah
[1:23:25] and troubled them in building
[1:23:27] and hired counselors against them to
[1:23:29] frustrate their purpose all the days of
[1:23:31] Cyrus King of Persia even until the
[1:23:33] reign of Darius King of Persia and in
[1:23:36] the reign of a hazarus the beginning of
[1:23:38] his Reign wrote they unto him an
[1:23:40] accusation against the inhabitants of
[1:23:42] Judah and Jerusalem
[1:23:45] so here their stand for truth comes at a
[1:23:47] cost
[1:23:49] one thing you can be sure of is that
[1:23:51] you're going to face opposition in the
[1:23:54] return
[1:23:55] as you preach a return you're going to
[1:23:57] face opposition when you practice that
[1:24:00] return you're gonna face mocking and
[1:24:02] opposition
[1:24:03] the enemy who doesn't want to see you
[1:24:06] back in the Homeland is going to oppose
[1:24:09] you
[1:24:09] he doesn't want to deal with the power
[1:24:12] of God once again in the church he don't
[1:24:15] want to deal with the book of Acts
[1:24:17] church again walking on the face of the
[1:24:18] Earth he doesn't want the people to
[1:24:21] return to where they need to be in order
[1:24:24] to receive the promise
[1:24:28] so he mocks and he hinders and he laughs
[1:24:31] and he raises an opposition in the
[1:24:35] restoration
[1:24:36] and he tries to stop the work because
[1:24:39] I want to put it simply because he knows
[1:24:41] how to read
[1:24:43] sure he does he knows what the
[1:24:45] prophecies say
[1:24:46] he knows where Israel is going to be
[1:24:49] blessed
[1:24:50] he knows where the Fulfillment of
[1:24:52] Prophecy is supposed to take place
[1:24:55] it's come stuck in Babylon
[1:24:57] he needs you hanging on to your
[1:24:59] denominational ideas
[1:25:01] he needs them Bound by Traditions he
[1:25:04] doesn't need Jerusalem to be rebuilt he
[1:25:06] can't have a people turned back to that
[1:25:09] original Faith he knows what that
[1:25:11] original Faith did to him when he had to
[1:25:13] face it two thousand years ago he knows
[1:25:16] what that faith will do so he tries to
[1:25:18] hinder so he fights it and he
[1:25:20] discourages it and he brings false
[1:25:22] accusations
[1:25:25] we're going to skip books here for a
[1:25:26] minute and go over into Nehemiah because
[1:25:28] they also had made an early and it's all
[1:25:29] kind of part of the same restoration the
[1:25:31] rebuilding of Jerusalem Nehemiah is more
[1:25:34] about the building of the wall where
[1:25:35] Ezra is more about the rebuilding of the
[1:25:37] Temple
[1:25:38] but in Nehemiah 2 19.
[1:25:41] it says but when sand ballot and her and
[1:25:43] I and tobiah the servant the ammonite
[1:25:45] and guesstimate the Arabian heard it
[1:25:47] they laughed us to scorn
[1:25:50] you're going back to their ritual
[1:25:54] Pentecostals
[1:25:57] oh that jumping shot
[1:25:59] they left us to scorn
[1:26:02] and despised us and said what is this
[1:26:05] thing that you do
[1:26:06] will you rebel against the king
[1:26:09] listen when things began to get brought
[1:26:12] back to what they once were those that
[1:26:14] don't want to see it returned will scoff
[1:26:17] at it
[1:26:19] they will make fun of it because they
[1:26:21] don't want it to be returned there
[1:26:23] because they don't want to have to
[1:26:25] return themselves
[1:26:29] so they don't want to see it built up
[1:26:31] Nehemiah 4 1 but it came to pass that
[1:26:34] when Sam Ballard heard that we builded
[1:26:35] the wall he was Roth and took great
[1:26:38] indignation and mocked the Jews
[1:26:41] Nehemiah 6 6 wherein was written it is
[1:26:45] reported among the Heathen and gas
[1:26:47] smooth saith that thou and the Jews
[1:26:50] think to Rebel for which cause thou
[1:26:52] buildeth the wall that thou mayest be
[1:26:54] their King according to these words
[1:26:57] you know this struck me
[1:27:00] here is a minister a prophet
[1:27:03] on a mission from the King doing what
[1:27:06] the King has asked him to do and he's
[1:27:08] accused of Kingdom building
[1:27:11] you're building this wall so you can
[1:27:13] have your own kingdom you're doing this
[1:27:16] just to be different so you can rebel
[1:27:17] against the king
[1:27:19] you know why I said that
[1:27:22] anybody that hangs out with Timothy
[1:27:23] should know because he's stupid
[1:27:28] he's on a mission doing what the king
[1:27:31] told him to do
[1:27:33] Nehemiah isn't worried about these
[1:27:34] accusations he isn't worried about the
[1:27:37] mocking he isn't worried about any of
[1:27:39] this because he has an edict from the
[1:27:41] King go rebuild the wall the wall must
[1:27:43] be rebuilt that's what the king told him
[1:27:46] to do go back to Nehemiah 2 and 7
[1:27:49] moreover I said unto the king if it
[1:27:51] pleased the king let letters
[1:27:53] be given to me to the governors beyond
[1:27:55] the river that they may convey me over
[1:27:57] till I come into Judah in a letter unto
[1:27:59] ASAP The Keeper of the king's force that
[1:28:01] he may give me Timber to make beams for
[1:28:04] the gates of the palace which app
[1:28:07] pertained to the house and for the wall
[1:28:09] of the city and for the house that I
[1:28:11] shall enter in and the King granted me
[1:28:14] according to the good hand of my God
[1:28:17] upon me
[1:28:19] it doesn't matter what the critics say
[1:28:21] it doesn't matter what the devil says it
[1:28:24] doesn't matter what those who don't want
[1:28:26] to return say we have the authority of
[1:28:29] the king to return He said go back and
[1:28:33] take what you need and be successful and
[1:28:35] overcome and go back to the faith of the
[1:28:38] fathers and build up that Foundation
[1:28:41] go back
[1:28:44] we have an edict from the King
[1:28:47] the king says I want it restored
[1:28:51] I want my church the way she was
[1:28:55] build her back up I want you to return
[1:28:58] to the Pentecost
[1:29:00] of Jerusalem
[1:29:08] and I've got a message from the King to
[1:29:10] prove it
[1:29:12] prophet of God would say the holy spirit
[1:29:14] is in the church to swing the faith back
[1:29:16] again to the original faith that's right
[1:29:18] for he will turn the hearts of the
[1:29:20] children back to the fathers the first
[1:29:22] time he turned the heart of the fathers
[1:29:24] to the children this time the hearts of
[1:29:26] the children to the father see taking
[1:29:28] the faith that the fathers had and
[1:29:29] placed it over here on the children the
[1:29:31] one that's just then coming in and this
[1:29:33] time he's going to take the same Faith
[1:29:36] because they got away from the original
[1:29:38] faith and he's going to turn the faith
[1:29:40] of the fathers and the children back to
[1:29:41] the fathers the Pentecostal fathers
[1:29:44] another acts 2. that's right another one
[1:29:48] he says
[1:29:50] foreign
[1:29:52] what is this
[1:29:53] this is the king decreeing and writing
[1:29:56] an edict you can have exactly what they
[1:29:58] had on the day of Pentecost
[1:30:00] you can have exactly what they had in
[1:30:02] the book of Acts the king issued an
[1:30:04] edict and said rebuild the wall rebuild
[1:30:06] the Temple get Jerusalem ready
[1:30:09] and Ezra now having turned down the help
[1:30:11] of the hybridized religion now faces
[1:30:13] their attacks as they try to Hinder
[1:30:15] and Cyrus is no longer on the throne and
[1:30:18] for a time a new king is ruling and they
[1:30:20] begin to write letters unto him
[1:30:22] negative letters
[1:30:24] and we have a lot of scriptures to read
[1:30:26] as we go so I hope that's okay
[1:30:28] Ezra 4 12 be it known unto the king that
[1:30:31] the Jews which came up from thee to us
[1:30:33] are come unto Jerusalem building the re
[1:30:37] the rebellious and the bad City and have
[1:30:40] set up the walls thereof and joined the
[1:30:43] foundations be it known now unto the
[1:30:46] king that if this city be building and
[1:30:48] the walls set up again then will they
[1:30:51] not pay toll tributes and customs and so
[1:30:54] Thou shalt and damage the revenue of the
[1:30:57] Kings verse 15.
[1:30:59] he tells them
[1:31:01] that search may be made in the book of
[1:31:04] the records of thy fathers they say go
[1:31:06] back and look in the records of your
[1:31:07] fathers and see if it's not true that
[1:31:09] these people are rebellious people that
[1:31:11] they're going to cause trouble for you
[1:31:12] it says search in the book of the
[1:31:14] records of thy father so that thou find
[1:31:16] in the book of the records and know that
[1:31:18] this city is a rebellious City and
[1:31:20] hurtful unto Kings and provinces and
[1:31:22] that they have moved sedition within the
[1:31:24] same of old time for which cause was
[1:31:27] this city destroyed
[1:31:29] they tell the king that if this work
[1:31:31] continues these people are going to
[1:31:33] cause trouble
[1:31:35] yes Lord
[1:31:38] these people are going to cause trouble
[1:31:39] look in the records and see if they
[1:31:41] weren't once rebellious
[1:31:43] look in the records and see if they
[1:31:45] weren't sinners
[1:31:46] look in the records and see if they
[1:31:48] haven't failed time and time again look
[1:31:51] at their past
[1:31:52] look at their past now they claim to be
[1:31:55] free now they claim to be filled with
[1:31:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost King
[1:31:59] search it out who are they to rebuild
[1:32:01] anything this is the same church that
[1:32:04] fell away and caused all the trouble
[1:32:07] and for a time it works
[1:32:10] for a time that causes the work on the
[1:32:12] temple to cease as a search is made
[1:32:15] and listen all the things they said were
[1:32:18] true
[1:32:20] I was a failure I was a sinner
[1:32:23] I did horrible things all those things
[1:32:26] are 100 true
[1:32:28] but that fact
[1:32:30] didn't change the truth of the matter
[1:32:32] that the King has given and edict the
[1:32:35] king said I can go free the king said
[1:32:37] that I could have the baptism of the
[1:32:38] Holy Ghost the king said that my sins
[1:32:40] would be forgotten there was an edict
[1:32:42] that the king said I didn't have to live
[1:32:44] under that condemnation anymore
[1:32:47] but as the king searches and he finds
[1:32:49] that some of these things are are true
[1:32:52] sure the church had fallen
[1:32:55] yes the Church of the ages had failed
[1:32:58] Pentecost had failed worship wasn't
[1:33:01] being done in spiritual in spirit and
[1:33:03] truth but that didn't stop the fact that
[1:33:05] the king had written and edict and said
[1:33:07] restore
[1:33:08] I will restore build it back up build
[1:33:11] the temple the king said you're forgiven
[1:33:13] none of that changed that the king said
[1:33:16] you can have whatever you need to finish
[1:33:18] the job and so we moved to Ezra five and
[1:33:21] one and in this time what God does in in
[1:33:24] the time of trouble is he raises up a
[1:33:26] prophet
[1:33:27] and he raises up a prophet and said then
[1:33:29] the prophets and the prophet the prophet
[1:33:32] in Zechariah the son of Edo prophesied
[1:33:34] unto the Jews that were in Judah and
[1:33:36] Jerusalem in the name of the god of
[1:33:38] Israel even unto them then rose up
[1:33:41] zerubbabel the son of shittiel and
[1:33:43] Joshua the son of Joseph and began to
[1:33:46] build the house of God which is at
[1:33:48] Jerusalem and with them were the
[1:33:50] prophets of God helping them in response
[1:33:53] to the enemy trying to stop the
[1:33:55] restoration God raises up a prophet just
[1:33:58] when it seems like all denominations
[1:33:59] have failed God raises up a prophet just
[1:34:02] when it seems like we can't go forward
[1:34:04] God raises up a prophet and these people
[1:34:06] take the message and they continue
[1:34:08] building they take the message of the
[1:34:10] prophet and they are encouraged and they
[1:34:12] continue to build they said listen we
[1:34:14] didn't come back here to worship like
[1:34:16] we're in Babylon we didn't come back
[1:34:18] here to live a denominational life we
[1:34:21] didn't come back here to stop short we
[1:34:23] came back here to finish the job we came
[1:34:26] back here to go over away we came back
[1:34:28] to restore Worship in the faith of the
[1:34:31] original fathers we didn't come back to
[1:34:34] settle for what they got in Babylon I
[1:34:37] haven't come this far to stop short I'm
[1:34:40] going all the way back and I'm gonna
[1:34:43] restore what God Said to restore rebuild
[1:34:47] rebuild rebuild
[1:34:55] it didn't matter what the critics said
[1:34:58] we're going back to Pentecost
[1:35:01] the devil didn't like that one
[1:35:03] so once again he raises up
[1:35:06] naysayers says who Do You Think You Are
[1:35:11] chapter 5 verse 3. at the same time came
[1:35:14] to them tight and I governor of this
[1:35:16] side of the river
[1:35:18] and shethar bosni and their Companions
[1:35:20] and said thus unto them who hath
[1:35:23] commanded you to build this house and to
[1:35:26] make up this wall
[1:35:28] and once again they write to the king
[1:35:31] a negative report
[1:35:33] this will be a rather long reading stick
[1:35:35] with me Ezra 5 and 8.
[1:35:38] be it known unto the king
[1:35:40] that we went into the province of Judea
[1:35:43] to the house of the great God which is
[1:35:45] builded with great stones and Timber is
[1:35:46] laid in the walls and this work goeth
[1:35:49] fast on Hallelujah
[1:35:53] and prospereth in their hands
[1:35:55] then ask we those elders and said unto
[1:35:58] them who commanded you to build this
[1:36:00] house and to make up these walls we ask
[1:36:03] their names also to certify thee that we
[1:36:05] might write their names of the men and
[1:36:07] we're the chief of them the men that
[1:36:09] were the chief of them and thus they
[1:36:11] returned us answer saying we are the
[1:36:13] Servants of the god of Heaven and Earth
[1:36:15] and build the house that was builted
[1:36:17] these many years ago which a great king
[1:36:18] of Israel builded and set up
[1:36:21] but after that our fathers had provoked
[1:36:23] the god of Heaven under wrath and he
[1:36:25] gave them into the hand of
[1:36:26] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon the
[1:36:28] Chaldean who destroyed this house and
[1:36:30] carried the people away into Babylon but
[1:36:32] in the first year of Cyrus the king of
[1:36:34] Babylon the same King Cyrus made a
[1:36:36] decree to build this house of God and
[1:36:39] the vest was also of gold and silver of
[1:36:41] the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar
[1:36:42] took out of the temple that was in
[1:36:43] Jerusalem and brought them into the
[1:36:45] Temple of Babylon those that Tyrus the
[1:36:48] king take out of the Temple of Babylon
[1:36:49] and they were delivered unto one whose
[1:36:52] name was just bizarre whom he had made
[1:36:54] governor and said unto him take these
[1:36:57] vessels go carry them into the temple
[1:36:58] that is in Jerusalem and let the house
[1:37:00] of God be builded in this place
[1:37:02] then came the same chest Bazaar and laid
[1:37:04] the foundation of the house of God which
[1:37:06] is in Jerusalem and since that time even
[1:37:08] until now hath it been in building and
[1:37:10] yet it is not finished now therefore if
[1:37:13] it seemed good to the king let there be
[1:37:15] a search made in the king's Treasure
[1:37:17] House which is there at Babylon whether
[1:37:20] it be so that a decree was made of Cyrus
[1:37:23] the king to build the house of God at
[1:37:26] Jerusalem and let the king send his
[1:37:28] pleasure to us concerning the matter I
[1:37:31] would like you to search the records O
[1:37:33] King to see if these people really are
[1:37:34] supposed to return to Pentecost
[1:37:36] I'd like you to go through the
[1:37:38] scriptures and see if that's really what
[1:37:39] these people are supposed to do trying
[1:37:41] to restore this worship trying to
[1:37:43] restore this and build this back up I'd
[1:37:45] like you to look and see if they really
[1:37:47] have a right to do this
[1:37:50] verse 6. then Darius the king made a
[1:37:53] decree and a search was made in the
[1:37:54] house of the Rose where the treasures
[1:37:56] were laid up in Babylon and there was
[1:37:58] found at acmetha in the palace that is
[1:38:01] in the province of the medes a role and
[1:38:03] therein was a record thus written in the
[1:38:06] first year of Cyrus the King the same
[1:38:08] Cyrus the king made a decree concerning
[1:38:10] the house of God at Jerusalem let the
[1:38:12] house be building the place where they
[1:38:15] offered sacrifices and let the
[1:38:17] foundation thereof be laid and the
[1:38:19] height thereof three score cubits and
[1:38:21] the breadth thereof three score cubits
[1:38:23] with three rows of great stones in a row
[1:38:25] of new Timber and let the expenses be
[1:38:27] given out of the King's house I'm gonna
[1:38:29] pay for it I'm gonna give it to him I'm
[1:38:32] gonna restore they ain't gonna have to
[1:38:34] do nothing the king's gonna provide
[1:38:37] hey man it's in the king's record it's
[1:38:40] in the king's record you have every
[1:38:43] right
[1:38:44] it's in the king's records
[1:38:47] Hallelujah
[1:38:52] and also let the golden and silver
[1:38:54] vessels of the house of God which
[1:38:56] Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the
[1:38:58] temple which is at Jerusalem and brought
[1:39:00] unto Babylon be restored and brought
[1:39:02] again unto the temple which is at
[1:39:03] Jerusalem every one to his place those
[1:39:07] things are supposed to be there it's
[1:39:08] their place
[1:39:10] and place them in the house of God now
[1:39:13] therefore it's hat now the governor
[1:39:14] beyond the river shut the Zone I don't

[1:45:58] y'all forgive me
[1:46:00] father dear we sometimes
[1:46:03] we get happy
[1:46:04] and we just really act like a bunch of
[1:46:06] children
[1:46:09] guilty
[1:46:13] but it's because we're free
[1:46:16] we're not under the bondage of evil or
[1:46:18] Traditions or any certain thing of the
[1:46:21] elders
[1:46:22] we're just free in the Holy Spirit and
[1:46:25] we can sing and worship you and
[1:46:27] fellowship around the word and enjoy
[1:46:29] ourselves
[1:46:32] to that we might praise the almighty God
[1:46:34] oh after seeing all the chaos of formal
[1:46:37] religions and all the kinds of idol
[1:46:40] worship and to think that you were so
[1:46:42] good to me that let you let me know you
[1:46:45] in the power of your resurrection and to
[1:46:48] be able to tell others about it we're
[1:46:53] so happy
[1:46:56] this is the King's Commission
[1:46:59] this isn't by man
[1:47:01] this is mandated by the king
[1:47:06] I'm gonna skip a few things to get to
[1:47:07] this ending
[1:47:10] there may be few helping and many
[1:47:12] opposing
[1:47:13] but tonight the battle is the Lord's
[1:47:16] it's the king's edict
[1:47:18] he said not by might nor by power but by
[1:47:20] my spirit saith the Lord this was
[1:47:22] actually a prophecy to zerubbabel as
[1:47:24] he's trying to get this done he sees
[1:47:25] himself right he said
[1:47:27] this ain't gonna be done by power or
[1:47:29] might it's going to be done by my spirit
[1:47:32] the original worship is going to be
[1:47:34] returned by my spirit and brother
[1:47:36] Randall comes along and says the bride
[1:47:39] won't be put in her place by military
[1:47:40] force
[1:47:42] but by my spirit
[1:47:43] saith the Lord the bride's going to be
[1:47:46] placed back in the original by his
[1:47:50] spirit
[1:47:51] now not everyone returned
[1:47:54] only the ones that God had moved upon
[1:47:55] their hearts
[1:47:57] but the ones who returned came back
[1:47:58] because they wanted to worship Jehovah
[1:48:01] and they wanted to be where God had
[1:48:03] called them to be
[1:48:06] they had to be where God had called them
[1:48:08] to be there was something moving them
[1:48:10] back something calling come out of her
[1:48:12] my people something turning their hearts
[1:48:14] back what was it
[1:48:15] because even just like today something's
[1:48:17] drawing them back they take their Elias
[1:48:20] what is it
[1:48:21] they got to be in the Homeland for
[1:48:23] something what is it why do we got to go
[1:48:26] back
[1:48:27] why do we have to go back
[1:48:30] Israel had to be established
[1:48:33] the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem
[1:48:36] Micah 5 2 but thou Bethlehem euphrita
[1:48:40] though thou be little among the
[1:48:41] thousands of Judah yet out of these
[1:48:44] shall come forth unto me that is to be
[1:48:45] the ruler in Israel
[1:48:47] whose going forth have been from old
[1:48:49] from Everlasting you see right here that
[1:48:52] Israel had to be established
[1:48:54] it had to be their Bethlehem had to be
[1:48:57] there Israel had to be in her Homeland
[1:48:59] Jerusalem had to be rebuilt there was a
[1:49:03] promised Messiah to come there Zechariah
[1:49:06] 9 9 Rejoice greatly o Daughters of Zion
[1:49:08] shout o daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy
[1:49:11] King cometh unto thee he is just and
[1:49:13] having salvation lowly and riding upon
[1:49:15] an ass and upon a cult the foal of an
[1:49:17] ass they had to return
[1:49:21] in order to receive
[1:49:25] they had to be where he was going to
[1:49:28] come to
[1:49:29] prophecy had to be fulfilled and even if
[1:49:33] they didn't know why they were driven
[1:49:36] they had a will to work they had a mind
[1:49:38] to work they had to be there things had
[1:49:40] to be ready they built a wall in just a
[1:49:42] matter of days they worked they worked
[1:49:44] opposition came they worked well I don't
[1:49:45] know we're driven we got to get back we
[1:49:47] got to get back to the original we got
[1:49:50] to get the faith restored something has
[1:49:52] to be and they worked and they built and
[1:49:54] they tried to get back to what the
[1:49:55] original was
[1:49:57] but when they got it all laid out
[1:50:00] in Ezra 3 and 12 it says many of the
[1:50:02] priests and Levites
[1:50:04] and chief of the fathers who were
[1:50:05] ancient men
[1:50:07] that had seen the first temple when the
[1:50:10] foundation of this house was laid Before
[1:50:12] Their Eyes they wept with a loud voice
[1:50:15] they felt like they had failed
[1:50:20] they felt like it didn't compare
[1:50:22] they felt like they had fallen short
[1:50:26] two and one
[1:50:29] in the seventh month in the one and
[1:50:31] twentieth day of the month came the word
[1:50:32] of the Lord by the prophet haggai sang
[1:50:34] speak now to desirable the son of
[1:50:37] shatiel governor of Judah and to Joshua
[1:50:40] the son of Joseph the high priest and to
[1:50:43] the residue of the people saying who is
[1:50:46] left among you that saw this house in
[1:50:48] her first Glory
[1:50:49] and how do you see it now is it not in
[1:50:52] your eyes in comparison of it as nothing
[1:50:56] it doesn't even compare
[1:50:59] we work so hard
[1:51:01] we're still standing we're still
[1:51:03] fighting we tried to get back to the
[1:51:05] original
[1:51:06] we tried to be just like that first
[1:51:08] stage we tried to get the foundation
[1:51:10] exactly how it was
[1:51:12] but it didn't have the Ark in it
[1:51:14] it didn't have the urine with thumbing
[1:51:16] it didn't have the fire that fell and
[1:51:18] filled the temple and started looking at
[1:51:20] it going
[1:51:22] what have we done
[1:51:24] yet now be strong
[1:51:27] he turns and he begins to encourage
[1:51:28] those are rubable saith the Lord and be
[1:51:30] strong o Joshua son of Joe sedek the
[1:51:32] high priest and be strong all you people
[1:51:34] of the lands hate the Lord and work for
[1:51:37] I Am with You saith the Lord of hosts
[1:51:39] according to the word that I covenanted
[1:51:42] with you when you came out of Egypt so
[1:51:44] my spirit remaineth with you fear not
[1:51:48] for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet
[1:51:51] once it is a little while and I will
[1:51:53] shake the heavens and the earth and the
[1:51:55] Sea and the dry land and I will shake
[1:51:57] All Nations and the desire of all the
[1:52:00] nations shall come and I will fill this
[1:52:02] house with Glory say the Lord of hosts
[1:52:05] what's he saying to him it's just a
[1:52:07] little wall and you're going to have the
[1:52:09] Messiah here
[1:52:10] just a little while and the Messiah is
[1:52:13] going to be here and he's going to shake
[1:52:14] the Nations he's going to be the desire
[1:52:16] of the Nations just a little while and
[1:52:19] the Messiah is going to be here verse 8
[1:52:20] the silver is mine and the gold is mine
[1:52:23] saith the Lord of hosts in other words
[1:52:24] don't be concerned that this Temple
[1:52:26] don't have silver in Gold that all
[1:52:28] belongs to me anyway
[1:52:32] the glory of this latter house shall be
[1:52:35] greater than the former saith the Lord
[1:52:37] and in this place will I give peace
[1:52:40] saith the Lord of hosts don't be
[1:52:41] concerned about the silver and gold but
[1:52:44] this house is going to exceed the first
[1:52:46] house because the presence of the very
[1:52:49] Messiah is going to walk in this house
[1:52:52] the Messiah is going to be dedicated in
[1:52:54] this Temple the Messiah is going to
[1:52:56] teach in this Temple the Messiah is
[1:52:59] going to drive out the money changers in
[1:53:01] this Temple his presence is going to be
[1:53:04] the glory of it it's going to be his
[1:53:07] coming that is the glory of it
[1:53:10] the temple had to be restored the
[1:53:12] rebuilding of Jerusalem was for the
[1:53:14] coming of the king
[1:53:16] and we look around
[1:53:17] and we get discouraged
[1:53:19] sometimes he deserves so much better
[1:53:22] my that Apostolic age
[1:53:25] now look at what they had
[1:53:27] Maha they were better they were wrecked
[1:53:29] they were men of faith I don't measure
[1:53:30] up Lord we've tried so hard we've
[1:53:32] battled so hard we're still standing
[1:53:34] here Lord
[1:53:35] and maybe like them tears come into the
[1:53:37] eyes when we look at what we've done and
[1:53:39] we think it's
[1:53:41] it doesn't compare
[1:53:43] and the Lord says fear not
[1:53:45] my spirit remaineth with you it's my
[1:53:49] decree it's my edict it's my message I
[1:53:53] said I would have a church without
[1:53:55] spotter angle the glory of this church
[1:53:59] the glory of this people will be greater
[1:54:02] than that of the former because of the
[1:54:05] coming of the Lord and this people's
[1:54:08] life
[1:54:10] the glory of the Lord will be greater in
[1:54:12] this people because your crowning Glory
[1:54:15] will be a body change it'll be a Rapture
[1:54:18] that's Crown in glory the reason we've
[1:54:20] returned the reason they went back the
[1:54:22] reason they had to be in Jerusalem is
[1:54:25] that's where the Messiah was coming the
[1:54:28] reason we go back the reason we couldn't
[1:54:30] stay in Babylon is this is where the
[1:54:33] Messiah is coming he's coming back to
[1:54:35] the original this is where we have to be
[1:54:38] we have to go all the way back because
[1:54:41] that's where he's promised to return to
[1:54:44] that's what was driving them that's why
[1:54:47] they had to go back that's why you're
[1:54:49] here tonight the messiah's come in the
[1:54:52] messiah's come in prepare build up
[1:54:55] restore get back to the faith of the
[1:54:58] fathers the Messiahs come in and the
[1:55:01] glory of this people will be greater
[1:55:03] than that of every other age because you
[1:55:05] will be crowned with the very presence
[1:55:07] of the return of King Jesus in this day
