where we can see the hope of our calling lord where we can take our position of sonship and claim from god our divine inheritance we ask in the name of jesus that you'll bless us together again in your presence now in jesus name amen amen god bless you amen and it could be in the house of the lord today it really is amen i need the trustees to come back um real quick this is the um first sunday of the month and i told you that we would be taking up another offering for those that would like uh who are going on their trip to um to be in the special youth meetings so we're paying for a bus uh to to uh for the young people to be able to go and so i think we're we're about two or three thousand dollars short on that so you know i know the lord will provide for it so as they're ready to come for the offer and let's sing this song it's jesus on the inside now don't worry about it we get a little left over and we got a little extra i'm not going to put it in my pocket no but we'll put it toward the expenses for the young people so god bless you now amen well it's jesus on the inside working on the outside of what it changes in my life it's jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life it's jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life on the inside working on the outside of what it changes in my life it's jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life it's jesus on the inside working on the outside of what it changes in my life [Applause] amen let's get the lord the hand of praise amen god bless you hallelujah amen what a blessing it is to be together today i'm going to let you have your seats just for a moment i want to speak to you and then we'll read the word of god so um you know we got a lot of things today to that's on our hearts and um uh you know i just wanted to just uh mention again what we heard thank you um the other night where brother timothy was sharing about his meeting that he had over at brother ron spencer's and how the phenomena was done and um you know brother michael dexter was also there and they'd asked him to come and sing a song and he was talking about the great physician now is near the sympathizing jesus and how when a little baby was a young boy that was all twisted up was help being held in brother branham's arms as a little dunkard or mennonite girl some type of i'm not really sure what what they were from he says different ones but anyway you know she she was there playing the piano and uh the the great physician now is near the sympathizing jesus and brother michael was telling about this and and and preface before he sang and he really just caught his musicians off guard because they thought he was going to sing that and instead he's saying when jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when jesus comes amen our fears are wiped away he takes the gloom and he fills the heart with gladness and all is changed when jesus comes to stay amen and so that was kind of the preference to that and then brother timothy preached on the god that answers and he and he stepped out on a little platform it's kind of out front maybe about three or four five feet out you can walk out on it just a couple of steps down it would be like a circle like this in front of brother ron's pulpit there but just a little lower platform where they can walk out and he stepped out and was was preaching there and leaving his ipad with his notes on the pulpit and he doesn't wear i watch you know so uh that couldn't been it but as he said as he was preaching he has come down you know like the for the three hebrew children and stepped into the fire and he's he has come down for us and and he talked about you know how that you know in that moment he just called for the east winds the north winds south and and and there was there in a moment said this is a job for me and at that moment his ipad began to switch off from his notes and and change over select a sermon of brother branham's and begin to play and brother brandon's voice begin to say you know my favorite hymn is down from his glory because he's come down to show he's not just a prophet or a junior god but he's the almighty god but he has come down among us and um so you know it just went together when jesus comes the tempter power is broken and and then he has come down brother ron sitting on the platform he said he watched the whole thing it was just like you know someone was pushing buttons on there and making it happen and you know and so it was prefaced actually by brother michael mentioning the angel of god continuing to play the piano when that little baby dropped out of brother branham's arms and uh began to run across the platform and that little sister seeing that jumped up and began to worship god and and speaking in another language and and and their uh dancing and and rejoicing over this great victory and the piano never missed a beat continued right on and so you know we we saw the phenomena being done that god is among us amen and so i just wanted to to remind you that because we still need a miracle for sister karen they uh had been planning to move her to a rehab on tuesday but we're still facing obstacles today we we needed a new um cat scan done and um so they're checking some some issues that have come up and so we really need your prayers about that as as we stand here today but um you know where as as i went in last night to see her i i reminded myself we walk by faith and not by sight so i'm not looking at what i see i'm looking at what he says and so you know it we demonstrated sunday with brother timothy hall you know about as he had a yellow shirt on and i called it black and when i asked brother l there you know well you know brother l what what color is that shirt and he said well i'll just go with you what you say and uh you know he did this because he has confidence and he believes in my knowledge my position the authority that i carry as a pastor and if i said that shirt was black when it was yellow and he could see it was obviously yellow he was going to say whatever i said you know but in doing so he would have to deny what his sense of faith said all right now this is a way we often do our faith says the word of god is true our faith says we are healed by his stripes our faith makes a claim on the promise but then a person with knowledge or position or authority tells us something different from what our faith says and then we just surrender up our faith to the knowledge of man and deny what this sense of faith says now faith is looking at something different than what is obvious to the eye faith is looking into the unseen and to a divine promise and what jesus did at calvary and uh i just want to say we have been buffeted by messenger from satan and it's been blow after blow after blow now and that god has brought us through each time and he'll bring us through again i wear on my right hand right here on my middle finger you know um because it fits that finger that's reason i wear it there i have my wedding band over here and an anniversary ring my wife gave me when this one wore thin and broke and she bought me another one and it didn't fit so i put it on this put it there on my hand wore that for a while it wasn't comfortable so i put it away and and um you know um just uh for a long time i had you know just i actually took this this my original band and had them a jeweler fix it and put it back on and it just sat in the drawer for a long long time when we went to the meetings many of you know for the last i'm going to say eight years we have dealt with menopause and and the hormonal changes and uh a lot of a lot of different things that has been really really trying and very difficult and then the major brain believed that happened in 2015 and then we had uh last year we we had an another brain bleed and uh actually two and one was very major where it required surgery so we have been buffeted by you know over and again but anyway when i went to germany after the first brain bleed and i was preaching over there and uh you know sister karen was very very upset because of um and nervous because there was some confrontations that was going on in the meetings and uh where i was dealing with some of the brothers about some of the issues uh that their false doctrine has caused and there had been some altercations that was being said in the and the pulpit there by some others and so i was meeting that head on i was out to two o'clock in the morning and my wife was really upset about it and she had been going through even though she'd been healed of the brain bleed and had recovered from that and she was just still going through these really mood swings of this uh hormone situation and we had to take her to a doctor and finally you know give her some hormonal treatments that was a natural thing of a naturopath anyway but we we had all that going on and and it was better but it wasn't it wasn't fixed and we were really dealing with it over and again and i found her at two o'clock in the morning and walking up and down in our room and just crying and fretting and saying you know i was worried about you and you know i know i know i've heard stories and things that have happened and and and i said why you know i can hold my own i said i i've never had problems holding my own so you know so i they didn't have to you didn't have to worry about them you need to be worried about them you know didn't have to be worried about me be worried about them i said but you know let's just go to bed and let's go and you know we was really dealing with that and and brother ron didn't come to the meeting till late his father-in-law was in a very difficult condition he would later die um some months later but he kind of had to be delayed coming to the meeting and he spoke and so we didn't have a real time to speak together a lot and he knew nothing about what had happened during the night and as he was preaching he said you know god is going to he told about sister karen's healing of the brain bleed and he said god's going to finish what he started and he walks down and he pulls her out of the audience and he said god saw you in the night ringing your hands and threatening crying and walking up and down the room god saw you but he's going to heal you we never had to take another treatment we never had another mood swing every situation was vanished was gone in an instant well i walked home i come home rather we flew home and i walked into my house and as i went in i happened to pass by and was looking for something and saw my ring laying there and i looked at that ring and i tried it on this finger it didn't fit and i tried it on that one and it fit and i said well this was before menopause and this is after menopause and i've been wearing it as a token of my of her healing and her deliverance well just a few days ago last week or so a messenger of satan emailed me accused me of being a witch because i wore it on a finger and you know and said i you know next thing i'd be wearing earrings even though i've never been effeminate my goodness you know um and um and then you know blasted me like that and so i said well maybe i'm stumbling people and i put it back in the drawer and you know this has happened and today i put it back on and i said i'll wear my testimony i don't care what they say but after he compared me with you know like smoking cigarettes or you know being like a witch or whatever else i said well i'll put it away for a while but you promise me you'll get rid of your broom and your cat now we have been buffeted by me and by messenger of satan don't think this is on this is something unusual don't think so jesus was a man of sorrow acquainted with grief amen so he he was he he knew what it was to have a lot of trouble that come his way the bible said we even hid our faces from him when he needed a friend he didn't have one but thank god i i've got so many friends out here amen and god bless you i you know brother sister stanky brought me a big uh bunch of blueberries far in your your little red containers right out here by the door and don't forget it today and many of you have brought food and helped us and brother wendell was here and my goodness we never ate so good in our lives and so you know we we just had a you know great time with them they came and really was a blessing was a messenger from god so you know but god has brought us through each time and he'll bring us through again now i'll just say this if this is the the time of the end of her journey upon earth she cannot die she can only change dimensions i watched her die you know some 45 years ago at an altar and raised up again to be known as a child of the most high god and today she lies in the hospital where in the natural eye it looks very dark she has a breed on the bleed on the right side of her brain it affects her cognitive skills it may be affecting her limbs on the left side but today we turn our eyes from from all of that we look back to calvary where he was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquity now on on friday brother timothy and i visit her her in the icu and she had not spoken then for 18 hours would not eat or drink or take oral medication and i was very concerned and so we went up and prayed for her and as i went to her bedside she you know called my name and told me she loved me and then after prayer brother timothy began to speak to her and said mom god has come down and as that moment without prompting she began to sing softly down from his glory my god and my savior came and jesus was his name twice we've heard that saying today and she began to weep as she began to sing oh how i love him how i adore him my breath my sunshine so today we look away from these troubles and we look away to jesus you know brother branham preached on job so much that when he was going through the trial and i guess losing his wife and daughter and all the other thing preached on job so much that somebody asked him one time said when you're going to get job off the ash heap and if this seems redundant well i just want to say i'm in battle but i'm going to tell you where i'm fighting from so i want you to turn with me to revelation 12 verse 7 we'll stand in honor to the word and we'll look now to the promise of god revelation 12 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not and neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now he has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimonies and they love not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice you heavens and ye that dwell in them and woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time when we remind the devil he only has a short time amen there is a limit to him but there's not a limit on us god bless you can be seated i'm going to be speaking on today fighting while seated or yet seated fighting yet seated now when man sinned and fell from his rightful position as ruler of the earth he lost his throne and his dominion and satan took that dominion becoming the prince of the power of the air or atmospheres heaven became obscured by his darkness satan became the ruler as the prince of this world and took lordship over man and every man that is born of sexual birth would be born dead and dead to god that is but alive to sin and the new birth of course is the reversal of that it makes us dead to sin and alive to god and gives christ the lordship over our lives where satan is no longer ruler now satan is called in scriptures like ii corinthians 4 4 the god of this evil age in john 14 30 he speaks of satan as the prince of this world and then he declares that he has no claim or no part in me now so through the fall this earth was given to the devil in luke chapter 4 verse 6 um that he said satan said to him to you i will give all this authority and their and their glory and it's been delivered to me and i will give it to whomsoever i will so you can see that satan knows that um it has been delivered to him all this power over all the earth he showed him all the kingdoms of the world it says luke 4 4 and matthew 4 4 you'll find where jesus is opposed by satan and and then this moment of time the devil said this power is mine this authority was given to me and he said i'll give it to you if you'll just bow down and worship me and and so he he is a prince and although he's an evil prince but i declare he is not the king amen and he's certainly not my king for there is but one king and that is jesus christ the bible says in first timothy 6 15 he is the blessed and only potentate or sovereign the king of kings and lord of lords now every kingdom of this world of course is governed by the devil the earth uh this earth belongs to the devil now not legally but as a squatter he claims what adam surrendered to him now god didn't give him the earth god didn't give him the power of the earth man did that by his fault he surrendered himself to come under the rulership gave satan lordship over his life so he surrendered to him and adam surrendered it to him and he retains now the control over the earth even somewhat our bodies because our bodies are of this earth uh it retains it by contesting our rights to possession by his accusation of our sins he is called the accuser of the brethren now this is a reason we have wars and shootings and fightings and trouble is because the kingdoms of this world is the kingdoms of the devil that won't always be that way because in the millennium there's a scripture that's prophesized of it rejoice all your heavens and you holy prophets of the earth for the kingdoms of this earth have become the kingdoms of our lord and he shall rule forever and ever so you see it is promised then that where we will have no more war when jesus comes there'll be no more sickness there's no trouble but right now we are incorruptible bodies so we are septic to all kinds of things remember jesus was acquainted with grief amen he knew what it was to suffer pain sorrow sickness everything that we go through amen it all happens to him when he was mortal somebody with me but jesus declared when he is lifted up on the cross that it would initiate the casting down of satan as the prince of this world and it would and at the same time it would exalt exalt of men to the throne of sonship now the end results of what happened at calvary will produce the ultimate victory of what we have read about today where that satan is cast down the accuser of the brethren now as jesus approached the cross he declared victory he looked right in the face of death and he didn't look at as defeat but as he went he looked at it and he said now will the prince of this world be cast out and it and of course it would be done by the re for the redemption of our sins through his death on the cross he said if i be lifted up he said then satan will be cast down now again this was signifying of his death on the cross where he would be lifted up on our behalf now notice as we look at this then we know that as he died on the cross paying redemption sins after he resurrects then his next work is his ascension now this is very important that we get this not only does god come down as a man but this man now must also meet death and defeat it meet hell and defeat it but he also must make a way back into heaven for man again are you with me amen because since the day in the garden of eden that sin was committed all heavens were shut off from mankind satan became the prince of the power of the atmospheres heaven became obscure and clouded over by darkness and that darkness then began to feel the atmosphere between god and man and and we became you know only held by sense-bound knowledge and and and uh that's how that we operate upon the earth and we lost that realm of being able to see clearly through the realm or the the sense of faith now no man could see up into glory no man could understand because it was just the power above us and heaven means the atmosphere was above and these powers were shut off from mankind because of sin and when heaven was shut off the the man man lost his position of authority that when man could no longer stand in god's presence because of his sins and then god came down as a man amen to true man as a man in order to make a way back for man to rule again as sons of god amen now jesus died buried and went to hell for us we have mentioned this before he was our scapegoat a man he was the one upon whom our sins and sickness the results of our sins was laid upon him in first peter 2 24 he says for whom his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed amen so he was sent to hell in our place amen like the young goat kid let out and the sins of the nation play placed upon him and then abandoned in the wilderness left alone to be torn chased by every demon sickness and disease this is jesus as he descends into you know there and he meets meets death at calvary and on down into hell the the scapegoat torn by the beast let me just tell you jesus was our scapegoat every cancer diabetes tuberculosis asthma heart disease high blood pressure brain bleeds strokes affliction amen blind death dumb lyme's disease every beast of every kind bit at him and poured his flesh and he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities so that by these tribes we could be healed and let me tell you what he was healed of all of them that day he rose again without a shred of it he was he was there on that sunday morning after his time at trial was over there he became the mighty conqueror he not only raised his self up but he raised up all the sleeping dead of the old testament saints and they appeared to many he proved he was alive and triumphant over death and he showed the infallible proofs of his resurrection he appeared to his disciples he could show his scars up to to thomas and and and said you know you know put your hand in my side look here at my hands you know i'm not a ghost i can eat fish and honeycomb he can speak 153 fish into existence and plus our bread and fish on the fire waiting by creation are you with me he could break bread with cleopas and his friends that emmaus the same jesus let me tell you the same jesus alive from the dead but now he's got to do something more than that here comes the greatest of all days when he ascends amen when he says as he said i am the way and i go to prepare a place for you and so he said he said see heaven have been blocked off to man by the prince of the power of the air the one who controls atmosphere and jesus must make a way amen for the rest of us to follow remember he was the logos that went out of god in the beginning he came down on the earth not to be made an angel he came down on the earth and took the form of a bondsman a servant not an angel he came down from the great glory the jehovah glory but he come down as a man to redeem man hallelujah that's why you know this is so pertinent down from his glory every living story my god my savior came the great i am became my savior and all god's filling his dwells in him the sin of man came upon him to pay the penalty of sin what did what did he do the bible said he was made a little lower than the angels in order for death that he might abolish him and take away sickness from the world he came from the highest from the logos of god he came down to angels condescending coming down was made a man until he can say i was not even a man i'm a worm and no man because i'm despised and rejected the lowest to the lowest he became the lowest of the lowest so he could come down on your level to cause you to come up to sonship amen to a place of dominion and power and authority are you with me now no never a man died like him never man could die like him never could a man ascend on high like him because he was god he made himself of no reputation you know the man that made the artificial eye made himself a reputation the man who made false teeth made himself a reputation the man who made a wooden arm made a reputation for himself the man who made the original eye are you with me the original arm made his have no repetition but became a servant a bondsman unto men who were sinners that he might win them back oh what matter of love hath the father for adam's fallen race that he would come down and descend and become one of us and to do so now in his ascension he would break through every veil brother branham says in the hebrew series he said the bible said he ascended on high and gave gifts to man there was an atmosphere hung over the earth of darkness of gloom of death and weary and the the that's worry and the the prayers couldn't come up because the atonement wasn't made but he broke through that veil and he opened up the way and he broke the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin he broke the veil of worry he broke the veil of depressed he broke every veil and then he made a highway for the wayfaring man walking up the king's highway hallelujah he did it so we can rise up in the heavenly realms he made us alive in christ so he can raise us up to make us sin with him philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no repetition he condescended in other words took upon him the form of a servant made in the likeness of man and being found as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even to the death of the cross wherefore god had also also hath highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name that at the name of jesus ever needs to bow of heaven of things in heaven of things on earth the things of the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father i say what a promise that is and what a word that is that every devil every cancer every affliction every disease every demon has to bow to the name of jesus amen get ready to get on your knees devil because you'll have to bow to the name of my lord amen he's no little lord he's king of kings and lord of lords you may be prince of this world but you're not king over my lord and neither are you my king or at that name at the mention of that name they bow they fall every demon has to bow to that name ever flicks and every sickness let's go to ephesians 1 20. he speaks of the working of his mighty power which he worked in christ when he raised him from the dead and what seated him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come now let's look at this he said him look when he ascended he ascended to a place far above principalities for above power might dominion every name that is named this is where jesus sits at the as a place of preeminent authority are you with me now now far above everything else any name that is named now we know that spiritual things are just as real as physical things we know that spiritual things are superior to to uh to physical things because god is a spirit and and and as a spirit he created the physical things so the physical things are creation of the spiritual things so it's it's lesser isn't it amen so then the spiritual things are superior to physical we know that are you ready that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world we know that greater is the one that is in us amen is the master this great one in us he is a master of sickness he is the master of diseases he is the master of weaknesses he is the master over sins do your sin be like scarlet can i tell the prodigal this morning thou your sins be like prodigal as the prodigal and like scarlet you shall be made white as snow don't let me read like crimson they'll be made white as wool as far as the east is from the west i'll remove your sins from you why jesus is greater than that sin he's greater you mentioned of name he's read his name is greater oh but you say but that was just for jesus right that dominion you talk about just for dominion well let's look at verse 22 and he put all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him who feels all in all notice this he put all under his feet verse 2 he of chapter 2 verse 1 he says unto you he made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins in which you once walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit which will not works in the sons of disobedience among whom also we once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children are out just as others but god who is rich in mercy because of his great love which he had for us even when we were dead in trespasses have made us alive together with christ for by grace you are saved and has raised us up together and made us sick where in the heavenly places in christ jesus so now he made a way not just for him to be thrown but for us to be enthroned with him are you with me now as believers we are in the same seat of authority that jesus occupies we are with christ we are also in christ and this is a place i want to just declare it it is above every demon every fallen angel every evil spirit even lucifer himself amen just as adam was given dominion over every living creature in eden god has chosen us to give us his beloved children and this new creation how many beliefs are of a new creation amen he has given us a level of authority in the spirit realm let me say it again just as adam had control over nature come on god has given you control in the spirit realm amen and that that authority is above every created being hallelujah now brother madam tells us the greatest authority he said which is the greatest authority an angel from heaven or angel in the pulpit which is it said is the angel or the messenger in the pulpit paul said if an angel from heaven comes preach any other gospel to you than this which i've already preached let him be a curse so the angel anointed with the holy spirit when the word stands next to god into heaven his authority all powers in heaven and earth is given to my hand go and i'll go with you whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven what you loose on earth i'll loosen heaven oh if the great holy church only realizes power to do these things but when there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering well could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright and whenever talk of fear is vanished are you with me and the holy spirit is in complete control in the church then all fears are gone and the church has the power see why they have everything heaven owns behind them they're ambassadors of the throne absolutely an ambassador of christ has the authority and everything that christ owns belongs to that ambassador and he said go into all world and you be a witness after the holy ghost has come on you and what is a witness as an ambassador to come and witness something the whole powers of heaven is right in your hands he said oh why do we sit and the church is barren and we sit dormant because we don't recognize these things hallelujah we are positioned with him as sons of god without blemish with power and authority name the name hallelujah for you has he made alive who were dead in trespasses and sin and he hath raised you up together with him hallelujah and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus he puts you back in a position in heaven as a of sonship with power and authority over every devil now this is why he said in my name you're going to cast out amen you're gonna you're gonna do it because of what my name represents what i did at calvary so you are gonna do what you're gonna cast satan out now paul is showing us in these scriptures that jesus is sitting at the right hand of the father he's far above every evil spirit or demon or fallen angel or any other evil spiritual being that exists and remember we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness and heavenly places right amen but he's showing us we're already above it if we are in a kingdom being seated listen to me being seated at the right hand of the king is the highest position that is available and this is where god has exalted his bride his church his wife too is to a place beside him come on read the lao to see an age and who gets to sit with him on the throne and i don't believe that just over there in the glory land i believe that's right now he has made us kings and priests [Applause] now sure it'll be in the glory land but this even right now surely be in the millennium but we right now have dominion over what over every unclean spirit over every lie of the devil amen and since this kingdom of god is the greatest kingdom how many believes it's the greatest kingdom how many believes it's greater than all kingdoms satan says i'm my kingdom i'll give to you do you believe it's greater than satan's kingdom amen the kingdom of god then is the greatest kingdom and since there is no authority in existence that is higher than god then we know that being seated at his right hand is to be in a place of unmatched authority amen his place of authority is shown as a man at the father's right hand jesus has absolute unconditional authority over all demons hallelujah over all the sickness all the problems that they can create christ sitting at the right hand of the father now how would you get this is a picture of rest now how different this is in the old testament you know jesus is the priest of the new testament he's the high priest and he does it from a sitting down position of a seat a throne but on the old covenant the priests were constantly working to cover sins trying to make things happen laboring bringing sacrifice after sacrifice and hew in the woods and bring the water and all the other things necessary for the sacrifice in the old testament the priests had to go in the temple you know and make these sacrifices because that's the way they receive forgiveness and it was all based off of works amen think of the tabernacle there's no chairs in the tabernacle there's no reason for seats the priests couldn't sit down no their work was never done they offered sacrifices for sins continually they lived under constant pressure for their work was never done oh we need some more wood now bring in some more water and here's another lamb and here's a man and you know they had to do this continually over and over and over and over again works works works works amen every day another sacrifice and then another sacrifice is required but when jesus offered himself as the lamb of god on the cross he said it is finished and he abolished the old way of having to constantly work for god's goodness he sat down on the right hand of the father him sitting there is a picture of rest under the old covenant they're still working working working under the new covenant jesus is sitting and resting i'm preaching i'm preaching on give my title again they never lost it i'm preaching on fighting yet seated about this in mind jesus is sitting contrary to the old testament work work work he is sitting and resting now paul said we are seated in heavenly places that means we got a place of rest too amen you don't have to go through life all worried upset tore up on the inside when you live seated i might know you're resting you don't have to go through life frustrated because you know you're trying to dot every eye right and cross every t no no you're you're sitting you're sitting in heavenly places you may have problems maybe you're struggling with illness perhaps you know the medical reports don't look good and you can stay worried but just instead you stay seated i hope you're getting the picture you can go around worried and upset but instead you know god's got you in the palm of his hands you know the number of your days he will fulfill that there's nothing that devil can do to take you away until god decrees your time is up on the earth amen amen david said although i'm surrounded by trouble my heart will know no fear because the lord will bring me safely through the the psalmist said it's a rapture scripture it's those who are going to rapture this is their scripture psalms 2701 the lord is my light and he is my salvation brother jim you said well it's a time of you know it's been things are kind of dark the lord is my light though and he is my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell i didn't fall they fell amen though an army a host should encounter against me my heart will not fear a mental war should rise against me if this will i be confident one thing i desired from the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord in his presence all the days of my life and behold the beauty of the lord and inquiring his temple for in the time of trouble he will hide me in this pavilion amen and he shall set me up on a rock how many times did god's prophet tell us let off the pressure i think we need to just take a deep breath right now just i'm safe i'm sheltered i'm in this pavilion i can rest i can sit here perhaps i have a right to be worried and upset but i've come to realize that's why i'm in the pulpit this morning but i've come to realize the battle isn't mine amen the battle is the lord's so i'm going to rule from a position right beside him can i tell you where i'm at i'm resting and knowing he's in control he's got this but you see when you take over letting your worries dictate your feelings you are no longer allowing god to work anymore i want to remind you this battle is not yours it's the lords now yes timothy said in first timothy 6 12 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life but brother tim you've got to fight you've been preaching you've got to fight but do it from a position of rest sitting down with him and then don't let no nothing move you from that position now when you stand up you see you're trying trying to take over god just steps back as long as you fight he's gonna rest but when you step back and sit down you see what's happening in the heavens michael and his angels go to fighting for you but when you get in there and try to take over the battle and frustrated and worried and trying to fix everything god can't work but when you sit there on your throne and let the angels the servants that you command come on now that you command they're at your command amen jesus said i could call allegiance or legions of angels 12 legions of angels what is that about 182 000 angels when one angel could kill 200 000 with one blow come on now did it in the days of hezekiah right everybody but don't let nothing move you from your position as long as you're fighting god god just stand back but when you step back and you sit down and you sat down on your throne angels go to working for you amen when you rest god works that's why he told the israelites be still and you'll see the deliverance of the lord remember that exodus 14 the lord shall fight for you and you will hold your peace amen now there's your bible that's holding your peace come on now amen because that's where the devil wants to trick you into trying to take it over and trying to make things happen and try to making this work and you get frustrated and worried and oh you're impatient and you you know sit this back rest god's got this he's able he's able to do exceeding abundantly above what you're able to think and you're trying to figure it out and he's got it figured out don't don't get don't get in the way the lord will fight for you you'll hold your peace i've got this i'm bigger than this this battle is mine hallelujah isn't it wonderful no he's bigger than any problem you got he bigger than your cancer he's bigger than your afflictions he's bigger than a brain belief he's bigger than confusion dementia whatever it might be you name a name he's bigger than that and then god said this battle is mine now that don't mean we don't do anything that we just set back we're passive all the time we should go to work we have to pray we have to believe but we do it from a place of rest you see not agitated not impatient not upset not you know i ca you know sometimes catch myself wanting to cry and i was like no you're not crying because that week is faith amen you're going to stand right there you work hard you can work hard with the rest on the inside knowing you're doing your best and god will get you to where you're supposed to be not working frustrated and agitated and struggling and wondering why haven't i been healed and you know how come i'm not blessed you know i see someone so blessed and why ain't i blessed and how come we've waited so long no you work from a place of rest knowing that god's favor is on your life his goodness and mercy is really chasing you down i love that many years ago when i read that where he leads us besides still waters and he restores our soul and you know it's speaking of rest and look at even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i fear no evil thou art with me i'm covered by thy rod in my staff and it meant surely goodness and mercy shall follow me that means to chase after to overtake me all the days of my life hallelujah i mean you know you can sit back resting this morning you got kids that are rest goodness and mercy's on their trail like this little prodigal girl calling me or writing me and saying you know brother tim i've been listening to your services and i begin to begin to get a desire again for god i'll just tell you a little sister lisa hang on to that promise amen goodness and mercy is on your trail it'll overtake you it's gonna get you it'll bring you like a sheep back to the god's a shepherd i'll not lose one of them [Applause] you know sometimes we don't sleep good everybody says well you need your rest you need your rest you need your rest inner rest inner rest is even more important than outer rest if your mind never rests if you're constantly worried and burdened it's going to wear you out you can't always be in fight mode it'll drain your joy it'll drain your energy it'll just whip you it's awful to say but i know some christians who live defeated lives it's awful always gloomy you almost hate to talk to them sometimes they're always negative moaning crying upset i'm trying brother tim i but he's just not working out you know let me just say i want you to understand you have been born in the new covenant don't try living under the old covenant of works you know you're thinking if i can work harder if i can just try a little harder if i can just change the situation you know i want to say your heart is right your approach is wrong you know why not just approach it from a place of rest just say lord i can't change this on my own you're the potter i'm the clay amen in your time you'll resolve this situation in my life i don't know how and but but instead of doing doing doing come to the place where you say it's done it's done it's done it's finished it's finished hallelujah look at your battle and say it's finished why because we can read the book and he prevailed now we got to finish that word [Applause] hallelujah look to the venice how well i lost this war and you know i lost this about you're not losing the war get back amen get into a place of rest be confident knowing that no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly god has already defeated every enemy every sickness i want to say again he's defeated every enemy every sickness he has planned your days amen i want you just to realize you just need to sit down with him live from a place of peace and rest you wasn't created to carry heavy burdens weighted down with worry and stress you know how many people were in brother branham's prayer lines you cross bridges before you come to them and you're you know this is this nervousness has caused this sickness and it's caused the peptic ulcer and then this and this worry is brought up on this and that and you see this is why many have health problems of high blood pressure and stomach problems they haven't learned to rest they're always fighting on the inside worried about your children well the bible said come on just take a promise take what the bible said you shall be there and your offspring's with you amen come on now take another promise believe on the lord jesus christ and thy and thy house shall be saved i mean i don't know how i don't see i don't see any results brother tell me just rest it's good trying to figure out how it's going to happen amen god's got this now brother bradham said that told the story he said you know we get up grouchy and fussy and you know my problems is i'm just half asleep well you must have been half asleep when you went to bed because he was grouchy and fussy then no wonder we got high blood pressure and diabetes and everything else he says look at a little robin he'll raise of a morning the first thing he throws his little face toward heaven goes to singing at the top of his voice you'll never seen any of them with high blood pressure walking on crutches and with diabetes i said a little robin sometime one time said wonder what's the matter these people these creatures that calls themselves human beings why they they're so sad maybe they hadn't got a heavenly father like we have that takes care of us now the scripture says be still and know that i'm god this lets us know if we're not still you really don't won't know he's god you see it's easy to let your mind wonder about what if don't think i don't think satan hadn't whispered in my ear what if you know wha what if what if my wife don't get well what what if we faced with things worse than that what if my health don't return you know what if the report isn't good oh what if my finances goes bad and what if just remember when you're working god can't work if you'll just take your position be seated with him he'll start working you know he's already got the solution brother wendell martin preached in the scripture that i just read of david in my own private devotions at zig lag and i believe it was god just confirming to me you know how david encouraged himself in the lord and the lord is god and he said you know and he asked of the lord what shall i do and he said pursue and you will recover all and david recovered his wife he recovered everything he lost he recovered the spoils beside enough to share with those who grew faith and were unable to fight and it dropped out along the journey he had enough broth back to share with everybody and i believe that we can have miracles that can happen come on what god restores all and even those who are faint and didn't have enough faith for a miracle and churches who didn't have enough faith for miracles can take heart and believe we'll get enough to share with the whole bride hallelujah we've shared about atlanta we've shared about such a caring we've shared about baby drew we've shared about brother we said about all these promises because god has given us abundance and we're going to recover all [Music] we're trying to figure everything out some solutions have no logical solution you have to turn your mind off you don't lean to your own understanding you trust in the lord you know it's okay to say god i don't see how this will work out i don't see i don't see a way but don't stop right there you know follow up with it but i know you have a way you knew the solution before i had the problem so i'm not going to worry i'm just going to live from a place of david said in psalms 110 in verse 1 the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand till i make your enemies your footstool a footstool is again something you put your feet on it's another picture of rest so come you know when you meet challenges you've got to come to a place of peace you know you have to do this by faith because the voice of the enemy will say nothing's going to work out you're not going to get well this is going to be worse than ever your child will never come right your marriage it'll never be fixed your family will never be restored there's just too much strife tell that to that couple right there they know better than that amen i believe god's going to give them even not just a restored marriage but abundance plus [Music] hallelujah i'll tell you i'd hold my hands out my heart out for a blessing today amen the enemy is going to do everything he can though to get you up amen to get you to leave your seed of dominion he knows when you're seated and you're in peace and you're trusting god he don't stand a chance but when you're because when you live from a place of rest the forces of darkness can't stop you hallelujah remember this god has the final say and just like joseph said to his brethren what you meant for harm god's turned it for my good that he might exalt me and i'm saying that to satan today what you meant for my harm god's going to turn it for my good that he might exalt the power of god that is manifest in this bride but we don't fight our battles with human strength remember it's not a flesh and blood affair we're not fighting against you know against um flesh and blood but we're fighting against principalities and powers and rulers of darkness and heavenly places because you can't win the battle with your own human strength satan will defeat you it's not a flesh and blood battle like i said you do it from a place of rest and when you do it from a place of rest simply taking dominion over satan by trusting in god's ability that's when you truly overcome now i want you to look at hebrews 4 and verse 9 there remaineth there for a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor when a few times god tells us to work let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief so labor you know labor to rest sounds like a contradiction but it isn't god knew it was going to take work for you to stay in this seat of dominion and power you know and like i said it's easy it's easy to live worried and discouraged by problems and make it a flesh and blood affair trying to figure out how you're going to whip this how what am i going to do now i you know i'm going to try this now and my human ability my human efforts and satan does everything he can to bring you down from that heavenly position where you're seated with christ you know why because he can whip you when you fight as a flesh and blood affair you're not able to whip the devil with human strength it's going to be a battle for you to stay in your seat to stay in your position it's going to take effort you're going to have to work to stay in your place of authority amen you know not work to go straighten that kid out not work to try to devise some scheme or get rich scheme to get out of debt you know but work by staying in your seat by him in a position of power and authority lord i'm trusting in you i mean lead me guide me show me so we'll enter into his rest just like we fight the good fight of faith we take every thought cut them and make it obedient to jesus christ we cast down every imagination because you're going to have them when you're in battle you're going to have them he's the prince of atmospheres and he's going to make the atmospheres dark he's going to make it look impossible but when you allow your self to rest just quit worrying about how it's going to happen this allows you to be open where god can direct you but you can hear his voice because your own thoughts and a lot of it's not crowding out the voice of god a good example is this when jesus spoke to the victory he cursed it he walked on he didn't worry about whether he was going to drop and die he knew what he said would come to pass is that right he gave it no more thoughts amen he let the word somebody help me he let the word do its work [Applause] he just spoke from his seed of authority and let the word work and he says i'm not spoken of myself the father sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak is that right that's the way sons of god live the words that i speak to you are not of myself but the father dwelleth in me and he did the work the same father that dwelt in jesus dwells in you somebody helped me preach amen so you know that's what we got to do we got to walk in the god kind of faith we've got to stand where there's no doubt no fear no worry just rest [Music] amen now again you have a choice i have a choice i have a choice to disbelieve or believe and i choose to believe i can i have a choose to doubt and fear and worry or i have a jew i have a choice to rest in god's promise amen faith is a choice and i choose to believe now you have to be determined you have to be disciplined but if there's a war going on the inside and you're worried and frustrated and upset within yourself impatient that the promise is carried remember sight and time are god's worst enemies when it comes to healing when you're trying to force things to happen in your own strength rather than letting the father within you do the work you're just not tapping into the grace of god that's available you're like the priest had to do sacrifices over and over again but you're under a new covenant you're to live under new covenant christ has already defeated every enemy amen the price has already been paid you're not working to get victory you are working from victory when you know you've already won there's a rest you see you don't live worried you don't lose sleep at night you were watering on your pillow trying to figure it out and like i said i refuse to weep even though sometimes i want to weep but we we weeping will weaken faith and rather than cry let's speak lord amen i choose rather than cry to speak and let's speak deliverance let's speak healing let's speak miracles let's speak restoration let's be victory let's speak joy let's be peace hallelujah let's speak the power of god under deliverance already know the outcome god said no weapon formed against me can prosper amen he will always cause me to triumph i know he said the thoughts i have of you they are peace and not of evil to bring you a hope and a future hallelujah when the doctors give no hope i have a hope when the doctors get no future i've got a future hallelujah now it may not turn out every time the way you wanted it or when you wanted it but god's ways are always better than our ways and that's what trust is all about when you live from a place of peace you'll not only enjoy life's blessings more but god will make happen what you couldn't make happen i want to read you a quote from brother branham and he said i preached a sermon to my wife till about 12 1 o'clock just telling her how glorious jesus was a text had come to my mind to my heart he just kept burning on me till i couldn't rest with and i said honey i want to just preach to you a while and she roused up and by grace she listened amen i know what that is my wife many times got a mini a preview of what i was going to preach but i he said i said the christian faith is based solidly upon rest a christian is not tossed about a christian is and doesn't run from place to place a christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about that a christian rest it's all over it's all finished for the believer calvary amen that's right oh sickness comes and disappointment but the christians at rest knowing this that god's able to keep that which he has promised knowing that that no matter what the thing is or how it looks there's neither sickness sorry death there's neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of god we're at rest just let the old ship toss any way she wants to the anger holds [Applause] hallelujah amen now brother robin spencer about four weeks ago he was warned by a voice from god and saying a storm is coming and he told me brother tim the storm is coming i said awesome bring it on because i know i didn't leave on this journey without jesus in my boat [Applause] amen and it will only be an opportunity to see the jesus that's in me rise up to the occasion and rebuke devils in the storm and after i come to land there's a legion of devils to cast out into the pigs and there will be deliverance of god's children hallelujah hallelujah bring on the storm jesus is in my boat [Music] [Applause] amen bring on the storm the evening like tabernacle jesus is in this boat and we await jesus that's been asleep within us while we were telling testimonies and pressing doctrines and arguing this and that let jesus go to sleep and he'll rise in the power of his majesty and say to the storm peace be still [Applause] [Music] that's what i'm expecting amen now if some of you went off without jesus in your boat and you're in the storm it's the perfect opportunity for jesus to come up in this dorm and get in your boat [Applause] in the time of storms glorious things happen it's an opportunity to see the miraculous and see jesus walking on the water walking on your storms coming right to you to get in your boat and when he enters your boats the winds and away seas and that when you see him walking on the water it provokes faith to rise within his believing children to also walk on water hallelujah amen there it struck it'll strike out here again and again you're going to see the glory of god hallelujah the interval brother brandon said now i find what's in my most christian life most i hate to say that but it's true the most people that profess christianity they seem to have a hard time struggling to hold on i believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching of the bible this is why i'm teaching on this there's no such thing as holding on he done the whole on the whole christian principle is built upon rest come unto me all that you that labor and heavy laden i will give you rest don't have to worry and struggle you're just resting that's all given rest you enter you enter peace that's the whole thing's finished then he's called he's justified those he justified he's glorified amen and the inspiration brother branham tells again about talking to his wife he said the whole christian principle based upon rest i was burning my heart about resting i said why are we trouble let not your hearts be troubled he said we are just resting come come to me and you shall find rest take my yoke upon you learn to me find and rest i said when you come to christ once believe him once accept him enter into the rest and then all things of the world will just seem to die away you've got to rest then rest your soul and you enter in that state and there you are you're resting in with christ he again brings us out and just bring it because there's some nuggets and all of the christian experiences based solemnly and wholly upon rest come unto me all you that labor heavy laden i'll give you rest we're tossed about with everything until you come to christ then it's all finished resting in christ perfectly no matter what comes or goes nothing can touch us without it comes over the shepherd he has to permit it and he said all things work together for the good of them that love god and he has to come over the shepherd first said i'm the door no man can come in without me accepting it let me tell you when god permits anything it's working out to your good so would sickness be the same thing certainly that god might heal you to show a great testimony and give you a little something to move on for all things work together for good notice how beautiful this shepherd laid himself at the door to be the go-between or the block i thought then in my text of job when job tested and tried how that he knew he was righteous because he had offered the sacrifice the burnt offering stood firm he stood firm of it no matter how much his church members said job you're wrong your secret sinner job knew he had confessed his sins and had offered god the appropriate offer the one that god had required the burnt sacrifice he knew he was righteous in god's sight oh if christians who now will fall away and run back or run out or run in and run out and then you think well i can't make it you could make it in the first place it ain't your place to make it god's already made it for you in christ the price is fully paid the only thing you have to do is accept god's provided way and stand on it now no matter what takes place don't move rest the shepherd's watching over his sheep he knows the sparrow how much does he know about you remember the story of paul rayder where brother branham would try to give that illustration so many times of where that his boss told him as he was actually dying with with black water fever and had a hot fever and delirium and whatever and he dreamed that he was out trying to you know as a woodsman trying to cut down a big log he said you know i would cut it down and i limbed it and i got its size and everything and i tried to pick it up and carry it to camp where it was to go and it was just too big it was too big i couldn't pick it up i couldn't budget and i was struggling and i was struggling and trying and i would lift and try and roll it and this i couldn't do it and he said then i then i heard a voice say paul what are you doing and he said i saw it was the lord and he said he and he said i i'm trying to get this log down to camp and i can't do it and he said well paul you're trying on your own i want you to just roll that thing over into the water there into the string and then what you do is get on that log and write it to the count and paul reader got on that log he said in that in that dream and he said he went riding down that river screaming i'm riding on it i'm riding on it i'm riding on it until he came to the camp we're struggling we're trying to move something we're trying to make this happen we're trying to make this work we're struggling with it ourselves and god said roll it over into the river of the holy ghost get on it and ride on it ride on it rest don't work at it no more rest [Music] he said i'll never leave you or forsake you i'll be with you in there to the end of the world jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah why don't we ride on that promise knowing where we stand in this day and hour hallelujah we're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus put your foot up hey man put your foot on a foot stool until he makes every enemy your footstool come on look over here the heavens is working on your behalf michael and his angels fell amen hallelujah daniel was there praying for revelation and michael and gabriel fight against the prince of persia and brought to them the revelation you're struggling you're weary you're you're trying you're working hard start resting put your mind your agrees quit trying to figure it out quit leaning to your own understanding it ain't even a logical answer atlanta yours your healing was not a logical healing was not a logical answer hey man even when she was told i found nothing it took a moment to digest it all it wasn't logical come on it defied logic there one moment gone the next it was medicine doctor said medicine would have killed you madison wasn't going to heal her it was going to kill her amen he knew it maybe extend her life a little longer maybe just a little bit but she would die from the medicine before she would to cancer god have mercy defied logic it defied logic to get up out of their seat and rejoice running around this building shouting it divided logic for me to declare her enemy was dead amen in the bible object for me at the same time to lay my hands and pray here at this pulpit over a prayer cloth and send it over to south africa to a little brother there whose wife was in the third stages of rectal cancer and he hadn't had a job in two years and couldn't find work and was in a desperate situation and he gets the prayer cloth his wife is healed and gets a job what is it god restored all it wasn't logical when the doctor said are you with me hey man that that your sister mariah would never grow hair it was a autoimmune disease and she'd never get over it wasn't logical then to believe for healing but we believed despite logic and one logic to bring three pins in her hand and say i'm going to believe the word of promise i want to wear these come on it wasn't logic amen in divine logic but she was looking to the unseen to a promise of god amen and the same god defied everything of logic and put hair back on her head and it's still there to that day it wasn't logic five years ago when my wife lay with the brain bleed and was unable to dress herself and bathe herself at sitting in the bed and couldn't see on her side there peripheral vision was gone it wasn't logic for her to turn up and raise her hand and begin to worship god and at that moment the angel of god come sweeping over her bed and a little baby who never would have walked and couldn't pull up 18 months of years old got up and ran around my house while beason returned to her eyes that divine logic hallelujah but when karen started resting god's standing working when she started praising heaven started moving i'll tell you it's time that we oh don't you come down with me some gloomy spirit don't you have a pity party for me i don't want a pity party i say let's have a party let's rejoice let's shout let's say god is god he's god over every situation he's my god and he deserves my worship hallelujah worship him this morning from the depths of your heart amen you're positioned with the mind tell the devil take his hands off of god's property tell the devil he can have your child he can't have your son your daughter he cannot have your life you are a child of the most high god despite some angels despite the angels michael and his angels fight against lucifer and his angels and lucifer prevailed not and the accuser was cast down he's been whispered and you're here god's about to cast him down cast him down cast out reason cast out imagination cast down in the high thing that exalts itself against the word of god hallelujah hallelujah
