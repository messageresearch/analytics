[56:22] Lord we thank you for grace and love and
[56:25] mercy that is been poured out Upon Our

[56:37] seals and say Thou Art
[56:40] Worthy oh God it's the song of

[57:09] what's right we want to serve you with
[57:11] all our heart we're asking for the
[57:13] anointing of your spirit upon us today
[57:16] that you'll just come in your own
[57:18] special way now as we read the word Lord
[57:21] bless it to our hearts in Jesus name
[57:25] amen
[57:26] amen God bless you it's good to be here
[57:30] today let's turn to Zechariah chap 4 and
[57:33] verse 6 for our scripture reading this
[57:35] morning we look once more into this
[57:38] wonderful scripture that actually
[57:41] prophesies of in time it will say it'll
[57:44] even give the the name for this
[57:47] Tabernacle it'll say it shall be light
[57:50] in the evening time that's where we take
[57:52] our name because of this light that is
[57:55] here and we want to be the Tabernacle of
[57:58] that evening light amen Zechariah 4: 6
[58:03] then he answered and spake unto me
[58:05] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[58:08] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[58:11] power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord
[58:14] of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain
[58:17] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[58:19] plain and he shall bring forth The
[58:21] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[58:24] Grace Grace unto it amen God bless you
[58:28] can be
[58:30] seated amen we going to speak this
[58:34] morning on the
[58:36] headstone of
[58:38] Salvation amen and what a what a
[58:41] wonderful word that God gives us in his
[58:44] scripture as he
[58:45] prophesies of the end time and things
[58:48] that are to be fulfilled in this last
[58:50] day and of course as we have went
[58:53] through this we have seen that the work
[58:56] Redemption is actually completed in a in
[58:59] a three-fold manner and we're just going
[59:01] to go over that briefly again because
[59:03] the headstone must come to each first
[59:07] there has to be a finishing stone that
[59:09] is the Capo of the mysteries of God that
[59:13] restores the church back to what it was
[59:15] before it went down to Babylon and none
[59:18] of this is are new truths nor additions
[59:22] to the Bible it is a restoration of the
[59:25] original word and Gospel of Jesus Christ
[59:28] in so much that it is Jesus coming in
[59:31] the form of his word as the finishing
[59:35] Stone and uh as I just share with you
[59:38] this little quotation here uh from there
[59:41] is only one provided by God for anything
[59:45] um now he also promised it would be a
[59:48] restoring of the faith we read over in
[59:51] Jude that it said in Jude earnestly
[59:54] contend for the faith that was was once
[59:56] delivered to the Saints now we are
[59:59] promised in Malachi 4 by the same system
[1:00:02] and we know the system God uses is a
[1:00:04] prophetic voice amen because he does
[1:00:08] nothing un unless he Reveals His secrets
[1:00:11] to his servants the prophets so we're
[1:00:13] promised in Malachi 4 by the same system
[1:00:16] that he always did that we would be
[1:00:18] restored back to the original Faith oh
[1:00:21] my what back to the original seed back
[1:00:25] to the seed
[1:00:26] like it began on the day of Pentecost
[1:00:29] back to the same Doctrine word by word
[1:00:33] Power by power Spirit by the same thing
[1:00:36] just exactly like it was in the
[1:00:38] beginning through signs and wonders of
[1:00:41] the living presence of Jesus Christ
[1:00:44] after 2,000 years he's still alive and
[1:00:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:00:50] forever and then of course then second
[1:00:53] we want to look at The Headstone of
[1:00:55] salvation is what we're our subject will
[1:00:57] be on today because you are also the
[1:01:02] temple you are the Temple of the Holy
[1:01:06] Ghost and as zerubabel in the days of
[1:01:09] Zachariah was restoring the temple to
[1:01:12] its its proper place and Jerusalem the
[1:01:15] city of God to his proper place well
[1:01:18] then we also know that as a temple of
[1:01:21] the Holy Ghost that those some parts may
[1:01:25] have been restored to Luther and Wesley
[1:01:27] and more power in theza street but there
[1:01:30] comes in our day where the finishing
[1:01:33] stone is brought forth not simply
[1:01:37] something where we're just justified by
[1:01:40] faith or just Sanctified by Grace um not
[1:01:44] not only empowered by the spirit but the
[1:01:47] person of Christ himself so Christ must
[1:01:52] be the headstone of every Temple
[1:01:56] he is the stone that the builders
[1:01:58] disallowed and even today they will not
[1:02:01] recognize him and put him in the proper
[1:02:04] place where the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost is the crowning thing for every
[1:02:10] believer that there is and of course
[1:02:13] then third which we want cover today
[1:02:15] that Redemption is not finished is by
[1:02:18] without bringing forth The Headstone
[1:02:20] Jesus Christ in a literal physical body
[1:02:24] with the meeting in the air that is the
[1:02:26] hope of the ages so when you're you're
[1:02:31] listening to the messages and you hear
[1:02:33] Brother Bron speak about The Headstone
[1:02:36] coming and the head United with the body
[1:02:38] you have to determine what are what is
[1:02:40] he talking about is he talking about the
[1:02:43] the truth restored or is he talking
[1:02:45] about um the the bride of Christ by
[1:02:50] receiving those truths receiving the
[1:02:51] headship of the word or is he talking
[1:02:54] about The Headstone for for the believer
[1:02:56] or is he talking about uh the coming of
[1:02:59] the Lord Jesus because that is something
[1:03:02] that describes all three aspects of
[1:03:05] redemption what God is redeeming in this
[1:03:08] day but today we want to speak on The
[1:03:10] Headstone of Salvation where Christ is
[1:03:13] The Headstone or the finishing Stone to
[1:03:17] our lives for the head of every man the
[1:03:21] Bible says is Christ The Headstone of
[1:03:24] the individual the person of the Holy
[1:03:27] Ghost himself we're not speaking in that
[1:03:30] of of a gift although it is a gift it is
[1:03:34] not um it's not a gift like I would give
[1:03:38] you a gift but it is he is coming
[1:03:41] himself as your gift you'll receive the
[1:03:44] gift of the Holy Ghost not a a gift of
[1:03:48] the spirit such as tongues your
[1:03:49] prophecies or or um interpretation of
[1:03:53] tongues and that kind of gift but no the
[1:03:55] gift of the person himself Jesus Christ
[1:03:59] coming into your life so you see it's
[1:04:01] the person of the Holy Ghost not a gift
[1:04:04] not a dance not a jump not not simply um
[1:04:08] a a forgiveness of sin not cleansing of
[1:04:11] sanctification but the person himself
[1:04:14] being Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:04:18] now listen Church um we it's very clear
[1:04:22] and and I quote this from the messenger
[1:04:24] Satan don't kill care how religious you
[1:04:27] are or how right you are in your
[1:04:31] Doctrine if you miss that life you won't
[1:04:35] come up anyhow no matter how religious
[1:04:39] or how good or how many churches you
[1:04:42] belong to or or will belong to it
[1:04:45] doesn't matter one thing unless you have
[1:04:48] been born again so Satan really doesn't
[1:04:53] care you know about church attendance he
[1:04:56] comes to church
[1:04:57] too he don't really care whether you
[1:05:00] believe in God he believes in God too he
[1:05:03] don't care whether you're religious
[1:05:06] because Satan is religious too he is he
[1:05:09] is uh he worshiped it from the beginning
[1:05:12] he was created for worship and and and
[1:05:15] so you know he don't care how religious
[1:05:18] he don't care about how often you attend
[1:05:20] church or don't attend church you know
[1:05:22] just one thing if you miss that life and
[1:05:26] I just say what a Pity would it be for
[1:05:29] you to go to church all your life and
[1:05:31] miss
[1:05:33] him amen now as I said Satan don't care
[1:05:37] if you attend church yet you should
[1:05:39] attend church amen gee that was Jesus
[1:05:43] custom it was on his custom he went to
[1:05:46] the um to the synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:05:49] day the Bible said as was his custom
[1:05:53] amen the scripture said we should even a
[1:05:56] together even so much the more even as
[1:05:59] we see that day approaching and and that
[1:06:02] means as the time comes near that we we
[1:06:05] shouldn't treat that you know flippantly
[1:06:08] but we should put our heart into it amen
[1:06:12] but Satan don't care if you dress right
[1:06:16] he don't care how you wear your
[1:06:18] hair you know or if you even wear it
[1:06:21] correctly or he don't care how right you
[1:06:24] are in your Doctrine he don't care how
[1:06:27] well whether you how well you can quote
[1:06:29] the message maybe you can quote it like
[1:06:31] a machine gun you know but nothing
[1:06:34] matters unless you have been born again
[1:06:38] and that is that is crowned with de by
[1:06:42] being filled with the spirit unless that
[1:06:45] headstone that finishing stone is upon
[1:06:48] your life you your wall is still broken
[1:06:51] down and he will get in somewhere and
[1:06:55] and when the when The Headstone comes
[1:06:57] you are sealed to the day of redemption
[1:07:01] and Satan is sealed out amen now you
[1:07:06] know in the days of Paul there were men
[1:07:08] who were you know followers of him they
[1:07:11] were at least observers of him attended
[1:07:13] his meetings and admired what he did and
[1:07:17] and and and no doubt would say I believe
[1:07:20] he's a a messenger from God in fact they
[1:07:23] studied him and they believed in him and
[1:07:27] I'm talking about the seven sons of ska
[1:07:30] that they they would recognize him as a
[1:07:33] prophet they might they might have wore
[1:07:35] their Eagle belt buckles they might have
[1:07:37] had the hofman's head of Christ on their
[1:07:39] wall or they were devout listeners of
[1:07:42] his sermons they might have you know
[1:07:45] practice a quiet time and and listen to
[1:07:48] every tape but the headstone was
[1:07:51] missing and the Holy Ghost wasn't there
[1:07:54] and the devil knew
[1:07:58] it but he said Paul I know and Jesus I
[1:08:03] know but I don't recognize you as having
[1:08:07] Authority and power over
[1:08:08] me amen remember this when they when
[1:08:12] they came and tried to cast out this
[1:08:14] devil there and the and the devil rose
[1:08:17] up and just ripped them boys to Pieces
[1:08:20] saying Jesus I know Paul I know but I I
[1:08:25] don't recognize you as having one of
[1:08:27] authority now listen this is this is a
[1:08:30] position of a holy ghost filled
[1:08:33] Christian that Satan knows not to fool
[1:08:37] with you he knows who you are he knows
[1:08:42] you have been born again amen now he may
[1:08:45] come to you like he did with Jesus and
[1:08:48] try whether Temptation and make you
[1:08:50] doubt it but he
[1:08:52] knows he knows he knows because you met
[1:08:56] him in battle and you've defeated him
[1:08:59] time on time and time again because you
[1:09:03] are an
[1:09:05] overcomer now when you have the new
[1:09:07] birth which is the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:09] Ghost the devil has to recognize you as
[1:09:11] a Son of God with authority over him now
[1:09:16] there is a difference between a
[1:09:19] profession of faith and having the
[1:09:22] spirit these men these men had a
[1:09:24] profession of faith in fact they were
[1:09:26] they were so sure they could use this
[1:09:29] name of Jesus just like Paul did and
[1:09:33] they thought the Devils would be subject
[1:09:36] to them but there is a difference
[1:09:38] between a profession of faith and having
[1:09:41] the spirit remember the wise and the
[1:09:44] foolish virgin in Matthew chapter 25 the
[1:09:47] difference between them was the
[1:09:49] oil amen the the they were all
[1:09:53] virgins amen they were all
[1:09:56] pure they the the foolish had vessels
[1:09:59] they had professions of Faith they were
[1:10:02] saying I'm a Christian I'm a believer
[1:10:06] I'm a a believer in in the message they
[1:10:09] were virgins they had even had some in
[1:10:13] the past some experience with God but
[1:10:16] with but without oil their lamps had
[1:10:20] gone
[1:10:21] out amen you you see you see there are
[1:10:24] many that come along and and they the
[1:10:27] fire of God will even come upon them and
[1:10:29] they'll burn for a little bit but
[1:10:32] because the oil is not there there's
[1:10:34] never been a filling of God's spirit
[1:10:38] there's never been where they have him
[1:10:40] in possession they got him they got him
[1:10:43] on the flesh realm and in that flesh
[1:10:45] realm they shouted and they rejoiced and
[1:10:48] they danced the aisles or or they said I
[1:10:51] believe the message oh this is the truth
[1:10:53] and they have a profession Faith but
[1:10:56] without the oil their lamps go
[1:11:01] out amen well you know I can hear some
[1:11:05] say brother Tim I I I really try I try
[1:11:07] to be good now I want you to understand
[1:11:10] you can be a good person and go to
[1:11:14] hell amen you know when when the when
[1:11:18] the when the Rich Young Ruler called
[1:11:21] Jesus good in Mark 10:18 he says Jesus
[1:11:25] Jesus said there is none good but one
[1:11:28] that is
[1:11:29] God so there's only one that is good and
[1:11:33] that's God and if you if there if any if
[1:11:37] there's any real true goodness it has to
[1:11:40] come from God Amen you say well my my
[1:11:43] son's a good boy well so was the Rich
[1:11:45] Young
[1:11:47] Ruler amen he was a good boy the the
[1:11:50] Bible said in Romans chap 3 and verse2
[1:11:52] they're all going out of the way they
[1:11:55] are all together become unprofitable
[1:11:58] there is none that doeth good know not
[1:12:02] one so without Christ no matter what we
[1:12:06] do no matter how we try no matter what
[1:12:10] kind of efforts that we do to be
[1:12:12] religious without Christ we've totally
[1:12:15] lost
[1:12:16] everything amen now you see somehow we
[1:12:20] think we somehow we got it in our minds
[1:12:22] today is it's the prevalent con concept
[1:12:25] that is you know that is ground into
[1:12:28] people especially in the society that we
[1:12:31] live in somehow we think if we love
[1:12:34] Jesus if we love Jesus that earns us a
[1:12:38] place in heaven
[1:12:41] right somehow God will let us go
[1:12:45] on let us go in on the Merit of I love I
[1:12:49] love
[1:12:51] God and there's many many people that do
[1:12:53] that but I I love J
[1:12:56] Jesus I I I I love I I believe I believe
[1:13:00] in him well the devil does too and he
[1:13:03] trembles amen well you know but but I
[1:13:07] love him brother Tim you see you can
[1:13:09] love with your human Spirit there's
[1:13:12] people that loves football there's love
[1:13:14] people that love
[1:13:16] pizza there's a people that loves a
[1:13:19] certain
[1:13:20] politician and people love Jesus the
[1:13:22] same way
[1:13:26] amen oh they admire him they you know
[1:13:29] they admire his character they they
[1:13:31] admire his uh his goodness they admire
[1:13:35] him but they don't know him they've
[1:13:38] never received him you see you can love
[1:13:42] with your human Spirit that's one of the
[1:13:43] inlets you can love and I'm quoting
[1:13:45] brother brandom here you can love and
[1:13:47] even love God and still not be
[1:13:51] right you can love and even love God
[1:13:56] and still not be
[1:13:58] right you see like I said you know what
[1:14:03] we want to know
[1:14:04] is are you
[1:14:07] changed you know does your life obey the
[1:14:11] word now here's the test on whether you
[1:14:14] really love God here is John 14:15 if
[1:14:19] you love me keep my Commandments
[1:14:26] amen amen now anybody can make the
[1:14:28] profession and they do by the
[1:14:31] millions I love
[1:14:34] Jesus but you see here is the test of
[1:14:39] whether you really truly love him do you
[1:14:43] keep his
[1:14:44] word and that's what that's the real
[1:14:47] test for his whether you love him
[1:14:50] because there are things that I I love
[1:14:52] him I I love his character I love what
[1:14:54] his Miracles I love his words and I I I
[1:14:58] committed those to memory but do you
[1:15:01] keep his
[1:15:05] Commandments now that's where love
[1:15:07] really shows his color amen now because
[1:15:12] you you know like I said there are so
[1:15:14] many that think today I can't go to hell
[1:15:16] Jesus loves me too much Jesus loves me
[1:15:21] he loved me first so I can't go to hell
[1:15:24] because because Jesus loves me the Bible
[1:15:29] says that Jesus in Mark 10:21 looked at
[1:15:32] the Rich Young Ruler and said then Jesus
[1:15:36] beholding him loved him that's
[1:15:40] right God so loved the
[1:15:45] world and yet this man would be given
[1:15:49] the test you know are you going to
[1:15:51] follow me well this is what it's going
[1:15:53] to require of you I I see what's in your
[1:15:56] way go take everything that you have and
[1:16:00] sell it and come and follow me give that
[1:16:03] to the poor and come and follow me now
[1:16:05] every person doesn't have to do that but
[1:16:08] Jesus looked at the man and he saw the
[1:16:11] problem in his
[1:16:14] life amen and although this man was a
[1:16:18] good man and said I've kept the the law
[1:16:22] I've done righteous works all of my life
[1:16:25] and he he went away sorrowful rejecting
[1:16:29] Jesus and the love of
[1:16:35] Jesus because he had great
[1:16:40] possessions
[1:16:43] now here's the mountain facing every man
[1:16:47] or woman a mountain that only God can
[1:16:53] move and I'm going to read it to you and
[1:16:56] it's in Matthew
[1:16:58] 5:48 here is the mountain facing every
[1:17:02] human
[1:17:03] being be you therefore
[1:17:10] perfect well I try to be good no no
[1:17:14] no no no no no well I you know I
[1:17:19] I'm be ye therefore perfect even how
[1:17:24] perfect God how perfect Jesus as your
[1:17:28] father which is in heaven is
[1:17:32] perfect now that's a
[1:17:36] mountain I said that's a
[1:17:39] mountain that's a mountain in your way
[1:17:43] because here is the requirement of the
[1:17:45] scripture you're going to have to be as
[1:17:48] perfect as god is perfect
[1:17:56] now again we we're looking back to
[1:17:59] zerubabel here and and here he's got
[1:18:01] this insurmountable mountain of
[1:18:03] restoring the the city and and bringing
[1:18:06] but here again God God gives a
[1:18:09] requirement and there's a mountain in
[1:18:11] your way that says You must be this
[1:18:19] perfect as perfect as your father in
[1:18:22] Heaven amen let me tell you this is a
[1:18:25] God who demands
[1:18:28] Holiness in first Peter 1:15 he said but
[1:18:32] as he which has called you is Holy how
[1:18:35] many believes he's
[1:18:36] holy so be ye holy in all manner of
[1:18:40] conversation in other words all manner
[1:18:42] of
[1:18:44] life because it is written be ye holy
[1:18:48] for I am
[1:18:52] Holy you want to go to heaven I'm how
[1:18:54] many wants to go to heaven am mean you
[1:18:57] want to see Jesus how many wants to see
[1:18:59] Jesus Hebrews 12:14 says without Hol
[1:19:03] without Holiness no one will see the
[1:19:10] Lord so he's demanding Perfection he is
[1:19:14] demanding
[1:19:15] Holiness and I'll just tell you you
[1:19:18] can't climb that
[1:19:20] mountain and I'm going to just tell you
[1:19:22] you can't move that mountain
[1:19:26] amen that's a huge mountain how can you
[1:19:29] be holy how can you meet God's
[1:19:32] requirement of
[1:19:35] perfection because it's an impossible
[1:19:38] Mountain to
[1:19:41] move there's only one that can move that
[1:19:43] mountain and that's
[1:19:45] God and the only way that you can ever
[1:19:48] have that mountain moved and be perfect
[1:19:51] as he's perfect is have the perfect one
[1:19:53] in you the only way you can be holy as
[1:19:56] he is Holy is because that Holiness
[1:19:58] comes in
[1:20:01] you you see as I've said over and again
[1:20:04] only Christ can live the Christian Life
[1:20:08] I can't do it you can't do it no one
[1:20:10] else can do it it's the mountain that
[1:20:12] cannot be moved it takes Jesus in a life
[1:20:17] and without him you can do
[1:20:21] nothing now what is the evidence that
[1:20:24] you're mountain of sin is gone and that
[1:20:26] you have the Holy Ghost which is the
[1:20:28] life of Jesus this is a this is a good
[1:20:31] question it's a very deep
[1:20:33] question and some say it is saying why
[1:20:36] it's saying Amen to the word so they
[1:20:38] jump and scream and holler to show the
[1:20:41] habit and underneath too many of them
[1:20:43] are dirty filthy unchanged
[1:20:46] lives so as brother Brandon would say
[1:20:50] and from that time he said I tell you a
[1:20:52] genuine Holy Spirit experience will
[1:20:54] punctuate every sentence of the Bible
[1:20:58] with an amen right regardless of what
[1:21:01] anybody else says it will certainly do
[1:21:03] it because it's the spirit of God the
[1:21:06] writer of the Bible and the spirit of
[1:21:07] the word is the holy spirit that's what
[1:21:09] quickens it the letter kth the spirit
[1:21:11] giveth it life see it gives the printed
[1:21:14] letter life makes it manifest brings it
[1:21:17] to pass exactly what God promised so you
[1:21:20] see a genuine Holy Spirit experience
[1:21:23] will punct uate every sentence of that
[1:21:28] Bible with an amen now sure sure without
[1:21:32] without question you know yes it will
[1:21:34] give a a verbal Amen to the
[1:21:38] word amen but the evidence of saying
[1:21:42] Amen to the word is not just a mental or
[1:21:46] a verbal asent to the word being truth
[1:21:50] it is the amen with your life
[1:21:54] amen when you read it in the word of God
[1:21:58] Amen it is something that says
[1:22:01] amen so be it to me
[1:22:04] Lord according to Thy word let that word
[1:22:09] live out of me that word comes out with
[1:22:11] an amen to
[1:22:14] it amen it's the amen of your life of
[1:22:18] course verbal agreement is important but
[1:22:20] the amen is that agreement that is sent
[1:22:23] to the word word and that must be
[1:22:26] expressed through the life that you
[1:22:29] live now it's like Elijah in the cave
[1:22:32] you know there was when he went in the
[1:22:34] cave and he was looking for God there
[1:22:36] there was a Russian Mighty Wind came by
[1:22:39] it was so strong that it broke rocks
[1:22:41] apart then there was a earthquake and
[1:22:44] then there was a fire and do you know
[1:22:46] God wasn't in any of
[1:22:48] them what what was that I want you to
[1:22:51] get this the those were only the effects
[1:22:55] of him passing
[1:22:59] by amen you you will see people jump and
[1:23:02] Shout run the aisles amen that isn't
[1:23:05] that isn't really God that's the effect
[1:23:09] that's right of nature of God passing
[1:23:13] by so you respond right amen so you you
[1:23:19] see but it didn't save the
[1:23:21] rocks it just broke them the beastes
[1:23:25] you know and and I I want you to see
[1:23:27] that it not just Earth moving or Earth
[1:23:30] shaking experiences nor nor just the
[1:23:33] fire of sanctification and you quit a
[1:23:35] few habits but you want to see the
[1:23:38] voice of the word that living out of
[1:23:42] your life this is what he said you know
[1:23:45] that but you know here's when he
[1:23:47] recognized it was God when that still
[1:23:49] Small Voice
[1:23:52] spoke right and that's what you're
[1:23:55] wanting to look for in your life it's
[1:23:57] not because you react to the spirit well
[1:24:00] that's really a spiritual person well
[1:24:02] they were spiritual enough they didn't
[1:24:04] sit there like a log you know they
[1:24:06] responded amen but you see again what
[1:24:09] you're looking for is the still small
[1:24:12] voice of his word living out your
[1:24:16] life and I'm not talking about on Sunday
[1:24:20] I'm talking about every day of your life
[1:24:23] amen the still small voice of the word
[1:24:26] living out of you amen you don't even
[1:24:30] claim the Holy Ghost and should not even
[1:24:33] claim the Holy Ghost and you're still
[1:24:34] lying and cheating and doing dirty
[1:24:36] business deals and you know some that
[1:24:39] claim the Holy Spirit has a has a spirit
[1:24:42] all right they got a spirit of greed
[1:24:44] that would rob their mother of the gold
[1:24:46] in their teeth amen that's not the Holy
[1:24:49] Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[1:24:50] pure and
[1:24:52] honest and whole holy and righteous and
[1:24:56] fair and treating others like you would
[1:24:59] want to be
[1:25:01] treated amen you know following even the
[1:25:04] golden rule of doing to
[1:25:07] others before they do it to
[1:25:11] you do it un the others as you would
[1:25:15] have them do it to
[1:25:17] you you see you see even even look look
[1:25:21] under the qualification of a deacon in a
[1:25:23] Ministry do you know do you know when
[1:25:25] Paul put this down and he he list all of
[1:25:28] these qualifications and people said
[1:25:31] well just a deacon supposed to be that
[1:25:32] way and just a preacher is supposed to
[1:25:34] be this way no those are qualifications
[1:25:36] of a Christian choose your leaders from
[1:25:40] these kind of
[1:25:44] Christians amen amen you see under the
[1:25:48] qualification of a deacon Paul said we
[1:25:50] to choose men who have good report from
[1:25:53] without the
[1:25:56] church amen he Comm He commands us to
[1:25:59] choose Godly men who are examples to
[1:26:02] those that around her not just good to
[1:26:04] church people you know and put on a
[1:26:07] front but I have a testimony from
[1:26:09] without that's right there's something
[1:26:12] about that man he's honest his word is
[1:26:15] true he never cheats he's fair in his
[1:26:18] business dealers he's moral he's
[1:26:22] upright amen all right
[1:26:25] you see the Bible said let those that
[1:26:27] name the name of Christ those who say
[1:26:29] I'm a Christian depart from
[1:26:34] iniquity this is very
[1:26:37] important you see you can you you really
[1:26:40] cannot meet God and remain the same you
[1:26:44] see a a person that claims the Holy
[1:26:46] Ghost and continues in sin and smokes
[1:26:48] and drinks continues in prostitution or
[1:26:51] even continues to dress in a provocative
[1:26:53] way I would doubt they ever met
[1:26:56] God exactly right saved you say I'm
[1:27:00] saved well saved from what he didn't
[1:27:03] come to save you in your sins he came to
[1:27:05] save you from your
[1:27:08] sins well well you said but well well
[1:27:10] we're just not perfect brother Tim we're
[1:27:12] just forgiven so we can't help but
[1:27:14] continue to sin don't you sin brother
[1:27:17] Tim well sure every day I fall short I
[1:27:20] make mistakes but Christians don't
[1:27:23] willfully
[1:27:25] sin but there are sins of omission like
[1:27:28] we don't pray the way we
[1:27:30] should amen we stood by and didn't help
[1:27:33] those that were in
[1:27:35] need and we didn't visit the sick and
[1:27:37] the needy and those in the nursing home
[1:27:39] the hospitals you know those are
[1:27:41] Christian duties and me we may maybe you
[1:27:44] know we but but let me just say a
[1:27:47] Christian doesn't habitually and
[1:27:49] willfully sin that's right Romans 61
[1:27:54] said what shall we say then shall we
[1:27:56] continue in sin so that Grace may may
[1:27:59] abound in other words should we keep on
[1:28:01] sinning so God will just give more
[1:28:05] grace and he said God forbid how shall
[1:28:08] we that are dead to sin live any longer
[1:28:12] therein now here is the Apostle Paul
[1:28:15] telling us really clear we are dead to
[1:28:20] Sin
[1:28:22] Sin and that old life is
[1:28:26] gone and we're alive in Christ let's go
[1:28:29] to 1 Corinthians 6 and9 because he gets
[1:28:32] very plain about things he says know ye
[1:28:35] not the unrighteous shall not inherit
[1:28:38] the kingdom of
[1:28:39] God be not deceived neither
[1:28:42] fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers
[1:28:46] and by the way in fornication and and
[1:28:49] adultery both of them that includes even
[1:28:53] even um even even pornography people
[1:28:56] want to say that's not a sin brother Tim
[1:28:59] you know I didn't do anything yes you
[1:29:03] did the Bible said if you looked upon a
[1:29:06] woman with and had lust in your heart
[1:29:08] you committed adultery wither already in
[1:29:10] your
[1:29:11] heart you see the heart needs to be
[1:29:14] changed we believe that there is a power
[1:29:18] of
[1:29:18] redemption that will cause a man to turn
[1:29:21] his
[1:29:22] head not dwell on that thing I mean you
[1:29:25] you may not help seeing some of the
[1:29:28] things that are out there the nudity
[1:29:30] that is there but you'll quickly turn
[1:29:31] your head and turn from it you see but
[1:29:34] but let me just say know you not the
[1:29:36] unrighteousness shall not inherit the
[1:29:38] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[1:29:40] fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers
[1:29:45] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[1:29:48] with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous
[1:29:52] nor drunkers nor revilers nor
[1:29:54] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[1:29:57] of God none of
[1:30:00] these amen none of these shall inherit
[1:30:04] the kingdom of God those that are
[1:30:07] Covetous some that you can't trust in
[1:30:10] your business deals and on and on and on
[1:30:12] like this they're Covetous there always
[1:30:14] there's a greed about them they will not
[1:30:18] inherit you can't get the Holy Ghost
[1:30:21] till that's dead in your life
[1:30:24] amen and and so here here's a condition
[1:30:28] that you cannot inherit there is no way
[1:30:31] you can receive the Holy Ghost until
[1:30:34] that is burned out of your
[1:30:37] life so and he and so you know it looks
[1:30:40] like you know that's pretty hopeless of
[1:30:43] us because many of us sitting right here
[1:30:46] have done those very things but look at
[1:30:49] the next scripture but and such were
[1:30:51] some of you but you are washed but you
[1:30:55] are Sanctified but you are declared
[1:30:59] righteous justified in the name of the
[1:31:01] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our
[1:31:05] God Amen so you see that was our past
[1:31:10] but that is not our
[1:31:13] future and it is not our present life
[1:31:17] because the life we live now in the
[1:31:20] flesh we live by the faith of the son of
[1:31:23] God God who loved us and gave his life
[1:31:27] for
[1:31:28] us amen now of course of course we
[1:31:33] believe the grace of God will and the
[1:31:35] favor of God will cover our lack because
[1:31:39] you know as long as we have this carnal
[1:31:42] nature it's a sticky
[1:31:43] nature and it's not converted that's
[1:31:46] right but I tell you what you got a you
[1:31:49] got a new birth on the inside with a
[1:31:51] king on the throne that can make this
[1:31:52] come subject to the word to God Amen now
[1:31:56] so let me let me just read to you from
[1:31:58] Jude 1:4 and he tells you of what the
[1:32:02] condition will be as they fall away from
[1:32:05] the faith he said certain men crep in
[1:32:07] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:32:11] to this condemnation ungodly men turning
[1:32:15] the grace of God into lasciviousness
[1:32:19] into a license to sin and denying the
[1:32:22] only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:25] well you know bless God I I tell you
[1:32:28] what I I'm not perfect but I'm forgiven
[1:32:30] you know God will forgive me for this
[1:32:32] listen let me tell you if the desire of
[1:32:35] sin is still in your life it is the
[1:32:38] evidence that God's desire isn't
[1:32:42] there amen the Holy Spirit on the inside
[1:32:45] of you will cause you to want to do
[1:32:48] right to surrender yourself to that to
[1:32:51] yield yourself as your head
[1:32:55] now I want to show you a principle in
[1:32:57] God's word that is very very important
[1:32:59] let's go to Second Timothy chapter 2
[1:33:02] verse 13 if we if we believe not yet he
[1:33:06] abideth
[1:33:07] faithful he cannot deny himself
[1:33:12] amen now this is a
[1:33:14] principle no matter what you
[1:33:17] do the Holy Spirit can never deny
[1:33:20] himself
[1:33:24] if someone says now now get this he
[1:33:28] cannot deny himself so none of the word
[1:33:33] can he
[1:33:35] deny if he puts something in his word he
[1:33:38] cannot back up from it he cannot deny if
[1:33:43] he's in your life and it doesn't matter
[1:33:46] you know if it's First Corinthians 11
[1:33:49] about men and women's roles and men men
[1:33:51] and women's dress it doesn't matter if
[1:33:54] it's Deuteronomy 225 again about men and
[1:33:57] women's role and men and women's dress
[1:34:00] it doesn't matter he
[1:34:03] cannot deny
[1:34:09] himself so the Holy Ghost in you will
[1:34:13] not deny that word to have rule over
[1:34:19] you now if someone says he's met God and
[1:34:23] says I don't believe in Divine Healing
[1:34:25] then I would doubt his
[1:34:28] experience amen cuz the Holy Spirit
[1:34:31] within you cannot deny himself if he
[1:34:34] says the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh
[1:34:36] it's only emotion I I don't believe in
[1:34:39] it then I doubt he's ever experienced it
[1:34:42] himself you see to to quote the words of
[1:34:46] the Prophet to a woman that was once ill
[1:34:48] fed and smoked cigarettes and drank
[1:34:50] prostitute if that woman claims she's
[1:34:52] met God as still does in the same things
[1:34:55] I doubt her word if a man tells me he's
[1:34:59] met God and says I don't believe in such
[1:35:01] thing is Divine Healing I doubt his
[1:35:03] experience cuz God can't lie about his
[1:35:06] own word if the Holy Spirit wrote the
[1:35:09] word when he comes in it'll say Amen to
[1:35:12] every word he wrote amen if if a man
[1:35:16] says he don't believe in the baptism of
[1:35:18] the Holy Ghost I doubt he's ever met God
[1:35:22] he might be called a intellectual a
[1:35:25] great man an orer of some sort but he's
[1:35:29] never met God the holy spirit of God in
[1:35:32] a man will speak Amen to every word of
[1:35:35] God say I I did not once believe in
[1:35:39] Divine Healing but one day I met God and
[1:35:42] from that time it changed me there's
[1:35:45] something come into me that transformed
[1:35:47] me it gave me an experience I've never
[1:35:49] been able to forget it no one can meet
[1:35:51] God without being changed and some
[1:35:56] way so the very best witness that we got
[1:36:01] the Holy Ghost is when our spirit Bears
[1:36:03] record with the
[1:36:07] word John
[1:36:10] 15:26 but when the comforter is come who
[1:36:13] I will send to you from the father even
[1:36:16] the spirit of Truth which proceedeth
[1:36:19] from the father he shall testify of
[1:36:24] me so you see this is the witness he
[1:36:27] will be in you and he will witness of
[1:36:31] Christ he will bear testimony of Jesus
[1:36:35] Christ everywhere you turn you will give
[1:36:38] witness amen That Jesus
[1:36:41] Lives not 2,000 years ago lives in
[1:36:47] you now if we call our Christan s
[1:36:49] Christians say we're filled with the
[1:36:51] Holy Ghost and we see the baptism of the
[1:36:53] Holy spirit is poured out on the
[1:36:55] Believers for all ages and our spirit
[1:36:57] said that's for another age you're
[1:36:59] wrong when the Bible said Jesus Christ
[1:37:02] the same yesterday today and forever our
[1:37:04] spirit said no he's dead he's going on
[1:37:06] there's something wrong Jesus said the
[1:37:08] works that I do shall you do also L I'm
[1:37:11] with you always even the end the world
[1:37:13] and if our spirit pulls back from that
[1:37:16] we haven't got the Holy Ghost for the
[1:37:19] holy spirit will say Amen to every word
[1:37:23] he wrot wrote now intellectual knowledge
[1:37:26] will pull you away from it but the holy
[1:37:28] spirit will say Amen to his own word he
[1:37:31] certainly will and he's seeking and
[1:37:32] hunting and trying to find someone he
[1:37:34] can put himself into he longs to do

[1:40:28] church if you want to tell me there's
[1:40:31] people that come to this church that
[1:40:33] aren't born again I'll say you better
[1:40:35] believe it and I hope they
[1:40:40] do amen I hope they keep
[1:40:44] coming amen you know you say well you
[1:40:47] know I I'll tell you what brother Tim
[1:40:49] there's there's there's some of that
[1:40:51] that they just don't live right
[1:40:54] yeah there kind there's all kinds of
[1:40:57] Believers some of them are Justified
[1:41:00] their sins forgiven of the past some of
[1:41:03] them have been you can get them to be
[1:41:05] Sanctified and they've got some
[1:41:07] cleansing of some
[1:41:08] sins but there are also going to be some
[1:41:11] really genuinely filled with the Holy
[1:41:13] Ghost men and
[1:41:15] women but if you get your eyes on just
[1:41:20] people amen you will fall away just like
[1:41:24] they would in the days when Judas
[1:41:26] betrayed the Lord because he had this
[1:41:28] profession of faith and he even did
[1:41:30] Miracles and even shouted and had
[1:41:33] everything
[1:41:34] else but when it come down to The
[1:41:36] Showdown he didn't have
[1:41:39] it now well I I don't come I don't come
[1:41:43] to church because there's
[1:41:45] Hypocrites you know what the word
[1:41:46] hypocrite means it means
[1:41:49] actor Jesus would use the word there and
[1:41:52] coin it in his day for those who are
[1:41:54] just acting he said you Pharisees you're
[1:41:57] actors you're not really
[1:42:00] genuine you're
[1:42:02] actors and and he said you and and let
[1:42:05] me just tell you there are people that
[1:42:07] are actors that come to
[1:42:10] church they act like they dress up like
[1:42:14] Believers but their hearts never been
[1:42:18] changed and I'm just going to give you a
[1:42:21] a a a warning right here you're not
[1:42:23] going to find a church where everybody
[1:42:26] is
[1:42:28] perfect you you'll find them in all
[1:42:31] stages of growth that's right we're
[1:42:34] going to have those that are
[1:42:36] Justified we're going to have those that
[1:42:38] are
[1:42:39] Sanctified and we're going to have those
[1:42:41] that are sealed to the day of
[1:42:43] redemption you'll find them in all
[1:42:45] stages of growth a a church is
[1:42:49] where imperfect humans come to become
[1:42:55] perfect now Church attendant itself
[1:42:58] won't do it but a nature change will
[1:43:01] that's right and that when you get in
[1:43:03] the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:43:05] right come on if there's a c Gene of God
[1:43:08] in there you're going to start
[1:43:10] developing something's going to start
[1:43:12] changing on the inside of you that's
[1:43:14] right now I'm just going to tell you if
[1:43:16] you if you find a perfect church I'm
[1:43:20] just going to ask you please listen to
[1:43:22] me don't go
[1:43:26] there because you're going to ruin
[1:43:29] it because once you there it won't be
[1:43:33] perfect no
[1:43:36] more now you see a hypocrite you know a
[1:43:40] lot of people will hide behind that well
[1:43:43] there's people there that don't do right
[1:43:45] yeah there
[1:43:46] are amen and you'll hide behind it but
[1:43:49] you know you got to be smaller than what
[1:43:51] you hide behind
[1:43:53] that's right so if you hide behind an
[1:43:55] old hypocrite because he he's a
[1:43:57] hypocrite and and and there's Hypocrites
[1:44:00] go there and you hide behind that you're
[1:44:01] little than they are I tell you what I
[1:44:04] would rather be a somebody even a
[1:44:07] hypocrite an actor that is still coming
[1:44:09] to church and knocking on the
[1:44:12] door and asking so that they can receive
[1:44:16] and seeking so they can find and
[1:44:19] knocking that it' be open to them I'd
[1:44:20] rather see that than somebody you say
[1:44:23] well I tell you I wash my hands of all
[1:44:25] of
[1:44:27] it
[1:44:29] amen but I want to to say shame on those
[1:44:31] who claim the spirit and living a little
[1:44:33] sneaky dirty
[1:44:35] life brother Bram said that in the
[1:44:38] Ephesian Church age but today people
[1:44:41] like this is the only thing there live
[1:44:43] like this is the only thing there was
[1:44:46] live here on the earth that's all you
[1:44:48] don't realize you got a soul that's
[1:44:50] going to leave here and go somewhere and
[1:44:53] you seal your destination right here the
[1:44:55] way you live the way you do out holding
[1:44:58] grudges and mean and everything and then
[1:45:00] rub the church oh mercy shame on you we
[1:45:04] we you you bring a reproach upon the
[1:45:07] cause of Christ isn't that right don't
[1:45:09] we do it the the Bootleggers ain't
[1:45:12] hurting the church it isn't that it
[1:45:14] isn't the prostitute that's hurting the
[1:45:16] church it's the people who profess to be
[1:45:19] Christians that's hurting the church we
[1:45:22] know what the boot leer is and The
[1:45:24] Prostitute is but when our sisters dress
[1:45:27] like a prostitute that's different
[1:45:30] that's what hurts the church when a man
[1:45:31] drinks like the bo leer well that's what
[1:45:34] hurts the church they're professing to
[1:45:36] be a Christian and they do that and and
[1:45:39] people look for you that name let him
[1:45:41] that even names the name of Jesus Christ
[1:45:44] depart from iniquity get away from it I
[1:45:47] I just want to say to you as a church
[1:45:49] body today be careful in your deep deing
[1:45:53] with others if you name the name of
[1:45:56] Christ depart from iniquity the least
[1:46:00] thing you want to do is bring shame on
[1:46:03] the name of Christ upon the church the
[1:46:06] body of Christ upon the message of the
[1:46:10] hour hallelujah amen don't be guilty of
[1:46:13] bringing shame on the name of Jesus
[1:46:15] Christ right now right now even today
[1:46:18] the newspapers are full of horror
[1:46:21] stories because men have brought shame
[1:46:24] on the message of Jesus
[1:46:27] Christ amen
[1:46:30] now you see as brother brandom said it
[1:46:33] is rizing the how can you say the spirit
[1:46:36] dwells in you though you've done
[1:46:38] everything you thought was right here's
[1:46:39] your evidence whether you got or not if
[1:46:42] that spirit that was in Christ is in you
[1:46:46] it also quickens you to the word for he
[1:46:49] is the word if it if it's contrary it
[1:46:52] quickens you away from the word that it
[1:46:54] isn't the spirit of
[1:46:56] Christ and my my sheep hears my voice
[1:47:01] and they live by every word every word
[1:47:05] amen so you see this is what that a man
[1:47:09] must live here's where real Christian
[1:47:11] Life is living by every
[1:47:15] word and if the holy spirit is in your
[1:47:18] life it will Quicken you to the word
[1:47:23] oh yeah you'll be tempted but in that
[1:47:25] Temptation what will you do go to the
[1:47:30] word
[1:47:32] amen now as he said in who is this mezc
[1:47:36] like you women claiming the Holy Ghost
[1:47:39] and going out here and wearing shorts
[1:47:40] and things how could you do it how could
[1:47:43] the spirit of God in you ever let you do
[1:47:45] such a thing as that it just can't be
[1:47:48] he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy
[1:47:51] Spirit and when you be become subject to
[1:47:53] that Spirit it throws your whole being
[1:47:56] subject to that spirit and that spirit
[1:47:58] is nothing in the world but the seed
[1:48:00] word made manifest her quickened
[1:48:02] Hallelujah Made Alive and what the Bible
[1:48:04] says don't do this the body quickly
[1:48:07] turns to to it there's no question so
[1:48:10] here's the thing if if the word says
[1:48:12] something you quickly turn to it you
[1:48:15] turn away from sin and you turn to what
[1:48:19] the word
[1:48:21] said because it again the love of God's
[1:48:23] in your heart you're going to
[1:48:25] what keep his
[1:48:29] Commandments now you see there was a
[1:48:34] time that the inoculation for sin wasn't
[1:48:37] too good in the Old Testament there was
[1:48:40] a conscience always of sin and a man
[1:48:43] worshiper would have to come year by
[1:48:45] year and and make his offering so they
[1:48:49] were continually offering lambs and and
[1:48:51] on and on and on and on because it
[1:48:54] didn't
[1:48:55] last you see the the nature of that
[1:48:58] woolly animal lamb could not come back
[1:49:01] upon the believer but that's not so
[1:49:04] under this Covenant in this Covenant the
[1:49:07] the life of your sacrifice the life of
[1:49:11] your lamb returns back upon you as a
[1:49:15] Believer and it's Christ now living out
[1:49:18] his life in
[1:49:20] you amen now if you want want to know if
[1:49:23] you want to know the Eternal
[1:49:24] prescription is not
[1:49:27] changed remember I don't care how much
[1:49:30] Peter had a revelation and and and it
[1:49:33] was from
[1:49:35] God I don't care how much they profess
[1:49:39] to believe th art the Christ the son of
[1:49:42] the Living God had confession of
[1:49:45] Faith he was not
[1:49:49] converted Jesus would say to him Peter
[1:49:52] after you are converted strengthen your
[1:49:55] brethren he do this he does this on the
[1:49:58] day of Pentecost and and there Peter on
[1:50:01] the day of Pentecost gives Eternal
[1:50:03] prescription and nothing let me tell you
[1:50:06] it's an eternal one I don't care how
[1:50:08] modern things get I don't care what the
[1:50:12] public cinnamon is amen the prescription
[1:50:15] for sin does not change and if you try
[1:50:19] to tber with it it will not an culate
[1:50:23] you from
[1:50:25] death amen this is why brother Bram said
[1:50:28] that somebody has messed with the
[1:50:30] prescription is why sin is still in the
[1:50:36] church but he gave an eternal
[1:50:38] prescription and you know what that is
[1:50:40] Acts 2:38 Peter said repent and be
[1:50:43] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:50:46] Jesus Christ for the remission of sin
[1:50:48] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:50:51] Holy Ghost amen now let me just say
[1:50:54] again the Holy Ghost as a
[1:50:56] gift he will gift you with
[1:51:00] himself amen so notice the very very
[1:51:06] first there are F the very first uh part
[1:51:10] of the prescription is repentance that's
[1:51:13] right if you don't get that
[1:51:17] right you will never get the spirit of
[1:51:20] God
[1:51:23] amen you you see in in Acts chapter 3:19
[1:51:27] he says repent ye therefore and be
[1:51:30] converted so again repentance is a part
[1:51:34] of
[1:51:37] conversion and and so he said repent and
[1:51:40] be converted that your sins might be
[1:51:42] blotted out so here again here this is
[1:51:44] how we get our sins remitted that's
[1:51:47] right if we come and re
[1:51:49] repent we we acknowledge our
[1:51:53] wrongs amen we we
[1:51:56] say it's more than a a lip service of
[1:52:00] saying I'm
[1:52:01] sorry but it's a it's a Godly
[1:52:05] sorrow for our
[1:52:07] sins amen listen repentance is not an
[1:52:14] option amen Acts chapter 17 verse 30
[1:52:18] says that God commandeth all men every
[1:52:22] everywhere to repent so repentance is a
[1:52:27] commandment here again it's part of the
[1:52:30] prescription it's it's some of the
[1:52:31] things that are put together in the
[1:52:33] vaccine the Divine
[1:52:36] vaccine and if it ain't
[1:52:41] there so you just might as well be
[1:52:43] pumping water into you or
[1:52:47] air amen God commanded all men
[1:52:51] everywhere to
[1:52:54] repent you
[1:52:56] see we we go back to this inoculation
[1:53:00] and I I want to just talk about it for a
[1:53:02] minute cuz the Old Testament didn't have
[1:53:06] it they were given the law and they
[1:53:08] tried to be righteous and there was a
[1:53:11] perfection even as Paul would say if
[1:53:15] this Perfection required or was it James
[1:53:17] where he said if you sin in one point
[1:53:21] you're guilty of all of
[1:53:23] it you might do this right and that
[1:53:26] right and this right and that right and
[1:53:27] this right and that right but if you s
[1:53:28] in one point you're guilty of doing
[1:53:36] everything now David was a predestinated
[1:53:39] seed but he lacked the water of the
[1:53:41] spirit to make the seed alive to Quicken
[1:53:44] it so he was constantly
[1:53:48] falling and no matter how predestinated
[1:53:52] every genuine seed must be quickened by
[1:53:55] the spirit this this is where we have
[1:53:57] gone on predestination even around the
[1:53:59] message well I'm
[1:54:01] predestinated I'm a predestinated see if
[1:54:04] that seed does not get quickened by the
[1:54:08] baptism by the Holy
[1:54:10] Ghost it's just going to remain dormant
[1:54:12] on the inside of
[1:54:15] you it takes a quickening power of God
[1:54:18] to make that seed come to life to
[1:54:19] germinate it makes no difference how
[1:54:22] predestinated you are and I do you
[1:54:25] believe you are predestinated to
[1:54:28] adoption to becoming sons of God I
[1:54:31] believe that there that is your destiny
[1:54:33] and I want to even tell even a sinner
[1:54:35] today that that I want to believe for
[1:54:37] you that's your destiny your destiny is
[1:54:40] not to remain a sinner all your life
[1:54:43] live an assorted evil life I want to
[1:54:46] tell you there's a Destiny for you but I
[1:54:49] tell you the only way the only way that
[1:54:52] that seed can ever come to life is by an
[1:54:55] oldfashioned outpouring of the baptism
[1:54:59] of the Holy Ghost that quickens and
[1:55:01] brings that seed to
[1:55:05] life
[1:55:07] now otherwise it leaves it leaves lives
[1:55:11] dormant and
[1:55:15] Powerless I mean let me just stop for a
[1:55:19] minute you take a man and I was going to
[1:55:22] call the name use an example but I
[1:55:24] won't but you take a man that all his
[1:55:27] life he's lived the wrong kind of Life
[1:55:31] he's lived a life of sin he's a you know
[1:55:35] he's been maybe in alcohol or maybe he's
[1:55:38] been in drugs or prostitution or or or
[1:55:43] whatever every kind of evil
[1:55:46] life you take a man
[1:55:49] he has always been a a predestinated
[1:55:57] seed even when he was in a as a sinner
[1:56:01] he was a predestinated
[1:56:05] seed and you can be a predestinated seed
[1:56:09] and smoke and drink and lie and cuss and
[1:56:12] everything else because that was our
[1:56:16] past that's there ain't a seed here that
[1:56:20] they can't say I lived in
[1:56:22] corruption the life that I lived in the
[1:56:26] past I was aive of
[1:56:30] sin but there was a
[1:56:33] moment where the Holy Spirit came down
[1:56:36] upon you and Quicken that seed your life
[1:56:41] and you can never ever ever go back to
[1:56:44] being a sinner
[1:56:48] again Hallelujah because you can't kill
[1:56:52] a predestinated
[1:56:54] [Applause]
[1:56:56] seed so your sin does not change your
[1:57:00] predestination but I'll tell you there
[1:57:02] in your predestination there is a
[1:57:04] destiny set for you and that is for you
[1:57:07] to meet God whether you're 12 years old
[1:57:10] or you're 90 you're going to meet him as
[1:57:12] a predestinated seed and there will be a
[1:57:17] change of
[1:57:19] quickening of bringing to life of that
[1:57:21] seed now you know in that condition
[1:57:23] brother Bram was talking about it he
[1:57:25] said as a sinner boy I would sit here
[1:57:28] and on the creek bank and you know I I
[1:57:30] would sit up all night you know because
[1:57:33] um my parents was having a party and I
[1:57:35] lay up on the roof until uh the old 10
[1:57:38] shed until morning till it all died down
[1:57:41] and then I would go in I'd sit out on
[1:57:43] the creek bank and I would look there
[1:57:45] and I would see there's a little flower
[1:57:47] there and I said flower how did you get
[1:57:49] here I burned a fire here last year
[1:57:52] he said how did you get there he said
[1:57:54] you see there was something in
[1:57:57] me all the time that was longing for God
[1:58:02] for longing to be
[1:58:04] quickened every one of you can say that
[1:58:07] as a sinner there was something in you
[1:58:09] that was crying out I want to do right I
[1:58:12] want to I I I don't want to live this
[1:58:14] way I want to rise up above that what
[1:58:17] was that that was that
[1:58:19] predestinated seed of the in inside of
[1:58:22] you that was crying out for
[1:58:26] life but one day the season
[1:58:30] changed I don't care if you were 16 or
[1:58:33] you were 90 the season changed and when
[1:58:36] the season changed and the rain of the
[1:58:39] Holy Spirit came down on that
[1:58:41] predestinated sea it brought it to
[1:58:47] life and you can no long no more go back
[1:58:50] to being dead again
[1:58:54] because this life
[1:58:57] eternal now we live in a polluted hour
[1:59:01] and everything has become diluted by
[1:59:03] have your way
[1:59:05] Christianity I'm going to to say this
[1:59:06] the gospel is not a smus board where you
[1:59:09] just kind of pick and choose what you
[1:59:11] want of
[1:59:12] it it is you eat it
[1:59:16] all and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:18] in the last days it shows you Revelation
[1:59:21] 108
[1:59:23] take the book and eat
[1:59:25] it come on eat it all some things are
[1:59:30] bitter some things will actually kill
[1:59:33] mortify your
[1:59:37] members but you know today it's all a
[1:59:41] superficial
[1:59:43] repentance you know
[1:59:45] uh it's just you
[1:59:49] know that's just temporary yeah yeah
[1:59:51] yeah yeah Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry I
[1:59:53] shouldn't have done that you know and
[1:59:55] it's a flipping attitude listen
[1:59:56] repentance that change of mind that
[1:59:58] comes from a contract and broken heart
[2:00:01] and surrender
[2:00:02] desires they want to take that and turn
[2:00:05] it to just turn into a new Leaf or
[2:00:08] making an equivalent of a New Year's res
[2:00:10] resolution well first of the
[2:00:14] year tell you what I'm going to be
[2:00:17] different you
[2:00:19] won't maybe for a little while
[2:00:22] but even if in all your
[2:00:25] goodness and all that you try without
[2:00:28] Christ you're still
[2:00:30] nothing you you see this is the hour of
[2:00:33] cheap
[2:00:35] impersonations you're born again that's
[2:00:37] sacred experience of the cleansing of
[2:00:39] the soul the forgiveness of sin has just
[2:00:41] been reduced to church
[2:00:44] joining walk in the aisle and making a
[2:00:46] profession I believe in Jesus I believe
[2:00:49] the
[2:00:50] message the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:00:53] has been reduced either to emotionalism
[2:00:56] or some weak
[2:00:57] confession and I and I want to say it's
[2:01:00] not emotionalism is
[2:01:02] deity coming to dwell on the inside of
[2:01:05] the
[2:01:06] soul and there are those who want to be
[2:01:09] forgiven who never repent they want to
[2:01:12] restor but they don't want to really
[2:01:14] repent repenting is not say I'm sorry
[2:01:17] you know many times I'm sorry I got
[2:01:19] caught
[2:01:22] my life's a mess and I'm I'm sorry it's
[2:01:25] a it's just a bad mess you know whatever
[2:01:28] and and and they're sorry they caught
[2:01:30] and they throw away their Birthright and
[2:01:33] they're like Esau who then they want to
[2:01:36] just act like nothing
[2:01:39] happened that's what Esau did he he he
[2:01:43] he wanted to throw away his
[2:01:48] Birthright he had an attitude toward the
[2:01:51] new birth he just threw it
[2:01:54] away let me just say you know what
[2:01:58] the the birthright is it's the right
[2:02:03] birth and here he had here he had the
[2:02:07] the opportunity to be the air of all
[2:02:12] things and what did he do in a moment of
[2:02:15] weakness in a moment of of time he he
[2:02:19] spurned the
[2:02:20] birthright but he wanted to go right on
[2:02:23] like nothing happened he still wanted
[2:02:26] the blessings without the
[2:02:31] birthright and that's the way many
[2:02:33] people are they want God's blessing
[2:02:36] without the
[2:02:38] birthright you know they're sorry
[2:02:40] they're sorry they got caught and they
[2:02:41] throw away their Birthright and they
[2:02:43] want to act like something you know
[2:02:46] nothing nothing ever happened ah you
[2:02:47] know they still want their place of
[2:02:50] prestige they still want their honor
[2:02:54] among Brethren they still want to they
[2:02:57] want to start up where they left
[2:02:59] off you know they don't want to do it
[2:03:01] with any Godly
[2:03:03] sorrow they don't want to W with tears
[2:03:06] on the floor and agonizing for before
[2:03:08] God let me just show you here in second
[2:03:11] um Corinthians 1710 for Godly
[2:03:15] sorrow produces repentance leading to
[2:03:19] Salvation so now you're not not going to
[2:03:22] have real repentance without Godly
[2:03:25] sorrow that's right because Godly sorrow
[2:03:29] worketh repentance to Salvation not to
[2:03:33] be repented of but the sorrow of death
[2:03:35] worketh death now so the sorrow of the
[2:03:38] world produces death now notice here as
[2:03:40] we look at here again Godly sorrow
[2:03:43] produces you see he is close to them
[2:03:47] here's where you want God to come close
[2:03:50] many of you will come up in the Altar
[2:03:52] and you'll say I want a closer walk with
[2:03:54] God I'll tell you where he draws M and
[2:03:57] that is to a broken and a contrite
[2:04:01] heart and the Bible said when he finds a
[2:04:04] broken and a contrite heart he will not
[2:04:07] despise it he will not turn it
[2:04:12] away well I've asked God for the Holy
[2:04:15] Ghost and I I I want the holy spirit in
[2:04:17] my life where is that broken spirit
[2:04:22] am where is that contrite heart where is
[2:04:26] that God I've done wrong I'm got to be
[2:04:30] changed amen where you sweat it out
[2:04:33] where a place where you watered out
[2:04:35] sometimes at the altar I don't care if
[2:04:38] the altar is here in your seat or there
[2:04:39] at home I don't care where the altar is
[2:04:41] but will you wed
[2:04:43] out amen where where you come to the
[2:04:46] point I I I need Jesus I don't want
[2:04:50] another minute without him
[2:04:55] amen but you see is a
[2:04:58] careless oh nobody's
[2:05:02] perfect everybody does you know I I know
[2:05:05] other I tell you what I've seen so and
[2:05:06] so they shouted all over the place and
[2:05:08] they still do
[2:05:10] this listen don't you judge your life by
[2:05:13] the
[2:05:16] others you judge your life by the word
[2:05:22] come
[2:05:23] on let's let's go to Psalms 32 and verse
[2:05:27] one blessed is the man whose
[2:05:29] transgressions Is Forgiven whose sins is
[2:05:33] covered that's the man I want to be that
[2:05:35] happy man happy is this man whose
[2:05:39] transgression is Forgiven whose sins are
[2:05:41] covered blessed is the man unto whom the
[2:05:44] Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose
[2:05:48] Spirit there is no God he's honest he's
[2:05:51] true truthful and in his spirit and and
[2:05:54] and pure blessed are the pure in heart
[2:05:56] for they shall see God so blessed is the
[2:06:00] man unto the L unto the whom the Lord
[2:06:03] imputeth not
[2:06:04] iniquity what's now when I kept Silence
[2:06:08] about my sin my bones wax old to the
[2:06:12] Roaring all the day well you know again
[2:06:15] when I kept silence my my body wasted
[2:06:18] away to the groaning all day long for
[2:06:21] day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me
[2:06:25] my moisture is turned to Drought of the
[2:06:28] summer the the hand is heavy my Vitality
[2:06:31] is drained away as a fever Heat Of
[2:06:34] Summer here here's David talking about
[2:06:37] you know blessed is the man whose sins
[2:06:39] are forgiven whose
[2:06:41] transgression is Forgiven his sins are
[2:06:43] covered and then he says when I kept
[2:06:45] silent about my
[2:06:50] sin what I
[2:06:52] said oh I can just live any way you know
[2:06:55] I'm as good as any somebody else like I
[2:06:57] said don't you judge yourself by that
[2:07:00] right well they do so and so and they're
[2:07:03] Christian everybody think I don't care
[2:07:05] what everybody thinks we when it comes
[2:07:08] down to it we're going to be judged by
[2:07:09] what God
[2:07:11] thinks you will not be judged by how you
[2:07:14] measure up to me or any other person in
[2:07:17] the church you will be judged how you
[2:07:20] measure up to Christ
[2:07:22] who's the word now so sin must be
[2:07:26] acknowledged verse 5 when I I
[2:07:29] acknowledge my sin unto thee and my
[2:07:33] iniquity have I not hid I said I will
[2:07:36] confess my transgressions unto the Lord
[2:07:38] and thou forgave us the iniquity of my
[2:07:40] sins so again you know here comes
[2:07:43] repentance with acknowledgment I'm a
[2:07:46] sinner I need
[2:07:49] Jesus I've been trying to live the
[2:07:51] Christian life but I
[2:07:54] can't I keep living this I'm in a
[2:07:56] vicious cycle all the time over and over
[2:07:59] and over
[2:08:00] again well acknowledge I need the
[2:08:04] Lord I need
[2:08:06] Jesus and then begin to seek him with
[2:08:08] all your heart and when you seek him
[2:08:11] with all your heart that's the day you
[2:08:12] find him oh I've seen it I've seen it I
[2:08:17] I've been through enough tricks of the
[2:08:19] trade through the years I've seen little
[2:08:22] girls coming to the church and get her
[2:08:23] eyes on the boy and want this boy and
[2:08:26] say well I'll tell you what I tell you
[2:08:28] I'll put away my makeup and my pants and
[2:08:30] my whatever I I want this boy I I tell
[2:08:32] you I I I want to I want this boy and to
[2:08:36] take all her all her clothes and all her
[2:08:38] lipstick and all her makeup and all her
[2:08:40] jewelry and everything else and go and
[2:08:42] bury
[2:08:43] it when it didn't work up she work out
[2:08:46] she just dug it
[2:08:49] up that's not God Godly
[2:08:54] sorrow you know well I would serve you
[2:08:57] but I tell you I want this girl I want
[2:08:59] this boy I want this I I want that I
[2:09:01] want to hold on to
[2:09:07] this years ago we used to tell little
[2:09:09] story as kids you know about a church
[2:09:15] service say God's
[2:09:17] everywhere and the preacher preaching
[2:09:19] God is everywhere God knows what what's
[2:09:21] in your heart God knows
[2:09:23] everything God's everywhere one man
[2:09:27] sitting back there and said oh God don't
[2:09:28] be B down there in my pocket where my
[2:09:30] tobacco
[2:09:32] is you see there was something on the
[2:09:34] inside that they was holding on
[2:09:37] to and that's one thing you you say well
[2:09:40] the holy spirit is is been held from me
[2:09:43] and why well I tell you he's looking to
[2:09:45] see that
[2:09:47] everything has been brought subject to
[2:09:50] the word is it cannot on the Journey
[2:09:53] break
[2:09:54] apart are you with me so he checks
[2:09:58] everything is this sealed in is that
[2:10:00] sealed in have you given this to him
[2:10:02] have you surrendered that to him and
[2:10:04] he's not going to come in and seal the
[2:10:06] car as long as there's something loose
[2:10:09] in your
[2:10:17] life for this shall everyone that is
[2:10:20] Godly pray pray unto thee in a time when
[2:10:22] thou mayest be found surely in the
[2:10:24] floods of great water they shall not
[2:10:26] come nigh unto
[2:10:28] him so you pray in a time where he may
[2:10:32] be
[2:10:33] found because God will not always strive
[2:10:36] with
[2:10:40] man there be a time where men will
[2:10:43] change their mind but it'll be too
[2:10:46] late not as Esau Hebrews 12 and: 16 see
[2:10:50] that no one sexually immoral or Godless
[2:10:53] like Esau who for a single meal sold his
[2:10:57] inheritance rights as the oldest son
[2:11:00] verse 16 afterwards as you know he
[2:11:02] wanted to inherit this blessing and he
[2:11:04] was rejected he could bring no change of
[2:11:07] mind though he sought the blessings with
[2:11:09] tears this is this is he found no place
[2:11:12] of repentance there comes a point where
[2:11:14] he crushed the
[2:11:16] line he throw away the birthright and he
[2:11:20] comes down to a point that he wants it
[2:11:22] now I want it now and I want the
[2:11:24] blessing and yet he seeks it with tears
[2:11:27] and he can't find
[2:11:29] it now David's
[2:11:33] sin he had hit it it was brought out by
[2:11:37] the prophet
[2:11:38] Nathan you know sin has a way of working
[2:11:41] its way itself out of your subconscious
[2:11:45] and coming to the surface it's like a
[2:11:47] splinter that gets deep down inside and
[2:11:50] it's there and it'll fester and fester
[2:11:52] and it'll eventually come out and and
[2:11:54] and and and start heading outside the
[2:11:56] body it don't belong there and sin has a
[2:11:59] way of working itself out of your
[2:12:01] subconscious coming to the surface and
[2:12:04] David admitted it when he was confronted
[2:12:07] he didn't blame
[2:12:09] others that's what happens to so many
[2:12:11] people you know when it comes down to
[2:12:13] sin well you know they want to blame
[2:12:15] somebody else for why they are the way
[2:12:18] they
[2:12:18] are well it was my upbringing no it's
[2:12:21] your
[2:12:26] choice well you know if my parents had
[2:12:29] done this and this and this I wouldn't
[2:12:31] be this way no you made a
[2:12:33] choice well I'm codependent with my dad
[2:12:37] you know he was a drunk and alcohol this
[2:12:39] is why I I act like this no it's because
[2:12:42] of a
[2:12:48] choice there is none of
[2:12:51] that don't have Cycles to break in our
[2:12:58] lives every one of us had to break
[2:13:02] Cycles where that we lived in a cycle of
[2:13:05] sin and failure we were raised up that
[2:13:08] way and the and this Pagan culture that
[2:13:11] we live in pushes us toward Sin from the
[2:13:16] time we're a
[2:13:18] child amen yes but let me tell you you
[2:13:22] have to break the cycles of of that the
[2:13:24] break of the cycle of sin but you see
[2:13:26] David didn't blame others well if IID
[2:13:29] had a
[2:13:30] daddy if my daddy would have been at
[2:13:33] home and he would have raised me right
[2:13:35] and he would have been an example or if
[2:13:37] my mama would have been a better example
[2:13:39] no you have a choice right you can
[2:13:43] continue that way or you can break that
[2:13:46] cycle and say I'm not going to be that
[2:13:49] way
[2:13:51] I may be their child physically but I am
[2:13:53] not their child spiritually I'm a child
[2:13:56] of the most high God and I don't have to
[2:13:58] serve sin like they
[2:14:00] did every one of us has to break
[2:14:03] cycles and like a preacher you know who
[2:14:06] commit adultery and yet blame others who
[2:14:08] exposed him yeah I did it but they told
[2:14:10] on
[2:14:12] me they were
[2:14:16] gossipers I did it but you know this is
[2:14:19] the way Saul was when he sent he didn't
[2:14:21] repent until it was too
[2:14:24] late he had sinned he disobeyed the
[2:14:26] prophet and then he blamed the
[2:14:29] people then he blamed the prophet and
[2:14:33] then he blamed the
[2:14:34] Lord and even Adam did this when he s he
[2:14:37] said the woman you gave
[2:14:40] me rather than saying yes I made a
[2:14:44] conscious deason to do wrong I sinned he
[2:14:47] said no I tell you but the woman the
[2:14:50] woman did it and you gave her to me so
[2:14:53] ultimately God you're the blame for the
[2:14:56] reason I
[2:15:00] am now you
[2:15:03] see that's the way that is we play the
[2:15:06] blame game why I am the way I am well I
[2:15:09] can't help it no it's your
[2:15:13] mountain and you can't move it right so
[2:15:17] you can't help it but if you surrender
[2:15:19] your life to God
[2:15:22] that not by man's might nor by Man's
[2:15:25] power but by my spirit the Holy Ghost
[2:15:28] you can move that
[2:15:30] mountain I don't care how big it's been
[2:15:32] and how long it's been in your family
[2:15:35] and it affected you and it affected your
[2:15:37] father and affected your grandfather and
[2:15:39] your great grandmother and it comes all
[2:15:41] the way down through the family
[2:15:44] tree amen I tell you what when the Holy
[2:15:47] Ghost comes on the inside of you it
[2:15:49] gives you a new
[2:15:53] genealogy Well church people did me
[2:15:55] wrong and the preachers did me wrong and
[2:15:58] if they would have done this and if they
[2:16:00] hadn't done that and if they had spoke
[2:16:01] to me the way they spoke to me you made
[2:16:04] a
[2:16:11] choice and that's way Saul did and
[2:16:14] that's not
[2:16:18] repentance see that's still resisting
[2:16:22] pushing back against
[2:16:25] God now David knew the word he knew
[2:16:28] God's precepts but he had no power to
[2:16:30] live it he said I've taken your word
[2:16:33] hidden in my heart I've memorized the
[2:16:36] scriptures I put it as front LS before
[2:16:38] my eyes I've tied it up on my hands it's
[2:16:41] on the doorpost as I walk out and he
[2:16:43] walked out and saw be
[2:16:45] Sheba and forgot all of
[2:16:48] that he went around all of his all of
[2:16:53] his great
[2:16:58] claims all his
[2:17:01] profession I want to I want you to turn
[2:17:03] with me to Psalms
[2:17:06] 51 and I want you to watch the preface
[2:17:08] of this so you'll know exactly the
[2:17:12] setting to the chief musician a Psalm of
[2:17:16] David when Nathan the prophet came unto
[2:17:19] him after he had gone into
[2:17:23] Beba so here's David now and I want you
[2:17:27] to see how to
[2:17:33] repent because David here lines us up in
[2:17:36] the scripture of how to truly
[2:17:40] repent and he says have mercy on me oh
[2:17:44] God according to thy loving
[2:17:46] kindness according to the multitude of
[2:17:49] thy Tender Mercies blot out my
[2:17:52] transgressions now he's not asking for
[2:17:56] justice he is asking for
[2:17:59] Mercy you know he said blot out my
[2:18:03] transgressions and then he says in verse
[2:18:05] two Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity
[2:18:08] and cleanse me from my sin for I
[2:18:11] acknowledge my transgression and my sin
[2:18:13] is ever before
[2:18:16] me here's David I'm wrong I need a
[2:18:20] savior
[2:18:21] I need Mercy I'm not asking for justice
[2:18:24] am I'm not getting for what I deserve I
[2:18:27] deserve to go to
[2:18:29] hell well if that woman hadn't went out
[2:18:32] and washed that
[2:18:34] day if she hadn't if she hadn't if she
[2:18:38] hadn't David is not blaming anybody else
[2:18:42] he is looking right here and he's saying
[2:18:44] have mercy on me oh God according to
[2:18:47] your loving kindness amen according the
[2:18:51] multitude of your Tender Mercies Blood
[2:18:54] Out My transgressions Wash Me thoroughly
[2:18:57] from my iniquity cleans me from my
[2:19:00] sin for I acknowledge my transgression
[2:19:03] and my sin is ever before me I realize
[2:19:07] I'm
[2:19:10] wrong there no more covering it up he

[2:25:38] that the bones which thou has broken May
[2:25:41] Rejoice hide thy face from my sin and
[2:25:44] blood out all my iniquities create in me
[2:25:48] a clean heart oh God
[2:25:51] renew a right Spirit In
[2:25:53] Me cast me not away from thy presence
[2:25:57] and take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[2:26:00] what watch now I I want you to see
[2:26:02] something I want you to see something
[2:26:04] here now first of all remember David's
[2:26:07] not converted David don't have the Holy
[2:26:12] Ghost but when he says take not the Holy
[2:26:15] Spirit from me he's remembering
[2:26:18] sa amen
[2:26:20] because when Saul departed from the
[2:26:23] things of God an evil spirit
[2:26:26] came to torment
[2:26:29] him and David knew the madness the
[2:26:33] insanity the hatred come on David knew
[2:26:37] all of these things that pled Saul and
[2:26:40] drove him into in into to hate and Des
[2:26:44] spies and kill and murder
[2:26:50] and David said God don't take your
[2:26:53] anointing off of my
[2:26:55] life I don't want to turn out to be like
[2:27:00] Saul Saul would not repent Saul would
[2:27:03] blame others Paul Saul would not would
[2:27:07] would not admit his wrong he he
[2:27:09] continued right on and and what was it
[2:27:11] an evil spirit came from the presence of
[2:27:14] God another God whether God allowed an
[2:27:17] evil spirit to come and torment the man
[2:27:32] and do you know even that's God's
[2:27:37] mercy stop for a minute even Saul was a
[2:27:41] predestinated
[2:27:45] seed but he couldn't do
[2:27:48] right because without Christ
[2:27:51] without the Holy Ghost he couldn't live
[2:27:55] it are you keying
[2:27:58] in so Saul David knew now watch I mean
[2:28:02] Saul Saul would would go and and he
[2:28:05] would see Samuel come up that old
[2:28:07] prophet and he would come up and he said
[2:28:09] this day you'll be with
[2:28:12] me so it showed that he was he was even
[2:28:15] a saved man would be gathered with
[2:28:17] Samuel and and and and the seed of
[2:28:20] Abraham in the bosom of Abraham he was a
[2:28:23] predestinated seed but you see the
[2:28:25] spirit wasn't given yet to make that
[2:28:28] seed do right he didn't have the water
[2:28:32] of the spirit to germinate
[2:28:35] it and so he says clean create in me a
[2:28:39] clean heart renew a right Spirit In Me
[2:28:42] cast me not away from thy presence take
[2:28:44] not thy Holy Spirit from me restore to
[2:28:46] me the joy of thy
[2:28:49] salvation remember salvation isn't our
[2:28:51] own doing salvation is of the Lord thy
[2:28:58] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[2:29:01] spirit now I want you to get something
[2:29:03] here put up verse
[2:29:07] 16 God doesn't want worship from a
[2:29:11] sinner he wants

[2:31:43] coming back he said I've been a sinner
[2:31:46] right I'm
[2:31:48] wrong I don't deserve anything you've
[2:31:51] got I don't deserve Heaven I don't

[2:31:57] deserve I'd go to hell but oh God how

[2:32:10] servant and God said no I I don't want
[2:32:13] you as a hired servant you're my son I

[2:32:50] amen the songwriter said the only time
[2:32:52] God Ran he didn't run from danger he
[2:32:56] didn't run from enemies he didn't run
[2:32:59] from calamities but I tell you that day
[2:33:02] when he saw his son and he saw him
[2:33:05] coming a long ways off amen that day he
[2:33:08] ran to him I tell you if you make a step
[2:33:12] towards God God will start ready toward
[2:33:15] you when the moment you say God I need
[2:33:18] you against
[2:33:20] and against thee only have I sined and I
[2:33:23] need a savior forgive me oh God I quit
[2:33:29] blaming I am what I am and I start
[2:33:32] saying Lord because I did
[2:33:37] this real Godly sorrow makes it where
[2:33:41] you'll make it right with the
[2:33:44] neighbors amen as brother Bram said we
[2:33:47] need an oldfashioned Revival that we
[2:33:50] used to have down the country where they
[2:33:51] lay on their face all night long not to
[2:33:54] carry on but a real Godly
[2:33:56] sorrow brother brandom in his holy ghost
[2:33:59] series he said now what we're going to
[2:34:01] do we're having this Holy Ghost Revival
[2:34:04] he had been he had been talking about it
[2:34:06] for months he was telling out in his
[2:34:07] campaigns I'm going back to my Baptist
[2:34:10] Tabernacle and I'm going to tell him you
[2:34:12] must receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:34:16] Ghost though you have believed though
[2:34:18] you were baptized you are adhering the
[2:34:20] doctrines that you were receiving truths
[2:34:23] you've got to get the Holy Ghost and he
[2:34:25] has a whole series that he
[2:34:28] preaches and he says I tell you what I
[2:34:30] want you to do said I tell you what I
[2:34:33] want you we're we're going to have homes
[2:34:35] open where people can come and pray
[2:34:38] we're going to have the church open
[2:34:40] where people come and pray we're going
[2:34:42] to have people ministers come and lay
[2:34:45] members come and those that are
[2:34:47] interested in other salvation and come
[2:34:49] and pray with him and it and if it takes
[2:34:52] he says all the way from and here I
[2:34:54] think it's the 15th of December all the
[2:34:57] way to New Years if it takes you that
[2:34:59] long to
[2:35:00] die die
[2:35:08] out and that's where the shortcomings
[2:35:10] coming even around the message we wanted
[2:35:13] just a quick fix a microwave Holy Ghost
[2:35:17] we just come to the Altar and have
[2:35:18] preachers pray for you you and go back
[2:35:20] and we're there and never change die
[2:35:22] out empty out look at your life and say
[2:35:27] oh God I must have a change and when you
[2:35:30] get desperate that's when God will meet
[2:35:32] you he will meet a desperate
[2:35:36] soul and he says oldfashioned Revival
[2:35:40] like we used to have down in the country
[2:35:41] where they lay on their face all night
[2:35:43] long not to carry on but when real Godly
[2:35:46] sorrow not go back to altar not not go
[2:35:49] back to to The Altar and and stay but
[2:35:51] get out go out then and make it right
[2:35:53] with the neighbors that they had made it
[2:35:55] wrong with get it straightened up that's
[2:35:58] right you know it's scorching but it's
[2:35:59] good it'll help you you know that my
[2:36:01] friend you see it brings a Godly sorrow
[2:36:04] and key to the door I believe repentance
[2:36:06] Godly sorrow means turn around repent
[2:36:09] means turn around go back you missed the
[2:36:11] mark start over again do that first and
[2:36:14] your baptism in water is only an outr
[2:36:17] profession of something that's been done
[2:36:19] the inside of you that you've accepted
[2:36:21] Christ as your savior you see this lack
[2:36:25] of
[2:36:25] repentance is what caused God to hate
[2:36:30] the worship in the days of
[2:36:32] Isaiah he said your sacrifices and your
[2:36:36] solemn Feast they are an Abomination to
[2:36:40] me they are a stench in my
[2:36:43] nostrils because you are coming without
[2:36:48] sincerity you're coming about tradition
[2:36:51] this is what we do it was a ritual or
[2:36:54] taking a you know a form of taking an
[2:36:57] animal for an offer never got anything
[2:36:59] out of it because he never put nothing
[2:37:01] in it yet he was obeying the commission
[2:37:03] of God by his word but he didn't come in
[2:37:05] the real meaning of his word he was
[2:37:07] obeying as far as fundamentally he
[2:37:09] obeyed but sincerely he didn't obey it
[2:37:12] therefore it was just a ritual following
[2:37:15] a
[2:37:16] tradition brother Bram told us he said
[2:37:18] you know
[2:37:20] he said I hadn't got anything against
[2:37:22] all the denomination but you're losing
[2:37:24] that sincerity that something should
[2:37:27] have in your worship and it just becomes
[2:37:30] a family
[2:37:31] tradition he goes and makes his offering
[2:37:33] of sin takes the communion just takes it
[2:37:36] anyway smoking drinking running with
[2:37:39] somebody else's wife women acting any
[2:37:41] way go take communion when you realize
[2:37:43] the Bible said if a man eats and drinks
[2:37:45] of this Blood unworthy he's guilty of
[2:37:48] the body and blood of the Lord we've
[2:37:49] lost the
[2:37:51] sincerity there's something wrong with
[2:37:56] us that's the way you approach
[2:38:00] God it isn't by approaching and say well
[2:38:02] I'll tell you what how did you say to
[2:38:05] dress how did you say where where where
[2:38:09] what parts can we wear jewelry on what
[2:38:12] what what what can we uh you know how
[2:38:14] long is
[2:38:17] long you know how do we dress what do we
[2:38:21] do how that's only
[2:38:25] conforming listen we had rules of the
[2:38:28] goat
[2:38:29] show when you went into the show ring
[2:38:32] you wore all right all
[2:38:35] white took your goats out and paraded it
[2:38:39] around but you were required a uniform I
[2:38:43] want you to know you can put on a
[2:38:45] uniform of a
[2:38:47] Believer and not be a believer
[2:38:50] and just be showing goats all
[2:38:53] around are you with me amen but let me
[2:38:56] tell you it isn't what you can put on
[2:38:59] it's what you receive in and then that
[2:39:02] starts living out it ain't a it ain't a
[2:39:06] black bird putting a peacock feathers in
[2:39:08] him and say I'm a peacock it's becoming
[2:39:11] born again the nature Chang and from the
[2:39:14] inside
[2:39:16] out comes a nature
[2:39:19] but when you see worldliness and sin and
[2:39:21] cutting hair and painting coming out
[2:39:23] against the word it shows the holy
[2:39:26] spirit is not
[2:39:28] there it's a direct
[2:39:31] evidence the spirit of God is
[2:39:35] missing I want you
[2:39:38] to come with me to close we're coming to
[2:39:41] communion
[2:39:47] now communion is a
[2:39:52] test in the
[2:39:54] Bible if a woman was accused of her
[2:40:01] husband of
[2:40:04] unfaithfulness he would take her before
[2:40:06] the
[2:40:07] priest and there would be a test of
[2:40:09] jealousy
[2:40:21] this woman would have to swear that she
[2:40:23] had not been
[2:40:25] unfaithful and then she would have to
[2:40:27] take water mixed with the dirt of the
[2:40:30] Holy
[2:40:32] place and eat
[2:40:35] it let loose her
[2:40:41] hair it was a test of
[2:40:45] jealousy and if she had done wrong
[2:40:49] it would swell in her
[2:40:58] belly if she had transgressed the marage
[2:41:02] Covenant it would show
[2:41:05] up when we come to communion it's a
[2:41:10] showdown it's not something to be taken
[2:41:14] flippantly but
[2:41:17] seriously my sins are of the
[2:41:21] blood things I've done wrong that
[2:41:24] bitterness brother Timothy preached
[2:41:27] about I went and straightened it
[2:41:30] up those things that's in my life little
[2:41:33] things I've left
[2:41:35] undone I'm coming now to the
[2:41:38] table because it's the test of
[2:41:41] jealousy if you've ate this bread and
[2:41:45] drink of this cup
[2:41:47] unworthily you eat and drink damnation
[2:41:50] to
[2:41:52] yourself because you didn't discern we
[2:41:55] wasn't playing
[2:41:56] Church you didn't discern this was the
[2:41:59] Lord's
[2:42:00] body and you've been
[2:42:04] lying and because of
[2:42:07] this Paul said many are sick and weakly
[2:42:12] among you and some even are dead
[2:42:19] because you didn't
[2:42:22] recognize the sincerity of this
[2:42:27] moment we're going to be coming to the
[2:42:29] table of the
[2:42:31] Lord and

[2:43:25] you I know I could be eating and
[2:43:28] drinking damnation to
[2:43:31] myself cuz I didn't
[2:43:33] discern this is the Lord's

[2:44:38] right no more do you act like the pig
[2:44:40] you once lived the life you once lived
[2:44:43] in the
[2:44:44] flesh now you will live it by the faith
[2:44:47] of the son of God
