[19:49] covetous lord seem like it's off the
[19:52] leash and has taken
[19:54] many of the believers
[19:56] from this dimension to the next but
[19:58] father we know that's only a portal by
[20:00] which you chose to use a call of
[20:02] believer home
[20:03] and we're just asking father that those
[20:05] that were left behind the family members
[20:09] of friends the churches that those lives

[20:26] course and never denied the faith no
[20:29] matter what the hand that was the dealt
[20:31] her father she remained faithful to the
[20:34] call and no doubt many of these other
[20:36] believers as well lord as they would
[20:38] cross this dimension to the other they
[20:40] they remained steadfast because they had
[20:42] met the god of yesterday and he was the
[20:45] god for them today and you're going to
[20:47] be the god for those left behind
[20:48] tomorrow so father i'm asking today that

[22:15] this morning that we can see you in a
[22:17] whole new way father may our eyes become
[22:19] open to this lord to the rim of the
[22:21] supernatural this morning father may you

[52:03] very very special way today
[52:05] i want just to remind you we have our
[52:07] meetings that are coming up and there is
[52:09] um
[52:10] brother daryl was telling me a little
[52:12] meeting after the church for the ladies
[52:14] there to kind of in preparation for that
[52:16] is you know we try to
[52:18] provide some sack lunches and things for
[52:20] the people knowing that there's not a
[52:23] lot of restaurants to go especially when
[52:26] we have church
[52:27] because uh we get out kind of late
[52:29] sometimes
[52:31] and so um rather than sending the people
[52:33] away hungry well we try to provide a
[52:36] little something so they'll be talking
[52:37] about that and and uh got to brother ron
[52:40] spencer brother donnie reagan brother
[52:43] wayne lawson going to come for those
[52:45] just the weekend before that but the
[52:46] david mayer will be here from
[52:48] switzerland
[52:49] and minister to us again and
[52:52] you'll be blessed by that and so we have
[52:55] some wonderful things that just lay
[52:57] right ahead for us in the month of
[52:59] october
[53:00] and a lot of things to look forward to
[53:03] amen and uh
[53:05] well all of his goodness ain't laying
[53:07] the next month we still got some in this
[53:10] amen and even for today
[53:12] amen revelation chapter 3 verse 14 we're
[53:16] going to
[53:17] turn to the scripture to the very place
[53:21] where we are at today
[53:23] now i want you to remember when when we
[53:25] read about the church ages when god
[53:28] would
[53:28] um address each age
[53:32] jesus would address both the true
[53:35] and the false vine
[53:38] so
[53:38] you know
[53:39] in in there when you say well i'm i'm
[53:41] not a laodicean well that is true in the
[53:45] sense that we're not the lukewarm former
[53:48] former powerless
[53:49] uh ones that that are have been christ
[53:52] rejectors
[53:54] but we are those ones that have received
[53:57] i salve and from the seventh angel's
[53:59] message and uh
[54:01] we
[54:02] the shame of our nakedness has been
[54:05] covered by the robe of his righteousness
[54:09] and you know um all of the all of the
[54:12] things and we are the ones that have
[54:13] been granted to sit with him and
[54:17] on his throne so we're here in this
[54:20] fulfillment of scripture today and we're
[54:22] going to look at this together
[54:24] as he
[54:25] addressed both the true and the false
[54:28] vine
[54:29] and
[54:30] so revelation 3 14 and to the angel
[54:34] of the church of the laodiceans write
[54:38] these things sayeth the amen this is
[54:40] going to be the final say god's going to
[54:43] put an amen
[54:45] on all the other messages down to the
[54:47] ages
[54:49] and so this is his final voice that will
[54:51] come to the final age
[54:54] these things saith the amen the faithful
[54:56] and true witness and we would see god do
[54:59] that
[55:00] time after time when when he would put
[55:03] an amen
[55:04] to a prophet when he'd bring a message
[55:07] and then he would be a faithful and true
[55:09] witness
[55:10] telling exactly who they were where they
[55:13] come from everything with a way with
[55:16] very detailed um
[55:19] insight into their lives is a word
[55:21] discern the thoughts in the intents of
[55:23] the heart so he's a faithful and true
[55:26] witness
[55:27] and the beginning of the creation of god
[55:31] and so as we this is of course the
[55:34] revelation of deity because he is the
[55:37] beginner of a new creation
[55:41] i know thy works that thou art neither
[55:44] cold nor hot i would that thou were cold
[55:47] or hot
[55:48] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[55:52] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[55:54] out of my mouth
[55:55] because i says i am rich and increase
[55:58] with goods and have need of nothing and
[56:00] no not that thou are wretched and
[56:03] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[56:06] i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in
[56:09] the fire that thou mayest be rich in
[56:11] white raiment that thou mayest be
[56:14] clothed and that the shame of thy
[56:16] nakedness do not appear
[56:18] and anoint thine eyes with eyes out that
[56:20] thou may see
[56:22] as many as i love sounds like he's going
[56:25] to love somebody in this age
[56:27] amen
[56:29] so it's not just to the false vine that
[56:31] he is speaking to as many as i love
[56:34] i rebuke and chasten
[56:38] and then he gives an admonition be
[56:40] zealous therefore and repent this is
[56:43] very very important
[56:45] because
[56:47] you must have the ability to repent
[56:51] every time that you're faced with the
[56:53] word
[56:55] you must
[56:56] change your mind
[56:59] no matter what you think about things no
[57:01] matter what the world is saying about it
[57:04] you have to change your mind
[57:07] and and have a complete
[57:09] a complete mind change
[57:12] a paradigm shift
[57:14] amen to take what the word says over
[57:17] what you even
[57:19] believe to be the truth
[57:21] even what you see or hear around you
[57:25] that is supposed to be the truth you
[57:27] take what the word said now notice
[57:29] i i be zealous therefore and repent this
[57:32] is my attitude every time i listen to a
[57:34] tape every time i read a book every time
[57:36] i read a scripture
[57:37] this is my attitude i i'm looking at
[57:40] that not to change the word
[57:42] but to be changed by the word
[57:45] now behold i stand at the door and knock
[57:48] if any man hear my voice and open the
[57:51] door i will come into him and will sup
[57:54] with him and he with me
[57:57] to him that overcometh so there's going
[58:00] to be somebody overcome
[58:03] the laodicean
[58:04] lukewarm spirit christ rejecting spirit
[58:09] to him that overcometh
[58:11] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[58:15] even as i also overcame and am sat down
[58:18] with my father in his strong
[58:21] and then he tells us somebody's going to
[58:23] hear what the spirit said
[58:27] it's not going to be a message not going
[58:28] to come and it'd be in vain
[58:31] somebody's going to hear it
[58:34] so he that an ear let him hear what the
[58:36] spirit saith unto the churches amen may
[58:40] god bless you as you're seated
[58:43] today
[58:44] i'm going to be laying some foundation
[58:46] in order to get to the thought that i
[58:49] want to bring but
[58:50] i'm going to be working toward this
[58:53] thought as we
[58:55] minister today on behold
[58:57] the word bride
[58:59] now so you know behold the word bright
[59:03] in other words even as he said behold
[59:05] the lamb of god to take away the sin of
[59:07] the world
[59:08] we're wanting now to
[59:10] look and see the form
[59:12] that christ is in today
[59:16] now there's a meeting in the air
[59:18] and we're not doing away without that's
[59:20] what believers believe we'll meet a
[59:22] physical
[59:23] lord jesus
[59:25] amen and we will meet him in the air
[59:28] that's what believers believe oh no the
[59:31] world won't see it or you know they
[59:33] won't see the saint of dead when they
[59:35] come forth they won't see this disappear
[59:37] and this is something only the elect
[59:40] will see will be caught up to meet him
[59:43] in the air
[59:44] now after that we'll come back with him
[59:48] after the three and a half years of of
[59:50] the great tribulation here upon the
[59:52] earth and the marriage supper in the of
[59:54] the lamb in heaven we'll come back with
[59:57] him this is revelation 19
[1:00:00] where that will return with him and
[1:00:02] there ever i will see him and every
[1:00:04] tongue will confess
[1:00:06] but you see
[1:00:07] you know as the church world
[1:00:10] 2000 years ago they were looking for the
[1:00:13] wrong coming
[1:00:15] and it blinded them as to what god was
[1:00:18] doing
[1:00:19] so it's very important that you keep
[1:00:21] your mind and your eyes and know what
[1:00:24] god is doing in our generation
[1:00:27] now this scripture that we have read
[1:00:29] defines our age well it foretells the
[1:00:32] condition
[1:00:34] of the last day church who is rich has
[1:00:37] got lots of goods but as at the same
[1:00:40] time as lukewarm
[1:00:42] unto unenthusiastic
[1:00:44] indifferent
[1:00:46] cool
[1:00:47] half-hearted
[1:00:48] lackadaisical unconcerned apathetic
[1:00:52] tepid uninterested impassive
[1:00:55] dispassionate emotionless passionless
[1:00:58] limp
[1:00:59] noncommittal unresponsive unmoved
[1:01:03] laid back and couldn't care less
[1:01:06] that's all what lukewarm means
[1:01:10] and this is a condition of the last day
[1:01:13] church
[1:01:15] now so and it's in it's her attitude
[1:01:19] toward the word of god
[1:01:21] and toward the spirit now when we say
[1:01:23] word
[1:01:24] we're not we want you to understand the
[1:01:26] word is not a book
[1:01:28] the word
[1:01:30] the word is not something even on tape
[1:01:33] the word is a person
[1:01:36] so therefore worship has to be in spirit
[1:01:39] and in truth it's not just word only or
[1:01:43] or knowledge only or
[1:01:45] intellectualism but it is in spirit as
[1:01:49] well
[1:01:50] so that is that again is the person so
[1:01:53] when we're talking about a word bride
[1:01:56] we're not talking about one that just
[1:01:58] simply is is a walking bible that just
[1:02:01] um quoting quotes
[1:02:03] and and and knows it has a bunch of
[1:02:05] knowledge we're talking about
[1:02:07] the the person of jesus christ
[1:02:11] manifested in a people
[1:02:13] now
[1:02:14] now as we look at the condition of this
[1:02:17] last day church who couldn't care less
[1:02:19] is unmoved laid back non-committal
[1:02:22] emotionless um impassive unconcerned
[1:02:26] half-hearted and you know he cannot let
[1:02:29] me just say it he cannot take
[1:02:32] this church
[1:02:34] for a bride
[1:02:38] she refuses to be washed by the water of
[1:02:41] the word she says i have needed nothing
[1:02:45] even her attitude toward god is you know
[1:02:47] i'm self-sufficient i've got what i need
[1:02:50] and god i don't need you
[1:02:53] now she you know so that's her
[1:02:56] assessment of herself
[1:02:59] so but he his assessment of her is that
[1:03:03] she is wretched
[1:03:04] miserable poor
[1:03:06] blind and naked
[1:03:09] in other words she is repulsive to him
[1:03:12] therefore she actually
[1:03:15] jesus until she is spewed out of his
[1:03:18] mouth
[1:03:20] now what does that mean you know um
[1:03:23] there there again what does it mean to
[1:03:26] be the mouth of god
[1:03:28] you know what does it mean to be in his
[1:03:30] mouth they in other words in the past
[1:03:33] the baptist the methodists the
[1:03:34] pentecostals the denominations they have
[1:03:37] spoke for him in their time
[1:03:41] but they will no longer this church will
[1:03:44] no longer be the voice that speaks for
[1:03:47] god because of their lukewarmness
[1:03:50] they are spewed out of the mouth of god
[1:03:54] meaning they are no longer the
[1:03:55] instrument that he speaks through as
[1:03:58] brother branham said in the laodicean
[1:04:00] church age in the dark ages the word was
[1:04:02] almost entirely lost to the people but
[1:04:05] god sent luther with the word and the
[1:04:07] lutheran spoke for god at that time
[1:04:10] and they organized and again the pure
[1:04:12] word was lost for organizational tens
[1:04:16] toward dogma and creeds and not simple
[1:04:18] word
[1:04:19] and they could no longer speak for god
[1:04:21] then god sent wesley and he was the
[1:04:23] voice with the word in his day and the
[1:04:26] people who took his revelation
[1:04:28] from god um became living epistles read
[1:04:32] and known of all men for their
[1:04:34] generation and when the methodist failed
[1:04:36] god raised up others
[1:04:38] and so has it gone on through the years
[1:04:41] what's now until this one this last day
[1:04:44] there is another people in the land
[1:04:48] who under their messenger will be the
[1:04:50] final voice to the final age
[1:04:53] god's still going to have a voice
[1:04:55] no matter whether the church has
[1:04:57] rejected him no matter whether their
[1:04:59] church has failed him
[1:05:01] no matter whether church has been is now
[1:05:04] repulsive to him to they're no longer
[1:05:06] his voice
[1:05:08] god will have a voice in this end time
[1:05:11] who under their messenger will be the
[1:05:14] final voice to the final age
[1:05:17] now because of the rejection of the
[1:05:20] voice of god or the word of god
[1:05:22] that has opened up the book to us
[1:05:26] understand it had to be first rejected
[1:05:30] by the denominational system
[1:05:32] in order for god to call a bride out
[1:05:34] from among them so you see the the
[1:05:37] denominations were judged and rejected
[1:05:40] just like vasta in the book of esther
[1:05:42] the church has had her own feast to
[1:05:45] which god is not wanted nor invited
[1:05:48] and this is the problem that we are
[1:05:50] seeing today across the land even in
[1:05:53] many message churches god isn't wanted
[1:05:56] and he isn't invited
[1:05:59] they don't want his holy spirit
[1:06:01] they don't want his gifts
[1:06:03] they don't want his miracles
[1:06:05] they don't want anything but their
[1:06:07] little creeds and their dogmas of man
[1:06:09] and some little hierarchy you know some
[1:06:12] self-made pope sitting standing in the
[1:06:14] pulpit somewhere with a personality cult
[1:06:17] fallen but god says that nauseates him
[1:06:21] they become lukewarm formal and cold and
[1:06:25] powerless
[1:06:27] this is something that we should be
[1:06:28] praying all the time god whatever don't
[1:06:31] let me get in that laxadaisical lukewarm
[1:06:36] unconcerned condition
[1:06:38] let me be one thing on fire for god as
[1:06:41] brother branham would say and i quote
[1:06:43] him he said this bride by no means will
[1:06:46] be a layover to see
[1:06:47] she will be on fire for god
[1:06:51] amen and i'll tell you if you don't have
[1:06:53] a fire it's time for you to get your
[1:06:54] fire
[1:06:58] lit you know i was just hearing today
[1:07:01] about a revival that has been going on
[1:07:04] in uganda and they have been baptizing
[1:07:07] tens of thousands who are now embracing
[1:07:10] the message
[1:07:12] and and of course there is signs and
[1:07:14] wonders and even the dead has been
[1:07:16] raised among them great things has
[1:07:18] happened but i i i just want to just say
[1:07:21] even though we rejoice in many being
[1:07:24] baptized
[1:07:25] that's only the first step
[1:07:28] amen oh god don't let them stop there
[1:07:31] let the let the ugandans and all the
[1:07:34] world say i've been baptized and i
[1:07:36] believed on the lord and i received his
[1:07:39] word but i've got to receive him i've
[1:07:41] got to have the person of the holy ghost
[1:07:44] in my life
[1:07:45] that ought to be the ring and that is
[1:07:48] ringing out an evening like tabernacle
[1:07:50] today i've been baptized i've been taken
[1:07:53] on his name i've embraced the message
[1:07:55] but i gotta have him in my life
[1:07:58] that personal experience
[1:08:01] the baptism of the holy ghost that puts
[1:08:03] a fire on the inside of me
[1:08:06] that trials can put out
[1:08:08] amen the troubles can't put out
[1:08:11] amen that that that the rejecters cannot
[1:08:14] put a cold blanket on
[1:08:16] amen but something that causes me to
[1:08:18] have a passion for god and a passion for
[1:08:22] his word amen now brother brethren would
[1:08:26] tell us in the indictment he said that
[1:08:28] christ is god's provided lamb
[1:08:31] notice how appropriate was showing that
[1:08:34] jerusalem was ceasing now we're going to
[1:08:36] be doing some comparing here in a moment
[1:08:39] ago with the last could we call it
[1:08:41] church age or the last church group
[1:08:44] there in jesus day
[1:08:46] and then this last age that we're in
[1:08:50] because both of them are christ's
[1:08:51] rejecters
[1:08:57] both of them are christ rejected like i
[1:08:59] said people are worried about covet
[1:09:01] vaccine that ain't the thing to worry
[1:09:02] about
[1:09:04] the thing to worry about is getting that
[1:09:05] seal of god in your life
[1:09:08] to turn down the seal of god is to take
[1:09:10] the mark of the beast
[1:09:12] i'm more concerned about people being
[1:09:14] cold and formal and powerless
[1:09:19] without a passion without a zeal
[1:09:22] in my way there's no response to the
[1:09:25] word the dead is 12 o'clock midnight
[1:09:27] their experiences something that
[1:09:29] happened 15 20 years ago and their musk
[1:09:33] back
[1:09:35] like an old turtle there that you know
[1:09:37] just been in there so long until mosses
[1:09:39] growed all over him
[1:09:41] they ain't moved in years
[1:09:44] i'm telling you they're in backslidden
[1:09:46] condition that's not a rapture-ready
[1:09:48] church
[1:09:50] amen a church that is going in a rapture
[1:09:52] is a people that on fire for god they
[1:09:55] got a passion they got a zeal
[1:09:58] to know the truth to change their lives
[1:10:00] together they're zealous to repent
[1:10:07] now
[1:10:08] crisis
[1:10:09] he said it was that
[1:10:11] he talks about how appropriate was
[1:10:13] showing now that jerusalem was ceased
[1:10:16] now we've got to
[1:10:18] every denomination has made their own
[1:10:21] group
[1:10:22] the jerusalem here's where everybody's
[1:10:24] got to come due to worship
[1:10:27] every one of these little cultists
[1:10:29] movements in the message they make their
[1:10:31] own little group the jerusalem
[1:10:34] and jerusalem he said was ceasing
[1:10:37] when it was effect it was in effect
[1:10:40] until that hour the blood of the lamb
[1:10:42] was that's the woolly lamb was all right
[1:10:45] until that day but now at the
[1:10:47] crucifixion it changes
[1:10:50] the old system is done there was a new
[1:10:52] one and the lamb was at the sacrifice
[1:10:54] the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds
[1:10:57] and they were condemning and doing the
[1:10:59] very things there that they had to do
[1:11:02] that's right and he says god be blessed
[1:11:05] for seeing this wonderful heavenly light
[1:11:07] in this last day because the churches is
[1:11:10] doing the same thing until the hour that
[1:11:14] organization religion is condemned and
[1:11:17] proved
[1:11:18] to be sacrificing christ's words and
[1:11:21] from then on comes the word and the word
[1:11:24] only
[1:11:26] not a philosophy not our intellectual
[1:11:29] learning so where
[1:11:32] amen the word
[1:11:34] and the word only from that old paschal
[1:11:36] lamb passed away and that christ become
[1:11:38] our lamb at the day of crucifixion and
[1:11:41] today that denominations crucified the
[1:11:44] word of god and accepted a creed instead
[1:11:47] of the word of god that's the day the
[1:11:50] word come into full effect
[1:11:52] and he says that's just been done
[1:11:54] recently
[1:11:56] and of course you know that was all
[1:11:57] because it opened up the seven seals
[1:12:00] now the rejection of the church
[1:12:03] was necessary for a bride to be called
[1:12:05] out from among them
[1:12:07] again the rejection of vasti
[1:12:10] you know was necessary for esther to
[1:12:12] come on the scene
[1:12:14] now before a kingdom before a new
[1:12:17] kingdom can come in the religious system
[1:12:21] of the day has to be terminated
[1:12:24] in other words you know god can't deal
[1:12:27] with both of them
[1:12:29] so you know before another kingdom can
[1:12:32] come in where god is a king and he has
[1:12:34] the preeminence
[1:12:36] then the religious systems of the day
[1:12:38] has to be terminated the coming of the
[1:12:41] kingdom
[1:12:42] terminates the religious systems of that
[1:12:45] day now remember what is the kingdom it
[1:12:48] is not meat and drink
[1:12:50] right
[1:12:51] amen but but what is it it's the holy
[1:12:54] ghost
[1:12:56] that's exactly what the kingdom of god
[1:12:58] is it is the holy ghost so the coming
[1:13:00] again of the holy ghost
[1:13:03] pouring out of the spirit in this last
[1:13:06] days
[1:13:07] to make this a wheat seed
[1:13:10] mature grain bride
[1:13:13] amen it comes into to and it terminates
[1:13:17] it brings a termination to the religious
[1:13:21] systems of the day just think about it
[1:13:23] before a president can come in there has
[1:13:25] to be an ending or going out of the form
[1:13:27] of administration
[1:13:30] amen now jesus foretold the ending of
[1:13:33] the of the
[1:13:35] of that present kingdom of israel when
[1:13:38] he was there he would tell them exactly
[1:13:41] your kingdom this kingdom is coming to
[1:13:43] an end
[1:13:44] your system of worship
[1:13:46] is coming to an end
[1:13:48] the whole thing you say right now to the
[1:13:50] woman at the well he said right now he
[1:13:53] said all men go to worship at jerusalem
[1:13:57] amen this is where you're to worship but
[1:14:00] he said that time is coming
[1:14:02] and now is that day that worship the
[1:14:04] father must worship him in what
[1:14:07] spirit and truth
[1:14:09] so so again he was telling them there
[1:14:12] was even a
[1:14:13] new order of worship
[1:14:16] and that the old worship and the old
[1:14:18] lamb and the old way of doing thing and
[1:14:21] the old place to find the mercy would
[1:14:23] now be changed
[1:14:26] the other made obsolete
[1:14:29] now if you'll turn with me to matthew 23
[1:14:31] 37 he would look at jerusalem now
[1:14:34] jerusalem represents it's there where
[1:14:36] the temple is and it's representing now
[1:14:39] the very headquarters are very the the
[1:14:42] very headquarters of that religion
[1:14:45] and he says oh jerusalem jerusalem thou
[1:14:47] that kill us the prophets stone us them
[1:14:50] which are sin unto thee how often would
[1:14:52] i have gathered my thy children together
[1:14:55] even as a hand gathered their chickens
[1:14:57] and their wings and you would not behold
[1:15:00] your house is left unto you desolate
[1:15:05] for i say to you you will not see me
[1:15:07] henceforth till you shall see blessed is
[1:15:10] he that cometh in the name of the lord
[1:15:12] so here he is saying you israel
[1:15:15] you know there is a change that is
[1:15:16] happening
[1:15:18] and you i'm coming to your house and
[1:15:21] you'll not see me no more
[1:15:24] until until you will till i come with
[1:15:28] ten thousands of the saints and you will
[1:15:30] look on him to in revelation was it one
[1:15:33] eighth where that look upon him that
[1:15:35] thou is pierce and mourn is one as
[1:15:38] mourning for his only son
[1:15:40] so now from on now on comes blindness
[1:15:45] and the darkness begins to hover over
[1:15:48] the temple of god and jesus is declaring
[1:15:52] you are rejected
[1:15:55] for you israel your light has turned to
[1:15:58] darkness
[1:15:59] the veil was rent
[1:16:02] showing god wasn't there
[1:16:06] come on there was no pillar of fire
[1:16:08] there
[1:16:09] no shekinah glory there god had left the
[1:16:12] system
[1:16:13] and there he was the new lamb the true
[1:16:17] lamb hanging on a cross the one they had
[1:16:21] rejected
[1:16:25] now
[1:16:27] i wonder how many churches
[1:16:30] including some message churches or
[1:16:32] houses left desolate
[1:16:35] now when jesus leaves this temple
[1:16:38] he comes he departs from there to return
[1:16:40] no more let me tell you when god leaves
[1:16:42] a place
[1:16:45] that's serious
[1:16:46] when god leaves a home
[1:16:50] amen come on now when god leaves a
[1:16:52] marriage
[1:16:55] some people don't want god in their
[1:16:56] marriage
[1:16:58] amen yeah yeah you know a lot of times
[1:17:00] we have a man wanting the woman to be
[1:17:02] subjected to him but what about him
[1:17:03] being subjected to the word
[1:17:06] what about him be a real example of a
[1:17:08] real christian and a real leader in the
[1:17:10] home and a real father
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:14] come on
[1:17:15] amen you know but when god leaves a home
[1:17:18] that house is left desolate
[1:17:20] when god leaves a church
[1:17:24] that church is left desolate
[1:17:27] so that's why it's important that god
[1:17:29] never leaves us
[1:17:32] amen we should everyone strive to ever
[1:17:35] serve us get in the spirit
[1:17:38] amen uh preaching is no good it is even
[1:17:41] is it even it is not even preaching
[1:17:44] without the spirit
[1:17:46] the anointing has to be there
[1:17:48] a lot of people think you know that they
[1:17:50] can
[1:17:51] they can just get up and and talk a
[1:17:53] little sermon and give a little thought
[1:17:55] and that's preaching that ain't
[1:17:56] preaching
[1:17:58] amen it takes the anointing of god to
[1:18:01] preach
[1:18:03] and that's not a intellectual you say
[1:18:05] well it ain't screaming and shouting
[1:18:07] well i'll tell you what it ain't in
[1:18:08] lectures either
[1:18:12] sure i've seen men screaming shouting
[1:18:14] not a lick of anointing but i've seen
[1:18:16] i've seen too much of this in this day
[1:18:18] just getting up with a formal talk
[1:18:21] never get in the spirit of god never
[1:18:23] find the anointing
[1:18:26] it's the anointing that breaks the yoke
[1:18:28] every minister should seek that
[1:18:30] anointing every church member should
[1:18:33] seek that anointing you ought to come in
[1:18:35] every service lord whatever let me come
[1:18:38] under your anointing
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:42] amen but when god leaves a place or home
[1:18:44] or church or religious system it is
[1:18:47] desolate and there's no desolation like
[1:18:50] that desolation
[1:18:56] jesus says concerning concerning the
[1:18:58] temple
[1:18:59] your house
[1:19:01] is no longer my house
[1:19:04] it's left desolate i'm leaving it
[1:19:09] desolate means solitary
[1:19:12] lonely
[1:19:13] uninhabited
[1:19:14] deserted
[1:19:16] deprived
[1:19:17] of aid and protection is like a flock
[1:19:20] deserted by a shepherd of a woman
[1:19:22] neglected by her husband
[1:19:24] or from whom the husband withholds
[1:19:26] himself
[1:19:28] you see
[1:19:29] this is a condition of desolation
[1:19:31] and when that happens
[1:19:33] she no longer brings for children
[1:19:36] there's no more births in the church
[1:19:38] or i'm not talking about additions
[1:19:41] because we dedicate them at an altar
[1:19:46] i i'm not talking about additions
[1:19:48] because we baptize them in a pool
[1:19:50] i'm talking about births
[1:19:53] where there's a dine out to sin
[1:19:55] and
[1:19:56] men and women are born again by the
[1:19:58] spirit of god filled with the holy ghost
[1:20:01] amen so you see you know with the church
[1:20:05] he withdraws himself from her she'll
[1:20:08] never no longer bear a seed of his
[1:20:12] she'll never no more have a child born
[1:20:14] in her in her movement
[1:20:16] that is fired by him
[1:20:19] he no longer will be her husband
[1:20:22] he no longer will be her caregiver
[1:20:28] what happens to church when god says
[1:20:31] your your lukewarmness nauseates me
[1:20:35] this church is no longer my church
[1:20:38] god puts her away
[1:20:41] you see israel was the woman that god
[1:20:43] had entered into covenant with
[1:20:45] this happened on mount sinai when he
[1:20:47] gave the law
[1:20:49] and god entered into covenant with them
[1:20:51] he would he would address her with
[1:20:54] through jeremiah ezekiel hosea as his
[1:20:56] wife and then he would tell she's going
[1:20:58] to whoring
[1:21:00] she's become a prostitute
[1:21:03] and then of course you see you say
[1:21:05] brother tim but that that's a that was
[1:21:07] israel back there but that's the problem
[1:21:09] with the last day people
[1:21:11] that all call themselves christians but
[1:21:14] according to the bible there are they
[1:21:16] are prostitutes and harlots the great
[1:21:21] and her daughters
[1:21:23] and there's a reason they're called that
[1:21:25] because they rejected his headship
[1:21:29] they don't want his children
[1:21:31] and that's what brother branham told us
[1:21:32] that in the invisible union he said
[1:21:35] there's some people coming together
[1:21:36] whether the invisible union and god is
[1:21:39] uniting and there's a marriage that is
[1:21:41] going on but there are others that have
[1:21:44] rejected him they don't want his
[1:21:46] children
[1:21:47] they don't want acts 2 38 blabbering
[1:21:49] streaming's yelling the youngins they
[1:21:51] don't want none of them but he said
[1:21:53] that's the only kind the word can bring
[1:21:55] forth
[1:21:59] now
[1:21:59] in marriage and divorce brother branham
[1:22:01] gets pretty plain and he you know he's
[1:22:04] talking about marriage and relationships
[1:22:06] and so on and he says now he can put her
[1:22:09] away but she cannot put him away
[1:22:12] he did it and proved it in the days when
[1:22:14] luther wesley pentecost when they have
[1:22:17] refused to become a further part of him
[1:22:19] by having a spiritual sexual affair to
[1:22:22] become pregnated with further part of
[1:22:24] the word you understand she refused
[1:22:27] the lutheran church refused for christ
[1:22:30] to have any more desire with her luther
[1:22:32] refused it and you're let me say this
[1:22:34] you're going to call me something anyhow
[1:22:36] so it is today with every one of them
[1:22:38] they fail to take that word they refuse
[1:22:42] christ
[1:22:43] and any woman that refuses a man is
[1:22:46] child has no right to be a wife to him
[1:22:48] amen remember in the bible when when the
[1:22:50] king married esther because the queen
[1:22:53] refused he just got him another one what
[1:22:55] happened when she refused to come out
[1:22:57] with the king and obey him the same
[1:23:00] thing it is with a woman that refuses to
[1:23:02] be a wife to her husband
[1:23:05] now
[1:23:06] this is very important i i don't want
[1:23:08] you to go sideways on this
[1:23:10] because there's a lot of problems in
[1:23:12] marriages today
[1:23:14] and and you say well brother tim that
[1:23:16] just fit our situation but let me tell
[1:23:18] you something i just wonder have you
[1:23:20] been treating that woman like a queen
[1:23:23] have you really been a prince in your
[1:23:25] home
[1:23:27] is there really some godly leadership is
[1:23:29] the love
[1:23:31] that that you owe
[1:23:33] being given
[1:23:37] i could i
[1:23:39] i could say a lot of things right here
[1:23:41] but it's a mixed crowd
[1:23:43] but i just want you to understand this
[1:23:44] ain't a one-way street
[1:23:47] you see
[1:23:48] now again but the church let's get our
[1:23:50] thoughts back on the church this is the
[1:23:52] church she has she has refused
[1:23:55] him
[1:23:57] and refused his child
[1:24:00] she didn't want him
[1:24:02] she didn't want his births
[1:24:06] she didn't want his spirit
[1:24:08] she don't want his worship come on
[1:24:11] this is the condition of the last day
[1:24:14] church
[1:24:15] now
[1:24:16] i'm trying to get this to you because
[1:24:18] there is a reason that god put them away
[1:24:22] and is called you
[1:24:28] understand there is a reason god's done
[1:24:31] what he's done in this day
[1:24:33] amen because there the church has become
[1:24:36] a christ rejecter
[1:24:40] a man crucify him again
[1:24:42] put his put him to an open shame
[1:24:44] rejected his word rejects his headship
[1:24:47] rejects his leadership
[1:24:49] come on
[1:24:50] amen don't want it don't want his spirit
[1:24:53] in their midst
[1:24:54] refuses his word
[1:24:57] now look here at israel now in jerusalem
[1:25:00] now it's 70 years
[1:25:03] 70 years before jerusalem is actually
[1:25:06] destroyed
[1:25:08] but god is already saying you're
[1:25:09] finished
[1:25:13] now you went there the next day there's
[1:25:15] no more there's no changes
[1:25:17] they're still bringing sacrifices
[1:25:19] they're still offering animals they're
[1:25:21] still you know do all the rituals
[1:25:24] everything else it looks like
[1:25:25] everything's going on just like normal
[1:25:29] and you're saying to me brother tim
[1:25:31] you're you're you're declaring that god
[1:25:33] has rejected the denominational system
[1:25:36] and they keep on and they're growing and
[1:25:38] they got more members and they're
[1:25:39] getting bigger and they got more money
[1:25:41] and they got more programs and all of
[1:25:43] this when god said it's finished
[1:25:46] it's over
[1:25:48] and it's 70 years before it's destroyed
[1:25:50] but god has already declared judgment on
[1:25:53] them
[1:25:54] and the church went on with their
[1:25:56] ceremonies and went to the same altar
[1:25:58] and offered the same sacrifice
[1:26:01] but at the day of crucifixion from then
[1:26:04] on their offerings was no longer
[1:26:08] accepted
[1:26:10] the same offers abraham gave
[1:26:13] the same offerings that isaac offered
[1:26:16] the same offerings that samuel would
[1:26:18] offer
[1:26:19] the same offerings that jeremiah ezekiel
[1:26:22] priest right down to the ages we would
[1:26:25] all offer now
[1:26:27] and let me tell you it brought salvation
[1:26:30] to that time
[1:26:32] it brought a blood cleansing
[1:26:34] but all of a sudden it changes
[1:26:39] and now you can offer the same thing
[1:26:42] your granddaddy offered
[1:26:44] go to the same altar your granddaddy
[1:26:46] went to
[1:26:47] my mother went to this church and my
[1:26:49] grandfather and my great-grandpa
[1:26:51] you can go to the same place
[1:26:55] and find no mercy
[1:26:57] find nothing to save you from the
[1:26:59] judgment coming
[1:27:02] now so you see matthew 24 verse 1
[1:27:06] and jesus went out and departed from the
[1:27:10] temple now he would depart from this
[1:27:13] temple
[1:27:14] never to return
[1:27:16] again his disciples came to him to show
[1:27:19] him the buildings of the temple and
[1:27:21] jesus said unto them see not all these
[1:27:23] things verily i say unto you there shall
[1:27:26] not be left here one stone upon another
[1:27:28] that shall not be thrown down
[1:27:30] he's speaking judgment
[1:27:34] now why would the jewish church in its
[1:27:37] temple
[1:27:38] have such an indictment and such a
[1:27:40] judgment
[1:27:42] because christ was spurned
[1:27:44] the
[1:27:45] sent
[1:27:47] the word made flesh
[1:27:49] rejected
[1:27:50] amen now no longer would they represent
[1:27:53] him
[1:27:54] there would never be another prophet
[1:27:58] that would rise up out of their movement
[1:28:00] their system
[1:28:01] there would never be they would no
[1:28:03] longer be god's voice
[1:28:05] although there was a long list of saints
[1:28:09] sages prophets that had come from her
[1:28:12] abraham great prophets david a prophet
[1:28:17] king you know on and on and on i say
[1:28:20] jeremiah and daniel and ezekiel and oh
[1:28:24] my prophet after prophet word afterward
[1:28:29] but now
[1:28:30] there would no more ever be another
[1:28:33] prophet come from them
[1:28:36] no longer would the voice of god ever
[1:28:38] speak through them
[1:28:41] they would no longer be god's
[1:28:43] represented representation
[1:28:46] amen because of the rejection of christ
[1:28:50] they too would become rejected
[1:28:54] now i want you to look with me to
[1:28:57] in psalms 69 20. let's get a picture of
[1:29:00] the rejected christ
[1:29:02] i hope i don't background too much so
[1:29:04] that i don't get into what i want to
[1:29:06] speak about
[1:29:08] but psalm 69 20.
[1:29:12] reproach has broken my heart
[1:29:15] and i'm full of heaviness
[1:29:17] i look for something to take pity but
[1:29:19] there is none for comforters and i found
[1:29:22] none
[1:29:23] they gave me also calls for my meat and
[1:29:26] in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
[1:29:28] drink
[1:29:30] left their table become a snare before
[1:29:33] them
[1:29:35] that
[1:29:36] and that which should have been for
[1:29:37] their welfare let it become a trap
[1:29:41] in other words the table that they ate
[1:29:43] from
[1:29:44] let the very things that they fed upon
[1:29:46] become a snare to them
[1:29:49] you know again you know that which
[1:29:51] should have been for their welfare if i
[1:29:53] understand right there when the romans
[1:29:56] did come in and destroy jerusalem they
[1:29:58] gathered all of the people into the
[1:30:00] temple and and every you know surely
[1:30:03] god's going to save us
[1:30:05] their little ones are children now all
[1:30:06] of them
[1:30:08] they gathered them all in there but i
[1:30:09] want you to know a word had came before
[1:30:13] that
[1:30:14] that it told them that jerusalem would
[1:30:16] be surrounded and they would lay
[1:30:19] trenches around her and when you see
[1:30:21] them start coming down and you flee from
[1:30:24] here
[1:30:25] let him that's on the housetop not go
[1:30:27] back and give anything in other words
[1:30:29] run
[1:30:30] get out of there
[1:30:32] flee i want you to understand that's
[1:30:36] been the voice that god used in this day
[1:30:39] right away get out
[1:30:41] get out of those systems
[1:30:43] get out of that lukewarmness get out of
[1:30:46] that that rebellion against god get out
[1:30:48] of that move that won't let god move
[1:30:51] get out
[1:30:57] because we see him surrounding
[1:31:00] we see the enemy surrounded and about to
[1:31:02] pull the church into the tribulation and
[1:31:06] the bible talks about the tribulation of
[1:31:08] those days he said never again would
[1:31:10] there be tribulation like upon one group
[1:31:13] of people like it was there and those
[1:31:15] jews went into not just a few days of
[1:31:18] tribulation they have been under
[1:31:20] persecution and tribulation now for 2
[1:31:23] 000 years
[1:31:26] why because they rejected their
[1:31:28] messiah and what will happen to the
[1:31:31] gentiles because of rejection the word
[1:31:33] for their day they will go to the
[1:31:35] tribulation
[1:31:38] but right now they're still there
[1:31:40] amen there's still an opportunity and to
[1:31:44] flee from there
[1:31:46] am i don't don't let your shirt hit your
[1:31:48] back get out
[1:31:50] move
[1:31:51] run
[1:31:52] get into the word flee into christ
[1:31:57] you know people fled from california it
[1:31:59] wasn't california to run from it was
[1:32:02] getting to christ
[1:32:06] what difference does it make if you go
[1:32:08] down in the in the in
[1:32:10] you know in the the waves of the sea or
[1:32:13] whatever else if your soul is right with
[1:32:15] god
[1:32:18] let the table let let the very things
[1:32:21] that they've been eating from let the
[1:32:23] very words that they've been taken for
[1:32:25] themselves condemn them
[1:32:30] let the very bible that they hold to be
[1:32:32] true
[1:32:33] judge them
[1:32:36] and that would should have been for
[1:32:38] their welfare let it be a strap
[1:32:41] let their eyes be darkened if that's not
[1:32:43] prophesied again of the last day what is
[1:32:46] let their eyes be darkened that they see
[1:32:48] not let their loins continually to shake
[1:32:50] pour out that indignation upon them let
[1:32:53] thy wrathful anger take a hold of them
[1:32:55] let their habitation be desolate amen
[1:33:01] and let none dwell in their tents
[1:33:04] for they persecute him whom thou is
[1:33:07] smitten and they talk to grief of those
[1:33:10] whom thou has wounded add an iniquity to
[1:33:13] their iniquity and let them not come
[1:33:16] into
[1:33:17] thy righteousness let them be blotted
[1:33:20] out
[1:33:21] of the book of the living and not be
[1:33:24] written with the righteous
[1:33:26] my goodness this is what happens to the
[1:33:28] christ rejecters
[1:33:30] this is what would happen to the
[1:33:32] pharisees sadducees the men of that day
[1:33:35] that were pious and religious and
[1:33:37] catholicism who could even sometimes you
[1:33:40] know prophesy and so on like that let it
[1:33:43] now become desolate
[1:33:45] let god no longer dwell in their tents
[1:33:49] let the spirit never move in there again
[1:33:52] and you talk about rejection
[1:33:54] now brother branham talks the same thing
[1:33:56] and and he tells us and know it not
[1:33:59] and he he looks there and he sees the
[1:34:01] condition of the church world and the
[1:34:04] condition they are and he says the
[1:34:06] higher that you rise in god the more
[1:34:08] sinful everything looks
[1:34:13] you know there again
[1:34:14] it depends on where you're at
[1:34:17] if you're you're on level with them
[1:34:19] you don't see the sin
[1:34:22] but you start moving higher in god you
[1:34:24] begin to see the things that are wrong
[1:34:28] amen the higher you rise in god the more
[1:34:31] sinful everything gets and he said
[1:34:33] sometimes in prayer you can imagine when
[1:34:35] the holy spirit takes you into a sphere
[1:34:38] then the whole thing looks chaos and
[1:34:40] then you come back and the people think
[1:34:41] you're a rascal or
[1:34:43] or sarcastic or you're full you stand
[1:34:46] out as a crank always rebuking the
[1:34:48] people but if you ever climb into those
[1:34:51] fears one time
[1:34:52] when you can be in the presence of god
[1:34:55] not through emotion but through genuine
[1:34:57] holy spirit lifting up the whole thing
[1:35:00] is wrote ichabod the glory of the lord
[1:35:03] has departed from the whole
[1:35:05] denominational outfit
[1:35:07] now this is what a prophet would look
[1:35:10] and he says i've been lifted up in the
[1:35:12] place and here in this place and the
[1:35:14] higher i get the more sinful that thing
[1:35:17] looks
[1:35:18] the more evil it becomes
[1:35:20] and he says until i can pronounce it's
[1:35:23] ichabod
[1:35:25] and the glory of the lord has departed
[1:35:29] from the whole denominational outfit
[1:35:31] remember in the days of eli remember
[1:35:33] what it was
[1:35:35] and when the priest had become his sons
[1:35:37] had become um unlawful in doing evil
[1:35:40] things and molesting the women at the
[1:35:42] cords and and stealing from the
[1:35:44] sacrifices and taking what was not
[1:35:46] theirs and and cheating and everything
[1:35:48] else and there was all kinds of sin in
[1:35:51] the ministry
[1:35:54] and amen and then and then the judgment
[1:35:57] came by the word of the prophet
[1:36:00] and remember a baby is born during that
[1:36:02] time and that baby is born what happens
[1:36:05] the ark of the lord is taken
[1:36:10] amen the word is gone
[1:36:12] it's taken out from their midst
[1:36:15] it's captured is taken down into
[1:36:17] philistine in the philistine and here
[1:36:20] the word is taken the word is departed
[1:36:23] now the priest the old priest dies and
[1:36:26] as it does a baby is born and the child
[1:36:29] the offspring
[1:36:31] of all of that heartache
[1:36:34] of all that trouble
[1:36:35] was
[1:36:36] ichabod meaning the glory of the lord
[1:36:42] has departed
[1:36:46] now this thing repeats again this last
[1:36:48] day
[1:36:49] now ezekiel foretold
[1:36:52] the destruction of the temple and the
[1:36:54] rejection of israel i'd like you to go
[1:36:56] with me to ezekiel 9 verse 1. now
[1:36:58] brother branham would parallel this
[1:37:00] scripture for our day as well
[1:37:02] but this actually you know it physically
[1:37:05] becomes fulfilled
[1:37:07] in the um
[1:37:08] in the destruction of jerusalem ezekiel
[1:37:11] 9 1. and he cried within my ear with a
[1:37:13] loud voice saying cause him to have
[1:37:16] charge of the city to draw near even
[1:37:18] every man with his destroying weapon in
[1:37:21] his hand the whole six men came by the
[1:37:23] way of the higher gate was light toward
[1:37:25] the north and every man a slaughter
[1:37:26] weapon in his hand and one man among
[1:37:29] them was clothed with linen and with a
[1:37:31] writer's ink horn by his side and they
[1:37:34] went in and stood by the brazen altar
[1:37:36] now brother branham describes this as
[1:37:39] the holy ghost
[1:37:40] he's the one that's marking
[1:37:42] and the glory of the the god of israel
[1:37:45] was gone up from the cherub now wait a
[1:37:47] minute let's get the picture the
[1:37:49] shekinah glory leaves
[1:37:52] leaves
[1:37:54] the
[1:37:55] leaves the cherubims
[1:37:57] where the ark of the covenant is come on
[1:38:01] that is supposed to be hovering over the
[1:38:04] the chair the ark of the covenant which
[1:38:06] contains the word and it it leaves
[1:38:09] look where that and he goes to the
[1:38:11] threshold
[1:38:14] so he is leaving the church
[1:38:18] and he called to the man with the
[1:38:21] clothed with lennon which had the
[1:38:23] writer's incorn by his side and the lord
[1:38:25] said unto him go through the mississippi
[1:38:27] to the midst of jerusalem set a mark
[1:38:30] upon the foreheads of them the men that
[1:38:32] signed cried for all the abominations
[1:38:34] that's done in the midst of thereof and
[1:38:36] to the others he said in mine here go ye
[1:38:38] after him through the city and smite let
[1:38:40] not your eyes spare neither have pity
[1:38:43] slay utterly young old and young both
[1:38:47] maids and little children and women but
[1:38:50] come not near any man upon whom the mark
[1:38:55] and begin
[1:38:56] where at my sanctuary
[1:38:59] because judgment begins at the house of
[1:39:02] god
[1:39:03] amen and then they begin to at the
[1:39:06] ancient men which were before the house
[1:39:08] and he said defile the hard the house
[1:39:11] and fill the courts with the slain and
[1:39:13] go you forth and they went forth and
[1:39:15] slew the in the city now here god says
[1:39:18] defile
[1:39:19] defile the house defile the temple now
[1:39:22] why does he do this because in the in
[1:39:24] the chapter before
[1:39:26] in chapter eight they have set up all
[1:39:29] kinds of the idol worship
[1:39:32] in the house of god having rejected
[1:39:35] jehovah and god said i'm leaving
[1:39:39] cause i'm not sharing my love with
[1:39:41] another
[1:39:43] amen i'm gonna have a bride she'll be
[1:39:45] without spot or wrinkle
[1:39:48] i'm not sharing my love with another you
[1:39:51] my my wife with another man i'm not
[1:39:53] putting up with that come on and he
[1:39:56] leaves and as he leaves he says defy the
[1:39:59] house you've defiled it
[1:40:01] you've divided with your false doctrines
[1:40:03] your creeds your dumbness
[1:40:05] all the things against the spirit now
[1:40:07] i'm going to defile it
[1:40:12] and he would say not one stone to be
[1:40:14] left on another
[1:40:19] now
[1:40:21] and it came to pass while they were
[1:40:23] slaying i was left and i fell upon my
[1:40:25] face and cried and i said oh lord god
[1:40:27] will i destroy all the residue of israel
[1:40:29] in that pouring out of that fury and he
[1:40:31] said unto me the iniquity of the house
[1:40:33] of israel in judah is exceeding great
[1:40:36] the land is full of blood the city full
[1:40:38] of perverseness for they say the lord
[1:40:40] has forsaken the earth
[1:40:42] and the lord see it not
[1:40:44] they're saying he's not the same
[1:40:46] yesterday today and forever
[1:40:52] and as for me
[1:40:53] also my eyes shall not spare neither
[1:40:56] will i have pity but i will recompense
[1:40:59] their way upon their head and behold the
[1:41:01] man clothed with linen which had the ink
[1:41:04] horn by his side reported the matters
[1:41:06] that i have done as thou has commanded
[1:41:09] me
[1:41:11] so god spoke judgment
[1:41:13] and because of the sin that had entered
[1:41:16] the house of god amen then judgment had
[1:41:20] to begin at the temple and the glory of
[1:41:22] the lord had to leave this kind of glory
[1:41:25] the pillar of fire left the cherub
[1:41:28] and moved to the door leaving the church
[1:41:31] israel
[1:41:32] exactly like revelation 3.
[1:41:40] i'll spew you out of my mouth
[1:41:47] you've rejected me
[1:41:49] you've turned my word down
[1:41:51] you don't want my spirit
[1:41:54] now i'm rejecting you
[1:41:56] you see what a serious thing it is
[1:41:59] to reject the move of the spirit of god
[1:42:02] now let me back up this for a moment
[1:42:04] we've had things that god has spoken
[1:42:06] about in this day
[1:42:08] there's a man
[1:42:09] um
[1:42:11] and i and i told this some years ago but
[1:42:14] there's a man by the name of clayton's
[1:42:15] son moore he wrote a book called show
[1:42:17] the house to the house
[1:42:20] and in there he told of a personal
[1:42:21] testimony of spending time he said three
[1:42:24] hours with brother branham while he was
[1:42:26] in jamaica in february of 1958
[1:42:30] and brother branham would speak to him
[1:42:31] concerning the world
[1:42:33] uh political and and spiritual events
[1:42:37] including what part certain individuals
[1:42:39] and organizations would would play and
[1:42:42] some more had this to say he said to my
[1:42:44] knowledge
[1:42:45] every insight brother branham related
[1:42:47] that day has been fulfilled exactly as
[1:42:50] prophesied
[1:42:52] even to the very year the holy spirit
[1:42:54] showed him that such events would take
[1:42:56] place
[1:42:57] mr sun more further stated are related
[1:43:00] that the hour of darkness descended in
[1:43:02] or beyond 1977 was so black
[1:43:06] that brother branham could see no
[1:43:08] further and it was a point that he
[1:43:10] maintained to his to his death now if
[1:43:12] the man is right in what he says
[1:43:15] then
[1:43:17] we are now
[1:43:19] 44 years
[1:43:21] advanced into the hour of darkness
[1:43:33] so it's getting so dark
[1:43:35] that brother branham said you come where
[1:43:37] we couldn't see our hand in front of our
[1:43:39] face
[1:43:43] we're here
[1:43:47] we're talking about
[1:43:49] how many people are going home
[1:43:52] we're talking about
[1:43:54] coveting economies world
[1:43:57] everything crumbling
[1:44:04] are you with me
[1:44:06] we are now 44 years advanced into the
[1:44:10] hour of darkness
[1:44:12] now i want to stop for a minute and talk
[1:44:14] about 1977
[1:44:17] because you know it's a place that
[1:44:19] everybody goes to in order to dismiss
[1:44:21] brother branham as being a prophet
[1:44:23] they love to say they just love to say
[1:44:26] he failed uh prophecy concerning 1977.
[1:44:30] well i'll just tell you this if that was
[1:44:33] his only failure well then
[1:44:35] i i'll i'll just say this to him
[1:44:38] he was more accurate than any of them
[1:44:44] i just put him up besides their prophets
[1:44:50] and
[1:44:51] you know
[1:44:52] let me just say
[1:44:54] actually you know if a person is fair
[1:44:56] and wants to judge everything the same
[1:45:00] then billy graham is also a false
[1:45:02] prophet
[1:45:03] because he predicted the lord would come
[1:45:05] in 1959.
[1:45:07] i got that in my library in his book
[1:45:09] that they wrote said he's learned after
[1:45:11] that not to make such predictions
[1:45:14] but we know of the seven major convicted
[1:45:17] visions that brother branham had in 1933
[1:45:20] and i want to just speak about the
[1:45:22] moment to just show you where we're at
[1:45:24] and he would talk about the laodicean
[1:45:26] age began around the turn of the century
[1:45:29] perhaps 1906 and said how long will it
[1:45:31] last
[1:45:33] as a servant of god is that multitudes
[1:45:35] of visions with which none has failed
[1:45:37] let me predict
[1:45:38] i did not say prophesy but predicted
[1:45:40] this age will end around 1977.
[1:45:44] and he said if you pardon a personal
[1:45:45] note here i base this prediction on
[1:45:48] seven major continuous visions it came
[1:45:50] to me one sunday morning in june 1933
[1:45:53] and the lord jesus spoke to me and said
[1:45:56] that the coming of the lord was drawing
[1:45:58] nigh but before that he came seven major
[1:46:01] events would transpire
[1:46:03] i wrote them all down and that morning i
[1:46:06] gave forth the revelation of the lord
[1:46:08] the first was mussolini mussolini would
[1:46:10] invade ethiopia and that nation would
[1:46:13] fall as it steps that vision surely did
[1:46:16] cause some repercussions and some were
[1:46:18] very angry when i said it would not
[1:46:20] believe it but it happened that way he
[1:46:22] just walked in there with his modern
[1:46:24] arms and took it over and the natives
[1:46:26] didn't have a chance but the vision all
[1:46:28] said mussolini would come to a horrible
[1:46:30] end with his own people turning on him
[1:46:32] and that came to pass just exactly as it
[1:46:34] said
[1:46:35] the next vision foretold in austria by
[1:46:38] the name of adolf hitler who would rise
[1:46:41] up as dictator over germany and he would
[1:46:43] draw the world into war
[1:46:45] and it showed the secret line how the
[1:46:47] troops would have a terrible time to
[1:46:50] overcome it it showed that hitler would
[1:46:52] come to mysterious end
[1:46:55] the third vision was in the realm of
[1:46:57] world politics
[1:46:59] showed me there would be three great
[1:47:00] isms fascism and nazism communism but
[1:47:04] the two would be swallowed up in the
[1:47:05] third and the voice admonish watch
[1:47:08] russia watch russia keep your eyes on
[1:47:10] the king of the north
[1:47:12] the fourth vision would show great
[1:47:14] advances in science that would come
[1:47:16] forth after the second world war it was
[1:47:19] headed up in the vision of a plastic
[1:47:21] bubble top car that was running down
[1:47:24] beautiful highways under remote control
[1:47:26] so people were seated in this car
[1:47:28] without a steering wheel and they were
[1:47:29] playing some type of game to muse
[1:47:31] themselves
[1:47:34] we're here
[1:47:36] and the fifth mission had to do with the
[1:47:38] moral problem of our age
[1:47:41] centered mostly around women god showed
[1:47:43] me that women began to be out of their
[1:47:45] place
[1:47:46] with the granting of the vote
[1:47:48] this ain't popular today
[1:47:50] then they began to cut off their hair
[1:47:52] which signified they were no longer
[1:47:53] under the authority of a man but
[1:47:55] insisted on either equal rights or in
[1:47:58] most cases more than equal rights
[1:48:01] she adopted men's clothing went to a
[1:48:03] state of undress
[1:48:05] until the last picture i saw was a woman
[1:48:08] naked except for a little big leaf type
[1:48:11] apron and with this vision i saw the
[1:48:13] terrible perversion and moral plight of
[1:48:16] the whole world which all includes even
[1:48:19] the homosexual sodomite movement
[1:48:24] because if you don't believe that's
[1:48:25] sodomite
[1:48:26] the women were the first cross-dressers
[1:48:32] then in the sixth vision there are rose
[1:48:34] up in america most beautiful but cruel
[1:48:37] woman she held in her the people in her
[1:48:39] complete power i believe this was the
[1:48:41] rise of the roman catholic church so i
[1:48:43] knew it could possibly be a vision of
[1:48:46] some woman rising in great power in
[1:48:48] america do a popular vote by women
[1:48:52] and he says
[1:48:53] again the 70th week he said i predicted
[1:48:56] and said i saw a great woman stand up
[1:48:59] beautiful looking dressed and high
[1:49:01] royals like purple
[1:49:05] she's a great ruler in the united states
[1:49:07] and i said perhaps the catholic church
[1:49:10] i don't know her to be the catholic
[1:49:11] church i don't know i can't say only
[1:49:14] thing i've seen i've seen the woman that
[1:49:15] was all
[1:49:18] and then again from that time he said
[1:49:19] remember
[1:49:21] he said thus saith the lord there will
[1:49:22] be a woman ruled before the end time
[1:49:24] she'll either be president or vice
[1:49:26] president or be the catholic church as a
[1:49:28] woman i've seen her a great woman the
[1:49:31] nation is bowed to her
[1:49:33] it'll be one before the end time just
[1:49:35] saith the lord write it down and find
[1:49:37] out your young people see if it happens
[1:49:39] if it isn't
[1:49:40] then i'm a false prophet
[1:49:43] and we're here
[1:49:45] right down to the color of dress the
[1:49:47] woman wore
[1:49:49] and then the seventh and last vision was
[1:49:51] i heard a most terrible explosion and i
[1:49:54] turned to look and i saw nothing but
[1:49:56] debris and craters and smoke all over
[1:49:59] the land of america
[1:50:03] and then he would say based on these
[1:50:05] seven visions
[1:50:07] along with the rapid
[1:50:09] changes which i swept which have swept
[1:50:12] the world in the last 50 years i predict
[1:50:16] i do not prophesy
[1:50:18] that these visions will have come to
[1:50:20] pass by 1977.
[1:50:23] now we know
[1:50:25] there's definitely some of them didn't
[1:50:27] make it
[1:50:30] but predict
[1:50:31] can mean prophesy or divine
[1:50:36] but brother branham was clear this is
[1:50:37] not a prophecy
[1:50:40] the definition of the word predict is
[1:50:43] not always prophesy or divine though
[1:50:46] predict can mean speculate
[1:50:48] envision
[1:50:50] invisage imagine picture estimate
[1:50:53] conjecture guess or hazard a guest
[1:50:59] so since he said it's not prophecy he's
[1:51:01] saying i'm hazard in the guests
[1:51:05] you know i'm estimating
[1:51:07] i'm imagining you know this is i'm
[1:51:10] speculating on this
[1:51:13] now in 70 weeks of daniel he was clear
[1:51:16] he said now i don't want anyone to go
[1:51:18] away misunderstanding this tape's still
[1:51:20] playing i don't want anyone to
[1:51:21] misunderstand this don't unders
[1:51:23] misunderstand now and say brother
[1:51:25] branham said jesus would come in 1977.
[1:51:28] i've never said no such a thing jesus
[1:51:30] may come today but i predicted that
[1:51:33] between 33 and 77 something would take
[1:51:37] place
[1:51:38] that these things that i've seen come to
[1:51:40] pass in the vision would take place and
[1:51:43] five of them has already taken place
[1:51:46] getting the laodicean church age
[1:51:49] as he preached it remember the church's
[1:51:51] book is a paraphrase and and a
[1:51:53] grammarization of what he said
[1:51:57] so he said we believe that churches
[1:51:59] started in a.d 1906. now i predict now
[1:52:02] remember predict especially you listen
[1:52:04] to the table i don't say it will be
[1:52:06] but i predict that it will end by 1977
[1:52:09] that the church will go into into
[1:52:12] completely into apostasy
[1:52:17] bear that in mind the church
[1:52:19] will go completely into apostasy
[1:52:25] now
[1:52:26] and he says
[1:52:28] and she will be ousted out of the mouth
[1:52:31] of god
[1:52:35] and the second coming of the rapture of
[1:52:37] the church of christ might come any time
[1:52:39] now i could miss that a year i can miss
[1:52:40] that 20 years i could miss it 100 years
[1:52:43] i don't know where but i just predict
[1:52:45] going to the vision he showed me taking
[1:52:46] the time the way it's progressing and i
[1:52:48] say it'll be somewhere between 33 and 77
[1:52:52] this great nation is going to strike a
[1:52:53] war that's going to blow us to peace at
[1:52:55] least this great nation is going to
[1:52:57] strike a war that are going to blow it
[1:52:59] to bits now it's pretty close it's awful
[1:53:01] close and i could be wrong i'm
[1:53:03] predicting everybody understand say amen
[1:53:05] if you do
[1:53:08] now
[1:53:09] this again
[1:53:10] i'm going to read this from the
[1:53:12] exposition of the seven church ages as
[1:53:15] you know as i said was a paraphrasing of
[1:53:17] what he said on tape brother level took
[1:53:19] the things he taught and made
[1:53:21] grammatical changes
[1:53:23] and he says it in here
[1:53:25] based on these seven visions along with
[1:53:27] rapid changes
[1:53:28] which has swept the world
[1:53:30] that i predict i do not prophesy these
[1:53:33] visions will have all come to pass
[1:53:35] by 1977 and though many feel this is
[1:53:38] irresponsible statement and view of the
[1:53:40] fact that jesus said no man know it the
[1:53:42] day or the hour i still maintain this
[1:53:44] prediction after 30 years because jesus
[1:53:47] did not say no man could not know the
[1:53:49] year the month of the week and which is
[1:53:51] coming was to be completed so i repeat
[1:53:54] i sincerely believe and maintain as a
[1:53:58] private student of the word along with
[1:54:00] divine inspiration
[1:54:03] that's
[1:54:04] 1977 art and that word ought means a
[1:54:07] probability but not a certainty
[1:54:10] to terminate the world's systems and
[1:54:13] usher in the millennium
[1:54:17] now listen
[1:54:18] let's get some understanding first of
[1:54:20] all he said i as
[1:54:22] i i i sincerely believe and maintain as
[1:54:25] a private student of the word along with
[1:54:28] divine inspiration now you know years
[1:54:30] ago we stopped right there and see that
[1:54:32] was prophecy
[1:54:34] see he had divine inspiration to say
[1:54:36] that no the divine inspiration was the
[1:54:38] seven visions
[1:54:41] so he's saying i as a private student of
[1:54:44] the word along with having seen seven
[1:54:46] visions
[1:54:47] of the end time that 77 ought
[1:54:51] or is a probability but not a certainty
[1:54:55] terminate the world's systems
[1:54:58] and usher in the millennium
[1:55:01] now so now let's notice here some things
[1:55:04] now of course we have seen where he says
[1:55:07] i don't say it will be i am not
[1:55:10] prophesying this is a prediction this is
[1:55:13] i'm hazarding a guess
[1:55:17] amen
[1:55:18] but i can miss it a year or 20 years i
[1:55:20] can miss it a hundred years
[1:55:23] i don't know where
[1:55:27] and i could be wrong i'm predicting
[1:55:31] which again he said is not prophecy so
[1:55:34] i'm not using the word predict as a
[1:55:36] prophecy i'm using it as
[1:55:38] i'm not divining here i'm not
[1:55:40] prophesying i'm not saying god said this
[1:55:43] i am saying i'm hazarding a guest
[1:55:49] in other words the sun lord would say it
[1:55:52] it got so dark he couldn't see beyond
[1:55:54] that
[1:55:57] that we would advance into the hour of
[1:55:59] darkness until a prophet couldn't even
[1:56:03] see beyond that
[1:56:05] but he told us that there were going to
[1:56:07] be things that would happen and that the
[1:56:10] church would go completely into apostasy
[1:56:13] and be ousted out of the mouth of god
[1:56:20] now
[1:56:22] i want just to get your thoughts on this
[1:56:26] he said it would terminate world systems
[1:56:30] now you learn to keep things in context
[1:56:34] so when you got to seven churches book
[1:56:36] and brother branham uses the phrase
[1:56:38] terminate world systems
[1:56:40] well then what does that mean i mean
[1:56:42] i've said you know we still got the
[1:56:44] united states government we still got
[1:56:46] the russian governments we still got
[1:56:48] china we still got you know the catholic
[1:56:51] church we got all kinds of things that
[1:56:53] are still going on
[1:56:56] right
[1:56:57] but what is the world's system now he
[1:56:59] was so keep it in context with his
[1:57:02] thoughts in the sardisian church age he
[1:57:04] said
[1:57:05] now
[1:57:06] they had what the world could not have
[1:57:08] jesus said when he went away
[1:57:10] he would send his spirit which the world
[1:57:12] could not receive that's right the world
[1:57:14] or world system could not receive him
[1:57:18] that's what organization is
[1:57:21] it is a world system and you show me a
[1:57:25] world church system that is full of the
[1:57:27] holy ghost
[1:57:29] i want to see it if you can show me such
[1:57:31] a church you'll find a mistake in the
[1:57:33] word
[1:57:34] no sir not one of these messengers were
[1:57:37] organized either they were put out or
[1:57:39] got out because they were convicted of
[1:57:41] the sin of organization how can the holy
[1:57:43] spirit possibly be in an organization
[1:57:47] when it is the organization that takes
[1:57:49] the place of the spirit and
[1:57:50] denominations take the place of the word
[1:57:53] remember organization is death it just
[1:57:56] can't be any other way if the world
[1:57:58] takes over the spirit departs
[1:58:04] so now what happened
[1:58:06] amen what happened god brought an end
[1:58:11] terminating world systems
[1:58:15] he left the systems of religion come on
[1:58:18] now and he vindicated a word he opened
[1:58:22] the book and loosed the seals
[1:58:24] come on now
[1:58:26] are you with me now
[1:58:27] amen and when doing so he absolutely
[1:58:30] terminates the world systems of religion
[1:58:35] every one of them and they're no longer
[1:58:37] his voice they no longer speak for him
[1:58:40] and to so he calls out a bride who will
[1:58:44] be his boss
[1:58:46] [Applause]
[1:58:48] man she will be one with the word
[1:58:50] because she is a word born bride
[1:59:02] now world systems were indicted and
[1:59:05] terminated 14 years before 1977.
[1:59:09] i sit out of the mouth of god
[1:59:12] because in the year 1963 when the book
[1:59:14] was that was shown as sealed with seven
[1:59:18] sealed mystery was unsealed
[1:59:20] and the word was revealed
[1:59:24] god terminated
[1:59:25] and brought to an end every
[1:59:28] organizational spirit
[1:59:33] now
[1:59:34] the opening of the book terminated
[1:59:38] and made obsolete every teaching of man
[1:59:43] and every doctrine of man
[1:59:46] and god put away the church
[1:59:53] now i'm just going to say to you stack
[1:59:55] up all the books
[1:59:57] stack them all up if you ever go in the
[1:59:59] bible bookstore just look at the
[2:00:01] hundreds
[2:00:04] commentaries
[2:00:05] books
[2:00:06] writings on this writing on that writing
[2:00:09] on predestination writing on eternal
[2:00:11] security writing on baptism uh you take
[2:00:14] all of the doctrinal thesis
[2:00:17] bible commentaries books on christ
[2:00:20] coming
[2:00:21] books on the tribulation
[2:00:23] books on being left behind
[2:00:26] books on the apocalypse
[2:00:29] books on all of that
[2:00:30] and they were rendered obsolete
[2:00:39] because i'll tell you this all of them
[2:00:41] were hazarding the gas
[2:00:44] but when god spoke opening up the seven
[2:00:47] seals it was no longer a gas
[2:00:50] it was not a man
[2:00:51] come on now it did not come from the
[2:00:54] thinking of man it came from god
[2:00:57] out of heaven
[2:00:59] out of heaven came seven ninety angels
[2:01:03] hallelujah representing the seven church
[2:01:05] ages were fearless
[2:01:07] or completed
[2:01:13] that we had reached the end
[2:01:15] and that brings about the changing of a
[2:01:18] dispensation
[2:01:21] and this happens in this last day
[2:01:25] now if you think i'm preaching something
[2:01:26] new i'm not i started i preached i
[2:01:29] preached these sermons back in 1999-2000
[2:01:34] long long before that
[2:01:37] but this this this is something that we
[2:01:39] believe and i'm just refreshing you
[2:01:42] as to where we're at in this hour of
[2:01:44] darkness
[2:01:46] i'm trying to show you again and
[2:01:49] re-emphasize to you who
[2:01:51] where is the voice of god today where is
[2:01:54] god where is god at
[2:01:56] show us the father
[2:01:58] that's what i was preaching last sunday
[2:02:00] show us the father where is he at
[2:02:04] and they were looking at him
[2:02:06] and didn't know
[2:02:07] when you see me you seen the father
[2:02:10] and today the people are looking for
[2:02:12] jesus and he's here
[2:02:14] but where is he
[2:02:19] are you with me he's not coming walking
[2:02:21] down the aisle with nail scars he's in a
[2:02:23] people
[2:02:25] you see that's what he said show us the
[2:02:27] father the last days is god in his
[2:02:32] people
[2:02:33] [Applause]
[2:02:35] behold the word bride
[2:02:37] that is his body that's who he's
[2:02:40] speaking through that's who he's
[2:02:41] revealing that's who he's walking
[2:02:43] through that's who's doing the miracles
[2:02:46] hey man it's your hands laid on the sick
[2:02:49] and they shall recover it's your voice
[2:02:52] taking the word and speaking it against
[2:02:54] your enemy it is you
[2:03:03] it brings about the dispensation of the
[2:03:05] fullness of times
[2:03:08] now
[2:03:09] where everything is brought to its
[2:03:12] fullness
[2:03:14] where partial word gives
[2:03:16] gives way to the fullness of the word
[2:03:20] in the in ephesians chapter 1 verse 9
[2:03:23] heaven made known to us the mystery of
[2:03:25] his will this is what god has done one
[2:03:28] more time he's brought paul's gospel and
[2:03:31] restored it making known to you the
[2:03:34] mystery of his will
[2:03:36] according to good pleasure which he had
[2:03:38] purpose in himself that in the
[2:03:40] dispensation notice this the
[2:03:42] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[2:03:45] might gather together in one all things
[2:03:48] in christ both which are in heaven and
[2:03:50] which are on earth even in him
[2:03:52] so everything is going to be gathered
[2:03:54] into him there's going to be a uniting
[2:03:57] of all that he is
[2:04:00] every promise that he is everywhere he
[2:04:02] is all of his people into him
[2:04:06] now he can't gather the church because
[2:04:09] she don't need him
[2:04:11] she don't want him but he swore i'll
[2:04:14] have a church washed and cleansed by the
[2:04:17] word and paul declares he will gather in
[2:04:21] the one things that are in heaven and
[2:04:23] things on the earth and would gather
[2:04:25] them all into himself
[2:04:29] so we are in the hour of the harvest
[2:04:31] season
[2:04:32] of the gathering
[2:04:33] where he'll even gather the saints going
[2:04:36] on
[2:04:36] with the saints that are living and
[2:04:39] bring them all together in him to catch
[2:04:41] them up together to him
[2:04:45] this is rapture hour
[2:04:48] in this hour of darkness
[2:04:51] now so you see
[2:04:53] again with regard to the fullness of
[2:04:56] time
[2:04:57] you know that's the end of history
[2:04:59] it's the climaxes of the ages
[2:05:02] is that right
[2:05:03] to bring all things together in christ
[2:05:05] both things that are in heaven and
[2:05:07] things on the earth
[2:05:09] so so again you know this is what he's
[2:05:11] doing is we are here in the climax
[2:05:15] of the ages
[2:05:18] now brother branham would use the
[2:05:20] pyramid to to to to describe or to type
[2:05:24] three different things he would type the
[2:05:27] church or individuals let me start with
[2:05:29] the individual he would type us as being
[2:05:32] believing by faith accepting the lord
[2:05:35] adding the faith virgin virgin knowledge
[2:05:36] becoming the tabernacle living god's
[2:05:38] dwelling place
[2:05:40] the holy ghost uniting you and god
[2:05:42] together sealing you together as one so
[2:05:44] you know the capstone of the believer is
[2:05:47] the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:05:49] it's the token
[2:05:51] without it you're not complete
[2:05:53] you might have started believing in the
[2:05:55] lord but you are an incomplete until you
[2:05:58] get the holy ghost it's the seal of god
[2:06:01] it's the capstone
[2:06:04] now then number two he would do what he
[2:06:08] would finish the mysteries
[2:06:11] how many is with me now
[2:06:13] so we've had mysteries that had started
[2:06:15] being restored down to the ages and
[2:06:18] luther got justification wesley thank
[2:06:20] you i'm just hitting some of the high
[2:06:21] points and we come right up up to the
[2:06:23] top and it gets capped off
[2:06:25] with seven thunders
[2:06:28] which were the revelations that were
[2:06:31] contained in the seven seals
[2:06:33] come on now
[2:06:35] so the final mystery
[2:06:37] opens the book or completes all the
[2:06:40] mysteries of god
[2:06:42] so god will use the prophet to cap off
[2:06:46] all the mysteries once he comes there
[2:06:48] are no more mysteries
[2:06:51] that's why i don't like mystery
[2:06:52] preachers
[2:06:53] because when you get through it's still
[2:06:55] a mystery
[2:06:58] amen but brother we're not preaching
[2:07:00] mysteries anymore we're preaching
[2:07:02] revelation
[2:07:04] we're preaching revealed truth
[2:07:07] are you with me now
[2:07:09] amen now this is this is important to
[2:07:11] understand it's capped off the seven
[2:07:14] seals would open up and bring to light
[2:07:17] every every truth of the bible
[2:07:20] concerning the bride
[2:07:23] are you with me
[2:07:24] now then of course there is the third
[2:07:27] one which types out what god will do
[2:07:30] he's come through seven ages
[2:07:33] and man comes down we're the last age
[2:07:36] and we're the lad we're the age that
[2:07:38] meets the capstone and the capstone is
[2:07:41] the physical return of christ
[2:07:44] so again when we say capstone what are
[2:07:47] we talking about
[2:07:48] amen it can mean the physical return of
[2:07:51] christ uniting of the bride and the
[2:07:53] groom
[2:07:54] amen and all seven angels being raised
[2:07:56] up to meet him in the air
[2:07:58] that's the capstone we're looking for
[2:08:01] that's the one that hadn't come
[2:08:04] amen we're looking for the coming of the
[2:08:06] lord we're going to meet him in the air
[2:08:08] but we have been capped by the holy
[2:08:11] ghost
[2:08:12] we are a sealed unit we're part of the
[2:08:14] promise
[2:08:16] every one of you fit right in the
[2:08:18] pyramid
[2:08:19] fit right there in the promise of god
[2:08:22] amen a rapture ready church
[2:08:24] going to meet him in the air
[2:08:27] amen waiting for the coming of the lord
[2:08:29] and remember the dynamics of this church
[2:08:32] will be a refilling of the holy ghost
[2:08:34] which is what we have worked in a small
[2:08:36] measure as as the body come up from
[2:08:39] through the capstone but when he comes
[2:08:42] he will seal her off until even the dead
[2:08:44] in christ for thousands of years will
[2:08:47] rise up
[2:08:48] [Applause]
[2:08:51] and we're living in the hour oh my the
[2:08:54] holy ghost has come you can receive the
[2:08:56] capstone for your life and man the
[2:08:59] thunders and mysteries have been
[2:09:00] revealed and there's no more mystery who
[2:09:03] is capped off it's a finish there's one
[2:09:05] more cat so we're waiting on and that's
[2:09:07] for jesus to come back
[2:09:11] hallelujah and when he comes we will fit
[2:09:14] him exactly as bone of his bone and
[2:09:17] flesh of his flesh and life of his life
[2:09:20] and power of his power
[2:09:28] do you know
[2:09:29] we are living in the hour where time is
[2:09:33] no more
[2:09:38] well in the world you mean by that let's
[2:09:39] go to revelation 10 verse 1.
[2:09:42] this is another scripture for our day
[2:09:48] we're standing right here
[2:09:50] is where we're at
[2:09:53] in the fulfillment of this scripture
[2:09:56] this is our day
[2:09:57] and i saw another mighty angel
[2:10:01] this is in comparison to revelation 9
[2:10:04] where abaddon
[2:10:06] apollyon
[2:10:07] there raises up all where all the world
[2:10:10] is worshiping
[2:10:13] and then idolatry
[2:10:16] and it's shown there and we look away
[2:10:18] from there and said now and i saw
[2:10:20] another
[2:10:22] mighty angel
[2:10:24] come down from heaven
[2:10:25] he's clothed with a cloud and a rainbow
[2:10:28] was upon his head his face was as it
[2:10:30] were the sun his feet as pillars of fire
[2:10:32] all of this is symbology
[2:10:34] and he as in his hand a little book open
[2:10:37] what was sealed in revelation 5 is now
[2:10:40] open
[2:10:40] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[2:10:43] and his left foot upon the earth
[2:10:45] so where the two beast powers come from
[2:10:48] the sea and the earth he sets his feet
[2:10:50] upon them
[2:10:54] and he cried with a loud voice
[2:10:56] as when a lion roareth so he shouts
[2:10:59] so as he descends he does three things
[2:11:03] first thessalonians 4. shout voice
[2:11:05] trumpet
[2:11:07] and when he cried or he shouts with a
[2:11:10] loud voice and it's like when a lion
[2:11:12] roared because it's the king speaking
[2:11:16] and when he cried
[2:11:18] in this shout seven thunders utter their
[2:11:20] voices
[2:11:22] so when this message comes
[2:11:24] mysteries are revealed
[2:11:27] now this
[2:11:28] a thunder is when god says something but
[2:11:31] it isn't time for it to be made known
[2:11:33] so you don't want it known yet
[2:11:36] we're not in the days of the thunder
[2:11:40] we're in the days of the voice
[2:11:44] where it becomes a known truth
[2:11:48] now what
[2:11:49] and the seven thunders what had uttered
[2:11:52] their voices
[2:11:54] and i was about to write and i heard a
[2:11:56] voice from heaven saying seal up it's
[2:11:58] not time john
[2:11:59] you can't write it
[2:12:01] seal up the things with seven thunders
[2:12:03] uttered write them not and the angel
[2:12:05] which i saw stand up on the sea upon the
[2:12:07] earth
[2:12:07] lifted up his hand to heaven oh my he's
[2:12:10] making a sworn affidavit
[2:12:13] he is absolutely making a vow
[2:12:17] and he swore by himself
[2:12:21] because he's the one that liveth forever
[2:12:23] and ever
[2:12:24] who created heaven the things that there
[2:12:26] are him to see and so on that there
[2:12:29] should be time
[2:12:31] no longer
[2:12:34] we are in that hour time is no more
[2:12:40] amen
[2:12:41] but watch now the days of the voice of
[2:12:43] the seventh angel when he should begin
[2:12:45] to sound the mystery of god shall be
[2:12:47] finished as he had declared to his
[2:12:49] servants a prophet so now what happens
[2:12:52] the time you say brother tim time
[2:12:55] time's no more
[2:12:56] what do you got a calendar for
[2:12:59] how come you still got to watch on and
[2:13:00] how come there's still time in the
[2:13:02] millennium and yet time is no more
[2:13:06] what does this mean
[2:13:08] it means the time
[2:13:10] to keep the silence
[2:13:14] the time to keep this a mystery
[2:13:18] keep it in contact the kind the time to
[2:13:20] keep this quiet
[2:13:22] is over with
[2:13:25] and you're in the hour for the time for
[2:13:27] mysteries is over with
[2:13:31] amen the silence has been broken
[2:13:35] amen by what god sent in a prophet
[2:13:38] it wasn't me that opened the seals it
[2:13:40] even when brother branham did over to
[2:13:42] the seal it was christ that opened the
[2:13:44] seals
[2:13:45] but it was open to a prophet the word
[2:13:48] came to a prophet
[2:13:50] and that's why the first phase of the
[2:13:52] rapture is a shout it is a prophet
[2:13:54] bringing a message
[2:13:56] it's a message to awaken to the people
[2:14:00] amen is to awaken you to your rights
[2:14:02] it's awaken your understanding it's
[2:14:04] awakened to you to who you are
[2:14:07] to where you are in this hour
[2:14:10] are you with me
[2:14:11] now so revelation 10 declares the system
[2:14:15] of men is
[2:14:17] over with
[2:14:20] that men have had their ideas they've
[2:14:22] had their doctrines for thousands of
[2:14:24] years but now christ comes down with an
[2:14:26] open book for god is his own interpreter
[2:14:30] are you with me
[2:14:32] christ the son of man the word comes
[2:14:34] down with the open book
[2:14:37] he's got his left feet on the land in
[2:14:39] the sea and he declares
[2:14:42] when one swears with an oath the time
[2:14:45] shall be no more
[2:14:49] in the days of the voice of this of the
[2:14:51] seventh angel when he sounds his message
[2:14:54] the mystery of god will be
[2:14:57] finished
[2:14:59] the time virtually
[2:15:01] mystery is over with
[2:15:04] hallelujah do you know you're in the
[2:15:06] hour where christ is not withholding
[2:15:08] anything from you but he is revealing
[2:15:11] his entire deity to the people of the
[2:15:13] last age
[2:15:14] [Applause]
[2:15:19] do you know he couldn't reveal his mind
[2:15:21] to some lady that was or some little
[2:15:24] girl that was you're going to be a bride
[2:15:27] a six seven-year-old girl
[2:15:29] he had to wait until we come to the
[2:15:31] maturity
[2:15:36] now
[2:15:37] so now christ puts his foot on the land
[2:15:40] of the sea swears with an oath time
[2:15:41] shall be no more
[2:15:43] or
[2:15:44] another other translation said there
[2:15:46] will be no more delay
[2:15:48] in other words the delaying of this
[2:15:50] mystery is over
[2:15:52] i've delayed it
[2:15:54] i've held it back the other agents
[2:15:56] didn't know it but you know it
[2:15:59] it's been revealed to you
[2:16:01] like i said don't throw away your
[2:16:04] we're still in time we will be until the
[2:16:06] millennium but i want you to hear him
[2:16:08] from the breach he said we'll see later
[2:16:10] is the end time when time has run out
[2:16:13] no denomination has a right for the
[2:16:15] interpretation of the book
[2:16:17] no man has a right to interpret it
[2:16:20] it is the lamb who interprets it what
[2:16:23] brother branham said himself i would
[2:16:24] have made a horrible mistake
[2:16:27] i had some ideas and some notes and i
[2:16:29] was going to walk out and i said well
[2:16:30] that's the best i can do to best start
[2:16:32] my knowledge this is what others have
[2:16:34] said and i'll tell you this is why i
[2:16:36] know and about that time he came in the
[2:16:38] room
[2:16:40] and here it came contrary to my own
[2:16:42] thinking
[2:16:43] because no man has a right to interpret
[2:16:46] it not even brother branham
[2:16:48] it is the lamb who interprets and the
[2:16:51] lamb is the one who speaks it and the
[2:16:53] lamb makes the word to be made known to
[2:16:56] be known by the vindicating and bringing
[2:16:58] the word of life
[2:17:00] notice again he continues notice is not
[2:17:03] revealed until this book is not revealed
[2:17:06] until the church ages and denominational
[2:17:09] agents has run out and there's time no
[2:17:11] more it's only revealed after church
[2:17:14] ages and denominational ages has run out
[2:17:17] that's the reason they the things in
[2:17:19] such a scruple tonight they pick up a
[2:17:21] little doctor and they run over this
[2:17:23] side and say this is it and another
[2:17:25] picks up another doctor and runs over
[2:17:26] this side and said this is it and each
[2:17:29] one believe it builds a denomination
[2:17:30] under it until we got hundreds of
[2:17:32] denominations but still in all of it to
[2:17:35] see confusion the people are wondering
[2:17:37] what is truth
[2:17:39] and that ain't the condition today
[2:17:40] notice what he said
[2:17:42] notice what he says
[2:17:44] he said the book is not revealed
[2:17:47] until denominational ages
[2:17:50] has run out
[2:17:54] when he terminates it then he reveals it
[2:17:59] now
[2:18:00] again this is the age that we're living
[2:18:02] in this is the day where god is called a
[2:18:04] heart
[2:18:05] a halt to men's idea this is what the
[2:18:08] day when god is his own interpreter
[2:18:11] we've had a luther that interpreted the
[2:18:13] word and some of it he got correct
[2:18:16] we had the john smith to interpret the
[2:18:18] word for the anna baptist and here's
[2:18:20] some of it he got correct a lot of it
[2:18:21] he's wrong on
[2:18:23] amen but
[2:18:24] but again we are coming the day where
[2:18:27] there's no more guessing
[2:18:31] amen the same one that never guessed
[2:18:34] telling names addresses diseases what
[2:18:37] the doctor looked like everything else
[2:18:39] told the future told the past
[2:18:42] could go back 40 years
[2:18:44] what was he showing he could go back
[2:18:46] into the mind of god
[2:18:49] and even tell you things your
[2:18:50] great-grandfather did
[2:18:53] come on
[2:18:54] amen what was it if god could do that
[2:18:57] then god could go all the way back to
[2:19:00] where things were sealed up and open it
[2:19:03] up all the way down to the end
[2:19:06] revealing the entire program of god
[2:19:10] to a people in the last days
[2:19:13] now
[2:19:14] notice
[2:19:16] this is the day that god calls to halt
[2:19:19] men's ideas
[2:19:21] your house is left desolate
[2:19:23] 70 years goes by
[2:19:26] but when god said it's finished
[2:19:28] it's finished i don't accept your
[2:19:30] worship
[2:19:31] it's over with
[2:19:33] there is nothing left there to rapture
[2:19:36] them
[2:19:38] many of them go into the tribulation
[2:19:40] period and i believe some of them
[2:19:42] perhaps will be saved during the
[2:19:44] tribulation those that are really
[2:19:45] sincere in their hearts
[2:19:47] will be not saved in the tribulation but
[2:19:50] because they've had a profession of
[2:19:51] faith they'll watch the robes in the
[2:19:53] blood of the lamb and by their works
[2:19:55] they'll be judged be given life
[2:19:58] amen that's god's mercy he's more
[2:20:00] merciful than you ever thought
[2:20:03] not only was he merciful to call you out
[2:20:05] to take you in a rapture
[2:20:07] but he was also merciful to those who
[2:20:10] were blinded some way by false prophets
[2:20:13] misunderstood and wind up in the
[2:20:15] tribulation and he still gives some of
[2:20:17] them life multitude without a number
[2:20:20] he said god that even when the jews
[2:20:22] reject him he gives them another chance
[2:20:24] and here the benjamin group comes in on
[2:20:26] the last day and 144 000 is sealed god
[2:20:30] is the god rich in mercy
[2:20:37] when the lamb took the book
[2:20:39] the mighty angel came down and made this
[2:20:42] declaration world systems were
[2:20:45] terminated church systems were
[2:20:47] terminated it was the beginning of the
[2:20:49] end and god was calling out a bride who
[2:20:52] would be a word
[2:20:56] bride now
[2:20:59] it's the hour of the seventh seal
[2:21:02] because the seventh seal is is coming
[2:21:06] but this
[2:21:07] but it's not a singular event
