[1:02:57] with a great anticipation

[1:03:05] and we get closer to the times of
[1:03:09] the tribulation that is headed up on the
[1:03:11] earth
[1:03:13] and we can feel the winds already
[1:03:15] blowing
[1:03:16] as it begins to move across the earth
[1:03:20] and things are changing the climates are
[1:03:22] changing
[1:03:24] in in in spiritual life and home life
[1:03:27] and political life

[1:03:33] we are here in a time of fulfillment of
[1:03:36] great prophecy
[1:03:38] let us prepare our hearts to meet the
[1:03:40] lord
[1:03:41] amen to be a part of that great
[1:03:44] coming here in this last day where he
[1:03:46] comes
[1:03:48] and he descends from heaven with a shout
[1:03:51] with a message
[1:03:52] with the voice of an archangel someone
[1:03:55] takes the book and eat it
[1:03:57] and becomes one with that voice amen
[1:04:00] that they speak the word of god in this
[1:04:03] end time
[1:04:04] finally for the great trump to sound and
[1:04:07] all the dead in christ arise
[1:04:09] we're looking forward to that it ought
[1:04:12] to be our anticipation what we
[1:04:14] we long for in our heart we're going to
[1:04:17] be talking about some of those things
[1:04:18] this morning
[1:04:21] amen god bless you luke chapter 17 verse
[1:04:25] 28
[1:04:26] is where we'll begin reading from good
[1:04:29] to have each one of you with us today
[1:04:31] and
[1:04:31] pray the lord special blessings upon you
[1:04:34] all luke chapter 17 verse 28
[1:04:37] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:04:39] lot
[1:04:40] they did eat they drank they bought they
[1:04:42] sold they planted they build it
[1:04:45] but the same way the same day that lot
[1:04:47] went out of sodom
[1:04:48] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:04:51] and destroyed them all
[1:04:53] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:04:56] the son of man
[1:04:57] is revealed notice this is not just the
[1:05:00] coming of the son of man but the
[1:05:02] revealing of the son of man when the
[1:05:04] word
[1:05:05] is revealed there's also going to be
[1:05:08] a uh uh an exposing or revealing
[1:05:12] of the of the man of sin and his works
[1:05:16] and what he's done down to the ages is
[1:05:19] in the white horse red horse pale and a
[1:05:21] black and pale as
[1:05:23] as it the antichrist writes and
[1:05:26] an exposing of him at the same time at
[1:05:29] the revealing
[1:05:30] of the son of man so the man of sin is
[1:05:33] revealed
[1:05:34] and the son of man is revealed now
[1:05:37] genesis 18 verse 20.
[1:05:40] genesis 18 verse 20 and the lord said
[1:05:44] because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is
[1:05:47] great
[1:05:48] and because their sin is very grievous
[1:05:52] i will go down now and see whether they
[1:05:55] have done
[1:05:56] altogether according to the cry of it
[1:05:59] which is come unto me and if not
[1:06:01] i will know amen may god bless you you
[1:06:05] can be seated
[1:06:06] we're going to be speaking today on the
[1:06:09] investigating angels of judgment
[1:06:13] because we are in a time of
[1:06:15] investigating
[1:06:16] investigation judgment where angels
[1:06:19] investigate and discern the thoughts and
[1:06:23] the intents of the heart
[1:06:25] this would be something we saw through
[1:06:28] the prophetic ministry of brother
[1:06:30] william branham as over and over again
[1:06:32] time after time without fail
[1:06:35] that um the hearts were discerned
[1:06:39] our sins were exposed and
[1:06:42] um things were were brought to light
[1:06:46] um because of the discerning
[1:06:49] of the angel as it says
[1:06:52] you know i will go down now and see
[1:06:54] whether they have done according to the
[1:06:56] cry of it
[1:06:57] so god is actually doing an
[1:06:59] investigation
[1:07:00] in this last day and then a judgment
[1:07:04] follows that investigation now
[1:07:07] as you know the holy ghost um
[1:07:09] dispensation
[1:07:10] came in and will continue on by the
[1:07:13] administration
[1:07:14] of angels to the church uh they're
[1:07:17] ordained spirits of god they're sent
[1:07:19] from god to
[1:07:21] carry out god's orders his plan
[1:07:24] and and of course um every man to
[1:07:28] you know who had a special calling back
[1:07:31] to the ages
[1:07:32] um angels visited them and uh
[1:07:35] in the last age as it was in the days of
[1:07:39] sodom the bible said when the son of man
[1:07:41] is revealed
[1:07:42] there is again to be angelic
[1:07:45] visitations and one thing that they are
[1:07:48] looking for
[1:07:50] is to find faith so there are things
[1:07:53] that as
[1:07:54] investigate and separate remember
[1:07:57] the last day is a separation where the
[1:08:00] angels go forth and
[1:08:02] separate because um they separate
[1:08:06] the terror from the wheat and and um
[1:08:10] and some are some are put in one
[1:08:12] classification by the angels and
[1:08:14] summoned another
[1:08:16] and then we we have a viewed in the book
[1:08:19] of genesis and
[1:08:20] as we have been uh speaking about this
[1:08:23] in genesis 18 were
[1:08:25] three messengers one was god himself
[1:08:28] came to abraham and they're described as
[1:08:32] men but when the two of them appeared at
[1:08:35] the gate of sodom
[1:08:36] genesis 19 1 says of them and there came
[1:08:40] two angels to sodom at evening and
[1:08:43] lot sat at the gate of sodom
[1:08:46] now so if you'll see this just for a
[1:08:48] moment they come
[1:08:50] and they appeared as men but they were
[1:08:54] angels now you know
[1:08:57] again um yet that um
[1:09:01] as we as we see they went all angels
[1:09:04] but actually one was a self
[1:09:06] manifestation
[1:09:07] of elohim himself so there are specific
[1:09:12] anointings that will anoint people in
[1:09:15] the last day
[1:09:17] there will be those of the abraham group
[1:09:20] they will be visited by elohim himself
[1:09:23] if you'll see this
[1:09:24] in genesis um 18 22 when the men
[1:09:28] turned their faces from them and went
[1:09:30] towards sodom but abraham stood yet
[1:09:33] before the lord so
[1:09:34] two of them were angels went down to
[1:09:37] sodom
[1:09:38] while the the man which was
[1:09:41] the lord stood before abraham
[1:09:45] and this is the one that would discern
[1:09:47] sarah's heart
[1:09:49] he was coming to and looking for faith
[1:09:53] now as we as we know the phenomena
[1:09:56] was being done this was a a
[1:09:59] miraculous event this was a time where
[1:10:03] the pillar of fire the
[1:10:04] the light the logos of of god
[1:10:08] the pre-incarnate christ came down in
[1:10:11] abraham's day
[1:10:13] and he would touch the soil and gather
[1:10:16] the necessary elements
[1:10:18] to make a body for himself and two
[1:10:21] angels and they stepped into them
[1:10:24] now i want you to i want you just to
[1:10:26] visualize
[1:10:27] they come from light they came from the
[1:10:31] light
[1:10:31] and stepped into this dimension
[1:10:35] and when they stepped into this
[1:10:36] dimension they touched soil
[1:10:38] and as they touched soil they drew from
[1:10:41] that the elements to make
[1:10:42] a human body and appear now as
[1:10:45] men before abraham
[1:10:49] amen now that shouldn't be too hard for
[1:10:52] you to grasp
[1:10:54] if you got the holy ghost that yes
[1:10:57] because the
[1:10:58] the pillar of fire the holy ghost
[1:11:00] hovered over your
[1:11:01] soil one day and a portion of that holy
[1:11:05] spirit
[1:11:06] came in your life amen
[1:11:09] so when when abraham and sarah are
[1:11:12] standing before the lord
[1:11:14] it is at that time that sarah now is
[1:11:16] investigated
[1:11:18] and and her heart is discerned and
[1:11:21] it is found that she is lacking faith
[1:11:26] now now again because this is what
[1:11:29] he will do when he comes he will
[1:11:32] investigate
[1:11:33] or look to find faith that's the number
[1:11:36] one thing
[1:11:37] that he's one to he wants a bride a
[1:11:40] church that believes him are you with me
[1:11:44] that believes his word above theologians
[1:11:48] above our denominational ideas that
[1:11:51] exalts the bible over the
[1:11:53] trends of the day are you with me
[1:11:56] they take the word of god and they
[1:11:58] believe that word with
[1:12:00] all of their heart they stick their
[1:12:01] lives on it
[1:12:03] amen and so again again this
[1:12:06] is what jesus said when well you know
[1:12:08] will i find
[1:12:09] faith in my investigation when i come
[1:12:14] so if you're turning you'll see he spake
[1:12:16] a parable to them
[1:12:18] and to this end that men ought to always
[1:12:21] pray
[1:12:22] and not to faint now he gives us this to
[1:12:25] teach us
[1:12:26] don't quit praying and don't give up on
[1:12:29] a promise
[1:12:30] if you're wanting a promise from god if
[1:12:32] there's something that you need from god
[1:12:34] don't give up if you're seeking the holy
[1:12:36] ghost don't quit
[1:12:37] amen if you're seeking healing keep
[1:12:39] pounding at the door
[1:12:41] keep knocking keep on seeking and then
[1:12:43] keep them asking
[1:12:45] if your children are lost don't give up
[1:12:47] on them
[1:12:48] you keep on knocking you keep on
[1:12:50] believing
[1:12:51] you got somebody sick in your family in
[1:12:53] the church or whatever
[1:12:55] you don't give up on a promise
[1:12:58] so he tells us i'm saying that
[1:13:01] there was a in a city a judge which
[1:13:04] feared not god neither regarded man
[1:13:07] there was a widow in that city and she
[1:13:10] came unto him
[1:13:11] say it offends me of mine enemies or my
[1:13:14] adversary and he would
[1:13:15] not for a while but afterwards he said
[1:13:18] within himself
[1:13:19] though i fear not god nor regard men
[1:13:22] yet because this widow troubleth me
[1:13:25] i will avenge her lest by her continual
[1:13:28] coming
[1:13:29] she weary me and the lord said
[1:13:32] hear what the unjust judge said shall
[1:13:35] not
[1:13:35] god avenge his own elect
[1:13:38] which cried day and night into him
[1:13:41] though he bear along with them
[1:13:42] i tell you he will avenge them speedily
[1:13:46] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:13:48] shall he find
[1:13:49] faith he is going to be
[1:13:53] looking for faith listen if he says
[1:13:56] shall i find faith this is what he's
[1:13:58] looking for
[1:14:00] he is investigating hearts
[1:14:04] to find somebody that will believe him
[1:14:07] somebody that'll give the word
[1:14:09] preeminence
[1:14:10] now this translation says it this way
[1:14:13] then the master said
[1:14:15] do you hear what the judge corrupt as he
[1:14:17] is is saying
[1:14:19] so what makes you think god won't step
[1:14:21] in and work justice
[1:14:23] for his chosen people who continue to
[1:14:25] cry out for help
[1:14:27] won't he stick up for them i assure you
[1:14:29] he will
[1:14:31] he will not drag his feet but how much
[1:14:34] of that kind of persistent faith
[1:14:37] will the son of man find on the earth
[1:14:39] when he returns
[1:14:41] persistent faith not easy believism
[1:14:46] persistent faith people who won't quit
[1:14:51] amen people who won't give up
[1:14:54] to people who will not let go of the
[1:14:57] promise
[1:14:58] but they're going to see it manifested
[1:15:00] in their lives
[1:15:01] are you with me amen now as i have been
[1:15:04] through things
[1:15:05] in the past and i want to just bring it
[1:15:07] out again to you
[1:15:09] again today god will do extreme things
[1:15:12] to get you to believe amen
[1:15:15] this angel is real and he'll go out to
[1:15:18] all out
[1:15:19] to get a people believing hallelujah
[1:15:23] i believe that as um
[1:15:26] as as it was with brother branham
[1:15:29] visited south africa
[1:15:31] and i and i'm just going to show you the
[1:15:33] the how god will go out
[1:15:35] all out to do things there was a couple
[1:15:37] of brothers that were talking they were
[1:15:40] uh they were dutch reform ministers and
[1:15:44] and um and they were um
[1:15:47] they were there in south africa and they
[1:15:50] they were arguing with one another
[1:15:52] about the meetings and and um one was
[1:15:55] one was calling the you know brother
[1:15:57] branham he's just a spiritualist and
[1:15:59] he's nothing but a spiritualist and the
[1:16:01] other man um was
[1:16:03] was on the on the other side of the
[1:16:06] argument he was saying no
[1:16:08] this is our day of visitation and we sit
[1:16:11] here and you should hear this
[1:16:13] and and and so he said well he ain't
[1:16:16] nothing but a spiritualist
[1:16:17] and he said well did you ever see a
[1:16:19] spiritualist heal the sick
[1:16:21] he said no he said well i'll tell you
[1:16:22] what you know
[1:16:24] you're you're such a in a sinful
[1:16:27] unbelieving condition
[1:16:28] i'll just go out and pray for your lost
[1:16:30] soul and he got down in the backyard and
[1:16:32] knelt down under
[1:16:34] a tree and began to pray and say god had
[1:16:37] mercy on my friend's soul
[1:16:39] and when he did down before him came
[1:16:42] the angel of the lord in a whirl and as
[1:16:45] it moved
[1:16:46] this angel came and laid his hand on his
[1:16:49] shoulder
[1:16:50] and told him to return back to his
[1:16:52] friend
[1:16:53] and there when when he when he got
[1:16:56] together with his friend
[1:16:58] and and there and he told him about the
[1:17:00] angel's visitation
[1:17:02] and that this was their day of
[1:17:04] visitation then the
[1:17:05] then the the man looked and on the man
[1:17:08] on his back where the angel
[1:17:10] had touched him was the scorch print of
[1:17:12] the angel's hand
[1:17:14] laying on his shirt that's what i'm
[1:17:17] saying god will do some extreme things
[1:17:19] sometimes
[1:17:20] to get us to believe god's going to have
[1:17:23] somebody
[1:17:24] in this day who will believe him
[1:17:28] amen are you with me amen he'll do
[1:17:31] whatever he has to do to turn the hearts
[1:17:33] of the children
[1:17:34] back to the faith of the fathers if he
[1:17:36] asked her
[1:17:37] and he did raise up a prophet in the
[1:17:39] spirit and the power of elias
[1:17:43] amen now he wasn't elijah but he was in
[1:17:45] the spirit of elijah
[1:17:47] which was the anointing of christ upon
[1:17:49] him for a prophetic work
[1:17:51] are you with me and man god does some
[1:17:54] things
[1:17:55] very very drastic sometimes just like
[1:17:58] what happened
[1:17:58] in the meetings there in fort wayne
[1:18:00] indiana where a lady was playing on the
[1:18:03] piano the great position
[1:18:04] now is near the sympathizing jesus
[1:18:08] as the prayer line was going through and
[1:18:10] they handed brother branham a hideously
[1:18:12] crippled up twisted up child who's had
[1:18:16] club feet and
[1:18:17] and limbs were twisted and brother
[1:18:20] branham stood and held
[1:18:21] clutched that child to his bosom and
[1:18:23] began to pray
[1:18:25] over that child and as he did there was
[1:18:28] a bright
[1:18:29] light that got shown on him and he
[1:18:32] actually in his human thoughts said this
[1:18:35] is very rude you know for the
[1:18:37] custodian to turn a light on like that
[1:18:39] from on me
[1:18:40] and blind me like this and then and
[1:18:44] he opened his eyes to see um
[1:18:47] the light and it was the pillar of fire
[1:18:49] that was
[1:18:50] hanging over him and he was he was so
[1:18:53] um it was so shocked there in that
[1:18:56] moment
[1:18:56] he dropped the child and the child took
[1:18:59] off and running
[1:19:01] his limbs untwisted and ran across the
[1:19:04] platform
[1:19:05] and this little girl i don't know what
[1:19:07] religion she was she was protestant of
[1:19:09] some sort but
[1:19:10] she was sitting there playing the piano
[1:19:12] and as she
[1:19:13] watched that child run across the
[1:19:16] platform
[1:19:16] she chipped up and began to lift her
[1:19:19] hands
[1:19:20] and began to dance in the spirit over
[1:19:22] the over the platform
[1:19:24] and the piano never missed a beat
[1:19:27] continually playing
[1:19:28] the great physician now is near the
[1:19:31] sympathizing jesus
[1:19:33] what is it god doing everything he can
[1:19:37] to let you know i am the god present
[1:19:40] for you in your situation i am the
[1:19:43] sympathizing jesus i'm the great
[1:19:45] physician
[1:19:46] remember that there's nothing too hard
[1:19:48] for the lord no matter how twisted up
[1:19:51] how crippled how the how deformed that
[1:19:54] you are
[1:19:55] this god nothing's too hard for him
[1:19:58] in one moment he can change your life
[1:20:01] [Applause]
[1:20:02] forever
[1:20:09] it was these things that brought us to
[1:20:12] the realization
[1:20:14] and the recognition of the unseen world
[1:20:19] that we were blinded to because of
[1:20:23] sin amen we were born in sin
[1:20:27] shape and iniquity because of that we
[1:20:30] were
[1:20:32] we we were lacking that vision or that
[1:20:35] ability to see
[1:20:37] that realm of angels
[1:20:42] that unseen realm of the realm
[1:20:46] of angels that unseen realm
[1:20:50] of the power of god now
[1:20:54] and so but god was wanting to bring to
[1:20:57] us
[1:20:59] the reality of the unseen world
[1:21:03] even to the point that brother branham
[1:21:05] would be told by the angel
[1:21:07] you know that your thoughts are louder
[1:21:10] in heaven
[1:21:11] than your words are on earth
[1:21:14] so then that god knows every thought he
[1:21:18] hears
[1:21:18] every prayer this is why so often you
[1:21:21] know
[1:21:22] i saw you you were there you were
[1:21:24] sitting on the sofa
[1:21:25] you were looking out the window and as
[1:21:27] you there you were praying
[1:21:29] oh god somehow if i could get in that
[1:21:31] prayer line
[1:21:33] and would repeat back the prayers that
[1:21:36] they had
[1:21:37] because god heard those prayers god was
[1:21:40] wanting you to know he's a personal
[1:21:42] god and that you are receiving a
[1:21:45] visitation
[1:21:46] this is the day of his visitation we're
[1:21:50] living in that time
[1:21:51] now you know it was in 1946
[1:21:55] and we have been through this before but
[1:21:56] just to remind you again
[1:21:59] um 1946 where that
[1:22:02] in the meetings of brother branham's
[1:22:04] there where um
[1:22:05] it it prophecy rang out twice that year
[1:22:09] once in san antonio and another in
[1:22:12] another place
[1:22:13] where tongues and interpretation went
[1:22:15] forth
[1:22:16] and it was a stern message that was
[1:22:19] given and both of them were almost
[1:22:21] identical
[1:22:23] and they were given a a testimony of
[1:22:27] the authenticity of this of the ministry
[1:22:30] of brother branham
[1:22:31] and it was uttered with such a rousing
[1:22:34] force
[1:22:35] they said that it just seemed unearthly
[1:22:38] this is
[1:22:38] way that they described it and yet this
[1:22:42] was the
[1:22:43] the message as john the baptist was sent
[1:22:46] to war on the first coming of christ
[1:22:48] you're sent with a message to forerun
[1:22:51] the second
[1:22:52] coming of christ you see it was things
[1:22:55] like that
[1:22:56] again that this would be echoed again as
[1:22:59] i said in tulsa
[1:23:00] oklahoma by by sister anna schrader
[1:23:04] not neither none of these had heard of
[1:23:06] that none of them had heard
[1:23:07] of the light coming down and speaking
[1:23:10] and saying as john the baptist was set
[1:23:13] to forerun the first coming of christ
[1:23:15] as brother branham was baptizing in on
[1:23:17] the ohio river
[1:23:18] in 1933 none of them had heard of this
[1:23:21] but
[1:23:22] now god was even speaking through the
[1:23:25] pentecostal people
[1:23:26] amen to rouse them to stir them to make
[1:23:29] them realize
[1:23:30] you know god was doing some very
[1:23:34] extreme things amen we could testify of
[1:23:38] t.o osborne who would say the same that
[1:23:40] he said i didn't know the voice had
[1:23:42] spoke these words
[1:23:44] i knew nothing of that i had not been
[1:23:46] with any of the other ministers that
[1:23:48] believed in
[1:23:49] in him but because most that i was with
[1:23:51] did not believe in him with in him
[1:23:53] but like a voice yet not a voice i heard
[1:23:56] it
[1:23:57] it came to me as john the baptist was
[1:24:00] sent as a force a writer of his first
[1:24:02] coming
[1:24:03] william branham is a forerunner of his
[1:24:05] second coming
[1:24:09] amen now how can we be accused
[1:24:15] of making brother branham elijah are
[1:24:18] calling him elijah
[1:24:20] when if he went forth into power
[1:24:23] like john the baptist who went forth in
[1:24:26] the spirit and the power of elijah
[1:24:29] they themselves had to testify
[1:24:33] you see god was doing things
[1:24:36] that was phenomenal i i've been through
[1:24:38] it where you would take a
[1:24:40] a a young boy little david walker
[1:24:43] and and call him out in a ministry and
[1:24:46] give him a supernatural
[1:24:48] ministry it was an era of time where god
[1:24:51] was preparing hearts
[1:24:53] and been trying again one more time i
[1:24:56] want to get it to you
[1:24:57] not just to heal the sick and god show
[1:24:59] his power but for
[1:25:01] him to be able to restore
[1:25:04] a faith in a faithless older woman
[1:25:08] the church like who had given up on the
[1:25:12] promise
[1:25:14] are you with me who were who was no
[1:25:16] longer truly expecting the coming of the
[1:25:19] lord
[1:25:20] and i'll tell you if there was ever a
[1:25:22] people that was under anticipation
[1:25:24] for the coming of the lord it is our
[1:25:27] generation
[1:25:28] because god has done phenomenal
[1:25:31] extraordinary
[1:25:32] extreme things to get us on of course so
[1:25:36] we would believe
[1:25:44] just one more i would mention john
[1:25:48] jack coe's faith how it was anointed
[1:25:52] and man you know jack cole was an
[1:25:56] assembly of god preacher he's just doing
[1:25:59] his own little evangelistic work and
[1:26:01] you know he hear him talking he said you
[1:26:03] know we kind of figured if it wasn't us
[1:26:05] it wasn't nobody so
[1:26:06] he said but he began to hear of these
[1:26:08] phenomenal things and decided to go to
[1:26:10] the meeting
[1:26:12] and and uh and he said i
[1:26:16] sat there as a skeptic
[1:26:19] you know i i as brother branham looked
[1:26:21] at a man
[1:26:23] who was blind with no eyeballs
[1:26:26] and and he told him in three days
[1:26:28] eyeballs will form
[1:26:30] and after that you'll see and then jack
[1:26:34] scoff said you know anybody can
[1:26:36] say that you know this man had
[1:26:38] disappeared out in the crowd
[1:26:39] and he's a big thousands of people there
[1:26:42] and
[1:26:43] you know we'll never see him again how
[1:26:45] will we know he ever
[1:26:46] gets eyesight and so as he sat there and
[1:26:51] brother branham starts to leave the
[1:26:53] platform at the end of the service
[1:26:55] he walks by jack cole and he pats him on
[1:26:58] the leg and
[1:26:59] and he says um or on the knees said
[1:27:02] you're not sick
[1:27:04] you're just worn down from preaching
[1:27:06] meetings said don't be skeptical
[1:27:08] you were doubting whether this is a god
[1:27:10] and whatnot i want to tell you this is
[1:27:11] of god we're both fighting the same
[1:27:13] devil
[1:27:14] go and continue in your revival for you
[1:27:16] also we're called to pray for the sick
[1:27:19] and on the third day jack went back to
[1:27:22] the meeting
[1:27:23] because he wanted to check out this man
[1:27:26] and he found this man and by that time
[1:27:28] eyeballs had formed in his eyes but he
[1:27:30] still couldn't see
[1:27:31] but by evening he was seeing and he was
[1:27:34] shouting all over the place
[1:27:36] but the glories of god and even jack
[1:27:39] would have to admit
[1:27:40] and no he said william branham was born
[1:27:43] for dispensational purposes
[1:27:46] amen and i'm gonna just tell you and
[1:27:48] remind you we
[1:27:49] cannot afford to go to sleep in this
[1:27:51] hour
[1:27:53] amen god has spoken out particularly for
[1:27:55] your day
[1:27:56] and your hour to awaken your faith
[1:28:00] amen god's doing extreme things to let
[1:28:04] you
[1:28:04] know that you are in the cycle in the
[1:28:07] very
[1:28:08] hour of his coming amen
[1:28:11] then how can we just sit complacent
[1:28:14] amen how can you treat these moments
[1:28:17] just like they were another moment in
[1:28:19] time
[1:28:19] this is not just another moment in time
[1:28:22] this is where god's doing extreme things
[1:28:26] moving in extreme ways
[1:28:29] [Music]
[1:28:31] i just want to say to you how can you
[1:28:34] dare
[1:28:34] let the devil destroy your home
[1:28:38] and your marriage how do you dare how
[1:28:42] dare you to
[1:28:43] just go up down television and movies
[1:28:46] and
[1:28:46] and worship sports gods and spends hours
[1:28:49] in pornography or
[1:28:51] playing useless video games
[1:28:55] that steal your time when we were told
[1:28:58] to redeem the time the day is evil
[1:29:01] how can you just settle down as
[1:29:04] complacent as though
[1:29:05] this is just another hagar move where
[1:29:10] another denominational move just produce
[1:29:12] another wild child
[1:29:13] and you know everything go back to
[1:29:15] normal sarah's never going to receive
[1:29:17] that promise
[1:29:18] on the whole jesus is not coming back
[1:29:20] not in our generation
[1:29:23] and i ask you could god have made a
[1:29:26] mistake
[1:29:28] this god who time after time showed how
[1:29:31] accurate his word could be
[1:29:34] could it be that this age could get
[1:29:37] so faithless the time so evil
[1:29:40] that laodicea would get so bad
[1:29:44] and even the majority of the aids would
[1:29:47] put him
[1:29:48] outside the church and god then would
[1:29:51] simply just have to give up on his
[1:29:53] divine plans and
[1:29:55] go back in the heavens and forget it all
[1:29:57] and just become
[1:29:58] the absentee creator of the earth
[1:30:02] could it be that god made a mistake
[1:30:04] saying this was his forerunner
[1:30:06] of his second coming i'm just going to
[1:30:09] say there is no mistake in the word
[1:30:12] god sent a forerunner to prepare hearts
[1:30:15] for the coming of the lord
[1:30:16] and it must prepare your heart
[1:30:21] amen you must be one that opens your
[1:30:23] heart to it and say
[1:30:25] god prepare me and as a church body we
[1:30:28] ought to be ones who open our hearts and
[1:30:30] say
[1:30:31] god prepare this church
[1:30:34] for the coming of jesus christ remember
[1:30:38] he said i will return to you
[1:30:40] according to the time of life you know
[1:30:43] yesterday
[1:30:44] i listened to the first 10 chapters of
[1:30:47] luke
[1:30:48] like today like we are in this age
[1:30:53] an angel came but this angel's name was
[1:30:57] gabriel
[1:30:58] and he came to zechariah and they told
[1:31:01] him he was to have a son
[1:31:03] and when he was told this he immediately
[1:31:06] doubted and questioned the angel
[1:31:08] are you with me amen and he was struck
[1:31:11] dumb
[1:31:12] until the the baby was born i'm going to
[1:31:14] tell you god doesn't
[1:31:16] like it when we disbelieve
[1:31:19] amen and i i and i just said god shut my
[1:31:23] mouth
[1:31:24] keep me from sin and uttered any
[1:31:26] unbelief
[1:31:28] whatever lord i i don't want to be a a
[1:31:31] part of a faithless generation
[1:31:34] amen now he would he would command him
[1:31:37] said now you're going to bring forth a
[1:31:38] son
[1:31:39] and he is never to take wine or other
[1:31:41] form fermented drink well i couldn't
[1:31:44] help but think
[1:31:46] of the last day forerunner who like john
[1:31:48] the baptist was told by a voice
[1:31:51] in a whirlwind and a tree at seven years
[1:31:53] old never drink
[1:31:55] or smoke or defile your body in any way
[1:31:58] for i have a work for you
[1:32:00] to do when you're older amen
[1:32:04] what a messenger that god would prepare
[1:32:08] him
[1:32:08] in such a way that he wouldn't be
[1:32:10] educated by men
[1:32:12] he didn't even come with a high school
[1:32:14] education
[1:32:15] let alone a degree from a university
[1:32:18] and why is why do you think that's so
[1:32:20] great brother tim why do you exalt that
[1:32:22] thought
[1:32:23] how come you don't like to rest the
[1:32:25] world look down on it this man had poor
[1:32:27] grammar and this man
[1:32:29] was uneducated and this man because
[1:32:32] this man instead of being dependent on
[1:32:35] his learning from the from the
[1:32:38] university
[1:32:39] from from the religious theology
[1:32:43] amen he had to be dependent upon the
[1:32:46] angel for his knowledge
[1:32:50] that's why that's why that even his
[1:32:53] advice
[1:32:54] shouldn't be discounted
[1:32:58] amen even some of the inside you said
[1:33:01] well that was his opinion i'll tell you
[1:33:03] when you realize a man's opinion many
[1:33:06] times
[1:33:06] is based on a spiritual revelation
[1:33:11] so then you've got to be really careful
[1:33:13] about how you discount
[1:33:16] things that are said are you with me
[1:33:20] and i couldn't help but think of mary
[1:33:22] where uh where an
[1:33:23] angel came to her the angel gabriel
[1:33:27] looking for a virgin
[1:33:30] remember he was looking for a virgin
[1:33:35] and and one that would believe
[1:33:38] in the creation of god that she could
[1:33:41] have a
[1:33:41] child by creation without knowing a man
[1:33:46] now i'm going to tell you this was even
[1:33:47] more difficult than what
[1:33:49] that what uh sarah had to believe sarah
[1:33:52] had to believe that she's 90 years old
[1:33:54] could give birth to a child
[1:33:56] amen but this woman had to believe
[1:33:59] that she would have a child without even
[1:34:01] knowing a man
[1:34:04] and god in this day is looking for a
[1:34:07] virtuous people a virgin
[1:34:10] people not polluted by men's ideas
[1:34:15] amen who will who can believe
[1:34:18] that god will actually bring back and
[1:34:22] fulfill his word
[1:34:23] and that there will be a change of the
[1:34:26] body there will be a meeting in the air
[1:34:28] there will be a rapture for a church
[1:34:37] and it's going to happen with angels
[1:34:44] appearing
[1:34:46] not only an angel but your angel
[1:34:50] your theophany appearing to you
[1:34:57] it's going to happen to people who are
[1:34:59] familiar with the pillar of fire
[1:35:03] with that holy light of god
[1:35:07] moving down among them that knows their
[1:35:10] hearts
[1:35:11] that knows their thoughts that knows
[1:35:14] whether or not
[1:35:15] they're got faith or not
[1:35:19] now it's the investigating judgment
[1:35:25] once again where the angel is seeking
[1:35:27] out someone
[1:35:28] who is a virgin not a part of the whole
[1:35:31] horror system
[1:35:33] unpolluted by the seed of an and
[1:35:35] theology of man but a woman a bride
[1:35:38] who will bring forth children of the
[1:35:40] word and finally bring forth christ back
[1:35:43] to the earth again
[1:35:45] now so god does some extreme things
[1:35:49] to get you to believe amen to
[1:35:53] and he it goes extreme to give us
[1:35:55] examples
[1:35:56] of what god will do in the end time he
[1:35:59] would take
[1:36:00] sarah now who is past 90
[1:36:03] he would wait until she has passed 90.
[1:36:07] why not do this when she's a young girl
[1:36:10] i'll give you a child you're going to
[1:36:12] have a child and his name is isaac and
[1:36:15] why not give it to him when she's a
[1:36:17] young lady and a
[1:36:18] full spring in her step and she can i
[1:36:21] have many many years with this boy and
[1:36:24] and everything anyway she waits god
[1:36:27] waits till she's
[1:36:28] impossible
[1:36:32] god waits till she's 90.
[1:36:36] and she's shall bury
[1:36:39] now why does he do that again it's a
[1:36:41] prophecy
[1:36:43] it's speaking of the last day where he
[1:36:46] would
[1:36:46] demonstrate to us his power once again
[1:36:49] and he's chosen in the type with sarah
[1:36:52] that and he and he wants us to
[1:36:54] understand that there is
[1:36:56] nothing too hard for the lord
[1:37:01] now sarah of course didn't have the
[1:37:04] faith but that's why he came
[1:37:10] because he's got to have faith
[1:37:15] now let me explain something to you god
[1:37:18] said i'll have a bride without spot or
[1:37:19] wrinkle or blemish
[1:37:21] he says there will be a rapture
[1:37:25] amen now if there's a people unprepared
[1:37:28] for it
[1:37:29] that don't change what he's saying he's
[1:37:31] still going to have rapture
[1:37:33] and his glove was still going to have a
[1:37:34] people without spot or wrinkle or
[1:37:36] blemish
[1:37:37] he will take a he will have a bride that
[1:37:40] that is a spotless bride who will be
[1:37:42] united to him
[1:37:44] and if there isn't one he'll create one
[1:37:48] he'll bring a message his own word and
[1:37:50] create a bride
[1:37:52] a people for his namesake are you with
[1:37:55] me
[1:37:56] because again he's showing us there is
[1:37:59] nothing too hard for the lord
[1:38:03] but you're in laodicea brother tim
[1:38:05] you're in the last day where the rich
[1:38:07] increased with goods and
[1:38:09] have needed nothing and are wretched and
[1:38:11] miserable blind and poor and naked
[1:38:13] and self-centered on their own a
[1:38:16] religious way yet
[1:38:17] religious people and going about their
[1:38:19] way
[1:38:21] and it's going to be impossible but is
[1:38:23] there anything too hard for the lord
[1:38:27] now when he comes and he doesn't find
[1:38:30] the faith
[1:38:32] then he brings a visitation
[1:38:35] in order to give that faith
[1:38:41] that means that's why the angel's always
[1:38:44] shaking you
[1:38:46] move away from that unbelief move into
[1:38:49] god
[1:38:51] i want to i want to increase your faith
[1:38:53] i want to raise it up another level
[1:38:56] amen this is what brother branham would
[1:38:58] do many times with his gift
[1:39:00] he said now the gift doesn't heal it
[1:39:02] just raises your faith
[1:39:04] to a higher level so you can receive
[1:39:07] the promise and that's what god would
[1:39:10] have to do in this last day
[1:39:12] he would have to raise the faith of a
[1:39:14] people
[1:39:16] into a rapturing faith
[1:39:20] somebody with me now
[1:39:23] this of course nothing would happen
[1:39:26] until sarah quit looking at herself
[1:39:31] and she kept looking you know there
[1:39:34] there again it's a secret to
[1:39:36] sickness that you're you look at the
[1:39:38] sickness you see how bad it is
[1:39:40] how bad of i am or how how you know
[1:39:43] this is something i could never get over
[1:39:45] nobody's ever had a case like mine or
[1:39:48] is it you know i'll never get well i've
[1:39:50] had this 15 years or
[1:39:52] i've done this and i've done that and
[1:39:54] i've tried this and i've tried that
[1:39:56] you know as long as you're looking at
[1:39:58] yourself
[1:40:04] but here in hebrews 11 11 it gives us a
[1:40:07] key
[1:40:08] sarah herself received strength
[1:40:12] to concede seed and was delivered of a
[1:40:14] child when she was past 8
[1:40:16] when she judged him faithful
[1:40:20] who had promised now she could look back
[1:40:24] at herself and see where she had been
[1:40:26] faithful to believe
[1:40:28] come on but now she got her eyes over
[1:40:32] herself
[1:40:33] and that she's 90 and how impossible it
[1:40:36] is
[1:40:37] come on hey man where she even laughed
[1:40:40] within herself and kind of
[1:40:42] you know you know mocked at me an old
[1:40:44] woman
[1:40:45] you don't have pleasure does this man
[1:40:47] not know how old i am
[1:40:51] you know i'm past 90 and i have pleasure
[1:40:54] with my lord and he's old also
[1:40:57] amen but when she turned from
[1:41:01] her problem
[1:41:04] and look to him and judge him faithful
[1:41:10] hey man you know sometimes you get to
[1:41:12] look at faults and you can look at
[1:41:14] situations
[1:41:15] you can look at your own shortcomings
[1:41:17] and how will god ever get a
[1:41:19] bride out of this mess well if you can
[1:41:23] turn your eyes off of
[1:41:24] the trouble around you and i'll be leo
[1:41:27] to see you
[1:41:28] and the world around you and put your
[1:41:30] eyes back on jesus
[1:41:32] amen and realize there is nothing that
[1:41:34] is too hard for the lord
[1:41:36] and he'll do everything he can to get
[1:41:39] me believing
[1:41:45] will i find faith is his question
[1:41:50] if he's finding he's investigating
[1:41:54] looking for faith
[1:41:57] betty daughtery she was one of the first
[1:42:00] healed
[1:42:01] in the early campaigns brother branham
[1:42:04] went to
[1:42:05] brother daughery's church it's a
[1:42:08] it was a long story but they thought at
[1:42:10] the time she had saint vitus dance
[1:42:14] doctors had given up on her didn't know
[1:42:16] what it was
[1:42:18] and finally come down to brother branham
[1:42:21] had a vision
[1:42:23] and in that vision he would see her
[1:42:26] a little a little child some couple of
[1:42:29] years before
[1:42:31] and she was playing around an old cellar
[1:42:34] and she tripped and fell hit her back
[1:42:37] on a stone and knocked a vertebrae
[1:42:41] way out of condition in her back and
[1:42:44] and he he he was told just
[1:42:48] take there and and and as he they prayed
[1:42:52] he just pressed down on that spot and it
[1:42:54] went right take there
[1:42:56] and and and as he they prayed he just
[1:42:59] pressed down on that spot
[1:43:00] and it went right down the spine went
[1:43:03] right back into place again
[1:43:04] and the child was healed and this is one
[1:43:07] of the very first things where the
[1:43:10] visions were
[1:43:11] were being manifested now
[1:43:14] but sometimes later when she is now a
[1:43:18] young woman
[1:43:19] she again has got a some sort of
[1:43:22] affliction i don't know what it is is
[1:43:24] something else
[1:43:27] but when she comes in the prayer line
[1:43:29] and and as i was with moses and he says
[1:43:32] he says to her betty he said
[1:43:36] you've grown up in your beautiful girl
[1:43:39] and he says but now is there anything
[1:43:42] down in your life that you've failed
[1:43:44] betty
[1:43:46] now just as a doctor would look over
[1:43:48] your physical body
[1:43:51] i want to look through your soul
[1:43:56] have you failed god anywhere betty if
[1:43:58] there
[1:43:59] is just acknowledge it to him lord
[1:44:02] if you'll let me go over it again i'll
[1:44:04] do different
[1:44:06] all right think of that
[1:44:10] now here again she she is now an older
[1:44:14] girl now she's at the age
[1:44:15] pass the age of accountability now she's
[1:44:18] a young adult and
[1:44:20] she's done something and she pulls him
[1:44:23] he pulls brother branham aside and
[1:44:24] whispers something in his ears
[1:44:26] and they have prayer together but you
[1:44:30] see
[1:44:30] again i want to get it as a doctor
[1:44:34] he said would look on your physical body
[1:44:38] i will look down into your soul
[1:44:42] have you failed god anywhere
[1:44:45] now that pillar of fire still has that
[1:44:48] same ability
[1:44:51] to look right down into the very soul of
[1:44:53] a man or a woman
[1:44:56] and discern the very thoughts and the
[1:44:58] intents that the intentions
[1:45:00] of the
[1:45:07] and that same angel of god has ways to
[1:45:11] speak
[1:45:11] and convict and to convince you of sin
[1:45:15] and especially if you have the holy
[1:45:17] ghost because that's one of the signs
[1:45:20] of the indwelling spirit he will convict
[1:45:22] you of sin
[1:45:28] and i'll just say if you can sin and
[1:45:29] just get on by with it
[1:45:32] you're missing something very important
[1:45:34] in your life
[1:45:38] look down into the soul
[1:45:43] not just see you know that's this is the
[1:45:46] way the judgment is going to be
[1:45:48] the great white throne judgment
[1:45:52] now maybe i'm carnal but this is the way
[1:45:55] i view it this
[1:45:56] way i mean it'll be eternally eternity
[1:46:00] sometimes you know wouldn't it be neat
[1:46:03] just to sit back for
[1:46:06] for for a time where there's no time but
[1:46:10] for um
[1:46:13] this opportunity to start back with god
[1:46:17] as he and maybe some of it he would fast
[1:46:20] forward it to bring it down
[1:46:22] to the millions of years as it moves
[1:46:25] from the invisible god to a visible form
[1:46:28] of the logos and lugos
[1:46:30] to begin to do his work and brood over
[1:46:33] the earth and bring up the creation
[1:46:35] and move along like that and then
[1:46:38] finally it's going to come down to your
[1:46:39] time
[1:46:45] and some of you we will see this very
[1:46:48] service
[1:46:49] play back again
[1:46:54] and we will see what you did with the
[1:46:57] word
[1:46:58] this time what was done in secret will
[1:47:01] be shouted from the housetop
[1:47:05] this time not just your not just your
[1:47:09] actions will be there but your motive
[1:47:13] what was really in your heart
[1:47:16] will be displayed and it'll be displaced
[1:47:20] for the whole world
[1:47:21] and you'll see yourself walk right back
[1:47:24] into the church again
[1:47:26] and replay scene after scene actually
[1:47:29] i'm telling you you let me tell you i
[1:47:31] will not have to judge you and condemn
[1:47:33] you to hell
[1:47:34] god will not have to do it your own sins
[1:47:45] because god would show us through this
[1:47:46] prophet
[1:47:48] that everything is recorded he would go
[1:47:51] back
[1:47:51] 40 years in life and say look
[1:47:55] i saw it it was a black dog he got after
[1:47:58] you he scared you
[1:48:00] ever since this you've been this way you
[1:48:02] barely made it into the
[1:48:04] house the screen door just slammed
[1:48:06] behind you
[1:48:07] and this and it scared you it's a scare
[1:48:10] and it started a complex in your life
[1:48:15] it's all recorded
[1:48:18] so it's one great video but it contains
[1:48:22] more than what we see now
[1:48:26] it contains your thoughts your
[1:48:30] intentions
[1:48:32] that's what the judgment's going to be
[1:48:34] you your
[1:48:35] own actions will the bible say they'll
[1:48:37] be judged for
[1:48:38] the by the deeds done in their body
[1:48:43] amen now that's that's going to be
[1:48:45] serious and i'll tell you how serious it
[1:48:47] is
[1:48:47] brother brandon said let my belly be cut
[1:48:50] open
[1:48:50] and let sulfur be burned in it he said
[1:48:54] but don't let me stand is that white
[1:48:55] throwing judgment
[1:49:01] now let me stop a minute let's talk
[1:49:04] about that just a second
[1:49:07] because it started when you were a
[1:49:09] little baby
[1:49:13] and it goes right on recording recording
[1:49:15] recording
[1:49:16] to the end of your life
[1:49:22] but i'm telling you for a believer
[1:49:26] there will be none of those acts there
[1:49:29] will be
[1:49:30] none of those sins there will be none of
[1:49:32] that to condemn you
[1:49:34] because the blood of christ will have
[1:49:36] been applied to your video
[1:49:42] and the only thing will be seen is your
[1:49:45] righteousness
[1:49:54] that's the only thing that has stopped
[1:49:56] that voice
[1:49:58] is the blood of jesus christ
[1:50:01] now you say brother tim that's sober and
[1:50:04] yeah
[1:50:05] it's going to be in like huge now you
[1:50:07] know just take
[1:50:08] right of here we got it wrote i will
[1:50:12] fear no evil for you are with me but
[1:50:15] what if that contained
[1:50:16] your thoughts of this past week
[1:50:22] you would feel very exposed
[1:50:26] to the psalms 23 4 joe adams
[1:50:35] you feel exposed that's where it's going
[1:50:37] to be at the judgment
[1:50:39] you will be totally exposed what is done
[1:50:42] in secret be
[1:50:43] shouted from the house up and there's
[1:50:45] only one thing
[1:50:47] that will cleanse the record
[1:50:50] well i'm glad to say the old account was
[1:50:53] settled
[1:50:53] long ago hallelujah i've been plunged in
[1:50:58] the blood
[1:51:00] and i'm gonna just tell you even and
[1:51:02] there it won't even be a blip
[1:51:04] won't even come to a spot and there's a
[1:51:06] blimp oh there was something done there
[1:51:08] but we don't know what it was it was
[1:51:09] covered
[1:51:09] no there won't be a flip that won't be a
[1:51:11] spread of it
[1:51:13] you'll say he's staggered now at the
[1:51:16] promise of god
[1:51:17] who was strong in faith giving praise to
[1:51:19] god
[1:51:26] will i find faith
[1:51:29] investigating judgment i'm taking too
[1:51:32] long on some of this
[1:51:34] i've got a long ways to go
[1:51:38] you know he said these gifts
[1:51:41] are only to show you what god's attitude
[1:51:44] toward the people
[1:51:46] to get you people back to believe in god
[1:51:50] because if you haven't got faith enough
[1:51:52] to believe for your sick body
[1:51:54] how are you going to have faith enough
[1:51:56] for a rapture
[1:51:58] he says jesus asked this question when i
[1:52:01] return to earth well i find
[1:52:03] faith there's got to be a great church
[1:52:05] full of faith
[1:52:06] and god sent these things down to
[1:52:08] stimulate faith
[1:52:09] to bring out faith to prove what faith
[1:52:11] is
[1:52:13] and so this is why god would do what
[1:52:15] he's done in our generation
[1:52:18] not just to show his power but he wanted
[1:52:20] to get you believing
[1:52:25] now again would he find faith
[1:52:28] knowing that that would be one thing
[1:52:30] that people would lay on
[1:52:31] or let go on hearing the also the holy
[1:52:35] spirit speak in these last days
[1:52:36] how these times would come men would
[1:52:39] have a form of godliness but deny the
[1:52:41] power
[1:52:41] lack of faith and we thank thee lord
[1:52:45] tonight because that in our hearts we
[1:52:47] feel
[1:52:48] we have just a little faith and help us
[1:52:50] lord that our faith might be
[1:52:52] increased tonight until it be so high so
[1:52:55] lost and complete to surrendered in
[1:52:58] christ
[1:52:59] until great until it be so high so lost
[1:53:02] and complete
[1:53:03] surrendered in christ until great and
[1:53:06] mighty works will
[1:53:07] be shown tonight forgive us of our
[1:53:09] shortcomings now
[1:53:10] and help us may the holy spirit just now
[1:53:13] the great
[1:53:14] officer of god here in the earth
[1:53:16] searching
[1:53:18] out for a pride for the lord jesus
[1:53:21] may he visit every heart here in a
[1:53:24] special way
[1:53:26] what the great officer
[1:53:29] of the holy spirit again
[1:53:33] i truly believe before the church can
[1:53:36] have a rapture
[1:53:37] it's got to have rapture in faith we
[1:53:40] cannot even have faith for divine
[1:53:42] healing let alone rapture in faith
[1:53:44] god have a faith in a change and quicken
[1:53:46] this body and be taken away
[1:53:48] i believe there's a church on its road
[1:53:50] tonight
[1:53:51] a power of the living god that men will
[1:53:54] speak the word here and there
[1:53:55] and in a flashlight lightning and the
[1:53:58] church is coming out not a psychologist
[1:54:00] not someone who's put on or make-believe
[1:54:03] but a real
[1:54:03] genuine anointed holy ghost called out
[1:54:06] church
[1:54:15] abraham and lot are shown in the wise
[1:54:19] and the foolish virgins
[1:54:21] there comes a separation time
[1:54:24] for a while they're gathered together
[1:54:26] for a while
[1:54:27] abraham and lot will walk together
[1:54:30] but there comes a time of separation
[1:54:34] one of them sanctified having a
[1:54:37] profession if you look with me
[1:54:39] um in second peter two and six
[1:54:43] you'll see this scripture and turning
[1:54:46] the cities of sodom and gomorrah into
[1:54:48] ashes
[1:54:49] condemned them with an overthrow and
[1:54:51] making them an example into those
[1:54:53] that actors should live ungodly and
[1:54:56] deliver
[1:54:57] just lot vexed with the filthy
[1:55:00] conversation of the wicked
[1:55:03] for that righteous man dwelling among
[1:55:06] them and seeing and hearing
[1:55:07] vexed his righteous soul from day to day
[1:55:11] with their unlawful deeds
[1:55:15] amen so you see he was a sanctified man
[1:55:19] a lot of sanctified he types the church
[1:55:22] who goes to the tribulation
[1:55:24] he was a man lacking the holy spirit
[1:55:27] but yet he was righteous it was
[1:55:29] something you know
[1:55:31] that he was inside him but invest him
[1:55:37] oh there's many of righteous people out
[1:55:40] there
[1:55:41] good sanctified wonderful people
[1:55:45] are you with me amen who today will wind
[1:55:48] up in the tribulation period
[1:55:50] who'll miss the rapture because lot
[1:55:53] never had the faith of abraham
[1:55:57] come on somebody amen he didn't stay
[1:56:00] with the promise
[1:56:01] but he drifted from it though he was a
[1:56:04] righteous man
[1:56:05] and though it vex him oh i tell you what
[1:56:08] how many people
[1:56:10] are through america today that are vexed
[1:56:13] at the sins that are being done
[1:56:17] you know that are troubled with with the
[1:56:19] way
[1:56:20] that our government is going and and
[1:56:23] running over the constitution and
[1:56:25] many other other things and there are
[1:56:27] vexed about it and they don't know what
[1:56:28] to do
[1:56:29] i mean if they're frustrated i mean
[1:56:32] they're frustrated about it
[1:56:36] and to think of it you can be justified
[1:56:38] without being sanctified you can be
[1:56:40] sanctified without having the holy ghost
[1:56:42] and
[1:56:42] being clean in a pure life in a form of
[1:56:45] godliness deny the power of healing
[1:56:47] speaking in tongues great gifts of god
[1:56:49] and every one of them right here in the
[1:56:50] bible
[1:56:53] there's your five virgins that had oil
[1:56:55] with their lamps wrapped in faith
[1:56:58] believe in all the signs wonders and
[1:57:00] prophecies
[1:57:01] and these five of that cut out of this
[1:57:03] remnant was taken away the rest
[1:57:05] were still virgins will not be lost if
[1:57:07] it goes through the tribulation period
[1:57:10] where there's weeping and wailing and
[1:57:11] gnashing of teeth
[1:57:15] so you know again he would say how can
[1:57:18] you have rapture in faith
[1:57:20] when we haven't got healing faith now
[1:57:23] he's not talking about
[1:57:24] you have been praying for something for
[1:57:25] 15 years and ain't got healed yet and
[1:57:27] you're
[1:57:28] hanging on to the promise and you don't
[1:57:29] have the faith he's talking about the
[1:57:31] church
[1:57:32] if i can't get to church to even believe
[1:57:35] for divine healing
[1:57:37] how am i ever going to get a people to
[1:57:39] believe for complete divine healing
[1:57:42] and their body be changed in a moment a
[1:57:44] twinkling of an eye
[1:57:45] which is a greater healing than a heart
[1:57:47] trouble even
[1:57:48] or cancer being taken away and if i
[1:57:52] can't get you to believing
[1:57:53] for that how am i going to get you to
[1:57:55] believe for something greater
[1:57:59] amen now
[1:58:02] so he says he says we're moving right
[1:58:06] now into another great age coming for
[1:58:08] the rapture of the church
[1:58:10] and this i believe we're living in the
[1:58:11] time of restoration of gifts it stumbled
[1:58:14] many of the divine churches it sent
[1:58:15] nazarenes backwards it made fanatics
[1:58:18] out of a lot of pentecostals but just
[1:58:20] the same god is moving right on
[1:58:22] bringing in the rapture and faith of his
[1:58:24] church that's right
[1:58:25] so tonight i represent that faith
[1:58:29] that faith that was once delivered to
[1:58:31] the saints in the way of a divine gift
[1:58:36] amen and i think we can say that he well
[1:58:39] represented
[1:58:40] that faith amen again
[1:58:43] in in the in this in the first seal
[1:58:46] there's something we've got a step
[1:58:47] farther
[1:58:48] we can't have enough faith for divine
[1:58:50] healing hardly we've got to have enough
[1:58:52] faith to be changed in the moment
[1:58:54] we swept up out of this earth
[1:59:00] oh he would look at the church compared
[1:59:03] to samson
[1:59:05] we got members but you're weak you lost
[1:59:07] your covenant with god
[1:59:12] got members got bigger muscles but
[1:59:14] where's the strength of the lord
[1:59:16] your big muscles won't meet the
[1:59:18] challenge of the hour the rapture and
[1:59:20] faith to drink the church
[1:59:21] out of this thing before the judgment
[1:59:23] strikes the earth
[1:59:25] don't we realize where we're at this is
[1:59:28] a
[1:59:28] challenge of the hour i mean we're
[1:59:30] preaching about
[1:59:31] divine healing and faith in the church
[1:59:35] and
[1:59:35] the power of god working in the church
[1:59:38] are you with me
[1:59:39] but let me tell you something friends
[1:59:41] it's got the challenge of the hour
[1:59:43] is not just divine healing faith but a
[1:59:46] raptured
[1:59:47] faith of people who will believe to the
[1:59:50] coming of the lord
[1:59:55] now what an hour this is
[1:59:58] he said someone asked me about the
[2:00:00] coming and the rapture
[2:00:02] we know we've lived the time out at the
[2:00:04] time of the rapture is at hand
[2:00:06] and we're looking for a rapture in faith
[2:00:08] that can pull the church together
[2:00:11] and give it some supernatural strength
[2:00:13] that can change these bodies
[2:00:15] that we can that we live in when we see
[2:00:17] a god
[2:00:18] that can raise the dead off the floor or
[2:00:21] out in the yard and bring him back to
[2:00:22] life again and
[2:00:23] present him before us when we see a god
[2:00:26] who can take a cancer
[2:00:28] let's eat a man to his shadow and raise
[2:00:30] them up to a strong healthy man
[2:00:32] that ought to give rapture and faith to
[2:00:34] the people
[2:00:35] that when that light flashes i want you
[2:00:37] to watch this word
[2:00:38] when the light flashes from the sky
[2:00:42] and the trumpet sounds the body of
[2:00:44] christ will be quickly gathered together
[2:00:46] and changed in a moment and taken to the
[2:00:49] heavens
[2:00:50] yes there's something that's got to
[2:00:52] happen
[2:00:54] and our intellectual theology ain't
[2:00:57] going to produce it
[2:01:01] this is why he says i want you built up
[2:01:04] in the holy oracles of god in the
[2:01:08] faith the faith of this hour the faith
[2:01:11] that's going to take
[2:01:12] more faith than ever was in any age
[2:01:16] this has to be raptured faith be taken
[2:01:19] up so we want you to believe
[2:01:21] that on all you've seen and heard the
[2:01:23] words you've heard preached
[2:01:25] the signs and wonders you have seen we
[2:01:27] want you to accumulate that all together
[2:01:30] in your heart and consider whether it's
[2:01:32] god or not
[2:01:35] let me just ask you is it god or isn't
[2:01:37] it god
[2:01:38] is it god to change your life or was
[2:01:41] wasn't it god
[2:01:44] amen it was a god that took some of you
[2:01:47] that were
[2:01:48] dope addicts went to jail for it
[2:01:52] amen and god transformed your life and
[2:01:55] made a new creature out of you
[2:01:57] is it good that would heal the cancer
[2:01:59] among us
[2:02:00] that would touch a crippled child that
[2:02:02] would open up the eyes of blind
[2:02:05] is it god would give hearing back to the
[2:02:07] death come on somebody
[2:02:09] amen we ought to then we ought to
[2:02:11] accumulate all of that in our heart
[2:02:12] together
[2:02:14] amen and consider is it god or not god
[2:02:17] and if it's god when we should do like
[2:02:19] elijah
[2:02:20] and he said if god be god didn't serve
[2:02:23] him
[2:02:23] [Applause]
[2:02:25] hallelujah you ought to let go of
[2:02:27] everything else in other words
[2:02:29] and serve god with all your heart put
[2:02:31] everything you've got into it
[2:02:36] until he becomes a compass for your life
[2:02:41] when he becomes the compass you're no
[2:02:43] longer going to what the
[2:02:44] little twiddly work women that your work
[2:02:47] is saying about how
[2:02:49] cute you know this hairstyle is and that
[2:02:51] paint and this and that
[2:02:52] you quit giving that any validity and
[2:02:55] you give the word
[2:02:58] preeminence
[2:03:02] come on amen when you when you begin to
[2:03:05] do that you quit
[2:03:06] looking at social media and comparing
[2:03:10] yourself with them out there in the
[2:03:11] world and your have-nots
[2:03:16] and i can't and i can and i can't and i
[2:03:19] can't
[2:03:19] have this and i can't have that and
[2:03:23] when you give the word commit the
[2:03:25] preeminence
[2:03:26] then it becomes the guide in your life
[2:03:31] jesus in his last commission that he
[2:03:34] gave his church when he appeared to the
[2:03:36] leaven
[2:03:37] he upgraded them because of their
[2:03:39] hardness of heart
[2:03:40] and their unbelief can you believe this
[2:03:44] isn't this incredible that after all
[2:03:46] they had seen done the miracles signs
[2:03:49] wonders
[2:03:50] the lazarus after four days he you know
[2:03:52] brought back to life
[2:03:54] the the widow's son at name you know
[2:03:56] coming out on a
[2:03:58] on a beer as they were bringing him out
[2:04:00] and
[2:04:01] then and and there jesus stops it and
[2:04:04] and tells him to
[2:04:05] rise up and walk and man what about the
[2:04:08] jairus's daughter and peter james and
[2:04:10] john goes in there with him and
[2:04:12] and he says he's not dead like you think
[2:04:14] she just sleeps
[2:04:16] hey man they left him to scorn because
[2:04:18] she was dead
[2:04:20] and he raised her up called her spirit
[2:04:24] back from the other rounds raised her up
[2:04:27] to life again delivered him to her
[2:04:29] parents
[2:04:30] come on somebody amen and then
[2:04:34] after all the things happened the death
[2:04:36] the barrel
[2:04:37] the resurrection seeing him after he was
[2:04:40] alive
[2:04:42] and he still happened to abrade them
[2:04:45] because of their hardness of hearts
[2:04:47] and unbelief
[2:04:51] because they believe not them but has
[2:04:53] seen him after
[2:04:54] after his resurrection and he says to
[2:04:57] them
[2:04:58] you know he that believeth and is
[2:05:01] baptized shall be saved
[2:05:03] he that believeth not shall be damned
[2:05:06] and then it said and these signs shall
[2:05:07] follow them that believe
[2:05:11] so you've been taught to shake hands and
[2:05:12] put their name on a book jesus said
[2:05:14] different
[2:05:15] these signs shall follow them that
[2:05:17] believe in my name they will cast out
[2:05:19] devils they will speak with no tongues
[2:05:21] they will take up serpents or drink
[2:05:22] deadly things it wouldn't harm them
[2:05:24] if they lay hands on the sick they shall
[2:05:26] recover and that's the last commission
[2:05:28] jesus gave
[2:05:30] and here's the question will i find
[2:05:32] faith
[2:05:33] when i return well
[2:05:36] you know he didn't say will i find
[2:05:37] righteousness will i find a church
[2:05:40] he said well i find faith
[2:05:43] amen now jesus
[2:05:46] would turn to those disciples in that
[2:05:48] time
[2:05:49] when he when they tried to cast out an
[2:05:51] evil spirit out of a child and
[2:05:53] brought it to him and the father said
[2:05:55] they can't cast him out
[2:05:57] lord if you can do anything will you do
[2:05:59] something and jesus answered in matthew
[2:06:02] 17 17 oh faithless
[2:06:05] that's unbelieving and perverse
[2:06:09] generation a generation that distorts
[2:06:12] and turn aside and opposes and plots
[2:06:15] against the saving purposes and plan of
[2:06:17] god
[2:06:18] how long will i be with you how long
[2:06:20] will i suffer you bring him hither to me
[2:06:24] you think of this you see if this kind
[2:06:26] of faith would be expected of the
[2:06:28] disciples
[2:06:29] before calvary are you with me
[2:06:32] amen then what about after jesus shed
[2:06:35] his blood
[2:06:37] and we're now operating under a greater
[2:06:39] blood
[2:06:41] how much more should the power be in the
[2:06:43] church
[2:06:44] to cast satan out to heal the sick
[2:06:48] come on to save the lost to bring up
[2:06:51] the angels come and tap somebody on the
[2:06:54] shoulder
[2:06:54] and bring him down to the altar for
[2:06:57] repentance
[2:06:59] you don't believe that happens that's
[2:07:01] exactly what happens
[2:07:03] you don't come on your own nobody seeks
[2:07:05] after god no not one
[2:07:06] it's god coming to you the angels of god
[2:07:09] is coming to buy
[2:07:10] your pew and say you better make that
[2:07:12] right boy
[2:07:13] [Music]
[2:07:15] girl you better make that right
[2:07:18] amen but you know god
[2:07:21] gave israel a blood he gave us the blood
[2:07:24] and he happened to display that blood
[2:07:27] and i hear this prophet say
[2:07:30] and to be scared when you were under the
[2:07:33] blood
[2:07:34] i may believe you're under the blood and
[2:07:36] then to be scared
[2:07:38] was an insult to jehovah
[2:07:43] if a man what's under the blood feels
[2:07:45] afraid that god won't keep his word
[2:07:47] it's an insult to him jehovah perhaps
[2:07:51] this is your word but i don't know if
[2:07:53] it's right or not shame on you why
[2:07:54] once in the blood i am the lord that
[2:07:56] healeth you i believe that that's all
[2:07:58] don't insult him he that cometh to me i
[2:08:01] will in no wise cast out i believe it
[2:08:04] what's coming of the blood take his word
[2:08:06] for anything he says
[2:08:10] now can you imagine god taking a bride
[2:08:14] to his home who won't believe all his
[2:08:17] word
[2:08:21] god's going to have somebody that i
[2:08:22] believe in
[2:08:24] the message from god to abraham contains
[2:08:28] in his prophecy
[2:08:29] a message of the coming of the end time
[2:08:32] a message of the coming of the lord and
[2:08:35] the long-awaited son it also
[2:08:38] contains a saving of the church through
[2:08:40] the tribulation
[2:08:42] and also the judgment and the burning of
[2:08:44] their of of sodom
[2:08:45] which will be the world genesis 18
[2:08:48] 17 and the lord said shall i hide
[2:08:52] from abraham the thing that i do can't
[2:08:55] you see
[2:08:56] that in the last day that god's
[2:08:59] obligation to abraham's seed
[2:09:02] is to is to reveal to them what his plan
[2:09:06] of redemption is
[2:09:08] in other words shake the seals off the
[2:09:10] book
[2:09:12] amen show the plan so shall i hide from
[2:09:16] abraham what i'm going to do i've got to
[2:09:18] reveal to him the mysteries
[2:09:22] so it goes to show you there's an end
[2:09:24] time
[2:09:25] people who gets a visitation come on
[2:09:29] amen listen no not from pensacola
[2:09:33] not from bob jones not from some of
[2:09:35] these schools of seminaries come on
[2:09:37] somebody
[2:09:38] but get a visitation from the angel of
[2:09:41] god
[2:09:42] and to bring them back to their faith
[2:09:45] that was once delivered to the saints
[2:09:52] now he reveals the secret
[2:09:55] concerning the long-awaited son
[2:09:59] the coming of jesus back to earth again
[2:10:02] the change of the body the secret of
[2:10:06] redemption what is he doing
[2:10:07] he is breaking the silence removing the
[2:10:11] seals off his plan of redemption
[2:10:14] and in doing so at the same time he's
[2:10:17] sending
[2:10:18] investigating angels
[2:10:25] now in ezekiel 9 you will see
[2:10:29] nine and and maybe we should just
[2:10:31] reference it by the way he
[2:10:33] he tells them you know there's a
[2:10:35] slaughtering angels are going forth
[2:10:38] but before he does he said i want you to
[2:10:40] start at my house
[2:10:41] and i want you to put a mark on all of
[2:10:43] those that sigh
[2:10:45] and cry for the abominations done in the
[2:10:47] city
[2:10:49] is that right now of course this is this
[2:10:52] is played out
[2:10:53] in in in even in
[2:10:56] in titus with his surrounding jerusalem
[2:10:59] and
[2:11:00] and those who were in the house top when
[2:11:02] they saw jerusalem being compassed about
[2:11:04] with armies
[2:11:05] don't go get your steps flee to flee out
[2:11:08] get out of the city leave out of there
[2:11:10] what was that
[2:11:11] it was the marking of god or who
[2:11:14] believed the words of jesus
[2:11:16] that when they saw the sign of the
[2:11:19] of the jerusalem being surrounded get
[2:11:22] out of the city
[2:11:25] but you know again this is only a
[2:11:27] prophecy
[2:11:28] of the last day come on
[2:11:32] amen because he again he he is wanting
[2:11:35] us
[2:11:35] to make hate when you see the signs
[2:11:40] coming when you see it surround it
[2:11:43] when you see the solemn hour again
[2:11:46] get out of it flee it
[2:11:50] because everyone that's a part of it is
[2:11:52] gonna burn
[2:11:54] don't be caught in there
[2:11:56] [Music]
[2:11:58] praise the lord now
[2:12:02] listen he says slay older utterly old
[2:12:06] and young and maids and little children
[2:12:08] and women
[2:12:09] but come not nigh anybody that's got the
[2:12:11] mark
[2:12:13] began in my sanctuary and he put a mark
[2:12:16] on those
[2:12:17] who had sighed and cried for the
[2:12:19] abomination
[2:12:20] that's done in the city and i want you
[2:12:22] to understand
[2:12:23] it's a that's a travail of soul and
[2:12:26] brother adam describes it
[2:12:27] as a person who's always hungry and
[2:12:30] thirsting for god
[2:12:32] i tell you one true sign of the holy
[2:12:34] ghost is you can't
[2:12:35] ever get enough of god
[2:12:39] amen you just you're happy for what
[2:12:41] you've got but you're longing for more
[2:12:43] you want to know him in a greater way i
[2:12:47] mean that is an evidence of the
[2:12:48] indwelling spirit of god
[2:12:50] and sin makes you sick to where you sigh
[2:12:54] and you cry over the abomination things
[2:12:57] that are going on
[2:12:58] that god hates
[2:13:03] and it brings any true christian into a
[2:13:06] soul travail brother branham said
[2:13:09] you know he said if someone say to me
[2:13:13] now look william branham
[2:13:15] i'm going to make you answer for a group
[2:13:16] of people
[2:13:18] what you tell them now what do you want
[2:13:20] what do you want them all to do
[2:13:22] do you want them all to shout and he
[2:13:24] says sure i want them all to shout
[2:13:28] hey listen you s you slept out there you
[2:13:31] some of you churches
[2:13:33] he wants us to shout
[2:13:37] do i want them to dance from spirit i
[2:13:39] want every one of them to
[2:13:41] do you hear that out there amen all
[2:13:44] right that's very good but
[2:13:45] you know what would you you want them to
[2:13:47] all speak with tongues
[2:13:48] i want every one of them to you say
[2:13:50] brother tim
[2:13:52] oh everybody speak with tongues paul
[2:13:54] said i would you all
[2:13:56] spoke with tongues but rather that you
[2:13:58] prophesied
[2:14:00] right amen so it's scriptural
[2:14:03] and he said well that's very good but
[2:14:05] what would you rather have them do
[2:14:09] he said i'd rather have a church that
[2:14:11] had such a burden on their heart for
[2:14:13] prayer
[2:14:14] that they just stayed at this altar and
[2:14:16] would be day and night and everything
[2:14:18] else
[2:14:19] and their house was constantly in prayer
[2:14:21] and humble
[2:14:22] and trying to get people to come to god
[2:14:25] and making calls at the hospital
[2:14:27] and visiting to sit and trying to get
[2:14:29] people to come to church and do right
[2:14:31] i would rather have that than all the
[2:14:34] other put together
[2:14:36] all the although the other is right and
[2:14:38] it belongs in the church but if i had to
[2:14:40] have it
[2:14:41] i put that first because if you got that
[2:14:44] the other will take place amen
[2:14:48] if you get so hungry for god shouting
[2:14:50] will take place
[2:14:51] if you've got homie for god speaking in
[2:14:53] tongues will take place
[2:14:54] if you get hungry for god you'll keep on
[2:14:56] hungry and keep yourself
[2:14:58] and you're going to see in yourself but
[2:15:00] if you go seeing yourself get a
[2:15:01] different
[2:15:03] there's another spirit trying to work
[2:15:05] itself in there
[2:15:06] stay right before god humble
[2:15:10] with travail of soul
[2:15:15] he said what if they come what if god
[2:15:19] went through
[2:15:19] churches the ceiling angel
[2:15:24] looking for those who would be at home
[2:15:27] or in churches
[2:15:29] saying god sent a revival
[2:15:33] just so hungry for a meeting oh god look
[2:15:36] at the sins of the city
[2:15:38] oh isn't it terrible god would you
[2:15:40] please send a revival would you
[2:15:42] send some good preacher send someone oh
[2:15:45] lord just let the holy ghost
[2:15:47] would he seal think of that
[2:15:50] now again this is what he's
[2:15:53] looking for he's looking for somebody
[2:15:56] that's got to care they they're so
[2:15:59] sure this is going to happen they are
[2:16:01] convinced that makes them concerned
[2:16:04] so therefore they have a concern for the
[2:16:07] lost
[2:16:09] and he says i believe that the doors of
[2:16:12] the gentiles are closing
[2:16:14] together and the season is about over
[2:16:16] and that's the reason you can't find a
[2:16:18] revival like that
[2:16:19] you know there's no travail of soul you
[2:16:21] can't get that burden
[2:16:22] and people have lost that burden but he
[2:16:24] said that's what the angel's looking for
[2:16:27] and if you're losing it and you're
[2:16:29] becoming cold and indifferent
[2:16:31] and backslidden in your life
[2:16:34] it's time to check up because the
[2:16:38] ceiling angel
[2:16:39] will only seal those who are signing and
[2:16:41] crying
[2:16:42] for the abomination done in the city
[2:16:48] they look over this sin cursed world
[2:16:52] and it smacks their heart
[2:16:56] look some are looking at it and like lot
[2:16:59] they want to
[2:17:00] go towards sodom
[2:17:03] but your look toward it will cause a
[2:17:06] travail
[2:17:10] god save my boy
[2:17:14] save my daughter you see him walk in the
[2:17:17] church
[2:17:18] the piano playing jesus keep me near the
[2:17:20] cross
[2:17:21] tears flowing down walking the church
[2:17:25] hear them there's a precious fountain in
[2:17:28] the cry coming out god
[2:17:31] laid some soul on my heart save that boy
[2:17:34] lord
[2:17:35] save that girl she's lost
[2:17:39] but you don't find it no more and let me
[2:17:42] just tell you it's rare to find it even
[2:17:44] in message
[2:17:45] churches the spirit of god is withdrawn
[2:17:51] jesus predicted it would be that way
[2:17:53] because iniquity would abound
[2:17:56] the love of many would actually wax cold
[2:17:59] you know and and he said that love is
[2:18:01] dying away he said what they got into
[2:18:03] just to form beat up the
[2:18:05] beat the piano up and down real hard and
[2:18:07] holler glory hallelujah and praise the
[2:18:09] lord
[2:18:10] and that's just a form
[2:18:13] and people have they can just make it a
[2:18:15] form
[2:18:16] that's just what we do when we come to
[2:18:18] church we get noise and we clap
[2:18:20] and we go home and that became a form
[2:18:23] but you know most of the form uses
[2:18:25] everybody just as quiet as a mouse and
[2:18:27] nobody says an amen you couldn't
[2:18:29] you couldn't buy any men out of them
[2:18:34] you know again you know this this is
[2:18:37] what we're finding it's a
[2:18:39] and and and church is not to be
[2:18:41] something where we're just
[2:18:43] acting but it's got to be a life
[2:18:47] that is being displayed oh my
[2:18:51] now as we look at this for a moment let
[2:18:53] me hurry and and he
[2:18:54] he he talked about it just like the
[2:18:57] casting of the net
[2:18:59] and he says you know as you cast him
[2:19:02] and he's the net he said you get in
[2:19:04] jesus parable you get
[2:19:06] everything from crabs to
[2:19:10] you know snakes and and spiders and
[2:19:13] whatever else that you get in this net
[2:19:15] when you cast
[2:19:16] but you get a few fishes too
[2:19:20] right so you cast that net and he said
[2:19:24] the pond's almost sane
[2:19:27] in other words we're coming down to
[2:19:29] where we're going to find the last name
[2:19:30] on the book
[2:19:34] are you with me amen and and he said
[2:19:38] jesus
[2:19:39] will come and he'll take his fish in
[2:19:43] and the serpent and the snake the snake
[2:19:45] the serpent the spider the whatever just
[2:19:47] crawl right back out into the pond
[2:19:50] and he says these words oh
[2:19:53] if there's one speck of christianity in
[2:19:56] you
[2:19:57] if there's one speck of desire for you
[2:19:59] to serve god
[2:20:00] hold it as tight as you can this morning
[2:20:03] and cherish it with all your heart
[2:20:07] amen oh my for the that same angel
[2:20:10] coming into the city which is the holy
[2:20:12] spirit dressed in white
[2:20:14] like his purity if that angel come to
[2:20:16] this city
[2:20:17] went through the pentecostal churches
[2:20:19] where in the world would he find
[2:20:21] men that sighs and cries and begs all
[2:20:23] night long in prayer for the abomination
[2:20:25] done in the city
[2:20:26] who would he mark
[2:20:29] we're going to find out who's got the
[2:20:31] holy ghost
[2:20:33] one of these days
[2:20:40] a marking angel investigating judgment
[2:20:50] the angels went looked down at sodom for
[2:20:53] righteousness
[2:20:56] notice
[2:20:59] the plea of abraham if you find
[2:21:03] 50 righteous so the angels
[2:21:07] they're going down there they're not
[2:21:09] looking for faith they're looking for
[2:21:12] righteousness
[2:21:15] so they go down to sodom you know
[2:21:18] because
[2:21:19] at sodom he's going to separate the
[2:21:22] righteous from the wicked
[2:21:26] you wonder sometimes what's going on and
[2:21:28] people taking
[2:21:29] sides and you know the liberal agenda
[2:21:32] and the conservative agenda
[2:21:33] i'll tell you it's the angels going
[2:21:35] forth separating
[2:21:39] you may not think it that way but let me
[2:21:41] just tell you there are things that are
[2:21:43] happening in the supernatural realm
[2:21:45] that you that are invisible to the naked
[2:21:47] eye and just as
[2:21:49] sure as the angel of god separated you
[2:21:52] and man and put faith in your heart he's
[2:21:54] out there looking
[2:21:55] out there in the world today to find the
[2:21:58] righteous ones
[2:22:00] and gather them together for the
[2:22:03] tribulation period
[2:22:06] for they will be saved in the
[2:22:07] tribulation
[2:22:09] actually they're saved on this side but
[2:22:11] they they will
[2:22:13] in the tribulation they give their life
[2:22:16] it'll be you read the bible revelation
[2:22:19] chapter 12 they'll be hunted down
[2:22:22] destroyed the last verses of revelation
[2:22:25] 12 tells you that
[2:22:27] he went looking for faith when he
[2:22:30] appeared to abraham
[2:22:31] and find sarah had none he raised her
[2:22:34] faith
[2:22:35] because a faithless and perverse
[2:22:37] generation
[2:22:39] cannot bring forth the promised son
[2:22:42] so the angels of god were bringing a
[2:22:45] total separation
[2:22:46] from unbelief from the bride and given
[2:22:49] to abraham
[2:22:50] the chains of the body on the other hand
[2:22:53] in sodom
[2:22:54] he they the angels are looking for a
[2:22:57] speck
[2:22:58] of righteousness in love
[2:23:02] you know revealing the salvation
[2:23:05] through tribulation the investigating
[2:23:08] sodom
[2:23:09] judging them and giving them the reward
[2:23:12] of their sins
[2:23:13] through their burning if you look with
[2:23:15] me to genesis 18
[2:23:17] 20 and the lord said because the cry of
[2:23:19] sodom
[2:23:20] and gomorrah is great and because her
[2:23:22] sin is very grievous
[2:23:24] i will go down now and see
[2:23:28] investigate whether they have done
[2:23:31] according to the cry of it
[2:23:33] and which is coming to me and if not i
[2:23:36] will know it
[2:23:38] and the men turned their faces from then
[2:23:40] and went toward sodom yet abraham stood
[2:23:42] before the lord
[2:23:44] 19 1 and there came two angels to sodom
[2:23:47] at evening and lot said in the gate
[2:23:49] and lot seeing those rose up to meet
[2:23:51] them and he bowed himself
[2:23:53] with his face toward the ground and here
[2:23:56] shows three anointings
[2:23:59] three end time anointings
[2:24:03] the lord abraham elohim
[2:24:07] god himself with abraham's group
[2:24:11] and two angels who go down to sodom
[2:24:14] and these two angels will represent the
[2:24:18] end time anointing used to call the
[2:24:20] church
[2:24:22] not the bride but the church out of
[2:24:24] sodom
[2:24:26] now one anointing will be
[2:24:29] largely upon evangelicals billy graham
[2:24:33] would personify that anointing
[2:24:36] the other angel would come the anointing
[2:24:39] would come upon the pentecostal
[2:24:41] charismatics
[2:24:42] and oral roberts would personify that
[2:24:45] anointing
[2:24:46] now these angels are not billy graham
[2:24:49] and oral roberts
[2:24:50] they are anointings that were manifested
[2:24:53] on these men
[2:24:54] and the preachers to the church now not
[2:24:57] the bride the church
[2:24:58] and righteous lot represented the church
[2:25:01] and the angels represent the anointing
[2:25:04] that comes
[2:25:05] upon the ministry to the church and you
[2:25:07] cannot watch
[2:25:09] a billy graham's sermon without knowing
[2:25:11] that man was anointed
[2:25:16] that's the truth he was anointed to call
[2:25:19] people out of sodom
[2:25:24] to bring a separation amen what was it
[2:25:27] god looking for
[2:25:28] righteousness listen i
[2:25:31] i watched billy graham hear it sometime
[2:25:34] ago when i'm
[2:25:34] in a when i was in a cabin brother dan
[2:25:37] dyer and i was there together and
[2:25:39] you know there's i'm not much in the
[2:25:42] football side
[2:25:43] i didn't look at that but i flicked i
[2:25:46] found
[2:25:46] billy graham there in a 1968 or nine
[2:25:51] uh meeting there in it was in england
[2:25:55] and there you know he had his he had his
[2:25:57] own glasses on you know the teardrop
[2:26:00] glasses of style at the time and
[2:26:03] and um big big lenses on and and uh he
[2:26:06] was
[2:26:07] he was preaching a message and somebody
[2:26:10] had criticized him and said it's the
[2:26:11] motion
[2:26:12] of the music of you singing just as i am
[2:26:15] that's causing them
[2:26:16] to come and so that service he wouldn't
[2:26:18] even play anything
[2:26:21] but he had you know the old deal of of
[2:26:24] one of their rock stars that come up and
[2:26:26] sang a little
[2:26:28] kind of halfway gospel song you know you
[2:26:31] know
[2:26:31] here's a rock star that's been saved and
[2:26:33] then they had a football coach so it was
[2:26:36] which their soccer is football so their
[2:26:39] soccer coach you know
[2:26:40] with a big name in england and he come
[2:26:42] up and told how he accepted the lord and
[2:26:45] so on and
[2:26:45] you know just showing you know it's cool
[2:26:48] to you know you you can be a rock star
[2:26:50] or ball player whoever and
[2:26:52] accept the lord and it's cool it's a
[2:26:55] chick thing to do you know and
[2:26:57] and whatever and billy graham then gets
[2:26:58] up and he preaches his sermon
[2:27:00] and as after he preaches he brings it
[2:27:02] down he says
[2:27:03] now i'm just going to call and those of
[2:27:06] you that want to repent
[2:27:07] and come to christ come to him now and
[2:27:10] he stood there
[2:27:11] i'm waiting and without any music or
[2:27:13] anything
[2:27:14] and tens of thousands listen
[2:27:17] i looked and at least 50 000 people
[2:27:20] were moving out of the stadiums in union
[2:27:23] in
[2:27:23] unity coming right down there to accept
[2:27:26] crisis they're saying
[2:27:28] you can't do that without an anointing
[2:27:30] [Applause]
[2:27:33] i'll tell you what they're you know i
[2:27:34] don't know of another preacher so
[2:27:36] anointed
[2:27:38] that so many would move
[2:27:42] what was that what moved them an angelic
[2:27:46] anointing
[2:27:48] it was god trying to find righteous ones
[2:27:52] and separating them from the sodomites
[2:27:58] are you with me amen the same thing on
[2:28:01] the other hand with oral roberts oral
[2:28:03] roberts was anointed
[2:28:06] there were many that were healed in his
[2:28:08] meetings
[2:28:09] bonafide genuine healings
[2:28:12] amen amen and then he turns into his
[2:28:16] prosperity
[2:28:17] message and many embrace that what again
[2:28:20] god was looking to try to bring in a
[2:28:24] separation
[2:28:26] now again sodom represents a world
[2:28:29] condition
[2:28:31] it shows how the world has become so
[2:28:33] perverted
[2:28:34] that anything sacred or holy
[2:28:38] they want to pervert it
[2:28:41] and we have been moving steadily if
[2:28:43] you'll go back
[2:28:44] and even in our recent history where
[2:28:47] that men begin to
[2:28:49] or women begin to take on women's
[2:28:51] clothes
[2:28:52] and now men are beginning to take on
[2:28:54] women's clothes
[2:28:56] and now we're in this sodom world
[2:28:59] condition
[2:29:01] and it shows that the world has become
[2:29:03] so perverted
[2:29:05] that anything or that is sacred
[2:29:08] or holy that wanted to pervert it
[2:29:12] you know what one of the things first
[2:29:14] things this administration did
[2:29:16] was to roll back the the the
[2:29:19] and say we'll not have it taught in our
[2:29:21] schools about god and the pilgrim
[2:29:24] fathers
[2:29:25] we're going to teach a progressive type
[2:29:28] of history
[2:29:29] that is all inclusive and neutral
[2:29:34] you know again there is a perversion of
[2:29:37] our of of our um our
[2:29:40] heritage and man that will pervert
[2:29:43] marriage that is a sacred act between
[2:29:47] a man and a woman and made it legal
[2:29:50] to make a marriage between uh males
[2:29:54] or between females with females
[2:29:57] romans 1 24 and i'm going to read this
[2:30:00] from another version but hang on here
[2:30:03] this is why god lift off lifted off his
[2:30:06] restraining hand i want you to get this
[2:30:08] thought
[2:30:09] this is romans 1 24 if you want to look
[2:30:11] at it in king james
[2:30:13] this god gave them up to him cleaning us
[2:30:15] he actually
[2:30:16] lifts up his restraining health
[2:30:21] okay i'm going to just let you do
[2:30:23] whatever you're going to do
[2:30:26] everybody turns the world over to their
[2:30:28] own lust
[2:30:31] let's progress right on into sodomy
[2:30:35] in the laodicea
[2:30:39] brother i'll tell you you don't ever
[2:30:41] want god's restraining hand to be taken
[2:30:43] off
[2:30:43] of you that's right
[2:30:46] amen sometimes there's a restraining
[2:30:48] hand with you young people
[2:30:50] your parents it's god's restraining hand
[2:30:53] sometimes it's the pulpit
[2:30:57] are you with me which is god's
[2:30:59] restraining hand
[2:31:00] don't go that direction don't dress like
[2:31:03] that don't look like that don't be like
[2:31:05] one of them
[2:31:07] you think it's hard i'm trying to save
[2:31:09] you from the burning
[2:31:16] a man it's difficult it's difficult to
[2:31:20] preach against
[2:31:20] short hair and painted faces and high
[2:31:24] heels and
[2:31:24] and and and cross dressing and men with
[2:31:27] long
[2:31:28] hair and women with short hair it's it's
[2:31:30] difficult to preach on those things
[2:31:32] but you want to save them
[2:31:36] don't go that direction it's god's
[2:31:38] restraining hand
[2:31:43] this is why god lifted off his
[2:31:44] restraining hand
[2:31:46] and let them have full expression of
[2:31:48] their sinful and shameful desires
[2:31:51] they were given over to moral depravity
[2:31:53] dishonoring their bodies by
[2:31:55] sexual perversion among themselves all
[2:31:58] because they traded
[2:31:59] the truth of god for a lie they
[2:32:02] worshiped and
[2:32:03] served the things god made rather than
[2:32:06] the god who made
[2:32:07] all things glory and praises to him for
[2:32:10] eternities in eternity
[2:32:11] and for this reason god gave them over
[2:32:14] to their own disgraceful and
[2:32:16] vile passions inflamed with lust
[2:32:19] one for another have you ever seen lust
[2:32:22] so flames so high
[2:32:26] i mean millions of dollars billions of
[2:32:29] dollars in pornography
[2:32:32] even if i brought you the stats is
[2:32:34] shocking
[2:32:35] how many in one second in one second
[2:32:38] time of every day
[2:32:40] of porn sites that are visited hits upon
[2:32:43] them
[2:32:46] and god gave them over to their own
[2:32:51] this disgrateful and vile passions
[2:32:53] inflamed with lust
[2:32:55] one for another men and women ignored
[2:32:57] the natural order
[2:32:58] in exchange normal sexual relations for
[2:33:01] homosexuality
[2:33:03] and women engaged in lesbian conduct and
[2:33:06] men
[2:33:06] committed shameful acts with men
[2:33:09] receiving in themselves the due penalty
[2:33:11] for their deviation
[2:33:12] and because they thought it was
[2:33:15] worthless
[2:33:17] to embrace the true knowledge of god
[2:33:21] god gave them over to a worthless
[2:33:23] mindset
[2:33:24] now here's the danger if you want to
[2:33:27] take what god's word said
[2:33:29] he'll give you over to a worthless
[2:33:32] mindset
[2:33:37] he'll withdraw his restraining hand
[2:33:39] you'll greet him away for the last time
[2:33:46] they're sinful lives become full of
[2:33:50] every kind of evil and wicked scheme
[2:33:52] greed and
[2:33:53] cruelty their hearts overflowed with
[2:33:55] jealous cravings and
[2:33:56] with conflict and strife which drove
[2:33:58] them into hateful arguments and murder
[2:34:01] they are deceitful liars full of
[2:34:03] hostility they are gossips
[2:34:05] who love to spread malicious slander
[2:34:07] with inflated egos they hurl
[2:34:09] hateful insults at god yet they are
[2:34:12] nothing more than arrogant boasters
[2:34:14] they are rebels against their parents
[2:34:16] totally immoral
[2:34:18] they are senseless faithless ruthless
[2:34:20] heartless
[2:34:21] completely merciless although they are
[2:34:24] aware of god's laws
[2:34:26] and proper order and knowing that those
[2:34:28] who do all of these things deserve to
[2:34:30] die
[2:34:30] yet they go headlong into darkness
[2:34:33] encouraging others to do the same
[2:34:35] and applauding them when they do it
[2:34:40] second timothy 3 and 1 similar
[2:34:42] translation
[2:34:43] but you need to be aware that in the
[2:34:45] final days the culture of society
[2:34:48] will become extremely fierce and
[2:34:50] difficult for the people of god
[2:34:53] people will become self-centered lovers
[2:34:56] of their own selves
[2:34:57] and obsessed with money they will boast
[2:35:00] of great things as they strut around
[2:35:02] in their arrogant pride and mock all
[2:35:04] that is right they will ignore their own
[2:35:06] families
[2:35:08] they will be ungrateful and ungodly
[2:35:12] they will become addicted to hateful and
[2:35:14] malicious slander
[2:35:16] they will slaves to their desires there
[2:35:18] will be ferocious
[2:35:20] belligerent haters of what is good and
[2:35:23] right
[2:35:23] and with brutal treachery they will act
[2:35:25] without restraint
[2:35:27] bigoted and wrapped in clouds of their
[2:35:29] conceit
[2:35:30] they will find their delight in the
[2:35:32] pleasures of this world
[2:35:33] more than the pleasures of the loving
[2:35:35] god that we may pretend to have a
[2:35:37] respect for god
[2:35:39] but in reality they want nothing to do
[2:35:41] with god's power
[2:35:42] stay away from people like these
[2:35:47] now these horrible men are so like these
[2:35:54] these horrible men of sodom demanded a
[2:35:57] lot
[2:35:58] to give the angels to them so they could

[2:39:13] want to
[2:39:15] you say brother jim why could this be
[2:39:17] because there has to come
[2:39:19] people in place just like it was when
[2:39:22] mary
[2:39:23] and joseph was to go down to to
[2:39:26] bethlehem
[2:39:27] to be counted in the census and god
[2:39:30] god there raised up a man to fulfill the
[2:39:33] word
[2:39:34] it had to get from nazareth down to
[2:39:36] bethlehem for jesus to be born
[2:39:39] and took an ungodly king with ungodly
[2:39:42] loss
[2:39:43] with hearts loss to force
[2:39:48] the word to fulfillment
[2:39:52] and let me tell you god has brought men
[2:39:55] into position
[2:39:57] to bring the word of god to pass
[2:40:02] amen are you with me amen and i'll tell
[2:40:06] you what some of it is just like it was
[2:40:08] in the days
[2:40:08] of elijah
[2:40:10] [Music]
[2:40:12] are you with me in the days of elijah
[2:40:14] what happened
[2:40:15] there was a there was a man that is
[2:40:18] that that raised up called himself a
[2:40:22] prophet
[2:40:22] and said you know what these two horns
[2:40:25] god will
[2:40:25] god will raise up and push them off and
[2:40:28] and and um
[2:40:29] and give the the land back to israel
[2:40:33] and and elijah said well how can god
[2:40:36] bless what he has cursed
[2:40:39] and he said and and who who was the
[2:40:41] prophet
[2:40:42] somebody help me right quick and man
[2:40:45] somebody tried to say it what was it
[2:40:48] micah micah the problem there's a bible
[2:40:50] reader at least one of us
[2:40:52] and my micah stood up and he said well i
[2:40:54] got the word of the lord
[2:40:56] and the word of the lord is that i
[2:40:59] saw a spirit rise up out of hell
[2:41:04] when god said who can deceive ahab
[2:41:08] that he'll go down to the battle
[2:41:12] and god said and he said how will you do
[2:41:14] it he said i'll be a lion spirit
[2:41:16] in the mouth of their prophets
[2:41:20] and their aligned spirit went forth from
[2:41:24] the presence of god
[2:41:25] to go in there to fulfill the word and
[2:41:27] let me tell you
[2:41:28] there are spirits in this age that are
[2:41:31] bringing about the fulfillment of
[2:41:33] prophecy
[2:41:34] a lion spirit deceiving the people
[2:41:42] but god's word is not going to fall to
[2:41:43] the ground
[2:41:47] amen now this is the job
[2:41:50] of the two anointings upon men today
[2:41:54] they are anointed by the angels to call
[2:41:56] men out of sodom
[2:41:58] and the same preaching of the gospel
[2:42:00] blinds the eyes of the unbeliever
[2:42:03] so some will believe by it and some will
[2:42:06] be blinded by it
[2:42:07] and that was what the angels did blinded
[2:42:10] the sodomites that they couldn't see the
[2:42:11] door
[2:42:12] now you see it was an angelic anointing
[2:42:15] that anointed thousands to respond to
[2:42:18] graham
[2:42:19] it was an anointing of the angel that
[2:42:21] inspired
[2:42:22] thousands to to when to believe
[2:42:26] uh for divine healing when oral roberts
[2:42:28] preached it
[2:42:29] you know look at the preachers of the
[2:42:31] charismatic realm
[2:42:33] that got on that faith wagon and even
[2:42:35] his prosperity message
[2:42:37] and he was doing his part calling out of
[2:42:40] sodom
[2:42:41] bringing the separation you're finding
[2:42:43] righteous ones here
[2:42:44] righteous ones there for what the
[2:42:47] tribulation
[2:42:50] hallelujah but if that anointing is upon
[2:42:53] men
[2:42:53] of the preachers in this day amen under
[2:42:57] the evangelicals and in the faith
[2:42:59] movements
[2:43:00] somebody help me preach if that
[2:43:02] anointing is still alive
[2:43:04] and moving and calling then the
[2:43:06] anointing of the elohim
[2:43:08] is still with the church today he is
[2:43:11] still
[2:43:12] looking up by the mind faith
[2:43:16] and putting faith in the hearts of god's
[2:43:18] children
[2:43:19] will i by faith
[2:43:33] i want to say brothers and sisters we
[2:43:35] are under anointing
[2:43:38] we are not here in this time alone
[2:43:41] we are not by ourselves amen but there
[2:43:45] is a greater one than what you see
[2:43:47] among us he's the one who heals the sick
[2:43:51] he's the one that changed the law he's
[2:43:53] the one that cast out devils
[2:43:55] he's the one that moves in our servants
[2:43:58] he's the one because i'm the same
[2:44:00] yesterday today and forever and i'm
[2:44:02] doing extreme things
[2:44:04] to get you to believe
[2:44:08] i want you to tell you this morning we
[2:44:11] are under the influence of a mighty
[2:44:13] angel
[2:44:15] it's the angel of the covenant it's the
[2:44:17] pillar of fire
[2:44:18] it's the holy ghost and it's the holy
[2:44:21] ghost that fields you
[2:44:22] it's the holy ghost that shields you and
[2:44:24] it's the holy ghost that are right for
[2:44:26] you
[2:44:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:44:37] we are in the vision we are in the
[2:44:39] prophecy we are in the moment
[2:44:42] and we are under anointing
[2:44:50] and that anointing will break the yoke
[2:44:52] of sin and unbelief
[2:44:53] and unrighteousness and filthiness of
[2:44:55] all this will it'll forgive
[2:44:57] you because i'll have a bride and she'll
[2:45:00] be without spots
[2:45:01] or without wrinkles or without a blemish
[2:45:04] i'll have a people
[2:45:05] for my name's sake
[2:45:17] lights yes
[2:45:21] we're used to hearing about lights
[2:45:23] there's a light over that woman there
[2:45:26] she has such and such problem her name
[2:45:28] is so and so
[2:45:30] she came from so and so
[2:45:33] we're we're familiar in this message
[2:45:37] with a pillar of fire with a light
[2:45:45] let me just tell you friends
[2:45:48] we are in a day of angelic visitation
[2:45:50] they're not going to get
[2:45:51] less they're going to get more
[2:45:55] and they will crescendo in lights coming
[2:45:58] from glory
[2:46:01] coming out swiftly even as brother
[2:46:04] branham would say
[2:46:05] i saw seven of them they come so fast i
[2:46:08] couldn't hardly count them you know i'm
[2:46:10] saying well you know where they're five
[2:46:11] where there's seven
[2:46:12] but here they come you know quicker than
[2:46:14] a blink of an eye and they were there
[2:46:17] and they caught me up in the midst of
[2:46:19] them oh man and
[2:46:21] the revelations that came from that
[2:46:22] boulevard let me let me tell you this
[2:46:24] was no
[2:46:25] this was no joseph smith and golden
[2:46:27] plates
[2:46:29] this was the bible coming alive
[2:46:33] this was the word of god not not
[2:46:35] something dug up
[2:46:36] out somebody's ground somewhere it's a
[2:46:37] mystic golden plate
[2:46:39] with some interpretation but the bible
[2:46:42] the very king james version bible
[2:46:45] vindicated
[2:46:46] [Applause]
[2:46:48] as i was taught just by an angel
[2:46:53] who stand before them who would argue
[2:46:55] with him but by the
[2:46:56] about the godhead and he says but
[2:46:59] brothers
[2:46:59] this is how i was taught by the angel of
[2:47:02] the lord
[2:47:05] the same one who never failed never
[2:47:07] misses
[2:47:11] and those seals if i ever had anything
[2:47:14] in spite of god
[2:47:15] it was that he said i was there in the
[2:47:18] room
[2:47:19] about to go to my old thinking my old
[2:47:22] ways
[2:47:23] you know what so-and-so said i preached
[2:47:26] it this way in the past
[2:47:27] but about that time he came in the room
[2:47:30] and changed my thoughts
[2:47:31] forever and it's perfectly
[2:47:34] with the scripture
[2:47:42] we're back in the day where god
[2:47:46] would take a light would appear
[2:47:49] and use dust to speak through
[2:47:55] he would do it in the days of abraham
[2:47:59] coming from that holy dimension of the
[2:48:02] logos the pillar of fire
[2:48:05] and there hover over some soil
[2:48:09] and there he would change that soil
[2:48:12] bring out the 16 elements
[2:48:14] step into a body walk down
[2:48:18] and sit down with abraham
[2:48:22] he would eat flesh
[2:48:25] drink the milk of the cow and the butter
[2:48:29] he would dare talk to abraham in his own
[2:48:32] language
[2:48:35] and i hear brother branham saying in
[2:48:38] this
[2:48:40] he says he said i pray father you'll
[2:48:43] wake the people up let them see they're
[2:48:45] living like a modern sodom and gomorrah
[2:48:48] granted lord they'll see that that angel
[2:48:50] that was promised to visit through human
[2:48:52] flesh and lord we know that that angel
[2:48:54] is a messenger from heaven
[2:48:56] which is the holy ghost it is him that
[2:48:58] wants to work through us the will of god
[2:49:00] to call the church
[2:49:01] granted lord send them again tonight
[2:49:04] send that great elohim
[2:49:06] that came down and just and made his
[2:49:08] have known because he could talk to man
[2:49:10] through the dust use the dust that's in
[2:49:13] here lord
[2:49:14] that's been consecrated to you this
[2:49:17] sanctified dust
[2:49:18] by the blood of jesus use them
[2:49:22] that ought to be our cry this morning
[2:49:24] lord use the dust
[2:49:27] that you have sanctified to reveal
[2:49:30] yourself in this sodom age
[2:49:32] to abraham's seed now
[2:49:36] this angel would initiate
[2:49:40] the coming of the lord it would initiate
[2:49:43] the gospel and power to bring on his
[2:49:45] second coming
[2:49:46] god doing extraordinary things
[2:49:50] but let me tell you about this angel
[2:49:54] this angel this is the one
[2:49:59] who would be sent to brother branham
[2:50:02] when he was there in 1946
[2:50:06] at the first occurrence we would come
[2:50:10] and like a great light
[2:50:13] next thing out of that light came a
[2:50:15] couple of feet
[2:50:17] and these feet then would come to the
[2:50:20] hem of a garment and come up
[2:50:22] and finally show the face of a man
[2:50:25] standing there
[2:50:27] six foot tall
[2:50:30] 200 pounds
[2:50:36] coming right out of a light
[2:50:41] when he would converse and give his
[2:50:43] message
[2:50:44] he would turn back to that light and go
[2:50:47] right through the wall
[2:50:51] you say that's impossible brother tim
[2:50:52] jesus did it after his resurrection
[2:51:02] lights mystic lights
[2:51:06] something that the church world knows
[2:51:08] little about
[2:51:10] they've long forgot about the logos the
[2:51:14] pillar of fire and how he divided
[2:51:16] himself on the day of pentecost
[2:51:18] to give each man a portion of his own
[2:51:20] life
[2:51:23] they long for god in fact they come to a
[2:51:26] place
[2:51:27] we don't need angels today
[2:51:30] well i'm going to just say even jesus
[2:51:32] needed angels
[2:51:36] the bible said in matthew 4 11 this is
[2:51:39] after he got the holy ghost
[2:51:42] matthew 4 11 then the devil believeth
[2:51:44] him and behold the angels
[2:51:46] came and ministered to him
[2:51:49] there are just those days i feel like i
[2:51:51] need that ministry
[2:51:54] there's just those days when i fought it
[2:51:56] out
[2:51:58] that i feel just like jesus did
[2:52:01] come on i'm not even i'm not even
[2:52:04] half the man jesus was or a quarter or a
[2:52:07] third or whatever you want to say
[2:52:08] i'm not you know but here here again you
[2:52:10] know i need that
[2:52:13] angels came and ministered to him
[2:52:17] in in luke chapter 22 verse 42
[2:52:21] father if you're willing to take this
[2:52:22] cup from me but not my will but yours be
[2:52:25] done
[2:52:26] verse 43 then an angel from heaven
[2:52:29] appeared to him and strengthened him
[2:52:33] i kind of feel that way too here we are
[2:52:36] in a very trying hour perhaps this is
[2:52:39] our gethsemane
[2:52:41] perhaps this is one of the darkest
[2:52:44] nights
[2:52:45] that we've ever been in in this message
[2:52:48] are you with me amen but today i say
[2:52:52] oh angel of god it's time for your
[2:52:55] appearance
[2:52:56] i need that strength coming from the
[2:52:59] angel of god i need a trust from elohim
[2:53:02] i need a touch from the almighty i can't
[2:53:05] go on
[2:53:06] i need a strength
[2:53:14] matthew 26 53
[2:53:17] he talks about the angels at his
[2:53:20] assistance
[2:53:22] and he said don't you think do you think
[2:53:24] i cannot call on my father and he will
[2:53:26] put
[2:53:27] at my disposal more than 12
[2:53:30] legions that's 80 000 angels
[2:53:36] we're talking about a book of acts
[2:53:38] church we preach about a book of acts
[2:53:41] church
[2:53:41] we say you know if the vine ever puts
[2:53:45] forth another branch she'll write
[2:53:46] another book of acts behind it
[2:53:49] did you know the new church had more
[2:53:51] angels ministering than the old
[2:53:53] testament did
[2:53:56] hello the new testament more angels
[2:53:59] there than the old testament
[2:54:02] you know there's ministered spirits that
[2:54:04] are sent from the presence of god
[2:54:06] amen brother branham said what's this
[2:54:08] angel lord
[2:54:09] we know this true what kind of nature it
[2:54:11] has it bears the same fruit
[2:54:13] that it did like it when it's on the
[2:54:14] earth now it's back in the church
[2:54:16] bearing the same fruit
[2:54:17] making another pentecostal church just
[2:54:20] exactly like it did
[2:54:22] in the first time the angel lord making
[2:54:25] another pentecostal church
[2:54:26] and if that angel truly comes from god
[2:54:29] and is sent from god
[2:54:30] it's bound to be it's a direct message
[2:54:32] from glory
[2:54:36] again he says and he declares god
[2:54:40] takes his mind but he never takes the
[2:54:43] spirit
[2:54:44] and i want to declare to you again just
[2:54:47] because if god
[2:54:48] took the prophet off the sea doesn't
[2:54:50] mean that the angel of god is left
[2:54:54] let me just say it just because billy
[2:54:56] graham and oral roberts are gone
[2:54:57] doesn't mean that men are not anointed
[2:55:01] with that same anointing today and make
[2:55:04] it a separation
[2:55:06] [Applause]
[2:55:11] but i want you to look and see what
[2:55:12] happened
[2:55:14] at the angels return their bodies
[2:55:18] begin to change
[2:55:21] abraham travels 40 miles to career
[2:55:24] for the purpose
[2:55:27] that the story can be wrote of this
[2:55:29] young king
[2:55:31] abimelech to show us that god has
[2:55:34] changed a 90 year old woman
[2:55:36] to where she is beautiful and desirable
[2:55:41] he had to change her and i want you to
[2:55:44] know that
[2:55:45] here we are living in in the day and
[2:55:47] hour
[2:55:48] of the angel's return it's his
[2:55:51] visitation
[2:55:53] and in his visitation he said i will
[2:55:55] return
[2:55:56] yeah he came to a prophet he used the
[2:55:59] prophet
[2:55:59] he used his ministry but he promised
[2:56:03] before the change i will return again
[2:56:07] there is to be the return of the angel
[2:56:14] now i don't care how the return is
[2:56:17] because he said i'll never leave your
[2:56:18] forsaken
[2:56:20] maybe maybe it's not maybe it's not that
[2:56:22] he's not been here
[2:56:24] i don't think that's it remember but it
[2:56:26] is that we just became
[2:56:28] where we were less cognitive and we got
[2:56:30] so involved in this and that and the
[2:56:33] other
[2:56:33] and theology and man's ideas and so on
[2:56:36] until
[2:56:37] we failed to recognize the living
[2:56:39] presence of the living god among us
[2:56:42] but it's a time in the hour for him to
[2:56:44] appear again
[2:56:49] to do what to give that strength
[2:56:52] to sarah body changing
[2:56:56] strength hallelujah come on somebody
[2:57:00] amen we often think discernment being
[2:57:03] the last sign
[2:57:04] brother brandon we're often talking
[2:57:05] about you're seeing your last sign
[2:57:08] but it's not the bride is the last sign
[2:57:12] the last sign is elohim in human flesh
[2:57:15] is that right amen and he said he said
[2:57:18] his church
[2:57:19] would be there without spot or wrinkle
[2:57:22] she's going to stand there in the
[2:57:23] splendor of him
[2:57:24] his word manifests she'll be a token or
[2:57:27] a sign to the world
[2:57:30] oh my he says in the again the trial
[2:57:33] i challenge you to believe that jesus
[2:57:35] christ is being revealed in the
[2:57:37] form of the son of man in human flesh
[2:57:40] through the
[2:57:40] bride's body again
[2:57:44] he was saying it was showing a sign that
[2:57:46] god was in flesh
[2:57:47] jesus has gotten flesh and if jesus is
[2:57:50] in you tonight
[2:57:51] it's still him manifesting the last day
[2:57:53] the son of man
[2:57:54] revealing himself in his church the
[2:57:56] human flesh making himself known
[2:58:00] now so you see it is still the revealing
[2:58:04] of the son of man it was revealed in a
[2:58:07] prophet
[2:58:08] but it's got to be revealed in bride
[2:58:10] form
[2:58:11] amen so now he will have to change
[2:58:14] sarah and to do that
[2:58:19] she's 90 years old her milk veins are
[2:58:21] dried up
[2:58:22] her bath's being barren in her age she's
[2:58:25] got to
[2:58:25] be returned her heart's got to be
[2:58:27] changed
[2:58:28] amanda she's too weak to give forth
[2:58:31] labor
[2:58:33] is somebody with me amen because again
[2:58:36] you see there has to be something that
[2:58:39] changes sarah now the message
[2:58:43] came to turn her back to believing
[2:58:46] but then the angels returned the
[2:58:49] visitation
[2:58:50] to cause her to be changed
[2:58:54] oh i hear brother branham say it the
[2:58:57] church is ready
[2:58:58] she's sealed in ready to come there will
[2:59:00] be a big
[2:59:01] outpouring of the of the spirit yes sir
[2:59:04] to grab that church
[2:59:05] and take her into the skies because see
[2:59:07] the church
[2:59:08] the word the pride and christ his
[2:59:11] ministries and the bride
[2:59:12] which is his body the supernatural
[2:59:14] spiritual body of youth
[2:59:15] on the earth his spirit is living his
[2:59:18] life right out until him
[2:59:19] and the church becomes one for the
[2:59:21] wedding
[2:59:23] again what is the holy ghost it's all
[2:59:26] coming forth of the holy spirit
[2:59:28] so that great church is being filled up
[2:59:30] and choked full
[2:59:31] of the great powers of almighty god
[2:59:34] until it's got a place into the very
[2:59:35] works that jesus done
[2:59:37] has manifested itself right in the
[2:59:39] church now
[2:59:40] look again adoption time the church
[2:59:43] waiting on you and me
[2:59:44] adoption time when god can pour into us
[2:59:48] his fullness his power his resurrection
[2:59:51] that when christ
[2:59:52] and the church become so close together
[2:59:54] till christ becomes visible among us
[2:59:56] and raises the dead and we go in the
[2:59:58] rapture
[3:00:00] amen oh again god's little flock that
[3:00:03] believes the word how many is one of
[3:00:04] them
[3:00:05] that little flock that believes the word
[3:00:07] its mechanics is ready too
[3:00:09] it's ready for the dynamics to set it a
[3:00:12] fire with the holy ghost
[3:00:13] fear not little flock it's your father's
[3:00:15] good will to give you the kingdom
[3:00:18] the holy ghost will strike a little
[3:00:20] church
[3:00:21] that's come out from the world women
[3:00:23] that wears long hair
[3:00:24] nazirite to prove they're separated
[3:00:26] themselves from the world
[3:00:28] oh my but god's got a loyal group of
[3:00:31] people a genuine flock
[3:00:33] who don't care what the world says they
[3:00:36] believe jesus christ the same yesterday
[3:00:38] today and forever
[3:00:40] god's going to send another shaking
[3:00:43] i'm just reminding you of the angel's
[3:00:44] return god's going to send another
[3:00:46] shaken
[3:00:47] amen and there's still somebody out
[3:00:49] there somewhere that's a predestinated
[3:00:51] seed that the light has to fall on
[3:00:53] somewhere
[3:00:54] somewhere in the world amen
[3:00:59] i believe we're on the brink of one of
[3:01:01] the greatest
[3:01:02] outpourings that's ever been ever had in
[3:01:05] this age i believe it
[3:01:06] i can't say the lord told me just
[3:01:08] something inside of me catching a hold
[3:01:10] of something
[3:01:10] that i hadn't seen in all my life till
[3:01:12] just now
[3:01:14] in the token i am looking for a break
[3:01:17] forth
[3:01:18] of the spirit of god in these last days
[3:01:22] that we're living in
[3:01:23] for another surge of the holy ghost
[3:01:26] into the church for a rapture and faith
[3:01:29] before it comes
[3:01:31] i wonder what your expectations are
[3:01:35] amen oh my it's not that god's forgot us
[3:01:38] god is here
[3:01:39] it's not that god has left us alone god
[3:01:41] is present
[3:01:43] hallelujah he said now you're going to
[3:01:45] see something happen i'm only building
[3:01:47] the hours close at hand
[3:01:48] where you're going to see something
[3:01:50] happen when something's going to take
[3:01:51] place
[3:01:52] and all this background here has been
[3:01:54] laying the foundation for a short quick
[3:01:56] message
[3:01:56] that will shut the whole nations i
[3:01:59] wonder if you're
[3:02:00] ready to be a part to be a party
[3:02:04] that elohim can step into everyone that
[3:02:07] he can reveal himself in
[3:02:11] now let me bring this down to a close
[3:02:18] brother branham didn't believe in little
[3:02:19] green men who came from flying saucers
[3:02:24] but in genesis there were three men
[3:02:28] that came walking up appeared from
[3:02:31] nowhere like i said the light the pillar
[3:02:33] of fire
[3:02:34] hovered over some dust pulled from its
[3:02:36] elephants
[3:02:37] elements needed to make a body stepped
[3:02:39] into it and disappeared again
[3:02:42] perhaps leaving a pile of dust somewhere
[3:02:49] and you know there's been a lot of
[3:02:52] carnal
[3:02:53] fantastics along the way a lot of silly
[3:02:56] little ideas
[3:03:00] brother branham would talk about that he
[3:03:01] said these little carnal things
[3:03:04] impersonation little fantastic he talks
[3:03:07] about a church in dallas texas
[3:03:10] they had people standing on the streets
[3:03:12] people the minister
[3:03:13] actually put in the paper little
[3:03:14] superman's coming out of heaven
[3:03:16] and flying saucers and gonna come down
[3:03:19] prove this revival center was a
[3:03:21] real genuine holy spirit was in it had
[3:03:23] people stand on the street looking for
[3:03:25] such as that he said
[3:03:26] how far can the christian church stoop
[3:03:30] down
[3:03:31] and eat from a garbage can there's no
[3:03:34] such thing as that word sheep don't
[3:03:36] listen
[3:03:37] to to stuff like that certainly i don't
[3:03:40] care
[3:03:40] if flying saucers flew through the
[3:03:43] building and everything else unless that
[3:03:45] dove he's talking about the holy spirit
[3:03:47] is there brother
[3:03:48] no need of having anything
[3:03:51] but now though he was aware of the
[3:03:54] fantastics
[3:03:56] and the fanaticism
[3:04:00] and all this the the the little rumors
[3:04:03] and ideas and
[3:04:05] floating stories
[3:04:08] but he was also aware of in the bible
[3:04:12] where there's a man called enoch
[3:04:15] who walked with god
[3:04:19] and was not
[3:04:23] he simply was there one moment
[3:04:27] and gone the next
[3:04:31] we're not talking about science fiction
[3:04:33] now we're talking about bible
[3:04:36] he was very aware of another rapture
[3:04:39] where elijah was taken up
[3:04:41] now i believe he was taken up into
[3:04:42] abraham's bosom that's where i think he
[3:04:44] went paradise
[3:04:45] without death but elijah taken up into
[3:04:48] paradise without death
[3:04:50] and he went in a fiery chariot
[3:04:54] with horses of fire and a chariot of
[3:04:56] fire and was caught up by
[3:04:58] whirlwind moved up into the heavens
[3:05:05] a fire light mystic lights
[3:05:10] jesus was standing there at the very end
[3:05:13] of his ministry
[3:05:16] talking to his disciples and suddenly
[3:05:19] light came under his feet and he was
[3:05:22] caught up
[3:05:24] not into a thunderhead but into a
[3:05:26] supernatural cloud
[3:05:29] and vanished from sight
[3:05:35] that was a rapture
[3:05:38] in the message paradox he says we see
[3:05:42] the world geographically
[3:05:44] we see the signs earthquakes and diverse
[3:05:47] places
[3:05:48] nations against nations we see all
[3:05:51] things as predicted
[3:05:52] we see fearful sights in the skies
[3:05:56] man's hearts failing flying saucers and
[3:05:58] so forth they can't explain
[3:06:00] investigating judgments coming down to
[3:06:03] the earth
[3:06:04] we see atomic bombs hanging out yonder
[3:06:08] everywhere and the great missiles that
[3:06:12] can carry
[3:06:12] total destruction in an hour we see the
[3:06:16] gases hanging right above us there
[3:06:18] that would rain down the fire down out
[3:06:20] of heaven and destroy the earth
[3:06:22] but we see jesus also who made the
[3:06:25] promise
[3:06:26] who said this same jesus that was taken
[3:06:30] up from you
[3:06:31] will come again in like manner if you've
[3:06:33] seen him go to heaven
[3:06:34] and we're watching for that great day to
[3:06:36] come
[3:06:41] christ revealed his own word you see
[3:06:43] these little pockets
[3:06:45] go into the air they call saucers
[3:06:48] well we better leave that alone you hear
[3:06:50] all these people come up missing
[3:06:52] and say they don't hear from them no
[3:06:54] more they're standing there they don't
[3:06:56] they're not there
[3:06:57] now see those can be made up stories and
[3:07:00] fictitious things men's imaginations
[3:07:04] but listen this but that's the way the
[3:07:07] rapture is going to be
[3:07:11] one of them will drop we'll talk about
[3:07:14] them lights
[3:07:16] god is a light he's a pillar of fire
[3:07:21] he come on the day of pentecost and
[3:07:23] licks of him come out birth and sons
[3:07:27] one of them will drop down here
[3:07:30] and this terrestrial body will take on
[3:07:34] a celestial body and there'll be hot
[3:07:37] hair
[3:07:37] bones left it'll be transformed in a
[3:07:39] moment of time dropping right out of
[3:07:41] space
[3:07:41] and taking home that
[3:07:45] we see this all going on they're
[3:07:47] wondering pentagon's wondering mystic
[3:07:48] lights are seeing them in the sky
[3:07:50] you see one here in the paper
[3:07:52] jeffersonville this week i'm missing
[3:07:53] like
[3:07:54] oh so they don't know what that is
[3:07:58] but listen little children it's going to
[3:08:01] pick you up one of these days
[3:08:04] see don't you worry as jesus said
[3:08:07] as it was in the days
[3:08:10] of sodom
[3:08:14] missing people what happened just before
[3:08:16] sodom
[3:08:18] god came down with angels they had an
[3:08:20] investigating judgment
[3:08:22] i've heard the cry it was so sinful so
[3:08:25] great i've come down to find out whether
[3:08:28] it's all together the truth or not
[3:08:31] that's right
[3:08:31] watch that main one that stayed with
[3:08:33] abraham could discern the thoughts
[3:08:35] that was in sarah's heart now you look
[3:08:38] around just a little bit and notice and
[3:08:40] watch what it's
[3:08:40] doing doing the same today is an
[3:08:43] investigating judgment
[3:08:44] why after a while and i believe we're in
[3:08:48] that after a while
[3:08:49] the church when he can stay in that
[3:08:51] place and every seed
[3:08:52] has been brought to its spot they'll be
[3:08:55] gone
[3:08:56] they won't know what happened to them
[3:08:58] one will be going one way
[3:09:00] one will be going over to the pastor's
[3:09:03] house one will be going over here down
[3:09:05] here the first thing you know they're
[3:09:06] not there
[3:09:07] for enoch which was a type god took him
[3:09:11] and he was found not come down
[3:09:14] to investigate the continuity how the
[3:09:17] enoch translation
[3:09:18] a type of israel being carried over in
[3:09:20] the ark
[3:09:22] missing people can't see him no more but
[3:09:24] you're getting
[3:09:25] together with the rest of the group
[3:09:31] now this is what he said one day
[3:09:35] if you die you'll leave your body here
[3:09:40] you will step into another body that's
[3:09:43] eternally waiting in the heavens
[3:09:47] and there you will join with the other
[3:09:49] theophanies
[3:09:52] in a body that is incorruptible
[3:09:56] the bible said that we'll drop these
[3:09:58] clothes and be clothed upon
[3:10:02] with another body with the temple he
[3:10:05] says that's not made with hands
[3:10:08] as i said and it's
[3:10:12] you know when darkness comes in
[3:10:16] as you're drawing your last breath
[3:10:19] and it begins to be all dark it comes
[3:10:22] this little light and you just start
[3:10:23] moving toward that light
[3:10:26] and you just follow into that light and
[3:10:28] it'll lead you right into a
[3:10:30] beautiful open area panoramic
[3:10:34] area where thousands of saints will be
[3:10:36] coming
[3:10:37] to greet the new arrivals
[3:10:42] but if you happen to be among those that
[3:10:44] are alive and remain
[3:10:50] those that in their theophanies will
[3:10:53] come here and they will appear among us
[3:10:57] and when they do
[3:11:00] you're going to see them and when you
[3:11:03] see them
[3:11:04] it's going to change starts happening
[3:11:06] you'll feel those chains sweep over
[3:11:08] but i want you to know what happens is
[3:11:11] your theophany
[3:11:13] your body that he's prepared for you
[3:11:16] will come to you
[3:11:20] and it'll sweep right over this body and
[3:11:23] it'll change you while you're standing
[3:11:24] on your feet
[3:11:26] and you'll be changed in a moment in a
[3:11:29] twinkling of an
[3:11:30] eye and be caught up to meet the lord
[3:11:34] in the air and we will forever
[3:11:37] be with the lord comfort
[3:11:40] one another with these words
[3:11:44] that's the only comfort that i have in
[3:11:46] this hour
[3:11:47] not a new president not a new political
[3:11:50] system
[3:11:51] but the coming of jesus back to the end
[3:11:54] let's stand again
[3:11:58] amen let the musicians come
[3:12:01] what a day that will be what a day
[3:12:05] what a day to realize you're living in
[3:12:08] that day
