service of the Lord together with us nice to have the Sisler's with us from over in ohio and all the other different ones that are here this weekend we're just really that glad that you've come and you're part with us today and god bless you we I just want to you know make a couple of announcements this morning one I'm looking for whether Jeremy and sister Sadie were they there over there okay well y'all come on up here we have brother Jeremy and sister Sadie that today we want to announce a very special event that is coming up this year as you know the years always bring changes and things that happens and brother Jeremy and sister Sadie had placed their vows to each other want to be married on June 2 20th this year so they have made that agreement with one another and pledged in an engagement to one to another so we want to just congratulate them this morning and thank the Lord for His goodness raise the Lord and I'm just asking a special request of the Lord just make them a whole family of singers a man the bless the Bride of Christ God bless you amen thank you and may the Holy Spirit be with me and God has been really really good to us and we thank him admired the other day we had and I am this is on spur the moment but if anybody could throw up that picture for me of me and sister Karen and our young people the other day I'll tell you what we are we were so blessed to have a whole wonderful group of young people that the Lord has blessed this church with and I think there was about a 70 72 or more that was in that picture with us with if you miss him three of them were young married couples and we're just thankful to the Lord for His goodness to us I think you know when we started building this church some years ago now and we had in our first groundbreaking on I sang a song you know building up the temple for the Lord and I turn around to all of those young people and said we're building this for you and so you know here we are in this time and being able to enjoy that so that what a what a blessing it is that that we have these young people are coming up with the youth camp have a few cancellations that have been made and so I just say to anybody out there listening if you're not going cancel quickly because there's about 10 or 15 waiting in your place so look at this wonderful group of young people amen dr. Pat secret keeps one of you and of course the youngest was a two on the front row there amen we're headed back to Eternity because that's what we come from I wanted to tell you that we have been in earnest prayer about our planned meetings to Japan and also the Philippines and I have reached the point where that decision has to be made about our travel to both of those countries as you know the coronavirus has always already caused concern and actually hysteria among world governments and preventive actions and overreactions are happening worldwide as they tried to contain the virus and as we speak there have been restriction on travel and detaining of ships and airplanes and and of course the problem is not the virus as much it is the reaction the hysteria the travel restriction of governments due to the to the virus and right now we know that they're not travel restrictions from the United States to the Philippines or Japan but there were others that had planned to come from some of the Far East nations and Nepal India Indonesia at different places that had planned to attend the Japanese meetings that will not be able to attend and already those in India who were planning to come have been told by their governments to expect at least a two-week detainment and quarantine upon their return to India because they have to travel through Hong Kong and I spoke to brother Murphy Wang and he says that nearly all of China is quarantined and travel restrictions are being enforced even local travel to where that believers are reporting they cannot go out of their homes but maybe a couple of times a week to go for supplies and they are checked for fever upon leaving their their homes and I have to report back in and actually get permission to go and come and return to their homes they are also checked when they return and because of this there is this there's tremendous problems with shortage of food supplies as there's nothing left on the shelves meager food supplies are costing just for a couple of days supplies over $300 u.s. and the streets are empty with no traffic but just an occasional bicycle and you know meetings of any kind like religious meetings church gatherings there they're prohibited pastors are gathering their churches with video conferencing and and preaching to them that way and but on a positive note while this is going on the message is getting translated in record numbers because no one can do their irregular jobs and so you know that we're getting the message friends are translated and on the hub and record numbers so brother Murphy has plans to and had plans to go into Congo with brother Dee oka to reach out to Chinese migrant workers there but due to the virus and the scare among the government the meetings have been postponed indefinitely because of travel again some travel restrictions and so on brother Murphy brother John Leigh they both have guys this to postpone the meetings for at least six months so taking this advice in consideration also with travel concerns and detainment which is one of our biggest problems in the situation because you know if we would get detained in a third-world country well it could be a very difficult situation right now there is a several cruise ships that are being detained at least one I know they're in Yokohama where that even the believers are reporting back to me that there are people on there with the iris and they're being detained and everybody kept quarantine and and their that they're not even being treated that well so they're just forced to stay on the ship and basically held prisoner under quarantine until they can finally get this past them and released and so you know due to taking all this in considerations with tribal concerns detainment brother wrong situation we're postponing the trip planned to Japan and the Philippines at this time and this is of course in accordance with our goal to minister to as many Eastern and Asian groups from India Burma Korea China Nepal and all of that those believers that we're going to meet us there in Japan and I regret this inconvenience but we're trying to use discretion and operate the best that we can and so we ask for your prayers about this it's not that we're not going we just are gonna have to put it on hold for a little while I think I think it was the Apostle Paul said that he had made a plans to go to a certain place but Satan he said is hindered so you know but we know God's bigger than Satan and we know that in the end all things will work together for the good of those that love God to them that are called according to his purpose amens I would that you would be in prayer with us about this situation also about the Chinese believers there and is there there's got to be a lot of suffering there ISM the economy is set down shut down again livelihoods are threatened the food supply and on and on and on it's a very very dire situation that many of those are finding themselves in at this time and and those are our brothers and sisters over there and so we want to remember them in prayer I you know I personally went there and met many of the ministers had ministers meetings with them in underground churches underground meetings with them in China and so you know I know even there present suffering is greater than the sufferings that I as and the repression that I saw there when I visited that country so I you know we want to keep these in prayer and ask the Lord so to intervene on their behalf and of course stop the plague from from reaching anyone any believer a man as we go forth in Jesus name if you'll stand together with me we'll go to prayer now at this time we're going to remember this I'm holding in my hand today a little little part two two going a little stuffed toy it's a little beanbag really but it's a cloth that we're we're going to be as sister Sharon wrestlers asked us to pray over for her nephew Jett rissler that the Lord would touch this baby this God that has life-threatening cancer so you know if this was your child your loved one your nephew your friend you would want someone of faith to be praying for you and I want you to bind together with me on the behalf for this child today in Jesus name Amen the needs of those that are in China Japan Philippines those that are disappointed of us not coming so let us let us pray about these needs today father as we bow before your throne of grace we want to thank you that there is always grace love and mercy in our time of need and we stand here today in thy name commissioned of God for this end time believing we have been sent here ordained for this hour for this time thou knowest every need your God I noticed every situation ever hearts desire Lord you know the need for this little baby here that we hold this little item in our hands to go in a little stuffed toy to comfort a little child that is dying you know what the doctors have said and the enemy is attacked Lord in this family that needs to be united with you Lord we know many times father things like this happens and you use it as an opportunity to bring that person that family to you tender their hearts in this moment lord I just pray God that you'll undertake for this baby it was mine Lord I would certainly clutch it to my heart and prayed the prayer of faith and asked the other believers to do the same so Lord today we just clutch this to our hearts and as Lord you clutch it to yours because you are one who can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities that you'll undertake for this baby Lord we rebuke this cancer and the cause of it and asked Lord now in the name of Jesus you use even this to bring them them to you to know you the Living God and father for the believers there in the Philippines and Japan and Lord I can only imagine the disappointment of hearing that we're not coming as we planned to do but Satan has hindered us and a virus into the world threatens world's economies maybe even the economy of our own Lord thou knowest everything but I had no your God above it all and I ask that you will show yourself to me Jehovah provider for the needs of the Chinese believers who are in confinement and quarantine and held captive than their own cities and homes and towns that you would move on the scene for your children everywhere Lord for those believers down in Japan Lord of over in the Philippines that are in need of you today that you would touch their lives around the world we believe you've got a bride around the world Lord of people you've called for your namesake wherever they're gathered today or have gathered I pray your blessings upon them exceeding abundantly ever needs supply Lord as we give all of this into your hands and commit our lives in your hands and you know Lord you even an part of this Hindery Satan has already struck down our brother Ron with something some sickness doctors are fearing cancer all of these things they're they're looking and probing them wondering what to do and have a fix but we realize that salvation is not of man salvation is of the Lord and that no doctor can heal and no medicine they can't give can heal in fact it tears down in destroys because of the knowledge that it contains evil with it Lord we pray for guidance for leadership at this time we pray for healing and deliverance in the name of the Holy Child Jesus for your servant brother Ron even for our brother Aaron that is here there's been suffering things in his body Lord we are grateful Lord for your goodness to us and we're part of that goodness contains a promise that says I am the Lord God that healeth all of that diseases so we take you at your word today that you are the healer and because you are the healer we can expect healing on our behalf because we know that it was it was paid for it Calvary and we receive it now individually every one for ourselves I asked your blessings upon this service today and the needs of your people everywhere those of us mungus Lord or God that are in the hospitals and those among us that are convalescing in the homes not able to come and and in situations like that our elderly Lord Father ever needs supply your your cognitive everyone Lord we asked in Jesus name that you bless your people thank you for your goodness Lord thank you now thank you for the word that we will open up the Bible today open it to our hearts and anointed we pray in Jesus name man a man god bless you turn with me to Revelation chapter 5 and verse 1 and we so appreciate all of the wonderful singing worship to the Lord today and asking God's blessings now upon all of the service today in a man I pray that you you have been coming praying as I've requested you to do and and just dedicating yourself and and just getting ready yourself individually so that God can move through your life a man that you can be a tool that God would use in this endtime not necessarily to preach it's as far as the pulpit ministry but in whatever capacity that God would call you in to use you for his glory Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weak not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by the blood and out of out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and then in Daniel chapter 12 I want to read from the verse verse and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even unto that time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever amen god bless you can be seated I'm going to be speaking today on our legal rights to the book of redemption and I told you I'm gonna be speaking several services about our legal rights so we're gonna just start here with some endtime events and then work from there into even personally what our rights are as a believer and I'll do this in subsequent services because we won't be able to get everything in one service but as we are we have just read in the context of the scripture we know that the book of Revelation is a symbolic book and of course it is it is called also the Apocalypse which is also known as the unveiling so it was something too that was veiled to be revealed and reserved to the to the endtime and when we really get down to it the book of Revelation has been person until four hour time until there comes an understanding and I believe that we're in the days of the understanding rather than in the days of the veiling so it is now the unveiling as brother Branham would preach the unveiling of God or the mighty God and veiled and so we are in a time where things that was written in symbolic form becomes known to an endtime people and so the Lamb himself is symbolic of Jesus and his redeeming work and here we see the Lamb standing to claim his rights to the book of the redeemed the book of redemption if we would look at the Lamb he's a very odd-looking lamb he he he looks there as with seven horns seven eyes all of these are again symbolic things that were written about the lamb and what he would do in his redeeming work and certainly it because it we know Jesus is not an animal he's not a woolly lamb but this was something symbolic so it's not really somebody with or some creature odd-looking animal with with forked hoods or two hooves that reaches and gets the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne but it is really symbolic of his redeeming work and what he has been doing through the ages and what he is doing in the end time and so at Calvary we know that Jesus did the purchasing work and he purchased our salvation he purchased our healing he paid it in full and and of course they mean that the book of Acts named the conclusion of the book of Mark tells how that he has sins and sits on the right hand of God and he begins his in seseri work paul will explain in the book of hebrews he will tell how that about the the priesthood of Jesus Christ that is not an Arabic priesthood but it is the priesthood of Melchizedek who who had no father or mother who had no beginning of life or ending of days and it was the eternal one and so he would be made a high priest in the order of Melchizedek and so again um as he as he does this he continues to do his work of intercession and we believe that even today he is still interceding on the behalf of his children and that he will continue to intercede until every child of God is manifested upon the earth and the last name is recognized in the book of Redemption and of course um that recognition is when God makes known to you who you are in Christ and and identifies you as a believer now Jesus does not have to cease one work to do another and I he purchased and that purchase works from for the first days on down to the last age until every son of daughter of his is purchased redeemed and ready for the rapture so there there is the ongoing purchasing power of his blood today that is efficacious - to purchase every sinner I remember the day that he took me back from the devil and he paid for it by the blood at Calvary but one day at an altar of a lie a ruined life was redeemed a man and Satan dinner had to take his hands off of me and of course City we here brother Branham say something very similar this in the future home he said one I'm I was his property but not now speaking of Satan one time that little woman that the well was that he reference here was his property but not now he came to loosen the grip a bit he loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon my life of on your life and now we are not his how often have you heard me say in prayer take your hands off of God's property hey man see have faith to claim your own that's your rights take your hands off of her take your hands off of him see faith will do it oh my and I say what a promise that remains today that we can even say to Satan take your hands off of God's property and we have been redeemed by the blood Satan has no right to us he has no right to you he has no right to remain in your mind you can cast him out at any time hey man he certainly had no right to remain in your soul because your soul is redeemed and he sealed out and can't get back him he has no right to come into your body and man it's your house and it's been purchased by God and your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost is for God's dwelling place not for Satan to dwell in so we have a right to tell the devil get off of God's property a man that you have been purchased by Christ your the purchase of the blood of Jesus the Bible said in first Peter 1:19 that you're redeemed with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot amen so we are purchased by the blood and that blood still has purchasing power hey man then there comes that time in your life where you are you are back from the devil you can remember you can point back to a time in your life where you were dead in sins and trespasses but you were bought from sins grip and from that from the from the grip of darkness and death and you have been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ and you no longer belong to any devil and man he has no claim on you and you have a right now as a son or daughter God to anything and everything that Jesus paid for in fact the whole book of Redemption is yours the whole promise of every word the entire inheritance belongs to you as a believer you are very wealthy and rich you're not impoverished you've got so many buses lay it right in the word and most of you are living below your privileges and need to look in there and see what belongs to you amen now jesus as the lamb will keep on purchasing and interceding as long as there's one name on the book of life that has not been redeemed and this this is the purpose of his intercession - to make sure and to guarantee that every name of the upon the book that was written and glory before the foundational world is purchased in their time and their AIDS in which they live this purchase and work would work down through the ages it works right now in our age it is it is afforded to every person today who is still lost in sin a man and but finally we are now in the hour of not just his purchasing work nor just his intercessory work but we are in the hour of his claiming work where he stands as pictured here in Revelation 5 taking the book and and of course he will do this literally when he calls the names of those book those in the book into a rapture because you see thee the believers are the book just as the lamb represents Christ the book represents all that is redeemed and so when he literally claims the book and that's still a future event that he will liberate everyone from the power of death and when he does we will be changed from mortal to immortality and man and not only the living will be changed but the dead in Christ will rise first but today we are in the time of his revelation when it is no longer symbols but it's now the time of the claiming the book to reveal its contents and to loose the seven seals and as he does he sends the revelations down to the seventh angel on earth so that this book will be open to the believer a man so now again what is this it is the opening of the wheel and the testament to ever believer so that you can stand as the lamb is doing and take the title to the book and inherit its promises and that's where we're at at this time because we must take our inheritance and claim what God has provided by redemption amen and so the hour is come to claim our rights I want to say that one more time because of what these words to have impact and Malorie has come to claim our rights this is where we're at we are in the claiming our where that a people are rising to claim what Christ has done for us are you with me now I you know I'm gonna share this little quotation and it's in the prayer but a brother branham's but I want to just kind of bring it down to thee in his prayer II said Heavenly Father the hour is here on the building's warm but it's the time the time has come and I remember once our dear Lord when you looked up and said father the hour is come the hour has come for what Oh glob the hour has come now for the people to believe hey man can we say that this morning the hour has come for the people to believe if there's ever going to be a believers there's got to be people to rise to the occasion Jesus looked ahead and he wondered will I find faith on the earth he say will I find buildings with my name on it or churches who gather in my name he said well I find faith this is what God is looking for in this day someone to believe a man because there's got to be someone to believe him in order to love him you cannot love him and not believe him and you cannot be married or United to him as a bride to the groom without love and that requires faith amen so the hours come to believe the hour has come for the falling away of the church and can we see that the hours come where religion would spread around the world without salvation and can't we see that even even many message churches are affected by that they got religion and no salvation for maga Bolinas denying the power thereof the hours come the hours come for your church to sighs hey mom Dowers come for your raise up out of the dust and shake her south and come to herself and realize positionally that she is the Church of the Living God and has rights over every demson blessing that you promise to her they are hers tonight God the hour has come amen now granite Lord and the hour has come now at this hour to pray for the sick he was about to have a prayer line and the Almighty God I pray you'll send your angel tonight in me go through this building he healed so many sick people that tomorrow there be former formal well stopped up everywhere in testimony going everywhere and people are testifying at the glory of God and let them know that the Church of God is rising and spreading her wings for that great flight that's coming God made men move away from them wish and them wish and hope tonight until a perfect understanding of God's plan and be healed amen god move us away from wish and hope to faith to what shall we start believing to we start expecting a man when we hear of calamities coming when we hear sickness striking Amen when we hear of its backing down or ministry or people and everywhere is time for people when we look at those chains that we change from hope I wish it could be you know but to people who say I believe that is God's will they see lever disease it's God's will that casts out ever devil it stops wielding for people to stand on his word and proclaim it and say it's mine it's my inheritance it's my promise is for me it's what my children it's for my uncie's it's wrong I'm waving that in the face of the devil because I claim and every bit of it is for you is for your children it's for them that are far off man it's for the loss of the unsaved and it's for the pratical to come back home it's for healing this for deliverance right down to the smallest child we're not to break and run we're to stand Michael stood up the lamb stood up it's time that you stand up it's the devil that's supposed to be running read your Bible hey man do you see anywhere in the Bible that we're instructed to run from the devil but I am instructed to submit myself to God and to resist the devil and he'll run so who's supposed to be the one running in this hour it ain't us it's a time that we stand like we never stood a man and as Martin Luther would say in his day when he resisted the Roman Catholic Church here I stand and I can do none other now you see it is it's a devil to be that is supposed to be running it's his time to run it is his time to scream don't tour - don't make us leave I mean it happened frequently under brother Browns ministry brother Timothy pointed out Wednesday night you know he hears the stream going from this one to that one a dark shadow and his voices that are being heard in that other dimension screaming oh you know help me help me help me help me to keep him disbelieving I'll be made to leave because the devil is powerless if he doesn't have something to work through [Applause] my man so you see he don't want to leave so he's going to tried to resist but it's up to you to submit yourself to God resist the devil so he'll be the one reven not the church backing down back down is the time to proclaim this word harder that we ever have preached healing more than we ever have preach salvation for the lost Lord that we ever have you say Mercy's over that's your problem not mine mercy never been over for me I've never preached mercy over and I never will preach mercy over as long as I preach it it's gonna be mercy you said how do you know that brother Tim because the only time I'll ever preach is immortal ha ha ha that's the only time I'll ever preach this is immortal and when I change them immortality mercy will be over but until then there's gonna be mercy and I'm going to preach the mercy I'm gonna preach a god rich in mercy hey man and I don't know when the seals are open to me as they should be to you we're gonna preach to be pardon God rich in mercy he cares do you care convinced and concerned we're going to preach a man of a God who who is a God of grace a God of mercy who heals who delivers who saves and he'll save to the uttermost any great friends then that there's still hope for your loved ones they're still mercy and man and even some who won't even make it in the rapture that there's still some when the Great Tribulation a multitude without number I'm telling you Wayman this God his ways is past night into now I mean he is wonderful I'm not willing that any should perish I'll do everything I can to save that make every provision for the tube for the Gentile for all even after the plan is carried home 144,000 sealed over there of the Jewish people what is that God's mercy then he don't forget anything and he won't forget you anyone forget your knee and you won't forget your loved one and his arm is not too sharp then it came save I don't care how far that boy that girl has wondered out and said let's ever thought get rich right out and in a moment's time change the whole picture [Applause] brother branham said what what is the church scared about evolved when I have always wondered what's the matter with the Pentecostal people he said they got enough faith to blow up the world hello somebody I'm man I you know they got enough faith for all kinds of healing but they're just afraid to use it that's the devil if we could break that shadow of blackness for the people something's going to happen and he said that's my purpose here and others wouldn't say that's my purpose here to break that shadow of blackness let's try to hold back God's promises because I got news for the devil the Holy Spirit has been released by the seventh angel message back to the church again with the fullness of the pillar of fire are you with me these are not band two classes of people once fundamentalist positionally they know where they are by accepting Christ positioned in him but they ain't got enough faith and I find Pentecostals a lot of faith but don't know who they are and he said it was like a man got money in the bank and can't write a check and the other ones they ain't got no money in the bank and he can ride the check he said if you ever could ever get the two together I believe something's coming together I'm gonna bleep it comes together in this message and member we know our position and we know how to write a check hey man he said if I could just get the Pentecostal people to realize their sons and daughters of God sitting in heavenly places right now in Christ Jesus that God foreknew before the foundational world and has ordained us to preach what are you scared about there's no matter what it is swing out there take God's Word and believe it no words this is our to stand he said again just reading a few of these he said if you can ever get the scare out of the church and the devil has done great work in putting scarecrows we got scarecrows against divine healing and then we got scarecrows against the prayer lines we got scarecrows against altar calls we got scarecrows about the move of God and people worshiping and the joy of the Lord somebody's afraid you're going to be fanatical well I was gonna say it's time we get fanatical hey man and this time we get who get happy about what we have and realize when you go to realize of what you got then you get happy about it it's the people who don't realize what they got they got a wheel that has never been open to them and I just got a problem with people saying today the book is unsealed and it's got less power in it now than when it had me boy it was open if it's open then it's got more power more blessings because we know more we see what our inheritance is and we can claim it as our solid viral cause it's been given to us I'm gonna take a drink while you get on board it ain't wine but I wish it was new wine and I hope I'm believing it's gonna get poured over this congregation this Mormon and I hope there's enough enough wine bottles in here that is emptied out the world enough that when he pours it out a man that you got to fumble up and ready to receive it [Applause] hallelujah he says again he says but you're scared you're afraid you don't realize your sons and daughters of God and now not we will be we are now sons and daughters of God not we as in the future and we won't be sometime in the future sitting in heavenly places but now we're sitting in heavenly places right now and now we are sons and daughters of God and it doesn't appear yet what we will be in the end but we know we'll see him but we'll have a body like his we'll see him as he is but now we are sons and daughters of God and the covenant is made to Abraham and his seed after him hallelujah the Covenant is ours so we see in our opening scripture Jesus the Lamb claim entitled claiming his rights John said I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and of the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain that's seven horns seven eyes we will find these are the seven spirits of God sent forth and all the earth these eyes and the seven horns let me quote from the prophet of God the seven horns means 7hs calls a horn means a kingdom so it's seven ages was the seven horns and seven churches are dispensations of the body of believers I just want to say I'm represented in the lamb are you represented in the lamb we see the messengers represented in the lamb seven eyes the second horns representing the seven churches which are symbolic of seven ages so again we are all represented and identified in the lamb a man so now if the lamb stands he has to stand with his seven horns he cannot stand and leave his horns on the ground horns are part of him is that right so devil the so he stands with the seven horns which represents seven dispensational ages of the church then if the lamb stands to take the book and loose its seals in the horns moves with the lamb to claim title to Adams loss inheritance somebody with me now so in Daniel 12 when Michael stood up the dead that were in the graves to them also hallelujah its resurrection and life time he says I am the resurrection of the life and though you were dead yet shall live that and that's more than a sermon it's a message our message our message today is that he is the resurrection and the life brother Brandon said that that's a bride coming up out of darkness and denominationalism was like a resurrection and in time in the bride coming of Christ and she raises up out of the tombs and denominationalism to show and declare that I am he that was dead and I am alive forevermore and you'll never put me back in a tomb of another denomination again you'll never sealed me away and I'll never go back down them to death but I'm alive forevermore and this bride will not go down defeated and she will not be put away in the grave but she let me change that's the entire message I am Alive I am not dead for the first one out of the graves out of the denominationalism we have come back to life again the dry bones are living call the life by message in the last day now you're still dry bones that's your problem but if you've got ears to hear you're gonna quit being dry bones Daniel chapter 12 where we read we see that again when Michael stood up the dead that were in the gray stood up and it's time for the dead listen carefully and yet at the same time do more than listen because it's really really important that you you respond pop properly when you hear the word of God and accept it for yourself but it's time for the dead and the barren wounds too to live from the wombs of barren women too to bring forth the joy of life and claim the James in her book can we say that can we say that it applies come on now it is time for for the for the for the Baroness would the wounds of the baron Souls to bring forth the joy of life and claimed the name the names of her lost sons and daughters and return of every prodigal back to the father hallelujah amen oh are you see again it is the time for the womb of the church to bring forth Jesus back to earth and every name written in the book to stand of their feet changed in a moment and quickly another we're in the our bullet you know I know the other day I just buried one of our loved ones but I would just want to say to you I still stand on the scripture that 1st Thessalonians 4 is not just a funeral text a man is a prophecy I want you to look at yourself as the interpretation of that prophecy that I am the alive and remain through the coming of the Lord and I have accepted his word and I'm not going to hinder the rest of them from the grave from coming up again but there will be a bride standing on her feet without spot without wrinkle without a blemish it's time for death to give way to victory and those wrapped in the grape cloths to throw them off we're not to be a dead church God has been waiting for us to die to the creeds the ideas of man and strand and it's our that we must take a stand the lamb stood to take the seals off the book and has sent us back the abstract that every age has had the title but this is the age of the abstract we're where that or that every promise is now made clear to belong to you I just wanted to share a little quotation as we as we look at this point and go forward this is a message for brother Branham of the great warrior Joshua and and so you know as we speak about this I want you to think of this that's supernaturally now the church that's the body of the Lord Jesus he says is this shadow as it was of the natural physical body of the Lord now said the church is his shadow on the earth are you with me now so he says if healings power visions if the things that Christ had in him has gone out of his shadow then Christ is paralyzed so his natural body sits paralyzed because that if his physical body moves his shadow will move with it and he says if we are in Christ by Holy Ghost baptism and by the way of the the body of Christ moves it'll move the same way on earth for this the church is a shadow of his body so now so is where we're thinking of this I want what just just to stop for a moment this emphasize what he's saying he says the body of Christ in heaven as he moves the church moves on earth so if there's no visions there's no miracles there's no healing then it's obvious in the Christ has to be paralyzed in heaven I wonder if this is why some of these guys are preaching that Christ is laying there comatose because they don't have any healing miracles are signs in their church so obviously to them they have to place Christ as comatose but that ain't Bible that's some man's excuse they make excuses for why God ain't in the church by trying to make the high priests Christ powerless and render him ineffective so therefore that doesn't have to be any movement in the church and the church sits dead as flem o'clock midnight twice dead and puffed up from the roots and they have no miracles I have no signs that no wonders I have no healing there's no towns there's no interpretation there's no gifts of the Spirit because their christ is a dead christ but that's not mine Christ that's a Christ of their own homemade theology but that's not the Christ of the Bible the Bible says he and he can be touched he can feel your infirmities he's not a comatose God sitting on a throne somewhere he's a living God a present God my healer cog for saving God I'll deliver God your God might be dead but my name your God may become Atos on a throne somewhere and unable to do anything about present situation but my name that's the Jesus is hatched out by some of these guys that are too smart and too big for their own britches but that's not a believer that's an unbeliever let me finish reading the quote now taking it out of the things of the world predestinated by God call of God elected by God children of God saved by God baptized in the body of Christ by the Holy Spirit feeling and made members of the body this body alive we're ready willing my shadow will move every time anything of my body moves that's true if I move my hand my shadow moves all right so Enda and the Holy Spirit Body of Christ the church will move just as Christ moose and if Christ in heaven can ever get his spiritual body on earth moving as he wants it to move watch for things to happen and it's beginning to come to life they paralyze it long enough but the Holy Spirit is bringing life to it and it's beginning to wake up and beginning to move because it sees its position hallelujah now then let me bring it home to you for the purpose of our Texas moment in Christ the lamb in heaven has stood to take the book and claim redemptive rights then his saddle the church must move on earth doing the same thing we must take the book we be by the lamp eyes own blood and claim I read them their rights that's what he's doing in the heavens that's what the prides gotta be doing on earth it's time for you to be in the heavens and claim your redemptive rights [Music] and you can't do with a closed book so everything that closes and everything that seals it away from the believer has to be removed every promise in the book becomes known to you and it's yours to claim hallelujah so if Jesus is claiming the book I'm claiming the book with him hallelujah it's the mighty crescendo of the shout turn with me to Revelation 10 we'll bring them verse 1 I'm just gonna go through this chapter because it speaks of anointing this is not this is not some 900 foot tall fictitious Jesus and all Roberts crafted this is not some giant this got his feet on the land and on the sea this is symbolic of him taking possession and he's got his feet on the earth and on the sea the land and the sea which represents to which from which comes two powers in the end time when there's a lot of time we could spend on all of these but for the sake of preaching today and not trying to teach I won't go and all of them but in Revelation 10 verse 1 and I saw another mighty angel now the this is what he has done when he says I saw another mighty angel he had already in Revelation 9 seen the mighty apollyon and apollyon was you know was um was a spirit that rose up that was the king over the bottomless pit and then there was the loosing of the spirits in the bottomless pit and things that was reserved for the end time and of course in there I'll tell you what give me a revelation 9 verse 1 and 2 because I'm gonna I guess I'm gonna do a little more teaching and preaching after all but look at this and the fifth angel sounded I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth I want you to notice this coordinates what revelation 12 of the fall of Satan from heaven and if you notice it was not a an angel descending it was an a and it was a star falling all right so he falls from a position which he has held over man as the Prince of the power of the air and he comes down and he has permission or the authority to open the bottomless pit and that's the age that we're living in where that there is actually Satan has been given permission to bring four demons that were reserved in Chains until this time that were been reserved and held down the Bible said that were held in the river Euphrates which is again a symbolic all the dividing line between Babylon and the promises of God so you see that we're held trying to get over into the promise but they could not do it and they're held captive there to the end time and they come down and are loosed and that bring their persecution in a physical manner against the Jews in a supernatural natural manner against the bride and we're under tremendous persecution supernaturally even though it's not so much physically in that we're all the way to jail and you know you got to get your backpack and run and all the other stuff because that's not our allotment our allotment is a rapture not a tribulations he's on the catches out in the nick of time are you with me Amen so we're we're not prophesying you in the tribulation we're not even worried about running from thee from the Antichrist we are standing now brother we the lamb is standing not running the bride stands are you with me now so he opened the bottomless pit to come to smoke a blinding delusion out of the pit and the Bible tells you in 2nd Thessalonians 2 that there will be a blinding delusion in the last days because that people don't have a love for the truth that they're turned over to a reprobate mind to do what is unseemly sighs you see right here the smoke of a great furnace and this smoke goes down and it permeates like smoke does into every crevice of humanity so we see it moving right out whoo I don't want to get in politics but who would ever thought we'd have a gay man that could even be considered as a president in the United States whoever would have thought we would have a communist socialist that could boldly stand up and want to lead America into communism who could have ever thought it who could have thought we would have such liberals lined up in our halls of Congress under the point there is no discerning of even life itself and the sacredness of life is not even sacred anymore who who would have ever thought let me get on the other side who would ever thought we'd have a round you know a rascal a scallywag in the Panda in the presidency that wouldn't it would actually have had more gumption about him than some of these others who are boldface a blatant open sinners who would ever thought that but we're seeing America changes from revelation 13 where she is prophesied in Revelation 13 there's 13 stars 13 stripes well you know it she's a woman and this based on the number thirteen found in the thirteenth chapter of Revelation and she raises up like a lamb but then begins to speak like the dragon since she starts off in freedom of religion and she winds up over here as a dragon speaking like the devil and I because of death hell than ever my imaginable sin she opens a bottomless pit and the roses smoke out of the pit and the Sun now over here in the Revelation 10 his face says it were the sun shining and here the sun the word is locked out by these and they are in delusion and the air that's your atmosphere is darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and under the cover of all of this every kind of demon spirit raises up millions of them out of the bottomless pit now the Bible gives him a number of thousands of thousands but it really is in the Greek its innumerable and in so many we couldn't count them all so we just give them a big number and then and there's so many of them and here they are permeating the people of the earth so now you know Paul I mean John now is is looking at all this his name is apollyon and he's a for you boys his name is also a baton he's a baton you get that you got and there there he rises up and he's a leader of this rebellion that we're seeing around the world and it comes down into every facet of life and it touches every race it touches every home it touches all people and it's a blinding delusion a mom and so the word is and the atmosphere is darkened by the reason of the smoke of the pit so now here he says I see this happening in the earth I see more unbelief rising than ever I've seen cédric's a height that is never before somebody with me it gets described in the book of Revelation that her smoke of a you know a riot of her sins rather rises up before the throne of God and then I want you to notice in Revelation 10 1 and then he is he's reflected he says nearly he concludes in Revelation 9 the worship of every kind of of God an evil thing and you can imagine the confusion and so but look after that look he said but I want you to see something different I want you to see that Satan hasn't won I want you to see that there's somebody else in the equation and I saw from aliens look away from Abadan yep away from the spirit saw another mighty angel hallelujah clover the cloud a rainbow in his head his face always in the brilliance of the Sun his countenance is all open it's not a closed but his love his face his word is shining in his power and his feet Oh his body has got the Holy Ghost they are s pillars of fire and he takes him places his feet on the earth and the sea and he holds down the power of those that enemy and he's got in his right hand to power a little book and it's not closed it's open there is an anointing that has come down hallelujah I can preach right now the mighty angels that we're under there you know Moses tried to me Pharaoh without the anointing but once he got in the midst of the pillar of fire a man he was a different man he comes now anointed with the mighty angel hallelujah under that annoying - he defeats Egypt he speaks the word he opens up read sees every hindrance has to go because he's under an anointing I tried to tell you this morning you are anointed from a tree you are 19 for our you are going to overcome you are 19 to put your black oh the devil has limit even underneath that devil hallelujah I have preached it to the anointing of the Lord this morning but people who know their God and shall do exploits of people who are not yet born in time prophecy and he had in his hand a little book open I want you to know every believer has that book in his hand and I'm gonna show you in the scripture and he had in his hand verse 3 says and he cried with a loud voice now this word cried means he shouted with a loud voice as when ailed rollo a lion roar so you see it is a shout this is the endtime prophecy the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout his coming is in three different phases you say his cummins in a moment twinkling of an eye no no that's the change of the body in a moment twinkling of ah his coming is in stages he will come as the word come into a prophet he will come from the word - the word being made flesh and then he will come as the groom to take away that word that bride that book into the heavens now so you see the rapture is is that exactly like the verse coming the first coming started with a prophet a restorer right a man a prophet who began to announce the the coming of the Messiah the endtime prophecy happens the same way behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord so before I burn it I'm gonna send the lives of the Prophet his purpose will be to turn hearts back to the faith of the father's this will be his purpose John would have that similar purpose when he would come forth and he would he would prepare the heart of the father's there to receive the children and this way that God does exactly the opposite he prepares the hearts of the children to receive the message of the Apostolic fathers so we return back to the original truth in the last days how many's with me now so now so he shouts as a lion worth you know because the lion roars everything else has to shut up because he is the final say now when this mystery is given to a prophet I want you to notice it also is comes in in a way look in Revelation 10 7 now this shows what we have read shows when he takes the book he cries with the loud voice as the lion roars and in verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel so now we see the seventh angel has got to have a voice there's got to be a message come when he said began to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so every age has looked for this day and so this when this mystery is given to a prophet the seventh angel then he sounds it's like the blasts of a trumpet and he shouts out his message finishing the mysteries of God amen now again verse eight now notice now so now we have moved as we go we've had the shout of the mighty angel we have the voice of the seventh angel now look in Revelation 10 a and the voice which I heard from heaven speaking to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth along the sea and upon the earth and I went up to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said take it eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in that mouth sweet as honey and as I took I took the little book out of the hand of the angel or the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so when John takes the book now again we're looking at something what's your symbols because John is representing the reading now remember he does this in Revelation chapter four verse one that John he is caught up at the end of the ages after Laodicean concludes and he is caught up a door is open unto heaven and he hears a trumpet talking to him says come up hither and john says immediately that i was in the spirit and behold a throne was said in the heavens so you can see in all is a type it concludes when the Laodicean age finishes and concludes it will conclude with a rapture and it hadn't happened yet we may be in processes other than we are but it hasn't happened yet are you with me Amen but John here represents here symbolic of the believers it's not just him he's representing us all so now he changed the book and he digest the book and he symbolizing the Bride of Christ when we take the book then we to shout amen we there's a message we're prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings now the tendency now listen to me real carefully the tendency are the message believers has just simply been to take revelation ten seven out of Revelation 10 the chapter ten as though it was separate from the other parts of that scripture revelation 10 7 let's look at it this is not a stand long verse this is a part of a process of happenings it is not all that God's doing in the end time sitting in a profit it is only part of what God's doing in the end time though it's an important part will not under emphasize that but the tendency of believers has been to take this scripture just as out of chapter 10 is do it worth separate from the other parts of that scripture but it's not a standalone verse revelation 10 7 focuses on this sounding of the voice of the seventh angel and the finishing of the mysteries but as I said sin and a prophet was only part of what God is doing in the end time now you cannot have revelation 10 7 happening in this age without also have a revelation 10 1 as the mighty the sending of the mighty angel anointing coming down with the once sealed but now open book and present right now and claiming possession entitled by putting above the feet of his bride body as pillars of fire on the land and the sea with the beasts and the powers of Hell underneath his trenches feet hallelujah hey man just strikes me right there Church in the first picture it shows these demons it shows the king of the bottomless pit but in Revelation 10 it shows them all under your feet [Applause] hallelujah why get stuck in revelation 9 where we can look at revelation 10 and see these a evil demons are now beneath us that God has given you power over the American spirit and over there hang over that Roman spirit come on those two spirits that rises out of the land where there were no people which Miss America and the other haven't see where there was multitudes of Kindred's and tongues and people and yet God gives you power oh man why didn't fear the devil he's under your feet why didn't fear of the smoke and the torment and all that others I'm going through this scene with needs under your feet and revelation 10 8 or excuse me revelation 10 7 it's it happens in this age as we are anointed by Christ in this in time where was that anointing that was a 19 of Jesus Christ and the ministry of Jesus Christ in the seventh angels message we saw the Ministry of Christ repeat itself the healings the miracles the dominion over sin and diseases and evil come on did we see that but now you can't and here we go you can't have revelation 10 7 without having revelation 10 8 other people also rise into claim in the book of their inheritance and after digesting it and keeping it down you know there are a lot of people try to eat it they can't keep it down come on mmm but you made it you kept it down yeah someone has been difficult to swallow something up it's a little difficult to keep down but we just keep swatting it down yeah it makes your belly bitter but I'm gonna tell you it'll also begin to work on the inside it's turned on the inside of you until it comes out as a prophecy zabis prophesy again hallelujah hey man suggestions justice brother branham had a ministry so will the bride prophesy and do the mighty works of God now these these this all has to do with a word bride now remember I want to remind you true doctrine has its miracles the people are claiming doctrine and true doctor and there's no miracles but you cannot have true doctrine and not have miracles signs must follow believers God went with them confirming the word with signs following so signs must follow the word if we got the word there must be signs so don't tell me you got the word oh we don't believe in the gifts of the Spirit we don't believe in speaking in tongues we don't believe in prophesy we don't believe we don't believe well that's right you don't believe but I do and there's a difference but you see a true doctrine has miracles doctrines let me establish it without miracles is false doctrine it is not the doctrine of Jesus mark chapter 1 verse 27 and they were all amazing so much that the question among themselves saith what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey Him this is the trademart of true doctrine now so a word bride will be a bride known that she has the word by her miracles because God is always known by her miracles by his miracles now I listen to listen this in the Patmos vision brother Branham says that Paul said the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flame and cutting sword it went to the consciousness of men and like a surgeon's knife and cut out the diseases and set the captives free and ever where those early believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and God confirmed that word with signs following the sick were healed devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last agent is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride Oh little flop you little Minardi hold on to the word fill your mouths and your heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom hallelujah amen so the word has never failed and it will not fail in those last days it'll be in the mouth of believing Christians not telling you what there's got to be a people in this day that's gets ready to speak to their mountains [Applause] doesn't matter what they are speak to them a man Jeter brother branham again said when Jesus on earth he said believe us now not I'm in the father and the father and me the words that I speak in you I speak not on myself but the father that dwelleth in me he do it the work John 14 10 therefore here is most evidently set forth the perfect manifestation of God and the son was by the indwelling spirit manifest in him in Word and works and this is exactly what we have been teaching all along when the bride will get back to me and they were bride and that's what we're hearing we're hearing it from all corners you got to be the word it's the word now brother Tim it's the word you know it's the word we we got to have the word you know it's now the word all right so when the would the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very wants that Jesus produced the word is God the spirit is god they're all one and one cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the Spirit of God he will have the Word of God and the truth is if you have the word you're going to have the spirit and if you have the spirit I have to have the manifestation and you'll know if the Spirit is there by the manifestation if there is no manifestation there's no word there it's all Creed's dumbest ideas at man Sang's must follow them to me hey man again he says and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost and by experience it will be a Pentecostal church how's that for your nostalgia a man by experience it will be a Pentecostal church it's a shame people call that in the Salcha instead of something that is present tense but for some that's all you got is nostalgia you remember what used to be but to have nothing present now you have no power you have no healing that no miracle and no signs follow them them that believe let me read it and if the church is the true church I mean I'm part of that true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be a Pentecostal church and there will be tons and interpretation and prophecy and healings and God will be in her myths and God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has hallelujah and she will be unorganized don't forget that so all your kingdom builders go line up somewhere else you don't belong in the bride amen now I just want to go on record this morning and I'm I don't have an axe to grind I'm just saying I want to thank I want to thank my critics and my friends who called me Pentecostal because I am Pentecostal and please don't say Arlene Pentecostal or then I got one foot in Pentecost because you see you know it's like a pedigreed horse he knows where he come from he can search his he his records back all the way back hey man you know I done a little study let me just stop for a minute take a rest then a little study on my own ancestry and you know you know I always wonder where you come from and just recently I traced my the Pruitts all the way back to into Virginia there in the up in the Shenandoah Valley I probably can do you brother on but more on the spirit side than the physical but then way you know I we had a little something going on you know there was some blood tests that went on to kind of find out our DNA and sister Jessica thought you know surely the atoms would descend from the president's you know surely you know we could go back to John Adams John Quincy you know she she just had all of these wonderful feelings you know we're gonna be we're presidential I know Joey's I've married a descendant of the president and he gets a blood test and comes up with relatives he didn't know about he finds out he's not an albums after all he's a Twinner better than being at work he's the tweener can I be mother Jill one for one time this year so anyway I I did a little bit of research on ours and goes back and you know about the same time that they were wondering if they were presidential and went back to mine and found out my my seventh great-grandmother was the daughter of John Adams and her brother was John Quincy Adams but you know blood tests will give you keys to who you are and I want you to know if you're born of God a blood test we're sell yourselves and daughters of God and your pedigree you pedigreed all the way back to Jesus Christ back to the day of Pentecost I family you can see where you entered this life and you've got a right to this inheritance hallelujah hallelujah to me I could trace myself back to the Pilgrim Fathers and back to face myself back to Plymouth Rock but I tell you something greater than that I can't reach my setback backs [Applause] do the same Holy Ghost idle a title deed [Applause] hallelujah you told me pinnacle celaya pinnacle so Peter was a Pentecostal Paul as a Pentecostal we're a Pentecostal but I've been filled with the same Holy Ghost get bad on the day of Pentecost I've got an inheritance and the Holy Ghost by blood cast have opened the book to me and it's mine oh yes it's mine as the musicians come it says you know I

Plymouth Rock I came from glory and I'm going back to glory [Music] man God is my father I know who I am I'm a son of God and he gives me a whole checkbook and I know how to ride out checks brother Branham tells us in the Laodicean age and this is in his message let me quote it from him he said I like to see a real pedigree Christian not packing his letter he's a Methodist last week in a Baptist this week and a Pentecostal this week and a pilgrim holiness next week he don't know who this Pappy or his mammy is but let me tell you a man that's borne out the Spirit of God can take you plumb back to the day of Pentecost can tell you he's pedigreed Pentecostal a man I want to be Pentecost from the top of my head to the soles of my feet I don't lessen when I see the book up and I see it open
