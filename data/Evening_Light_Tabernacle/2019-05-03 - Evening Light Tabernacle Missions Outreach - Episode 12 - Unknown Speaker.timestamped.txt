[0:05] hello everyone we are the ministry team
[0:10] at evening light Tabernacle we're so
[0:12] glad that you joined with us again today
[0:14] and we trust that you'll be blessed and
[0:17] you'll invite your friends to come and
[0:18] join with us and share this on Facebook
[0:21] or wherever you're listening to this
[0:23] today we've been talking about the
[0:27] changing of dispensations where that the
[0:31] dispensation of the law ended to go into
[0:35] the dispensation of grace or the
[0:37] dispensation of the the Jews and it
[0:41] turned into the Gentiles today we want
[0:43] to carry that a bit further as we
[0:46] discuss this and we was talking about
[0:49] how the end time will be a process a
[0:53] dispensation of the fullness of times
[0:55] when everything is wrapped up and you
[0:58] will find that even in Christ in that
[1:01] day the Jewish dispensation would come
[1:05] tune in is it would all be wrapped up
[1:07] and finished in Jesus Christ amen
[1:12] well we have the angel of God appearing
[1:16] to Zacharias and the visitation of the
[1:21] supernatural and how that the
[1:24] supernatural began to work and and
[1:27] angelic visitations and prophesies began
[1:32] to be fulfilled and light being shown
[1:34] the description one thing about this was
[1:37] that Israel was a barren woman she had
[1:40] not brought forth this promised child
[1:44] the Messiah you know as Isaiah's
[1:47] prophecy had said unto us a son is born
[1:50] unto us a child is given his name will
[1:53] be called Emmanuel and also it says in
[1:56] Isaiah that the government would be upon
[1:58] his shoulders and so now the government
[2:02] the very law would be fulfilled in him
[2:04] as he shouldered the very law of God and
[2:09] fulfilled that law right the word
[2:13] fulfilled
[2:14] Jesus made it a statement in Matthew I
[2:20] believe it was he said I did not come to
[2:22] destroy the law but I came to fulfill
[2:24] the law many times people look back at
[2:27] the Old Testament and they say they
[2:29] disregard it all together that's the Old
[2:30] Testament and this is the new but Jesus
[2:33] attitude was not to disregard the Old
[2:35] Testament and it's at all Jesus quoted
[2:38] the Old Testament Paul quoted the Old
[2:42] Testament Jesus was specific I didn't
[2:47] come to destroy the law I came to
[2:50] fulfill the law what would that mean
[2:52] what do you think that would mean if
[2:54] anyone has comments on her well I think
[2:56] that he would take the very very
[2:59] scriptures and things such as would just
[3:03] name a few just you know that he would
[3:05] be the Lamb the sacrifice he would he
[3:09] would also implement a new Sabbath rest
[3:11] which would be the Holy Ghost he would
[3:14] he would fulfill the feast actually he
[3:18] would literally do this that is his
[3:21] crucifixion and so on like that um but
[3:24] you know I as we're speaking about this
[3:27] let's go back in our mind about this
[3:30] woman Israel she was under expectation
[3:33] and she she had was pregnant with the
[3:38] word a seed a word that it said that she
[3:43] would conceive and bring forth a messiah
[3:45] to the world and she had been expecting
[3:49] this for many many years and yet seemed
[3:52] to be just a barren woman there was
[3:55] another woman that was in this era of
[3:58] time her name was Elizabeth she was a
[4:01] barren woman too and she had never had a
[4:04] child and the Bible said in Luke 1 that
[4:09] depth Zechariah that he went in as the
[4:12] custom of the priests office to burn to
[4:15] incense before the Lord and and the
[4:18] whole multitude of the people were
[4:21] without during the time of the incense
[4:25] now so you got a woman here Elizabeth
[4:28] who is barren and you got a people who
[4:31] are barren and both of them are prey and
[4:33] there's been many many prayers but it
[4:36] looks like you know God's forgotten his
[4:38] promise it'll never happen I'll always
[4:41] be barren you know all of these were the
[4:44] thoughts that were going through their
[4:46] mind and God's answer to that was to
[4:50] suddenly appear to Zechariah and
[4:55] reconfirm the promise and say you're
[4:58] gonna have a child and not only that but
[5:01] Israel is gonna have a child and this
[5:04] child this child that Israel will have
[5:07] will be for RAM by the one you're going
[5:11] to have right and this will be John the
[5:13] Baptist and he will go forth in the
[5:15] spirit and the power of Elijah and so it
[5:18] goes to show you exactly the very plan
[5:21] of God in great details how that in this
[5:25] dispensation as the gospel goes in that
[5:30] he's going to forerun the first coming
[5:32] of the Lord with Elijah the prophet and
[5:36] he will do the same at the close of the
[5:39] dispensation as we're under expectation
[5:42] again for the Messiah for Jesus to
[5:45] return back to the earth again he will
[5:47] do it by also sending Elijah the Prophet
[5:50] wonderful alright so we don't want to
[5:53] miss the cone of the Lord I don't think
[5:56] anybody wants to miss though so you have
[5:58] a people the Jewish people who were well
[6:01] studied in Scripture I mean they they
[6:03] knew the scripture and as you mentioned
[6:04] in the last session when we spoke you
[6:07] said that it never mentions the first
[6:09] coming even being a mystery that they
[6:11] knew that he was to come they knew that
[6:13] Elias was the first come that the
[6:15] disciples asked Jesus we thought a lot
[6:17] and Elijah would first come so this work
[6:19] the common knowledge as it were so what
[6:21] caused the people to not recognize
[6:24] John's ministry and what calls them to
[6:27] not recognize Jesus being the
[6:30] fulfillment of the Messiah if to us is
[6:33] so obvi
[6:34] looking back and if they knew the
[6:36] scripture so well and he came and
[6:38] fulfilled everything to a tee what
[6:41] caused him to miss it I think you have
[6:44] to look at the attitude of the people if
[6:45] you go to Malachi 1 and you look at the
[6:48] end of the Old Testament the scripture
[6:50] says the son honoureth his father and a
[6:52] servant is Master if I then be a father
[6:55] where's my honor and I felt
[6:56] and now if I be a master where's my fear
[6:58] saith Lord of Hosts Oh priests that
[7:01] despise my name and you say where have I
[7:03] despise thy name you offer polluted
[7:06] bread upon my altar and you say wherein
[7:08] have we polluted thee and that you say
[7:10] the table of the Lord is contented if
[7:11] you offer a blind for sacrifice is it
[7:14] not evil
[7:14] if you offer the lame and sick is it not
[7:17] evil offer it now until the governor
[7:19] will be pleased with it or accept that
[7:22] person sale or host notice they begin to
[7:24] offer what they don't please God their
[7:26] attitude was not to bring what they knew
[7:28] please God but it was what they felt
[7:30] like well we'll just do it it's a custom
[7:32] we're gonna offer this and you find this
[7:34] is at the end of the Old Testament that
[7:37] relieves our Pro lose us into the New
[7:40] Testament the own coming of the Messiah
[7:42] the Son of God and you find there their
[7:45] mentality was that we don't really care
[7:47] so they had become lukewarm even in
[7:49] their traditions yeah absolutely
[7:52] actually the Malachi talks somebody said
[7:54] you made a poor Fame thing yes if you
[7:57] look at that word profane it means to be
[7:59] made common to become common to be just
[8:02] you know that no longer is a you know
[8:05] all for the lamb a spiritual thing but
[8:08] just you know out of duty you know I'm
[8:10] with you I'm just gonna go take whatever
[8:12] I got and you know they used to have to
[8:14] have a blemish of a land without blemish
[8:16] or that spot without you know and to
[8:18] take it up there and now they're just
[8:20] taking the taking the lamb the seek and
[8:22] we see and offering so here God here it
[8:25] is you know so could it be that they
[8:27] didn't even maybe with lip service they
[8:29] did but they didn't even truly expect
[8:31] fulfillment of the scriptures that they
[8:34] claim to believe well I think it had
[8:37] come to that that they really in their
[8:40] heart was not expecting fulfill
[8:44] anymore they had they had just their
[8:46] faith had just really died within them
[8:49] and they were a faithless generation yet
[8:52] on the other hand that we're giving lip
[8:54] service right saying oh yes the Messiah
[8:56] will come and we're looking forward to
[8:58] just like today just as we're looking
[9:01] for Jesus to come in the moment and and
[9:03] living what are you offering yeah what's
[9:06] the sacrifice which synagogue had it
[9:08] right so wherever we get a group of men
[9:11] we're always going to have a group of
[9:14] opinions and the Israel is a nation who
[9:19] had one law and one God was very divided
[9:22] in their beliefs yeah and so everyone
[9:25] had a different way man has his own way
[9:28] God's ways are not our ways
[9:30] so God at the changing of this
[9:33] dispensation he sends the spirit of
[9:36] Elijah to prepare the way of the Lord
[9:39] because the Lord has a way the man has a
[9:43] way right churches have a way but God
[9:46] has a way and he was the voice of one
[9:49] crying in the wilderness preparing the
[9:51] way of the Lord and his message was
[9:53] repentant yes yeah because in order to
[9:56] come to God we must repent of our own
[9:58] way our own expectations and come God's
[10:02] Way yeah notice and I think it's more
[10:05] than just a repentance of sins of saying
[10:07] Lord I'm sorry for being a sinner but I
[10:11] think I think it's also a coming
[10:13] cleaning from man's traditions and man's
[10:16] ideas and a repentance a turning back to
[10:21] the Word of God Lord yes yeah we found
[10:23] here Malachi 4 and verse 5 says behold I
[10:25] send unto you Elijah the Prophet before
[10:28] the coming of the Great and dreadful day
[10:30] of the Lord and notice what he's gonna
[10:32] he's gonna turn to hearts yeah he sees
[10:35] their attitude he sees ur neglect but he
[10:38] says he's going to turn the heart of the
[10:39] father's to the children and then the
[10:41] heart of the children back to the
[10:42] father's let's not come and smite
[10:44] there's with a curse
[10:45] so God's even telling them at the end of
[10:48] the Old Testament that I'm gonna see in
[10:49] you a prophet I'm gonna send you Elijah
[10:51] and his job is to turn the heart of the
[10:53] fathers in the heart of the children
[10:55] back to the to the Word of God praise
[10:58] the Lord
[10:58] well we're talking about the lame and
[11:00] blind sacrifices and whatever today I
[11:04] think it's it's the same thing that we
[11:07] can find today in Christian Christianity
[11:10] that there's become such a lukewarm this
[11:13] and I take whatever I have to offer you
[11:15] to God right you know so we bring in
[11:18] rock and roll we bring in our own
[11:20] entertainment and worship of other gods
[11:23] and and incorporate it in with
[11:27] Christianity and and we offer sacrifices
[11:30] with blemish or you know or yeah I can't
[11:34] come on Wednesdays and I'll come when I
[11:36] feel like coming and when I can get them
[11:37] when it's convenient when it's
[11:39] convenient for me and and the scripture
[11:41] cried out against those blemished
[11:43] sacrifices and John comes out and cries
[11:45] out repent yes but you're dealing with
[11:47] the proud people of people that to
[11:50] repent is to admit I've been wrong true
[11:52] and now I feel like you run into that in
[11:54] today's Christianity
[11:56] what'll I need to repent for I'm it I go
[11:58] to church yeah what do I need to repent
[12:00] for I you know me and my mama and my
[12:02] family's been going to this church for
[12:03] 50 years with Christians and so there
[12:06] there is a stiff-necked nough says it
[12:09] were as he you know refers to him in the
[12:11] Bible a stubbornness to not to not want
[12:14] to repent and not to even look into the
[12:17] Word of God I mean to even really look
[12:20] into it to see what it actually says
[12:22] about our day and our and for this
[12:25] reason people are missing their day of
[12:27] visitation my heaviness you find a
[12:29] revelation 3:15 John is speaking but
[12:33] he's speaking under the anointing of the
[12:34] Holy Spirit he says I know thy works
[12:35] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[12:37] would that that worked cold or hot so
[12:39] then because thou art lukewarm and
[12:40] neither cold nor hot I was spew thee out
[12:43] of my mouth he's speaking to the
[12:44] Laodicean Church if you go back and you
[12:46] study the histories of Laodicea Laodicea
[12:49] was a very rich city they had they had a
[12:53] medical school they had things that they
[12:58] very industrious they Laodicea was and
[13:01] had to travel routes one was East and
[13:02] West was north
[13:03] the label Cielo was at the junction of
[13:05] his where they meant and so they had
[13:07] everything but there was one thing that
[13:08] label to see a lot they had the wealth
[13:11] they had the medical school they had
[13:14] industry but they didn't have water
[13:16] supply and so you find it here he's
[13:19] telling them I would that thou wert cold
[13:21] or hot so there were Springs that would
[13:23] come from aqueducts there would be hot
[13:26] springs that would come down by the time
[13:28] they got to label to see it they were
[13:29] lukewarm they were good if they were hot
[13:31] because it was used for medical purposes
[13:32] there was another one that flowed in
[13:35] then it was cold and it was another
[13:37] nearby city and it was good for
[13:39] refreshment but notice he said I would
[13:41] that work cold because it's refreshing
[13:44] or hot because it could be used for
[13:46] medical purposes but because you
[13:48] lukewarm you even got your you don't got
[13:50] to wear your you know your cooled off
[13:52] and that word means spewed out of my
[13:55] mouth means you make my stomach sick and
[13:57] I can't contain it right and so he just
[13:59] spews it makes him sick
[14:01] and that's what they would do to make
[14:02] somebody vomit up and that day they
[14:04] would give him lukewarm water and so
[14:07] Jesus is tell them you're say you're
[14:09] cold I mean you say you're rich you're
[14:10] increased with Goods you got all this
[14:12] they were more concerned about what they
[14:14] could produce than what they were the
[14:16] Word of God and we find that same aspect
[14:19] in this day and age we have so much
[14:21] knowledge so much wealth so much
[14:23] everything but we're not concerned about
[14:24] the Word of God and we find the people
[14:27] that's not hot nor cold goodness talk
[14:32] about the expectation or maybe the lack
[14:36] thereof but you know as you said I think
[14:39] maybe in the previous episode there was
[14:41] somebody God always has somebody
[14:43] somebody that's expecting somebody
[14:46] that's holding on somebody that's
[14:47] believing no matter what the situation
[14:49] is there's been 400 years if it's been a
[14:51] thousand years it's been 2,000 years
[14:53] somebody's gonna be expecting you know
[14:56] it talks about in Luke 2 he talks about
[14:59] that and there was a man in Jerusalem
[15:00] whose name was Simeon and the same man
[15:04] was just and devout waiting for the
[15:06] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[15:09] was upon him and it was revealed to him
[15:11] by the Holy go
[15:12] he was should not see death before he'd
[15:14] seen the Lord's Christ my goodness so
[15:17] somebody was looking for him you knew it
[15:20] was apparent and I believe in this time
[15:22] as bad as it is and his horrible disease
[15:24] and and like you said all the things
[15:26] that's going on there somebody that's
[15:28] really truly expecting amen it's been
[15:31] revealed to them been revealed to them
[15:33] and and they believe with all of them
[15:35] and then for the consolation and this
[15:38] was the old man don't matter what age
[15:40] you are how you know how you are what
[15:43] you are is it's holding on in faith
[15:46] believes God's gonna fulfill it the
[15:49] sense he appears to those that believe
[15:51] yes and so you have people say well we
[15:53] don't see miracles we don't see this he
[15:55] don't and then there next thing is he
[15:57] don't do that anymore we're right there
[15:59] you show why you don't see those things
[16:01] you don't believe yes miracles are for
[16:03] believers God moving in our midst is for
[16:06] believers right it's not for people or
[16:08] sitting back who says he don't do that
[16:09] you're right he's not gonna do that for
[16:11] you if you're not expecting and holding
[16:13] on with all your heart true
[16:15] which is why that's gonna be necessary
[16:17] there'd be a restoration in the end time
[16:19] to turn the hearts back right to the
[16:21] faith of the fathers and it turn us back
[16:24] to believing again yeah so you had a
[16:27] lukewarm Jewish Church as it worked and
[16:29] in Jesus Christ in the flesh walking
[16:32] amongst them doing signs doing wonders
[16:35] and there were but there were those that
[16:37] caught it there was and Jesus really
[16:41] gave us insight to the spiritual
[16:43] condition of that Church of that day I
[16:45] mean we you know he's only has a three
[16:48] and a half year ministry but the Gospels
[16:50] is the response of the religious
[16:53] community the believing Jews when Christ
[16:56] came he as you had quoted to me recently
[17:00] he came to his own yeah yeah and his own
[17:04] received him not
[17:05] and it gives us insight to the spiritual
[17:09] condition of the church Jesus pleading
[17:11] search the Scriptures for in them you
[17:14] think you have eternal life
[17:15] but isn't that label to see you who were
[17:17] it shows him on the outside of it
[17:19] not absolutely trying to get back in and
[17:23] we mean it
[17:23] you know said it and then turns and says
[17:26] if any man if anyone what open the door
[17:29] I'll come in every opportunity yes and
[17:33] and the Jewish people were given every
[17:35] opportunity yes so there was great grace
[17:38] that was being poured out in a day just
[17:40] before judgment struck a man named amen
[17:43] and so the Jews would actually go into
[17:47] 2,000 years of great tribulations and
[17:51] stress upon a people because of
[17:55] rejecting their Messiah and not seeing
[18:00] their day and their hour and their
[18:02] visitation so you know this kind of
[18:05] brings us up to the end of this session
[18:08] today or we have been talking about the
[18:11] ending of the Jewish dispensation and
[18:15] how it would then begin a new
[18:18] dispensation a new order of divine order
[18:21] where God would do a work in a people
[18:23] and he would call out a church for his
[18:26] namesake and we'll be talking about that
[18:28] in our next session as we talk about how
[18:31] that the law came to its end as Jesus
[18:36] would fulfill it and we are in another
[18:38] day of fulfilling a description hey god
