looking for you to move lord and touch lives we ask you in jesus name amen amen hallelujah and turn to hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 and also genesis 22 and verse 11. amen it's good to be back in the house of the lord it's always good when they said unto me david said i was glad when they said unto me let's go into the house of the lord it's wonderful to come together and rub shoulders with one another and just get all that old label to see off of us and things we've been through and just let it be washed from us it's a wonderful thing for believers to be together amen hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever also genesis 22 and 11 and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do anything unto him for now i know that thou fierce god seeing thou has not withh held thy son that only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the angel of the lord called into abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this same and has not withheld thy son thy an only son that in blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply that seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice amen we let you be seated like to speak to you this evening on jesus christ the same possessors of the gates amen that's that is us possessors of the gates amen but so i i was looking at this this uh story as we've read of abraham and we know the story of how he waited for many years for a son and and waited for the promise to come to pass and you know no doubt as the days would tick on and it would go on by and time would tarry it seemed like it would never come to pass but the scripture says he staggered not at the promises of god he held on and and you know he held on in the hard times of his life and and and he would also say you know as in hebrews 6 it would talk about how god made the promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing i will bless see multiply and i will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise and and sometimes that's the way it is with us as believers it seems like things are never going to come to pass it's never going to fall in place it's never going to be where we want it to be but we're to patiently endure we're to hang on even in the hardest of times and and when it gets difficult and situations around us and you know life is not affair this life that we live is not a fair life amen it's like as a saying goes life ain't fair there's things that we go through there's things that we face and it seems like that the prophecies of god and and the one that we are as a bride are looking for is the coming of the lord that's the main prophecy that we're waiting on as far as as our hope and our our our longing is to see him return back for us but it seems like in those these days as they go on and here we are year 2021 and seemingly going maybe into another year it seems like the life is getting harder it's getting strong harder to overcome it's getting harder every day of our life i mean we're hearing more and more of cali calamities and and problems around us but it's very important during these times that we don't get our eyes upon the calamities or the problems or the situations but we keep our eye on the promise and this is where abraham would patiently endure that in the time of calamity he still kept his eye on the promise during a good day he would keep his eye on the promise no matter how many years how many days how many times how how difficult the time may seem to have gotten for him amen he would keep his eye on the promise and we know that day finally came it was he would wait there's some 25 years for the promised son and here he receives his isaac and he receives the promise and you know and god does what's seemingly a very strange thing he he tells him to take him up to a mountain and offer him for a sacrifice but you know the abraham was so faithful that he never really brother branham said he never thought one moment about it matter of fact the scripture says he got up early the next morning he did he didn't early that morning he didn't even take days to think about it or ponder about it or or wonder how god's going to do all of this he knew if god gave him the promise god was able to keep the promise amen so he never refused to do it he just got up and as the lord spoke to him and he saddled up his mules and he took some wood and he chopped it and took off you know he gets to a place the scripture said he went about a three-day journey and he and he turns it to his servants he said i want you to wait here you know i really like this about abraham he said i want you to wait here with the mules i and my son will go yonder to worship and we shall return we shall return what was it abraham was turning his faith loose and i believe that there's ever a time in our lives as the time is right now that we begin to speak the promises of god we begin to speak what god has given us in this hour and we turn our faith loose how you turn your faithful is by speaking the word of god amen this is what abraham was doing he was speaking the promise the promise was isaac the promise was the promised son and he said we are going to return to this place you know brother branham said when you receive the holy spirit everything that you have need of and the earth the earthly journey is in you right that then he said but what it is you need to turn it loose and let it go to work let your faith loose let your faith loose in the promises of god and believe god no matter what the circumstances no matter what he asks you to do believe god no matter what day you ask you to walk through believe god no matter what situation you find yourself in you believe god amen no matter how difficult it may seem you believe god it's time that you let your faith loose in god's spirit and when you do that he said it let makes your body come into subjection to what god's redemptive blessings for you are did you catch that he said if you'll let your faith loose in god's spirit it'll bring your body into subjection to all the redemptive blessings that are for you and anything that jesus died for he's sitting there tonight to make the intercession for you amen that you can have it upon your confession and this is exactly what abraham was doing he was confessing me and the lads going but me and the lads returning even though god has said go on offer him he knew that god would provide a sacrifice oh come on now and so upon his confession he began to confess before it ever happened before he knew he didn't know how it was going to turn out he just knew god was faithful to the promise amen he said whatever you confess that he's done and believe it that's your personal property every believer every person that's born again i mean he's born again tonight has the right to any redemptive blessings he said when you get saved jesus takes a and hands you a checkbook and lasts you all through life's journey and his name is signed at the bottom of every one of them whatsoever you ask in my name it shall be done he said just just sign it let it turn it loose let it go send it to the bank of heaven and see if he won't bring it to pass abraham didn't know how it was going to be he didn't know how it was all going to work out but he knew he had the promise amen that's all that mattered do you under did you hear me the promise is all that matters it what it don't matter how he's going to bring it to pass because many times he'll bring it to pass way beyond what you was thinking or way different than how i was thinking amen all that matters is i have the promise how is he going to do it we don't know abraham didn't know you know he was told to go up there and sacrifice to kill him god said go up there and take his life you know what the bible says and it says in hebrews 11 and verse 17 it says by faith abraham when he was tried he offered up isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead he'd already received him as one from the dead because abraham's body was a dead i mean he had no seed sarah's body was dead her womb was dried up so he received the promise already one time as one from the dead so he knew if god done it before god will do it again abraham was already preaching in this moment jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the same god that gave me isaac the first time is the same one that can raise him up the second time accounting this word is something it's a really uh you know like i guess i get the the word accounting from as far as the as taking care of numbers this is a word that is not dealing with made with a maybe it's a reality it's not a it's it's it actually says it like this it says this word is not actually don't actually it means if you're accounting there's 25 in your bank account it's not close it's not plus or minus is 25 amen it's a reality there's 25 in there not 26 or 27 there's 25 dollars in there so abraham knew or accounted god is able to raise him up the reality is he's able to raise him up the reality is he's able to fulfill his promise no matter how difficult it is and it ain't going to be plus or minus is going to be what the promise said and he's going to bring it to pass you know some people in their bank accounts are good with plus or minus you know but if you get a real accountant he's not good with maybe it's 25 or maybe it's 25 000 or maybe it's 20 this or whatever he wants to know to the penny amen because he's a good accountant amen and so we're not looking at the promises as it may be as it might be if you're really accounting that god is able you're looking at that promise and saying it's 25 amen it's 25 cents and brother branham would say it he said if you have gave you a quarter it's not 26 cents or 27 cents it's the purchase price of bread amen it's it's a it's given an account a counting or a number exact number an exact figure and this is what the promises of god they are amen they are yay they are exact they have a perfect day to bring fulfillment it won't be on a day before or day after it will fulfill the time of its fulfillment no matter what man says or decrees no matter what the devil says or decrees it will fulfill amen so we we'd have to look at it not and you know in a general sense as maybe it's going to happen or or you know maybe i'll get healed or maybe i want my my children to come back or no he gave me those they're in my account come on somebody have you been taking account what's in your bank account well if i if i read what's in the account my children are then in the account oh hallelujah if i'm really looking at what's in my bank account if i have four children there's four children in my bank account there ain't two there's not three there's four hallelujah if i'm looking at my cow and there's healing in there if there's a baby in there if there's god in there i want all of it amen it's time we twin we're just getting closer getting a plus or minus we want all god said we want everything he said so if you mom and dad you need to look in your account it's already been paid for it's already been done my children's there my offspring's there god gave them to me and there ain't nothing the devil can do about it hallelujah if you're sick in the account and start accounting something and say he's a lord god that heals all my diseases you're coming to the press tonight look in the account there's a joy unspeakable and full of glory [Applause] is it not a close to or a maybe or it might be it's in the account the devils want to try to come and tell you it ain't there it's time you start looking in there and say yep it's right there romans 4 said said as it is written 417 i made thee a father many nations before whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and called those scenes which are not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations amen according to that which is spoken so shall thy seed be oh hallelujah so shall thy seed be amen he put what what happened god deposited a promised son in abraham's account amen the devil said it couldn't be and the devil said for 25 years it wasn't going to happen but god put it there [Applause] amen we're we're reaping the benefits of some accounts tonight brother but andrew and sister canada's now expecting their child what happened god put it there and there's more in there hallelujah amen i'm just going to say it right now i'm not getting weaker in faith i'm getting stronger in faith you say well what about your sister esther and brother jeff what about them they had it and they lost it what about that it's in the account it's in the even camp devil can scream the devil can have the devil can say it ain't so the devil can say it's going to never happen but it's in the cows amen and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb but he staggered not at the promises of god through unbelief but was strong in the faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded oh yeah that that's what happened you have to be all in amen you got to go everywhere every every every part you can't you can't go halfway you can't go part way you got to go all the way amen just go do a search on halfway i was looking at it hey man it's amazing what that were to bring up uh this don't really have nothing to do with i'm talking about but i thought it was interesting brother branham was talking was blasting about men that was wearing the britches halfway down their back side must have been a style back then too that blew my mind but you know halfway he said we don't we don't want he said you don't see a a drunk sober man you don't see a sinner saint amen there ain't ain't no halfway here if you want to obtain the promise you got to go all the way amen you can't just make it up to the mountain and say well i made it this far i got my wood i i got my just as we heard sunday got a justification got in my sanctification no it's got to go all the way to where you can lay yourself upon that altar and say god i'm dying out to everything that i ever thought everything that i ever wanted or desired it's not my will but thy will be done hey man that's fine and that's balancing the account amen but abraham said you wait here how's he going to do it i can't tell you i don't know how he's going to do it i just know he's going to do it but he's going to do it because he promised he would i don't know how he's going to move in an impossible situation but i've seen that he's done it before he'll do it again i don't know how he's going to end up all this and take a bribe without spot or without wrinkle but i know he will because it's in the account and he's faithful to it and he swore that he would amen god come to abraham he said i'm going to swear not by you abraham not by isaac not by these mountains i'm going to swear by there's nothing greater than myself i'm putting myself in the account [Applause] oh hallelujah when he put himself in your account that's an unlimited resource that's an unlimited under under this you can buy anything you want to buy that's in the bible you can cash it in what's in the bible you can have it i know we will this boy and i will return will you wait here we're going to worship so he put the word on on little isaac's back we know there's a type of christ packing his cross he got up to the top of the mountain you know and isaac got a little suspicious he he'd been to church before apparently he's like uh daddy there's wood there's a altar we got a fire where's the sacrifice listen to what came out of abraham's lips my son god will provide for himself a lamb he will provide a sacrifice amen god had been testing abraham because he had given him the promise when god makes a promise he wants to make sure that this person he give it to us worthy of the promise before he fulfills the promise amen so abraham had been promised that through his sea the whole world would be blessed and he'd have a son now the son amen if we bring forth a seed that would bless the whole earth and abraham when the promise was given to 75 years and here's why years old and his wife 65 years but the bible as we read said he's staggered not at the promises of god and god tested and god time after time tested him but he came to this final test before the blessing was going to happen now listen to what brother branham says about that he said that's the way it is with every seed of abraham god gives us the final test just before he gives the promise fulfills the promise that final test to see how you will react wow and when he gave abraham this test he found abraham just as true as he was when he started what a blessing it would be this morning if we could take his promise of healing and stand there just as true as we did when we stood and accepted it no matter what the doctor said the promise is true want you to understand the doctor ain't in his words it hasn't it it's not like you know the stock market and the stock market can hear about a they can hear about some of the silliest things sometimes or you can hear something go way up but the doctor's words does nothing to the value of the account it still has the same value it still produces the same thing amen the doctor's words do not diminish the value of your account amen is still there the devil cannot do anything to diminish the value of the account amen and when he did this when abraham did this he never withheld his only son but he's about to plunge the knife into his bosom here he had testified all over the earth as he'd go to different places i'm going to receive a son or abraham you're 75 you're 85 yeah i don't care i'm going to receive a son 95 i'm going to receive his son and now he's taking that testimony and laying him on an altar ain't going to take his life he was asked to brother and put it like this he was asked to double back and destroy the only hope he had for his testimony to be fulfilled but when god seen that he was loyal to that faith that he had in god god looked out of the heavens and he said i've swore by myself that i'll bless you and multiply you and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemy what was it because of his confession god will provide a sacrifice god will fulfill this i don't know how he's going to do it i just know he's going to do it he's also in the bible with rebecca it was a prophecy over rebecca and i thought that was very brother branham would actually take both of these scriptures and tie them together and rebecca you know what she was eliezer had went to the well and and we'd go through all that but to save time it comes down to the moment and it goes and asks their family and they said well you know we don't know when when she could go but ask her we don't know if she will go ask her was she gonna go with this stranger that brought some gifts and the camels and and all this we'll get that we'll get the damsel and let her speak we'll hear from her mouth where she'll go yes or no he said that's the way it's brought to all the seed of god it's got to be your mouth hello somebody it ain't just good enough for the preacher to preach it and and to say it it's got to come from your mouth what whose report will you believe amen are we going to are we going to just sit back and just say nothing or are we going to speak the word of god we're going to just look back and act like nothing's going on are we going to speak to what god wants to hear from you he wants to hear what you're going to say about it what you want to say about the situation what you're going to say about what you're going through did you get it he makes you go through things so he can hear what you are going to say about it he allows you to go through difficult situations so he can hear what you will say about it not what a preacher says about it or what somebody else said but what you will say about it this is why he let job go through what he went through he wanted to hear what job was going to say about it what did job say though god slayed me yet i'll trust him i know my redeemer lives amen though these skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh i'll see god amen he started confessing he started speaking the word of god right in the middle of the hardest trials listen it's easy to speak the promises of god when life is rosy it's easy to worship on a wednesday night when everything boy you had the best day best day ever you know and best week ever and everything's i doubt i don't know if anybody had that today but it's easy when things are going good and you got you know you got a good cushion in the bank account you got things rolling your way and you got you know but god wants to hear what you're going to say about it when there's nothing in the bank account when there's nothing that you can do anymore and you can't go in others you there's no decision you can even make he wants to know then what you're going to say about it he wants to know then what your worship is going to be amen i don't know what it does to you but when i see the devil doing things to god's people and to god's children and to myself to my family it makes me want to go harder he's pretty stupid i don't think he's figured that out yet because it makes me want to just push the sword a little bit deeper you know when i see him doing what he's been doing and and moving in in the body of christ and divisions and this that and the other it makes me want to go even harder study more find that inspiration go after it a little harder push a little harder don't stop this ain't the time to be you know kicking back and kicking our heels up and saying well we you know we're no have you ever seen a time such as this i was thinking about it today when i in my lifetime i don't know if i've ever heard of so much death so much calamity so many maybe it's because well we've had social media for a long time and i still ain't never heard of it like i've heard of it now but in these moments god wants to hear what you're going to say that's where abraham was brought to he's brought to this moment and he's leading his son his only son could you imagine what it was he still was a man he had feelings and thoughts and things that were going through his mind and he's wondering what's going to happen in his mind he's thinking he'd cast it down god's a provider god can move he's going what about his whisper over there what about your son he's going to he told you to kill him and where are you going to get the promise now what's going to happen now it's going to be you get them they're going to make fun of you they're going to but he's a provider he's jehovah jireh he's a provider he shall provide for himself a sacrifice and this is where he kept going until it would come out of his mouth and now it's come to rebecca and she's asked in the moment but brother brown said when she was put to the test she never hesitated a minute she didn't go back to her bedroom and think about it she said i will go and he said i like that he said not let me make up my mind let me study it over she was fully persuaded he said that's the people that god can use you want to be used of god be fully persuaded you want to be used of god be all in if you want to be used of god say i will go and are people then so anointed he says maybe they didn't know it but they put their hands on her and they began to prophesy over this little young jewish girl and they put it on a camel and center upon upon us unto a strange people but there was something on them as they said let thy seed possess the gate of their enemy and be thou a mother of thousands of millions thy seed shall possess the gate of its enemy that's god's sworn promise he said by that holy spirit seeing that mother was to be part of the son also because they're part of the same flesh then the holy spirit working through these people laid their hands on them and said let thy sea possess the gate of the enemy then god swear and he possessed again to the enemy what position does that put the church of the living god in tonight hallelujah she was typing the church of god here's a type of christ and here's a type of the church and the same word for the bridegroom it's the same word for the bride and just as he overcame and possessed the gates so shall the bride overcome and possess the gates of the enemy we are abraham's seed and we being dead in christ we are heirs with him under the same sworn promise we are abraham's seed and are heirs to every promise that was given him but when the testings come many times if we're not careful that's where we fail he said but i don't believe that the true seed of abraham will fail they'll stand just as gallant and loyal as abraham did oh hallelujah but what does the gates mean what was the gates representing you know i was looking into some of this and and you know most of the cities and large towns in that day were surrounded by walls of some kind uh they would either have some kind of stick fence or uh or to all the way to high stones that were made for the wall of defense the idea was to be able to protect the inhabitants at night from animals that might wander in and most of all to protect the city from from humans that are thieves or bandits and and conquering armies but this gate or gates however many was in that city were the only way in or out of that city so all the commercial traffic entered and exited through the gates and thus the city gate became a place of all kind of important activity in the life of the city and its inhabitants the area near the gate became a literal marketplace where commodities from the farmers that lived outside would bring them to the gates and you could read it in the scriptures and would bring it to the gates and they would sell them right there in the gate of the city increased commerce gave rise you know to dispute so you know they'd bring the courts and men elders of high renown and not necessarily the old but just respected men would sit there in that area and would bring the wisdom of their experience and insight and they would settle the disputes and even the king would sometimes come to the gates and sit there and decree laws and things so the gate was a very important place to the city and it was a center for even political activities or even you know mustering up an army to go and fight kings you know as i said would sit there and dispense judgment and take the political pulse of the people so it was showing that there's power right there in the gates and we know how the enemy amen would try to come and he tries to either wall people in or wall people away from something and so the gate in that city though was actually the weakest part you wouldn't you know if you tried to go against something you wouldn't necessarily go against the strong walls or or you know where they could shoot you down from you take a battering ram and you'd smash it against the gates and you try to because it had a the weakest link and you try to take that and so god was telling abraham your seed will possess the seed of the gate that would possess the gates of the enemy in other words they would possess the place of authority they would possess the place the place where rulership went from and and and things took place and so the enemy wants to come in he wants to wall you and he wants to blow you in or wall you out amen but you have been given position over that place therefore there's no way no way because you have the you have the ability or the rulership over the gate therefore you have the ability to go in or go out you have the ability the rulership amen to to do whatever you have need of because it's in your inheritance hallelujah so he's trying to maybe wall you out by while you're in by sin or while you in by fear but the gate has been tore down and it's not him at the gate anymore you have rulership over the gate and we know our bodies we go into all that has gates it comes that allows things to come in amen you know even just the sita smell and fear in here are filling here that's that's all gates but you've been given rulership by the holy spirit over those gates and there's others the other gates to the spirit and all of that and you've been given the rulership to dictate what takes place now we can look down to the bible and we can see amen many of many of the seed of abraham how they would take over the gate they would take over the rulership and we could we could see how moses went down and he would begin to take over rulership over egypt with just a rod he would actually take the authority over a great army he would take he would be able to sit in a place of rulership actually even though they may not have recognized him to be a ruler they may not thought him and to be a ruler but he was ruling over their their circumstances he was ruling over their fields he was ruling over their cities they made bringing fries and fleas and frogs and hell and rain amen god had given him position over the gate of authority hallelujah and you know brother brown would talk about how he'd even come down the red sea and god gave him the key amen the gate to go across into the into the toward the promised land because you there was a word that spoke of him you shall possess the gate of the enemy now that's not going to mean you're not going to have issues and things arise but you've been given rulership over the gate even brother branham talk about him possession possessing the gates of your enemy this is a wonderful quotation here he said he talks about how they went across the red sea and they get over into the wilderness he said just a few moments trials begin to come instead of keeping their eye on the promise see if they had done just like abraham done they'd have been the promised land many years before but they got their eyes off of it and when trials came and they they didn't judge him faithful i mean you know they and they lost the rulership of the gate intentions begin to come into the church you know brother brown said every or the bible says every son that cometh to god must be tried and proven and tested brother brown said he let sicknesses strike you he lets diseases come on you to test you to see what you're going to say about it to show the world that you truly are the seed of abraham he permits it by his own will he said he even allows tensions to come in a congregation just to see what you're going to say about it he permits it by his will he permits disasters he permits friends to turn against you he permits things he turns the devil is to tempt you he'll do it all but take your life he could throw you on the bed of affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he can almost do anything it's god's will for him to do it help help but we are taught that it's more precious than gold to us but he's wanted to see what you're going to say about it too many times we we hear something that's going on in the church and we just jump right in and we haven't even know we don't even know the sides of the story enough to even make a righteous judgment before we know it we don't jumped on the wrong side but god's allowing things to come just to see what you're going to do about it how are you going to react what's going to be your response sometimes you know you have to stand alone sometimes it brings you to a final moment and you're in the decision when everything everybody's moved away and you're standing alone you walk out there and say no you walk out there and you say don't god save me yet i'll trust him no matter what goes on around me i know he hasn't lost control no matter what's happening around me and the waves are crashing and things are going on i know he's still on the throne and though all hell is tell me i shall not be moved that's the seed of abraham that's the one that gave the promise no matter what the rest of them says what the rest of them do for me and my house we're going to serve god but the rest of them says there's nothing to the experience if the rest of them says it's a bunch of excitement for me in my house we're going to serve god he said i'd like to take up with paul right there and say in the way that it's called heresy so worship by the god of our fathers hallelujah oh hallelujah oh my i never forget going over i think i've told this but it's a it was a wonderful experience going over there into czech republic with brother danny steeman another brother took us into this cave beautiful beautiful cave of all kind of things the lag tights i don't remember all the names all kinds of stuff hanging from the ceiling growing up from the floor we walked to this one place and there's nothing but a dusty looking room black you see smoke look like black soot or something on the ceiling and the woman was talking in in her native language and brother asking what she was saying he kind of laughed and kind of smiled at me and she's saying that we're standing in the room where heretics had church i felt right at home that's like in the way it's called heresy so worship by the god of our fathers standing right in a place where men and women have running away from that catholic system so they can worship god amen and here we are again in the same places pressure on every hand situations on every side judas has walked away from us it's only just a moment that he's going to turn and bring back the soldiers judas has got to do what judas does they've already blasphemed the holy ghost there's no hope for him they want to send out judgments there's judgments that's coming upon them he said though there'd be tattlers coming to church those will be twisters all kind of false prophets everything that into the church among the people in the neighborhood and everything but for me and my house we're going to serve the lord though all of them quit coming though the church gets cold and different me and my house we're going to serve the lord though someone's prayed for and didn't get it well has nothing to do with it i want you to understand though my mama went into the grave after prayer after prayer has nothing to do with it as for me and my house we're going to serve the lord testings and trials come but it's for me and my house he said men are not infallible but god is you get your mind on a man he'll make a mistake maybe not willfully but he'll do it god sometimes permits him to do so to see if it'll shake your faith and to shake your faith away from man our faith is not in the wisdom of man but in the power of the resurrection of jesus christ that's where the true seed of abraham's rest their promise and the rest of their promise because they can only be the seed of abraham when they have received the holy ghost without the holy spirit you're not a seed of abraham he said well i'm in the message you're not in the seat of abraham unless you've got the holy ghost that's what makes you the seed otherwise there's just a bunch of intellectual knowledge and you'll out argue somebody's sitting on a bar stool and if it's a bunch of intellectual knowledge you how you'll decide that it's okay to have a glass of wine every once in a while you'll decide it's okay to wear certain kind of dresses because it's up here and not here but if it ever gets here that's what makes you a seed of abraham otherwise you're just the seed of the bonds woman make believe we can see many of them let's go on down get get get here pretty quick i'm running out of time but we know as we could watch all the ones the seeds of abraham shamgar possessed the gate i mean david possessed the gate daniel possessed the gate hebrew children all the highlights but i mean all the seeds of abraham possessed in the gate but what was it speaking of the royal seed to come and he would be born not of a man but he'd be born of a virgin with the power in his veins to conquer death and hell oh my god made a promise an ordinary man couldn't do it but if god makes a promise he's just the same god he was a few minutes ago when he was talking about abraham and jehovah jireh the lord shall provide a way to take the gate amen if there's a gate that needs to be conquered god will provide a way to take that gate moses died the rest of them die but god said he shall possess the gate of his enemy who's going to possess death he's got a way of doing things he shall possess the gate of his enemy and the royal sea was born he was tempted in every manner as we are just as we've been tempted so was he the devil quickly taken him over after he received the holy spirit and what did he do he didn't go to his power he went to it is written showing again the same word that worked with abraham works in this day what are you going to say about it it is written amen his death they drove nails in his hand they spit in his face went through every sickness but when he was on earth he proved he could conquer sickness and he conquered it conquered every gate of sickness he conquered leprosy he conquered fevers he conquered blindness he conquered deafness just name it he conquered it and he comes all the way he conquered sickness he conquered temptation when the enemy spit him in the face smote his jaw he turned his other side he jerked his beard and spit on he never riled back he conquered the gate of temptation he took it then you say my temper won't let me do it if you've got his spirit it's conquered when he's riled upon he riled not back when he's made a fun of he held his peace when he's called a devil he held his peace he had one business that's the father's business and he went about doing that and finally they took him to a cross death had to face him all the rest of them had conquered seas they'd conquered nature they'd conquered lines they'd conquered fire they'd conquered everything but death and here's one beaten in his brain his veins and had conquered had his blood that was beaten through there had the conquering power of death so they took his hands stretched him out nailed him to a cross they beat him they stripped him till his bones stare at him and when he did and they'd done all they could do death struck him said now i'll take you like i did joshua i'll take you like i did daniel i'll do all this because i'm going to make you die and he died to the son said he was dead nature said he was dead and it all testified he was dead and brother but then the devil sent his precious soul to the bottomless pits of hell and there the gates opened and when he come out on the third day he conquered the gate of death hell in the grave oh hallelujah and his seed shall possess the gate of the enemy conquered death conquered hell and on easter morning he conquered the grave and now we stand with him more than conquerors oh hallelujah and on the day of pentecost he sent down the holy ghost to continue through the gentiles to conquer gates and we don't have to conquer no more because it's already been conquered hallelujah sickness is already conquered death is already conquered temptation is already conquered all devils is already conquered hell is conquered the grave is conquered and we're standing at the gates and they're already conquered he said i want to get this picture for you when you look at the gate of sickness right in the middle of that gate stabbed in the ground it's an old rugged cross and it shows that gate is conquered hallelujah i want to let cancer know tonight as in middle of your day there's an old rugged cross that's been stabbed in the ground and the blood is running through it and the gate of cancer is conquered hallelujah amen in the gate of fear there's an old gergin cross that's been stabbed in the ground and it's showing that gate is conquered anxiety's gate is conquered depression's gate is conquered all devils are conquered oh my my my when you realize all the gates have been conquered you can take the city you can take what god has given you you can take every possession that god has placed in your life by the power of the holy spirit oh listen to this he said in the church of the living god this morning lays the power to heal all sickness amen maybe i need to read that again in the church of the living god lays the power to heal all sickness in the church of the living god there's the power to overcome all temptation in the possession of the church of the living god lays the power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the holy ghost in the church of jesus christ whatsoever you'd ask in my name it shall be given to you a little while the world not see me but you'll see me because i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world what power lays in the church of the living god well i say there's enough power to heal cancer to heal any kind of disease even including brain bleeds because i saw it happen [Applause] [Music] the works that i do shall you do also all these is in your account amen let's balance it out here tonight he shall possess the gate of his enemy no matter what gate it is if it's sickness temptation sin whatsoever gate the royal seed is already conquered and we're heirs he said aren't you happy about that to know we stand now more than a conqueror more than to conquer he says there's really nothing even to fight about the fight's over the whistle's been blowed the flags rose in the middle of every sin pile in the midst of every sick room is an old rugged cross planted by the blood of jesus christ the conqueror only thing we have to do is look and live and believe i will be with you i'll prove it people come in the last days said oh well that was then but i'll be with you and the very things that i do here on earth i'll be with just because they said it don't mean it took it out that didn't diminish the account the count's still there just because critics arise does not diminish what god done in this generation it's still there the very same things that i do shall you do also the same kind of works and today the church of the living god has the privilege of standing and seeing the conquered conquering resurrected jesus christ the son of the living god standing present living in his church doing the same thing he did again and we are possessing the gate of every enemy did you understand it didn't say you had to conquer every gate he said you will possess every gate if you've got an enemy this morning if you're a seat of abraham there's not enough devils in hell that can keep that gate before you it'll open i don't care what it is you walk up there as a promisee and said i claim this for mine this is mine because god swore that he raised it up jesus through jesus i conquered it and i came to come in the name of the conqueror jesus christ step back i'm passing through and he shall possess the gate of the enemy and stand up there with your shoulders back and your seal to shine and covered by the blood of the lord and the enemy will have to recognize that and move back amen we can read in matthew 16 and verse 16 simon peter answered and said thou art the christ here jesus brought him to a moment some they were saying well some says you're elias some says you're one of the prophets he said well that's okay but what do you say what are you going to say do you hear it what are you going to say how are you going to respond simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood is not revealed unto thee this unto thee but for my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art rev peter and upon this rock will i build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven what does this the revelation amen a personal revelation of who he is amen brother brown said you know the catholics thought that was peter so they built on peter he said it wasn't on peter it wasn't upon that upon that rock but the rock of revelation and in this revelation when you he said brother brown would pick it up in the church age book amen the importance of revelation by the spirit of a true believer can never be over emphasized revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize and this is where abraham was walking by revelation because god had given the promise and he was walking in the revelation of the [Music] promise this is where it was the gates of hell shall not prevail against it when god has personally revealed to you because as he said flesh and blood didn't give you this peter it's a personal revelation it's just like the the lineage of the priest in the in the under the law it was by birth they were priests but in this covenant is by revelation their priest so we're not we don't come by birth as far as humanly speaking you know as much as i want to i can't pass it down to my children they have to have their revelation sure i can teach them i can try to instruct them but they have to come to the moment this god is my god you remember that moment brother lemuel come out of that little room up there in oklahoma and said i want the hole to go well he said i want to be baptized i said well what are you going to be baptized for brother let me know he said i want the holy ghost i gotta have it i can't leave without it i want it and you could see the desperation in his heart and i said well brother let me know you don't have to be baptized to receive the holy ghost you can get the holy ghost and then be baptized and i said but what you want is that god not to be just your dad is god or your mama's god or the preacher's god you want that god to be your god laid hands on him and he became instantly drunk in the spirit for hours up into the morning as he begin to realize this god who's screaming out it's my god it became a personal revelation it became a personal revelation amen it's almost even almost in the realms of even becoming a minister it couldn't be handed to me from my father he might have wanted me to be a preacher he might have desired that for his son just like i would for my son but we can't do that it's not handed down generation to generation it's god-given and the holy ghost is god-given but it's a promise it's in the account they don't care what the devil says it doesn't matter if the devil says he ain't doing it no more it's still there revelation it's wonderful we know how he ends up as it brings down he says when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against her he said let it let me put a word here from my own ministry if you don't mind you all know this gift in my life is supernatural see it wasn't man given it was god-given it's a gift whereby the holy spirit is able to discern diseases and thoughts of men's heart and other hidden things that only god can know and then reveal to me he says i wish you could stand with me see the faces of people when satan know he's going to be exposed isn't that the people i'm talking about isn't that satan that's got a holding their lives through sin and indifference and diseases but you should see their faces satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most peculiar change comes over over the people's countenance i've seen those satan is afraid he knows that the spirit of god is about to let the people know of his works and he's about to lose power over the gate that is why he hates these meetings so much when names are caused and disease is revealed satan hates that what is it it's not mind reading is not telepathy nor is it witchcraft it's a revelation by the holy ghost that it can only what that's the only way i can know it of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the holy ghost but let me show you another reason why satan hates the book of revelation and jesus christ in the church he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today forever and he changes not he knows more a lot more than most 90 percent of theologians know he knows that since god is immutable in his nature he's also immutable in his ways thus satan knows assurely that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus claims is his own all else is false all else is false it has to be now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that antichrist spirit would come into the church defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempting the destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire he fights that do you blame him he fights that he can't stand it he knows let's talk about what the devil knows he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works mark 16 in action she will be an invincible army hallelujah she will be the possessor of the gates hey man there was an enemy one time thought they had a child of god locked inside of a city one time and he walked to the gate and realized it was locked but what happened he began to feel those locks that was down his hair he knew he was a man under a covenant he knew he was a man under a promise and the anointing began to fall upon that body little shrimp looking thing and he began to feel the power of god moving in him until he had such a surge he grabbed those gates and he picked them up and he put them on his back and he hauled him to the top of the hill oh hallelujah amen maybe the devil tonight has got some child him there but i asked that you would begin to realize i am a child under a covenant i am under the covenant of the same covenant abraham was under i'm under the same blessing abraham was under i'm under the same word abraham was under i'm under and when you'll feel that surge of the holy ghost you'll walk to that gate of pride you'll walk that gate of arrogance you'll walk to that gate of share and you'll pick it up and you'll throw it out of the way and say my god has conquered every game and i am now a possessor of the kingdom of god i'm a possessor of all things she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand that antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ was stood every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it for with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them let's stand to our feet what are you gonna say in your trial and in your test what's going to be your response abraham had plenty of time to walk away but he wouldn't have been the possessor he if he would have walked away he had to get to the point of having that knife in his hand before he could really fully see his jehovah jairo sometimes god will let you walk down to your last step for you to realize he's jehovah jireh he's more than enough any situation let's buy our heads why don't you look at your account tonight [Music] i ain't talking about the one at regions or cardinal federal whatever bank you bank at that has no eternal value look what's been given to you in the bank of heaven and you ask yourself am i living below my means am i living below my privileges as a son or daughter of god lord i want to cast some checks [Music] i know there's been a lot of faithful appearances even in this building that wrote out checks for their loved ones their children don't worry it's not going to bounce [Music] the promise is in the bible how he's going to bring it to pass i don't know that's not for me to figure out but what i do know he won't let one of his promises fall to the ground so brother timothy they're way out there they [Music] yeah he goes way out there he goes way out there where a man possessed by thousands of demons he went through a lot of rough seas to get to him it was a seed he went out to possess that gate don't matter where they're at how far they are how deep it seems that matters nothing to god what matters is what are you going to say [Music] what matters is how you're going to respond because he's more than able i've i've seen him come right in the middle of a room boys way out fall right in the room boy fall down by his bed give his heart to the lord now he's living for god years and years later got a family married to a preacher's daughter a few moments before that you thought there'd been no hope but it's never hopeless when there's god never hopeless don't lose faith if i can encourage you tonight in any way don't lose faith hold on it's going to be worth it the party we're going to have is going to be worth it hold on i'm looking to have a cancer-free party for too long i'm holding on because i know right in the middle of that gate is an old rugged cross been planted in blood running down it [Music] what do you have need of tonight why don't you just talk to him man it ain't all about the preacher praying over you you you speak you say lord i have need of this let him be your jehovah gyra well right now you just begin to lift your voice to him

right now he's moving when you don't even see you moving you don't even feel him moving he's moving [Music] say lord let that revelation strike my heart that this is possible that you got it in control that you've got it when there's nothing i can do about it you've got it when i can't change it you got it and i can't turn them around you got it oh hallelujah father you are the same tonight
