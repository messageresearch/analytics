each and every life we pray we commit this in your hands for your glory and for your honor in Jesus name Amen amen amen let's turn to James chapter 4 and verse 7 aim and it's always good to be in the house of the Lord and serve his people and no matter where you're at whether you're here you're in your home's tonight god bless you tonight a man and a man may the Lord just come and move in your lives for your situation James chapter 4 and verse 7 it says submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted mourn and weep let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up amen god bless you can be seated tonight just like to speak to you on this thought submit yourselves therefore to God just looking actually was sent this yesterday by brother Jason Jackson just how the blue sent me this quote and kind of sent me down this this thought path but brother Branham was saying the maniac of Gadara he'd say you can completely submit yourself to the Holy Ghost and no affliction can hold you and you can walk by the power of the Holy Ghost and you are well you give your testimony everything else healed by the power the Holy Ghost he said you that sinful that may drink smoke gamble do things like that you say I can't give them up brother branham yes you can you just submit yourself to God one time you just healed your whole self to him and watch what takes place that's the thing there's no secret to it there's no hocus pocus it's no magical formula it's submitting yourself to God and you man letting him take complete control then it's not you any longer it's the Lord that does it after that Amen and I'm bill I'm glad we have that opportunity today to be able to submit ourselves to the Lord him and I was looking at the scripture here on submit Amen submit yourself to the Lord therefore to God and resist the devil and he will flee from you the submit is to put yourself into subjection to to be subject to submit yourself into its control to yield Amen to obey to be a subject or in a military term it's also to arrange in a military fashion under the command of one leader amen and and and to and to give that leader complete responsibility and complete control and and and you know I believe that's what we're to do in this hour is to submit to him to give him everything you know I as a scripture says whose report will you believe in in other words what what report or what will you submit yourself to or select your felis image your feelings to you or your emotions to or you submit yourself to the doctor's report or will you submit yourself to the emotions or are the senses or who will we give authority or to who or to what will we give authority to let rule over us because we have the the ability to do that amen do we submit ourselves to what someone says or and go under that word of doubt or that word of unbelief or bitterness or do we submit ourselves to what God has said what God has said and what his word declares and and in some in the submitting of ourselves win doing that we are resisting the devil a man we're not allowing him to take control of our emotions lay on him to take control of our thoughts whether it be fear or doubt or anxieties or whatever it is we're not allowing him to how that control and submitting ourselves to him but we're believing the report of the Lord amen and so if we submit our to our thoughts of fear or we submit to our thoughts of anxiety then we're giving that permission to rule over us we're saying you are in control and therefore it has a right to stay there and it gets worse and worse and worse you know the doctor can say something and fear grip us and we submit to it and because our senses says it so are our motion says it so our ears or whatever says it so or we can just say I'm not going to stay I'm not going to stay with what the doctor says I'm going to stay in the arms of Jesus I'm going to allow him to take control because he is a tower of refuge he is there a man is a refuge and you know that but there's no refuge if you don't enter into the refuge you have to submit yourself when they was in the Old Testament they had when it was done something you don't want accident or whatever it was alive an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life and so they had Towe had cities of refuge set up but it wouldn't do no good to have those refuges even though they were there even though you could see them even though you may be in your view but you had to submit yourself to that refuge for that refuge to have rulership over you and therefore amen overrule what the others was trying to do to you and so you were even this even with God we have to come to him we have to take our our emotions we have to take our feelings we have to take our fear our anxiety and just say God I'm not big enough for this I'm not able to take this I'm going to submit myself to you and therefore in that you're resisting the devil and injuries system the devil he has to flee from you he meant so we realized that this refuge is big enough our God is great enough our God is strong enough and he's got it he's more than able he made he's a burden bear he's the Tower of refuge we can run to Jesus Christ you know if you you know and brother but I'm speaking about this and letting off the pressure he says this is a place if you will come and you will escape to Jesus Christ or you will submit yourself to him it is a place where you can come and just let off the steam amen just let off and just relax and and relax into the promise just allow it to take control you know too many times we submit ourselves to what somebody says or we submit ourselves to what a doctor says and we allow that to take control or precedence over what the word says but I mean I believe that this is the time in the hour that we have to say god I'm in the tower of refuge I'm not leaving the tower refuge and this tower refuge segment has government's it has the ability to overrule anything else amen this blood that we were under is a refuge and he has the ability to overrule any kind of sickness any kind of sorrow any kind of thing that goes on in our lives anything that we can't handle he can handle it hallelujah Amen so when you come to Christ into this place of refuge and when a man would come in the Old Testament he'd come he would come in his own free will free will he man he couldn't be made to go there he had to go in his own will and that's the way you had to come to Christ that's the way he meant to submit it's a submitting is to as a free will or heart to give of yourselves and it's not somebody made me do this you know I'm not living a Christian life because somebody's making me live a Christian life I'm living this because I've submitted myself to his rulership and his guidance and so here amen he says and so another thing you must be satisfied while you're there it isn't you can't hang around every day crying while I like to go out there I like to do this he said if you do that they'll put you out of the city he said you must be willing to walk willingly willfully wanting to stay it must said we must be that you want to stay in this city in this refuge a man when you come to Christ you can't look back to the world and say well the Bible says here you know what the Bible said well he that puts his hand to the plow amen and turns back is not worthy of the gospel he said there's so many called so-called Christians that have that they act like they're going to plough but the first thing something comes up and it blows him off the track and and they get sidelined he said but see when you're all pressured up and you don't know what's going to happening you don't know where it's going to go and and maybe maybe death is at the door Amen you know what you got to do you got to run into Christ you got to run into the refuge and then when you get into there you can settle it once and for all amen the pressure can come off of you so no matter what takes place Christ is our refuge amen he is our refuge in the time of storms he's in the refuge in the time of plagues he's in the refuge in the time of the things that were going through individually or as a church body or as a husband or as a wife or as a young person he is our refuge but we have to submit ourselves to him and say god I can't handle it I don't know what to do but you know and you can make a way where there seems to be no way you can turn it around in just a moment you can change it all in just a moment it only takes a just one not one little point of its finger and it's all changing man and so see saying things can happen though and pressures can come and things begin to build up I mean you know it begins to put on pressures in our lives or it's a little age of pressure that we live in Lord knows that a men especially even now seems like more and more and more and more and more but the name of the Lord is a strong tower and I want us to understand this tower it has no limit to its strength and I found this building that we're in or your home that you're in tonight it has a limit to strength there's a - how much it can take even as I limit to how much you know it's why people gets nervous in storms because you know him in your home is only has a certain amount a limit that he can take of winds or hail or or fire or whatever there's so much that he can take it's a refuge in a storm but your house is limited that just building here is limited he can only take so much but this tower that I'm talking about he can come against cancer and it'll hold it'll come against any kind of sickness hitting a cold it'll come against the doctor's report and it can hold he can come against anything there's no limit to the power catch you can get worse sugar diabetes can get worse the devil seem to be everywhere for this pie this tower is still a tower of refuge and there's no limit to its power it's just as powerful today as it ever was hallelujah hey man there's something no matter how much the devil puts against it he can put 200 miles an hour against there 100 he can and let me tell you something the devil on the other hand is limited hallelujah hey man he is limited there's so much he has so much resources he has so much depression he has so much fear he has so much cancer he has he only is limited in his power but this tower that we're talking about has no limits there's never been a storm yet that it didn't hold in there's never been a sickness yet that it didn't stand up against this tower has no limits hallelujah so we see here you said well you know well I wonder you said you don't wonder you just start letting off the pressure commit your case to God and go on as if it's all over with did you hear me hallelujah he said what'd you just say I wait I just wonder he said don't wonder you just let the pressure off and commit it to God and go on as if it's all over he said well I'm so worried I don't know let off the pressure what's worried gonna do you anyway it's a City of Refuge he took your worry so you don't have to worry so cast your cares on him for he cares for you don't worry about your cares that's his business hello somebody don't worry I wish I could hear they a man's tonight on the stream don't worry about your cares that's his business he said I met a woman sometimes ago in a 10-cent store she's about 60 years old and I said how you doing sister she said brother branham I've got two sons as doctors as older and you are and honest to goodness she didn't look over 30 years old I said she said here it is here's what it was when I come to Christ when I was 12 years old i sat down and thought about him I studied other religions but when I found the true one I came to him and he took my case he took my soul he took my sin he took my whole and I gave it all to him and she said I've never had a worry since well said no he promised me when I gave it to him he would take care of all my troubles and if he's not big enough to do it I know I'm not big enough amen so if he's not big enough what's the use of me worrying about it then in the first place say Christ promised you he would take care of all your cares so submit yourself to him he cares for you he knows what you're going through he knows your struggles he knows your trouble he knows the pressure that we're under he knows all about it amen so resist the devil by submitting to him and saying God you got this you can handle this when I can't handle it and he said when you do quit worrying about it you said well how'd I do it how'd I do all that brother branham just trust his promise hallelujah that's so simple sounds simple just trust his promise he made the promise and even in death or even when a death angel comes for brother Randall I know I'll be nervous oh no you're in a refuge you know you're gonna die you know you're gonna die you got to go some way so just in the ref you're safe as long as you're there he died for you he cares for you he knows all about it you mean when the Death Angels knocking at the door you don't have to get all steamed up about it well he said well wait a minute he said let's look back in these Israel down in Egypt when God said I'm going to send a Death Angel but you're going to put blood over the door what they do they submitted himself to the blood they submitted himself and in submitting himself there was a resistance to the devil that was on the outside what was that it was a blood that was there amen big black wings started coming through the neighborhoods and people were dying and screaming Amy every man but this little boy would ask his daddy daddy you love me sure I love you son daddy am I not your firstborn yes you are but look that that angel got that little boy I used to play with him but son you see on the doorposts yeah but what daddy was that angel give me he can't get you he can't get you because God gave us the promise and when I see the blood I'll pass over you just go back to your toys and start playing again there's no need of worrying we are in God's refuge hallelujah we are in a tower that's strong enough Laodicea can blow with all they wants to blue demons can have like they won't - I want the devil to know they say the house made of sticks and stones or or bricks or some wood big bad Wolf's gonna gonna blow it they say what is built out of it's built out of the very fibers of the blood of Jesus Christ and it showed at Calvary it'll hold it showed in death it'll hold it showed in every kind of situation it'll hold the devil ain't got enough hallelujah when I see the blood I'll pass over you some were screaming building up but Israel was relaxing under the promise hey man just resting in the promise when death comes at the door what do you do just rests in the promise doctor may say you're gonna die tomorrow what difference I made the bloods on the post hey man I got a resurrection if I die I got a resurrection coming just be calm he's in control he's governing every move hello somebody he's in control of everything I don't know so what he said in Isaiah at nine and six he said for under us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder he ment so he's taking our cares and he's putting them upon his shoulder what we have need of and listen it's more than just a stimulus check it's more than a temporary thing that's going to run out one day you know I have money one day and it's gone the next I most people spotted stimulus checks already gone was gone before they even got it but in the men there may be some may not be some more coming but of this government listen what he says here the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace Oh hallelujah and the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end hallelujah listen as we said Satan is limited in power and rulership his rulership can only go so far and for so long he's limited government and rulership has a start date and it has an end date but I God his rulership has no beginning therefore it has no beginning it has no where and if it has no beginning of nowhere it's limitless and power and of the increase there is no end so the devil puts out more sickness God's already got enough the devil puts out more exacting xiety and fear and builds up the pressure God's already got enough hallelujah and one day Satan is going to run out of his power but our God has no limits glory to God in the house hook and somebody say praise the Lord hey man maybe you can say it in your home just as loud as you can praise the Lord my government here in this earth may be limited and they have limited funds and they're way past their limitations the world has passed their limitations but this government there is no limits hallelujah amen this government has enough power in it to heal all cancer to heal every disease to heal ever sin to give us and cure this government has the answer for everything the devil can put at it hallelujah and garden got his chemistries he's chemists in heaven worried about him in the coronavirus and trying to come up with something he's had at 2000 years ago by His stripes I'm healed hallelujah amen it says here and I was here 22 and 22 it says the key of the house of David I'll lay upon his shoulder so hey many so he shall open and no one should shut and he shall shut and none shall open so he has the key to it and so when he clocks the door they ain't nothing that can open it and when he opens the door they ain't nothing that can shut it the devil can come with all his forces but if God's opened the door and there's nothing to be done about it we can see how it wasn't Noah's day when the door shut it wasn't shut by Noah he wasn't shut by man it was shut by God there by Noah couldn't open it he couldn't do nothing about it nobody had no power to open it it was all it was shut by God hey man and woman when God comes on the scene and he moves and he opens a door and he makes a way and he says a certain thing ain't nothing the devil can do about it come on somebody hallelujah they ain't nothing the devil can do it all he might how he might scream he might get all upset I'm sure he will but when God has open the door there's nothing to devil can do about it how many of you was witness when God opened the door and the devil tried to come and he tried to stop any trumpet it wasn't nothing he could do about it hallelujah and I saw an interest meeting the heaven the interest an open door Amen there's been an interest made for a bride to get out of here amen the devil was trying to push and push and keep this little bride down but then the door was not opened by him it was not opened by my mind just an angel it wasn't open by a prophet he was opened by God himself and God made the way out of here and gotta get us safely home and they ain't nothing a devil can do about it he can have he can scream he can say it ain't so he can send bad report after bad report at the bad report it does not matter our God opened the door did you hear me my god open the door and if God opened the dein of devil in hell they can shut it hallelujah he says here the spirit uses his Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church what the key of David signifies is the time at that time as a mere shadow which is being fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection not as earthly pilgrimage but what does the key signifies the answer lies in the position of the key it's the key is not in his hand it's not worn around his neck it's not placing another man or a verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of the key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has the right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where's the key it's on his shoulder hey man it's only shoulder what do the shoulder have to do about it back to Isaiah nine and six the government shall be upon his shoulder what is mean the answer is this the government is upon his shoulder it comes from a wedding ceremony of these when the bride has been committed to the groom or when she submits herself and she says I do and she takes her fell off and she places it on the groom's shoulder signified that not only she under his Dominion but she's transferred her rights to him and he is the head but also he bears a responsibility whoo hallelujah hi not only is the wife given Amen her so many s of us as the one submit yourself to the Lord but the Lord has said I'm going to take the responsibility of it hallelujah it ain't gonna be for you to try to go make my word come to pass I got the responsibility of doing that I'm gonna bring it to pass if I spoken I'm going to do it amen so see that and that beloved is the key of David God being sovereign he foreknew by the divine Creed exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he watched her in his own blood he paid for the price for her she belongs to him oh come on now you need to let the devil know who you belong to I belong to him I belong to Jesus amen and him alone she is wholly committed to him or has submitted herself to him and he accepts the obligation when a man was speaking he said in poverty and wealth and in sickness and in health a man taking a vow God also took the same vow when he took you as his wife he took you as his bride he has taken the obligation if you'll submit to me if you give of yourself to me I'll take care of that just let me have it let me take it this is what he's showing on his shoulder he's bearing your burdens he's bearing your obligations your problems your situation he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ as the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he's her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that sort of light he says but I have man heeded this truth no have they esteemed this person who alone has the full sovereignty authority over his church I say no for in every age the church have been governed by hierarchy of priesthood I passed Ollie Secession closing the door mercy and grace all sounded like what's happening in our day to closing the mercy of good Dork mercy and grace of whom it will and instead of assuming the love and responsibility of the church it has with mercenary lust prayed over her and destroy her the clucked clergy lived in luxury while the poor church fed on the husk of abuse and not one age did any different each bound to self an organization and he said that Darin wouldn't let people rise up they were brutally suppressed or cast out every denomination has the same spirit every denomination swears that it has the key to government of the church every denomination claims that it opens the door but that is not truth it is Jesus and Jesus alone he sets the members in the body he endowed them with their ministry he puts the gifts at her disposal he cares for her he guides her she is his sole property and he has no one else but her hallelujah you're the only one God cares about glory to God God cares for you he knows what you're going through let him take care of it cast your cares on him for he careth for you his government has no limitations hallelujah he can buy anybody out of the pawnshop hey man I'm a witness he can pay the highest price he did he gave his own life a man you know when that man wasn't willing to pay that pay the the Ransome for Ruth there was a mighty man of wealth his name was Boaz apparently he had enough money he had enough wealth to take on all her liabilities all of the things that she had all the things that was going on in her life all of her problems all of her struggles and take it on himself a little bride we also have a mighty man of wealth he's at he owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills he's able more than able for any situation any problem that's springing up right now anything that's going on in your life whether it be financial problems or health problems or our sicknesses or doctors reports or whatever the government is on his shoulder he is able to take care of it he is able to carry it he hasn't found any problem yet he couldn't carry or he couldn't answer or he couldn't take care of he's a mighty man of wealth hallelujah he's got enough to heal every disease he got enough to take care of every sin problem he's got enough to come and change every doctor's report he's got enough to move an impossible situation that's why we can call him the wave maker the miracle worker amen the promise keeper he hasn't run out of any money where he can't keep a promise he brings them all to pass there's not one of his promises gonna fall to the ground and not be fulfilled or be able to be deposited and something given back in return his promises will did what they said they will hallelujah you may have to worry about somebody's check and it be hot and they got enough funds in the bank but in this Bank there's enough promises in there to heal that relating person to give sight to ever bride personally amen to make the dumb speak there's promises right here and it will bring the past what it says it will submit yourself to the Lord and then resist the devil and he will flee from you hallelujah cast your cares on him if he have a care casts them on him for he cares for you the other amen he said this leads to eternal life he said a man man's maid so he would want a comforter he's wanting a comforter because he's made that way and that's the way God put him together built rooms in him his soul was conscious his sight his senses everything put together in this little room is something that makes him happy Oh hallelujah that gives him consolation he's talking about that inner chamber to take weary and nervousness from him God set in there the Holy Spirit that can make you happy in unhappy times and can make you certain and uncertain times that'll give you the wherewithal to hold the line amen that was a bet remember the jobber they're both just amazing jobs so fed my soul God meeting our expectations you bring the fish in the loaves he'll feed the five thousand five thousand didn't bankrupt him and all he had to work with was a few fish and loaves but he took care of five thousand mercy I mean he took care of the lepers he took care of the blind they took care of the halt he took care of all the sin and that sinful one's Mary Magdalene he took care of them and I never did see him running out of mercy and grace and healing power and deliverances he moved time after time after time after time now down through thousands of years in our generation over and over and over and over and over a time after time I ain't seen him run out yet hallelujah even somebody else check my run out but this one ain't going to bankrupt hallelujah brother Frank brother Brad will make a statement he said he'll bankrupt heaven before he lets one promise go in fulfilled well in other words Dayna problem is gonna be unfulfilled hallelujah so he put something in you to hold the line to expect things when it seems impossible there's been people that have reached into realms and believe things that were impossible why because they submitted themselves to what God said it ham would do that our father Abraham was a spiritual see Amen one of the very first examples of somebody who walked with God and because he heard a boy speak to him call him out and take him to a strange land and he started looking for a bit city that was a builder whose builder and maker was God and he started and he started believing in a promise that seemed impossible but what happened as he submitted himself and he allowed himself to relax and he allowed himself to just come into the world then the word started taking over hallelujah that's exactly what I'm you know when you get when you submit yourself to medicine its design medicine goes in your body it goes in and your body submits to it and it allows it to work in certain areas to do certain things to attack certain things even this is what the Word of God does when you take the Word of God of course it's more direct and more perfect it don't have side effects other than cleaning you up and watching you out and taking all the dope smoking and the beer drink and all that stuff out of you that's the side effects enjoy those kind of side effects I feel like it leaves me for the better amen you know and that's what it does it good but as you submit yourself the Holy Spirit begins to take control and begins to move in ways and you begin to expect things that seems unexpectable or unmanned possible amen it gives something in you to when all hell is against you to stand and to hold and to knock back up an inch but to keep pushing forward and to keep pressing a man what is it the Holy Ghost he said that I'll make you happy and I'll make you take all the weirdness and the nervousness from you God said in there the Holy Spirit a comforter Oh hallelujah a comforter to take control of you in situations amen he said you know my poor dejected friend he said if you're here don't know that is I'm a witnesses that's the truth he's some nerve I'm a nervous upset kind of person iris both sides are nervous drunks my mother half Indian but actually by birth make me a renegade that's right I'd be a terrible person a half-breed almost but I found something that took that little room in me and gave me a peace that passes all understanding and I come from death unto life and from darkness unto life and I can never deny what that has done for me hallelujah hey man you know he said he speaks of a over time when his brother Brennan mentioned it about being the one of the worst moments of Eva's life as his little Sharon Rose was dying and was taking her last breath and he was down there speaking to her and asking God to move and he's in God her mama lays yonder no more a bear in the morning don't take my baby let me raise her she's so sweet don't take her he says you know I'm just a missing the vision just shut off and in interior and I seem like he's I just take her anyhow and he said so what what happens Satan come to my side and he said usually you're gonna serve Him here you are out on the street corners you fasted so you was so weak you couldn't hardly do your job and climb a telephone pole and what have you done preached and cried and preached and prayed and one word from him would have changed the whole picture and would he do it no he wouldn't do it he let her die and he said see Mike my legs wouldn't hold me up no longer and I said Sheree you know daddy and here we zijn like knowing she was dying I thought just one word just one word I walked over to the back I didn't Satan come again said will you continue to serve Him and I thought we will where would I go if I didn't serve Him what would I do if I didn't serve Him where would my hope be if I didn't serve Him and something happened to me I walked over to the bed and I put my hands in their little head now he had an opportunity are you which one are you going to submit to who are you going to give into he said but something happened to me I said darlin God gave you and God took you away taking you away blessed be the name of the Lord though you slay me yet I'll trust you I'll take your daughter to lay it under your mother's arm they undertake it more an hour from now but yet if he kills me and theirs then I can go to he's the only hope I ever found he's the only foundation I ever had to stand on and he's the only comforter I ever had and where and how will I go for a comforter unless it was him and at that moment the angels came and packed her away but in that moment he was my comforter he came to me and he cared for me hallelujah the Brandon would speak many times about crisis what we do in the time of crisis he said if wheels just stand God you ask the question will God answer in a time of crisis he said he will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of crisis he will make himself manifest in the time of crisis we can see that all the way down through the Bible we can see how even you know Moses when he come to the Red Sea what was it in the time of crisis God came on the scene and opened up the way well you see Joshua as he would fight there in that valley I wrote through that valley that's at the setting of the son of my time in Israel took a picture of it seen it today my wife come and showed me the picture again as we rode through that valley same valley and robbed maybe at the same time just as the Sun was going down and snapped a picture of it and here Joshua was fighting the battle and he's in the time of crisis and and you don't you don't know what to do at the moment but it was in that moment something manifested and he spoke he spoke things that even now don't make sense humanly speaking it's the scientists would argue and this was that would argue and whatever people with my eyes a bunch of nonsense it don't make sense humanly speaking but God's speaking it makes sense when God speaks things happens and he might use the voice of a mortal man to speak say son stand still and moves hands still aim it wasn't it was in the time of crisis amen Joshua submitted himself to the thinking of God and God came on the scene and gave him victory over those kings hallelujah who are you want to submit yourself to are you going to submit yourself to the word are you going to keep going down that trail of fear and trail of anxiety and trail of all kind of things that going through your mind and your mind running rapid what are you going to say god I can't do nothing about it I'm just gonna submit to you this is what he was saying that quote I love - I love the quote he said if everyone in here would just begin to think think God is God what are you doing you're submitting yourself to something what one time you was thinking about this or thinking about that or this fear that's problem or mama here that daddy over here all kind of issues but all of a sudden you start submitting yourself to something else God is God and if God is God his word don't change he spoke it it don't change he said it it don't change it was him that said it not me come on somebody it was him that spoke it not me it was him that came in these rooms here not me it was him that moved in possible situation not me so if God said it he spoke it he will bring it to pass God is God and if God is God his word don't change he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's not lost one ounce of power or one ability to save or one mile a moment to change a life in a moment in a twinkling of an eye he's that kind of God he says no matter how religious you are how many churches belong to him any books your names on if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is the word manifested you'll see the message in the hour because as the Holy Ghost that does it and there has to be something like that something like that that often inspiration strike you he says if you pull water on the ground on the ground on the ground there's no seed there to strike how can I ever bring forth anything if there's nothing there to bring forth but that only the elect of God will see it the electorate of God seen it Noah's time Moses time Jesus time Apostles time Luther's time Wesley's time Pentecostal time because it was a seed that was on the earth that when this inspiration was poured out he meant what was that they came under they subjected themselves to it they submitted themselves to it and something began to take form in them something begin to take place in them just like the woman that was walking down there a little teenage girl walking down to the well and an angel came down and she began to speak Mary highly favorite of God amen what was it she began to submit her so maybe was just thinking about all kinds of things but all of a sudden her cheeks their thinking changed I believe my thinking would change to ulsan the blinding light came down and out of that ball of light stepped an angel about six foot and one six foot around their halogen dark eyes Amen with his arms folded hello somebody what would happen in your house is right in him all of a sudden the ball of light and out of a stepped a man your thinking would change you think it would change inspiration would take you to my feelings whoo yeah lots of feelings no doubt sparks I had never had to play privilege of seeing that ball of light but I felt him when he came by hair stand up on top of your head seemed like charged on every haver way this happened a few minutes ago right there study as you begin to sing that song he'll do it again things change its voracious strikes but it's usually and at these times of crisis when the press is on you listen to brother Brando when the press is on you look around look at the condition we're living in don't we not the modern Sodom and Gomorrah the world's come back to it again Gentile worlds was restored then didn't Jesus say in Luke 17 chapter as it was in the days of Sodom sort of being the coming of the Son of Man the Son of man and being revealed what has revealed the secrets made known revelation is to reveal to make known a secret these things has been here through all the church ages now being revealed he said you see God interpreted word God don't need anybody interpreters word he's his own interpreter he said a virgin shall conceive and she did he said let there be light and there was and here we are not in Luther's Wesley Pentecostal and we're all those agents were living in the evening time we're living in a time of the calling out of the bride he said just as it was hard for the Catholics to see Luther and Luther to see Wesley and Wesley see the Pentecost is hard for the Pentecostals to see this age it's always been that way because it's poured out upon the elected see a man is what the bible teaches they can't see it jesus even prayed for him said there was blind they didn't know it revelation says tells us this and Laodicean Church ages naked poor miserable blind don't even know it back again so creeped up in their tradition but remember the promised Word of God by the mouth of Jesus Christ the very God that spoke creation existence he was a Warren before the foundation of the world that said let there be and it was but he said he was in the world the world was made by him in the world knew him not but as many as didn't know him to them he gave power to become the sons of God the very creator the very creator himself that raised up lives from the dead he said think that's not strange for the earth coming when all that's in the grave will hear the voice of the son of man and shall come out again we're living in day it's the same God that said let there be light and it was the voice of the Son of Man would wait those in his grade and it's happening in his season he spoken let there be male and be female and it happened years hundreds of years before it happened an inspiration struck a prophet I said and said of virgin shall conceive unto us a child is born a son is given his name shall be called counselor Prince of Peace mighty God the everlasting father years passed months past years days weeks years hundreds of years eight hundred years later Emmanuel came forth borne by a virgin what was it he spoken it had to happen but it was in those real hours of real stress that's usually when the Spirit of God moves in oh hallelujah don't be looking at covet nineteen be looking for the Spirit of God don't be looking at government problems and this problem and financial problem be looking for the Spirit of God amen it's what happened he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace but who did they submit themselves to they submit themselves to God said King live forever whatever but we're not gonna bow we're not gonna do we're not gonna bow when I'm gonna worship our God can deliver us and even if he don't we're not going to bow he let the Hebrew children listen to this he let the Hebrew children walk right to the fiery furnace before he ever moved a hand but when he moves he moves allelujah when he moves he moves and they nothing to devil can do about it governments then couldn't stop him from coming they tried to build a fire enough to kill somebody but it couldn't stop the King of Kings from coming on the scene and changing the whole situation in just a moment the King bowed down and said hey then we throw three men in that fire is that yes can we throw three million in five but I see forward me and walking around unbound and then hurt and unharmed hallelujah the devil say hey I thought we had three of them in there but now there's four and everything we don't try to do hasn't harmed them and stopped them has empowered them hadn't destroyed them but they're still walking in the promises of God and they're being led by the chief captain and ain't nothing the devil can do about it I suppress ever onward we're not busy we're not bowing we're holding the line do what you got to do devil that God is greater do what you got to do devil our God has the answer our God is more than table for whatever you can throw at us our God is an awesome God when he moves he moves and all the devils have to tremble and free flee Moses and a crisis cried out and God said stand still and see the salvation of God and maybe our arch trouble tonight may you hear the words of God stand still submit yourself to God resist the devil and he will flee from you see God move the inspiration struck the prophet and their time of crisis an inspiration that's the way it strikes you if you're sick as the way it strikes you if you're afflicted something's revealed to you and when you see it revealed you speak up and you say I'm healed hallelujah all glory to God I remember what happened to sister Lily Petter solely in our service over the old church amen brother Tim was preaching on anointing to speak and here she was going to the kneading of surgery and having that problem in her in her back there and ending and she stood up right in front of me and my wife she said I'm healed in the name of Jesus Christ and God came on the scene all vegan some people just just just submit yourself to God and see what happens and when that inspiration strikes speak Amen you're saying and it'll happen come on somebody that's exactly what happened to Haddie right Amen if she got it on the influence of what the Prophet was speaking and he was telling her about the squirrels that was being created and all that taking place and she realized this is more than just some kind of fairy tale this is nothing but the truth don't you know those words whirled around in her frontal lobe who knows how long but all of a sudden she couldn't contain it no more and something come out of her and said brother Branham that's nothing but the truth he said what happened the age of the Lord fell in the place it said give her the desires of our whatever she asked hello he couldn't ask say that unless he could back it up whatever she asked so in other words whatever she was going to ask wasn't going to be too big you you understand what I'm saying she couldn't ask something big enough because he said whatever she asks come on now Oh God listen this government has no limitations this government is unlimited so he can say whatever you ask I'll give it to you this is why he would say ask anything in my name and I'll give it to you in other words he has the power for whatever you ask he has the ability for whatever you ask and he meant God come on the scene we know what she asks you could ask for the healing sister she could ask for money she was a poor lady but she asked for the salvation of her two boys and they fell over that you talk about uh greatest the greatest price but yet God was able to answer incredible what one soul was worth ten thousand worlds but God was still able to answer mercy we said Joshua an hour of crisis armies was being routed son was going down he knew if it went down they'd have a chance to unite again and come against him and he would lose more men so in the hour of crisis something had to be done if he could keep them running here to rout them every one though it wasn't like to do it so Joshua stood and raised his hands it said son stand still and moon hanging over a Jelani till I get through with this battle and the son stood when Joshua spoke of course it was a paradox seemed like something impossible to take place but God did it anyhow perhaps gospel never tried to figure it out how it's going to do how God was going to do it only thing he said was stand still same he said the same thing in mark 11:23 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you say hello he didn't put limitations on that you know I have yet to find in the Bible any kind of fine print as you find on contracts you know what I'm talking about just had one just the other day offer to me a needed a frigerator repair and Sears came out with a and Ian want to sell me a whole house plan of all my appliances and I asked her I said well what's the fine print she said well you just have to read that it's there and I said yeah I know about these warranties they all got their fine prints they'll pay too you need them to pay right yeah they'll pay yeah they pay pay until you need them to pay then they won't pay hey man but this we'll pay and pay and pay and he's paid for thousands of generations hundreds over and over and over and hasn't run out yet and I hadn't seen no fine print that says speak to this mountain whatever you say shall come to pass and he shall have whatsoever he says it don't say under there well fine print you know the real fast I can't talk that fast how they did but you know spit it all out so you can't understand all the things that they came they can't cover and they won't cover and they've another land he's go down this long no as I said he's the Lord God that heals all the diseases he covers all sins he hasn't found one yet he can't forgive he hasn't found one sickness yet he can't heal a man is unlimited submit yourself he says see he said see we can't you can't just stand there and fumble in your mind and say say it you got to be inspired to say it but when you're inspired say it speak it see what God to do see what God to do and move on your behalf so look at looking on down here seeing here Joshua in this moment didn't know exactly where to turn or how to turn maybe you'll find yourself that way tonight you don't you heard something to dr. sadder you got some situation going on and you don't know right now's the time to just submit yourself to God I realize he's he's got the answer to this humbled myself and he will lift you up he will lift you up higher than you could ever lift yourself up or any government can lift you up or any kind of thing could ever lift you up the ego he'll lift you up higher maybe you find yourself an impossible situation through Hebrew children all these others down to the Bible a little woman who touched the hem of His garment you know I was listening to that first service they played for youth camp bringing this down played for youth camp there by the Danish demons preaching on a certain woman if you didn't get a chance to listen to it go back and listen to it but that little woman made that moment her moment appropriated faith Jesus was on his way down to another place he'd been called to another to a death and here he come passing by and she said this is my moment she submitted herself to him I think that's what we have to do in the hours that were in the times that we're in don't submit yourself to the fear and anxiety and all the things the voices out there spirits traveling on those voices and things listen to the true voice listen to what the fathers say and listen to what he's speaking him when
