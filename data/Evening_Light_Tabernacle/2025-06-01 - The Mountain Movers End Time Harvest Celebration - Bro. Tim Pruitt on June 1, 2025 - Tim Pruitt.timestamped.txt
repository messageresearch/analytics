[10:11] need.
[10:14] [Music]
[10:32] I know.
[10:37] [Music]
[11:15] No
[11:16] wonder how alone
[11:23] And the emptiness I tried so hard
[11:29] to. Oh, I laughed and said my life was
[11:34] fine without
[11:36] you. I was covering up with secret
[11:41] tears. I cried.
[11:44] Then one day someone told me of your
[11:50] mercy and the love you showed on a hill
[11:54] called
[11:57] Calary where you
[12:00] died and purchased my
[12:04] redemption when you
[12:07] ro my spirit free.
[12:12] Oh, I'm
[12:15] amazed that you love
[12:18] me. I'm
[12:21] amazed how you
[12:25] came through your
[12:27] preious
[12:29] blood. I found
[12:32] pardon. And my
[12:34] sins are washed. They're all washed
[12:39] away.
[12:42] I
[12:43] wash
[12:46] away. Yes, it's
[12:48] true. There have been days when I failed
[12:53] you. Lord, you know the many times I've
[12:58] gone
[13:00] astray. But I've learned your love is
[13:04] stronger than my weakness.
[13:08] And your ear is open every time I
[13:14] pray. No one else has ever cared for
[13:19] me. Oh, like you, Lord. Other friends
[13:23] can never be as close to
[13:28] me. I'm not afraid to face the problems
[13:32] of tomorrow.
[13:36] Knowing you are
[13:39] everything I'll ever
[13:42] need. I'm
[13:45] amazed that you love
[13:48] [Music]
[13:50] me. Oh yes.
[13:54] [Music]
[13:59] Blood I
[14:02] have and my
[14:06] s they're all washed
[14:10] away. My sins are washed
[14:15] away. Oh
[14:22] yes.
[14:28] [Music]
[14:34] I found
[14:36] pardon and my sins
[14:41] are
[14:42] [Music]
[14:47] alled. Sing that second verse
[14:50] again. Yes, it's true. There have been
[14:54] days
[14:56] Oh, I felt you,
[15:00] Lord. Many times I've gone
[15:04] astray, but I learned your love is
[15:08] stronger. Oh, that my weakness and your
[15:13] ear is open. Every time I
[15:18] pray, no one else has ever cared for me.
[15:24] Oh yes, Lord.
[15:26] [Music]
[15:32] Oh, I'm not afraid to face the
[15:36] dram of
[15:39] tomorrow. Know you are everything.
[15:43] Oh, I
[15:45] need I'm a
[15:50] Oh, that you love me.
[15:55] Oh, just how much you
[15:59] care through your preious
[16:03] blood. I found hard
[16:05] pardoned. And my sins
[16:10] are all washed away.
[16:14] [Music]
[16:21] Where would I
[16:25] be? You only
[16:28] [Music]
[16:30] know. I'm glad you
[16:32] [Music]
[16:34] see through
[16:36] eyes of
[16:39] love. A hopeless case.
[16:45] an empty
[16:48] place. If not for grace, where would I
[16:53] be? Where would I
[16:57] be?
[16:59] Oh, you only
[17:01] know. I'm glad you
[17:06] see through
[17:08] eyes of love.
[17:11] A hopeless
[17:15] case, an empty
[17:19] place if not for
[17:23] grace. Amazing
[17:27] grace. Oh, how sweet the
[17:31] [Music]
[17:33] sound. Oh yes, Lord. Oh, but thank you,
[17:38] Lord, I found.
[17:41] A hopeless
[17:44] case, an empty
[17:48] place. Oh, I'm so thankful for your
[17:53] grace, precious
[17:56] Lord. Oh, take my
[18:01] hand.
[18:03] Lead me.

[18:13] case, an empty
[18:17] place, if not. Oh, amazing grace.

[21:36] Amen.
[21:37] This the grace of God to be able to
[21:39] recognize that you need him. A world

[21:44] that heading headlong into destruction.
[21:48] But amen. I'm so thankful that I can see
[21:51] I need him. need him in my life
[21:56] situations. I want to
[21:58] remember sister Elizabeth Buts is asking
[22:01] for prayer for lady she sits with about
[22:04] to cross over to remember her and other
[22:07] caregivers as well. Also, sister Dexter
[22:12] family is asking for prayer for a lady
[22:14] named Paula in hospital needs a touch
[22:18] from the
[22:19] Lord. Joshua
[22:22] is asking for prayer for need in their
[22:25] family having vehicle troubles. Remember
[22:29] them
[22:31] today also my
[22:34] wife great nephew sister Ruth's great
[22:38] nephew Jet passed away is 10 years old
[22:42] passed away after a long battle with
[22:44] cancer. Just want to remember the family
[22:47] in prayer that's no doubt a crushing
[22:50] loss to to grandparents and to parents
[22:54] alike and just ask the Lord to comfort
[22:57] them during this time. Amen. Just ask
[23:00] the Lord to come by and touch them.
[23:03] Amen. How many would have a need just
[23:04] want to make it known to the Lord. Also
[23:06] have Joe Adams and his family away today
[23:09] ministry. Remember them quite a bit of
[23:12] traveling going back and forth this
[23:14] summer. Different ones ministry as well.
[23:17] So ask the Lord to be with each one.
[23:20] Amen. To give them traveling mercies,
[23:23] good
[23:24] services, great vacations, whatever it
[23:26] is that the Lord would just bless each
[23:28] and every one of you. Ask brother Aaron
[23:30] if he'd come and pray for us
[23:37] today. Let's pray
[23:39] together. Our gracious heavenly father,
[23:42] Lord, Lord, we just love to take a
[23:44] moment and pause and just reflect, Lord,
[23:46] on your goodness, Lord. how wonderful
[23:49] that you've been to us and how kind and
[23:51] merciful, Lord. And in every aspect, and
[23:54] every situation of our life, we can look
[23:56] back over it and recognize you've been
[23:58] there with us through it all. And Lord,
[24:00] you've seen every step. Lord, you've
[24:02] seen every heartache. You've seen every
[24:03] triumph. Lord, you've been there through
[24:05] it all. And we just want to stop and say
[24:07] thank you so very much, Lord. Lord, we
[24:09] thank you for this opportunity this
[24:11] morning that you've given us, Lord, to
[24:13] gather with with believers of like
[24:15] precious faith, Lord, with with our
[24:17] church family and just come together and
[24:19] bring our licks of fire together and
[24:20] begin to lift up the name above all
[24:22] names. Begin to praise you, Lord,
[24:24] because you're worthy of that praise,
[24:26] Lord. We just hope today and pray, Lord,
[24:29] that our praise will please you, Lord,
[24:30] and that you'll begin to move in this
[24:32] place, Lord. Your word tells us that as
[24:34] the praises begin to go up, the
[24:35] blessings begin to fall down, Lord. And
[24:38] Lord, we're expecting to be blessed
[24:39] today in this place, Lord. We're
[24:41] expecting because when you move, Lord,
[24:43] and when you come down in a place, Lord,
[24:45] burdens are lifted and sickness is
[24:48] healed and the the bound are set free.
[24:50] So, we're under a great expectation for
[24:52] that today, Father. And we're inviting
[24:54] you to come and take complete control of
[24:56] this service, take complete control of
[24:58] our thinking and help us stay locked in
[25:00] on the word, Lord, that you have for us
[25:02] this morning. I pray that you'll anoint
[25:04] our pastor, Lord, to just deliver the
[25:06] word without fear or favor. And Lord,
[25:08] find that channel, not only him, but may
[25:11] we find that channel this morning, Lord,
[25:13] and and lock in and feed on the good
[25:15] things of God. I pray we'll allow that
[25:17] word to take effect in our life, Father,
[25:20] so it not just be something that would
[25:21] tickle our ears or something that would
[25:23] just be a good sermon, but may it be
[25:25] lifechanging, Father, as we apply
[25:27] everything we hear today to our lives,
[25:30] Lord. Lord, we thank you, Lord, that
[25:31] you're our healer. We thank you that
[25:33] you're our comforter. And Lord, we look
[25:35] to you today for comfort, Lord. Because
[25:37] Lord, in the loss of a loved one, Lord,
[25:39] especially a tragedy, Lord, like this,
[25:41] losing a a 10year-old child, Lord, only
[25:44] you can comfort, Lord. Words can't can't
[25:47] do it. I I I can't do it. But Lord, I
[25:49] believe right now you can draw close and
[25:51] and and Lord, begin to wrap your arms
[25:53] around people, Lord, and and use it as
[25:55] an opportunity, Lord, to draw family and
[25:58] draw different ones closer to you,
[26:00] Father. I pray that you will somehow in
[26:02] this situation move for your glory,
[26:04] Lord. Lord, we commit that family and
[26:07] that situation to you. And Lord, the
[26:08] different needs of the lady in the
[26:10] hospital. I pray that Lord, you'll move
[26:12] on her situation, Lord, once again for
[26:14] your glory. And and and Sister Liz, ask
[26:17] for for this lady that's about to cross
[26:19] over. Lord, I just pray that you'll move
[26:21] right there and and allow that to be a
[26:23] an easy transition, Lord, and be with
[26:25] that family. Once again, bring comfort.
[26:28] Lord, you know every need. Lord, you
[26:30] know every situation, Lord, as we stand
[26:32] here today, Lord. Not only did you see,
[26:34] but you provided, Lord, and we've
[26:36] assembled today, Lord, and we're and
[26:38] we're looking for the answer for our
[26:40] need. We're expecting you to move in our
[26:41] life, Lord. And Lord, only you can come
[26:44] to a place like this and take a message
[26:46] and divide it just so so it speaks to
[26:48] every single person that's sitting here,
[26:51] Lord. I just pray you'll have your way.
[26:53] I pray you'll heal today and deliver,
[26:55] Lord, and rekindle fires that have
[26:57] burned low, Father, because truly we
[26:59] know that we're at the end of time,
[27:01] Lord. Your prophet told us that this
[27:03] bride would not be lukewarm, Lord. So, I
[27:06] just pray today that the fire in every
[27:07] heart be rekindled, Lord. May it just be
[27:10] a blaze today. May this whole place be a
[27:12] blaze, Lord, as our licks of fire, Lord,
[27:15] just come together and burn brighter
[27:16] than ever, Lord. May you just burn out
[27:18] all the draws and speak to each one of
[27:20] us and allow us, Lord God, to be lifted
[27:22] into heavenly places. Lord, we commit
[27:25] every need and every situation into your
[27:27] hands now, Father, in Jesus name we
[27:29] pray.
[27:38] Amen. I want you to turn around, welcome
[27:41] each other to the house of the
[27:43] Lord. Amen. Just you have a visitor next
[27:46] to you, please make them

[45:08] Is he God alone this morning or is he
[45:10] not God alone? Is he still on the throne
[45:12] or is he still or is he not on the
[45:14] throne this morning? Is he a healer and
[45:17] deliverer? Is he not a healer and
[45:18] deliverer? Is he your God? Is he your
[45:22] only God? Is he God alone for you?
[45:29] That song does something to me cuz I
[45:32] don't know. I get in some bad times but
[45:33] he's still God.
[45:36] Hallelujah. He's not just God in the
[45:38] good times. He's not just God when he's
[45:40] on the mountain top or where we're on
[45:42] the mountaintop. When we got everything
[45:44] going our way, all the bills are paid
[45:46] and the health is good and kids are
[45:48] doing it. He's still God. It doesn't
[45:50] matter what situation you're in this
[45:52] morning. Come on, somebody. We serve
[45:56] that kind of God. That's still God.

[46:01] you're rich, whether you're having a
[46:02] good time, whether you're having a bad
[46:04] time, whether you're in the valley or
[46:06] you're on the mountain, he's still God.
[46:09] Whether it looks like all is well or
[46:11] it's not all well, he's still God. Is he
[46:15] your God this morning? Is he your God
[46:18] this morning? Hallelujah. Is he your God
[46:20] this morning? Hallelujah. Well, let's
[46:21] stand to our feet this morning as we
[46:23] welcome the word, amen, into our midst
[46:26] and say, Lord, you're
[46:27] unchangeable. You're unshakable. I might
[46:30] be shaken, but you're
[46:32] unshaken. I might change, but you're
[46:34] unchangeable. The world around me might
[46:37] change, but my God doesn't
[46:39] change. Oh, it gives me comfort this
[46:41] morning to know that. Gives me comfort
[46:43] to know that no matter what I'm going
[46:45] through, he doesn't change his mind
[46:47] about me. Hallelujah. He's God
[46:52] alone. I said he's God alone. Let cancer
[46:56] know our God is God
[46:59] alone. Let depression know my God is God
[47:02] alone.
[47:04] He's unchangeable. He hadn't changed his
[47:07] mind about me. He ain't changed his mind
[47:09] about you. He loved you all before. He
[47:11] still loves you today.
[47:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many is
[47:15] ready for the word this morning? Let God
[47:18] come by my way and speak to my heart.
[47:20] Change my heart. Oh God, I I need some
[47:23] change. I need my attitude changed. I
[47:25] need something change. Whatever it is, I
[47:27] want to be changed. But God, I'm so
[47:29] thankful. You never
[47:31] [Music]
[47:36] change.
[47:37] Hallelujah. Oh, you are God
[47:41] alone before time.
[47:46] You are.
[47:48] Yes, Jesus. You are God. Oh, and right
[47:52] now. And right now, in the good time or
[47:56] the bad time,
[47:58] oh, you are on your
[48:01] throne. And you are God. Oh,
[48:06] unchangeable,
[48:09] unchangeable,
[48:12] unchangeable, unstoppable.
[48:14] [Music]

[48:25] unshapable.
[48:28] Unstoppable. That's what you
[48:31] are. And you are God alone.

[48:56] you are God alone cuz you're my God.
[49:00] Amen. Can you declare that this morning?
[49:03] He's my God. He's my Lord. There is no
[49:06] other. Amen. Today I give myself a new
[49:10] to him.
[49:12] Today I'll offer up a sacrifice of
[49:14] praise. I'll love him from the depths of
[49:17] my heart. I'll worship him because
[49:20] there's no other one worthy. Amen. Lord,
[49:24] we love you
[49:25] today. We thank you today. We welcome
[49:29] you, oh God. We are asking that you'd
[49:32] minister to our hearts, Lord, today as
[49:35] as we minister back to you, oh God, as
[49:40] we give up us an
[49:43] offering, a sweet smelling offering, an
[49:47] offering of praise, of adoration, of
[49:50] thanksgiving because you are worthy,
[49:53] because you are our God and there is no
[49:56] other. We ask Lord your blessings upon
[49:59] your people today. Those that are in
[50:01] need, those have situations of God in
[50:04] their lives. Lord, a late minute prayer
[50:07] request coming in for one saying, "We
[50:09] got car trouble and and then in a
[50:11] desperate situation, will you just help
[50:13] them, Father? You care. You care even
[50:17] about small things. You care about the
[50:19] big things. You just care about men. For
[50:23] your eye is on this pharaoh. And I know
[50:25] you watch us, Lord. I ask now that
[50:28] you'll minister to hearts today, as we
[50:31] come to this communion service, as we
[50:33] come to this time of fellowship with
[50:36] you, of renewing our vows, of of having
[50:40] a re spiritual renewing. I pray Lord
[50:43] that you'll speak, Lord, that you'll
[50:46] open up the hearts and lives of men and
[50:48] women today and place your word within
[50:50] it. And Lord, let your life flow then
[50:54] through them.
[50:55] Oh God, we ask in Jesus name. Now Lord,
[50:59] as we approach your word, we've we have
[51:02] done this with sincerity. We have we've
[51:05] made preparations for this moment. Lord,
[51:08] we spent hours here just looking into
[51:11] the word, seeing the prophetical word
[51:13] for our hour and what you're doing for
[51:16] us today. I pray Lord that now as we
[51:21] step into the
[51:22] anointing Lord believe that we were
[51:24] anointed when we when we studied and we
[51:28] sought out the word and for the in the
[51:31] mind of God but now Lord this is
[51:33] different. We step into an
[51:36] anointing, Lord, not of study anymore,
[51:38] but where the word now will go forth in
[51:41] power. And I ask that you will anoint it
[51:44] today. And that you'll anoint the hearts
[51:46] of your children to receive and the
[51:49] speaker to speak. Lord, only your word.
[51:52] Hide us behind the cross. And we say
[51:54] nothing that would be wrong, Lord.
[51:56] Nothing that the that we'd have to go
[51:58] back and correct and make right. that
[52:01] Lord that we would have spoke the mind
[52:03] of God. We're asking it in Jesus name.
[52:06] Bless your children today in your
[52:08] presence in Jesus name. Amen. And amen.
[52:13] How many loves the Lord today.
[52:16] Amen. What a wonderful savior that we

[52:49] him for God's glory. I know he will.
[52:52] Amen. and you'll be blessed. Amen. Amen.
[52:56] Let's sing the song. It's Jesus on the
[52:59] inside working on the outside. What a
[53:02] change in my life. How many's glad for
[53:04] that change? Well, it's Jesus on the
[53:08] inside working on the outside. Oh, what
[53:12] a change in my
[53:15] life. It's Jesus on the inside, working
[53:20] on the outside. Oh, what a change in my
[53:26] life with Jesus on the inside working on
[53:31] the outside. Oh, what a change in my
[53:37] life. And
[53:39] oh, what a
[53:42] change is in my life. One more time now.
[53:48] Well, there Jesus on the inside working
[53:52] on the outside. Oh, what a change in my
[53:58] life. It's Jesus on the inside working
[54:03] on the outside. Oh, what a change in my

[54:40] been changed in his presence. Amen. And
[54:44] if you have been changed, well, I don't
[54:46] think God leaves us there, but he will
[54:49] change us from glory unto glory. Amen.
[54:53] So, just expect him to change you until
[54:56] that sudden change when you receive that
[54:58] sweep that goes over you and you're
[55:00] changed in a moment, in a twinkling of
[55:03] an eye. Amen. Let's turn to Leviticus
[55:06] chapter 23, verse 15 for our scripture
[55:10] reading this morning. And we're going to
[55:12] keep with our theme there. Who art thou
[55:14] great mountain? Thou shalt become a
[55:16] plain and the headstone because we are
[55:19] coming to a harvest season which is the
[55:21] head of all harvest seasons shall bring
[55:25] forth with shoutings said crying grace
[55:28] grace unto it. Now Leviticus
[55:31] 23:15, "And ye shall count unto you from
[55:34] the tomorrow after the Sabbath, from the
[55:37] day that you brought forth brought the
[55:39] sheath of the wave offering, seven
[55:41] Sabbaths shall be complete. Even the
[55:45] tomorrow after the seventh Sabbath shall
[55:47] ye number 50 days, and ye shall offer a
[55:51] new meat offering unto the Lord. And ye
[55:55] shall bring out of your habitations two
[55:58] wave loaves of two tenth deals. They
[56:02] shall be of fine flour, and they shall
[56:05] be bacon with leaven. They are the first
[56:08] fruits unto the Lord. And you shall
[56:11] offer with the bread seven lambs without
[56:14] blemish of the first year, and one young
[56:18] bulock and two rams, and they shall be
[56:21] for a burnt offering unto the Lord with
[56:25] their meat offering, and their drink
[56:28] offerings, even an offering made by fire
[56:32] of a sweet savor unto the Lord. Now turn
[56:36] with me to Luke chapter 13 and we'll
[56:39] read a New Testament scripture. Um and
[56:42] this is where Jesus is giving parables.
[56:46] And remember in these parables are they
[56:49] they are prophetical. They are uh things
[56:52] that he is showing that would be in the
[56:56] in the future kingdom to come. And we're
[56:58] not talking about something future now
[57:00] because the kingdom has come which is
[57:03] the Holy Ghost. Amen. for the you know
[57:06] that that um you know it's again it's
[57:10] not the kingdom of God is not meat and
[57:12] drink but it's righteousness peace and
[57:15] joy in the Holy Ghost. So the kingdom is
[57:18] the Holy Ghost. And again he said where
[57:21] unto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
[57:24] So he said what shall I compare the
[57:27] kingdom of God with? And he said, "It is
[57:30] like leavenan which a woman took and hid
[57:34] in three measures of meal till the whole
[57:38] was leaven." Amen. God bless you. Can be
[57:42] seated. And if you want to, you can turn
[57:45] with me to Matthew chapter 13 and we'll
[57:47] read from verse 36. I'm just going to
[57:49] read a couple of scriptures here that we
[57:51] will be referring to so that you will
[57:54] have them uh here. I want these to be in
[57:57] the forefront of your thought as we
[58:00] minister today on this. And um Jesus
[58:04] told us that to that the end time would
[58:07] be a harvest of what was planted at
[58:10] Pentecost. Now, you may not realize it,
[58:12] but when he was counting the 50 days
[58:15] from the waving of the sheath after the
[58:19] Passover uh and and counting the 50
[58:22] days, that conclusion of 50 days was
[58:26] Pentecost. Pentecost simply means 50. So
[58:30] again, you know what was planted at
[58:32] Pentecost? We're coming now to the
[58:34] harvest season of that. We have come
[58:37] since the Passover, since Jesus was our
[58:40] Passover lamb 2,000 years ago, we have
[58:44] come through seven church ages. And so
[58:47] we are now, you know, at another harvest
[58:51] cycle or shall we say another Pentecost.
[58:55] This is the day that we're in. This is
[58:57] the hour when all types now are being
[59:00] fulfilled. So, Matthew
[59:03] 13:36, then Jesus sent the multitude
[59:06] away, and went into the house. And his
[59:08] disciples came unto him, said this,
[59:10] saying, Declare unto us the parable of
[59:13] the tears of the field. And he answered
[59:15] and said unto them, he that sweth the
[59:17] good seed is the Son of Man. The field
[59:21] is the world, the good seed are the
[59:23] children of the kingdom, but the tears
[59:25] of the children of the wicked one. So,
[59:27] two crops coming forth. The enemy that
[59:30] sowed demise the devil. The harvest is
[59:32] the end of the world which we are
[59:34] standing at now. And the reapers are the
[59:37] angels. And as therefore the tears are
[59:41] gathered and burned in the fire, so
[59:43] shall it be in the end of this world.
[59:47] Then we'll go to the book of Revelation.
[59:49] I love this scripture here. Verse 14.
[59:52] Chapter 14 verse1 14. And I looked, and
[59:55] behold, a white cloud, and upon the
[59:59] clouds one sat like the Son of Man,
[1:00:02] having on his head a golden crown, and
[1:00:06] in his hand a sharp sickle. And another
[1:00:09] angel came out of the temple, crying
[1:00:11] with a loud voice to him that sat on the
[1:00:14] cloud, "Thrust in thy sickle, and reap,
[1:00:18] for the time is come for thee to reap,
[1:00:21] for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
[1:00:24] And he that sat on the cloud thrust in
[1:00:26] his sickle on the earth, and the earth
[1:00:30] was reaped. Now, so we are living in the
[1:00:34] hour where the harvest is right now and
[1:00:38] the process that brings the final crop
[1:00:40] to the harvest began as we said seven
[1:00:43] church ages ago. It is not a sudden work
[1:00:46] but it's a divine process that was set
[1:00:49] in motion by the son of man himself
[1:00:52] which is Jesus Christ. Now in his
[1:00:55] parable of the swer, Jesus the son of
[1:00:58] man revealed that he is the ser. He is
[1:01:02] casting the incorruptible seed of the
[1:01:05] word of God into the field um which is
[1:01:08] the world and that seed he said is the
[1:01:12] children of the kingdom. No. So you see
[1:01:14] it's the word being sowed but yet it's
[1:01:17] the children of the kingdom sons and
[1:01:20] daughters of God who are part of him
[1:01:22] part of the word and predestinated
[1:01:25] before the foundation of the world who
[1:01:27] come to full maturity in him in this
[1:01:31] last days. But if you notice, while men
[1:01:34] slept, the the enemy came and Satan was
[1:01:37] sewing his own seed into the field. And
[1:01:42] the tears, Jesus said, are the children
[1:01:44] of the wicked one. The weed and the
[1:01:46] tears would grow together throughout the
[1:01:49] ages. But a time of separation would
[1:01:52] come, and that time is now. It is the
[1:01:55] time of harvest. And to understand this
[1:01:58] clearly, we we must see God's harvest
[1:02:02] cycle. Now, in ancient Israel, the the
[1:02:06] harvest calendar wasn't just
[1:02:08] agriculture. It was prophetic. God was
[1:02:10] actually prophesying things as as he
[1:02:14] would, you know, set these feasts. And
[1:02:16] he would command Israel to gather at
[1:02:19] Jerusalem for three major feasts. And
[1:02:23] each aligned with a a distinct harvest
[1:02:25] crop. And each was revealing his eternal
[1:02:29] plan. And these feasts were more than a
[1:02:31] festival. They were a prophecy of future
[1:02:35] events. Now, I want you to get used to
[1:02:38] looking at the word of God as
[1:02:40] prophetical, as being fulfilled in this
[1:02:43] hour rather than just, oh, it was just a
[1:02:46] tradition that was passed on to the
[1:02:48] Israelites many, many years ago, and
[1:02:51] this is what they did, and and this was
[1:02:54] about them. No, this is about you. It is
[1:02:57] about the end time process, and God will
[1:03:00] use this to foreshadow things that will
[1:03:03] happen in the last days. Now first of
[1:03:06] all that there would be the barley
[1:03:08] harvest and that would there would be
[1:03:10] the first fruits that would be brought
[1:03:12] forth and the first the first feast then
[1:03:15] was Passover and with it came the barley
[1:03:19] harvest. It was the earliest crop and
[1:03:22] this harvest represents the Old
[1:03:24] Testament church. The saints who looked
[1:03:28] forward to the coming of the Messiah
[1:03:31] Jesus Christ. He was the head of the
[1:03:33] body. He himself was the first fruits of
[1:03:37] the resurrection. And as a wave sheep
[1:03:39] offering was lifted on that morning
[1:03:43] after the Sabbath, resurrection morning,
[1:03:46] Jesus himself as the first sheep, the
[1:03:49] first fruit of the barley harvest, rose
[1:03:52] from the dead, and he was way before
[1:03:55] heaven and declaring because that I
[1:03:58] live, you shall live also. and the Old
[1:04:02] Testament uh saints rose with him and
[1:04:05] the first harvest was gathered in. So we
[1:04:09] can look in Matthew chapter 52 and 50 27
[1:04:13] verse 52 and three and the graves were
[1:04:16] open and many of the bodies of the
[1:04:19] saints which slept arose and came out of
[1:04:22] the grave after his resurrection and
[1:04:25] went into the holy city and appeared
[1:04:28] unto many. Now, what you get to picture?
[1:04:31] One resurrection and rapture has already
[1:04:34] passed. One harvest has already been
[1:04:37] done. The barley harvest has been
[1:04:39] completed 2,000 years ago, but God has
[1:04:44] something else in mind. And that was a
[1:04:46] gentile bride for his name's sake. Amen.
[1:04:49] And so as the priests that morning, that
[1:04:52] resurrection morning, the the the
[1:04:55] Israelite priests, the Jewish priests
[1:04:58] going to the temple in Jerusalem, as
[1:05:00] they went through the tradition of
[1:05:04] waving the sheep before the Lord, God
[1:05:07] waved his son, the resurrected Christ,
[1:05:10] the first fruit of the harvest, and
[1:05:13] declaring the rest of the crop, the
[1:05:16] souls of his redeemed would surely
[1:05:18] follow. Amen. Now, as I said, that
[1:05:21] harvest is passed. The Old Testament
[1:05:24] saints have been resurrected and
[1:05:26] glorified, thus raptured together with
[1:05:29] Jesus. I tell you, if he could do it
[1:05:32] once, he can do it again. That's one
[1:05:35] thing we have to look back and see. If
[1:05:37] God would resurrect the Old Testament
[1:05:39] saints at the end of their harvest
[1:05:41] season, then God's certainly going to
[1:05:43] have a resurrection here at this end of
[1:05:45] the harvest season. If he lifted up and
[1:05:48] raptured a people, amen, 2,000 years
[1:05:51] ago, he'll do the same again. And as he
[1:05:54] finishes up the harvest of the world,
[1:05:58] we're living in that time, friends. Now,
[1:06:01] you see, these things were shadows in
[1:06:03] the scripture. They were foretelling
[1:06:07] something that was going to come, and
[1:06:09] approaching an approaching reality, the
[1:06:13] positive that would come. And and so God
[1:06:16] spoke to Moses in Leviticus 23 that we
[1:06:19] read and gave him the instructions for
[1:06:23] the feast of weeks, Pentecost. It was,
[1:06:26] as I said, a prophetic shadow to come.
[1:06:30] Um you see these feasts marked the wheat
[1:06:34] harvest. Now we go to a different crop.
[1:06:37] We have a distinct crop, the barley. Now
[1:06:40] comes the wheat. And this one points to
[1:06:43] the New Testament church. Now it began
[1:06:47] with 120 in the upper room, but it is
[1:06:50] now ripened through the ages. Seven
[1:06:54] church ages, seven weeks of sewing and
[1:06:56] growing until now. You see, the feast of
[1:07:01] Pentecost, it it really paints a a
[1:07:04] powerful picture of God's divine
[1:07:06] calendar, his appointed times where
[1:07:09] every every feast pointed to a future
[1:07:13] fulfillment in Christ in his church. And
[1:07:16] here God will command them, now I want
[1:07:19] you to count seven Sabbaths from the day
[1:07:23] after the Passover leading to Pentecost.
[1:07:27] This is a feast of weeks, a celebration
[1:07:29] of first fruits. It's not just of grain
[1:07:32] this time, but it is a spiritual people.
[1:07:36] And so, I want you to count seven full
[1:07:38] weeks from the day after the Sabbath and
[1:07:41] then offer a new grain offering. You
[1:07:44] see, we're not we're not dealing with
[1:07:46] the barley harvest anymore. That's the
[1:07:49] old harvest. And the Old Testament
[1:07:51] saints have risen. They have already
[1:07:53] been glorified. They will not even be in
[1:07:57] our rapture
[1:07:59] when the saints appear. Abraham, Isaac,
[1:08:02] and Jacob will not appear with them.
[1:08:05] They're just the New Testament saints.
[1:08:07] We will meet them at the marriage
[1:08:09] supper. They have already been raptured.
[1:08:15] Amen. Now, so he said says, I want you
[1:08:18] to see this now as he's saying count
[1:08:21] seven weeks. You see, this was not just
[1:08:24] a feast. It was a mystery. It was a
[1:08:27] prophetic unveiling of the of the of the
[1:08:31] church written across time itself. It
[1:08:34] was seven Sabbaths. God's perfect number
[1:08:38] foreshadowing seven gentile church ages,
[1:08:42] all leading to a divine crescendo, a
[1:08:46] double portion offering of two loaves.
[1:08:51] Now remember I went through it the other
[1:08:53] day and I I want you to get this from
[1:08:55] again you know he didn't offer a a
[1:08:58] sheath of grain you know with with all
[1:09:01] the stock now the stock don't get
[1:09:03] weighed the she doesn't get weighed only
[1:09:07] the refined grain and it has been what
[1:09:10] ground and become a meal offering and
[1:09:14] that is waved before the Lord.
[1:09:17] Now I want you to see something here.
[1:09:19] This time it's not it's not even uh just
[1:09:23] the meal but now that meal that meal now
[1:09:26] has become two loaves
[1:09:31] here. This time he requires it to even
[1:09:33] go a step further
[1:09:36] than just the meal the raw meal weighed.
[1:09:40] Here he's going to weigh two loaves of
[1:09:43] bread.
[1:09:46] Now there is a a mystery that lays here.
[1:09:49] There is a spiritual significance. God
[1:09:52] doesn't do this just for to take up a
[1:09:55] place in the Bible. He he he does
[1:09:59] something very important here. Now,
[1:10:00] brother Brandham acknowledged the
[1:10:02] significance of this when he speaks of
[1:10:04] the sheath to be waved in the last days.
[1:10:06] And you'll find this in question answer
[1:10:08] 64. And I'll just quote this one
[1:10:11] sentence. Remember there the sheath
[1:10:13] turns into a loaf of bread after that
[1:10:15] time.
[1:10:18] So now notice this wasn't a sheath of
[1:10:22] raw grain. No, this was grain beaten,
[1:10:26] sifted, purified, and then baked by fire
[1:10:31] into two living loaves.
[1:10:35] Now you ask me, two loaves? Yeah. Two
[1:10:41] distinct groups.
[1:10:43] That's right. Jew and Gentile.
[1:10:48] Wrought by the same spirit, quickened by
[1:10:51] the same life, and now offered up in the
[1:10:54] last days as one glorious harvest unto
[1:10:58] the Lord. And then this climatic hour,
[1:11:00] he waves them both, not hidden, not
[1:11:04] secret, but before the eyes of the
[1:11:06] watching world.
[1:11:07] This is his testimony. This is his
[1:11:10] witness.
[1:11:12] You see, Israel has been reathered to a
[1:11:15] land of promise. And likewise, the bride
[1:11:18] had to be called out. Amen. Separated
[1:11:21] from the denominations and drawn back to
[1:11:23] the original word and back to the
[1:11:26] foundation of the apostles and the
[1:11:27] prophets, back to the pillar of fire,
[1:11:30] back to the glory and the power of God.
[1:11:32] Amen. You see, we are not here today
[1:11:35] longing for the days of the apostles. We
[1:11:37] are living in them again.
[1:11:40] Amen. The same spirit, the same power,
[1:11:42] the same quickening life that was there
[1:11:45] is now here.
[1:11:47] The same outpouring of the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:50] And at the feast of Pentecost, God
[1:11:52] instructed the people to bring these two
[1:11:55] loaves of bread with leaven.
[1:12:00] Oh my.
[1:12:03] It's a type of two of the church
[1:12:07] comprised of two groups, Jewish and
[1:12:10] Gentile.
[1:12:13] Not sin this time, though, but life.
[1:12:17] You see, the denominational world looks
[1:12:19] at this and say, God's going to wave a
[1:12:21] church that's still got sin in it.
[1:12:25] He's going to wave a church that still
[1:12:26] got imperfections in it. and this is
[1:12:29] going to be his church and he's going to
[1:12:31] wave that that with their imperfection,
[1:12:33] with their sin, it's just going to lift
[1:12:35] them up. No church, that ain't it at
[1:12:37] all. That's the fallacy of false
[1:12:40] religion
[1:12:42] because they teach you that you cannot
[1:12:45] live an overcoming life, that you cannot
[1:12:48] live above sin. So, you just got to have
[1:12:51] it. It's going to be with you until the
[1:12:54] end.
[1:12:56] But I'm I'm going to show you in the
[1:12:57] scripture by the scripture that that
[1:12:59] concept is wrong. You see at the feast
[1:13:02] of Pentecost, you know, God instructed
[1:13:05] them to bring it with leaven baked with
[1:13:08] leaven comp a church comprised of two
[1:13:11] groups Jewish and Gentile believers. Not
[1:13:14] with sin in it, but life, power, rising
[1:13:18] power, transformation power. What is
[1:13:22] that? It's a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:24] working within a people who were once
[1:13:27] dead but now have been made alive
[1:13:31] that are filled with resurrection power.
[1:13:34] As I said, it began with Jewish apostles
[1:13:37] in the upper room but across time that
[1:13:39] call went out to the Gentiles and it
[1:13:41] culminated in a gentile bride.
[1:13:45] And this leaven in the loaves is often
[1:13:48] as I said by
[1:13:50] denominationalism they theologians
[1:13:52] associated with sin and and and most of
[1:13:55] the time I admit you know levan is a
[1:13:58] type of sin
[1:14:00] most of the time it will be used as a
[1:14:03] type of sin and it's not accepted in
[1:14:05] worship
[1:14:07] but here it takes on a deeper meaning
[1:14:10] yeah throughout the church ages you've
[1:14:12] had false doctrines and unbelief and the
[1:14:15] lev of man's traditions were all mixed
[1:14:18] in but in this end time these two loaves
[1:14:21] with leaven takes on a different
[1:14:24] meaning. This time in the time the
[1:14:26] leaven also speaks of something powerful
[1:14:30] and positive. Life is life within the
[1:14:34] loaf. Amen. And that's why Jesus said,
[1:14:37] "The kingdom of heaven is
[1:14:40] like, the Holy Ghost is like leaven."
[1:14:45] Amen. Which a woman took and hid at
[1:14:49] three measures of meal till the whole
[1:14:51] was leavened.
[1:14:54] Amen. The kingdom of God is the Holy
[1:14:56] Ghost. And his dominion here is typed as
[1:15:00] leaven. It's likened to leaven. Levan
[1:15:02] lifts the bread. It gives it power. It
[1:15:05] gives it strength.
[1:15:07] And that leaven, believe it or not, is
[1:15:09] the Holy Spirit hidden in the hearts of
[1:15:11] the elect raising them up out of the
[1:15:14] power of sin and have raising them by
[1:15:17] the power of the revealed word until
[1:15:19] they've reached the full stature of
[1:15:22] Christ formed in them.
[1:15:25] Amen. Amen. You see, Levan is used in
[1:15:28] this type to represent the Holy Spirit
[1:15:30] whose inddwelling presence raises us up
[1:15:33] spiritually and empowers the church and
[1:15:36] causes the body of Christ to rise into
[1:15:39] maturity and unity and
[1:15:41] witness. Just as natural leaven works
[1:15:45] quietly and internally and powerfully,
[1:15:47] the Holy Spirit works within the
[1:15:50] believer in the body to bring growth and
[1:15:52] life and power. What is it? It's from
[1:15:55] glory to glory. He is changing you.
[1:15:59] Amen. As you grow in his might and his
[1:16:01] power.
[1:16:03] Oh yeah. As a spiritual picture, the
[1:16:06] rising of the leaven bread at Pentecost,
[1:16:09] it it points to the rising body of
[1:16:12] Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:15] It begins at Acts chapter 2. It
[1:16:18] continues today until we have come to
[1:16:20] the harvest feast at the end of the
[1:16:23] seven ages.
[1:16:25] And here we are at Pentecost again. I
[1:16:29] know, I know people don't want Pentecost
[1:16:33] anymore, but we have arrived back at
[1:16:36] Pentecost.
[1:16:38] Amen. We have come the full cycle. The
[1:16:41] grain has went from head to head.
[1:16:46] Amen. From Pentecost back to Pentecost
[1:16:49] again. Amen. You you see you see the
[1:16:52] Holy Ghost is what raises the bread.
[1:16:55] It's what raises the church into power.
[1:16:58] The Bible said in Acts chapter 1 and 8,
[1:17:01] but you shall receive power after that
[1:17:03] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[1:17:06] be witnesses unto me unto the uttermost
[1:17:08] parts of the earth. And the church was
[1:17:11] powerless until the spirit came. the
[1:17:14] Holy Ghost within the church. It caused
[1:17:17] the church to rise and boldness and and
[1:17:20] preach with clarity. They had a mission,
[1:17:23] amen, of deliverance and and they rose
[1:17:26] in the in revelation of the word as the
[1:17:29] word was revealed to them. Amen. You
[1:17:32] see, this marked the birth of the church
[1:17:35] as a living,
[1:17:37] spiritual, spiritfilled
[1:17:40] entity. Think of that. So the leaven
[1:17:43] here is not sin but quickening power.
[1:17:48] So Romans 8:11 says, "If the spirit that
[1:17:52] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:17:55] you, he shall also quicken your mortal
[1:17:57] bodies." By his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:18:00] you. So the resurrection power of the
[1:18:03] spirit not only raised Jesus, it
[1:18:05] quickens us. Amen. Do you think about
[1:18:08] it? We receive the same Holy Ghost that
[1:18:11] Jesus received.
[1:18:13] Amen. The same the same anointing, the
[1:18:16] same spirit of God. Amen. The And of
[1:18:19] course, this applies to us as individual
[1:18:21] believers, but collectively to the body
[1:18:24] of Christ. It's not just going to be one
[1:18:26] or two filled with the spirit. The whole
[1:18:28] body is going to be filled with the Holy
[1:18:31] Ghost. where the church rises from sin
[1:18:35] and from spiritual death into the
[1:18:37] newness of power and life. Amen.
[1:18:43] This is why we tie it back in with
[1:18:45] something that has been a theme of mine
[1:18:48] here in recent days. Ephesians 2:5 and
[1:18:51] six where we are raised and seated with
[1:18:54] Christ that even when we were dead in
[1:18:57] sins, he hath quickened us together with
[1:19:00] Christ and has raised us up together and
[1:19:03] made us sit together in heavenly places.
[1:19:06] You see the the Holy Ghost within the
[1:19:09] church is is that which gives rising to
[1:19:12] the dough to the church. The church is
[1:19:16] spiritually resurrected and is elevated
[1:19:19] by the spirit's work. And we we
[1:19:22] experience this by spiritled living.
[1:19:26] Think about that. It's also the
[1:19:28] manifestation of the spirit. You see the
[1:19:30] spirit is if it's if it's dead, if it
[1:19:34] has no life in it, you know, if it's
[1:19:37] something like you, you know, you women
[1:19:39] know if your baking soda gets old, your
[1:19:42] bacon powder, you know, can can run out
[1:19:44] of ability to raise the the the dough,
[1:19:48] right? And when you got to have
[1:19:49] something fresh, well, with this fresh
[1:19:52] anointing, there's a manifestation.
[1:19:56] Amen. You get the right level of the
[1:19:58] spirit in the church and you'll how the
[1:20:01] as the Bible said the manifestation of
[1:20:03] the spirit is given to every man to
[1:20:05] profit with all. So through the church
[1:20:08] or through the spirit rather the church
[1:20:10] is gifted and activated and the gifts
[1:20:13] cause the body to function and to grow
[1:20:16] and to operate in power. And so in that
[1:20:19] church will be healing. In that church
[1:20:21] will be prophecy. In that church will be
[1:20:24] wisdom. In that church will be
[1:20:26] discernment. Somebody help me preach. In
[1:20:29] that church will be miracles. In that
[1:20:31] church will there be the power of the
[1:20:33] spirit.
[1:20:35] Amen. Oh, this is why he says in
[1:20:38] Ephesians 3:16, he said that he would
[1:20:41] grant you to be strengthened by his
[1:20:44] might by his spirit in the inner man.
[1:20:48] Amen. Notice this. Strengthened with his
[1:20:51] might by his spirit.
[1:20:54] So the spirit infuses a church with
[1:20:58] spiritual strength with depth and
[1:21:00] revelation and the result is the church
[1:21:03] rises in love and unity and and and the
[1:21:08] ability to work in the supernatural
[1:21:10] realm. You know when with leaven it's
[1:21:13] the gaseous air that caused by the yeast
[1:21:16] that makes the bread to rise, right?
[1:21:20] It's the air, the breath of the spirit
[1:21:23] that makes the church to rise. Amen. Th
[1:21:26] this is shown even of a church that is
[1:21:28] rising a prophecy of you in this last
[1:21:31] day as well as Israel in Ezekiel
[1:21:34] 37:9-10 where he says, "Come from the
[1:21:38] four winds, O breath, and breathe upon
[1:21:40] these slain that they may live." And
[1:21:42] they stood up on their feet and a an
[1:21:45] exceeding great army.
[1:21:49] I know this is an Old Testament
[1:21:51] scripture, but it's a prophetic
[1:21:52] scripture of the picture of the church.
[1:21:55] Amen. As brother Brad said, in Christ
[1:21:57] the mystery. If I could just get over
[1:21:59] here to the those valley of dry bones.
[1:22:02] Amen. Here, Christ revealed in the
[1:22:05] church causes a church to rise to his
[1:22:07] feet with the spirit of God, the breath
[1:22:10] covenant to the church, raising the
[1:22:12] dead. Amen. the scattered bones of uh
[1:22:16] that we were scattered throughout
[1:22:18] denominationalism and come into a living
[1:22:21] powerful army of God.
[1:22:26] Listen church, this is this is a a a
[1:22:30] prophecy a prophecy of of God's
[1:22:33] empowerment of the spirit which he
[1:22:35] promised to do in this last day. And
[1:22:37] this happens in the end time both in the
[1:22:39] gathering of the Jews and the bride back
[1:22:43] to the homeland of the word. I want you
[1:22:47] to follow this thought. The Bible tells
[1:22:49] us in in 2 Corinthians 3:17, the Bible
[1:22:54] tells us that it's from glory to glory.
[1:22:57] Look at what he says. Now this Lord is
[1:23:00] that spirit.
[1:23:02] And where the spirit of the Lord is,
[1:23:04] there he is.
[1:23:06] not bring them back in bondage again.
[1:23:10] Liberty. Amen. And what is it? We are
[1:23:13] changed into the same image from glory
[1:23:16] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:23:19] Lord. So the Holy Spirit causes the
[1:23:22] church to ascend. Remember this is this
[1:23:25] is another theme of mine. You know,
[1:23:27] we're not a part of the fallen world.
[1:23:30] We're fallen we're part of a rising
[1:23:32] church. Amen.
[1:23:34] How else is that church going to rise
[1:23:36] except by the power of the Holy Ghost?
[1:23:40] Amen. It won't be another theological
[1:23:42] teaching. It won't be a new way of
[1:23:45] psychology.
[1:23:46] No, it'll be the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:49] rising that church up.
[1:23:52] Amen.
[1:23:54] Cause uses to ascend spiritually from
[1:23:56] one degree of glory to another.
[1:23:59] that transformation power is going on
[1:24:02] and is and right now and it's causing a
[1:24:05] people to rise upward and and become a
[1:24:08] powerful church.
[1:24:10] Amen. A mighty army, an invincible army.
[1:24:14] Amen. One with a with a fire that the
[1:24:17] devil can't extinguish.
[1:24:19] Amen. Micah ver chapter 3 and verse 8
[1:24:23] said, "But truly I'm full of power by
[1:24:26] the spirit of the Lord and of judgment
[1:24:28] of might." So you see, he said, "I'm
[1:24:30] full of power by the spirit of the
[1:24:31] Lord." And so it gives us the boldness.
[1:24:34] It gives us the authority that is given
[1:24:37] by the Holy Ghost for you to speak, for
[1:24:40] you to lead, and for you to act
[1:24:42] righteously to do the right things.
[1:24:46] You see, the Holy Spirit causes the
[1:24:49] church to rise in power. Are you with
[1:24:52] me? In resurrection life.
[1:24:56] Amen. You who are dead and s and
[1:24:58] trespasses. You've already risen in
[1:25:01] heavenly authority. You're seated in
[1:25:03] heavenly places in gifts and operation
[1:25:05] of the spirit. Every one of them still
[1:25:07] belongs in the church in glory,
[1:25:10] boldness, and transformation. In
[1:25:12] revelation, as the mystery truths are
[1:25:14] restored and revealed, that's the day
[1:25:17] we're living. It's a day where we are
[1:25:20] moving upward. We're not falling.
[1:25:24] Come on, church. Amen. you you I can
[1:25:27] remember my mother, you know, years ago,
[1:25:29] you know, or my wife, you know, baking a
[1:25:31] cake and, you know, when you when you
[1:25:33] look into it, you're careful not to bump
[1:25:35] it too hard.
[1:25:37] Amen. Why you way it'll lose the the
[1:25:41] rising, it'll fall flat.
[1:25:44] Amen. I'll tell you, the devil's doing
[1:25:46] everything he can to bump this church.
[1:25:49] Amen. To get the spirit out of it. To
[1:25:52] get the Holy Ghost keep from moving in
[1:25:54] the church. Amen. To keep the joy of the
[1:25:57] Lord from overflowing. Amen. The devil
[1:25:59] doing everything he can to bump it. But
[1:26:01] God said, "I'm going to offer. I'm going
[1:26:04] to have an offering of bread in this
[1:26:07] last day." And they'll have the power of
[1:26:10] the risen Christ in it.
[1:26:15] So
[1:26:17] yeah, we're more than just a gathering
[1:26:20] of people.
[1:26:21] We're more than just another
[1:26:23] denominational group.
[1:26:26] Look, a great historian, David Harold,
[1:26:29] he wrote books, you know, about the end
[1:26:32] time movements and gave his assessment
[1:26:34] in his book, All Things Are
[1:26:36] Possible. And he said, I believe what I
[1:26:39] we are witnessing and what we are seeing
[1:26:41] with the move of this message in this
[1:26:44] last day is another denomination rising.
[1:26:48] I say that ain't it.
[1:26:51] It's not another denomination.
[1:26:54] Come on. It's not another movement
[1:26:56] that's going to fall flat.
[1:26:58] Hallelujah. It's not a people that are
[1:27:00] going down. Amen. It's a people that
[1:27:03] will defy the cycle of revival and
[1:27:05] death. Amen. Who be changed in a moment.
[1:27:09] There will be a spirit empowered body
[1:27:12] rising continually under the influence
[1:27:15] of the indwelling Holy Ghost. I I'm
[1:27:17] telling you, church, don't don't look to
[1:27:20] fall. Look to rise higher.
[1:27:26] Well, the shout will go out of the camp.
[1:27:28] Oh, just wait until the revival dies
[1:27:30] down. It's just another revival. It's
[1:27:33] not another revival. This is end time
[1:27:36] harvest.
[1:27:38] And God has said, I'll have those
[1:27:42] that are leavened.
[1:27:47] Oh yeah. I admit there's two kinds of
[1:27:50] leaven.
[1:27:53] One kind the leaven of sin. It was not
[1:27:56] allowed in worship.
[1:27:58] This is why only unleavened bread was
[1:28:00] served at the Passover because Jesus is
[1:28:02] our unleavened bread. He is the sinless
[1:28:05] Messiah.
[1:28:07] How many believes that? And when Paul
[1:28:10] wrote to the church and the Ephesians,
[1:28:12] he said, "Don't you know a little yeast
[1:28:14] or a little leaven permeates and
[1:28:16] leavenvens a whole lump, the whole batch
[1:28:18] of dough." You see, he used fermenting
[1:28:22] yeast to illustrate how one sin will
[1:28:25] lead to another in a snowballing effect.
[1:28:29] And Jesus warned against 11 of the of
[1:28:34] the organized religion of the Pharisees
[1:28:36] as as false doctrine contaminates the
[1:28:39] church as it's done for the past seven
[1:28:42] ages. And these doctrines are are are
[1:28:45] workings of devils that produce a
[1:28:49] contaminated woman.
[1:28:52] Read about her in the Bible. She's a
[1:28:54] blemished church. He calls her the great
[1:28:57] She has daughters that are
[1:28:59] harlots. They're contaminated,
[1:29:02] spotted by the world, rejected and
[1:29:05] marked by God as mystery Babylon, the
[1:29:08] great the mother of harlots.
[1:29:11] That's right. Right. So you see the
[1:29:14] loaves offered at Pentecost in the
[1:29:16] harvest of the seven ages cannot
[1:29:19] represent the bride with sin of
[1:29:22] leaven. Why, brother Tim?
[1:29:25] because he will present to himself a
[1:29:29] church without spot, without wrinkle or
[1:29:33] blemish.
[1:29:36] So if he's going to present loaves,
[1:29:39] come on. It won't be loads with sin in
[1:29:42] it. That's right. Come on. Amen. No. No.
[1:29:47] And he will present himself a church
[1:29:50] without spots, without a wrinkle,
[1:29:54] without a blemish or any such thing.
[1:30:01] A church says a virgin to the word that
[1:30:04] he'll present to himself an
[1:30:07] unblenmished, undefiled woman.
[1:30:11] And I want you to know, you have already
[1:30:14] been declared
[1:30:17] that you are the sinless virtuous bride
[1:30:20] of Jesus Christ as one filled with the
[1:30:23] Holy Ghost sealed to the day redemption.
[1:30:25] So this leaven in this bread is not sin
[1:30:28] but it's a righteous leaven the Holy
[1:30:30] Spirit within her that causes her to
[1:30:32] rise in glory and power and is way
[1:30:35] before the Lord. Amen. And this is a
[1:30:40] message of restoration.
[1:30:43] And it makes us to stand on very sacred
[1:30:46] ground this morning.
[1:30:48] Oh yeah. On on the prophetic threshold
[1:30:50] of understanding the glory that was
[1:30:53] poured out in Pentecost. And that
[1:30:55] understanding is now to understand that
[1:30:58] it is now the same glory pointed out
[1:31:01] poured out again in this Pentecostal
[1:31:04] harvest time.
[1:31:07] The day of
[1:31:08] Pentecost, it was a divine
[1:31:11] moment. It was where heaven kissed the
[1:31:14] earth
[1:31:16] and the fire of God descended with power
[1:31:19] filling sons of God with deity. How many
[1:31:22] believes that? And oh yes, there were I
[1:31:25] want to say what this something to in
[1:31:28] this feast there is more than bread.
[1:31:32] I want you to notice we read several
[1:31:34] things, but there's more than bread at
[1:31:36] this feast. There is wine.
[1:31:40] The the wine of the covenant, joy, and
[1:31:43] the spirit of the living God,
[1:31:47] is also accompanies this wave offering.
[1:31:52] So now Joan pictures this harvest time
[1:31:55] as a result of the latter
[1:31:57] rain. because of the latter rain. Now
[1:32:01] remember remember this latter rain is
[1:32:04] raptured faith and and as a result of
[1:32:07] that where God pours out his spirit
[1:32:10] there is a
[1:32:11] restoration back to the original grain
[1:32:14] again. So the latter rain comes to give
[1:32:17] it the final
[1:32:19] push to come to perfect maturity.
[1:32:23] Now, if you look at Joel chapter 2 and
[1:32:26] verse 24, I want you to notice in the
[1:32:29] restoration where he says, "I'll pour
[1:32:30] out my spirit."
[1:32:34] And the floors shall be full of wheat.
[1:32:37] God says, "I'm going to have a crop."
[1:32:40] Amen. Amen. I'm going to have a crop.
[1:32:42] I'll have a bride in the end time. It
[1:32:45] shall be full of wheat, and the fat
[1:32:47] shall
[1:32:49] overflow what? with wine and oil.
[1:32:56] So, not only is
[1:32:57] there in the celebration the bread, but
[1:33:02] in this harvest celebration, the wine of
[1:33:04] God is poured out as a drink offered to
[1:33:07] him.
[1:33:09] Now, this is another powerful type. It's
[1:33:11] a a shadow that's speaking to us this
[1:33:14] morning. You you see leaven or yeast
[1:33:18] once again it reveals the work of the
[1:33:21] spirit for at Pentecost it wasn't just
[1:33:23] bread offered. Oh no there was another
[1:33:26] element another sign another witness the
[1:33:28] drink offering the wine poured out
[1:33:31] before the Lord is an offering made by
[1:33:33] fire. Oh my God. Can't you see it this
[1:33:37] morning? Amen. There's got to be wine
[1:33:40] in this harvest season.
[1:33:43] At Pentecost, what stood before heaven
[1:33:47] and earth was not just a ritual, but it
[1:33:50] was a prophetic revelation. Look back in
[1:33:52] the scripture. It's really portraying of
[1:33:55] this last day.
[1:33:57] You see, two waves or two loaves way
[1:34:01] before the Lord, Jew and Gentile. Now
[1:34:05] bear with me as I go through this. These
[1:34:08] Gentiles and Jews becoming one offering
[1:34:13] in the harvest
[1:34:15] season.
[1:34:18] 120 120 Jews were in the upper room.
[1:34:22] That's one loaf.
[1:34:24] Come on.
[1:34:26] And mysteries are mysteries. There's
[1:34:29] another loaf.
[1:34:33] Another people And this was so
[1:34:36] unexpected in that day. Nobody knew the
[1:34:41] Gentiles would receive grace.
[1:34:45] And so the res as a result of the spirit
[1:34:49] falling, the Gentiles were brought in.
[1:34:54] Now I want you to see this. At the house
[1:34:56] of Cornelius, there was a supernatural
[1:34:59] visitation of an angel instructing the
[1:35:03] gentile cent centurion to go get Peter
[1:35:07] to come from Japa from the house of a
[1:35:10] man of s Simon the tanner and for him to
[1:35:14] him to come and to tell them the way of
[1:35:16] the truth. And God at the same time
[1:35:20] after this vision comes to Cordelius at
[1:35:23] the same time Peter gets a vision.
[1:35:27] You know he's hungry and he lays down
[1:35:29] for a little bit and he breaks out into
[1:35:32] a trance a vision
[1:35:35] and God is preparing him to receive some
[1:35:38] visitors because as a Jew he will not
[1:35:42] associate with Gentiles.
[1:35:45] You remember he even had trouble with
[1:35:46] this in the book of Galatians. Paul
[1:35:48] rebuked him for it. He said because you
[1:35:51] know when the elders wasn't around, you
[1:35:53] ate with the Gentiles. But when when
[1:35:55] James and them came around of the
[1:35:57] elders, you know, the Jewish elders, you
[1:35:59] withdrew yourself.
[1:36:04] Remember, he had trouble with that.
[1:36:07] And God was preparing him for a a
[1:36:11] breaking revelation that there was
[1:36:14] another loaf that was going to come out
[1:36:18] and it would be a gentile loaf that they
[1:36:21] too would be the bread of the Lord.
[1:36:24] That's right. And so, you know, here
[1:36:28] here he has a a vision of of of a a
[1:36:32] sheep that is brought down from heaven.
[1:36:34] And on it is all kinds of beasts and
[1:36:36] wild animals and unclean things.
[1:36:40] And he's given the instruction, slay and
[1:36:42] eat.
[1:36:44] And it it ascends and descends three
[1:36:46] times because that's going to represent
[1:36:48] the three men that are going to be
[1:36:50] coming at his door.
[1:36:52] And so as he as he looks at it, he said,
[1:36:55] "Not so, my Lord. I I have never eaten
[1:36:57] that which is
[1:36:59] unclean." And God said, "Don't you call
[1:37:03] what I call clean unclean."
[1:37:08] Amen. Oh, no. I I've got an elect. In
[1:37:10] fact, in a matter, I've already sent an
[1:37:12] angel to him. I've already prepared him
[1:37:15] for your coming. Come on. And there as
[1:37:18] he comes out of his traps, there's a
[1:37:20] knock at the door and three men stand at
[1:37:23] the door which are Gentiles says, "Come
[1:37:26] to the house of Cornelius because we've
[1:37:28] had an angel visitation."
[1:37:32] Oh my. The Bible said in Acts 10:45,
[1:37:35] let's read it. And you know, as we look
[1:37:39] at it, remember when he gets there, he
[1:37:41] tells them of the way of truth of what
[1:37:43] God has done. And the Holy Ghost falls
[1:37:45] on them.
[1:37:47] And they Yeah. The Holy Ghost falls on
[1:37:50] Gentiles.
[1:37:51] This is unbelievable to these Jews.
[1:37:55] We're the only ones of the covenant, not
[1:37:56] of the new covenant. In the new
[1:37:59] covenant, there's two loaves.
[1:38:03] Come on. I'm going to show you in the
[1:38:05] scripture now. And there's going to be
[1:38:06] two loaves. And they and and when they
[1:38:09] come together and the Bible said while
[1:38:11] Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:38:13] fell on them which heard the word.
[1:38:17] Amen. Oh brother Tim you know it was
[1:38:20] without sensation. They didn't even know
[1:38:22] it. That's not what happened.
[1:38:24] Verse 45. And they of the circumcision,
[1:38:26] referring to the Jewish believers, which
[1:38:29] believe were astonished,
[1:38:32] as many came with Peter, because that on
[1:38:35] the Gentiles also was poured out the
[1:38:38] gift of the Holy Ghost, for they heard
[1:38:40] them speak with tongues and magnify God.
[1:38:45] And then Peter answered and and said,
[1:38:48] "Can anyone forbid water that these
[1:38:51] should not be baptized which have
[1:38:52] received the Holy Ghost as well as we?"
[1:38:54] And when he commanded them to be
[1:38:57] baptized in the name of the Lord, the
[1:39:00] Lord Jesus.
[1:39:03] Amen. Because there's nowhere in the
[1:39:05] book of Acts that anybody was ever
[1:39:06] baptized other than in the name of Jesus
[1:39:09] Christ.
[1:39:11] This is the apostles
[1:39:12] formula. Now, I want you to turn with me
[1:39:15] to Ephesians 3 and 4. Paul picks this
[1:39:19] up. And remember, he calls himself the
[1:39:22] apostle to the Gentiles. And in fact, he
[1:39:25] gets this he gets this point where the
[1:39:28] the gospel is being rejected and he said
[1:39:30] from now on I'll turn to the
[1:39:32] Gentiles. So here he now turns to formed
[1:39:36] this other loaf. Now watch Ephesians 3
[1:39:39] and:4 whereby when you read when you
[1:39:42] read may you may understand my knowledge
[1:39:46] when you read you may understand my
[1:39:48] knowledge in the mystery of Christ which
[1:39:50] in other ages was not made known unto
[1:39:53] the sons of men other ages we didn't
[1:39:56] know this but it's now revealed to his
[1:39:58] holy apostles and prophets by the spirit
[1:40:01] here's a fresh revelation we just got
[1:40:04] that the Gentiles should be fellow hes
[1:40:08] and of the same body and partakers of
[1:40:10] his promise in Christ by the gospel.
[1:40:14] Oh, here comes a revelation. There's
[1:40:17] another loaf.
[1:40:20] Amen. A gentile body, a people of
[1:40:23] believers.
[1:40:25] Somebody help me preach now. Amen. So,
[1:40:28] it's a part of the
[1:40:31] mystery to the Jews that the Gentiles
[1:40:34] would be brought in.
[1:40:38] Amen. And God had already foreshadowed
[1:40:41] it many years ago with two loaves.
[1:40:47] Amen.
[1:40:49] Now, we're going to deviate just for a
[1:40:52] moment, and we're going to we'll come
[1:40:55] back to the two loaves, but I want to
[1:40:57] talk about this yeast a little more
[1:41:00] because alongside the two
[1:41:03] loaves was wine and
[1:41:06] fire. Oh yeah. Wine symbolic of the
[1:41:10] spirit. Fire the sign of his presence.
[1:41:14] It was the birth of the church that as I
[1:41:17] said the union of heaven and earth the
[1:41:19] infilling of the Holy Ghost. And how is
[1:41:22] wine made church? Anybody know? By
[1:41:26] adding yeast
[1:41:31] lemon
[1:41:33] to the pure juice of the grape.
[1:41:37] Huh? And what does that wine become in
[1:41:40] the divine language of scripture? It
[1:41:42] becomes a symbol of the Holy Ghost,
[1:41:45] the fermenting lifegiving power that
[1:41:48] transformed the natural into the
[1:41:50] supernatural. Amen. So on that
[1:41:54] Pentecostal morning, God poured out his
[1:41:57] spirit like wine,
[1:42:00] ignited it with fire, and brought for
[1:42:02] the church a living offering of both Jew
[1:42:05] and Gentile, filled and baptized and
[1:42:08] consumed by the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:42:10] right. I say, "Glory to God."
[1:42:13] Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. The wine of
[1:42:17] the fire to go with the bread.
[1:42:22] The Bible said in Acts chapter 2 and
[1:42:24] verse 13, others mocking said, "These
[1:42:27] men are full of new
[1:42:29] wine." And Peter stood up and said,
[1:42:32] "These are not drunken as you suppose,
[1:42:36] seeing this is the third hour of the
[1:42:38] day." Oh, no. This is not this is not
[1:42:40] natural wine. You see, on the day of
[1:42:43] Pentecost, the offspring of the spirit
[1:42:46] caused the disciples to speak in
[1:42:49] tongues.
[1:42:50] Amen. It caused them to rejoice. It
[1:42:53] caused them to exhibit behavior that
[1:42:55] made onlookers think they were drunk
[1:42:58] with new wine.
[1:43:01] Oh, brother Brandon will describe this
[1:43:03] time and time again of the outpouring of
[1:43:05] the Holy Ghost. He even talks about Mary
[1:43:08] and he said Mary the mother of Jesus was
[1:43:11] in the in the upper room and she standed
[1:43:13] like a drunk woman and spoke in other
[1:43:16] tongues. She got all excited about what
[1:43:18] she received.
[1:43:20] Come on somebody. And he said you'll
[1:43:22] never get to heaven without the same
[1:43:24] experience.
[1:43:27] I don't know how we reduce it today just
[1:43:30] to some kind of intellectual knowledge
[1:43:32] and acceptance of some truth. Let me
[1:43:34] tell you, if you really accept the
[1:43:36] truth, it'll be fire in your bones.
[1:43:39] Amen. No, sir. It made people think they
[1:43:42] were drunk. It was new wine. But it
[1:43:45] wasn't a literal drunkenness, but it was
[1:43:48] a spiritual infilling. It was so
[1:43:50] powerful. It was liberating. It was
[1:43:53] overflowing until it affected their
[1:43:55] speech and and gave them boldness.
[1:43:59] You You see that? And Peter will correct
[1:44:01] the crowd here and say they're not drunk
[1:44:03] with natural wine, but this is a
[1:44:06] heavenly intoxication.
[1:44:09] Oh, if you ever drink it, Amen. Nothing
[1:44:13] else will work. That's right. Amen. You
[1:44:16] will go the rest of your life just
[1:44:18] wanting another drink of it.
[1:44:20] One drink ain't enough. Amen. You want
[1:44:24] another drink and another drink and
[1:44:26] another drink and every day you want to
[1:44:28] be intoxicated by the Holy Ghost
[1:44:32] overflowing in your
[1:44:34] life. You see new wine that becomes it
[1:44:38] becomes the metaphor for the Holy
[1:44:40] Spirit's fresh outpouring and it
[1:44:42] fulfilling Joel's prophecy of Joel 2:28
[1:44:46] where he said in the last days I will
[1:44:49] pour out my spirit. It's the drink
[1:44:52] offering. Ephesians 5:18, Paul makes a
[1:44:56] direct correlation between the two,
[1:44:59] makes a comparison and he says, "And be
[1:45:02] not drunk with wine wherein is excess,
[1:45:05] but be filled with the spirit."
[1:45:10] So he he he makes a deliberate contrast
[1:45:12] here. He said, "Don't seek natural
[1:45:15] intoxication.
[1:45:17] Instead, be filled." And the Greek there
[1:45:20] is continually filled.
[1:45:24] Come on church.
[1:45:27] What about you mosback Christians that
[1:45:30] had an experience many years ago?
[1:45:34] Is it time for another drink?
[1:45:38] Is it time for another refilling of that
[1:45:40] same spirit? Yes. I I'm telling you
[1:45:43] again as he says here in the Greek
[1:45:46] continually filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:50] Don't be drunk with wine. Be filled with
[1:45:53] the spirit.
[1:45:56] Amen. Paul tells us that the the Holy
[1:45:59] Spirit's influence. He gives us a joyous
[1:46:03] overwhelming liberating effects that
[1:46:06] it's it's is similar in appearance to
[1:46:09] drunkenness.
[1:46:10] But it's holy.
[1:46:13] It's righteous. It's empowering. It's
[1:46:16] lifegiving.
[1:46:18] Come on. Amen. It It changes your life.
[1:46:22] It transforms your thinking. It changes
[1:46:25] your vision.
[1:46:30] This is what happened at Pentecost. They
[1:46:32] were filled with the spirit. The new
[1:46:34] wine, it changed their thinking. It
[1:46:36] changed their being. It made them speak
[1:46:38] heaven's language.
[1:46:40] And when it's poured out today, it
[1:46:42] brings the same joy and power. It's no
[1:46:45] different. Amen. It works on the people
[1:46:48] in this day just like it worked on
[1:46:50] people 2,000 years ago. Come on, brother
[1:46:54] and Tyson spirits many years ago. He
[1:46:57] said this. He said, "What we need to do
[1:46:59] is come back to the guide book, back to
[1:47:01] the word of God. This is the word of
[1:47:03] God. This blessed old Bible." Well, I'm
[1:47:06] afraid to become that, Brother Brown.
[1:47:08] I'm afraid I'll lose some of my
[1:47:11] joy. What's the matter? He said, "You
[1:47:13] don't know what joy is."
[1:47:16] And I'm just telling you, if if you've
[1:47:19] never drank this new wine, you don't
[1:47:21] really know what joy is.
[1:47:24] Well, I get real satisfaction out of my
[1:47:27] cigarette. And you know, hey, it just
[1:47:29] gives me a great feeling after my meal.
[1:47:32] Yeah. It's death.
[1:47:34] Well, I get great great joy out of uh,
[1:47:37] you know, it just relaxes me with my
[1:47:39] wine and it just it just gives me a
[1:47:43] merry heart. You know, when when I drink
[1:47:46] alcohol, you hadn't tasted this.
[1:47:50] There ain't no comparison to this joy.
[1:47:54] Amen. That that wine will wind you. Come
[1:47:58] on. They paint it as a picture of of a
[1:48:00] of a woman laying there dressed in black
[1:48:03] and and you know her orals 92 or
[1:48:06] whatever it is that that she's drinking
[1:48:08] and and you know she she's just living
[1:48:11] the life but they don't show you the old
[1:48:13] sod
[1:48:15] stacking out with spit all over her
[1:48:17] mouth and ragged laying out in the
[1:48:20] gutter.
[1:48:21] They don't show you a trunk. They don't
[1:48:24] show you the end of it. That's right.
[1:48:27] Amen. Let me tell you that that wine of
[1:48:30] the devil will destroy your life. That's
[1:48:32] right. That alcohol will ruin you. It'll
[1:48:36] get a hold of you. Yeah, it's addictive.
[1:48:38] But so is the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost
[1:48:41] is an addiction.
[1:48:43] Amen. Once you get a shot of it, you
[1:48:45] want some more. Once you get a taste of
[1:48:48] it, you got to have it again. Amen. Once
[1:48:51] you ever got drunk, you want to do it
[1:48:52] again. But you lose your cares. You you
[1:48:56] you love everybody. You're with friends
[1:48:58] with everybody because why? You have the
[1:49:01] Holy Ghost.
[1:49:07] Brother Brandham, I'm afraid I'll lose
[1:49:09] some of my joy. What's the matter? You
[1:49:11] don't know what joy is.
[1:49:15] And I said, I don't condemn the drunkard
[1:49:18] for going out and getting drunk. He's
[1:49:21] all moody. He don't know. He gets up in
[1:49:24] the morning, he's got the blues, a
[1:49:26] hangover, goes and gets him two or three
[1:49:28] bottles of beer. Goes out, gets him some
[1:49:31] whiskey and all that kind of stuff. The
[1:49:33] little cigarette sucker sets back and
[1:49:36] smoke and blow it through his nose like
[1:49:38] he was a freight train. That's all he
[1:49:41] knows. That's all they know. That's all
[1:49:44] they know. He said, "I don't blame
[1:49:47] him. That's all the joy he knows. That's
[1:49:51] all he knows about. He's a pig by
[1:49:54] nature.
[1:49:57] And he says, "Shame on you who profess
[1:50:00] to be a Christian and rely on such
[1:50:02] things for joy." When the Holy Ghost
[1:50:04] gospel is nothing but one great big
[1:50:07] powerhouse of joy. The Holy Ghost is the
[1:50:10] perfect intoxication for every man
[1:50:13] that's got the blues. You'll take a
[1:50:15] drink of the gospel of Jesus Christ, be
[1:50:17] filled with the Holy Ghost, you're drunk
[1:50:20] until you leave this world. Amen. Joy,
[1:50:23] unspeakable, full of glory. It's a
[1:50:25] constant stimulation. It's a constant
[1:50:28] intoxication. Drunk day and night. Amen.
[1:50:32] That's the word of God.
[1:50:35] Hallelujah. I tell you, why don't you
[1:50:36] try this?
[1:50:38] Why don't you try this new wine? The
[1:50:41] other leads to death.
[1:50:44] Get a hold of this new new wine is
[1:50:46] lifech changing. It'll change your mood.
[1:50:51] It'll change your attitude.
[1:50:54] But let me tell you, there's a secret
[1:50:56] about this. You can't put new wine in
[1:50:59] old bottles.
[1:51:04] You see, Jesus taught this powerful
[1:51:05] truth in Luke
[1:51:07] 5:37. No one puts new wine into old
[1:51:10] bottles, else the new wine will burst
[1:51:12] the bottle, be spilled, and the bottles
[1:51:14] shall perish. But new wine must be put
[1:51:16] into new bottles.
[1:51:19] This is the gospel. Now, to grasp this,
[1:51:23] you're going to have to understand that
[1:51:25] you know that in Jesus' day, a bottle
[1:51:27] wasn't a glass.
[1:51:30] It was a container made of animal hide.
[1:51:33] It wasn't when and when it was new, you
[1:51:36] know, the skin would be soft and
[1:51:38] flexible and full of natural oil. But
[1:51:42] over time, the hide would dry out and
[1:51:44] would harden. If you poured new wine,
[1:51:47] this fermented wine into that old
[1:51:49] brittle skin, the pressure from the
[1:51:52] wine's living expanded nature would
[1:51:55] cause the bottle to burst. It would ruin
[1:51:58] both the wine and the bottle.
[1:52:01] Right? And that's what Jesus is talking
[1:52:03] about. New wine represents the living
[1:52:06] word of God, alive with the spirit,
[1:52:09] always moving, always expanding.
[1:52:14] Come on. I know some of you got duds in
[1:52:16] your
[1:52:19] bottle. Come on, I'm saying it. I know
[1:52:22] some of you got dud in your bottle. It
[1:52:25] has no fizz, has no life in it. But I'm
[1:52:29] telling you, this new wine, when it
[1:52:31] comes into a bottle, it expands.
[1:52:34] It pushes out. It grows. It moves.
[1:52:40] Come on. It don't become dead. It's a
[1:52:42] living. It's living on the inside.
[1:52:45] There's something alive in that wine.
[1:52:51] Amen. And the old bottle, what is that
[1:52:53] old bottle? Well, it's a rigid formal
[1:52:55] intellectual system that can't stretch
[1:52:58] to receive the move of God.
[1:53:01] It's religion without oil. It's formed
[1:53:03] without power and it cannot contain the
[1:53:05] living Christ. Amen. Now, you can pour
[1:53:09] water or dead tradition, man's theories
[1:53:12] into an old bottle, but not wine.
[1:53:16] When wine has life, it pushes. It
[1:53:18] swells. And when God pours out his
[1:53:21] spirit, his new wine, he needs new
[1:53:25] vessels.
[1:53:28] Amen. New vessels. Come on. You You
[1:53:30] can't come You just can't come over and
[1:53:32] bring your old your old ways and your
[1:53:35] old self. Come on. You're going to have
[1:53:37] to be made new by the Holy Ghost. And
[1:53:40] what the holy when God pours out his
[1:53:42] spirit, his new wine, he needs new
[1:53:44] vessels. Not just people turning over a
[1:53:47] new leaf.
[1:53:49] Well, I'll quit smoking. I'll quit
[1:53:51] doping. I'll quit drinking just to pick
[1:53:53] it up again. No. No. You know, not a not
[1:53:56] not a church offering psychology classes
[1:53:59] on how to deal with sex sin and porn
[1:54:02] habits. That's not revival. That's not
[1:54:05] renewing of the spirit. No. No. That you
[1:54:08] see that's a resolution that most cannot
[1:54:10] keep.
[1:54:12] Amen. The church doesn't need a
[1:54:14] faceelift. It needs a new birth.
[1:54:17] That's right. Amen. God isn't pouring
[1:54:20] out his Holy Ghost in the stiff, dry,
[1:54:23] dead theological systems.
[1:54:26] He's looking for hearts that are made
[1:54:28] new. people who are flexible, who are
[1:54:31] anointed with the oil of the spirit,
[1:54:33] vessels that can stretch with the word
[1:54:35] of God. And when the new wine says Jesus
[1:54:38] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:54:40] forever, the bottle is it expands. It
[1:54:43] pushes out and say, "Amen."
[1:54:48] Hallelujah. And it stretches to receive
[1:54:50] that word. And when the word said, "By
[1:54:53] his stripes, I'm healed." Amen. The new
[1:54:55] Bible doesn't analyze it to death. It
[1:54:57] believes and it shouts out,
[1:54:59] "Hallelujah."
[1:55:04] Amen. Now, old bottles will
[1:55:07] crack. They will crumble. They will
[1:55:10] rupture because it cannot hold the new
[1:55:14] wine.
[1:55:16] They say the days of miracles are
[1:55:18] passed.
[1:55:20] The Holy Ghost is just for the apostle
[1:55:22] and it spews out.
[1:55:26] and push it right out of the out of the
[1:55:28] church. Healing ended with the early
[1:55:31] church. That's an old brittle cowhide
[1:55:34] trying to contain the living God. You
[1:55:37] can't force new life into a dead
[1:55:39] tradition.
[1:55:41] Amen. Come on. You only make a mess. You
[1:55:44] You lose the wine and you'll ruin the
[1:55:46] vessel. That's what's the matter with
[1:55:48] too many around. You remember in the
[1:55:50] Bible, what is it? Acts chapter 15 and
[1:55:54] many of the Pharisees which believed.
[1:55:58] Do you ever notice that in the scripture
[1:55:59] where they were arguing over
[1:56:01] circumcision and was wanting to keep the
[1:56:03] church under legalism instead of seeing
[1:56:05] the grace that was given and the
[1:56:07] spiritual circumcision you had to have.
[1:56:10] Is somebody with me? Amen. And and he
[1:56:13] said he said many of the Pharisees which
[1:56:16] believe said we got to obey the law of
[1:56:18] Moses. You see, they were trying to
[1:56:20] bring the old religious system in and
[1:56:23] mix it with the new message.
[1:56:26] They were Pharisees which believed. How
[1:56:28] in the world did Pharisees get in the
[1:56:31] new church if you' really got born
[1:56:34] again? If you'd really got spiritfilled,
[1:56:37] you wouldn't have been a Pharisee. I'm
[1:56:40] going to ask you, how do we still have
[1:56:41] Baptist and Methodist and Presbyterian
[1:56:43] and Catholicism in the message? You
[1:56:46] hadn't died to your own system.
[1:56:49] That's why you think the Holy Ghost is
[1:56:51] just when you believe
[1:56:53] because you never died to that Baptist
[1:56:55] theology.
[1:56:57] The Holy Ghost comes after you believe.
[1:56:59] After you believe you were sealed. Have
[1:57:01] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:57:03] believe?
[1:57:08] Amen. No wonder they're losing the new
[1:57:10] wine. It's all drained out.
[1:57:13] There's too many churches across the
[1:57:15] country, too many message churches that
[1:57:19] have lost the wine.
[1:57:26] Oh, even tonight, don't lose your wine.
[1:57:29] Amen. Let's have flexible bottles all by
[1:57:32] the Holy Ghost that can expand out.
[1:57:36] But on the day of Pentecost, did you
[1:57:38] notice God had 120 brand new bottles in
[1:57:41] that upper room? He had washed them in
[1:57:44] the word. He had softened them with
[1:57:46] faith. He had emptied them of tradition.
[1:57:48] And they stood them up right on their
[1:57:50] necks to open up to heaven. And when the
[1:57:53] Holy Ghost fell that when that new wine
[1:57:55] came rushing down, it filled them to
[1:57:58] overflowing.
[1:57:59] Hallelujah. They couldn't sit still.
[1:58:02] They staggered out of that room like
[1:58:04] drunk men. Oh man. Drunk on the heavenly
[1:58:06] wine. And Peter declared, "This is that.
[1:58:10] Here's the word being fulfilled.
[1:58:14] Well, I'm telling you, there's a people
[1:58:16] in this day going to fulfill the word.
[1:58:18] They're going to have new wine.
[1:58:22] They're going to be a part of Jo's
[1:58:24] prophecy where the spirit is poured out.
[1:58:31] That's the bride's revival that God
[1:58:32] wants. Not an intellectual revival.
[1:58:35] That's the church that God is building.
[1:58:38] Not a cold edifice filled with
[1:58:40] intellectuals, but a body baptized with
[1:58:43] fire. That's what I say this morning.
[1:58:45] Baptize uses again, Lord. You did it
[1:58:48] once, you can do it again. I've had a
[1:58:50] sip of it once. I want a greater sip
[1:58:52] today. Amen. You I'm here with my neck
[1:58:55] open, my bottle turned up, but I'm
[1:58:58] reaching toward heaven. And I'm saying,
[1:59:00] "Fill me with that wine from heaven.
[1:59:02] Fill me again with the Holy Ghost. Let
[1:59:05] the power of the spirit come. Can I say
[1:59:08] amen to the word of God?
[1:59:15] Wow. When that 120 bottles, if you you
[1:59:20] hear brother Brandon talk about it, he
[1:59:22] says they bounced out of that upper
[1:59:24] room. Amen. They were full of power. New
[1:59:29] wine bubbling up, expanding that bottle.
[1:59:32] And he said they bounced out of that
[1:59:34] upper room and and they were speaking
[1:59:37] heaven's language for they were filled
[1:59:39] with heaven's atmosphere. And when one
[1:59:41] of those battles passed by, a crippled
[1:59:43] man in the gate called beautiful. Just a
[1:59:46] touch of that new wine brought healing.
[1:59:48] And that man leaped to his feet praising
[1:59:51] God. Hallelujah. I I want you to get it,
[1:59:55] church. If it gets a hold of you, it'll
[1:59:58] bounce right in your life. It'll bounce
[2:00:01] you right out of sin, out of habits of
[2:00:03] the world. Amen. It will not be a
[2:00:06] reformation. It'll be a transformation
[2:00:09] of the power of the living God.
[2:00:14] Hallelujah. It won't be an intellectual
[2:00:16] revival. It'll be a spiritual renewing.
[2:00:20] It'll be joy unspeakable
[2:00:23] and full of glory.
[2:00:28] God's message and God's order has not
[2:00:32] changed.
[2:00:36] The power is the
[2:00:38] same, but he will not pour out living
[2:00:41] wine into a lifeless form.
[2:00:45] He's looking for new bottles,
[2:00:48] hearts that still have oil that can
[2:00:49] move, that can grow, can
[2:00:51] receive. And when the word and the
[2:00:54] spirit meet in such a vessel. The result
[2:00:56] is power and healing, deliverance. And
[2:00:59] let me tell you, joy unspeakable
[2:01:02] and full of glory.
[2:01:04] So I'm telling you, if you just been
[2:01:06] living in an old fried
[2:01:09] skin, trapped in religion or drained by
[2:01:12] tradition, I'm telling you, exchange it.
[2:01:17] Amen. You know, we got a system with our
[2:01:19] propane bottles over here. You know,
[2:01:21] when when you When you get it and it
[2:01:24] gets all run down and it has no more
[2:01:27] power or life in it anymore and it's all
[2:01:30] been used up, what do you do? You just
[2:01:32] exchange it for a new bottle. I'm
[2:01:35] telling you, we need a a bottle exchange
[2:01:37] this morning where we get rid of the old
[2:01:40] fra. Amen. Let the Holy Spirit come be
[2:01:43] alive in the church. Be powerful in the
[2:01:46] church. Transforming power changing us
[2:01:50] from glory to glory.
[2:01:54] Hallelujah. Cuz when he finds a vessel
[2:01:57] that is ready,
[2:01:59] Amen. then goes to the wine and the
[2:02:02] vessel will be preserved for the
[2:02:04] master's
[2:02:06] use. But I'm going to warn
[2:02:08] you. I'm going to warn you, just as
[2:02:11] there's two kinds of
[2:02:13] leaven, there are two kinds of wine.
[2:02:20] There are two cups being offered in this
[2:02:23] prophetic hour
[2:02:26] and every soul will drink from one or
[2:02:28] the other.
[2:02:32] There is the wine of God, the wine
[2:02:35] poured out of Pentecost, the wine that
[2:02:39] flowed from the pierced sight of Christ
[2:02:41] to the hearts of
[2:02:43] believers. This is the wine of the new
[2:02:45] covenant. It's sealed with blood. Amen.
[2:02:48] It's the spirit of truth. It's the joy
[2:02:50] of salvation. It's infilling of power.
[2:02:52] It's the life of Christ within.
[2:02:55] And this wine will intoxicate you with
[2:02:58] righteousness and fill you with with a
[2:03:00] holy boldness and sanctify you with a
[2:03:03] fire and burn sin right out of your
[2:03:05] life.
[2:03:07] It brings a joy and a peace and the
[2:03:09] authority to walk in holiness. It's a
[2:03:12] lifegiving truth revealing Christ
[2:03:15] exalting wine.
[2:03:20] But then there's another
[2:03:22] wine. It's a corrupted
[2:03:24] wine and it's
[2:03:26] seductive, intoxicating
[2:03:30] abomination. This is a wine of mystery
[2:03:32] Babylon, the great the one who
[2:03:35] rides the scarlet beast.
[2:03:38] The Bible in Revelation 17:2, "With her
[2:03:40] the kings of the earth committed
[2:03:42] fornication, and the inhabitants of the
[2:03:44] earth have been made drunk with the wine
[2:03:47] of her
[2:03:50] fornication. This wine is false
[2:03:52] doctrine. It's spiritual
[2:03:55] compromise. It's religious harlotry.
[2:03:58] It's worldly intoxication.
[2:04:01] It's the wine of deception where where
[2:04:03] truth is traded for lies and where
[2:04:06] purity is polluted for sensuality and
[2:04:09] loyalty to Christ is prostituted for
[2:04:12] power and pleasure and politics and and
[2:04:16] this this wine doesn't bring life, it
[2:04:18] brings death.
[2:04:22] For the Bible said in Revelation 18:3,
[2:04:25] "For all nations have drunk of the wine
[2:04:29] of the wrath of her
[2:04:31] fornication." Listen, folks, you're
[2:04:34] either drinking from one cup or the
[2:04:36] other. That's right. If you ain't got
[2:04:38] new wine that you're drinking, you're
[2:04:41] drinking the other wine.
[2:04:45] Oh yeah. There's only two spirits at
[2:04:47] work in the world today. That's God's
[2:04:50] Holy Spirit and the devil's spirit.
[2:04:54] And this
[2:04:55] wine, it drives nations mad.
[2:05:00] It corrupts churches. It defiles
[2:05:04] hearts. It's the wine of rebellion.
[2:05:09] So, well, I hadn't yielded to God yet.
[2:05:11] Rebellion.
[2:05:14] Come on. Oh, yeah. Why? Rebellion
[2:05:17] against the word. The word tells you
[2:05:19] what to do. Repent. That's right. Turn
[2:05:22] from
[2:05:24] Amen. It's a wine of self-exaltation.
[2:05:27] You know, my own desire, well, I I want
[2:05:30] to do this.
[2:05:32] You see, of counterfeit religion, of a
[2:05:35] religion that just let you live any kind
[2:05:37] of way
[2:05:39] and be a church
[2:05:41] member is an
[2:05:44] antichrist,
[2:05:45] anti-holiness, anti-truth.
[2:05:51] I'm asking you, the wine of God or the
[2:05:54] wine of
[2:05:56] Babylon, the cup of communion or the cup
[2:05:59] of
[2:06:00] confusion? The spirit of truth or the
[2:06:03] spirit of seduction?
[2:06:06] Are you with me? Amen. Amen. One cup
[2:06:09] leads to eternal life. The only the and
[2:06:11] only one cup will fill you with the joy
[2:06:13] of the Lord. Only one cup. The other
[2:06:16] ends the destruction, judgment, and the
[2:06:19] fire.
[2:06:22] And the Bible calls it, and you have
[2:06:24] heard the call. Many of you sitting here
[2:06:27] today, you have heard the call. Said,
[2:06:28] "Come out of her, my people."
[2:06:32] Well, you said, "But I come out of
[2:06:34] denomination, brother Tim." More than
[2:06:36] that, come out of that sin. Come out of
[2:06:39] that unbelief. Leave it behind.
[2:06:48] Be filled with a new wine from above and
[2:06:50] receive you the Holy Ghost. Be drunk on
[2:06:52] the spirit. Let the fire of God consume
[2:06:56] every false
[2:07:00] cup.
[2:07:03] Yes. And I want you to see
[2:07:06] something. God gives a warning.
[2:07:10] God, the lamb, the lamb himself. We love
[2:07:14] to talk about the lamb opening the
[2:07:17] seals. We love to talk about him being
[2:07:21] the
[2:07:22] redeemer. But I want you to understand
[2:07:24] there's a cry that comes from the midst
[2:07:26] of the throne found in Revelation 6 and
[2:07:29] verse six. And listen to it. And I heard
[2:07:33] a voice in the midst of the four beasts.
[2:07:38] Now, not from the four beasts, but from
[2:07:41] the midst of the four beasts, say, a
[2:07:43] measure of wheat for a penny, and a
[2:07:46] three measures of barley for a penny,
[2:07:49] and see that thou hurt not the oil and
[2:07:53] the wine. What the Holy Spirit gives a
[2:07:57] warning to us in this last day. Whatever
[2:08:00] you do, That's right.
[2:08:03] Don't stop the oil and
[2:08:07] don't it.
[2:08:10] This is a lamb himself speaking out from
[2:08:14] the throne. And he gives a warning. The
[2:08:17] voice is speaking. As I said, not just
[2:08:19] any voice. It's the lamb himself
[2:08:21] speaking. Not one of the four beasts,
[2:08:23] not an angel, but the lamb, the
[2:08:25] redeemer, the one seated in the center
[2:08:27] of it all.
[2:08:29] And he speaks to that rider on that
[2:08:31] black
[2:08:34] horse. Stop just for a minute.
[2:08:39] Where are
[2:08:40] we? I want to tell you, the pale horse
[2:08:43] has not began to ride
[2:08:45] yet. It doesn't ride until the bride
[2:08:48] leaves.
[2:08:52] Oh yes, we can see changes. We can see
[2:08:54] the winds have changed and we can see
[2:08:56] how it's changing and whatever, but
[2:08:58] right now it's still the black horse
[2:09:01] riding.
[2:09:03] Did you know that?
[2:09:07] The last one will be an amalgamation of
[2:09:11] a combination of all the other colors,
[2:09:13] the red, the white, the black, all
[2:09:16] together as a pale. Not any certain
[2:09:19] color, but a combination of them all.
[2:09:22] So, it'll be it'll be the Antichrist is
[2:09:25] impersonator.
[2:09:27] Starting out as the white, it'll be with
[2:09:29] blood, with persecution, and it'll be
[2:09:33] with black.
[2:09:40] darkness just before when the bride goes
[2:09:43] up then he becomes in his full ride as
[2:09:47] the
[2:09:48] pale. Right now we know there's a change
[2:09:51] being made because the fourth living
[2:09:53] creature the eagle has already said come
[2:09:55] and see.
[2:09:58] So, we're in that in that moment where
[2:10:01] it's changing but not
[2:10:03] changed. So, it's still the black horse
[2:10:06] riding. And I want you to understand
[2:10:08] when he comes here, he comes and what
[2:10:12] does he do? He he is trying to hold back
[2:10:16] and sell the the the bread that measure
[2:10:20] wheat for penny and measure barley. But
[2:10:24] listen, the one from the throne says,
[2:10:27] "But don't you hurt the oil and wine.
[2:10:31] It's going to be necessary for the
[2:10:34] harvest feast.
[2:10:36] It's going to have to be there for
[2:10:38] rapture.
[2:10:43] So now he speaks to that rider on the
[2:10:46] black horse which represents spiritual
[2:10:50] famine and religious corruption through
[2:10:52] the dark ages. What does he say? Don't
[2:10:55] you touch see that you don't touch the
[2:11:00] oil and
[2:11:01] wine. You see what's happening today?
[2:11:05] They don't care how revelated you are.
[2:11:07] You can preach mystery truths all you
[2:11:09] want to, but if somebody shouts in the
[2:11:11] spirit,
[2:11:13] if somebody would dare speak in other
[2:11:14] tongues,
[2:11:16] if someone dare with if a church would
[2:11:18] dare exhibit the joy of the Lord,
[2:11:23] what happens? The enemy wants to try to
[2:11:26] touch it. God said, "Don't touch it.
[2:11:28] Don't you touch it. It's going to be
[2:11:30] here. I'm going to have a people in this
[2:11:32] last day that are going to have the
[2:11:34] spirit moving in it." That's right. Come
[2:11:37] on, babe. Don't you touch something like
[2:11:38] hurt not the oil and the wine.
[2:11:45] Watch. In other words, you can go out
[2:11:48] and pedal your lifeless
[2:11:51] doctrine. It's that you know, you want
[2:11:53] to do that, go ahead. You know, you want
[2:11:56] to measure out your creeds and tradition
[2:11:58] and your dead ritualistic religion
[2:12:01] without emotion.
[2:12:04] Hello
[2:12:05] Amen. It's dead.
[2:12:08] Your prophet told you it was and I Yeah,
[2:12:10] you'll pay for it. But when you come
[2:12:13] across my wine and oil, you keep your
[2:12:16] hands off of it. Don't you hurt it.
[2:12:19] Don't you defile it. It's mine.
[2:12:26] This is very straight.
[2:12:30] Yeah. He's saying, "If you happen to
[2:12:32] catch some of my little flock, those is
[2:12:34] filled with my oil, the Holy Ghost, and
[2:12:36] my wine, and the joy and revelation on
[2:12:39] my word. Don't force them to say a Hail
[2:12:42] Mary.
[2:12:44] Don't chain them to your dogma. Don't
[2:12:47] entangle them in some lifeless system.
[2:12:49] Don't take the power out of their
[2:12:51] worship. Somebody help me preach.
[2:12:54] Everybody say, "They belong to me. They
[2:12:56] know who they are. They know where
[2:12:57] they're going. They're anointed and
[2:12:59] they're walking the joy of my promise.
[2:13:01] And I'll raise them up again. Amen.
[2:13:04] Amen. Amen. So, what does oil and wine
[2:13:09] represent? The oil is the Holy Ghost,
[2:13:11] the anointing, the life of God, the
[2:13:13] believer. The wine is the stimulation
[2:13:16] that comes by revelation. Now, I'm going
[2:13:18] to tell you, there's a lot of people
[2:13:20] calling things revelation. And I know
[2:13:22] it's not. It's intellectual knowledge
[2:13:24] because it don't have no fizz in it.
[2:13:27] There you go.
[2:13:29] Come on. Amen. There's no power behind
[2:13:31] it. And had to give classes in
[2:13:34] psychology to get rid of pornography out
[2:13:36] of out of the young men and women. Shame
[2:13:38] on them. That's right. Amen. When the
[2:13:41] wine of the Holy Ghost would give them
[2:13:43] that satisfied portion and you wouldn't
[2:13:45] even want that anymore.
[2:13:48] Your desires are heavenly. That's right.
[2:13:53] So the oil is the Holy Ghost, the
[2:13:55] anointing, the life of God, the
[2:13:57] believer, the wine is the simulation by
[2:13:59] revelation, the joy, the power, the
[2:14:01] overflowing praise that erupts when the
[2:14:04] spirit quickens the word.
[2:14:09] Amen. You know that writer, he could
[2:14:12] sell wheat and barley, natural
[2:14:14] substance, symbols of religious
[2:14:16] teachings that are void of the spirit.
[2:14:20] But the spiritual oil and wine was
[2:14:22] forbidden territory.
[2:14:24] Don't you touch that.
[2:14:27] The Catholic Church in that age began
[2:14:30] selling salvation,
[2:14:32] charging for repentance, offering
[2:14:35] prayers for money, charging for what
[2:14:37] Jesus gave freely
[2:14:40] through, you know, they were selling
[2:14:42] obedience, they charging for masses,
[2:14:44] they were trying to buy spiritual life,
[2:14:47] but the lamb drew the line.
[2:14:50] Amen. You can traffic your lifeless
[2:14:53] religion all you want to, but don't you
[2:14:55] touch my spiritfilled ones. Don't you
[2:14:58] temper with that real joy and the
[2:15:00] anointing of the Lord. Don't you touch
[2:15:02] it. Don't you take the shot of the king
[2:15:05] from the midst that belongs to me. This
[2:15:08] is my offering. And with my offering of
[2:15:12] bread is going to be wine and oil.
[2:15:19] the power of revelation and the joy of
[2:15:23] wine. When the promised word is revealed
[2:15:26] to the believer who is filled with the
[2:15:28] oil of the spirit, something explodes on
[2:15:31] the inside.
[2:15:33] Revelation brings stimulation.
[2:15:37] Just like wine affects natural men,
[2:15:40] revelation energizes the spiritual man.
[2:15:43] Amen. That's why I said it's not. It's
[2:15:46] just carnal
[2:15:47] interpretations. It's just lifeless
[2:15:49] theology.
[2:15:51] It's dead. Come on. It's dead. Dead dead
[2:15:55] men give out dead sermons and dead
[2:15:57] sermons kill.
[2:15:59] Come on. Amen. Exactly right. But when
[2:16:02] when a believer who filled with oil,
[2:16:05] Amen. receives a promised word revealed
[2:16:08] to him, something explodes. Revelation
[2:16:11] brings stimulation.
[2:16:14] Just like wine affects the natural man,
[2:16:16] revelation energizes the spiritual man.
[2:16:21] That's what happened in Acts
[2:16:23] two. They waited in the upper room until
[2:16:25] the Holy Ghost came until the fire fell.
[2:16:27] When the promised word was
[2:16:31] vindicated now, and when that happened,
[2:16:35] joy burst like a river. And they weren't
[2:16:39] drunk. as the world suppose they were
[2:16:42] under the influence of divine
[2:16:45] stimulation because God had revealed
[2:16:48] mystery truths to them and poured it in
[2:16:51] their heart. When that happened, Peter
[2:16:54] said, "This is that." You see, that
[2:16:57] revelation turned fearful men into into
[2:17:01] bold witnesses. It lit a fire that the
[2:17:04] world cannot extinguish.
[2:17:09] the stimulation of revelation. Let me
[2:17:11] tell you, when David got a glimpse of
[2:17:13] it, he got a glimpse of the revelation
[2:17:16] of the
[2:17:17] resurrection, his cup overflowed
[2:17:20] because he saw the promise of life
[2:17:22] beyond the grave. He said, "You'll not
[2:17:24] leave my soul in hell. Neither will you
[2:17:26] let my holy one see corruption." And his
[2:17:28] heart rejoiced. And again in in 2 Samuel
[2:17:32] 6, when David saw the ark, the word
[2:17:35] returning to Israel, he couldn't contain
[2:17:37] himself.
[2:17:39] Amen. Oh no. He danced. He rejoiced
[2:17:42] because the word was being restored.
[2:17:47] Amen. How do you know the word's being
[2:17:49] restored? Watch the actions of the
[2:17:52] people.
[2:17:55] Hallelujah. Amen. And you say, "Well,
[2:17:57] brother Tim, the first time they danced
[2:18:00] and whatever." Yeah, they because they
[2:18:02] brought it on an ox cart the way the
[2:18:04] denominations had done it. But when it
[2:18:06] was brought on the shoulders of the
[2:18:08] priest like the word said and the word
[2:18:10] kill was restored properly. Amen. They
[2:18:12] danced in the spirit, they shouted, they
[2:18:15] rejoiced. Why? Because the word was
[2:18:18] coming back.
[2:18:20] And you tell me we can't rejoice because
[2:18:22] the word has been revealed.
[2:18:27] You see, that's what happens when the
[2:18:28] true word is revealed and vindicated.
[2:18:31] The believer gets stimulated with joy.
[2:18:34] It's new wine. It's not tradition. Is
[2:18:36] not intellect, but it's the living word
[2:18:39] exploding in the
[2:18:41] soul. Amen.
[2:18:44] Now, as we look at this, I want just
[2:18:48] just to sum it up by saying, don't touch
[2:18:54] the oil and the wine. It belongs to the
[2:18:57] lamb. He paid the price. He poured it
[2:19:01] out and now it lives in his bride.
[2:19:05] Now I want to go back now for a moment
[2:19:08] as we conclude this
[2:19:10] message that these two loaves what they
[2:19:14] represent to us. As I said they
[2:19:17] represent the gentile bride the
[2:19:21] overcomers who receive the full
[2:19:24] revelation of the word in this hour. And
[2:19:26] they also represent now here it is
[2:19:30] here's a mystery for the last day. You
[2:19:33] remember mystery in that
[2:19:35] day. The mystery in that day was that
[2:19:38] there was going to be the Gentiles.
[2:19:42] The mystery in this day, we know
[2:19:45] Gentiles are going to be saved. That's
[2:19:47] no mystery. We've been knowing that for
[2:19:49] 2,000 years, seven church ages.
[2:19:52] But now, what's the mystery? The Jews
[2:19:56] are going to be brought back in.
[2:20:00] Oh yeah.
[2:20:01] Oh yeah. They're part of the waving in
[2:20:05] the last day
[2:20:07] because they're part of the end time
[2:20:09] harvest.
[2:20:13] I want you to get it. I want you to see
[2:20:14] the whole picture now because the Jewish
[2:20:18] remnant, the 144,000 are
[2:20:22] sealed by the Holy Ghost
[2:20:26] in the time of Jacob's trouble in the
[2:20:29] tribulation period.
[2:20:33] Now turn with me to Revelation 7 verse
[2:20:36] one. I want you to see this
[2:20:38] slow. We know the
[2:20:43] Gentile. And after these things I saw
[2:20:47] four angels standing at the four corners
[2:20:48] of the earth, holding the four winds of
[2:20:50] the earth, that the wind should not blow
[2:20:53] on the earth, nor the sea, nor on any
[2:20:55] tree. These are winds. These are wars of
[2:20:58] strife.
[2:21:00] And he holds it back and said, you know,
[2:21:03] don't destroy the
[2:21:04] world
[2:21:06] until something happens. And I saw
[2:21:09] another angel ascended from the east
[2:21:11] having the seal of the living God. And
[2:21:13] he cried with a loud voice to the four
[2:21:15] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[2:21:17] earth and the sea, saying, "Hurt not the
[2:21:18] earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
[2:21:21] till we have sealed,"
[2:21:24] the servants of our God in their
[2:21:26] foreheads,
[2:21:28] and I heard number them which were
[2:21:30] sealed, because all Israel is not
[2:21:32] Israel,
[2:21:34] and all of them are, you know, every Jew
[2:21:36] that goes over there to the promised
[2:21:38] land says, "I'm I'm a I'm I'm a Jew." is
[2:21:40] not going to be there. is an elect.
[2:21:44] Amen. And I heard the number of them
[2:21:47] which were sealed. And that was sealed
[2:21:51] 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[2:21:54] children of Israel. 12,000 out of 12
[2:21:56] tribes.
[2:21:59] Now go to chapter 14 verse one. And I
[2:22:02] looked, and lo, a lamb stood on Mount
[2:22:06] Zion. Oh, I thought the work of the lamb
[2:22:08] was over. No, the lamb still continued.
[2:22:11] That's right. But now redemption is for
[2:22:14] the second loaf.
[2:22:16] And the lamb stood on Mount Zion and
[2:22:19] with him 144,000 having his father's
[2:22:23] name written in their foreheads. Now
[2:22:25] this is a great mystery in this last
[2:22:27] day. A lot of a lot of people didn't
[2:22:29] know about the restoration of Israel.
[2:22:32] They don't know of what the promise is.
[2:22:37] They think it's only for the these
[2:22:40] certain gentile people. But I heard a
[2:22:44] voice as a voice of many waters, as a
[2:22:47] voice of great thunders. I heard the
[2:22:49] voice of harpers harping with their
[2:22:51] hearts and they sung as it were a new
[2:22:54] song. Oh, this is the same thing that
[2:22:57] happened to the bride over in Revelation
[2:22:59] 5. They sing a new song before the
[2:23:01] throne and before the four beasts and
[2:23:04] the and the elders. And no man can learn
[2:23:07] that song, but the 144,000 which were
[2:23:10] redeemed from the earth.
[2:23:13] And these are they which were not
[2:23:16] defiled, watch the wording, with women,
[2:23:20] for they are
[2:23:23] virgins. These are they which follow the
[2:23:26] Lamb wheresoever he goeth. These are the
[2:23:29] redeemed from among men. What? Being
[2:23:32] what?
[2:23:34] What? First
[2:23:39] fruits unto God.
[2:23:42] So they're also first fruits
[2:23:47] unto God and to the lamb. And in their
[2:23:49] mouth was found no guile, for they are
[2:23:52] without fault before the throne of God.
[2:23:57] Now I'm just stopping just for a minute.
[2:23:58] If this is a description of them, then
[2:24:01] it's the same description of the other
[2:24:03] loaf because it'll be people who are
[2:24:05] first fruits redeemed from among men
[2:24:08] that follow the lamb wherever he goeth
[2:24:10] and their mouth is no g where they are
[2:24:12] without fault before the throne.
[2:24:15] That's you.
[2:24:18] These are virgins. Did you notice
[2:24:21] virgins in the God showing they are
[2:24:23] without sin? They are sealed with the
[2:24:26] Holy Ghost. See, they don't have leaven
[2:24:28] or seam in them. They are filled with
[2:24:30] the spirit. These is this is the Jewish
[2:24:33] loaf that God will wave in the last
[2:24:35] harvest when they receive their
[2:24:39] Pentecost.
[2:24:42] Because you you know if you look at
[2:24:44] Revelation 10, did you ever notice? I
[2:24:46] tell you what, give me Revelation 10.
[2:24:48] Give me the last verse of Revelation 10.
[2:24:51] Let me look at it right here. We all
[2:24:52] know thou must prophesy again to every
[2:24:54] nation, kindred, tongue, and people.
[2:24:56] Right? Amen. Now watch. He had just
[2:25:00] received a book from the angel. Give me
[2:25:02] Revelation
[2:25:09] 11:1. Revelation 11:1. And there was
[2:25:12] given to me a read like a rod, and the
[2:25:14] angel said, saying stood saying, "Rise
[2:25:18] and measure the temple of God and the
[2:25:21] altar, and that worship in them. And
[2:25:23] it's a certain measurement, 144,000 that
[2:25:26] are saved. Verse
[2:25:28] two, but the court which is out the
[2:25:31] temple, leave out in the measure of it,
[2:25:33] measure it not, for it's given to the
[2:25:35] Gentiles, and the holy city they shall
[2:25:37] tread under it for two months. Next
[2:25:39] verse. And I will give power to my two
[2:25:42] witnesses. What power?
[2:25:45] The same power that we got in the upper
[2:25:47] room to my two witnesses. Where are they
[2:25:50] getting it from? the angel.
[2:25:53] I'm telling you, that's why Revelation
[2:25:56] 10 is our Pentecost. And that Pentecost
[2:26:00] continues right on and it causes them to
[2:26:03] prophesy.
[2:26:05] So the same anointing that anointed a
[2:26:09] bride comes on the Jews.
[2:26:14] The same Holy Ghost.
[2:26:17] Are you watching? Now this is
[2:26:19] prophetical.
[2:26:22] Watch. It's beautiful as we look at
[2:26:25] it. 2,000 years ago, think about it.
[2:26:30] 2,000 years ago, the Jews as a
[2:26:35] nation mocked and rejected their
[2:26:37] Pentecost.
[2:26:39] Now, the Gentiles are dead.
[2:26:44] They went into tribulation for 2,000
[2:26:46] years for mocking Pentecost.
[2:26:50] These others, the Gentiles will go into
[2:26:52] tribulation, the great tribulation for
[2:26:55] mocking Pentecost,
[2:26:58] for rejecting Pentecost.
[2:27:02] The outpouring of the spirit, the
[2:27:04] stimulating wine.
[2:27:08] Watch now. I want you to get this. 2,000
[2:27:12] years ago, they mocked, rejected their
[2:27:15] Pentecost. But in this harvest
[2:27:19] season, God gathers
[2:27:22] 144,000 and seals them with the same
[2:27:26] Holy Ghost you get.
[2:27:29] And they are caught
[2:27:30] up. Listen to me. They are caught up and
[2:27:34] raptured. Do you know there's a rapture
[2:27:36] after hours? I can show you in
[2:27:38] Revelation 11, but I ain't got time to
[2:27:40] it. But in Revelation 11, when the two
[2:27:42] prophets are killed, they are raptured
[2:27:44] and caught up. Amen. And let me tell
[2:27:46] you, the the
[2:27:48] the 144,000 are in the millennium with
[2:27:52] us.
[2:27:53] And how could they get there without a
[2:27:55] rapture? That's right. Amen. So, you
[2:27:58] see, they get sealed with the same Holy
[2:28:00] Ghost you get. They're caught up.
[2:28:01] They're raptured with us. They're
[2:28:04] raptured and are with us in the
[2:28:05] millennium as attendance to the bride.
[2:28:12] that other
[2:28:13] loaf. And the same is true now of the
[2:28:17] other loaf that represents the gentile
[2:28:19] bride. The leaven in the loaf doesn't
[2:28:22] speak of corruption. It speaks of
[2:28:24] quickening life. It's a hidden
[2:28:27] influence, a divine energy, the spirit
[2:28:29] of God working within the meal until the
[2:28:32] entire church has risen with life.
[2:28:36] For the bride is not mixed with sin,
[2:28:38] church. She is a pure virgin to Christ,
[2:28:41] as I said, without spot or wrinkles.
[2:28:43] She's sealed by the Holy Ghost. She's
[2:28:45] raised by the power of the word. She's
[2:28:47] lifted into heavenly places. And so is
[2:28:50] the Jewish remnant, sealed by the same
[2:28:52] spirit, awakened by the call of the
[2:28:54] prophetic trumpets, and together they
[2:28:57] are presented before God, the final wave
[2:29:00] offering of this dispensation.
[2:29:05] So, we're here
[2:29:06] today and we're standing at the end of
[2:29:09] the seventh
[2:29:11] Sabbath and the harvest is fully ripe
[2:29:17] and the two loaves representing the
[2:29:20] Gentile bride in the Jewish remnant are
[2:29:22] being
[2:29:24] offered and we're at the climax of the
[2:29:27] ages. We're we're in a time of prophetic
[2:29:31] fulfillment.
[2:29:34] And isn't it wonderful? Isn't it
[2:29:36] wonderful to see that at the same time a
[2:29:40] gentile bride is waved as an offering of
[2:29:42] leaven bread before the Lord that God
[2:29:45] also redeems an elect out of
[2:29:50] Israel. Now go to Romans
[2:29:53] 11:25. For I would not, brethren, that
[2:29:55] you should be ignorant of this mystery.
[2:29:58] Now I want you to know this mystery. We
[2:30:01] already got the mystery of the Gentiles
[2:30:03] coming in. But let's get about this.
[2:30:05] This mystery let you but should be wise
[2:30:08] in your own conceit that blindness in
[2:30:10] part is happen to Israel until the
[2:30:13] fullness of the Gentiles has come in. So
[2:30:16] when the fullness of the Gentiles she is
[2:30:19] harvested. Amen. Then the blindness that
[2:30:22] is lifted from Israel. Watch. And so all
[2:30:25] Israel shall be saved as as it is
[2:30:28] written there shall come out of Zion to
[2:30:31] deliver and shall turn
[2:30:34] ungodliness from Jacob. And for this
[2:30:37] covenant unto them when this is my
[2:30:39] covenant unto them when I shall take
[2:30:42] away their
[2:30:48] sins. So here we stand. Here we are. and
[2:30:53] you are witnessing the reathering of
[2:30:55] Israel to her
[2:30:57] homeland. You're seeing fulfillment of
[2:30:59] prophecy all around you.
[2:31:02] We see the pope rising out of
[2:31:05] America. We see Chicago getting there
[2:31:08] the one, you know, because they rejected
[2:31:10] the voice that God sent.
[2:31:13] We we see we see the woman rising in
[2:31:16] power as it was prophesied both in the
[2:31:19] natural and also the spiritual side of
[2:31:22] it Catholicism Catholic church wormed
[2:31:25] her way into the cabinet and we see
[2:31:27] Israel in her
[2:31:29] homeland and reathered at the same time
[2:31:33] of the bride back to the word.
[2:31:39] Isn't it amazing that Right at the same
[2:31:43] time, right in the same time, right in
[2:31:47] the
[2:31:48] same
[2:31:50] decade, as an angel was
[2:31:53] appearing to a prophet for the last
[2:31:55] gentile
[2:31:57] message that Israel was reathered back
[2:32:01] to her home
[2:32:04] land because the two are united
[2:32:08] together as a waving in the last
[2:32:14] So we stand here
[2:32:16] today and I'm talking to a people that
[2:32:18] have been
[2:32:20] gathered
[2:32:23] harvested. Some of us are still being
[2:32:28] refined. My mother years ago, we don't
[2:32:31] do it no more. I guess they refined the
[2:32:35] process.
[2:32:38] My mother when she'd bake her
[2:32:40] biscuits, she'd run it into a
[2:32:47] sifter. That sifter would be
[2:32:50] shaken. And parts of
[2:32:52] grain that didn't get brown
[2:32:55] enough don't go in the
[2:33:03] bread. It don't get baked in the fire.
[2:33:08] loses
[2:33:11] out. Don't resist the
[2:33:14] grinding. Let him purify you.
[2:33:17] Let him cleanse your
[2:33:19] life. Let him let him refine you until
[2:33:23] you're refined
[2:33:26] flower filled with the Holy Ghost rising
[2:33:30] in
[2:33:32] power. You can't be flat.
[2:33:36] this
[2:33:41] offering. What cup are you drinking
[2:33:45] from? Are you drinking the wine of the
[2:33:48] Would your mind of wine is okay?
[2:33:52] intoxicating yourself with things of the
[2:33:55] world, with drunkenness, with natural
[2:33:58] wine, with
[2:33:59] alcohol, with dope, everything until it
[2:34:02] changes your mind and your visions and
[2:34:04] gives you that a false joy that only
[2:34:08] leads to death. Would you come drink of
[2:34:11] this
[2:34:12] wine? It's the wine of the Holy
[2:34:16] Ghost being poured out in this last day.
[2:34:20] How many would say, "Fill my cup, Lord.
[2:34:23] I lift it up. Let the musicians come
[2:34:25] right now. Here's my cup. I lift it up.
[2:34:30] Come and quench this thirsting of my
[2:34:32] soul.
[2:34:33] And this bread of heaven, feed
[2:34:37] me. I'm so
[2:34:39] full. Some I'm so full, Lord. I can't I
[2:34:43] want no more. Till the desire is
[2:34:46] quenched, till the need is fulfilled.
[2:34:50] Come quench the thirsting of my
[2:34:56] soul. Can I get you to stand with me
[2:34:58] just for a
[2:35:03] moment? How many say, "Lord, I I want to
[2:35:07] have my the neck of my bottle turned up
[2:35:10] to you.
[2:35:16] I want to be oiled with faith in the
[2:35:18] promise of the word.
[2:35:21] Lord, I want to be filled with the
[2:35:26] spirit. I want to be an offering to you
[2:35:28] in this last day of a bread filled with
[2:35:32] the spirit.
[2:35:35] Now today we'll come to this
[2:35:37] table and we will take of the unleavened
[2:35:41] bread because it
[2:35:43] represents Christ without sin.
[2:35:47] [Music]
[2:35:50] But in this last day, he'll wave a
[2:35:52] people who are filled with the
[2:35:56] spirit,
[2:35:57] cleansed, washed,
[2:36:02] purified. Maybe you don't understand the
[2:36:05] grinding. Oh my, I've had some grinding
[2:36:09] that just ground my heart to
[2:36:13] pieces. Hurt in ways I didn't think I
[2:36:16] could hurt.
[2:36:19] that is purging
[2:36:21] me, bringing out something in
[2:36:24] me. That
[2:36:26] wine, I want to be filled with his
[2:36:30] spirit, a new, a fresh. Come into this
[2:36:35] communion table. Today is a time of
[2:36:38] reconsecration and
[2:36:41] dedication and say, "Here I am,
[2:36:44] Lord. Here's my cup.
[2:36:48] Fill it up. Let's worship the Lord as we
[2:36:50] sing it.
[2:36:52] Oh,
