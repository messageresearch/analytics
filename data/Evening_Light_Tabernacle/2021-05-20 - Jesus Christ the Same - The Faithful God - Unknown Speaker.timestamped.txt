[30:51] amen turn to hebrews 13 and verse 8.
[31:02] amen
[31:09] jesus christ the same yesterday
[31:13] today and forever amen we'll let you be
[31:17] seated
[31:21] so we've been looking at this thought on
[31:23] jesus christ the same
[31:25] like to speak to you this evening on
[31:28] jesus christ the same the faithful god
[31:31] a faithful god the same meaning again
[31:34] identical or unchanged the same
[31:38] we're thankful that we serve a god who
[31:40] is the same
[31:42] i'm thankful that today when i woke up
[31:44] this morning that he wasn't a different
[31:46] god or had a different idea or a
[31:48] different viewpoint but
[31:49] he's still the same god and that's it
[31:51] gives us stability to a christian life
[31:53] really
[31:54] that's what gives us all of our
[31:56] stability is he's the same
[31:58] amen he's the same as we said last
[32:00] wednesday in every detail he's the same
[32:03] in every in his word what he said before
[32:06] is what he is today
[32:07] so we can look in in this word and we
[32:09] can find and we can begin to look and
[32:11] see
[32:12] as he was yesterday so he is today you
[32:15] know as he was with israel the physical
[32:17] sea
[32:18] so he is with spiritual israel the
[32:20] spiritual seed
[32:22] amen he saved himself a namesake then
[32:25] he'll save himself a namesake now he
[32:28] delivered them then he will deliver them
[32:30] now
[32:31] he healed them then he will heal now
[32:34] amen
[32:34] he was faithful then he is faithful now
[32:38] amen i want to look at deuteronomy 7 and
[32:40] verse six and
[32:42] and this scripture is one of my one of
[32:43] my favorite scriptures to read
[32:46] it says for thou art a holy people unto
[32:49] the lord thy god
[32:50] the lord thy god has chosen thee to be a
[32:54] special people
[32:55] unto himself above all people that are
[32:58] on the face of the earth
[33:00] now the lord did not set his love upon
[33:02] you nor choose you because you were more
[33:04] than number
[33:05] than any people for he were the fewest
[33:07] of all people so
[33:08] he's telling them that i didn't choose
[33:10] you because of you
[33:12] i chose you because of my heart and my
[33:14] thought towards you
[33:15] amen and and god had this thought of
[33:18] israel this thought of them before the
[33:20] foundation of the world
[33:21] and he came to them in a time that this
[33:23] seemed like they wouldn't they wasn't
[33:25] qualified to be a chosen people
[33:27] they were slaves they were bound in
[33:30] egypt they were down in egypt
[33:31] but he came them to show them love amen
[33:34] because he's faithful
[33:36] and he would tell them this he said but
[33:37] because the lord loved you
[33:39] and because he would keep the oath which
[33:41] he had sworn unto your fathers
[33:43] has the lord brought you out with a
[33:44] mighty hand and redeemed you out of the
[33:47] house of the bondman
[33:49] from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
[33:51] know therefore
[33:52] that the lord thy god he is god
[33:55] the faithful god amen the faithful god
[33:58] which keepeth covenants
[34:00] and mercy with him that he loves and
[34:03] keeps his commandments
[34:04] to a thousand generations faithful
[34:08] is not just what god does it is what god
[34:11] is faithful is being steadfast it's
[34:15] being unwavering it's being firm
[34:17] it's being constant faithful is being
[34:19] dependable
[34:21] it's being determined it's devoted it's
[34:23] committed
[34:24] he's faithful to his word therefore he
[34:27] is determined to see his word fulfilled
[34:30] he is faithful to his people therefore
[34:33] he is determined to see them saved
[34:35] oh hallelujah he's faithful to us amen
[34:38] as his
[34:39] children therefore he is determined to
[34:41] see his word fulfilled for their healing
[34:44] for their deliverance amen for
[34:46] everything that they have need of you
[34:48] say well tonight i'm sick
[34:49] well you serve a faithful god you say
[34:52] tonight i need deliverance will you
[34:53] serve a faithful god
[34:55] amen a god who is not determined to
[34:58] depend upon the earth's
[35:00] governments or the earth's atmospheres
[35:02] or the earth's
[35:03] uh the where you are or what you're in
[35:05] or what condition you're in that does
[35:07] not depe
[35:08] that has no determination on god
[35:10] whatsoever but even
[35:11] in your worst times god is faithful and
[35:14] your worst
[35:15] sickness god is faithful and your worst
[35:18] problems god is faithful amen
[35:20] so he is determined to see every
[35:23] scripture fulfilled therefore he would
[35:25] say not a dot not a tittle
[35:27] will fall to the ground but every one of
[35:29] it every part of it
[35:30] will be fulfilled so when you read your
[35:33] bible you can believe
[35:34] it's going to be fulfilled if it hasn't
[35:36] been already god is going to fulfill
[35:39] every part of his word and he would say
[35:41] this in numbers 23 and verse 19 he would
[35:44] say god
[35:45] is not a man that he would lie neither
[35:47] the son of man that he should repent
[35:49] hath he said and hath he said it and
[35:52] shall he not do it or what he has said
[35:55] he shall do or what he has spoken
[35:58] he shall make it good amen he makes
[36:01] every promise good
[36:02] and he is determined that his word will
[36:05] not
[36:06] fail but just as determined as he is to
[36:09] see his word not
[36:10] fail he's determined to see his bride
[36:13] not fail
[36:14] he's re he's determined to see that you
[36:16] not fail
[36:17] he's determined that his healing will be
[36:19] there for you
[36:20] in your time of need he has determined
[36:22] that his salvation will be there
[36:25] even when you don't know you need saving
[36:27] even when you don't know you need
[36:29] god god is still faithful amen and we
[36:32] could see it in abraham as he called him
[36:35] by election by sovereign grace and the
[36:37] covenant that he gave to abraham was
[36:39] completely and wholly unconditional
[36:43] unconditional he made it he didn't make
[36:44] any conditions at all about it and
[36:47] that's the same covenant you have
[36:48] tonight
[36:49] so your covenant is not dependent on how
[36:51] good you are
[36:52] how great you are he didn't choose you
[36:55] because you were great
[36:56] he chose you to make you great he didn't
[36:59] choose you to call it typical because
[37:01] you were worthy
[37:02] he chose you to make you worthy he
[37:04] didn't choose you because you was
[37:06] without sin he chose you that you would
[37:09] be blameless
[37:11] and so god has determined amen that
[37:13] these will be fulfilled in man god
[37:16] is determined to save man
[37:20] that makes me want to shout because in
[37:22] the darkest hour there's ever been
[37:24] god has not lost that determination god
[37:27] is still determined
[37:29] as he's ever been to save somebody he's
[37:31] still determined as he's ever been to
[37:33] heal somebody
[37:34] he's still determined as he's ever been
[37:36] to lift them up out of the mirror clay
[37:39] and to put them upon a rock god is still
[37:41] determined
[37:44] but there's been you know two covenants
[37:46] one was given to abraham
[37:48] or to adam if you will i will and it was
[37:51] broke
[37:52] but the abrahamic covenant was given to
[37:55] abraham and it was not
[37:56] if you will i will it was i have i've
[38:00] already done it
[38:01] i i have done it not i will do i have
[38:04] done it
[38:05] god is determined to save man therefore
[38:08] he made a covenant
[38:09] if you will i will he broke it but he
[38:12] come around
[38:13] and said it's not what you do it's what
[38:16] i've already done
[38:17] man can't keep his covenant but god will
[38:20] always keep his covenant
[38:22] man cannot keep his promises we can see
[38:25] that how many promises have been
[38:27] broken even today amen man cannot keep
[38:30] them but god has never broken promise
[38:33] even dealing with israel and he would
[38:35] tell them if you don't
[38:37] heed the word of god and you'll you'll
[38:39] go into slave go right back to where you
[38:41] came from
[38:42] and that's exactly what he would say but
[38:44] he said i will bring you out again
[38:46] and that's exactly what he did and he
[38:48] kept over and over
[38:50] why because he was determined to have a
[38:52] seed
[38:53] he was determined to have a people he
[38:56] was determined to have sons and
[38:58] daughters
[38:58] amen but how much more if he was
[39:00] determined over the physical seed
[39:02] how much more is he determined over the
[39:04] spiritual seed of abraham
[39:06] i am determined to have children i am
[39:08] determined to have sons
[39:10] i am determined to have daughters and
[39:12] the devil can do what he wants to
[39:14] but my word will not fail
[39:16] [Music]
[39:20] man can't keep a covenant but god keeps
[39:23] his every time
[39:25] man can't keep his promises but god
[39:28] keeps it every time
[39:31] amen it's it isn't because you do
[39:34] something it's because
[39:35] god did something amen you're not here
[39:37] tonight because you did something
[39:39] you're here tonight because god did
[39:41] something you're not
[39:42] saved tonight because you did something
[39:44] you're saved tonight because god did
[39:46] something
[39:47] amen it isn't it's not that you chose
[39:50] god
[39:50] it's god chose you
[39:54] hallelujah amen you know even god is
[39:56] determined listen to this
[39:58] this is another determination of god he
[40:00] said when invitations was given
[40:02] at the marriage there the parable in the
[40:04] in the new testament
[40:06] excuses were made and back they come and
[40:08] said well they won't come this one done
[40:10] that this one got that
[40:11] he said listen at the last time he sent
[40:14] them out he said go to the hedges
[40:16] and the highways and the byways get the
[40:19] lame the halt the blind
[40:20] and compel them to come he said why did
[40:23] god do that
[40:24] for god is determined that his table
[40:26] will be
[40:27] set and there will be somebody there
[40:32] oh hallelujah god wants his table full
[40:37] therefore he's determined whatever i've
[40:39] got to do i'm going to have somebody
[40:41] there
[40:42] i if i got to get them from the highways
[40:44] if i got to go to the byways
[40:46] if i got to go to the lowest to the
[40:48] lowest wherever i've got to go
[40:51] i am determined that my word will not
[40:53] fail
[40:58] we ought to be thankful tonight we have
[41:00] a god who's determined
[41:02] where would you be if he wasn't
[41:03] determined amen if he was just
[41:06] not determined to save you and the first
[41:09] slip up you made
[41:10] or the second or the tenth or however
[41:12] many chances you got
[41:13] amen he could have just gave up on you
[41:15] and walked away and said well
[41:17] i'll find me somebody else but god was
[41:19] determined
[41:20] and he said i'll do whatever i got to
[41:22] because that is my son
[41:24] there that is my daughter there i'll
[41:26] defeat every devil
[41:28] i'll break every barrier i'll tear down
[41:31] every stronghold
[41:32] whatever i got to do that's my son
[41:37] i'm tonight thankful that god is
[41:39] determined
[41:44] he said my i said god's people acts many
[41:47] times odd and peculiar no way they act
[41:49] strange
[41:51] why because they're not tied up with
[41:52] affairs of this world
[41:54] they're dead and buried in christ and
[41:56] raised up a new life to be the first
[41:57] fruits of them
[41:58] that enjoy the spiritual resurrection he
[42:01] said that's the holy spirit
[42:03] would flow through every member and
[42:04] would show forth the glory of god like
[42:06] god showed egypt
[42:07] when he brought the vine out he said but
[42:09] there is a wild vine now just bear with
[42:11] me for a second
[42:12] he said there is a wild vine the bible
[42:14] speaks of it in
[42:16] second kings about remember the story
[42:17] about the pottage and they wouldn't
[42:19] gathered it out and there was death in
[42:20] the pot
[42:21] he said but brother there is a wild vine
[42:23] growing it grows around creeds and
[42:26] denominationals
[42:27] denominational spirits he said when it
[42:29] gets out there
[42:30] it shuts off all the spiritual joy and
[42:33] the first thing you know that vine is
[42:34] dead
[42:36] but god is determined that his vine
[42:41] won't die oh hallelujah
[42:45] he showed his determination all the way
[42:47] down to the dark ages
[42:50] the vine that started there and it went
[42:52] through jesus to the life of
[42:54] uh and it broke out in the holy ghost of
[42:56] the day of pentecost
[42:57] went to the disciples and then down to
[42:59] the second age and the third age and it
[43:01] looks like the devil's doing everything
[43:03] he can to put it out
[43:04] and bringing up the ecclesiastical moves
[43:07] and
[43:07] all the things that were taking place
[43:09] and the and the and the
[43:11] outright trying to put the light out
[43:14] but god was determined
[43:18] hallelujah and god's determined to have
[43:20] church tonight whether you want to or
[43:22] not
[43:23] amen god is determined to go beyond our
[43:27] darkness
[43:27] to go beyond our fears to go beyond the
[43:30] things that we're going through
[43:32] all the things god is determined to
[43:34] break through
[43:35] he said i will have a church
[43:38] i will have a vine
[43:43] the devil can try to put creeds the
[43:45] devil can try to put dominance upon it
[43:48] but what does god do he fills it with
[43:49] the holy ghost
[43:51] amen and it comes down in jesus christ's
[43:54] name
[43:54] and that church begins to pulsate why
[43:57] because he's faithful
[43:59] it begins to feel the presence of the
[44:01] living god why
[44:03] he's faithful it begins to watch him
[44:05] move and heal the sick why
[44:07] because he's faithful oh hallelujah
[44:11] praise the lord psalms 37
[44:14] 23 says it like this it says the steps
[44:17] of a good man or a righteous man
[44:20] are ordered by the lord
[44:23] in other words he's not going to tell
[44:25] you what to do and then leave you to it
[44:29] if you would if you look into this it's
[44:30] ordered by the lord in other words
[44:32] the lord's going to go with you in your
[44:34] steps
[44:36] and he delighteth in his way and though
[44:39] he
[44:39] fall he shall not be utterly cast down
[44:43] oh hallelujah that's not the end of the
[44:45] story
[44:46] because god's determined and god's
[44:49] faithful and the lord upholdeth him with
[44:52] his hand
[44:53] he says i've been young and now i'm old
[44:55] yet i've never seen the righteous
[44:57] forsaken
[44:58] nor seed begging bed why because god
[45:01] is faithful he is ever merciful
[45:05] and lendeth and his seed is blessed why
[45:08] because god is faithful
[45:19] hebrews 11 11 says it like this and
[45:22] here's a key to this
[45:25] through faith also sarah herself
[45:28] received strength
[45:29] to concede seed and was delivered of a
[45:33] child when she was past
[45:34] age why because she
[45:38] judged him faithful
[45:41] not herself faithful not herself any
[45:44] good well i've been doing pretty good
[45:47] i've listened to so many tapes i've read
[45:48] my
[45:49] that's not what it's all about yes part
[45:51] of it but that's not what it's all about
[45:53] it's judging him faithful he made the
[45:55] promise he'll bring it to pass
[45:58] hallelujah he promised healing to my
[46:00] body it wasn't i promise that he
[46:02] promised it
[46:03] it wasn't a preacher promise that he
[46:05] promised it it wasn't
[46:06] it wasn't a pope that promised it or
[46:08] even a prophet that promised it
[46:10] he promised it
[46:13] so therefore you got to take your eyes
[46:15] off of your in your humanity
[46:17] and what you've done wrong and what you
[46:19] said and how you
[46:21] laughed laughed when he said
[46:25] he was going to have a child and he said
[46:27] there's nowhere it could be me
[46:28] but god was determined he said i'm going
[46:31] to have a son
[46:33] i'm going to it's going to come through
[46:34] abraham and it's going to come through
[46:36] sarah and it does not matter about it if
[46:38] she laughs
[46:39] i'm still going to have it and she began
[46:42] to turn her eyes off of her
[46:44] in insignificant things and her humanity
[46:48] and her spirit that she was all
[46:50] the mood that was she in and she began
[46:52] to look at him
[46:54] she said that god's faithful
[46:59] it's time some of you get your eyes off
[47:01] your own humanity
[47:03] or the humanity around you or or the
[47:06] other world around you and the things
[47:08] around you and the spirits around
[47:10] you and the chaos around you and the
[47:12] atmospheres around you
[47:13] and the problems around you and this all
[47:15] the situations that seemingly
[47:17] are unending around you and get your
[47:20] eyes and start looking to him
[47:23] and say he's faithful how many can say
[47:27] that tonight
[47:28] how many can say lord i judge you
[47:30] faithful this judge
[47:32] is actually i i steam him i put him in
[47:35] the place he belongs
[47:36] that he's faithful i i consider him
[47:39] faithful
[47:40] even when i haven't been faithful he's
[47:42] faithful
[47:44] hallelujah even when i've been in my
[47:46] doubt he's still faithful
[47:49] even when i've been in my fear and wear
[47:50] worry he's still faithful
[47:52] even when i've been thinking about
[47:54] quitting he's still faithful
[47:56] [Applause]
[48:01] and from that they're spraying they're
[48:03] even one
[48:04] and him as good as dead so many as the
[48:07] stars of the sky
[48:08] and multitude as the sand which is by
[48:10] the seashore
[48:11] innumerable
[48:15] he said he got scripture for that
[48:16] brother timothy that when we're not
[48:17] faithful he is faithful yep dear
[48:19] second timothy 2 and verse 13.
[48:23] if we believe not
[48:26] yet he abideth faithful
[48:32] hallelujah or that's what i mean if we
[48:34] believe not or
[48:36] if we are faithless he
[48:39] abideth faithful he cannot
[48:43] deny himself oh hallelujah
[48:48] so even when you're not even faithful
[48:51] and you're faithless
[48:52] and you can't even believe the promises
[48:54] for yourself
[48:55] he's still faithful even when you cannot
[48:58] grasp a hold of it and give it for your
[49:01] own he's still faithful
[49:05] even when it seems like it escapes you
[49:08] every time
[49:08] and it's been year after year month
[49:11] after month day after day however long
[49:13] it's been
[49:13] you've been in this battle you've been
[49:15] anything i'm just losing faith i'm
[49:17] giving up
[49:18] he's still faithful
[49:20] [Applause]
[49:21] he's not removed himself from your
[49:23] battle he's still in the middle of it
[49:25] he's not removed himself from your steps
[49:28] he's ordered your steps
[49:30] he's brought you to this place to show
[49:32] you i
[49:33] am faithful
[49:34] [Applause]
[49:39] he cannot deny himself
[49:43] he said well brother timothy i got sin
[49:46] what about my sin okay
[49:48] first john 1 9 if we confess our sins
[49:53] he is faithful
[49:56] and just to forgive us our sins
[49:59] and to cleanse us from all
[50:02] unrighteousness
[50:06] jesus christ the same the faithful god
[50:10] he would show himself faithful all the
[50:12] way through the old testament i mean
[50:13] go try to find out where he wasn't
[50:15] faithful
[50:17] try to find out where he wasn't there
[50:19] when they had need of him they called on
[50:21] him and they
[50:21] asked him to forgive their sins and he
[50:23] forgive them mercy after mercy after
[50:25] mercy extended
[50:28] and that's why paul would even speak it
[50:30] be able to pick it up and he said we
[50:31] serve a god
[50:32] who's rich in mercy why because he could
[50:35] look at all the mercy that that god
[50:37] the great jehovah had given the children
[50:40] of israel
[50:41] and it brought them through all kind of
[50:42] things and they would forsake him and
[50:44] they would serve other gods and
[50:46] he would he would let the enemy come and
[50:48] they would cry out god forgive us
[50:49] and his mercy he was still faithful
[50:52] he was still calm and he would still
[50:54] move on the scene
[50:55] and break down the bars and the walls
[50:58] and set his people free
[50:59] and they'd go right back again and do
[51:01] the same thing and he would do it all
[51:03] over again
[51:05] why because he was faithful
[51:10] that's why even now i still have hope
[51:12] for those that have walked away
[51:13] from him that i know god's still
[51:15] faithful
[51:18] all i got to say is god i'm sorry and
[51:20] god to be there for them
[51:23] because he's faithful
[51:26] he showed himself all the way through
[51:29] the old testament
[51:31] time after time after time after time a
[51:34] faithful god
[51:36] he would show it in abraham's life when
[51:38] abraham would be put to the test and he
[51:39] would be sent up there
[51:41] on the mountain to sacrifice his son and
[51:44] he went
[51:45] he just went according to god's word
[51:46] because he knew god made the promise
[51:48] and there he judged him faithful he's
[51:50] like hey if god told me to take my son
[51:52] he must have a plan
[51:54] he's going to raise him up again because
[51:56] he said through this side
[51:57] through isaac my seed shall be and so he
[51:59] takes him upon a mountain to sacrifice
[52:01] him
[52:02] but god was looking at abraham and when
[52:04] he went to draw back the sword he said
[52:06] abraham
[52:07] it's not what you will i will
[52:10] and he had a lamb a ram over in the bush
[52:12] why because god was faithful
[52:15] amen god would come time after time
[52:18] noah's life he was faithful
[52:21] [Music]
[52:22] noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
[52:24] and god showed faithfulness to noah
[52:26] and his whole household to get him out
[52:28] of the whole situation that was about to
[52:30] come upon the earth
[52:31] why because god's faithful we heard
[52:33] about his sunday about them saving
[52:35] even saving the uh israel out of egypt
[52:38] and all the things that took place
[52:39] incredible show of god's faithfulness
[52:42] god didn't lead him out of egypt to
[52:43] leave him there to die in the wilderness
[52:45] no matter how much their faithless heart
[52:48] said so
[52:53] he didn't do it he brought him out to
[52:55] show his power
[52:58] because he's faithful
[53:01] he would come all the way down why would
[53:03] david step out into the
[53:05] into the valley with a giant
[53:08] many times his size many times his
[53:11] strength
[53:12] but there administered on it so
[53:13] wonderfully here a couple wednesdays ago
[53:15] at many times his abilities
[53:18] many times and it seemed like an
[53:20] impossibility
[53:21] but david said i'll go fight him why
[53:23] because he judged his god
[53:25] faithful and he knew the same god that
[53:28] saved him from a lion and from a bear
[53:30] he was faithful in them situations he's
[53:33] not lost his faithfulness today
[53:36] right we can see him all the way down
[53:39] daniel found him faithful three hebrew
[53:42] children found him faith and we got all
[53:44] kinds of examples we preached on it many
[53:46] times
[53:46] of god's faithfulness but why is it when
[53:49] we get to our situation
[53:52] we forget who he is
[53:59] and it comes in jesus christ
[54:03] in a human vessel named jesus christ
[54:06] god veiled in flesh crying as a baby in
[54:09] a manger
[54:11] skinning his knees as a teenager
[54:15] walks the shores of galilee
[54:18] why because he was faithful
[54:22] he had a seed the john 3 16
[54:25] says for god so loved the world that he
[54:28] gave his only begotten son why
[54:30] because he's faithful he wants to see
[54:32] all flesh saved
[54:35] did you hear that that's the kind of
[54:37] merciful god we serve
[54:38] he wants to see all flesh saved
[54:46] i actually had started looking at this
[54:48] several months ago
[54:50] at his faithfulness and jesus the same
[54:54] thinking about the pool of bethesda
[54:56] thinking about that situation and we
[54:58] know
[54:59] the chosen just come out with that and i
[55:01] thought they hit some very good
[55:02] inspiration this
[55:03] this ain't even my notes but just
[55:04] thinking about it
[55:06] here jesus comes and he's trying to show
[55:09] this this man
[55:10] has been laying here for years he's been
[55:13] in this condition for years
[55:15] and he's lost faith where all he now has
[55:20] excuses why god has it done or why he
[55:23] can't get to this pool or
[55:24] why why nobody will take me nobody when
[55:27] i try to move somebody steps on me
[55:29] and all these excuses and that's what
[55:31] happens when we get into battle or we're
[55:33] getting
[55:33] something that lasts a long time
[55:36] and we get to the points in our lives
[55:38] and we get to say
[55:42] and we begin to doubt not just us
[55:46] we begin to doubt him
[55:49] and here he came down and he asked the
[55:51] man do you want to be healed
[55:53] or will thou be made whole do you want
[55:55] to be healed
[55:57] and the man starts giving him all of
[55:59] excuses and so that's not what i'm
[56:00] asking you
[56:02] i'm asking you do you want to be healed
[56:06] i'm asking you do you want to get out of
[56:08] this condition in this place
[56:11] and never come back here again
[56:14] if you'll look away from the situation
[56:16] you're in
[56:17] and the excuses and the problems and the
[56:20] sicknesses that's tormented you
[56:21] for years and years and years and you'll
[56:24] look at me
[56:25] you'll walk away from here because i am
[56:28] faithful i have the power to do this
[56:34] i have the ability to do this it's in my
[56:42] word
[56:46] and he began to look away from his
[56:47] excuses
[56:50] and he began to realize there's somebody
[56:52] else here
[56:53] this isn't somebody that just can't pick
[56:56] me up and
[56:56] and take me and dump me off in a pool
[56:59] somewhere
[57:00] this is somebody that can heal me and
[57:04] his thought process
[57:05] began to change and his look began to
[57:07] change
[57:08] and things begin to move and operate and
[57:11] what jesus said he said rise
[57:14] walk take up thy bed and walk
[57:18] i thought it was so wonderful how they
[57:20] picked up the inspiration the man said
[57:21] why
[57:22] he stood up on his feet and he said why
[57:24] is it important for me to take my
[57:26] bed and peter come and told him and said
[57:28] because the reason why you got to take
[57:30] your bed because you're not coming back
[57:31] here
[57:35] that's wonderful right there it's time
[57:38] some of you take your old beds of
[57:39] excuses and your old beds of things has
[57:42] held on to you for a long time
[57:43] rise up and walk
[57:46] judge them faithful and get out of that
[57:48] condition and say i'm not going there
[57:50] again
[57:51] i'm not going back to my complaints and
[57:53] my worries and my feelings
[57:55] i'm not looking at that i'm taking my
[57:57] bed and i'm walking out of here
[57:58] cause i'm not coming back again
[58:03] if you leave it there you'll go back
[58:06] again
[58:10] but he's faithful he expressed his
[58:14] faithfulness to the human race
[58:16] to forgive he expressed his faithfulness
[58:19] to the human race to love those who were
[58:22] unlovable
[58:26] oh we can love those who love us but he
[58:28] loved those who didn't love him
[58:30] because he was faithful he was the
[58:33] greatest representation of love that's
[58:35] ever hit the earth
[58:36] he was despised of those who lived on
[58:38] the earth to whom he loved who we come
[58:40] to love
[58:41] no man could ever love him love like him
[58:44] no man was ever hated like him they
[58:47] hated him because he was faithful
[58:50] they despised him because he was
[58:52] faithful they rejected him because he
[58:55] was faithful
[58:56] but it did not stop his love because he
[58:58] was faithful
[59:01] they laughed when he was hanging on the
[59:02] cross because he was faithful
[59:05] after that life that he had lived been
[59:07] done nothing but good things
[59:09] forgiven the guilty why because he was
[59:11] faithful healing the sick because he was
[59:13] faithful
[59:14] done things that were good and when he
[59:16] took his last breath on the cross
[59:18] they spit on him they mocked him
[59:21] they made fun of him they ripped the
[59:23] beard from him
[59:24] because he was faithful
[59:28] not because he deserved it he didn't
[59:31] deserve what he got
[59:33] he did it because he was faithful
[59:38] and he said when all of this happened
[59:41] he could have turned his head from the
[59:44] other
[59:46] he could have called 10 000 legions of
[59:48] angels
[59:50] to take him off the cross but he turned
[59:53] and looked at them
[59:54] with eyes of love
[59:58] he said father forgive them for they
[1:00:01] know now what they do
[1:00:03] why because he's faithful
[1:00:08] i can hear his voice tonight saying
[1:00:10] father forgive them for their doubt
[1:00:14] forgive them for their anxiety and their
[1:00:16] fears
[1:00:18] why because he's faithful
[1:00:21] he can understand being under being god
[1:00:24] he understands
[1:00:25] that's why he can love us when we were
[1:00:28] unlovable
[1:00:31] because he's god and he understands
[1:00:35] oh living he loved me why because he was
[1:00:39] faithful
[1:00:40] never my life lived like that it was
[1:00:42] wrapped in love
[1:00:43] dying he saved me a death like never
[1:00:46] before
[1:00:47] why because he was faithful
[1:00:53] he could he took the penalty of sin
[1:00:56] there was no one that could pay this
[1:00:58] penalty for another
[1:01:00] every man though he might die for
[1:01:01] another man but he was guilty
[1:01:03] that man was guilty to begin with but
[1:01:05] here come one that wasn't guilty
[1:01:07] and he took your sin and he took your
[1:01:10] guilt
[1:01:11] and he bore to an old rugged tree why
[1:01:14] because
[1:01:14] he's faithful hallelujah
[1:01:19] he said there was only one way for it to
[1:01:21] be paid and that was the death
[1:01:24] of god himself so god being a spirit
[1:01:27] couldn't die so he came in a body
[1:01:29] and expressed himself in a body without
[1:01:31] sin
[1:01:33] he expressed the love of god without sin
[1:01:36] he took all of the sin without sin
[1:01:40] why because he's faithful
[1:01:44] that he might take the guilt of the
[1:01:47] guilty
[1:01:49] mercy jesus all of us being sinners
[1:01:53] not a way in the world for us to be
[1:01:55] saved not in no way in the world we
[1:01:57] could come on our own
[1:01:59] we could not even come and make our own
[1:02:00] sacrifices anymore
[1:02:03] abel tried abel tried and he died others
[1:02:06] tried it and they died
[1:02:11] but here come one the faithful one
[1:02:15] the lamb of god slain before the
[1:02:17] foundation of the world
[1:02:19] come to take the place of guilty sinners
[1:02:22] mashed and bruised
[1:02:25] why because he's faithful
[1:02:29] scoffed and made fun of why because he's
[1:02:32] faithful
[1:02:34] died to death no creature could die
[1:02:36] except god himself
[1:02:37] his bloody locks hanging from his
[1:02:39] shoulders dripping to the ground
[1:02:41] express what a horrible thing that sin
[1:02:43] was and when he had to die to redeem man
[1:02:46] from the life of sin
[1:02:47] nothing else could die like that but he
[1:02:50] did it
[1:02:51] why because he's faithful
[1:02:56] he took your sins why because he's
[1:02:58] faithful
[1:03:00] he took your sickness why because he's
[1:03:02] faithful
[1:03:03] i want to keep hammered on to you
[1:03:05] tonight god is
[1:03:07] faithful he's not going to let this come
[1:03:11] down to the end of this
[1:03:12] and say i just give up and walk away no
[1:03:14] he said i'm going to have a bride
[1:03:16] without spot without wrinkle without
[1:03:18] blemish
[1:03:19] i'm going to have a table full of gas
[1:03:23] i'm going to have a people that's going
[1:03:25] to come out and be overcomers and
[1:03:27] laodicean church age
[1:03:30] therefore i'll write it in my bible
[1:03:32] because i'm that sure of it
[1:03:44] he came as a man
[1:03:48] even david would cry out 800 years
[1:03:50] before
[1:03:52] write down in the psalms my god my god
[1:03:55] why hast thou forsaken me
[1:03:58] what a terrible thing sin does
[1:04:00] separating man from god
[1:04:03] he was a sin offering that had to be
[1:04:04] offered for our suffering for our sins
[1:04:07] he was separated from the presence of
[1:04:08] god sin had separated him
[1:04:11] and god placed our sin on him
[1:04:16] and that separated him from god and
[1:04:18] that's why he cried
[1:04:20] why hast thou forsaken me he did it
[1:04:24] because he's faithful
[1:04:28] because he was forsaken and taken this
[1:04:32] place
[1:04:32] seen as people who rejected him
[1:04:35] who hated him despised him it grieved
[1:04:38] him so till he was so brokenhearted
[1:04:41] till the blood and water and chemicals
[1:04:43] of his body separated
[1:04:46] he took it man man we'll never know what
[1:04:50] that was like
[1:04:52] that's the reason there could be no one
[1:04:53] else ever die like that
[1:04:55] he said brother brown said i don't care
[1:04:56] how tormented you ever
[1:04:58] are you'll never be tormented like that
[1:05:02] he said how they might put your feet in
[1:05:04] stocks they might saw you by
[1:05:05] inches they might burn you by inches but
[1:05:08] you could not
[1:05:09] die that death because your makeup's not
[1:05:12] like that
[1:05:13] he had to be god
[1:05:16] he had to be more than a man in the
[1:05:18] makeup he died of a broken heart
[1:05:21] why because he's faithful
[1:05:26] he died with such grief why because he
[1:05:29] was faithful
[1:05:29] he died until the chemical reaction took
[1:05:32] place in his body
[1:05:33] to where he would separate water and
[1:05:35] blood why
[1:05:36] because he was faithful because he knew
[1:05:40] there was going to be somebody that was
[1:05:42] going to need it
[1:05:45] he knew there was going to be a people
[1:05:47] that was going to need those stripes for
[1:05:48] healing
[1:05:50] he knew there was going to be a people
[1:05:52] that was going to need that crown of
[1:05:53] thorns
[1:05:54] and those stripes upon his back and
[1:05:56] those nails through his hands and feet
[1:05:58] for their sins for their wrongs for
[1:06:00] their worries
[1:06:02] for their fears he knew it would be so
[1:06:04] therefore
[1:06:05] he remained faithful
[1:06:08] he remained faithful for you
[1:06:12] for me he remained faithful for ron
[1:06:15] spencer
[1:06:17] he remained faithful for brother kenny
[1:06:19] campus here tonight
[1:06:21] he remained faithful and he's not
[1:06:23] changed
[1:06:27] we serve a faithful god
[1:06:35] hanging there that precious life that
[1:06:38] knew nothing but love and doing good
[1:06:41] hanging between heaven and earth lifted
[1:06:44] up
[1:06:44] stripped naked embarrassed
[1:06:48] think how you would be stripped naked
[1:06:52] you want no embarrassment to what god
[1:06:54] would have hanging there
[1:06:59] he said i know the crucifix i have some
[1:07:00] little thing hanging there
[1:07:02] so it wasn't like that they stripped him
[1:07:07] he had a robe they tore it off and
[1:07:08] gambled before
[1:07:10] he was embarrassed to the upmost
[1:07:14] yet being god he stood
[1:07:18] and sinners spit in his face
[1:07:22] the very depths of modesty die
[1:07:25] before the public stripped naked such an
[1:07:28] effect it took on him
[1:07:30] the poet would write it like this and
[1:07:32] said men ritter
[1:07:33] mid rendering rocks and darkening skies
[1:07:35] my savior bowed his head and died
[1:07:38] but the open veil revealed the way to
[1:07:41] heaven's joys and endless days
[1:07:43] sure he had to do it the veil hung
[1:07:46] between man and god
[1:07:47] and that opening veil revealed a way to
[1:07:50] heaven's joys
[1:07:52] and endless days therefore he remained
[1:07:54] faithful
[1:07:55] therefore you could go beyond the veil
[1:07:59] you could go into that place because he
[1:08:02] was faithful
[1:08:06] calvary means something it means more
[1:08:08] than we can express
[1:08:10] that's why the poet would say it live
[1:08:12] and he loved me
[1:08:14] died he saved me buried he
[1:08:17] carried my sins far away oh
[1:08:21] it's and it said what is it sin has now
[1:08:24] been
[1:08:25] condemned why because he's faithful
[1:08:29] and therefore sin has no more hold on
[1:08:31] you
[1:08:32] why because he's faithful
[1:08:35] hallelujah sin and sickness and problems
[1:08:39] are finished how do you know they're
[1:08:42] finished because he said they was
[1:08:43] finished
[1:08:44] he screamed out it was more than just
[1:08:47] his life giving up the ghost
[1:08:48] or his life leaving his body when he's
[1:08:51] beginning to scream out
[1:08:52] in his finish
[1:08:55] it was more than speaking about his life
[1:08:57] leaving his body
[1:08:58] he knew when that life left
[1:09:01] it was going down to get those down
[1:09:04] there and then
[1:09:05] old that old grave had been buried
[1:09:07] somewhere and he's going after abraham
[1:09:09] isaac and sarah
[1:09:10] and all the patriarchs that found him
[1:09:12] faithful
[1:09:14] that judged him faithful and he knocked
[1:09:16] on the door
[1:09:17] and they began to scream here he is it's
[1:09:20] the same one i saw on the plains of
[1:09:21] memory
[1:09:22] this is the same one that revealed the
[1:09:24] secrets of my heart that's the wheel in
[1:09:26] the middle of the wheel
[1:09:27] that's the one that was in the fire with
[1:09:29] me there he is the faithful one
[1:09:32] but he didn't go down there to stay with
[1:09:34] him he go to say come on boys
[1:09:36] it's time to go home why because he was
[1:09:39] faithful
[1:09:40] therefore he knew when he said it was
[1:09:42] finished
[1:09:45] that sin's power was now broke
[1:09:49] oh hallelujah sicknesses power over a
[1:09:52] human being is now broke
[1:09:55] and it's still broke because the blood
[1:09:58] is still
[1:09:59] in effect as it's ever been therefore if
[1:10:02] it's an effect
[1:10:03] and it had healing power then and it did
[1:10:06] you can read through the book of acts in
[1:10:08] that first church age that blood had
[1:10:10] healing power
[1:10:11] it was a palsy hill it was a lame hill
[1:10:14] it was a blind hill
[1:10:15] there was every kind of sickness and
[1:10:17] halton lame healed it showed it had
[1:10:19] power there it has power now
[1:10:24] and it was at that moment cancer
[1:10:28] lost his power it was at that moment
[1:10:32] high blood pressure and sugar about
[1:10:34] diabetes and every kind of disease you
[1:10:36] want to name tonight
[1:10:37] lost its power let's just call it
[1:10:38] sickness let's just call it demons of
[1:10:41] hell
[1:10:41] they lost their power over god's people
[1:10:44] why because he's faithful
[1:10:47] he held all therefore you can now hold
[1:10:49] on
[1:10:54] so why would scream at the cross it's
[1:10:56] finished it's done
[1:10:58] sin and sickness is powerless
[1:11:01] it's lifeless he said think of that
[1:11:04] people that sin
[1:11:05] that held you for a long time is now
[1:11:08] dead
[1:11:09] and lifeless has no more effect
[1:11:13] it can't have any more effect when the
[1:11:15] blood of jesus christ is wiped over
[1:11:17] it's removed from henceforth and
[1:11:19] forevermore
[1:11:20] mercy jesus now it's dead it's buried as
[1:11:24] lifeless
[1:11:25] no more life in it that seemless lamb
[1:11:28] that knew no sin
[1:11:30] that god who knew no wrong his life
[1:11:32] given there buried
[1:11:34] he carried my sins far away but it
[1:11:37] didn't end there
[1:11:40] rising he was still faithful
[1:11:43] he justified forever oh glorious day
[1:11:48] he's moved our sins where to the sea of
[1:11:50] forgetfulness
[1:11:52] you're talking about faithfulness to
[1:11:54] where he don't even remember it no more
[1:11:58] god cannot remember it anymore because
[1:12:01] he's faithful
[1:12:03] and it's both dead and buried and it
[1:12:05] cannot even be brought back to god's
[1:12:07] memory they're out
[1:12:08] of god's memory
[1:12:11] well that ought to do something for you
[1:12:12] that devil's been trying to bring up
[1:12:14] your past
[1:12:15] remind him it's out of god's memory
[1:12:18] that's all that matters
[1:12:20] i don't care if you remember devil
[1:12:21] because your word don't matter
[1:12:25] your decree and your laws does not
[1:12:26] matter it has no jurisdiction over my
[1:12:28] life
[1:12:29] the only one who has jurisdiction over
[1:12:31] my life is jesus christ
[1:12:32] and my sins have been removed and placed
[1:12:35] in the sea of his forgetfulness and he
[1:12:37] don't remember it anymore
[1:12:38] that's all that matters hallelujah
[1:12:44] he was a lamb but he was because he was
[1:12:48] faithful
[1:12:51] he died because he was faithful
[1:12:55] he was buried because he was faithful
[1:12:58] he rose again because he was faithful
[1:13:01] but it don't end there he's coming back
[1:13:04] again
[1:13:05] because he's faithful oh hallelujah
[1:13:10] what good would have been for him to
[1:13:11] come 2000 years ago to us today
[1:13:13] if he's not coming back again for us
[1:13:15] he's coming back again for us
[1:13:18] he promised he would
[1:13:22] i think of the story of the armored girl
[1:13:25] the armored boy that went
[1:13:26] out to the west to get that girl and and
[1:13:29] she stood there
[1:13:29] on the side of the street because he
[1:13:31] told her he's going to come at a certain
[1:13:32] time
[1:13:33] and she made herself ready she got
[1:13:34] dressed and she made herself ready and
[1:13:36] went out and getting mocked at
[1:13:37] laughed at and carried on all kinds but
[1:13:39] she had enough faith in that man's words
[1:13:42] that that man told me he met me right
[1:13:45] over there at that corral
[1:13:46] and he told me he's gonna come back at
[1:13:48] this time therefore i'm gonna stand out
[1:13:50] here until he does
[1:13:52] and they made fun of her and they
[1:13:54] laughed and they said you're a bunch of
[1:13:55] crazy bunch of
[1:13:56] you're nuts you've lost your mind if
[1:13:58] anybody had come after he'd come after
[1:13:59] this one or that one or somebody else
[1:14:01] and he's going to come after little old
[1:14:02] you that's what he told me
[1:14:05] that's what he said therefore i'm going
[1:14:07] to stand here till he does
[1:14:09] because i judge his word to be faithful
[1:14:11] i don't think he was joking with me
[1:14:13] i don't think he was making fun of me he
[1:14:15] was very sincere with me when he began
[1:14:17] to reveal to me
[1:14:18] the secrets of his heart and revealed to
[1:14:20] me who i was
[1:14:21] and he told me that i was to be his wife
[1:14:23] and he said i'm coming back therefore
[1:14:25] i'm staying right here
[1:14:27] come on somebody even she has stood upon
[1:14:30] the words
[1:14:31] of a mortal man
[1:14:34] come on a mortal man that could be
[1:14:36] affected by things he could be affected
[1:14:38] by train wrecks or
[1:14:40] affected by whatever kind of things a
[1:14:41] buggy breaking down he could be affected
[1:14:43] by all kinds of stuff
[1:14:45] but she still stood there on the words
[1:14:47] of a mortal man
[1:14:48] but you're not here tonight standing on
[1:14:50] the words of a mortal man
[1:14:52] you're not here tonight at church
[1:14:53] because of the words of a mortal man
[1:14:56] you're not believing in his return
[1:14:57] because of the words of a mortal man
[1:15:00] he said he's coming back he told me the
[1:15:02] secrets of his heart
[1:15:04] he revealed to me himself and he told me
[1:15:06] who i am
[1:15:07] and he said i'm coming back at a certain
[1:15:09] time at a certain age
[1:15:11] you be ready and that's why i'm here
[1:15:15] call me what you want to call me a holy
[1:15:17] roller

[1:15:25] he's going to be here and i'm going to
[1:15:27] remain right here
[1:15:28] until he returns

[1:15:38] buried and remembered no more
[1:15:40] dead forever
[1:15:43] oh hallelujah rising he justified
[1:15:47] living he'd love me dying he saved me
[1:15:48] bear to carry it as my sins are far away
[1:15:51] rising he justified oh what a savior
[1:15:56] faithful he knew his word was faithful
[1:16:00] he had enough confidence in his word he
[1:16:02] said you destroy this temple in three
[1:16:04] days and i'll raise it up again
[1:16:06] because he knew that word wasn't going
[1:16:07] to return into him void but it was going
[1:16:09] to do what it promised it would do
[1:16:11] and it rose up from the dead rising he
[1:16:14] justified freely forever
[1:16:16] oh no wonder it brings emotions
[1:16:19] no wonder the human heart cannot contain
[1:16:21] it
[1:16:25] because he died and was buried and rose
[1:16:28] up again
[1:16:30] no wonder the angels in heaven sing the
[1:16:32] praises of god
[1:16:34] old testament saints and paradise
[1:16:36] shouted hallelujah
[1:16:37] the heavens shook the earth shook the
[1:16:39] paradise shook
[1:16:40] hell shook with that great voice coming
[1:16:42] forth up from the crazy road
[1:16:45] graveyard rose rising he justified
[1:16:48] freely forever
[1:16:49] and the saints that die in him can sing
[1:16:51] this when we look at that amazing grace
[1:16:54] yonder
[1:16:54] we know it's still amazing grace now
[1:16:58] that if i go down in the grave i'm going
[1:16:59] to rise up again
[1:17:02] why god has promised me he would and
[1:17:05] therefore he will do what he said he
[1:17:07] would do
[1:17:08] all sins are pardoned
[1:17:12] all sickness is broke death is defeated
[1:17:17] hell is conquered why because he's
[1:17:20] faithful
[1:17:23] because he's faithful let's read it here
[1:17:29] in psalms 119 and verse 90.
[1:17:34] brother brother timothy is he going to
[1:17:36] run out of faithfulness
[1:17:38] well let's see 119 and verse 90. that
[1:17:41] faithfulness
[1:17:43] is unto what all generations
[1:17:49] so if he was faithful in abraham's
[1:17:50] generation he's faithful
[1:17:52] in my generation if he is faithful in my
[1:17:55] daddy's generation
[1:17:57] the prophet of god's generation and he
[1:17:59] come down and showed himself faithful
[1:18:01] would raise the dead heal the sick save
[1:18:03] the lost
[1:18:04] miracles and signs and wonders he's
[1:18:06] still the same
[1:18:08] so he's faithful in all generations
[1:18:11] thou hast established the earth and it
[1:18:13] abideth
[1:18:14] so as long as this earth abides he's
[1:18:18] faithful
[1:18:21] first corinthians 10 verse 13 says there
[1:18:23] is no temptation taking you
[1:18:25] but such is common to man but god
[1:18:29] is faithful they can say that god is
[1:18:32] faithful
[1:18:34] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:18:35] above that you're able
[1:18:37] but will with the temptation also make a
[1:18:40] way of escape
[1:18:41] that you may be able to bury it
[1:18:44] hallelujah he won't put more sickness on
[1:18:46] you than you can handle
[1:18:50] that's what he told brother ron at the
[1:18:52] beginning he said if you'll trust me
[1:18:54] i'll use you like never before and we
[1:18:57] saw that taking place
[1:19:00] saw a dead man here i'm just talking
[1:19:03] about a doctor decreed dead man
[1:19:06] should have been dead within months
[1:19:10] almost a year right at a year later
[1:19:12] stand behind this pulpit
[1:19:14] and preach like a 30 or 40 year old
[1:19:18] like he was back then and still
[1:19:20] preaching like that does that not mean
[1:19:22] that he don't have bad days still yeah
[1:19:24] he has bad days
[1:19:25] he has sickness that comes against him
[1:19:27] as you heard even on sunday
[1:19:29] but god has been faithful
[1:19:32] and god is faithful and god has not lost
[1:19:36] one ounce of power over cancer
[1:19:42] amen but he's going to make a way of
[1:19:43] escape second thessalonians 3 3 says the
[1:19:46] lord
[1:19:47] his faithful who shall establish you
[1:19:51] and keep you from evil the lord is
[1:19:54] faithful
[1:19:55] who shall establish you and keep you
[1:19:57] from evil
[1:19:59] and he would say it here in lamentations
[1:20:00] 3 and verse 21
[1:20:03] this i recall to my mind
[1:20:08] this i want you to recall to your mind
[1:20:11] we think about all kinds of things but
[1:20:14] recall this to your mind
[1:20:16] and if you can recall this to your mind
[1:20:18] and your trials and your situations and
[1:20:20] the things that you're going through
[1:20:22] you can have hope he says therefore have
[1:20:24] i hope
[1:20:26] it is of the lord's mercies that we are
[1:20:29] not consumed
[1:20:31] because his compassions fail not
[1:20:35] they are new every morning great
[1:20:39] is thy faithfulness
[1:20:43] great in other words it's a word that
[1:20:45] means almost innumerable
[1:20:47] it's innumerable all your faithfulness
[1:20:52] story after story time after time we
[1:20:54] wouldn't even have time tonight to tell
[1:20:56] of god's faithfulness just in this
[1:20:58] church
[1:21:00] but it's to all generations it's to
[1:21:03] every heart
[1:21:04] it's to every life it's to every person
[1:21:08] and great is our faithfulness
[1:21:11] do you find him faithful tonight do you
[1:21:14] find him trustworthy tonight
[1:21:16] or in other words do you find him
[1:21:18] somebody you can put your trust in
[1:21:21] and your life in and your body in
[1:21:24] and your mind in and your spirit in and
[1:21:27] say god
[1:21:28] i don't know how i'm going to get
[1:21:29] through this but you're faithful
[1:21:32] you promised you was going to make me a
[1:21:34] way of escape and i'm looking for that
[1:21:35] moment
[1:21:37] he did it for peter we could find his
[1:21:40] faithfulness all the way through the new
[1:21:41] testament
[1:21:42] well my goodness all the things that but
[1:21:44] paul there on the ship
[1:21:46] going down he showed faithfulness in
[1:21:48] this moment when he got bit by a snake
[1:21:50] he showed faithfulness in his moment
[1:21:52] when peter was in jail and it seemed
[1:21:54] like all hope was gone and the saints
[1:21:55] began to pray
[1:21:56] he showed faithfulness in those moments
[1:22:00] he'd touch him on the side say come on
[1:22:02] peter
[1:22:03] come out of this place and you don't
[1:22:05] ever know
[1:22:06] when your touch is coming
[1:22:13] you don't know when that touch is about
[1:22:14] to happen peter maybe that was the last
[1:22:16] thing on his mind
[1:22:18] he had his soldiers on all four sides of
[1:22:20] him he was in the innermost prison
[1:22:22] he had bars all around him guards
[1:22:24] everywhere
[1:22:25] and they ain't that the angel don't pay
[1:22:27] no attention to guards or
[1:22:29] cancer or spirits or he comes right
[1:22:32] beyond all of it
[1:22:34] strongholds and bondages and walls god's
[1:22:36] never paid no attention to none of that
[1:22:38] when he decided to get his purse his
[1:22:40] child out he went and got him out
[1:22:42] it didn't matter how much the devil had
[1:22:43] covered him up it didn't matter how much
[1:22:45] the devil walled him in
[1:22:46] when god decided it was time he went and
[1:22:48] got him
[1:22:50] you don't know when your touch is coming
[1:22:53] but remain faithful
