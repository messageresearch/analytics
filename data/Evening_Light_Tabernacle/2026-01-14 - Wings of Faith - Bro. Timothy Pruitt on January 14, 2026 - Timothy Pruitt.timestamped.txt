[3:49] Brother Joe, if you come.
[3:54] [music]
[3:55] Amen. Let's just bow our hearts and our
[3:57] heads this evening and take these knees
[3:59] to him. Father, what a great privilege
[4:01] we have as your children, [music] Lord,
[4:03] that we can come in your presence
[4:04] tonight.
[4:06] And Lord, we humble ourselves before
[4:08] [music] you and say, "Thank you, God,
[4:10] for all that you have done for us."
[4:12] Lord, we're at the beginning of a new
[4:15] year. And Lord, the Bible tells us that
[4:18] your mercies are new each and every day.
[4:20] So, Father, we have countless mercies
[4:23] that are looking our way [music] in this
[4:24] new year. And it seems like right out
[4:27] the gate, Lord, the enemy's been on the
[4:28] attack. He's been on the offensive,
[4:31] Father, attacking your children, Lord,
[4:33] one by one. But, Father, we know and we
[4:35] understand, Lord, that nothing can
[4:38] happen to a child of God, but what Satan
[4:40] has to go to our heavenly father and ask
[4:42] permission. So, Lord, we know that you
[4:45] find confidence in each of us that are
[4:47] in struggle and battle, Father. And we
[4:49] ask tonight, Lord, you would just give
[4:51] that understanding to us. Equip us for
[4:54] the moment. Father, [music] prepare us
[4:56] for the moment that we're living in.
[4:57] Lord, the struggle that we're facing.
[5:00] Some with sickness. Some, Lord God,
[5:02] facing difficulties in life in general.
[5:05] But we know that the hand of God is not
[5:07] short, but what he can't reach down and
[5:09] save and heal and deliver. So, Father,
[5:12] we invoke the name of Jesus tonight. We
[5:14] petition your throne. Lord, we invite
[5:16] you to touch those that are mentioned
[5:18] tonight. Many different needs, God, but
[5:20] you're the great I am. You're the
[5:22] healer, Lord. You already had it in your
[5:24] word that by my stripes, [music]
[5:26] you are healed. Lord, it's a past tense
[5:29] work. And we're so thankful, Lord, that
[5:33] we can look to you not not only in the
[5:35] past tense, but the very [music]
[5:37] present help in our times of trouble. So
[5:39] speak to those that are in need tonight,
[5:41] Lord. touch them in their bodies, our
[5:43] visitors in our midst this [music]
[5:45] evening. May you touch them, speak to
[5:47] them, God. Give a word of assurance to
[5:50] them tonight. Use Brother Timothy, Lord,
[5:52] as he has set aside time to study and
[5:54] pray. We invite you, Lord, to have your
[5:56] way. We thank you for bringing Brother
[5:59] Aaron [clears throat and music] and
[5:59] sister Lydia home to us safely. We
[6:02] trust, Lord, you used them for your
[6:04] glory. [music]
[6:04] Trust there's going to be many wonderful
[6:06] testimonies, Father. So, have your way
[6:08] in the service tonight now. We ask in
[6:10] Jesus' name. Amen.

[6:19] offering this evening.

[11:20] The preacher listened
[11:21] [singing and music]
[11:22] closely
[11:24] to the broken mother's heart
[11:28] as she talked about [singing and music]
[11:30] her daughter gone astray.
[11:35] Feeling
[11:38] so ashamed, [music and singing]
[11:40] she wants to take the blame [singing]
[11:44] as she wonders [music] where she made
[11:48] her mistake.
[11:52] [music] But the preacher said, [singing]
[11:54] "This God
[11:57] [music] knows the way to Calvary."
[12:00] And [singing] the word says that she
[12:03] won't run for [singing] long.

[13:07] story.
[13:09] You're praying, Lord, how long [singing]
[13:13] what will [music] it take for my child
[13:16] to be saved?
[13:21] You know [singing] God [music] has a
[13:23] plan.
[13:24] You've placed it in his hands,
[13:28] but it's hard to leave it there [music]
[13:31] and walk away. [singing]
[13:36] There's [music] a promise to your
[13:39] children.
[13:40] The same [music] one he's given you
[13:44] that [singing] together you will spend
[13:47] eternity. [music]

[13:56] when God [singing] extends his grace.
[14:00] But [music] until then they just speak
[14:03] and with all your heart believe they're

[14:19] road. [music]
[14:23] Someday [singing] they'll share their
[14:26] story
[14:27] and help somebody [music and singing]
[14:29] else to make it home.

[25:00] many wonderful things in our lives. Not
[25:02] enough words to thank you [music] for
[25:04] everything, but God, from the humblest
[25:06] parts of our heart, we just want to say
[25:08] thank you. Thank you [music] for your
[25:10] call upon our lives, Lord. Thank you for
[25:13] the ability, Lord, to rise out of the
[25:15] sin of this world and [music] life of
[25:18] this world, Lord, and to live a life
[25:20] above it. Lord, thank you, Lord, for the
[25:22] promises that's [music] in your word,
[25:24] Father, that we can see that gives us
[25:26] strength to rise above sin and [music]
[25:28] sickness and everything the devil may
[25:31] try to throw at us. Lord, may we rise
[25:34] tonight in the realms of the Holy Ghost,
[25:36] Father, the realms of the supernatural,
[25:37] [music]
[25:38] Lord, to see all things are possible to
[25:41] them that believe. We ask these things
[25:44] for your [music] glory in Jesus name.
[25:48] Amen.
[25:50] Amen. Let's turn to Isaiah chapter 40
[25:55] verse 31.
[26:01] [clears throat] Also
[26:06] read from Psalms 91 and verse4
[26:10] says, "But they that wait upon the Lord
[26:13] shall renew their strength, and they
[26:16] shall mount up with wings as eagles, and
[26:20] they shall run and not be weary, and
[26:22] they shall walk and not faint." Also
[26:26] Psalms 91 and verse4 said, "He shall
[26:28] cover thee with his feathers, and under
[26:31] his wings shalt thy trust. His truth
[26:34] shall be thy shield and buckler." Amen.
[26:38] We let you be seated this evening.
[26:41] [clears throat]
[26:45] Like to speak to you this evening on the
[26:46] wings of faith.
[26:49] Amen. You know, of course, as we all
[26:51] know, we live in a world full of fear
[26:54] and uncertainty and storms and trials.
[26:59] As we seem to go further and further and
[27:02] this year, the the war drums are beating
[27:05] ever more and and seem like all over the
[27:08] world, wars and rumors of war. But you
[27:10] know, in all of this, God has not left
[27:12] his people exposed.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; He has provided covering. He is our
[27:17] refuge. He has provided his wings. You
[27:20] know, to be under his wings means that
[27:22] you trust. You're trusting when you
[27:25] don't even understand.
[27:27] You're staying there when it's easier
[27:29] seems like easier to run. And you're
[27:32] believing when fear says to flee. You
[27:35] know, faith under his wings says, "God,
[27:37] I'm going to stay right here even though
[27:39] I don't know what's coming next."
[27:42] You know, and it says in Psalms 57, and
[27:44] we could read many scriptures about the
[27:46] wings of God as it would speak about
[27:49] this. And and it says Psalms 57:1, "Be
[27:52] merciful unto me, oh God, be merciful
[27:54] unto me, for my soul trusteth in thee.
[27:57] Yay, in the shadow of thy wings will I
[28:00] make my refuge until these calamities be
[28:04] overpassed." In other words, God does
[28:06] not promise there will be no calamities.
[28:10] But he did promise that he will re be
[28:12] our refuge until they pass. You know
[28:15] being under his wings does not mean no
[28:17] sickness, no trials, no loss, no
[28:20] trouble, no situations, no
[28:21] circumstances. But what it means that
[28:24] the storm that you in that you're in
[28:26] will not destroy you.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The storm may rage, but the wings
[28:31] are remain spread upon you and covering
[28:33] you. Under God's wings, guilt can be
[28:36] forgiven. Hearts can be healed. lives
[28:39] can be restored. Amen. You may be feel
[28:41] you may feel worn down, but God under
[28:44] his wings offers renewal unto you. You
[28:47] may feel broken tonight, but God is a
[28:50] God who restores under his wings. So we
[28:53] read in our scripture, they that wait
[28:55] upon the Lord shall shall renew their
[28:58] strength. They shall mount up with wings
[29:01] as an eagle. You know, in other words,
[29:03] waiting is not weakness. Waiting is
[29:06] trust in action. And those who wait
[29:08] under his wings run or not and are not
[29:11] weary. Those that wait under his wings
[29:13] they walk and they do not faint. They
[29:15] rise above what once weighed them down.
[29:19] Amen. You know given wings as eagles,
[29:21] wings of faith to rise above every
[29:24] circumstance, above every doubt, above
[29:26] every hindrance, above every sickness.
[29:29] Now, now wings does not remove gravity.
[29:32] It just overcomes it.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? It does not remove
[29:36] gravity. It just overcomes it. Same same
[29:39] as faith. It does not deny reality, but
[29:42] it rises above the reality. Amen. It
[29:45] does not deny that there's truly
[29:47] sickness, but it rises above the
[29:49] sickness. It It does not deny that
[29:51] there's trouble in your home, but it it
[29:53] rises above the trouble that's in your
[29:56] home. Amen. Same as wings on an
[29:58] airplane. It does not remove the
[30:00] gravity. The gravity is still there.
[30:02] Amen. every step of the way, every
[30:04] movement of that airplane. But a
[30:06] skillful PL pilot can adjust the wings
[30:09] to the wind that's carrying that's
[30:11] coming through there and it'll rise into
[30:13] the sky and defy gravity. It actually,
[30:16] you know, it's actually called adjusting
[30:18] the plane's attitude. And when it when
[30:20] it that little instrument they look at
[30:22] that shows where the wings are and where
[30:24] you're at and and the attitude towards
[30:26] the ground, where you're at, how you're
[30:28] turned, if you're turned this way or if
[30:29] you're pointed down or up. It's the
[30:31] attitude and how you adjust the
[30:33] attitude. It would it'll automatically
[30:36] adjust your altitude. So what if we're
[30:39] not, you know, other in other words, you
[30:41] know, our attitude affects our altitude.
[30:43] Amen. How we look at things, how how we
[30:46] how we respond to things, how how how we
[30:49] how we uh uh react in our life and
[30:51] everyday life, our attitude. Amen. It
[30:54] reflects and it will affect our attit
[30:57] our altitude towards where we go. So,
[31:00] but we were not meant to be earthbound
[31:02] creatures. We were bound. We were not
[31:04] meant to be bound by our senses or by
[31:07] our circumstances. This bride, Amen, was
[31:10] not meant to be pinned down by unbelief
[31:12] for creeds of men. But we were meant to
[31:15] soar into the heavenlies. We were meant
[31:18] to be into the realms of the
[31:19] impossibilities to to be in the Holy
[31:22] Ghost realm where all things are
[31:24] possible. That Amen. in this service
[31:26] THAT WE WOULD NOT BE BOUND by
[31:28] circumstances that we face today or
[31:31] situations that went on going on in our
[31:33] lives that we would enter in and we
[31:35] begin to adjust our attitude so we can
[31:38] we we can be responded to our altitude
[31:41] that our altitude would change today. I
[31:43] I trust that this evening, maybe you
[31:45] came this this evening with things going
[31:47] on in your life as anybody else would. I
[31:49] no doubt every one of us has all kinds
[31:51] of things. Seem like more and more we go
[31:53] in this life, the more and more we got
[31:54] going on in our lives, the more and more
[31:57] that we have to deal with and we have to
[31:58] constantly war against. But I maybe you
[32:00] come in waring today, but maybe in this
[32:03] service YOU CAN SAY, "GOD, I NEED my
[32:05] attitude adjusted. I I need things in my
[32:08] life adjusted so I can enter into the
[32:10] realms of the supernatural." Amen.
[32:12] That's what song service is about. It's
[32:15] adjusting our attitude. It's getting us
[32:17] into the realms of the spirit that we
[32:19] can move into the realms of the Holy
[32:21] Ghost where all things are possible. Cuz
[32:24] we were not meant to be bound by our
[32:26] senses. We were not meant to be bound by
[32:28] our human abilities, human inabilities,
[32:31] but we WERE MEANT TO FLY INTO THE
[32:34] heavenlies of heaven. Amen. Brother
[32:36] Brandham, you know, at a zoo one time
[32:37] saw what he called the most pathetic
[32:39] sight he'd ever seen was an old cage
[32:42] that was there and the eagle had been
[32:43] caught and was sitting in his cage and
[32:45] he was laying on his back when I went up
[32:47] there and his great big wings were just
[32:49] laid out and I noticed he was bleeding
[32:51] down the front of him and his head was
[32:53] all bleeding. His feathers knocked out
[32:54] of the edge of his wings. I thought,
[32:56] "What's the matter with this poor bird?"
[32:58] And there's a little girl said, "Daddy,
[33:00] he's bleeding." Said, "Yeah, you know,
[33:02] there there's ain't nothing for him to
[33:04] fight. He looking around. Maybe there's
[33:05] an animal got to him. I I didn't know
[33:07] what he was fighting. But after a while,
[33:09] he got up and he shook his weary head
[33:11] and he turned his head and he looked
[33:13] like that. You know, he's a heavenly
[33:15] bird. And he got back in the cage like
[33:17] that where he didn't belong. Somebody
[33:19] put him in the cage. And here he come
[33:20] again and he would flop his wings and he
[33:23] would try to fly up into the heavenlies
[33:25] and he would hit that cage and it would
[33:27] knock him backwards and he would hit
[33:29] that cage and it was knock him
[33:30] backwards. It was having such a hard
[33:32] time till he just laid there and his
[33:34] weary eyes looking up to that sky
[33:37] longing to be up there. And I thought,
[33:39] "Oh God, isn't that the most pitiful
[33:41] sight?" He said, "But then something
[33:43] struck my heart." And I thought, "That
[33:45] is not the most pitiful thing I ever
[33:47] seen. An animal in a cage. The most
[33:49] pitiful thing I ever seen is a man born
[33:53] to be a son of God. born to be a son of
[33:56] God, but pinned down by some creed or
[33:58] SOME ORGANIZATION OR SOME IDEA OR SOME
[34:01] TROUBLE. IT MEANS SOMETHING THAT'LL tell
[34:03] them days of miracles are passed.
[34:05] Something that'll say there's no such a
[34:07] thing as a baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[34:09] But he'll lay in them old denominational
[34:11] creeds and look up into the heavenlies
[34:14] where he belongs. HE WAS BORN TO BE A
[34:17] SON OF GOD.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I'm preaching TO
[34:22] PEOPLE THAT WERE BORN TO BE SONS AND
[34:24] DAUGHTERS OF GOD. YOU WERE NOT BORN TO
[34:26] BE BOUND BY THOSE SENSES. YOU WERE NOT
[34:28] BORN TO BE BOUND BY YOUR FRUSTRATION.
[34:31] YOU WERE NOT BORN TO BE BOUND BY
[34:33] DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND FEAR. YOU
[34:36] WERE BORN FOR THE HEAVENLIES.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE BORN TO RISE ABOVE IT ALL.
[34:40] AMEN. GOD WANTS HIM OUT OF ALL OF THAT.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. God wants him out. Well, if
[34:48] God wants you out, then you're coming
[34:50] out.
[34:52] Amen. Amen. That's the work of a man
[34:54] that put that eagle there and he said
[34:56] it's a work of a man that'll put a man
[34:58] in creeds and denomination and ideas.
[35:00] They're all of the devil. Yes, sir.
[35:02] Creed a man down and say days of
[35:04] miracles are passed. No such a thing as
[35:06] the joy of the Holy Ghost. Not no such a
[35:09] thing as shouting. No such a thing as
[35:11] speaking in tongues. No divine healing.
[35:13] IT'S PITIFUL. THOSE SONS OF GOD ARE BORN
[35:16] TO BE FREE. AMEN.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE BORN TO BE SONS. THEY WERE
[35:22] BORN TO BE FREE. DON'T EVER LET ANYONE
[35:25] PUT YOU IN SOME KIND OF CAGE.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Hallelujah. Don't let any
[35:32] man get up and preach you into a cage.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you were born to be into the
[35:39] heavenlies. AMEN. KEEP OUT OF THOSE
[35:41] CAGES.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; This old eagle, he's such a wonderful
[35:44] bird. His habits, he's I like to watch
[35:46] his habits. What he does. I watched them
[35:48] build their nest many times up on the
[35:49] roundups and I put my glasses on and
[35:51] watch them early in the morning when we
[35:53] started on the drive. I'd get there and
[35:54] get my binoculars and see those old
[35:56] eagles sitting on those nests and he
[35:58] goes out. You ought to see him. He never
[36:00] builds his nest on the ground. He won't
[36:01] build his nest on the ground. He builds
[36:02] his nest in the high as high as he can
[36:04] get at the highest peak. He said there's
[36:06] a reason God likened the eagle or a
[36:09] church or to his church or a church to
[36:11] an eagle. You're a candle that sits on a
[36:13] hill. You should have high ambitions.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Listen to this now. You should have high
[36:22] ambition. You should have high
[36:25] anticipations.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Well, it's just another Wednesday. No,
[36:30] this is going to be the best Wednesday
[36:32] ever.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. YOU SHOULD HAVE HIGH
[36:36] ANTICIPATION. YOU SHOULD BE EXPECTING
[36:39] great things.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; What you say? He says, "Well, I'm
[36:44] Pentecost, so that settles it." Well,
[36:46] you can put it, "Oh, I'm message
[36:47] believer. That settles it. That don't
[36:49] for me."
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Hello. He said, "That don't for me. I'm
[36:54] expecting greater things."
[36:57] &gt;&gt; I'm Baptist. I'm Methodist. I'm one. I'm
[36:59] torunist. I'm thr WHATEVER YOU ARE, THAT
[37:02] DON'T SATISFY ME. I HAVE AMBITIONS TO
[37:05] MOVE ON UP TILL I MEET HIM.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I have ambitions TO
[37:13] MOVE ON UP TILL I MEET HIM. I RECEIVE
[37:16] THE Holy Ghost. That settles it. It
[37:18] didn't with me.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO THE PROPHET. IT DIDN'T WITH
[37:22] ME. I'M STILL I'M STILL JUST TAKING IT
[37:25] AND MOVING HIGHER AND HIGHER AND MOVING
[37:28] ON UP HIGHER. [screaming] HIGHER
[37:30] AMBITIONS, HIGHER EXPECTATIONS, MORE
[37:33] MOVE OF GOD,
[37:35] &gt;&gt; MORE MIRACLES, MORE SIGNS AND WONDERS,
[37:38] MORE OF GOD REVEALED TO HIS CHURCH, MORE
[37:40] OF HIS WORD UNVEILED IN THIS HOUR, MORE,
[37:43] MORE, MORE AND MORE. I SAY IF A PROPHET
[37:46] WASN'T SATISFIED ON THE LEVEL HE WAS ON,
[37:48] HOW COME YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE
[37:50] SATISFIED AT THE LEVEL YOU'RE AT?
[37:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. We ought to be looking to
[37:56] move higher,
[37:58] &gt;&gt; higher into the realms of the Holy
[38:00] Ghost. More of an outpouring of his
[38:02] spirit. Not less,
[38:04] &gt;&gt; more.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should be reaching for higher
[38:08] heights, higher expectations, higher
[38:11] ambitions in the word, greater and
[38:13] higher, rising above our critics. Amen.
[38:16] Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; The word to where the critics, whatever
[38:19] they say, it doesn't even bother us no
[38:20] more cuz we're so far high, so far above
[38:23] them and higher than all that nonsense
[38:25] that we can't even hear it no more.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; RISING ABOVE THE DOUBT and unbelief.
[38:33] He would tell a story and I'll go
[38:34] through a few things here for a moment.
[38:37] He said he was standing there one night,
[38:39] one day out in the wilderness. He said,
[38:40] "But I was in the presence of God." He
[38:42] said, "I was about 40 miles from any any
[38:45] human being that I knew of at least 40
[38:47] miles from a ranch. The sun had caused a
[38:50] rainbow to struck the the storm that had
[38:52] come through and and the rainbow had
[38:54] come out and I saw God in his covenant
[38:56] and the rainbow and Revelations 1, John
[38:58] saw him. He had a rainbow, looked as
[39:00] jasper and sardan stone and the first,
[39:02] you know, he said I just just things be
[39:04] to come and he said then old male elk
[39:06] begin to bugle and he got lost from the
[39:08] herd during the storm and and he said
[39:10] there was God in that bugle and the wolf
[39:12] began to howl and there was God in that
[39:14] the maid answering him at the bottom God
[39:16] and the wolf everywhere you looked you
[39:17] could see God and I was standing there
[39:19] he said but all of a sudden something
[39:20] caught my attention was this little pine
[39:22] squirrel and a little bitty fussy thing
[39:25] fussing all up just jumped on a little
[39:26] stump he was just cutting a big no
[39:28] noise, you know, almost like a blue coat
[39:31] policeman of the wood. Makes so much
[39:32] fuss sometimes. He's too big, too, you
[39:34] know, he ain't big enough to do
[39:36] anything. Just you little bitty guy. So,
[39:38] he's just a carrying on. I wonder why
[39:40] you so excited, little fella? Cuz I had
[39:42] got real happy standing right where I
[39:44] was at. And I'd just set my gun against
[39:46] a tree and I'd run around and run around
[39:49] around that tree shouting like a maniac.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, goodness. Amen.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; You think if he did it out there, he
[39:59] wouldn't do it somewhere else.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; If you get you see God, you something's
[40:03] going to happen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, he said, "Now, all you
[40:08] don't believe that, you know, you don't
[40:09] believe a Baptist can shout, do you?" He
[40:11] said, "I was shouting, of course." He
[40:12] said, "I'm a Baptist, but I'm a
[40:14] Pentecostal Baptist. I'm one with the
[40:15] Holy Ghost." So then while I was car
[40:18] carrying on out there, he said, "If
[40:20] somebody had been in the woods, they'd
[40:21] have thought they had a maniac out there
[40:24] around and around that tree screaming to
[40:27] the top of my lungs and I was about to
[40:29] explode. HAD TO DO SOMETHING. POP OFF
[40:31] SOME STEAM SOMEWHERE." DID YOU EVER GET
[40:33] SO FULL you had to do something?
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; DID YOU EVER GET SO FULL YOU HAD TO DO
[40:44] SOMETHING? THAT'S ALL. YOU GOT TO DO IT.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? DAVID SAID, "MY CUP RUNTH
[40:49] OVER. I WAS SO FILLED UP. SOMETHING HAD
[40:52] TO BE EXPRESSED."
[40:55] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Well, this little fella,
[40:57] what's got him so excited? Maybe the way
[41:00] I'm acting, he don't like it." Well, he
[41:02] looked at that little squirrel and said,
[41:03] "Well, if you love the creator like I
[41:04] do, you'd be acting the same way I am."
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; You'd be doing the same thing. I was
[41:13] just a talking to him, you know, but I
[41:15] noticed a little guy wasn't even looking
[41:16] at me. He had his head cocked over a
[41:18] little bit. Looked down through there
[41:19] like that little blow down there in
[41:21] previous storm and blow the trees and
[41:23] lap together. And the eagle had been
[41:25] forced down into this blowdown and he
[41:28] was watching that eagle.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; I was, oh,
[41:32] this big eagle jumped up on a limb and
[41:35] he said here, I I thought, man, you I'm
[41:37] thinking, why did God stop me in the
[41:38] middle of my rejoicing? And why why you
[41:41] have to make all that noise, squirrel?
[41:42] And he's asking all these questions. And
[41:44] I noticed the eagle is seen to be. He
[41:46] wasn't afraid. He He He wasn't a coward.
[41:48] He He God See, God can't use cowards.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; When you believe God, you got to believe
[41:56] him all with all that's in you. God
[41:57] don't want anyone in saying that, "Oh
[41:59] yes, praise the Lord. I believe." Then
[42:00] go outside. I don't know. I still feel
[42:02] bad. Hello. Did you hear that? Maybe I
[42:05] need to slow down just a second. He
[42:07] said, ' God doesn't want cowards that'll
[42:10] be in church, say, "Praise the Lord, I
[42:12] believe it," then go outside and say, "I
[42:14] don't know. I still feel bad."
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He can't use that.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; You got to BELIEVE GOD IN AND OUT.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; EVERYWHERE YOU ARE, BELIEVE GOD JUST THE
[42:31] SAME. AND I NOTICED THE EAGLE, HE was a
[42:33] brave one. He wasn't afraid. I wonder,
[42:35] "Well, why ain't you afraid? Don't you
[42:36] know I have my rifle. I'LL KILL YOU. HE
[42:38] SAID, "BUT I ADMIRED HIM." He said, "If
[42:40] he could read my mind, he could really
[42:41] see in the inside." I REALLY ADMIRED HIM
[42:43] AND I remind I admire anything that's
[42:46] not afraid. I hate a coward. AND I SAID,
[42:48] "WHAT MAKES YOU SO BRAVE?" And I
[42:50] thought, he sees my rifle sitting
[42:51] against the tree. He knew, you know, I
[42:55] just I'll grab it and I can maybe shoot
[42:56] him, but he knew he could get in those
[42:59] timbers and I would NEVER GET A SHOT
[43:01] OFF. RIGHT?
[43:03] &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD MADE HIM AN eagle and HE GAVE
[43:05] HIM TWO WINGS TO GET AWAY FROM THE
[43:07] DANGER that was around him.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; HE HAD PERFECT FAITH IN THOSE TWO
[43:12] GOD-GIVEN WINGS.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; AND I THOUGHT, WHAT IF THE CHURCH HAD
[43:17] THAT MUCH FAITH IN THE TWO WINGS THAT
[43:19] GOD GAVE YOU?
[43:22] &gt;&gt; GOD gave you two wings. He gave you THE
[43:24] NEW AND THE OLD TESTAMENT. HE GAVE YOU
[43:26] PROMISES THAT'LL MAKE YOU BE ABLE TO FLY
[43:29] ABOVE EVERY TROUBLE, ABOVE EVERY
[43:31] SICKNESS, ABOVE EVERY SORROW, ABOVE
[43:34] EVERY DOUBT, [screaming] ABOVE EVERY
[43:35] DEPRESSION, ABOVE ALL ANXIETIES AND
[43:38] FEAR.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; And rise
[43:43] above it.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Said, I watched him a few moments and
[43:47] that little pine squirrel was cursing
[43:49] him for everything he had,
[43:53] &gt;&gt; but he never even paid attention to him.
[43:57] He didn't read that pine squirrel's
[43:58] emails.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't read his Facebook post.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; His Instagram. He didn't read none of
[44:07] it.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:13] He just gave one great big jump.
[44:17] After a while, he got tired of it all
[44:19] and he just gave one great big jump.
[44:21] made two big old flops with his wings
[44:23] and he was outside the timber. One of
[44:25] the most amazing things, he never
[44:27] flopped no more. He just jumped, made a
[44:28] couple flops with his wings and out of
[44:30] the timber he knew how to set those
[44:32] wings. And every time the wind would
[44:34] come in, he would just rise up.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; See, understand the wind is not sent for
[44:41] you to go down.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; The wind wind is sent for you to go up.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I stood and I watched him. until
[44:49] it got smaller and smaller until it
[44:51] become a cry, a little speck. And I I
[44:53] stood there crying like a baby. I said,
[44:54] "That's it, Lord. It ain't running from
[44:56] place to place, joining this, joining
[44:58] Baptist, joining that." It isn't that.
[45:00] It's just get your feet off the ground
[45:02] and set your wings in the power of God.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Set your wings IN THE POWER OF GOD. AND
[45:08] WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES IN, RIDE UP
[45:10] ON IT.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. you you're NOT GOING TO RIDE UP
[45:16] ON IF YOU JUST KEEP YOUR WINGS DOWN BY
[45:18] YOUR SIDE.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU DON'T EVER GET IT OUT AND
[45:22] YOU DON'T EVER LOOK AT IT AND YOU DON'T
[45:24] EVER START FLEXING A LITTLE BIT AND
[45:26] THAT'S WHAT THIS EAGLE was doing. He
[45:27] started moving them a little bit. He
[45:29] started listen mister, I got two wings
[45:31] and I'll be out of sight before you can
[45:33] get that gun up.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he was no doubt must
[45:37] have BEEN THINKING BECAUSE HE WASN'T
[45:38] AFRAID. AMEN. HE WAS ALREADY EXERCISING
[45:41] THEM GOD-GIVEN WINGS. YEAH. HE MAY HAVE
[45:43] GOT BLOWED DOWN FOR A LITTLE BIT. HE MAY
[45:45] HAVE GOT CAUGHT IN A STORM AND HAD TO
[45:47] WEATHER HAD TO SIT THERE FOR A LITTLE
[45:49] WHILE AND NOT SIT THERE AND WONDER
[45:52] WHAT'S GOING TO BE NEXT. BUT ALL OF A
[45:53] SUDDEN, THE STORM PASSED OVER.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; YEAH, THERE WAS A LOT OF CHATTERING
[45:58] GOING ON. LOOK, IF YOU'D HAVE BEEN A
[45:59] REAL SON, YOU'D HAVE NOT COME DOWN. IF
[46:01] YOU'D HAVE BEEN A REAL SON, YOU HAD A
[46:03] REAL real eagle, you'd have NOT DID THIS
[46:05] CHATTER, CHATTER, CHATTER. BUT HE KNEW
[46:07] GOD HAD GAVE HIM SOME WINGS TO FLY.
[46:11] AND ALL HE DID WAS TO JUST LIFT HIM UP
[46:13] AND GIVE HIM A COUPLE OF GOOD FLOPS AND
[46:15] FIND THAT WIND AND THEN RISE ABOVE IT.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; MAYBE THE DEVIL'S BEEN CHATTERING AT YOU
[46:22] THIS WEEKEND OR THIS WEEK SAYING, "HEY,
[46:24] IF YOU'RE A REAL SON OF GOD, YOU
[46:25] WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THAT MISTAKE. YOU
[46:27] WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THAT FAILURE. YOU
[46:28] WOULDN'T BE DEPRESSED LIKE THAT. YOU
[46:30] WOULDN'T HAVE ANXIETY LIKE THAT. YOU
[46:32] WOULDN'T BE FEARFUL LIKE THAT. IF YOU
[46:34] WAS A REAL SON, LISTEN HERE, OLD BOY. I
[46:36] GOT TWO WINGS.
[46:39] I AIN'T JUST BECOME A SON. I ALWAYS WAS
[46:41] A SON.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; AND HE GAVE ME TWO WINGS THAT I COULD
[46:45] FLY WITH. AND ALL I NEED IS JUST START
[46:47] FLOPPING THEM IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND
[46:50] LET THE WINDS OF THE HOLY GHOST PICK ME
[46:52] UP. AND I'LL LEAVE YOUR OLD HIDE BEHIND.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; WOO. HALLELUJAH. I'm trusting somebody
[46:59] is going to leave fear behind.
[47:00] Somebody's going TO LEAVE DEPRESSION
[47:02] BEHIND. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO LEAVE
[47:04] ANXIETY BEHIND. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO
[47:05] LEAVE A SICKNESS BEHIND TONIGHT WHEN
[47:07] THEY REALIZE I GOT TWO WINGS.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Just set your wings in in faith and by
[47:16] faith out there and ride the waves of
[47:17] the Holy Ghost when he comes in. Just
[47:20] ride on the way on the way on the way on
[47:22] the way on the way
[47:24] all the way up and get plum out of here
[47:26] in distance.
[47:33] You know why sometimes
[47:36] sometimes you hear the devil so much?
[47:37] Because you let him get too close.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; He don't have these wings. He don't have
[47:42] this ability to rise in the presence of
[47:45] God like this. Not like what I'm talking
[47:47] about. Not with faith.
[47:50] [crying]
[47:50] And you can leave him behind.
[47:55] He said, "I think about the great heroes
[47:57] of the Bible.
[48:00] And it just reminds me here sometimes he
[48:03] says that statement he said it remind
[48:04] her heroes of the Bible. Then he says
[48:06] this. It reminds me some time ago I was
[48:09] up in the mountains here and I was
[48:11] noticing the ducks
[48:14] heroes of the Bible and ducks.
[48:18] When they're all around the water
[48:19] pulling up and the first time a cold
[48:21] wind blows, these little old ducks get
[48:23] out there and honk two or three times
[48:24] and take off to Louisiana just as hard
[48:27] as they can go to the rice field. What's
[48:28] the matter? They don't have any
[48:30] theology.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; They don't have some scholar standing up
[48:35] before them and saying, "Okay, boys, it
[48:37] is time."
[48:40] &gt;&gt; No, they were born a duck.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; And when he's a duck, he's got
[48:43] instincts. He's a duck. And his
[48:46] instincts tells him, "It's time to
[48:48] move."
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; His instincts tell him, "It's time to
[48:54] move. There's cold weather ahead. go to
[48:56] where there's warmer and better grounds.
[48:58] And if a duck can do that and be a duck,
[49:02] HOW OUGHT A MAN DO BY THE BAPTISM OF THE
[49:05] HOLY GHOST?
[49:06] &gt;&gt; IT OUGHT TO PUT AN INSTINCT on the
[49:08] INSIDE OF YOU TO TELL YOU IT'S TIME TO
[49:11] MOVE.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST IS MOVING THROUGH. IT'S
[49:16] TIME TO RESPOND.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO MOVE. AMEN. IT'S TIME TO
[49:22] GET UP AND GET GOING. HE OUGHT TO BE
[49:24] ABLE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S TROUBLE MAYBE
[49:26] AHEAD AND HE CAN STEP OUT ON GOD'S WAVE,
[49:30] AWAY WITH HIS WINGS OF FAITH AND MOVE
[49:32] OUT FROM THAT THING. HE SAID IF YOU
[49:34] WILL, YOU'LL MOVE FROM THAT SICKNESS.
[49:36] YOU'LL MOVE OUT OF THAT SHACKLED DOWN
[49:38] CONDITION.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; ALL THOSE THINGS, IT'S TIME [screaming]
[49:41] FOR GOD TO MOVE AND DO THOSE THINGS. The
[49:43] great presence of the Lord Jesus to
[49:45] bless, TO GIVE POWER, AND GREAT THINGS
[49:47] FOR THE CHURCH IN ANY DAY. GOD HAS
[49:49] PROMISED HE WOULD DO IT. HE SAID IN THE
[49:51] LAST DAYS HIS SPIRIT WOULD BE POURED OUT
[49:54] UPON HIGH. He showed visions AND SIGNS
[49:56] AND WONDER IN the earth. All these
[49:57] different THINGS GOD PROMISED IT AND GOD
[49:59] WILL BRING IT TO PASS.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; But when you feel that moving,
[50:08] it ought to be an instinct on the inside
[50:10] of you to respond.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I want to move higher.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I want to move in into a
[50:20] higher height.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; I want to get up into another place,
[50:23] into another plane, to another level.
[50:26] He said, God, help us to take the wings
[50:29] of the eagle and fly away to every
[50:31] divine promise God gave in the Bible.
[50:35] He said, "That's the reason." Listen
[50:36] here. He said, "That's the reason that
[50:38] insane epilepticleptic
[50:40] boy tonight is now perfectly whole
[50:45] &gt;&gt; because faith was set in wings
[50:49] &gt;&gt; and God packed him from sickness to
[50:51] health."
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we can give the
[50:55] testimony of not tonight. today of
[50:58] Sister Atlanta Bunts who was covered up
[50:59] in cancer and God moved her from
[51:02] sickness to health
[51:05] &gt;&gt; because she set her wings that she felt
[51:07] the winds move.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; What have I to dread? What have I to
[51:13] fear? Leaning on the everlasting and
[51:17] winds begin to move.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; And she said her wings
[51:23] &gt;&gt; said, "Yes, Lord. I'll just go where
[51:25] this wind's going to take me cuz what I
[51:27] got to dread. What am I fearing about?
[51:29] You got You got my life in your control.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; You're the master OF THE WIND. AND I
[51:34] KNOW THE MASTER.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; I KNOW THE MASTER OF EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE.
[51:37] I KNOW THE MASTER OF EVERY LIFE.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; That's the reason this lovely little
[51:46] woman sits here and this one back there,
[51:48] they were al alcoholics and narcotic
[51:50] users and dope fiends and so forth. It
[51:52] wasn't because they went to a some
[51:54] anonymous or they did this or they took
[51:56] shots. They didn't do it. They just set
[51:59] their wings of faith in the promises of
[52:01] God. God, you promised and the promise
[52:04] is mine. And here they are TONIGHT IN
[52:06] THE RIGHT MENTAL CONDITION, HEALTHY AND
[52:08] STRONG AND DOPE and whiskey is laying in
[52:10] THE GUTTER.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SOMEBODY SET WINGS.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to rise above it. as I wasn't
[52:20] born to be bound by this nonsense. I
[52:22] wasn't born to be bound by cigarettes
[52:24] and alcohol and drugs AND SEX LIFE. I
[52:27] WASN'T BORN TO BE BOUND BY THAT
[52:28] NONSENSE. I WAS BORN FOR UP [screaming]
[52:30] THERE.
[52:41] I want you to understand eagles, you're
[52:43] not sitting in that same place that
[52:45] brother Brandham saw that eagle sitting
[52:47] in that zoo with a caged up closed up
[52:49] door. No, the door of your cage is open.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; THE DOOR OF YOUR CAGE IS OPEN.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LOCKED NO MORE. THE LOCK OF
[53:02] YOUR CAGE WAS BROKE AT CALVARY
[53:04] &gt;&gt; AND THAT DOOR WAS OPEN. AND YOU DON'T
[53:07] HAVE TO STAY THERE NO MORE. YOU DON'T
[53:09] HAVE TO STAY IN THAT SITUATION NO MORE.
[53:11] YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY IN THAT FEAR NO
[53:13] MORE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY IN THAT
[53:15] EVIL DEVIL THAT WANTS TO HAUNT AT YOU.
[53:17] YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY THERE ANYMORE.
[53:19] YOUR CAGE IS OPEN.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Just take a few hops.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; START FLOPPING SOME WINGS.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; START WALKING OUT OF THERE. START
[53:30] GETTING OUT OF THAT SITUATION. HOW YOU
[53:33] GOING TO DO IT? ONE STEP AT A TIME.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; ONE MOVE AT A TIME. BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW
[53:38] IT, THERE'LL BE CLEAR SKIES IN FRONT OF
[53:40] YOU.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; SEE, that's the reason you're not here.
[53:49] You're not out there, women tonight, as
[53:52] a prostitute on the street. That's the
[53:53] reason, gentlemen, you're not on the
[53:54] streets as a bootleg, a drunkard, is
[53:57] because you set your wings in the
[53:59] promises of God. And by faith, the Holy
[54:02] Ghost lifted you up beyond
[54:04] denominational barriers. Amen.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why you're here
[54:12] tonight.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Because you set your wings in some
[54:15] faith.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the reason why the
[54:20] Liddell family sitting there tonight is
[54:22] because they set their wings in faith.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; They left behind their land. They left
[54:27] behind their home. They left behind
[54:28] their family. They left IT ALL BEHIND.
[54:30] WHY? BECAUSE THEY SAW ANOTHER LAND
[54:32] SOMEWHERE. IT WASN'T this land in
[54:34] Louisiana. IT WAS A LAND BEYOND A RIVER.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT OUR FINAL DESTINATION.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; EVENING LIGHT TABERNACLE IS NOT YOUR
[54:48] FINAL DESTINATION.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOUR FINAL DESTINATION IS WHEN WE
[54:52] LIFT INTO THAT FINAL PLACE AND WE MEET
[54:55] JESUS CHRIST IN THE AIR.
[55:03] HE SAID, "THAT'S why we have this
[55:06] fellowship here tonight, it's because
[55:08] men and women dared to set their wings."
[55:13] He said, "Let me say this to you
[55:14] tonight. The eagle starting her nest."
[55:15] If there's anybody in the building
[55:16] tonight would dare set your wings in
[55:19] God's promises of his word. God will
[55:21] take you from that miserable,
[55:23] unrighteous, ungodly, selfish life
[55:26] you're living and make you free, happy,
[55:29] and able to live above sin.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:39] And live in a blessful atmosphere.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like those kind of atmospheres. a
[55:46] blessful atmosphere that the world and
[55:49] the chickens of the world know nothing
[55:51] about. See, it's not jump from this post
[55:53] to that post to this over here to that
[55:55] over there. I can find it over here. I
[55:58] can find it over there. And I sure I can
[55:59] find happiness over here if I just move
[56:00] over here and this. That ain't what it's
[56:02] all about. Happiness is only found in
[56:04] Christ.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; If you don't find Christ to be the
[56:07] center of your life, I don't care if you
[56:08] live in the most beautiful place upon
[56:10] this earth and have the most money,
[56:11] you'll still not have happiness.
[56:17] It's just setting your wings
[56:20] and your faith wings into the power of
[56:22] the Holy Ghost. When a wave comes in,
[56:25] just ride on it.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Don't refuse it. Don't sit there with
[56:31] your well, you know, it's just I ain't
[56:33] talking about your two hands. I'm
[56:34] talking about spiritually speaking. Just
[56:36] sitting there and not even responding to
[56:38] it.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Are you an eagle or are you a chicken? I
[56:42] can understand a chicken not responding
[56:44] to it because it's never been up there
[56:45] before.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; He's never seen that before. He don't
[56:48] know what it's like. His mama ain't been
[56:49] there. His granddaddy ain't been there.
[56:51] Ain't nobody in his back back in his
[56:53] whole genealogy could do DNA taste for
[56:55] test for weeks and months and send them
[56:57] to all kind of DNA places that never
[56:59] find a chicken that had ever been up
[57:00] there.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Right? So I can understand a chicken not
[57:06] longing to be up there, but I cannot
[57:08] understand if you're a son of God or a
[57:10] daughter of God and the winds of the
[57:12] Holy GHOST BEGIN TO MOVE THAT YOU NOT
[57:14] HAVE SOMETHING THAT'LL RESPOND TO IT.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; You may YOU MAY NOT SHOUT, YOU MAY NOT
[57:20] JUMP, YOU MAY YOU MAY DO NOTHING BUT
[57:22] CRY, BUT WHATEVER IT IS, SOMETHING MOVES
[57:24] ON THE INSIDE OF A SON OR GOD WHEN THEY
[57:27] FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THEIR father move
[57:29] close.
[57:32] That's right.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; You'll ride on up and on up and on up
[57:38] and on up.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; On up and on up and on up until you know
[57:44] you get sick and tired of hearing this
[57:45] chatter chatter here. Days of miracles
[57:47] are passed. Bunch of holy rollers.
[57:50] Nothing to them. Oh, we've heard all
[57:52] that chatter
[57:54] &gt;&gt; from message preachers. Chatter chatter
[57:56] chatter.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; You pine squirrel.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Chatter chatter chatter.
[58:04] Just set your wings in his power.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Set your wings in his P. It ain't our
[58:12] power.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; It ain't the airplane's power. It could
[58:17] have all the engines it want. It's the
[58:19] wings that are adjusted to the wind,
[58:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:25] &gt;&gt; That gets him up into those places.
[58:29] It's the wings that rides him up there.
[58:31] There's a Well, I tell you what, there's
[58:33] a bunch of this and a bunch of fanatics,
[58:34] but he says, "Set them great wings of
[58:36] the holy into the Holy Spirit." That
[58:39] faith wing. Just know how to set them.
[58:41] And when the Holy Spirit begins to move,
[58:44] ride with it.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; The tide comes again, mount up.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; First thing you know, the neighbor
[58:55] saying, "Oh, you're going to be a holy
[58:56] roller. You got you never got healed.
[58:58] YOU YOU JUST RIDE ON PAST ALL THOSE OLD
[59:01] CRITICS SAYING CHATTER here and chatter
[59:02] there. No such a thing as divine
[59:04] healing. No more signs and wonders. NO
[59:06] MORE CHATTER CHATTER CHATTER.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Just turn your head from it and ride on.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Break through the barrier. It's time we
[59:19] break out of normalities.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Maybe this is my NEW YEAR'S MESSAGE.
[59:25] IT'S TIME WE BREAK OUT OF NORMALITIES,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; OUR NORMAL WEDNESDAY NIGHT SERVICE, OUR
[59:30] NORMAL SUNDAY, OUR NORMAL MONDAYS. AMEN.
[59:33] IT'S TIME WE BREAK OUT OF OUR RITUALS.
[59:35] WELL, I I SERVE GOD TODAY. I'VE DONE
[59:37] GOOD. YOU KNOW, there was a man one time
[59:38] that they disappeared at there from
[59:40] church for a few day for a few weekends
[59:42] and they've come back and he said, "What
[59:44] happened to you?" He said, "Well, I've
[59:45] been serving the Lord real hard. I took
[59:46] a few weekends off." That ain't the way
[59:48] it works.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME WE BREAK OUT OF OUR RITUALS.
[59:54] AMEN.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME WE BREAK OUT OF OUR DOUBTS.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME WE BREAK OUT OF OUR UNBELIEF.
[1:00:03] IT'S IT'S TIME WE GET INTO THE
[1:00:04] ATMOSPHERE THAT THE HOLY GHOST WANTS US
[1:00:07] AND DESIRES US TO BE IN WHERE ALL THINGS
[1:00:10] ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:00:12] AMEN.
[1:00:19] Brother said he's told by aviators who
[1:00:21] fly these real fast jet planes.
[1:00:24] They said a plane getting up into a
[1:00:26] certain speed. It begins to vibrate and
[1:00:28] shake.
[1:00:29] Seems like every bolts about to come
[1:00:32] off.
[1:00:35] Maybe some of y'all felt like that
[1:00:36] tonight. What's happening?
[1:00:39] seem like everything's falling apart,
[1:00:40] brother Timothy. Things are happen.
[1:00:42] You're just about to break the barrier.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; The devil's tried everything he can to
[1:00:51] keep you from receiving something from
[1:00:52] God. So, he puts all kinds of things. He
[1:00:54] starts shaking the bolts in your life.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Things are shaking all around you. Seems
[1:00:59] like your house is falling apart. Things
[1:01:01] are happening around. Things are going
[1:01:02] on in your family. What's going on,
[1:01:03] brother? You about to break the barrier.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; What's happening, brother Timothy? Seem
[1:01:08] like the further we go, the behinder we
[1:01:10] get.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Seems like they don't understand that,
[1:01:13] but that'll be revealed later.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Seemed like things are happening. It's
[1:01:19] so nervous. SOMEONE NERVOUS, TOO. WE ARE
[1:01:21] ABOUT TO BREAK THE SOUND BARRIER.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; THIS BRIDE IS ABOUT TO BREAK FROM THIS
[1:01:27] DIMENSION INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. We're about to get out of here.
[1:01:34] THIS IS WHAT IS GOING ON. THIS IS WHAT
[1:01:36] IS HAPPENING. WHAT TENSIONS ARE RISING.
[1:01:38] THINGS ARE HAPPENING. THERE'S ALL KINDS
[1:01:39] OF THINGS GOING ON IN this earth. Yeah,
[1:01:41] there is.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; All creation is groaning.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Free us.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; This earth is groaning. Free me.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; I wasn't MEANT TO BE DESTROYED LIKE
[1:01:55] THIS. I WASN'T MEANT, AMEN. FOR THINGS
[1:01:57] TO HAPPEN LIKE IT'S HAPPEN. THIS WASN'T
[1:01:59] MEANT TO BE.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; It is groaning. It is wanting. IT IS
[1:02:03] DESIRE. WHAT'S HAPPENING? IT'S ABOUT TO
[1:02:05] BREAK THE SOUND BARRIER.
[1:02:07] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN FACING FEAR. YOU'VE BEEN
[1:02:10] FACING ANXIETIES. YOU'VE BEEN FACING
[1:02:12] DEPRESSION LIKE NEVER BEFORE. YOU'RE
[1:02:14] ABOUT TO BREAK THE SOUND BARRIER.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; I texted A BROTHER ON MY WAY OUT HERE. I
[1:02:21] SAID, "I'VE NEVER FOUGHT DEPRESSION LIKE
[1:02:23] I FOUGHT IT TODAY." YOU'RE ABOUT TO
[1:02:25] BREAK THE SOUND BARRIER.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE DEVIL IS TRYING TO KEEP YOU
[1:02:30] BOUND. HE'S TRYING TO KEEP YOU DOWN. HE
[1:02:32] HE'S TRYING TO KEEP YOU IN A IN A
[1:02:34] STRUGGLE. HE'S TRYING TO KEEP YOU ALL
[1:02:36] ANXIETY AND ALL FEARFUL. WHAT? WHAT?
[1:02:38] WHY? CUZ HE KNOWS THAT WHEN YOU GET past
[1:02:40] that barrier, THERE'S NO COMING BACK.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU GET PAST THAT
[1:02:48] SITUATION, when you get past that thing
[1:02:51] in your LIFE AND YOU BREAK THROUGH IT, I
[1:02:54] WON'T [screaming] GO BACK.
[1:03:01] SO, I'M TOLD, feels like the boats are
[1:03:03] about to fly out, the wings are about to
[1:03:06] come off. How many's ever been an
[1:03:08] airplane in some good turbulence?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; How many enjoys that?
[1:03:14] I do not.
[1:03:17] That's the time I'm longing for firm
[1:03:19] terracotta
[1:03:22] ground.
[1:03:28] All of a sudden, you're just sitting
[1:03:29] there and enjoying something, you know,
[1:03:31] listening to tape or whatever you're
[1:03:33] doing, talking to somebody, and the
[1:03:36] bottom falls out.
[1:03:39] Peace of God, cover me.
[1:03:45] It makes a lot of Christians on a plane
[1:03:47] really quick.
[1:03:50] You hear all kind, oh, God.
[1:03:58] We we was coming home from overseas and
[1:04:01] had to make about three laps around
[1:04:02] shreport. They tried to land in some 60
[1:04:05] mph winds right as it was coming into
[1:04:07] the edge of that storm. Me and Sister
[1:04:09] Ruth was on that plane together
[1:04:12] and we wasn't sitting together but we
[1:04:14] was on the plane together because of
[1:04:15] some situation in our seating. But
[1:04:17] anyway,
[1:04:19] it felt like the bolts was about to fall
[1:04:21] out of this thing. It felt like the
[1:04:23] wings were about to break off. It felt
[1:04:25] like this thing was about to be pushed
[1:04:27] in the cross lake there as it come
[1:04:28] across. It was I thought it was over.
[1:04:32] People were screaming. People were
[1:04:33] saying all kinds of things. All I was
[1:04:36] saying is pull up.
[1:04:40] We don't have to land. Pull up.
[1:04:45] He pulled back up and we had to circle
[1:04:47] several times and several times and
[1:04:49] through ground clouds and I I say save
[1:04:51] the picture on the screen that that I
[1:04:53] that I got from the aviation app and and
[1:04:55] just unbelievable going around all this
[1:04:57] stuff. We made it obviously safely.
[1:05:02] Never felt so glad to be on the ground.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it feels like when you're up
[1:05:08] there it seems like what's going to
[1:05:10] happen next? What's going going on?
[1:05:14] Just keep riding it.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Just keep adjusting your wings of faith.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Seems like it's all falling apart.
[1:05:21] Brother Timothy, just keep just keep
[1:05:23] them out there.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; That wind is not meant for your
[1:05:27] destruction.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; It's meant for you to rise.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; It's meant for that that that wind
[1:05:34] that's been coming against you and it's
[1:05:35] been hammering at you time after time.
[1:05:38] It's meant for you to rise above it. To
[1:05:41] rise above it. HE SAID, "IF THE PLANE
[1:05:43] JUST SAILS on out and get past all of
[1:05:46] that, it'll be at ease when it passes
[1:05:48] that sound barrier, the obstacle that it
[1:05:50] had in its way, it passes it and it'll
[1:05:52] run at ease." This if the church of this
[1:05:54] day will ever pray till it passes the
[1:05:57] sin barrier and the unbelief barrier,
[1:05:59] they would shout the victory of a living
[1:06:02] God because they are now LOOKING TO THE
[1:06:04] UNSEEN.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT LOOKING TO WHAT THEY SEE
[1:06:07] AROUND THEM. THEY'RE NOT LOOKING TO HOW
[1:06:09] THE WORLD IS VIBRATING AND THINGS ARE
[1:06:11] GOING ON OR WHAT IT'S DOING OR WHAT IT'S
[1:06:13] NOT DOING. THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR God
[1:06:16] and how he has it all in his control.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; There is a living God. And when we lose
[1:06:23] our disbelief, we pass that place. The
[1:06:26] world is saying the days of miracles are
[1:06:28] pass. And it wants to make you shake.
[1:06:31] Oh, there's no such a thing as the
[1:06:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it makes
[1:06:34] you wonder. But if you'll ever look to
[1:06:36] the unseen, to the God who promised it,
[1:06:40] for the promise is unto you
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; and to your children, to them that are
[1:06:44] far off, even as many as the Lord our
[1:06:46] God shall call. If you look to the
[1:06:48] blessed word that says Jesus Christ is
[1:06:50] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[1:06:52] and turn your heads towards that, and
[1:06:54] press on until you pass that vibration,
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; get past it. That's right.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Past that vibration, past that unbelief,
[1:07:04] past that sin, past that barrier, then
[1:07:07] you'll fly free in the faith of Almighty
[1:07:10] God, knowing that all things are
[1:07:12] possible. There is no limit to the speed
[1:07:16] that plane will go. They say hardly, if
[1:07:18] there's no limit to the speed of a
[1:07:19] plane, there's no limits to the
[1:07:21] blessings of God that'll pour down on
[1:07:24] you if you will believe.
[1:07:28] See, God does did not just promise
[1:07:31] wings, he provided wings.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; He told Israel in Exodus chapter 19 and
[1:07:38] verse4, he says, "Ye have seen what I
[1:07:40] did unto the Egyptians and how I bear
[1:07:43] you on eagle's wings.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; I I bear you on eagle's wings and
[1:07:50] brought you unto myself." Notice what
[1:07:52] God said. I bear you
[1:07:55] ISRAEL DID NOT WALK OUT OF EGYPT on
[1:07:57] their own strength.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; They were carried out.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Timothy, they use their
[1:08:03] own feet. THEY THEY WERE CARRIED OUT BY
[1:08:06] THE SUPERNATURAL POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD
[1:08:08] CUZ THEY HAD NOT A BIT OF POWER TO FREE
[1:08:10] THEMSELVES.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; No more than anybody else HAS A BIT OF
[1:08:14] POWER TO FREE THEMSELVES FROM SIN AND
[1:08:17] UNBELIEF OR ANY OTHER DEMON OF HELL. BUT
[1:08:19] THERE IS A POWER.
[1:08:21] THERE IS ONE GREATER AND HE CAN BEAR YOU
[1:08:24] ON HIS WINGS TONIGHT.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; They were carried before Israel knew how
[1:08:29] to trust God. God was already
[1:08:31] trustworthy. Before they knew what
[1:08:32] freedom was, God had already secured it.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; They didn't even know what freedom
[1:08:37] really was. And God had already gave it
[1:08:40] to them. Before they ever learned
[1:08:41] obedience, God had already lifted them
[1:08:43] out of their bondage.
[1:08:45] What was it? Grace.
[1:08:48] And Jesus comes along in the New
[1:08:50] Testament. He tries to show them I was
[1:08:52] the one who did this. This was me when
[1:08:54] he said even as a hen gather her
[1:08:57] chickens under her wings.
[1:09:00] That's what the hen does when predators
[1:09:01] are around. They they gather these
[1:09:03] little chickies under their wings. They
[1:09:04] bring them under. He was saying, "I am
[1:09:07] the God who carried you out of Egypt."
[1:09:10] What was it? At the cross, CHRIST
[1:09:13] STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS. It was THE
[1:09:16] ULTIMATE WINGS OF MERCY.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT WAS IT TO CARRY US OUT OF OUR
[1:09:21] SIN? TO CARRY US OUT OF OUR SHAME, TO
[1:09:24] CARRY US OUT OF OUR DEATH.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; God put forth his wings for us to carry
[1:09:31] us.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; And he said, "It is finished."
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; When he said it was finished, it broke
[1:09:40] every veil.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; It broke the denominational veil. It
[1:09:43] broke the veil there in the in in the
[1:09:45] temple. It broke every sound barrier.
[1:09:47] The sound that says, "Oh, that's
[1:09:49] fanaticism." He broke through that. The
[1:09:50] sound that says, "Oh, them people are
[1:09:52] crazy." He broke right through that veil
[1:09:54] that says, "You can't do it. You'll
[1:09:55] never obtain it." The message ain't for
[1:09:57] you. He broke through that veil. He
[1:09:58] broke There's no such thing as healing,
[1:10:00] divine healing. He broke right through
[1:10:02] that. Why? The word said he would.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; He spread those WINGS AND HE BROKE
[1:10:06] through it. Amen. What was it here? HE
[1:10:09] STANDS TONIGHT, THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR
[1:10:11] SINCE. HE BROKE EVERY VEIL. HE STANDS
[1:10:14] TONIGHT AMONG YOU UNCONQUERED BY
[1:10:16] TRADITIONS.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Let people say WHAT THEY WANT TO, DO
[1:10:20] WHAT THEY WANT TO, SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO
[1:10:22] DO. GOD COMES BREAKING RIGHT DOWN
[1:10:24] THROUGH EVERY SOUND BARRIER.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; They can say WE'RE NOTHING BUT A BUNCH
[1:10:29] OF EMOTIONAL PENTECOSTAL, WHATEVER THEY
[1:10:31] WANT TO CALL US, BUT GOD BREAKS THE
[1:10:34] SOUND BARRIER.
[1:10:36] You tell me if IT WAS JUST A BUNCH OF
[1:10:38] EMOTION THAT SAVED A MAN FROM CIGARETTES
[1:10:40] AND DRINKING AND TURNED HIS LIFE AROUND
[1:10:42] AND TURNING HIS FAMILY AROUND.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T EMOTION. THAT WAS THE POWER
[1:10:46] OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT BLEW THROUGH THIS
[1:10:49] BUILDING.
[1:10:51] [applause]
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; What was it? HE BROKE THE BARRIER.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; He broke the cage.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; And he showed him, "You're free.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; You're free.
[1:11:04] He said, "Remember, there's no limit.
[1:11:07] I'm telling you, when you break the
[1:11:09] traditional bar barriers,
[1:11:12] break the traditional barriers." There's
[1:11:14] a lot of traditional barriers in this
[1:11:16] message
[1:11:18] made by men. Barriers. Put speed limits
[1:11:22] up. Only want so much to happen. Only
[1:11:26] want service to go so far.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Put barriers up on how long you can
[1:11:32] preach. make fun of you when you preach
[1:11:34] law. Right? Come on.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Put barriers. It's putting barriers up.
[1:11:40] It's limitless.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. I'm not preaching all night
[1:11:45] tonight, but it's limitless.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; It's limitless.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; We serve an unlimited God.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; It's limitless. Amen. And he said, "IF
[1:11:57] WE CAN BREAK THE traditional barriers,
[1:12:00] well, forget about just blanket
[1:12:03] statement. What about your own barriers?
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; What about your TRADITIONAL HABITS THAT
[1:12:07] YOU DO AND HOW YOU OPERATE?" WHY DON'T
[1:12:09] YOU START SAYING, "GOD, I WANT ALL MY
[1:12:11] BARRIERS BROKE."
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; WHERE I'VE HELD BACK, WHERE I'VE STOPPED
[1:12:16] FOR JUST A MOMENT. BREAK THOSE THINGS.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE FREE. WHEN YOUR SPIRIT
[1:12:20] MOVES, I WANT TO MOVE [applause]
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU COME. I WANT TO BE COGNATE. I
[1:12:24] WANT TO BE AN ANTICIPATION AND EXPECTING
[1:12:27] GOD TO MOVE EVERYTHING FOR HIS glory and
[1:12:30] for his might.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; There's no limit to what God could do
[1:12:34] right here in this service and show the
[1:12:36] world what they need. Amen. It's not a
[1:12:39] world's fair. He said it's a world
[1:12:40] revival to be filled in baptism of the
[1:12:42] pri presence of the living God. Listen,
[1:12:45] I'm not even worried about a world
[1:12:46] revival. I want a revival in this
[1:12:48] church. I WANT A REVIVAL IN THESE LIVES.
[1:12:51] I WANT A REVIVAL ON THESE YOUNG PEOPLE.
[1:12:53] I WANT A REV BIBLE IN THESE OLD FOLKS.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Some of us old folks, we get to where we
[1:13:05] don't move very much and we start
[1:13:07] creaking and groaning and carrying on.
[1:13:09] Don't let that become your spiritual
[1:13:11] attitude.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Every time the spirit of moves, all we
[1:13:14] hear is going, [laughter]
[1:13:18] "Oh, not that again. Not that quote
[1:13:20] again. Not that. I don't I done heard
[1:13:22] that song how many times? I got
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; No, no. We're breaking traditional
[1:13:28] barriers.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; We want this thing moving at freedom
[1:13:31] speed.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, I believe it broke
[1:13:37] every barrier, every veil, every veil.
[1:13:41] Nothing can hide from his presence. When
[1:13:43] people gets a hunger in their heart,
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; a hunger in their heart,
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; for more,
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; NOT SATISFIED WITH JUST ANOTHER ANOTHER
[1:13:56] SERVICE, NOT SATISFIED WITH JUST LAST
[1:13:58] SERVICE, BUT A HUNGER FOR SOMETHING IN
[1:14:00] THEIR HEART. THERE'S A VEIL THAT'S READY
[1:14:03] TO BE BROKE.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN JUST DEPEND ON IT.
[1:14:08] READ EVERY VEIL BY HIS GREAT HOLY
[1:14:09] SPIRIT. And here HE STANDS TONIGHT. HE'S
[1:14:13] THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR. HE'S THE SAME
[1:14:15] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. HE'S
[1:14:17] STILL HEALING THE SICK. HE'S STILL
[1:14:19] BAPTIZING THE BELIEVERS JUST AS HE
[1:14:21] ALWAYS DID. HE IS THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; HE IS THE MIGHTY CONQUEROR. AND LISTEN
[1:14:28] TO THIS NEXT STATEMENT. DEVIL DOOMED
[1:14:31] devils are on the run.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HE DIDN'T JUST SAY DEVILS
[1:14:38] ARE ON THE RUN. HE SAID, "DOOMED
[1:14:40] DEVILS."
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Let me just serve some notice on the
[1:14:44] devil right now. You devil of
[1:14:46] depression, you're doomed. You devil of
[1:14:48] fear, you're doomed. You devil of
[1:14:49] sickness, you're doomed. You devil
[1:14:51] that's holding our children, you're
[1:14:52] doomed. [applause]
[1:14:56] HALLELUJAH. YOU DEVIL OF CANCER THAT
[1:14:58] HOLD RON SPENCER, YOU'RE DOOMED.
[1:15:01] [applause]
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE IS A POWER. THERE IS A
[1:15:05] FAITH. THERE'S WINGS THAT CAN RISE ABOVE
[1:15:08] IT ALL.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Doomed devils are on the run. He is the
[1:15:17] mighty conqueror and they are always on
[1:15:20] the run when he's around.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; That's why we want him at every service.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; That's why we want him in our homes.
[1:15:32] Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; That's why we want him in our office at
[1:15:35] work. That's why we want him in our
[1:15:37] daily lives. That's why we want him
[1:15:39] every moment of we we're awake or we're

[1:37:34] and the mountains be shenen,
[1:37:38] I know I'm not [music and singing]
[1:37:40] forsaken.
[1:37:42] You are with me every step [music]
[1:37:46] that I [singing] take. Oh, I don't have
[1:37:50] to worry. [music]
[1:37:53] I know your head will guide me. You are
[1:37:58] with Jesus. [music]
[1:38:01] You [singing] will never leave me.
[1:38:05] Mountain [music] tops arise.
[1:38:09] God, [singing] I know that you are with
[1:38:13] [music] me. I'll keep holding [singing]
[1:38:17] to your promise.
[1:38:21] All I [music] leave is darkness.
[1:38:24] God, I [singing] know
[1:38:27] you are with me.
