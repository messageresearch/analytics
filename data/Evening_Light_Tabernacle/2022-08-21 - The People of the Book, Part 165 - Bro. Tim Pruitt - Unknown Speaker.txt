strength is still very very weak from battling the covet virus we also want to remember a man by the name of ryan penny is recovering from having a detached retina the dexter family put that in sister mary requested that we pray for him so we want to remember that young man this morning amen those that are still [Music] sick in body and just fighting through the seasons of the flu and the various viruses that are out there amen we want to pray that the fire of the holy ghost would just surround him and burn it up there is a holy fire that does eradicate all sin all sickness all disease and i

morning and we know there's freedom in his presence there's healing in his presence there's deliverance in his presence and whatever you have need of this morning we can take our knee before the throne of grace and know that the god that we serve he declared to us that he will withhold no good thing to them that walk uprightly so let's take these knees and your knees to the lord this morning let's also just remember those that will be traveling back from the ohio camp the bus with all our our kids on it they have had us just a tremendous time a tremendous outpouring of the holy spirit there and i believe when they come back they're going to revolutionize our church some of you may have gotten a little bit cold some of you may have got a little bit you know kind of stuck in the rut but they're going to come back and loosen you up a little bit because there's been a supernatural experience take place some i've heard has had an outer body experience well they've never done it before but they found themselves before the throne of grace worshipping almighty god and hearing angelic songs being sung i'm here to testify get ready get ready get ready because you're young people coming back different your young people come up some of those that came that went with rebellion some of those that went with depression some of those that went with anxieties they're going to come back free they're kind of you better prepare yourself for freedom you better prepare yourself for the change we didn't send them to come back the same but i'm here to tell you god met him and that

you're the same god lord we're at attention we're here to receive from the hand of almighty god and lord we know that the word would declare you withhold no good thing from us so pour out your spirit

the old familiar markers of the mercies i have known i know it may sound simple but it's more than i can explain there's no other words to tell you than to say god's been good in my life i've been blessed beyond my wildest dreams as i go to sleep each night sure i've had my heart share of hard times by my side he's always stood through it all god's been good times replaying i can see when we

i've been blessed beyond my wildest dreams as i go to sleep each night sure i've had my share of hard times by my side he's always stood through it all god's been good god has been my father he's my savior and my friend his love was my beginning and his love will be mine and i could spend forever trying to tell you everything is but the best way i can say it is this god's been good in my life and i've been blessed beyond my wildest dreams as i come asleep each night sure i've had my share of hard times by my side he's always stood through it all god's been good singing with me this time oh

testify that he's good all the time amen and all the time he's good we sure love the lord today love and appreciate you and thank you for being here and being a part of the service today those of you that are listening in as well we're so happy to be able to greet you in the name of the lord jesus amen looking to the lord today just to minister to hearts and lives and reveal his self to us amen may he do that i'll tell you what i'm just going to read the scripture and then we'll have prayer um let's go to genesis 18 and verse 1 and i'm going to read from this passage of scripture and then we'll go to the lord in prayer and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tenth door and bowed himself to toward the ground and said my lord if i have now if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree so let's just talk to the lord father we love you and we thank you for your many blessings to us the grace of god that is upon our lives the mercies that endure forever the healing power of god that is going forth as we speak and reaching down into homes that where there are those that are sick some of them sick with coveted flu other situations lord some some are away because they've been traveling or are gone lord and unable to be here today but lord we are here and you are here and there's more than two or three but lord there's a good number of us here today and we're looking to you to minister to hearts and lives as we thank you for ever blessing in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated may the lord add his blessings to his word i i have a testimony today from brother eric wilson from south africa and now these uh i just want to explain a little bit about them you know they are they're people that have a church that they support and and minister at and they're not a part of a personality cult we don't receive any money from them but after their service is over they just like to come and be a part of the worldwide audience as we edify the body of christ and i just want you to see the impact that you're having upon people around the world and families and churches and and others and while i'm doing this let me just take before i play his his um greetings and testimony today i want to greet brother buzz bozey a pastor and missionary to uganda and ethiopia he's listening in with his family today and they send their greetings to you and the audience here that is listening in and also greetings to pastor john gosam from ghana who's also a part of our audience and listens to every service these are pastors men of god many of them have been ministers for many years but um they they are edified and built up and strengthened and encouraged by the ministry and by the word the lord and by your worship to god and so also there no doubt today down in south texas brother buster wiggins and the saints there we'd like to greet them as they um are without a pastor in that little small work in that area they're part of our audience and those down in beaumont as well and different other places or shut-ins like brother and sister hollis are listening in so we can send greetings to you brother and sister hollis we love you and look forward to the time she told me the other day brother tim we want to try to get together and just come back to church one more time at least once more amen so they're they're wonderful people we love them and appreciate them and then there are other elderly and other states unable to attend church like brother bill sister johnny mayo that we baptized recently and they join with us forever service so we send greetings to them and you know i i think of sometimes um you know the impact that we can have upon the bride of christ worldwide and the responsibility that we have of taking the message around the world and as many times people will say well what about the missionary outreach well we do missionary outreach but this in itself is a missionary outreach i can preach in this pulpit and minister to more people than if i flew overseas and preached in a convention and uh you know when reaching many different places and uh and and did uh and and reached out into different places away from from this very pulpit but anyway my thoughts go to a little sister in england she's now deceased but one day they were down praying her and her friend knew nothing of the message and they were just down praying and the spirit of god fell upon the man and the holy spirit spoke and said the deep calleth unto the deep and and you know after prayer they looked at each other and said well what does that mean so they looked in the bible and they found you know in the bible the deep calls to the deep and then they put it in the internet you know uh deep cult to the deep and uh that led them to um to brother bischo's church and and so as they tuned in that day i was preaching and so they took my name and they began to follow me everywhere that i ministered and preached and back home in our own home pulpit and they would stay up till two o'clock in the morning just to tune in and listen and um you know so again those are souls that we would have never reached except that god has made a way that that the gospel could go into all the world by means of the internet and so this is what ends up blessing the people this now this sister's done going on to be with the lord but you know who knows the impact that we we will have on that day when we will meet people and realize that we have a positive influence upon others lives and their lives were changed because of the gospel of jesus christ so i'm going to let brother um brother eric wilson from south africa i think he's from the cape area that he's going to greet you now and and speak to you i just thought it was noteworthy and asked his permission can i can i let the church hear you speak today so brother eric god bless you and your wife and children and the saints that are gathered there with you tonight because it's night over there god bless you amen good afternoon pastor pruitt god bless you this is brother eddie from psalms at west cape town it is a good day today god is good to us and he has been very faithful many times we tend to be unfaithful but it's because of the faithfulness of god that we are life and wealth we really thank god for his grace and for his mercy and for the change that he's brought in our lives we were just today we were in church and we had a great time in the presence of god and the anointing of god and how god touched the people in church and i was reminded of what you said to me a few months ago that it is not the monastery that packs the revival in his suitcase wherever you are god can wherever you are god can actually use you through you i mean if you you you the person that it's the people that brings the revival and this morning we saw how god brought about the revival in our church in amongst the people and i'm very sure and convinced that it is where you eat and how you eat the word that's been ministered to you the five-fold ministry of god that is edifying us as us people here in south africa and uh it's amazing the the other night we we went for the youth meeting and brother aaron he ministered at evening light tabernacle and you know the the the the message that he brought was so inspiring it it touched my heart to such an extent that i said lord how can i preach this to the people and i said lord let me just play the video and all of us the young people we would listen and the presence of god came down and you just see all the young people going to the altar and desiring prayer and desiring a touch from god and god is so good to us this week we were inside and two o'clock in the morning we woke up with the songs and praises and then we realized it was a children that's actually streaming the young people and the convention that they have the meetings that the young people have it is so amazing and it's so wonderful to know that the change that god brought about in our people's lives and last week we were listening to your message as you preached and we had a family here and we had the pastor's wife over here and the people they could not even they didn't want to go because of the the presence of almighty god and you realize that how great god is and and what god is doing for us and my heart is once again so thankful and and and so overwhelmed to know that god has brought us to a place where we can listen to messages from evening light tabernacle and people that is theirs and i don't want you to take it wrong but it's role models when we look at the young people we it's role models when we look at the ministers where we can say lord god that's what you've done in their life we want that life we want that god that's in them that's changed them and you can actually see the difference that's what we desire and this is what god has graciously granted to us that we can only go and say thank you lord for your grace and for your mercies we see the change in our people and we see you know how they worshipping god the way the young people worshipping god and the the the life they start to live and and how god has changed us we really want to thank god for you and thank you and the ministers at evening light tabernacle for availing yourself for god to work through you god bless you richly and we really appreciate you all and we're looking forward to the service we we're preparing ourselves looking forward because it's something that we cannot miss god is really touching us god bless you all greet the family and greet the church amen hallelujah you see it isn't about us for no more it is not even is not at all about a personality cult that you follow after it's getting in love with jesus amen and and serving the lord with all of your heart and so we greet all of these brethrens wherever they are and i know there's many many more and i'm sorry i i can't um call every name and every person um because um you know there's even there has even been those that have asked me brother tim you know when you preach well you just call my name too amen but we love you and we appreciate you and and we thank the lord for what he's doing in lives and hearts and around the world and you see like i said it's not just about us it's about a bride around the world as a as he said he'd have a bride out of every nation kindred tongue tribe or people now you know many of these that well just about many of most all of these that i've mentioned especially from overseas i've never even met never had the privilege to shake their hand but you know god has stirred their hearts and moving in their lives and and in some way we can be an oak tree and a little bit of encouragement for them to be able to take and find rest under our shape for a little bit and uh help them in life's journey uh to be a greater christian to be ready for the coming of the lord you say well brother tim why would you even be interested in anybody else but your own little group and only all because you see if god has a people and they are people out of every kindred tongue tribe and nation well uh no matter how rapture ready that i am i can't go without them so therefore i want to see them dressed in the word of god and and walking in with god like enoch walked with god's i have an interest in other people and other needs and you know there are there is great mission work that is can be done and every bit of your mission money that you give and and whatever we put in a mission fund and i don't always tell you where it goes but it goes for the work of the lord we have done different things with it um printing books um right now we're still just regularly getting maybe two sermons a week in in the japanese language that is now going on the message hub where you know where there were there was nothing there and now the message is going there and we're just now supporting our missionary brother danny del mundo to go into japan there and hold some services so you know it's going to be some tremendous times that they're looking forward to and we've uh we've helped to to get those tickets and and finance some of that because you know right now it takes three shots to go into japan and uh you know other stringent regulations so they're just now barely opening up you got to have a shot and a booster and a booster and um you know right now i don't even feel like being boosted and so you know you know if you can't go you send someone and so we have confidence in brother danny del mundo from the philippines to go over there and to share the word of god and they also listen in many times to the services of god bless them too now so again you know we were speaking about being an oak tree i just wanted you to just get a little glimpse you know just a little window into some of the lives there and the situations and needs and and the hearts that are being touched now today i'm going to be speaking on a restored tree with restored fruits and as and some of this i'm going to reiterate and i'm going to expand and expound upon and uh so don't feel like that i'm old and have alzheimer's and forgot what i preached before uh or didn't have time to study because i put a lot of effort into this and um so we we daily just commit ourselves to the lord and to the study of the word and and uh those that know me know that i spend countless of hours into that because i i want to be right and i want you prepared to meet the lord and the appearance of god in this last day of course we know will will be under the bride tree amen and it's not a leafless tree but it's a tree where the holy spirit is welcomed where saints run to meet him and bow to worship him but to do this we must have a restored tree under whose shade jehovah comes to abide now i'd like to just get a couple of more scriptures that we have read but just to just place where we're at in the bible so joel 1 and 4 that which the palmer worm is left at the locust eaten that which the locust has left have to can't go where i'm eating that which the canker worm is left have the caterpillar eaten then verse 25 of chapter two and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the kenko worm the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that it dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed then i would like to bring a couple of verses out of psalms 80 and verse 8 thou has brought a vine out of egypt thou has cast out the heathen and planted it thou has prepared a room before it and did his cause it to take deep root and it filled the land now like i said i i didn't really finish my thought last sunday of under the oak tree and and i'm going to go back over some points clarify some things or make it more clear rather more than clarify because i didn't say anything wrong that i found but the israel was a vine that could never be fruitful until it was planted back into his promised land of inheritance and until then it would just produce the naughty fruits and bitter fruits of slavery now brother branham tells us in gabriel's instruction to daniel he said god never dealt with israel till she came to her her homeland and hear me thus saith the lord god will not deal with the church till she comes back to the homeland the message of the hour come back to the original get away from your methodist baptist presbyterian ideas your pentecostal assemblies oneness threeness fiveness whatever it is church god nazarene pilgrim holiness church of christ all antichrist movement and i realize this strikes the world all wrong all of the devil there's godly men and every one of them godly people and every one of them movements by the way you were there but you got pulled out of there by hearing the voices that come out of her my people there's godly men and every one of them godly people and every one of them movements but the organization in itself is not of god and god will never bless it he never has done it so you see you know there are many things that has um that kind of gets mixed with the message satan is a great hybrider he always comes along and when the original comes he comes along and tries to figure out a way to hybrid it by bringing in the creeds and ideas of other past movements and try to mix it and you know cross-pollinate and try to you know mix up the fruit and so it's a baptist creed to say that you receive the holy ghost when you believe the message and it is it's the same as it is and the zoos of pentecostal creed to say you receive the holy ghost when you shout dance or speak in tongues you see all of that is incorrect and you will never grow real christ-like fruit in that kind of soil you must be planted in the homeland and the homeland is the word of god not many people are afraid of being identified it seems like it's really taboo and i understand why but you know to be identified as an azusa pentecostal branch so and you know in in opposition to that they become a baptist branch which is a whole lot less scriptural and several church changes behind the azusa vine you know we but we want to be neither a baptist branch or an azusa branch because those with that fruit will be cut off amen and it'll be thrown into the fire of tribulation we want to be the original genuine branch as the church as it was on the day of pentecost to receive of the blessings and the fullness of god for a rapture we must be planted in the homeland of the open book and the fullness of the word that came by its opening now in gabriel's instructions to daniel brother branham tells again god never blesses israel until she gets out of her homeland he'll never bless you as a baptist or methodist or presbyterian catholic or pilgrim holiness nazarene church of god pentecostal organization will never bless you that way come back to the homeland to the beginning back to the pentecostal experience like happened on the day of pentecost when the power of the living god changed those thousands of people and set their hearts aflame with the fire of god that showed genuine not impersonating signs not made up telepathy not some mockery he goes on to say he wants us back to the truth back to the spirit back to the right life back to the highway in christ back to truth how can he bless us the way we go he won't he never blessed israel until they came back to the promised land and when they got back in the promised land signs of wonders begin to happen hallelujah again he he says in the 70th week back to the message brother back to the the original back to pentecost back to the real blessing back to the name of jesus christ back to the baptism of the holy ghost baptist signs and wonders back to pentecost away with organizations back to the holy ghost so these are things that he would would become a theme of his and he would integrate and reintegrate over and over again now let us review psalms 80 and verse 7 again and i just want to look at some of this as we go along because i think it's as brother braden preached from this on planting the vine and word of planet that he uses this scripture and he places us right here in these in these verses so i want you just to see it it says restore to us or turn again oh god a host god almighty make your face to shine upon us that we may be saved you transplanted a vine from his from egypt you drove out the nations and you you planted it and then he said you cleared the ground for it it took root and it filled the land the mountains were covered with its shades mighty cedars with its branches the its branches reached as far as the sea it shoots as far as the river why have you broken down its walls so that all that passed by to pick its greats bores from the forest ravages and insects from the fields that's the cankle worm the caterpillar the palma worm and the locust is eat it's fed on it and and devours it return unto us oh god almighty amen look down from the heavens and see what's over this line the root of your right hand now notice right hand is power so the hand of your power and he said has planted so your hand of power has planted the root the sun you raised up for yourself now the root was christ so god through his power raised up christ and and he is the son that god raised up and god planted this tree and he is determined to have a family to have branches on his vine he is the root and he's going to have branches and remember it's not the root bearing the fruit is the branches bearing the fruit so now he goes on to say because of them being taken down to babylon and the and the because of their sins your vine is cut down it is burned with fire you're at your rebuke to be your people perish and um so like israel the church was cut down all the way to mystery babylon so i want you to think the same thing is happening now to israel happens to the church they were hauled down to babylon but the church has been hauled down to mystery babylon so you see her in the in the book of revelation say and he is saying come out of her my people it's the call to come back to the homeland now so he says again but because he says i will restore and here he tells us how he's going to do it now he has talked about restoration in all of these verses but now he's going to tell how he's going to do it verse 17 let your hand your power rest upon the man of at your right hand the son of man that you have raised up for yourself so the son of man is the holy spirit you see it's the prophet of the hour that anointed the seventh angel to prophesy and the same holy spirit makes us prophesy again so god's power would be upon the prophet notice it would be the power of god upon the prophet and the prophet is a prophetic anointing he himself is not a prophet he's a son of man revealing the son of man so now notice it's a god's power now upon the prophet and the church who is a prophetical class of people now for this restoration is gonna have to be more than a reformation it will take a prophetic anointing the son of man christ would manifest itself for himself as a prophetic anointing and that's a particular anointing now i want you to i want you to get it because it is an anointing when you look at the elijah ministry that's the anointing of christ upon a ministry when you see again an elisha group that follows elijah come on that is the ministry of christ continuing on again when you look at revelation 10 uh revelation 10 1 the mighty angel that is an anointing coming down that is not that is not the physical return of christ it is his anointing coming down to produce a work of restoration in the last days so again i want to i want to just give you a few snippets now i'm going to use a lot of snippets as it was because i can't read all the quotes in in their context but i'm going to just pull out you know just a few little sentences here and there and i'll let you know but this is what i'm we are expecting that great anointing upon the church that will turn the hearts back to the original doctrine of the father's back to real genuine pentecost again he says because we find in the scripture in malachi 4 that there is to be an anointing come down and to restore that original faith and to bring the faith of the people back to the original pentecost the faith of the fathers again he says to restore what the faith of the people back to the original fathers the pentecostal doctrine the original fathers and he will restore the people back to the fathers so understand the anointing of christ would be called the spirit of elijah that was the spirit of christ upon elijah amen upon elisha upon john the baptist a man upon william branham brother branham amen upon the elijah to the jews it wouldn't be a reincarnation of a man nor his spirit but the spirit of the lord that was identified with elijah as he turned the hearts of the children back or the hearts of israel back to the faith in jehovah again now this elijah would have a job of restoration remember it would be done through this through the man that right hand upon a man your hand of power upon a man he would be a son of man he would be we call him in this the scripture the son of man but so this son of man is christ so just to make sure you understand it's a son of man but again it is the manifestation of the spirit of christ for our day now and so you see the elijah would have a job of restoration like the original elijah so talk with me to first kings 18 let's look at verse 30 and elijah said unto the all the people come near unto me and the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the of the sons of jacob up upon unto whom the word the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with stones he built the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord he made a treats about the altar as greatest would contain two measures of seed now i want you just to look back at verse 30 and i want you to see he prepared or he repaired the altar he did not build a new altar he did not bring a new doctrine now the message we have received is not something new it is the doctrine of the apostles and prophets it is what paul preached brother tim we have more than what old paul preached no we don't this is a restoration back to the faith of the fathers we do not have a message different from paul that would place us under a curse see galatians 1 and 8 says though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have received uh preached and you let him be a curse and athema amen so as we've said before now here comes the double curse of galatians 1 9 now the devil curse as we said before say so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that which you'll receive let him be accursed so there is a double curse upon people who who are preached something different than what paul preached now so there can be no additions or any subtractions to the bible amen revelation 20 22 18 for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add to these things god shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of this book of prophecy say christ isn't the same say days of miracles are passed say you know we don't get the holy ghost like they did on the day of pentecost all of these say god shall take his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things that are written in this book my it's a it is an absolute curse to preach anything different one from what paul preached come on now i granted there were symbols in the book of revelation and yeah it wasn't understood unto this day what those symbols were so we do understand things that paul didn't understand one thing he i say he didn't understand he didn't even know about it because the book of revelation would be written after he was gone so it would be the last book because it would be added into as on the the end of the bible because it would be for our day so we do understand things that paul didn't like the mystery of the seven stars you know the meaning of the seven cities the seven golden candlesticks you see paul didn't know that would be seven church ages i mean he fully expected the lord to come in his age in his time he said say we which are alive and remain amen the mystery of the seven thunders which are the mysteries contained in the seven seals and when they were open it revealed the symbols of each of each seal right but this never i won't just get something clear this did not give us new doctrine we did not receive a different gospel amen paul amen paul did not what paul preached was the pure word of god but man had lost it that's why it got sealed up and that's why we needed it open because the opening was to restore the abstract to the title deed that we had lost because we went down to babylon and about we down through the dark ages are you with me now so paul you see paul had a gospel i'm going to go through this and some of this may be elementary but i want to i want to pound it in make sure you really know what we believe because we do not believe some off-the-wall teachings that just came from the mind of a kentucky preacher we it was not his intellectual property it was um the mysteries of god revealed by an angel because of an anointing that was on him of elijah the prophet to bring a restoration and to give the old stones of truth that had been lost and neglected and repaired the altar [Applause] hallelujah amen now so you see brother branham taught water baptism as paul taught it he taught the holy ghost as an experience just the way paul taught it paul came to ephesus and he found believers people who had believed and asked if they if they had yet experienced the holy ghost since they had believed and paul insisted you must have an experience after believing not upon believing that you get the holy ghost but after you believe you were sealed with the holy ghost this holy spirit of promise now so again all of these things paul preached them in fact when brother brown goes beyond the curtain of time what was that that rejoiced his heart they told him there you have preached what paul preached oh you say well brother tim he got that in 1916 that's when he he went there no he was there and you know that's when he entered in in 1965 one breath away he's gathered with all of these people amen because he said he was so he was showed this it was not a vision it was a translation he was caught up into the eternals and he saw what it would be when he when he was gathered with his people in plain language when he died and when he would die he was gathered with all of them and they said you preach what paul preached he declared it i preached what paul preached and they said we know that and we're resting on that i'll tell you if that's their rest here that's got to be a rest here hallelujah now let me let me just get clear here let's talk about paul and his gospel because paul said men would be judged by his gospel in romans 2 16 he said in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel and paul began to take this and he said it is my gospel you know why he was recognizing himself as a messenger the apostle to the gentiles which is the apostle to all the church ages so he said he said his gospel was he said his gospel was a revelation of the mystery that had been hid from the foundational world and they were revealed by his gospel so turn to me with romans 16 25 now to him that is a power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but is now made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets amen praise the lord so you see here again this is what he said it's according to my gospel my gospel has imparted to you mysteries because you see previous to this they didn't even know the gentiles would be saved they had no idea you know in judaism that there would ever be a bride out of the gentiles amen they they didn't understand you see it was a mystery that was hidden amen that god would have a bride out of the gentiles for his name's sake [Applause] again in romans 15 19 through many signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god and so that from jerusalem and round about uh lyrical i have fully preached the gospel of christ so he said i have fully preached it whether it was serpent seed or predestination or eternal security or or whether baptism in jesus name or whatever it was one god come on somebody amen paul said i have fully preached it now and he said i did you know it was preached through mighty signs and wonders and the power of the spirit of god which is the way the gospel must be preached today because if we preach what paul preached is going to have mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit now jesus told us he told us something very very important in matthew 24 14 and he says that the gospel would be preaching all the world so that the end could come no so again this this is this is very clear the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations then shall the end come so you know that's that's why it's important that the bride has a voice amen because the voice of god i'm just quoting your prophet is in the bride amen now so he so he said so again jesus said this gospel in order for the end to come it's got to be preaching all the world now brother branham was here telling us you know when he requests this he said it ain't went there yet amen and i want to say to you it could not go until it was restored so you see the baptist cannot take it to the world that methodists cannot take into the world the bible societies can't take into the world somebody help me preach now about there is only one voice of the spirit and that is the word of god that must go into all the nations so the end can come we have the gospel according to the baptist and the math of this and the pentecostal but the gospel of the kingdom whose mysteries paul revealed must be preached unto all the world for a witness then shall the end come and we must use every means to do it amen going preaching evangelizing missionary and internet every way we can any way we can it's got to go this is our the travel must be is greatly increased where our voice is right now in the instant second is across the world our picture our voice our message are you with me what is it is because the gospel must be preached into all and don't get me wrong we are not the only one we're not the only ministry it's a pride ministry this is not about us i'm just trying to show you our little part that's all amen now can you imagine can you imagine forbidding paul to use a ship as a vehicle to preach the gospel oh although there was evil cargo on the ship all those evil slave trading was going on the ships and paul used the ships said brother tim there's there's some really bad stuff on the internet yeah there is yeah that's a good point don't look at it amen be selective amen you don't have to listen to all that other stuff but the gospel's got to go are you with me now elijah in our reading here did not add stones he laid the original stones back into place he repaired the altar of the lord he he didn't go out there and and uncover uh some platelets that are found down there like like john smith did to start the mormons he didn't do that he didn't go to seminary where they uncovered what really paul preached what how did it happen by the same angel by the same spirit of christ that revealed it to paul revealed it to brother branham so that we could have assured he had the message that paul preached now here are some snippets of what elijah's to do it's going to go back to its original again back to the real holy ghost back to the gospel message back to acts 2 again back to the formula back to where it began at again it will have the same doctrine it'll have the same power to show the same sign because it's the same kind of church that they had at the beginning again elijah will go back to the original pentecostal ephesus church and bring the same message to the people with the signs of the messiah again he will stand and that elijah will shake the people right straight back to the original pentecostal doctrine again it'll be a restoration to send that lukewarm laodicean church back to that original faith back the under yes sir he will be anointed to do so second seal he would restore and bring back the children to the faith of their fathers the original apostolic pentecostal faith which he promised to be restored third seal the bible said that this messenger the last day would restore them back to the original faith again back to the faith of the fathers but you think they would receive it no sir last days he would restore the original word again as he said in malachi 4. again he said we are a promise to malachi 4 by the same system in that same system as a prophet he always did that he would be restored that we would be restored back to the original somebody say original i hope you're catching something here everything's original it's back it's not into it's not somewhere we ain't never been it ain't something that ain't never been preached it's back to the original vine to the original root because we got to get back to the original word for a for a branch to come out of it to bear the original fruit again so he said oh my back to the original sea back to the seed like it was began on the day of pentecost back to the same doctrine word by word power by power spirit by the same thing just exactly like it was back in the beginning through signs and wonders of the living presence of jesus christ again malachi 4 said we be brought back to the original faith like it was on the day of pentecost the faith of the fathers malaga 4 said he would do this and manifest his word to turn back the faith the hearts of the children back to the fathers again back to the original pentecostal word the real bible word again we're expecting the great anointing upon the church and it turned the hearts of the children back to the original doctrine of the fathers back to real genuine pentecost what she is to be the same bride the same kind built up the same kind of material that she was in the first place now read malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed to have a message in the last days that will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to the original pentecostal message word by word come on somebody word by word original original original original original never something new that's not something different not something they didn't have but what original original original word by word original doctrine original power original spirit everything's original it must have back to the root because out of the root must come a branch it ain't going to do no good to get another branch a new brainchild the baptist the methodists and these grafted branches the only way you're going to have a bride that matches him is have a branch out of the original root look brother go back to pentecost let's get back to the original back to the beginning get back to where we left it amen hear me i speak it in the name of the lord back to the beginning i will bring her back to the original doctrine i'll bring her back to the original word so now how could he speak as a prophet in the name of the lord and somehow come down to the end of his ministry and speak of different results now i i just want to i want to just say as i as i went as i always say i i i study something out and i look at every aspect of it i have 84 pages that i can't afford to read to you 84 pages of this these kind of things that i just pulled a few snippets from now you see from and i just want to go from the earliest sermon from the earliest recorded one of the earliest recorded sermons of brother branham in 1948 march the 4th the angel of god he says i know the next thing to happen is the restoration of the gifts to the church and it's the hardest thing i've had to do in this pioneering work is to do to see the people god cannot give the gifts back to the church as long as this church is divided we've got to get the church together first for the gifts can come but if all the full gospel people would come together in one heart and one accord now we're we're kind of a scattered group nothing group this morning but i i just want to look just for a minute and i want to just see where you come from how many baptist former baptister here oh got a good representation i better be careful when i talk about baptists how many methodists former methodists are here now go go ahead raise your hand up brother l did you go with him too sister l [Laughter] i mean how many how many catholics are here one two there's at least two three there's nothing over there yeah so you know we we got a pentecostal how many pentecostals oh yeah we got pentecostals here so you see we got all of them now what has happened all of these have come together hallelujah in one mind one accord to one message now you might still be buying a chevrolet and me a forward you know that's not what we're talking about one mind and one accord it's not a honda are you with me but what we're talking about we have one piece and we have one goal we have one thing in mind that's to be the bride of christ to see him manifest every bit of his power and it's that kind of group [Applause] that he can reveal himself so so he sells but if all the full gospel people come together with one heart one one accord there would be a revival that would shake the whole world and every spiritual gift would be in the church within an hour's time after it took place signs and wonders that was done by the apostles would be a minor thing to what would happen if we just get the church together it's got to happen it will happen it may be after i've passed off the scene but i want to put my word in this that you would know that this that my voice is this old christian people bind yourself together with one heart one accord for god can no more send the gifts to the church while the church is separated then he can send the whole holy ghost unless we're in one accord and that's right for he comes by the holy ghost believe it again 1953 very early sermon that is recorded it's my humble belief we're living near the end time or may i make it a little more personal saying we're living in the end time i believe it's time for the restoration of the church that god promised would send in the last day and i believe that this day when the word is world where the word has been preached so much and the day is getting so dark and evil till according to god's word he was to restore all the caterpillar had eaten the palmer worm had eaten will be restored back again and this is the day of restoration of the spiritual gifts given unto the church a pentecostal branch filled with the holy ghost signs and wonders of the resurrection great things taking place they that know their god in the last days shall do exploits well brother tim but that was before the seals okay we'll take these uh you know in perfect faith uh a few months after the seals he said we are trying to get the church into the place where we could really see apostolic times moving among us now i hear preachers saying oh we don't want that kind of atmosphere well i'm sorry we do [Applause] amen we do amen that's what we all hunger so well we're not hungry for that brother tim we're hungry for the character of christ well what do you think the character christ is amen it's just laying at the door we see it and haven't we healings miracles signs wonders come on workings of the holy spirit prophetic gifts come on things that god is doing what and and we and we see it but we want to see more of it we want it to just such a flow that would be a help to us and to us flow out to others hallelujah that's why i'm glad to hear somebody down in south africa rejoicing and say it's flowed over to me it flowed over to our church hey man and you weren't making a following or a personality call that wasn't what it was about we got in love with jesus it turned our lives around it filled us with the holy ghost he put a revival on the inside of us [Applause] let's look at brother branham's expectations and and he he would uh right down to the last year of his ministry i'm going to just pick up about three of them out of his last year now i'm doing this um many it wasn't that many years ago five ten years ago maybe i read a book called killing lincoln and and it was about yeah it was this kind of historical book about the last days of lincoln on this day you know it took about the last two weeks of his life or something like that and you know lincoln did this and this and this and then you know to hear this war was going on and this and this and this happened and then you know all the way down every every day it was taken um you know the last days of lincoln and trying to retrace the steps of um of that um patriot patriot that was here in america and so you know just before he died the man who had 10 days to live now i'm just going to say it this way it really touched my heart because i began to think about the seventh angel and you know here he comes down the last life at last years of his life and i said well what were the last things that god wanted to impart to his seventh angel amen what were the last things that he would tell us before god took his elijah messenger home the seventh angel to the last church ages you know the angel of the church of laodicea right he didn't write it to you and me wrote it to the angel the messenger who brought it to you amen now so he again so i i'm looking now taking just a few of the when when this messenger would have his last few sermons to preach the last year of his life does god change his mind he says now may i say this as he talked about the church that left him at pentecost like mary and joseph left jesus and sought him three days and he said may i say this they thought he was alone but they found out in the crisis he wasn't see he wasn't with him now we find out that in the time that when this great thing has been brought up we find out that we're missing something in our churches and that's the power of christ this ain't just being said now about baptist methodist presbyterian this actually is an indictment against many message churches and he said i don't want to criticize and neither do i want to criticize that's why i'm saying get him on a car get in get instead i'm not counting anybody out i'm not saying this asking nobody else i'm not saying what if you're not preaching what i'm preaching you're not gonna make i said get in step get in line get there walk in step to the tune of the gospel we're missing christ among our pentecostal people our brothers our sister there's something wrong the old-fashioned prayer meetings they used to have all day and night they don't have them no more women used to wear long hair they don't do it anymore it would be a disgrace for a woman to use paint back in the early days and not the way women do something went wrong nothing's wrong with christ see but something went wrong something is somewhere the prophet used to wouldn't have permitted such a thing as that but it does now see the crisis is on and we're missing something we're missing power that we ought to have where the big machine ought to be running up and the great signs and wonders well this building ought to be so full of the power of god now till the sinner couldn't stand here the holy spirit condemn it right quickly like that like ananias and sapphira we're missing something again the last year i i in the last year as he concludes his message to the church and here's one of his last sermons to his home church in jeffersonville and he said when she is eve had the very filling of the word in her hands she could have took god's word but what did she do instead of tarrying for the baptism of the holy ghost let science prove to her that the holy ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping divine healing going i want you to understand this is our responsibility to keep divine healing going to keep a faith in the church because if you can't believe for divine healing if we can't get the church to even believe that how are you going to have faith for a rapture instead of keeping divine healing going where she ought to be now raising the dead and doing great miracles she has left satan under his leadership a religious man take the word of god and try to say it was for another age and she's believed it when the bible said the things that i do shall you do also and message preachers rose up and said that was only for brother branham jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and we're still creatures these signs should follow them that believe and she denies every bit of it she denies all the supernatural she swapped it for an intellectual conception of the bible these are the last things the holy spirit's imparting amen we're priests and holy fathers who call we're bishops and archbishops where where uh district president or general overseer and so forth has put their own interpretation to it and god has let them sit there as set their dead as 12 o'clock now then just before he leaps he preaches about five sermons there that he doesn't preach in jeffersonville he preaches one of them is the rapture another before the rapture is things that are to be another in his modern events made clear by prophecy leadership and he ends the ministry the ministry of christ through that prophetic ministry would end just like jesus did with communion leadership one saved one lost just like the thieves on the cross modern events made clear by prophecy things that are to be john john chapter 14 or john chapter 15 whichever one it is he said where where he says um you know he said he makes it clear that that he's coming again we're not talking about brother branham coming again jesus was talking about if i go away you know i i must go away and he began to begin to speak on those things you know in my father's house are many mansions in fact before he would leave in 1965 he would tell us what those mansions were there were more than of something with gold doorknobs and and and crystal windows and painted things uh you know man-made stuff come on more than just gold gold is just dust dirt on the street pavement on the streets of glory the most precious thing we hear have here is only pavement there amen so you see jesus would tell us things that are to be in my father's house are many mansions i go away to prepare a place and brother branham would come right down to things that are be in other words things we can't expect things that are to be things we can't expect and i believe that's the same thing we live today god bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do now we know that this is the day of salvation where god is calling men from the world to from a life of sin and to a life of service that kicks out god's off his mercy doesn't it and then the day that god has poured out his spirit up from on high great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day this is when the former and latter rain are falling together and we know that there is supposed to be great signs and wonders which in many denominations this is turned down things that are to be now let's go to the last recorded sermon here he comes communion foot washing the ministry listen that was the ministry of christ we saw repeated we did amen it wasn't jesus but it was his ministry now with the same sign proven it's the word that discerns the thoughts in the entire heart the messiah sign and and christ the word being present and here he comes right down to the last sermon communion and it's not to the church it's not to the world it's too little group of followers believers of his message in an old jewish synagogue that's where that's where tucson tabernacle was and brother branham would speak to those who believed his message communion last sermon you know the hour will soon arise when right among us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananias sapphira remember that hour is arriving see now you just remember that that god and this just drills my heart god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now so all the way through from the beginning to the end it was proclaimed that the same bride as it was in the original will be once again in the end we often say jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever is the theme of the message but really it's because god said i will restore so restoration was his theme because without restoration jesus christ couldn't be the same now so again let's go back to verse 33 of chapter 18 of verse kings and let's just look at this so he put the wood in order is everybody with me first kings 18 33 he put the wood in order the wood of the word placed correctly and cut the bullock in pieces to sacrifice the atonement and his work as intercessor properly placed amen listen it wasn't an altar without a sacrifice it was not an altar without an accessory come on somebody that's a lie of the devil that tries to take the intercessor from the bride of christ he is our intercessor well brother jim how could it be him friend or sister he's a bright grammy you know and and he's not he you know he's not he's not the the the mediator he's the bridegroom and the mediator and the bridegroom were all the same one it was just god changing his mask he mediated to open the seals was mandatorial work to take the book clear the deed meditorial work the rapture is mandatorial work amen we're gone intercedes on our behalf and raptures a church chains in her body amen that's his work as high priest prepare to pride for his image watch now the with the word properly placed cut the bullock in pieces to sacrifice atonement his work his intercessor properly placed laid him on the wood and said for a few four barrels with water and pour it on the sacrifice on on the wood and do it a second time and they did it the second time do it the third time and they did it the third time three times four equals twelve spirit forever tribe amen if it was our day it would be seven the seven spirits of god for seven ages but this was israel in their time and they had they were represented by 12 we're represented by seven now what so he said and the water ran around the altar and he filled the trees thereof with water and it came to pass that the offering of the evening sacrifice look when it all happens at the evening sacrifice in the evening time it shall be light in the last day amen in the at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known this day that thou art god in heaven and i am thy servant and i have done all these things by thy word amen so what was elijah ministry to do to introduce us back to jehovah away from trinity come on back to one god again not two lords one lord one faith one baptism amen what did he say now he says i have done all of this by vision amen i have done all these things as thy word by vision i placed i found the stones hallelujah i found the mystery truths what paul said about the original sin what paul taught about baptism in jesus name what paul paul taught about the the godhead what paul talked about eternal security i found every one of these truths by vision i got the dirt off of these neglected truths and i've repaired the altar the angel now i'm going to say something here the angel that discerned the hearts that restored health to the sick restored healing hearing to the death restored sight to the blind the same angel the same angel help brother branham find showed him where to find and place the neglected stones of baptism of oneness of original sin predestination security of the believer and put all of these mystery truths in order so we could come back to true worship so that there could be a people in the last days that worship god in spirit and in truth verse 37 hear me o lord hear me that the people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has what turned their hearts where back again and then the fire god fell and consumed the birds sacrificed the wood the stones the dust and licked up the water that was in the trees the pillar of fire was his vindication you see roberts claimed the gift of healing that was in his right hand jack cole had blind and reckless faith hey allen exhibited a gift of faith but only brother branham was accompanied by an angel and vindicated by a pillar of fire because while he was the elijah and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and said the lord he is god the lord he is the god and when we saw it we said this is the lord and he is the world and this is why malachi 4 says that when the spirit upon elijah that was upon elijah comes in the last day that it will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so let us understand his job and purpose i know sometimes you think these things are elementary but it seems like we somebody moves the landmarks and i'm coming back and pointing out these are the landmarks amen so malachi 4 was to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the pentecostal father so let's let's understand this i want to get something clear i want to make sure nobody misunderstands me i am not talking about restoring the azusa street revival nor what they had there they were not and let me say it again they were not a book of acts church here's a point i want to make clear if azusa was a restoration of pentecost and the book of acts then there would have been no need for an elijah ministry to restore it amen it had already been done pentecost brought that back no brother branham the prophet the messenger the elijah restored it back susan street was just another grafted-in vine branch so the original vine was christ and the first branch was pentecost now let me just say this i'm going to quote brother branham because and and and let me just say it and then i'll quote it if you don't see pentecostal in the branch it is a grafted vine from the brother branham said that this jesus said i'm the vine you are the branches john 15. i believe is that right i'm the vine now what did the vine put forth a branch the first branch was the pentecostal church is that right then the second branch comes forth will be another pentecostal church now we don't see pentecostal in all the churches do we no well what is it it's a grafted vine see you can take an orange tree and graft almost any kind of citrus fruit you can graft almost anything grapefruit or whatever it is what what more but it's the grafted but if the original vine itself puts out a branch it'll bring the same kind of fruit that was the first one brought so what's going to happen now here we're in the end time i told you last sunday god's looking for fruit not just any fruit he wants his fruit his fruit he's looking for his fruit fruit that came from the original vine so what's going to happen to the branches then that are not bringing that are not bringing um the fruit of the original pentecost now jesus answers that question he does he tells you what's going to happen to branches that are not bringing the fruit of original pentecost he says every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away you're cut off from me if you don't bear fruit you're going to be cut off and if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned so this is what's going to happen if you don't bear the fruit amen now in the laodicean church ages brother branham preached it in 1960 he said now so therefore you must remember jesus stands at your door and remember god's promise here that he will in the last days because of what now remember that's what's happening right now christ is being rejected somebody help me preach rejected revelation 3 he's on outside of the door the last place he's going to be rejected is going to be in message churches are you with me i don't want it to be our church listen what rejected what caused israel to be cut off the original tree because they rejected paul's pentecostal message and do you believe this is the last church age the bible said so and what are what and what says going to happen to them they're going to be cut off because of rejecting the pentecostal message and god will return again to the jews what they're going to be cut off for what rejecting the pentecostal message now so this is what we're in danger of in this last day amen when we're saying they're rejecting christ we're talking about rejecting the pentecostal message now when god created his church he created a pentecostal church that was the original a church filled with the holy ghost men and women led by the spirit of god man couldn't couldn't leave that alone he wanted to hybrid the church to be bred in the world with it theology doctrines denomination oh it sure makes a pretty your church my oh yes my how much different is that for the original church again he would preach this right at the round of the same time of the church ages he said in condemnation by representation his father he says father so is it now near the coming of the lord jesus again just like the vine if the vine puts forth the branch and that brights was a pentecostal branch filled with the holy ghost signs and wonders and fruits followed the branch if that vine ever puts another branch it'll be the same kind of branch amen so he said we can take an orange tree and this is still in his prayer gross citrus fruit of different kinds seven or eight we can put lemons and we'll grow right on because citrus fruit he'll grow grapefruit many other things tangerines and other citrus fruit but if that tree brings forth its own branch again it'll be an orange lord it'll be like the first one was and we believe that that that there used to be a church in these last days that will receive both the former and lighter reign he's still saying that right at the end of his ministry it'll be scattered throughout the world in this laodicean age it'll be a church that is called back to the original faith in god it'll be a church that'll have jesus christ walking in it manifests himself the shout of the king will be in it hallelujah now let me show you a few more snippets from different sermons after a while it's going back to its original again back to the real holy ghost back to the gospel message back to acts 2 again back to the formula back to where it began at again we've got to get back to a pentecostal experience again we're not talking about azusa street but when he comes this time he will turn the hearts of the church back to the pentecostal fathers again what we need is back to the pentecostal message back to the holy ghost that is true again come back to the homeland to the beginning back to the pentecostal experience like that happened on the day of pentecost uh when the power of the living god changed thousands of people set their hearts all with the on fire with the fire of god that so genuine not impersonated gifts again the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers the original message restored the faith of the children back to the pentecostal fathers again back to the original faith i believe it's the evening lights and again he will restore the faith of the children back to the pentecostal fathers away from their creeds and dogmas it has got to come and it will come in the name of the lord it will come hallelujah it is a fact that the prophet for the last seeds must be bringing a message from god that'll forerun the second coming of the lord for by his message with the hearts of the children be turned back to the pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of power amen so you see again this this is where we are this is this is the promise that is given yeah and and brother branham said we need as minister to preach the gospel and bring the church back to pentecost again bring it back to the eagle experience what the church needs you don't want to be chickens your eagles you've got to take eagle food and that's bringing the church back to pentecost again this is why elijah the prophet comes again laodicean church age and the hearts of the children to the fathers and when this great elijah comes in the end of this age he'll be taking the message of pentecost to turn the children to the faith of the fathers because he'll be rebuking them because they didn't keep the same faith that was back there at the beginning so turn the hearts back turn back with me to psalms 80 and verse 18. then we will not turn away from you revive us and we will call on thy name we will call on your name now not the name of baptist methodist assembly of god upc those are grafted branches not a revival or a grafted vine of perusia or coleman standards or two souls those are grafted fines or branches into the message and i just want to say that's not the name of our bridegroom tree amen he said we will call on your name you see salvation is not in those other names yet they may think they're saved by the name of baptist or methodist but those are blasphemous names because to be called by any other name then our bridegroom is a sign of a lewd and adulterous woman a so there's going to be a people now that will call that will be called by his name and that will call upon his name verse 19 restore or turn again o lord god almighty make your face shine on us that we may be saved amen oh my look it now these are powerful words you see the last day anointing the pouring out of god's spirit is shown over in revelation 10 1 as the face of the son which is saying the word returning in its fullness that's what he said i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clove with a cloud rainbow on his head his face was as it were the sun this is exactly psalms 80 19 us o lord god almighty make your face shine upon us so we can be saved so there can be a rapture my goodness church we got to be saved out of this sodom world amen we can't stay here the whole world's going to burn come on church remember there's got to be a rapture in this day and to do it we've got to have the full word shining in his son amen shining as the son in his full strength and its full power not no more partial message the light of his face shines bringing us the word with his full power amen and just as every substance of life lives on earth by the energy from the sun even so the bride of christ lives by the energy from the word he was clothed with a cloud but there was no cloud over his face it was the full word shining in its strength and full power but i just want to say to you before you get to thinking this is something new it is not something new it is the same s-o-n that's shown in the morning is the same s-o-n shining in the evening time so after a cloudy and dismal day through the dark ages it's saturday night in the evening time hallelujah and the path of glory you will surely find hallelujah that it's god's word to us in the evening time it's shabby light hallelujah not a different sun not a different light not a different doctrine not a different truth the original sun with the clouds taken off of it and seeing him in his full glory hallelujah in the seven-fold glory of this person the the foot the unveiling of god the full god may manifest the full word coming again to make a pride in the end time to shine above the last branch so she'll bring forth fruits evening time fruits because in the cloudy day he couldn't bring the fruits but here in the evening time the fruits come back on the vine i will restore voice of the sign he said it shall be light and evening time there will be a sunrise in the evening time don't miss it friends don't miss it not the same sun would give the same light the same s-u-n gives the same s-u-n light the same s-o-n gives the same s-o-n light get it again full sun fullness of the word fullness of its power all full of its energy everything in it nothing missing amen there's no shadow over healing you didn't see it ain't the season for miracles that's a bunch of baloney amen it is the season it's the light the full light full word it ain't the time for a gift that's a bunch of nonsense it's the full light it's the full word it ain't the time for prayer line that's nonsense it's the full word it's the full light it ain't the time for for people to fall out in the spirit they did all down through the bible and yes they did in brother brandon's ministry but we don't want that today that's because you're rejecting christ amen now he said in verse 25 of joel now and i will restore it to joel 2 25 i will restore to you the years amen everything that was lost amen all the lost crops of the past what they should have had in luther's day in wesley's day and but you see hey you know but now it's going to be a different time the the the the fats shall overflow with oil and the floor will overflow with wheat i i'm going to restore everything amen there will be there will be a bride that's a holy bride because i'm restoring holiness there will be a word bride because i'm restoring the word there will be a gifted bride because i have gifted her everything that is in the word is hers the full word the full book the open book nothing missing the light all the way from genesis to revelation i will restore so as israel was a fruitful vine so has so ah and so was so is spiritual israel the church is to be the spiritual vine now brother branham tells us in his sermon palm worm locust and caterpillar he preached numerous sermons and i will restore you know where the blind the the divine and word of planet um com palmer locus caterpillar all these all these different ones the restoration of the bride tree this was esteem god's going to use elijah to restore it ain't never been restored yet azusa didn't restore it luther didn't restore it wesley didn't restore it it's going to be restored by the same system denominational systems can't do it so god's system of sending a prophet is how i'm going to do it before we can have ever have a building of the church of god we'll have to restore back all those things that these insects have eaten out of it we'll have to go back and find out what these insects see he is the vine we're the branches and before we can ever find out or the church can stand in this formal and and original power we'll have to go back and find out what the insects ate and the church will have to be restored back to that or it will never stand in its power and glory of its first standing so if we're going to restore then what kind of vine was it originally the original church was rooted in christ and the first branch was a book of acts church so why aren't the other branches in the christian church producing another book of acts is because like looking at the orange tree and there isn't any oranges but rather grapefruit lemons and tangerines and all different kinds of flavors but not any oranges and today we got varieties of christians who are supposed to be attached to the root christ but they're nothing like the original root so brother branham said in the patmos vision that's the way the churches they'll split the vine and graft it in presbyterian methodist baptists and so forth it's baptist fruit presbyterian fruit methodist fruit but if that tree ever brings forth another vine it'll break the same kind of vine it was brought on the day of pentecost the original vine it'll speak in tongues and have the power and the signs of the resurrected christ in it because it's thriving and the natural resource that it was planted in actually is not planted it is born in it praise the lord said didn't think of that one right then these other grafted in and they grabbed them into the trees so they bear their own kind of fruit they can't take this they don't believe in that because they never knew nothing about it but if they're born in that same life that came out of that tree there's only one thing that they can bear and it's the life of the original stem hallelujah so what did what in the world what happened with when these insects come down to eat the tree i'm trying to bring this to a close i got just a few more minutes behold your thought just just a moment how come how come the the the bark the original bark is missing off the tr off of the tree insects amen you see he began the first thing he did was begin to take the covering the religion away by the way any religion without emotion is dead you need to bury it i'm quoting your prophet amen amen it's got to have the spirit running up and down through it come on amen so he began to take his it's covering his doctrine religion is a doctrine that covers anything that's the reason our religion is by the blood is the blood the blood must be void the blood is the spirit the bride is the blood by the spirit are you with me so true doctrine is not a dead letter flowing through the word of truth is the life of christ the spirit and it pushes christ from the roots through the branches producing the leaves and the fruit and that's why that doctrine that is not carrying the spirit somebody help me producing signs and wonders and miracles and healing a holy life a righteous character produces a dead snag for buzzards to root stone once the dark is stripped and that's what happened these insects these demons they're called horse riders in the book of revelation the insects in the book of joy but anyway are you with me now it comes there and it strips away the bark and you know what man does he tries to replace it with his own he puts a rag around it hey man i said you know there's some kind of substitute rag around it but you see the life of the of the vine will not flow through a rag it's got to be the bark the lifeline and what it's got to be the original doctrine amen the original word because the spirit flows through the word amen and it'll produce the same light that the tree had before the insects ate it amen but you know there again you know that's why we got so many isms among us because insects come along and ate the bark and we put the rag of peruse around it the rag of coleman's thunders the rags of two souls and the rags and the holy spirit can't work through that same thing they did with baptist methodism presbyterian they put those rags around them a man put a covering around because it moved the original doctrine but god said i will restore saith the lord i'll bring back it to the original gospel that paul preached and when it does the spirit is going to flow through it and it'll produce leaves it'll produce fruit it'll produce branches it'll produce life it'll produce a shade for the almighty to come and sit down and are meant to be entertained but when you cut the lifeline you're a woodsman you know you cut around the tree and girdle it around what is it going to do it'll kill it buddy you know one day i i had these big pine trees i had 13 of them in my yard i wound up cutting them down building a house out of them that's where i got most of the lumber from my house big pine trees underneath them you know i thought it would be nice to have some dogwoods some fruiting trees and cherry blossoms you know some magnolias around and different things coming up underneath them and just kind of make it a canopy around i'd make it a pleasant garden so i went i went to a nursery uh catalog and i picked out some different ones that would grow under those pine trees and i got them and they were little about that long and i planted them out there and i put them i put them all around under them trees and i cared for them and watered them and watched them and made sure insects wasn't eating on them went away to preach a a service one time and and i i i came back home and sister karen had surprised me bless her heart and she had weed eat it she didn't cut him down she just girdled everyone up the only one that survived and is still alive today is a magnolia tree and it was this didn't have no weeds around it so she didn't ever we'd eat it but all the others she killed and i walked out when i got home i walked that was looking around at my plants i've been waiting and i was like ah what's happened to my what i messed up a good thing she never weed eat it again but that's all you have to do is girdle the bark cut the original doctrine the life won't flow the leaves will wither are you with me amen again again that's the same thing rags i could have went there and tied rags around them somebody helped me preach but it would never produce the tree it had to be the original but i couldn't put it back on there and when man takes it away he can't put it back but god can he said i will restore saith the lord i'll bring my garden back to original condition again so what'd he do he ate off faith you know because and when faith was adopted you know the divine's not operating like it did at the beginning even jude said we must earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints we're losing something here amen this faith i want to hear your prophet say the faith of the saints was not in creeds it was not in denomination it was not in church buildings not in associations but it was in the presence of the living god they had faith oh you say well brother tim glory to god we got faith we we we we have this doctrine here we have that doctrine we're we no they had faith to heal the sick cast out devils do miracles all the great promises jesus made that the first church held on to that was a lifeline what did he say when the son of man cometh will he find god's going to be looking for faith but if an insects ate it all off i made us a bunch of faithless powerless people whose only weapon is argument then we're going to find ourselves coming up start on that day amen especially when god promised i will restore amen oh my so so again he said the ever presence the ever presence of the living god is a lifeline of any church or any bunch of people the ever presence of the living god to perform and to do and to act and to live with the people as he did in the beginning if the presence of the living god brought a pentecost with power signs wonders brought a people so full of the glory of god so they shout and spoke with other tongues and went and martyred for the faith let's earnestly condemn for that faith until death sets us free amen earnestly contend for that so you see it's got to bear that if the original if his first branch brought out that vine was a pentecostal branch with power visions revelations healing sanctification uh the holy spirit the next branch will do the same thing so what should we look for a branch that's pentecostal branch with power visions revelations healings sanctification holy spirit if that was the first one the last one's going to do the same thing so if one of these devilish insects takes the bark off the tree an old man made rag or covered won't allow the sap into the trees the holy spirit will not flow through creeds of men so next thing you see the leaves are withered and that's why we can't have revival in our day is because of man-made rags on the tree the doctrine of the church if it wanna it won't allow the praises to flow given sweetness to the fruit you see it don't say it you know no listen to me it's really subtle it's slick it don't say days and miracles are passed it's too subtle for that it just say it just says that was for the prophet or i was just to vindicate the message you see this is not the season for miracles because we have the word now it's just another rag if it's the true doctrine it will let the life flow you see the problem with what people is calling the word they are calling the word is really a rag and it's put on by man to dress the wound made by the cankerworm it's not the word let me tell you what the word does the word heals the word performs miracles the word delivers the word casts out devils the word produces holiness the word produces joy somebody help me preach the word produces every promise in the word of god flows through the bark amen and by making the leaves where that they can move in the spirit and produce fruit on the branches now how do we know that it was the word in jesus day it cast out devils it opened the eyes of the blind it healed the sick it performed the miraculous it brought down the holy ghost how did we know it was a word in brother branham's day it brought the holy ghost it cast out devils it opened the eyes of the blind it healed the sick it performed the miracles how do you know a church is in the word today it brings down the holy ghost it cast out devils amen it saves the lost somebody help me preach it opens the eyes of the blind it heals the sick it performs the miraculous it manifests the carrot of christ that's how we know amen you see because it must produce the fruits of the root and the life of christ or the life of god comes right down to the roots here the root and offspring of david and begins to come up through the holy spirit then the denomination said days of miracles a path you don't have to speak with tongues today there's no such thing as baptism of the holy ghost there's no divine healing that was when the age gone it's gone long ago so here's the branches up here suffering but brother branham said he said i'm looking at a stump and i'm looking back to the original route and i'm looking to the stump that's been cut down and he said i'll die on this dump proclaiming this word i will restore saith the lord now that was your prophet he was saying i will die on this stuff this will be the last dying breath of my god is going to restore this church i'm going to have a bride in the evening time there's going to be signs and wonders there's going to be the miraculous there's going to be people on fire with god the joy of the lord the son of the king will be in their midst hallelujah and i'll tell you what i will not put up with any man-made rag on the tree hallelujah let me die in that same place he said my god doesn't come in my generation i'll die on the stump where the cankerworms eat too believing that jesus christ and his church and his word is the same yesterday today and forever i'll stand loyal on that stump and cry the hour will come god will restore his church to his former condition hallelujah what a wonderful word what a promise you can look at now what about you you may be a leaf on that tree a little twig on that tree you may have went through some things and been eaten down you may have been hurt and scared sin may have done his damage on your life but god said i will restore it saith the lord i tell you might be a backslidden church and cold and formal but let me just say to you god's not going to leave his bride that way there is a message of restoration amen amen uh no sir we are not going to go down in defeat amen oh my we're we're listen brother branham said what did they add they also added you don't have to get out and act like they did it don't give you joy and power and speaking in tongues and all these things you don't have to have it just make your confession and shake hands that's some poison dope of the devil if it made them act like that way when they took the medicine it'll make you act the same way hallelujah you say well you say well brother tim today we just you know we just received the word and we received this doctrine and this truth and that's our evidence of the holy ghost listen brother branham said i say this my beloved people listen to me i'll stand with you someday in the day of judgment and i'll have to answer i'll never answer to a creed so help me god i'll answer to the bible that's the book i stand by there is no place in the bible i'm quoting where they ever receive the holy ghost without having emotions speaking in tongues and shoutings and praises of god and prophecies and manifestations they never did just get up and walk away and shake hands with the preacher and walk away there's no such place in the bible they ever receive ever was baptized outside of being baptized in the name of jesus christ no place in the bible they ever taught trinity it was always one god hero israel i am the lord your god one god they shall have no other gods beside me i am the lord thy god not a father son and holy ghost but i'm god forever he's god he always was god he always will be god and i just want to say he'll never be two lords either are you with me amen so there are there again we look right there and we have seen the rags ain't no need for rags on this branch the original bark is back hallelujah amen oh my brother brother said and i'm closing on this the musicians can head this way but i don't promise to stop preaching but he said another fruit he ate off was the joy of salvation i'm quoting you people make too much noise my oh my how can you preach brother branham a man said to me one time i hope he's here he belongs to another church but he said to me i was up there to hear you the other day and i couldn't even hear you for them people crying how in the world can you preach i said i can't preach unless they do holler like that i don't know where i'm standing i don't know how they're receiving and then i said if they didn't enjoy it i wouldn't be preaching it there that's right he said they said he said well it makes chills go up and down my back to hear her crying and shouting i said you mean that dear little sainty little mother sitting back there weeping and made shivers go up and down you when when she was rejoicing in the spirit i said if she wasn't doing it shivers would run up and down my back i wouldn't know where i was oh i love the spirit of god feel the spirit of god moving among the people saturating them with the holy ghost he said oh that nearly froze my men nearly froze me to death he said it did brother you better change a whole lot if you're ever fortunate enough to get to heaven you'll freeze to death then when you come up there and hear all them screaming and crying and shouting up there while they cry holy holy holy before him day and night all the time they're going to be shouting and praising god and rejoicing and thousands times thousands rejoicing and singing and praising god when they come into his presence now let me tell you something right now my brother you're living in the quietest world you'll ever live in if you go to hell they'll be weeping and wailing and knocking of teeth if you go to heaven there will be hallelujahs and praise of god night and day for all time this is the quietest place you ever live in you might as well get customized here before you get started that way hallelujah amen get past my the way heaven's gonna be let a little heaven come down in our churches amen he said don't you think that's a motion said sir anything without emotion scientifically is dead and then he church a person that's born or the holy spirit says says god hasn't got a little emotion about them they're dead well brother tim but our joy is an emotion if joy isn't an emotion what is it it's a feeling based on something wonderful amen there was a doctor said to brother brandon said don't you think that people are just getting excited i said no sir i don't so what makes them you know what makes them that's nervousness because they scream and holler and go on i said doctor you mean to tell me that nerves can be excited about something that there's nothing without something to excite them something has to excite them so what was that so what was there he has what was there to excite him he said the unseen force of the holy ghost moving among us it excites that born-again spirit it brings an excitement to that spirit the power of god foams down through faith comes by hearing the word takes the holy s takes the holy ghost takes the word spreads it all over the people to catch it with that power that's regenerated born again life something's got to cry out hallelujah brother joe is telling us about the revival down in ohio and how our kids are coming back amen there ought to be a church here in louisiana that welcomes our young people with the same way hallelujah that has the same joy to conceive the joy that i have the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away there are to be people here that the spirit of god moves upon and brings of joy and rejoicing hallelujah let the holy ghost flow through the building there and move to the leaves and the leaves clap their hands and rejoice and shout and sing amen god bless you church hallelujah hallelujah
