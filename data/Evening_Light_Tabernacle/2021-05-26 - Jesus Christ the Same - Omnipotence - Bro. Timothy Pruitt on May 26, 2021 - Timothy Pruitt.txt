Description:
Bro. Timothy Pruitt ministers on "Jesus Christ the Same - Omnipotence" on Wednesday, May 26th, 2021 at Evening Light Tabernacle. For information, service archives, and more, please visit the church website at www.eveninglight.net

We welcome you to visit us during any of our services. We believe in taking the Scriptures for what they say and presenting Jesus Christ—not only in our teachings and in our services—but , most importantly, in our lives. We believe that all Christians must have a new birth whereby their nature is changed into the very image of Christ Himself. We are living in the last space of time allotted to the Gentile age before Christ’s return. Hence, the name, Evening Light Tabernacle, for we truly are at the evening time. However, the Scriptures contain the promise that at the evening time, there shall be light

Lo invitamos a visitarnos durante cualquiera de nuestros servicios. Creemos en tomar las Escrituras por lo que dicen y presentar a Jesucristo, no solo en nuestras enseñanzas y en nuestros servicios, sino, lo más importante, en nuestras vidas. Creemos que todos los cristianos deben tener un nuevo nacimiento mediante el cual su naturaleza se transforma en la imagen misma de Cristo mismo. Estamos viviendo en el último espacio de tiempo asignado a la era de los gentiles antes del regreso de Cristo. De ahí el nombre, Evening Light Tabernacle, porque realmente estamos a la hora de la tarde. Sin embargo, las Escrituras contienen la promesa de que al anochecer habrá luz

thank you for these opportunities we bless your name tonight in jesus name amen amen let's turn to hebrews 13 and verse 8. amen very wonderful to be here tonight amen hebrews 13 and verse 8 it says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen we'll let you be seated as we've been stating it's wonderful to serve a god who's the same today that he's not different today than he was yesterday or he's not thinking different today as he was yesterday you know he didn't get up today in a bad mood and think different thoughts about you but he's the same today amen and i'd like to speak to you tonight on jesus christ the same omnipotence omnipotence is one who has unlimited power or authority one who has unlimited power or authority you know it's hard for us as men limited creatures to comprehend unlimited things to comprehend something that's truly unlimited in its power or unlimited in its abilities even though man through scientific achievements has tried to obtain it they've fallen very short from it you know every because everything that man can make has limitations you know man-made cars they can only go so far they can only go so fast uh they can only last so long man-made airplanes can only go so fast they can only go so far they can only last so long man-made rockets the same story even man has broken to the nuclear realm but still things powered by nuclear power were only last so long it's limited because we are limited beings as far as humanity speaking human speaking yet man will begin to exalt himself because of his accomplishments and as great as they are they're still limited you know it's amazing to me even in man's great accomplishments how long it took man to go from a horse and buggy to an automobile it would be almost uh hundreds of years at least that that they would go riding in an ox car or a drone cart or a horse-drawn buggy until finally something would take place and that was the same brain as a man's always had the materials was always there but something happened for a man's abilities to be illuminated and i believe it was god allowing it to happen because it's to bring about an end time amen because in the time we have to have the things that we have to do what we do but every part of it is still limited you know and i know man in their greatness of thinking and the greatness of mine and and their education and things that they get into uh they begin to think how great they are but really we ought to think how little we really are in the grand scheme of things because when he speaks when because there because with god there is absolutely no limitations the only limits god has is what man limits him to you know if brother brown would talk about how our faith limits god how much our faith can be released that's how much god can do so really amen in this service there's no limits to what god can do in every service that's why brother branham would speak about it he said i believe god's to heal every person here tonight i believe god's here to deliver every person here tonight because there's no limits to his ability to heal there's no limits to his ability to deliver there's no limits to his ability whatsoever and when he speaks unlimited power is released when he speaks i mean a man can speak the greatest man on earth right now would be known as as a president maybe the united states or or some great leader somewhere but his speech has limitations it can only go so far it can only do so much but when god speaks it has unlimited power and therefore nothing can stop it because there's nothing greater than what he says nothing can destroy it when omnipotence speaks miracles take place we have seen the miraculous of omnipotence every day of our lives amen the earth that we live on the sun the moon the stars all hang in place why because omnipotence spoke and it put it there you know i got to look at about it you know and of course science always takes you back to a big bang theory you know it's a big bang that two particles happen to meet and the vastness of what we have here they happened to get together somehow and a big explosion took place and it put out all the things that we got today now i agree with him it was a big bang but it wasn't the bang they're thinking about it was let there be and the explosion took place amen you know today scientists say the milky way galaxy which is what our earth abides in apparently or as far as they can figure is about 100 000 to 150 000 light years in diameter now one light year is 5.8 trillion miles that's quite vast and that's just the galaxy and then they say that their best guess is the known universe is 98 billion light years in diameter now one light year is 5.8 trillion miles but they're willing to admit that as far as they can see with their best advances in science and come to the conclusion that there actually is no limitation to galaxies and to the stars amen they say it was a big bang but it was when omnipotence spoke and creation took place and and the very thing that you can look out at night and you can see and and the vastness of it is speaking of an unlimited god that has unlimited resources it has unlimited abilities and that doesn't change today just because the world gets more advanced and the things and it takes away from the things of god and the and the miraculous things of god god don't change he's still just as powerful today as he's always been this is why he would even put in his word the word the word all because in all it means all things it means everything it means everything that can be it's all i mean you can't get no further really than the word all because it's almost like an unending word so to speak and he was he would say it in his word and i love it i love it i mentioned it many times but he said i'm the lord god that heals all thy diseases now only omnipotence could say that and back it up because because to be able to say you can heal all diseases means you have to have the power to heal all diseases amen man cannot heal disease only god can heal man can assist man can do whatever the best of his knowledge amen but only god can speak the word all and back it up because he is unlimited therefore no matter what satan kind i love how he did it because he put a trap for satan because satan is constantly coming up with new diseases news afflictions news viruses new troubles knew this knew that but it's all included in all amen you can take him right back to the word here and he can come up with a new one you say well it fits right here amen even in sin he said he he he he cleanses all iniquity amen so there's no sin no nothing too great that this god can't do i i don't know about you that makes me rejoice because i realize no matter how bad my past was no matter how many failures i have no matter how many problems and situation it all goes in all that god is able to rewrite my life mercy is great enough god is great enough his power is great enough his blood is great enough amen to cover all sin hallelujah so when when omnipotence speaks the miraculous goes forth omnipotence is all-powerful and it takes the miraculous to show that omnipotence is there amen what if he would have spoke and nothing happened then he would not be omnipotent but something happened and then a clinker went forth and this one went out and that went to where even today man and his greatest abilities say we can't even get to the end of it all we can't even get to where where we can say yes that's the end of it we can't amen if i firmly say this is all of it then how in the world if science can't get to the end of the universe we live in how in the world can men get to the end of the miracles and say days of miracles are past and put limitations on god and say god don't move that way no more and when science can't even get to the end of things how does man get to the end of his word and say that's it and put a period there god is unlimited and it's time the church of god takes the limitations off of god i believe it's time we take the limitations off our services and say god you're a god you move how you want to move i just want to be there i want you to touch me i want to be part of it but i'm not going to put limitations on what you can do i'm not gonna put how many how many limitations on how many miracles you can perform in a day or service or in my life and what you can do i'm not putting limitations there on an unlimited god but i need this unlimited god i need him to move in my life i need him to touch my body i need him to speak so the miraculous can come forth i need him to say the words of god to my heart so i can believe all things are possible did you hear his word all things are possible hallelujah when omnipotence speaks the miraculous takes forth and we must have the miraculous amen we must have the miraculous you know i believe brother adam will say it like this he said i believe that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest vindication of omnipotence the world has ever known think about that statement right there i just read to you the world's trying to re figure out his omnipotence and his limitations by looking at the stars and the universe and they still haven't got there yet and the prophet of god said we're getting to the place that we're going to see the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known hallelujah he said i believe as a minister of the gospel we're living now where is this going to take place he goes on to say it we're living just at the near appearing of the second time or the second coming of the lord jesus and you know he would go on in the sermon the junction of time he would begin to talk about junctions and at every junction the voice of god would speak and omnipotence would follow would show the miraculous omnipotence would speak and and it would move and it would save and it would touch and it didn't matter how many men had tried to deny how many men said it wasn't so how many men said god lost his power how many rose up and said he ain't here no more when omnipotent spoke the miraculous took place amen he said well you see him he first time he'd come as a baby he said but this time he's coming as the king of glory and he's going to take vengeance upon all who will not obey the word of god he said we would believe that with all this great turmoil we're living in today and as we look around on every hand pick up the newspapers and now the internet just still still stand still you can drop our everyday hustle and bustle this neurotic age and look out and face facts we see beyond any shadow of doubt something is just about to happen the junctions a junction is about to take place amen you know when junctions are the old are into a new a junction or another dispensation and every one of them he shows his power and every one of them has a display of his omnipotence or a display of his ability amen that in the middle of all the naysaying in the middle of all the things that were going on even in noah's day when men with science was at his height was that his very pinnacle and men were doing unbelievable things and they they say doing things that we haven't even got to today now it's mind-blowing but that's what that's that's what they say doing things that we're not even into beyond where we're even at and men were saying god's no more and they were they were as as jesus would say there was a given in marriage and drunkenness and all the things that were taking place until where god said i'm done with it and a dispensation was to take place and a changing amen when the earth would be up they come up be baptized by water amen but in that omnipotent spoke and noah found grace in the eyes of god and omnipotence spoke and it saved noah in the flood it saved noah in his trouble it saved noah and god showed the great miraculous signs of the god of heaven i mean think about all the things that took place amen when when a man would all of a sudden get up come out one morning and get his cup of coffee and he'd look his wife in the eye and he said god spoke to me last night he said well he did we ain't heard from god in a long time he said well it may be so but let me tell you god spoke to me well what did he tell you he told me to go get some gopher wood and go and do this and he went through all and build an ark an ark what's an ark an ark is a boat it's a place where when the waters of judgment is going to come and it's going to fall rain from heaven what rain from heaven amen what are you talking about this has never happened before this is impossible what do you do and he takes it and he begins to do it and then brother adam said that was a sign of the miraculous that in the middle of all that doubt there was a man that heard from god ah hallelujah what about a sign in this generation in the middle of all the doubt and the confusion there's a people that say i've heard from god and judgment is coming upon this earth and you better get into the ark he said that was one of the greatest miraculous things that took place the show of omnipotence that a man was out there beating a nail in some wood hello i mean that's kind of mind-blowing when you think about the universe versus a nail and some wood but omnipotences spoke and the miraculous has taken place and it was during a time that people's hearts had waxed cold and got away from god and women were becoming an idol sons of god seen the daughters of men that they were fair and it become a sexual thing and jesus said before noah's time at the end they were given marrying and giving in marriage and the great turmoil that was going on the miraculous was taking place because omnipotence spoke and he said these things are going to happen again in this day as jesus prophesied it to be so he said as it was in the days of noah so shall it be so there's great turmoil again there's evil spirits that are entered into people and doing the same works that they did in that day he said but notice not only that he said when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose oh hallelujah and let me tell you right now while we were on this subject hell is limited [Applause] all hell can turn loose but it's got limitations upon it but when all heaven turns loose it has no limitations there is no limit to what god can do there is limits to what satan can do hallelujah satan already had you one time but he had limits upon him he can only take you so far he can only do so much but when god gets a hold of you when god grabs your life there's so many there's no limitations he said when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises the standard of it so it shows that in every junction both forces are at work but one has limits one has no limits hallelujah amen it showed because in the middle of all of that as we just heard amen in it was walking with god and he was not because god took him showed there was no limits to god he could take a man and change his whole molecule make up to where he just took him he said at the same time evil was appearing angels were appearing we've been hearing that right so don't get your eyes just on the evil realize when evil's appearing there's angels also appearing amen angels being moved into men moving in men angels appearing on earth this is a very beautiful type of the day noah was preaching a message that seemed so crazy to the world sounds like our message people that are crazy it's idiotic it's old-fashioned it's old folky ideas it's really quite opposite of what noah know it was kind of on the cutting edge of technology and they didn't see it then amen here he was right at the very edge of the only thing that could save you was a boat and here noah was preparing the ark and brother of adam said that's the miracle he said that how a man upon dry land where water had never come rain and never fallen was putting nails in some wood preparing a heart to float on the mighty sea where there was no sea amen but by faith noah was warned of god and no matter how foolish it seemed or how fanatical it seemed it was a miracle in itself to see a man hammering away something that seemed so fanatic fanatical and it's repeated again when men are pounding away at the gospel of the lord jesus christ and they're preaching the baptism of the holy ghost and they're getting people ready for the coming judgment or a shield from it anyways he said a modern church people are laughing and making fun and saying there's nothing to it and days of miracles are passed but i say preacher keep on putting the nails in keep on hammering away the appeal have to have the holy ghost the token they go in the rapture keep on hammering away that jesus christ is the same yesterday to tell him forever keep hammering he heals he delivers he's safe he does it all amen we got to keep hammering at it i don't care who walks away who laughs and who makes fun they did it before but they did it again but there's a no one that's going to stay right there and say this is my word i've heard from it and i'm gonna keep hammering hallelujah till that last board gets in place and he says come on in hallelujah that's not just on preachers that's also on your father's at home keep hammering keep hammering bible holiness keep hammering caught in this he says we know we're working not only was performing the miracle but then while it was having it he was also looking for a miracle hallelujah and the church today he says is laboring away under the task of preaching the gospel signs and wonders following but they're also preparing for a miracle the rapture of the church they're going away to home preparing people getting them to the light unburden them from the things of the world getting their soul set on the presence of god and when jesus does appear in the second time in glory those who are ready who are ready will rapture and will be caught up together to meet him in the air and to be with him for eternity my god but as it wasn't noah's time so to be now eating drinking marriage giving in marriage all these things you see are signposts evil getting increasingly worse signposts but supernatural miracles hanging right before us today signpost the second coming of the lord jesus christ speaking of the saints speaking or pointing towards the second coming of the lord jesus christ and we're at a junction again but as noah began to warn people and preach many of them laughed at him and scoffed at him because his message seemed entirely out of reason or may i say it like this even maybe out of season out of the time that you would expect it because why would a man build an ark when there's never been no rain and he's on dry land he's not even by the ocean perhaps he's on dry land putting this thing up why because god said so amen he said why he said he said and then he said today he said how people today when they should then they say they got the best doctors in the world we got the best clinics we've ever had we got more knowledge than we ever had we got more abilities than we ever had why do we need divine healing he said today we need divine healing worse than we ever needed it and as the day goes on and on it'll be more and more needed but noah just went right on the morning folks it's going to rain he'd get turned down it's going to rain people didn't even know what rain meant it was a new word didn't even know what rain meant never rain before there's people in the world today he said after 2 000 years of gospel preaching they don't even know what it means to be born again oh my god and that's the truth oh yeah well you know just you're saved once always saved you believe the message you're saved and they bring their baptist ideas and their methodist ideas and their pentecostal right into the message but when he said you must be born again and he said even after 2 000 years of gospel preaching people still don't know what that means and even after a hundred and years or 120 years people still didn't know what rain meant they don't know what omnipotence means they don't know a god that is omnipotent they don't know a god that can transform a soul from a straight center to an angelic position hello somebody amen the kingdom into the in the gods kingdom as sons and daughters of god they don't understand it they never have been there they don't know maybe they've been taken up too much in the things of the world and infatuated with and flirting in the glaring don't realize that's an evil spirit and but it's a great marking signpost for the people this day to watch and be ready because jesus said when those things come to pass look up your redemption draweth nigh we're at a junction but here's another miracle omnipotence all-powerful gave the plan and the day came he said noah get in the ark and out came two by two every animal what did that some you know i've seen one time as a child i believe it was a movie of noah walking through the ark playing some flute and all the animals was following that music baloney no no it was omnipotence it was back to to the point really where god came down in such a way to where it was almost back and i i i just say it like there's an eating condition omnipotence moving showing his power over all nature to where it says quick he could quicken a lion's heart and say get in the ark amen and that he listened he sure did we went right in there some people got more ain't got enough sense of the line or a mule or a donkey or whatever a donkey yeah even a donkey can hear the voice of god yeah we've seen that in the bible and but the voice of god omnipotence can speak he spoke and how many how many went on the ark but how many heard how many heard the message people now how many went on the ark how many heard the message a bunch shall we say thousands i don't know how many it was and then i i wonder how many i this i said this before but it still blows my mind that when you witness animals walking on the ark two by two where's man's thinking at that moment because apparently something's going on in their mind because they they they're they're looking at the supernatural realm and they're not perceiving what that is that's exactly what can happen in the service the supernatural god fall in and it may not be animals walking two by two but it may be an old street prostitute or some sinner they may find their moment in christ or somebody be healed or delivered and they don't know what that is that's omnipotent speaking that's the all-powerful god moving in hearts it ought to do something but he said one of the greatest miracles was omnipotence that gave the plan and the magnificent said build it this long build it this high do it this way and it'll keep you if you'll follow my plan it'll keep you and the waters begin to come and the dell used floods plagues and every kind of thing was falling you know it was just rising above it all right amen here brother said the miracle was in the middle of the flood noah was tucked away in the ark of safety thunder was going on flags were falling rain was falling noah was resting noah had found play a place in the middle of the storm that he could find in the omnipotent god mercy jesus he said those that want to laugh at you and make fun of you today but maybe maybe because the way you act cause you dress because you don't cut your hair because whatever they don't realize you're tucked away in omnipotence don't realize you're restless resting safely as you can be in omnipotence and nothing can harm you the water begins to come the people began to scream cry holler carry on instead of the ark just staying there it floated right up all the time packing noah and cradled him along the waves sure it was a signpost and god swept the world clean of sin and he was going to start a new one and signs and wonders appeared before he did it it was another a time of junction was that abraham when god would call abraham out from among his kindred and say hey i have your land i have your place that you can go to omnipotence spoke to him and he called him out of his own people to walk with god oh my how we can take testimony after testimony of people that are sitting in this building they don't have daddies that believe the message they don't have ken folks that believe the message but omnipotence spoke to him and said come walk with me hallelujah this was abraham get out of him come out of that place and come walk with me abraham and he told he said i'm going to make you a father of many nations amen only the way he could speak it is he had to perform it or otherwise he wouldn't be omnipotent he wouldn't be all powerful if he couldn't do what he said he would do and then not only that he told sarah that she was going to bear her son and though she was bearing odd omnipotent spoke and it came to pass oh hallelujah that tells me that he's still omnipotent today and if he's still omnipotent today because he said he's the same yesterday today and forever then if he spoke against baroness and baroness had to flee tonight he's still the same god amen i can witness him to be the same god because i see a people sitting here that was one time unfruitful and barren and omnipotent spoke over your life and said you will bring forth fruit you will bring forth eternal life and they were changed back from an old man and woman to be able to bring forth seed again we see another one it was a junction for 400 years of prophecy it went forth and laid dormant seemed like it was uh god just moved off the scene nobody heard from him his people went off into slavery his his uh seed his elect his people had went off into slavery been lured into egypt been made slaves and it seemed like god had forgotten him but he never forgot first thing he he came down a supernatural sign to show again he was omnipotent and that he lived and maybe the priests and the rabbis and forces of that day thought that god no longer existed just like you may do today but god is still omnipotent no matter what your thought says he still performs miracles no matter what your doubt says amen they thought he'd gone out of existence but right in the middle of all that chaos in the middle of all that struggle in the middle of all that trouble he comes down to a lowly humble family of levi and he gives him a son and said his name will be moses and omnipotence spoke and said this will be my deliverer prophecy came to fulfillment and it goes out and it seemed like nothing was yet still happening the boy got put in the nile but omnipotence was always there amen crocodiles would come look sniff the basket but omnipotence was there amen until it was taken right to the pharaoh's daughter and raised up in the house of pharaoh god right under the nose of satan raising his own destruction oh hallelujah right under the nose of satan god was raising his own leader to lead his people out of bondage amen it seemed like it was went to nothing when he killed two egyptians but god got him out on the backside of a desert so he could hear from god for himself that omnipotence could speak to him and show him the miraculous and he came and he showed it to him showed him the days of miracles wouldn't pass no more put his hand in this in his bosom that came out leprosy put his hand back in there and it came out clean he would throw a rod down it would turn to a serpent he'd pick it back up and it turned to a rod he was showing him and all the way through the ten plagues i'm omnipotent i can create flies out of nothing i can create frogs out of nothing amen god showed right there he don't have to have anything to work with he also shows it today he don't have to have anything to work with amen he wants somebody that's willing amen and here he was amen brother adam said you know they had the word they had joseph's bones them things are all right there were signs yes that god still lived and but still beside the word they had but besides all of that they had an omnipotent god who would not fail them who was the same yesterday today and forever and he stood in the midst of them he attached himself to their struggle and he became their their deliverer and he destroyed egypt and changed the whole scene performed miracle after miracle sign after sign he said it's amazing he said a man can think he can comprehend an unlimited god he said to do that you have to come in contact for yourself with his omnipotence then when you do that you're in contact with supernatural realms you're in contact and your life will change your thinking will change your mind will change you'll be made different your sickness is finished god's great power moves in when moses saw him at the burning bush he saw an omnipotent god he saw the miraculous and he went down there to take those signs to set god's people free he now saw it for himself his mama told him about it his daddy had told him about it but now he met god for himself this is why people fall off the side roads young people especially maybe older folks alike because they've been told about it they've been preached about it they they they they've heard about it all their life been raised up in it but they haven't seen it for themselves i'm not talking about seeing it for themselves in somebody else that's awesome too i mean yes sir you can see god is omnipotent we saw it many times in our own congregation when god would come down and heal the sick but what about god being omnipotent in your life amen this is where he wants to get to and so therefore he would come in another junction and there's others but i'll move on down because we're running out of time he'd come in one of the greatest junctions in man's history was when he came down to be a savior and jesus and and what happened it was in a dark time again it was in a political unrest it was do you notice what happens it always comes junctions happen in those times moses all the noah's abrahams oh now jesus political unrest you know things that are going on that they can't make sense or heads or tails out of and and then even there when they're expecting him to come but when he comes they're not expecting to come that way they're looking forward to when you're going to get where what you're doing you're healing a few people where that's wonderful signs and things are taking place but when's the romans leaving that was looking for a temporary deliverance instead of eternal deliverance hey man that's what god wants you to have more than just a temporary deliverance god wants you to have something that's eternal and eternal is omnipotence amen that's what the holy ghost is is eternal therefore the holy ghost is omnipotence amen but it would come in a time when the miraculous would seem so far away it would seem so impossible laws and judges and and people that were there and all the things that were taking place and the priests and their ideas and and things were saying well days and miracles were passed there hadn't been a prophet for hundreds of years and at the same time an angel appears to a priest angels start appearing things start taking place the vast majority are missing it they expect them to come with a a salute from heaven and coming down stepping on red red robes and or purple robes and red carpet and walk down to caiaphas and say i'm here give him my sword i'm going to drive the romans out that wasn't the way he came angels started appearing it appeared to zechariah zachary zacharias and it appeared to a little a virgin named mary and it appeared to some shepherds on a hill amen things began to take place but the vast majority was missing it not even knowing omnipotence was about to come in human flesh and you know what omnipotence first words were on earth wow a cry of a baby this is why brother brandon would pick it up and he said you know he said people missed it because it was they missed him being jehovah because it was jehovah has a baby it was jehovah as a teenager running down a road falling and skinning his knees it was jehovah and human flesh the greatest one of the greatest junctions ever happened before and god about to show his omnipotent power and angels come and begin to prophesy a prophet comes on the scene and they thought he was crazy i know some people as they say are getting offended about creepy john let me tell you he wasn't exactly sane sounding kind of person man is out in the wilderness and eating wild honey and locusts and all that kind of stuff and all no doubt all kind of stories circulating about him and he wasn't exactly uh how a normal person would operate because he wasn't normal and let me let you just in on something you ain't normal either at least i hope you're not normal to this world matter of fact it ought to put a rejoicing in my our heart to realize i am not normal compared to this world but i am normal compared to where i come from [Applause] hallelujah i've said it before amen when you go overseas you go to romania i've been to russia and you go over there i'm not normal i don't talk normal i don't look normal i don't act normal i have funny mannerisms i have all kinds of stuff and even in the united states there's places i ain't normal let's just be honest you don't have to cross too far in line we just go out over to mississippi and you won't be normal no more ain't that right hey that's why brother joe's the way he's in he's not from louisiana he's from mississippi amen but the weight reason i am the way i am and let's get beyond the humanity amen be the reason we're not the normal as far as far as the world's considered normal let me tell you what's normal to the world anymore is a man thinking himself to be a woman racing with women and that's considered normal let me tell you what's considered normal to the world is a woman to cut off her hair and wear men's apparel and think herself to still be a woman that's considered normal it's considered so much normal that even when we look at it we don't even hardly don't hardly turn their stomach no more because we've seen it so much it's become a sense of normality about it but the man does the other side it won't be too long and that'll be normal it's the truth but i'm not normal when it comes to this world i don't ever plan on being normal john the baptist wasn't no jesus wasn't normal amen when he went in amen and turned over their theirs carts and destroyed their temple that wasn't a normal thing to do when he went in he would go to the pool of bethesda and he would heal that man that wasn't a normal kind of day when he would go there and he'd heal a blind man or or read another day about the withered arm he'd come into this into the synagogue and he said stretch forth your hand and it would stretch that wasn't a normal kind of service to them it ought to be but it wasn't it ought to be normal in our churches to have healings it ought to be normal in our churches to have baptisms it ought to be normal in our churches to have somebody fall at an altar and say god i'm sorry it ought to be normal in our churches for people to worship god with all their hearts it ought to be normal to get beyond what's normal [Applause] that was all free the unbelievers waxed worse they downed it they fussed at it john the baptist they fussed at it jesus they fussed at it tried to get away finally would kill anyone that said anything but god moved on in the miraculous just the same for he's omnipotent he has to if he's god amen here he would come down as god to where and he would begin to express himself the omnipotence made flesh dwelling among us as a human you can't be normal and do that walking among us as he walked on the sea of galilee one night yonder little as he was out there on this old boat tossed about he acted like he didn't even pay any attention to it he was tired but something was about to happen and but when he put his foot upon the braille of that boat and he said peace be still he said i'll tell you the very creator of heavens and earth laid in that boat and all nature had to obey it just like it did with noah because it was the same omnipotence speaking and when omnipotence speaks miraculous takes place i remember the leper full of leprosy went to him one day and said lord if thy will make me clean he touched him and said i will be thou clean i've never just spoke and the miraculous took place and the leprosy vanished oh hallelujah i believe he's still that same kind of god listen we don't have to have treatment after treatment after treatment omnipotent speaks and it can vanish it's done it before it'll do it again when omnipotence speaks miraculous happens he healed the sick he raised the dead he opened the eyes of the blind proven to the people a junction is right here something is taking place he says in john 17 he looked up and said father the hour has come the junction is here all things are ready the crossroad is here the world's been warned how will no any of these apostles when they've done signs and wonders they pass through the land they comb back and forth the time is here the time has come brother brennan would bring it right to our day said brother as a gospel preacher this morning i believe the holy ghost speaking through mortal lips anointing ministers are speaking the time has come the time is here omnipotence is answering and the miraculous has taken place we are at a junction hallelujah amen we had a junction in brother branham's day when heaven would open and said seven thunders would be revealed would reveal the seventh seal it was a junction that took place and thousands have missed it millions have missed it political unrest yes it was political unrest segregation and all the things that were going on wars and rumors of war there was all kinds of things going on and angels appeared why because there was junctions taking place omnipotence was speaking and a word came forth and said i will have a bride even though for me to have a pride she's got to have somebody she can believe and signs began to go forth and the sick were healed and the blind could see and all the things that would happen why because omnipotence was speaking but it don't end there did you hear me it don't end there and i'm going to put my voice with the prophet again we are at another junction we are at the coming of the lord political rest is in its place spirits on every hand is at his place wickedness wickedness is that is pinnacle and things are taking place but angels are also appearing god is also moving the time is calm for the miraculous to take place the time has called for healings and bodies are you saying is that so yes we're getting ready for the greatest divine healing campaign that ever touched the earth so great that old gray hair is going to come back new again bones that are withered away are going to come back strong again limbs that are missing are going to come back the time has come i say the time has come and the miraculous is here omnipotence is speaking and again in god as we heard sunday god is looking through that pillar of fire at your enemy and that enemy that's held you for time after time after time i want you to know brother aaron god is looking through that pillar of fire the devil might be lord excuse me the doctor may be looking through x-rays or cat scans or every kind of thing but god's got something greater he said those things are limited they can only find certain things but god can look at you and say it's this and it's that and it's over it's time for the miraculous to take place hallelujah are you saying well brother we've already seen it yes we have been seen it what happened here when a little frail 90 pound year where a little woman came running around this building omnipotence had spoke to her and said why do you have to dread what do you have to fear you're leaning on the arms of your beloved why don't you get out of your bed you're a little place and begin to give me praise and out of her seat she came as again the glorified god and worship god and omnipotence spoke how do you know because the cancer was gone [Applause] oh my god that message wasn't just for atlanta butts not a message that message for whosoever will what are you afraid of what about the doubt that fear that's had you paralyzed why don't you get out of that thing and give god praise and that thing will leave you because omnipotence has spoken amen we was put here right in our midst the sign of a little girl that had lost her hair and omnipotent spoke and said she's gonna have her hair back and it was so what was it a sign of a church whose hair had been cut off the power had been cut off thanks to the dark ages have been cut off but now she's back to full strength again she's back to full life again she's back to full power again she back to the fullness again of godhead building flesh the time has come and it is here omnipotence he would say to jesus speak the word lord that man that centurion speak the word lord my servant will be healed my servant will live he knew jesus was a man of authority he knew there was more than just a man standing there he knew it was god felt in flesh lord i'm not worthy you come to my house just speak the word he knew that was omnipotence amen he knew the miraculous would take place when he stood at the grave of lazarus crying like a man martha said lord if you'd only been here my brother not died but even now but even now amen some of you martha's need to start speaking even now my body's dying but even now amen my spirit seems to be going down but even now my children seem to be going further but even now amen it seems like all hope is gone but even now and omnipotence begins to speak amen what was it lit god living among us he goes down there grave weeping but as he stood at that grave and he wiped those tears away bill brown said omnipotence gathered itself together oh god may omnipotence tonight gather itself together gathered itself together and it spoke lazarus come forth and a man had been rotten his nose fell in and his face skin warms us had come into his body but corruption knew its master and he gave life back to this dead man again and a dead man stood to his feet miraculous and he said i am the resurrection and the life [Applause] i hear it again speaking in this hour i am the resurrection in the life brother ham's been sick i am the resurrection and the lies brother tim's have problems in his body i am the resurrection alive brother ron's got cancer i am the resurrection and the lie if he can take an old dead body and raise him up from the grave again omnipotence is here to speak life to these bodies to speak life to ron spencer to speak life to you tonight you might have been feeling dead for a long time you might have been bound by every kind of creed in every kind of darkness but i say in the name of jesus go forth come forth come out of your grave clothes come out of your things in your life come out of your complexes come out of your fears come out of those things come out of your sickness when i'm nipping the speech the miraculous takes place [Applause] we are at a junction so we are at the time miracles take place [Music] well blessed be the name of the lord when omnipotence speaks a dead man will live again and stand on his feet and go to a banquet and eat supper with him and he said i remember one glorious day when i was dead and sin and trespasses omnipotent spoke we were going to hell but i've never been spoke and we're raised from hell to court and someday we're going to be at that banquet table because oblivious and spoke in our life and what's something with a limited power going to be able to do with somebody that's got unlimited power in them [Applause] [Music] hallelujah praise the lord you got a few more minutes omnipotence and speaking we are at a place we are at a junction it's time to take the shackles off of him time to take the limitations off our services hey man you people you preachers out there take the limitations off of god let him save people let him heal people let him deliver people take your your creeds and your dogmas off of him we're at a junction something's happening time you start raising your head up redemption is right here omnipotence is speaking the miraculous has taken place we're at a junction he has raised the dead he has healed the sick he's done all these things let me go down to some things real quick as we bring this down unlimited power he said his power is still the same tonight as it was the day he poured it out upon the church so every preacher that says it ain't go back and don't preach no more till you get christ hey that's exactly what somebody just sent me that from spurgeon i thought well that's good enough to use he said if christ ain't in your sermon he said you go home and don't say another word till you get christ in there and people that say the power ain't the same they ain't got christ the people that says his power is limited don't have christ the same the people that say that god don't heal no more god don't save no more mercy is over they don't have christ they might have a creed they might have a dogma they might have their own idea but they don't have jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he said you people has tasted the realms of the golden cup of his blessings i mean it's been on that cup how could you believe anything else but what the holy ghost is here tonight to heal everyone let's take the limits off of him amen he said you how many has been drinking from that golden cup of his blessings he said how could you believe anything else but what the holy ghost is here tonight to heal everyone and to feel everyone whoa hallelujah if he's the same yesterday today and forever his power is the same he's unlimited his powers is just the same today as it ever was let him speak and let us be silent [Music] and he can speak hallelujah he said see he says in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel to preach then you've got to have the power and demonstration the holy spirit to prove that is the gospel he said the letter killeth the word the letter killeth but the spirit maketh alive so it's not just a ritualistic affair but it's an absolutely real living reality of the resurrected christ jesus christ living among us that the faith that i'm going to try my best to contend for today that that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and his power is unlimited he said if you can limit god you can limit christ and if you can limit the church today and its possibilities you are limiting god but all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe to receive it and you shall have it he said brethren when when the brethren receive the baptism of the holy ghost and they begin to think this is the summit this is the all of it uh this quote about sent me into a into a world whatever i don't into another realm he said but brother that's wrong there is no summit to god's power that's why the next service can be greater than the last service in our mind and our limitations we have a great service and we think man there ain't no way it could be any better than this and the next service have you seen it at meetings the next service god called well there ain't no way it's gonna get any better than that his power is unlimited it is us that has that thinking in our mind that services can only be so good they can only be so great things can only go so far things can only be so much but there is no summit to god's power i want you to tell you'll never get to the top of it you'll never get to the end of it you'll move on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of god that hasn't even been tapped into yet hello hello mercy jesus i mean we it was great powers being demonstrated in that day it could never be no greater than that that's your limitations it can never be no greater than the profit that's your limitations it can never be no greater we put limitations and he's telling us there's never an end to the unlimited resources of god that hasn't even been tapped into yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about mercy jesus amen it had never has been revealed to archangels and is laying just ahead for his church that will believe for i has not seen ear has not heard neither has entered into the hearts of man what god has in store for them that love him he said so what do we need to do we need to keep moving up we need to keep claiming our rights as god opens the gates and swings the welcome mat out let's move on to deeper depths never organize ourselves or get to a place where this is it and we believe this and that's all let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from god he said i think that's the way it ought to be every more motive of every man or woman that loves the lord jesus is to receive all that you can help somebody is to receive all that you care from the hand of his bountiful mercies that's my heart if that's the heart of a prophet it ought to be our heart amen he says another place he said if you could ever get real good fundamental faith against pentecost to people or fundamental doctrine with the pentecostal people or vice versa he said i'd like to see what that meeting would be when the people realize that you're not you will be you not it's not you will be you are present tense right now sons and daughters of an unlimited god you're pushing it way off the millennium somewhere all the blessings out to the millennium and that's how we read those scriptures what we just read eye has not seen years i know it does pertain to part of that in the in the eternals but i also believe we're at a junction we're at the blending of time of an eternity of two dispensations of two realms eyes have not seen and ears have not heard but we keep pushing it off somewhere he said we don't need divine healing off in the millennium we need it right now we won't be sons of god we're now sons of god heirs joiners with jesus and everything that jesus died for at calvary is your possession now satan don't like that if people would only realize and just be willing to take god at his word well it's unlimited did you hear that well it's unlimited he said i was speaking with a doctor here a lot long ago he was talking to me said oh you're a minister it's just sorry i've studied stuff that stuff for about four years i said you did one well what hindered you he said i got to find out there wasn't nothing to it and he said you studied it for just four years to be a minister and you come to find out is i got tangled up he said that's where it is he said you got an x-ray machine you can look at the human body and so forth well that's wonderful that's a tree of knowledge that was in the garden of eden man been eaten from that tree from eating since since eden he said but it's got limitations it can only do so much the tree of knowledge has limitations i don't care how much education you got it has limitations he said well i i'm just i i just know it all man you sound like well you know it's kind of like this men think begins to think of themselves so big and they'll take some precious metals and they'll put it make little pieces out of it little gears and little things and they'll place it all in this little case put this nice dial over it and put a and it keeps time but eventually it quits eventually it stops but they've done something they made some achievement a watch that's a watch is the mechanism of man and god would take dust elements and he would form a body that does incredible things has been doing incredible things since you've been sitting in your seat sales and all kinds of things and all the way down and the sinews and all the things that works and just the what what it takes to even take a step all the muscles it takes all the things sinews it takes the bone structure the heart to beat i mean it's it's you start looking as almost an unlimited thing the billions of sales or however many there are and man made a watch and he thinks he's something and a watch is man's mechanism but god makes a man and he's the mechanism of god does that even in that ought to show you how much more billions of times uncontainable times past god's knowledge is of man but yet man gets a little education he said i've learned something and you know i'm not even talking about a formal education necessarily that's that's one thing but you can have some except we say it educated rednecks hard knocks and he thinks he's something because he's done this and he can do this and he's a macgyver he figured it all out and his life is that he lives 90 something years is that without god but with god in there it's no longer no longer limited he said this is where it is he said this for this this man has got on this tree of knowledge he said but it's limited it's limited it has limitations he says you can believe science as far as science can go and you can take it off as far as it will go he said but what you need to do when you get to the end of it is step off of it onto the tree of life then it's unlimited he said see god in god you will never exhaust god's love and mercy oh my my my you will he said well i hate to bother you so much father i hate to bother you tonight he wants you to bother him he loves you to bother him don't ever think that you could ever ask too much of god you say you but the scripture says you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our joys will be full he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed [Applause] we use that scripture as a almost as a crutch was just a little mustard seed he said don't even limit it to a mustard seed he said get on out there to some other kind of faith move out and ask big things big things are just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all and you've got faith you know exactly how to use it it'll be all right you can never run out so what you're scared about the bible says jesus was the lamb of god slain from the foundation of the world all this hope builds on our heart burns in our heart how it gives us hope way back before the foundation of the world when satan perverted to evil god being infinite looked down to the stream of time and saw the end for knowledge if you don't know all things you have a limited god and you made him finite just like you and i but god is unlimited god's power god's knowledge god's everything he is omnipotent way back before the foundation of the world when satan come to destroy god already was looking to see how he was going to counteract it he already had the answer for it he goes and goes into brother brown goes on a sign i'm bringing it down my grandfather wrote an aux cart i wrote i ride in a ford v8 my son will fly in the jet plane that's what we're removing he said that's what religion ought to be the coming of the lord is hand the church ought to be moving on into the powers of god own into the powers of god science can only climb so far then it drops off but we've got untapped resources that's never been touched to the power of unlimited god and we ought to be moving on into it as hard as we can go brothers and sisters we're living a million miles below our privileges tonight as christians as sons and daughters of god he said i feel ashamed of myself when i look out there and i see institutions and sickness and troubles going on right now our church ought to be walking the street healing the sick raising the dead casting out devils doing signs and wonders making the whole world realize jesus christ is alive mercy he would come down into revelations and he'd say dear don't fear john don't fear little flock all that i am you're in there too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that's my covenant and it will never fail omnipotence let omnipotent speak let the voice of god speak and healing will come deliverances will come salvation will come that omnipotence speak we are at a junction we're right at the doorsteps of the coming of the lord we're not looking at less we're looking at more lit omnipotent speakers father place these things in my heart lord and they've been burning the lord just seeing you in your scripture and your word and seeing the power that's availed to us lord don't let our faith limit you god all you need is one that'll reach out in faith lord there was many that failed to realize your limited your unlimited power as you walked down the streets there in that dusty road but lord the lord there was one he said he has the resources i need if i could just touch the hem of his garment i will be made whole lord it just takes one two said yes lord i want to touch you lord i want omnipotence to speak and her touch lord turned you around and omnipotent spoke and her blood as you quit the lord had troubled her for years lord there's some here tonight lord that's had sicknesses in their body that's troubled them for a long time but omnipotence is here to speak lord we're not looking through a doctor's x-ray we're not looking through a cat scan an mri that has limitations can see only so much but lord tonight we want to step off the tree of knowledge and step onto the tree of life and lord of the omnipotents speak in bodies tonight and deliverance has come to your people we're in the time of deliverance lord we love you father how wonderful you are it's ours to use it's availed to us tonight lord oh jesus he didn't come to bring fear and failure to come to bring love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and outperform it that's my covenant and it cannot feel you're not in the business of failing lord we love you father i praise you jesus thank you lord yes lord yes jesus [Music] is you were with me [Music] my [Music] foreign [Music] foreign oh by your stripes [Music] [Music] yes [Music] oh [Music] more than you know you know i was speaking just now as i was praying about the moment he touched the hem of his garment i believe there's some people here that wants to touch his garment and i believe there's many needs in the building needs of healing deliverances bitterness that needs to be dealt with fears if you've seen omnipotence walking through the building and you want to touch this garment i want to invite everyone whatever need i i'm not going to ask your need to be specific i don't want to invite everyone that wants to come down here and we're going to touch him tonight i'm going to touch the hem of his garment omnipotence is going to speak miracles are going to take place i don't care if you're a deacon trustee preacher whatever need you have [Music] hallelujah you can say i have a need just keep moving around filling in so people can get here hallelujah oh yes lord
