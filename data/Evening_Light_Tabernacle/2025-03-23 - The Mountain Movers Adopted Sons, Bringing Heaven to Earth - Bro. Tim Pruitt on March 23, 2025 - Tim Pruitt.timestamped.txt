[43:54] see through eyes
[44:00] alone. A

[44:56] Oh, if not for amazing grace.
[45:00] [Music]
[45:06] Oh, how sweet the sound. How sweet the
[45:10] sound. Thank you, Jesus. I once was
[45:12] lost. I once was lost. Was
[45:17] lost. Oh, but now I'm found. But now I'm
[45:22] like in a hopeless case.
[45:26] A
[45:27] hopeless case.
[45:31] Oh, an
[45:33] empty
[45:36] place. If not, oh amazing
[45:40] [Music]
[45:43] grace.
[45:44] Amazing grace.
[45:50] How
[45:50] sweet the
[45:54] sound. Oh, I once was
[45:59] lost. Oh, but
[46:02] now I'm
[46:05] found. Oh, a
[46:08] hopeless
[46:11] cave. Yes, an empty
[46:17] place. Save
[46:19] not. Precious Lord, take my
[46:22] hand. Oh, precious
[46:28] Lord, please take my
[46:34] hand. Oh, lead me.
[46:40] Oh, oh, help me
[46:46] stand. A
[46:48] homeless
[46:52] case, an empty
[46:57] place if
[46:59] not for
[47:02] praise. Let's stand together this
[47:04] morning as we get ready for the
[47:07] word. Just sing that song, reach out and
[47:10] touch the Lord as he passes by. You
[47:14] believe he's here this morning. Yes,
[47:16] sir. You believe he's here to meet needs
[47:17] and to touch hearts. Yes, sir. Amen. If
[47:21] you really believe he's here, why don't
[47:22] you just lift that hand and say, "I want
[47:24] to reach out and touch you this morning.
[47:26] Lord, I I don't want to let you go by me
[47:29] and may not recognize your presence
[47:32] around me. Lord, I want to reach out to
[47:35] you today and say,
[47:37] "Father, thou son of David, have mercy
[47:39] on me.
[47:41] Reach down and touch my need, oh God.
[47:44] And may I respond to you today, Father.
[47:48] Oh, reach
[47:50] out, touch the
[47:53] Lord as he
[47:56] passes by.
[48:00] You will find he's not too
[48:04] busy to hear your heart's cry.
[48:11] What if this is your moment?
[48:15] Your needs
[48:18] to
[48:20] supply. Reach out and touch the
[48:25] Lord as
[48:27] he does. Oh, reach out. Reach out and
[48:33] touch the
[48:35] Lord. As he
[48:38] passes
[48:40] by, you'll find he's not too
[48:45] busy to hear your
[48:51] heart. He's fast.
[48:55] [Music]
[48:57] her needs
[48:58] to
[49:00] smile. Reach out and touch the
[49:06] Lord as
[49:08] he goes by. One more time, reach out.
[49:13] Just reach out right
[49:15] now. Touch him this
[49:17] morning. And whatever needs you have in
[49:19] your life, let him speak to you. Let him
[49:23] reveal himself to you through the word.
[49:26] He's not too busy. Oh no.
[49:31] Amen. He ever lives to make
[49:34] intercession on your behalf this
[49:36] morning. Your needs
[49:39] to
[49:41] supply. So reach
[49:43] out and touch the
[49:46] Lord as
[49:49] he goes
[49:51] by. And they that
[49:54] wait upon the
[49:56] Lord shall
[49:59] renew their
[50:01] strength, and they shall mount up with
[50:06] wings and an
[50:11] eagle. They shall run and not be
[50:16] weary. They shall walk and not faint.
[50:22] Teach me
[50:24] Lord. Teach me
[50:27] Lord to wait. Father, as we bow our
[50:31] heads before you
[50:32] today, we want to thank you for the
[50:35] grace of God, the favor that's upon our
[50:38] lives, for your mercy that endures to
[50:41] all generations.
[50:43] Lord, it speaks to hearts, speaks to
[50:46] life. I pray Lord you'll speak today and
[50:49] reveal yourself through the word. Oh God
[50:53] may that you just take the word of God
[50:55] and write it within our hearts within
[50:58] our own natures so that we will be the
[51:01] manifested word of God. We're your
[51:04] children today, Lord. We're waiting upon
[51:08] you. We're asking, Lord, that you'll
[51:11] minister to our hearts, Lord. that
[51:13] you'll lift us up above the shadows, the
[51:16] troubles of this world, Lord, and and
[51:19] cause us to go and to rise into heavenly
[51:23] places in Christ Jesus. To come boldly
[51:27] before the throne of grace and find help
[51:30] in our time of need, knowing Lord that
[51:33] we as children have a right to your
[51:35] presence through our birth, which is
[51:38] through the blood of Jesus. We ask God
[51:41] your blessings upon us today. May your
[51:44] Holy Spirit just speak to us Lord
[51:46] through the word. And oh God, I'm just a
[51:50] man and I I have before me Lord
[51:53] fragments of thoughts and scriptures
[51:56] that come from the word of God and and
[52:01] and Lord, that's what they are. They're
[52:04] just little fragments laying out there.
[52:07] But if you'll just take them, Father,
[52:10] and you'll take them and bring it as a
[52:12] message to your
[52:14] people, Lord, not just a a word that is
[52:18] a letter that I kill, but a spirit with
[52:21] it that'll make it a living word. May
[52:24] the power and the anointing of our
[52:26] Christ be with us today. Will you give
[52:29] ears to the hearer to hear? Will you
[52:32] give Lord uncction to the speaker to
[52:36] speak? for we can do nothing without
[52:38] you. And we're asking now, Father,
[52:41] you'll just move us aside this morning.
[52:44] And let your Holy Spirit speak in ways
[52:46] that man cannot. Minister the hearts of
[52:49] men and women. There are some that are
[52:51] sick this morning. May they know that
[52:54] there's a healer in the house. And
[52:56] that's not just another man, but it's
[52:58] the man Christ Jesus who is wounded for
[53:01] our transgressions, who was bruised for
[53:03] our iniquities, who the chastisement of
[53:07] our peace was upon him when he laid
[53:11] aside his godship to become man and walk
[53:15] among us to take on human battles. I
[53:18] pray Lord that you will bless your
[53:20] people today. those under the sound of
[53:22] my voice, those as enter on the internet
[53:24] listening, those that are in the nursing
[53:26] homes and and and and shut away, Lord,
[53:30] not able to come to service today, maybe
[53:33] in their homes gathered, you know what
[53:35] their need is. Father, may the Holy
[53:37] Spirit, the abiding presence of God just
[53:40] come down and take its abode with them
[53:43] today. May the Holy Spirit just
[53:45] overshadow them. It's in the name of
[53:48] Jesus we ask it. Amen. And amen. God
[53:52] bless you. Amen. Thank you. We so
[53:56] appreciate the Lord and wonderful
[53:58] worship unto him. And I believe that he
[54:00] draws nigh as we worship him as the
[54:04] praises of the people of God up into his
[54:06] presence. He draws near to come among
[54:09] us. And so I'm so happy that you're here
[54:12] today. We just pray that you'll be
[54:15] blessed in his presence. Amen. If you
[54:18] are a stranger here, you don't need to
[54:20] remain that. Amen. We We want to be
[54:23] friends with the body of Christ, whoever
[54:25] they are, wherever they are. And we're
[54:28] just so happy that you've assembled with
[54:29] us. Those of you that are online
[54:31] watching, we love you. And we just send
[54:34] our greetings to Sister Marilyn
[54:36] Griffith. She's there in the um nursing
[54:39] home in in mind. and um she's got a
[54:43] screen set up and able to to view the
[54:46] service today. So um you uh we just want
[54:50] to send her greetings today and our love
[54:52] and to all the ones that are listening
[54:54] in. Amen. Those that uh sometimes cannot
[54:57] come to church because of age that are
[55:00] gathered in their homes today and we
[55:02] pray that you'll you'll be blessed today
[55:05] in with his presence. Amen. And if
[55:08] you'll turn with me to Revelation
[55:09] chapter 5, we're going to get right into
[55:12] the word today. And you know, it's it's
[55:15] never a lack of anything to preach. God
[55:20] has given us abundant treasures in his
[55:22] word. And and so we we have no lack this
[55:27] morning. But we we do pray for the
[55:31] anointing of the spirit of God because
[55:34] without that uh it's all in vain. And
[55:37] we're just pray that God will help us to
[55:40] um help us to speak words today that
[55:43] would be
[55:44] lifegiving and and inspiring that would
[55:47] inspire our hearts to press forward.
[55:50] Amen. To move on in the things of God.
[55:52] Today we're going to be speaking on the
[55:55] mountain movers on the adopted sons
[55:58] bringing heaven to earth. And I'm going
[56:01] to just as you're looking there,
[56:03] Revelation 5, we're going to just tell
[56:06] you our theme again comes from Zechariah
[56:08] 4:7. Who art thou, oh great mountain?
[56:11] Thou shalt become a plain and the
[56:14] headstone shall be brought forth with
[56:16] shoutings, crying, grace, grace. That's
[56:19] God's double favor unto it. Amen.
[56:23] Revelation 5:1. And one of the elders
[56:26] said unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion
[56:28] of the tribe of Judah, the root of
[56:30] David, hath prevailed to open the book,
[56:32] and to loose the seven seals thereof.
[56:36] And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of
[56:37] the throne, and of the four beasts, and
[56:39] of the in the midst of the elders stood
[56:41] a lamb, as it had been slain, having
[56:44] seven horns, and seven eyes, which are
[56:47] the seven spirits, sent forth into all
[56:49] the earth. And he came and took the book
[56:52] out of the right hand of him that sat
[56:54] upon the throne. And when he had taken
[56:56] the book, the four beasts and four and
[56:59] 20 elders fell down before the lamb,
[57:02] having every one of them harps and
[57:04] golden vials full of odors, which are
[57:07] the prayers of the saints. And they sung
[57:10] a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
[57:12] take the book, and to open the seals
[57:15] thereof, for thou was slain, and hast
[57:17] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[57:21] every kindred and tongue and people and
[57:25] nation, and has made us unto our God
[57:30] kings and priest, and we shall reign on
[57:34] the earth. And because man is now in the
[57:38] process of taking the book of title to
[57:41] the earth, this positions us as kings
[57:46] and priests, and we shall bring heaven's
[57:49] dominion and rule on the earth. Amen.
[57:53] God bless you. You can be seated. Now
[57:56] just um maybe a little bit of review
[57:58] before we get into the the message and
[58:02] bring some new material this morning.
[58:04] But I just wanted to continue this
[58:06] thought that we have been speaking on
[58:09] and and of course you know the we've
[58:12] been speak speaking on the sealed book
[58:14] the titled deed to the earth and I want
[58:16] to say that this includes your earth
[58:20] your flesh your body and not only that
[58:23] but the bodies of all the saints
[58:27] um who we look for in the resurrection
[58:30] and uh I believe we're living in that
[58:32] day in that hour. Now in his divine
[58:35] vision, uh John beheld the Almighty
[58:39] seated upon the throne. Now there wasn't
[58:42] three sitting on the throne. There was
[58:44] but one sitting on the throne. And in
[58:47] his right hand was a book that was
[58:49] sealed with seven seals. And then then
[58:52] we see that this scene will change and
[58:54] and in Revelation five, we will see him
[58:57] step forth um and and he comes now as a
[59:02] lamb. And he's a funnyl looking lamb to
[59:04] us because it's all symbolic of what
[59:08] that he is doing upon the earth. His
[59:10] work in the gentile ages. And he has
[59:14] seven horns which has seven eyes which
[59:16] are seven ages and seven messengers
[59:19] through which God will deal with the
[59:22] gentile
[59:23] dispensation. And and and so uh he holds
[59:27] in his hand now a book that is sealed
[59:30] with seven seals. And we asked the
[59:33] question, what is this book? It was the
[59:36] title deed to the earth. The very
[59:38] inheritance promised by God to his
[59:41] redeemed. The Bible said, "Blessed are
[59:44] the meek, for they shall inherit the
[59:46] earth." You see, the earth does not
[59:49] belong to the arrogant, the rebellious,
[59:52] or those who reject reject Christ's
[59:55] lordship, but it it belongs to those who
[59:58] humble themselves before God and will
[1:00:01] submit fully to his word. Now, this is
[1:00:04] the requirement to get the preeminence
[1:00:07] back in his people so that he can take
[1:00:10] us back to Eden again. So the Bible
[1:00:14] tells you in John James 4:10, humble
[1:00:17] yourself before the Lord and he will
[1:00:19] exalt you. So you see, submission though
[1:00:23] will require more than just a a humble
[1:00:26] attitude of a stooped shoulder and a
[1:00:29] bowed head, but it requires resisting
[1:00:32] the devil. Amen. It it requires standing
[1:00:36] firm in faith, knowing that when we
[1:00:39] resist him, he will flee. Amen. Now, so
[1:00:43] we know that that and we went over last
[1:00:47] Sunday about the loss of dominion and
[1:00:49] Adam's tragic ex exchange, but we know
[1:00:53] in our review that that from Genesis
[1:00:56] 1:26 that it shows that Adam was God's
[1:01:00] son. Thus, it was he was his
[1:01:03] representative on the earth, given
[1:01:05] dominion over all creation. But through
[1:01:09] disobedience, he sold himself along with
[1:01:12] his descendants into the bondage of
[1:01:15] Satan's dominion. Instead of remaining
[1:01:18] in obedience to God, he chose to follow
[1:01:21] his wife in deception. And in that
[1:01:24] moment, Satan asserted Adam's authority
[1:01:28] and became the prince of the power of
[1:01:31] the air. And so we we know then uh you
[1:01:35] know heaven was once upon the earth in
[1:01:38] the form of Eden and and and there was a
[1:01:41] channel between man and God. So it was a
[1:01:45] place where heaven flowed freely to the
[1:01:48] earth. A paradise sustained by the
[1:01:52] unbroken presence of God. the atmosphere
[1:01:55] of heaven descended through a divine
[1:01:58] corridor and filling the earth with life
[1:02:01] and peace and God's glory. But when Adam
[1:02:05] sinned, that channel became blocked. The
[1:02:08] prince of the power of the air set up
[1:02:10] all kinds of of barriers of sin and fear
[1:02:15] and doubt and unbelief that would cut
[1:02:17] off the flow of divine life to humanity.
[1:02:21] The earth that was once an extension of
[1:02:24] heaven was now subject to the curse. And
[1:02:28] Satan seized control, but not as a
[1:02:31] rightful owner. For he cannot own what
[1:02:35] God created, but as a squatter
[1:02:38] possessing through deception what Adam
[1:02:41] lost through disobedience.
[1:02:43] But God's plan of redemption was already
[1:02:47] in motion. Remember what was first. It
[1:02:50] wasn't the sinner. It was the savior.
[1:02:53] For the Bible said he was a lamb slain
[1:02:56] before the foundation of the world. God
[1:02:59] already had a plan. This was already in
[1:03:01] his mind. Amen. So the plan of
[1:03:03] redemption was already in motion. The
[1:03:06] title deed would not re would not remain
[1:03:10] out of the hands of his rightful owners,
[1:03:13] but the lamb would reclaim it. So now
[1:03:16] through Christ's victory at Calvary, the
[1:03:19] sealed book, the title of the earth
[1:03:21] would soon be claimed and open and
[1:03:24] Satan's dominion was broken and the
[1:03:27] inheritance of the saints was restored.
[1:03:30] As we have quoted already, the meek
[1:03:33] shall inherit the earth. Those who
[1:03:35] humble themselves will be exalted, and
[1:03:38] those that will resist the devil will
[1:03:41] see him flee. Amen. Now the corridor
[1:03:45] between heaven and earth is now being
[1:03:47] restored through Christ through the
[1:03:50] sending of the Holy Ghost that comes to
[1:03:52] dwell in man. The flow of divine life
[1:03:56] has already begun. And now the seals
[1:03:59] have been broken. The title deed have
[1:04:01] been has been reclaimed and placed in
[1:04:04] the hands of man. And now the kingdom of
[1:04:07] God will be fully reestablished upon the
[1:04:10] earth. Amen. What a day we're living in.
[1:04:14] Now, as I've quoted from the future
[1:04:16] home, all the sins that's in the heaven
[1:04:19] above, he is the prince of the power of
[1:04:21] the air. He keeps off or wards off the
[1:04:24] blessings from God. If there comes
[1:04:26] thunderbolts of lightning and strikes
[1:04:29] the earth and everything from the
[1:04:31] heavens, sheets of slashing rain,
[1:04:33] typhoon, storms, everything comes from
[1:04:36] above, which Satan is the prince of the
[1:04:38] power of the air. Amen. So now here's
[1:04:41] Satan. Now, of course, he's still here
[1:04:44] upon the earth. He's still the squatter.
[1:04:47] He's still the one trying to possess
[1:04:51] what Christ has redeemed. But I want to
[1:04:53] remind you that in the beginning, man
[1:04:56] was created to rule to have dominion
[1:05:00] over the earth. But when Adam sinned, he
[1:05:03] forfeited his authority, handed over his
[1:05:06] God-given title deed to Satan, but Satan
[1:05:10] could not take it. His dirty hands could
[1:05:13] not take it. So therefore, his his he
[1:05:15] cannot legally own it, but he has
[1:05:19] possessed it for these past 6,000 years.
[1:05:22] He's been clinging to it with all his
[1:05:24] might. He's been refusing to relinquish
[1:05:27] what was never rightfully his. Humanity
[1:05:31] was lost. The earth was cursed and
[1:05:35] dominion stripped from man. But God had
[1:05:39] a plan. I want you to remember this.
[1:05:42] God's got a plan for your life this
[1:05:44] morning. He has not forgotten his
[1:05:46] people. He has not forgotten you. God
[1:05:49] has a plan for each and every one of us.
[1:05:52] And he has a plan of redemption. And God
[1:05:55] would not allow Satan to have the title
[1:05:58] deed. He would not forsake the earth or
[1:06:01] abandon his creation. But in the in the
[1:06:04] fullness of time, God stepped into human
[1:06:07] flesh, bypassing the fallen nature of
[1:06:11] man, born of a virgin without sin.
[1:06:16] Oh, glorious be to God. He comes as a
[1:06:20] second Adam to fight Satan, not as God,
[1:06:24] but as a man. And at Calvary, he strikes
[1:06:28] his final blow. Through the cross, Jesus
[1:06:32] shattered the strongholds of darkness.
[1:06:35] Colossians 2:15 says, "Having spoiled
[1:06:39] principalities and powers, he made a
[1:06:41] show of them openly, triumphant over
[1:06:44] them in it." You see, he stripped all
[1:06:48] the spiritual tyrants in the universe of
[1:06:51] their sham authority at the cross and
[1:06:54] march them naked through the street. I
[1:06:57] want you to understand like a mighty
[1:06:59] conqueror, he stripped Satan of every
[1:07:03] power that he had, disarming every power
[1:07:06] and principality and stripping them of
[1:07:09] their armor, leaving them exposed and
[1:07:11] powerless. And the forces that once
[1:07:14] enslaved mankind were now brought to
[1:07:17] nothing.
[1:07:19] But he didn't stop there. Through his
[1:07:22] ascension, Jesus tore the bearers of
[1:07:25] Satan's dominion and he broke open
[1:07:28] heaven's atmosphere and he restored
[1:07:30] access to God's presence. He opened up a
[1:07:35] stairway between God and man where that
[1:07:39] man who was once forbidden to come in
[1:07:41] his presence because of sin now could
[1:07:44] approach the throne boldly.
[1:07:49] Amen.
[1:07:50] Before Christ's victory, sin had created
[1:07:54] an impenetrable blockade between man and
[1:07:58] God. But oh, that changed that day on
[1:08:01] Calvary.
[1:08:02] There at that day on Calvary, the veil
[1:08:06] of the temple was torn into.
[1:08:09] What was that showing? The way into the
[1:08:11] holiness, holiest of all was now open
[1:08:15] for everybody.
[1:08:16] And Jesus became the only way to God.
[1:08:20] The only approach to spirit God the
[1:08:23] father was through Jesus Christ. He is
[1:08:27] the only one that we can approach by
[1:08:29] this morning. And no longer no longer
[1:08:32] was God distance, unapproachable,
[1:08:35] dwelling in a light where no one could
[1:08:37] come. But but through Jesus, the the
[1:08:40] divine connection was now restored.
[1:08:44] How wonderful this is. Amen. It rejoices
[1:08:48] my heart when I think about it as my
[1:08:50] mind goes back as we spoke last Sunday
[1:08:53] of Nathaniel first encountered Jesus and
[1:08:56] the revelation struck him. Throw out the
[1:08:59] son of God. Amen. Thou art the king of
[1:09:01] Israel. And Jesus responded with his
[1:09:04] promise here. Hereafter you will see the
[1:09:07] heavens open and the angels of God
[1:09:09] ascending and descending upon the son of
[1:09:12] man. You see, he was revealing himself
[1:09:16] as the divine connection. The stairway
[1:09:20] between heaven and earth had been
[1:09:22] restored. The blessings of God could now
[1:09:26] descend upon man once more. how through
[1:09:30] the man Christ Jesus. Amen. Only and on
[1:09:34] the day of Pentecost there was 120 of
[1:09:37] them recognize him not just as a
[1:09:39] prophet. Amen. But as the exalted son of
[1:09:42] God, the king. Amen. Peter would unlock
[1:09:46] the door to the kingdom in Acts 2:38
[1:09:48] calling every one of them repent and be
[1:09:51] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:09:54] receive the Holy Ghost. And the moment
[1:09:57] they received him as Lord and was
[1:10:00] submissive to his word, heaven opened
[1:10:03] and the Holy Ghost descended upon man.
[1:10:06] Hallelujah. Jesus did everything that he
[1:10:09] did as a man. Stepping into humanity and
[1:10:13] stepping into humanity's battles to win
[1:10:16] back all that Adam lost. He triumphed
[1:10:20] over Satan. He stripped him of his
[1:10:22] weapons. He reclaimed dominion for the
[1:10:25] sons of God. Let me tell you this
[1:10:28] morning, Satan is a defeated squatter.
[1:10:33] Amen.
[1:10:36] He has been legally stripped of his
[1:10:38] power.
[1:10:40] Oh, he still lingers. He still operates
[1:10:43] by deception, but he's a squatter
[1:10:46] bluffing believers into thinking they
[1:10:48] have no rights in Christ.
[1:10:51] think of that. But we must recognize our
[1:10:55] position.
[1:10:57] We are not bound. We are not slaves to
[1:11:00] sin. We are not to be slaves to sickness
[1:11:04] or to fear. We are sons and daughters of
[1:11:07] the king. We are rightful heirs of the
[1:11:09] promise. I tell you, if ever there was a
[1:11:12] time, it's time to rise in faith. It's
[1:11:15] time to cast the squatter out. It's time
[1:11:18] to reclaim what Jesus has restored. He
[1:11:21] opened up the way. The stairway is set
[1:11:24] and through him the connection between
[1:11:27] heaven and earth is fully restored.
[1:11:31] Amen. Amen. You know, we often heard of
[1:11:34] the story of of of Arnold von Winkler.
[1:11:37] Get me this in a
[1:11:39] glass. We've all often heard the story
[1:11:41] of Arnold von Winkler. He was um it's a
[1:11:46] story of a a man a hero in Switzerland
[1:11:50] where there was a time when the Swiss
[1:11:53] people of simple and free had built
[1:11:56] their homes in the mountains. They were
[1:11:58] praying working people and and and they
[1:12:02] were raising their families in peace.
[1:12:05] But one day that peace was shattered. A
[1:12:08] great invading army came marching in.
[1:12:12] seemingly it was unstoppable. They
[1:12:14] burned homes and slaughtered children
[1:12:16] and rabbis women in the street and they
[1:12:19] tore apart the the very fabric of Swiss
[1:12:23] life with no trained army, no weapons of
[1:12:26] war. The the Swiss gathered at the foot
[1:12:29] of the mountains, men who had never
[1:12:30] fought a battle, armed themselves with
[1:12:32] just plow shares and pruning hooks and
[1:12:35] sticks and stones. And they faced a
[1:12:38] great host uh and force of of trained
[1:12:42] soldiers that were clad in armor that
[1:12:45] was marching in perfect unison. They
[1:12:48] were seemingly unstoppable. Their long
[1:12:51] spears formed an imp impregnable wall
[1:12:54] and glinted in the sun as they pressed
[1:12:57] forward and and the Swiss were
[1:12:59] outnumbered. They were outned. They were
[1:13:02] backed in the corner. Defeat loomed over
[1:13:04] them like a shadow. Their beloved
[1:13:06] beloved country was cheetahed on on the
[1:13:09] brink of destruction. Something anything
[1:13:12] had to be done. And from among them
[1:13:15] stood a young man that stepped forth.
[1:13:18] His name was Arnold von Winkler. And
[1:13:20] with fire in his eyes, he said, "This
[1:13:22] day, I will give my life for my
[1:13:25] country." And they looked at him
[1:13:27] stunned. What are you going to do? He
[1:13:30] said, "I'll tell you what. Across those
[1:13:32] mountains there, there is a small white
[1:13:34] home. There's a loving wife. There's
[1:13:37] three little children, but they'll never
[1:13:39] see me again. For today, I will die for
[1:13:42] Switzerland." The men stood there with
[1:13:44] their hearts pounding, wondering, "What
[1:13:46] was he going to do? What will you do,
[1:13:48] Arnold Van Winkler? And he turned with
[1:13:50] his voice rising and and he says, I'll
[1:13:53] tell you what you do. You follow me and
[1:13:56] you fight with all you have and fight
[1:13:58] with all you might. And then in a single
[1:14:01] moment there, he threw down his weapon.
[1:14:03] He raised his hands toward the heavens.
[1:14:05] He let out a cry that shook the
[1:14:07] battlefields, "Make way for liberty.
[1:14:10] Make way for liberty." And he ran right
[1:14:12] into the heart of the enemy. He searched
[1:14:15] for the thickest line of spears and
[1:14:17] threw himself into them and gathered
[1:14:20] them in his arms and pulling them to his
[1:14:22] chest. Hundreds of of of sharps points
[1:14:26] pierced his body and he collapsed
[1:14:28] bringing those deadly weapons with him.
[1:14:30] But in that moment, something happened.
[1:14:34] The Swiss shoulders soldiers seeing
[1:14:36] their sacrifice and felt a fire ignite
[1:14:39] within them and know they had nothing
[1:14:41] but their crude tool tools and they rush
[1:14:44] very fast and furious forward breaking
[1:14:48] through the stunned enemy's ranks. and
[1:14:51] breaking through. They they fought not
[1:14:54] just with weapons but with a spirit of a
[1:14:57] free people and they drove the invaders
[1:15:00] from their land. That day Switzerland
[1:15:04] was was saved. That day forward peace
[1:15:07] reigned. And if you would hear over in
[1:15:10] Switzerland there there is even statues
[1:15:13] and and displays of his heroism as they
[1:15:17] remember their hero. But let me tell you
[1:15:20] that was very little to what our Jesus
[1:15:22] did. The human race was backed in a
[1:15:25] corner. The sons of Adam was under the
[1:15:28] bondage of death and sickness that had
[1:15:31] surrounded them. The law and the
[1:15:33] prophets had failed them. And everything
[1:15:36] seemed to be hopeless. The law had
[1:15:39] failed to bring peace. It told them what
[1:15:42] was right, but it and what was wrong,
[1:15:44] but it gave them no power to live it.
[1:15:48] The prophets had fought h, you know, to
[1:15:50] to to bring forth truth, but they they
[1:15:54] failed to bring forth the forgiveness of
[1:15:57] sin. They could only bring forth
[1:16:00] condemnation. You see, the battle is
[1:16:02] going against mankind. Satan was
[1:16:05] winning. It had been 500 years since the
[1:16:09] prophet Malachi had last spoken God's
[1:16:13] word. The last time that they had heard
[1:16:16] the voice of God when God's word had it
[1:16:18] broke through the quarters of heaven and
[1:16:21] and all man had left was just a skeleton
[1:16:25] of religious forms.
[1:16:27] Mankind was in disarray. They were
[1:16:30] routed by confusion. Diseases and sin
[1:16:33] had forced them into a place there was
[1:16:35] no hope left. They had rejected God's
[1:16:38] guidance. They were in a mess. And
[1:16:41] Adam's race stood quivering and shaking
[1:16:44] and seemed like nothing could be done.
[1:16:47] For hell was opening up his bosom to
[1:16:50] swallow them. But in glory, there was
[1:16:52] somebody stepped up forth. Amen. It's
[1:16:55] that lamb we're talking about. It's that
[1:16:58] lamb that stepped forth. Amen. Where God
[1:17:00] took on humanity. Amen. And said, "I'll
[1:17:04] go. I'll go. What will you do?" Say the
[1:17:06] angels. Where you watch? I'll become one
[1:17:09] of them. I'll go down and take on human
[1:17:12] battles. I'll roll myself in flesh like
[1:17:15] them. Amen. And he looked to where man's
[1:17:18] greatest fears lay. Where the thickness
[1:17:21] of darkness lay, where that monster
[1:17:24] called death, where man feared the most.
[1:17:28] And he conquered. Amen. He conquered it.
[1:17:31] Amen. He not only conquered it, but he
[1:17:33] ascended on high.
[1:17:35] And he never sit down just another
[1:17:38] theological faith and a bunch of man's
[1:17:41] teaching. But no sir, he sent back the
[1:17:44] Holy Ghost. Amen. He said, "Take this
[1:17:47] power. Take this Holy Ghost and fight
[1:17:50] with everything you have." Amen. Take
[1:17:53] this and follow me in the battle. As the
[1:17:56] father has sent me, so send you. How did
[1:17:59] the father send him? The father that
[1:18:01] sent him went in him.
[1:18:04] Hallelujah.
[1:18:05] Come on. Christ come to earth not only
[1:18:08] to redeem
[1:18:09] mankind but to fight and to overcome the
[1:18:13] battles.
[1:18:15] Humanity just could not win on their
[1:18:18] own.
[1:18:20] So he took on flesh
[1:18:24] to face your temptations,
[1:18:28] your sins. He knew no sins, but he would
[1:18:33] take on your sins
[1:18:35] and he would face temptation, sin,
[1:18:39] death, and Satan himself all on our
[1:18:43] behalf.
[1:18:47] Think of that for a moment.
[1:18:52] Now, let's just look at some key
[1:18:55] scriptures to show how Jesus came to
[1:18:58] fight and win our battles. In Hebrews
[1:19:01] chapter
[1:19:02] 2:14 says, "For as much then as the
[1:19:05] children are partakers of flesh and
[1:19:07] blood. He himself likewise took on the
[1:19:10] same part of the same that through death
[1:19:13] he might destroy him that had the power
[1:19:15] of death that is the devil and deliver
[1:19:18] them who through the fear of death were
[1:19:21] all their lifetime subject to bondage.
[1:19:24] So Jesus took on human flesh.
[1:19:29] notice. So he could confront Satan on
[1:19:33] equal ground and defeat him through his
[1:19:37] death and his resurrection. The Bible
[1:19:40] said in and showed us in Matthew 4 how
[1:19:44] of the temptation of Jesus in the
[1:19:46] wilderness that he fought temptation and
[1:19:49] he overcame it for us. Amen. Amen. Now
[1:19:53] he is God could not be tempted. So he
[1:19:58] become a man to face your temptations.
[1:20:02] And Hebrews 4:15 says, "For we have not
[1:20:04] a high priest which cannot be touched
[1:20:06] with the feelings of our firmity, but
[1:20:08] was in all points tempted like we are
[1:20:12] yet without sin."
[1:20:16] So Jesus faced every temptation we do.
[1:20:19] But where Adam and all of humanity and
[1:20:21] the law and the prophets failed, Jesus
[1:20:24] Christ prevailed.
[1:20:26] Amen. and he fought against the works of
[1:20:28] the devil. The Bible said in 1 John 3:8,
[1:20:31] "For this purpose was the son of God
[1:20:33] manifested, that he might destroy the
[1:20:36] works of the devil." Let me tell you,
[1:20:38] anytime he's manifested, anytime he
[1:20:41] reveals himself, it's always for that
[1:20:44] reason, to destroy the works of the
[1:20:47] devil.
[1:20:48] Hallelujah.
[1:20:50] You see, Jesus came to dismantle Satan's
[1:20:54] kingdom.
[1:20:55] to break the chains of sin, to break the
[1:20:58] chains of sickness and death that held
[1:21:01] mankind captive. He won the battle at
[1:21:04] the cross as we have already quoted. He
[1:21:07] spoiled principalities, made his show of
[1:21:09] them openly, triumphant over them in it.
[1:21:13] That through his death, his burial, his
[1:21:16] resurrection, Jesus stripped Satan of
[1:21:19] his thlen authority and marched him in
[1:21:22] open defeat. Hallelujah. In his
[1:21:25] triumphant, in his triumphant
[1:21:28] resurrection, when he rose, he was
[1:21:30] marching. He marched death right through
[1:21:33] the street. I've overcome it. He marched
[1:21:36] sickness, disease, and affliction and
[1:21:40] fear and temptation. He marked them all
[1:21:44] down the street and
[1:21:46] show defeated.
[1:21:50] Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:52] Hallelujah. He fought death, hell, and
[1:21:56] the grave and conquered them.
[1:21:58] Hallelujah. As he says in Revelation
[1:22:00] 1:18, "I am he that liveth and was dead.
[1:22:06] But behold, look, I am alive forever
[1:22:09] more." Amen. And I have the keys of hell
[1:22:13] and of death. Amen. That's right. The
[1:22:16] greatest battle ever ever fought, the
[1:22:19] greatest battle fought was at the grave
[1:22:22] when he went to the lowest regions of
[1:22:25] the earth. The Bible said that he that
[1:22:28] ascended descended also to the lowest
[1:22:31] regions
[1:22:32] down into hell itself.
[1:22:35] But let me tell you about it. Jesus
[1:22:37] emerged
[1:22:39] victorious. And now you don't have to go
[1:22:42] to hell.
[1:22:44] Because he went there for you.
[1:22:48] Hallelujah. You know the devil was the
[1:22:51] devil and his angels have no power over
[1:22:54] you. Listen, let me tell you, hell was
[1:22:57] not created for you. Hell was created
[1:23:00] for the devil and his angels. It's not
[1:23:02] created for sons of God. Hallelujah. But
[1:23:06] I tell you what, because you because of
[1:23:08] sin, the way you were born the first
[1:23:10] time, you had to have redemption. And he
[1:23:14] went to hell in your place, taken your
[1:23:17] punishment, and rose up again
[1:23:20] triumphant.
[1:23:21] [Applause]
[1:23:24] And he took the keys of death and of
[1:23:27] hell and broke their power over mankind.
[1:23:32] Think of that.
[1:23:34] What a glorious savior we have this
[1:23:36] morning. He fought to restore the
[1:23:38] connection between God and man.
[1:23:41] Jesus said in John 14 and6, "I am the
[1:23:45] way, the truth, and the life, and no one
[1:23:49] can come to the father but by me." He is
[1:23:53] man's only approach to God.
[1:23:57] Is when God became a man, the barrier
[1:24:00] between God and man was shattered.
[1:24:03] when Christ made a way back for us into
[1:24:06] the presence of the father. I want you
[1:24:09] to see this. Remember it's of vital
[1:24:12] importance to understand that he did not
[1:24:15] take the book for man as God. God had
[1:24:18] the book. He became a man to take it
[1:24:22] back for man. But let me tell you
[1:24:25] friends, he's not through fighting.
[1:24:28] He still fights for us now. The Bible
[1:24:32] says in Romans 8:34, "Who is he that
[1:24:34] condemnth? It is Christ that died, yay,
[1:24:38] that is risen again, that is even at the
[1:24:40] right hand of God who also maketh
[1:24:43] intercession for us." Amen. Amen. As he
[1:24:46] said in the ancient book of Exodus, and
[1:24:49] that Exodus, the Lord shall fight for
[1:24:51] you, and you shall hold your peace.
[1:24:55] Amen. Even today, Jesus is fighting for
[1:24:58] his people. He stands as our
[1:25:01] intercessor,
[1:25:03] ensuring victory in every battle.
[1:25:08] Oh, hallelujah. Let me just tell you
[1:25:10] friends, back in in Moses day in that
[1:25:12] Exodus when the when they when the
[1:25:15] Amorites came against Israel, he sat
[1:25:18] down upon a rock and his hands was
[1:25:20] lifted up toward the heavens. as his
[1:25:23] hands would get tired and go down.
[1:25:26] Israel would look and see, you know,
[1:25:28] that Moses' hands come down and the
[1:25:30] battle would go against him. And
[1:25:32] finally, it was Joshua and and I believe
[1:25:35] it was her that reached up and took a
[1:25:38] side on each side and lifted up the arms
[1:25:41] of Moses
[1:25:43] so that they couldn't fall down.
[1:25:46] Amen. But when Jesus went to the cross,
[1:25:49] it was nailed to the cross so it
[1:25:52] couldn't fall down. And every one of you
[1:25:54] in your battle could look away to Jesus
[1:25:58] and you can see him as one triumph.
[1:26:02] Hallelujah. And you can win the battle
[1:26:04] over your sickness, your problem, your
[1:26:07] situation, your besetting sin.
[1:26:14] Hallelujah. But
[1:26:18] there's going to be a final victory
[1:26:21] lays in the
[1:26:22] future. Romans n Revelation 19 shows I
[1:26:27] saw heaven open. And behold, a white
[1:26:30] horse, and he that sat on him is called
[1:26:32] faithful and true, and in righteousness
[1:26:35] does he judge and make war. And he had
[1:26:37] on his vest and on his thigh a name
[1:26:40] written, King of Kings and Lord of
[1:26:44] Lords. Amen. The battle's not over. You
[1:26:48] see, Jesus won the victory at the cross,
[1:26:51] but soon he will come as a conquering
[1:26:54] king to establish his eternal kingdom.
[1:26:59] And every battle we face, I want you to
[1:27:02] know Christ has already fought it and
[1:27:05] won it. Through him, we walk in victory.
[1:27:10] Amen. So when Satan battles and he
[1:27:12] throws his atmosphere of doubt and
[1:27:15] depression and sickness and sorrow, I
[1:27:19] want to tell you, do what the Bible
[1:27:20] said. Cast down his imagination.
[1:27:23] Hurl him down and use the word to do it.
[1:27:27] For no weapon formed against you can
[1:27:29] prosper. Amen. He was wounded for my
[1:27:33] transgressions. He was bruised for my
[1:27:35] iniquity. and by his stripes I am
[1:27:39] healed, delivered, set free, victorious.
[1:27:46] I'll tell you what, this morning I want
[1:27:48] you to cast down those fears. I want you
[1:27:51] to dash them into pieces. Those
[1:27:53] complexes, the unbelief, the
[1:27:56] doubts. And while you're at it, I want
[1:27:59] you to destroy those besetting sins.
[1:28:03] You got to pick up the powerful weapon
[1:28:05] of the Holy Ghost. Oh yeah. That
[1:28:08] transforms our inner being and makes us
[1:28:10] a new creature in Christ
[1:28:13] and fight our way through the powers of
[1:28:15] darkness of this sinful world and and
[1:28:18] break every stronghold. Oh yeah. Every
[1:28:20] stronghold of doubt or unbelief and do
[1:28:24] it by the righteousness and the
[1:28:26] resurrection power of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:29] Amen. I tell you what, you know, we we
[1:28:33] ourselves need a revival.
[1:28:36] Amen. Not by adding more complacent
[1:28:39] church members who who are only here to
[1:28:41] warm up you. Oh, God forbid we got
[1:28:44] enough of them. But what we need is a
[1:28:46] refilling of the Holy Ghost, reviving
[1:28:49] the lukewarm and the complacent
[1:28:51] believers. Amen. We have to rise up and
[1:28:54] fight against our enemy and heal the
[1:28:56] sick and cast out devils. And as freely
[1:28:59] as we receive, freely give it.
[1:29:03] Amen. And bring back to God's people
[1:29:06] that liberty that we're to have in
[1:29:08] Christ.
[1:29:10] Let the signs follow the believers. We
[1:29:13] already have the strongest weapon. We
[1:29:16] have the Holy Ghost himself.
[1:29:18] We're not fighting this battle alone.
[1:29:20] Amen. Amen. You don't need more power.
[1:29:23] You just need to use that power. You got
[1:29:26] to fight for what you have. if you're
[1:29:28] going to possess it. Amen. Yeah. The
[1:29:30] devil was disarmed at Calvary, but
[1:29:32] you're going to have to force him off.
[1:29:35] He's a squatter. He'll squat right there
[1:29:37] on your promises and try to keep you
[1:29:40] from possessing them.
[1:29:43] I use a historical figure a while ago,
[1:29:45] but let me use a biblical figure that
[1:29:47] was often used of Shamgar. You know,
[1:29:50] he's he's almost unknown except for a
[1:29:52] small verse or two in the Bible.
[1:29:56] And just in the book of Judges, you find
[1:29:58] two verses that mentions his name. It
[1:30:01] was a day a lot like our day where men
[1:30:06] do whatever's right in their own
[1:30:08] sight. And because of Aaron from God,
[1:30:12] the the Philistines
[1:30:14] invaded and they uh they had a great
[1:30:17] tricks up their sleeve, brother. They
[1:30:19] they didn't just come and take the land.
[1:30:21] No, they let them till their land, live
[1:30:23] there, let them plant their crops and
[1:30:26] till it and and
[1:30:28] and harvest it. And once it was
[1:30:30] harvested, they would come with bands of
[1:30:33] 600 or more and take possessions of
[1:30:36] those harvested crops.
[1:30:39] And Shamgar had raised a good crop. And
[1:30:43] the year before the Philistines had come
[1:30:45] and stolen it from him. And while at the
[1:30:48] barn that day after the harvest, while
[1:30:51] he was resting, he was just thinking of
[1:30:53] the hard toil, the planting, the
[1:30:56] tilling, the labor, you know, the
[1:30:59] gatherings, fighting off the the the
[1:31:03] animals that would want to eat his crop,
[1:31:06] pushing back the the
[1:31:09] grasshoppers, you know, plucking up the
[1:31:11] weeds. and he's looking at it and
[1:31:13] looking over at his wife and little
[1:31:16] children who had worked so hard and
[1:31:18] thinking, "Well, just hopefully we'll be
[1:31:21] able to eat this winter and not starve."
[1:31:24] And about that time, he hears the
[1:31:27] stomping of 600 fierce Philistines.
[1:31:31] Yeah. 600 of them. He was overpowered.
[1:31:35] He was only one man against 600. Oh my.
[1:31:39] Here they are again to take away our
[1:31:42] food. You know, we we will starve this
[1:31:44] winter. What can we do? What can I do
[1:31:46] against 600? I'll just have to let them
[1:31:49] take it. We'll starve again. You know,
[1:31:52] that's the way the devil will do. He'll
[1:31:55] let you build up a little something.
[1:31:57] Then come and knock the props out from
[1:31:59] under you. And the reason is cuz you let
[1:32:02] him do it.
[1:32:04] I'm telling you, he's a bluff. He has no
[1:32:07] legal rights. Amen. Amen. But if you got
[1:32:10] an experience of God, of the
[1:32:12] resurrection of Jesus Christ, let me
[1:32:14] remind you, he stripped Satan of every
[1:32:17] power that he has and took it away from
[1:32:20] him and robbed him, stripped him, and
[1:32:22] gave the power to the church. And he
[1:32:25] said, "Now you do the works that I did."
[1:32:28] Amen. That's right. He took the sword
[1:32:31] out of Satan's hand and he put it in
[1:32:34] your hand. Amen.
[1:32:37] Amen. Somebody ought to shout it about
[1:32:39] that. Amen. I don't know why your tongue
[1:32:42] is tied this morning, but break forth.
[1:32:45] Break out of those shackles. You're
[1:32:47] children of liberty this morning. Amen.
[1:32:50] Rejoice in the word of truth. Amen. Shar
[1:32:54] thought, if I was just only a soldier,
[1:32:57] you know, if I just had an army, I don't
[1:33:00] even have a sword. I don't even have a
[1:33:01] spear. I'm not trained to fight. I I I'm
[1:33:05] not a soldier. I'm just a farmer. And
[1:33:07] what could one man do against 600?
[1:33:11] Think about that.
[1:33:14] How many excuses do we make?
[1:33:17] When God made you, his seed of Abraham,
[1:33:21] possessors of the enemy's gates.
[1:33:24] And looking around, he saw his poor
[1:33:27] little wife holding her hands up to her
[1:33:30] face, crying. looked at his little
[1:33:32] children with drunk and pale faces. They
[1:33:36] were crying,
[1:33:38] facing sure salv starvation again. You
[1:33:42] know that's the way it is. You get a
[1:33:43] good meeting, every time you get one
[1:33:45] started, there'll be some old hypocrite,
[1:33:49] some Satan spy will come in and say,
[1:33:51] "Days of miracles are passed. You might
[1:33:53] as well stop this." Come on. Amen.
[1:33:56] That's the devil. Every time the church
[1:33:58] just going up good and and you somebody
[1:34:00] will slip in and say, "Ah, that's just
[1:34:02] all emotion. It's just enthusiasm. It's
[1:34:06] just worked up. It's just fanaticism."
[1:34:09] That's the way the devil does it. He's a
[1:34:10] robber.
[1:34:12] Amen. He's just an old Philistine coming
[1:34:14] back again. We chased him out before.
[1:34:17] Let's chase him out again. Come on. He
[1:34:20] don't belong in the house of God.
[1:34:23] Amen. That unbelief doesn't belong among
[1:34:25] us. Let somebody get a blessing and you
[1:34:28] just ah they're in the flesh. Let me
[1:34:30] tell you, you ought to get in the flesh
[1:34:32] like that one time. Well, when the
[1:34:34] spirit of God comes down upon you and
[1:34:37] you lose your humanity a while, lifted
[1:34:39] up in the heavenly where all things are
[1:34:42] possible.
[1:34:46] Samar looked and more he looked, there
[1:34:49] was something that rose up in him. Amen.
[1:34:54] You know how it is. The stadiums always
[1:34:56] have it as a motto for their teams
[1:34:58] saying it ain't the size of the dog. And
[1:35:00] the fight is the sight of the fight of
[1:35:02] the dog. Amen, brother. There was there
[1:35:05] was a fight rose up in Shamgar. I'm not
[1:35:08] taking this one more day. Amen. What
[1:35:11] about you today? How many Shamgars are
[1:35:14] in this building that said, "I'm not
[1:35:16] putting up with the devil. Not one more
[1:35:19] day. Not one more minute. One more and
[1:35:21] one more night.
[1:35:26] He didn't have a weapon, but he had an
[1:35:28] ox go. Amen. Something just a stick he
[1:35:32] prodded the ox with. And he struck the
[1:35:34] first one. And he struck another one.
[1:35:36] And he struck another one until he slew
[1:35:39] 600 of them. I tell you what, you do not
[1:35:42] need to stop fighting until every enemy
[1:35:44] you got is dead.
[1:35:50] Yeah. We must fight if we're going to
[1:35:52] reign.
[1:35:55] Hallelujah.
[1:35:58] Now, Jesus made a way for us to go into
[1:36:01] God's presence
[1:36:03] through the way, through the stairway.
[1:36:06] The ladder, Jacob's ladder, the Holy
[1:36:09] Ghost descended, and heaven came down to
[1:36:15] live in man.
[1:36:20] The king and his kingdom now was now
[1:36:23] within them.
[1:36:25] Eden had begun in the
[1:36:28] soul and you as a believer can bring
[1:36:33] heaven's atmosphere down with his
[1:36:36] blessings and his power right into your
[1:36:40] Eden that's been created by the Holy
[1:36:43] Ghost.
[1:36:45] Amen. Amen. Lord.
[1:36:52] So, Satan can threaten us.
[1:36:55] He can bluff us. He can try to
[1:36:57] intimidate us. But he cannot stop us.
[1:37:02] He cannot stop us from going boldly.
[1:37:06] Hallelujah. Boldly. That's right. in the
[1:37:09] presence of God to go before the throne
[1:37:11] of grace to find help and favor in our
[1:37:16] time of need.
[1:37:18] Satan has no legal rights.
[1:37:22] He might claim rights over you, but they
[1:37:25] are false claims.
[1:37:27] Jesus rendered them void and illegal at
[1:37:32] Calvary and nailed them to his cross.
[1:37:36] Amen.
[1:37:38] And our battle that continues today is
[1:37:42] to bring heaven's
[1:37:44] atmosphere, to bring heaven down for
[1:37:48] your situations and your circumstances.
[1:37:57] When we have sinners among us, and we we
[1:38:00] do,
[1:38:02] if you're lost in
[1:38:03] sin, we need heaven's atmosphere.
[1:38:08] Amen. I I I think of an altar call that
[1:38:11] brother Brandham gave, you know, where
[1:38:13] some had given their lives to Christ and
[1:38:14] and he prayed this prayer. And let me
[1:38:16] just share it with you. I know nothing
[1:38:18] else to do Lord but say this that you
[1:38:22] said no man can come to me except my
[1:38:24] father draws him first and all that the
[1:38:26] father has given me will come to him and
[1:38:28] from the back of these hands which I do
[1:38:31] believe was sincere that was lifted
[1:38:33] hands to you Lord Jesus I I pray then as
[1:38:36] your servant I give them to you as the
[1:38:38] tokens of this meeting here charging the
[1:38:43] devil not to touch them again they are
[1:38:46] God's property
[1:38:48] hands off Satan until they're fully
[1:38:51] established and know how to behave
[1:38:53] themsself and to resist the enemy. I
[1:38:56] charge the enemy through Jesus Christ to
[1:38:59] stay away from them. May the loving Holy
[1:39:02] Spirit take them, lead them to water
[1:39:05] baptism, to the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:07] Spirit, and sealing them into the
[1:39:09] kingdom of God until the coming and
[1:39:11] appearing of the visible body of the
[1:39:13] Lord Jesus to catch away his bride. They
[1:39:15] are yours, Father.
[1:39:18] Hallelujah. Amen. Presenting them as
[1:39:21] God's property,
[1:39:24] saying to Satan, "Take your hands off of
[1:39:26] them." Amen. Again, he says in the
[1:39:30] future home, "One time I was his his
[1:39:33] property, but not now." One time the
[1:39:36] little woman at the well was his
[1:39:38] property, but not now. See, he came to
[1:39:41] loose the grip of it. He loosed the grip
[1:39:43] of sin, of Satan, upon my life, upon
[1:39:46] your life, and now we're not his. How
[1:39:50] many times have you heard me say in
[1:39:52] prayer, "Take your hands off of God's
[1:39:55] property." You see, have faith to claim
[1:39:58] your own. That's your right. Take your
[1:40:01] hands off of her. Take your hands off of
[1:40:04] him. That's the duty of the church.
[1:40:08] Amen. to bind Satan's power
[1:40:13] to say, "Satan, take your hands off of
[1:40:17] God's property."
[1:40:21] Oh, well, our body belongs to Satan. No,
[1:40:23] he's just a squatter on it.
[1:40:29] Oh, no. Our body doesn't belong to
[1:40:31] Satan. It's been listen to me. Amen. You
[1:40:34] are not your own. You have been bought
[1:40:36] with a price.
[1:40:38] Therefore, glorify God in your body.
[1:40:40] Your body is the temple of the Holy
[1:40:42] Ghost.
[1:40:44] You do not belong to the devil. That's
[1:40:46] right. Your body does not belong to the
[1:40:48] devil. Amen. You ought to look at that
[1:40:51] spirit that's attacking your body and
[1:40:52] your health today and say, "Satan, get
[1:40:55] off of my back. I am not your property.
[1:40:58] I am the redeemed product of Jesus
[1:41:01] Christ. I belong to him."
[1:41:05] And if that devil tries to send you to a
[1:41:07] premature grave, tries to you
[1:41:09] up, I want you to read God's abstract
[1:41:12] title deed that says, "By his stripes,
[1:41:16] you were healed."
[1:41:20] And if he don't want to move, he don't
[1:41:23] believe you, and he don't respect what
[1:41:26] you say, I'll tell you, there is a Holy
[1:41:29] Ghost here that is the enforcer of the
[1:41:32] title deed. Amen. The law of God to kick
[1:41:36] him out. Amen. Call Jesus on the scene.
[1:41:40] Amen. Amen. Find out if something don't
[1:41:43] take place, the angels of God will take
[1:41:45] their position and the devil will have
[1:41:48] to get out. Amen. As you stand
[1:41:50] toe-to-toe with the devil and say, "I
[1:41:52] believe the word to be truth."
[1:41:57] Standing on the basis
[1:42:00] of Satan is stripped of his power.
[1:42:03] The only thing he can do is accuse.
[1:42:06] Brother Brandon would often in the
[1:42:08] divine healing mo movements declare over
[1:42:10] and over, Satan is a bluff. He's only
[1:42:14] lying to you. Let me just share a couple
[1:42:16] of these. These comes from from the
[1:42:19] divine healing movements of the 40s and
[1:42:21] 50s. Let me just share them to with you
[1:42:24] where he says, "You know what? What
[1:42:26] ought to happen to you here on the CS
[1:42:28] and stretchers this afternoon? just get
[1:42:31] a little mad at the devil.
[1:42:33] I want to ask you, when's the last time
[1:42:36] you got mad at the devil?
[1:42:38] I'd see a lot of people getting angry
[1:42:40] with God. Why are you letting this
[1:42:43] happen to me? God say to you, I paid for
[1:42:46] you, Calvary. Why ain't you taking it?
[1:42:50] Hallelujah. I not only I not only g, you
[1:42:52] know, gave you the promise. I equipped
[1:42:54] you with the Holy Ghost. Cast him out.
[1:42:58] Amen.
[1:43:02] get a little mad at the devil. Said,
[1:43:03] "You old lion, rascal, you're a liar.
[1:43:06] Christ made me free and I don't have to
[1:43:08] sit like this no more. Get out of here."
[1:43:11] Toad tow the line with him. He hasn't
[1:43:14] got a bit of authority. Jesus stripped
[1:43:16] him of every legal right he had when he
[1:43:18] died at Calvary. The whole question of
[1:43:20] salvation and healing was settled at
[1:43:22] Calvary.
[1:43:24] Let me tell you, healing is like
[1:43:26] salvation. is already paid for. It's
[1:43:29] already done. So, I get saved at the
[1:43:32] altar. No, you recognize your salvation
[1:43:35] at the altar. He already saved you at
[1:43:38] Calvary. You just recognize the price
[1:43:42] has been paid and you're free.
[1:43:45] Amen.
[1:43:47] The devil's the devil's weapons are are
[1:43:50] tactics that he has is
[1:43:52] deception, temptation, doubt, fear,
[1:43:57] pride, negativity. He uses these as
[1:44:00] tools to undermine your faith.
[1:44:04] Why does he want to undermine your
[1:44:06] faith? Because without faith, you cannot
[1:44:09] please God.
[1:44:11] And when you waver in faith, let not
[1:44:13] that man think he'll receive anything
[1:44:15] from the Lord.
[1:44:17] So your whole access to God is by faith
[1:44:20] in his name.
[1:44:22] So he says again, what can I what could
[1:44:26] I do? What can I say? I say to every one
[1:44:29] of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:31] Christ that every person in here was
[1:44:33] healed when Jesus died at Calvary. It's
[1:44:36] your possession. I ask you to raise your
[1:44:39] hand. who was was Christians. Your hands
[1:44:42] went up everywhere. You have a legal
[1:44:44] right then to everything Jesus Christ
[1:44:47] paid for. He died for his died his death
[1:44:50] at the cross. He gave his life that you
[1:44:53] might have the legal rights to every
[1:44:55] redemptive blessing that he died for.
[1:44:57] It's yours. You are just afraid. Amen.
[1:45:01] To possess it. You're afraid to claim
[1:45:05] it. Right.
[1:45:07] Oh, how many times I hear people say,
[1:45:10] "Well, I got a blessing in church
[1:45:11] Sunday." I'll tell you what's out
[1:45:13] Monday. The devil's going to attack.
[1:45:14] What are you worried about him for? It's
[1:45:17] time for you to attack back.
[1:45:20] Amen. Monday ought to be as good as
[1:45:22] Sunday for a child of God to take the
[1:45:24] word of God and defeat the devil. Amen.
[1:45:28] If he can be defeated on Sunday, he can
[1:45:30] be defeated on Monday, on Tuesday, on
[1:45:32] Wednesday, on Thursday, on Friday, on
[1:45:34] Saturday, and Sunday. Again,
[1:45:38] we're not weekend warriors. We're
[1:45:40] warriors every day.
[1:45:48] If you're a Christian, you have a right,
[1:45:49] a legal right, for everything Christ
[1:45:51] died for. It's your possession. You own
[1:45:55] it. It's yours.
[1:45:58] Like Abraham, he wasn't a trained
[1:46:00] soldier. His brother Lot got in trouble.
[1:46:02] His his
[1:46:03] nephew, but I tell you
[1:46:06] what, he disarmed his soldiers with
[1:46:08] whatever they had and 300 one of them
[1:46:10] after his brother. I am a possessor.
[1:46:15] Amen. He endured the fight. He obtained
[1:46:17] the
[1:46:18] promise. But Satan just don't let you
[1:46:20] take it easy.
[1:46:23] You You must have faith. You have to
[1:46:25] believe. You have to endure like he told
[1:46:28] Moses, "The land is yours, but it's full
[1:46:30] of
[1:46:32] Philistines. It's full of Amorites and
[1:46:34] Jebusites. I've judged them. You just go
[1:46:38] take it." Amen. You, you know, you drive
[1:46:40] them out. I've left something for you to
[1:46:43] do.
[1:46:45] God gives us a promised land of the
[1:46:47] word. Amen. And he wants you, Amen, to
[1:46:50] stand on that promise and claim it as
[1:46:52] yours and fight every demon spirit off
[1:46:55] of it. Amen. But Satan will stand right
[1:46:58] along the pathway, the highway to heaven
[1:47:01] and try to block your path to the God's
[1:47:04] presence and condemn you while doing so.
[1:47:06] Remember, he has no weapon, but he is
[1:47:09] the accuser of the brethren.
[1:47:12] He'll even accuse God. Yeah, that
[1:47:15] sucker. He's a bold one.
[1:47:18] You know, he comes with deception and
[1:47:20] lies.
[1:47:21] The devil presented is presented as a
[1:47:25] master of deception. He used halftruths
[1:47:27] and outright lies to manipulate, mislead
[1:47:30] people. He did this from the Garden of
[1:47:32] Eden onward.
[1:47:35] Temptation. The devil uses temptation in
[1:47:37] many forms to entice people to sin and
[1:47:40] pursue pleasure or gain to pull you off
[1:47:43] the
[1:47:43] path. He'll use fear and its companion
[1:47:48] worry.
[1:47:49] All right? Fear of
[1:47:51] failure, fear of
[1:47:53] rejection, fear of the unknown. Those
[1:47:56] are powerful weapons and the devil uses
[1:47:59] them to paralyze paralyze people and
[1:48:02] prevent them from pursuing uh their
[1:48:05] goals and walking in faith.
[1:48:08] Fear is one of the most controlling
[1:48:11] emotions
[1:48:12] that a person can experience.
[1:48:16] The stock market goes up and down every
[1:48:19] day and it'll crash on account of fear.
[1:48:23] What a little word of fear.
[1:48:26] That's right. Will cast it all down.
[1:48:29] People lose thousands of dollars in a
[1:48:31] day. Fear is the product of unbelief.
[1:48:35] Amen. We sin when we disbelieve.
[1:48:39] Satan knows sin is not welcome in God's
[1:48:43] presence.
[1:48:44] Fear is a spirit. Ah, it's a ugly,
[1:48:50] forboding, haunting spirit. That's
[1:48:52] right. Yes, sir.
[1:48:55] fear.
[1:48:57] Let me tell you something. If you got
[1:48:58] fear this morning, that God didn't give
[1:49:00] it to you. That's right. The Bible said
[1:49:03] he did not give you the spirit of fear.
[1:49:06] But the spirit of love and of a sound,
[1:49:08] that means a disciplined mind. That's a
[1:49:11] mind to believe God's word. That's the
[1:49:13] mind of Christ.
[1:49:16] But it's one of the most controlling
[1:49:18] spirits that there is. And and the devil
[1:49:20] uses our emotions to his advantage,
[1:49:23] bringing fear into our
[1:49:26] lives. We fear all sorts of things,
[1:49:29] right?
[1:49:30] You know, we fear circumstances. We fear
[1:49:33] other people.
[1:49:35] We fear the future. We fear things we
[1:49:39] can't even control. That's right. Fear
[1:49:42] has torment. And God doesn't want you to
[1:49:45] live in your life in fear.
[1:49:47] but rather in the confidence that he's
[1:49:50] with us and the love that comes for our
[1:49:53] relationship with him. And worry, I want
[1:49:56] to ask you, when is worry ever, ever
[1:49:59] delivered you?
[1:50:03] But faith will.
[1:50:07] Come on. Faith will. That's right. What
[1:50:09] about the weapons that the that the
[1:50:11] devil will use against you, which are
[1:50:13] words or thoughts?
[1:50:15] You know his his attributes of pride and
[1:50:19] selfishness.
[1:50:21] Pride is a major flaw that leads to
[1:50:24] separation from God is a focus on
[1:50:26] oneself.
[1:50:28] I've often said about suicide. It's when
[1:50:30] you're when when all your thoughts turns
[1:50:32] inwards. It's all about me and my
[1:50:35] troubles and you you forget all the hurt
[1:50:37] and the harm that you're going to bring
[1:50:38] everywhere else. And you see yourself
[1:50:41] only in a very narrow position and
[1:50:43] places and it's selfishness.
[1:50:46] Selfishness leads individuals to
[1:50:49] disregard the needs of others.
[1:50:52] Amen. To focus only on their own
[1:50:55] desires. Then there's
[1:50:57] discouragement. Discouragement. The
[1:50:59] devil will use discouragement to make
[1:51:01] people feel overwhelmed and defeated,
[1:51:05] unable to persevere in their faith. But
[1:51:10] you know, we must be perseverant,
[1:51:12] persistent.
[1:51:14] Jesus taught his disciples even to pray
[1:51:17] and not to fade. In other words, don't
[1:51:19] give up.
[1:51:22] Amen. when you're approaching me, when
[1:51:23] you're knocking on the door, when you're
[1:51:25] when you're when you're coming into my
[1:51:27] presence, don't give up.
[1:51:31] The devil hinders with fear and and
[1:51:33] unbelief and all these other things, but
[1:51:36] don't give up.
[1:51:39] Keep pressing on. Satan will use words
[1:51:43] that he uses to plant seeds of doubt and
[1:51:46] negativity. Right. He'll use seduction,
[1:51:50] worldly allurements to to seduce people
[1:51:54] into life of sin.
[1:51:58] And through this disobedience, it keeps
[1:52:00] them from going up the ladder into God's
[1:52:03] presence. He uses channels of his own of
[1:52:07] drugs, alcohol, tobacco, vaping, gaming
[1:52:11] devices, television, movies, porn,
[1:52:15] elicit sex. And these are all channels
[1:52:18] through which Satan brings hell into a
[1:52:22] life.
[1:52:27] That's true.
[1:52:30] Other weapons that Satan uses is
[1:52:33] pain caused by those thorns in the
[1:52:36] flesh.
[1:52:38] The enemy is not really after your
[1:52:41] health.
[1:52:42] He not really after your finances.
[1:52:45] He's not really after your happiness.
[1:52:48] The devil's after your faith.
[1:52:54] Amen. Come on. Faith is your weapon. The
[1:52:57] hand of faith holds the word of God.
[1:52:59] Amen. Amen. This power and lying. Hey, I
[1:53:03] tell you, he will devour faith because
[1:53:04] he knows that faith is the very force
[1:53:07] that connects you to the power of God.
[1:53:10] He knows if he can just rob you of your
[1:53:12] faith that he can rob you of your
[1:53:14] victory. Amen.
[1:53:17] And let me tell you what, one of his
[1:53:20] greatest weapons he's got against
[1:53:23] mankind is suffering.
[1:53:29] Yeah. Pain.
[1:53:32] Pain makes you question. All right.
[1:53:36] Trials make us weary. Oh yeah. Loss
[1:53:39] makes us wonder, is God really there?
[1:53:43] Oh yeah. You know,
[1:53:46] the voice of Satan coming in and the
[1:53:48] fire of affliction, he'll whisper,
[1:53:51] "Where is your God now?"
[1:53:54] If he loved you, would he really allow
[1:53:57] this to happen to
[1:53:58] you? Maybe he isn't good as you thought
[1:54:01] he was.
[1:54:03] And in those moments, many will falter
[1:54:05] and many will turn their anger toward
[1:54:07] God instead of turning their faith
[1:54:09] toward him. And some will many many will
[1:54:12] walk away and some will do it for a
[1:54:14] season and some forever.
[1:54:18] But listen to me. I want to tell you
[1:54:21] this morning that hard
[1:54:23] times do not destroy your faith. They
[1:54:26] don't have to. The storms of life are
[1:54:29] not sent to shipwreck you.
[1:54:32] They are sent to strengthen you. Amen.
[1:54:35] Amen. The Bible doesn't sugarcoat this
[1:54:38] reality of of the trials that you face.
[1:54:40] It warns us in this world you will have
[1:54:44] tribulation.
[1:54:46] Amen. But he adds, but be of good cheer.
[1:54:49] I have overcome the world.
[1:54:51] Says through many tribulations we must
[1:54:54] enter into the kingdom of God. Acts 14
[1:54:57] tells us, "And the Bible tells you God
[1:55:00] will make it all work for your good,
[1:55:03] that all things will work for the good
[1:55:06] of them that love God,
[1:55:09] who are called according to his
[1:55:10] purpose."
[1:55:12] It tells us that suffering is only
[1:55:15] temporary,
[1:55:17] that these light afflictions are for
[1:55:19] just a moment. But it tells you also
[1:55:23] that the reward is beyond imagination.
[1:55:27] That the suffering of this present time
[1:55:30] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:55:32] glory that shall be revealed in us.
[1:55:36] The the fire is fierce, but it's forging
[1:55:39] you. Come on. It's tempering your metal.
[1:55:44] Amen. Where you are soft, it's making
[1:55:46] you strong. The battle is brutal, but
[1:55:49] it's building you. The suffering is
[1:55:52] real, but so is the reward.
[1:55:55] And the enemy wants to use your pain to
[1:55:57] destroy you, but God will use it to
[1:56:00] refine you.
[1:56:01] [Applause]
[1:56:03] I want to tell you this morning,
[1:56:04] wherever you are in life right now, hold
[1:56:07] fast. Stand sure, endure knowing that
[1:56:10] the moment you step into eternity, every
[1:56:14] trial, every fear, every tear, every
[1:56:18] wound will be swallowed up in victory.
[1:56:21] Death itself will be swallowed up in
[1:56:24] victory. And you will be crowned in
[1:56:26] righteousness standing in the presence
[1:56:29] of the one who walked with you through
[1:56:31] it all.
[1:56:33] Hallelujah. G. Don't let the lion steal
[1:56:37] your faith. Amen.
[1:56:42] Let the fire strengthen it.
[1:56:48] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. The
[1:56:49] channel. Thank you, Lord. The channel is
[1:56:52] open. Amen.
[1:56:54] The channel between God and man is open.
[1:56:58] Jesus defeated the devil completely.
[1:57:03] Every day and at any time, any day, any
[1:57:08] time, you can climb the stairway to
[1:57:10] heaven and approach the throne of God's
[1:57:13] favor. Oh yeah. And all that Satan can
[1:57:17] do is to use words of fear and doubt and
[1:57:21] unbelief to try to hold you back as the
[1:57:24] accuser of the brethren.
[1:57:26] But you can cast him down and overcome
[1:57:30] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:57:33] word of your testimony and given your
[1:57:36] whole life to the cross.
[1:57:39] Hallelujah. The real problem
[1:57:43] now are the channels that are within
[1:57:47] yourself through which you're allowing
[1:57:50] Satan's fears and doubts and unbeliefs
[1:57:54] come. That's right. Yeah. Channels
[1:57:57] within your own self. The channel
[1:57:59] between God and man is
[1:58:02] open. But there are channels within your
[1:58:05] being that can get clogged. Now, no
[1:58:09] matter our fallen state as humans, we
[1:58:12] were created to be sons of God. How many
[1:58:16] believe that?
[1:58:18] That was always his intentions. We were
[1:58:20] we are his offspring.
[1:58:23] We are his creation. We are his very
[1:58:26] own.
[1:58:30] I wish you would believe that.
[1:58:33] Well, I wish you would respond if you
[1:58:35] believe that.
[1:58:37] Amen. I'll just tell you again. We are
[1:58:39] his offspring,
[1:58:42] his creation,
[1:58:44] his very own.
[1:58:46] Amen. And through Christ, he has become
[1:58:48] our redeemer, paying the full price for
[1:58:52] our restoration.
[1:58:54] [Applause]
[1:58:55] Hallelujah.
[1:58:58] Now, in the beginning, God placed man in
[1:59:01] authority over the earth. He made him
[1:59:02] superior to every other thing that was
[1:59:04] created. He gave him dominion over the
[1:59:07] fish of the sea, the birds of the air,
[1:59:11] over all nature. Everything was under
[1:59:14] his control.
[1:59:15] The very elements obeyed him.
[1:59:21] Jesus
[1:59:22] spoke to the fig
[1:59:25] tree. Adam carried that same power
[1:59:27] before the fall. Did you know that?
[1:59:30] Amen. He ruled as a little god on the
[1:59:33] earth. He operated under God's
[1:59:36] authority. The wind heard his voice and
[1:59:39] obeyed. The trees responded to his word.
[1:59:43] You know when Jesus said, "As a grain, a
[1:59:46] mustard seed, you if you have faith as a
[1:59:48] grain of mustard seed, you can say to
[1:59:49] this sycamine tree be plucked up by the
[1:59:52] root and planted in the sea and it shall
[1:59:54] obey you." He was pointing back
[1:59:58] to the dominion that man once had. Amen.
[2:00:00] Amen. Adam walked in perfect harmony
[2:00:04] with the father. There was no sickness.
[2:00:06] There was no pain. There was no death.
[2:00:08] There was no fear. There was no
[2:00:09] heartache. There was no worry. He lived
[2:00:12] in God's presence. Amen. And as a child,
[2:00:15] as an heir to all things, he enjoyed
[2:00:19] fellowship with God. And whatever he
[2:00:22] asked, he received.
[2:00:25] And everything obeyed him. That's right.
[2:00:28] That's right. That's heaven.
[2:00:32] But then came the
[2:00:34] fall. And when man when Adam lost his
[2:00:38] relationship with the father, he lost
[2:00:40] his power. The connection was severed.
[2:00:44] The open channel between God and man
[2:00:47] became clogged and suddenly he was
[2:00:50] subject to sickness, pain, fear, death.
[2:00:53] He lost his awareness of his
[2:00:55] sunship. And in its place came unbelief
[2:00:58] and doubt and fear. Amen. Amen. But
[2:01:02] Jesus,
[2:01:04] hallelujah. This is man saved. But
[2:01:08] Jesus, Amen. through his death, through
[2:01:11] his resurrection, he redeemed us. And
[2:01:14] restored our relationship with God. He
[2:01:18] didn't just save our us from our sins.
[2:01:20] He restored our sunship.
[2:01:24] Hallelujah. Through the new birth, we
[2:01:27] have become what we is originally meant
[2:01:29] to be.
[2:01:31] Amen. What the fall cheated us out of
[2:01:33] and we were born wrong. We've been born
[2:01:36] again.
[2:01:38] And yet our flesh remains fallen, but
[2:01:41] our souls are restored to full communion
[2:01:45] and fellowship with God.
[2:01:48] The Holy Spirit himself is the spirit of
[2:01:51] adoption.
[2:01:52] Oh yes. Remember, it's not like going
[2:01:55] and adopting somebody else's kids. God
[2:01:57] doesn't adopt the devil's children.
[2:02:00] But adoption comes from the the old
[2:02:03] Roman custom of taking a son who is now
[2:02:06] of age, perhaps 30 years old, and
[2:02:08] placing him with authority in his
[2:02:10] kingdom, robing him, putting a finger, a
[2:02:13] ring on his finger. So the Holy Spirit
[2:02:15] is the spirit of adoption. It places us
[2:02:19] as sons again. Amen. Through his
[2:02:22] redemption, he gave us eternal life. He
[2:02:26] reestablishes that relationship. And not
[2:02:28] just that, he advances us even further.
[2:02:32] For the lamb took the book. And in doing
[2:02:35] so, he has elevated us to kings and
[2:02:39] priests to reign on the earth.
[2:02:44] Hallelujah.
[2:02:46] Amen.
[2:02:48] But before we rule the world,
[2:02:52] how many wants to rule the world?
[2:02:55] I do. I want to be in dominion with him.
[2:02:59] Amen. Before we can rule the earth, we
[2:03:02] must first rule this earth ourself.
[2:03:07] That's right. The first dominion we must
[2:03:11] reclaim is our own flesh
[2:03:14] and bring it subject to the word. That's
[2:03:18] right. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now Christ as
[2:03:21] man took the title deed of the earth not
[2:03:25] for himself but for us. Remember as God
[2:03:29] he had it and now he hands it back as
[2:03:33] Revelation chapter 10 shows. Go and take
[2:03:36] the book and eat it. Become one with it.
[2:03:39] And when you eat it, digest it, you will
[2:03:41] prophesy or you will speak it. So you
[2:03:45] see, he hands it back. The authority is
[2:03:48] in our hands. Amen. And what do we do
[2:03:53] with it? We speak, we prophesy, we
[2:03:57] declare.
[2:03:59] Amen. Somebody with me now. We take
[2:04:02] control of the atmospheres around us. We
[2:04:06] shift our surroundings from hell to
[2:04:10] heaven.
[2:04:12] We bring heaven down to earth.
[2:04:16] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Come on,
[2:04:18] church. The Holy Ghost is heaven coming
[2:04:22] down the living man. A throne of
[2:04:26] dominion established in the human heart.
[2:04:29] the kingdom coming within you.
[2:04:34] Thank you. Now Jesus opened up the way
[2:04:37] to heaven and in his ascended.
[2:04:40] Amen. He ascended into heaven making a
[2:04:42] way. He said, "I am the way, the truth,
[2:04:45] and the life." He had to go. He had to
[2:04:48] return. He had to ascend. He had to
[2:04:51] break the powers of hell and the things
[2:04:53] between us and become the latter.
[2:04:58] And when we are born
[2:05:02] again, heaven becomes open to us.
[2:05:07] Somebody help me preach. Was that not so
[2:05:10] with the firstborn of the God race?
[2:05:14] Come on. The Bible said he's the
[2:05:16] firstborn among many brethren. The Lord
[2:05:19] Jesus. Yes. What happened at at that
[2:05:22] birth at the river Jordan when he
[2:05:25] surrendered and came obedient to the
[2:05:28] word of God coming through the prophet.
[2:05:30] Amen. The heavens opened and the Holy
[2:05:33] Spirit descended like a dove. And every
[2:05:36] time a child of God is born again,
[2:05:40] filled with the Holy Ghost, heaven
[2:05:43] opens.
[2:05:45] Amen. There's a heaven now open between
[2:05:48] that man and God
[2:05:51] that is never to be closed again.
[2:05:56] Hallelujah.
[2:06:02] But like newborn babes, we must learn to
[2:06:05] use our faith. Amen. We have spent our
[2:06:09] lives responding to the flesh,
[2:06:12] to fear, to doubt, to unbelief, to sin,
[2:06:16] and its vice.
[2:06:18] We've allowed our surroundings to
[2:06:20] dictate our faith instead of using our
[2:06:23] faith to dictate our surroundings.
[2:06:25] That's right.
[2:06:27] The enemy has used channels of our
[2:06:30] senses of sight, taste, smell, feel,
[2:06:34] hearing to bring hell into our lives.
[2:06:40] Cuz when you look around, it's hell all
[2:06:42] around. The voices you hear in this
[2:06:45] world is hell all around us.
[2:06:49] He clogs up our minds, our emotions, our
[2:06:52] our our spirits with distractions.
[2:06:55] jobs, finances, relationships, stress,
[2:07:01] anxieties, all of
[2:07:03] this because of mortal life itself.
[2:07:09] It's all become so clogged with that
[2:07:11] until God can't operate through these
[2:07:14] channels. He opened up a
[2:07:18] channel. I tried to explain to you of
[2:07:22] Daniel having prayed and answered to
[2:07:26] come.
[2:07:27] The angel Gabriel was on his way with
[2:07:29] it, but he was hindered many days
[2:07:32] because of the prince of Persia.
[2:07:36] Come on. The prince of Persia, you know,
[2:07:38] Daniel was third in the kingdom and he
[2:07:39] was busy about the kingdom. Oh, you got
[2:07:41] to send troops here and you got to
[2:07:43] finances here and you got this here and
[2:07:45] the and the busyiness of life.
[2:07:50] And he said, the angel said, I've been
[2:07:52] trying to get through.
[2:07:55] I've been trying to get through to you,
[2:07:57] but you see, you see, I I had to I had
[2:08:00] to appeal to Michael, the one that the
[2:08:02] angel who is like Jehovah, to come and
[2:08:06] intercede on your behalf, and to help me
[2:08:09] to war against the prince of Persia, and
[2:08:11] push him back. And I'm finally here with
[2:08:13] a message. Amen. Amen. I wonder how much
[2:08:17] how much how many times God's been
[2:08:19] trying to talk with you
[2:08:21] to get you still enough to get you quiet
[2:08:24] enough but you're you're so clogged with
[2:08:27] mortal life with relationships and
[2:08:29] stress anxieties and finances and jobs
[2:08:32] and the strikes distractions of this
[2:08:34] life
[2:08:37] worried about today
[2:08:39] and tomorrow.
[2:08:44] so clogged up till God can't operate
[2:08:46] through the channels that he made man
[2:08:49] for. I tell you ought to clear it out
[2:08:51] long enough.
[2:08:53] Even right now, you know, some of you
[2:08:55] have been sitting on the pew and
[2:08:56] thinking about what you got to do
[2:08:57] tomorrow and the pressures of the job
[2:09:00] and, you know, a relationship or some
[2:09:02] sickness or this problem or whatever
[2:09:04] that you have and it's been clogging up
[2:09:08] the flow of the spirit to your life even
[2:09:11] while you were sitting there. The devil
[2:09:13] didn't lay down and play dead when you
[2:09:15] started to church this morning. He's the
[2:09:17] one that caused arguments with the kids
[2:09:19] in the in in the in the car. He's the
[2:09:22] one stirred up trouble between you and
[2:09:24] your wife to get you all stirred up in
[2:09:26] your spirit.
[2:09:29] I'll tell you what, the devil can do it.
[2:09:31] He'll do it. You know, even me in my
[2:09:33] studies, I'll be preparing for a message
[2:09:36] in in the inspiration of God and I'll
[2:09:38] get a phone call or a text that'll
[2:09:40] disturb my spirit. All right. All right.
[2:09:44] It'll disturb it until I can't even
[2:09:46] think about what I'm preaching about.
[2:09:48] What is what I'm studying about, but God
[2:09:50] is word. All I can do is focus on this
[2:09:52] problem.
[2:09:54] The devil knows how to do it.
[2:09:57] Amen. But you see, you see again in this
[2:10:00] cloud of distractions, we often
[2:10:04] forget and lose awareness of why we are
[2:10:07] even here. Amen.
[2:10:09] You are you you're more important than
[2:10:12] just to be the CEO on your job. You're
[2:10:16] more important than just the next
[2:10:18] paycheck.
[2:10:20] Amen. Your relationship with God is more
[2:10:23] important than that girl or that boy.
[2:10:26] Amen. And even we redeemed are falling
[2:10:29] short of what Jesus commanded us to do.
[2:10:31] We are not just to be saved to survive.
[2:10:36] We were redeemed to reign
[2:10:41] to be victorious.
[2:10:43] And what did Jesus say? Bind the powers
[2:10:46] of Satan. Release the powers of heaven.
[2:10:50] This is our mandate. This is our
[2:10:52] authority. This is who we are.
[2:10:57] Amen.
[2:11:01] We are to pray. We are thus to intercede
[2:11:04] concerning situations and
[2:11:06] circumstances. And we are to pray like
[2:11:08] this. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
[2:11:14] in earth as it is in heaven.
[2:11:20] Oh, one day the earth is going to be
[2:11:22] that way. Listen, that's where your
[2:11:24] earth That's right. needs to be brought
[2:11:26] subject to. Where his will is done in
[2:11:30] earth. your earth as it is in heaven
[2:11:33] where his kingdom come and the king sits
[2:11:36] on your heart which is the Holy Ghost
[2:11:40] Christ himself the Lord of glory Jehovah
[2:11:43] God
[2:11:44] dwell it on the inside of you
[2:11:51] by the power of the spirit we're to take
[2:11:52] lordship over sin
[2:11:55] lordship over sickness
[2:11:58] lordship over disease oh yeah and bring
[2:12:01] God's will on the earth.
[2:12:08] It's his will for us to cast out devils.
[2:12:12] Amen. Yes, it is. It's God that is that
[2:12:16] is
[2:12:17] enforcing, thus bringing heaven to a
[2:12:21] sick
[2:12:22] body. Come on.
[2:12:25] Amen. It's his will for us to cast Satan
[2:12:27] out of men's souls. Yeah. Delivering
[2:12:30] them from the prison house of sin and it
[2:12:33] spirits of torments.
[2:12:37] Let's use some Bible
[2:12:39] references. Listen, I I got a lot of hay
[2:12:41] on my fork and if you're tired, you're
[2:12:43] just going home.
[2:12:45] You're
[2:12:49] dismissed. The rest of you, I'm going to
[2:12:51] preach a while.
[2:12:54] Let's go to Matthew chapter 10 and verse
[2:12:56] one.
[2:12:59] Maybe I'll fight better with my coat
[2:13:06] off. Listen. Matthew 10 and verse one.
[2:13:09] Let's read
[2:13:11] this. And when he had called unto him
[2:13:14] 12, his 12 disciple, he gave them
[2:13:17] power against unclean spirits to cast
[2:13:20] them out and to heal all manners of
[2:13:22] sickness and all manner of diseases.
[2:13:26] So why what I'm going to show you about
[2:13:27] this is this is what he gives his
[2:13:31] disciples
[2:13:33] is power. Now this is before the Holy
[2:13:36] Ghost come. Amen. And they had him on
[2:13:39] virtue of his presence with them.
[2:13:43] But when the Holy Ghost come we have it
[2:13:45] on the virtue of his presence in us.
[2:13:49] The God with us became the God in us.
[2:13:52] Amen.
[2:13:53] And in Matthewap 10:7, he said, "And go
[2:13:56] ye and
[2:13:58] preach saying, "The kingdom of heaven is
[2:14:01] at hand."
[2:14:04] Oh, well, brother Tim, that's 2,000
[2:14:05] years ago, and it hadn't come yet.
[2:14:07] You're mistaken. Amen.
[2:14:09] at hand. It means or it means near which
[2:14:13] means that God's kingdom where he reigns
[2:14:16] and his will is done is not a distant
[2:14:19] future but is present and is accessible.
[2:14:24] Amen. So he said go and preach that
[2:14:27] heaven is accessible.
[2:14:32] Amen. Go and preach
[2:14:35] that I'm present.
[2:14:38] Oh, I wish he was present today. That's
[2:14:40] why the Holy Ghost is here. It's not
[2:14:43] another God. Amen. It's not another
[2:14:45] person of the Trinity.
[2:14:47] Amen. It is God himself
[2:14:50] that came in you.
[2:14:53] Glory to God. Amen. Amen. So you see
[2:14:57] when you when we say the kingdom of God
[2:15:00] is at hand, it means that it's not a
[2:15:04] distant future.
[2:15:07] But it's present and now accessible. So
[2:15:12] go tell everybody
[2:15:16] that heaven is accessible.
[2:15:19] If you're sick, heaven is accessible. If
[2:15:22] you're lost, heaven is accessible. If
[2:15:25] you're bound with drugs, heaven is
[2:15:27] accessible. If you're filled up with
[2:15:29] chains of tobacco, heaven is accessible.
[2:15:34] It's It's open for you, accessible. Heal
[2:15:37] the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the
[2:15:41] dead, cast out devils. As freely as you
[2:15:45] receive, freely give.
[2:15:48] You're to give out just as freely as you
[2:15:50] got it.
[2:15:53] Yes, sir.
[2:15:54] Amen.
[2:15:56] For where Satan is, where Christ is
[2:15:59] king, Satan is cast out. That's right.
[2:16:01] What do you think salvation is? It's
[2:16:04] dethroning Satan from the heart.
[2:16:08] And when Christ's lordship is exercised,
[2:16:12] the sick are healed. Yeah. Amen. The
[2:16:15] dead are raised.
[2:16:17] Amen. And and we are to do this given
[2:16:21] out freely as we receive. Mark 6 and
[2:16:24] verse 7. And he called him the 12 and
[2:16:26] began to send them forth by two and two.
[2:16:29] And he gave them power over unclean
[2:16:33] spirits.
[2:16:35] Amen.
[2:16:37] Amen. Brother, if this was power because
[2:16:40] he was presence in the flesh, what
[2:16:43] again? What about his power present
[2:16:45] because his holy spirit is in you? Verse
[2:16:48] 12. And they went out and preached that
[2:16:50] man should repent and they cast out
[2:16:52] devils and anointed with oil. And many
[2:16:55] that were sick were sick. They healed
[2:16:58] them. Amen.
[2:17:01] Let's go to Luke chapter
[2:17:03] 9 verse one. Did I read this one? Luke 9
[2:17:08] verse one. He called his 12 disciples
[2:17:10] together and gave them power and
[2:17:11] authority over all devils to cure the
[2:17:12] diseases. And he sent them to preach the
[2:17:14] kingdom of God and to heal the sick. I
[2:17:17] want you to see preaching and healing
[2:17:19] goes hand in hand. You're not really
[2:17:22] preaching the gospel if you're not
[2:17:24] healing the sick.
[2:17:27] Come on. If you're not casting out
[2:17:29] devils, the principal job of the church
[2:17:32] is to cast Satan out, not live with him.
[2:17:38] Too many are young people who live with
[2:17:40] with Satan, live with his sins, live
[2:17:43] with his habits. Not just young people,
[2:17:45] old people.
[2:17:48] God didn't call us for that. He called
[2:17:51] us to cast him out.
[2:17:53] Amen. Luke chapter 10 verse one. After
[2:17:56] these things, the Lord appointed 70
[2:17:58] others. It wasn't just the disciples
[2:18:00] or the apostles. He sent them out two by
[2:18:03] two for his face into every
[2:18:05] city whether he would where he himself
[2:18:08] would come. He said, "Therefore the said
[2:18:11] to them, the harvest truly is great, and
[2:18:13] the labors are few. Pray ye therefore
[2:18:16] the Lord of the harvest that he would
[2:18:17] send forth labors into his harvest."
[2:18:20] Verse 9, "And heal the sick that are
[2:18:24] therein, and say to them, the kingdom of
[2:18:26] God has come near to you." Verse 17,
[2:18:30] "And the 70 returned again with joy,
[2:18:34] saying, Lord, even devils are subject
[2:18:38] unto us through thy name." And he said
[2:18:41] unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning
[2:18:45] fall from heaven. Amen. Oh, I want you
[2:18:48] to hear. When they were casting out
[2:18:50] devils. Come on. When they were healing
[2:18:54] the sick, they were making Satan fall.
[2:18:58] When the lost is s is saved, it is
[2:19:01] making Satan fall.
[2:19:04] Come on. It's clearing the pathway of
[2:19:08] the accuser. And you're saying your sins
[2:19:11] that were many are now all forgiven.
[2:19:16] Hallelujah.
[2:19:21] And he says,
[2:19:22] "Behold, I give you power to tread on
[2:19:27] serpents and
[2:19:29] scorpions and over some of the power."
[2:19:33] Oh, I'm misreading, am I? And all the
[2:19:36] power of the enemy.
[2:19:39] And nothing, shall we say, nothing?
[2:19:42] Nothing shall by any means hurt you.
[2:19:46] You ain't going to be harmed by any of
[2:19:48] it. Amen. You're victorious. You will
[2:19:52] prevail.
[2:19:55] And finally, when he was leaving, he
[2:19:57] gave us his final commission. Last words
[2:20:00] of Jesus before he departs. Given the
[2:20:04] final words to the church, his great
[2:20:07] commission. Mark 16:15. And he said, "Go
[2:20:09] into all the world and preach the gospel
[2:20:13] where?" To every creature. He that
[2:20:15] believeth and is baptized shall be
[2:20:17] saved. He that believeth not shall be
[2:20:19] damned. And these signs shall follow
[2:20:23] them that believe. In my name shall they
[2:20:26] cast out devils. They shall speak
[2:20:29] heaven's language.
[2:20:32] Come on. They shall speak with new
[2:20:34] tongues. They will take up serpents. And
[2:20:37] if they drink any deadly thing, it shall
[2:20:40] not hurt them. They shall lay hands on
[2:20:42] the sick and they shall recover. Amen.
[2:20:49] That's his commission.
[2:20:52] He told you, "Okay, I'm leaving you a
[2:20:56] kingdom, but you're going to have to
[2:20:59] cast Satan out and off of the promises."
[2:21:04] Amen. Come on. Amen. So now and and and
[2:21:09] of course we know that that when Christ
[2:21:11] was elevated on to his own right hand in
[2:21:14] the heavenly places, he elevated his
[2:21:17] church too because the Bible said he
[2:21:20] exalted him far above all principalities
[2:21:22] and power and might and dominion and
[2:21:24] every name that is named not only in
[2:21:26] this world but the world to come and put
[2:21:28] all things under his feet and gave him
[2:21:30] to be the head over the church which is
[2:21:33] his body. So if it's under his feet,
[2:21:37] it's under your feet
[2:21:40] because you're his body.
[2:21:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:21:46] Now, let's just talk about the body of
[2:21:48] Christ for a minute. We're going to
[2:21:50] focus on this for the next few minutes.
[2:21:54] When he created human body, he crafted
[2:21:57] it with intention, with precision.
[2:22:01] He did it with purpose. Every part, the
[2:22:04] teeth, the tongue, the eyes, the nose,
[2:22:08] the hands, the feet, all this would be
[2:22:12] needed to contact the kingdom of the
[2:22:14] earth.
[2:22:16] It was designed to function in perfect
[2:22:18] harmony.
[2:22:20] Do you believe that? And each member has
[2:22:23] its role. It has its every member of
[2:22:26] your body, your hands, your feet, your
[2:22:28] eyes, whatever has has its divine
[2:22:30] function.
[2:22:33] And that just as he designed the human
[2:22:34] body to operate with order and
[2:22:37] purpose, how much more do you think that
[2:22:42] he set his church in order with every
[2:22:46] member assigned to a place, a calling,
[2:22:50] to a function. Amen.
[2:22:54] The body of Christ was never meant to be
[2:22:56] stagnant
[2:22:58] or to be
[2:23:00] disjointed. He He was designed to move,
[2:23:02] to operate, to manifest the
[2:23:04] supernatural. Amen. Stay with me just a
[2:23:07] minute.
[2:23:09] Amen. He He was designed to function in
[2:23:12] the power of
[2:23:14] Christ in heavenly
[2:23:16] places as a conduit for of God's divine
[2:23:21] presence. Amen. What do you think
[2:23:24] happened at the gate called beautiful
[2:23:25] after they received the Holy Ghost? It
[2:23:28] wasn't just a dwelling. They were now a
[2:23:30] conduit.
[2:23:32] So they said silver and gold have I not
[2:23:34] I can't do this by human means but what
[2:23:37] I have I give.
[2:23:41] So the Holy Ghost that they had they
[2:23:43] became a conduct a conduit to bring
[2:23:46] heaven to the man at at the gate called
[2:23:49] beautiful. Amen. Hallelujah. And he rose
[2:23:53] up there shouting dancing rejoicing over
[2:23:56] his crippled condition.
[2:23:59] I tell you, if it'll do it then, it'll
[2:24:00] do it now.
[2:24:02] There's more than physical crippled
[2:24:04] conditions here. Amen. There's people
[2:24:07] that are crippled in their spirit, their
[2:24:08] attitude. They're crippled in their lack
[2:24:10] of forgiveness. They're crippled in
[2:24:12] complexes or you can be crippled in many
[2:24:15] ways, but the church is be a conduit.
[2:24:19] Through which the Holy Ghost is a flow.
[2:24:23] Amen. What do you think you're here for
[2:24:25] this morning? To be entertained. know
[2:24:27] you are to be a conduit through which
[2:24:30] the Holy Ghost flows
[2:24:32] to another. That as you worship God and
[2:24:36] you ascend into heaven, you bring down
[2:24:38] the Holy Spirit to work here on the
[2:24:40] earth.
[2:24:42] Amen.
[2:24:43] Your songs are not to entertain to be
[2:24:46] just beautiful. Your songs are there to
[2:24:48] bring heaven's atmosphere in the church.
[2:24:51] Because when heaven is here, the sick
[2:24:53] are healed, the dead is raised.
[2:24:56] Sins are cast out. Satan has to leave.
[2:25:05] So if he designed the human body to
[2:25:07] operate with with order and purpose, how
[2:25:11] much more is he set his church in order
[2:25:13] with every member
[2:25:17] assigned a place, a calling, a function?
[2:25:22] We're not meant to be stagnant or just
[2:25:25] just chony bunch of people.
[2:25:28] We're designed to be a conduit.
[2:25:31] A body that does not function is
[2:25:34] crippled.
[2:25:39] I wish people across the airways and in
[2:25:41] this building this morning would get
[2:25:42] that. A body that does not function
[2:25:46] is crippled. That's right.
[2:25:50] A hand that will not function is a
[2:25:52] crippled hand. Amen. An eye that is
[2:25:57] blind is a crippled eye.
[2:26:00] Come on. Amen. And just as a human body
[2:26:04] depends on its senses, eyes to see, ears
[2:26:07] to hear, tongue to speak, so too does a
[2:26:10] church depend on the gifts of the
[2:26:13] spirit. Amen. Prophecy, wisdom,
[2:26:16] knowledge, healing, tongues, whereby we
[2:26:20] speak heaven's language.
[2:26:22] These are not optional. I know today we
[2:26:25] want to think they're just optional.
[2:26:27] They are the very lifelines.
[2:26:31] The very lifelines through which God
[2:26:33] flows his power and his revelation to
[2:26:36] his people. Come on. Amen. They are
[2:26:39] passageways of the supernatural. Amen.
[2:26:42] Amen. And yet, why is revelation
[2:26:45] lacking? Because the body is dull of
[2:26:48] hearing. Because the church has
[2:26:50] neglected the very gifts it needs to
[2:26:52] keep it alive.
[2:26:54] Without vision, the church will stumble
[2:26:58] blindly.
[2:27:00] Amen. Without gifts and operation, the
[2:27:04] power is absent.
[2:27:05] Without the supernatural, the church
[2:27:08] becomes nothing but a lifeless structure
[2:27:11] stripped of divine authority.
[2:27:14] Amen. Now you see why Satan wants to sus
[2:27:18] suppress and stop them.
[2:27:21] Now true every member does not carry
[2:27:24] every function, but each plays a vital
[2:27:27] role. Together we complete we can form a
[2:27:31] complete and living and breathing
[2:27:32] expression of God's power here upon the
[2:27:35] earth. It is through this body through
[2:27:38] his these divine assets that God moves.
[2:27:43] Amen. The question is will we function
[2:27:46] as we were created to? Will we allow the
[2:27:50] Holy Spirit to flow freely?
[2:27:52] Will we break from the dullness and the
[2:27:55] lay of the seed in the sea and malady of
[2:27:58] lukewarmness and throw off the spirit of
[2:28:00] slumber and awaken to the supernatural
[2:28:03] order that God has ordained?
[2:28:07] The time to be passive is over. The body
[2:28:10] must rise.
[2:28:12] The body must move. The body must
[2:28:15] function. The bride must be Jesus Christ
[2:28:20] in action on the earth.
[2:28:23] For when it does, and it must, the power
[2:28:26] of God will flow like a mighty river.
[2:28:28] And the church will no longer be weak.
[2:28:30] And it will no longer be blind. It'll no
[2:28:33] longer be powerless, but it will be an
[2:28:35] unstoppable bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:28:39] Hallelujah. That's what he made you to
[2:28:41] be. The unstoppable bride of Jesus
[2:28:44] Christ. overcomers in this last age.
[2:28:56] Satan through the unyielding grip of the
[2:28:59] laws of sin and
[2:29:01] death, he afflicts the human
[2:29:07] body. Sickness is his
[2:29:09] weapon. Disease is his invasion.
[2:29:13] pain is his
[2:29:15] mark. Cancer and all sickness and
[2:29:19] infirmity and suffering, they're all
[2:29:22] agents of Satan's kingdom.
[2:29:26] And by the law of death, which operate
[2:29:28] or entered through
[2:29:30] sin, he was given these grounds to
[2:29:35] operate. Satan strikes with
[2:29:38] sickness because of the fallen state of
[2:29:41] man. The body yields to it.
[2:29:45] He sends affliction and because of the
[2:29:49] curse, the flesh suffers.
[2:29:53] He torments with headache, with
[2:29:56] grief, with
[2:29:59] despair. And the weakened soul bound by
[2:30:02] the weight of sin's consequences, it'll
[2:30:04] succumb to its oppression. That's right.
[2:30:10] But if Satan's
[2:30:11] laws can operate so powerfully in the
[2:30:15] human body, I want to ask you something.
[2:30:19] How much greater, how much more
[2:30:21] unstoppable should the operation of
[2:30:23] God's power be in the body of Christ?
[2:30:26] Amen.
[2:30:27] If the law of sin and death can spread
[2:30:30] destruction, then surely the law of the
[2:30:33] spirit of life in Christ Jesus should
[2:30:36] bring forth wholeness and power and
[2:30:38] divine revelation. Amen. Let me assert
[2:30:41] to you this morning, the church is not a
[2:30:43] weak lifeless structure. It is a living
[2:30:46] breathing force of divine authority.
[2:30:50] That's who we
[2:30:51] are within the body. I'm talking about
[2:30:55] the body of Christ. The law of the
[2:30:57] spirit of life is not just present. It
[2:31:01] is active.
[2:31:03] Hallelujah. It is alive. It is more
[2:31:06] potent than any sickness or any disease
[2:31:09] or any demonic affliction.
[2:31:12] Hallelujah.
[2:31:18] Where are the manifestations of this
[2:31:20] law? Where is the flow of divine
[2:31:23] healing?
[2:31:24] that will silence the decrees of
[2:31:27] sickness. Where is the power of
[2:31:29] revelation that dismantles the lie of
[2:31:31] the
[2:31:32] enemy? Where are the gifts of the spirit
[2:31:35] in full operation, rendering Satan's
[2:31:38] works null and
[2:31:41] void? We're on the highway.
[2:31:44] But oh
[2:31:46] Satan, that old serpent
[2:31:48] hisses and with his poisonous breath he
[2:31:52] whispers, "The days of miracles are
[2:31:54] passed."
[2:31:56] They were only for a sign anyway. They
[2:31:59] were just for vindication. And once the
[2:32:01] word is here, we have no more need of
[2:32:05] them. And the church set smugly claiming
[2:32:10] revelation. When true revelation gives
[2:32:14] you power over the devil.
[2:32:18] That's right. What too many have is
[2:32:21] doctrine a dogma and what we need is
[2:32:25] life.
[2:32:32] Brother Brandham would say this at the
[2:32:34] close of the divine healing
[2:32:37] movement. He said, "We begin to find out
[2:32:40] miracles isn't taking place no more like
[2:32:42] they
[2:32:43] were. The sick go home
[2:32:46] sick." And it isn't because of God. It's
[2:32:50] because of the lack of revival among the
[2:32:52] people.
[2:32:54] There is no revival. and they sit and
[2:32:56] listen and go home and say, "Well, that
[2:32:59] was pretty good." Mhm. And they sit
[2:33:03] there, there's just not that zeal, that
[2:33:05] something in people that should be
[2:33:07] there. Let me tell you this morning. His
[2:33:11] law should be working in us.
[2:33:16] The law of the spirit of life should be
[2:33:18] working in the church, flowing through
[2:33:20] the body. Amen.
[2:33:22] Let me tell you again, just as disease
[2:33:25] spreads through the natural body, so
[2:33:28] should the power of Christ flood through
[2:33:30] the body of Christ. And just as Satan
[2:33:33] enforces sickness, so should the church
[2:33:36] enforce deliverance and healing and the
[2:33:39] full manifestation of the kingdom of
[2:33:41] God. Amen. The law of the spirit is not
[2:33:44] passive. It is not dormant and it is not
[2:33:47] weak. It is the very force that raised
[2:33:50] up Jesus from the dead. And that power
[2:33:52] is in his
[2:33:54] church. Oh, hallelujah. I feel it moving
[2:33:57] on the inside of me this morning. I can
[2:34:00] speak in other
[2:34:02] languages. Hallelujah.
[2:34:06] Amen. The question is not whether the
[2:34:08] law, the spirit of life is real. No,
[2:34:11] that's not the question. That was
[2:34:13] settled. That was thoroughly proven when
[2:34:16] Jesus opened the eyes of the blind. When
[2:34:18] he unstopped the ears of the deaf, when
[2:34:20] he quickened to life the dead, when he
[2:34:22] rose again triumphant,
[2:34:25] and then in these last days, he
[2:34:27] demonstrated again to this generation so
[2:34:30] that we would know once again that the
[2:34:33] law of the spirit of life still reigns
[2:34:35] supreme.
[2:34:37] And he showed countless miracles and
[2:34:41] signs in the ministries in this last
[2:34:44] day. So this generation would be without
[2:34:48] excuse.
[2:34:52] The question is not whether the spirit
[2:34:56] and life is
[2:34:57] real. The question
[2:34:59] is will we rise in faith, in revelation,
[2:35:03] in boldness and let it work.
[2:35:07] Will we be a channel through which it
[2:35:10] can flow?
[2:35:12] Satan has no power.
[2:35:16] He has no power with the authority of
[2:35:18] Christ is fully enforced. That's right.
[2:35:21] As a church, we must awaken.
[2:35:25] Amen. Brother Brandon, preach that to us
[2:35:27] when just once more, Lord, about Satan
[2:35:29] or Samuel rather or Samson sleeping on
[2:35:32] the on the knees of Delilah. Amen.
[2:35:36] Amen. Sleep and letting the power be cut
[2:35:38] off. The church must arise. The church
[2:35:41] must demonstrate the law of life until
[2:35:44] every sickness bows and every stronghold
[2:35:48] come crumbles and the kingdom of God is
[2:35:50] made manifest on the earth.
[2:35:54] So Satan with his limited power can
[2:35:57] enforce his
[2:35:59] laws upon mankind. And we see it every
[2:36:02] day.
[2:36:04] If he can oppress, if he can afflict, if
[2:36:08] he can manipulate,
[2:36:10] if he can come through the laws of sin
[2:36:13] and death, how much more should the
[2:36:16] almighty God enforce his own laws upon
[2:36:19] his redeemed?
[2:36:21] How much more should the laws of divine
[2:36:23] healing override sickness? Yes, sir. How
[2:36:27] much more should the power of revelation
[2:36:30] demolish the lies of the devil, his
[2:36:32] deception and doubt? Amen. How much more
[2:36:35] should the gifts and manifestation of
[2:36:38] the spirit move freely through the
[2:36:39] church? Amen. Proving that the kingdom
[2:36:42] of God is supreme and over every power
[2:36:45] of the devil. Amen.
[2:36:49] If the devil can enforce his dominion,
[2:36:53] so that the world can recognize the
[2:36:56] weight of his affliction, how much more
[2:36:59] should the children of God stand up.
[2:37:02] Take the rightful place, and demand that
[2:37:05] the laws of heaven be recognized among
[2:37:07] us.
[2:37:09] We are not a weak, struggling people.
[2:37:13] We are sons and daughters of the living
[2:37:16] God. The law of the liberty in Christ
[2:37:20] has shattered the chains of sin and
[2:37:24] death. And it's not just a doctrine.
[2:37:27] It's a living force.
[2:37:30] And it's meant to be in full operation
[2:37:32] within us.
[2:37:35] But here's the
[2:37:37] issue. Listen close.
[2:37:40] We have allowed vain's philosophies,
[2:37:44] empty
[2:37:45] traditions, and powerless teachings to
[2:37:49] weaken our faith. Amen. The mind has
[2:37:52] been so
[2:37:54] bombarded with theology and opinions and
[2:37:59] intellectual reason till it's been
[2:38:01] pulled away from the unshakable power of
[2:38:04] the word of God.
[2:38:06] We have settled for words when they were
[2:38:09] meant for demonstration.
[2:38:13] But I tell you now, we are nearing the
[2:38:16] hour. We are here in the hour where the
[2:38:19] church will wake up.
[2:38:23] That's what I'm trying to sound the
[2:38:24] alarm for this morning. Tell you the
[2:38:27] kingdom of God is here. It's not just
[2:38:30] coming. Oh yes, there's a millennium
[2:38:32] coming. Yes, there's a rapture. Yes.
[2:38:37] For right now, the kingdom of God is
[2:38:38] among us. It is life and peace and joy
[2:38:42] in the Holy Ghost.
[2:38:45] Amen. We must wake up a time where the
[2:38:48] true believers will recognize what has
[2:38:51] always been there.
[2:38:53] Amen. The day is at hand when faith must
[2:38:57] rise up. Amen. Not just a little faith,
[2:38:59] but rapturing faith that's unshackled
[2:39:02] from doubt. and the church rise and move
[2:39:05] in the power like it was meant to be.
[2:39:07] Yes, sir.
[2:39:12] I want you to understand this.
[2:39:17] Faith does not come by
[2:39:20] fasting. Faith does not come by praying.
[2:39:25] Faith does not come by reading a book.
[2:39:30] Fasting is good. Praying is good.
[2:39:34] Reading is good. But those things alone
[2:39:37] do not create faith.
[2:39:41] Faith is, listen carefully, faith is a
[2:39:46] deep settled certainty in the heart.
[2:39:52] It is an unshakable knowing, a divine
[2:39:55] assurance that what God has said is
[2:40:00] already done.
[2:40:01] [Applause]
[2:40:05] already done.
[2:40:10] It's just as natural as breathing.
[2:40:14] It's just as unconscious as walking to
[2:40:16] your car, turning the key, driving home,
[2:40:21] because you already know you can do it.
[2:40:26] Amen. You don't analyze it. You don't
[2:40:28] question it. You just do it. That's
[2:40:30] right. That's how faith is meant to work
[2:40:32] in a believer's life. The reason we
[2:40:35] struggle is because we've not become
[2:40:37] fully accustomed to the laws of the
[2:40:39] spirit as we become accustomed to the
[2:40:41] laws of the natural.
[2:40:44] But when the church, I'm talking about
[2:40:46] you and you and you and you. Do I have
[2:40:50] to single you out? Do I have to call
[2:40:52] your name? When the church when you
[2:40:55] fully grasp that God's laws of healing
[2:41:00] and power and deliverance are just as
[2:41:03] real and active as gravity itself. There
[2:41:06] will be no stopping to the outpouring of
[2:41:08] the Holy Ghost.
[2:41:10] The church must come to a place of
[2:41:13] absolute conviction. A place where doubt
[2:41:15] is no longer entertained. A place where
[2:41:18] miracles are no longer unexpected. A
[2:41:22] place where faith operates like a second
[2:41:24] nature. And that hour is here.
[2:41:29] You have arrived at that hour. Will you
[2:41:32] walk in it? Will you be an Enoch? It's a
[2:41:34] rapture hour. Somebody must walk up the
[2:41:37] king's highway into their position of
[2:41:40] sunship in the heavens.
[2:41:48] We were never meant to be weak and
[2:41:50] powerless.
[2:41:51] But if we could clear the channel, sweep
[2:41:54] away man-made traditions and doctrines
[2:41:57] and fear and doubt and religious
[2:42:01] formalities
[2:42:03] and fully surrender to God's will.
[2:42:06] The church would just explode under the
[2:42:10] dynamic supernatural power of God. Amen.
[2:42:15] We were not created to live beneath our
[2:42:18] calling and beneath our privileges. We
[2:42:21] were called to reign to have dominion.
[2:42:25] We are new creation in Christ. We are
[2:42:28] designed to control, to rule, to bring
[2:42:30] praise to almighty God. Amen. But to do
[2:42:34] that, you got to die to yourself. All
[2:42:35] right. You got to let go of your limited
[2:42:38] understanding,
[2:42:40] your small human thoughts and step fully
[2:42:43] into the mind of Christ.
[2:42:47] You got to quit leaning on the
[2:42:49] smallmindedness of human understanding
[2:42:52] and learn to lean on the mind of Christ,
[2:42:55] his
[2:42:56] understanding that can only come by the
[2:42:58] new birth.
[2:43:02] Then we will think like Jesus does.
[2:43:04] Amen.
[2:43:06] That's when
[2:43:08] impossibilities will become possible.
[2:43:10] Amen. And if we could abandon his will,
[2:43:14] our will, I mean, for his if we could
[2:43:17] lose ourselves completely in him, then
[2:43:20] the same power that operated through
[2:43:22] Jesus would flow through us and it would
[2:43:25] be just as natural as breathing.
[2:43:28] Miracles would no longer be rare. That's
[2:43:31] right. That's a shame.
[2:43:33] Come on. They would be expected. Yes,
[2:43:36] sir. Healing would not be occasional.
[2:43:39] It would be continual. And even our
[2:43:42] bodies would be changed and glorified.
[2:43:46] The church would no longer be struggling
[2:43:48] in the flesh. It would be operating in
[2:43:51] the dominion of the spirit.
[2:43:56] Let the musicians come as I bring these
[2:43:59] final thoughts.
[2:44:01] Jesus said, "If you abide in me and my
[2:44:04] words abide in you, ask what you will
[2:44:06] and it shall be given to you."
[2:44:10] Why? Because God and his word are one.
[2:44:15] Amen.
[2:44:17] He said, "In the beginning was the word
[2:44:19] and the word was with God and the word
[2:44:20] was God and the word was made flesh and
[2:44:23] dwelt among us."
[2:44:25] You can't have God without his word.
[2:44:27] That's right. You cannot claim to walk
[2:44:29] with him and reject what he has spoken.
[2:44:32] You cannot be spiritfilled and deny his
[2:44:35] word. If he abides in you, his very life
[2:44:40] abides in you. If his word abides there,
[2:44:43] if his word's alive in you, his power
[2:44:45] then is alive in you. Amen.
[2:44:48] We are not called to be weak, defeated,
[2:44:52] and struggling.
[2:44:54] We were created to reign in power and
[2:44:58] manifest heaven on earth. I'm telling
[2:45:01] you as a church this morning, it's time
[2:45:04] to clear the channel.
[2:45:07] Amen. It's time to cast off the dead
[2:45:09] religion. It's time to surrender fully
[2:45:12] so that the church can fully move in the
[2:45:15] unstoppable supernatural flow of the
[2:45:17] spirit. I want you to know the world is
[2:45:21] waiting. The earth is groaning and
[2:45:24] heaven is watching and the church must
[2:45:27] arise and
[2:45:29] manifest their sunship.
[2:45:32] We are word bride, a people born of the
[2:45:36] word, a people who've received the word
[2:45:39] and it's restored truth.
[2:45:45] It's time now for the word to be in
[2:45:48] action.
[2:45:53] The question
[2:45:55] is, will you bring heaven down to your
[2:45:57] situation?
[2:46:01] Can we operate a church
[2:46:03] service where heaven comes
[2:46:06] down? Where the joy of the Lord becomes
[2:46:08] our strength? Where the praises of God
[2:46:12] goes up and angels descend and ascend
[2:46:15] upon the latter of the Holy Spirit?
[2:46:18] Can we be a channel through which the
[2:46:20] Holy Spirit moves, through which he
[2:46:23] directs, to where he guides, where he
[2:46:25] leads?
[2:46:26] Can we be the voice of the spirit? God's
[2:46:30] voice upon the earth. It's time that we
[2:46:32] arise.
[2:46:34] Shake off the dead works of the night.
[2:46:37] For we are not children of the night. We
[2:46:40] are children of the day. Let us arise as
[2:46:43] the children of God and claim our
[2:46:46] inheritance.
[2:46:47] The sa Satan is defeated.
[2:46:51] Death itself is defeated and you are
[2:46:54] more than conquerors. Rise to your feet
[2:46:57] this morning and claim it for yourself
[2:47:00] now in Jesus name.
[2:47:03] Hallelujah. Father in the name of Jesus
[2:47:06] Christ, I proclaim victory over every
[2:47:09] sin, over every disease, over every
[2:47:11] affliction, over every every devil that
[2:47:14] would be in the midst. I today release
[2:47:16] the powers of heaven as a channel of God
[2:47:21] to come down into this building today in
[2:47:23] the glories of God flow down into this
[2:47:26] place and flow into every heart. And I
[2:47:30] commission today by the authority of the
[2:47:32] word of God for adopted sons to bring
[2:47:35] heaven down to earth to bring heaven in
[2:47:38] their situation.
[2:47:40] Amen. for heaven to come down and
[2:47:43] sickness leave troubles flee and
[2:47:47] victories be won in the name of Jesus
[2:47:50] Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:47:53] Hallelujah. Let a shout of victory come
[2:47:56] out of this place right now.
[2:47:58] [Applause]
[2:47:59] Hallelujah.
[2:48:01] [Applause]
[2:48:03] Hallelujah. Rejoice over the
[2:48:06] enemy. He is a defeated enemy.
[2:48:10] Rejoice. You got the sword of the king
[2:48:13] in your in your hand this morning. You
[2:48:16] can conquer every devil. You can defeat
[2:48:18] every enemy. You're more than conquerors
[2:48:21] through him that love you. You have an
[2:48:23] intercessor that is sitting on high that
[2:48:25] is still fighting for you. Amen. That
[2:48:28] everything that he paid for, he fights
[2:48:30] to bring it to you this morning. Will
[2:48:32] you also fight?
[2:48:35] Will you knock down the accuser? Will it
[2:48:37] be this morning that it be your prayers
[2:48:40] that you be your prayers and they knock
[2:48:42] Satan down that we see him fall like
[2:48:44] lightning from heaven? For power has
[2:48:48] been given to you over every unclean
[2:48:50] spirit.
[2:48:51] Amen. Every power of darkness.
[2:48:54] Hallelujah.
[2:48:56] Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. I
[2:48:59] want you to worship God once again. Come
[2:49:01] on.
[2:49:02] Come on, Jesus. Worship him like you
[2:49:06] mean it right now.
[2:49:08] Do it with all your heart. Do it with
[2:49:11] all your heart. Amen. You can say he's
[2:49:14] alpha. He's omega. He's the beginning.
[2:49:16] He's the end. He's the root, the
[2:49:18] offspring of David, the bride and the
[2:49:20] morning star. He that was, he that was,
[2:49:23] is, and he that shall come. The same
[2:49:25] yesterday, today, and forever. He's the
[2:49:28] Lord God omnipotent that reigns. He'll
[2:49:31] reign in your life today. The kingdom
