told him says when we take your blood said it'll tell us everything we need to know about your body and I thought well the prophet of God said amen that when he's looking at you he's not looking at who you're affiliated with he's looking to see if you have a blood tag if you got a blood tag it tells him everything he needs to know about about you amen if it could in the in in the realm of disease and everything tell them everything they need to know about the body what about the blood of Jesus Christ amen which cleanses us from all sin amen and presents us spotless amen before the throne of grace amen we love you with the love of the Lord You're a wonderful group to preach to you're the cream of the crop hallelujah amen and so it's a privilege Amen to be here let's just turn in our Bibles and to uh I'm just going to read um two verses out of again out of Deuteronomy 321 and 12 and then I'll have you turn to the Book of Job as an eagle stirreth up her nest flutter Earth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings so alone so the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him amen just job Book of Job 29 there's just one verse Verse 18 then I said I shall die in my nest and I shall multiply my days as the sand you can be seated amen and if we can just bow our heads for prayer for just a moment father we thank you for all that you are doing in this camp we thank you for your love to your children we ask you Lord in this service that you will have complete preeminence Lord you would get me out of the way and anoint my lips Lord and also for the the young people Lord that you would anoint their ears to hear father you as the great father Eagle are flying over your children and you're calling to them out of every condition oh God and I pray father for the sick among us Lord the the captive Among Us uh Lord whatever the situation may be you are the same yesterday today and forever father and we'll commit it to you in this service in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you I want to title this this evening what I titled it last night the eagle Christian but I want to at you amen from a a little different angle as we was talking about the eagle and what she was born or the eagle is born to do being a special equipped bird uh special equipped to fly to places that no other bird can fly to the prophet of God said if the church only knew how to set its wings of faith into the promise of God not beat from here or beat from there join the Methodist join the Baptist join the Presbyterian join the Oneness join the assembly join every little ISM that comes along that's not it it's to set your wings in his promise and let the Holy Ghost just Lift You Up Up and Up you know we can find a condition where you know as as Jesus taught us in Matthew 13 where the seed would fall into different conditions and and in these conditions because of what they were whether it was the Stony ground uh whether it just fell by the wayside and was caught away immediately uh fell on the Stony ground the Bible says and they received the word with joy but then When Trials came because of the word amen they left amen then it fell into other places where the cares of Life choked it up and and and did not allow to grow but then it said it also fell into good ground and brought forth some hundredfold some 60 and some 30 amen and he's talking about a condition of a life that it can fall and there's some that the word will come to they they've already made up their mind they're not going to receive it they want nothing to do with it they're in opposition of it like the religious systems when Jesus came they wanted nothing to do with what he offered because what he preached was against their system and but then he said there were other that they received the word and they had great joy in receiving it but they thought that was all that it was but when trials begin to come amen they turned around and they left and the Bible specifically said it was because they had no root in them there was no anchor there but what God does with his his young is he he makes sure that there is an anchor inside of you amen that though everything else is being pushed and and and and the winds are blowing and and everything is coming against you there is something in you that will never let go amen amen and so as a young as a young one it is hard to understand amen because the love of God Amen is is to give us these blessings and to give us wonderful things I I want to read I want to read to you h a couple quotes from the prophet to show you what the spirit said he is doing right now he is a sovereign God by his own counsel he purposed The Plan of Salvation of his own elect which he fornew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully executes the will of the father he is working all things at this moment moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all look around you right now he's in the midst amen how do we know he said so amen he's in the midst of his church this great Creator savior God is Faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great Shepherd of the sheep his very existence is for his own let me just say it again his very existence is for you he loves them he cares for them His Eye Is ever upon them when the word says that your lives are HID with Christ in God it means exactly what it says oh I'm so glad that my God abides faithful say faithful faith he is true to himself he won't lie he's true to his the word he will back it up let me say it again he will back it up why don't you say it he will back it up he's true to us say it he's true to me that's right he is true to me he will lose none of us but he will raises up in the last day I'm glad that I am resting in his faithfulness amen again in the church age book he says Now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God this is his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last day when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this creation this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass do you know amen because he is Sovereign he doesn't have to ask permission of anybody Grace does not have to ask permission of anybody whether it can move in a life amen he does what he wants to do amen no matter what the condition is his grace amen is purposed amen that he will have a bride he will bring to himself create many sons and daughters of God he has promised in this hour he would have daughters and sons adopted sons of God Amen that he would bring and manifest himself in this age praise the Lord amen he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the pleasure good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and his omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his Brethren if he did not make sure all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass you might tell me brother Danny what in the world does this have to do with eagles and an eagle Christian because I want you to know amen the one you're born from we're not talking about animal life or bird life we're talking about God right amen the omnipotent one the omniscient one the the one amen before there was ever an earth before there was ever a universe before there was ever an angel he already had thoughts in his mind he had thoughts about you and about how he would bring you and as we heard this morning what age that you would come in and and he would bring you there and he's delegated to you to bring the word to you amen so that you could recognize why you're here amen there's be some things you don't know why it's happening to you and he will not show you all of his purpose because he wants to demonstrate what faith looks like and and how it will operate if he told you everything you would have no faith but it's your faith that shows everything praise the name of the Lord so an eagle as we read the prophet said is he has to learn to set himself in the wind right amen the scripture amen that was read this morning and last night that they will Mount up with wings now if you study that you find out it is actually like a person getting on a horse how many's ever ridden a horse you just jumped on a horse and hoped it went somewhere you didn't try to control it you just said get it up and off you went and you hoped you would just wind up somewhere in a good place well that's not riding a horse amen amen and it's the same when it's talking about an eagle mounting up is he he takes The Rains of the wind and he he is going to use the wind to go to a certain place an already predetermined place that he's going to go to he's not just randomly floating in the currents amen a young one may as he's learning to fly but the mature Eagle is not randomly floating and letting it beating him around he has learned how to conquer and master amen flying into the heights storms can't stop him when other birds would run from a storm he will wait for the storm and then when the storm comes he will Mount up into it and he's going to do one thing he's going to rise above the cloud to where the sun is still shining I'm talking about an eag e that has learned how to [Applause] fly amen the Bible tells us that the eagle would put his nest in the Cliffs of the rock there reason he do this he's not a vulture he's not a chicken they put their nest on the ground they don't have the care for their young Like an Eagle does for theirs amen when you're on the ground you're susceptible to anything that can come in and get in there but but these eagles they plan carefully the birth of their young all right the birth of their young is not a random event but they've already planned it they build it and they plant it amen I want you to know God has predetermined already he was preparing for you before you even had a desire he was preparing for you then he put a desire in you then he be to draw you because he had already planned it he's planned you amen you may not feel planned and now may be talking to people who've come from all walks of life and I know I know some of your families and some of the things you've come out of and some of the things you've went through I know for some of you amen how the enemy has has destroyed your family family broke up and divorce or whatever more amen but I want you to know amen that may be Earthly fathers and mothers that's not the heavenly [Applause] father amen he he will make his nest high in the Cliff of the rock high above everything they do this because they they want to keep the nest from predators right the eagle has has one natural enemy and that's the serpent all right you you say well what about a crow or what about a hwk them aren't natural enemies they just Peck at them amen you ever seen an eagle flying around there's a little bird going after it how many's ever seen that amen how many's been outside amen they just be you know you see you see these eagles flying around there's a sparrow not a sparrow there's a crow it's usually a crow or black bird behind it you know and there they're chattering and they're diving at it and they're D you know only reason that that it's doing that is because that Eagle's at the same altitude amen now I want to W I want you to watch and I want you I want you to to watch these descriptions is what Moses is writing down because Moses is an eagle right and he knows what it's like he's been trained and he's writing and he and he said that as the eagle stirreth up her nest and FL utth over her young right amen so this Nest amen as I said was pretty determined for the young to be raised in and if youve if you've read about them or studied about them you can find out these nests can weigh up to two two tons can be up to 8 foot high amen and they build them way up in a place amen cuz they're going to raise their young there oh and I love the statement of of these golden eagles that they would they would lay their eggs in the winter time and then the mother would stay on the eggs while the father had to constantly work and feed amen and amen they didn't lay their eggs at the best of the Season amen but they laid them amen as a promise that spring is coming there's going to be a spring there's going to be a birth we're not going to run from the from the weather amen but we're going to bring forth and I want to tell you something else about eagles and I'm talking about you Eagles are are picky eaters Bible talks about it Bible says that said where the carcass is on there will the Eagles be gathered together the word Eagle means a ripper with beak mean they ripping amen the fresh kill amen the uh job wrote down he he said the eagle dwells on high and he and he looks he he sits on his on high in the Rock and he watches for his prey and the young suck the blood they're not looking for some garbage on the road come on church amen you know why because their diet is their source of [Applause] strength well I'm going to preach that a little bit amen you you show up from Camp to camp and you're weaker than the last Camp amen it's not because the camp failed amen but Eagles are picky eaters and they're not random eaters come on they're not like other birds who satisfied with worms and and berries and nuts and everything else amen they want a fresh kill and they're going to kill it and then they're going to take a back and they're going to feed it to their young ones because the fresh kill is the source of their strength amen the prophet of God said it's the fresh kill of the word amen that the Eagles of this age will be eating upon come on church amen if if you're just trying to survive from Camp to camp and you're going back to the same habits eating the same kind of junk that you've been eating in your homes the prophet of God said let me see what you're reading let me go to your home see what you're watching amen see what you're reading see what you're doing I'll tell you what kind of spirit you got amongst you amen but God has has given you a source of strength called the word of God Amen that you can feed on and I want to use the words of the Prophet it is the unfailing body word of the son of man Jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no life in you he's offered his own life Eagles are picky eaters have a picky diet Eagles brother Ron amen they don't sit on a telephone pole and look around and hope something gets hit all right come on when I was studying this I love what they said about the the golden eagle they said he gets ready to eat his meal for the day and he doesn't randomly hes something shows up but he sits and looks and chooses what he's going to eat well I'm going to eat today I'm G to eat fish today tomorrow tomorrow I'm going to eat I'm going to eat uh duck amen and the next day I'm going to eat lamb but he chooses and then he goes and gets it [Applause] he knows what he has needs of he's not just flipping randomly through the word and hoping something pops out he knows what he needs and he goes and finds it in the word and he begins to feed upon it because he knows his diet is his source of strength that's right amen young people you should not be coming all the time and saying I just can't make it I just can't make it God has given you a diet in fact you should start asking him creating me a care for the message you have sent in this hour for the prophet said it has the strength to cause you to Fly Above denominations and to Fly Above the things of the world the amen as our brother was reading this morning about overcoming amen the prophet said it was not important so much what you had to overcome oh we make our situation so much worse than other ages amen but it's not important what you have to overcome it's how you overcome well praise the Lord God has provided his word for you to overcome to eat upon to feed upon to be strong upon be a picky eater amen now when they build their nest they build it in mine for their young man and they build this strong place for the eggs to come and to hatch in and then they begin to line the nest with Fur and Feathers in fact the female will take her own fur out of her breast and she lying the nest with it for when they're born she wants them to be surrounded with herself feel like they're cared for they put skins in there and and and this is funny but I was reading where the male is so excited about the young that are come and they here actually go and bring objects and put them in there cuz he's going to he wants to keep their attention they said they've actually found toys I mean they didn't go to the stor and by them you understand but amen they said they found balls they found a golf ball in the nest they found they didn't play golf but there's something about that object they thought oh maybe this will keep the attention of these young and and because they want the young to be attracted Amen to love the nest to love the comfort of the nest and when they're born they're just laying there and they're surrounded with love in a cushy sheet yeah I mean indeterminant nice sound system nice camp they're surrounded with friends man and they're they're being fed good food and they got good friends they just feel loved and they're they're hearing the mother Eagle screaming and they oh God we love you they're raising their little wings they're praising the Lord job said I will die in my nest and God said no you won't I did not make the nest for you to live in you will never become what I have determined you will become by living in a cushy Place having everything handed to you just going from one good service to another good service amen and staying in a nice Social Circle of friends you're never going to learn to fly that way amen but I'm going to teach you how to fly and you're going to learn how to fly even though fear is your greatest enemy you're going to learn how to fly I'm going to teach you how to take my word and stand upon it hey I I'm like you we love we love the cushy place you're lying if if you don't say you don't like it you love the cushy places you love the Comfort zones I mean we get people hurt and leave the message if their friends leave them we got a lot of nesting syndromes going on Amen people amen if their nest gets Disturbed they get Disturbed but I tell you God loves to disturb your nest in fact one day as a prophet said amen one day that eagle come back and begin to pull out those soft things amen as I was studying the book on these eagles they said the mother one day comes back with a strange look in her eyes she's not this friendly hovering Eagle all the time if you look at that word flutter he flutters over them I want you to go back study what that means it takes it all the way back to the Book of Genesis in the beginning when God Amen would would create and it was said it was a spirit of God hovering over them at the beginning of his creative acts he was hovering over them and even though there was a shaking going on which brought fear and anxiety it was the beginning of something creative is this something amen that these two things can Collide where fear and anxiety can collide with creative power cuz one day Mama comes home and she looks weird she doesn't look happy with her little chicks that have been just so satisfied with the nest and to always be fed thems cuz they've got to learn how to get on yeah yes sir you know when an eagle's born he's ugly do you know that he wasn't born pretty everything's out of proportion got these ugly feet Talent much bigger than everything else it's weird beak raccoon eyes got these feathers that are trying to grow looks like freckles he's weird and that's why amen as it begins to get older the mother would just start blasting them because he knowses are beginning to develop that little stuff that's just hanging on them amen it cannot be used in flying so he's going to blast them with their wings to blast off the little things that they don't need in Flight you know this little this little Eagles laying there in that comfortable nest and he's got these useless claws Talons aren't helping him for anything well he might have learned to say Amen on open up his mouth let the preacher stuff something down God's not satisfied with that so Mama comes back with a strange look at everybody knows brother Tim has preached with a strange look in his eye before let me tell you something right well you know the spirit of God will begin to move you'll think the preacher's mad it's just because of the nest you're used to being comfortable here's your food this is what you need and now roll over on your cushion thank God you're not in India sitting on the floor right Heen just roll over on your cushion you got it nice and everything then one day he like this is not what you're B born for you're born for more so Mama comes and begins to preach against their favorite toys then just pick it up and know they've been playing with that Goin throw it out why you do that I wish now it's gone CU throw all the toys not only that they're sitting down on this nice com and rips the cover out from under them and there what are you doing tell you what she's doing somehow and all their fling around one of those one of those Talons amen rules over and grabs a stick amen amen and they grab it you know because just in that soft condition these things are not being strengthened and they're going to need them to learn how cuz amen it's this and it's this by how they feet and they're going to have to learn how to grab a hold so God begins to take the comfortable things from you and you begin to grab things and this little bird is grabbing something and it's learning how to stand you want to fly but you got to learn how to stand before you fly are you want brother Dan just to feed you something nice sitting your soft chair and God said I'm going to rip everything out from M I'm going to rip out every support and then I want to see what you're going to grab a hold of what is going to be your anchor when I begin to pull things out from under you when you get sick what are you going to grab a hold of when the devil tells you you don't have the Holy Ghost what are you going to grab a hold of when the devil tells you you don't feel like you did a camp what are you going to grab a hold of yeah I'll tell you what I'm going to grab a hold of I'm going to grab a hold of what God has already built he has built this church upon the rock amen and I want to say the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the Revelation that God has given you an eagle an eagle is not destined to live in a soft condition he's going to teach you how to fly he's going to teach you how to grab a hold of something they ripped out all their comfortable thingsall then she comes back again with a a weirder look in her eye and takes that little one me to kick him kick him to the edge God you're not doing that to the other one surely you love me on man if you love me you won't push me like that if you really love me you wouldn't let me get sick if you really love me I'd feel my joy all the time if you really love me I'd feel my victory every day and she steps back and she's only going to get a running [Applause] start she's going to get boom and off they go and they're just twirling through the air amen but you heard about the stick last night God don't you care about [Applause] me how you going to fly if I don't care you out amen just start using those little things amen you were born to fly you're not in my nest because you're a chicken you're in my nest because you're an eagle I want to say something eagle nest never produce chickens yes sir they don't produce Hoppers they produce Flyers people that can mount up when it gets tough kick them out and they cuz this what's going to happen to you here's a man named joob I I want you to go back and read that chapter 29 here's a man named job he said I'm going to die in my Nest I'm going to die surrounded with s cushions I'm rich I'm respected everybody respects me they love me princes get out of my way wouldn't that be great everybody just get out of your way and you know I'm the big guy that's what he's saying in chapter 20 go read it he even said he said he he washes himself in butter how many of you take milk baths this dude's taking milk baths he said the the rocks are bringing forth oil he's Rich he's got his family everything is going right and he said I'm going to die in my nest and God says no you ain't well let me just tell you God and Satan had a conversation about that boy and you know what Satan complained about you made his nest too nice nice you have hedged him about of course he's going to serve you he's going to just go from Camp to Camp serve the Lord have no trials you've given him everything you blessed him he's going everything's going to go good he said but if you take away his nest if you take away his nest I guarantee here curse you well I wonder if maybe a conversation like that has happened about you you let me get them back home you let me get them out of this atmosphere I'll show you what they lean on God said but you know this guy's an eagle and he knows how to fly I'm going to show him how to fly I'm going to show I'm going to show you no matter what he takes from you and you know this is a man that God to uh that God allowed them to take everything but his life took his wealth took his health his children died how many of you would have left by now I'm asking how many of you would have left by now many of you have said well I give up everything's against me but God had said you can't make him curse me you know why you can't curse me cuz you're from me and you may not feel like it but I'm going to prove to the devil that you're the answer to his question on that what you have inside of you will stand the test of the [Applause] age now job did not lose everything in increments over the course of months and years he lost everything in one day you talk about crushing loses family in one day there's the news news comes in and and his businesses have been destroyed or robbed so he's lost his wealth one day and that's bad you know what the Bible said job did things have been stripped from him you know what job did he got down on his knees I'm going to show you how to worship when every cushion is gone and he raised his hands and the Bible said he worshiped God you know if we're in a nesting syndrome and bad things begin to happen let's be honest times we look for somebody to complain to cuz somehow we think the love of God is associated only with his good things but the Bible just says that not that you just would know him in the power of his resurrection many times we stop there but it says also in the fellowship of his suffering do you know for this message to come through to you it came in great suffering and sacrifice it was not an easy thing for this message to come to this point it was not an easy thing for our Lord to go to the cross come on it was not an easy thing it was not an easy thing for every Messenger to come in their age and to bring a message it was great sacrifice great personal sacrifice people left him people hated them and they lost and suffered many things and then we're turn around in this digital age and we're believe some Google Prophet over who's never sacrificed anything they don't even go to church oh you might as well help me amen amen they don't know how to fly they don't know how to soar into the heavenlies but yet they want to tell you this is a false prophet you shouldn't believe what he's [Applause] saying amen but if you sacrifice for something it's worth fighting for I want you to know this message I'm not ashamed amen of this message that our Prophet has SP and spoken because it was not the message of a man it was the message that God sent through a man behold I send you Elijah the prophet amen and he shall turn the hearts of the children amen I want you to know Satan will not be able to stop the Turning of the hearts of a predestinated seed he'll do everything in his power he'll bring storm after storm amen but she will turn you know why God said he would turn [Applause] it I'm living proof of Hearts being turned there's a question in the answerers 1964 brother bams asked a question by my grandmother I have two daughters married to men in denominations received great received opposition what should they do he said hold fast Show Your Colors I don't say don't go around and fellowship but you know a dove can't eat with a buzzard there's that diet again amen I want you to know amen that that little word of advice from a prophet Eagle Show Your Colors don't be ashamed of what's being preached in this hour do you know why because when you make your stand God will make his stand he's just waiting for you to show that you believe what he has said in his word God took a man's heart who hated this message said he didn't want to be there in heaven if brother Brandon was there said we're in a cult said told me don't believe what your mama believes and he took a heart and he turned it until that man would give his life for this gospel I want you to know it pays to stay with the word I am a beneficiary of standing upon the word it came with sacrifice it came with threats to leave the family but I want you to know if it's worth standing for then stay with it no matter how you feel stay with the word amen because if there's an anchor there it will show up in the time of trouble before we get back to job I mean there's something else what an eagle will do when he gets sick and usually he gets sick because he eats something poisonous something he didn't recognize something he shouldn't ate he gets a hold of it becomes sick but he'll do something and what he'll do is he'll go find a place that's inaccessible to anybody else and he spread himself upon a rock and lay in the presence of the son and fix his eyes upon it until Health returns back to his body this is what Eagles do Amen brother Ron you've laid yourself upon that rock and you spread out your wings and you look and you fix your eyes upon the sun and the son says he was wounded for your transgressions and mean just keep your eyes fixed on that because that word is designed by his stripes you are healed the son has designed it amen yes sir you know brother man tells a story about amen a little mechanic down in Florida amen who who was trying to fix a problem in a car and he was tinkering around he tried to do this and tried to do that and tried to fix it and it wouldn't run he couldn't get it fixed he said there was a well-dressed man standing back there watching him and he told that little mechanic said he said if you would just do this this and this he said I believe it'll run so this mechanic went and he done exactly what that well-dressed man said he done this this and that and the thing turned over and it ran and he said say who are you he said he was the chief engineer of the company that produced that car he was the one who designed it and the one who designed it knows how to make it run and you may tinker and try to put things together to try to make it do something but the chief designer is already here and he well dressed rest in the power of his resurrection and he knows how to bring about a Rapture and he's here tonight to produce exactly what he said in his word there is a Rapture there is a people who will fly in the Rapture for he promised you shall not all sleep but you shall be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye he has promised it and there's Eagles here who experience oh praise the name of the Lord Amen brother bam says that mother Eagle is going to be positive that those other those Eagles are not going to be like chickens she does not want them Earthbound their Eagles and she knows their Eagles amen you may not even know it but she knows it the one who brought you forth knows who you are and this is the hour that the word has opened and this is the hour that the lamb comes forth to collect his subjects and he's going to call them from any kind of condition and that condition will not stop them from responding to his calling voice amen he said death can't hold them the sea can't hold them nothing can hold them they could be ashes scattered but he call and their answer and he's calling tonight and his own are answering back Hallelujah isn't he wonderful maybe your nest is becoming a little bit uncomfortable but because he he designed it that way that he's not going to always let you sit in a place amen where you just have to be fed by somebody else but he's going to come bring you to a place where you are going to fly and learn to feed yourself you're going to get what you have need of you're going to reach out and take it amen your hands become strong and learn how to grab hold right and not let go another thing the eagle does every morning that he gets up he will praying himself he's not Vain and looking in a mirror and trying to make himself presentable to everybody else but he's getting ready for the hunt and he will run every feather through his beak and it's like a steam clean system that he runs it through and it'll seal every feather to another brother R says you can't pull them apart with pliers what is he getting ready for amen when he does that he has he has something in his mouth that brings some waterproofing over the feather so he can go in the water and in the air whether it's fish whether it's something flying amen he is adapted to that hunt and then when he gets done printing he will sit and he'll begin to look what do I need every morning it'll take about an hour for him to do it every morning he'll get up and prepare himself for the [Music] day come on every morning he gets up and prepares himself yeah for the hunt he just don't roll out of bed and hope God shows up but God is trained you to be an eagle to learn how to fly in the word of God brother bam said the eagle hunts for it he hunts for that food he's hungry for it nothing else can satisfy him why because he born to eat that kind of food if he's eating something diseased he's not it's not going to work a vultur a vulture loves to to you've seen vultures and Eagles they're two different types of birds you notice that vultures flock together they all circle around it's like a little Social Circle around dead things huh I'm sure they have their they're I better not say it amen amen they all circle around their accounts and they love to eat decomposing [Music] food love to talk about decomposing things but the blood they suck up is all dead rotten disease Maggy they can be intoxicated and drunk on the dead things and it puts them in danger hey I know I was going to church one morning and and and there's some buzzards eating something dead along the side of the road and they wouldn't get out of the way of the car you know I'm driving expecting you know get away and they didn't get away the last second the last Buzzard decided to fly off and flew right in front of my car and I got to be honest I killed a buzzard on the way to church but it was because you wouldn't leave that dead [Applause] thing you stay on that dead [Applause] junk you stay on something dead and think you're going to survive there's something coming down the road that you won't be able to get out of the way of yes sir I'm tell you this is how you treat these kind of things you know I I went out to my my shed one day just a little storage shed and and had had I just kept basically throw it all in there Just Junk I got to be honest had fertilizer and stuff like that in and stuff I never use how many got sheds like that I absolutely use nothing in that shed I mean I used to store Tools in I even took them out and leaned them against the fish I that fence I don't even keep my tools in it absolutely but I went in there one day and and I noticed my shed is is a mess it's stunk the fertilizer bags have been ripped open and I looked and there was droppings everywhere there's a big old fat rat up on the he's trying to I scared him when I jerked open the door and he fell off the shelf and he's like and it made up my mind I'm getting rid of it getting rid of it not going to give it any place to live I don't mean I'm getting rid of the Rat I'm getting rid of the place I didn't get rid of the Rat I just got rid of where he lives hallah hey the Bible says give no place to the devil amen so I paid somebody come out and take the whole out the only thing left there is a piece of ground ain't no rat ain't no rat going to live on my property mess up my place and leave it stink behind ain't no G going to live in my body on this is my place this is what I have paid God has given me I ain't going to let no devil come in and take over you know my neighbor came begin to complain to me said why' you do that I said that rat moved over to my house well at least it ain't it mine amen don't you know God has designed you to fly higher to live farther to eat better amen can you help me tonight God has designed you to eat better than the things the enemy is trying to get you to eat I'm sorry you know some of us young ones we we get all affected brother Gabe if if we got a an Instagram account or a Facebook account and they put a thumbs down on something you say and people get All Shook Up why are you get shook up about that stuff for amen I I hope this is all right brother Tim I had I had a guy start texting me one time amen about 11:30 at night brother Matt 11:39 Saturday night I had to preach in the morning began to text me you know your only reason you're following that man he's a false prophet you're following a Deceiver the only reason you're not admitting it to your church is you don't want to give up the money said man you've been to my house I asked the Lord said Lord do you want me to reply to this man and the Lord told me don't cast your pearls before the swine so I did what any Eagle can do I hit block I wasn't going to argue with him I wasn't going to debate with him I'm not even going to listen to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] him Amen in the nest you hear the word and you're being fed on the word but when you're kicked out of the nest you're being disciplined to the word and you're learning how to use the word [Applause] God designed this word to do exactly what it said that's why our great amen Papa Eagle said only believe amen this is not Jesus plus your thoughts Jesus plus your ability this is Jesus only it was Jesus that died for you it was Jesus that shed his blood it was Jesus who rose again it was Jesus who came back upon the church it's Jesus that's here tonight and it's Jesus that's calling your heart he's the one that I owe everything to he's the one that turned my family he's the one that prepared my Nest he's the one that kicked me out he's the one that teaches me how to fly I think it's amazing that when he's he's hovering over you and he's getting ready to kick you out that's a beginning of a creative act and at the same time there's fear and trembling amen I think it's amazing that when creative power is moving in that we can emotionally be experiencing trembling and fear the enemy wants it wants you to think it's your lack but that's not scripture the believer is constantly being told in the scripture sure fear not fear not it is I Be not Afraid fear not even in the midst of a storm and the disciples are in a boat amen and and it's rocking to and fro and they see him coming and they think it's a spirit and he said it is I be not afraid you're going to learn how to fly in a storm well if that's you you Lord B me come right come you know here's the Lord telling you you can do what I'm doing amen devil told you you can't walk on water but God said I could cuz he said come well how you going to do it I have no idea but I'm just going to step out of the boat amen you know some of you might be afraid you're going to lose a friend if you step out some of you afraid you might have to give something up if you step out amen don't worry about that if there's one calling you just step out put your eyes upon him why because it's a creative act and he's going to do in your life Hallelujah creative Acts the Bible says that he told Moses that I took you I took you I bore you amen and Deuteronomy 32 he said he flutter he taketh them now that word taketh he may take you places you don't like to go amen am this is how he dealt with Israel I took you I seized you while you were in Egypt and I brought you out and I took you away I took you to the Red Sea you remember what their reaction was at the Red Sea fear and trembling you have brought us this far to die have you brought us here to die at the hands of the Egyptians it have been better if we had stayed back there but what did God tell Moses amen you're going to learn how to fly I'm teaching you how to seize the wind right speak to the children of Israel that they go forward forward do you see what's in front of me there's a Red Sea in front of me here's the enemy behind me don't worry about the enemy there's somebody standing between him and you don't worry about him just speak and go forward Moses the eagle took his rod and he stretched it out I don't know how he's going to do it you know what it's not my business to know how he's going to do it it's my business to believe it and when he stretched it out God worked the miracle in some something that they could not see a way through you know God can look where there is no door and he can make a door he can look at a SE where there is no Road and he can make a road he can look at something wet and make it dry that's the God that I serve tonight and he spoke and the eagle took the word and God did the rest I'm the one that took you amen amen if you can only realize children of God Amen that what looks like the end is only the beginning of a creative act yes sir amen God prophesied that in this hour the word is in the bride like it is in Mary he prophesied that in this hour there'd be the same Harmony between the bride that there was between Jesus Christ and the father and that he amen knew what God wanted done with the word amen that's what he's saying about you amen so job has said I I was in my nest and he kicked me out and I've lost everything he did not only lose his wealth he did not only lose his family that was only the first chapter but then the second chapter it says the devil came back to God again he said you let me touch his health skin for skin what will man give for his life God says you can touch his health but don't take his life and he got so sick amen till finally his wife looked at him and says you're incurable you're incurable you can't be healed you know what job said I'm not advising you husbands to say it like this but he says you talk like a foolish woman the Bible says in all of this job sinned not he didn't understand what was happening but God Amen had kicked him out of a comfortable nest and was going to be bring something greater to him than what his wealth was and all the riches and Prestige that he had God was going to bring some something greater to him that could be effective all the way down to this night and that is going to be a revelation that there is a redeemer that lives oh I love how God treats his Eagles because even when his inspiration was taken away brother Bram said that's what worried job was his inspiration was taken from him and he didn't know why it was happening and he began to complain you know it's better that I died and in this chapter 29 where he's saying I I thought I would die in my Nest I had everything good I wish I could go back to that kind of time you know what God Said I love I love the way God deals with eagles he come in and he said job stand up Sir you think you know he might have gave him some a little bit more loving kindness than that but he said job stand up and G yourself like a man I want to talk to you a little bit I'm going to talk about something you said you don't know why you were born you said you wish you had died at Birth you said it' be better if I go back to those good days of living and just stay that way but I want to ask you a question job where were you answer me where were you amen when the sons of God shouted together and the morning Stars sang with joy where are you at I going to talk to you about where you came from amen that what's happening now will not stop what I'm trying to bring you oh yes he's pressing through tonight amen I am going to tell you who you came from I'm going to tell you where you're going stand up and guard yourself like a man man now if job was just in a nesting syndrome and just used to all the Comfort he would have complained and said you know know I should you shouldn't talk to me like that I'm going to leave you all righten this message is too hard I'm going to leave you it preached mean to me amen can you imagine I I put in a prayer request all all my kids have died and I put a prayer request in I've lost all my businesses brother Matt I put a prayer request in that I have an incurable disease and the Pastor said says be a man my God where's the sympathy around here be a man man can't stand what's happening here but God had already said I can promise you nothing you do to them is going to take out of them what I have put inside of them I want you to know young people God put a deposit on the inside of you that hell cannot take out of you death can't take it out of you sickness can't take it out of you the loss of your job can't take it out of you your friends leaving you can't take it out of you what did job say though God slay me do we have some job's in the room though God slay me I'm going to trust him anyhow what did God do down come the Revelation I know know my redeemer liveth I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God oh Lord no matter what happens to this body I know that I'll meet him I know that I see him let me turn your view come on just a minute let's go down into a dark basement and in this basement is a man and he's standing by a little bed and that bed is a little baby dying right suffering so hard that his eyes are crossed flies of land it on his body underneath the net this man was suffering his wife had just died his daddy had died not too long before that a sinner his church was dwindling he'd lost his brother not too long before that and he put his hands over this baby he said God don't let my little baby die and a black sheet fell down in front of him and he knew God had refused him God never even said no he just didn't talk to him right go this man had preached Divine Healing this man had baptized people in the name of Jesus Christ this man had preached and people had been healed delivered but now God had refused his prayer he said when that black sheep fell Satan moved up CU When God don't answer prayer that old crow goes to yapping you know if God really loved you he'd make it comfortable for you he'd just pay off all your bills he'd let you take butter baths he'd give you everything you want he's going to show you what a Victorious Christian looks like he likes to tell you lies you know the prophet said the devil moved up when God refused my prayer said after all you've done for him and now he won't listen to you you've prayed and God has answered prayer for others now you're praying for your own God won't listen why don't you leave him why don't you leave him you know brother brandom said I open my mouth to say if that's the way God's going to be I'll no longer serve him I want to tell you something the message of Malachi 4 hung in the balance on the decision of a man who said I'm no longer going to serve him he said I open my mouth to say I won't serve him anymore in that strong dark time couldn't feel God on he said but when I open my mouth on it needs to be real quiet right now when I open my mouth to say I'll no longer serve him something and I'm asking you do you have that something way down on the inside moved up and when I opened my mouth say I'm quitting instead I said William brandom who are you anyhow the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord it was one man testimony thousands of years ago amen because he was an eagle and never gave in to the winds and the storms of his time that said give up job you're not going to make it job but he stood up and had a revelation My Redeemer liveth that seed Cried Out amen and there's came a man 2,000 years ago exactly like job prophesied there would be a redeemer come and death would not hold him the darkest condition Jesus did not walk up to Calvary and joy he walked up without the spirit of God on him he walked up alone crying out amen but God looked upon that body and he saw you in him amen and Jesus refused to give in to what the devil asked him to do just give in amen you can have a few more years of a good life give in and live that way but he refused to do it in his trial he opened on his mouth he was beaten he was abused and he went up as a man to die alone he died alone cuz he knows what loneliness feels like he did not die like a buzzard he did not die like a chicken he died Like an Eagle remembering what David said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption and he kept his eyes and his focus on that though he no longer felt God Amen when he was on the cross being mocked he cried out my God why have you forsaken me right he knows what it's like to feel alone so that you could feel him amen he knows what it's like to fall he knows what it's like to feel alone but you don't have to be alone anymore amen and when he died and he was buried but on the third day he rose again amen he rose again he was a rumor at first but then he became a reality don't let him be a rumor let him be a reality tonight amen it's a real thing this message is not a rumor it's a real thing you have not followed cly devised fables this is the sure word of Prophecy and because that man Rose there stood a prophet and opened his mouth he said that anchor inside of me moved up who are you anyhow William brandham amen brother brandham said it proved there was something inside of me can I read it to you amen this is the hour of proving brother and sister where God is proving amen that what is inside of you nothing can take out of you amen amen here amen here he said that amen that uh he said that I looked back and I thought how did I get on Earth I came from a bunch of drunkers how did I get here who gave me life who gave me that wife who gave me that baby where did they come from where did my life come from and I said though he slay me yet I'll trust him what he said is already been said and it's still inspired and I said get away from me Satan and I laid my hand on the baby and I said Sharon honey I'll lay you on your mother's arms in a few minutes when the angels of God come to take you away but one day daddy will see you again what is this this is not an eagle in the nest this is an eagle out of the nest this is an eagle learning how to fly in the midst of a storm and putting his eyes upon the sun yes sir I want to tell you just something else do you know why he was in that condition he was in that condition because he refused to go preach for the Pentecostal church he listened to someone else who criticized him which was his mother-in-law he allowed a relationship to stop him from going over over there to preach that gospel to them why because the seed had to move it had to come to a place where you could hear the word you know I am preaching this message tonight because this man amen sacrificed his life for this message do do we hold that as something precious amen and he and then he done that amen and then he said uh he said the word of God shall never fail say that with me never fail what is your situation tonight the word shall never fail it'll Triumph no matter what it is then I knowed there was something inside of all reasonings something inside of all emotions and everything else there was an inside man that held in that hour and nothing else could have done it every reason everything that could be showed everything that could prove it was wrong and I was in the wrong but the word of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world held on the inside right do you know what he said I fell but he held me I want you to know you have a god tonight amen and that same God Amen that held that man is the same God it's here in this hour now let me turn your attention to another room amen we're not in a basement anymore now we're in a doctor's room amen the doctors looked at you and said there's cancer and there's there's no hope and maybe the doctor has said something over your life amen but I want you to know the same God right that held them in that hour is the same God that promised to hold you in this hour I don't have a God that kick K me out of the nest to leave me but when he kicks me out he flies around me and he'll catch me and he'll bring me up again and he'll drop me again and he's only teaching me to strengthen what I already have because I will fly like he [Applause] flies Jesus Christ Our Father God is not the devil who will take your life suck you dry leave you alongside the road begging amen take everything from you destroy your family and then laugh at you but my God Amen then you know what I've seen the devil do he's taken our young people and he's pulled them out into the world and brought them down into the pits amen we got them out there now in all kinds of Lifestyles lesbians drug addicts used to sit in Camp my God Amen never forgot about them and he's still circling around them the devil gave up on them a long time ago said nobody will use them again but here comes my God he said I have not forgot one of my own not only that I will not lose one of my own and he'll fly over them and the power of those wings and the power of that voice and the power of that message I'm telling you a testimony let me tell you I hope this is all right I don't want to to be too dark for you but I I know of a case where a man a married man of course we hear brother bham talk about it when we talked about that soldier boy who was a married man and who was out committing homosexual acts and and God called him out said you're not going to commit suicide Soldier Boy The Devil's lying to you you just have a phobia renounce the devil I know of a case amen where another married man was was doing the same thing with a denominational man and living a homosexual lifestyle both of these men men were married men they tried everything they could do to stop it they went to counseling they went amen tried to get help and they they wanted to quit nothing and and the thing just kept driving them one day amen that boy called his pastor and he was complaining to him he said pastor nobody knows what it like what it's like he says you don't know what it's like Pastor open his mouth says you're right I I don't know what it's like like he said but I felt a tap on my shoulder and the Holy Spirit whispered to me tell him tell him I know tell him I know cuz the Holy Spirit knows he was tempted in every Point yet without sin what the devil wants to do to you is he wants to drive you into a place and leave you in hopelessness and think nobody loves you nobody cares for you nobody understands you and that your way out is hopeless there's nothing there's no way of Escape for you but the Holy Spirit told that Pastor tell him I know he said when I told that man the Holy Spirit told me to tell you I know he said the phone went silent and the man be to weep and he said and he was delivered now that's the God I know that's the god that don't give up that man came back and repented before the church and told the church I I spent hours in counseling nothing could stop it but when the Holy Spirit said I know it broke the chain I want you to know Satan does not hold the key to your life he has lost the key he cannot get it back amen it is God that holds your destiny and God has destined you to receive the Holy Ghost God has
