[22:46] Heavenly Father Lord just as the song
[22:48] that we were singing says
[22:50] Lord we've been blessed so much blessed
[22:52] beyond measure blessed beyond what our
[22:54] words could could ever express to you
[22:57] Lord but Lord just for this moment we
[22:59] just want to stop today and say thank
[23:01] you Lord that we recognize how blessed
[23:04] we are Lord we we look around and and
[23:06] we're not like laodicea that would say
[23:08] I'm rich and increase with goods and
[23:10] have need of nothing but Lord I I
[23:12] recognize that everything I have is
[23:14] because of you I recognize your goodness
[23:16] and and I say Lord I need you more today
[23:18] than I've Ever Needed You Lord I I need
[23:20] your presence in my life I need your
[23:23] grace I need your mercy and Lord we need
[23:25] your healing Lord I'm just so thankful
[23:27] to know that that you're still on the
[23:29] throne Lord and that you're still
[23:30] healing and saving and drawing and Lord
[23:33] you promised you'd never leave or
[23:34] forsake us and even though it's dark and
[23:36] and Lord we live in an evil time more
[23:38] evil time than ever before we can truly
[23:41] say that you have never left us fighting
[23:43] alone but Lord you've been there every
[23:45] step of the way and we just want to say
[23:46] thank you we love you and we're so
[23:49] appreciative of it Lord and and we know
[23:51] you'll not leave us Lord we know that
[23:53] even today as we've gathered together to
[23:55] worship Lord that you are in our midst
[23:57] and you're amongst us and you've come
[23:58] Lord Lord to speak to hearts Lord to
[24:01] meet every need and I just pray today
[24:03] that each and every one that's gathered
[24:05] here Lord would would begin to push
[24:07] aside the the tiredness and push aside
[24:09] the busyness of the week and and maybe
[24:11] what they have to do next week Lord and
[24:14] begin to enter in with their whole heart
[24:15] recognizing that the King of Kings
[24:17] promised to be here and Lord we know you
[24:19] keep your word and you go where you're
[24:21] invited so we're inviting you now to
[24:24] come and speak and move father Lord
[24:26] knowing that no man could come and
[24:28] deliver a word that would speak to every
[24:30] heart but when the Holy Ghost comes and
[24:32] when the anointing comes and takes that
[24:34] bread of life and begins to divide it
[24:36] then every need supplied father and we
[24:39] thank you for that Lord we look forward
[24:41] with great anticipation Lord to what
[24:43] you're going to do today and what you're
[24:45] going to speak to us and Lord we come
[24:47] before you Lord we're having many
[24:48] petitions Lord of of sick amongst us and

[25:03] Stripes Lord and none of this has caught
[25:04] you off guard Lord today there's those
[25:07] battling cancer brother Ross and brother
[25:09] Ron Lord and sister Erica and you've
[25:12] kept them this far and we know Lord Lord
[25:14] looking back through time even what the
[25:16] you told the prophet that we didn't have
[25:18] to fear cancer Lord and then seeing you
[25:20] back that up time and time again and the
[25:22] deliverances that you have brought we're
[25:24] expecting it once again father Lord
[25:26] we're just lifting up especially sister
[25:28] Erica this week Lord and and weakness in
[25:31] her body but strong in her Faith Lord
[25:33] Lord and we just want to combine our
[25:36] faith with hers and curse that demon of
[25:38] hell that has come against her that has
[25:40] tried to take her life and we rebuke it
[25:42] in the name of Jesus and we look now
[25:45] Lord to the promise it says by your
[25:47] stripes we are healed and we speak it
[25:49] Lord because we are Believers Lord and I
[25:52] believe Lord as your Prophet said that
[25:53] the word has never failed when put on
[25:56] the mouth of believing men and women and
[25:58] we stand in faith today believing for
[26:00] the miraculous Lord for every request
[26:03] that was read across the death every
[26:05] sickness Lord today we look to Calvary
[26:07] Lord we look to the stripes you took and
[26:09] we believe for a healing for each one of
[26:11] those needs father we just ask now that
[26:14] you'll have your way in this service
[26:15] Lord that your spirit would be able to
[26:17] move freely that there'll be no
[26:19] hindrance to hearing amongst your people
[26:20] Lord As We Lay aside every thought every
[26:23] doubt every fear and every anxiety and
[26:25] we just enter in with our whole heart
[26:27] father I pray you'll just pour out your
[26:29] spirit this morning in Jesus name we

[1:00:35] to direct people in the things of God
[1:00:38] God bless you
[1:00:40] amen let's turn to Genesis Chapter 18
[1:00:43] and verse 10.
[1:00:46] appreciate you all this morning
[1:00:51] Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 10.
[1:00:56] I'm going to be speaking today on the
[1:00:57] Great Commission
[1:00:59] and rapturing faith
[1:01:03] we're going to look here at this verse
[1:01:06] in verse 10. and we see here the son of
[1:01:10] man is speaking
[1:01:12] why do we call him the son of man
[1:01:16] it literally means man of dust
[1:01:20] and it's where God had come and walked
[1:01:24] among men Gathering From the 16 elements
[1:01:27] made himself a body and stepped into it
[1:01:31] along with two angels
[1:01:33] and they come and visit Sarah and
[1:01:36] Abraham and it will be it will be a
[1:01:40] foreshadowing of one day where God will
[1:01:43] wrap himself in 16 elements in a virgin
[1:01:46] womb and be born a baby
[1:01:49] but in this instance it's not time for
[1:01:52] him to come that way
[1:01:54] but he comes and makes an appearing to
[1:01:57] Abraham to to write a prophecy for the
[1:02:00] last day
[1:02:01] it's more than a historical event is a
[1:02:04] prophecy that God is speaking
[1:02:06] and he wants you to understand that God
[1:02:09] will again Tabernacle human flesh in the
[1:02:12] last day
[1:02:13] and that we will see the ministry of
[1:02:15] Christ and the ministry Apostles as it's
[1:02:18] manifested in the ministry of the son of
[1:02:20] man
[1:02:22] Christ in Bride form
[1:02:26] so here we see the son of man God is
[1:02:29] manifested in human flesh appears to
[1:02:31] Sarah for a commission
[1:02:35] and he commissions her to bring forth
[1:02:38] the promised son
[1:02:39] so I want you to catch this it's a
[1:02:41] commission
[1:02:43] to bring forth the promised son
[1:02:46] Genesis 18 verse 10 and he said I will
[1:02:49] certainly return unto thee according to
[1:02:51] the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife
[1:02:53] shall have a son and Sarah heard it in
[1:02:56] the tent door which was behind him God
[1:02:59] bless you you can be seated
[1:03:03] I'm also going to read some words from
[1:03:06] the scripture here if you'll be turning
[1:03:08] over to Marks chapter 16.
[1:03:11] because when the son of man manifests
[1:03:13] himself in human flesh as we spoke about
[1:03:17] come in as Jesus Christ
[1:03:20] and he has walked now upon the Earth for
[1:03:22] 33 years
[1:03:24] and he is about to conclude his visit to
[1:03:28] the Earth
[1:03:29] that he has done in human flesh
[1:03:33] so here the ministry of Christ in in
[1:03:37] Jesus is now coming to its end as far as
[1:03:41] this Earthly mission
[1:03:43] and he appears to his disciples to give
[1:03:47] them the commission
[1:03:49] and so again we have again another
[1:03:53] appearance of Christ he has died buried
[1:03:56] rose again and now in his appearing he
[1:04:00] comes and appears to his disciples to
[1:04:03] give them the last words before he
[1:04:06] leaves
[1:04:08] and so he says in Mark 16 verse 14
[1:04:12] afterwards he appeared unto the eleven
[1:04:14] as they said it made and embraded them
[1:04:17] with their unbelief and Hardness of
[1:04:20] Heart which is what he does with Sarah
[1:04:22] saying is there anything too hard for
[1:04:24] the Lord
[1:04:25] because they believe not them which had
[1:04:27] seen him as after he had risen
[1:04:30] and he said unto them go into all the
[1:04:33] world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:04:35] Creature he that believeth and is
[1:04:38] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:04:40] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:04:43] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:04:45] in my name shall they cast out Devils
[1:04:48] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:04:51] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[1:04:54] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[1:04:56] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:04:59] they shall recover so then after the
[1:05:02] Lord had spoken to them he was received
[1:05:05] up into heaven I'm reading this so
[1:05:07] you'll know these are the last words as
[1:05:10] he gives the commission
[1:05:11] and he's and he was received up into
[1:05:14] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[1:05:16] and they went forth and preached
[1:05:19] everywhere the Lord working with them
[1:05:21] confirming the words with sign following
[1:05:25] now
[1:05:26] every one of them like whether it be the
[1:05:30] Mark here or whether it be the Book of
[1:05:34] Luke or the book of Acts that we're
[1:05:35] going to write read from this morning
[1:05:37] speaks about these last words of Jesus
[1:05:42] now in um in Luke chapter 24 and 49 he
[1:05:48] will tell them behold I send the promise
[1:05:51] of my father upon you but you tarry in
[1:05:53] the city of Jerusalem until you're
[1:05:56] endued with power from on high so you
[1:05:58] know there was there's a little more to
[1:06:00] it than just go and preach
[1:06:03] but I want you to wait until you're
[1:06:05] endued with powerful High because
[1:06:07] there's going to come an outpouring of
[1:06:10] the spirit that will happen on the day
[1:06:12] of Pentecost now then go to with me to
[1:06:15] chapter acts Acts chapter 1 rather verse
[1:06:18] 3 and it talks about him raising from
[1:06:22] the dead to whom all see also he showed
[1:06:26] himself alive after his passion or after
[1:06:30] his death or suffering I have by many
[1:06:33] infallible proofs being seen within 40
[1:06:36] days and speaking of the things
[1:06:38] pertaining to the kingdom of God and
[1:06:41] being assembled together with them
[1:06:43] commanded them that they should not
[1:06:46] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[1:06:48] promise of the Father which he saith
[1:06:51] you have heard of me then verse 8 but
[1:06:55] you shall receive power after the Holy
[1:06:57] Ghost has come upon you and you shall be
[1:07:00] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[1:07:03] in Judea and Samaria and the outermost
[1:07:06] parts of the Earth
[1:07:08] and so then we want to turn to Acts
[1:07:10] chapter 2 and verse 1 because it is here
[1:07:13] that the disciples are empowered to
[1:07:16] fulfill the Great Commission notice they
[1:07:19] can't just go out and fulfill the
[1:07:21] commission they have to be empowered
[1:07:24] same way with Sarah she just can't go
[1:07:26] and bring forth the promised son but I
[1:07:28] will return to thee according to the
[1:07:30] time of life
[1:07:32] so it would be the the
[1:07:34] overshadowing or the the power of the
[1:07:37] most high that will bring this to power
[1:07:39] so verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost
[1:07:42] was fully come they were all with one
[1:07:45] Accord in one place and suddenly there
[1:07:49] came a sound from Heaven as of a Russian
[1:07:52] Mighty Wind and it filled the house
[1:07:53] where they were sitting and there
[1:07:56] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[1:07:58] as of fire and it's set upon each of
[1:08:01] them and they were filled with the Holy
[1:08:04] Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:08:07] tongues or other languages as the spirit
[1:08:10] gave them utterance and there were
[1:08:13] dwelling in Jerusalem Jews devout men
[1:08:16] out of every nation under heaven and
[1:08:19] when this was noised abroad the
[1:08:21] multitude came together and were
[1:08:23] confounded because that every man heard
[1:08:27] them speak in his own language and they
[1:08:31] were all amazed and marveled saying one
[1:08:34] to another behold are not all Deeds
[1:08:37] which speak galileans and how here we
[1:08:40] ever man in our own tongue wherein we
[1:08:44] were born parthians and medes and
[1:08:46] eliomites and dwellers in Mesopotamia
[1:08:49] and Judea and Cappadocia and pontus and
[1:08:53] Asian pyria and pampaia in Egypt and in
[1:08:57] parts of Libya around about Serene and
[1:09:00] and strangers of Rome and Jews and
[1:09:02] proselytes and crets and Arabians we do
[1:09:05] hear them speak and our language or in
[1:09:09] our tongues the wonderful works of God
[1:09:13] and they were all amazed and were in
[1:09:15] doubt saying to one another what meaneth
[1:09:18] this and others mocking said these are
[1:09:23] full of new wines stop there just for a
[1:09:25] minute judgment will come upon the Jews
[1:09:29] because of mocking the come of the Holy
[1:09:33] Spirit
[1:09:34] and as they do they will be carried and
[1:09:37] captive and dispersed throughout all
[1:09:39] nations and and they will be cut off
[1:09:41] from mocking the Holy Ghost
[1:09:44] remember because they rejected that they
[1:09:48] are dispersed so it will happen with the
[1:09:51] Gentiles
[1:09:52] as a laodicean church puts Christ on the
[1:09:57] outside of the church
[1:10:00] and in doing it they will they will be
[1:10:02] there because they have mocked
[1:10:05] the Holy Spirit
[1:10:07] because they have rejected his voice
[1:10:11] notice again
[1:10:13] um Peter standing up with the 11 lifted
[1:10:16] up his voice and said unto them you men
[1:10:18] of Judea and all that dwell in Jerusalem
[1:10:21] be this known unto you and hearken to my
[1:10:24] words for these are not drunken as you
[1:10:27] suppose seeing is but the third hour of
[1:10:29] the day but this is that which was
[1:10:32] spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall
[1:10:36] come to pass in the last days saith God
[1:10:38] I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:10:42] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:10:44] prophesy and your young men shall see
[1:10:47] vision and your old men shall dream
[1:10:48] dreams and on my servants and on my
[1:10:51] handmaids I will pour out in those days
[1:10:54] of my spirit and they shall prophesy and
[1:10:58] I will show wonders in the heavens above
[1:11:01] and signs in the earth beneath blood and
[1:11:05] fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be
[1:11:09] turned into darkness and the moon into
[1:11:11] the blood before that great and notable
[1:11:14] day of the Lord come and it shall come
[1:11:16] to pass that whosoever shall call on the
[1:11:19] name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:11:22] so now as we have looked at these
[1:11:25] scriptures together this morning to lay
[1:11:29] a foundation for what we are going to be
[1:11:31] speaking on of of the Great Commission
[1:11:35] and Rapture and faith we we know that of
[1:11:39] course we're at the end time
[1:11:42] and what we saw back in the prophecy of
[1:11:46] Sarah and Abraham and also in the
[1:11:49] prophecy that lays there
[1:11:52] um of what Jesus spoke to the Disciples
[1:11:55] of as as told them there was a Great
[1:11:58] Commission that the coming of the son of
[1:12:01] man Christ to Sarah was to fulfill the
[1:12:05] Great Commission that was given to
[1:12:07] Abraham which had not been done
[1:12:12] the bonds woman child did not fulfill it
[1:12:15] nor could he
[1:12:18] you see neither has all of these
[1:12:20] denominations today fulfilled the Great
[1:12:24] Commission and the promised son which
[1:12:26] comes at the end this has not come now
[1:12:31] as we are looking at this um Genesis 4
[1:12:34] 15 verse 4 I want you to look at the
[1:12:37] original commission that was given to
[1:12:39] Abraham behold the word the Lord came
[1:12:41] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[1:12:44] air but he that come out of thy bowels
[1:12:48] shall be thine air by the way he is
[1:12:50] speaking directly of Eliezer
[1:12:53] the eldest servant in his house
[1:12:56] and he is saying of him he will not be
[1:12:58] the heir
[1:13:00] but there's one coming out of your own
[1:13:02] bowels that will be your heir
[1:13:04] now I just want you to understand uh yes
[1:13:08] brother Branham airs with us as a part
[1:13:10] of the Bride
[1:13:11] but understand he is not the heir the
[1:13:15] air is the bride of Christ
[1:13:18] so watch what he said you know because
[1:13:20] he has said I'm going childless and the
[1:13:22] one one that's not even out of my own
[1:13:24] bowels is my Heir my servant the eldest
[1:13:27] servant and he said and he and then God
[1:13:30] brought him forth and he said abroad and
[1:13:32] said look now toward the heavens and
[1:13:34] tell the stars that thou be able to see
[1:13:36] them or number them and he said unto
[1:13:39] them so shall thy seed be and he
[1:13:42] believed in the Lord and he counted it
[1:13:44] to him for righteousness so this was a
[1:13:48] commission to Abraham and now was being
[1:13:52] reconfirmed to Sarah
[1:13:55] and of course now she is to finish
[1:13:59] Abraham's Commission
[1:14:01] amen and we are now to fulfill and
[1:14:05] finish the Great Commission for we for
[1:14:09] when we find the last seed somebody help
[1:14:13] me now and when we find the last seed
[1:14:16] and they too become a witness of the
[1:14:19] power of the Holy Ghost it is then Jesus
[1:14:22] the promised son will come
[1:14:25] now if you look with me to Matthew 24
[1:14:28] verse 14 Jesus said this Gospel of the
[1:14:32] Kingdom shall be preached into all the
[1:14:34] world for witness and All Nations and
[1:14:38] then shall the End come stop right there
[1:14:40] brother Branham is insistent all the way
[1:14:43] to the end of his ministry that this has
[1:14:47] not been fulfilled
[1:14:51] that means it has to be fulfilled for
[1:14:55] the end to come how many wants him to
[1:14:56] come how many wants to Rapture of the
[1:14:58] church how many wants to dead in Christ
[1:15:00] to rise then what do we we find that the
[1:15:04] gospel must be preached and to all the
[1:15:07] world for a witness to All Nations and
[1:15:10] then shall the End come now last Sunday
[1:15:14] we showed how the Great Commission must
[1:15:18] be fulfilled because now the seals is
[1:15:22] open so the word has been revealed the
[1:15:25] book has been opened that which was
[1:15:28] opened to Paul Mysteries that were
[1:15:31] understood in the first days have now
[1:15:34] been revealed or uncovered rather
[1:15:38] unveiled again to take took the heaping
[1:15:41] of stones and uh off of
[1:15:44] denominationalism awful lost truth and
[1:15:47] now it has been revealed back to the
[1:15:49] church again
[1:15:51] now so again so now only now
[1:15:55] listen Wesley couldn't do it
[1:16:01] Luther couldn't do it
[1:16:04] Azusa Street couldn't do it
[1:16:07] they could not take the gospel to the
[1:16:10] world it had not been restored
[1:16:16] I'm trying to say something
[1:16:18] that means the burden lays on us
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:24] not just in word but in power
[1:16:27] understand it's not the gospel until it
[1:16:30] comes in power
[1:16:32] signs have to follow them that believe
[1:16:35] now so brother Branham tells us in the
[1:16:38] invisible Union again this is one of the
[1:16:40] last things imparted to the church he
[1:16:42] tells brother Jack Moore I I'm going to
[1:16:45] preach a message to my followers the
[1:16:47] people who believe me
[1:16:49] I'm going to preach this to them you
[1:16:51] know pardon me you know for stepping
[1:16:54] into your pulpit and doing it but you've
[1:16:55] given me a lot of Liberty and I'm taking
[1:16:57] Liberty now to preach a sermon to my
[1:17:00] people
[1:17:01] and he said we know the modern Church in
[1:17:04] his present condition and his present
[1:17:06] state is in no condition condition to
[1:17:10] finish up the Great Commission that God
[1:17:13] gave the church for this day how many
[1:17:15] Pentecostals can say Amen to that so
[1:17:18] right we are wanting us to this that
[1:17:20] fight this afraid to face the word right
[1:17:23] down to the test they know you can tell
[1:17:25] them about it and I can't help it I
[1:17:27] can't believe that I don't care what he
[1:17:29] does in other words no matter what kind
[1:17:31] of Miracles what kind of discernment
[1:17:33] what kind of vindication I don't care
[1:17:35] what he does you see it shows what Mommy
[1:17:37] and Papa you have you might be a state
[1:17:40] president or someday you might be dissed
[1:17:42] out of the other you know that that's
[1:17:44] what's held out is the carrot you can be
[1:17:46] a great man in our organization but he
[1:17:49] said you better be a son of God
[1:17:52] then he said in closing and saying this
[1:17:54] finish up the Great Commission how could
[1:17:58] they do it we know they're dead
[1:18:02] he said God let it die in this
[1:18:05] scientific age all of it so he can open
[1:18:08] up the seven seal mystery to the
[1:18:11] undenominational bride how can a
[1:18:14] denomination accept those Seven Seals
[1:18:17] which is absolutely contrary a serpent
[1:18:20] seed and all these other things a whole
[1:18:22] false seven Mysteries is contrary to
[1:18:25] what they've been taught because it took
[1:18:27] the old school from the bible school and
[1:18:30] the Seven Seals of God when it was
[1:18:32] opened there on the mountain no let me
[1:18:35] let God know let me die right now at
[1:18:39] this Pulpit if that ain't the truth I've
[1:18:42] foretold you a year and six months
[1:18:44] before it happened and he told me go to
[1:18:46] Arizona and what would happen out there
[1:18:49] in the desert and there's men sitting
[1:18:51] here tonight was was standing right
[1:18:53] there and present when the seven angels
[1:18:55] came down and the Life Magazine packed
[1:18:58] the article of it right it's right there
[1:19:00] in their Observatory everything and they
[1:19:03] don't even know what it's about and
[1:19:05] everything even to the destruction of
[1:19:07] California coming up now and all these
[1:19:10] other things and how I told him how many
[1:19:13] days it would be and how it would be
[1:19:15] were this great big earthquake happened
[1:19:18] in Alaska that was March 27 1964. how
[1:19:21] would be the beginning of the sign of
[1:19:23] time and what would take place and just
[1:19:25] word by word what it said and it's never
[1:19:28] failed one time you've never seen it
[1:19:31] fail because and it can't fail because
[1:19:34] it's God's words and Heaven and Earth
[1:19:37] will pass away but it can't fail
[1:19:40] that's right
[1:19:45] so again in the next service he comes
[1:19:49] along and I'm going to read it too where
[1:19:52] he says it'll take Mark 16 to call a
[1:19:56] bride out
[1:19:58] for you cannot let me just
[1:20:01] emphasize some things you cannot be the
[1:20:04] bride of Christ
[1:20:06] without fulfilling the Great Commission
[1:20:12] now that's the only way Sarah can be
[1:20:15] mother of the promised seed was
[1:20:17] fulfilled the Great Commission given to
[1:20:21] Abraham and the only way we can be the
[1:20:25] Bride of Jesus Christ completed by the
[1:20:28] marriage of the Lamb is by fulfilling
[1:20:31] the Great Commission
[1:20:34] again this is I have heard and now I see
[1:20:37] and brother Brandon said everybody knows
[1:20:38] we have a promise of the church
[1:20:41] condition in the last day the church in
[1:20:44] its present condition can never fulfill
[1:20:46] the Commandments of God the Great
[1:20:48] Commission could never call the bride
[1:20:51] out which one would do it uh the
[1:20:55] Pentecostals I should say not not one
[1:20:58] none of the rest of them that's the shut
[1:21:00] that's on the wheat that come out and
[1:21:02] look just exactly like the wheat but
[1:21:04] there's no wheat to it it opens up but
[1:21:06] the grain comes out of that they
[1:21:08] organize they kill themselves that's
[1:21:10] where they died they are stalks but the
[1:21:12] wheat has to come up through that from
[1:21:14] through there and now it's beginning to
[1:21:17] form in the bride form the corn of wheat
[1:21:19] that fell into the ground to the Dark
[1:21:22] Ages it had to die
[1:21:25] so you see it's the undenominational
[1:21:27] bride who the seals have been revealed
[1:21:30] to
[1:21:32] and they are the ones to fulfill the
[1:21:36] Great Commission
[1:21:37] that's who I'm speaking to this morning
[1:21:39] the people of the book
[1:21:43] must fulfill the commission to take the
[1:21:46] land
[1:21:47] that belongs to the book
[1:21:50] every promise of God are you with me now
[1:21:54] so this commission returns her to the
[1:21:58] bride age to do this Sarah has to come
[1:22:01] become pregnant and and so must the
[1:22:04] bride
[1:22:07] is that right
[1:22:08] amen there there has to be a message
[1:22:11] that comes that starts to change within
[1:22:14] Sarah
[1:22:15] and so must it be with the bride she
[1:22:18] must actually become pregnant
[1:22:22] with the word
[1:22:25] what's now in Christ the mystery brother
[1:22:28] Brandon said remember now we are now as
[1:22:30] is bride impregnated with the spirit
[1:22:34] oh my the church bearing his children
[1:22:36] see pregnated by his spirit with his
[1:22:39] name bearing his name bearing his life
[1:22:42] bearing forth the signs of his life
[1:22:44] evidence with Eminence evidence of the
[1:22:46] resurrection showing he's not dead
[1:22:50] but He's Alive forevermore this is
[1:22:53] eternal life and Vindicated vindicates
[1:22:55] to the world that we are alive in him
[1:22:58] so you see the bride must be pregnant
[1:23:01] with the word and if it's a child of the
[1:23:04] word
[1:23:05] it'll be on Mark 16. Come speaking Acts
[1:23:10] 2 38 young and come on because that's
[1:23:14] the only kind the word can bring forth
[1:23:17] the child of the word must look and act
[1:23:21] like the second Adam
[1:23:27] now the coming of the message to Sarah
[1:23:30] was to fulfill the Great Commission of
[1:23:33] the promised son
[1:23:35] and it and and again you know that Great
[1:23:40] Commission returns to her it returns her
[1:23:43] to make her the bride she was when
[1:23:47] Abraham first married her
[1:23:51] that old woman I want you to think of
[1:23:54] this
[1:23:55] changed to be young again
[1:24:00] Im so much that this 90 year old was
[1:24:03] desired by a king
[1:24:07] so I want to go over that for again do
[1:24:09] you know the the Great Commission of the
[1:24:11] promised son that she was to fulfilled
[1:24:14] if this commission returned her to being
[1:24:19] the bride that she was when Abraham
[1:24:23] first married her
[1:24:27] it turned her back to her youth again
[1:24:30] come on
[1:24:32] even so the coming of the son of man is
[1:24:35] to fulfill the Great Commission
[1:24:38] so as to bring the end the gospel his
[1:24:41] kingdom must be preached to all the
[1:24:43] world for a witness to All Nations and
[1:24:46] shall the income and to do so the bride
[1:24:49] must return
[1:24:52] the Young Bride
[1:24:55] that she was at Pentecost in order to
[1:24:59] bring forth the promised son
[1:25:06] so this is the age
[1:25:08] in which the true church returns to be
[1:25:10] in the brides he was at Pentecost
[1:25:13] so of course we know then there must be
[1:25:16] of necessity be a return of dynamic
[1:25:19] power
[1:25:21] now brother Branham told us the lot of
[1:25:23] rain let's talk about it for a moment I
[1:25:25] preached about it last week
[1:25:27] but he told us the latter ring would not
[1:25:29] be what the Pentecostals were looking
[1:25:31] for
[1:25:32] to close the heavens that it rained not
[1:25:34] and plagued World governments and and so
[1:25:37] on like that is Moses and Elijah did you
[1:25:40] know Elijah stopped the rain
[1:25:44] amen you know there there he took and
[1:25:47] killed all the false prophets and you
[1:25:49] know did Miracles and signs before Moses
[1:25:53] comes along and plagues uh Pharaoh until
[1:25:55] he lets God's people go
[1:25:58] that is not the bride's Ministry
[1:26:00] remember that happens we'll repeat under
[1:26:03] the two witnesses to the hundred and
[1:26:05] forty four thousand
[1:26:07] so no we won't have what the
[1:26:09] Pentecostals are looking for but we
[1:26:13] should expect
[1:26:15] a people that is standing under the
[1:26:18] blood
[1:26:19] with the mind of Christ
[1:26:22] and speak a word of creation
[1:26:25] for the third pole and it's open in
[1:26:28] other words is based on Mark 11 22.
[1:26:34] now I want you to look at this with me
[1:26:36] Mark 11 22.
[1:26:38] Jesus said have faith in God brother
[1:26:40] Branham says to us have perfect faith
[1:26:46] that this age has required a greater
[1:26:48] faith a rapturing faith
[1:26:51] he says for verily I say unto you
[1:26:55] that whosoever shall say to this
[1:26:58] mountain
[1:26:59] be thou removed and be cast into the sea
[1:27:02] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:27:04] Shall Believe those things which he
[1:27:06] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[1:27:08] whatsoever he saith
[1:27:10] therefore I say unto you whatsoever
[1:27:13] things you desire When you pray
[1:27:17] believe that you receive them
[1:27:20] and you shall have them
[1:27:24] now God made certain
[1:27:28] that we understood this scripture was to
[1:27:32] be made manifested
[1:27:34] in in the third phase or the third poll
[1:27:36] or where the word is revealed we know
[1:27:39] that third pull is the opening of the
[1:27:40] word
[1:27:41] and so God made sure that we understood
[1:27:44] that this scripture would be what it was
[1:27:48] based on
[1:27:50] so the third phase of the word coming to
[1:27:52] the bride is based on this scripture
[1:27:56] a people who takes the word and believe
[1:27:59] it so much
[1:28:02] that whatsoever think they desired they
[1:28:05] believed they receive it and they shall
[1:28:07] have it that if they say to this
[1:28:10] mountain be moved and be cast in the sea
[1:28:14] it shall be done even as they said
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:22] we're talking about the Church of the
[1:28:24] last day now
[1:28:26] we're talking about the people with the
[1:28:28] faith and the commission
[1:28:32] God hiding himself in Simplicity brother
[1:28:34] Branham told us to do this in order to
[1:28:37] fulfill the scripture you have to get
[1:28:40] away from your own thoughts
[1:28:43] you have to let the mind that was in
[1:28:45] Christ be in you you have to stay there
[1:28:48] till every sin of fear every sin of
[1:28:51] Doubt is gone from your heart and if
[1:28:53] you're there and God doesn't take you
[1:28:55] and omit your sins and send you in the
[1:28:58] presence of God there's something wrong
[1:28:59] with your experience I don't care how
[1:29:02] many degrees of doctors you have how big
[1:29:04] a church you are what kind of big will
[1:29:06] you belong to or how many organizations
[1:29:09] whatever it is has nothing to do that
[1:29:11] until your sins are confessed and in the
[1:29:14] blood of Jesus Christ and you stand
[1:29:17] unadulterated a born-again son and
[1:29:20] daughter of God with a life of God in
[1:29:22] you to speak a word of creation let this
[1:29:25] mountain be moved and it'll remind you
[1:29:29] God revealing himself in humility he
[1:29:33] picks up them kind that has no education
[1:29:36] he picks up them kinds that will just
[1:29:39] believe that I think the father creator
[1:29:42] of heavens and earth that thou has hid
[1:29:45] these things from the wise and the
[1:29:46] prudent
[1:29:48] Hallelujah that will look upon him and
[1:29:51] we see we we see him smitten and
[1:29:55] stricken of God but that he was wounded
[1:29:58] for our transgressions
[1:30:00] amen that the Clorox came the day he was
[1:30:04] bruised for our iniquity the
[1:30:06] chastisement upon of our peace was upon
[1:30:09] him with his Strife we were healed what
[1:30:11] did he do he humbled himself to death on
[1:30:13] Good Friday afternoon that he might rise
[1:30:15] Sunday Easter Sunday to send back the
[1:30:19] Holy Spirit upon the church
[1:30:22] with a double portion of it that we
[1:30:25] might do the same things that he did
[1:30:29] amen he and he promised these signs I'm
[1:30:33] giving him the commission again these
[1:30:35] signs will follow them that believe and
[1:30:37] how far we get away from it
[1:30:40] by our traditions
[1:30:43] there you are
[1:30:45] our traditions
[1:30:48] but I want you to understand
[1:30:50] you're no longer like Adam was with a
[1:30:53] Chasm between you and God
[1:30:58] so while we're on the other side of the
[1:30:59] chasm no it's even greater than that
[1:31:02] he did away with the chasm
[1:31:04] there's not even a remembrance
[1:31:08] of your past
[1:31:10] and your sins and you stand pure under
[1:31:13] the blood Hallelujah
[1:31:16] Hallelujah with authority
[1:31:18] to speak the word of creation
[1:31:26] this is where God has placed you the
[1:31:29] authority that he's given his church
[1:31:33] now
[1:31:34] in perfect faith
[1:31:36] brother Branham says that I want you to
[1:31:38] get the word perfect faith not just the
[1:31:40] faith but a perfect faith
[1:31:42] this this bride in this last day is
[1:31:45] required a greater faith
[1:31:47] that in other ages
[1:31:50] a rapturing faith
[1:31:55] somebody with me
[1:31:57] let's hold the thought now you know he
[1:31:59] he tells us over and again and we'll
[1:32:01] read some of it maybe this morning if I
[1:32:04] can't get the church to even believe for
[1:32:05] Divine Healing and have faith for that
[1:32:09] how am I going to get them to believe
[1:32:11] for complete body change
[1:32:16] it's going to take a greater faith
[1:32:18] and faith is based on forgiveness
[1:32:20] because I'm forgiven
[1:32:23] the blood is taking care of the past
[1:32:27] amen it's taking care of my first birth
[1:32:29] listen you cannot speak a word of
[1:32:32] creation under your first birth
[1:32:35] but as an amateur God
[1:32:39] as a son of the Living God you can stand
[1:32:42] there with Divine Authority and speak to
[1:32:45] that mountain
[1:32:54] so faith is based on forgiveness and as
[1:32:56] we said this morning trying to get to
[1:32:59] church
[1:33:00] into the place
[1:33:02] here's my goal here's what I'm trying to
[1:33:04] do get the church
[1:33:06] into the place where we could really see
[1:33:09] Apostolic times moving Among Us
[1:33:13] that's what we all hunger
[1:33:15] and it's just laying right at the door
[1:33:20] I want to just say we're here
[1:33:24] we see it he said and I want to say we
[1:33:28] see it
[1:33:30] Hallelujah we can give testimony after
[1:33:33] testimony we see it we see it we see it
[1:33:37] but he said we want to see more of it
[1:33:40] we want it to flow out that it'll be a
[1:33:43] help to us and flow out to others
[1:33:46] come on the evening light that's what we
[1:33:48] want to be we want to be a light in the
[1:33:51] evening time that it flows out to others
[1:33:54] amen that God is still God and he's
[1:33:58] still living in his people and he's
[1:34:00] still manifests in his glory
[1:34:04] and demonstrating his power
[1:34:10] you know
[1:34:12] too many are looking at it
[1:34:14] all the rain's all over
[1:34:17] it concluded with our Prophet you see he
[1:34:20] was our last sign
[1:34:22] sure it's the last sign before the bride
[1:34:25] coming
[1:34:29] it's the last time before the bride
[1:34:32] coming a prophet had to appear on the
[1:34:34] scene before Christ could come in Bride
[1:34:36] form so sure he was the last sign
[1:34:41] before the Bride Comes
[1:34:44] but you my beloved children you are than
[1:34:47] I signed
[1:34:50] Hallelujah that's who you are you are
[1:34:53] the last sign
[1:34:55] you are God's sign on display with a
[1:34:59] Great Commission these signs shall
[1:35:02] follow them
[1:35:05] that believe that
[1:35:10] but I want you to understand
[1:35:12] the latter rain does not conclude with
[1:35:15] the prophet
[1:35:16] but with the bride
[1:35:20] as he pours out a spirit
[1:35:22] because I'm going to show you it
[1:35:25] crescendos
[1:35:28] with the dynamic power that changes our
[1:35:31] bodies
[1:35:32] resurrected to dead
[1:35:34] and transports the bride into the
[1:35:37] heavenlies what in the world am I
[1:35:40] telling you I'm telling you you hadn't
[1:35:42] seen nothing yet
[1:35:46] Hallelujah the display of God that we
[1:35:49] talk about and what happened under the
[1:35:51] prophet's Ministry You Ain't Seen
[1:35:54] Nothing Yet
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:35:58] if I ain't healing you ain't seen
[1:36:00] nothing yet just wait till my hair turns
[1:36:04] back the right color the wrinkles go out
[1:36:06] of my face
[1:36:07] the formulas leave the body and the dead
[1:36:11] in Christ rise
[1:36:18] devil we're not through with you
[1:36:21] you haven't seen nothing yet
[1:36:24] you're about to be defeated by a woman
[1:36:28] there's a woman gonna give you a legend
[1:36:31] and defeat that itself
[1:36:37] she'll be standing on her feet Chase in
[1:36:40] a moment and a twinkling of an eye
[1:36:51] such a defeat that he'll be cast out of
[1:36:54] the heavens as we go up as we Ascend he
[1:36:58] comes down
[1:36:59] [Applause]
[1:37:01] he falls he's thrown down by bride and
[1:37:05] Power
[1:37:09] the full heavens of Adam once ruled from
[1:37:12] this bride will rule
[1:37:18] Mark 11 22.
[1:37:20] this was exactly
[1:37:22] what Adam did in the beginning
[1:37:25] the bride does this in the end time
[1:37:35] listen
[1:37:37] go back and listen brother Brandon said
[1:37:39] if you miss it come listen to this tape
[1:37:42] and he tells her the purpose of God
[1:37:44] what God was doing
[1:37:47] all down to the ages
[1:37:49] they sent a message called Christ the
[1:37:51] mystery
[1:37:55] that message
[1:37:56] was to show us the seventh seal of his
[1:38:00] coming
[1:38:02] and is coming
[1:38:04] that would be
[1:38:06] would be in Bride form
[1:38:08] before the meeting in the air
[1:38:12] let's don't do away with the meeting in
[1:38:13] the air that's the believer's hope
[1:38:16] amen but before he comes in the and we
[1:38:19] meet him in the air he's manifest in his
[1:38:22] fullness in Bride forms he will be the
[1:38:25] fullness shall I say she is the fullness
[1:38:28] of the godhead bodily every word that
[1:38:31] spoke of the Bride down to the Ageless
[1:38:33] will be manifested in her
[1:38:36] I actually have a word that was spoke of
[1:38:38] the groom will also be manifested in the
[1:38:40] bride as as as it is applied in Bride
[1:38:44] form now so you see you see
[1:38:48] um as he preached that sermon he told us
[1:38:51] that all that God was
[1:38:54] he poured into Christ and all that is in
[1:38:57] Christ is poured into church
[1:39:00] as every scripture and every type
[1:39:02] pointed to the coming of Jesus two
[1:39:05] thousand years ago
[1:39:07] but now every scripture and type points
[1:39:11] to a bride coming of Christ
[1:39:14] and that before Jesus comes there will
[1:39:18] be a bride on Earth that matches the
[1:39:21] groom coming from heaven
[1:39:24] as I explained the other day it's the
[1:39:26] marriage of the Lamb species has to
[1:39:28] marry species there has to be a lamb and
[1:39:31] lamb Ministry on the Earth
[1:39:34] to match the lamb coming from heaven
[1:39:38] now or otherwise you would have a lamb
[1:39:41] marrying a goat or a lamb Mary and a
[1:39:42] donkey or a lamb Mary and a failure of a
[1:39:45] mule
[1:39:46] he can't do it species must marry
[1:39:49] species
[1:39:50] so there has to be a lamb on Earth
[1:39:53] a bride who exactly matches the lamb
[1:39:58] that was here 2000 years ago
[1:40:01] except this one he's not he's taken them
[1:40:04] through calvary's but he's not taking
[1:40:06] them to Calgary he's taken he has taken
[1:40:09] them through Calvary all the way to a
[1:40:11] rapture
[1:40:13] now so that because every person has to
[1:40:15] have their own dying out to self
[1:40:18] but now notice here there has to be a
[1:40:21] bride on Earth that matches the groom
[1:40:22] coming from Heaven even as Adam's bride
[1:40:25] was hidden inside of him
[1:40:28] so God hid the bride in the scripture
[1:40:31] The Mystery of the Bride it was hidden
[1:40:35] in women like Sarah
[1:40:37] women like Esther women like Rebecca
[1:40:42] amen even men like Enoch
[1:40:46] amen men like Noah
[1:40:49] all the way down men like Jesus
[1:40:53] got manifested in flesh got manifested
[1:40:55] in your flesh
[1:40:58] amen well you know whatever it is you
[1:41:01] know whether it be Peter walking on the
[1:41:04] water
[1:41:07] amen sometimes the word will say come
[1:41:10] and you'll follow him and you'll get
[1:41:12] your eyes on other things and you fall
[1:41:15] but God don't leave you there
[1:41:17] remember Peter
[1:41:21] amen get your eyes back on me on Christ
[1:41:25] amen get your eyes back on Jesus look
[1:41:29] away from your storms get your eyes back
[1:41:31] on me he will pick you up and you'll
[1:41:35] walk on water twice
[1:41:40] some of you walked on water once and you
[1:41:43] failed and don't lay there and drown
[1:41:45] come on scream out Master save me I
[1:41:48] perish he reach out a hand to you and
[1:41:51] lift you up you'll walk on the water
[1:41:52] twice
[1:41:56] you see you've got to look at the
[1:41:59] scripture they are telling Jesus said
[1:42:01] since the scriptures he said to the
[1:42:04] denominationals the Pharisees in them
[1:42:06] you think you have eternal life
[1:42:09] Joel Osteen thinks he has eternal life
[1:42:12] in those scriptures but they are not
[1:42:15] testifying of them
[1:42:17] they're testifying of you
[1:42:23] now Joel can believe some of them see it
[1:42:25] manifest in his life
[1:42:27] but it was for you
[1:42:30] the blessings are for you
[1:42:32] all those blessings that he talks about
[1:42:34] is your blessings
[1:42:40] amen Ishmael was getting a lot of
[1:42:43] blessings
[1:42:45] because he was in the camp of Abraham
[1:42:49] he was born in the camp he was he was
[1:42:52] part of that movement until he mocked
[1:43:00] the blessings of a son was placed on him
[1:43:03] the love of a father was placed on him
[1:43:07] the care
[1:43:08] of the tribe was placed on him
[1:43:12] listen don't get amazed and say well
[1:43:15] they get blessed out there sure they do
[1:43:19] you know whatever their faith can
[1:43:22] believe in they can have that
[1:43:24] they cannot fade for Cadillac they can
[1:43:26] have a Cadillac so can you
[1:43:30] amen they could have faith for a new job
[1:43:33] so can you
[1:43:35] if they can have faith for blessing so
[1:43:37] can you
[1:43:40] listen it's not just for them these are
[1:43:43] for you the blessings that lays in the
[1:43:45] word whatsoever thing you desire When
[1:43:49] you pray you believe you receive them
[1:43:51] and you shall have them
[1:43:55] well they get healed in their meeting
[1:43:57] I've heard of a woman getting healed you
[1:43:59] know and and Abdul's mother got healed
[1:44:01] of breast cancer and oh you know or
[1:44:04] whatever cancer it was she was healed of
[1:44:06] it sure they get healed
[1:44:10] but it's for you
[1:44:12] it's the rain falling
[1:44:16] whether you're just or unjust whether
[1:44:19] you end the word or out of the word
[1:44:20] whether you're bride or foolish virgin
[1:44:22] it's the rain falling
[1:44:25] but it's your rain
[1:44:28] it's your anointing
[1:44:30] hallelujah it's your time to Rejoice
[1:44:33] it's not just Theirs to Rejoice over
[1:44:36] it's your time of rejoicing
[1:44:50] so has God hid Eve
[1:44:54] in Adam
[1:44:57] and brought her out of him to express
[1:45:00] what was bone of his bone and flesh of
[1:45:02] his flesh
[1:45:03] God hid the bride in the word
[1:45:06] down to the ages Old and New Testament
[1:45:09] fact of the matter is he says as the
[1:45:12] groom fulfilled the Old Testament so
[1:45:14] does the bride fulfill the New Testament
[1:45:19] I got to preach a little bit
[1:45:22] I got to preach this a little bit come
[1:45:24] on Mary Magdalene
[1:45:25] out of whom has been cast Seven Devils
[1:45:29] from Seven Church ages
[1:45:31] come on Hallelujah
[1:45:34] come on woman who was caught in adultery
[1:45:38] in the very active adultery and the one
[1:45:41] who could have condemned you and sent
[1:45:43] you to hell didn't do it
[1:45:46] but wrote there on the ground
[1:45:50] expose the enemy and forgave you of your
[1:45:53] sins and said neither do I condemn you
[1:45:56] go and sin don't disbelieve anymore
[1:46:06] they are they that testify of me sets
[1:46:10] the scriptures
[1:46:11] [Applause]
[1:46:26] they didn't change the clock
[1:46:30] Hallelujah
[1:46:37] they didn't change the clock
[1:46:48] so the bride was hidden
[1:46:50] in Adam
[1:46:52] he put her to sleep he put him to sleep
[1:46:55] for God to bring her out
[1:46:57] so Christ the groom
[1:46:59] there has to be a bride come forth from
[1:47:01] him
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:03] she will be a word bride
[1:47:05] it's just a manifestation of all the
[1:47:07] fulfillings of all the revelations
[1:47:10] that others spoke of the Bride
[1:47:13] you know if she does something different
[1:47:16] than from Christ the groom
[1:47:19] and his word it isn't the bride because
[1:47:21] she's flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[1:47:23] bone in life of his life and power of
[1:47:25] his power
[1:47:27] she is Christ
[1:47:30] but in bright form
[1:47:34] she's anointed one to this day
[1:47:38] this is why the angel had to come back
[1:47:41] and include Sarah the seed couldn't come
[1:47:44] without her
[1:47:47] as Adam and Eve were one she took the
[1:47:50] feminine Spirit from him
[1:47:52] making her or he took the feminine
[1:47:55] Spirit from him making her both
[1:47:57] mechanics and Dynamics flesh and spirit
[1:48:00] and so is the bride the restored word
[1:48:04] let me say some things here the restored
[1:48:07] word did not come to make new churches
[1:48:11] that we call message churches
[1:48:15] the restored word came to take on flesh
[1:48:20] Christ must be in Bride form
[1:48:24] that's why the Bride is a word bride she
[1:48:26] came from Christ the spoken words The
[1:48:29] Original Seed
[1:48:31] so much she be the word haven't come
[1:48:34] from him
[1:48:36] now today some see his presence
[1:48:40] as we talk about his presence in the
[1:48:43] form of son of man as he appeared to
[1:48:44] Sarah as he walked to shores of Galilee
[1:48:47] and again in this last day
[1:48:49] and some see his presence only
[1:48:51] manifested in a prophet
[1:48:54] and the word coming to him and you know
[1:48:56] the perusal movement proclaimed he's
[1:48:59] here
[1:49:00] he's here and they believe that pivotal
[1:49:03] Point had come with seven angels
[1:49:06] bringing the mysteries of God to a
[1:49:09] prophet and they can actually see and
[1:49:12] understand Revelation 10 1 that
[1:49:15] ascending of the mighty Angel Christ
[1:49:19] some of them proclaimed the coming was
[1:49:21] over right then
[1:49:23] but it wasn't
[1:49:25] the coming that only got him started
[1:49:29] amen what was that it was to shout
[1:49:33] amen listen the Bible said in Revelation
[1:49:37] 10 that he cried with a loud voice
[1:49:41] he wasn't snotting
[1:49:43] he wasn't weeping
[1:49:45] you didn't have to hand him a
[1:49:46] handkerchief he was shouting
[1:49:48] with a loud voice
[1:49:50] somebody with me parallels it parallels
[1:49:54] first Thessalonians 4 and the Lord
[1:49:55] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:49:57] shout
[1:49:59] so that's part of his coming it was
[1:50:01] God's word coming to a prophet
[1:50:04] the word coming to a messenger
[1:50:08] amen and that will that message was
[1:50:10] proclaimed or shouted out
[1:50:15] oh well why not come like the
[1:50:17] denominational looking for him you know
[1:50:19] that he splits the Eastern count sky and
[1:50:21] he shouts and there's a voice of an
[1:50:23] archangel and Trump a garden
[1:50:25] we all go up in heaven
[1:50:27] why not come like they think
[1:50:30] well ask yourself why
[1:50:33] why did he have to come in word form
[1:50:35] first
[1:50:38] there was no bride to take into heaven
[1:50:41] we only had denominational women
[1:50:46] Sarah wasn't ready
[1:50:48] her faith wasn't there somebody helped
[1:50:51] me preach
[1:50:52] so why did he come in word form first
[1:50:55] because there had to be a word to turn
[1:50:57] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:50:59] faith of the fathers
[1:51:02] so there had to be children's heart that
[1:51:04] was turned back to Faith again like
[1:51:07] Sarah's heart had to be turned back to
[1:51:09] believing again
[1:51:11] somebody with me so first comes a
[1:51:14] message
[1:51:18] the word
[1:51:19] coming to a prophet
[1:51:23] and when he proclaimed the message
[1:51:26] seven Thunders under their voices
[1:51:29] and the voice of God came to a prophet
[1:51:33] and we heard the shout to the seventh
[1:51:35] Angel's message and it finished the
[1:51:38] mysteries of God
[1:51:41] restored what Paul had brought
[1:51:45] all the truths and predestination
[1:51:47] eternal security
[1:51:49] of the Rapture of the of the of the
[1:51:52] baptisms that Peter taught on the day of
[1:51:55] Pentecost and one God all is it was
[1:51:58] restored
[1:51:59] are you with me plus the Mysteries that
[1:52:02] had been reserved for this age of how we
[1:52:04] got to where we are today
[1:52:07] coming down to Seven Ages
[1:52:09] and how it got distorted on how that
[1:52:12] there's been the canker one Pummel worm
[1:52:14] caterpillar and Locust but it come in
[1:52:17] the form of white horse and a red and a
[1:52:19] black and a pale
[1:52:21] as the enemy went riding to conquer the
[1:52:24] church
[1:52:25] amen but in this day and hour the
[1:52:28] mystery was revealed of what the
[1:52:30] Antichrist did to show us our names are
[1:52:34] in the book
[1:52:35] and that we are the mystery of that book
[1:52:40] Hallelujah and restore to us the truths
[1:52:43] of that book
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:46] same thing he does with Israel he brings
[1:52:48] him back to their Promised Land the
[1:52:50] people of the book Return to the land of
[1:52:52] the book
[1:52:52] that's the same thing God does for us in
[1:52:55] this day the people of the book Return
[1:52:56] to the land of the book every promise
[1:53:02] so you see it had to come word first the
[1:53:06] word had to be restored so it begins
[1:53:08] with a shout a mighty message it's not
[1:53:10] just shouting
[1:53:15] that's not it
[1:53:17] it is saying something
[1:53:22] it's a message
[1:53:25] and it comes and revealed through the
[1:53:27] seventh angel
[1:53:29] amen where that what was reserved for
[1:53:32] this age could now be revealed now we
[1:53:36] can come back to being the bride we were
[1:53:39] at Pentecost
[1:53:45] and he finished the mystery of God it
[1:53:47] broke the Silence with the opening of
[1:53:49] the seventh seal it reveals the seven
[1:53:52] Mysteries those seven mysterious symbols
[1:53:56] of a writer of death whose horse changed
[1:53:59] from white to Red to Black and finally
[1:54:01] pale
[1:54:02] showed us the souls under the altar the
[1:54:05] multitude without number and the 144
[1:54:08] thousand
[1:54:09] and the judgments under the six seal
[1:54:12] and the seventh seal broke to silence
[1:54:15] on his coming
[1:54:18] but I want you to get understand
[1:54:20] something
[1:54:21] it does not stop with the shout
[1:54:26] and that's been the mistake
[1:54:29] that many people have made they
[1:54:32] denominated on that by putting a period
[1:54:38] this is what God did and they have built
[1:54:41] denominations around the message on
[1:54:44] God's sin and a prophet
[1:54:47] and we're no better than the
[1:54:48] Pentecostals who went around Acts 2 and
[1:54:50] 4 Acts 2 and 4 and act 2 and 4 didn't go
[1:54:52] into the lamb and we went around Malachi
[1:54:54] for malachiopore Malachi poor rather
[1:54:56] than going into the lab
[1:54:58] [Applause]
[1:55:07] the revealing of the Mysteries to a
[1:55:09] prophet shouting out Vindicated truce
[1:55:14] is just the first phase of his coming
[1:55:19] the rapture we learned was
[1:55:22] it was not a moment when I event that's
[1:55:26] the body change
[1:55:29] the Rapture or is coming is a
[1:55:32] progression it starts with the prophet
[1:55:35] bringing his message
[1:55:36] calling out of people listen if if
[1:55:39] Revelation 18 didn't take place of a
[1:55:42] voice coming saying come out of her my
[1:55:45] people there would never be a virgin for
[1:55:48] Christ to marry they would all be in the
[1:55:50] Horus system
[1:55:53] but he can only bring his word through a
[1:55:57] virgin
[1:55:58] remember the prophecy is a virgin shall
[1:56:01] conceive
[1:56:02] is a prophecy
[1:56:05] and the bride has to be born just like
[1:56:07] him of the spoken word
[1:56:09] of a supernatural birth
[1:56:11] it's not another manhandling it's not
[1:56:14] another denomination it's not another
[1:56:16] thing of theology
[1:56:20] so someone
[1:56:22] must listen it has to progress
[1:56:27] from the shout to the voice
[1:56:30] of the Resurrection
[1:56:34] now this is where brother Branham tells
[1:56:36] us and it is the rising of the Sun
[1:56:39] of a bride coming of Christ
[1:56:43] because he's already come and groom form
[1:56:45] two thousand years ago we're to meet him
[1:56:48] in the air but there has to be a people
[1:56:50] prepared to meet him
[1:56:52] the marriage of the Lamb has come what
[1:56:54] if there's nobody prepared to meet him
[1:56:58] but there has to be a bride make herself
[1:57:00] ready
[1:57:01] well how are you going to make yourself
[1:57:02] ready with with how with the truths of
[1:57:05] the Bible obscured which is the clothes
[1:57:07] to dress the bride in
[1:57:11] how are you going to meet him in the
[1:57:13] garments of the filthy rides of
[1:57:15] denomination
[1:57:17] of Creeds and dogwoods and Men
[1:57:20] somebody with me amen I know some of
[1:57:23] this may be Elementary but I want to say
[1:57:25] it so Elementary that even our young
[1:57:27] people can follow it
[1:57:29] not because they're dumb because they're
[1:57:31] just now learning some of them just got
[1:57:33] to the age of maturity where they're
[1:57:35] starting to
[1:57:36] understand
[1:57:39] some of them just got the Holy Ghost
[1:57:41] where they can understand
[1:57:44] so you see someone's got to be the voice
[1:57:47] of the Resurrection
[1:57:49] what Resurrection
[1:57:52] for sure the voice that Christ is alive
[1:57:56] but the voice of Christ being alive and
[1:57:58] bride formed
[1:58:03] think of what I'm saying
[1:58:06] because even as Christ went into the
[1:58:09] grave
[1:58:10] and was there for three days
[1:58:13] so through the churches the bride was
[1:58:16] put in the tombs of a
[1:58:19] of denominationalism
[1:58:21] I just caught brother Branham and true
[1:58:23] Easter seal he said I had a Baptist tomb
[1:58:26] some of you had a presbyterian tomb or
[1:58:29] Catholic tomb or whatever but you were
[1:58:31] sealed away
[1:58:33] dead
[1:58:35] come on that's what you were in you were
[1:58:38] sealed away but in this day Christ broke
[1:58:43] the seals
[1:58:47] Hallelujah and freed the Dead
[1:58:51] and raised up a bride
[1:58:54] and now she can say I am the one that
[1:58:58] was dead
[1:58:59] but now I am alive forever more and I
[1:59:03] have the keys to death in hell I will
[1:59:06] overcome Satan's evening
[1:59:15] now
[1:59:16] so the bride
[1:59:18] not only
[1:59:20] not only is the shout promise
[1:59:24] but the voice of the resurrection
[1:59:26] showing Christ is alive the same
[1:59:28] yesterday today and forever until it
[1:59:31] crescendos
[1:59:33] our climaxes
[1:59:35] makes us Apex
[1:59:38] reaches its zenith
[1:59:40] with the dead in Christ Rising
[1:59:44] the bride must prophesy again
[1:59:48] if you just stop and look at Revelation
[1:59:51] 10 and style stop with Boy verse 7 you
[1:59:54] missed half of what the angel is doing
[1:59:58] the same angel that took the book The
[2:00:01] open book and reveals a mystery to the
[2:00:04] prophet is the same angel that comes to
[2:00:07] John who represents or types of Bride
[2:00:10] and says take the little book and eat it
[2:00:15] in other words digest what has been
[2:00:18] given
[2:00:19] and he said to me thou must prophesy
[2:00:22] again before many people and Nations and
[2:00:25] tongues and King what
[2:00:29] this gospel must be preached to our
[2:00:32] Nations
[2:00:35] I did shall the income
[2:00:38] oh yeah some of it's bitter
[2:00:41] parts of it is really sweet
[2:00:44] I just tell you keep it down
[2:00:48] I don't care if you don't like parts of
[2:00:50] what brother Branham said keep it down
[2:00:53] digest it let it burn within you until
[2:00:56] you can prophesy to the bones
[2:01:00] can they live again can the death of the
[2:01:03] Seven Angels rise will they be will they
[2:01:06] always stay in the grave will there
[2:01:08] always be dust and fragments of Bones
[2:01:10] scattered upon the Earth is that the way
[2:01:12] it's going to be forever and ever and
[2:01:14] ever and ever has been for Seven Ages
[2:01:19] will it always remain there
[2:01:23] will the church always be like Sarah
[2:01:25] Baron Baron Baron Baron
[2:01:28] hope after I hope after hope Revival
[2:01:30] after Revival only to be disappointed

[2:01:43] away

[2:01:47] what is it for to continue his work
[2:01:50] among his people to bring his church
[2:01:53] together to bring a church to a place in
[2:01:56] this day far beyond the Lutheran
[2:01:58] Methodist and Pentecostal into a place
[2:02:00] to adoption And Eruption Grace that when
[2:02:03] this part of the church when the spirit
[2:02:05] moves in this church here
[2:02:08] it'll just raise and it'll bring forth
[2:02:11] and bring forth all this read all the
[2:02:13] redeemed that's been touched by the
[2:02:15] spirit the lutherans who stood there
[2:02:17] with all the light that they had in
[2:02:18] justification those methodists that fell
[2:02:21] on the floor and they threw water in
[2:02:23] their face upon the spirit striking them
[2:02:25] through sanctification those
[2:02:27] Pentecostals that walked up and down the
[2:02:30] streets and they called them tongues
[2:02:32] demons and and jabbers and Goose
[2:02:35] language and all of that they'll stand
[2:02:37] in the righteousness in the sight of God
[2:02:39] at that dangerous as soon as the Bible
[2:02:41] stands here if you don't believe me if
[2:02:45] you believe me to be a servant you call
[2:02:47] me as Prophet I don't call myself that
[2:02:48] but you listen I'm telling you in the
[2:02:51] name of the Lord that those that are in
[2:02:54] Christ will God bring with him at his
[2:02:56] coming at the resurrection and only
[2:02:58] those that are in Christ

[2:03:11] it'll bring us brethren
[2:03:16] do you realize them they're waiting on

[2:03:29] race we did it so can you

[2:03:46] in the water and say to him it behooves
[2:03:48] us to fulfill all scripture

[2:03:54] the Holy Ghost to go forth
[2:03:57] entering into the third pole the opening
[2:04:00] of the word the revealing of the
[2:04:02] Mysteries
[2:04:03] which we know now was a word coming to a
[2:04:06] prophet
[2:04:07] but God was showing the power that lays
[2:04:09] in the word
[2:04:11] untapped resources
[2:04:14] that we have not even barely skimmed the
[2:04:18] surface of
[2:04:21] and it's all based on Mark 11 22 a power
[2:04:24] that can create squirrels it's a power
[2:04:26] of creation
[2:04:27] a power that can speak lost life to lost

[2:09:06] talking about the power
[2:09:08] that lays in the word that came to us by
[2:09:11] the opening of The Seven Seals
[2:09:20] you want to take that and just make it
[2:09:22] into a Creed and a Dogma into lecture
[2:09:25] just a dry teaching it's not a dry
[2:09:28] kitchen
[2:09:36] good
[2:09:38] oh
[2:09:43] let me see
[2:09:46] I got it somewhere I did
[2:09:48] but many times it's quoted
[2:09:51] ah brother Tim
[2:09:53] supreme power
[2:09:56] with Supreme deity
[2:09:58] in action
[2:10:00] is not screaming and running to aisles
[2:10:02] and jumping up and down
[2:10:04] it's not shouting
[2:10:06] precious words came out of his mouth
[2:10:11] well precious words came out of Hattie
[2:10:14] Wright's mouth too
[2:10:15] that's nothing but the truth
[2:10:19] But after those precious words came out
[2:10:21] of her mouth
[2:10:24] and brother Brandon says I give you your
[2:10:26] children
[2:10:27] he said there was a scream come out of
[2:10:29] that woman's mouth that had been heard
[2:10:31] for two city blocks
[2:10:34] Amen brother Ben and said this is what
[2:10:37] happened when a super anointing came
[2:10:39] down
[2:10:40] Hallelujah I'm talking about a super
[2:10:43] Clerk of super race with a super
[2:10:45] anointing and when it came down she
[2:10:48] screamed
[2:10:57] sometimes the anointing comes down you
[2:10:59] sit there and weep that's the anointing
[2:11:05] amen Lord that's the anointing sometimes
[2:11:09] it rises up you dance the aisles that's
[2:11:11] the anointing sometimes you scream out
[2:11:14] glory to God that's the anointing
[2:11:19] it's just deity and supreme control
[2:11:25] so anyway
[2:11:26] he tells us is honey right the other day
[2:11:28] she didn't ask for nothing
[2:11:30] she's just sitting there but she said
[2:11:32] the right thing
[2:11:33] when it pleased the Holy Spirit and the
[2:11:36] Holy Spirit said spoke back and said
[2:11:38] Hattie ask for anything you will
[2:11:41] whatever you got whatever you want
[2:11:44] find out whether this is real or not ask
[2:11:47] anything healing of her little crippled

[2:12:24] coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got
[2:12:26] to have Rapture and faith in a church
[2:12:28] that can be changed in a moment in a
[2:12:30] twinkle of an hour to go out or will not
[2:12:32] go but don't worry

[2:13:33] it's by my children it's for my body
[2:13:36] it's for the chance
[2:13:39] it's a commission
[2:13:46] you gotta have faith in this hour
[2:13:49] it requires a faith
[2:13:55] start confessing
[2:13:57] my children are saved

[2:14:08] and blessed in the city blessed coming
[2:14:10] in and bless going out amen I'm going to
[2:14:13] be blessed because God does the
[2:14:15] impossible math because God is more than
[2:14:18] evil and His blessings are going to be
[2:14:20] because I am a part of the pride in
[2:14:23] Jesus Christ through the blessings are
[2:14:25] far
[2:14:26] Hallelujah
[2:14:32] but you don't know how long I've been
[2:14:34] bearing you don't know how long my
[2:14:36] troubles been you don't know how
[2:14:38] faithless I've been I don't care how
[2:14:40] many times you found Peter reach out
[2:14:43] your hand
[2:14:47] reach back to him and say Lord save me I
[2:14:50] perish
[2:14:54] turn my heart back to believing again
[2:15:04] pressure
[2:15:08] I'll have to have another part to this
[2:15:11] but let's get this part now
[2:15:17] so he says
[2:15:19] that's the ministry
[2:15:21] we're entering into
[2:15:24] they come
[2:15:26] it's the word well sure it's the word
[2:15:29] but in that word has power
[2:15:33] because the word is a person
[2:15:38] when the word came to brother Branham
[2:15:41] did it come in a book
[2:15:46] when it was there that day he'd done
[2:15:49] looked in the books
[2:15:51] said I was about to make a huge mistake
[2:15:53] I looked in the books of what all these
[2:15:56] letters had said
[2:15:58] and I was just going to go out and say
[2:16:00] what I read in the book
[2:16:02] but about that time he
[2:16:05] a person came into the room I want you
[2:16:09] to know the word we preach is not a book
[2:16:11] it's a person
[2:16:13] it is the Holy Ghost it's the power of
[2:16:16] God under salvation
[2:16:28] I might hand you a book
[2:16:30] I might give you a seal book or church
[2:16:33] age Booker
[2:16:35] hence your Bible
[2:16:38] but that's not what I want you to
[2:16:39] receive
[2:16:42] I'm just letting you know about the
[2:16:45] author
[2:16:47] but when you receive the Holy Ghost
[2:16:50] you don't receive the book you receive
[2:16:52] the person of the book
[2:16:55] the author himself comes to live in you
[2:16:58] and live that word out of your life that
[2:17:01] you wasn't able to do to believe what
[2:17:04] you couldn't believe
[2:17:13] we're way up the road now
[2:17:15] soon to come into the Lord Jesus
[2:17:18] and we've got to have a rapturing faith
[2:17:21] in a church that can be changed in a
[2:17:23] moment in a twinkling to go out or will
[2:17:26] not go
[2:17:28] but don't worry
[2:17:29] it'll be there it'll be there
[2:17:33] and when the power of this church Rises
[2:17:46] when the power of this church Rises
[2:17:50] see where it's depending on
[2:17:53] the power of this church Rises watch he
[2:17:58] says
[2:17:59] it'll bring its brethren
[2:18:04] amen do we want to see the debt in
[2:18:07] Christ's rise
[2:18:09] amen it can only come with the power of
[2:18:12] this church Rising
[2:18:15] amen and when the power of this church
[2:18:18] Rises it'll bring us Brethren and then
[2:18:21] the power of that church Rises it will
[2:18:24] bring its Brethren the power of that
[2:18:26] church will bring the other Brethren and
[2:18:28] then there'll be a general Resurrection
[2:18:32] we're looking forward to it
[2:18:34] and it all Lays within the word
[2:18:38] and faith in it
[2:18:41] rapturing faith
[2:18:44] your commissioned
[2:18:47] to fulfill this
[2:18:50] I know
[2:18:52] you might look at me
[2:18:53] like Mary and said how can this be
[2:18:58] how in the world could this be I I don't
[2:19:00] know a man
[2:19:03] and he said it won't be a man
[2:19:05] it'll be the overshadowing of the Holy
[2:19:07] Ghost
[2:19:11] that Holy thing that is born in you will
[2:19:13] be of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:15] you can look at yourself and say how can
[2:19:18] you expect me to be this I can't expect
[2:19:21] you to do it on your own
[2:19:24] but I can expect him to do it
[2:19:26] because he prophesied it would be for
[2:19:29] this last day
[2:19:31] amen now what about the bride now well
[2:19:33] she become that Mighty Army that Ezekiel
[2:19:36] Saw a people a people who prophesy
[2:19:40] speaking the word not only fulfilling
[2:19:43] Mark 16 but also Mark 11 22 for all
[2:19:49] scripture
[2:19:50] must be fulfilled
[2:19:52] turn around and look at your neighbor
[2:19:54] and say all scripture must be fulfilled
[2:19:58] so you see brother Branham Saul in the
[2:20:01] bride in a restoration of the Bright
[2:20:04] Tree he saw her as a restored Church
[2:20:07] possessing the enemy's Gates
[2:20:10] seeing her as one that the Gates of Hell
[2:20:12] cannot Prevail against
[2:20:15] he describes her as a bright tree that
[2:20:18] four messengers of death destroyed the
[2:20:21] palm of him the locus of
[2:20:23] caterpillar that the canker worm but
[2:20:27] with four messengers of righteousness
[2:20:30] she is being restored
[2:20:33] so he goes all the way back and he says
[2:20:35] justification brought the pulp
[2:20:38] sanctification brought the bark doctrine
[2:20:41] of Holiness what brought back the leaf
[2:20:44] Pentecostals what is Pentecostals leaves
[2:20:47] clap their hands Joy rejoicing
[2:20:50] Pentecostals
[2:20:52] now some message churches don't want you
[2:20:54] to have any leaves
[2:20:57] but how can you be a restored Church
[2:20:59] Without leaves
[2:21:00] [Applause]

[2:21:14] the pulp has been there amen but you
[2:21:17] know why that I'm rejoicing because
[2:21:19] leaves are coming on the trees
[2:21:21] [Applause]
[2:21:22] Hallelujah I know the end of the summer
[2:21:25] is nigh I know it's a time of harvest I
[2:21:28] know it's the time of fruit
[2:21:30] life is coming in the body it is it is a
[2:21:34] Vindication to Rapture is at hand
[2:21:39] Hallelujah
[2:21:41] amen so we're not going to let someone
[2:21:43] canker worm come along or look us and
[2:21:46] eat off the joy off the tree
[2:21:49] we're going to have joy
[2:21:51] well amen we want to be able to move in
[2:21:53] The Winds of the spirit lift our hands
[2:21:56] up and worship God come on
[2:21:58] but he said the fourth was the word
[2:22:00] itself the word made flesh fruits of the
[2:22:04] proof of the Resurrection sign that
[2:22:07] Christ has finally after justification
[2:22:09] been planted sanctification been planted
[2:22:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations
[2:22:14] died out and now Christ is again
[2:22:16] centered himself like that in the cap of
[2:22:19] the pyramid
[2:22:20] first line justification sanctuation
[2:22:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming
[2:22:25] into the cap so the word has come
[2:22:28] to cap off the bride the final mystery
[2:22:31] to the church
[2:22:33] we have received the Capstone message
[2:22:36] we didn't need Coleman to come do it or
[2:22:38] leave hail to come do it the Capstone
[2:22:41] message came through Malachi 4.
[2:22:44] the Capstone word with the proof of the
[2:22:47] sign of the Resurrection
[2:22:49] the youthful bride lost at Pentecost is
[2:22:54] back again
[2:22:55] and brother Branham for ran her coming
[2:23:07] I want you to get it he's a forerunner
[2:23:09] we've seen him as that well he was going
[2:23:12] to forerun to come and work yes
[2:23:15] but the coming word was to be in Bride
[2:23:17] form
[2:23:19] God didn't send the prophet that line
[2:23:21] you with more books in the shelf of
[2:23:23] theology God sent a prophet in this day
[2:23:26] so the word could be digested and
[2:23:30] received and spoken again
[2:23:33] what comes on your lips and is an action
[2:23:36] in your life and you being the Overcomer
[2:23:39] and the one who does the works of God
[2:23:43] The Works that I do Jesus said You shall
[2:23:46] do also
[2:23:47] and even greater than these
[2:23:51] because it's going to be now in Brad
[2:23:53] form in a manifested body
[2:23:56] Christ's a mystery brother Bradham said
[2:23:58] Quicken means Made Alive
[2:24:01] his flesh which is his body and that's
[2:24:03] the word has been laying there dead for
[2:24:06] years but gradually has come to in the
[2:24:09] reformation and now she's standing on
[2:24:12] her feet
[2:24:13] oh I wish I had time to go back in
[2:24:15] Ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and
[2:24:17] show you can these bones live again
[2:24:19] prophesy how can the prophecy come only
[2:24:22] through the prophet it's the word of the
[2:24:24] Lord hear ye die Bones the word the Lord
[2:24:27] and this new skin come upon them and
[2:24:30] they stood up a mighty Army and began to
[2:24:33] March towards Zion glory to God he said
[2:24:36] that's him that's him the victory
[2:24:40] so his victory is not complete
[2:24:43] until we defeat death
[2:24:47] you see Christ
[2:24:49] and I'm quoting from the spoken word The
[2:24:51] Original Seed Christ was manifested to
[2:24:55] destroy the works of the devil
[2:24:58] now his body is to do the same
[2:25:02] because the body
[2:25:04] is the head and the body is together if
[2:25:08] Christ is ahead and is the word his body
[2:25:11] who is Virgin born of the word has to do
[2:25:13] the same thing that the head did
[2:25:16] so you see Christ is manifested to to
[2:25:20] destroy the works of the devil this is
[2:25:23] why he said when the gospel is priests
[2:25:26] you're going to destroy the works of the
[2:25:29] devil in my name you will cast Satan out
[2:25:34] come on Amen you'll lay hands on the
[2:25:38] sick and they shall recover
[2:25:40] this is the word of God this is the
[2:25:43] promise of the word notice now so who is
[2:25:46] this son of man
[2:25:49] people talk about son of man son of man
[2:25:51] son of man son of man son of man got a
[2:25:53] whole doctrines built on it
[2:25:56] who is the son of man it is the word in
[2:26:00] Bride form
[2:26:03] where is the mighty angel
[2:26:07] he come down he opened up Seven Seals
[2:26:12] come on did you just go back in the
[2:26:14] heavens and that's it
[2:26:16] the message is ended it's over it's fine
[2:26:18] it's going whatever we just becoming a
[2:26:20] message church and warm with you like
[2:26:22] every denomination is done just become
[2:26:23] good church members
[2:26:27] where is the mighty angel
[2:26:30] where is the son of man today
[2:26:33] she has come to empower Sarah
[2:26:37] to Crown her with perfect faith for a
[2:26:41] perfect rapture
[2:26:44] brother Tim the message is about brother
[2:26:47] Branham about
[2:26:49] how great a man he was and how great a
[2:26:52] prophet he was and oh he was a word
[2:26:55] prophet and and then deifying him
[2:26:58] well I did the spirit had people looking
[2:27:00] for him to raise up on Easter
[2:27:03] when he died and they looked for him to
[2:27:04] resurrect and come back for return
[2:27:06] Ministry
[2:27:07] but I want to tell you God's object was
[2:27:10] never a prophet
[2:27:14] no his object couldn't be fulfilled
[2:27:17] without a prophet
[2:27:18] but his object was not a prophet
[2:27:21] no more than John the Baptist was the
[2:27:24] object in Jesus day
[2:27:27] somebody help me preach John the Baptist
[2:27:30] was not what God wanted just John the
[2:27:33] Baptist he was wanting the word to
[2:27:35] become flesh
[2:27:37] he was to introduce the son of man
[2:27:40] Christ
[2:27:41] [Music]
[2:27:43] God and dust
[2:27:46] to give his life
[2:27:49] so God could be in more dust
[2:27:55] Hallelujah do you get it now you are the
[2:27:58] Dust
[2:28:01] Come On Son of Man prophesy son of dust
[2:28:05] how could you speak a word of creation
[2:28:07] by the Christ that is in me
[2:28:12] not getting away from my own thinking
[2:28:14] and thinking like he thought
[2:28:18] when you think like a god instead of a
[2:28:20] man things are going to happen
[2:28:23] hey man come on when brother Baptist
[2:28:26] spoke with word of creation and
[2:28:27] squirrels came into existence and spoke
[2:28:29] Resurrection to a little fish or did all
[2:28:31] of these things he was not speaking like
[2:28:33] a man he was speaking like a son of God
[2:28:41] he could do that because he knew who he
[2:28:44] was in Christ
[2:28:46] and he placed the scripture Mark 11 22
[2:28:50] for you
[2:28:52] your ministry
[2:28:58] amen
[2:29:00] God's object was never a prophet
[2:29:05] his object was to bring forth a word
[2:29:08] born bride
[2:29:11] a bride who would be born of the word
[2:29:13] the message he brought
[2:29:16] as the end times Prophet receives repeat
[2:29:19] and I'm quoting brother Branham even
[2:29:21] house the first floor Runner came from
[2:29:23] the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb
[2:29:25] of God the four the second Forerunner
[2:29:28] will do the same by pointing the people
[2:29:30] to a word-born bride
[2:29:32] whoo
[2:29:34] did you hear that
[2:29:36] he would come along and as Jesus said or
[2:29:39] as John said Behold the Lamb of God
[2:29:44] he said desperate Runner would point
[2:29:47] to a word born bride
[2:29:51] a bride who would be born of the message
[2:29:54] that was brought restored
[2:29:57] now so the second Forerunner points to a
[2:30:00] word born bride she is
[2:30:03] Jesus Christ in action
[2:30:08] upon the Earth
[2:30:10] she under her messenger
[2:30:14] is the final voice to the final age
[2:30:21] as brother Bradham said the voice will
[2:30:24] be in the bride you say oh brother
[2:30:25] Brandon was the voice of God sure God
[2:30:27] used his voice to bring a message
[2:30:31] but now you are the voice of God
[2:30:35] that goes against all the deities
[2:30:38] because they only want brother Benham to
[2:30:40] be that but let me just tell you brother
[2:30:42] Brandon said told us you can hear the
[2:30:45] voice of God in the Wind
[2:30:48] said I saw him in nature
[2:30:51] he's in the church he's in the
[2:30:53] individual when a man and the spirit of
[2:30:55] God moves upon him and there's tongues
[2:30:57] in interpretation that's the voice of
[2:30:59] God
[2:31:00] when a man is preaching in the Pulpit
[2:31:03] under the inspiration that is the voice
[2:31:05] of God
[2:31:07] amen but the voice of God is also lived
[2:31:10] through you
[2:31:11] little sister that ain't always spoken
[2:31:13] either
[2:31:14] but it's manifested in a holy life in
[2:31:19] decency and impurity in righteousness
[2:31:22] come on Church
[2:31:24] it's there because you are the voice of
[2:31:27] God to defeat the Devil
[2:31:33] um
[2:31:35] so the bride
[2:31:37] is the final voice
[2:31:39] under her messenger
[2:31:42] to the final age
[2:31:46] brother Branham said the voice of God
[2:31:48] will be in her
[2:31:53] United time and science God is getting
[2:31:56] the church together for a rapture
[2:31:59] to go to the wedding for a great Union
[2:32:01] when God and man will unite for eternity
[2:32:05] when creatures of time
[2:32:07] Unite with the eternal
[2:32:11] did you hear that God is getting the
[2:32:14] church together to be a Rapture to go to
[2:32:17] the wedding for great Union when God and
[2:32:20] man will unite for eternity when
[2:32:22] creatures of time Unite with eternal
[2:32:26] life it was once done in the form of a
[2:32:29] son of man the son of man on the earth
[2:32:31] and he had to give his life to bring
[2:32:33] about a power to unite other men with
[2:32:36] the same power for the Bride of Jesus
[2:32:38] Christ so did you hear that
[2:32:41] Jesus was a creature of time
[2:32:43] United with eternal in the form of son
[2:32:46] of man and he gave his life
[2:32:49] in order that to unite other men with
[2:32:53] the same power so to be the Bride of
[2:32:55] Jesus Christ
[2:32:57] so how does it happen that sinful man
[2:33:01] could become the full expression of the
[2:33:04] word of God
[2:33:08] brother Branham tells us it's by Blood
[2:33:13] he compared it to bleach which he called
[2:33:16] Clorox
[2:33:19] and he said you women you use Clorox I
[2:33:23] said I got a tub of Clorox if I drop a
[2:33:26] drop of ink into that bucket of Clorox
[2:33:28] now try to find the color
[2:33:30] what happened to it the first thing it
[2:33:33] did it hit the Clorox that chemical was
[2:33:36] so great till it sent it all the way
[2:33:38] back
[2:33:39] you can't even see fumes of it or
[2:33:41] nothing else it's gone it'll never be no
[2:33:44] more
[2:33:46] because it's turned back to the original
[2:33:48] place where it's come from
[2:33:50] and now that's exactly what the blood
[2:33:52] Jesus Christ does to sin
[2:33:55] the blood of Jesus Christ confess your
[2:33:57] sin upon the blood of Jesus Christ it
[2:34:00] omits and puts in the sea of
[2:34:02] forgetfulness to be no more remembered
[2:34:04] against you at all not where is the
[2:34:07] church today Brethren if we're born to
[2:34:09] be sons of God the Bible Jesus and
[2:34:11] himself into your own voice and your
[2:34:13] Gods amateur Gods with control of the
[2:34:16] earth if they call them God who the were
[2:34:18] the Lord of God come to which was the
[2:34:21] prophets of word the Lord comes to the
[2:34:22] prophet and you call him God how can you
[2:34:24] condemn me when I say I'm the son of God
[2:34:27] now the blood of bulls and goats
[2:34:32] could give up power to Moses
[2:34:37] to go out there by Commission of God and
[2:34:40] stretch forth his rod and say let her
[2:34:43] come flies
[2:34:44] that happened under the blood of bulls
[2:34:46] and goats he had the word and he spoke
[2:34:48] that word when he did it it become God's
[2:34:52] thought of the words of thought
[2:34:53] expressed and so when God thought it put
[2:34:55] it into Moses mind and he spoke it it
[2:34:58] become a word and then Moses turned
[2:35:00] around and went back maybe not I'm
[2:35:02] flying the country in an hour from then
[2:35:03] maybe in a little green fly began to
[2:35:06] buzz around and a half an hour was 10
[2:35:08] pounds per square yard what was it the
[2:35:11] creative word of God that was spoke by
[2:35:14] the lips of a mortal man
[2:35:18] God uses men
[2:35:20] God could have used the son to preach
[2:35:22] the gospel but God could have used the
[2:35:24] wind to preach the gospel but God chose
[2:35:27] men to preach the gospel
[2:35:29] and he said what's the matter with the
[2:35:32] church today there's something wrong my
[2:35:34] opinion we're not coming with that
[2:35:36] sincerity to do the right thing for that
[2:35:40] if God could do that under the blood of
[2:35:42] bulls and goats and and that only
[2:35:45] covered sin and made a perpetuation for
[2:35:47] The Sinner but the sin was still there
[2:35:50] only covered over what could he do with
[2:35:52] the blood of his son that omits sin God
[2:35:56] is Not manufactured but he created a
[2:35:58] blood that takes away all sin
[2:36:04] now come into something right here
[2:36:07] Moses commission was to plague those
[2:36:11] Egyptian Devils until they let God's
[2:36:14] people go
[2:36:17] how many can say Amen to that
[2:36:19] our commission
[2:36:21] under this Blood
[2:36:23] is to cast out devils
[2:36:26] lay hands on the sick
[2:36:28] they shall recover
[2:36:31] amen you'll make serpents powerless
[2:36:34] and the poison that Satan uses against
[2:36:37] you will be rendered power
[2:36:42] Hallelujah let me just say you serpents
[2:36:46] there's a power in this bride
[2:36:49] that will render your poison harmless
[2:36:53] [Applause]
[2:36:55] Hallelujah and I commission is to cast
[2:36:58] out devils
[2:36:59] make serpents powerless
[2:37:04] now look
[2:37:06] when the apostles were given the first
[2:37:08] Commission
[2:37:09] Jesus started out with the first
[2:37:11] commission he gave his disciples
[2:37:14] and he sent him out

[2:37:19] good news

[2:37:26] and preach the gospel tell them the good
[2:37:28] news that this that the Messiah had come

[2:37:35] remitted sin had ascended into glory and
[2:37:39] sent back the Holy Ghost and would make
[2:37:41] you a witness of his resurrection
[2:37:44] but now when the apostles followed his
[2:37:47] first commission Luke chapter 10 verse
[2:37:50] 18.
[2:37:51] and he said unto them I bailed Satan as
[2:37:56] Lightning falled from Heaven behold I
[2:37:58] give you power

[2:38:13] before the blood is shed
[2:38:16] come on now after the bloody shed is it
[2:38:20] less power or more power

[2:38:29] blood amen able to speak a word of
[2:38:32] creation and he gives you power to tread
