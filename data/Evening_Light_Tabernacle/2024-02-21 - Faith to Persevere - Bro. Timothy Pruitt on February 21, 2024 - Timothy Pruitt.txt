and minister to our hearts and touch our needs tonight Lord as only you can Lord and come Lord I ask father that you would come and Lord no doubt if I asked if hands would be lifted all over this building you would there' be all over lord lifted up asking for needs and situations Lord that we can't handle or we can't do anything about but Lord there's nothing too hard for you because you're so great we ask Lord that you would just come and touch each life Lord according to your word and according to their needs Lord those that are sick at home those that are shut in Lord each need father we just reach out to you Lord and ask God you'd move and you would touch we ask it in Jesus name amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen to be together in the midweek is just a wonderful thing to just kind of come and let off the pressure for a minute and allow the Lord to uh move and touch hearts and lives and amen we're just thankful to serve a god like he is because there's no one like him amen and what a great God he is amen let's turn in our Bibles to Matthew chapter 15 and verse 22 amen amen he says and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and cried to him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughters grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word and the disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us but he answered and said I'm not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast C it to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from the master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour amen we'll let you be seated amen I want to speak to you on faith to persevere amen Faith to persevere look looking at the meaning of perseverance it says it's an continued effort to do or achieve something despite the difficulties and failures or the opposition it's the action or cont or condition or an instance of persevering amen a steadfastness and you know I I got to look and we know the CH the faith chapters Hebrews chapter 11 and and I I I just got to look at on uh different times the Bible spoke about perseverance and I found it pretty interesting to me that at the end of Hebrews chapter 10 and then at the beginning of Hebrews chapter 12 it would actually be a theme that Paul had on perseverance and it says here in Hebrews chap 10:35 it says cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward for you have need of patience and this patience is the same word it's a steadfastness or a perseverance that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise so he's saying if you don't have patience or you don't have perseverance then you're going to give up and you're not going to receive what you have need of Amen because as we talked about before what Jesus said when I come will I find find faith and and and we we we look at that many times at the end times sometimes about when it returns turns will he find somebody that's still believing but when he comes and answers your need or your request will he find you still there in faith believing amen that he's still going to come and answer your need and this is what he says here he said for yet a little while and he that shall will shall come will come and will not te T but now that now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto predition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul and and I I I want to just read that and amplify because I think it just brings out some some great points it says there again in chapter 10 and verse 35 it sayso not therefore fling away your Fearless confidence for it has a glorious and great reward for you have great need of patient endurance to bear under difficult ult circumstances without compromising so that when you have carried out the will of God you will receive and enjoy the full what is Promised for yet a little very little while he who is coming will come and will not delay but my righteous one the one that's justified by faith shall live by faith amen my righteous my righteous one the one justified by faith shall live by faith and if he draws back or shrinks in fear my soul has no Delight in him but our way is not that of those who shrink back to destruction but we are of those who believe that's amen I love that our way is not that of those who shrink back to destruction but we are of those who believe relying on God through faith in Jesus Christ and by this confidence in faith preserve our soul amen and also in Hebrews chapter 20 chapter 12 and verse one it says wherefore seeing we are also comp compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him and endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God and I want to read again in the Amplified it says therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses who by faith have testified to the truth of God's absolute faithfulness stripping off every unnecessary weight and the sin which so easily and cleverly entangles us let us run with endurance and active persistence the race that is set before us looking away from all that will distract us and focusing our eyes on Jesus who is the author and the perfector of Faith the first incentive of our for our belief and the one who brings our faith to maturity who for the joy of accomplishing the goal set before him enduring the cross disregarding the shame and sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God revealing his deity his authority and the completion of his work amen so to it's not just to have faith but it's to have faith that perseveres amen faith that holds on no matter what the situation is around us you know it's really easy to have faith when things are good and you're not sick and then there's you know plenty of money in the bank account but what about having faith amen when you're going through difficulties of life and and we're all going to go through them we it's a it's a struggle of life that we're in it's not going to get any easier or any better but it's going to get harder and harder until we cross over onto the other side but I believe there's a people that amen are not of those who's going to shrink back but they're going to be of those who's going to believe as going to believe no matter what the circumstances are no matter what the situation is around them no matter what the atmospheres are around them but to Stand Fast therefore in the calling of that God is placed in their life and and I read also in James 1 and verse 12 it says bless or happy or spiritually prosperous and favored by God is the man who is steadfast under trial amen steadfast under trial and perseveres when tempted for when he has passed the test and been approved he will receive the Crown of Life with the Lord has promised to those who love him amen so blessed or happy or spiritually prosperous or or favored by God as the man who is steadfast under a trial in other words when you go through a trial it doesn't change what you believe it doesn't change who you are it doesn't change anything about you but you you persevere you push through it you go through it no matter what I I believe we ought to be those kind of people amen I know it's very easy to kind of give up and put get depressed and all that kind of stuff that the things that we go through in our lives but these opport these things that we're going through only opportunities for God to test our faith to test if we really believe who he is if we we really believe he's a provider if we we really believe he's a Healer if we really believe amen if if our names could be written in Hebrews chap 11 amen if our names could be written there amen is by faith Enoch or by faith Timothy or by faith John or by faith who whatever your name is tonight amen by faith they stood there in the midst of their trials in the darkest age there ever was Amen in the time of of great turmoil and Wars of rumors of wars and they didn't give up they didn't turn around they didn't shrink back from their place and their calling but they were steadfast in the faith that God had given them and I I believe that's the kind of people God is looking for he he's looking for real soldiers amen not somebody that gets in the middle of a fight and wants to cow down and and back off somewhere but somebody that'll stand in front of it and say this is what God has called me to be this is who God has called me to amen as a child of God I'm a Son of God it doesn't matter what I'm going through it doesn't matter what situations around me I believe anyhow I believe he will provide I believe he will heal I believe he will deliver whatever my need of is I believe he can do what he said he would do amen you know I I look at this little woman this little greek woman you know she had heard of maybe how Jesus had healed different ones and maybe you know is uh reputation had gotten around and and she hadd heard of different children getting delivered so there's something inside of that you know because faith comes by hearing and and she begin to believe well if he could do it for them then he can do it for my daughter you know and Faith you know finds a source that others don't see it finds something to Anchor to that your feelings can't express or or your thoughts can't bring it all into words it doesn't you know you can't see it you can't taste it you can't feel but faith is standing there when she heard she believed she she might have heard maybe of a neighbor's daughter that being healed of epilepsy or or or or maybe something else had taken place and here her daughter needed healing and she had heard Jesus could do it and she believe that he could and no matter how much other people didn't believe it didn't hinder her faith amen because she had a source that was something on the inside that had been revealed to her that God was able to heal God was able to deliver he said when a man's got faith in God he's got a hold of something he can't explain that's right amen he's got a hold of something he can't explain it's something he's got a hold of he can't push it shove it pull it it takes him that's the way faith is when a man really got faith in God it finds a source that others don't see amen this Greek woman had heard these words she had believed it she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have hindrances amen there was hindrances that came across her path but her faith stood strong she she she was going to push through anyhow amen you know you got faith if you got a faith that knows no defeat it's a positive thing to you so it doesn't matter what hindrance comes or if the doctor's report gets worse or are the symptoms gets worse that has nothing to do with faith faith is not anchored on a doctor's report faith is not anchored on a symptom whether it's good or whether it's bad faith is anchored in the unfailing word of God and the word says by his stripes I'm Healed period amen so some of them might have said you know uh you know some hindrance might have been well you know he wasn't even he's of A different race you're not the right race you're a Greek you're sarapan you're he's a Jew so he wasn't even sent to you you know in other words brother Bram said like this he said in other words your your denomination's not you're not part of this revival or your church is not part of this move you're you you're not part of this but she was H he said but she was a human being and she had been created by God and she had a need and God could meet that need amen she had faith that she was going to get it whether a denomination her denomination was cooperating with it or her church was or or her family was it didn't make no difference to her she had a need and she was going to get to him and he said maybe another hindrance was somebody would say well it's too late you know days of Miracles are passed there's no more miracles no more it might have been no more for them but for her she still believed and that's the way I look at it you want to say days of Miracles are pass Five they're over for you but for me in my house I still believe he can do Miracles I still believe he can heal and bring deliverances it doesn't matter what anybody else says it matters what his word said but something in her kept pushing forward something in her kept going forward you know something inside of her told her she was going to get what she asked for amen you know he said all people tonight if you can only hold that in your heart that God is here to give you the desire of your heart amen if you'll meet his conditions nothing to stand there might have been a bunch of women coming and said well look sister Lydia he said might have been her name I don't know do you understand that your husband will leave you if you do this no doubt but what she loved her husband but she couldn't curse or bless that which was in her something was telling her she had to get to Jesus so her daughter could live amen and when she got there something was going to take place husband or no husband amen some of us got to make those kind of choices amen husband or no husband wife or no wife I got to get to Jesus amen it doesn't matter if I got family or no family or I got this one that loves me or they don't love me matters not I want to get to Jesus some of them might have said well what are you going to do with this Afflicted child if this fails if it don't work if if you don't get what you're looking for she knew something inside of her knew it wasn't going to fail cuz she saw him that he was more than just a man that that was God veiled in human flesh some said well you know the circle you belong to they're going to draw you out and and Society is going you know your people's going to laugh at you well laugh or no laugh it made no difference something was inside of her and she was going to push through amen some of them might have said well you'll be put out of your church put out or not put out she was going to go on her road to Jesus there was something something that was going to take place nothing was going to stand in her way no hindrance she was persevering and finally she arrived where he was that's right and you think now she got to where he was now she's going to get what she needed and he said many people think just because you get to where he at it's over with that's wrong he can come here in this building tonight and show himself Alive by after 2,000 of years by the things he promised to do he did it he does it every night he does it everywhere he proves he's still alive you can be in his presence but that's not all of it come on somebody you can be in his presence but that's not all of it you got to push through that come on somebody amen you push through a lot to get here tonight but when you get into his presence there's more pushing to do there's more perseverance to do it's not just sit there on your padded Pew and and enjoy a a 30 minute Ted talk or something no I want I want to get to Jesus I don't want to just get to my Pew I don't want to just get to my church I don't want to just get to A good sermon I want to get to Jesus I don't care if I have family or no family or this that another this one laughs at me or no laugh I could care less when I get into his presence I want to get to Jesus am sometimes you might fa you meet difficulty when you come into His presence boy that fell over right just like a brick didn't it well I thought I got in his presence and it's all good now no he said sometimes you meet difficulty when you come into His presence she did when she arrived then Jesus he was you know then Jesus said he wasn't even sent to race the very one she come believing in turned her down he said this is a lesson she' been through all the gates of Sorrow she'd been through the gates of disappointment something impulsa inside her but when she got to him he turned her down flat and he said her race was nothing but a bunch of dogs it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and feed it to you dogs he said what what if he had called the Pentecostal dogs and I'll bring it on current what if he called you a dog well I tell you what I got somewhere else I can go to church I tell you what I a I don't I I ain't got to listen to that I I don't come on now what what if he had said you Methodist dogs you Baptist dogs you method you message dogs you bunch of dogs I what is even sent to you but but if you got a hold of something and something's got a hold of you you will stay right there that's right I'm not sent to you race of dogs it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to you I'm not sent to you your your company's not even sponsoring this you're not a part of what I'm doing it isn't me for me to take my time with you you're nothing but a dog my why should I waste my time on you what a dis disappointment that have been to a woman who didn't have faith all right come on somebody what what a disappointment that would have been to a woman that didn't have faith that wasn't determined listen it's going to take a determination to make a Rapture it's going to take a determination Amen to get something out of this service tonight it's going to take a determination to make it another day and then when he don't come when we ask we want to just give up well I tell you what I asked him and he ain't said nothing he's wanting to see will I find faith when I come will there be somebody still there knocking amen what but she held on she wasn't see the different was and this is a quote she wasn't a hot house plant that had to be babied amen we we going to get through this little part right here and then we'll get to some good stuff later but let's go through it while we're here one of these kinds you have to be sprayed over he said see a good healthy plant you don't have to spray it a good healthy plant a bug won't get into it's full of Health a good Born Again faith in God a real genuine Holy Ghost Faith nothing's going to turn it down that's right or turn it away or turn it back it can't do it it's persistent it's going to go to the goal that God promised it would have nothing is going to turn it around it's going to go anyhow she wasn't a hybrid that's right you know brother BR said today we got hybrids talk about hybrid corn he said I see the signs out here it's no good it's killing people said look at reader digest he said they wrote a article said if women keep on eating and what's going to happen they won't have their babies no more 20 years from now they won't be able to hardly give birth to children just breaking it down cancers will be able to take hold more and more boy well I tell you what we've seen a lot of that happening everything the whole thing's worm eating Jesus said God said in the beginning let every seed bring forth of its kind you take a hybrid corn and hyb a corn seed and hybrid it and plant it plant the same seed next year you got nothing you might have a better looking grain you might have a better maybe a a better looking Leaf but you got nothing it's hybrid he said you take a Jack and you hybrid it to a may you got a mule but a mule can't breed itself back there's no life inside of him amen he's most and he said he's the most ignorant thing on the earth he said I've drove him all my life he'll wait till his last Dy minute to kick you amen he don't know nothing you can teach him nothing you can talk to him till you bleue in the face he said like a lot a lot of so-called Christians with their ears sticking out ha haa Brave pray pray days of Miracles are pass no such a thing as healing but you he said you don't know but he don't know where he come from he don't know who his papa is or his mama is he said but a real genuine Thor thoroughbred horse knows who his papa his mama his grandpa his great grandpa his great great great all the way back he knows where he come from and so does a genuine born again Christian know where he come from his origin was not with John Wesley or Luther or somebody else it began on the day of Pentecost when God himself came down among the people he is the word made manifest other on say well I don't know about that see that's a donkey hybrid direct quote I know this stuff ain't popular no more and it ain't politically correct but it come to the wrong spot to get political correctness I'm about sick of that spirit Spirit what that is it don't want you to call black black and white white wrong wrong and right right a bunch of gray stuff like it's a it's the first signs of the pale horse rider it's all mixed everything's right and nothing's wrong that's aive Satan sin is still sin God still feels the same way toward sin today as he did millions of years ago he hasn't changed man's changed people get their feelings hurt because a pastor preaches a little hard well you wouldn't have lasted in that sermon come on it's the truth she was no hybrid plant she got a hold of something talking about this woman again he you don't have to Baby her now darling please let me beg you you should come on down to church everything every no sir everything tried to hinder her and he said a real Christian fights for his position he has to stand alone him and gar but he'll fight every inch of ground you don't have to Baby him around that's the matter with the Pentecostal church today we got Pentecostal babies that's just been sprinkled and sprayed with this and that and other till it's run out a bunch of hybrids what we need today is a house cleaning from the pull pit all the way to the janitor and start over again get some genuine Faith born in the people again she wasn't a hybrid or so-called crop of Believers is today what did she do she admitted you're right whatever he calls me he's right there you go come on whatever God calls me he's right amen she admitted he's right the faith always admits the word is right if your faith don't punctuate every word of God with an amen there's something wrong with your experience the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever if you don't say Amen there's something wrong The Works that I do shall you do also if it don't say Amen there's something wrong it if it don't punctuate the word of God promised with an amen there's something wrong but she admitted he's right you know there a real problem with people who can't admit they're ever wrong something wrong with their experience it's always somebody else's fault for the way they are so you know it's always somebody else's fault for where they're at and what they're going through and all this stuff somebody else's fault hybrids amen she admitted she wasn't nothing but a dog but she was after a crumb wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't be us no no we'd have to sit on the right seat if they don't Minister me tonight I'll not go back the next night see what a difference it was she put put back and shoved back shoved out put aside outside she was determined she was persistent she was persevering something on the inside of her told her she was going to get it regardless of how long she had to wait what she had to go through what she had to deal with she was going to get it anyhow she was after the crumb she didn't have to have the full course dinner she said yes you're right Lord the but the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table that's the way to do it don't take the high seat take the back seat amen I ain't talking about the backseat in the church either talking about high seat low seat amen be the lowly one ain't talking about some false humility either I'm talking about really submitting yourself to the word of God and saying Lord I you're I'm wrong and you're right amen just be the little person the way up Up Is Down amen always he that humbles himself shall be exalted he exalts himself shall be obeed the Way Up Is Down always remember she never even seen a miracle before she was a gentile but she had Faith she had heard about it and and and faith comes by hearing and she had the right approach to God's Gift that's the only way to ever receive anything is come with the right approach she was first Gentile that a miracle was ever performed on faith admidst the word is right it's humbled and reverent and the same as today be willing to take any part any part anywhere just so I get there come on but that right there needs to be wrote on all of our walls be willing to take any part in anywhere just so I get there if I got to be the footwash funky it doesn't matter as long as I got a spot at that table if I got to be the lowest of the lowest I could care less as long as I got a seat at that table that's all I care about doesn't matter if I got my name written in the in the in the highlights or some sign somewhere or this that and other or on some poster that matters not it matters not if my name's on a flly and my picture's on a flly that has nothing to do with it I could care less what I care about is being there on that day when the dead in Christ rise and I know when something's happened I ain't I ain't caught unawares and I don't know what's that is going on and I don't know nothing about it I want to know when they rise cuz when they rise I'm going to be changed to be just like them so it don't matter what we got to do or who we are or who we ain't as far as humanly speaking what matters is who we are sons of God and who we ain't are children of the devil there was a it was a brother Brandon was pre preaching down in Mexico youall know the story several thousand people had gathered brother ESP espo espanosa was down there and he was he was his interpreter and there come an old blind man into the across the platform couldn't see at all and he said I look I had good shoes on and good clothes and he had ragged trialers all tore off and old hats sewed up and his blind white beard hanging down his old big old feet maybe had hadn't had shoes on in years Dusty all over totally blind I thought my dad would be about his age if he had lived I slipped over to him I said how do you do brother Espinosa interpreted I set my foot up beside him to find out you know checking to see if his foot was the same size he'd give him his shoes but my foot was much larger or his foot was much larger than mine I put my shoulders up against him I was going to put my arms around him my shoulders were wider his shoulders wider than mine I'd seen that I couldn't even give him my coat thought God what can I do poor old fell probably hasn't had a decent meal in his life there he was eating old rejected tortillas down there somewhere but yet had spent the what little money you had to get a grease candle and burn a million dollar on a million dollar gold Altar for sins living such Superstition and darkness is that and I thought what a time why can fate be so evil and I put my arm around I said oh God have mercy on him about that time time I heard Glory adios and about that time I looked around and he could see his good good as I could running across a platform next night there was a rack of old clothes and Sh Shaws and and hats about three or 4 foot high like this all the way across how they ever knew who that belonged to he said I I don't even think they I don't even think they care they come to church that morning about 8 or 9:00 no ceas to sit down right there in the pouring down rain just leaning up against one another women with their hair all hanging down holding their children things pouring down rain by 9:00 I wouldn't be there till 8 8:30 or 9 that night 8:00 in the morning in the rain 8:30 or 9 that night you talking about some perseverance amen they'd be sure they was going to get but they wanted to be sure they had a place there they they want to be sure to be able to stand there and they were waiting till I come in and said they let me they would let me down on a rope ladder on the back Arena and and and I walk out to the platform and Billy calling a man I call Manana which means tomorrow cuz he was always so slow to come get me so he said I called him Manana CU I say just come tomorrow cuz you done Ru today so he brought me over there and he let me down and I come in on a platform and brother Jack Mo many of you know him he was with me and brother Espinosa and several of the Brethren and when we're standing on the platform Billy come and I I heard that great row thousand time thousands sitting there and he said Daddy you have to do something there's a little Spanish woman over here she got a dead baby in her arms and that baby died apparently this morning they say early and Manana gave out all the prayer cards and he ain't got a prayer card and and I ain't got one and she's determined to bring that baby into the prayer line and said we got about 400 already in line I said well just make her stay back cuz she gets ahead they'll start every one of them doing that and we can't do that and tell her to get back in line maybe tomorrow and we we we're going to be here tomor tomorrow give her a prayer card then he said you come over and try it said I got 300 ushers there that can't hold her and said she weighs maybe 90 lbs and you can't hold her she runs between the legs she jumps over the shoulders amen and everything while carrying this dead baby you're talking about persistence perseverance say whatever block it doesn't matter I I got to get lied I got to be there and I said brother Jack she don't know me want you to go down there and you pray for her and and said he so he said I wouldn't and I was speaking on faith being the substance of things hope for and as I was speaking and the translator was translating brother Jack started down to pray for the baby and I looked right in front of me and there was this little Mexican baby with no teeth was so little smiling looking at me laughing a vision I said wait a minute brother Jack bring that baby here and so they opened up the way and here comes this little woman with prayer beads in her head hand falling on the floor holling Padre Padre I said don't do that stand up and I asked her when the baby died and said it died that morning in the doctor's office about 9:30 or 10:00 and and 9 9:00 about 9:00 that morning here it's about 10:00 the same night and then she was soaking wet and just drenched with everything and and you know maybe it was her first baby she looked maybe 25 years old I said brother espanosa don't don't interpret this prayer but I've seen a vision of this little dead baby out here laughing at me it might be the baby it might be the baby it might be the baby and I put my hands upon the little blanket I said dear heavenly father I don't know if this is the vision or not but I seen that little baby you're ready to call it back to life then I call for its life in the name of Jesus Christ and about that time it let out a yell and kicked that blanket and been screaming to the top of its voice but what would have happened if that little mama would have gave up that's right it'd be a tombstone somewhere written with his name on it maybe if it was that lucky might be an unmarked grave somewhere but that woman had a need and she had heard a blind man had been given his sight and said if God could do that he can raise my baby to life and there wasn't enough ushers in the building it wasn't enough anything to keep her from receiving what had been placed inside of her heart oh God if we could come with that same intensity to the service God I have a need it might not be a dead little baby but it might be a dead child out there somewhere it might be a dead St deadness in your own life and you say God I have a need I got to get there there ain't enough Devils to stop me I'll climb over them I'll climb under them I'll run through them whatever I have to get to Jesus I've got to get to where he's at that's right she was persistent nothing was going to stop her she was perseverant though a priest would have put her out of her church no matter what happened she happened to be looking at the fence a few nights before she seen an old blind looking at the fence a few nights before she seen an old blind man receive a sight and if God could give sight to the blind he'd raised the dead she had a need she was persistent like this saraph phenician woman and she got her desire because she was perseverant you know it's amazing sometimes we will can fight through all kind of adversity to get to the house of God and then give up and get back in the same car with the same needs and the same situations and never talk it over with him because we got into his presence but it's more than that it's pushing through the violent takes by force amen there's a perseverance there's a persistence there there's something in a drive on the inside I don't come just to sing a few songs I don't come just to hear some good music I don't come just to see everybody I come to see Jesus and to have a conference with him that he can come and meet me we said before you got five senses in your body God gave those senses see taste feel smell and here to contact your Earthly home but that has nothing to do with god well you see taste or you usually I just use these two maybe three see feel or here and we think that contacts God sure you they can be uh made a you know the senses can come to have a reaction when God comes no doubt but whether you see him whether you feel him or whether you he hear him that has nothing to do with God's here or not what has to do with with God is here or not is what his word said and his word said he would be so where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be so amen he promised he would but we got to understand that when we get here it's not just the end of story but there's got to be a press there's got to be a push there's got to be amen a a moving into into other Realms you know so so easily we get to this play we you know we we we fought whatever I don't know what all you fought to get here bad moods no supper whatever car trouble late on late at work still going to push through and you get here but then all of a sudden our minds are Waring with this over here and and before you know we've been distracted for 20 minutes and we missed all what's been happening it happens we get to thinking about tomorrow and next week and what all has happened maybe yesterday and what we got to do what's going on and all the stuff has happened and before you don't let's all stand wow where have I been and we totally missed our moments and our time because we allowed something else and we became we allowed some somebody something to stand in our way now this this little woman this little Mexican woman she was facing physical things physical ushers physical Gates physical rain physical things that was trying to block her but maybe it ain't necessarily physical things tonight but de the devil is constantly there trying to stop the word of God trying to hinder it trying to stop the moving of the spirit trying to keep things back cuz he he really don't care if you come to church he comes to church he just want to make sure you don't receive something while you're at church so all of our taste and feel smell and hear that has nothing to do with God although we rely on them faith is something different faith is the six sense when you contact God and you can only contact God by the six sense which is Faith you can't even please him without faith these senses was given you to contact this Earthly home they were not by they were by no means to lead you what if I refuse to look anymore and I just bound up my eyes and I said I refuse to look finally I'd go blind and that's when my bo boy comes in I tie his eyes up no sir there's no such a thing as sight and I tie his eyes up next thing you know my father told me there's no such a thing as sight so I tie up my boy's eyes first thing you know our generation would become born blind if you don't use your six sense they become dormant amen that's why the devil wants to keep you on these five senses because he wants that six sense to become dormant in your life to where you can't really contact God that you can't declare he's here when you don't feel that you can't declare he's here when you don't see him so that's what the church has done to the six sense God put in them he just placed Faith Off In Miracles and signs and things that context God that gives them the Holy Ghost and things he places it off over there back off somewhere else till that thing has become dead this one said there wasn't no more healings this one said there wasn't pretty soon they rais raising up Generations that don't even believe in God how do you think we got to where we at because somebody has tied of knots over their eyes and refuse to look around them and say God's there God's there God's there God's there nature declares God the stars and the universe declares God but somehow we got whole Generations today that doesn't even believe in him why for because for Generations they have tied their eyes shut and this has happened spiritually as well churches are tying their eyes shut there the the eye that can see the ear that can hear they're putting their fingers in it their spiritual fingers in their ear and they don't want to hear things of God no more and pretty soon they're raising up Generations that doesn't want anything to do with God anymore that comes to just have a feel-good time you know a simple Church how do we get to a simp simple church cuz people put their finger in their ears cuz they put blinders over their eyes and they refused to see what God was doing among them until they've come now to where they got the Gospel According to Michael Jackson and they got the New Year's Revolution according to the Beatles that's the church right there in sh Port Louisiana The Simple Church how did they get there cuz for Generations they've closed their eyes and willfully looked away from the things God has done to now they're being born without eyes born without ears brother that's what the church has done to the six sense they just placed Faith Off Miracles and things like that off what it used to do you say well God's A Healer oh what about that God God a he God's a heal well if he ever was a Healer he's still a Healer if he ever was a savior he's still a savior if he ever was God he's still God so see the lack of faith that's been preaching to the people that makes them let this six sense or this Faith lay dormant and through the year they'll run out be sick run the doctor say doctor I got something wrong with me doctor look at this say he'll try a man that's a good man that's a good honest doctor will work just as patiently as he can with all the power that God has given him to operate with do the things you should do to help you then the first thing you know it advances on well I I just have doctors I just have to tell you there's nothing more I can do if you want to go to another doctor go see him well then you go to another doctor it says nothing can be done it's too far Advanced he said that's the time that's the time to call on the six sense that's the time to accept God that's the time to rely upon the spirit of faith that God has put in you the super sense is the holy spirit it is the faith Faith Of God that dwells in you I like that it's the faith of God that dwells in you he he imparted if you got the you got the Holy Ghost then the faith of God lives inside of you the same faith that had faith enough to believe Let There Be amen if you let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it that will guide you and bring all these other senses under the control of that super for is so far above a natural sense as a spiritual man is above the natural it is far as high as the heavens is above the natural man in his five senses it makes you believe things you will never see it makes you act the where you think the you never act the devil can get in those five senses he can lie to you but he cannot touch the faith of God he cannot touch that super sense it's far beyond his reach now you're only going to get this if you're born again you won't receive it you might receive a belief you might receive a religion but unless you're born again you will not receive the faith of God Amen because it it's it's it's not something that can be handed down by generation to generation as much as one parent would love to give it to their children we can't do that but they must each be born again by the the power of God you cannot believe until you're regenerated or born again the whole Bible says no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost amen see it's until then you're just taking what somebody else said or you learn by some intellectual understanding or you learn by a natural way or five senses but when the six sense comes in the Holy Spirit it takes away all reasonings it lifts you up into that place to make you believe things you can't see you can't taste you can't feel feel you can't smell or you can't hear it does something to you then you can say Jesus is the Christ why because you've witnessed it for yourself not some intellectual teaching that's been taught but you haven't been you have experienced it for yourself the six sense six cense will go to work he said some unbeliever some Infidel might come to you and look around and look at here no such a thing as a holy ghost you're just mistaken you're crazy just believe there's no such a thing is that he said that's when the six sense are we going to go to work let me show you in the bible let me show you in the Bible where you can receive the Holy Ghost and when whether the promise is not to your children well let me show you in the Bible where it says it is amen but the six sense knows better than to believe that nonsense it's inside of you it they've said it too late late you've already see that the people who talk say there's no such a thing as the Holy Spirit they don't know what they're talking about cuz they've never experienced it it's like we've said it before no man is at the mercy of no man with an experience is at the mercy of someone with just merely an argument if you've experienced it you've been there they can say what they want to say you know it'd be like somebody coming to me and say you know in the middle of Homer ain't nothing in the middle of that that that that that little thing that goes around and around all them buildings around there ain't no Courthouse there there ain't nothing there it's all it's all just taken down and they got they got you know some certain whatever some kind of Monument there now they can say all they want to I've experienced it I've been there I know what it's like I live there amen so you can say what you want to say about about what it what it looks like but if you ain't never been there amen you can't say what really is there and that's the same thing with the Holy Ghost if you haven't been there you can say it's this or is this or is this and you can call it all the names in the book you want to but unless you've experienced for yourself then you don't know what you're talking about right it's kind of like brother Brown love this illustration is Infidel talking this big talk about not being no God and there this little boy peeling the apple he said I want to ask you a question he said okay a little simple looking boy didn't look like a little delinquent maybe with hair hanging down his face maybe one tooth out old dirty overall jacket on one one question just one question Infidel said well I had just said there's no sense such a thing as God is just emotion there's no there nonsense and the boy said I ask you a question is this apple sweet or is it sour he said how do I know I'm not eating it he said just what I thought took himself another bite he said how do you know when you ain't taste to the Lord how do you know when you never receive the Holy Ghost whether he's real or whether he's not how do you know where there's faith and power if you never experienced it how do you know if there not joy unspeakable and full of Glory when you've never tasted it but if you tasted it you know what it tastes like then if you tasted it you could care less what anybody else's opinion is about it I know I was there I was there when it came I was there when the spirit came I know who he [Music] is there's no intellectual Powers will ever bring that out of you the intellectual Powers reasons well maybe it's just psychology maybe just workup maybe it's just emotion maybe it's you know just working the people up but he said but when the six sense comes in it denies all those things and moves a person straight into the bosom of God he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he's reward to those that diligently seek Him by faith Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob all by faith it's the six sense that does that you get prayed for let's say you got a crippled hand you get prayed for and you and you come up here and nothing seems to happen you you don't feel different in that hand old natural man begin to say well you know what you don't feel no different matter of fact it's worse but the six sents to say that's a lie you've been prayed for it's healed it's settled amen he said like a woman that came to our meeting one time and she she was there was two of them actually neighbors and you know the story is but these two ladies coming to the pray line and this one had a stomach problem and she was suffering really bad she couldn't eat and and and and and the discernment began to tell her who she was and where she lived and what her problem was and her face just lit up and said that's nothing but the truth and the Holy Spirit said to me it's a ulcer and it's caused from a nervous condition he've been examined by a certain doctor and he said you you you would have to have an operation have it cut out she said every word of that is true and seeing she was such a great believer then it said your name is Miss so and so and you come from such and such place she said that's the truth what was it it was a six catching it the six sense and the Holy Spirit was standing side by side the Holy Spirit was speaking and the six sense was saying amen it's when the word saw the word amen there it is something has to happen that's right now are you going to reason all of that or you going to believe it and here she is thus sayth the Lord go home and eat Jesus Christ makes you well she went home that night a friend of hers living in the same neighborhood of third or fourth behind her she had a big knot on her neck and here she come all thrilled about this seeing her neighbor who had been discerned and knew exactly it was exactly the truth and this big knot sticking out of her neck she'd come up and said no one I said no I said no one had to discern that but you're happy about something you're just thrilled why oh that woman that just got just got told about her stomach problem is your neighbor my God because that woman sitting over there rejoicing is a neighbor of yours holy that he said that's the Holy Spirit she thought how in the world could that man know that it has to be something to reveal it to him so when it was said you're thinking about your neck yes do you believe it believe I believe with all my heart thus sayth the Lord go home and you will receive your healing the natural man looked around and didn't see one sign the neck was still just as big the woman with the ulcer went home and tried to eat and she like to died he told her to go home and eat you're healed she went home and tried to eat and she liked to died what if she said well man that's a false guy what in the world's he thinking he almost killed me that wasn't her testimony she said that man knew who I was he told me who I was he told me my address he told me my name he told me I was that my neighbor's neighbor he knew all about it said that wasn't a man that was some God that was God speaking through a man and he said it done something for her to where she begin to begin to to say the Lord is heal when she went through the neighborhood I I'm Healed it's finished are you eating yet no not exactly but by his stripes I'm Healed no matter what it was she was healed anyhow and her husband you know told her honey you ought to quit talking about that healing cuz you know he was a Christian himself you're bringing reproach upon the cause brother said how can you bring a reproach when you're testifying what the word said amen you'll bring a reproach if he don't testify what the word said come on we're not testifying how many people are so willing to testify their feelings and they can be wrong 90% of the time but what about testifying what the word said it doesn't matter what I feel like it matters what he said about me and he said by his stripes I am healed she said that man stood is what she said to her husband that man stood and looked me in the eye and told me my condition and things that I've done and who I was and where I was from I hadn't been in the building 15 minutes when he come to the plat form how in the world could that man know all of that I never seen him in my life and he said thus sayith the Lord you're healed I'll believe that until I'm dead perseverance I'll believe that till I'm dead I'll believe it anyhow and her and her sister a friend her friend had a covenant to God they would hold that faith that morning she gets up she's feeling kind of funny few minutes she gets hungry children had left some oats on the plate little dish said oats just always burn her up if anybody ever had an Ulster you know what it's like reached down took a couple bites said oh my might have to pay for it but by his stripes I'm Healed but she notice she's still hungry so she finished up that dish and she waited a few minutes nothing happened happened but got more hungrier so she fried her a few eggs poured her a cup of coffee got some toast and had herself a real Jubilee she'd just eat all she could eat went ahead and washed the dishes and about an hour a half an hour later she was hungry again and no ill effects she put on her little Bonnet down the street she went when she got there she thought she had been there maybe been a death in the family screaming and shouting and walking around woman had slept late that morning and got up and the growth on her neck was gone and disappeared to the night and she was shaking out the sheet to see if she could find it he said but what happened he said the healing Angel come through the neighborhood Hallelujah and he walked in this house yep when I come there's faith and she received our healing walk to the next house yep there's Faith what if they have gave up just a day before perseverant you have to be you don't know when that healing Angel is going to come through the neighborhood Mercy as this boy I love this testimony been prayed for he asked for some consolation brother Brandon could you give me some consolation he said 'yes sir son polio got you this way he said that's right your name is such and such you come from a certain place that's right but what about my healing I said by his stripes you're healed he just told him the word he went home testifying giving God praise said they brought such a reproach they claim in the neighborhood until one Sunday a group of ministers came in and sat by and said you got to stop doing that you're bringing reproach upon the cause he said mister if you sitting where I'm sitting if you were in the same chair that I'm sitting in you wouldn't rob me of The Last Hope I've got in Christ Jesus and he said by his stripes I'm Healed he no more said that sitting there paralyzed feet Hands and Body and back no more than he said that out of the chair he went glorifying God his natural senses said he hadd sit there the doctor said he'd be there forever but the word said you are healed and he wouldn't take nothing contrary to what the word [Applause] said this is where we have to be news stations are saying World War II nuclear I mean I mean I I ain't but oh Lord have mercy in my later 40s and I ain't never heard nuclear stuff so much in the in the news everybody's talking everybody's testing them everybody's trying and flexing their muscles and it's very easy to get your eyes on that and think there's no hope but there is hope Hallelujah there'll be a bride without spot with wrink without wrinkle those that are alive and remain that is the word shall not hinder those that are asleep that's right but you're going to have to be persistent you're going to have to be perseverant you're going to have to push through so if we got to push with such Vigor and such steadfastness of heart and mind to go into a body change why would we give up even in a service and just let one slide by and another slide by before we know it we missed opportunities and and and we were sitting right there in the pew missed it no no I want to be let me ask you this this crippled boy was sitting in a chair and maybe these ministers was sitting in a chair which chair would you want well he crippled but he had believed he was laughed at but he believed he was scorned but he believed I want that chair I want the belief that no matter what comes my way I'll still believe sure I don't want to go what through he went through maybe we won't all go through what he goes through but we all better be sitting in the chair of belief not the chair of doubt and the chair of discouragement and the chair of whatever else no I'm believing to my last dollar I'm believing to my last moment I'm believing I'll believe it until I die I still believe let's pray get some persistence get some perseverance my goodness so many other things so easy the devil wants to tell you it's easy to give up there's a lot of hard things you go through when you give up he don't want to tell you about all of that but he wants to make the give up seem like an easier path than pressing forward I wonder how many just say Lord I believe but help my unbelief give me a perseverance to push through Lord may be dark all around me but God give me the perseverance to just keep taking a step one of brother Mickey King's favorite favorite sayings is just keep walking just keep walking take another step he' helped me in some things in business when I was in business and he I'd get discouraged about it Timothy just keep walking it'll get better take another step maybe I just tell you that tonight put my voice with his keep walking no doubt that's what we'd hear if we could actually hear with our ears tonight that cloud of witnesses is standing there on that grand stand press on keep walking it's worth it yes sir it's worth worth every trial it's worth every mile it's worth every heartache it's worth the darkness keep walking keep walking with Jesus father you've seen the hands that were lifted all over this building yes Lord many times we want to give up lord it's crossed my mind many times like why why did I keep pushing why why why did I keep going when I seem to be going nowhere but Lord I I want to be found with these ones we've heard about tonight Lord this sarap phenician woman God she didn't even let you you hurt her feelings she just kept on going yeah you're right but I'll take the crumbs Lord these others they they wouldn't give up their chair of belief their place where they were standing or sitting wherever they was at no matter what the scorn was no matter what anybody said no matter what went on around them they believed Lord Jesus help us to believe Lord help us not to give up right at the last moments of this race the finish line is just right in sight we don't know it
