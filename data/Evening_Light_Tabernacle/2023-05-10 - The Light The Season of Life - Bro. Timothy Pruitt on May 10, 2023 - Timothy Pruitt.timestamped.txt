[14:05] horse came up and it's kind of a mean
[14:08] horse and

[14:11] other ones so when she was doing that it
[14:13] came up out of nowhere and spun around

[36:00] we commit this to you in Jesus name
[36:03] amen
[36:05] let's turn to Joel chapter 2. also
[36:08] Psalms chapter 1.
[36:10] amen is quite an honor to be here with
[36:13] you tonight be back home
[36:15] amen we had a wonderful trip there as we
[36:19] went to the tent meetings there brother
[36:21] Sean's and ministered there on a
[36:23] Wednesday evening and and then others
[36:26] brother Jonathan Martin brother Wendell
[36:29] Martin brother Wayne Lawson and brother
[36:31] Ron Spencer brother Andrew Glover would
[36:33] Minister as well it was just a wonderful
[36:36] time in the presence of God and and uh I
[36:39] I feel honored to stand with men who
[36:41] stand in for this message that preaches
[36:43] it with all their heart and they don't
[36:45] back off but they hold the sword and
[36:48] they proclaim the promises of God and
[36:51] and it was very wonderful to be with
[36:53] them and brother Ron Spencer you know
[36:55] has been bad as we know been battling
[36:57] cancer but Saturday night he preached
[37:00] probably one of his best I don't say
[37:02] that very often because it seemed like
[37:04] it's always the better is always the
[37:06] next one or the now right but it was it
[37:09] was incredible to watch how God would
[37:11] use him and in those moments and time
[37:14] and then we'd follow him up on sun
[37:15] Sunday morning to his place and Minister
[37:17] and back at brother Donnie Reagan's on
[37:20] Wednesday night and I just thank the
[37:21] Lord for all that he's done and all the
[37:24] victories he's won it's it's his work
[37:26] it's his people and it's his promises
[37:29] and he's got it all in his hands amen
[37:32] amen so tonight I just want to look at
[37:34] Joel chapter 2 and Psalms chapter one
[37:37] very of course familiar Scriptures it
[37:40] says here in verse 25 and I will restore
[37:42] to you the years that the locusts had
[37:45] eaten the canker worm and the
[37:47] caterpillar and the Palma worm my great
[37:49] Army which I sent among you and you
[37:52] shall eat him plenty and be satisfied
[37:54] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[37:56] that has dealt wonderfully with you and
[37:59] my people shall never be ashamed and he
[38:02] shall know that I'm in the midst of
[38:04] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[38:06] and none else and my people shall never
[38:09] be ashamed and it shall come to pass
[38:11] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[38:14] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[38:16] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[38:19] shall dream dreams and your young men
[38:21] shall see visions and also upon the
[38:24] servants and upon the handmaiden those
[38:26] days will I pour out my spirit Psalms
[38:29] chapter 1 and verse 1 says blessed is
[38:32] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[38:34] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[38:38] of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of
[38:41] the scornful but his light his Delight
[38:44] is in the law of the Lord and in his law
[38:47] doth he meditate day and night and he
[38:50] shall be like a tree planted by the
[38:52] rivers of water notice rivers of water
[38:55] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[38:58] season his Leaf also shall not wither
[39:01] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[39:04] the ungodly or not so but are like the
[39:06] chaff which the wind driveeth away
[39:09] therefore the ungodly shall not stand
[39:11] the Judgment nor sinners in the
[39:13] congregation of the righteous for the
[39:16] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[39:17] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[39:21] amen will let you be seated
[39:33] he's looking here in Psalms chapter 1
[39:35] and verse 1 you'll notice there's
[39:38] progression in the scripture because it
[39:40] says blessed is the man that walketh
[39:43] or then it goes to standeth
[39:46] and then it goes to sitteth so it's a
[39:48] progression of this man that walketh or
[39:51] standeth or sitteth and then also
[39:53] counsel way and seat and ungodly and
[39:57] Sinners and scornful
[39:59] but blessed is that man that his Delight
[40:03] is in the law of the Lord or in the word
[40:06] of the Lord and he doesn't meditate day
[40:09] and night and he shall be like a tree
[40:11] planted by rivers of water that bringeth
[40:15] forth his fruit in its season I'd like
[40:18] to speak to you this evening on this the
[40:20] light the season of life I believe we
[40:24] are in the season of life amen we're in
[40:27] the season that is moving from this
[40:28] Dimension into a new dimension amen from
[40:32] in and from Mortal life to Immortal Life
[40:35] and we know that we're in the time of of
[40:38] darkness and the time it's not not don't
[40:40] have to explain that very well to know
[40:42] that we're in great Darkness but also in
[40:45] the time of great light it's quite a
[40:48] paradox that in the middle of Darkness
[40:50] there's a great light that is shining
[40:52] Upon A people that is bringing them back
[40:54] to a place of restoration and not just
[40:57] partial partial restoration or partial
[41:00] fulfillment for full restoration and
[41:03] full fulfillment of his promises and God
[41:06] is going to fulfill every one of his
[41:08] words there's not one of them going to
[41:10] fall to the ground and not be fulfilled
[41:12] but he will fulfill every one of them
[41:15] amen and no matter what he has to do
[41:18] well no matter how many kingdoms he has
[41:20] to raise or how many kingdoms he has to
[41:22] tear down amen he's going to fulfill his
[41:25] word and I'm thankful that we're living
[41:27] in a time not of death but a time of
[41:30] life amen we can see there in the the
[41:33] first age as it was a time of planting
[41:36] it was a time of actually going into the
[41:38] ground and it would go down to the Dark
[41:40] Ages but it would come up and this time
[41:42] it was a time of not planting but a time
[41:45] of reaping a time of harvest and that's
[41:48] the time that we're living in that God
[41:49] has restored us back to what it was at
[41:52] the beginning and you know brother
[41:54] Brandon would talk about this he said
[41:56] Webster says the word restore means to
[41:58] bring back to the former owner to bring
[42:01] back to the former state or condition
[42:03] it's if a claim has been made on
[42:06] something is to make that restoration
[42:08] you can enforce it to bring it back to
[42:10] its right place to restore is to bring
[42:13] back to who really owns it amen to who
[42:16] really owns it to bring it back to its
[42:19] natural estate where it was at the first
[42:22] time to bring it back to his natural
[42:24] condition in order to do this we have
[42:26] the right to enforce if there's a law
[42:29] that speaks him then we have a right to
[42:31] enforce the rightful condition of
[42:33] restoration he says like if somebody
[42:35] stole some property and they're holding
[42:38] your property Capital captive then you
[42:40] can go to the law and take the law to
[42:42] this person and the law will force that
[42:45] person to restore this property back to
[42:48] the rightful owner in its print to its
[42:50] prior and First Estate amen enforcement
[42:53] he said enforce then we have the
[42:55] privilege to enforce the privilege to
[42:58] enforce upon Satan that claims that God
[43:01] has given us for God has a law his word
[43:04] is the law see amen Satan can come
[43:06] against you but his the word of God the
[43:09] law of God stands against him and his
[43:11] claims upon you as we spoke about Esther
[43:14] just a few Services ago just right at
[43:16] the End Amen there had been a law that
[43:19] had been put in place for their
[43:21] destruction but before that law could be
[43:23] enforced amen the king gave them another
[43:25] command and told them to go and to
[43:28] destroy their enemy before they
[43:30] destroyed them amen and I love that
[43:32] because Satan wants to come and put
[43:34] claims upon your life and put claims
[43:37] upon your souls and put claims upon the
[43:39] things on your mind and your spirits but
[43:42] before he could lay that claim upon you
[43:44] there was already something else another
[43:47] law that was in place that God has given
[43:49] us a right to enforce therefore we can
[43:52] go towards Satan to Satan and tell him
[43:54] bring it back to his rightful owner amen
[43:57] you see and he has to do it see we where
[44:00] God in his word made certain claims to
[44:02] the church therefore we have the right
[44:04] to enforce these claims upon Satan and
[44:07] say give it back and he has to do it
[44:11] Hallelujah and he has to do it not by
[44:13] our mind not by our power but by his
[44:16] Spirit saith the Lord amen I don't have
[44:19] the ability to make him do one thing but
[44:21] I have The God Who amen who has the
[44:24] ability has the power and has the way to
[44:27] make him do what his word says he's
[44:29] going to do amen because we can take
[44:31] God's agent the Holy Spirit and we can
[44:34] go on our knees and say it's thus saith
[44:36] the Lord and he's got to give it up
[44:38] that's all because the holy spirit is
[44:41] there to make him do it the law of the
[44:43] land is to enforce it's by the land and
[44:45] for the land and the law of the spirit
[44:48] of God is to for Satan to give up that
[44:51] which is unrightfully and deceitfully
[44:53] taken from God Souls of men he took from
[44:56] God Souls of women Souls of children
[44:59] sicknesses of the body he's placed upon
[45:02] people where God Made Them In His Image
[45:04] to be like him and the church has been
[45:07] given the right the legal rights by the
[45:10] Bible to take the Holy Spirit and to
[45:13] enforce this law upon Satan
[45:16] hallelujah amen that he has to give up
[45:19] the property of God he has to give up
[45:22] what God has rightfully given us amen I
[45:25] I I don't think it just happens to
[45:27] answer just uh just something that
[45:29] happened today that we saw right before
[45:30] our very eyes brother Tim giving witness
[45:33] to it amen of a thing that had happened
[45:36] to his daughter I remember when I was
[45:37] there with my own little daughter laying
[45:39] there in a very serious situation amen
[45:42] and I just begin to use the word of God
[45:44] and call upon the name of Jesus and I
[45:47] watch God bring it all back to the place
[45:49] that it rightfully belonged I saw God
[45:52] bring back my daughter to her right mind
[45:54] give her sight back give her mind back
[45:57] give her all these things back why
[45:59] because I hadn't right brought amen a
[46:02] place I'd come to the law of God and I'd
[46:04] called out to that law and there was a
[46:07] spirit there to back it up and to bring
[46:09] it back where it belonged
[46:12] Amen brother Brandon we'll talk about
[46:13] this in a car Amen in a little car
[46:15] they've been stolen from a brother and
[46:17] he said it you said what he said what
[46:19] was it he said there was a law we could
[46:21] go to and that law was wherever two or
[46:24] three are gathered in my name if they
[46:26] would agree I'll be in their midst and
[46:28] if they agree on touching any certain
[46:30] thing and ask it and don't doubt in
[46:33] their heart they shall have what they
[46:35] ask and it shall be given them
[46:37] so there was a law of God that is spoken
[46:40] of all this need and this situation of a
[46:43] car that had been stolen from a man and
[46:45] been taken away from him and out of his
[46:48] sight and out of his ability to be able
[46:50] to return it but there was a law that
[46:52] had been spoken and he said we took that
[46:54] law before the father and the Holy
[46:57] Spirit went and and brought that law
[46:59] into force and he said we got on our
[47:02] knees about five men and four or five
[47:04] men and we knelt down and I pleaded the
[47:06] case before God and the great Holy
[47:08] Spirit as he took the word to serve
[47:11] summons a vision broke and I saw a man
[47:14] going toward Bowling Green Kentucky with
[47:16] a yellow shirt on driving his truck and
[47:19] the Holy Spirit come upon Him condemned
[47:22] him and he took it right back to where
[47:24] he got it and I saw him come back and
[47:26] park the car on a certain street over
[47:28] across the river and I raised up and I
[47:30] said thus saith the Lord and when they
[47:32] started out and went on the road there
[47:34] was a car sitting there half empty with
[47:36] gasoline the tank half day where it's
[47:38] been filled up just enough to take him
[47:40] halfway to Bowling Green and bring him
[47:42] back and these men are sitting here for
[47:44] a witness what was it enforcing give it
[47:47] back
[47:49] give it back see that's it that's what
[47:52] we're talking about re restoring it
[47:55] bringing it back to the rightful order
[48:00] amen bringing it back
[48:07] I was back there thinking about this
[48:09] very story and I thought of that law
[48:11] would pertain to a hunk of metal and it
[48:14] would pertain to a car and pertain to
[48:16] something that's very temporary how much
[48:19] more would this law pertain to our
[48:21] children
[48:22] how much more would this law pertain to
[48:25] the needs amen they're not temporary
[48:27] they're not temporary Souls they're not
[48:29] temporary parties amen but children that
[48:32] God has given us and has laid them in
[48:35] our life as fruits from our our body and
[48:37] God has given them to us and Satan wants
[48:40] to take them out of our side and try to
[48:42] destroy them and empty their lives and
[48:45] bring them down into a devil's hell but
[48:47] we come together tonight agree and only
[48:50] two things where two or three are
[48:52] gathered in his name there I'll be and
[48:55] we know he's here tonight and he showed
[48:57] it very very suddenly just today as he
[49:00] would take a little girl being kicked in
[49:02] the face by a horse and scars would be
[49:04] on her face look like a broke bones but
[49:07] God rich in Mercy Amen in a Father's
[49:09] Heart we begin to cry out and begin to
[49:12] call back restoration
[49:16] Hallelujah God did this for a purpose
[49:18] for you to realize amen God's more
[49:21] concerned than some scars on the face
[49:23] he's concerned about scars and his soul
[49:25] and the devil's trying to take them out
[49:27] and Scar their mouth but there's a
[49:30] people here that sees a law there and
[49:33] says God you spoke it and we're going to
[49:35] hold to it
[49:37] we're going to hold to what you spoke
[49:39] Satan has robbed us but we're going to
[49:42] bring it back Satan is taking it but
[49:44] we're going to bring it back by the word
[49:46] of almighty God
[49:50] hallelujah it's a law laying over Satan
[49:57] Hallelujah and if Satan has robbed you
[50:00] up in the prayer of the privilege of
[50:02] being a son or daughter of God you have
[50:04] a right by the Holy Spirit to enforce
[50:08] the claim of God and bring them back
[50:13] oh hallelujah amen we're talking about
[50:16] our Bill of Rights
[50:19] oh we're quick to go back to our our
[50:21] Bill of Rights on the Constitution that
[50:23] was written by some Mortal men but what
[50:26] about this that was written by almighty
[50:28] God
[50:30] hey man we we talk about our right to
[50:32] bear arms and they better not take our
[50:34] guns but meanwhile we lay down and let
[50:37] the devil run over right over the top of
[50:39] us
[50:40] it's time for you to bear arms it's time
[50:43] for you to encourage yourself and fight
[50:45] and say devil you come far enough but
[50:49] I'm here to enforce my god-given claim
[50:52] that's my child and not only is it mine
[50:55] it's a Son of God it's a daughter of God
[50:57] and we're coming after them in the name
[51:00] of Jesus Christ
[51:06] oh
[51:07] if he Afflicted you and made you sick
[51:09] you have a right
[51:12] before God to enforce the laws of God by
[51:16] his stripes
[51:21] amen oh we want our rights well I'm
[51:24] trying to give you some
[51:27] before God to enforce you have a right
[51:31] bring them back turn them loose you've
[51:35] taken him out yonder to death but we
[51:37] claim them and we bring them back
[51:40] foreign
[51:42] he's trying to take some of ours out by
[51:44] death by cancer but we have a right to
[51:48] stand upon the word of God and say bring
[51:50] them back bring them back to the house
[51:53] of God bring them back to full health

[52:06] natural condition a man's sick a baby's
[52:09] sick a woman sick they're out out of
[52:11] their natural condition then we have a
[52:14] right to enforce our claim not our claim
[52:17] but it's our claim because God give it
[52:19] to us amen is his promise by his stripes
[52:22] we are healed he was wondering for our
[52:25] transgressions by his stripes we are
[52:27] healed then we have a right to enforce
[52:29] the law and the law Giver the Holy
[52:31] Spirit himself is here the agent of God
[52:34] to see that is done exactly that way
[52:39] oh come on now amen do we believe he's
[52:42] here we're Among Us
[52:44] what is the law it's his law he said
[52:46] where two and three are gathered in my
[52:48] name there I shall be so we know he's
[52:51] here tonight because we haven't gathered
[52:52] under some denominational name we hadn't
[52:55] gathered them in our own abilities our
[52:57] own ideas no we have gathered under the
[53:00] name of Jesus Christ and At The Mention
[53:02] Of that name every demon has to flee
[53:04] under mention of that name every
[53:06] sickness has to Bow under the mention of
[53:09] that name every sin has to turn loose
[53:11] and the mention of that name demons will
[53:14] Screech to a halt
[53:19] amen
[53:23] we have a right
[53:25] the only way he can work is when you let
[53:28] him work
[53:31] how do you let him work by speaking his
[53:35] word
[53:38] do what brother Andrew to check check
[53:40] check my check
[53:42] seems to work there for him we'll see if
[53:43] it works for me
[53:44] the way you let him work is by speaking
[53:48] his word
[53:50] not speaking your doubts as we heard
[53:52] Sunday not speaking your frustrations
[53:55] not speaking the conditions around you
[53:57] and the wowzy wowzy Woos and I'm never
[54:00] going to amount to nothing I'm never
[54:01] going to be there no that's not what his
[54:03] word said what his word said I'm a more
[54:06] than Overcomer his word said I am
[54:09] blessed
[54:13] Hallelujah his wife just read it to you
[54:16] blessed is he
[54:21] God sends his Earth around the Sun
[54:25] and we know the seasons change the Earth
[54:28] turns away from the Sun and winter sets
[54:31] in
[54:32] he said that's exactly the way a sinner
[54:34] does he just gets away from the Sun
[54:36] there so when
[54:39] and when Earth begins to come back when
[54:41] it's out there death strikes it the
[54:43] winner it kills every living thing he
[54:45] can kill out there the Earth gets back
[54:48] around but seeds are laying down on the
[54:50] ground they're frozen the pulps run out
[54:52] of them everything seems gone but
[54:55] there's still some light preserved on
[54:57] the inside
[54:59] oh God it may look like those seeds are
[55:03] out there and they're frozen and they're
[55:05] all hope is gone the pulse out of them
[55:08] but there's still some life on the
[55:09] inside of there and when this Earth
[55:12] begins to come back as soon as that sun
[55:14] gets back in the position again upon the
[55:17] Earth there will be an Easter a
[55:20] restoration up comes the flowers again
[55:22] up comes the grass again all the winter
[55:25] it killed the Sun restores
[55:30] Hallelujah all the wit all the winter
[55:33] the death had moved in the son of life
[55:36] is restoring it's calling it's pulling
[55:40] back and so it is now with people all
[55:42] the winners coldest cold former religion
[55:45] that's killed out there and nearing of
[55:47] the Son of God in the last days coming
[55:49] into his church it has restored us back
[55:52] to life again I will restore saith the
[55:55] Lord so God restores the flowers he
[55:58] restores the leaves he restores his
[56:00] nature his seed of the earth and
[56:02] therefore we know then that God will
[56:04] restore also his habitation he will
[56:07] bring it back and restore his Eden once
[56:09] again he will restore everything that
[56:12] death has killed
[56:16] the only way it could ever remain dead
[56:18] is to let it lay in the wrong place
[56:24] but if it falls in the right place
[56:26] it's got to come to life
[56:31] he said oh God let us fall in the right
[56:34] Channel
[56:36] hey I believe we're in the right channel
[56:37] tonight
[56:39] oh my
[56:43] let us fall in the right channel for
[56:46] restoration all that winter kills the
[56:49] sun restores returning the Sun what does
[56:52] it do it forces death to let go
[56:58] when the Sun that spring Sun comes back
[57:01] in the line of the Earth again it
[57:04] actually forces death to give up its
[57:07] dead to a resurrection again
[57:11] for what a restoration to restore it
[57:15] back again
[57:17] what does it the sun coming that is
[57:20] God's law God set the Earth in laws
[57:22] gravitation has a law
[57:26] is that a law you don't ever worry about
[57:27] it do you throw something up it's going
[57:29] to come down
[57:31] it's gravitation
[57:32] it's called the law of gravitation
[57:35] somebody would figure that out and would
[57:37] name it the law of gravitation what goes
[57:39] up we'll come back down again I don't
[57:41] care if you put a jet engine on it
[57:43] sooner or later it's going to come back
[57:44] down again
[57:46] it's a law there it's an actor it's an
[57:49] action it's working everything in nature
[57:52] Works according to that law the flower
[57:54] served its term the seed served his turn
[57:57] it died into the Earth but then there's
[57:59] a law of restoration
[58:03] there's a law of Resurrection
[58:07] amen and now it may be laying dead there
[58:10] and it seems impossible
[58:13] it seems like it'll never come to life
[58:16] again it seems like it'll never come
[58:19] forth out of that cold dark gray dead
[58:22] grave
[58:23] but there's a law that was laying there
[58:26] it's what Jesus would speak of that law
[58:28] he said you he said he will not suffer
[58:30] his holy one to seek corruption he said
[58:33] you tear this Temple down in three days
[58:34] I'll raise it up again what was he
[58:36] referring to the law that was over his
[58:39] body
[58:41] so pilate thought he had the law amen
[58:45] the Pharisees thought they had the law
[58:47] everybody the Roman soldiers thought
[58:49] they had the law but there was another
[58:51] law in effect before they ever went into
[58:53] effect
[58:56] Hallelujah before there was ever a pilot
[58:59] before there was ever a Pharisee before
[59:01] there was ever a Roman guard that was
[59:03] already a law that had been spoken in
[59:06] three days he's going to come out
[59:09] Hallelujah so they could try to seal it
[59:11] up they could try to cover it up they
[59:13] could try to do all they want to they
[59:15] could put a Roman seal and a Roman guard
[59:18] around it but there was a law that was
[59:20] over that body
[59:21] and that body was laying there but on
[59:24] that Resurrection morning that law came
[59:26] into effect
[59:28] there wasn't enough guards there wasn't
[59:31] enough Devils there wasn't enough
[59:32] anything to hold that body down
[59:37] let me tell you something parents
[59:40] there's a law that's an effect over your
[59:42] children they shall be there and they're
[59:45] Offspring with them the promise is unto
[59:47] you and your children amen so I don't
[59:50] care how much the devil has done how
[59:52] much he's trying to cover them up how
[59:54] much he's trying to scar them how much
[59:55] he's trying to destroy them when it's
[59:57] time for them to come to life they ain't
[1:00:00] enough devils
[1:00:03] there ain't enough sin there ain't
[1:00:05] enough perversion that can hold them
[1:00:07] down amen because there's a law that's
[1:00:10] an effect over them before there ever
[1:00:13] was a devil
[1:00:15] before there ever was a sin it was
[1:00:18] already a law in effect
[1:00:21] it is the law of life
[1:00:23] [Applause]
[1:00:30] God said all of his laws in motion
[1:00:33] let it soak in now
[1:00:35] he said all of his laws in motion it'll
[1:00:38] work according to his word his word
[1:00:41] his laws work according to his word
[1:00:46] his laws does not work according to the
[1:00:48] conditions
[1:00:51] your heart is Sunday his laws does not
[1:00:55] work according to his conditions
[1:00:58] or its conditions or the conditions
[1:01:00] around you it works according to the
[1:01:03] word
[1:01:05] so if the word spoken that law is in
[1:01:08] effect he commanded the son he commanded
[1:01:10] the moon he commanded the Earth
[1:01:11] commanded nature and all falls right in
[1:01:13] line
[1:01:14] and all the laws work in harmony with
[1:01:17] God's spoken word and the law of life
[1:01:19] that's in us will also bring us to a
[1:01:23] resurrection
[1:01:29] ah come on now it doesn't matter how
[1:01:32] dark it gets it doesn't matter what laws
[1:01:35] man will pass
[1:01:39] those laws are not in fact there's a law
[1:01:43] that's already been wrote over over our
[1:01:45] life it's called The Law of life
[1:01:49] Hallelujah and in this season it will
[1:01:52] bear forth fruit
[1:01:53] when it's time there's not enough devils
[1:01:56] in hell that's going to keep it from
[1:01:58] happening
[1:02:00] listen they could they could get muster
[1:02:03] up all the devils in hell and put them
[1:02:05] around a little graveyard over there in
[1:02:07] Lebanon Cemetery but there's some seeds
[1:02:09] that are laying there
[1:02:11] and when the time comes for that
[1:02:13] Resurrection they can try to stomp on it
[1:02:15] they can try to cover it up they can try
[1:02:17] to say it ain't so they can try to say
[1:02:19] whatever they want to do whatever they
[1:02:21] want to but when that law comes into
[1:02:23] effect when that law comes to
[1:02:25] Restoration and the law of life begins
[1:02:28] to produce what is it it's going to take
[1:02:30] some old dry dust and it's going to
[1:02:32] bring them back up again to step from
[1:02:34] mortality into immortality
[1:02:38] but not only is it going to do over
[1:02:40] there in a cemetery or one down the road
[1:02:43] here or wherever the seeds of God Amen
[1:02:45] it's going to do it in your own body
[1:02:49] Hallelujah the devil's trying to cap you
[1:02:51] and clamp you down and say you'll not
[1:02:53] Beaver so much I want to tell the devil
[1:02:56] something there's another law that's in
[1:02:58] effect over my life
[1:03:00] you have no say in how blessed I can be
[1:03:03] you have no say in how healed I can be
[1:03:06] you have no saying and how saved I can
[1:03:09] be
[1:03:13] devil you have no say over our children
[1:03:17] you have no say over our young people
[1:03:19] you have no say over anybody
[1:03:23] that's a seed of almighty God they're
[1:03:25] going to come forth
[1:03:31] let's go ahead and rejoice about it as
[1:03:34] good as already done
[1:03:37] because it's not a man-made claw a
[1:03:39] man-made decree it's God's law
[1:03:48] it's God's law
[1:03:51] and it's enforced no matter what the
[1:03:54] devil says
[1:03:55] when the word spoke on us suffered my
[1:03:57] Holy One to see corruption neither do I
[1:03:59] leave his soul in hell
[1:04:00] there was enough Devils there wasn't
[1:04:03] enough time
[1:04:06] it wasn't enough anything to keep Christ
[1:04:08] in the grave his body
[1:04:11] was laying there but the law of God
[1:04:13] would bring the word to pass and bring
[1:04:16] the promises to pass
[1:04:18] regardless of how little we think we are
[1:04:22] how low we think we are how impure we
[1:04:25] think we are how Unholy or how sick we
[1:04:28] are how Afflicted we are the law of
[1:04:31] God's spirit by his word makes it obey
[1:04:33] him and forces the issue and says give
[1:04:36] it back
[1:04:41] Mercy oh if you just think of that it
[1:04:45] forces it regardless of the conditions
[1:04:52] regardless of how impossible it may seem
[1:04:56] but damn it seemed impossible didn't it
[1:04:59] I mean when I was looking at my little
[1:05:01] daughter Adriana it seemed impossible
[1:05:03] let's look at it brother Philip it
[1:05:05] seemed impossible
[1:05:06] when I was looking at any of us it
[1:05:08] seemed impossible
[1:05:11] but God had a word there
[1:05:15] God had a law already in effect over our
[1:05:18] lives it didn't matter how deep in sin
[1:05:21] we went how dark in darkness we went how
[1:05:24] impossible it sin it's regardless of
[1:05:27] condition his word will be fulfilled
[1:05:31] [Applause]
[1:05:33] so if I was you I would stop looking at
[1:05:36] The Impossibles and start seeing what's
[1:05:38] possible
[1:05:41] it might be impossible for you to
[1:05:43] receive a heal it seems like or
[1:05:44] Deliverance or whatever you have needed
[1:05:46] look beyond all the impossibilities
[1:05:49] because this is just beyond that is the
[1:05:52] possibility
[1:05:55] the devil wants to lay everything else
[1:05:56] and I know how I'd start telling mother
[1:05:58] Tim I know how what he does when God
[1:06:00] does something like that for you then he
[1:06:01] wants to come back well you know it
[1:06:03] wasn't just as bad as you thought it was
[1:06:07] yeah he thought you just thought all
[1:06:10] that was there you just thought
[1:06:15] well let me just say it like this
[1:06:18] and I don't even want to put I'm not
[1:06:19] even trying to pack put a cloud of Doubt
[1:06:21] over anything
[1:06:22] where's our little sister at I don't
[1:06:25] know stand up
[1:06:29] come on up here that's a good idea
[1:06:36] does this look like a little girl that
[1:06:38] took a horse kick right in the face
[1:06:44] does it look like one that took one in
[1:06:46] the chest said she couldn't breathe
[1:06:53] hallelujah what man might have thought
[1:06:55] was impossible God said watch this
[1:06:59] there's somebody calling on my name and
[1:07:02] I'm going to fulfill my word
[1:07:09] hallelujah hallelujah come here Joshua
[1:07:12] come here does this look like somebody
[1:07:15] that used to be a sinner and so scared
[1:07:17] and worried and Afraid
[1:07:20] there was a law that was laying over his
[1:07:22] life it was an effect before fear came
[1:07:25] it was an effect before any devil came
[1:07:27] it was already there
[1:07:32] Hallelujah does this look like somebody
[1:07:35] that was in the bar room and was out
[1:07:37] drunk and worked in the world no sir but
[1:07:40] there was a law that was an effect over
[1:07:42] his life and would call him from there
[1:07:44] and make him a preacher of the Gospel of
[1:07:47] Jesus Christ
[1:07:50] I'm telling you need to look past all
[1:07:52] your sadness look past all your unbelief
[1:07:55] look past everything that you can see
[1:07:57] and look to the outside
[1:08:00] it's more real tonight than anything you
[1:08:03] see around here
[1:08:05] there's angels of fire there's pillars
[1:08:08] of fire there's God walking up and down
[1:08:10] moving he said if I can just get
[1:08:13] somebody to take me out my word
[1:08:15] [Applause]
[1:08:20] if I can just get somebody to walk
[1:08:23] towards that fire
[1:08:25] I'm going to step in with them
[1:08:31] Hallelujah
[1:08:33] we ought to have a jubilee tonight
[1:08:36] listen God arrange this whole thing
[1:08:39] he'll allow what to be preached on
[1:08:41] Sunday amen Sarah watch your mouths and
[1:08:45] then he's coming back behind and saying
[1:08:46] look I got a witness right there of a
[1:08:49] man that would look past his fears look
[1:08:51] past the scars look past the plug and
[1:08:54] say God have mercy on my daughter and
[1:08:57] God in a minute would take that old
[1:08:59] brags off of her face and she be made
[1:09:01] completely whole
[1:09:05] let that be a sign to your moms and
[1:09:08] dance
[1:09:10] that's got children out there away from
[1:09:13] God and they're always seems impossible
[1:09:17] but one of these days the rags are
[1:09:20] coming off
[1:09:22] the riots are coming home and it's going
[1:09:25] to be Lazarus has come forward
[1:09:29] the word and power of Resurrection is
[1:09:32] Among Us
[1:09:36] it is in effect
[1:09:41] [Applause]
[1:09:56] said after his death burial Resurrection
[1:09:59] many of the Saints had slept in the dust
[1:10:02] of the earth rose up out of the ground
[1:10:04] what was what the prophet spoke the word
[1:10:07] and the spirit of God brought it to pass
[1:10:12] not only did Jesus raise but Saints
[1:10:15] raised with him it was a season of life
[1:10:19] death had been conquered
[1:10:23] and I want you to understand something
[1:10:25] death is still conquered
[1:10:29] death has still lost his hold death has
[1:10:32] still lost his ability to put fear in
[1:10:35] Believers hearts
[1:10:41] Hallelujah
[1:10:42] say the court writes out a certain
[1:10:44] certain certain things certain penalty
[1:10:46] to do so and so
[1:10:47] that's the word of the Court the law of
[1:10:49] the Court
[1:10:50] but the law has to enforce what the word
[1:10:52] of the Court says and God speaks
[1:10:54] something that's a law
[1:10:57] and the Holy Spirit though is here to
[1:10:59] enforce it for the believer
[1:11:03] you've got to have the badge of the
[1:11:05] believer you got to have the token
[1:11:07] somebody said you got power no but we
[1:11:10] got Authority
[1:11:14] not power but Authority we ain't got
[1:11:17] power to do nothing he said it's like a
[1:11:19] little policeman in Louisville standing
[1:11:21] there smaller than what I am little
[1:11:23] bitty Fella's hat pulled out over his
[1:11:25] ears
[1:11:26] 45 Maybe
[1:11:28] he's uniform about half hanging off of
[1:11:30] him walk out in the street
[1:11:32] cap pistol like on the side a little
[1:11:34] stick in his hand little whistle walk up
[1:11:36] there with a pair of white gloves on in
[1:11:38] them cars some of them 350 horsepower
[1:11:40] whirling down by the street like
[1:11:42] lightning zoom zoom zoom he couldn't
[1:11:45] stop a runaway Pony with his strength
[1:11:50] but he walked out in the street with
[1:11:52] that bad Shining
[1:11:55] he went
[1:12:02] he blew that whistle and he held up his
[1:12:05] hand brother 350 horsepower motors
[1:12:08] squeaked the brakes it wasn't the power
[1:12:10] of the man it was the authority he had
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:15] it was the authority half that's the
[1:12:18] church
[1:12:19] it might be a bunch of Holy Rollers
[1:12:21] so-called whatever you want to call it
[1:12:23] but she's got Authority
[1:12:26] it's the authority behind it that's what
[1:12:28] does it regardless of the conditions
[1:12:32] regardless you need to write that down
[1:12:35] regardless of the condition God's law
[1:12:38] works
[1:12:41] it won't work with your Creed it'll work
[1:12:44] with the word it works with the word it
[1:12:46] works with the spirit following behind
[1:12:48] it and bringing it to pass
[1:12:55] may not look like much
[1:12:58] maybe a hundred pounds soaking wet
[1:13:01] but you're in your your little one of
[1:13:04] your little sisters in there washing
[1:13:05] your dishes
[1:13:07] all of a sudden the baby comes in
[1:13:09] burning up with a fever you have the
[1:13:11] authority
[1:13:12] to lay your hands on that baby
[1:13:15] and Demon's brakes are going to squeak
[1:13:22] brother Tim did not have the power to do
[1:13:24] what happened
[1:13:25] I didn't have the power to do what
[1:13:27] happened to Adriana I didn't have the
[1:13:29] power to say brother Philip but there
[1:13:31] was an authority
[1:13:33] I never forget it as I was laying there
[1:13:36] looking at my little girl and her
[1:13:37] crossed eyes and her talking about she
[1:13:39] couldn't see and her eyes open and
[1:13:41] they're crossed all up and I said God
[1:13:43] I'm just like brother I think his bank
[1:13:45] Banks Woods wouldn't it or who was out
[1:13:47] there on fishing with brother Branham
[1:13:49] Welch Evans that's who it was and he was
[1:13:51] out there fishing with brother
[1:13:52] brannelman and he reaches over to grab a
[1:13:54] bass brother about him and called her
[1:13:55] something and a snake Timber rattle or
[1:13:57] something bit him on the foot and I it
[1:13:59] was going through my mind as I'm looking
[1:14:01] at this because we're just out enjoying
[1:14:02] nature out there at the state park with
[1:14:04] some young people and some other adults
[1:14:06] that were there and I I'm just looking
[1:14:08] at this like God I I think I I ain't
[1:14:11] doing nothing wrong I'm just out here
[1:14:13] enjoying nature I remember when it's
[1:14:15] like that with your prophet and how he
[1:14:17] began to pray and I just began to pray
[1:14:18] Lord I'm just out here enjoying this and
[1:14:21] the devil is coming struck her down and
[1:14:23] she says she can't see and I'm looking
[1:14:25] at crossed eyes and I asked God that
[1:14:27] you'll just give her back her eyesight
[1:14:29] and I watched those eyes come straight
[1:14:31] and I watched her and she began to say
[1:14:33] Daddy I can see you now
[1:14:37] I didn't have power to do that I didn't
[1:14:39] have power to fix her to pick some big
[1:14:41] enough strong enough glass to put on her
[1:14:43] eyes to give her aside I couldn't do
[1:14:45] nothing but God could and God came
[1:14:47] behind a little boy's prayer a little
[1:14:49] son of God and began to call upon him
[1:14:52] and he moved very quickly and I watched
[1:14:54] it happen
[1:14:58] and God began to move in such a way and
[1:15:01] that brother Matthew similarly would
[1:15:03] call my father same thing
[1:15:05] and he would pray God let there not be
[1:15:07] one broke bone
[1:15:09] doctors were sure she had broke bones
[1:15:11] her ankle was swelled way out and her
[1:15:14] face was all messed up and they've done
[1:15:16] all kind of scans and all kinds of
[1:15:18] things and then he'd come back he said
[1:15:20] look he said I'm going to keep her
[1:15:21] overnight because she was observed
[1:15:23] knocked out but otherwise there's no
[1:15:24] reason to to do this you don't have a
[1:15:27] sign of a brain injury she don't have a
[1:15:29] sign of a concussion she don't have one
[1:15:31] broke bone it's all okay
[1:15:37] Hallelujah and I know what God spoke to
[1:15:39] me he said what you saw in the natural
[1:15:41] you'll also see in the Supernatural and
[1:15:44] God very quickly brought the same thing
[1:15:46] that happened in the natural in the
[1:15:48] Supernatural
[1:15:50] and we still got living proof of it here
[1:15:52] tonight so the devil can say whatever he
[1:15:54] wants to say he can howl all it wants to
[1:15:57] have I could see a man that's been
[1:15:59] changed I can see a man who once was
[1:16:03] walking one way and God turned him
[1:16:05] around and he went the other way
[1:16:09] in his Amnesia is gone and the scars are
[1:16:13] healed
[1:16:16] regardless of conditions
[1:16:22] brother brother Tim make mention of this
[1:16:25] Sunday
[1:16:27] about Abraham and Sarah how Sarah was
[1:16:29] caught by abimelech
[1:16:32] she went to the change of life for the
[1:16:35] body change and here's a 90 year old
[1:16:37] woman a king's Desiring
[1:16:39] there's things there's things in the
[1:16:41] scriptures people don't ever catch
[1:16:43] but here she is and the King's wanting
[1:16:45] to take her for his wife
[1:16:49] he said he was all ready now to take her
[1:16:52] God said Abraham by Sarah you'll have a
[1:16:54] baby
[1:16:55] see what it was it was a law already in
[1:16:58] effect over her life
[1:17:03] so abimelech seed would not work
[1:17:08] amen God had said that to Abraham
[1:17:12] from you Sarah will have a have a child
[1:17:15] and here's a young man taking her you
[1:17:17] notice what God Said you know I not yes
[1:17:19] I know the Integrity of your heart the
[1:17:21] reason I've kept you from sinning
[1:17:22] against me but restore that woman to her
[1:17:25] husband for he is a prophet and let him
[1:17:27] pray for you and if you don't I'm going
[1:17:29] to wipe you off the face of the Earth
[1:17:31] there you are what was it God's word it
[1:17:34] has to stand no other man could touch
[1:17:37] Sarah
[1:17:39] because God had a long effect over her
[1:17:42] life Sarah type of the Church the true
[1:17:45] church the Free Church the free woman
[1:17:47] with a free child the type of the
[1:17:49] born-again Church of Promise let them
[1:17:51] say what they want to call us a Holy
[1:17:53] Roller call it fanaticism they try to
[1:17:55] stop it at Pentecost but they'll never
[1:17:57] do it just keep your hands off of it
[1:18:00] that's all God's gonna take that and do
[1:18:02] something with it just as sure as I'm
[1:18:04] standing here
[1:18:09] we're coming right down
[1:18:11] take your hands off of her there come
[1:18:14] the natural seed that's where the
[1:18:16] natural seed had to come if Sarah would
[1:18:19] have married this other man the natural
[1:18:20] seed would never been born so if God
[1:18:22] listen to this so protected the course
[1:18:26] for the natural seed
[1:18:28] how much more for the spiritual
[1:18:38] direct quote
[1:18:41] if God so protected the course for the
[1:18:45] natural seed how much more for the
[1:18:48] spiritual Royal Sea has he protected
[1:18:51] that
[1:18:53] Satan give him back
[1:18:55] turn them loose you're not smother them
[1:18:58] out there with organization and they
[1:19:00] they're free people you let them alone
[1:19:02] turn them loose they are the Royal seed
[1:19:05] of God
[1:19:09] there's already a law in effect
[1:19:12] over lives
[1:19:18] God speaking of Joel
[1:19:20] and hearing Joel God is speaking of his
[1:19:22] fruit tree that he planted
[1:19:25] God planted a fruit tree
[1:19:27] and he planted it on the day of
[1:19:29] Pentecost
[1:19:31] and he brought that tree there for a
[1:19:33] purpose
[1:19:34] God wanted it to bear his fruit word
[1:19:38] his fruit word God's word direct quote
[1:19:40] he wanted a church that would keep his
[1:19:42] word all down to the ages
[1:19:46] and I'll say this no matter the
[1:19:48] conditions
[1:19:50] no matter the conditions Eve had failed
[1:19:53] to keep it Jews have failed to get
[1:19:55] failed to keep it the law had failed all
[1:19:56] of it fell so God planted himself a tree
[1:19:59] and when this tree that God planted it
[1:20:01] was to Bear nine different kinds of
[1:20:03] fruit nine different kinds which means
[1:20:05] dying spiritual gifts nine fruits of the
[1:20:08] spirit that go with nine spiritual gifts
[1:20:10] that was God's tree he planted it and
[1:20:13] the Earth on the day of Pentecost
[1:20:16] and David saw this long time ago of his
[1:20:19] writings of songs for something joyful
[1:20:21] that it was the first thing he wrote
[1:20:23] about he saw a tree that was planted by
[1:20:25] rivers of waters
[1:20:27] and he shall be like a tree God's tree
[1:20:30] planted where by Rivers pure plural of
[1:20:34] water singular
[1:20:36] not Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian
[1:20:39] life no no just rivers of one water
[1:20:43] rivers of one water
[1:20:45] non-spiritual gifts by The Same Spirit
[1:20:48] nine fruits of the spirit coming in the
[1:20:51] same channel he shall be like a tree
[1:20:53] that's planted by rivers of water and
[1:20:57] David saw it he said blessed is that man
[1:20:59] because if he's planted there his leaves
[1:21:02] are not going to wither
[1:21:04] if he's been planted in that River amen
[1:21:07] he's going to bring forth fruit in this
[1:21:09] season no matter how they try to kill
[1:21:11] the tree no matter how the devil's
[1:21:13] trying to do it it's still coming forth
[1:21:19] his root won't die
[1:21:22] his root won't die
[1:21:24] and he said they can mock it laugh it
[1:21:26] make fun of us as Christians persecute
[1:21:29] persecution says a Christian to make him
[1:21:32] pray more and dig down and get a better
[1:21:35] hold so he can stand the storms
[1:21:41] trouble on the job
[1:21:44] situations in your family
[1:21:47] things that are going around you
[1:21:51] everyday life
[1:21:52] is to cause you to pray more and Dig
[1:21:55] Down Deeper
[1:21:59] Not Just Jerk it up and say well I ain't
[1:22:01] given no fruit don't allow yourself to
[1:22:03] go deeper into the word
[1:22:05] a deeper into his presence
[1:22:08] more experiences of God
[1:22:11] a greater experience
[1:22:16] I don't care if you're a 50 60 70 year
[1:22:19] old oak tree we all need more of God
[1:22:25] you never can get enough
[1:22:28] there's one feelings but many refillings
[1:22:30] and if you ever got the feeling you're
[1:22:33] going to want the refilling
[1:22:37] I can understand you're not wanting the
[1:22:39] refillings if you didn't get the feeling
[1:22:42] but if you ever got one drink
[1:22:44] if you ever he said because if you take
[1:22:47] this drink that I'm offering
[1:22:50] it'll quench something on the inside of
[1:22:52] you and you'll want more of it and
[1:22:55] you'll want more of it and you'll want
[1:22:57] more of it
[1:23:02] what if a man's planted in such things
[1:23:04] as by the river where the Springs nine
[1:23:07] different Springs feeding into them one
[1:23:09] of the establishment he has a man that's
[1:23:13] planted by the river the rivers of water
[1:23:14] one water one Spirit there's Gifts of
[1:23:16] healing Same Spirit Gifts of Prophecy
[1:23:18] Same Spirit All The Same Spirit many
[1:23:21] gifts
[1:23:22] and David saw him he was planted by the
[1:23:25] tree that would never die notice he had
[1:23:28] his life in The Roots the Roots were in
[1:23:32] the spring and up from the roots came to
[1:23:35] life and it began to Bear forth fruit
[1:23:39] now remember the tree will not cast as
[1:23:41] fruits you take a tree and put it away
[1:23:43] from the water first thing you know you
[1:23:44] got a little old Apple a little knotty
[1:23:46] worm eating apple it'll cast this crop
[1:23:49] he said that's what's the matter with
[1:23:50] the churches today you done got away
[1:23:52] from the river you got away from the
[1:23:54] gifts of the Spirit you got just church
[1:23:56] natural they get away from the spiritual
[1:23:58] things of God and they cast their fruits
[1:24:00] away what did they do they their
[1:24:02] Believers live in the world act like the
[1:24:04] world still cheat lie Smoke Drink gamble
[1:24:06] have bunco parties in the church pay the
[1:24:08] preacher everything else soup supper
[1:24:10] dances they cast their fruit it's just
[1:24:13] like the world and the unbeliever looks
[1:24:15] and say there's no difference in that
[1:24:17] person in me
[1:24:22] but a man that's planted
[1:24:24] not just stuck out but planted direct
[1:24:27] quote not just stuck out but planted by
[1:24:30] the rivers of water he's going to bring
[1:24:32] forth his fruit
[1:24:35] not your own fruit his fruit
[1:24:38] his fruit in due season we can read it
[1:24:42] there again Psalms 1 blessed is the man
[1:24:43] the Sid is not in the seat of the
[1:24:45] scornful stands in the way of the
[1:24:46] Sinners he shall be like a tree that's
[1:24:49] planted by the rivers of water he shall
[1:24:51] bring forth his fruit in his season and
[1:24:54] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the
[1:24:57] ungodly is not so he won't stand with
[1:25:00] them in the Judgment now we see shall
[1:25:02] bring forth his fruit in the season
[1:25:03] watch each his the personal pronoun here
[1:25:06] is his fruit God's fruit and the season
[1:25:09] that the prophet is bringing it
[1:25:12] it'll be in the prophet's season God's
[1:25:15] fruit In God's Time by The Prophet's
[1:25:17] season he'll bring forth his fruit in
[1:25:19] his season see if there isn't two if
[1:25:22] there isn't two his there bring forth
[1:25:24] his God's fruit in the season that the
[1:25:27] messenger has ordained it to come he'll
[1:25:29] bring forth now remember that messenger
[1:25:32] that brings forth the fruit of God will
[1:25:34] bring it in God's season it is the
[1:25:37] season of the bringer
[1:25:40] he's the season of the bringer he will
[1:25:43] bring forth his fruit in his season hey
[1:25:46] what is a bringer it's someone who
[1:25:49] brings
[1:25:50] a bringer is something or is someone who
[1:25:54] brings or provides
[1:25:58] you say I don't have no strength he's
[1:26:00] here to provide it
[1:26:03] I don't have no joy he's here to provide
[1:26:05] he's brought it in his service
[1:26:08] he's the bringer
[1:26:10] and he's bringing it out and he's
[1:26:12] passing it out to each one who will
[1:26:14] receive
[1:26:18] yeah you say well how how do I do it you
[1:26:22] just Reach Out
[1:26:23] and touch the Lord
[1:26:26] as he passes by
[1:26:28] what is it a touch of faith
[1:26:31] god this is my time
[1:26:35] the bringer was passing by that little
[1:26:37] woman with a blood issue and he's
[1:26:39] bringing her healing with him
[1:26:42] but she had to reach out
[1:26:44] and grab it by faith reaching out ain't
[1:26:47] just by hand it's by the words of your
[1:26:50] lips
[1:26:52] speaking the word
[1:26:54] speaking the word God I believe it this
[1:26:58] is my promise this is my service this is
[1:27:01] my time this is time fruit is going to
[1:27:03] come out of my life amen John 1 and
[1:27:06] verse 4 said in him was life and that
[1:27:09] life was the light of men
[1:27:13] it's the season of life life is a
[1:27:16] mystery it's the very force and energy
[1:27:19] that keeps us going
[1:27:23] listen this is this is I thought it was
[1:27:25] very good so I'll put it in here
[1:27:26] materialistic scientists have have to
[1:27:29] say is just the interaction life is just
[1:27:31] the interaction of chemicals that makes
[1:27:34] the body move and react and respond and
[1:27:36] enter through interact with everything
[1:27:38] around it
[1:27:40] it it is most clearly realized when it's
[1:27:43] absent
[1:27:45] life is most clearly realized when it's
[1:27:48] absent
[1:27:50] naturally spiritually
[1:27:54] realize when it's absent when death
[1:27:57] occur occurs to see a dead body
[1:28:00] immediately after death is to realize
[1:28:01] that something has left it so all that
[1:28:05] is left in the flesh that will Decay
[1:28:07] leaving nothing but dust
[1:28:10] something within the flesh gave up and
[1:28:14] no longer energizes the body into action
[1:28:18] for most of us the thought of Simply a
[1:28:20] chemical interaction is grossly
[1:28:22] inadequate we sense we feel we're
[1:28:25] something far more than just chemicals
[1:28:28] for chemicals have no Beauty they have
[1:28:30] no meaning they have no purpose things
[1:28:33] like love and creativity are just
[1:28:35] meaningless in a pile of Haven molecules
[1:28:39] that's my brother Brandon said you want
[1:28:40] to he said here's a quarter go buy me a
[1:28:43] court of love
[1:28:45] you can't do it go buy me a court of
[1:28:47] life you can't do it it's something else
[1:28:49] that comes from another place he said
[1:28:52] from a materialistic point of view we
[1:28:54] know that a human body needs a pumping
[1:28:56] heart it needs an active brain and when
[1:28:58] either one of them shuts down the body
[1:29:00] shuts down and dies we explain the brain
[1:29:03] activity as minute electrical charges
[1:29:06] flowing between cells causing
[1:29:08] stimulation that brings life but as we
[1:29:10] just said most of us also demand that is
[1:29:13] more than just that
[1:29:15] he said whatever men rationalize and
[1:29:18] reduce Humanity to Mere matter very soon
[1:29:22] after we find abuses of men by men
[1:29:27] because they don't look at it as
[1:29:28] something more than just matter
[1:29:32] they look at it just just like the tree
[1:29:35] out there matter of fact they begin to
[1:29:37] worship the tree more than the body that
[1:29:38] God created
[1:29:40] and there they would they would hang you
[1:29:42] over cutting down a tree before they
[1:29:44] would hang you over killing the body
[1:29:49] because they have reduced Humanity
[1:29:51] to Mere matter
[1:29:55] and when you do that he says you find
[1:29:57] abuses by men of men by men Hillary
[1:30:02] history is littered with such abuses it
[1:30:04] is only when we see man as something
[1:30:06] more than merely molecule activity does
[1:30:10] a man rise up to Greatness
[1:30:14] then we start talking about the quality
[1:30:16] of life and all this we're struggling to
[1:30:19] put meaning to this word life John
[1:30:21] though said in him was life
[1:30:24] speaking that it was something different
[1:30:26] than anyone else and everyone else life
[1:30:28] is imparted given to them at conception
[1:30:31] passed on by their parents but in Jesus
[1:30:33] this life existed independently of any
[1:30:37] other human being
[1:30:40] this life this energy that we understand
[1:30:42] we struggle to understand and exist in
[1:30:46] God alone
[1:30:49] the light
[1:30:50] the life the light the life the word
[1:30:55] life occurs 50 times in John's gospel
[1:30:59] often in the context of eternal life
[1:31:03] which is a life force or energy that
[1:31:06] goes on without end
[1:31:11] when the Bible speaks of our spirit it
[1:31:14] is that part of us that is a mysterious
[1:31:16] holder of this life that's energized
[1:31:18] which when a person becomes a Christian
[1:31:20] he's energized by the Holy Spirit
[1:31:28] you could see and it goes through many
[1:31:30] examples of when the spirit of God would
[1:31:32] fall upon men to the Old Testament in
[1:31:34] the New Testament it's a good study of
[1:31:37] how their life would become energized to
[1:31:39] where they become could do more than
[1:31:41] what was just humanly possible
[1:31:44] Samson's one that comes very quickly to
[1:31:46] my mind a man shrimp love a shrimp of a
[1:31:49] man curly hair look like a little
[1:31:51] but the spirit of God would fall on him
[1:31:53] and he would do things that seemed
[1:31:55] impossible it was impossible
[1:31:58] he would rip out a heart of a lion and
[1:32:00] he would carry the gates of God he would
[1:32:03] do all kinds of things kill a thousand
[1:32:04] Philistines at once for the Java of a
[1:32:08] mule
[1:32:09] but what was it it was a spirit that was
[1:32:12] energized and it was a spirit it was
[1:32:14] given life and every case of the Holy
[1:32:17] Spirit coming upon men he gave them
[1:32:19] ability it was like all their natural
[1:32:21] abilities were raised to a different
[1:32:23] height
[1:32:25] even a parallel pictures tried to
[1:32:27] explain it would be to say it was like a
[1:32:30] man with only black and white sight
[1:32:32] being given the ability to see in true
[1:32:35] color
[1:32:37] amen and raised it up to a whole new
[1:32:39] level to a whole new light
[1:32:42] to a whole new life with the arrival of
[1:32:45] God in power there's a flow of life that
[1:32:48] brings a transformation in man that is
[1:32:50] so dramatic
[1:32:52] that it changes him from what he used to
[1:32:55] be to what he can be
[1:32:57] it's like the sun breaking out on a
[1:33:00] cloudy day
[1:33:02] and Life coming forth in his body and he
[1:33:05] sees things like he never saw him before
[1:33:07] that's the transformation power of the
[1:33:10] almighty God at the light
[1:33:13] the life that comes into you
[1:33:18] and we have his Spirit the life the real
[1:33:21] God energy is flowing in us and we're
[1:33:25] transformed and then we can become what
[1:33:29] we're designed to be
[1:33:33] we start seeing things differently
[1:33:36] thinking differently acting differently
[1:33:38] talking differently this life in Jesus
[1:33:42] came into us and we are transformed
[1:33:49] but let me tell you it's more than
[1:33:51] transforming you into a new thought or a
[1:33:55] new thinking or a new walk
[1:34:01] begin with this because we're in the
[1:34:04] season of mortal life
[1:34:06] raising our children marrying and
[1:34:08] bringing forth families this is a season
[1:34:11] of mortal life but when we have been
[1:34:14] born above
[1:34:16] the body returns to the dust but the
[1:34:19] spirit goes up where it came from to God
[1:34:23] who gave it to us there will come
[1:34:26] another season
[1:34:28] there will come another season and that
[1:34:31] season that will come will be the season
[1:34:34] of Immortal Life
[1:34:37] and when the Son of God Rises with
[1:34:40] healing in his wings it will be totally
[1:34:42] impossible
[1:34:44] somebody say impossible it'll be totally
[1:34:46] impossible to hold these bodies in the
[1:34:49] ground any longer they'll come forth in
[1:34:52] the brightness of the Son of God for
[1:34:54] every nature to self testifies of it so
[1:34:57] if we are a Christian we're born of a
[1:34:59] spirit death can't hold nothing but
[1:35:02] victory for us because this whole
[1:35:04] corruptable body that Satan still has
[1:35:07] power over will drop into the dust of
[1:35:09] the Earth this the wrong season now this
[1:35:12] is Mortal season but Immortal season is
[1:35:14] coming
[1:35:16] Immortal season and coming and when the
[1:35:19] immortal season comes their mortal one
[1:35:22] will come and he will bring with him the
[1:35:24] immortal spirits that are returned from
[1:35:26] the earth and they'll come back in the
[1:35:28] resurrection for a great room in the
[1:35:30] Millennium and then shine in the glory
[1:35:32] forever
[1:35:35] Hallelujah we are in the season of Lies
[1:35:38] we're in the season of the Resurrection
[1:35:40] we're in the season of all things are
[1:35:42] possible we are in the season of the
[1:35:45] body chain we are in the season of death
[1:35:48] knowing it's master
[1:35:51] Hallelujah I'm here to tell you what you
[1:35:53] need to do is look at that devil that's
[1:35:56] telling you you'll never amount to
[1:35:57] nothing you'll never be anything say
[1:35:59] devil I'm in the season
[1:36:02] I'm in the season of The Immortal one
[1:36:04] the sun is shining on me I can't help
[1:36:07] but be blessed I can't help but be
[1:36:09] lifted up I can't help but it's raised
[1:36:12] to shine upon my life and change my
[1:36:15] heart in life forever
[1:36:18] you are in the season of life so if
[1:36:22] you're in that season why don't you just
[1:36:24] begin to rejoice in the light that you
[1:36:26] have heard this is my moment this is my
[1:36:29] time arise and shine
[1:36:32] for the light has come and you're not in
[1:36:35] the season of death no more even in life
[1:36:37] you're in the season of life
[1:36:42] we are not in a season of barrenness no
[1:36:45] more we're in the season of life
[1:36:51] hallelujah hallelujah I don't say that
[1:36:54] just on my own hell I say that on the
[1:36:56] ocean of the Holy Ghost we are not in
[1:36:58] the season of barrenness no more we are
[1:37:00] in the season alive
[1:37:04] we are in the season of life so if
[1:37:07] you're bearing and you're unfruitful
[1:37:09] come to the life
[1:37:15] always praise him tonight
[1:37:18] brother Michael let's praise him and I
[1:37:20] just lift up your hands
[1:37:23] I'm in the season of life
[1:37:25] I'm in the season of all things are
[1:37:27] possible
[1:37:29] gotta make a way
[1:37:31] where there seems to be no way
[1:37:36] I want to thank you right now for my
[1:37:38] child
[1:37:40] I want to thank you right now for The
[1:37:42] Impossibles to become possible I'm going
[1:37:45] to thank you right now that you're doing
[1:37:47] things you're working when we can't even
[1:37:50] see you working
[1:37:52] because we are in the season of Miracles
[1:37:54] we're in the season of Immortal Life
[1:37:57] Hallelujah so if we're believing for
[1:38:00] body change let's believe for healings
[1:38:02] and deliverances
[1:38:05] Hallelujah let's believe for our
[1:38:08] children to come back
[1:38:11] doesn't matter how impossible it may
[1:38:13] seem it doesn't matter what situations
[1:38:15] may look like it doesn't matter how dark
[1:38:17] it may seem
[1:38:21] foreign
[1:38:24] four days late
[1:38:26] but he's still the resurrection and the
[1:38:28] life
[1:38:33] oh God

[1:39:03] punches in the face from that writer
[1:39:06] Called Death

[1:39:43] don't matter there's no time it matters
[1:39:45] not to you God how long but God there's
[1:39:47] a word that someone spoke over them and
