[12:18] throne of grace we want to thank you for
[12:21] your many blessings to us the blessings
[12:24] of God that has watched over our lives
[12:26] that has brought us to this moment to
[12:28] this time we thank you Lord for the
[12:33] symbolic representation of this young
[12:36] man and woman that represents the soon
[12:39] coming of Jesus coming for a bride
[12:42] without spot or wrinkle or blemish we
[12:46] thank you Lord that they have lived
[12:47] through to that representation and today
[12:51] Oh God stand before this congregation
[12:53] now to be solemnly united in marriage
[12:57] for now and through eternity we asked
[13:01] your blessings upon them today as they
[13:04] share their love with one another and
[13:07] speak their wedding vows that will bind
[13:10] them together their hearts are bound and
[13:13] now Lord in contract they will be
[13:15] married and bound together and love
[13:18] through out their lives and we ask that
[13:21] your grace would just overshadow them
[13:23] today and bless us in your presence and
[13:26] be the witness that is here today along
[13:29] with these others assembled witnesses
[13:32] for it's in Jesus name we ask it a man
[13:36] I'm going to read from Ephesians chapter
[13:39] 5 said submitting yourselves to one one
[13:43] to another in the fear of God wives
[13:47] submit yourselves unto your own
[13:50] husband's as unto the Lord for the
[13:54] husband is the head of the wife even as
[13:56] Christ is the head of the church and he
[13:59] is the savior of the body therefore as
[14:03] the church is subject unto Christ so let
[14:07] the wives be subject to their own
[14:08] husbands in everything husbands love
[14:14] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[14:16] church and gave himself for it
[14:19] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[14:21] with the washing of water by the word
[14:24] that he might present it to himself a
[14:28] glorious church not having spot or
[14:31] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[14:33] should be holy and without blemish so
[14:37] men ought to love their wives as their
[14:40] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[14:43] loveth himself for no man ever yet hated
[14:47] his own flesh but nourishes and
[14:50] cherishes even as the Lord the church
[14:53] but we are members of his body of his
[14:57] flesh and of his bones and for this
[15:00] cause shall a man leave his father and
[15:03] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[15:05] and they too shall be one flesh this is
[15:09] a great mystery but I speak concerning
[15:11] Christ and the church nevertheless let
[15:16] every one of you in particular so love
[15:19] his wife even as himself and the wife
[15:22] see that she reverence her husband
[15:27] marriage is one of the oldest
[15:30] institutions it was ordained of God from
[15:35] the earliest ages for the first marriage
[15:39] was performed by God himself in his
[15:42] great Cathedral the Garden of Eden and
[15:45] God chose the mate for his son Adam by
[15:48] his own power of creation and with man
[15:52] and mind God made a counterpart that
[15:55] would be loving and sweet and kind how
[15:58] God must have expressed his own desires
[16:01] as he fashioned and formed ever line and
[16:04] curve of Eve's body from the rib that he
[16:07] had taken from Adam's side this lonely
[16:10] God was expressing himself through his
[16:13] own creation the scripture says he
[16:17] brought her to the man not that God
[16:21] calls out in an audible voice that names
[16:24] are mates but the Christian knowing that
[16:27] a mate is a reflection of one's true
[16:30] self
[16:32] must select them a mate that matches
[16:34] God's word because as a child of God
[16:36] they too are to match God's Word what a
[16:40] wonderful thing it is when two believers
[16:43] come together as they have today to
[16:46] reflect God's plan in God's great desire
[16:50] when God looked upon the loneliness of
[16:53] his son he said it's not good for man to
[16:57] be alone I will make a helper that is
[17:00] suitable for him so he took from the man
[17:05] a rib something that was close to his
[17:07] heart a portion of his own spirit and
[17:09] nature to make a wife for Adam surely
[17:13] God was looking far way down into the
[17:16] future when he himself would lay down
[17:18] his own life so that the necessary
[17:22] elements of water blood and spirit could
[17:24] come forth from his body there on the
[17:27] cross in order to make from that a bride
[17:31] in the Genesis account the woman was
[17:35] taken from the man and so she was a
[17:38] byproduct of the man not in any way was
[17:43] she an afterthought or any way inferior
[17:46] to the man but she was made from the man
[17:50] as butter is made from cream one is not
[17:55] better than the other but each has its
[17:57] own unique qualities God made the man
[18:00] masculine in the woman feminine and the
[18:04] roles are not reversible nor
[18:07] exchangeable the woman was not taken
[18:10] from his feet for the man to step on but
[18:14] and neither was she taken from his head
[18:17] for her to rule over him but she was
[18:20] taken from near his heart for him to
[18:25] love and to become one flesh with there
[18:29] is absolutely no doubt that God's bride
[18:32] comes from the very heart of God in this
[18:37] beautiful text that we have read from
[18:39] the Apostle Paul
[18:41] it describes the spiritual unity that
[18:44] exists but
[18:45] christ and his holy bride every bride
[18:52] and groom is to reflect the same in
[18:54] their union the Apostle Paul called it a
[18:58] great mystery that was hidden in the
[19:01] union of a man and a woman as he said
[19:04] this is a great mystery but I speak
[19:06] concerning Christ and the church and
[19:10] these words from Paul we learn of the
[19:13] unfathomable of of Christ for this sin
[19:16] cursed race and the pristine purity that
[19:21] his atoning death has obtained for all
[19:25] people for how else could be we a bride
[19:27] without spot or wrinkle or blemish this
[19:31] text presents the duties that each one
[19:34] of you will bear in your relation to
[19:36] each other as husband and wife how you
[19:39] treat these duties will not only
[19:41] determine the degree of happiness you
[19:44] enjoying your marriage but also the
[19:46] eternity of eternal destiny of your
[19:49] souls in all of life the Spirit will
[19:53] direct you to the word Jeremy as a
[19:58] husband Christ expects you to be the
[20:00] head of your wife and this headship is
[20:03] neither despotic tyranny nor selfish
[20:07] servitude but rather it is to be a
[20:10] loving guidance that has at its core
[20:13] true love it's not the love of physical
[20:18] attraction or the love of fond communion
[20:20] but rather sacrificial devotion just as
[20:24] Jesus had for us and yes the bible does
[20:28] teach that the woman should obey her
[20:30] husband this is all throughout the New
[20:32] Testament into the Bible principles but
[20:35] this should never be because of a man's
[20:37] brute strength whereby he lords over her
[20:40] with angry demands but this must come
[20:44] from a god-like and christ-like
[20:47] character that is worthy to be default
[20:49] that followed true leadership has never
[20:52] do what I say do but not what I do
[20:56] true leadership is my live
[20:59] the example life that is worthy of the
[21:02] gospel even the great Apostle Paul
[21:05] realized this when he said follow me as
[21:08] I follow Christ as a husband you were to
[21:13] love your wife as Christ loved the
[21:15] church Jesus gave up everything for the
[21:18] church he suffered he endured hardship
[21:21] for the church he forewent what was his
[21:25] own personal interests and pleasure for
[21:29] the church Jesus died for the church
[21:33] Jeremy when you were tested as a husband
[21:36] and no doubt Satan will be certain to
[21:39] test you in this regards many times in
[21:42] the years ahead you must remember to
[21:45] look back to this example the example of
[21:47] Christ the bridegroom of the church and
[21:50] draw strength in encouragement and
[21:53] direction from him and furthermore
[21:55] Jeremy as a head of your new family
[21:58] Christ expects you to exhibit leadership
[22:02] in your home when while the book of
[22:06] Proverbs chapter 31 indicates that a
[22:09] good wife is one that husband can safely
[22:12] trust to manage the home and nurture the
[22:14] children it does not absolve you as a
[22:18] responsibility to lead and guide your
[22:21] house authority resides in the head and
[22:27] just as Jesus has the ultimate authority
[22:30] over the church so will you over your
[22:33] wife and children with authority though
[22:36] comes accountability it will be your
[22:40] duty to see the spiritual physical and
[22:43] emotional needs of your family are
[22:46] provided among other things you will be
[22:49] responsible to see that your house
[22:51] serves the Lord you will be responsible
[22:55] to see that your children honor their
[22:57] parents and are obedient you will be
[23:00] responsible to maintain an adequate
[23:03] resource for their financial needs and
[23:07] Sadie the pattern and example for wife
[23:12] is
[23:13] the church like a woman the church
[23:17] submits herself to her Lord not in fear
[23:20] but in love she is overwhelmed by the
[23:24] sacrifice made for her and the blessings
[23:27] bestowed upon her therefore she obeys
[23:31] Christ and calls him Lord and even as
[23:36] Sarah did Abraham and say - you are to
[23:39] obey your husband and Satan will tempt
[23:43] you as well
[23:44] there are many voices in the land today
[23:47] that will encourage you to rebelled
[23:49] against this authority and to pursue
[23:51] your own way the call of the world will
[23:54] urge you to become an independent woman
[23:57] but now that must melt away is the two
[24:01] of you become one when those times
[24:05] arrived
[24:06] you must remember the joy and reward
[24:08] that you possess as a child of God comes
[24:10] to you only as you submit to Jesus so
[24:14] the joy and happiness of marriage can
[24:16] only be realized when you submit to your
[24:19] husband encourage listen and follow and
[24:24] respect and follow him another attribute
[24:27] of the church is that you must clothe
[24:29] yourself in purity even as you committed
[24:33] to do as a Christian girl now for many
[24:36] many years the church that Christ will
[24:40] claim for his own and is upon his return
[24:44] is a glorious church not having spot or
[24:47] wrinkle or any such thing Paul said that
[24:50] he had espoused the Corinthian church to
[24:53] Christ as a chaste virgin and since a
[24:57] young girl you have prepared for this
[24:59] day and therefore you have kept yourself
[25:01] pure and this continued fidelity to your
[25:07] husband will contribute much to the
[25:10] success in your marriage and in like the
[25:14] church the woman cannot let her head be
[25:17] turned by the fashions of this day and
[25:20] the trends of society so that your
[25:24] beauty is only skin-deep
[25:27] but continue to display for your husband
[25:30] that thing within you that is an
[25:32] incorruptible ornament which is in the
[25:36] sight of God is of great price truly
[25:40] your husband is just responsible to be
[25:43] pure and chaste and holy as you however
[25:46] your character will do much to draw your
[25:49] husband closer to you these words of the
[25:53] Apostle Paul are essential to the
[25:56] success of your marriage charity or love
[26:00] some suffers long and is kind charity
[26:03] info in Viet not charity is bonnet not
[26:06] up itself is not puffed up does not
[26:09] behave itself unseemly seeketh not her
[26:12] own is not easily provoked thinketh no
[26:14] evil it rejoices not in iniquity but
[26:17] rejoices and truth if beareth all things
[26:19] believeth all things hopeth all things
[26:21] endureth all things charity never fails
[26:26] well no one doubts your love to each
[26:30] other today those of us have been
[26:33] married for some time know that there's
[26:35] that it's yet nothing compared to what
[26:39] it can be and should be there will be a
[26:44] day when passion will wane there will be
[26:47] times when tenderness will be tried what
[26:51] is it that's going to sustain you in
[26:53] that hour it is love not the love that
[26:57] is felt or aroused but loved that is
[27:00] learned so with these things in mind
[27:05] and these admonition let us complete the
[27:09] marriage vow the Bible says that
[27:13] marriage is to be held in honorable and
[27:15] that is to be esteemed and respected our
[27:19] regard for our bonds of matrimony rests
[27:22] entirely in the person of Almighty God
[27:25] because it is he who ordained it is he
[27:28] that governs it the book of Malachi
[27:31] states that is also he that witnesses
[27:33] the oaths that are taken in marriage so
[27:39] Jeremy and
[27:40] sadee you stand together today as the
[27:43] children of God redeemed through Jesus
[27:46] Christ is it your purpose to establish a
[27:50] home that is truly Christ centered where
[27:54] the Word of God is read and obeyed a
[27:56] home that will be welded together by
[27:59] prayer in which the Holy Spirit is your
[28:01] consonant guide is that your intentions
[28:04] and yours so I'm going to ask you now if
[28:11] you will please just join your right
[28:13] hands together
[28:20] Jeremy Sadie has given you one of the
[28:24] most sacred things under heaven a
[28:27] woman's life and a woman's love it is so
[28:32] sacred brother Branham would equate it
[28:35] to being the next best thing to
[28:37] receiving the very Spirit of God the
[28:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[28:42] you may bring her great joy or you could
[28:46] cause her great sorrow it is not what
[28:49] you bring her in a material way that
[28:51] will make true happiness because riches
[28:55] without love it's nothing
[28:59] the gift without the giver is bear the
[29:03] practice of those virtues as a husband
[29:05] that you've shown as her lover will keep
[29:07] her heart one to you you are to be true
[29:10] and loyal patient and sickness
[29:13] comforting in sorrow and forsaking all
[29:16] others keep yourself only unto her as

[29:26] you pledge to keep these promises Sadie
[29:32] this man Jeremy is to be your husband on
[29:36] your life your love and devotion he will
[29:39] lean for strength and inspiration he's
[29:43] going to look to you for encouragement
[29:45] for cheerfulness and confidence no
[29:49] matter what the world may say about him
[29:50] or think and people may forget him
[29:53] lose confidence in him turned their
[29:55] backs upon him but you must not may your
[29:58] love and your life be an inspiration
[30:01] that will constantly lead him to greater
[30:04] dependence upon our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:07] Sadie were you pledged to do so then I
[30:13] will require a token that this covenant
[30:15] will always be kept

[34:56] that you would endow them with virtues
[34:59] Lord that would be so cleanse by the
[35:02] holy spirit so that you can use their
[35:05] gifts to bless the body of Christ

[35:21] them today and I bless their marriage
