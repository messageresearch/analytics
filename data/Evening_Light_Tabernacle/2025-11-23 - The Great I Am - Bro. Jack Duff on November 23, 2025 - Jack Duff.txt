Whatever you want to do, &gt;&gt; we just come to worship the Lord. But uh a [music] few years ago, my daughter wrote a song and um such an encouragement to us uh at home and many of the saints were blessed by it. And when she wrote [music] it, she said, "Dad, I want you to sing this song." And um she given it to me and [music] I start singing it. And then um we were invited to a night of worship there at brother Paula Fontaine and uh brother Wesley Van Wick. [music] He said, "Sister Rebecca, we want you to sing the song. I know you gave it to your dad, but we want you to sing it." And that was like really her first time ever singing it. And from that uh video, some of the saints here, Sister Rebecca got a hold of it and [music] uh she started singing it and uh we happened to hear it at home. we were watching um and we [music] saw the song being sung here and we were just so blessed in our home in in West Palm Beach that man this song has taken off [music] and and going places and being a blessing to people. So we're we're grateful. So when I I knew I was coming, I said I'll I'll try to sing that amen here uh for you all. I know you're familiar with it. Amen.

[applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Father we pray that the spirit of God &gt;&gt; will take us higher and [music] take us deeper &gt;&gt; deeper in the love of God. What a privilege it is to [music] come into your house and to worship you and to praise you. &gt;&gt; Forget about everything that we're going through and just concentrate [music] on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Believe things happen when we come into your presence. [music] Change occurs when we come into your presence. We're asking God that you would just take control of the next portion of the service &gt;&gt; to turn our heart to the word of God. the eternal living word of God. May Father, you come forth and may you speak to your people. Bring strength, [music] Lord, to each and every circumstance and situation. Lord, we commit this [music] portion of service into your hands. Thank you for all that you have done thus far. And we welcome, Father, the rest of the [music] service. It's in Jesus name that we pray. Amen. Can we give the Lord another hand of praise? [applause] [applause] We praise the Lord. Amen. We'll turn in our Bibles to very familiar passage of scripture. Uh when I call it out, I know that you don't even have to turn to it because you will just quote it to me. Hebrews 13 and 8. The Bible declares Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. We are taking uh thought today. Amen. On the great I am. And um I know this is uh probably something that you have heard and and it's probably um good for me to announce that I don't bring anything new. &gt;&gt; I'm saying what all the other ministers are saying. And as I was just speaking with brother Tim, I've seen so many people try to be different and bring things new that maybe nobody else has ever seen. And I think when you start getting into areas like that, you get lost. You get confused because why would God Amen. make it so special that you the only one &gt;&gt; that can see it? That's not the way God does things. &gt;&gt; He loves us all and he would want all of us to know. So, amen. You shouldn't be so special that you're the only one got a revelation that nobody else knows about, right? Praise the Lord. So, we we've all been through things like that. But uh as I bring this talk today, I know there'll be things that I'll say that you're very familiar with, but I'm hoping by the end of this journey uh we will trace the great I am. &gt;&gt; We want to we want to see where he has been and we want to see he where he is today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. So bear with me. I want to just uh read a few statements just to get us amen in the right channel. Uh, and um, they did not give me a time limit on the sermon, so I'll watch the clock. [laughter] Amen. But here in the message, Hebrews chapter 5 and six, brother Brandham makes a statement. He says, "And on his road down, he struck an experience." He's talking about Paul says, "The Holy Spirit come out in a big pillar of fire and it blinded him." Says, "Now we've went through that. The pillar of fire was Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the pillar of fire was Christ. Amen. And they said he's the same pillar of fire that led the children through the wilderness. Christ was God and God was Christ. &gt;&gt; Says God was made flesh and dwelt in the body of the Lord Jesus. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself showing what he was in the Bible back here. And the former verses we've been reading that he made himself Lord and the angels taken on the form not of angels but taken on a form of flesh. Angels had not fallen. They need no redemption. Flesh had fell human beings and they needed redemption. So in the old laws a man could be a redeemer. First he had to be kin folks. The great book of Ruth went through there went through here some time ago. And how that God being a spirit this is the key point that I want to make here. God being spirit was made kinfolk with us by becoming one of us in order to redeem us and give us eternal life. And look at this. He says this. He says he had to become us &gt;&gt; that we through grace &gt;&gt; might become as he. &gt;&gt; He had to become us &gt;&gt; so we could become as he. &gt;&gt; We're not just in the message just to be in the message. There is a purpose and a goal here for God drawing you to the revealed word for this hour is so that you could become he. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. He goes on to say he says and we find the pillar of fire. Amen. That led the children of Israel and when it was made flesh here on earth we hear him talking one day and he claimed that he was the pillar of fire. Says they said do you say that you're greater than our father Abraham. said before Abraham was &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Who was the I am? Brother man asked the question. Who was the I am? He says the pillar of fire in the burning bush, a perpetual memorial through every generation. Not only that generation, but this generation, the same pillar of fire. And we're thankful this morning that we even have the picture of it. Amen. He has not changed. And we're not just talking about a pillar of fire that led the children of Israel out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; And the pillar of fire that Paul met met on the road to Damascus. It's the same now. But he didn't stop there. That pillar of fire took a picture with his prophet. And there's been many services since the prophet has left where the same pillar of fire has showed up in the congregation. Brother, he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. The great I am is here. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You know, there was a a time in Israel's history uh before God actually displayed himself as this great pillar of fire and led them uh through Egypt. He gave a a promise to them in Genesis chapter 15. Glory to God. Verse 13- 16. We'll read it here really quick. It says he said to said unto Abram, "Know of assurityity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them 400 years." &gt;&gt; He says, "And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and after it shall they come out with great substance." &gt;&gt; I love these scriptures. &gt;&gt; It says, "And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace. Thou shalt be buried in a good old age. It says, "But the fourth generation." &gt;&gt; Amen. They shall come hither again, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like that fourth generation. I can't go in there today, but I know I know why brother Aaron said. Amen. But but but here here's what I want you to understand. Amen. that in this promise, God is telling Abraham that, you know, your seed, they're going to suffer for about 400 years and uh but God's going to bring them out with a mighty hand. Now, when it's in promise form, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God could be known as the great I will be. &gt;&gt; Or God could be known as the great I will do. &gt;&gt; When it's in promise form, amen, it's a future tense work. So it would be the great I will do or the great I will be. &gt;&gt; But I'm not preaching about the great I will be or the great I will do. I'm preaching about the great I am. &gt;&gt; You see when the when the when the time of deliverance came for the children of Israel the promise was actually now coming to pass. So his name changes. Amen. When the situation changes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when you begin to I mean you might be going through a sickness but when he becomes your healer he's not the I will do or I will be. He becomes the I am &gt;&gt; I am your healer. I am your deliverer. I am your way maker. I am I am I am &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel pretty good. &gt;&gt; My God. My God. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, brother. [laughter] But here, you know, when we go back and we look, Amen. at scripture in Exodus 3, uh, we we pick them up there in in verse one, because now the time of fulfillment is coming for this promise that he made Abram. Hallelujah. Exodus 3 and verse one. Bear with me. Amen. I love this. Amen. We're not talking about the I will be the I. Amen. I used to be. No, I am. Here we see uh verse one says, "Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire, that pillar of fire, right? Uh and a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush, and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed." And Moses said,"I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt." And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him, Amen, out of the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Draw not nigh hither, but put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place where on thou standest is holy ground. Mori said, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. Verse seven, "And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people." So now the we're we're we're moving now into manifestation of the promise that God gave. And I want to tell somebody today, you're moving into manifestation of the promise that God gave you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. There's a season where you got to hold on, but then there's a season where it changes &gt;&gt; and you begin to rejoice for the manifestation that God has brought to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse seven again. And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt. Amen. Uh and and and have heard their cry. I by by reason of their tasks, for I know their sorrows. For I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of the land, that land unto a good land, and a large unto land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Parizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is coming to me, and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the uh Egyptians oppressed them. God sees your oppression, &gt;&gt; and he wants to do something about it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Watch this now. Amen. He says, "Come now therefore, and I will send thee under Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt." And Moses said inh uh uh uh Moses said unto God, "Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" He says, "Certainly, I will be with thee, and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee uh when thou when thou has brought forth the people of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain." Watch this now. It says, "And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, the God of your fathers has sent me unto you, and they shall say to me, what is his name? What shall I say unto them? &gt;&gt; Now, Moses thought he had God stumped. &gt;&gt; They're going to want to know what your name is &gt;&gt; when I go into to into Egypt and I try to tell them that the God of their fathers that sent me, they need to know your name. He thought he had God stumped. &gt;&gt; But God answered the question. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anytime you think you got a question for God, he has an answer for you. It might not be the answer that you like, but he's going to have an answer for you. &gt;&gt; Look at the answer that God gives Moses. &gt;&gt; And God said unto Moses, you want to know my name? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God said unto Moses, I am &gt;&gt; that I am. &gt;&gt; And he said, thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, I am have sent me unto you. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Now that blessed me. Because when God gave Moses an answer to his question, he did not give him a past tense name. &gt;&gt; He did not give him a future tense name. &gt;&gt; But God gave Moses a name that could be used from generation to generation to generation. [cheering] That name can still be used today. What is his name? I am that I am. If you need healing, [screaming] I am. Hallelujah. If you need deliverance, [cheering] &gt;&gt; praise God. I don't care what you're bound in. He is still the great. &gt;&gt; He's still the great I am. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad Moses asked that question. &gt;&gt; Because we benefit from the revelation &gt;&gt; of who God is. That's right. &gt;&gt; I was looking at a Let me put it this way. I was not just looking. I was listening to a tape. &gt;&gt; I want to make that clear. I was listening. &gt;&gt; I I was listening to a tape. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I pressed play. &gt;&gt; I've always been pressing play. &gt;&gt; Ever since I came to the message, &gt;&gt; I've been pressing play. That's how I get inspiration for my sermons by pressing play. &gt;&gt; Hallelu. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. I was listening to the tape and this is how the sermon came to me. And this this the sermon that brother Brandon preached was a sermon called perfect faith. &gt;&gt; And and he made a statement there. He says now and I want to just I want to just coast here just for a little bit. Uh but we're going to pick up and and go some places. I'm eventually I'm going to turn a corner in this sermon because I got to we got to trace the great I am. We got to trace him. &gt;&gt; We see him back here in Exodus when he gives his name to Moses, but we got to trace him right through the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I can tell you even before he spoke to Moses in this fashion in Genesis, he identified himself as the I am. &gt;&gt; We'll get there later. &gt;&gt; But let me just share this this little quote with you out of our perfect faith. Brother Brandon makes a statement says, "Many of you will be waiting over till in the morning that's got a long distance to go and I appreciate that effort. Some of you will drive home tonight cuz you got to go to work by daylight in the morning and I know it's hard." And then when I think I see that, he says, he says, "I see that." He says, "I get spells, too." &gt;&gt; A a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I get spells, too. You know, and look at what he says. I get moody. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. Oh, not a prophet. A prophet is spiritual all the time, brother. Never has any problems. No issues at all. That's not what he said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, "I get spells, too, and I get moody." See, I like to just bring things like this because we need to we need to see the humanity &gt;&gt; of God's prophet. I'm going to tell you the reason that we have so many problems because people miss the humanity. Can you imagine being around the prophet and he gets moody? &gt;&gt; You know what happens with me when I get moody? &gt;&gt; I don't even want to talk. &gt;&gt; Oh, I guess we don't have anybody in here that gets moody. I don't even want to talk. And and people might say, "You got an evil spirit on you, brother. You got a bad spirit because you don't talk." No, just give me grace. &gt;&gt; I'm just a little bit moody. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he gets moody. Somebody just got free right there. [applause] It &gt;&gt; It's good to see the humanity of things. Let's be sane, Christian. &gt;&gt; I I like the way he put that, right? So, he says, "I get moody. I get spells. I get all He says, I get moody. get to a spot where what gets me is when I get to to to those spells when I c when I get all overworked. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said when I get all overworked that's when this comes on me. He says um and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you. &gt;&gt; You really haven't got a friend in the world. &gt;&gt; See and say and remember he and look at this. He says I'm not immune &gt;&gt; from temptation. That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, "I got to overcome that." Then when I look back and see something like this, I put it right back in his face and say, "What about that?" And that helps me to overcome what about that. Now, now he was going on in this in this in this quote and he was talking about an experience of a young brother that somebody approached this young man and begin to kind of try to cast doubt on brother Brandham's meetings. And uh now maybe you should, you know, that that's that's they off to work. they this, they that, and maybe you shouldn't be with, and they're just kind of casting all kind of doubt. &gt;&gt; Well, this young man um he didn't really know what to say when all these people were coming against him. So, what happened was that somebody at a meeting, amen, in a town where these people were coming from to come against brother Brandham. He said somebody was in a meeting and got prayed for and got healed in the meeting. Amen. And when they got healed in the meeting, that young man took them back to that experience. He says, "Now, I know you're saying this and you're saying that, but you know, sister so and so was really going through a lot, but she got healed in the meeting. The vindication alone was enough to keep that young man stabilized." &gt;&gt; God has already vindicated this this message. We don't have to do any more vindication. It has already been vindicated. &gt;&gt; He said he said he says uh he says now he says uh uh you we know about that sister. We know how bad her condition was. And now that lady is perfectly healed. And that young man looked to them people that were criticizing the message. He says, "What about that?" &gt;&gt; And see what it is is that sometimes you have to go back in your mind and realize what God has already done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he don't do anymore, you can go back to what he has already done and look the devil in his eye and say, "What about that?" You already seen God heal cancer in this church. &gt;&gt; What about that? Sister had stage four cancer and God brought her back. What about that &gt;&gt; brother in the [screaming] hospital dying and Amen. And and God raised him up when when the pastor cast that spirit off of him. What about that? [cheering] &gt;&gt; We got witnesses here of God being a a healer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't tell us about the great I was &gt;&gt; tell us about the great I am. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes in this message says so this young man knowing that he said then explain her case that settled it. Explain you know she had cancer. She here she was here in Louisville and the doctors was to perform the operation just simply she had cancer. Uh he says uh they they turned and and and solded her put her put her back. nothing could be done and now she is perfectly well. &gt;&gt; He said explain that that settled it. You know what the Bible said and they could say nothing a miss &gt;&gt; because the man was standing right in their midst on whom the miracle was done on. &gt;&gt; And that's where we that's where he say it puts Satan to a shame, doesn't it? The man was standing there that the miracle was performed on. Does God raise the dead? &gt;&gt; He say here sits a man right here raised from the dead. Does God heal the sick? He says, "Oh my, the hands could just go up everywhere." God [screaming] heals the sick. &gt;&gt; And brother Randle said, "We know he's the great, &gt;&gt; the great I am, &gt;&gt; not the great I was &gt;&gt; or will be. &gt;&gt; I am." &gt;&gt; That's right. I am that's ever present, everywhere, all times. the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. As I said, you could go back in the book of Genesis and God had used this name I am before. Uh go back to Genesis 15 and and one. We'll see what he says here to Abraham. It says, "After these things, the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield &gt;&gt; and thy exceeding great reward." &gt;&gt; So, he's [clears throat] already using this title, I am I He's telling Abram, I am your shield &gt;&gt; and your exceeding great reward. And and I I looked that up and I found that uh the word shield there, it means that I am the place where you place your faith. &gt;&gt; When he's telling you that I am your shield, that means I'm the place that you place your faith. Sometimes we try to use mama as a shield. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we try to use daddy as a shield. &gt;&gt; But God says, "I am your shield. I am the place that you put your faith. That's right. &gt;&gt; And when you got your faith placed in Christ, then it becomes your exceeding &gt;&gt; and great reward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I want to I want to just kind of share just how how how how quick Abraham saw it. So, this is Genesis 15 that God is telling him this. But in Genesis 14, praise God, I believe it was the the previous chapter there, uh where Abraham had a uh Lot got into some trouble and always is that Lot was just always in trouble &gt;&gt; and Abraham would have to go and try to rescue Lot and get him out of this and get him out of that and what are you in now, Lot? Go get him. I mean, it was just always trouble with Lot. But Abraham never gave up on his brother. That's the That's the spirit of Christ. that's supposed to be and all of us not give up on our brothers and not give up on our sisters. &gt;&gt; No matter what condition they find themselves in, we still go after them with Christ went after us. &gt;&gt; But when Abraham overcame, he went and he battled these five kings and and when he overcame, they began to try to give Abraham a reward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and Abraham said, "No, I don't want anything from y'all unless y'all say that y'all y'all going to get some glory out." say I don't want I don't want to have anything to do with that. And after Abraham said no, Abraham met &gt;&gt; Melzdc, &gt;&gt; the very person MelzDC. And and here he's told in the next chapter say, you know what? I'm your shield. I'm the place that you put your faith. You didn't even have any weapons, but you went out after your brother anyway. I am your shield &gt;&gt; and you're exceeding in great reward &gt;&gt; pretty much. Now, he's given Abraham a promise that just turn and look around with the as far as your eyes can see. &gt;&gt; I've given you that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He became Abraham's shield and his great reward. I want to tell you another thing. When Abraham said no to those king those those kings and the offering that they were trying to give him, he said no to it. I want to I want to just say something very personal here to you. If Satan comes along and offers you a job, &gt;&gt; come on buddy, &gt;&gt; with a lot of money, &gt;&gt; great benefits, &gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt; you're going to have to miss church. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to say no to that. &gt;&gt; And if you say no to it, I'm here to encourage you. &gt;&gt; God himself &gt;&gt; will be your shield &gt;&gt; and your exceeding great reward. Genesis 17, we see another time where God uses this term, I am. And here in Genesis 17:1, it says, when Abram was 90 years old and nine, it says, "The Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him, I am &gt;&gt; the Almighty God. Walk before me and be thou perfect." Now we got to understand when God is telling Abraham in this scripture that he is the almighty God, there was a little bit more being said than that. And what brother Random tells us that this is telling us that God became his El Shadai. &gt;&gt; I am your El Shadai, which means I am the breasted God. &gt;&gt; Anytime you need strength, you just lean on me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, we had a a a a family in the church and they had recently uh had a baby and I noticed that, you know, uh and being a father myself, I noticed there's times in the life, especially when they're they're they're newborns, there's times where you hear him crying and as a father, you want to go and you want to try to soo the baby and you pick it up and you pat it on the back and you just doing everything you can and seem like every time you touch the baby, the baby starts screaming harder and harder and harder and just I mean louder and louder and louder like it's like nothing you could do. But all of a sudden, you turn and you give the baby to mama. &gt;&gt; And when mama just gets that baby next to her breast, the baby just begins to calm down. It's something about Amen. going to the breasted God. &gt;&gt; All the worries begin to subside when you can make your way to the breasted God. &gt;&gt; I am El Shadai. &gt;&gt; I am thy shield. I am thy great exceeding and great reward. I am all this and more. &gt;&gt; Let's look at something here. Uh in Isaac's day, God actually tells him in Genesis 26:24, God speaks to Isaac and he tells him, it says, "And the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said, I am the God of Abraham, thy father. Fear not," Hallelujah. Here's a a good one. "I am with thee." And if he was with Isaac, if he was with Abraham, he's also with you to this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. &gt;&gt; We got to trace this I am through the scriptures. I found them also in Psalms 46. Amen. And 10. Glory to God. This is the the scripture that my my daughter uh uses. The whole Psalm 46 is where she gave birth to that song, You Are With Me. It comes out of Psalm 46. I won't take time to read it all, but you can as homework. But in in verse 10, it says something in verse 10. And Psalm 46 says, "Be still." &gt;&gt; And know that I am God. &gt;&gt; I will be exalted among the heathen. I will be exalted in the earth. I like that. Sometimes we get real fidgety. We get we want to get in God's way, but no, God said, "Be still &gt;&gt; and know that I am God." I heard a sermon last week that was preached to me. He said, "Just just just just the power of committal, being able to commit something to God and not pick it up anymore &gt;&gt; until God manifests himself. Be still and know that I am God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Also in Psalm 81:10, another one. I love this because uh this one there was a a George Mueller, if you ever heard his story, he was a man that had orphanages back in um in England. And uh and George Mueller, I was reading his his little biography, a little book that he written, and he says, you know, he used to pray prayers in a certain way uh like Lord, would you do this and Lord, would you do that and just just meet my need? Like one one minister said uh to me uh he said to our church a few weeks ago, he says, "Sometimes we pray that God would just give us enough gas money to get to church. God, I need just enough gas money to get to church." No, no, no, no. That's that's not the God we serve. You not only need gas money to get to church, you're going to need gas money to get home from church, and you need gas money to go to work next week. So when you're asking God, don't just ask for enough gas money to get to church. Ask for money for the whole week. That's exactly right. I mean, just ask God for big things. So, this man, George Mueller, said he used to ask very small things until he read this one scripture. &gt;&gt; When he read the scripture, he turned and started asking God for a lot greater things and said, and and and God began to fill his house with these greater things. Look at what the what the scripture was. says in in Psalms 81:10, "I am the Lord thy God, &gt;&gt; which brought thee out of the land of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Open thy mouth &gt;&gt; wide &gt;&gt; open your mouth wide &gt;&gt; and I will fill it." &gt;&gt; But I mean that that's that I mean wide means big. O I mean open up and ask for big things. &gt;&gt; And said George Mueller read that scripture and said it changed his whole outlook on how he should have be approaching God. And from that day, not only did a man have one orphanage, he started having multiple orphanages. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me go on a little further. Song of Solomon says this verse chapter 2 verse one. I am the rose of Sharon &gt;&gt; and the lily of the valleys. This I am is being traced right through the scriptures. &gt;&gt; God is using this this term this title I am. And it's all over the scriptures. We we find it even all the way down in the book of Revelation. Revelation 22:16. It says, "I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to thee these things and churches. I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star." Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation 18, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, sayeth the Lord, which is and which was and which is to come, the Almighty. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything you need. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to make a turn. There was a story in scripture. Brother Brandham made it very clear to us that when we look at this lady, her life looked in shambles. so bad that she was not invited to go to the well at the same time of day that the other ladies would go to the &gt;&gt; she was a prostitute and she uh makes her way to the well uh one day and as she's on her way with her pots walking up to uh the well to get water somebody's sitting there at the well and she begins to enter into a conversation with this man that's sitting there and as she's talking to this man. Um, you know, the man's like, they got to talking about worship like, oh, you know, we worship over there and y'all worship over here and y'all say, you know, this and that. He says, you know, I'm not really here to kind of talk about that cuz, uh, you know, actually, uh, if you drink of the water that I got to offer, &gt;&gt; so you never thirst again. &gt;&gt; And this would be like living wells of water coming out of your soul. She say, she's like, "Wait a minute. You ain't even got nothing to draw water with. What are you talking about?" I said, "No, no, the water." And I'm talking about a little different than what what you're looking for. And and he said, he said, "You'll never thirst again." He said, she said, "Sir, give me this water." &gt;&gt; I want water like that that I'll never thirst again. He said, "Well, before I can give you a drink of this water, one issue." Brother Ram said the sin question had to be settled. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, he said, he said, "One one issue," he said, "Go get your husband &gt;&gt; and come." She looked down. She says, "Um, I don't have no husband." He say, "Well said." Now, she never even got a chance to confess everything, &gt;&gt; but they were on the same wavelength. &gt;&gt; She said, "I don't have a husband." She, he said, he said, "Well said, because the one you living with right now is not your husband." Amen. &gt;&gt; She said, "Uh, sir, they told us that when Messiah comes, these are some of the things that he's going to be doing." &gt;&gt; And and and and uh I mean, I know I learned in Sunday school about Messiah, but but I've never seen this coming to manifestation. Say, she said, and she said, "But they said this is what Messiah would do." And this is what Jesus said to her. &gt;&gt; Come on. She says I he pretty much said I am the Messiah that you've been looking for. Now he could not reveal himself like that to anybody else but to her because she had a predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; I am he that you've been looking for. &gt;&gt; And when she heard the I am was in flesh, &gt;&gt; she took off running through the city. &gt;&gt; Come see a man who has told me the things that I've done. Is not [screaming] this &gt;&gt; from one experience at the well. Is not this the very Messiah? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you see her experience there at the well. Jesus actually uh uh uh expressed to her the sign of the Messiah by revealing her sins. &gt;&gt; And then after he revealed her sins, he he revealed himself. Now let's watch this. &gt;&gt; Brother Random told us that you know um in this message recognizing your day in its message. He says if they only recognize the promised son of Messiah, the son of the son of man, he come in the name of the son of man. No. Now he was in the name through the Pentecostal age and the holy spirit son of god. Now the next thing is the millennium of son of David. Three sons name say three sons same god same father son holy ghost. Same God, son of David, son of God, the son of David, son of man, son of God, and the same God all the time, just in three different office works. So is the father, son, and holy ghost. Not three gods, but the same God in three dispensations, three office works as father, son, and holy spirit. He says, but like today, traditionally blinded, they was then traditionally blinded, they don't see it. Why can't they see it? He says, they never will see it. Remember that's thus sayeth the Lord. And that's sad. That's sad. I was talking to the brothers earlier say people that walk with the prophet, &gt;&gt; slept with the prophet, &gt;&gt; watch the miracles firsthand, watch the discernment firsthand and could not see it. And the prophet said they never will. &gt;&gt; Well, who is this message for? &gt;&gt; They're sitting here right now. &gt;&gt; We see it and we thank God for it. He says uh he says that's thus says Lord say why why are you standing up there? He says just the same as John did and just as the rest of them did. There was one sticking here and there that got to be brought out. Oh sheep of God, hear the voice of God. My sheep hear my voice. It said the woman at the well recognized her day by the sign of the Messiah. She was in a bad shape. She didn't have she didn't want to fool with them old churches. And I like what he says. She didn't want to fool with them old churches. This mean this lady had a desire to go to church &gt;&gt; but didn't like what she was seeing in the church and that's how she ended up in the condition she was in because of what was happening in the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a lot of people out like like like that. A lot of people out in the world because of what happened in church and they just need to find something real. &gt;&gt; She didn't want to fool with the old churches. They that they were they that what what they were doing they were living every way and things they were doing. She didn't believe in that stuff, but she know there should come one one day. The poor little fellow up there on the way to the well, she found that thing that she was looking for. &gt;&gt; When he began to reveal to her the secret of a heart, told her the sin that she was living in. She said, "Sir, I perceive that you're a prophet." &gt;&gt; Now, they hadn't had one for 400 years. Said, "I perceive that you're a prophet. I know that when the Messiah comes, he will do these things." He said, "I am he." She recognized there was no more question. How can you prove it? It was already proved. When Messiah cometh, this is what he'll do. Well, if she recognized it by the scriptures, what? But but can't we recognize the evening lights and the sign of today? We know when Messiah cometh, he'll show us all these things. He tells us this. He said, "I am he that speaks to you." No more questions. Away she went. She told the people, "Come see. Here he is." No more question to her. It was set up because she recognized the day she was living and she recognized it. I like that. I'm at a spot in my Christian journey. I don't have any questions &gt;&gt; about this message. &gt;&gt; It don't matter how many more websites are produced. &gt;&gt; I have no questions. &gt;&gt; None whatsoever. And and I remember a person kind of talking to me like, "Well, it's probably a waste of time to talk to you about this." It is. I mean, you be my guest. If you want to just try to get all the wind out that you can, be my guest. But it's not going to change my mind. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you bring up. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to change my mind. I simply believe. &gt;&gt; And that's what believers do. We believe. &gt;&gt; In this time of Jesus on the earth, he he he he he tells this lady, "I'm the one that you've been looking for. The very Messiah you've been looking for. I am he." But you know with the Sadducees and the Pharisees, he never revealed himself in that matter to them. &gt;&gt; There was a conversation that was conducted in uh John 8. A conversation in John 8 that Jesus has with the with the religious leaders. And let's look at this verse 53 says, "Art thou greater than thy father Abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead? Whom makest thou thyself?" Jesus answered, "If I honor myself, my honor is nothing. It is my father that honorth me, of whom you say that that he is your God. Yet ye have not known him, but I know him. &gt;&gt; And if I sh if I should say I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you, &gt;&gt; my God. But I know him and keep his saying. Now watch this. Your father Abraham, because they ask him, say, you saying you greater than our father Abraham? He dead. But look at what Jesus said. Your father Abraham rejoice to see my day. &gt;&gt; Look at this. and he saw it. &gt;&gt; Not only that, and was glad. Now, the question was, you think you greater than our father Abraham and he's dead? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Jesus answer, Amen. Here in verse 56, your father Abraham rejoice &gt;&gt; to see my day and he saw it and and was glad. Verse verse 57. Then said the Jews unto him, "Thou art not 50 years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?" &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, &gt;&gt; before Abraham was, &gt;&gt; wait a minute, we heard this language before when he talked to Moses, he used these these same words." But before Abraham was, [screaming] I am &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; They they had a good question. &gt;&gt; You saying that you you you you you're greater than our father Abraham and he's dead. How how did Abraham see Christ's day, rejoiced in it, and was glad? How could this happen if Abraham was dead before Jesus actually came on the scene? Well, brother Brandham tells us &gt;&gt; about 12:00 noon &gt;&gt; one day, &gt;&gt; God comes down in a body of skin &gt;&gt; with two angels &gt;&gt; and they're walking there down those dusty trails &gt;&gt; and they get there to Abraham's house &gt;&gt; and they begin to have some fellowship and Abraham first words it says, "My Lord," even though he saw three visitors, his revelation that these three are one. &gt;&gt; Hallelu. Even though we might see a father, son, and the holy ghost as titles, we know those three are one. &gt;&gt; Abraham said, Abra Abraham say, "Oh, wait, wait a minute. Say, I got these three visitors say there's something special about." He say, "Sarah, Sarah, get something prepared really quick because we got these vision. Let's get them some food." And as they're sitting there and they're fellowshipping and everything and all of a sudden the great I am speaks to Abraham and he says now I'm going to visit you at the time of life &gt;&gt; and Sarah thy wife shall have a son. He says uh now a couple days later before Abraham had laughed but this day Sarah was laughing &gt;&gt; and while he was there with his back to the tent &gt;&gt; he said why is Sarah laughing &gt;&gt; Sarah said I'm not laughing I'm not laugh said no no sir I heard you laugh I know you're laughing even though it wasn't out loud it was inside but I still heard the let me tell you something God knows when you're doubting on the inside. &gt;&gt; You can try to have all kind of faith on the outside, but God knows whether it's real on the inside. &gt;&gt; And Sarah was laughing on the inside. He says, "Why is Sarah laughing?" So when he had his back turned to the tent and he discerned what was going on inside the tent, that was when Abraham was seeing &gt;&gt; that day. &gt;&gt; And he rejoiced when he saw it. &gt;&gt; That's right. and was glad. &gt;&gt; When Abraham saw the sign of the Messiah, just like the woman at the well saw the sign of Messiah, he rejoiced and was glad. [applause] Hallelujah. And there are eyewitnesses that were in Brother Brandham's meetings and they saw for themsel the sign of the Messiah. They rejoice &gt;&gt; and they've been glad ever since. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could speak words like that &gt;&gt; because of what happened there when when when when when when the when the secrets of the heart &gt;&gt; were revealed. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. Even today, the secrets of the heart are still being revealed. There is many a times you walk into this church and a minister begins to preach and he's preaching what just happened in your car on the way to the church. &gt;&gt; That ain't nothing but the sign of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today and forever. When we have experiences like this where we see God moving in certain ways and we know that this was this this had to be God. Didn't nobody tell the preacher that this had to be God. &gt;&gt; There was a question that came in Jesus day that comes again today. And in Jesus day, Jesus asked the question, who do men &gt;&gt; say that I am? Now, we can tell what everybody else is saying. We can just pull up a website and tell them what men are saying about the message. Who do men say &gt;&gt; that I, the son of man, am? Some say, "You Elias, Jeremiah, one of the prophets, these people confused. They don't know who you are." &gt;&gt; And Jesus got tired of the just the the the the the little conversation they're having. He says, "Okay, I'm gonna change the the subject." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Who Do you say &gt;&gt; that I, the son of man, am &gt;&gt; now? It goes from a group question &gt;&gt; to an individual question. And now you got to be able to give an individual answer. &gt;&gt; And only one that spoke up and said anything was Peter. Peter said, "Well, I don't know what they got to say, &gt;&gt; but what I got to say, thou art [screaming] &gt;&gt; the the the the son of God." &gt;&gt; He said, "Blessed are your eyes, Peter, cuz flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my father in heaven did." He says, "Upon this rock, I'll build my church." You need to know who he is. &gt;&gt; Not who he was, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not who he will be. &gt;&gt; But who he is. Peter had a present tense revelation and you're going to need the same exact thing. I need a present tense revelation. We thank God for the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But he's not here anymore. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, who do you say? &gt;&gt; I Christ am. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And let me ask another question. Where is &gt;&gt; the I am? Okay, let's keep going. &gt;&gt; I want you to go with me on a testimony brother Brandham gave gave. And I didn't even realize this until right now. He preached a message in Shreport, Louisiana. And the message is titled testimony. And he shares this. He says, "I went back up to the top of the mountain again, finding my way through the blowing, twisting trees." So, this is the Colorado storm. It says, "I sat down, took my gun, and keep the scope from getting up like that, a bear run in that that kind of time." So, I put my scope back under my shirt like this and sat down a moment. I thought, what am I doing sitting here now? You know, I I want to I just want to say just just my study of brother Brandon in in his message. There were certain things that he shared in his ministry that um knowing him, he probably feel more comfortable sharing it in Jeffersonville than sharing it outside because people might not believe what he's actually saying. They probably really think this man is really off his rocker. So there's only places that he felt very comfortable going back to Jeffersonville and sharing certain things. But when he would come here to Streetport, it seemed like he had a different type of relationship. &gt;&gt; So he's sharing this how I mean most people sitting there in the service and would hear this man share something like they're like where where did he get that from? Because they never heard testimonies like this from nobody else. &gt;&gt; But look at this. Look at what he says. He says, "By time I get to the bottom of the hill, that storm getting more ter terrific all the time, closing in, you can see very far ahead of you." He says, "You don't have to believe this, but this is true." &gt;&gt; Now, he's saying that in Shreport, you don't have to believe this, but this is true. He say a voice spoke to me. &gt;&gt; Now, look at what the voice said. I am the Lord God. &gt;&gt; Same thing he told Abram in in Genesis. I am in a Colorado storm, God comes and says, I am the Lord God. I've created the heavens and the earth. Nature &gt;&gt; obeys me. &gt;&gt; And then I sit there a little bit, jerked off my hat and the voice uh somewhere I couldn't uh voice somewhere I couldn't see it. Only thing I could hear it was around them trees somewhere. I thought usually you see that that light that all of you know about usually it's there but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see the light. I said where are you oh God my creator I looked around I couldn't hear it no more hear his voice I waited a few minutes he said I am &gt;&gt; the Lord God that had you speak to those squirrels into existence what So, it wasn't brother Brandham doing it. It was the I am inside of the prophet. &gt;&gt; I am the one that told you to speak the squirrels into existence. &gt;&gt; We got to find the great I am. Brother Brandham's not here no more. &gt;&gt; So, the I am couldn't have died when the prophet died. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If he was living in Genesis, he's still living today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But, but we need to understand if we can trace him, Amen. And through the scripture, we can see even in the prophet's ministry, he identifies himself as the I am. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that told you to do that. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that gave you the inspiration to speak that. &gt;&gt; And I'm the one that fulfilled it when you spoke it. &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; the Lord God that had you speak those squirrels into existence. And all he says, "And all of you know about that. And so help me with this Bible before me on this Thanksgiving morning." If that isn't true, God strike God may strike me dead at that platform. Now see, it's true. He just he is just still as much creator a God. &gt;&gt; A God that could provide a ram for Abraham &gt;&gt; can provide. He's still Jehovah Gyra. The Lord can provide. And we know even when brother Brandon was was telling the story in Sister Hadley Wright's house &gt;&gt; was talking about those squirrels being created and everything and and she said, "My God, that's nothing but the truth." &gt;&gt; He says, "The same God that provided a ram for Abraham is the same God that provided squirrels for me." &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that God still lives today. And he says, "I am the God that actually inspired you to do that." &gt;&gt; That God is still inspiring today. I'm telling you, I'm I'm here to tell you, he did not die &gt;&gt; when the prophet died. &gt;&gt; Remember this. I started out by reading a quote out of Hebrews chapter 5 and 6. I'm going to repeat it again because we're going to find where the great I am is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, Brother Timothy came to me. He says, "Uh, brother Jack, did they get your title?" I said, uh, I said, "Brother, I'mma preach on the great I am." He says, "Oh, you're going to preach about yourself." I say, "Only a preacher could say that." And And I could I couldn't say anymore. I say, "Only a preacher can say that." But but I'm going to set you up for another quote that I'mma read &gt;&gt; because I I have a revelation of where the great I am is. Uh &gt;&gt; oh. Y'all want to know where he is? &gt;&gt; The first quote I read out of out of out of Hebrews chapter 5 says, "So in the old laws, a man could be a redeemer." First, he had to be kin folks. &gt;&gt; The great book of Ruth, we we went through here some time ago and how that God being spirit was made kin folks with us by becoming one of us &gt;&gt; in order to redeem us and give us eternal life. And this is what he says. He had to become us. &gt;&gt; That we through grace &gt;&gt; might become as [clears throat] he &gt;&gt; in the church age book there's a statement that is being made in the message in the the section the revelation of Jesus Christ. Brother Random says this, that's why no man can ever come along and say the holy man is a pope &gt;&gt; or the holy man is a bishop or a priest. The holy man is Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in us. &gt;&gt; He says, "How dare the hierarchy declare the ley has no word to say. &gt;&gt; Each one has something to say. Each has a work. Each has a ministry. The Holy Ghost came at Pentecost and separated himself on each. &gt;&gt; He says that it might be fulfilled whereof Christ said at that day, &gt;&gt; ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and I [screaming] in you. &gt;&gt; I think we found where the great I am is the great I am is laying inside of you Holy Ghost fil believers. [applause] Brother, we not talking about I was a [screaming] I will be. But the great I am is here. [applause] &gt;&gt; If you didn't believe it, I'll read the rest of the quote. Brother Brandham says this, "The great I am, &gt;&gt; the almighty God has come &gt;&gt; as spirit &gt;&gt; to fill his true church." &gt;&gt; Brother, they weren't saying that in my Baptist church. They was not telling me things like that in my Baptist church. The great I am. I Yes, I know about what he said in in the Old Testament, but where is he today? &gt;&gt; That great I am is living in me, &gt;&gt; living in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to go far to find him. &gt;&gt; You know, even brother Random made a statement. He says, you know, uh you're not praying to God some &gt;&gt; up in the universe somewhere. &gt;&gt; The God that lives in you, you're praying to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. That's why he has communion and fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; It's a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. This is not something far-fetched. This is personal, up close and personal. &gt;&gt; The great I am, the almighty God has come as spirit to fill his true church. &gt;&gt; He has a right to move anywhere he wants to. &gt;&gt; And upon anybody he wants to. We don't make any holy men amongst us. But the whole true congregation of the Lord is holy because of the presence of the Holy Spirit. It is he, the Holy Spirit that is holy, not the congregation &gt;&gt; of itself. &gt;&gt; I think it's just time for us to recognize &gt;&gt; who we are. You know, Jesus had a conversation one time with a centurion soldier. He the centurion had sent uh some of the men of Israel to go say, "Please, I don't think I should go and ask Jesus. I don't think he going to come to me, but I got a servant here that that needs healing, and I I I don't know what to do. Would y'all go and ask Jesus if you would come and pray for him?" So, they did. They went. They got Jesus. And Jesus on the way to the house and the man, the centurion said, "Oh my, I didn't think he would come." But since he is, he says, "Let me meet him before he gets into the house." He stopped out there and he says, "Now, um, Jesus, I'm not worthy &gt;&gt; that you you should come underneath my roof." He says, he says this, see, this is why I said you got to recognize who you are because this man knew who he was. &gt;&gt; This man said, uh, I am &gt;&gt; a man &gt;&gt; of authority. It says, "And I can tell a soldier, come and he comes." &gt;&gt; And I can tell another one, "Go." And he goes and you know when I speak and I say, "Come," the soldier don't say, "Give me a minute. I I'll be there in a few seconds. Just I got something to do. I'll be there. When I when I get ready, I'll be." That soldier don't talk that way to me. I tell one to go here. Uh I ain't I ain't ready. I got to go home first and talk to my wife and get my kids to bed. No, I said go. It could be midnight and if I say go, the man goes. &gt;&gt; He realized that he was a man of authority. He says, "And if you would speak the word, you don't even have to go underneath my roof, but if you would speak the word, I know my servant will be made whole." Jesus said, "I have not found faith like this anywhere in Israel." &gt;&gt; Oh my. It was because the man recognized who he was. &gt;&gt; And what we got to do is come to a re re realization of who we are in Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't have to allow the devil just to run rough shot. &gt;&gt; Sometimes sometimes you see that devil just going a little bit too far. I heard a brother uh preaching a few weeks ago. He said somehow his car just started acting up. He couldn't understand what was going on and he couldn't get the car to the shop and I mean just all kind of things going on. So he said, "Wait a minute." &gt;&gt; He says, "No, this is the devil. This is too far, car. You're going to have to start working in the name of Jesus." &gt;&gt; You know what happened? The car start working in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Look, that may seem simple, but sometime God wants us to use simple faith &gt;&gt; to see him move in our simple needs. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to recognize who we are. Can I give you a few scriptures &gt;&gt; just to cement who you are? Psalm 71 and 7 David said this and I believe he speaks about all of us. I am as a wanderer unto many and especially if you in a if you one of the ones you might be the only one in your your family that believes the message, you are a wanderer to them. I am a wonder unto many. When you go to work, you're the only one believer. When you're in school, you're the only believer. I am a wonder unto many. &gt;&gt; But thou art my strong refuge. &gt;&gt; Psalms 139 and 14. This is for my young people. Hallelujah. You need to anytime you're going through and you're having low self-esteem, read this scripture. Psalms 139:14. I will praise thee &gt;&gt; for I am &gt;&gt; fearfully &gt;&gt; and wonderfully made. I I like to say it like this. God don't make junk. &gt;&gt; And I ain't no junk. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I was handcrafted by God. Fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Marvelous are thy works. When you look in the mirror, young sister, marvelous are his works, with no makeup. Marvelous are his works, [applause] &gt;&gt; and that my soul knoweth right well. Romans 1:16. Here's another one. You got to know who you are. For I am not ashamed &gt;&gt; of the gospel of Christ. For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Philippians 4:11. Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned and whatsoever state I am there with to be content. Because you know when whatever state I'm in, whatever I am, I know he's there with me. so I can be content. &gt;&gt; There's a um uh a few statements that that are in the um in the church age book that I want to just read to you really quick and then one last scripture I want to read. One of the statements out of church age book as well as out of scripture. 2 Corinthians 5:20 says that I am the very righteousness of God. Another statement in church age's book says I I am loosed by the blood of Jesus and no one can lay any charge against me. &gt;&gt; Here's another one in the church's book. I am an heir &gt;&gt; to all God's power and his omnipotence. &gt;&gt; So therefore I need not to fear. Another statement he says, "I may not have the material sources resources to fall back on, but I am rich &gt;&gt; in spite of it all. My security lies in Christ who is my shield and my exceeding great reward." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I will walk with him and white because I am worthy." &gt;&gt; The devil tells you that you're not worthy, but you can tell the devil. Jesus said, "I'm going to walk with him right and white because I am worthy. &gt;&gt; Here's another one. I am the very elect of God &gt;&gt; and I cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Here's one other out of the church age book is I am a king &gt;&gt; and a priest &gt;&gt; and I have dominion over sin, &gt;&gt; the world, &gt;&gt; over my flesh, &gt;&gt; and I got dominion over the devil. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am a king and priest. &gt;&gt; One other that we find here in scripture, Paul tells us who we are. Romans 8 verse 28. One of the most uh read scriptures in Christendom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we know &gt;&gt; that all things &gt;&gt; work together &gt;&gt; for good to them that love God, &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; For whom he did forno, &gt;&gt; he also did predestinate &gt;&gt; to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many. Brethren, I'll invite the musicians to come. I'm winding down right here. It goes on to say this. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, then he also called. And whom he called, then he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. &gt;&gt; What shall we say then to these things? If God be for us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? He that spare not his own son but delivered him up for us all. How shall he not with him also freely give us all things? &gt;&gt; He says who shall lay any anything to the charge of God's like it is God that justifieth. &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died. Yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us. &gt;&gt; Verse 35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? &gt;&gt; Shall tribulation &gt;&gt; or distress &gt;&gt; or persecution &gt;&gt; or famine or nakedness or peril or sword or websites. &gt;&gt; As it is written, for thy sake we're killed all the day long. And we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. I like Paul's response. He says, "Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay." That means no, no. &gt;&gt; In all these things, &gt;&gt; we are &gt;&gt; more than conquerors &gt;&gt; through him that loved us. &gt;&gt; I told you, you need to know who you are because Paul recognized it and he wrote it in scripture. For I am &gt;&gt; this is me. I am &gt;&gt; because the great I am is living in me. I am persuaded &gt;&gt; that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, &gt;&gt; nor powers, nor things present, &gt;&gt; nor things to come. That mean nothing. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; Brother, this is when you're anchored in God. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God. &gt;&gt; Which is in Christ Jesus [music] our Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus made you a promise. Matthew 18:20, [music] he told you, he says, "I am with you always, &gt;&gt; even unto the end of the world." &gt;&gt; Not only is he with us, &gt;&gt; but because of the presence of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; he's also in us. &gt;&gt; So, no, no, no. We're not looking for a God of I will be. &gt;&gt; That's right. or a God of I was. &gt;&gt; But we serve a God of I am. &gt;&gt; He's a present tense God. &gt;&gt; And he's currently involved in all of your circumstances. &gt;&gt; Church, we don't have to be afraid. &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear. &gt;&gt; We know where he is. &gt;&gt; He's in us. &gt;&gt; He's in us. &gt;&gt; Not me. Only you. every born again believer, he's in you. &gt;&gt; Let's have a word of prayer. Father, we are grateful for understanding and revelation. It's the thing that makes the difference. when we can have a revelation, Father, there is nothing that the enemy can do that would shake us, that would harm us, that would hinder us, oh God. Lord, I I I I just appreciate, [music] Lord, how your prophet just kind of allows us to be able to walk through scripture and [music] and to see, Lord, that this this great God that Moses had a conversation with, this great God that led [music] the children of Israel, this great God that spoke to Paul on the road to Damascus, this great God that took a picture with his prophet, this great God has chosen to dwell in the hearts of believers. Help us to [music] realize Lord who we are in you. Lord as we will leave this place and God just going on and just thinking about what has been spoken to us. Trials will come, tribulations will come, distresses will come. But God, we know that we can't be defeated in the midst of all that [music] because the great I am is on the inside. I pray your blessings Lord upon the pastor, this family, the ministry, Lord, all the believers that assemble here in this in mind mend. Father, we just pray God that you just continue [music] to use them as a lighthouse in this part of the world. And Lord, we know this ministry not only touches just this neighborhood, but Father, it touches all over the world. God, we ask that you continue to use them and lead them and guide them. Thank you for what they do, Lord, for you. Thank you, Father, for all that you've done for them. And we know there's so much more that you have in store. Father, we carefully give you all the honor, all the glory, and all the praise. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Can we give the Lord Jesus a hand of praise? [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Um, they asked me just to sing [music] a a song or two and I'll do that. But before I do that, uh, I will say that [music] if there's anyone that desires prayer, uh, we'll gladly pray with you. Amen. And for you. Um, but we we just love the Lord. Amen. And and and and one of the biggest things that I feel like I can do as a minister [music] is to get the people to recognize who they are in Christ. That that's like the most important thing. Often times we live so far beneath our privileges because we don't know who we are. You all remember the story of the the the the young the lady she had a brother Brandham told about this lady that um she thought she was poor &gt;&gt; and uh her son was overseas and the [music] son was sending her these pretty pictures &gt;&gt; and uh and as she was looking at the pictures and you know and and got sick and and everything and somebody come by the house and say you know we [music] do you have any anybody that can take care of you anybody can say yeah I got a son but I ain't want bother me overseas and all he does send me these pretty pictures. That's all he does. And and I I just didn't want to bother him. Man said, "Well, let me look at the pictures that he sent you." I said, "Okay, I'll let I'll show them." And went and didn't realize the pictures was hidden in the Bible. Pulled the pictures out the Bible. And the man looked at him and said, "This not pictures. These are money orders. Lady, you are wealthy." And didn't even realize it. &gt;&gt; We just need to recognize Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who we are. &gt;&gt; Let's do our God. Amen. Hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. Come [music] on, let's worship him just a little bit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; What are you turned [singing] into wine? I open the eyes [music and singing] of the blind.
