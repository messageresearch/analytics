Description:
Lyrics 

I was a wretch
I remember who I was
I was lost
I was blind
I was running out of time
Sin separated
The breach was far too wide
But from the far side of the chasm
You held me in your sight

So You made a way
Across the great divide
Left behind
Heavens throne
To build it here inside
And there at the cross
You paid the debt I owed
Broke my chains
Freed my soul
For the first I had hope

Thank you Jesus for the blood applied
Thank you Jesus it have washed me white
Thank you Jesus You have saved my life
Brought me from the darkness into glorious light

You took my place
Laid inside my tomb of sin
You were buried for three days
And then You walked right out again
And now death has no sting
And life has no end
For I have been transformed
By the blood of the lamb
Thank You Jesus for the blood applied (thank You Jesus)
Thank You Jesus it have washed me white
Thank You Jesus You have saved my life
Brought me from the darkness into glorious light
There is nothing stronger
Then the wonder working power of the blood
The blood
That calls us sons and daughters
We are ransomed by our father
Through the blood
The blood

There is nothing stronger
Then the wonder working power of the blood
The blood
That calls us sons and daughters
We are ransomed by the father
Through the blood
The blood

Thank You Jesus for the blood applied
Thank You Jesus it have washed me white
Thank You Jesus You have saved my life
Brought me from the darkness into glorious light

Glory to His name
Glory to His name
There to my heart was the blood applied
Glory to His name
