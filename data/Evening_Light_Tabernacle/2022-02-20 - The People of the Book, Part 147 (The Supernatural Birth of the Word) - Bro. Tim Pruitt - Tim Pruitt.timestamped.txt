[45:16] name
[45:17] amen
[45:18] and amen
[45:19] god bless you
[45:21] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[45:23] today and we want to welcome you today
[45:25] and thank the lord for his goodness to
[45:28] us and his grace
[45:29] in our lives
[45:31] man we we miss our young people and
[45:34] probably 75 75 or 80 people that we got
[45:38] over in
[45:39] in dallas texas today that are out
[45:42] um the young young people in their
[45:45] chaperones and those that attended there
[45:48] and we just pray that god will bless
[45:50] them in a mighty way today
[45:53] amen and i pray that the lord will
[45:55] anoint you
[45:57] to make up for them
[45:59] amen we need your amens and your
[46:02] rejoicing in truth
[46:04] i believe we got truth to rejoice in
[46:08] you know i i found a couple of little
[46:10] nuggets here as i was
[46:13] studying this week and
[46:15] little quotations from the message queen
[46:18] of sheba
[46:19] and the other one is um from a from a
[46:22] sermon
[46:23] uh very similar to that one uh as far as
[46:26] year in time as the eagle stirs her nest
[46:30] this actually was in beaumont texas this
[46:33] one
[46:34] and they and i i wound up um you know
[46:36] just placing them kind of in over into
[46:39] my notes and just at the top of my page
[46:43] to find a place maybe to use them
[46:47] as i i would i would go through
[46:50] different things and look
[46:52] and i wound up leaving them right at the
[46:54] top of my notes
[46:56] and i didn't realize that till i was
[46:58] just about to walk out that i hadn't
[47:01] done it so i'm going to start with them
[47:04] amen and so it says from the queen of
[47:06] sheba here
[47:08] oh what if the christian church today
[47:11] could believe the gift that god sent
[47:13] them the holy ghost
[47:15] what if they would receive it what if
[47:17] all denominations would rally around the
[47:19] holy spirit as israel rallied around
[47:22] solomon with that gift
[47:24] the holy spirit is a gift to the church
[47:26] and the church turns it away and sets it
[47:29] off with our doctrines and our
[47:30] theologies and things that are manmade
[47:33] creeds
[47:34] and we shut christ right out and we
[47:37] don't let the holy spirit come in
[47:40] no miracles no shouting no speak with
[47:42] tongues no praises of god
[47:45] well if the holy spirit done that in the
[47:47] book of acts it'll do the same today
[47:50] because it's the book of acts
[47:52] and the the book of acts is not the acts
[47:55] of the apostles it's the acts of the
[47:56] holy spirit in the apostles
[47:59] it's the same holy spirit in the church
[48:01] today it would act the same way
[48:04] it would give the same results and why
[48:06] accept a substitute when the skies are
[48:09] full of real pentecostal power
[48:12] we don't have to have a substitute we
[48:15] can have the real
[48:17] amen and then as in the eagles turret
[48:19] they're nasty he speaks about an eagle
[48:22] in the cage that he was born to be a son
[48:25] of god
[48:26] creeds put him in a cage
[48:29] god wants him out
[48:31] oh he was born that was a work of man
[48:33] that put the eagle there but it's so and
[48:35] it's a work of man that puts you in them
[48:37] creeds and denominations they're all of
[48:38] the devil they're sir creed of man down
[48:41] days of miracles is passed no such thing
[48:44] as joy the holy ghost
[48:46] no such thing as shouting no such thing
[48:48] as speaking in tongues no divine healing
[48:50] oh my it's pitiful sons of god born to
[48:53] be free
[48:55] then caged down
[48:58] i'll tell you what we need to walk in
[49:00] freedom today
[49:02] let's go to the book of john chapter one
[49:05] we'll read from verse one
[49:08] here we have matthew mark luke and john
[49:11] parallels the four
[49:13] the four gospels parallels the four
[49:15] living creatures of the lion the man the
[49:18] ox and the eagles we're going to hear
[49:19] from the eagle here
[49:21] the eagle is a prophetic anointing and
[49:24] here
[49:25] as you know as he goes back to in the
[49:27] genealogies of jesus he doesn't start
[49:29] with
[49:30] mary and joseph and
[49:33] tracing back through david whatever but
[49:35] he says
[49:36] this when he goes to the genealogy of
[49:38] jesus
[49:39] and this is your genealogy
[49:42] your genealogy doesn't go through mary
[49:44] and joseph and
[49:46] david and abraham and that in a natural
[49:49] way
[49:50] your genealogy starts right here
[49:52] in the beginning was the word
[49:56] and the word was with god and the word
[49:58] was god
[49:59] and the same was in the beginning with
[50:01] god and all things were made by him and
[50:03] without him was not anything made that
[50:06] was made
[50:07] in him was life and the life was the
[50:09] light of men
[50:10] and the light shineth in the darkness
[50:12] and the darkness comprehendeth it not
[50:15] there was a man sent from john from god
[50:18] whose name was john
[50:20] and the same came for witness to bear
[50:22] witness of the light that all men
[50:25] through him
[50:26] might believe
[50:28] he was not that light but he was sent to
[50:30] bear witness of that light
[50:33] that was the true light which lighteth
[50:35] every man that cometh into the world he
[50:37] was in the world the world was made by
[50:39] him the world knew him not
[50:41] he came to his own and his own received
[50:43] him not
[50:44] but as many as received him
[50:48] to them gave ye the power to become the
[50:50] sons of god
[50:51] even to them that believe on his name
[50:54] which were born not of blood nor the
[50:57] wheel of the flesh nor the will of man
[51:00] but of god
[51:01] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[51:03] among us and we beheld his glory the
[51:06] glory is the only begotten of the father
[51:09] full
[51:10] of grace
[51:11] and truth
[51:13] amen god bless you can be seated
[51:16] we're going to be speaking today on the
[51:18] supernatural
[51:20] birth of the word
[51:22] we're going to be looking at a
[51:24] supernatural birth
[51:26] now starting here at the beginning of
[51:30] jesus
[51:31] we find that um of course
[51:34] as it speaks of his genealogy it goes
[51:37] beyond the natural man
[51:40] and the natural flesh
[51:42] and he goes back and traces where that
[51:45] he came from
[51:46] and so
[51:48] it says in the beginning
[51:50] god
[51:51] and and as it speaks of this
[51:54] it gives us the earliest glimpse
[51:57] that we can get of god
[52:00] and that's in the beginning where the
[52:02] invisible god the spirit
[52:05] began to move out toward the tangible
[52:08] and the invisible then was
[52:12] from there
[52:13] from the invisible there was birth the
[52:15] word
[52:16] and of course in that form we speak of
[52:19] him being the son of god
[52:21] and that he came out of the invisible
[52:24] but different from man who gives birth
[52:27] to another into a separate individual
[52:30] the indivisible or the invisible and the
[52:34] word was god
[52:36] now the the invisible god dwelt in the
[52:39] word and from the word
[52:41] every living thing that was made and
[52:44] every non-living thing like the earth
[52:46] and soil and trees of course is a living
[52:50] thing but but you know every tangible
[52:52] thing
[52:53] would be brought back by the word of god
[52:57] and each particle was an expression
[53:00] of a part of god through the spoken word
[53:03] saying let there be
[53:05] and so through the release of the word
[53:09] there as the word came out of god
[53:12] and here where it would begin to create
[53:15] and would bring forth the light and out
[53:17] of the light it would bring forth a
[53:20] substance and out of that substance the
[53:23] earth would come and the the sun the
[53:26] moon the stars and everything else and
[53:28] then
[53:29] then of course he would bring
[53:31] keep on creating until he would bring
[53:34] forth the sun
[53:35] in his own image
[53:37] now
[53:38] um this this i know was truly a son
[53:42] a son in the manner that we humans think
[53:45] of a son because a son is
[53:48] separate from his father
[53:50] and and
[53:52] but this son
[53:53] was um separate from god in that he was
[53:57] not god
[53:58] he was of the god life and he was of the
[54:01] god's likeness but he was a little god
[54:04] upon the earth with power that laid
[54:07] within his tongue
[54:09] to through which he ruled the world
[54:12] he until after the curse he did not rule
[54:15] by the sweat of his brow
[54:17] by his cunning mind of trapping and
[54:20] snaring animals and and living by the
[54:23] sweater brow
[54:25] chilling the soil but by the power that
[54:28] laid within his tongue
[54:30] by the word of god he moved the trees he
[54:33] said
[54:34] he spoken to this tree and moved it how
[54:38] do we know that because when the sun the
[54:40] second son of adam or the second adam
[54:43] rather
[54:44] came well he did the same he spoke to
[54:47] the tree and and it quit having life he
[54:51] spoke um and and created and he he would
[54:55] pull from one and make another
[54:57] and and this this is what he did as a
[55:00] son of god
[55:01] now and we know this would happen with
[55:04] adam there is a little god upon the
[55:07] earth with a power within his tongue
[55:10] through which he ruled the world
[55:13] and then of course we remember and know
[55:16] how sin entered and man fell when he
[55:19] mixed the unbelief with the word and
[55:21] that of course brought forth a hybrid
[55:23] life
[55:24] and that we are no longer in that
[55:26] original image of god as with immortal
[55:29] life but we have mortal life
[55:32] and everyone that is born
[55:34] in this world we're born hybrids
[55:37] we're born of doubt and not of faith
[55:40] and we're we're we're sexual born and
[55:43] born into sin and born into death
[55:46] we are born to die
[55:48] that's our first birth
[55:50] and but i want you to know that true
[55:54] religion won't let you remain a hybrid
[55:58] amen that's why you must be born again
[56:01] but again you know we with our first
[56:04] born birth we were born of the flesh as
[56:07] the bible said is you know um
[56:10] that we were born of the of not we were
[56:13] born of blood and the will of the flesh
[56:16] and a man this is how we were first born
[56:18] but the second birth it is not a birth
[56:21] of the will of the flesh or blood or the
[56:23] will of the of man but it is a god
[56:27] for as many as received him he gave
[56:29] power to become the sons of god even to
[56:33] them that believe on his name
[56:37] so you see again we
[56:40] we
[56:41] can believe on his name because we are
[56:44] born of him
[56:46] any son of god is
[56:49] born into the supernatural
[56:51] he is born by the supernatural a lot of
[56:55] times you have men that criticize for
[56:58] example divine healing well how can you
[57:00] keep from believing in divine healing
[57:02] when it's the very nature of the holy
[57:05] spirit
[57:06] is a very part of his redemptive work
[57:09] and what he did at calvary so every man
[57:12] that is born of the spirit of god he
[57:15] will have to believe in the supernatural
[57:18] because he is a part of god
[57:20] he is an offspring of god
[57:22] just like when you're born you can find
[57:25] traits of your father you got to maybe
[57:27] you got a nose like your dad a mouth
[57:29] like your dad well you have a right to
[57:32] look like him
[57:33] because he's your father so if god is
[57:35] your father we have a we have a right
[57:38] then to favor him to be in his likeness
[57:42] amen to believe in the supernatural
[57:44] because we are born of the supernatural
[57:47] spirit
[57:48] and outwardly we might be a man of clay
[57:51] or person of dust but inwardly you're
[57:54] born of the spirit of god and having a
[57:57] supernatural being in there that
[57:59] supernatural being hungers and thirst
[58:03] first heavenly home younger
[58:05] amen so it it looks into things that the
[58:09] eye cannot see in the supernatural and
[58:12] believes in things that you cannot
[58:14] obtain
[58:16] by the physical flesh of man
[58:18] now we come an offspring of god within
[58:22] our soul then
[58:24] that our soul is got to be something
[58:27] like on the order of god
[58:29] it believes the supernatural it can
[58:31] believe anything
[58:33] it can believe for anything
[58:36] you see if a man's come in contact with
[58:38] god and you talk to him about divine
[58:42] healing for example you know sure he
[58:44] believes that you know do you believe in
[58:46] miracles sure
[58:47] because why he's a part of god
[58:50] and he believes that anything can happen
[58:53] with god
[58:54] right amen so when he's born of god he
[58:57] becomes a son of god and the
[59:00] supernatural power of god dwells within
[59:04] him
[59:05] and and so we know we have a
[59:06] supernatural god we have a supernatural
[59:09] life and a man that is born of god has a
[59:12] supernatural spirit
[59:14] and that that supernatural spirit
[59:16] believes in the supernatural
[59:19] amen and and we it has um it believes in
[59:23] a supernatural heaven
[59:25] it believes in a supernatural rapture
[59:28] where it believes we're going to be
[59:30] chains supernaturally
[59:32] from from in a more in a moment in a
[59:36] twinkling of an eye if a man is born in
[59:38] the spirit of god he can't help but
[59:40] believe that because he is a
[59:43] supernatural person and so you know
[59:46] that's the reason though we have so many
[59:49] of these cold
[59:51] formal indifferent god forsaken
[59:54] backslidden churches because we got too
[59:57] many that are not filled with the holy
[59:59] ghost and all they know is theology
[1:00:03] and that's the reason you can't get them
[1:00:05] to believe anything because they're just
[1:00:07] filled with theology and not filled with
[1:00:10] the holy ghost
[1:00:12] but let me tell you something that every
[1:00:14] man that is born of god he is a
[1:00:16] miniature creator
[1:00:19] he has the spirit of god in him which is
[1:00:22] a creator and so that makes him a
[1:00:24] miniature creator he can create an
[1:00:27] atmosphere for faith he can create an
[1:00:30] atmosphere for healing he can create an
[1:00:32] atmosphere for salvation that's what
[1:00:35] ought to happen when saints of god get
[1:00:37] together they ought to create an
[1:00:39] atmosphere where the supernatural takes
[1:00:42] place
[1:00:43] amen that because you know we are in the
[1:00:46] image of god god is a creator and that's
[1:00:49] the reason we can believe god can heal
[1:00:51] because god is in you and god made the
[1:00:54] world and he spoke it and it became
[1:00:56] material and so therefore we know that
[1:00:59] the very ground we are living on is
[1:01:01] god's word made manifest
[1:01:04] and and so again he brought it into
[1:01:07] existence by the word of god and we know
[1:01:11] we can take the word of god that speaks
[1:01:13] of our healing and bring healing into
[1:01:15] existence we know we can take the word
[1:01:18] of god that speaks of salvation and
[1:01:20] bring the holy ghost right to a person
[1:01:23] we know that we can speak the word of
[1:01:26] god and we know things are going to
[1:01:28] happen
[1:01:29] the earth is going to shake demons are
[1:01:32] going to tremble amen the power of god
[1:01:35] will work out of the word when a
[1:01:37] believing christian takes that word and
[1:01:39] places it in his lips
[1:01:41] and my mountains will move
[1:01:44] and then demons will flee
[1:01:47] the blind will see the death will hear
[1:01:49] the sick will will receive of their
[1:01:52] healing the lost will be found
[1:01:55] hallelujah amen and they'll not just be
[1:01:58] found they'll be delivered
[1:02:00] are you with me they'll be delivered
[1:02:03] that there's no
[1:02:05] nothing that the devil put upon their
[1:02:07] lives that can hold them back their sons
[1:02:10] and daughters are the most high god
[1:02:13] [Applause]
[1:02:14] man that is born in the spirit of god he
[1:02:16] is an offspring of god
[1:02:18] part of god is in him he believes every
[1:02:21] word that god said will materialize
[1:02:24] amen so that makes him a part of god
[1:02:27] it's the holy spirit in the man that
[1:02:29] makes him a part of god
[1:02:32] then god is your father the problem is
[1:02:35] we have too many that are born of the
[1:02:36] church
[1:02:38] rather than born of the word
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:42] now as brother branham told us in spoken
[1:02:45] words original seed
[1:02:47] he said all god's sons must be the same
[1:02:51] to be born of the word and the spirit
[1:02:53] brings us back to the spoken word again
[1:02:57] like in john 3
[1:02:58] to be born of the water and the spirit
[1:03:00] what does it do it brings you back to
[1:03:02] the place you should have been at the
[1:03:05] beginning
[1:03:06] now we know that at the at the beginning
[1:03:08] when adam fell and man was been birthed
[1:03:11] sexually instead of coming as adam came
[1:03:14] by the spoken word of god
[1:03:16] and this is how a son of god was to to
[1:03:19] bring life in was by the spoken word of
[1:03:22] god but when man fell
[1:03:24] man fell and became mortal
[1:03:27] living in a mortal life and so we were
[1:03:30] born wrong
[1:03:32] every one of us were born wrong this is
[1:03:34] why jesus said you must be born again
[1:03:39] every person must be born again to go
[1:03:43] into eternal life
[1:03:45] amen it's a birth that bursts you into
[1:03:48] that life
[1:03:49] a birth burst you into human life a
[1:03:52] birth versus a dog in the dog life a
[1:03:54] birth of birth a cow into the cattle
[1:03:58] life amen a birth of son of god will
[1:04:01] produce another son of god
[1:04:05] when god gives birth he's going to give
[1:04:07] birth to his own
[1:04:09] and it'll be a son of god like he is god
[1:04:14] now
[1:04:15] so again we have a lot of problems here
[1:04:18] today we got a we got a nest full of
[1:04:20] rotten eggs
[1:04:22] we got a lot that have never been
[1:04:24] germatized and man we have too many that
[1:04:27] have just been sitting in the nest for a
[1:04:29] long long time
[1:04:31] and they they don't have life in them
[1:04:35] somebody with me right now
[1:04:37] amen this is the problem that we have
[1:04:39] today is the church is is not been with
[1:04:42] the mate christ jesus
[1:04:45] you take an old hand that hadn't been
[1:04:46] with the male
[1:04:48] it's not that i don't care how much she
[1:04:49] mothers over the eggs
[1:04:51] how much she warms them and incubates
[1:04:53] them
[1:04:54] and it's not going to hatch she'll when
[1:04:57] it's over with after all her efforts he
[1:05:00] has a bunch of rotten eggs
[1:05:02] this is what the bible said in the book
[1:05:04] of revelation that there's a cage of
[1:05:06] ever unclean and hateful bird
[1:05:12] and that's what the church becomes
[1:05:14] backslidden people
[1:05:16] people that are calling themselves saved
[1:05:18] and still living dirty lives
[1:05:21] with alcohol and tobacco and drugs and
[1:05:24] sex sins and pornography and everything
[1:05:26] else is because that the church has left
[1:05:30] off being with the mate christ jesus and
[1:05:32] the eggs are not germatized so you bring
[1:05:35] forth baptists or methodists or
[1:05:37] presbyterian or pentecostal but you
[1:05:39] don't bring with christ
[1:05:45] if you hadn't been with the mate christ
[1:05:46] jesus been born into supernatural you
[1:05:48] can't believe the supernatural
[1:05:51] and when a man's born in the spirit of
[1:05:53] god god's a creator he's a part of god
[1:05:56] and so therefore he's going to be like
[1:05:59] god
[1:06:00] he's an offspring of god in his soul and
[1:06:02] he bleeds for the supernatural
[1:06:05] and you can you can know that it's it's
[1:06:08] the truth now i want just
[1:06:11] i just want to take a few moments now as
[1:06:13] we look here
[1:06:15] because we're we're living in a time
[1:06:18] where we're at the end age
[1:06:22] we're at the last age of laodicea
[1:06:26] and it is a time where christ is put
[1:06:29] outside the church
[1:06:32] now it's not that they're not
[1:06:34] that they don't make a profession
[1:06:37] because they're still professing to be
[1:06:39] the church
[1:06:40] but christ is not on the inside he's on
[1:06:43] the outside knocking
[1:06:45] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:06:47] he's actually been put out amen
[1:06:52] because he was once in the church
[1:06:54] but laodicea shows he's outside the
[1:06:57] church
[1:06:58] and he said i'm standing there knocking
[1:07:01] i'm asking to get in
[1:07:05] now what a day what point what a problem
[1:07:08] we're having today
[1:07:09] look where we're at in time
[1:07:11] look at the problems of the age and the
[1:07:13] troubles that we're having in this time
[1:07:16] we're in a very serious hour
[1:07:19] amen this is a time of great darkness
[1:07:21] upon the face of the earth
[1:07:24] and confusion everywhere
[1:07:26] but now let me just go for a moment i
[1:07:29] want to take a few times and and i'm
[1:07:31] going to have to wing a lot of this
[1:07:32] today
[1:07:34] and i'll maybe tell you why a little bit
[1:07:36] later but um but i'm just going to kind
[1:07:38] of wing some of this as we go along
[1:07:41] let me just preach
[1:07:42] let me just preach from my heart for a
[1:07:44] moment
[1:07:46] let me just tell you you know exactly
[1:07:48] what we are in time and what is
[1:07:51] happening
[1:07:52] you see every revival that there's been
[1:07:55] has produced twins
[1:07:57] the twins would start in heaven
[1:08:00] there would be two archangels
[1:08:02] michael and lucifer
[1:08:05] amen and and you know lucifer would of
[1:08:08] course begin to um
[1:08:11] he was he's actually a the bible calls
[1:08:13] him in ezekiel 38 a a covered cherubim
[1:08:17] he was to be one of the angels that
[1:08:20] protected the word
[1:08:24] likes depicted on the on the um um the
[1:08:29] the holiest of holies there upon upon
[1:08:31] the what is that called
[1:08:33] the ark of the covenant and there with
[1:08:36] their with that ark of the covenant are
[1:08:38] two angels two cherubims
[1:08:41] and their wings would overshadow the
[1:08:43] word
[1:08:45] and he was to be one of the
[1:08:47] overshadowing cherubims
[1:08:49] a protector of the word of god but the
[1:08:52] bible said he began to look upon himself
[1:08:56] and he began to
[1:08:58] he began to think of what a great person
[1:09:02] what a great person that he was he began
[1:09:05] to lift up his self and he began to have
[1:09:09] a thought different from god's word
[1:09:12] and he began to hybridize the truth
[1:09:15] so he said i will exalt myself this is
[1:09:19] isaiah chapter 12. i will exalt myself
[1:09:22] above god and all that is called god i'm
[1:09:25] going to put my dominion over god and
[1:09:28] everything else it'll all be under me
[1:09:32] and there as he began there he began to
[1:09:36] preach
[1:09:37] and he deceived angels
[1:09:41] now he's a great preacher
[1:09:43] the devil's a great preacher
[1:09:45] and he deceived angels with his
[1:09:47] preaching
[1:09:50] are you with me
[1:09:52] and they were cast out of heaven
[1:09:54] down to the earth
[1:09:56] this is where we get demons and powers
[1:09:58] of darkness and rulers of darkness and
[1:10:01] high places
[1:10:03] this is where that we get that where we
[1:10:05] get demon oppression and everything
[1:10:07] they're fallen angels
[1:10:12] once once messengers of god but fell
[1:10:16] from their estate
[1:10:19] now then i want you to notice it comes
[1:10:21] down to the earth
[1:10:23] he comes down to the earth and what's he
[1:10:25] find he finds there's adam and one right
[1:10:28] next to adam
[1:10:31] now the one right next to adam is the
[1:10:32] serpent he is the he is the most subtle
[1:10:35] beast he's not a serpent
[1:10:37] he's not a snake on the ground yet that
[1:10:39] don't happen until after the curse
[1:10:42] he's not a snake in the tree
[1:10:44] he is a beast of the field
[1:10:47] and he is very cunning
[1:10:49] and he's he can talk he has intelligence
[1:10:54] come on this listen we're not some greek
[1:10:57] mythologists that believe in a magic
[1:11:00] apple and a talking snake
[1:11:03] no sir god created and he brought up and
[1:11:06] here the serpent was right next to man
[1:11:09] he could reason he could talk and there
[1:11:12] satan entered into him to deceive by
[1:11:16] so now you've got twins on the earth
[1:11:18] you've got adam and serpent everyone
[1:11:21] both of them are saying yeah hath god
[1:11:23] said
[1:11:24] both of them are saying god told me this
[1:11:27] and the other said god told me that
[1:11:30] and he believes the lie of the devil
[1:11:34] amen and the fall takes place
[1:11:38] the same thing as the fall happened in
[1:11:40] heaven now the fall happens on earth
[1:11:42] and now we're dealing with fallen man
[1:11:48] but it don't stop there
[1:11:50] you have two twins with cain and abel
[1:11:54] the bible said that that that she
[1:11:57] conceived and brought forth cain and
[1:11:59] then brought again his brother abel
[1:12:02] and then what happens next
[1:12:04] there is a contention between the seeds
[1:12:09] where where does the vault take place at
[1:12:11] the worship
[1:12:13] they come to the altar to worship
[1:12:15] and god shows what he receives
[1:12:18] and the kind of worship that he accepts
[1:12:20] which is blood
[1:12:23] and the given of life
[1:12:25] amen portraying christ and what will
[1:12:28] come there
[1:12:29] and he shows what he will bless as the
[1:12:31] as he recognizes abel's sacrifice
[1:12:36] and refuses canes
[1:12:38] and cain knows what god wants and he
[1:12:41] knows what god accepted he can see god's
[1:12:44] vindication but he refuses it
[1:12:49] so he sees a supernatural move and god's
[1:12:52] acceptance but he refuses the
[1:12:55] supernatural for his own works
[1:12:59] now
[1:13:00] of course what happens is there's a
[1:13:02] persecution takes place
[1:13:05] now as we're as we come down to this for
[1:13:08] a moment with this persecution that
[1:13:10] takes place
[1:13:11] here we come where cain kills abel
[1:13:15] but now it moves on from there because
[1:13:17] every revival produces twins
[1:13:21] so the next place and this is where
[1:13:22] we're going to deal a lot with today
[1:13:25] is ishmael and isaac
[1:13:28] now they're not twins in the sense that
[1:13:30] they're born at the same time but
[1:13:32] they're two seeds
[1:13:34] of abraham
[1:13:37] now god will use abraham and his seed to
[1:13:40] project everything he's going to do
[1:13:42] redemption
[1:13:45] so we call abraham the father of our
[1:13:47] faith
[1:13:49] and we can look back and we can see the
[1:13:52] journeys of abraham and the stations of
[1:13:55] his life where god brought him to
[1:13:58] and we find that he was a man in the ur
[1:14:00] of the chaldeans he was a gentile and a
[1:14:04] heathen worshiper like everybody else
[1:14:07] but he got a divine call
[1:14:10] and god by predestination called him
[1:14:15] out of the heathen and said come walk
[1:14:17] with me
[1:14:18] and i'm going to give you a land
[1:14:22] i'm going to give you a promise and i'm
[1:14:23] going to make of you a great nation
[1:14:29] now
[1:14:30] as we look at this for a moment
[1:14:32] we can see
[1:14:33] as he does he comes to this divine call
[1:14:37] and that is justification you see that's
[1:14:40] where the church has been in the great
[1:14:42] restoration process
[1:14:44] it started with luther
[1:14:46] the just shall live by faith
[1:14:49] believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:14:51] and they started out their believing
[1:14:54] walking with god coming back heading
[1:14:57] back to the promised land which is the
[1:14:59] holy ghost
[1:15:02] and as they're as they're heading back
[1:15:04] we're heading to this promised land and
[1:15:06] and whatever god is praying bringing him
[1:15:08] through different stages of the journey
[1:15:11] and then he will bring him up to the
[1:15:13] blood age from there the blood age he
[1:15:15] will bring him to the altar you see he
[1:15:17] didn't know how to worship
[1:15:19] until god taught him out of worship
[1:15:22] and he would tell him go make me an
[1:15:24] altar
[1:15:25] come give me you know offer this
[1:15:26] sacrifice i'll meet you here and god
[1:15:29] would meet him there and there he would
[1:15:32] he would build an altar worship god
[1:15:35] offer the blood
[1:15:37] this again is the stage the church has
[1:15:39] come through we come through the
[1:15:40] wesleyan revival where the church in his
[1:15:43] in his process of restoration has come
[1:15:46] to that and and in this restoration
[1:15:49] process that learned it was the blood
[1:15:52] that sanctifies
[1:15:55] and so they will wash the robes and the
[1:15:57] blood of the lamb to make them white
[1:15:59] and by works of righteousness they do
[1:16:02] and
[1:16:03] wash them in the blood they become
[1:16:05] sanctified
[1:16:08] so they've moved a little closer now
[1:16:11] and and they're they're coming into the
[1:16:13] promise now we come to the pentecostal
[1:16:15] age
[1:16:16] and there in the pentecostal age we find
[1:16:19] that he makes the promise of el shaddai
[1:16:23] which
[1:16:24] we'll get to it in a little bit perhaps
[1:16:26] where he he says just come nurse from me
[1:16:30] and when i am your strength giver i'm
[1:16:32] your life giver i know said i i'm the
[1:16:34] almighty god i am your provider i'm your
[1:16:38] need supplier it's all in me
[1:16:41] now but the problem is that it was
[1:16:44] brought before the early pentecostals
[1:16:47] and and instead of doing it it was like
[1:16:50] what happened in the days of sarah and
[1:16:53] abraham
[1:16:54] sarah decided through reasoning that she
[1:16:58] could not bring forth the promise she
[1:17:02] was weak in faith and it produced an
[1:17:05] itch meal
[1:17:07] she said let my bones woman let my bones
[1:17:11] woman which is a type of denomination
[1:17:13] let that bring forth a child
[1:17:17] i can't do it i don't have the faith to
[1:17:20] do it i'm too old i've been waiting on
[1:17:22] this promise too long and she made all
[1:17:25] her excuses and her unbelief produced an
[1:17:27] ishmael
[1:17:30] yet it was a seed of abraham
[1:17:37] now
[1:17:38] so instead
[1:17:40] instead of nursing from el shaddai just
[1:17:43] before they come to el shaddai which is
[1:17:45] the god almighty in genesis chapter 17
[1:17:49] what did they do they grabbed the breast
[1:17:51] of a denomination rather
[1:17:53] rather than the
[1:17:55] than the real breast of el shaddai
[1:17:58] and so what happens
[1:18:00] it left it there bringing forth a wild
[1:18:02] man
[1:18:03] who wouldn't be subject to the word
[1:18:06] somebody with me now
[1:18:08] so let me explain
[1:18:10] as we just kind of go over it again and
[1:18:12] god has brought us like abraham
[1:18:15] called him out of babylon
[1:18:17] brought him from the earth the chaldeans
[1:18:19] took him across the euphrates now that
[1:18:22] was
[1:18:23] justification as the church moved
[1:18:26] toward greater revelation of god
[1:18:30] and and then god taught him out of
[1:18:32] worship by blood and wesley brought out
[1:18:34] about sanctification washing their by
[1:18:37] works their their garments making them
[1:18:39] white in the blood of the lamb and then
[1:18:41] we come to the pentecostal age and i
[1:18:43] want you to understand we are in the age
[1:18:46] of pentecost
[1:18:49] there's the era of many around the
[1:18:51] message today they don't know where
[1:18:53] we're at
[1:18:55] we are in the age of pentecost
[1:18:58] this is a day where the day of pentecost
[1:19:01] fully comes
[1:19:02] all the types that have spoken of it is
[1:19:05] now being manifested
[1:19:07] now so again this this is where the real
[1:19:10] twin though comes in the manifestation
[1:19:13] because here would come the supernatural
[1:19:16] as the word was coming to view for
[1:19:18] people to be born of
[1:19:20] and just before the supernatural takes
[1:19:23] place
[1:19:24] what happens they take instead
[1:19:28] a natural approach
[1:19:30] the working of abraham's strength
[1:19:33] and his own
[1:19:34] works and it produces a child that is an
[1:19:38] ishmael
[1:19:39] not the promised child and god never
[1:19:42] recognizes as the one he had spoke about
[1:19:47] he says in isaac shall thy seed be
[1:19:49] called and i you know
[1:19:51] this one came out of your own works
[1:19:54] the what i'm doing it comes without your
[1:19:57] works
[1:19:58] it comes by grace alone
[1:20:00] it comes by the power of god
[1:20:03] it comes by supernatural birth
[1:20:07] now
[1:20:08] here was god
[1:20:10] about
[1:20:11] to offer himself as el shaddai
[1:20:15] in this age of pentecost
[1:20:17] where god where the bride was to return
[1:20:20] to the bride she was at pentecost is
[1:20:22] where the church was to return to the
[1:20:25] bride she was at pentecost in other
[1:20:27] words the original grain that was
[1:20:29] planted would come to harvest again the
[1:20:32] seed there would be seed here
[1:20:34] so here god was going to offer himself
[1:20:37] his el shaddai the blessed god where the
[1:20:40] birth would come through the word
[1:20:43] and
[1:20:44] and he he said nurse from me
[1:20:47] the blessed god all the a new testament
[1:20:51] here the word would be revealed the full
[1:20:54] word
[1:20:55] would be uncovered made known
[1:20:58] come on church amen and from there a
[1:21:01] word from the word bride would come a
[1:21:04] child born of the supernatural
[1:21:08] not a child born of works
[1:21:12] amen whether it's the works of a man
[1:21:14] walking down and accept and join in the
[1:21:16] church that's works
[1:21:18] where it just says well i believe the
[1:21:20] message and i accept this doctrine
[1:21:22] that's works
[1:21:24] where it's a worked up emotion that
[1:21:26] works
[1:21:27] amen but this child will be born as a
[1:21:30] supernatural
[1:21:31] apart from the works of man where god
[1:21:34] comes down and bursts him by his spirit
[1:21:38] amen without without man's efforts
[1:21:43] but of the creation
[1:21:47] because when the word brings forth is a
[1:21:49] new creation
[1:21:52] it's not the molding of a man it's not
[1:21:55] learning how to dress it's not learning
[1:21:57] how to do good works it's not learning
[1:22:00] anything it's being born and when you're
[1:22:03] born his life is in you because his
[1:22:06] nature is in you it comes out
[1:22:08] automatically
[1:22:14] so we had it began to break forth
[1:22:18] as the spirit of god was poured out in
[1:22:20] this age of pentecost and
[1:22:23] and we had the zoos of movement
[1:22:26] but instead of producing a child of the
[1:22:29] supernatural and isaac it produced a
[1:22:31] child of the bonds woman just another
[1:22:34] denomination
[1:22:37] an ishmael
[1:22:39] now if you look with me to um genesis
[1:22:43] chapter 16 verse 7
[1:22:45] the angel lord found hagar by
[1:22:49] a fountain of water in the wilderness by
[1:22:52] the by the fountain in the way
[1:22:54] to sir
[1:22:56] and verse 6 of 10
[1:22:58] it says and the angel of the lord said
[1:23:00] unto her i will multiply thy seed
[1:23:04] that it shall not be numbered for
[1:23:06] multitude notice this is going to be a
[1:23:09] multitude without number
[1:23:13] now when it comes to the church it's not
[1:23:15] a lost bunch of people
[1:23:18] that come up in revelation chapter 7 out
[1:23:20] of great tribulation
[1:23:22] they miss the rapture but they're there
[1:23:25] they're given apart they're given an
[1:23:27] inheritance
[1:23:28] they're given a portion
[1:23:31] i mean
[1:23:32] and they are great people
[1:23:34] a multitude without number who do works
[1:23:38] of towards salvation of washing
[1:23:41] physically washing their robes in the
[1:23:44] blood of the lamb
[1:23:46] to make them white but i want you to
[1:23:48] understand that's not how you are
[1:23:50] dressed
[1:23:52] you're dressing white too you're
[1:23:54] but by a royal grant revelation 19 he
[1:23:58] said and it was granted to her to be
[1:24:01] arrayed and finally and clean and white
[1:24:05] amen one did it by what's the other it's
[1:24:08] supernatural is it ground it's something
[1:24:11] they didn't work yourself into it wasn't
[1:24:14] something they tried to earn
[1:24:16] it wasn't something they did on their
[1:24:18] own it was a great given to them by god
[1:24:22] by grace
[1:24:24] [Music]
[1:24:31] now
[1:24:33] john saw them
[1:24:35] come up through great tribulation
[1:24:38] not having the holy ghost but works of
[1:24:40] justification
[1:24:42] sanctification a multitude without
[1:24:44] number
[1:24:45] you see there is a bride and she's going
[1:24:48] in a rapture
[1:24:49] and there's a church who's going to go
[1:24:51] through tribulation
[1:24:55] and the difference will be the
[1:24:57] supernatural
[1:24:59] because i'm going to tell you you cannot
[1:25:01] on your own make yourself go into
[1:25:03] rapture
[1:25:05] we cannot own our own with physical
[1:25:07] means bring a resurrection
[1:25:10] it's supernatural we cannot change our
[1:25:13] bodies
[1:25:14] on our own nothing we can do nothing
[1:25:16] science can do
[1:25:18] nothing we can work ourselves up to we
[1:25:20] can't shout our way to it we can't dance
[1:25:22] our way to it it's all supernatural
[1:25:29] now
[1:25:32] 16 11
[1:25:34] it says
[1:25:35] and the angel lord
[1:25:38] said to her
[1:25:39] behold thou art with child
[1:25:42] and shall bear a son
[1:25:44] in his name shall be
[1:25:46] you shall call his name ismail
[1:25:49] because the lord has heard thy
[1:25:51] afflictions
[1:25:55] now you probably don't know this unless
[1:25:57] you really
[1:25:59] were a bible student studying it out and
[1:26:02] just
[1:26:02] contemplating maybe did a little search
[1:26:06] but this is the first time
[1:26:10] the first time
[1:26:14] the very first time that an angel is
[1:26:17] mentioned in the bible
[1:26:21] and it comes to hagar
[1:26:24] abund's woman
[1:26:27] notice
[1:26:28] what's now it's an abraham's group
[1:26:31] it's in abraham's church
[1:26:34] are you with me but it comes to bomb's
[1:26:36] woman
[1:26:38] that's right
[1:26:39] and it comes concerning abraham's seed
[1:26:43] an israelite an ishmael
[1:26:47] now
[1:26:48] you know i i i want to just i just want
[1:26:50] to say something about it you know
[1:26:53] the angel of the lord that has come in
[1:26:55] our day
[1:26:57] because we know it's come
[1:26:59] 1946 it appears to a a man a prophet of
[1:27:04] god
[1:27:05] and it it gifts him and sends him out
[1:27:07] with a message
[1:27:09] gets word that it went to first
[1:27:12] the pentecostals
[1:27:14] amen
[1:27:15] the angel first came to pentecost so you
[1:27:17] see the azusa street pentecost wrote the
[1:27:20] first books a man sent from god
[1:27:25] amen a prophet visits south africa
[1:27:28] they're the ones that took the first
[1:27:29] sermons as the eagles stirred their
[1:27:31] nests in the eleventh commandment and
[1:27:33] different other ones and began to print
[1:27:34] them
[1:27:36] they're the ones that made the campaigns
[1:27:38] and set it together and it was in their
[1:27:40] churches that it happened
[1:27:43] what i'm telling you the angel came
[1:27:45] first to hagar
[1:27:48] the bomb's woman
[1:27:51] now
[1:27:52] but but notice what they did is
[1:27:55] brother branham told us he said they
[1:27:56] denied the supernatural birth
[1:28:00] you see they took speaking in tongues
[1:28:02] over
[1:28:04] the supernatural
[1:28:06] you said brother timothy
[1:28:08] speaking in tongues is supernatural it
[1:28:10] can be
[1:28:11] but that's not what they had they worked
[1:28:13] it up
[1:28:15] getting people down the altar shove them
[1:28:17] on the back and jabbing their chins and
[1:28:19] getting them to say a word over and over
[1:28:22] and it was a work of man and not the
[1:28:26] work of the holy ghost
[1:28:28] but what were they doing trying to wash
[1:28:30] their robes
[1:28:32] with works
[1:28:42] there is a real genuine speaking in
[1:28:43] tongues
[1:28:45] and it doesn't come by jabbing your chin
[1:28:48] it doesn't come by somebody saying jesus
[1:28:50] jesus until they have a confusion of
[1:28:52] language
[1:28:53] that's not the way it happened on the
[1:28:55] day of pentecost
[1:28:57] amen it was supernatural on the day of
[1:28:59] pentecost and it's got to be
[1:29:01] supernatural when god does it
[1:29:05] are you with me it's not a learned
[1:29:07] behavior i've been in charismatic
[1:29:09] meetings where they when they say okay
[1:29:11] everybody right now raise your hands
[1:29:13] like this
[1:29:14] and just start saying whatever comes to
[1:29:16] your mind
[1:29:19] i'll speak of him later a little a
[1:29:21] little bit you know but i listened a
[1:29:23] little bit to john osteen
[1:29:25] who was the father of joel osteen
[1:29:28] and and and he
[1:29:30] he started moving from the baptist
[1:29:33] into a charismatic baptist in 1958 and
[1:29:36] i'll talk about that a little more later
[1:29:38] but there he said the first word i got
[1:29:40] from god was tah so i said
[1:29:43] [Laughter]
[1:29:49] you see you see it was men
[1:29:53] with an earnest desire
[1:29:57] to see the supernatural to see the
[1:29:59] promise come to pass
[1:30:02] but what they do they took a
[1:30:03] manufactured a manufactured tongue
[1:30:06] something you could do by your own works
[1:30:10] and you can work up you can work up
[1:30:13] dancing or shouting or
[1:30:16] or crying
[1:30:18] or speaking in tongues or you can work
[1:30:20] up any of that and you can also work up
[1:30:22] a theology
[1:30:26] or just accept this creed and if you say
[1:30:28] you believe this and you know if you if
[1:30:30] you claim to believe that you can work
[1:30:32] up any of it it's all works
[1:30:37] and when it does it bursts and hiss me
[1:30:39] out
[1:30:41] amen
[1:30:44] so now here come ishmael
[1:30:47] he came by doctrine by man's own efforts
[1:30:50] to bring it to pass
[1:30:52] remember sarah got this idea the
[1:30:56] weakness of her faith
[1:30:59] produced an ishmael
[1:31:01] the weakness of the church's faith
[1:31:03] produces ishmaels
[1:31:06] it produces the bondsman receiving the
[1:31:09] sea rather than the true woman
[1:31:13] it produces hybrids
[1:31:16] instead of the original sea
[1:31:19] or the promising
[1:31:21] now so ishmael came by sarah
[1:31:24] disbelieving the word was for her
[1:31:27] she believed now listen this is where a
[1:31:30] lot of people do it they can believe
[1:31:32] jesus can do it
[1:31:34] they can believe jesus did it
[1:31:37] they can believe he opened the eyes of
[1:31:39] the blind
[1:31:41] they can believe that he can work to
[1:31:43] supernatural
[1:31:44] they can believe come on somebody they
[1:31:47] can believe he can heal the sick
[1:31:50] they can believe she rose from the dead
[1:31:53] but they can't believe the church can do
[1:31:55] it
[1:31:59] and sarah was good at believing oh
[1:32:02] abraham it's for you
[1:32:04] it's for you
[1:32:06] you can do it
[1:32:10] you know there's many of them around
[1:32:12] around today they believe the prophet
[1:32:14] can do it but not you
[1:32:19] they don't have enough faith to believe
[1:32:21] the promises to the church yes
[1:32:24] they'll say they look back and say oh
[1:32:25] yeah he could do it yeah it happened
[1:32:27] then
[1:32:30] and those kind of things produces his
[1:32:32] meals
[1:32:34] because people desire the church has got
[1:32:36] to give birth and so you know to bring
[1:32:38] this word to past we manufacture
[1:32:41] either doctrines and creeds or emotion
[1:32:48] now i want you to get it
[1:32:50] i want you to understand something as we
[1:32:53] look at ishmael
[1:32:55] because ishmael does not represent a
[1:32:57] lost people
[1:32:59] it represents a multitude without number
[1:33:01] who go through the tribulation or given
[1:33:03] life at the white throne judgment
[1:33:06] read revelation 7.
[1:33:08] their children are the bondswoman
[1:33:11] but now i want you to hear this for a
[1:33:13] moment you see the the the angel
[1:33:17] showed care for even hagar in the
[1:33:21] ishmael
[1:33:26] i i don't want you to miss that point
[1:33:28] it's too important the angel
[1:33:30] showed care
[1:33:33] benevolence
[1:33:35] love understanding
[1:33:38] for hagar
[1:33:40] and her offspring
[1:33:44] now
[1:33:46] he would he would come in genesis
[1:33:48] chapter 16 verse 12
[1:33:50] and he will be a wild man
[1:33:56] and his hand will be against every man
[1:33:59] and every man's hand against him
[1:34:03] so to literally say what the bible
[1:34:06] actually said in the translation
[1:34:09] he'll be a wild donkey of a man
[1:34:12] that's what the bible calls him
[1:34:15] the bible in the original hebrew says he
[1:34:17] will be a wild ass of a man
[1:34:21] and his hand will be against everybody
[1:34:23] and everybody's hand against him and he
[1:34:25] will live in hostility toward all his
[1:34:30] brothers well look at them today
[1:34:34] 40 000 different denominations and every
[1:34:36] one of them's right and they're
[1:34:37] everyone's the ones that's going to
[1:34:38] heaven everybody else is going to hell
[1:34:45] why their hands are against everybody
[1:34:47] you see he was a child of the bonds
[1:34:49] woman
[1:34:50] but god is determined
[1:34:52] would you understand and determine god
[1:34:54] he is
[1:34:56] that the instrument will not be heir
[1:34:58] with the free that there is a rapture of
[1:35:01] a bride of christ who is the church and
[1:35:04] then there's a church that goes through
[1:35:06] the tribulation and they're not going to
[1:35:07] be heirs together
[1:35:11] now
[1:35:12] let me tell you again i want you to get
[1:35:14] it god bless them
[1:35:17] god blessed ismail
[1:35:19] god made him a mighty nation
[1:35:23] you know you look around and you say
[1:35:25] well they've got mighty buildings yes
[1:35:27] god bless them they've got big
[1:35:29] congregations yes god bless them
[1:35:33] they even have miracles yeah god blesses
[1:35:36] them
[1:35:37] he's the angel cares for them
[1:35:42] you know a lot of times people are
[1:35:45] surprised because they hear somebody out
[1:35:47] there you know a miracle happen don't
[1:35:50] get surprised the angel cares for them
[1:35:55] you know god did mighty miracles for
[1:35:57] oral roberts
[1:36:00] for a.a allen
[1:36:02] brother branham mentions a man by the
[1:36:04] name of john osteen he calls him brother
[1:36:06] osteen from texas but it was john osteen
[1:36:10] the father of joel osteen
[1:36:13] john was about the age of my mother said
[1:36:15] boy he was born in 1921 he'd be 101
[1:36:18] years old now
[1:36:21] in 1958 his daughter lisa
[1:36:25] was born with a cerebral palsy
[1:36:29] and he had a hunger for god and for more
[1:36:31] god he longed he began to long for the
[1:36:35] god of the book of acts
[1:36:37] he was a baptist believer
[1:36:40] but he said there's more to it
[1:36:43] there's there's more to it than this and
[1:36:45] his his daughter was born in 1958
[1:36:48] daughter lisa was born with cerebral
[1:36:50] palsy and and having a hunger for more
[1:36:52] of god and determined to know god as a
[1:36:54] healer
[1:36:56] he did not accept what the doctor said
[1:36:58] that she'd never walked she'd never
[1:36:59] crawled she'd never talk she'd never be
[1:37:02] mentally able to do anything and he
[1:37:04] would not accept it
[1:37:08] i think that's a good policy
[1:37:10] when we hear the doctor say something
[1:37:12] that's his report but what did god say
[1:37:15] who hath believed his report
[1:37:18] to whom is the arm of the lord revealed
[1:37:22] amen if you believe his report the arm
[1:37:24] of the lord is going to be revealed to
[1:37:25] you
[1:37:26] that's the whole thing you'll never see
[1:37:29] the arm of the lord do you believe the
[1:37:30] report
[1:37:32] you have to believe that he is and that
[1:37:34] he's going to reward those who
[1:37:35] diligently seek him
[1:37:39] you have to realize he's going to be
[1:37:41] your healer
[1:37:42] and that his word is true and it's for
[1:37:45] you
[1:37:47] remember he that cometh that god must
[1:37:49] believe that he is not that he was
[1:37:52] but that he is
[1:37:54] not that he's going to be but that he is
[1:38:00] we can look back at yesterday to see
[1:38:02] what god is today
[1:38:04] we can look into the future and know
[1:38:06] he'll be that in the future
[1:38:09] is that right
[1:38:11] amen but he didn't rep he didn't accept
[1:38:13] the doctor's report the doctor said your
[1:38:16] daughter will never live it'll never
[1:38:19] never thrive
[1:38:20] and and he hungered more from god
[1:38:23] you know
[1:38:24] there and and and so he said you know
[1:38:28] we're going to we're going to take god
[1:38:30] at his word doctors can't help us so he
[1:38:33] anointed his child with oil him and his
[1:38:35] wife prayed over that child and believed
[1:38:38] god and it was a process
[1:38:40] but today she's a well woman
[1:38:46] man she's a well woman she has a
[1:38:47] ministry
[1:38:48] she she's been a missionary she's been
[1:38:50] there she's done a lot of works
[1:38:54] why because her dad refused to believe
[1:38:57] the doctor's report
[1:39:01] and later his church in houston would
[1:39:03] grow
[1:39:04] up to between eight and fifteen thousand
[1:39:06] people
[1:39:08] and and and his emphasis if you ever
[1:39:11] listen to him which i did because i just
[1:39:13] got curious about it after you know
[1:39:16] hearing some of joel osteen and what
[1:39:19] joel
[1:39:20] speaking i thought what does daddy
[1:39:22] preach
[1:39:24] what does daddy preach because he
[1:39:26] refuses to preach on hell and sin and
[1:39:29] evil and wrong
[1:39:32] and he just preaches on god's blessings
[1:39:34] and faith and the feel-good message
[1:39:36] and i said well what does daddy preach
[1:39:39] and so i went back to listen to his
[1:39:41] daddy and his daddy his emphasis was on
[1:39:45] receiving the baptism in the holy spirit
[1:39:49] and he said he preached you know you
[1:39:51] received the new birth first and then
[1:39:55] and then after receiving the new birth
[1:39:57] which he believed he had done in the
[1:39:58] baptist church he got a he got a baptism
[1:40:02] into the holy spirit with evidence of
[1:40:04] speaking in tongues
[1:40:08] and and so this is what he believed he
[1:40:11] believed
[1:40:12] the supernatural and he saw it work his
[1:40:14] wife his wife duty would come down with
[1:40:17] terminal cancer
[1:40:20] and with terminal cancer there that
[1:40:22] would pray the prayer of faith and now
[1:40:25] she's in her 90's still cancer-free
[1:40:35] under son joel the emphasis changed now
[1:40:37] to faith-build and feel good message and
[1:40:40] it's grown they got a stadium full of 35
[1:40:43] 000 and they're praising god for that
[1:40:45] and i thank god for ever solely help
[1:40:48] every person that attends
[1:40:51] amen i'd rather see them in there than
[1:40:53] in a bar room somewhere
[1:40:55] amen but i tell you these again was the
[1:40:59] children of the bonds woman
[1:41:02] and the supernatural was there
[1:41:05] you can't deny it but they were never
[1:41:07] born of it
[1:41:10] i'm going to get to this here in a
[1:41:12] minute
[1:41:13] even even the abraham he wanted he
[1:41:16] wanted ishmael when god said i've got
[1:41:18] something better
[1:41:20] i've got a better plan
[1:41:22] i'm going to do something supernatural
[1:41:23] he said well
[1:41:25] he says in genesis 17 18 oh that israel
[1:41:28] might live before thee
[1:41:31] he begins to immediately say god make
[1:41:34] out of ishmael you know i've already got
[1:41:36] a seed
[1:41:37] there's already you know bless this
[1:41:39] bless this
[1:41:40] bless this work take it in the rapture
[1:41:42] take it to the chain two for it
[1:41:45] and god said
[1:41:47] you know there he said as for ishmael in
[1:41:49] verse 20 i have heard thee behold i have
[1:41:53] blessed him i will make him fruitful and
[1:41:56] multiply him exceedingly and twelve
[1:41:58] princes shall he beget and i will make
[1:42:01] him a great nation
[1:42:06] are you with me
[1:42:07] amen this is what he said i'm going to
[1:42:10] bless them
[1:42:11] i'm going to prosper them
[1:42:14] i'm going to use them
[1:42:17] and then they can say well listen the
[1:42:20] angel came to us
[1:42:21] the angel gave me my name
[1:42:26] it's me
[1:42:27] he named me the angel showed us the
[1:42:30] spring of life
[1:42:32] the angel was there to guide us and help
[1:42:36] us
[1:42:37] but he was never born of the
[1:42:38] supernatural
[1:42:42] i want you to get it now
[1:42:44] i want you to understand that the angel
[1:42:46] there was in charge of the whole church
[1:42:49] both the foolish and the wise virgins
[1:42:54] and he moves in both of them
[1:42:57] and he blesses both of them
[1:43:01] and he honors both of them
[1:43:08] but only one gets born of the
[1:43:11] supernatural
[1:43:13] only one goes through a body change so
[1:43:16] the promised son can come
[1:43:19] only one receives the experience of el
[1:43:22] shaddai god almighty
[1:43:28] so there is a church and there's a bride
[1:43:32] amen
[1:43:33] now i want you just i just want i want
[1:43:36] you to go through this just for me with
[1:43:38] me for a minute psalms 91 verse 11
[1:43:41] because
[1:43:44] i've been thinking a lot
[1:43:46] in this past week
[1:43:48] about the angel in charge
[1:43:57] there is an angel in charge
[1:44:04] let me go back again there is an angel
[1:44:08] specifically given to see
[1:44:11] this church into a rapture
[1:44:19] there is an angel that guides the church
[1:44:22] into the tribulation and are saved
[1:44:25] in the tribulation
[1:44:29] there is an angel blessing
[1:44:33] now
[1:44:34] hold this thought
[1:44:36] revelation i mean psalms 91 verse 11
[1:44:39] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:44:41] thee to keep thee in thy ways
[1:44:44] now notice
[1:44:46] there is an angel given in charge
[1:44:50] to keep thee in the ways
[1:44:52] in all thy ways
[1:44:54] so god had an angel that was given
[1:44:56] charge over this message
[1:45:01] this message came by an angel
[1:45:06] the anointing came by an angel the gift
[1:45:09] came by an angel
[1:45:12] i want you to get it now and an angel
[1:45:15] has been given charge
[1:45:18] now he would appear to brother branham
[1:45:21] and and commission him to take a message
[1:45:24] of divine healing and will lead him all
[1:45:26] the way to the opening of the seven
[1:45:28] seals
[1:45:30] where that we are today preaching from
[1:45:32] the full word of god an open book
[1:45:35] not a closed book
[1:45:39] now
[1:45:41] and brother branham now has been gone as
[1:45:43] long as he was here 56 years but there
[1:45:46] was an angel that was
[1:45:48] it was that was given charge over this
[1:45:51] message and the word must come to pass
[1:45:56] i do want to say to you god cannot come
[1:45:59] here to the laodicean age the last age
[1:46:01] to the gentiles
[1:46:03] and find it too difficult
[1:46:05] that they're too lukewarm
[1:46:07] too many christ rejecters
[1:46:10] too many failures too many faults with
[1:46:13] her
[1:46:14] and abandon his project
[1:46:17] he cannot abandon redemption
[1:46:21] he cannot back up on his work
[1:46:24] he has to finish what he started
[1:46:27] are you with me
[1:46:28] now you see the angel appears to abraham
[1:46:32] and separated um
[1:46:34] hagar and ishmael from the other group
[1:46:36] and there comes a separation and then he
[1:46:39] appears to sarah discerns our hearts and
[1:46:42] gets her to believe and again what was
[1:46:44] he doing turning her back to the
[1:46:46] original pentecostal faith
[1:46:49] coming back to the original faith the
[1:46:52] original word and then he says as he as
[1:46:56] he comes into certain heart he said i
[1:46:59] will return again
[1:47:01] according to
[1:47:02] the time of life
[1:47:05] and sarah shall bring forth a son
[1:47:09] so he's watching over his word somebody
[1:47:12] help me preach
[1:47:14] amen even when they stray out of the
[1:47:16] promised land and go down to carrer and
[1:47:19] a young philistine king wants to take
[1:47:21] sarah and defiler the angel in charge
[1:47:26] says don't you touch her you're a dead
[1:47:29] man unless you restore the that man his
[1:47:31] wife and that man is my prophet and he's
[1:47:34] got to pray over you
[1:47:37] what was that an angel was in charge
[1:47:40] he was watching over the seed
[1:47:45] he was watching over the womb
[1:47:48] he was watching over the promise
[1:47:50] and i want you to know today the angel
[1:47:53] has not forgot his promise
[1:47:56] [Applause]

[1:48:29] four whims of the earth wars and strife
[1:48:32] and he ain't gonna let it loose until he
[1:48:35] seals 144 000 and before that he's got a
[1:48:38] seal of pride and take her in the
[1:48:40] rapture in the glory
[1:48:43] hallelujah
[1:48:47] are you with me
[1:48:48] amen they they can do nothing listen
[1:48:52] listen even until he gets locked into
[1:48:54] the place he said i can do nothing until
[1:48:57] you come here
[1:49:01] hallelujah

[1:49:21] charge i'll have a bride and she'll be

[1:53:42] court or somebody with me
[1:53:44] amen it wasn't anything with works
[1:53:47] in that place and man there was the

[1:53:58] sun was the light and it would get them
[1:54:00] and cloudy days and and rainy days and
[1:54:02] dreary days and ups and downs and ins

[1:55:21] anointing that comes and goes it's him
[1:55:25] and you have made the lord your refuge
[1:55:29] which and he you made him your
[1:55:31] habitation this is your dwelling place
[1:55:34] if you abide in me and my word abides
[1:55:36] and you ask what you will
[1:55:38] this only comes by the holy ghost that
[1:55:40] god don't come by fasting in prayer and
[1:55:43] reading work books of works and
[1:55:44] sanctification and holiness

[2:08:33] made everything right you did everything
[2:08:35] perfect you've always been good it ain't
[2:08:38] that it's because he set his love upon

[2:10:08] hallelujah
[2:10:10] what an hour are we living in
[2:10:12] what a day that we're in
[2:10:15] now listen
[2:10:16] a lot of this hybrid stuff ain't going
[2:10:18] to make it
[2:10:20] it won't produce the crop
[2:10:23] he would save ishmael oh that is not
[2:10:26] live before then god said i'll bless him
[2:10:28] but that ain't who i'm after
[2:10:32] amen i want one that is born not of your
[2:10:34] human strength i want one born of the
[2:10:36] supernatural
[2:10:37] [Music]
[2:10:38] i don't want one that's borne up by work
[2:10:41] up or by theology i want one that is
[2:10:43] born of the holy ghost
[2:10:45] that make me their habitation
[2:10:48] that i dwell in and they dwell in me
[2:10:54] why brother it's time we clean out the
[2:10:56] nest
[2:10:58] hey man this time a lot of us start over
[2:11:00] again
[2:11:01] but man we we've we've sat on these old
[2:11:04] eggs long enough
[2:11:05] throw them all rotten eggs out and start
[2:11:07] over again
[2:11:09] but start with the mate
[2:11:12] hallelujah start with the anointing of
[2:11:14] the holy ghost start with the power of
[2:11:16] god
[2:11:18] amen start there until you've got a nest
[2:11:20] full of eggs but brother it ain't
[2:11:22] something that won't hatch it's
[2:11:24] something to bring forth under the right
[2:11:25] atmosphere
[2:11:27] you wonder sometimes why is it that
[2:11:29] you're gonna have the atmosphere of the
[2:11:30] holy ghost and the power of god moving
[2:11:33] the great atmosphere and people sit
[2:11:35] there rot
[2:11:40] they didn't get with the mate
[2:11:42] they're unfertilized
[2:11:44] that's what's a matter with the churches
[2:11:46] they don't have they can't believe in
[2:11:48] the supernatural power because they
[2:11:50] haven't got nothing to believe with
[2:11:52] amen but you know how can you get faith
[2:11:55] out of a person that has nothing to have
[2:11:56] faith with if you've never been born
[2:11:58] again in the spirit of god you don't
[2:12:00] know the first principle of the power of
[2:12:02] resurrection
[2:12:08] so therefore again you know it takes a
[2:12:12] super natural birth god's going to take
[2:12:14] a supernatural people who believes in a
[2:12:18] supernatural birth in a supernatural
[2:12:21] rapture
[2:12:25] amen and brother when they come forth
[2:12:27] they're going to come forth with life in
[2:12:29] them
[2:12:30] you get some of these and they're born
[2:12:32] and listen i'm just going to take it for
[2:12:35] a moment you know you can you can take
[2:12:38] and and breed a sheep to a goat and they
[2:12:41] will actually will conceive
[2:12:45] it's called a
[2:12:46] gap i've seen a lot of geeks in my
[2:12:49] ministry
[2:12:52] they're not shapes or gates
[2:12:55] and a gape
[2:12:56] is a cross between
[2:12:58] us
[2:12:59] a sheep and a goat and science there's
[2:13:03] science that as i read upon it there are
[2:13:05] signs still denied today that won't ever
[2:13:08] breathe the breath of life said the
[2:13:09] chromosomes are off
[2:13:11] they can't do it they all they will
[2:13:13] bring forth but it'll always be still
[2:13:14] born
[2:13:17] and so they will be birthed now you know
[2:13:19] you can go up and google and whatever
[2:13:21] else and you might find somebody that
[2:13:22] claims it but you know there again you
[2:13:24] know i'm just using it for type
