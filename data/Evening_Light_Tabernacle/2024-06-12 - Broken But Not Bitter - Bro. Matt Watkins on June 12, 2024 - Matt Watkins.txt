of the Lord appreciate amen all of that worship and music and I just want to say uh it's just such a privilege to be here with you and uh it's been a little while and uh I uh I remember when I walked in the door I told brother Tim I remember this place I got good memories in this place it's all good memories just um just so glad to be here Amen to be part of the body of Christ and to be able to come and Minister Amen to you and I just want to uh say uh how grateful I am to brother Tim you know I was thinking just on the on the plane uh right over here I actually flew in um this this morning and I was just uh thinking this reminiscent over my life and I hope it's okay just to say this just before we begin but you know I just was reminiscing over the time all the way from when my my kids were just little bitty and uh you know now my son is a lot taller than me don't tell him I said that but he's a lot bigger guy than I am 20 20 about to be 21 years old it's amazing how fast time flies and I was just reminiscing and just thinking of the first time I ever came and got to minister and meet brother Tim brother Timothy their family and I was just thinking about all of the uh how blessed I am let me say it that way to have this many I know brother Tim is known around the world everywhere that I go in the world uh he's known around the world and and his ministry is but I just want to say that I've been blessed to not just know him uh in the pull pit but to get to know him as a person and I've just found such a genuine uh just the nature of Christ and brother Tim I just want to tell you brother Tim how much I love you and appreciate you I believe this church feels that way about your pastor amen you ought to thank God not just for a good preacher he's one of the best but someone who I've I've seen you know I've just I've watched in his not just in you know just in his nature but he he's a strong firm person with deep convictions but yet he's he's got the gentle ESS and the meekness and the humility of Christ and it's it's ministered to me it's spoken to me he been a great blessing Helman brother Timothy brother Joe brother Aaron all of them have came and been such blessings to our church there in Buford and and they just um they just brother Tim and brother Timothy came and just blessed us just here uh for our last meetings that we had and so amen I just want to say I'm so glad to be part of the body of Christ aren't you happy to be in that family amen aren't you glad to be called amen one of the few amen I can say I'm one of them Lord amen and we might be separated by Miles and distances and you have your challenges here and we have our challenges there but one day we're going to we're going to put our feet up and uh trouble will be over all of our pain will be over all the sorrow will be yesterday and this will just look like a faint memory Amen on that happy Golden Shore there's just Joy amen unspeakable amen but while we're here but until then as the song says My Heart Will Go On singing amen praise the lord well we just want to uh have you turn to the book of Hosea chapter 6 if you have your Bible Hosea chapter 6 I just uh want to say tonight I'm just told brother Tim that I'm just going to pretend that I'm home this is a Wednesday night and I'm going to pretend I'm home is that all right all right if I do that just pretend like I'm preaching to home folk and thank you amen and uh just just um just preach what the Lord just so pressed upon my heart I don't have any kind of um you know fireworks we would say but just something the Lord really just so weighed upon my heart so heavy the whole ride with you know coming up here the whole uh plane right over the Lord was just stirring my heart and then brother Tim just said something in the vehicle that just gave me such a confirmation and so I just trust that the Lord is just here amen and he has something for you I believe that if you can touch Jesus tonight then that's all that really matters and it doesn't matter me what I've got to say what I've prepared and my notes and the things that I'll speak tonight really doesn't matter if we touch him amen and so I've got things laid out here before me but I just uh want to be obedient to the Lord Jesus what I'm going to minister to you tonight is is very close to my heart the Lord just gives you sermons in many different ways and through study and preparation and things that you've looked at but the Lord brought this as something that was it's so real so if I'm if I'm extra passionate tonight know that it's genuine that comes straight from my heart amen and so we just want to minister to you tonight I want to title this broken but not bitter broken but not bitter Hosea chapter 6 verse one and I'm going to do something I'm going to I got this fancy new watch our church at home loves this there's this little timer right here and it's a 1H hour timer you could think about a Christmas gift or something like that um be a good gift but you press play and then it lets me know when I've preached an hour our church loves this at home so um it don't work here what I tell them though is when the timer goes off that don't mean I'm done it just means we've stepped into [Laughter] eternity be careful amen Hosea chapter 6 let's just begin reading I'm just going to read one verse of scripture here and then I'll have you be seated verse one of Hosea 6 says come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us aren't you glad that the one who tears can also heal yes he hath smitten and he will bind us up Lord we give you thanks truly Lord Jesus I consider myself Lord the least Lord who could stand up here and minister to your children Lord at this moment God all that matters is that we don't see men we don't see people we don't even see each other Lord but if I could have one request tonight Lord it would be that we have that mount Transfiguration experience Lord where we don't see anybody we don't see each other we just see the Lord Jesus high and lifted up I pray God that you would use these thoughts Lord that you've impressed upon me Lord and I feel it as a weight upon my shoulder Lord for I know God that you've come to minister maybe to one to two Lord specifically to needs oh God I pray that we would look past Lord our each other look past the human veil of Flesh Lord and may we draw out from you exactly what we need tonight Lord I pray that you would be with me in my and Lord in the things that I'll say Lord keep me Father only focused on and to say the things only that your Holy Spirit would want to speak help us Lord to listen we pray Grant it Lord one and all we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated Abraham Lincoln actually said something very powerful and you Brothers I don't have any kind of slide clicker so you can just you can advance it just some quotes maybe that's it there I guess he said something that was so powerful uh I thought was so good I I wrote it down here and he says nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a man's character give him power nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a man's character give him power it's actually quite incredible to see the results of what power can reveal power can be a very strong intoxicant in fact you'll find that very keen in the business world and Men who've received power and have been given the bounds to control things and to set parameters and to where their word or their rule carries weight and it can become like an intoxicant I can say it this way it power can reveal character or what a person's really made of in a way that almost nothing else can how they not only exercise that power but how they acquire that power how they rise to that position how they find their s with responsibility to be able to exercise power it illuminates the the the what you can't see you know often times what you see is not actually who they are but actually who they really are is is in that very inner manner that inner nature is as brother bham said the real you laying under all of the layers and all of the things that you see externally it's amazing because it's been power that has led to some of the most tragic downfalls in history it's actually been power that has led to subjugation of whole races of people and and to create people that would become viewed as lesser uh in equality and become slaves it's been power that's been given to governments and some of the greatest downfalls in society and culture has been actually power that has been exercised without character now it's incredible because very much like that on the reverse of that it's been power when ruled with character that is actually been some of the greatest what you would call Golden Ages you could think of the divin kingdom when David as the Bible says was a man after God's Own Heart and it was under the rule of David that Israel prospered almost more than any other era that they have to date because it was a man who didn't just come into power but a man who went through the school of suffering and trial and tribulation you see if you ever want to know how God reveals or gives power all you got to do is look how David received the throne as I've said many times and I've said it before I'll give you two versions of David and you pick and tell me which one you'd rather be I'll give you the version of David that is in a palace he's living in a mansion He has everything in in the world that you could have at your fingertips modern in that day what you could ever imagine he has all of the money all of the wealth he has armies at his command and his control he's got no stress he's got no worry he's got no anxiety he's not pressured you know by Financial things or kind of things that might you would call pressure in your life he hasn't made in the shade as we would say he has people and servants and people that are his at his disposal he has everything money in the bank all kinds no kinds of pressure and you say my goodness boy what a David what a life what a man well let me give you the other David this David doesn't have any money he doesn't have any army in fact everybody he's running from he only has just a few friends he's running for his life he's living in the desert he hasn't had a bath in three weeks he's being ate and bit up by mosquitoes come on all right he's running for his life he's dealing with pressure can't hardly sleep at night because of a man a king a crazy King who's trying to kill him now you tell me which David you'd rather be but let me give you what the Bible records there was never a more carnal corrupt David than the David who lived in the kingdom and the throne with no pressure and no worry and no struggle and no trouble but the Bible says there was not a more spiritual David as the David who was running for his life you see we often question trials and tribulations and brother bam says why why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble it puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and it's through these troubles and struggles that were brought into the nature of Christ right you see it would be through that struggle or that trial or that suffering or that tribulation actually would be the tool or the factory the meal that God would use to refine the character where he could say David is a man after my own heart you take that forward to the very life of Jesus and even when the prophecy over brother barham's life and you know the prophecy that goes forth and and Danny Henry there is as the interpretation comes if you ever look at that interpretation it says you've chosen the harder way yeah and he and he and he emphasizes that and he says and it's it's your choice it's a way of your own choosing in other words I didn't force you William brandom I didn't make you I didn't pressure you but you chose the harder way you chose not a fleet of Cadillacs you didn't choose a you know a you know some great big church or some you know great big Seminary that we be we be would be named after you but but you're the one who chose this harder way of Rejection it was your way but you know what the what the voice says and it's my way because it was the way of Jesus and because you have chosen this a great portion of Heaven awaits you the prophet of God says this and it's so foreign to us in our mind of what we think of when we think of this word suffering brother bram's quotes this in Romans if you have that uh you could just display that brother Brandon be begins to speak of this in Romans and he quotes Romans chapter 8 and he says why does he stand by this is the saman church age the reason is in Romans 8:17 and of children than heirs Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon I love this that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us you know it's amazing because and I'm just going to take just a moment to say this and I'm not teaching on this I know that you're very well Tall on this and and and but let me just say this that you know I fully believe with all of my heart that as a holy ghost filled sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I fully believe the words of a prophet that at that moment your name is as good on the check as your father's name do we have a church that believes that here tonight that you're not waiting for some kind of authority to come to your life when you're born of the spirit of God there's not some fourth stage or maybe by some works of yourself or some you know perfect track record that's somewhere down the road that God finally gives you the the power of heaven but but the Bible says that whatsoever you say whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whato whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in in in heaven and the prophet of God would say that your name is as good on the check as his name that all authority is brother bandam gives the example of that little police officer and he says you know he may be 65 lounds soaking wet he may be just a little Barney five on the road you know what would happen had he got there out in the street and he did he didn't have those clothes on he didn't have that uniform on he was just wearing his street clothes and he held that you know held the stop there at the traffic light and put his hands up and said stop you know what brother R said said they just blow right past him but what makes the difference his stature no his stature didn't change come on somebody his did he get taller no he didn't get any taller did his voice get louder no it didn't get any louder the only difference between that man is now he's got a badge on and behind that badge is not his authority but there's an entire city that backs up his word and now with that uniform when you put on the robe of this word it's not your power or your Authority or your or your or your behavior or some good track record it's not that you've got a big loud voice or some great gift but you could be the weakest Christian could be the smallest in stature make the most mistakes in your life but when you're filled with the Holy Ghost you have all of of Heaven is backing up your word you have all authority and all power hallelujah it's not your power it's a power that comes from above and I believe that with all of my heart but let me just stop here just for a moment and say that yes you have all authority as a son or daughter of God but let me give you the words of a prophet power without character is satanic hello do we believe a prophet so God is Not Just wi nearly giving out power in fact let me just say it this way and I just want to say it as I feel the unction of the Holy Spirit you've received power from the Holy Ghost but God wants to give you more Hello I said you have power filled in Sons and Daughters of God f with the spirit but don't stop there listen friends this ain't a one-off one time you need a one-off one time experience but you've got to feed that experience you've got to feed that Holy Ghost you've got to give it the word but God doesn't want to just stop there God wants to bring you into so much power actually to where your words will be deity the same as deity speaking I want you to notice how brother bam says this in the saman church age and these were just just so powerful to me and I know you've read them and I know you've heard them but may the Lord make them more real to us tonight can can you say that unless notice what brother brandom says here in the saman church age he says unless we suffer with him we canot reign with him you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift and a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne hold on a minute you mean God actually wants to share his throne with me uhhuh and since he wants to share his throne on the same basis ahuh on the same basis that he overcame and is sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him are you with me here tonight I'm just going slow on purpose I don't want to glaze over this I just think it's so so good you see God's purpose is not just to fill us with the Holy Ghost and to give us power H for the miraculous I'm believing and I am all for that but let me just say that the power of the Holy Ghost one of the purposes that God gives you power is to bring this character and this nature into his image and the greatest enemy you have is not your brother it's not your sister it's not your pastor it's not the brother who offended you it's not your neighbor brother bandam says when I looked in the mirror I realize my number one enemy is William brandom and your number one enemy is yourself and so the purpose of the token the purpose of the of that literal life of Jesus Christ coming back upon the worshipper was so that the nature of the Lamb would come back on the worshipper amen oh I hope that you catch that here tonight because I believe it's more important than you've probably than than what we've emphasized before the the purpose of the token life is not just for an experience that's wonderful but it's so that the nature of the Lamb replaces your Fallen nature to where your temper is in line with the Holy Ghost to where your passion is subject to the Holy Ghost to where your mood is not based upon the mood you woke up with uh in your carnal uh Fallen flesh but your body mind spirit is subject to the Token life friends can I just say this here today because I feel it burning in my heart I am more Desiring of that type of Miracle than any other miracle in my life you say what kind of Miracle brother Matt to take my nature that's full of problems and complexes and issues sometimes temper sometimes up come on somebody am I preaching to Christians the greatest Miracle is that God could take my nature and so crucify that nature to where the nature of my lamb comes back on display in my life that's the literal Life of Christ the prophet of God would say it this way Abel was slain on the same rock that his lamb was slain upon in other words he was being identified with his sacrifice power notice this with character is is fit to rule and since he wants us to over to to share his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is sat down with his father on his throne I love this and the little temporary suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that would be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much much tribulation right thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials yes sir I'll just raise my hand for South Carolina we all have trials how about y'all here good folks in Louisiana we all have trials and we are all tried keep those hands up we are all tried and chasons as Sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering is the church I want to be in the church that has not suffered where's it at brother Matt I want I'll move my whole family the church that is you mean I can have a church that is not suffering yeah yeah you can but let me tell you what a prophet said the church that is not suffering hasn't got it is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God you mean this is how much the Lord Jesus looks at suffering to mode character listen to what the prophet says now this now now this special condition in samna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no True Believer free from it this is of god this is the will of God now I believe that I could say here tonight and I believe it would not be any kind of a you know wrong way I believe that it's perfectly uh fine for all of us and I believe we'd be dishonest if we wouldn't admit and say Lord I want the power of God in my life come on can I get somebody I I would like the power how many moms would agree with me and dads I need the power of God operating in my life I need the power of God operating in my prayer life in my work in my home in my body in my health at my church I need the power of God and let me say it more than ever before we don't need to be going backwards we don't need to be getting stagnant we don't need to slow down this isn't a Time For Less of the power of God if there was ever a time for more power and more Authority and more faith in what we already have it's right now yes sir that's right and if I was to tell you that I've got a big button you could come up and push and when you push that button you have all the power I promise there'd be a stampede here trying to push that button to get more power but what if I told you in order to get more power you've got to have character and in order to get character you've got to have a battle and in order order for there to be a battle there's got to be a measure of suffering he said for the matter you ask him for suffering nobody my hands are down as tight as they can possibly be but here's what I know if I ask the Lord Lord I want to be more like you I want to be more like the Lord Jesus this is how it comes you see it would be through some of those greatest darkest times in Believers lives all the way down through history to where they questioned what's happening in their life to where they question everything around them and and and there's times when it didn't make any sense whatsoever and they didn't realize the very thing that they had asked God for was the work God was doing through the Holy Ghost in their life through suffering it's incredible because brother Ram says this this special condition it must not M he says he says it's the will of God it's applied to every age we need us we need the Lord I love this to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it is that your prayer is that your prayer that we not just suffer but we be Christlike while suffering it's amazing because this is so foreign to the world that we live today to think of suffering even even let me just say it this way even in the Bible it was foreign to the Jews it was foreign all the way from the times of job when job is suffering in his life and his so-called friends ask him you know job come on what's wrong what would you do job come on would you it couldn't make sense even in the days of Jesus when there's a man that's born blind in the Book of John and his disciples asked him and sayl why was this man born blind and notice their reasoning was it because of his daddy and his daddy was born in sin and because of that he's born blind notice their thinking they could not fathom that God would allow personal struggle or trial in their life and that would somehow be the will of God right that we could say this was the will was he born blind because his dad's sin or his mother's sin you know what Jesus says neither but that the word works of God might be made manifest that's why he was born blind let me just stop here and say there is no struggle there is no trial there is no hardship there is no problem that ever comes to your life I don't care how hard that doesn't carry this purpose that the works of your heavenly father might be made manifest in your life do you know let me say this and I'll just be careful I'll I say this do you know there's a holy ghost School of suffering and fact Philippians 3 would call it the fellowship of his suffering you know brother Joe I like that because it sort of sounds like you know a group or a club that you're part of what do you I'm got the I'm in the fellowship of his sufferings that this was actually what Paul was saying that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and a thousand hands went up and said that I may know him in the power of his resurrection but you can you keep your hand up and in the fellowship of his sufferings to be made conformable un his death it was actually that Holy Ghost school as we call it and let me just say this you say brother Matt who was part of that school Saints all down Through the Ages from the beginning of time who went through that school of suffering and trials and hardships and afflictions Saints who have been tossed to and fro tempted on every side the Bible speaks of it that way that that that that let me let you know that that that that you know that they were torn apart they were swn asunder and it says that this way of whom the world was not even worthy you say what was it brother Matt it was God's School of suffering the Holy Ghost school you know who founded that school Jesus guess who created the curriculum Jesus guess who created the test Jesus but let me tell you he passed the test in fact he's not going to put you through a school that he didn't graduate from himself and he proved that you can go through anything in your life even death itself and come out on the other side and Overcomer it was Jesus actually who formed this school to where he was would endure some of the greatest thing let me just preach here just for a moment because we hear all about mental health and and I and mental disease and mental sickness and I mean no way minimizing that that's a there's a real mental health that that that that that people can battle let me tell you what it is cancer is just a name they give it tuberculosis is just a name diabetes is just a name tell you what a prophet called it called it a Tormentor a demon spirit so no matter what mental health issue that there is it's no different it's just a demon Spirit but let me tell you what Jesus knew what it was like he knew what it was like to suffer mental anguish did you know that did you realize that that Jesus actually suffered mental suffered mental and physical pain he was rejected he knew what rejection feels like you ever felt rejected and it's one of the hardest things is the feeling of rejection he knew what it was like to be rejected he knew what it was like to be caught a liar he knew what it was like to be abused mocked ridiculed he knew what it was like to be lonely all alone no friends even your best friends have betrayed you he knew what it was like to go hungry the Lord Jesus I've never known what that was like thankful to God in my my whole life I've had a family that took care of me but I know that there are people who've had to go hungry before to be poor without food do you know Jesus knew what it was like to be hungry to be poor he knew what it was like to be unloved you know that's a real thing people can suffer and go through in their life I'm glad and you might be the beneficiary of a home that loved you you ought to be thankful you don't know what you have till you don't have it and he knew what it was like to not be loved as brother Brandon begins to reminisce about his childhood and just there for a moment you can tell it's even awkward for him to talk about it talks about how when he was a young man he was made fun of ridicule didn't fit in with nobody tried to fit in with friends at school he was always the Oddball and he said nobody ever loved me until I met the Lord Jesus and I found the first person who really loved me unconditionally Jesus knew what it was like to be unloved he knew what it felt like Jesus knew what it felt like to be shamed to be made the end you know the the ridicule to be slandered and his name slandered and lies told about him he was called a liar he was new he was called a fraud he was called a false prophet he was ridiculed and and made fun of laughed at lied about uh slandered and and and and CAU a false prophet he knew what humiliation felt like you say brother Matt what do you do and I'm letting you realize that there is no pain you can name tonight that you're heav L father did not become a kinsman redeemer to he felt what it was like even his own Brothers misunderstood him his own mother and father his own mother his brothers didn't believe in him did you know that go study of the Book of Matthew didn't believe in him didn't believe until he was dying on a cross he knew what it felt like to be misunderstood you knew what it felt like to be defenseless and accusations and not able to defend yourself the Bible says he opened not his mouth you say brother Matt what what are you preaching I'm preaching to you tonight if I could just give you my heart I'm all for the power of God friends we talk about the power and I want the power of God in my life but do we talk about the character that comes with that power that it's actually the nature of the Lamb that it's the nature do you realize the prophet of God would go further to say that that Not only was the human life of Jesus the human life of Jesus was to come back on the worshipper do you don't want to know what God is trying to do to your human life he's trying to bring your human life to match this life and oh I'm so hungry for the Lord to take my human life and crucify it so much to where my human life matches the life of my lamb oh do you feel that way here tonight friend to wear that nature oh I just feel the Holy Spirit right now I'm just gonna just going to obey him just for a moment you know I I fully believe let me just say this here today I fully believe that that that that the that that the that the nature of Christ came on full display in this generation yes sir can I just preach to you here for a moment that the coming of Christ was in this generation the coming of of Christ as the mighty Angel to sins and and Revelations 10 and what would what was it going to be it was going to be us the son of man Ministry displayed do you realize a prophet preaches a message called the trial and that message he preaches on the critic and Mr skeptic do you realize what he's doing he's actually putting his own Ministry on trial and he comes to the end of that sermon and says I challenge you to see the son of man revealed in the bride's body notice he says I catch your thoughts I know you think that was me what was it let me just tell you friends it was more than just a prophet like an Old Testament it was more than just a you know a reformer just coming down Through the Ages but this was the very son of man Ministry oh do we have a church that believes that here today that what you witness in this generation was the Fulfillment of Luke 17 in the days of the coming of the son of man what was that son of man it was the word made flesh and you know what you witnessed you witness the sign of the son of man you witness the sign of MDC you witness the the the Discerning of thoughts and the intents of the heart what were you witnessing what was it revealing Christ and brother ROM says I don't come to declare unto you to say unto you he's coming but to declare he is here and you say brother Matt what did you witness you witnessed the supernatural on a scale that has never been seen from the days in the ministry of Jesus even when brother Bam's looking at St John you you know greater work shall you do uh you know for I go to my father brother says I always looked at that and thought greater you know must mean in terms of quantity and the amount of Miracles but the angel of the Lord showed him it was going to be a greater work that he' do in this generation to where the very power of creation would be exercised in a human vessel let me just tell you something friends and I'm just going to say this here tonight because I believe I got Liberty to say it that was Christ in Moses hello do you believe that it was Jesus in Moses and a shadow in a prefigure and when you accepted Moses you were accepting Christ it was Christ in Joshua it was Christ and all those Messengers it wasn't and when when you received the message of Jeremiah you were not receiving the message of Jeremiah it was actually Jehovah through the lips of a Vindicated Prophet that's right and brother brandom says and many people will say oh if I lived in the days of Jesus you know I would have defended him brother Joe I would have stood right there I wouldn't allowed those Roman if I had been back there in the days of Jesus I wouldn't have been in that crowd let me tell you what a prophet said what you do with your day and Christ for your day let me just say it what you do with this message tells me what you would have done for Jesus Christ back then it's no different friends it was Christ on display and I'm thankful for that I'm thankful for the miraculous I'm thankful for the sign of the son of man through the Discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart can I just say I'm thankful for all of that I believe brother Matt believes in all of the miraculous and I've seen cancer healed I've seen blind eyes come open I've seen deaf people I begin to hear again I believe in the Supernatural I believe in the miraculous I believe God's going to do more more and more and more of that but can I just say that I am just as much Desiring of the physical Miracles I'm just as much Desiring that the nature of my lamb the greatest miracle that can take place takes place in my soul yes sir and I believe that not only did you see the miraculous but I believe you seen the very nature of Jesus the humility the love even brother brand I was me and brother Tim were talking about it today and and just speaking of brother brandham there and I just was reading a quote on the plane right over here and brother brandham goes before his church and says you pray for me church he says I feel like there's been a critical spirit came over me and he says and It's haunting me now this was a man who could be transparent and he was looking at the things that were unb things in other men's Ministries that were not according to the Bible he was talking about a woman who was trying to you take people over an Indian and try to take their money and do some kind of gift and and brother Brandon was was being becoming critical of things that you would say you should be critical over and yet the prophet of God said you pray for me because if I get critical of that I'll lose my favor with God say brother Matt why was that because I believe it was the nature of the lamb and came back on the worshipper you say brother Matt what do you saying what I'm saying to you today is that the token must be on display and with it comes power and the miraculous and with it comes the supernatural but if we miss the character of the Lamb we've missed it all can I go on just a little bit further Siri thank you Jesus suffered mental anguish he knew what it was like to be misunderstood to be mocked his own disciples forsook him say brother Matt what was it doing it was bringing Brokenness but you know what Jesus never allowed it to do he never allowed his Brokenness to become bitterness he knew what it was like to be mocked ridiculed and finally they spit on him and then they murdered him and took his own life so valueless and the Bible says yet he opened not his mouth what was it he was reviled but he wouldn't revile back even the Apostle Paul had a great concern for Christians when they seen the sufferings in his own Ministry you can go look at Acts chapter n when when when Paul realizes that these Jews you know had believed that if God placed you if God called you if God was with you if God was pleased with you then you would always be blessed and you would never suffer and you would never go through you know what kind of hard things can I give tell you what a prophet said let me tell you what a prophet said the prophet said the Cloudy Skies hello that cloudy size and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and sunny days uh uh you know signs of his great approval or his love but the prophet says his approval for us is only in the Beloved the Jews couldn't understand this how could God love a man and yet he could go through this and the Apostle Paul understood this picked up on this and he begins to say in the book of Acts chapter 9 I'm not going to turn to it and and he tells them and ananas comes and prophesies right after his conversion and this is what anas's prophet prophecy was in Acts n over the life of the Apostle Paul I love this so much and he he says here in Acts chapter n he says for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and the children of Israel for I will show him I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake you know what happens reports of Paul's suffering goes all over and all of the suffering that Paul's getting beat he's getting lashed he's thrown into prison and the Apostle Paul realize this and and even some of those Jews you know so what did Paul do Paul said Timothy and Paul tells Timothy to the church at thessalonia you go read the book of Thessalonians and Paul says Forbe it this is this is 10 this is this is 1 Thessalonians 3 so that no man may be disturbed by these afflictions for you yourself know that we have been destined for this right destined this was his Destiny destined to suffer destined to Bear the name of Christ destined Paul says oh my for you yourselves know we have been so that no man is Disturbed for we have he says he says that we kept telling you in advance that we were going to S suffer Affliction and it came to pass as you know I desire that you faint not at my tribulations that's Ephesians 3 it's why Paul says think it not strange for fiery trials that are to try you they didn't understand it when it was job he said you know come on job come on brother you know come on man doesn't just go through these kind of things you lose your house you lose your family you lose your children come on job go ahead mess up buddy it's okay let me just tell you those freck friends are not friends those aren't friends come on job come on Fess it up you know what the problem was job didn't know job had no idea do you know you go read the book of Job and the Bible says that God never you'll never find that God takes job and he sits him down and says hey Job listen buddy I'm going to go ahead and lay it out to you real clear before it happens I want you to know job I'm about to take your house I'm about to take your kids about to take everything Joe about to give you boils it's not going to make any sense whatsoever your life is going good everything looks fine but it's about to get turned upside down job just so you know when I start doing these things I want you to understand have a clear conscience you ain't got to get excited it's me God you'll never find that in your Bible you see in this life most of the time you only get one side of the story and J only was living his everyday life living day by day by day day by day by day to serving the lord what he couldn't see was that in another dimension under the at the Throne of God there came a a conversation was taking place you see job's name come up in another dimension that he couldn't hear he couldn't see he couldn't communicate with and little did job know his name had came before his father's thror have you considered my servant job there's none like him a man who fearth God and asseth Evil for he was never sat down nobody ever told him no you see God doesn't tell you everything brother say God doesn't even tell His prophets everything that's right he just lets them go through life and on this side of life there was only one side of the story that job got never sat him down so when his friends come to him and say job what's happening you know what job could say honestly I don't know I don't know you imagine if anybody was turning over every stone it was job going through his life what have I done where have I went wrong what turn did I make what did I do wrong how did I go where did I go wrong in my life I don't understand I can't make sense of it and you go read some of the job in Job chapter 18 and job begins to get to a place let me tell you what began to happen to job is it wasn't making sense he knew he loved God he knew he served God he knew he lived for the Lord yet all of this pain was coming and all of this trouble was is coming and he gets to such a place to where for a while he weathers the storm and for a while he stays strong and for a while it all looks good and then after a while as that trial begins to wear on him and wear on him and wear on him TR finally gets to the place and he says God what it been better for me not to be born it had been better God you charged me as a as a as a as an enemy charges me what was it that bitterness begin to set into his life life because he's trying to make sense of what's happening what's happening in my life I don't understand what's going on why is this taking place what's happening you know many times friends we question those kind of things in our life if we'd be honest it doesn't always make sense if we'd be real honest and put down our angel wings and lay our halo aside for a moment we'd admit we don't always have have it all figured out and sometimes things happen that we don't have an answer to we don't know why and the devil begins to come in our life begins to attack us like a bombard us and job finally succumbs to some of that he says oh God has been better I not be born oh Lord job comes to some of the displac Andy in his and despondency in his life he says oh I go left and I don't see him I go right and he's not there I look up and I can't find him l i search beneath and he's not to be found what was Job saying Job saying I'm trying to see it I'm trying with everything that's within me I'm trying to make sense of it I'm looking left I'm looking right I'm trying to find somewhere the hand of God in all of this and job says oh if I just knew where he lived if I just knew his address I'd go to his house I'd knock on his door I know he would open the door and I know he would sit me down and I know if I just knew where he lived he'd speak kind words to me I know it would all make sense then all have you ever felt that way sometimes friends have you ever felt that way can I just be honest I felt that way many times in my life go through things in my life and don't understand stop making sense God what did I do where did I go wrong what happened in my life oh oh I felt many times in my life if I could just have a moment with the Lord I could just talk to him if I could just job says if I could just plead my case and tell him if I could just have a moment with you you know sometimes friends you go through things in your life and you don't realize that the very thing that God's doing in your life that you quit question and you wonder about and you reason over and sometimes God allows things that come into our life and you think it disqualifies you let me just say this friends and I'll be very transparent to you today I've preached a lot of sermons in my life and I've preached sermons and I thought you know oh boy that one right there was a really good one it's really going to have an impact because you know I Lord really I thought I'd seen something really good come on preachers you know what I'm talking you thought you'd seen something really good oh boy that that ties over here and ties with this and that RI and that over oh man when I get out there preaching that oh it's just going to oh it's going to have such an impact and all these things fit over here and and this over here and this lines up and oh my God it all put together but do you know that actually it wasn't those sermons that had the greatest impact and effect on lives of people but it was actually the most simplest things in my life when I was able to go through suffering and trials in my life life but I was able to come and be transparent before people and tell how God not only to not only how I went to it but how God brought me through it and it's been some of the what I would call the greatest failures of my life when I felt like it was all over that God somehow brought me through some of the darkest times it's been those sermons that have been the greatest uh weapon to tear the devil's Kingdom down you say brother M what are you saying I'm saying God wants to take those things that you've went through and if you will allow him to take you through some of the darkest places and don't become bitter and don't become upset and don't become callous but allow God to use it in your life it'll actually be the greatest weapons because sometimes the thing that you thought disqualifies you is actually what qualifies you for the job and sometimes the greatest credentials that you can hold is some of the failures and moments of what you thought was defeat I've watched people go through the very same trial and some get bitter and some get better and you could watch a family go through the exact same trial and one of them uses what God put them through to build and Def further the kingdom of God that's right and the other allows it to become to make them bitter and angry that's right you say what was the difference it wasn't the trial and it wasn't God it was what you did with your trial job what's happening I don't know what's going on God if I just had a moment with you if I could just knock on your door if I could just take a moment and job says oh if I I went left I went right and I can't perceive him but you know what job finally came to brother job job finally said I may not be able to see him I may not be able to find him but here's what I know he knows the way that I take in other words I may not be able to see God right now but here's what I know God can see me and job says and I may know listen friends there might have been only one side of the story let me just say this as I feel the inspiration of the Holy Ghost you may only get one side of the story on this life but there's coming a day there's coming a day where you'll get the other side of your story and it'll all make sense on the other side there will be no more questions hallu because job went his whole life you realize that you read the book of Job and many people think you know somewhere in job you know most people don't get past job 20 if they get past that they don't get past job 30 they just stop reading but keep going can I challenge you to go a little bit further in the Book of Job what you'll find is that God actually never sat him down in his life and said okay job now I'm going to tell you now I'm going to explain expl it to you job why you went through what you went through do you know you'll never find that in your Bible you'll find job goes his entire life to his grave and he finally gets to the place to where he's not making sense of any of it and you know what God actually tells him God brings him you go read it through job I don't have time and I'm not going to turn to it today but you go read and job God actually brings job and and and job's all just in a mess and his mind and God says job I want you to think about something here for a moment I want you to consider here's job and all of his distress here's job all messed up needs an answer and God finally says who is this that darkeneth the counsil of God stand up that I may talk to you like a man and God says job I want you to think about something and all of your questions and all of your wondering and all of your worry I want you to consider two animals this is amazing you might not have known this was in your Bible tonight you will God says I want you to think about the hippopotamus the the hippopotamus the Behemoth The Bible calls him he's like a prehistoric hippopotamus job says okay tell me about the hippopotamus and then God says after he tells him about the hippo now I want you to consider the crocodile the crocodile the leviathon the Bible calls him it's not just a crocodile like we got in South Carolina y got here in Louisiana an alligator brother Donny likes to call them crocodiles they're not they're alligators this is a leviathan this is a behemoth God says job consider Behemoth and I I don't want to turn I just quote you some of the things that God says consider him job because there's Fury in his breastplate there's power in his nostrils behold he draweth up the Nile with his tusks with his with his with his nose he maketh the crush his bones God just begins to describe the greatness of this great boohemoth and he says the power notice of this hippopotamus even today more people are killed by that animal than any animal in Africa a a creature that will just destroy you and Crush you and God says notice his strength is in his breastplate job and then God says now I want you to consider Leviathan he's a crocodile his teeth are this long behold he he he destroyeth The Cedars removes are the cedar trees with his tail and then God says job I got to qu question can you put a hook in his nose and make him obey you God actually goes further and says job can you speak kind words unto him talk sweet you know can you talk sweet enough and he'll follow you God says job I want to ask you can you make him and dress him up for a banquet this is in your Bible I know you're looking at me crazy it's in your Bible you might not known it neither did I till I read it can you dress him up like a child would dress up a toy can you dress up leviathon and put him to a banquet and talk sweet to him can you put a hook in his nose and make him obey you behold God says behold touch him job remember that battle you'll never forget it what is God saying God saying job I want you to understand that there are going to be monsters in your life life and if you try to wrestle with those questions they will destroy you job and if you try to reason it rationalize it why did this happen why did that happen why did God take them why did that why did this take place in my life God says job I want you to understand there's going to be monsters in your life that if you try to answer they will destroy you Jo but I want to give you a promise I can put a hook in leviathan's mouth I can make him obey him for I'm the creator of every problem and every trial and every tribulation you go through there is nothing that is not subject to my voice job you've got to let me fight your Monster job hallelujah what is God saying to job I'm the god of your monsters I'm the god of your questions I'm the God of all of your problems job and job never got to knock on God's door oh but one day God came knocking on job's door brother Bram dramatized it and said there was God as he knocked on paradise's door and Ezekiel stands and Abraham stands but here stands job what was it he went his whole life but now all of his questions and all of his long nights and all of his tears that he cried here he was and God says that's my redeemer that's him oh boy Siri says I have 55 seconds brother Tim can I go just five more minutes and if I go five past that that'll be okay too right give me extra Grace I just want to conclude this broken but not bitter you see it's the Bible actually says that a root of bitterness lest a root of bitterness spring up don't stop there because bitterness doesn't stop there because the scripture says less a root of bitterness come and defile many you see that bitterness doesn't just affect you it affects everything around you in fact in their life it would be notice brother brandom as he comes to this stage or this place in his life we could say and you know this story very well I just want to just read it to you here for a moment as brother Brandon preaches this message standing in the Gap and he begins to tell about this story this dream that about Fletcher Bry and and brother Roy is having this dream and and brother brandham says he gets this call from brother brother Roy and brother Roy's all in a mess he's thinking oh brother brandham oh I just I was screaming for you brother Bill come back brother Bill and he says we were sitting there notice this he says we were sitting there and he says and he said and he and I look like in Jerusalem at the Lord's communion table and I was talking he couldn't understand it brother Roy said him present looking at me now out in Arizona sent me a letter I called him back and said you were sitting there brother Bram and I saw that big pill of light come in and get you and take you away from the Lord's table and you went Westward cuz he was sitting on the east side watching me go west and this light come in and take it out now notice this dream brother Roy has here's brother brandham he's at the head of the communion table and then he sees that light that Pillar of Fire that you see in that picture brother bam says and he says I've seen that thing whirl in and grab you and take you brother bam out of the room he said said it was one morning like it was a vision two or three in the morning and he said I screamed look like for days brother Bill come back Roy and I been real brothers we lived to hunt together just brothers he screamed for me till he was horse in his throat come back bring him back bring him back here come that Pillar of Fire coming back or a cloud back and he set me at the head of the table notice and I had been changed it was a mystery to brother Roy me being changed to look different brother Adam takes a little sticky I think it is a little note and he writes on that note being changed and he says I'm going to take it I lay this up here for something I want to remember being changed when I give him the interpretation of it now many of you would think if you just had to guess my goodness there's the communion table he's looks like he's in Jerusalem and he's sitting there there's the pillar of fire he goes W he takes him and and Westward and you're thinking you know it's something ethereal there's something to do with some of the Mysteries and and and maybe it's about the Feast of the trumpets or about the Seven Seals or something God's going to reveal I want you to notice what this Vision actually meant when brother bham says you had been brother Roy says brother bham you had been changed so what changed in the vision at with brother brandham that took him from the Comm Union table and sat him back and put him at the head of the table brother bam says now I'm preaching to myself could we stand and see a human being that's blind physically blind and know that he's walking over a cliff could we in our sto state of mind that we're in this morning could we stand and see a blind man walk over a cliff blind and not try to warn him could you do that tonight friends a blind man hello anybody could you allow a blind man to walk over a cliff brother theom says and not warning it would be so cruel we would be so indifferent in our heart could you imagine a person getting so indifferent that he could almost laugh and see a blind man that cannot see and help himself deliberately walk over a cliff that would be bad a bad thing to do nothing about it what are my brethren R over I just want to make this confession and humbly say that just about what I was doing or fixing to do I've been preaching for years I'd become an old man an old veteran preacher and I had a lot of hard battles and maybe I'm scarred all CAU up on the inside from fights because my lot that the lord gave me was not to kiss the babies and marry the young and bury the old but it was to hold a two-handed sword at the Battlefront against the Ws of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness and fight it with the word of God till I seen the enemy defeated I been cut many times now I met a Christian this great country right under Alaska and I had made up in my mind that being I'd left here and going west that I would take my wife and kind of trap her into something now don't you guys get any ideas I was going to trap her into something I'd get her up there and become a God if the Lord wanted me to do something I let my hair grow out i' my whiskers i' go back there and be a god there's only about two three Indians live back there there just been a guide him help Bud and Lord wanted me to do anything then I'd say all right Lord it give me a vision I slip on out then i' being nervous I say this kind of quietly maybe erotically type of person I'm knowing that I was in insufficient at the beginning for the job oh my as many as complained that had to do was hard but I thought God why did you call somebody that could have done it he says the people just won't listen to me I failed to do what I should have done somewhere because they won't listen let's go on before leaving here I might drop this in and we'll hurry I Dreamed a funny dream and I dream hoping my brother gets a hold of this doesn't hurt his feelings I hope I don't hurt my wife who's sitting present now but she knows it many months ago around October November I dreamed that I was roaming out in the dark listen to this well I had no place to go and nobody cared for me and I'd become a bum just a bum and I was cold looked in the distance saw a fire when I got over there as was a city dump the ditches and the fire was in the ditches between the ditches with slick where bums would sleep to keep warm keep from freezing between the fires on a cold winter night and I was cold I walked from this fire to get warm it was laying full of bums didn't see anything them but they all had like stalls or places where they're sleeping I saw my brother-in-law F Fletcher Bry when I woke up Fletch said to me he said in the dream he said Billy I'll hunt you a place brother Bill you fed my children when they were hungry he said Daddy then I'll find you a place here to keep warm we went walking by the bums place and finally come to a place he said I'll sit down here and said I'll walk up here see if I could find a place I looked out into the dark cold night and I thought think of it think of it one time God Almighty let me lead his church one time he let me preach his gospel and see Soul saved men and women come from around the world to speak with me for a few moments and here I am I'm now a bum nobody wants me and I'm cold what must I do I told my wife maybe it means fleshes brother M's trying to figure this out and he says uh you know I'd preached for about 35 years in the last 15 to 18 years I've done nothing but just to the Lord I've tried to live so close to him not say a word till he told me first everything I come down from Canada Fred brother Roy told me his dream he and I Banks Road together just before we separated brother bandam says and if I I'll live back in the wilderness be his prophet he wants to send me somewhere he's not using me then you know I was sure to catch some fine fish and do some things of course that was kind of a self attitude because I wanted to do that it isn't exactly the thing to do no now I had made that up in notice my mind doesn't it say the Holy Spirit told him to do this it's amazing how many plans we concoct now notice he's not thinking of anything sinful he's not thinking about going to the living some life you know s separate second life going to the bar it's none of that all it is I want you to catch this is just a little detour this seems harmless brother Adam says you know i' made up in my mind to do that got up about 4:00 started driving Billy was sleeping went to a place I was thinking on you know what one of these days when just get a wife up here I won't tell her I'm going to do but I'd get up there and I'm going to tell her I love this place so well not of us no need of us going anywhere let's just stay here it's back from civilization 1100 miles from anywhere way in the wilderness I thought won't that be fine I won't have to get a haircut now don't you boys getting the ideas now I won't have to get a haircut I won't have to dress up I'll just be a regular Mountaineer what I always wanted to be I said got some guns and people give me and be a God Like You never heard of I'll just love it the Lord tells me to go down tells run out there and tell him come back again help Bud really we really have a real place brother says oh I was thinking on that it said carry out your plans carry out your plans and you'll be like that that bum I said Lord I don't want to be like that said your wife will go too she won't live up in them Hills like that and you'll become a bum just as the dream showed you you would I said I don't want to I I I I I I don't want to have to live like that I want to do something different I was told you to call me be a prophet I'll live in the winers like a prophet but I was using my own excuse so I can hump my own good I let the sick lay I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to that's wrong I built notice I had built myself a complex I want you to key in on this because you can build a complex doesn't just happen overnight but you feed that thing and you feed that thing and before you know it it's your reality because the people didn't hear my message and if God forbid I'll try to brother BR says try to compare myself to Moses but the people wouldn't listen to him to come to live him so he just left him alone with the wildness but God turned him around and these Ricky and retas that have so sassed the word I've called them Ricky and Retta God give me to understand I shouldn't do that because many of them are still as children they can't help because they act so different some of these cold formal churches got the spirit upon them there has got them that Spirit upon them there as much prison as Israel was in prison just as much as Moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that love Jesus Christ would serve him if they only knew what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism tells them don't do this and don't do that brother bham says oh he says notice this here underlined and I wanted to bring this to you listen to this I wanted to bring this to you so you would see and show you the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere just just a little detour just a little deviation not sin not to backslide just to check out from the pressure to step off make an alternate plan and that one detour would have wrecked his life I'm so glad that the grace of Jesus is greater than any human fry or fragility of the human mind I'm so glad that the grace of Jesus triumphs my stubbornness sometimes I'm so glad that the grace of Jesus overcomes me and he says Oh Brother Roy Moses lost the fing of the people because they wouldn't listen to him and brother Roy you see your dream I can't go with a Ministry like that notice until I feel different in my heart no matter if God did tell me but that is that change what was that change brother Matt just the feeling in his heart towards people God intended the Brokenness but he never sent the bitterness and brother bham had allowed that bitterness because people wouldn't listen to him to change his attitude and brother brandham says that's that change amazing that he's removed from the communion table but when his heart is changed he's put at the head of the table that is that change brother Roy something's got to change me I wonder if you'd be honest enough in your heart and I'll be honest tonight to raise my hand and resonate with these words and say something's got to change me oh friends listen you've got to be changed one day where our body's going to change you know what that'll be a result of you changing every day in this part of your soul that's right I could say something's got to change me in my heart brother bham says oh he says until I can get that feeling until I can get that feeling he says oh pray that God will place into my heart that something that I lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex it's so easy like job when you don't understand what's happening and it doesn't make sense it's so so powerful musicians could you come I'm going to close something so powerful I wish I had the illustration I could put up before you that I I seen and I I didn't have time to put it up but it's something that was so powerful and it speaks about what the what's in every living plant you take a tree you take a flower you take any kind of botney Life any nature something that's so powerful inside of that plan In The Presence of Jehovah if you could play that just softly something that's so powerful and I'm in no means any kind of a botnus or know anything about that kind of thing but do you know that there's something that makes every plant grow every single plant every living thing that you see it's something in a flower whether it's a tree or a bush it's something called a meristem tissue go look this up it's called meristem tissue Marist stem it's actually the same thing that we have called stem cells and a stem cell is what causes something to grow in your body do you realize that when that baby is born and it's and its life is in the mother the womb of that mother that as as the things as nutrients come into the body it's at the stem cell line that decisions are made made and it says that would make a good nose that would make good hair that would make a good ear that would make a good toe that would make this that's where it's it's all at and in a tree in botney life there's something called meristem tissue and what that is is inside of a plant everything that the plant is receiving and every L and every living plant all the nutrients don't know how it does it you this is just God in nature but everything that it receives and and you could look at if you a tree and you can see the knots I can actually point out that where that meristem tissue made a decision catch this please it made a choice because it received something might have been a fire that had went through might have been a flood might have been not enough Sun might have been put under some kind of thing that CS it you know didn't get enough water but a decision was made at that meristem line and the choice was either I'll grow up or I'll die and push down it's incredible when you look at this because it actually makes the choice in that tree it's where a decision a particular spot in that tree or that that flower it's it's you just say brother M what is it it's that decision that's made on what it's going to do with what it receives that's right listen friends it can't control what it receives but it's got a choice to make on what will you do with what you receive let me just say this in your life you will have a thousand chances to get angry you will have a thousand opportunities to get bitter you'll have a thousand chances to get upset you'll have a million opportunities to get revenge and get even and get back but you also have the choice to be identified with your lamb and you say you don't know what they did to me brother match you don't know what they said and when they said this and they said that you don't know what they were me all this is my opportunity to know you know what this is this is God orchestrated in the moment for you to exercise true power cuz true power is the power Jesus exercise when he can say father forgive them for they know not what they do true power is not to speak them out of existence true power is to look beyond what you see out externally and look at the heart that's lost and needs the Lord Jesus Oh friends I know this is such a simple message but it's just what the Lord told me to preach here tonight that tree has no ability to determine what it what it receives but it can make the choice on what it's going to do with what it gets do you know that in the body they have determined that actually cancer comes you take cancer any disease you want to name when an unidentified object comes in when an unidentified cell and when that stem cell doesn't identify what it's going to be and it just leaves it unidentified it can grow into into problems and let me tell you what the Bible says the Bible says that you're to take every thought you don't leave any thought just floating around in your mind but you take any thought that is contrary to this word and you bring it subject to the power of the Holy Ghost you don't unidentify anything you say God I might have went through it I might not understand it but your grace is sufficient for me Lord in my weakness that you are made strong as the Apostle Paul was told Paul will you take it from me I asked the Lord Thrice and brother ROM said God said no Paul I'm not going to take it but here's what your message is going to be my grace is sufficient for your Thorn Paul in other words my grace is enough you don't need anything else but my grace could you stand and close your eyes and bow your heads here with me all over the building it's not what's coming in it's not what you receive it's what you do with what you get you can choose to be better or you can choose to be bitter you can choose like Joseph who could look at his brothers and say what the enemy has meant for evil I choose I make a choice to let God use it for good in fact Joseph says to the saving to the Redemption you say brother Matt what are you saying I'm saying that God can take that thing that came in your life and if you will let God if you will let go and let God take it he can take that thing that Satan sent to destroy you and God can take it and use it as a weapon to tear the devil's Kingdom down in your life he can use it to give you a testimony that will shake the gates of hell it's all what you choose to do with your pain it's no question whether tribulation will come the Bible's clear you say brother Matt what do you believe that we're just all here in this life just going to suffer all have no friends that's not what I'm preaching to you as brother B was asked is tribulation coming for the bride is persecution no the next thing is the rapture for the bride but friends do you realize that that Christlike nature as our Prophet told us comes through human suffering and trial and you've got a choice you've got a choice Rachel as that baby was born and Rachel at her last dying breath as she's going to name that child her last dying breath as she goes out in suffering and anguish and she says his name shall be Boni which means the child of my sorrow but do you know want to know what happened a powerful thing happened in that moment because that child would have been raised as bonai and his name would have represented all of his mother's complexes and I would have passed down all of the mom's Pro problems and grief and and and and and and issues but a father named Jacob stepped in and said his name shall not be called bononi but his name Shall be Called Benjamin for Benjamin means the son of my right hand what was it at the moment he could have been named the he could have just continued the pain of the last generation but someone was going to come in and step in and say I choose to not pass down my pain and my grief and my trouble I choose today to say God I'm going to allow what you've sent to my life to bring victory and not defeat I'm going to allow what you've s in my life to push up and to cause growth and not stuned growth oh how many hands would go up and say Lord Jesus I accept it tonight accept it Lord Lord God I know father above all else I know Lord God that you had me go this direction tonight I I know you had a purpose Lord I pray God that the word would find its resting place in the heart of Faith to your children may we realize Lord God as Sons and Daughters of God that there's many crosses in this life but all the blessings far outweigh the crosses as David said forget not his benefits Lord oh the crosses are great but the blessings are many much more than all of the trials as Paul said the light suffering temporary momentary suffering of this life is not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us may we realize tonight Lord as Sons and Daughters of God that healing true healing doesn't just come Lord God as a one-time oneoff but God your desire is you said I come to to bind up I've torn but I'm going to heal I've I've ripped apart but I'm going to bind up and may the Holy Ghost come tonight Lord Jesus with healing in his wings I wonder I just feel the presence of the Lord now I wonder if there'd be somebody maybe you just want to identify and say Lord God I believe your word was speaking right to my heart and I want to I want to let you know Lord Jesus I'm sensitive enough to say God I've heard your voice I'm not going to I'm not going to allow that complex to be built I'm not going to allow layers to come and feed that thing but today Lord today I'm taking all of my bitterness and I'm letting it go I'm casting it out of my life I'm dropping it here oh God and I say tonight I'll go out not bitter Brokenness is what you you called called me to but not bitterness Lord let me realize I can lay it down I've got the power to lay it down Jesus God [Music] almightyy the Prince of Peace [Music] TR yes hearts are yes Lord Jesus in the oh let the Lord just minister [Music] sing it again now it's [Music] the yes Lord Jesus Gody all
