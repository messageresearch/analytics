[11:29] time together we ask it in Jesus name
[11:33] amen amen let's turn to Genesis
[11:36] 4 Amen in verse
[11:44] one says and Adam knew Eve's wife and
[11:47] she conceived and be Cain and said I've
[11:50] gotten a man from the Lord and she again
[11:53] bear his brother Abel and Abel was a
[11:56] keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of
[11:59] the the ground and in the process of
[12:01] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[12:04] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[12:06] unto the Lord and Abel he also brought
[12:08] of the firstlings of his flock and of
[12:11] the fat thereof and the Lord had respect
[12:14] un Abel and to his offering but unto
[12:17] Cain and to his offering he had not
[12:19] respect and Cain was very wroth and his
[12:22] countenance fell the Lord said unto Cain
[12:25] why art thou wroth and why is thy
[12:27] countenance Fallen if thou doest well
[12:30] shalt thou not be accepted and if thou
[12:33] doest not well sin lith at the door and
[12:36] unto thee shall be his desire and thou
[12:38] shalt rule over him and Cain talked with
[12:41] his Abel his brother and it came to pass
[12:44] when they were in the field that Cain
[12:46] rose up against Abel's brother and slew
[12:48] him and the Lord said unto Cain where is
[12:51] Abel thy brother and he said I know not
[12:54] am I My Brother's Keeper and he said
[12:56] what hast thou done the voice of thy
[12:59] brother's blood crith unto me from the
[13:02] ground amen we'll let you be seated this
[13:08] evening amen just kind of getting over a
[13:11] cold that I've had for few little bits
[13:14] and about sick of it amen amen but uh
[13:19] we're just going to give our body and
[13:21] our voice to the Lord tonight and allow
[13:24] him to do what he Wills with it I'd like
[13:27] to speak to you on faith in the blood
[13:31] amen Faith In The Blood we we read here
[13:34] about
[13:34] a very
[13:36] one wonderful passage in the scripture
[13:40] of how life began and how things begin
[13:43] to take place and of course we as
[13:45] message Believers been taught of the
[13:47] different uh Mysteries that's hidden
[13:49] hidden in this very verse but I just
[13:52] want to speak about the blood and and
[13:55] and the offerings that Cain and Abel G
[13:57] gave for just a few moments you know
[14:01] Cain as as we read is was just as
[14:04] religious as Abel was uh he he gave an
[14:08] offering amen matter of fact the
[14:10] scripture calls his name first and his
[14:12] offering is he came to give the offering
[14:15] but uh Cain offered an offering just the
[14:19] same as Abel offered and he built a a
[14:22] place just the same as Abel did Cain got
[14:25] down on his knees and cried out to God
[14:27] and worshiped just the same as Abel did
[14:31] uh Cain did not sacrifice of course the
[14:34] same as Abel did but cuz one came with
[14:37] an intellectual conception he brought
[14:39] the flowers and the fruit of the field
[14:42] and made his offering and his altar
[14:44] beautiful it was an intellectual thing
[14:47] and a but Abel by faith chose a lamb for
[14:50] it was blood amen it was blood that that
[14:54] God required and he drugg him to a rock
[14:57] and hammered his little throat into he
[14:59] bled to death and God said that's
[15:01] righteous AEL why because by Revelation
[15:04] he had by Revelation he brought his
[15:07] offering to the Lord not by intellectual
[15:10] conception but Cain wasn't an Infidel he
[15:13] wasn't an unbeliever he he believed in
[15:15] God he he was a Believer there was
[15:18] something there in his heart that wanted
[15:20] to believe he had a heart of belief
[15:22] inside of him he was religious he was a
[15:25] Believer he came up and built an altar
[15:27] he came to church on a Wednesday night
[15:29] just like Abel came to church on the
[15:31] Wednesday night amen he was religious
[15:33] but Cain's Faith was in the wrong thing
[15:37] Cain's Faith was in his ability Cain's
[15:39] Faith was in what he had done himself he
[15:42] had he had come he had tilled the ground
[15:45] he would learn how to grow vegetables
[15:47] how to grow flowers how to even uh
[15:50] bypass the curse as it were in some ways
[15:53] that God had put upon the Earth you know
[15:55] God had cursed the ground he had cursed
[15:57] the the soil he had cursed everything
[15:59] thing there but Cain by his intellectual
[16:01] abilities had learned on his own his own
[16:04] ways how to grow fruit and how how to Wi
[16:07] to plan and what not to plan in certain
[16:09] times and what to do at certain times
[16:11] and so here he came and he by his
[16:13] learning and his ability he made an
[16:15] offering unto the Lord but that was not
[16:18] what God wanted God does not want our
[16:20] abilities he wants he wants us amen he
[16:23] does not want uh what we have as as our
[16:26] intellectual conception but God wants us
[16:29] us upon the altar amen that's what
[16:30] brother Brandonwood said he said amen he
[16:32] said altars were not made for flowers or
[16:35] or pretty things altars were made for us
[16:37] to lay upon them and so but C but Abel
[16:40] by Revelation by faith offered unto God
[16:43] a more excellent sacrifice nothing clean
[16:46] about it as far as humanly speaking it
[16:48] looked very ugly it looked very dirty it
[16:50] looked very uh put off I don't know if
[16:53] you've ever participated in killing an
[16:56] animal but it's not really a wonderful
[16:58] thing to do we do it sometimes out of
[17:00] Necessities or out out of out out of out
[17:03] of eating H you know to eat or to do
[17:05] whatever amen but if you make a wrong
[17:07] shot or if you don't do something
[17:08] exactly right it ain't a pretty
[17:11] scene amen it's not it's something that
[17:13] tears at your heart if you got any heart
[17:15] inside of you amen I as we've probably
[17:19] spoke about it before but having a a
[17:21] farm you know and we would raise animals
[17:23] to sell but some of them we'd raise them
[17:26] for meat and so it was sometimes my my
[17:29] my my choice or Not by my choice but my
[17:32] lot to go and shoot the animal and
[17:34] listen I wanted to make sure I made a
[17:36] good shot I didn't want him Belling I
[17:38] didn't want him making a bunch of Racket
[17:39] and flopping all over the ground or
[17:41] blood flying everywhere I want him to
[17:43] take the shot fall down and that was it
[17:45] that's just the way it was but this was
[17:47] not what happened Abel brought his lamb
[17:50] and he brought it and he laid it there
[17:52] upon the altar now he didn't have a 22
[17:55] or or a nice rifle to put up to his head
[17:57] he had a little door old
[17:59] Rock Amen there a little Flint stone
[18:02] that he had laid there he had found and
[18:04] he laid this Altar and he this this lamb
[18:07] upon the Altar and he laid him there and
[18:09] he be to hack at his throat and and it
[18:12] wasn't pretty sight it was a very
[18:14] nauseous sight if you could look at it
[18:16] in the way if I could paint a good
[18:18] enough picture for you tonight it wasn't
[18:20] Hollywood it was something that was real
[18:22] it was a animal laying there and it was
[18:24] screaming for its life and it was
[18:26] Belling out and God looked at this and
[18:29] said this is righteous Abel now
[18:32] according to the world that would be
[18:34] animal cruelty that would be all kinds
[18:36] of other things but God knew that it was
[18:38] blood that took them out of the out of
[18:41] the Garden of Eden it was going to take
[18:43] a greater blood to bring them back into
[18:45] the Garden of Eden and this is where
[18:47] Abel was and it was a bleeding and dying
[18:50] it was a horrible sight amen but God was
[18:53] very pleased with it you excuse me got
[18:58] this stuff in my broke amen so but he
[19:00] offered he offered this this sacrifice
[19:04] and and what was it it was by Revelation
[19:06] he seen that God required blood and and
[19:10] God required something more than our own
[19:12] abilities or our own understanding
[19:14] listen amen when you come to the house
[19:16] of God God wants more than your
[19:18] abilities he wants more than what you
[19:20] have done or what you can do sometimes
[19:22] you don't feel like doing anything
[19:24] you're just right God doesn't want what
[19:26] you can do anyhow he wants what he is
[19:28] already done Amen to be manifested in
[19:31] your
[19:32] life but Cain knelt down and he
[19:35] worshiped God he you know he had a
[19:37] membership he had an altar he had a
[19:39] sacrifice he worshiped God if God only
[19:41] requires you to go to church to be a
[19:43] believer and put your name on the book
[19:45] and pay tithes and worship God Cain was
[19:48] just as just as Abel was and God should
[19:51] be condemned for condemning Cain if
[19:54] that's the case amen but God required
[19:56] more God required blood
[19:59] God required life amen to be laid upon
[20:02] the altar God requires more than our
[20:05] works he requires more than just our
[20:07] lifting of hands out of a d you know we
[20:09] we don't we don't lift our hands out of
[20:11] a out of a Duty it ought to be out of
[20:13] worship unto God we don't come to church
[20:16] because it's just our Christian Duty we
[20:18] ought to come to church because it's out
[20:19] of a life laying our life down upon the
[20:22] altar to worship God Amen if God only
[20:26] requires you to do these things then
[20:28] Cain was just as just but God requires
[20:31] more see Revelation faith is not what he
[20:34] had done but faith in what the blood
[20:36] could do that's what we have to have is
[20:39] faith in what the blood can do and here
[20:41] he comes with this little lamb he had
[20:43] picked out of the flock and he had a
[20:45] grap Vine around his neck and and you
[20:47] know you know well H how how could he
[20:49] how could he do this how could he put
[20:51] him on the alter how could he hack at
[20:53] his throat how could he watch all that
[20:55] happen it was by Revelation knowing that
[20:58] 2,000 years later there was going to be
[21:01] another lamb led to an altar there you
[21:03] go and that blood was going to be shed
[21:06] and that blood was going to be spilled
[21:08] upon the ground amen it was by
[21:10] Revelation Here Comes him with this lamb
[21:13] you know maybe it was a some type of
[21:15] rock and he throws him back his neck
[21:17] back and he begins to hack at this neck
[21:20] and blood begins to sply and blood
[21:22] begins to squirt out and it begin to get
[21:24] all over the Altar and all over Abel and
[21:27] all over everything that was around them
[21:29] amen listen when Cain brought his fruits
[21:32] and he brought of his abilities and what
[21:34] he had done it was so beautiful it was
[21:37] so wonderful it looks so great just like
[21:39] churches today they look so beautiful
[21:42] they look so
[21:43] wonderful listen we want to be more than
[21:46] just a beautiful church we want to be
[21:48] more than just a beautiful people that
[21:51] sits on beautiful pews and has a
[21:53] beautiful sound to our singing but we
[21:55] want blood in our worship that's right
[21:58] we want the the spirit of God moving
[22:00] through our
[22:03] lives but here he
[22:05] comes Cain just glorifying God in his
[22:09] Beauty look what I've done Lord you know
[22:11] my heart but look what I've
[22:14] done I'm here giving you praise I'm
[22:17] doing this and I'm doing
[22:19] that look what I've done and Abel took
[22:23] the lamb and he throws it back like that
[22:26] and he gets a rock in his hand and
[22:27] begins to chop top at his little
[22:30] throat if a man's ever heard a lamb die
[22:33] bleeding
[22:34] bleeding I can see Abel's hands become
[22:37] bloody I see the white wool hanging on
[22:40] that little lamb bloody and God looked
[22:42] down and said that's it you got it
[22:46] that's it you got it what did it speak
[22:48] of of some 19900 years later the Lamb of
[22:52] God that would be lay down a road down
[22:55] to gol gotha and they would beat his
[22:57] body until was almost unrecognizable
[23:00] they would nail him through with nails
[23:02] and his hands and his feet and he would
[23:04] be stuck there between heavens and earth
[23:06] oh the Rock of Ages cried out in an
[23:09] unknown tongue Eli Eli the lamb was
[23:13] speaking in an unknown tongue to who to
[23:15] the
[23:17] sacrificer here he was speaking out to
[23:19] the sacrificer here there's bleeding out
[23:22] who to who to
[23:24] Abel the blood was speaking out and here
[23:28] he comes 2,000 years ago and he begins
[23:31] to speak out in unknown tongues what was
[23:33] it again the blood that was speaking out
[23:36] amen God's provided sacrifice there was
[23:39] Faith there's the faith that was once
[23:42] delivered to the church amen the blood
[23:44] of the Lamb of God that was slain before
[23:47] the foundation of the world now bleeding
[23:50] out now crying out now speaking out and
[23:53] saying it's finished yes
[23:56] sir it is finished it is over with I
[24:00] have waited for this
[24:01] moment and here I am hanging Between
[24:04] Heaven and Earth amen and my blood is
[24:07] coming down my body and is falling down
[24:09] upon the ground what was it it was the
[24:12] life of God being poured out upon the
[24:14] Earth so he can redeem the Earth from
[24:16] the curse yes sir and so he can release
[24:20] a spirit of God to come inside of you
[24:23] Amen to release you from the curse of
[24:25] your
[24:25] Earth amen that you could be set free
[24:28] tonight to rise above sin and to rise
[24:31] above sickness and to rise above
[24:34] depression and every kind of other
[24:36] thing
[24:38] amen we can see this blood as it would
[24:40] begin to be required all the way down
[24:43] through time all the way down through
[24:46] the from Genesis all the way down there
[24:48] was sacrifices that had to be made there
[24:50] was things that had to be done and we
[24:52] can look in we can look into Egypt as as
[24:55] it would type be a type of us in the
[24:57] first Exodus and now we are in the last
[24:59] Exodus and there was all in that time
[25:02] there was a requirement for
[25:05] blood amen there was a requirement for

[27:27] to die
[27:29] amen he had had the pressure upon Him
[27:31] amen but what but the father amen he
[27:33] knew I studied what the prophet said i'
[27:36] done what he said do and and you go out
[27:39] there and you just look on that doorpost
[27:41] I can promise you I applied it like he
[27:44] said

[27:47] said eat it we're going to cook it like
[27:49] he said cook
[27:52] it come on is there any other fathers
[27:54] that can say the same thing tonight I
[27:56] study what the prophet said yeah there's
[28:00] a death angel that's going through the
[28:01] land again amen but I've studied what he
[28:04] said and I've seen what he's he's
[28:07] required in this age for me to
[28:12] do had to be a lot of faith in a few
[28:15] Stripes over a
[28:18] door had to be a lot of faith to do what
[28:21] he said
[28:22] do I mean what if what if they didn't I
[28:25] mean they could have had a pile a bucket
[28:27] they could could have killed the lamb
[28:29] and they could have put all the blood in
[28:30] a bucket and had it sitting inside the
[28:33] door it wouldn't have done a bit of
[28:36] good it it it had to be applied it had
[28:40] to be done exactly as a prophet said to
[28:42] you had to have faith and he said this
[28:44] little boy well he goes down the window
[28:46] he looks out daddy you know that little
[28:47] Egyptian boy I played with there's two
[28:49] black wings hanging over his home
[28:52] there's his mother in the street she's
[28:53] screaming my baby's dead my first born
[28:56] and he grabs his daddy daddy don't you
[28:58] care for me don't you know that I'm your
[29:00] first born he said I can see that father
[29:03] just as calmly take his little boy by
[29:05] the hand and walk him over to the door
[29:07] and say son you see that blood you see
[29:10] that blood that's on the lle you see
[29:12] that blood that's on the door but daddy
[29:14] what's that got to do with it son that's
[29:17] God's
[29:19] promise he said just get all get all the
[29:21] pressure away from you cuz he said when
[29:23] I see the blood I'm going to pass over
[29:26] you that's God 's promise so those wings
[29:29] that you see there won't come inside of
[29:31] here that little boy goes to the window
[29:33] again and says daddy here he comes but
[29:35] the father was just a busy with
[29:37] something else he wasn't even worried
[29:38] about it why cuz he had done what the
[29:41] prophet had instructed to do and the
[29:43] angel moved towards the door but when he
[29:46] saw the
[29:47] blood when he saw that the price had
[29:50] already been paid he passed right by
[29:54] that house
[29:58] Hallelujah let's just read about it in
[30:00] Exodus 12 and verse 13 and the blood
[30:03] shall be for you a token upon the house
[30:06] where you are and when I see the blood I
[30:09] will pass over you and the plague shall
[30:12] not be upon you to destroy you when I
[30:14] smite the land of
[30:16] Egypt so there was a promise given when
[30:19] I see the blood I will pass over you I
[30:24] won't take your
[30:25] life brother Brandon brings it right
[30:27] into the today says here we are now
[30:30] living in those
[30:32] shadows and the Wrath is ready to
[30:37] strike and God is requiring something of
[30:41] us it's a
[30:44] token come on now it ain't literally
[30:48] going and killing now killing an animal
[30:50] and finding you know a good sheep or a
[30:52] good goat somewhere and and killing it
[30:55] and doing all these things and getting
[30:57] the hiss up which is Faith and applying
[31:00] it that's not literally anymore but it's
[31:02] still
[31:04] happening amen because why we're not
[31:07] we're not depending upon the blood of
[31:08] sheeps and goats anymore we're depending
[31:11] upon the blood of Jesus Christ but that
[31:14] g blood of Jesus Christ you can speak
[31:16] about it you can talk about it you can
[31:18] think about it you can look upon it amen
[31:20] you can have a little uh vile of it
[31:23] sitting in your closet but unless it's
[31:25] applied to your life that's it
[31:29] unless it's put by faith over the
[31:31] doorpost of your heart that's right then
[31:34] the death angel has a right to
[31:40] you come on
[31:42] now see the animal life in that day
[31:45] could not return back it couldn't come
[31:47] back the blood had to be placed over the
[31:49] door upon the lentil so they couldn't
[31:51] literally they wasn't putting it up
[31:53] their heart because that's not the kind
[31:55] of blood that they dealt with in that
[31:56] day it had to be put over the lentil up
[31:59] on the post and every passor by the
[32:01] whole public everybody coming by the
[32:03] house knew there was a sign on that
[32:06] door come on it's still supposed to be
[32:10] happening today there ought to be enough
[32:12] blood applied to your life it doesn't
[32:14] take very many qu questions to know if
[32:17] you're a Christian or
[32:19] not amen there ought to be a sign over
[32:22] here that blood has been
[32:26] applied this is what happened when they
[32:28] went into into the promised land and
[32:30] there was a there was a harot there by
[32:32] the name of Rahab and she had a sign
[32:34] over her door that she was a
[32:37] harlot come on and they came to her to
[32:40] find refuge and they came there and they
[32:42] she hid them and she said look I've
[32:44] heard about your god I've heard about
[32:47] what's been done I've heard about what
[32:49] happened at the Red Sea and I'm telling
[32:51] you everybody around here scared to
[32:53] death of your God they said well I tell
[32:55] you what since you have done this for us
[32:57] you take take that scarlet cord that you
[32:59] let us down with and you hang it from
[33:01] your door yes from your window and and
[33:04] you bring everybody you can inside of
[33:06] your house you and your house will be
[33:09] saved what was it it was a changing of
[33:11] the
[33:12] sign yeah come on somebody one day she
[33:16] had a sign of a heart and the next day
[33:18] she had the sign of the blood hanging
[33:20] over her
[33:22] body amen this is what you have to have
[33:24] in this time you might one day had a
[33:26] sign of somebody was under fear or under
[33:29] anxiety or under some devil of hell but
[33:32] I'm telling you there's a blood that can
[33:34] be applied to your
[33:37] life and we can have faith in that
[33:42] blood and all of a sudden one day it
[33:45] came to pass that everything around her
[33:47] was shaking and falling down at the
[33:50] sound of the
[33:52] Gospel Hallelujah but there was a
[33:55] bloodline there was something hanging
[33:57] from her window that kept her safe
[34:00] during the time of
[34:01] turmoil come on somebody if you apply
[34:05] that same blood to your life everything
[34:07] around you might be shaking everything
[34:09] around you might be falling down but you
[34:12] will
[34:13] [Applause]
[34:15] remain cuz there's a blood there's a
[34:19] token it's a life of the lamb now when
[34:22] this lamb of our lamb when he died now
[34:25] that life can come back upon the
[34:28] believer we believe
[34:31] that you say well I got the token you in
[34:34] pornography you do not have the
[34:38] token well I just ask for forgiveness
[34:41] well you're just living in a Justified
[34:43] State maybe a Sanctified state for a
[34:45] little
[34:46] while come
[34:47] on but if you got the token that means
[34:51] your sign done
[34:54] changed come on now you ain't no more in
[34:58] pornography you ain't no more Harlot no
[35:01] sir we go come on you ain't no more in
[35:04] sin and iniquity oh you might make
[35:07] mistakes yes you have this Humanity
[35:09] absolutely but you will not practice
[35:11] sin it will not be in your practice to
[35:14] sin and to do things wrong
[35:18] right it'll be a blood over your
[35:22] life it was a show as a show that shed
[35:25] blood of the Lamb the life of the Lamb
[35:28] has returned back that's what me filled
[35:31] with the Holy Ghost means means the
[35:33] blood's been applied to your
[35:35] life amen the animal life you know
[35:38] couldn't come back on the believer
[35:41] because it was an animal it only spoke
[35:43] of a conscious showing that there was to
[35:45] come a perfect
[35:47] sacrifice but it was not a perfect
[35:49] sacrifice it can only cover
[35:52] sin we we we're we're Believers we're me
[35:55] mess students I know we know this
[35:58] amen but that blood can only cover sin
[36:01] the sin was still
[36:05] there and then then then the spirit of
[36:08] God could Ascend on somebody but then it
[36:10] would descend it go back up and descend
[36:12] and go back up like David amen as he
[36:15] would have it get under the anointing of
[36:16] the Holy Ghost go out there and slow
[36:19] slay all kind of Philistines Giants and
[36:21] everything else and then go commit
[36:24] adultery come on that's somebody hasn't
[36:27] been converted he could not be converted
[36:30] during that time he could not be filled
[36:31] with the Holy
[36:32] Ghost not inside of his life he could
[36:35] have a blood he could offer a sacrifice
[36:38] and it would cover his sin but it could
[36:40] not annihilate that sin it couldn't do
[36:42] nothing about that sin that sin's nature
[36:45] was still on the inside of him but there
[36:48] came a perfect
[36:49] sacrifice that's the difference we are
[36:52] not living under the blood of bulls and
[36:55] goats so we're not in to practicing of
[36:58] just covering sin and still living with
[37:01] sin we're not just covering adulteries
[37:03] or covering pornography or covering this
[37:06] or covering that no we have a blood and
[37:08] we have faith in that blood that that
[37:10] life can now come inside of a Believer
[37:13] and not just cover it but annihilate
[37:16] [Applause]
[37:23] it so animal life could not come back
[37:26] because it was an animal
[37:28] but how could there be a more perfect
[37:31] sacrifice than God
[37:35] himself becoming the atonement when God
[37:38] was made flesh in his own creative
[37:42] blood the only way the life of God could
[37:45] ever come back because all of us was
[37:46] born by sex every last one of us
[37:49] therefore the life that was in there of
[37:51] is of the world and that life will not
[37:55] stand it's the thing that's already
[37:57] judged and condemn you can't patch it up
[37:59] there's no way to patch it up you can't
[38:01] patch this old life
[38:03] up that's what problem is too many
[38:05] believers they patch too many things
[38:09] up there's no way to smooth it all out
[38:11] there's no way to make it better this
[38:13] life has to
[38:16] die amen it has to die that's the only
[38:18] requirement there is that's why it's not
[38:21] about bringing your
[38:23] fruit it's about bringing
[38:26] yourself and lay yourself upon the altar
[38:29] it's no more about bringing a lamb and
[38:31] putting him there it's about you coming
[38:33] and laying yourself upon the Altar and
[38:35] saying God take me out I not my will but
[38:38] thy will be
[38:40] done it's got to
[38:43] die so the life of Jesus Christ can come
[38:46] into you which is the Holy
[38:49] Ghost God's token that you have accepted
[38:53] the blood of his son Jesus Christ that's
[38:55] the only way that you can say you've
[38:58] you've you've accepted his blood is you
[39:01] have the Holy
[39:03] Ghost well I I accepted this message is
[39:06] truth you you can do that the devil
[39:08] believes and
[39:10] trembles well I I I accept that it's a
[39:13] good thing to go to church the devil
[39:14] goes to church
[39:16] too matter of fact he's more faithful
[39:19] than most of
[39:20] us he never
[39:24] misses we can have all these things
[39:27] right
[39:28] but if we're not careful we're not
[39:29] nothing but a bunch of cans or bunch of
[39:32] righteous
[39:34] Pharisees come on we're all built up in
[39:37] our righteousness of how we got the
[39:39] message we got the truth we got this we
[39:41] got that but meanwhile our hearts are
[39:45] full of every Darkness our Spirits are
[39:48] full of every kind of unclean
[39:52] thing amen it's is we're we're in the
[39:55] moments of the death angel
[39:59] coming come on we're in the Third
[40:02] Exodus everything parallels through
[40:05] every Exodus there's a prophet there's
[40:07] an
[40:09] angel there's a killing of children
[40:12] check check
[40:13] check amen there's blood check check
[40:17] check come on Amen there's all of these
[40:20] things these parallels amen through
[40:23] every every Exodus there's the death
[40:26] angel
[40:28] that comes in and requires a life
[40:34] right and he's coming again in this
[40:38] hour and we got to make
[40:42] sure that we have the
[40:45] blood it ain't the blood if you got

[41:14] Angel is coming but there had to come a
[41:17] body of our Lord Jesus Christ That Could
[41:20] Break Forth water blood and spirit so
[41:22] the whole church the bride amen has been
[41:25] again brought through justification and
[41:27] sanctification and the baptism of the

[43:06] that the Holy Ghost is upon you without
[43:08] it then you will not
[43:13] raise amen it takes the
[43:15] blood amen remember Israel came through
[43:18] many things but it was at the evening
[43:20] time when the token was required not in
[43:22] the morning not in the preparation of
[43:24] the 14 days of keeping of the Lamb
[43:25] Israel knew something was coming he said
[43:28] so did Luther so did Wesley so did finny
[43:30] so did KNX so did Calvary they knew
[43:32] there was coming a time that the pillar
[43:34] of fire would return back to the church
[43:36] again they knew there would come a time
[43:38] when these things would happen but they
[43:40] didn't live to see it but they were
[43:41] looking forward to it Israel knew
[43:44] something was coming but it was in the
[43:46] evening
[43:47] time in the evening time it shall be
[43:50] light it was in the evening time that
[43:52] the Lamb's blood the token was placed
[43:54] upon the door
[43:57] it's been the lamb all the way through
[43:59] it'll be the lamb all the way to the
[44:02] [Music]
[44:04] end the very Spirit itself is the token
[44:08] the Holy Spirit the blood has been
[44:11] applied to my life to where it's not me
[44:14] that liveth but he that liveth on the
[44:17] inside of me you see inside the blood
[44:19] cell was a
[44:22] life it wasn't if it wasn't the
[44:25] chemistry had no life in it self
[44:27] therefore it could not it could not move
[44:29] but the life came from the chemistry of
[44:31] the blood it formed a cell and it Formed
[44:33] its own cell and then cell upon cell as
[44:37] God would create himself a blood cell
[44:39] and place it inside of an
[44:42] incubator that's all Mary was his blood
[44:46] didn't come from Mary and it didn't come
[44:47] from Joseph it came from God otherwise
[44:51] we have limited
[44:53] Blood come on we have limited blood but
[44:56] it came from from God so they could be a
[44:58] token amen so it could be a greater
[45:00] blood greater than the blood that took
[45:03] them out of the Garden of Eden right
[45:06] amen it was blood through sexual
[45:08] transmission that brought them out of
[45:11] the
[45:12] garden so he would have to bypass that
[45:15] amen bring it by his creative power the
[45:18] spoken word of God be it unto me
[45:20] according Thy word and the blood cell
[45:23] was formed inside of a womb
[45:27] God's creative power
[45:31] yeah his
[45:33] death brought forth this Blood upon the
[45:36] Earth and upon the and released a
[45:40] life amen it wasn't just a brother
[45:43] really bringing us down he's trying to
[45:45] show you it wasn't just a limited blood
[45:47] no not even Limited in the third person
[45:49] of the
[45:51] Trinity yeah this what he says he said
[45:54] it wasn't just in the third person of
[45:56] the trinity
[45:57] but the same
[46:00] person the person amen the Holy Ghost
[46:04] who would come back and continue the
[46:07] work and continues on said in the book
[46:09] of Acts it is Jesus Christ the same
[46:11] yesterday today and forever that token
[46:13] that is the
[46:15] sign and we must have it upon our hearts
[46:18] we must have it Upon Our Lives we must
[46:21] have it in our hearts and our beings
[46:24] permeating throughout us saying the
[46:26] blood has been applied to this
[46:35] life and when that token is on
[46:38] display and then when when that is done
[46:42] when that blood has been
[46:44] transferred from his life into your life
[46:48] then the same qualities
[46:50] or power that was in that original blood
[46:53] is now inside of
[46:55] you there's where he came to Peter and
[46:58] when he came to the gate called
[46:59] Beautiful notice how it changed Peter
[47:02] amen was a denier he was all kinds of
[47:04] things he he said he said some bad
[47:06] things he done some bad things he
[47:08] actually quit and he went back
[47:11] fishing but that was pre Holy
[47:16] Ghost I always use this sometimes just
[47:19] to kind of be funny I said sometimes you
[47:21] know Peter he was such a guy he just
[47:22] pulled a sword and whack whack an ear
[47:24] off but really he wasn't aiming at the
[47:26] ear I don't
[47:28] believe I you know sometimes you say
[47:30] well you just got to swing The Sword and
[47:32] Let Jesus put it back together but you
[47:34] got to remember that's pre Holy
[47:37] Ghost come on somebody we're good about
[47:40] swinging the
[47:43] sword saying things doing things but if
[47:46] you ain't careful you realize hey I
[47:47] ain't got what I thought I
[47:49] had amen but here he is now after the
[47:53] Holy Ghost came upon him and he's on the
[47:55] way to the gate called Beautiful and
[47:57] here's a blind there's a lame man laying
[47:59] there begging of
[48:00] arms now Peter didn't no longer he did
[48:03] he didn't say well let me go find Jesus
[48:05] and Jesus wasn't there no more he didn't
[48:07] go let me pray he just said such as I
[48:10] have give I unto thee what he knew was
[48:14] the token or the life that was in Jesus
[48:16] Christ has now been transferred to the
[48:19] believer that's right and now he's
[48:22] walking in the power the same Authority
[48:24] the same realm that Jesus walked walk in
[48:27] why cuz the blood had been applied to
[48:30] his
[48:31] life and it had the same effects yes
[48:37] sir is is why you would say not I will
[48:40] but you say to this mountain that's
[48:43] right you will say to this mountain be
[48:45] thou removed why because he knows that
[48:48] when that token that blood transfusion
[48:50] is taking place and the life of that
[48:53] blood comes into a Believer then the
[48:55] same quantities or the same power the
[48:57] same life is now living through them
[49:00] orchestrating and doing what he demands
[49:02] and what his word
[49:08] declares he would go on the tokens are
[49:12] wonderful probably ought to listen to it
[49:15] every chance you
[49:17] get me one of the Premier messages
[49:20] brother Brown said he would preach he
[49:23] would call a highlight of his
[49:25] ministry the token
[49:27] why because he knew it was going to be
[49:29] important to have it to leave here
[49:33] without it you're not leaving I don't
[49:35] care how long you sit on these pews I
[49:37] don't care how long you believe the
[49:39] message I don't care how long you said
[49:41] brother Brown's a prophit I don't care
[49:43] how long you did any of those things if
[49:45] you don't have the token the life of
[49:47] Jesus Christ on the inside of
[49:52] you come on now it ain't no more a
[49:55] father who can apply it to a build house
[49:57] and he brings everybody under this house
[49:59] and it's going to everybody's going to
[50:00] be okay you're under this house you're
[50:02] under this place no it's under your
[50:05] house he brings it down to the
[50:07] individual has the blood been applied to
[50:10] your life has it been applied to your
[50:12] heart to
[50:18] you when it is he said it is your you
[50:22] are gone you are no more that's pretty
[50:25] that's pretty strong
[50:27] you are no more you reckon yourself
[50:30] dead and the token is what now lives on
[50:34] you is not your life it's his life Paul
[50:38] said the life that I now live he lived a
[50:41] different life than what he once
[50:44] did yes come on that's right we can see
[50:47] it all through the Bible through the New
[50:49] Testament Peter lived a different life
[50:51] than what he first
[50:52] did even when he was walking physically
[50:55] with Jesus
[50:58] he lived a different life than what he
[51:00] first lived Paul lived a different life
[51:03] than what he first lived somehow people
[51:06] get the idea that they can be a message
[51:08] believer filled with the Holy Ghost and
[51:10] still live the same old life you cannot
[51:13] do
[51:14] it it's more about than just reformation
[51:18] and reforming and be being a good
[51:20] citizen and being a good person if you
[51:22] want to be that go be a
[51:24] Baptist go go find to go find a church
[51:27] that believes that it's more than that
[51:30] it's a life has to be changed there has
[51:32] to be a transfusion of your life and
[51:35] your life die and the life of Jesus
[51:38] Christ come on the inside of
[51:44] you but when it
[51:47] does you yourself is
[51:51] gone so what he says you reckon yourself
[51:54] dead it's not me that cry but Christ
[51:56] that liveth on the inside of me there is
[51:58] the identified token that God required
[52:01] our identification the life of our
[52:03] savior in us the Holy Spirit oh what a
[52:06] positive token there cannot be any other

[54:09] we're talking about people that make
[54:10] mistakes and we're talking about people
[54:12] that that do wrong decisions and make
[54:14] wrong decisions and I ain't sitting

[54:17] it hope I PID my
[54:19] ticket hope it's all hope hope I got the
[54:22] funds here I hope I'm going to be to get

[55:07] happen how's this going to work out quit
[55:09] worried about

[55:13] that's all that matters cuz when it's
[55:16] time for this ship to leave here it's
[55:18] going to leave that's right and you can
[55:21] line every devil up in hell and it'll
[55:23] never stop it from lifting off the
[55:25] ground
[55:31] makes you
[55:33] relaxed when you have had that spirit of
[55:37] God come on the inside of you and you
[55:39] realize it ain't no more you living but
[55:41] it's him that's living in
[55:43] you he says what if you had committed a
[55:47] crime and you're going to be tried at
[55:49] federal court and you knew that if you
[55:51] was found guilty you're going to
[55:53] die you're going to electric chair a gas
[55:56] chamber public
[55:58] execution maybe hung or something Lynch
[56:01] whatever the penalty was you knew you
[56:03] were guilty you knew you were guilty and
[56:06] you must die but if you didn't get some
[56:08] eternity to represent you who could get
[56:10] you out of the thing now you want the
[56:12] best attorney you could have and you
[56:14] getting that attorney was good shrew
[56:16] attorney you'd feel that your case was
[56:17] maybe maybe you a little in your favor
[56:20] you could relax a little bit because you
[56:21] had an attorney but still there would be
[56:23] a question whether this attorney would
[56:26] better change the judge's mind or change
[56:28] the jury's idea if this attorney was
[56:31] enough shrew enough and and knowing the
[56:33] laws that would change that and would
[56:35] plead your case and prove that so you
[56:37] could live but yet in all of his great
[56:39] Authority and great speech he can make
[56:41] and the impression he can put on the
[56:42] judge or the jury you may be in your
[56:44] mind you could maybe relax but there'
[56:46] still be a question right can he do
[56:50] it can he do it but in this case

[1:04:52] issue handed down through your
[1:04:54] generational
[1:04:56] curses there's enough blood when a man
[1:05:00] sinned he separated himself from God and
[1:05:03] he crossed a great
[1:05:05] Chasm and he put himself in death on the
[1:05:09] wrong side and there was no way
[1:05:13] back there was no way for him to get
[1:05:16] back but God accepted a substitute a
[1:05:19] lamb a goat a sheep or something with
[1:05:22] blood
[1:05:27] when he crossed he separated himself
[1:05:30] from his
[1:05:31] sunship he was a sinner by Nature he was
[1:05:34] under the hands and Dominion of
[1:05:36] Satan God took a sacrifice of blood the
[1:05:41] blood of bulls and goats it did not
[1:05:42] divorce sin but it covered
[1:05:45] it if I got a red spot on my hand here
[1:05:48] tonight covered it with white white that
[1:05:51] red spot would still be there it's still
[1:05:55] there but God sent down from heaven a
[1:05:58] bleach a
[1:06:00] bleach it don't just cover sin but when
[1:06:03] one sin is dropped into that bleach try
[1:06:06] to find it
[1:06:07] again the coloring of sin goes back down
[1:06:10] through the mediators down to the time
[1:06:13] back to the accuser Satan himself and
[1:06:16] lays on him till the
[1:06:22] Judgment where are your sins tonight
[1:06:24] Church oh if you've asked God to forgive
[1:06:27] you of your sins where are they at
[1:06:29] they're laying on Satan that's
[1:06:32] right that's why he remembers them so
[1:06:36] well cuz they're always on him they're
[1:06:39] always tormenting him and he wants to
[1:06:42] come and say you did this and you did
[1:06:43] this what sins are you talking about
[1:06:47] yeah oh you're talking about your sins
[1:06:49] they're on
[1:06:50] you you're the one that did this you're
[1:06:53] the one that caused this you're the one
[1:06:55] that brought this here in the first
[1:06:56] place they made back on
[1:07:00] you and what happens to the son he
[1:07:03] becomes in perfect fellowship with the
[1:07:05] father again standing on the other side
[1:07:07] of the chasm with no remembrance of sin
[1:07:10] against him
[1:07:12] anymore there's no more stain or bleach
[1:07:15] that can be seen or some issue that can
[1:07:17] be seen he's
[1:07:19] free Hallelujah and when he's confessed
[1:07:22] his sin and has been dipped into the
[1:07:25] blood of Jesus Jesus it kills all
[1:07:27] symptoms of
[1:07:30] sin and every molecule of sin goes back
[1:07:33] to the devil and lays on him to the day
[1:07:36] of judgment where his eternal
[1:07:38] destination will be thrown into the Lake
[1:07:39] of Fire and the chasm is
[1:07:43] bridged and now there's no remembrance
[1:07:45] no more and the man stands Justified as
[1:07:49] a Son of God not guilty
[1:08:00] he said couldn't you imagine how God
[1:08:02] could use a
[1:08:03] man excuse me under the blood of bulls
[1:08:06] and goats under the BL blood of bulls
[1:08:08] and goats and have the creative word Let
[1:08:10] There Be
[1:08:12] flies let there be this let there be
[1:08:14] that first thing you know little fly
[1:08:17] starts flying around then they're piled
[1:08:19] up everywhere why under the blood of
[1:08:22] bulls and goats
[1:08:27] and here we are no longer under the
[1:08:30] blood of bulls and goat goats we're
[1:08:32] under the blood of the Lamb yes so where
[1:08:36] does that place us
[1:08:38] Church what faith should we have in this
[1:08:43] blood if if if Moses had enough faith in
[1:08:47] that
[1:08:48] sacrifice he could stand there in
[1:08:50] confidence and say Let There Be
[1:08:52] flies KN he still had had Desires in his
[1:08:56] heart KN when there was issues still
[1:08:59] there but now under this Blood the
[1:09:02] Nature has been changed and the life of
[1:09:05] Jesus Christ has been transferred to the
[1:09:09] Believers you're talking about a
[1:09:11] transfer of
[1:09:14] wealth all your sins were transferred on
[1:09:17] your
[1:09:19] accuser so the life of your savior could
[1:09:22] be transferred onto you
[1:09:26] what a
[1:09:28] trade what a trade that God has done in
[1:09:31] our day when he could take the life of
[1:09:34] your your sins and your wrongs and you
[1:09:36] say father forgive
[1:09:38] me and they' be moved off of you and the
[1:09:42] debts paid and be put on your accuser to
[1:09:46] remain there till they're throwed in the
[1:09:48] Lake of Fire and from there his life be
[1:09:52] transferred onto you oh what a trade oh
[1:09:57] yes what a place to be what kind of
[1:10:01] Faith should we have in our
[1:10:06] blood if Moses could call for flies
[1:10:10] under the blood of bulls and goats how
[1:10:12] come we can't call for healing under the
[1:10:15] blood of Jesus
[1:10:17] Christ how come we can't call for
[1:10:19] salvation under the blood of it's in the
[1:10:23] atonement it is there the price has been
[1:10:26] paid
[1:10:27] for just needs somebody to believe I
