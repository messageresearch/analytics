[38:26] you want
[38:27] you won't pull down father no
[38:29] strongholds that you won't tear down
[38:31] tonight
[38:32] God your word will bring forth as it is
[38:35] Promised in your word father
[38:37] we're so thankful tonight that we serve
[38:40] a God that's willing to do anything and
[38:42] everything
[38:43] to ensure that his word
[38:46] will be made manifest and we just invite
[38:48] you tonight
[38:49] Lord you give us words to speak
[38:51] [Music]
[38:52] or there not be the words of a man but
[38:54] father you would come and you'd anoint
[38:55] my lips
[38:57] my spirit to get out of the way and
[38:58] allow you to move and orchestrate as you
[39:01] will tonight Lord you have seen the too
[39:04] many hours we had put forth in this
[39:05] study preparing for this moment
[39:07] so Lord I'm just inviting you now that
[39:09] you would come
[39:11] Lord you'll do your part as I've done
[39:14] mine and Lord you will anoint the ears
[39:16] of the hearer tonight
[39:18] Lord that we can hear what this Spirit
[39:19] would have to be said
[39:21] we just commit ourselves to you tonight
[39:23] father what a great opportunity we have
[39:25] to serve you distrust that you'll speak
[39:28] now in Jesus name amen if you have your
[39:30] Bibles this evening we're going to look
[39:32] in several places in Scripture
[39:35] tonight
[39:36] we'll start hearing John John 1 very
[39:40] familiar scripture reading for us all
[39:46] trust you've had a good week so far
[39:49] all right well praise the Lord some of
[39:51] you halves
[39:52] some of you still figuring it out that's
[39:54] okay
[39:55] that's what the midweek is all about
[39:57] still trying to figure it out
[39:59] the Bible would tell us in the beginning
[40:01] was the word
[40:02] and the Word was with God
[40:05] and the Word was God
[40:07] the same was in the beginning with God
[40:10] in verse 14. notice in the word
[40:14] that was in the beginning that word was
[40:16] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[40:19] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[40:21] begotten of the father full of grace and
[40:24] truth
[40:25] you can have your seats this evening
[40:28] and I just want to speak to you just for
[40:30] a little bit
[40:32] let me start my timer
[40:34] I want to speak to you on the word we'll
[40:36] bring forth after his kind
[40:39] notice after his kind
[40:42] so the Bible says in the beginning was
[40:44] the word and the Word was with God and
[40:47] the Word was God so let's turn to
[40:50] Genesis and go back to the beginning and
[40:52] look at some scriptures here in Genesis
[40:54] 1 verse 11 and God said let the Earth
[40:57] bring forth grass
[40:59] and Herb yielding seed and the fruit
[41:02] tree yielding fruit after his kind
[41:06] whose seed is in itself upon the Earth
[41:09] and notice now and it was so so God
[41:11] spoke the word and the Word was so so
[41:14] God honored his word he believed it when
[41:16] he spoke it and it manifested and the
[41:18] Earth brought forth grass verse 12 and
[41:20] Herb yielding seed after his kind take
[41:24] notice how many times in this short
[41:26] passage he says after his time and the
[41:30] tree yielding fruit whose seed was in
[41:32] itself after his kind and God saw that
[41:36] it was good
[41:37] verse 20 and God said let the waters
[41:40] bring forth abundantly the moving
[41:42] creature that he hath and the fowl that
[41:44] may fly above the Earth in the open
[41:46] firmament of heaven and God created
[41:49] great wells in every living creature
[41:51] that moveth which the waters brought
[41:53] forth abundantly after their kind and
[41:57] every wing foul after his kind and God
[42:00] saw that it was good
[42:03] verse 24 and God said let the Earth
[42:06] bring forth living creatures after his
[42:08] kind cattle and creeping thing and beast
[42:12] of the earth after his kind and it was
[42:15] so in verse 25 and God made the Beast or
[42:18] the Earth after his kind and the cattle
[42:20] after their kind and everything that
[42:22] creepeth upon the Earth after his con
[42:25] and God saw that it was good so now God
[42:28] has created he's created all the animals
[42:30] he's created all the botany life he's
[42:32] created everything but there's one thing
[42:34] missing in God's creation
[42:36] he has yet to create an image of himself
[42:39] but we find here in verse 26 God was not
[42:42] yet done with his creation he says now
[42:45] God said let us make man in our image
[42:50] notice after our likeness and let them
[42:53] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[42:56] and over the fowl of the air and over
[42:58] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[43:00] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[43:01] upon the Earth and so God created Man In
[43:05] His Image in the image of God created he
[43:08] him male and female created he them and
[43:12] God blessed them
[43:14] another scripture reading Romans 8 and
[43:16] verse 11 before we get started this
[43:19] morning
[43:20] this evening
[43:22] I got enough pages of notes Here we
[43:24] could start this morning
[43:25] Romans 8 11 says but if the spirit of
[43:28] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[43:30] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[43:33] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[43:36] mortal bodies by the spirit notice that
[43:39] dwelleth in you
[43:41] amen this all going to be all right
[43:44] tonight so we're going to speak to you
[43:45] just for a little bit the word now
[43:46] notice the word will bring forth after
[43:49] his kind so when we look in John and we
[43:52] find it says in the beginning was the
[43:54] word that brother bam tells us that he
[43:55] said the root form or the root from
[43:58] which we get the translation for word is
[44:00] logos so in the beginning was the logos
[44:03] and the word logos means a thought or a
[44:06] concept
[44:07] it has a double meaning means start or
[44:10] speech now he says think about it
[44:12] expressed thought becomes a word he goes
[44:15] isn't that wonderful and beautiful John
[44:17] says that the concept of God was
[44:20] expressed in Jesus
[44:23] then we find in the seven churches that
[44:25] he said then we come to Jesus the low
[44:28] gospel he was the perfect and complete
[44:31] thought expressed and he became known as
[44:34] the word see that is what he is and he
[44:37] forever will be but it says he has
[44:39] chosen Us in him Jesus before the
[44:42] foundation of the world that means right
[44:45] with him in the mind in the thoughts of
[44:47] God before the foundation of the world
[44:50] you and I were in God's thoughts
[44:54] so that gives an eternal quality to the
[44:57] elect he says you can't get away from it
[44:59] so if we look at that we were chosen in
[45:01] him in Jesus before the foundation of
[45:04] the world and we go back to Genesis God
[45:06] said let us make man in our image so God
[45:08] already had in his thoughts God already
[45:10] had in his mind and now Not only was it
[45:13] in his thoughts now he spoke the word
[45:15] let us make man in our image after our
[45:18] likeness so what does that mean that
[45:20] means that we're just as Eternal as
[45:22] Christ is eternal because when God saw
[45:25] Christ he saw you in him and he chose
[45:28] you then and there
[45:32] and then we find in Ephesians 1 he says
[45:34] blessed be the God our father of our
[45:35] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[45:38] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[45:40] places and we know that Heavenly places
[45:42] is the believer's position in Christ
[45:46] notice now verse 4 according as he has
[45:48] chosen us so now we're chosen in him
[45:52] before the foundation of the world that
[45:54] we should be holy Without Blame before
[45:56] him in love having predestinated us unto
[45:59] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[46:02] to himself according to the good
[46:04] pleasure of his will
[46:07] so the word of God no matter how long
[46:11] it may Tarry
[46:13] no matter how long that seed may lay
[46:15] dormant
[46:17] that word is going to come to life
[46:21] because God has already spoken that word
[46:25] and We Know by the teachings of the
[46:27] scriptures that the word of God shall
[46:29] not will not return to him boy but it
[46:32] will accomplish that which it was
[46:33] purpose in the message the spoken word
[46:35] now brother Branham would take from the
[46:37] spoken word is the Original Seed he
[46:39] actually goes into Genesis 1 and it
[46:41] begins to start at the creation and he
[46:44] says that spoken word is the original
[46:46] seat
[46:48] so when God spoke in the beginning he
[46:50] spoke you into existence though you
[46:52] didn't come to the seventh Church age
[46:55] God already knew the thoughts that he
[46:56] had for you see he said the word of God
[46:58] is eternal God being infinite he cannot
[47:01] speak one thing and later change and
[47:03] have something else a better decision
[47:05] because every decision of god is perfect
[47:08] see once his word is spoken it can never
[47:11] die he'll lives on and on and on and on
[47:14] it can never die because it is of god
[47:16] his word can no more die than he can die
[47:19] and I'm here to tell you tonight you
[47:22] cannot die because you're yoked with him
[47:24] because when he thought of Christ he he
[47:26] put your name there with him and
[47:28] therefore that word that spoke Jesus is
[47:30] the same word that's speaking life to
[47:32] you tonight
[47:34] and you can't die no matter what comes
[47:36] your way no matter how the enemy attacks
[47:38] you no matter how he bump at you you're
[47:40] gonna Outlast the enemy because you were
[47:43] a very a very thought in the mind of God
[47:46] but for the foundation of the world
[47:48] before mama and daddy ever thought of
[47:50] conceive it you were in the thoughts of
[47:52] God
[47:54] and those thoughts are eternal
[47:57] Hallelujah so once his word was spoken
[48:00] it can never die it lives on and on and
[48:02] on he said that's the reason we find in
[48:03] first John in the beginning was the word
[48:05] the word was with God and the Word was
[48:08] God and the Word was made flesh the same
[48:10] word that was spoken in the beginning
[48:12] with his eternal purpose came over and
[48:15] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it was
[48:17] God's word so when a man is born of the
[48:20] spirit of God he becomes inwardly he
[48:22] becomes in the image of God
[48:25] thankfully it's an inner work first
[48:28] that flows on the outside if we sing
[48:30] that song Jesus on the inside working on
[48:32] the outside
[48:34] I'm glad to know it's not Jesus on the
[48:35] outside trying to get to the inside
[48:38] but as Jesus working in the core of our
[48:41] heart and a soul realm to do what to
[48:43] manifest that word so that that seed
[48:46] that he placed there before the
[48:47] foundation of the world when it comes in
[48:49] contact with the word that is being
[48:51] preached in this hour what happens that
[48:54] seed begins to to Quicken and become
[48:56] alive and then now that Life of Christ
[48:58] begins to flow out of you it's not
[49:01] something brother Mike that you got to
[49:02] work it up something that you got to go
[49:04] in and you got to practice and you got
[49:06] to make yourself perfect and and do a
[49:08] bunch of do's and a bunch of adults and
[49:09] oh I got to be legal here and I got to
[49:11] be legal it ain't about working your way
[49:13] to heaven it ain't about working your
[49:15] way to God no the work has already been
[49:17] done God had placed a seed on the inside
[49:20] all that you've got to do is believe
[49:22] that the word is for you and let that
[49:24] work quick in that sea and that life on
[49:27] the inside of that sea will begin to
[49:28] manifest in your life
[49:34] so we find now the word
[49:37] the world was made by the word of God
[49:39] those pews that you're sitting on
[49:40] tonight was made by the word of God you
[49:43] said well God made the Pew no God made
[49:44] the wood that made the pew
[49:46] he spoke trees into existence
[49:49] and so God believed his own word and his
[49:52] word began to materialize
[49:55] and if he can do that for a tree what
[49:57] about for you and me
[50:00] what about for your your your your sons
[50:02] and your daughters what about our
[50:04] prodigals some of you so worried about
[50:06] your product about your son about your
[50:08] Wayward Daughter think about this word
[50:10] the prophet of God would tell us in one
[50:12] one place he said a Son of God can go a
[50:14] long time before he ever recognizes that
[50:17] he's a son do you realize that there's
[50:20] seas in the world today that have been
[50:22] that's been around for 2 000 years some
[50:25] Ten Thousand Years a seed laid Dormer
[50:28] for ten thousand years but once that
[50:30] seed is put in the right atmosphere once
[50:33] that seed is put in the right position
[50:34] in the right climate and the right
[50:37] anointing and the right word and the
[50:38] right everything that seed begins to
[50:40] manifest a life that was on the inside
[50:42] from the very beginning and what am I
[50:44] telling you it may be a bar room but God
[50:47] can still Quicken the sea he could be in
[50:49] a car after somebody just cusses a man
[50:52] swear it could be right there then and
[50:54] there that the light comes inside that
[50:56] vehicle and Quicken the seed
[50:59] it could be a water tower
[51:02] it could be somebody trying to commit
[51:04] suicide and the voice drops down says
[51:05] turn your car around what does it do it
[51:07] quickens the seed
[51:10] they may go years
[51:13] brother Brown they they when he went
[51:15] beyond the curtain of time and this
[51:17] young lady came up to him oh our
[51:19] precious brother and he said you don't
[51:21] remember her Duty he says no he says who
[51:22] was that he said she was past 90 when
[51:25] you led her to the Lord look how long
[51:27] that sea laid dormant but I'm going to
[51:30] tell you a Praying Mother and a praying
[51:32] father was praying for a 90 year old but
[51:35] at the right time in the right
[51:36] atmosphere that was life that was
[51:39] already inside that sea let me tell you
[51:41] that seed can go to a sinner's grave
[51:43] that seed can go to a devil's Hill
[51:45] because why because God has spoke that
[51:47] sea and that seed had life in it and
[51:49] he'll bankrupt Heaven tonight to make
[51:52] sure that that seed of his will come to
[51:55] life
[51:57] don't worry about your particle you
[51:59] commit him to God and trust that they
[52:01] are see and God will do his part
[52:06] notice he said let the Earth bring forth
[52:09] and the Earth brought forth
[52:12] let it bring forth everything after its
[52:15] kind this word kind there is species now
[52:18] I'm going to go through some definitions
[52:20] and I'm not trying to belittle anybody
[52:21] here
[52:23] so please know that I'm just working on
[52:25] my teaching skills
[52:27] so this word kind means species
[52:33] and the phrase after its kind means that
[52:36] light produces like
[52:39] somebody should say hallelujah
[52:43] light produces like kind produces kind
[52:47] species produces the exact same species
[52:51] they don't intermingle with one another
[52:55] so the theory of one species being
[52:58] developed from another species is denied
[53:03] we find that it's been exposed because
[53:05] see God created every species distinct
[53:10] from one another
[53:11] botany life does not intermingle with
[53:14] foul life
[53:15] whales of the ocean do not intermingle
[53:17] with mammals that walk upright
[53:20] I know I've been
[53:23] what we find here that everything
[53:25] produces increases and multiplies after
[53:29] its kind
[53:32] if you want rice and you plant rice
[53:34] guess what you're going to get rice
[53:37] if you like mangoes and you plant a
[53:39] mango tree you're going to get mangoes
[53:41] and if you are a human and I trust that
[53:44] everyone that's here tonight is
[53:47] you're going to bring forth more human
[53:49] life
[53:50] you're not waiting for the sonogram to
[53:52] find out what kind of animal you're
[53:54] going to have
[53:55] because you know there's a law that's
[53:57] been placed and it's put parameters out
[54:00] there this species must bring forth of
[54:02] its kind if you're not worried about
[54:04] bringing some other form to life you
[54:06] know that I'm a human therefore when I
[54:08] conceive and give birth it's going to be
[54:10] another human
[54:12] so nowhere in history of this planet
[54:15] that this law has ever been challenged
[54:17] or changed because God set the
[54:19] parameters in the beginning
[54:21] and we're still Lotus now we're still
[54:24] true sons and daughters are still
[54:26] holding true to those same parameters
[54:28] but we understand that the devil has
[54:30] came in this age
[54:33] to disrupt the plan of God
[54:36] so notice now it's God's ordered system
[54:38] instituted and established by him at
[54:42] creation it cannot change because God's
[54:45] word cannot change
[54:47] it's already been spoken
[54:50] I say hallelujah
[54:52] no matter how I feel it ain't based on
[54:55] how I feel I'm a Son of God no matter
[54:57] what I'm going to be in His image
[55:00] no matter what I've done it doesn't
[55:02] matter what I've done the blood pleads
[55:04] that the blood clears that the blood
[55:06] acts as the cleansing agent acts as a
[55:08] Clorox you can take that Clorox the
[55:10] blood of Jesus Christ and put one sin in
[55:12] there and it abolishes that that sin and
[55:14] it goes all the way back to the head of
[55:16] your accuser
[55:18] so we find out life comes from the seed
[55:22] amen
[55:24] whether it be botany life whether it be
[55:26] animal life whether it be human life all
[55:28] life comes from a seed
[55:31] now notice what is a seed every seed
[55:34] carries within it all the potentials and
[55:37] the promise of what it can become
[55:40] all Seas carry within it
[55:43] all the potentials
[55:46] see my son has potentials
[55:49] he's already outgrown those potentials
[55:52] I'm five foot six and a half and some of
[55:54] you may question that
[55:56] he's five foot eight five foot nine
[55:59] he's outgrown those potentials but
[56:01] everything that's in me
[56:03] is in him
[56:06] so we find so notice the seed carries
[56:08] the Prototype of what it will be the
[56:10] scene is basically a copy
[56:13] notice now a seed has all the
[56:16] information that it needs to grow into a
[56:19] complete healthy plant healthy animal or
[56:22] a human so everything replicates of
[56:26] itself everything replicates after its
[56:28] own kind that would replicate means it's
[56:31] going to be an exact copy
[56:34] an exact how many have ever seen twins
[56:38] they're an exact copy maybe it's one
[56:41] slight difference that you really have
[56:42] to pay attention to and if you're the
[56:44] parent you're the one that knows
[56:45] otherwise you're calling somebody by the
[56:47] wrong name
[56:48] because it's replicated as an exact copy
[56:51] so the life is contained in the seed in
[56:54] that life once it's manifested produces
[56:56] fruit take for instance an apple seed
[56:58] every Apple that's ever in that seed
[57:01] once it's planted and grows into an
[57:03] apple tree every Apple that will ever
[57:05] live on that tree is in that seed
[57:07] I'm trying to tell you now every
[57:09] attribute of God is already in you
[57:13] it's all laying there it's just got to
[57:15] be Quicken you just got to be coming to
[57:17] the presence of the Lord coming to the
[57:19] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and allow
[57:21] the power of God allow the anointing of
[57:23] the spirit to rain down on that sea
[57:25] don't push back on the anointing don't
[57:28] push back on the sea or the the rain but
[57:30] allow the rain to come and Quicken the
[57:32] sea and though the brother man would
[57:34] tell us in one place give the seed the
[57:36] word test see what they believe see if
[57:39] they're seed or not if you can receive
[57:40] it it shows that you are Sons and
[57:43] Daughters of God and the quickening
[57:44] power of the word comes to do what to
[57:46] Quicken the seed and that the spirit of
[57:49] Christ be in you it will Quicken your
[57:51] mortal body
[57:54] so we think about human life you and I
[57:57] are created in the image of God
[58:01] amen
[58:04] I know some days you wake up and you
[58:05] don't feel like it
[58:08] some days you just don't feel like a son
[58:10] of God
[58:12] but nevertheless
[58:13] the word is already spoken
[58:16] every seed is going to come after his
[58:20] kind God is going to have seed notice
[58:24] you are created to function in his
[58:27] Divine environment God created you to
[58:29] function in the Realms of the
[58:30] supernatural
[58:32] we're not only a mass of Flesh I know
[58:35] sometimes we feel that way don't we you
[58:37] have a bad day you're discouraged you're
[58:38] depressed you're beat down with anxiety
[58:40] and fears and you feel like nobody cares
[58:42] you're not good enough you're never
[58:43] going to amount to anything you just
[58:45] feel like just a Great Big Blob of nasty
[58:47] flesh
[58:49] but you're not the Bible tells us that
[58:51] we're Spirit soul and body we are a
[58:54] powerful creation of God we're the
[58:57] highest form of God's creation
[59:00] so notice now every trait that will ever
[59:03] be manifested in the life of a human
[59:06] being is already in the sperm
[59:10] every attribute
[59:13] the color of your eyes
[59:15] the complexion of your skin
[59:18] and I know some of us we try to go to
[59:20] that Tan in bed and you know we want to
[59:22] put on that nice tall dark and hand I'm
[59:24] already I'm wiped out all the way around
[59:25] short Stumpy and cute
[59:28] there ain't no tall dark and handsome
[59:30] here I don't miss all that I got in the
[59:32] wrong line when they was passing out
[59:34] genetics
[59:36] but we find everything is already in
[59:39] that sperm in that seed the color of
[59:40] your eye the complexion of your skin the
[59:43] color of your hair how tall you'll be
[59:45] well my case how short you'll be how
[59:48] much hair you'll have or not have
[59:51] notice also your personality your makeup
[59:55] whether you're going to be somebody
[59:56] that's going to be loving in gentle or
[59:58] mean and Stern
[1:00:00] firm and hard or somebody that's driven
[1:00:03] or somebody that's lazy and
[1:00:04] lackadaisical see all these attributes
[1:00:08] already in the seed
[1:00:11] and the seed determines the attributes
[1:00:14] of what that individual becomes
[1:00:17] so now I say that to say if that's the
[1:00:20] natural seed and the natural proceed
[1:00:22] possesses all the attributes that lays
[1:00:24] in the individual what about the
[1:00:27] spiritual seed what about the seed that
[1:00:29] God deposited inside of your heart
[1:00:31] before the foundation of the world if
[1:00:34] that seed that's natural can determine
[1:00:36] everything about you then I'll say what
[1:00:38] about the seed of God when that seed is
[1:00:40] being quickened then everything that God
[1:00:42] was it's already in you just waiting to
[1:00:45] be manifested to be Sons and Daughters
[1:00:48] of God to have overcoming power to have
[1:00:51] the word at your fingertips that you can
[1:00:53] speak and the word will manifest just as
[1:00:55] if you're the same as almighty God
[1:00:59] so notice now remember the sea carries
[1:01:01] the potentials
[1:01:03] and everything that God is is
[1:01:06] potentially in you waiting to be
[1:01:08] expressed
[1:01:10] well bam tells us in diseases and
[1:01:12] afflictions he says every life every bit
[1:01:15] of Life there is came from a germ you
[1:01:18] yourself are from a germ of life you
[1:01:21] came one time you were just a teeny
[1:01:23] little germ so small that you couldn't
[1:01:25] be seen by natural eye but you came from
[1:01:28] your father your see nothing your
[1:01:30] mother's blood at all the blood cells
[1:01:32] come from the male sex and then from
[1:01:34] that germ it becomes to multiplying
[1:01:37] cells and everything is after it's kind
[1:01:39] of germ from a dog will bring forth a
[1:01:41] dog a bird would bring forth a bird and
[1:01:43] a human will bring forth a human if
[1:01:46] nothing interrupts it
[1:01:51] it's going to take my time this evening
[1:01:53] so the word of God is a seed we find
[1:01:57] that Luke 8 and verse 11 that said
[1:01:59] deceit is the word of God and the seed
[1:02:01] is planted in the ground at that seed is
[1:02:03] watered it Springs forth to life if it's
[1:02:05] German if it's a germatized see notice
[1:02:08] now then if the seed has fallen into
[1:02:10] your heart and you'll water that seed by
[1:02:12] faith it'll bring forth just after its
[1:02:16] kind
[1:02:18] that's why someone you need a camp
[1:02:20] experience
[1:02:21] to get in the right atmosphere
[1:02:24] so that that seed
[1:02:26] can be quickened so some of you need a
[1:02:28] church experience so you can get in the
[1:02:31] right atmosphere
[1:02:32] I know sometimes it's hard to come to
[1:02:34] church on a Wednesday night after
[1:02:35] working two and a half days or three
[1:02:37] days and you're worn out and you're
[1:02:39] tired but if you do that not to see
[1:02:41] everybody I hope but you come because
[1:02:43] why because you need parts of that seed
[1:02:45] to be manifested to being attributes out
[1:02:48] of your life
[1:02:49] and he needs you to be here because
[1:02:51] somebody's going to manifest the very
[1:02:53] attributes that he has and so in order
[1:02:56] to express those attributes you must get
[1:02:58] into an atmosphere to where those
[1:03:00] potentials can be developed
[1:03:03] but bro man will say it takes the spirit
[1:03:05] of God the seed to give eternal life he
[1:03:08] says my
[1:03:10] you know people think brother Brown
[1:03:11] didn't get excited
[1:03:13] they ain't listening to the same tapes
[1:03:15] that I'm listening to
[1:03:17] so now every seed after is kind and you
[1:03:21] cross that seed up it cannot bring back
[1:03:24] to itself again so he begins to go into
[1:03:27] high breeding and we find in Genesis 3
[1:03:29] the First Act of hybriding took place
[1:03:31] then and there when Eve believed the LIE
[1:03:34] of The Serpent and took his seed into
[1:03:36] her womb
[1:03:37] and once that seed came into her womb
[1:03:40] therefore she stepped out of Eternity
[1:03:42] she came into an atmosphere of time and
[1:03:45] now no longer could she bring forth of
[1:03:47] the spoken word now she was going to
[1:03:49] bring forth of human desires
[1:03:52] so now this word hybrid means it means
[1:03:56] an offspring of two animals or two
[1:03:59] subspecies two different breeds two
[1:04:01] different varieties two different
[1:04:03] species two different genres relating to
[1:04:07] are produced from parents of different
[1:04:09] species variety and breeds
[1:04:14] you say well how in the world did that
[1:04:16] happen
[1:04:17] God made it he made a law everything is
[1:04:19] going to come forth after its kind
[1:04:21] but the serpent was so subtle
[1:04:24] he was so much like man but he didn't
[1:04:28] have a soul
[1:04:29] and we find in the message
[1:04:31] condemnation by representation the
[1:04:33] serpent was a man and the blood of an
[1:04:35] animal won't mix with the blood of a
[1:04:37] human no sir but this specie was so
[1:04:40] close between there until he did mix and
[1:04:44] Satan knew that
[1:04:46] so sin did not start in heaven it began
[1:04:48] on the earth he was kicked out talking
[1:04:50] about Satan and there there was nothing
[1:04:53] else that could get into the animal was
[1:04:55] too far from him so the seed would not
[1:04:57] mix so he got into the serpent which was
[1:05:00] being more like man and when God cursed
[1:05:02] him he put him on his belly and he
[1:05:04] changed every bone in him science is
[1:05:05] still trying to dig up those bones to
[1:05:07] find that Missing Link but he says now
[1:05:09] the serpent was most subtle and he most
[1:05:11] shrewd and cunning wisdom smarter than
[1:05:13] any of the other animals he was right
[1:05:16] next to man the most subtle of the
[1:05:18] beasts of the field
[1:05:21] so why did Satan do that because Satan
[1:05:24] was trying to stop that predestinated
[1:05:27] spoken word seed from being manifested
[1:05:30] in this hour because Satan was there
[1:05:32] when God said let us make man in our
[1:05:34] image Satan was there he knew the
[1:05:36] purpose and the plan of God that God
[1:05:39] intended and had desires to have a
[1:05:41] family in order to have that family he
[1:05:43] was going to have to bring seed and he
[1:05:45] was at the quick and see and that sea
[1:05:47] was going to have to manifest the very
[1:05:49] attributes of God and Satan right there
[1:05:51] he desired to pervert the family of God
[1:05:54] he desired to prevent those seeds from
[1:05:56] coming to life
[1:05:59] so he was there and noticed he injected
[1:06:01] his own seed into Humanity
[1:06:05] so he couldn't create but he could
[1:06:07] pervert
[1:06:09] and so because he couldn't create he got
[1:06:12] right next to man
[1:06:14] took on that image
[1:06:16] began to speak lies to Eve
[1:06:19] Eve stepped out from behind the word her
[1:06:22] protection
[1:06:23] and she believed the LIE of the enemy
[1:06:25] and she received his seed into her womb
[1:06:29] hybrid
[1:06:33] so now we're living in the day of the
[1:06:36] greatest perversion
[1:06:39] of humanity or age of great deception
[1:06:42] how many can say Amen to that
[1:06:44] man wants to be women how many of you
[1:06:46] men want to be a woman please don't
[1:06:47] raise your hand tonight please please
[1:06:49] please please please
[1:06:51] women want to be men
[1:06:53] notice now children they want to be cats
[1:06:56] and dogs
[1:06:57] zebras giraffes
[1:07:00] where are we at in society and not only
[1:07:03] that but the sad part is there's laws
[1:07:06] that protect and support
[1:07:08] this type of perversion and it's not
[1:07:10] just centralized in the United States
[1:07:11] but it's a worldwide perversion
[1:07:14] see Satan has implemented forced
[1:07:17] sterilization
[1:07:19] which allows individuals to reassign
[1:07:21] their gender or excuse me let me back up
[1:07:24] I misread that that's the transgender
[1:07:26] movement but for sterilization targets
[1:07:28] minorities and those that with those
[1:07:30] with disabilities so it comes in and you
[1:07:33] can if you were a minority or if you had
[1:07:36] a disability you can sterilize yourself
[1:07:38] or the government will sterilize you so
[1:07:41] that you don't bring forth more of your
[1:07:43] kind
[1:07:44] in 31 States already have laws that are
[1:07:47] for for sterilization but Satan just
[1:07:49] didn't stop there you noticed one thing
[1:07:51] he had the homosexual agenda the lgbqt
[1:07:54] and it's got every XYZ there with him
[1:07:56] and he wasn't just satisfied with that
[1:07:58] because now those even though they were
[1:08:00] homosexual if they decided to get their
[1:08:02] hearts right and God moved on them they
[1:08:05] could come back and they could still
[1:08:06] produce seed but the transgender
[1:08:08] movement what happens there is that you
[1:08:11] want to be a woman if you're a man and
[1:08:13] you're going to have a surgery and you
[1:08:14] have a sterilization that comes upon you
[1:08:16] one is the whole attempt that Satan's
[1:08:19] trying to do he's trying to block the
[1:08:21] seed of God from manifesting and now
[1:08:24] he's doing that by sterilization so that
[1:08:26] you can't bring forth but God's word has
[1:08:28] already been spoken God is going to
[1:08:30] bring forth of his kind he's going to
[1:08:32] have a bride and she's going to be born
[1:08:34] of his bone life of his life power of
[1:08:37] his power she is going to be him and
[1:08:39] ain't enough devils in hell can't stop
[1:08:41] it you can sterilize everything you want
[1:08:44] but this bride is coming forth
[1:08:46] she's going to Manifest this word and
[1:08:49] the word is going to bring forth Sons
[1:08:51] and Daughters of God
[1:08:57] notice now
[1:08:59] today children
[1:09:01] today can choose their gender
[1:09:06] based on how they feel
[1:09:10] versus their natural
[1:09:12] sexuality that they were born with
[1:09:15] this is all in an effort to destroy the
[1:09:17] predestinated seed from coming to life
[1:09:21] Satan is adamant
[1:09:24] that God will not have a family
[1:09:26] but God is more adamant that he will
[1:09:31] Satan is adamant that he's going to
[1:09:33] block that seed
[1:09:35] but Satan don't have enough
[1:09:37] he don't have I'm looking at seeds right
[1:09:39] here I'm looking at Sons and Daughters
[1:09:41] of God right here
[1:09:42] he don't have it why are you here
[1:09:44] tonight
[1:09:47] notice now
[1:09:48] in John 14 the Bible would tell us in
[1:09:50] verse 10 believeth thou not that I am in
[1:09:54] the father and the father and me and the
[1:09:56] words that I speak unto you I speak not
[1:09:58] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[1:10:00] in me he doeth the works
[1:10:03] believe me that I am in the father and
[1:10:06] the father in me or else believe me for
[1:10:08] the very work sake for verily verily I
[1:10:11] say unto you he that believeth on me and
[1:10:13] the works that I do shall he do also in
[1:10:16] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:10:18] because I go unto my father so the works
[1:10:22] are the fruit
[1:10:24] so the works are the fruit bearing
[1:10:26] witness that you are in fact an
[1:10:28] offspring of God it is proof that you do
[1:10:31] believe and the message the spoken word
[1:10:34] is the Original Seed
[1:10:36] for the Bible says now it works
[1:10:37] manifested see it's the same for us the
[1:10:40] same word if you want to do the works of
[1:10:42] Christ do the same things that he done
[1:10:45] he that believeth on me in the in my
[1:10:48] Works what is that belief now notice
[1:10:50] what this Believers means believe it
[1:10:53] that he is the Original Seed germ that
[1:10:56] come otherwise he's saying you believe
[1:10:58] it that he was the original seed that
[1:11:01] was planted in the Garden of Eden you
[1:11:04] believe that and you'll also find
[1:11:06] yourself in him because when he spoke
[1:11:08] that seed he spoke every seed here
[1:11:10] tonight and you got to find yourself in
[1:11:13] the same works that he did you're going
[1:11:15] to do also and greater because now it's
[1:11:17] a multi-member body here tonight
[1:11:20] but we find he Eve hybrid and she mixed
[1:11:24] it and she crossed the the species line
[1:11:28] and it's caused every heartache it's
[1:11:30] caused every ambulance every hospital
[1:11:32] that was ever built every doctor's
[1:11:34] clinic that was ever built it was all
[1:11:36] because eve took in a lie of the enemy
[1:11:38] and anytime you take in the law of the
[1:11:40] enemy it causes the seed of God to be
[1:11:43] malnourished or it stunts that seed from
[1:11:45] growing that's why we got to pull down
[1:11:47] imaginations pull down everything that
[1:11:50] exalts itself against the word of God
[1:11:52] and allowed that word his word to
[1:11:55] manifest in and through your life
[1:11:59] so he was God made flesh speaking about
[1:12:01] Jesus he died in order to pay the debt
[1:12:05] of your high breeding I say thank you
[1:12:07] Lord
[1:12:08] I couldn't pay my debt but he paid it
[1:12:12] I didn't have enough money enough credit
[1:12:15] enough this that or the other but he
[1:12:17] paid my debt
[1:12:19] and now I have become him he took my
[1:12:23] sins and I could take his righteousness
[1:12:26] so the word is a seed and as long as
[1:12:28] it's laying there it won't do nothing
[1:12:31] he put a seat up here tonight Pepsi to
[1:12:34] stay there and lay dormant dormant
[1:12:36] dormant dormant dormant but you put that
[1:12:39] seat in the right ground
[1:12:41] put that seat in the right atmosphere
[1:12:43] give that seed the right amount of s-u-n
[1:12:47] light
[1:12:48] and see what happens to that seed
[1:12:51] that's why the Bible will tell us if the
[1:12:53] spirit that was in him be in you
[1:12:57] it's going to do the same thing it did
[1:12:58] to him
[1:12:59] it's going to Quicken that seed it's
[1:13:01] going to Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:13:03] so when God brother Pam says now when
[1:13:05] God was made in his first bridegroom he
[1:13:08] was made the bridegroom first and he was
[1:13:10] both man and woman and the spirit formed
[1:13:13] in the dust of the earth to make him
[1:13:14] material and notice now when he made Eve
[1:13:17] from Adam he took not another piece of
[1:13:20] clay but he took from the same piece of
[1:13:23] clay the same word for Adam was a spoken
[1:13:27] word notice you're not a creating
[1:13:28] another another piece of clay but you
[1:13:31] came from the very heart of God and God
[1:13:34] spoke when God thought about having
[1:13:35] Jesus as a son and he would be the
[1:13:38] Savior you are part of that same clay
[1:13:41] that same that same Humanity or that
[1:13:43] same uh spirit and so he spoke to us and
[1:13:46] he said he brought Eve outside or from
[1:13:49] Adam a rib from Adam and what did he do
[1:13:51] he created him a helpmate he wasn't
[1:13:54] another piece of clay or she wasn't
[1:13:56] another piece of clay she was from the
[1:13:58] very substance that Adam was from and
[1:14:00] I'm going to tell you tonight Brothers
[1:14:01] you are from the very that almighty God
[1:14:05] is from you're from the spoken word of
[1:14:07] God and the spoken word is the Original
[1:14:10] Seed and that seed is going to manifest
[1:14:15] so the bride must also be flesh of his
[1:14:19] flesh bone of his bone then how is this
[1:14:23] mortal flesh going to become his flesh
[1:14:25] because it's going to be his spirit
[1:14:28] his spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:14:31] dead is also going to Quicken our mortal
[1:14:33] bodies and raise us from the dead in
[1:14:36] John 1 we find here in verse 10 said he
[1:14:39] was in the world and the world was made
[1:14:42] by him and the world knew him not
[1:14:45] now we read earlier that in the
[1:14:47] beginning was the word the logos
[1:14:49] the concept of God the perfect concept
[1:14:53] of God that was expressed and now we
[1:14:56] find that he was in the world and the
[1:14:59] world was made by him in the world
[1:15:01] didn't even know him
[1:15:04] he came unto his own and his own didn't
[1:15:06] even receive him
[1:15:09] but
[1:15:12] come on everybody looking at the screen
[1:15:13] but as many as received him receive what
[1:15:18] received that seed to them gave he the
[1:15:22] power to become sons of God even to them
[1:15:25] that believed on his name which were
[1:15:28] born not of blood nor the will of Flesh
[1:15:30] nor the will a man but of God
[1:15:34] see you're born of God when you're born
[1:15:36] again
[1:15:38] so the spirit
[1:15:40] the spirit doesn't Quicken every seed
[1:15:49] it only quickens the predestinated seed
[1:15:54] just in this man I mean that's what you
[1:15:56] need to run around
[1:15:58] why are you here
[1:16:00] because you're predestinated seed
[1:16:07] I said the spirit doesn't Quicken every
[1:16:10] seed
[1:16:12] that's why you see perversion out in the
[1:16:14] land that's why you see transgender in
[1:16:16] the transgender movement and lgbtq
[1:16:18] movement and all this movement and you
[1:16:20] hear this this shooting here and this
[1:16:22] shooting here and this here and this
[1:16:23] here that's not predestinated see but
[1:16:26] I'm speaking to predestinated spoken
[1:16:29] word see tonight that's why you're here
[1:16:32] because the spirit has quickened that
[1:16:34] sea and it's bringing that seed to life
[1:16:36] oh you may not be where you want to be
[1:16:38] but look back over your life at least
[1:16:40] ain't where you used to be God is going
[1:16:42] to work in your life and God is here
[1:16:44] tonight to continue that work to bring
[1:16:47] that seed to full manifestation I say Oh
[1:16:51] Glory to God tonight God's ain't done
[1:16:53] with me yet you're still working on me
[1:16:55] I'm here Lord to display the attributes
[1:16:57] of my heavenly father because you
[1:17:00] predestinated me to be a son and
[1:17:02] daughter of God
[1:17:04] those that were in the thoughts of God
[1:17:07] in the back part of his mind that's who
[1:17:10] the spirit is coming to Quicken
[1:17:15] now I know there's people they don't
[1:17:17] believe in predestination
[1:17:19] shame on them because the Bible does
[1:17:23] notice the predestinated one of course
[1:17:26] like to see delayed upon the Earth the
[1:17:29] one that had life in them many of them
[1:17:31] were dead they were just rotten seeds
[1:17:33] Waters thrown through and burned them
[1:17:34] out but you know there was a real sea
[1:17:37] laying there
[1:17:38] for the life God knowed it was laying
[1:17:41] there the predestinated ones are the
[1:17:44] first to be quickened by the Holy Spirit
[1:17:48] see the Holy Spirit comes to claim its
[1:17:51] own
[1:17:53] Justin that's why you couldn't go and
[1:17:55] keep going the route that you was going
[1:17:57] and living the life that you were living
[1:17:59] that's why it had to be an intervention
[1:18:02] when you said well it's because a little
[1:18:05] a little 16 year old girl came forward
[1:18:07] and had prayer yes
[1:18:09] because God quickened the life on the
[1:18:11] inside of her the crowd for you because
[1:18:13] God had already deposited inside of you
[1:18:15] that see Gene of life and no matter how
[1:18:18] far you ran you couldn't run past the
[1:18:20] hand of God but with the hand of God
[1:18:22] couldn't reach down and bring you back
[1:18:24] in your pajamas and you've been
[1:18:26] different ever since the saint there's
[1:18:28] old desires that you used to have you
[1:18:30] don't have any more wine because God
[1:18:32] came down and he quickened deceived from
[1:18:35] the field of viewers looking at a water
[1:18:36] tower that water tower changed your
[1:18:38] world it wasn't a water tower it was a
[1:18:41] seed on the inside you ran from God and
[1:18:43] ran from God and ran from God but God
[1:18:45] deposited a predestinated seed and that
[1:18:48] water tower took that that that that
[1:18:51] that blindness off of your eyes that
[1:18:53] Amnesia that you had and it broke the
[1:18:55] sin that was on your life and it
[1:18:57] quickened the sea that was on the inside
[1:18:59] and why are you here tonight because the
[1:19:02] seed brother Mike has been quickened by
[1:19:04] the message of the hour
[1:19:06] that's why we're here because seeds Sons
[1:19:09] and Daughters of God had been quickened
[1:19:12] and the word is bringing forth
[1:19:14] it's bringing forth It's been spoken

[1:19:38] across the Earth not
[1:19:40] to bring rocks
[1:19:42] which was dirt also to life
[1:19:45] it was not to bring all the dirt to life
[1:19:48] but it was to bring the part of the dirt
[1:19:51] which was enclosed around a life
[1:19:55] we wonder why sometimes life is
[1:19:59] life was awful
[1:20:01] don't you ever feel like dirt is this
[1:20:03] pout all over you
[1:20:05] okay maybe I'm just let me get a mirror
[1:20:07] and I'll just preach to myself
[1:20:09] man you feel so overweighted I like
[1:20:11] seeing everything is on top of Satan

[1:20:16] anxiety fears nervousness heartaches
[1:20:21] heart trouble and all this Cancer all
[1:20:24] this one thing after the other to do
[1:20:26] what to stop the seed
[1:20:29] I say pile it on Big Boy because all
[1:20:32] you're doing is creating the right
[1:20:33] atmosphere
[1:20:35] because all I gotta do is come into the
[1:20:36] presence of a living God and let the
[1:20:38] sunlight of that word begin to speak
[1:20:40] because already you don't put me in the
[1:20:42] right atmosphere I can't get no further
[1:20:44] down than I already am now I'm looking

[1:21:14] predestinated seat will manifest I say

[1:25:04] yeah I am a daughter of God I may have
[1:25:06] been drifting I may have been going

[1:25:15] s-o-n twine trying trying to Quicken the
[1:25:18] seed that's on the inside

[1:25:40] is coming that Mom is coming that her or
[1:25:43] that father is coming no matter how much

[1:25:48] has already been spoken over him hella
[1:25:50] high water let me tell you tonight it's
[1:25:53] coming because God's word will not shall
[1:25:55] not and cannot return to him boy I say
[1:25:58] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:26:00] tonight we're children on the most high
[1:26:02] God
[1:26:03] and God has got our back and he's the
[1:26:06] host of The caption of the Lord's army
[1:26:08] tonight and no matter what we Face how
[1:26:11] we face it the word of God will defeat
[1:26:13] Satan any time any place on any
[1:26:16] condition
[1:26:17] I say back up Satan
[1:26:20] sons and God are here tonight
[1:26:24] we're here tonight to do one thing to
[1:26:26] manifest the life
[1:26:29] of the seed
[1:26:31] my mama I probably on page two
[1:26:37] notice now
[1:26:40] foreign
[1:26:41] says the Holy Spirit comes now of course
[1:26:44] why won't all people receive it it
[1:26:46] wasn't sent to them
[1:26:49] see God told me I don't believe
[1:26:53] I don't care what you say if you could
[1:26:56] raise up the dead or anything and heal
[1:26:58] the sick and prove it anyway I still
[1:27:01] don't believe it I said certainly not
[1:27:03] you're an unbeliever
[1:27:07] he goes notice he says now it don't mean
[1:27:09] a thing to you it wasn't sent to you it
[1:27:12] was sent to those who will believe
[1:27:16] see the message is to the believer to
[1:27:19] them that perish is foolishness but to
[1:27:21] them that are in Christ and part of that
[1:27:24] seed is life
[1:27:27] and we find in Matthew 24 and 24
[1:27:30] there shall arise false Christ and false
[1:27:33] prophets and they should show great
[1:27:35] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[1:27:38] were possible they should deceive the
[1:27:40] very elect
[1:27:44] now notice this is in take on the whole
[1:27:47] armor of God he said better be careful
[1:27:49] now the Antichrist shall be so close to
[1:27:52] the seed the very late what is the elect
[1:27:54] when the light shines upon the s-o-n or
[1:27:58] the s-u-m shines upon that that governed
[1:28:01] by the botany life it'll come to life
[1:28:03] and when the Son of God Shines on that
[1:28:06] predestinated seed it will come to life
[1:28:09] that quick he's just as soon I don't
[1:28:11] care what state of life it might be a
[1:28:13] prostitute it might be a drunker or a
[1:28:16] gambler it will shine at that minute as
[1:28:19] soon as it strikes him deceived the
[1:28:21] elected if it were possible but it's not
[1:28:23] possible to deceive the elect
[1:28:26] notice he come to redeem or to bring to
[1:28:29] life those predestinated seed that God
[1:28:32] seemed before the foundation of the
[1:28:34] world and he put their names on the
[1:28:35] Lamb's Book of Life and there notice now
[1:28:38] there in the earth without a hope he
[1:28:40] came not only to be a blessing but to
[1:28:42] bless that predestinated seed and if
[1:28:45] that seed wasn't on there it couldn't
[1:28:46] live it had to be on the earth also
[1:28:49] germatized no matter how long it's kept
[1:28:51] in darkness it'll come forth when the
[1:28:54] s-o-n shines upon it notice he come to
[1:28:57] share it with us I say oh blessed be the
[1:29:00] name of the Lord you are looking for God
[1:29:01] but the son found you that's the wind
[1:29:04] came down and broke the shackles that
[1:29:06] was on your life and now your sons and
[1:29:08] daughters of God
[1:29:11] don't fear anymore
[1:29:13] for every four ordained
[1:29:16] predestinated seat of God shall come to
[1:29:20] life
[1:29:22] when the light spreads across it
[1:29:26] I know I share this all the time but I
[1:29:28] was driving 120 miles an hour
[1:29:30] I didn't care to live
[1:29:33] I didn't know there was a seed on the
[1:29:35] inside
[1:29:36] I didn't grow up in a Christian home I
[1:29:39] didn't grow up in the message
[1:29:41] but God planted a seed there
[1:29:44] and a voice came down and said turn your
[1:29:46] car around
[1:29:49] because why because he was going to
[1:29:50] manifest
[1:29:52] he had a job
[1:29:53] he had a purpose
[1:29:55] he had a mission he had a desire I'm
[1:29:57] gonna use you
[1:30:00] I'm gonna use you to destroy Satan's
[1:30:02] kingdom I'm going to take your passion
[1:30:04] I'm going to take all that screaming all
[1:30:07] that slobber and all that spit and I'm
[1:30:09] gonna use your gift I placed a gift on
[1:30:12] the inside of you but for the foundation
[1:30:14] of the world only thing that I got to do
[1:30:16] is Quicken that seed and when that seed
[1:30:18] catches a hold of this message oh watch
[1:30:21] out Satan watch out Satan the sick could
[1:30:24] be healed Satan will be cast out signs
[1:30:26] of one is going to follow them but I
[1:30:28] believe what am I telling you to say the
[1:30:30] same God that did that for me is the
[1:30:32] same God that's here for you tonight the
[1:30:34] quick and the seed
[1:30:37] you may be going one way
[1:30:40] but all it takes
[1:30:44] for whenever the light strikes on that
[1:30:46] predestinated seed it will come to life
[1:30:50] yes indeed you can't keep it the Solar
[1:30:53] Sun up there the s-u-n has control over
[1:30:55] all botany when a seed is laying there
[1:30:57] and that son strikes it it has to come
[1:31:00] to life
[1:31:02] and the Son of God is the controller of
[1:31:06] all
[1:31:07] eternal life musicians make your way if
[1:31:10] you would
[1:31:12] and if you've got a seat of life in you
[1:31:14] brother when the son strikes there and
[1:31:18] shows you what he is it comes to life
[1:31:21] there is no way of keeping from it
[1:31:25] so I asked you tonight why are you here
[1:31:31] not just
[1:31:33] in the four walls of this church
[1:31:35] but why are you here
[1:31:37] why are you around this message
[1:31:41] why do you follow it why don't you put
[1:31:44] efforts in drive 10 11 12 13 hours
[1:31:48] to go to meetings
[1:31:51] if it's all fanatical
[1:31:54] why are you here
[1:31:58] sister Alicia
[1:32:00] our sister Felicia where my mind was
[1:32:03] going on that one sister Felicia why did
[1:32:06] you and brother L pack up
[1:32:09] why did you pack up everything
[1:32:13] that you knew all your comfort
[1:32:17] family telling you warning you don't go
[1:32:20] you're gonna go over there and be a part
[1:32:21] of an all-white church are you serious
[1:32:24] what are you thinking
[1:32:30] they wasn't thinking
[1:32:33] the seed was being quickened
[1:32:37] Jay
[1:32:39] think about it
[1:32:41] haul your buddies
[1:32:43] and all your friends back in Mississippi
[1:32:44] what
[1:32:46] what have you come all your white
[1:32:48] friends
[1:32:51] cousins telling you this and saying this
[1:32:53] and saying that you know you're black
[1:32:55] you can't be around all them whites
[1:32:59] in the natural that's true
[1:33:02] but the seed
[1:33:03] has been quickened
[1:33:06] that's why Jay you can travel hours in a
[1:33:09] group of all white boys
[1:33:12] and go to a camp meeting or go here and
[1:33:15] go there and not feel one ounce of
[1:33:17] racism because they love you just as
[1:33:20] much as you love them because they're
[1:33:22] not looking at the color of your the
[1:33:23] color of your skin they're looking at
[1:33:25] the content of your heart and inside of
[1:33:26] that heart is a seed of God that's been
[1:33:28] quickened by the word of the hour
[1:33:33] for the lingo why are you here
[1:33:37] think about it for years
[1:33:40] an alcoholic from a kid what was you
[1:33:43] eight years old
[1:33:45] 10 10 years old you drank for 30
[1:33:48] something years wasn't it smoke drank
[1:33:51] party for 30 something years
[1:33:54] you wouldn't have gave him a chance
[1:33:56] I wouldn't have gave him a chance cause
[1:33:58] we can't see what God put on the inside
[1:34:02] oh I'm so glad sometimes church we just
[1:34:04] God looks beyond the natural eyes God
[1:34:06] looks beyond our Humanity but yet before
[1:34:08] the foundation of the world God
[1:34:10] deposited a seed on the inside of Lee
[1:34:13] goes strong he put a seed there on the
[1:34:15] inside and at a funeral service it was
[1:34:18] the unexpected place at an unexpected
[1:34:21] time God came down and spoke to him and
[1:34:25] tweaked in that seat and that's why he's
[1:34:27] here tonight
[1:34:28] because God made a promise I'm gonna
[1:34:31] bring forth no matter what it looks like
[1:34:33] no matter how it feels no matter how
[1:34:35] forgotten you may be I was gonna
[1:34:37] manifest my seed
[1:34:40] and it wasn't only for you but your son
[1:34:43] James
[1:34:45] and he thought he was just coming to
[1:34:46] work
[1:34:49] oh James
[1:34:51] look what God has done for you
[1:34:54] if there was no seed there there would
[1:34:57] be no there would be nothing changing on
[1:35:00] the outside but because there was a seed
[1:35:03] on the inside and God begins to work
[1:35:06] from the inside he begins to manifest
[1:35:08] from the inside he begins to materialize
[1:35:11] himself from the inside into the outside
[1:35:14] begins to display I am Assad
[1:35:18] I am a son oh you hear the word about
[1:35:22] cutting your hair and all of a sudden
[1:35:23] come back the next day 16 years you had
[1:35:26] long hair oh totes cut it all off oh you
[1:35:29] ain't had it short in a long time but
[1:35:31] you like it and we like it too why
[1:35:33] because you're displaying the attributes
[1:35:35] of a Son of God I sell glory to God
[1:35:38] tonight Satan wants to tell some of you
[1:35:41] you ain't gonna make it he's told your
[1:35:43] brother Roger you ain't gonna make it
[1:35:44] he's gonna sit there all alone but God
[1:35:47] put a seed there and at one point and
[1:35:50] one service you came by so I'm gonna try
[1:35:52] out even like Tabernacle and you've been
[1:35:54] here ever since why because I'm
[1:35:56] predestinated see what's the positive or
[1:35:59] the foundation of the world
[1:36:01] that's why we're here Church
[1:36:04] that's why we're here
[1:36:05] to benefit
[1:36:07] oh look we're not manifesting our own
[1:36:09] ideas there's enough of that in the
[1:36:11] world
[1:36:12] but we're manifesting
[1:36:14] the attributes
[1:36:17] that lay in the seed
[1:36:19] and everything that papa is
[1:36:23] everything
[1:36:25] that he is
[1:36:27] he poured it into the logos and when
[1:36:31] that logos came forth
[1:36:33] I said let us oh
[1:36:35] let us
[1:36:37] make man now
[1:36:39] in our image
[1:36:42] where the sin man has gone away
[1:36:44] I'm gonna have a pride she's gonna be
[1:36:47] born up my bone she's gonna be Flesh of
[1:36:51] My Flesh it's gonna be power of my power
[1:36:56] she will be me
[1:36:58] and I notice the church ain't bringing
[1:37:01] it forth
[1:37:03] padmus ain't bringing it forth Pentecost
[1:37:05] ain't bringing it forth denominations
[1:37:07] ain't bringing it forth let me just say
[1:37:10] William Branham ain't bringing it
[1:37:11] forward but God
[1:37:13] is bringing it forth the word
[1:37:17] is bringing forth
[1:37:19] of his kind
[1:37:22] aren't you thankful tonight aren't you
[1:37:24] thankful that you're his kind
[1:37:26] when you tried to quit you can't quit
[1:37:28] Aaliyah when you try to walk away you
[1:37:30] can't walk away because you're his kind
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:36] the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:37:40] you're just as Eternal as God is eternal
[1:37:44] you can't quit you can't walk away you
[1:37:47] can't give up cause it ain't you
[1:37:51] won't you bow your hairs for a minute
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:57] maybe you're here tonight
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:01] you heard something
[1:38:03] through all this screaming and spitting
[1:38:06] and slobbing maybe something spoke to
[1:38:07] your heart
[1:38:11] some said you're a seed
[1:38:15] you may have gone a long time
[1:38:18] you may have drifted a long time you may
[1:38:19] have made a lot of bad choices
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:23] might be utilized and you just want to
[1:38:25] slip your hand up and just nobody
[1:38:27] looking around just slip your hand and
[1:38:28] say God I'm hearing it tonight

[1:39:09] not sure how the service would go but
[1:39:11] trusting and believing
[1:39:14] Lord I believe tonight that Sons and
[1:39:16] Daughters of God
[1:39:18] some of us may have struggled the Lord
[1:39:20] over Who We Are
[1:39:22] we may have struggled Lord because of
[1:39:24] our complexes and our makeup and our
[1:39:26] humanity and discouraged over life and
[1:39:29] what life has done to us Lord broken
[1:39:31] homes and parents separated and what all
[1:39:35] kinds of things
[1:39:37] Lord we laid in the dirt
[1:39:40] life wasn't fair
[1:39:43] but nevertheless Lord
[1:39:45] no matter how much
[1:39:47] the enemy piled on us
[1:39:49] no matter how hot it got Lord
