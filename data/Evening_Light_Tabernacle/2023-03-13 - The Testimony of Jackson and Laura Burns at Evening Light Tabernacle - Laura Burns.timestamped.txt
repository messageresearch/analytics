[2:46] best um to keep it comfortable you know
[2:50] I told I was telling them in the back I
[2:52] said you know you know all these people
[2:54] you've spoke to just about all of them
[2:56] that most of the people here have
[2:58] probably heard the story before but just
[3:00] in small groups never like this this is
[3:03] different you know but I want them to be
[3:05] comfortable and we and I want them to

[3:10] room just visiting with you and talking
[3:12] and so we can so we can get this story
[3:15] you know personally
[3:18] um I first met Jackson in in 2003 and of
[3:23] course we maybe maybe he'll mention that
[3:25] in his testimony it's pretty big deal
[3:27] you know yeah maybe not um but in 2003
[3:32] and and struck up a friendship and and
[3:34] what I've seen is is God has just done
[3:37] in incredible Works in their life and in
[3:40] their family and and we are so grateful
[3:44] and so blessed that that they're now so
[3:46] Journey with us at evening like
[3:47] Tabernacle and just to to get us started
[3:50] tonight down this down this journey I
[3:52] kind of what I'd ask them to do is each
[3:54] one of them give us a little background
[3:56] about their own personal upbringing um
[3:58] what their childhood was like what their
[4:00] life was like just a little bit to to
[4:02] bring us all up to speed as it were and
[4:05] so what we'll do is we'll we'll let
[4:07] brother Jackson start tonight and um
[4:10] begin the testimony with his his side of
[4:13] things well I do appreciate everybody
[4:16] coming out um when uh brother Mike asked
[4:20] or uh this kind of this kind of spawned
[4:22] on Aaron's front porch and Mike was kind
[4:25] of pouring out his heart for his vision
[4:27] and him and Aaron were going back and
[4:29] forth about about some things that they
[4:30] would like to see and sometimes you get
[4:32] caught in the crossfire when you're kind
[4:34] of the third whe and they said well why
[4:35] don't we do this experiment on you we'll
[4:38] have you and Lor give your testimony and
[4:39] I said okay well we can do that and a
[4:41] lot of you guys have heard it we've
[4:43] shared it a lot um I A lot of times with
[4:47] a testimony it can be it it's super I
[4:49] want it to be super positive there's ups
[4:51] and downs within a testimony um there's
[4:54] definitely times where you uh you had
[4:56] your struggles and and things in life
[4:58] didn't maybe go as you thought would be
[5:00] um but I always look back and I see that
[5:03] uh God had a plan in it all right as
[5:05] he's ordaining your footsteps and you
[5:07] know I as I was just um visiting with my
[5:10] mom this week and asking questions about
[5:13] well remind me about this and and remind
[5:15] me about this and then we we had
[5:17] pictures laid out it was just it was a
[5:19] good time to go over uh things in life
[5:21] and where you came from but it also just
[5:24] showed me that if I were to question
[5:26] maybe something well why did it happen
[5:28] this way or or I wish it would have been
[5:30] different it it always reminds me that
[5:32] God was planning something the whole
[5:34] time amen and you look back over your
[5:36] personal life and you realize that um I
[5:39] might want to rewrite some things uh
[5:42] within myself but I don't because I know
[5:44] God was orchestrating it the whole way
[5:46] and even through the tough times and
[5:47] even through the times that I thought I
[5:49] might not be able to keep going on he
[5:52] was pressing through and I see that now
[5:54] and I look back and so when people ask
[5:56] our testimony I love to share it uh I I
[5:58] it has it has a lot of of highlights
[6:00] there's some tough times in there uh but
[6:02] also just a lot of times it can be an
[6:04] encouragement and I think even as
[6:06] brother Mike alluded to when you give
[6:07] your testimony it just allows others
[6:10] around you to clamp onto something uh
[6:12] there's a portion of it that someone can
[6:14] grab a hold of and that's really uh what
[6:16] I want to convey tonight um so origin
[6:20] I'm from Texas uh my parents were Ronnie
[6:23] in Judy Burns I was born in
[6:25] 1980 uh we were born in Dallas I was
[6:28] born in Dallas and um I was reliving the
[6:32] story with my mom she said I I want you
[6:33] to know how proud your dad was when he
[6:36] had you he had me and my brother a
[6:38] little later on in life uh he was 35
[6:41] when he had me and he was 39 when he had
[6:43] Cody um but my mom told me that my dad
[6:47] came to the hospital and he he wanted to
[6:50] know everybody that he had a son his
[6:52] son's name was Texas Jack and that that
[6:55] has just always lived with me and so
[6:57] when people ask me my nickname or I've
[6:59] had events at work when they said what
[7:01] are some of the names you went by well
[7:03] he called me Texas Jack so he comes to
[7:05] the hospital and he picked me up at
[7:06] limousine he picked me and my mom up in
[7:09] at limousine and he wanted to he just
[7:12] went around town uh he wanted to show
[7:15] everybody his new you know his son so we
[7:18] went showed showed me off to family and
[7:20] friends and my mom was just like he
[7:22] would just go anywhere that day as long
[7:23] as he had maybe rented the limousine and
[7:25] was like I want to show off my son and
[7:28] uh so it was that was really funny um
[7:31] and I just like as I was thinking about
[7:33] it this week I'm like wow he didn't know
[7:34] that like he had a you know he had a
[7:36] seat of God and maybe he didn't know it
[7:37] at that time but he was he was taking
[7:39] the seat of God around a limousine and I
[7:41] just thought okay that's that's really
[7:43] that's really cool um so then after that
[7:47] um I I didn't know this but um I later
[7:52] my mom was telling me that right after
[7:54] that she was uh the to one of the first
[7:56] things in my life she was struck down
[7:58] with cancer so so right from the get-go
[8:01] um she had me in November she went for
[8:03] her six-month followup uh to go uh to
[8:07] the doctor for a checkup and then within
[8:09] her they found like a 12b mass in her
[8:12] stomach and so I remember as she was
[8:15] young she had it cut out by God's grace
[8:18] everything went well uh but I do
[8:20] remember and you know we've had
[8:22] different ones uh friends and family you
[8:24] know they go down to MD Anderson in
[8:26] Houston and I just remember as a young
[8:28] you know as as she would have follow-up
[8:30] visits as I got older um she would
[8:33] constantly be down there and that was
[8:34] just you know that was a little thing
[8:36] that happened early on in life um and so
[8:39] she was you know relaying some of the
[8:41] things that that it you know some of the
[8:43] pressures it put on us growing up uh
[8:46] also uh she was a nurse so she went and
[8:49] um she took herself back to college and
[8:52] I think she
[8:54] graduated around 1990 from nursing
[8:57] school so growing up she was a real
[9:00] Rock in our family my dad traveled a lot
[9:03] uh he worked and um he was a pipe fitter
[9:06] he did a little bit of HVAC but he
[9:08] traveled a lot out to the Carolinas
[9:10] Kentucky Tennessee things like that uh
[9:13] he so he was on the road a lot uh which
[9:15] caused some hardships um uh a lot of
[9:19] times you we would might have a routine
[9:20] or something like that and then my dad
[9:22] would be gone for six months and he'd
[9:23] come back and next thing you know he'd
[9:25] be like hey we're doing this this and
[9:27] the other and we're like well we've got
[9:29] a schedule and we got a routine and and
[9:31] you know my mom would be like well this
[9:33] is not how we're operating so you know
[9:35] those were those were some some tough
[9:37] struggles uh in the beginning um and so
[9:41] but you know you look back and and you
[9:42] see things happen for a reason um when I
[9:47] um I was trying to think when I was in
[9:50] high school um that is when um that's
[9:56] when I first met Laura well hang on just
[9:58] a minute before we go all the way to
[10:00] high school I think we have a picture of
[10:03] you with your mom and dad oh
[10:07] no at about could you give us a guess
[10:10] about what I think I was three cuz Cody
[10:13] Cody wasn't born yet okay so this is
[10:15] right before Cody's born you know I look
[10:18] at that and I I see uh proud
[10:21] parents that looks like the a dad that
[10:24] would run a limousine and drive his son
[10:26] around right well and and then go back
[10:28] home to apartment right and then so at
[10:31] you know it's funny at that time we
[10:32] lived in an apartment on the Rough Side
[10:34] of Town um so when I think my mom was
[10:37] relaying to me when we were going
[10:39] through you know he was letting
[10:41] everybody know in the apartments that he
[10:42] rented a limousine so you better watch
[10:45] [Laughter]
[10:47] out so your parents stayed together up
[10:51] to high school yeah up to high school
[10:54] and um I would say started to happen is
[10:59] maybe my freshman year I was always into
[11:02] sports so played a lot of I played
[11:04] soccer more than anything and then from
[11:07] there played uh football basketball
[11:09] track we were in a 3A school so we um
[11:13] you know always being an athlete and
[11:14] things like that but then that's when I
[11:16] first started uh my mom my dad was on
[11:19] the road my mom was real maybe loose
[11:22] with uh she was working all the time so
[11:25] that allowed me and Cody to be at home
[11:26] and I just started you know I started
[11:28] experimenting in it so uh I would say
[11:31] some of the first things in high school
[11:32] was um start off with the small things I
[11:35] would dip in snuff so dip and snuff and
[11:38] then that was then that led to smoking
[11:41] cigarettes um then that led to marijuana
[11:44] and then other substances so at that
[11:46] time my life started to change uh more
[11:50] to the party scene and you could see you
[11:53] know kind of like with Athletics and
[11:56] things like that that started to um not
[11:59] be my focus and I love sports even to my
[12:02] senior year where I didn't actually just
[12:05] quit the football team because I got so
[12:07] involved in partying and drugs and
[12:09] things like that where it's just like
[12:11] that was really my main focus so before
[12:14] we give Laura the opportunity to tell
[12:16] her um early life you brought us up to
[12:20] your senior year and you you mentioned
[12:21] you just kind of you made mention that
[12:23] there was things in in your home life
[12:25] that you felt like turned you down that
[12:28] road senior year is that when you're
[12:31] your home split yeah so that is I was
[12:36] asking my mom today so in 98 my junior
[12:40] year is when um they had split I went
[12:44] with my mom uh Cody went with my dad and
[12:47] then at that time um we lived in a
[12:50] trailer so from Denton we bought a
[12:53] trailer and then when I was three from
[12:56] three all the way till 18 um but our
[12:59] trailer burnt down so I live with my mom
[13:02] Cody lived with my dad uh the trailer
[13:04] burnt down that forced them to move to
[13:07] emerel okay so your dad and Cody left
[13:10] they left and went to tamarillo and you
[13:11] stayed in what was it what town were you
[13:13] Glenrose GL we lived in
[13:15] Glenrose okay um one funny story is I
[13:19] did meet Laura in
[13:22] Geometry when you hear her side of the
[13:24] story sometimes it it it seems to be
[13:27] alter but I do remember her flirting in
[13:29] with
[13:29] [Laughter]
[13:31] me and so she would always need to
[13:35] borrow a pencil one time it seemed like
[13:39] it was a lot more than that day once a
[13:41] day okay um so we met in Geometry we got
[13:45] to kind of know each other a little bit
[13:47] there one funny story is I really
[13:49] thought you know I thought she was
[13:50] pretty in high school and so down in our
[13:54] cafeteria it had three levels so I
[13:56] always tell this story I sat down on the
[13:59] the bottom level and that's where all
[14:00] the football players would sit so Lura
[14:04] would come off of the top level and she
[14:07] was going to go sit at her table and I
[14:09] would always lean over to my buddy and I
[14:11] would say hey hey watch this so Lord
[14:14] walked by and she'd be getting close
[14:17] getting close and I'm just going to
[14:18] demonstrate it cuz it's better this is
[14:21] an exaggeration so she would walk by and
[14:23] I would say hey Laura and she'd go
[14:37] that's
[14:41] awesome well now that
[14:46] we've we're going to get that part told
[14:50] again before we leave just so we can see
[14:53] that so we brought it up to the point
[14:55] where you know who who Laura is but I
[14:58] believe you told me it would really be
[15:00] your your senior year when
[15:03] y'all really got to know one another
[15:05] correct yeah so to kind of just finish
[15:08] up my first side of it um yeah we we
[15:12] knew each other uh throughout High
[15:14] School uh and then my senior year um I'm
[15:18] going to go ahead and give those details
[15:20] before I turn over to her but my senior
[15:22] year I during spring break we were going
[15:26] down to South Padre Island me and a
[15:28] bunch of friends and we were going to do
[15:30] the big party scene and I got a DWI on
[15:33] the way up South Padre so we stay we
[15:37] only barely get out of town I get pulled
[15:39] over we got marijuana we got I've been
[15:42] drinking I get a DWI but we still got on
[15:45] the Padre come back go to court the
[15:48] judge says he was a military guy so he
[15:51] said if you go to the military then I'll
[15:54] dismiss this DWI so I said okay well my
[15:58] dad was in the Air Force so I said well
[16:00] I'll go to the Air Force well with a DWI
[16:02] you can't go to the Air Force so I said
[16:04] well I'll go to the Navy so then that's
[16:07] when I signed up for the Navy well then
[16:09] that summer Laura and I that's when we
[16:12] started dating okay so now we're going
[16:16] to turn it over to your side of things
[16:17] and you can
[16:19] start very early in life now a lot of I
[16:22] don't know this is on but um our
[16:26] testimony always involves my dad so I
[16:28] don't know what point at what I need to
[16:30] bring Just go with it that is so just go
[16:33] ahead okay just when you get to it just
[16:35] feel okay well I was
[16:41] born okay this is can I just lay it
[16:46] down that was a good pose yeah so I was
[16:52] born in Brooksville
[16:54] Florida and um I know there's some folks
[16:58] here I found out that we're from that
[17:00] area too um but I'll just go ahead and
[17:03] go into my dad's cuz it's just going to
[17:05] blend right in we can't separate the two
[17:09] um my mom and dad are both from
[17:12] Florida and um my dad grew up um really
[17:19] rough not really a religious background
[17:22] um went to the Army when he was of age
[17:26] and was in Germany for almost 4 years
[17:30] and he said that whenever he was getting
[17:33] caught smoking cigarettes or smoking
[17:35] hash over there which was really big
[17:38] instead of um Sergeant wood I guess I
[17:42] don't know what they do in the Army I
[17:43] guess you get in big trouble but he
[17:45] would preach at the boys and tell them
[17:47] his testimony he tell them about the
[17:49] book of Acts um tell them about
[17:51] repentance and so you know that just
[17:53] made them squirm but uh it was doing
[17:56] something to my dad so fast forward
[17:59] comes back from
[18:00] Germany and um goes to a little Baptist
[18:05] Church that he had went to just a couple
[18:07] times as a kid because it was his
[18:09] uncle's Baptist Church um like Dad said
[18:13] they'd go whenever there was like dinner
[18:15] on the grounds cuz they were real poor
[18:17] um so he ended up getting baptized there
[18:21] and don't if I should tell that story
[18:23] but um got baptized there and that's a
[18:26] funny story for another time but um
[18:30] after that he was still hungry and the
[18:33] preaching there wasn't really doing much
[18:35] for him so he prayed about it and was
[18:39] driving around the Okala area or dun
[18:42] Ellen there in Florida and he saw a UPC
[18:46] Church and the billboard said we preach
[18:49] with the Bible teaches so he said the
[18:51] Lord spoke to him and said you'll find
[18:53] the truth there so my dad goes in there
[18:55] and takes in a service afterwards goes
[18:58] and talks to the preacher which is
[18:59] brother
[19:00] erson and he goes to the back
[19:04] and um brother uran tells him he can
[19:07] pick a book from a study a ton of books
[19:09] so dad picks a book and ends up being a
[19:13] sermon of William
[19:14] brandom's um Dad believes it was broken
[19:18] sistern so brother Aron then goes into
[19:21] the detail about that he'd been to his
[19:23] meetings supported the meetings I think
[19:25] it was in Birmingham Alabama um talked
[19:28] about that you've better make sure if
[19:30] you go up there you've got things under
[19:32] the blood because the Lord shows him a
[19:36] lot cuz he has he's a prophet um so dad
[19:39] was interested read the books wanted
[19:41] more uh contacted voice of God
[19:44] Recordings cuz the address was on the
[19:45] back of the book so how old are you at
[19:48] this point I'm not born yet okay so this
[19:51] all happened pretty happen PR y so um
[19:56] he's getting few
[19:59] books tapes here and there um meets my
[20:03] mom at this church they end up getting
[20:05] married have me there in Brooksville um
[20:08] my dad had put himself through college
[20:10] courses and got a job at the power plant
[20:14] out there at Florida Power and then was
[20:15] transferred to Texas when I was
[20:18] three um so dad through this town did
[20:22] not know there was message churches um
[20:25] he just was getting books and tapes that
[20:28] he loved um so I grew up Church hopping
[20:32] so we were always in church very
[20:35] denominational
[20:37] um my dad just a regular 5 days a week
[20:41] guy at the power plant um my mom took me
[20:44] to brownies and then the Girl Scout so
[20:47] typical
[20:48] childhood um I
[20:51] was see only child so I was kind of
[20:54] weird my pets were like my
[20:56] siblings I loved my
[20:59] bets um but I always had friends over
[21:03] all the time um just totally normal do
[21:06] we have a picture of Laura in elementary
[21:10] school there we go those were my
[21:12] favorite glasses fifth
[21:17] grade um so about how old were you here
[21:20] I think it was fifth grade so I was
[21:22] probably what's that like 11 mhm so to
[21:26] this point in your life church hopping
[21:28] dad works at the power plant but your
[21:30] home's a pretty normal home as far as
[21:32] you as far as you know as far as I'm
[21:33] concerned it was very normal home yeah
[21:36] yeah
[21:37] um I started band at sixth grade and did
[21:41] it till I graduated I was trumpet did
[21:44] marching band where the ugly hats and
[21:47] their ugly red
[21:50] uniform um but so if we skip too far
[21:55] ahead here you can back up so your home
[21:58] H stays normal up until High School yeah
[22:02] semi-religious
[22:03] mhm yeah yeah um we were always
[22:08] regularly involved in the churches we
[22:10] were going to
[22:12] um there's only a few things looking
[22:15] back that I remember like um as far as
[22:18] dad cuz he was getting like message
[22:20] books and was reading them of course we
[22:22] still did not know there's message
[22:24] churches um there is a time where some
[22:27] friends of mine
[22:29] at the charismatic Baptist Church for
[22:31] getting baptized but was Trinity and uh
[22:34] I wanted to get baptized but Dad he
[22:36] wouldn't let me because um he had
[22:37] already talked to him they went
[22:39] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[22:41] Christ because he had heard the truth on
[22:43] that um but as far as I was concerned it
[22:47] was you know very
[22:50] normal so what point did things turn
[22:55] towards the negative um so
[23:01] yeah there was
[23:03] just a time when I was a teenager and I
[23:07] really don't know the details what was
[23:10] going on but my parents I guess I was
[23:14] see a freshman you're about 14 15 so
[23:16] sometime around there my parents quit
[23:18] going to church um the Baptist Church
[23:22] and um Jennifer
[23:26] Carter and Joe Boyd were Varsity
[23:29] cheerleaders and they're really good
[23:31] Baptist girls and I was a freshman
[23:34] they'd pick me up and I'd go to the
[23:36] Baptist Church with
[23:38] them um so that kept me while my parents
[23:41] weren't going but once they
[23:45] graduated and my
[23:48] mom
[23:50] she she loves the Lord and she has
[23:53] turned from this path um she professes
[23:57] Christianity and madees things right
[23:58] right but the devil just slipped in like
[24:00] you give it an inch he's going to take
[24:03] them all um so she just did
[24:07] not so her Wild Oats growing up um was
[24:12] raed raised very like
[24:15] legalistic UPC um just very religious
[24:20] and
[24:21] so um you know I don't know she let the
[24:24] devil in and
[24:26] uh you know just to help Laura feel more
[24:30] comfortable she'd Express how she really
[24:33] wants to share this aspect of her
[24:35] testimony but but she wants to be um she
[24:39] doesn't want to say anything that would
[24:41] even offend or or her mom or anybody
[24:44] they were ever to watch watch this and
[24:47] also some of the things aren't easy to
[24:49] talk about yeah but we want her to know
[24:52] that everybody in here has got things in
[24:55] their life that wouldn't be easy to talk
[24:56] about
[24:58] lots of stuff you know that we've maybe
[25:01] never shared you know so just feel free
[25:05] to to express how much you want to okay
[25:09] um so when this was going on we we're
[25:13] getting close to met at a party me and
[25:16] Jackson but
[25:18] um my mom it was like she became a
[25:21] teenager
[25:22] again
[25:24] and she started buying me beer
[25:28] and then um she started smoking pot and
[25:32] so I started smoking pot with her um
[25:36] start getting high with my mom and then
[25:39] of course um you know when your parents
[25:43] go down that kind of path and you don't
[25:45] have an anchor I mean but typically what
[25:49] you do um you just follow down the same
[25:52] path and um so there is drinking um
[25:56] smoking pot with my mom
[25:59] um then I started going down the party
[26:01] Road pretty hard and that's where me and
[26:03] Jackson
[26:04] met um I did my first line of cocaine my
[26:08] mom bought
[26:09] it
[26:11] um
[26:13] she had in
[26:15] Glenrose during this time I think when
[26:18] all that started I was the end of my
[26:21] junior year and there's like 2,000
[26:23] people that lived in Glenrose it very
[26:26] small Texas Hill Country Town
[26:29] so one of my neighbors was in high
[26:31] school she was in Jackson's grade and
[26:32] the other neighbor they were both
[26:34] coaches and teachers at the high school
[26:35] so words spread pretty quick um things
[26:39] that was going on I mean there were
[26:42] things that I got involved with in my
[26:44] mom as far as uh witchcraft tarot cards
[26:49] seances very it went dark pretty quick
[26:53] um and then the embarrassment of what
[26:56] was going on with my Mom leaving my dad
[26:58] dad during this
[27:00] time I couldn't handle the pressure of
[27:04] not belonging anymore because I'd left
[27:07] all my friends for another crowd and the
[27:10] embarrassment of everything going on in
[27:12] my family I'm in a small town at spread
[27:14] quick so I dropped out of school and
[27:17] went to an alternative campus to
[27:19] graduate early and at this time is when
[27:22] me and Jackson start hanging
[27:27] out so let's bring
[27:32] you I'm
[27:36] hakai so is this uh and y'all can you
[27:40] can flip through the pictures so they
[27:41] can
[27:43] see we don't show any of these pictures
[27:45] in any way to glorify anything that
[27:47] happened that you could even tell as
[27:49] Sister Laura talked it's not something
[27:50] she's proud of at all but to recognize
[27:53] that God's going to get you yeah
[27:57] wherever wherever you are whatever
[27:59] you're going through if you're his he's
[28:01] going to get you and we believe that so
[28:05] this would be senior
[28:07] year that is if I need a
[28:12] mic that picture is actually me going to
[28:17] the Navy um I am at the air I am at the
[28:20] airport about to fly to Chicago uh so I
[28:24] did sign up uh for the Navy right before
[28:27] there and I got one and that's this is
[28:28] the summer of 99 uh this is when I got
[28:31] my second DWI so now I've had a DWI
[28:35] within just a few months of one another
[28:37] this judge now knows that I'm about to
[28:40] leave and he's also doesn't want to ruin
[28:43] my life as a young man so he's letting
[28:45] me get out of town so if I can just get
[28:47] out of town in the next three weeks then
[28:50] both DWIs will be dismissed and so this
[28:53] is me at the airport um in my hand is is
[28:58] uh cranberry juice because I have just
[29:02] smoked weed a few hours before and I
[29:05] think I'm going to go there and life is
[29:07] going to change and so I am trying to
[29:09] drink as much as I can so that I can
[29:11] pass my drug
[29:12] test so it was an old druggy wife's tail
[29:17] that this drink worked to clean your
[29:19] system brother Mike you would know about
[29:21] this so I'm trying to clean up um it
[29:25] doesn't uh so I I fly to Chicago
[29:28] I uh get into the military we stay up
[29:32] for almost 72
[29:35] hours in this story make sure you share
[29:38] the part about the position you took in
[29:40] the na oh man so we get up there uh
[29:45] we're up we're getting
[29:47] um we're doing our drug tests we're
[29:49] getting all of our clothes we're getting
[29:51] our Barracks everything we get assigned
[29:53] to where uh we're going to be at and I
[29:56] am at this point
[29:58] I'm ready I've left my small town I'm in
[30:01] Chicago I'm going to be going to the
[30:03] Navy life is about to start changing for
[30:05] the better for me um and at this time me
[30:08] and Lura were still dating still we're
[30:10] writing one another uh and then maybe
[30:12] some phone calls in there um and they
[30:16] come one day and they say well we need a
[30:20] chaplain and I'm like and I and I really
[30:23] had kind of skimmed over the Bible a
[30:26] little bit and I thought why be perfect
[30:28] for a
[30:28] chaplain
[30:31] so so in that crowd nobody raises their
[30:35] hand and I don't know if this was the
[30:37] first time God tucked at me or if it was
[30:39] just me but I said well I'll be the
[30:42] chaplain and everybody's
[30:44] like okay so I'm like all right what do
[30:48] we got to do so we I start I think I go
[30:51] to maybe one chaplain
[30:53] class um
[30:56] and but this time boot camp is eight
[31:00] weeks long and I'm supposed to and
[31:03] usually within the first week they know
[31:05] when you fail your drug test you're in
[31:07] you're out you're General dischar
[31:10] General discharge well I had been in
[31:12] there for 6 weeks and I'm two weeks away
[31:15] from graduating I tell my mom I tell
[31:17] Laura everybody my brother they're
[31:19] making plans to come see me and I uh out
[31:23] of nowhere they pulled me in there and
[31:24] they said well you've you've failed your
[31:26] drug test and so you're going to be
[31:28] getting kicked out of the Navy and at
[31:30] that time I said well I I want to do I
[31:32] want to be in here I yes I party before
[31:35] I left but I don't want to go back and
[31:36] they said no you're get a you're going
[31:38] to get a general discharge so I get a
[31:41] general discharge but now I don't know
[31:43] what did I tell you
[31:46] guys so I got a phone call my parents
[31:49] were in town
[31:52] and uh you know my dad and my grandpa
[31:55] they had both been in the military but
[31:58] I go in there and announce that they're
[32:01] discharging Jackson from the Navy and
[32:05] that he said they did it because him and
[32:08] another guy got in a fight and he hit
[32:10] him over the head with a still toed
[32:13] boot so that's a no
[32:15] no my dad and my grandpa are like people
[32:19] fight in the military all the time I Ain
[32:21] never heard nobody get kicked out for
[32:22] that I'm like I don't know that's that's
[32:24] what he said so so were you just too
[32:26] embarrassed
[32:28] I really was I called everybody and told
[32:31] them I got in a fight so then people who
[32:33] know me they're like I don't think
[32:36] Jackson in high school ever got in a
[32:37] fight like he's not the fighting type
[32:40] why why would he all a sudden go get in
[32:42] a fight so that story wasn't going well
[32:44] around
[32:45] [Laughter]
[32:47] town so you come back so I come back and
[32:52] now I don't want to be in Glenrose uh
[32:54] the town that we're from these are where
[32:56] around the area where I got my DWI so I
[32:59] move off to Austin Texas um moved down
[33:02] there with some buddies me and Laura are
[33:04] still communicating she's coming to see
[33:06] me her and her mom they'll drive down
[33:08] there um one of the times that they have
[33:11] to drive down there I call them because
[33:14] I have went out and I have was in a bar
[33:17] and I stole some liquor at the bar and I
[33:19] got thrown in jail down there in Travis
[33:21] County so I tell her hey I need you to
[33:24] come bail me out well I don't know if
[33:26] her if your dad was like well I don't
[33:29] know if we y'all need to go down there
[33:30] so quick but they let me stay in there
[33:32] for several days before they came and
[33:34] got me out so they come down there they
[33:36] get me out and then I realize that this
[33:39] is right around uh at the end of
[33:43] 1999 and we're about to go into Y2K so
[33:46] they bring me back to Glenrose so that
[33:49] we can all be together because Y2K is
[33:51] about to happen and the world is going
[33:53] to end and so better so we better party
[33:56] hard
[34:00] so if I if we're skipping something
[34:02] that's important stop me but we've kind
[34:05] of laid the foundation of what life was
[34:07] like where y'all
[34:10] were when did things begin to change for
[34:14] the
[34:16] positive so shortly after the Austin
[34:20] pickup is when my parents ended up
[34:23] divorcing um and so at this time
[34:28] I lived at our old family home for about
[34:32] 6 months with my mom because that was
[34:34] kind of what the court orders were um
[34:37] per my request that she live there so
[34:40] she could get a job and get on her feet
[34:43] um and then Dad would come back and sell
[34:45] the home so 6 months goes by a terrible
[34:51] dark time there at the house with my
[34:52] mom uh dad comes in and reclaims the
[34:56] house she's got to leave
[34:58] and at this
[35:00] point um my dad had gotten so desperate
[35:05] cuz um you know I'm in the party scene
[35:10] drugs um my mom's left him she's in
[35:16] drugs
[35:17] and he just got rid of everything uh
[35:22] sold
[35:23] everything um just didn't want any
[35:26] memories but he did keep the box of uh
[35:30] tapes um there may have been some CDs in
[35:34] there and some books of Bo and Brandon
[35:36] that he got from voice of God
[35:38] Recordings and my mom left with uh Bobby
[35:43] and I end up having to stay there with
[35:45] my dad and still
[35:48] partying um going to the
[35:51] clubs all the time um Dad at this time
[35:57] gets on the
[35:58] internet and types in William Brandon
[36:01] because he had gotten his books out
[36:03] because he had just got so desperate
[36:05] like he went back to what he knew fed
[36:09] him um I think this was around 2000 yeah
[36:13] so he TPS Willam Brown the internet
[36:16] and I think it was the voice of God
[36:19] Recordings directory list for churches
[36:21] pops up so my dad's flored at this point
[36:23] he's like all these years I've Church
[36:25] topped and there are churches is out
[36:27] there so he finds Brother David and
[36:30] sister lesie calls them and they didn't
[36:33] pick up but Lesley called back and they
[36:35] talked and my dad starts going to church
[36:39] he's driving an hour and a half to Fort
[36:41] Worth because we were way further down
[36:45] south
[36:46] um so sell the family house and me and
[36:51] my dad move into an apartment together
[36:53] there in
[36:54] Glenrose and um I knew he was going to a
[36:57] church and it was all the way in Fort
[36:59] Worth but I was like well you know this
[37:03] is making him happy you know that's his
[37:05] thing I'm not going to go but you can go
[37:11] so he's going and uh he's been real
[37:15] faithful and I can see a change in my
[37:17] dad cuz he kind of had shaggy hair and
[37:20] he kind of had one leg in and one out
[37:21] leg out um as far as like with God and
[37:25] with the world and and nothing bad like
[37:27] he do a social drink once in a while um
[37:31] but I just started noticing um that was
[37:34] gone the way he talked was gone the way
[37:36] he looked was gone he was starting to
[37:38] cut his hair
[37:39] shorter um just there is a change and I
[37:43] was happy for him but I wasn't ready and
[37:48] um so dad was really good about he never
[37:53] pressured me
[37:56] um because he knew he knew how much ID
[37:59] went through and he knew like unless
[38:01] you're born again like you just can't
[38:03] pressure someone into
[38:06] right being born again you can't do it
[38:08] you've got to let God do it um he had
[38:12] told me today I'd called him and just
[38:14] wanted a little more detail um but he
[38:18] had said going to church that one night
[38:20] on his way home it was late it was
[38:22] either a Sunday or Wednesday
[38:24] night and he had stopped at a railroad
[38:28] crossing and the lights were going on
[38:31] they're flashing and the guard was down
[38:33] and he was listening to a tape and
[38:36] brother Brandon was saying
[38:39] um it was at the end of a tape where he
[38:41] was Discerning people were up for the
[38:43] prayer and a woman came up and brother
[38:47] brandham asked what it was she needed
[38:49] and she she goes to tell him and my dad
[38:52] said he thought you know if I was right
[38:54] there what would I tell him I wanted and
[38:56] he said I tell him I want my daughter
[38:58] saved and so he said right there he said
[39:01] Lord I want my daughter saved and he
[39:04] said brother Brandon finish the prayer
[39:05] with that woman and he told her what
[39:10] you've asked for and what you've said
[39:14] that that's how it's going to come to
[39:15] pass if you believe it so dad was like
[39:18] that's it like I claim it so he gets
[39:21] home and Brother David McGary calls
[39:24] him and uh dad
[39:27] answers and I think brother day was just
[39:30] checking on make sure he got home okay
[39:32] um and dad just told him what was on his
[39:35] heart and what had happened and he said
[39:38] I just want my daughter saved and
[39:40] Brother David said if that's what you
[39:41] want you're going to get it just claim
[39:44] it so Dad said ever since that he was
[39:47] done he knew it was going to happen and
[39:49] he said he just sat back and watched me
[39:53] and waited for God to move um watched me
[39:56] go into the parties he knew everything I
[39:59] was doing I mean it was very apparent um
[40:01] of course there was times when I'd leave
[40:03] to go out and I'd see my dad sitting on
[40:04] the couch by himself it kind of felt
[40:07] bad be like bye dad you know but he was
[40:11] so good with um not pressuring he would
[40:13] just sometimes say hey tomorrow uh if
[40:15] you want to go to church with me you can
[40:17] go and so one day I took him up on his
[40:21] offer and
[40:22] went and it was pretty convicting but I
[40:26] didn't go back for a while after
[40:28] that and then uh you know me and Jackson
[40:31] still together they're in Glenrose and
[40:34] um the first time I remember hearing
[40:36] brother brandom's voice was my dad
[40:39] stopped me and that night I was going to
[40:42] go out to a party and um he said hey
[40:48] Laura listen to this this is so
[40:50] interesting and he pushed play on the
[40:53] tape machine and it was marriage and
[40:56] divorce and and brother Brandon was
[40:58] talking about if you look at a woman and
[41:02] lust after her you've committed adultery
[41:04] with her even though you haven't
[41:06] committed the act and talk about
[41:09] conviction to someone that's going to
[41:11] clubs wearing in modest
[41:15] clothes um that's the first time I
[41:17] remember feeling a pretty big prick in
[41:20] my heart so after that I didn't have the
[41:23] full Revelation so if I was out at a
[41:25] club somewhere if I saw an older man I'd
[41:27] be like oh don't look at me you know cuz
[41:31] I was like oh I remember what he said on
[41:34] that date she would say anybody that she
[41:36] thought might be married she would all
[41:37] try to cover herself because she didn't
[41:40] want them looking at her go around and
[41:41] be like look at my friends don't look at
[41:44] me um
[41:46] so so your dad starts going my dad
[41:49] starts going he's inviting you you went
[41:51] once mhm um and then at some point you
[41:55] taught Jackson go with because your dad
[41:58] asking you to go and you're like I don't
[42:00] want to go up there by myself no no
[42:03] because it was convicting and I think
[42:07] May me deep down inside deep down inside
[42:10] I knew it was right I mean there wasn't
[42:12] a question it was like once that sprung
[42:15] like that was it I knew it was right so
[42:17] tell us from your Viewpoint the first
[42:19] time she tries to get you to go so she
[42:21] invites me to go and uh it's a Sunday
[42:25] night and she says hey will you go to
[42:28] church you know my dad's been going to
[42:29] church he's changed I've gone a few
[42:32] times maybe with him will you go this
[42:34] time and I'm like okay that's fine so
[42:37] we're going to leave at maybe 4 3:00 to
[42:41] get up there early um so what I'm going
[42:43] to do that day is I'm going to go play
[42:45] golf so I've planned to play golf and
[42:47] I'm like all right if I drag it out a
[42:49] little bit maybe have a beer or two then
[42:52] I can let her know that I'm not going to
[42:54] be able to make it so I do exactly that
[42:56] and I'm like ah I'm not going to be able
[42:58] to make it and if anybody knows Laura
[43:01] you know she has a way with words and um
[43:04] and so many words she was like you need
[43:07] to go or else and so I was like oh man
[43:10] so I skipped the last four holes go to
[43:13] my car meet her go jump in the car we go
[43:17] up there and um I didn't really grow up
[43:21] into the church and when I did grow we
[43:22] or when I went to church we'd go to the
[43:24] Baptist church and we were the ones that
[43:26] went on uh Christmas and Easter and I
[43:31] don't understand why we have to drive an
[43:32] hour and a half to church and then when
[43:35] we get there it is a double wide trailer
[43:39] and so if anybody's ever took in a
[43:41] service at brother David's uh the old
[43:43] church in Wataga it's a double wide
[43:45] trailer and now I don't really
[43:47] understand like normal churches have
[43:49] like a normal building but this church
[43:51] is like a double wi like I I'm not
[43:53] understanding we go the long way for
[43:55] this we yeah so I don't understand it we
[43:59] go in there and I always tell this part
[44:01] because I think it's really funny uh but
[44:03] we get there and um it's uh small crowd
[44:08] but there's the McGary boys so Aaron
[44:11] Davey and Matthew and I think Mike Jr
[44:16] and a brother named Glenn well we're all
[44:19] young and but I need to let them know
[44:20] that this is my girlfriend so not that
[44:23] they were looking but I'm like well
[44:25] normally you got to kind of like throw
[44:26] out vibe to everybody that this is your
[44:28] girlfriend so they know so we're in
[44:30] service and I just have my arm around
[44:32] her and I'm just letting all I mean
[44:35] there's not a lot of us there at that
[44:36] time and I'm just letting them know I
[44:38] this is my girlfriend so you Brothers
[44:40] don't try to move in on
[44:41] her so somewhere through the course uh
[44:45] Brother David he he's preaching a
[44:47] phenomenal service and he's talking
[44:48] about and if anybody knows his testimony
[44:50] it's super powerful uh but he's talking
[44:53] about if there's a seat of God in you
[44:55] that you can try to cover it with with
[44:57] drugs alcohol women things of the world
[45:00] but if that's seed there then there's
[45:03] it'll always come to know the truth and
[45:06] so by the end I don't know what happens
[45:08] I'm there to support her by the end of
[45:11] service I'm the one that's breaking down
[45:13] I'm crying so Brother David at the end
[45:16] of service he comes over and I think the
[45:18] boys come over and they all pray with me
[45:20] and we were're walking out of service
[45:23] and like I have a pack of cigarettes in
[45:25] my pocket and Matthew's like hey what's
[45:28] that in your pocket and I'm like those
[45:29] are cigarettes he's like let's tear
[45:31] those up and I'm all crying I'm like
[45:33] yeah let's tear them up so we we go in
[45:35] the bathroom and we rip them out we
[45:37] start tearing up these cigarettes right
[45:38] there in the bathroom um so that was
[45:41] that was my f so and then on the way
[45:43] home um we're listening to a tape and I
[45:47] think that's really the first time I
[45:48] think I heard brother brandom in the
[45:50] discernment so really it was the
[45:51] discernments that got me so we go back
[45:55] home and from there
[45:58] we were live we still living together
[46:01] right still problematic still a problem
[46:03] we're living together but every once in
[46:05] a while we would go to church with your
[46:07] dad so now this is 2002 and going to
[46:12] church with her dad I didn't really know
[46:14] a lot but I I knew when we did go to
[46:16] church that we would always listen to
[46:17] tapes and it just got me that this was
[46:20] something different I didn't really grow
[46:22] up in the church but when I heard
[46:24] brother brandom I knew it was different
[46:26] um and then at at the end we would it
[46:27] just seemed to always cuz it was an hour
[46:29] and a half there an hour and a half back
[46:30] we always made it to the part at the end
[46:32] of the tape with the discernment and um
[46:34] so it was just always powerful to know
[46:37] that um how God was dealing and I didn't
[46:40] know that that God worked through men
[46:42] like this and so it was definitely
[46:45] something that stuck out to me so at
[46:47] some
[46:48] point you get more
[46:51] serious a little bit Yeah tell tell us
[46:55] where Jackson she makes that that
[46:59] break with the with the the trip so we I
[47:04] noticed that Laura is she's going she's
[47:07] a little bit uh more serious than I am
[47:11] um we both were kind of in the beginning
[47:14] um interested but then the interest
[47:17] really just starts to fade so she wants
[47:21] to H we're planning a big family
[47:23] vacation we're going to go to uh Lake
[47:25] wasal there in Arkansas saw we're going
[47:27] to have a houseboat uh it's going to
[47:30] have a Jacuzzi on top with a slide
[47:32] coming out like I'm ready and I'm
[47:34] inviting her and I'm I said hey do you
[47:36] know you want to go with us well God's
[47:38] dealing with her sometimes she's wearing
[47:39] skirts sometimes she's not she's really
[47:42] just starting to make that
[47:43] transformation so I invited her to go
[47:46] and she's like well I'm going to I'm
[47:48] going to pray about it and I'm
[47:51] like all right I don't know what to pray
[47:53] about but okay so she's like I'm going
[47:55] to pray about it so she literally L
[47:57] makes a pros and cons
[48:01] list Pros are going to be um I'll have
[48:05] time to read my Bible and pray every day
[48:08] I'm going to read the Seven Seals Seven
[48:10] Seals book I'm going to bring the church
[48:13] age book it'll be so relaxing cons are
[48:16] going to be like well they're going to
[48:17] be partying it's going to be a bad
[48:19] influence so at this point I'm like I
[48:23] don't want her to come on this
[48:25] trip she's going to be dragging me down
[48:28] on this trip so in the end she really
[48:32] battles all the way up to the very end
[48:35] and we literally we leave our town of
[48:37] Glenrose we go to the next town over
[48:39] which is
[48:39] Grandberry we she's still coming I'm
[48:43] still not wanting her to come deep
[48:44] inside and we get there and finally she
[48:47] wrestles with herself and like I'm just
[48:49] not going to go so
[48:51] she so she literally stays there and we
[48:55] we wind up leaving her there we leave
[48:57] the house the property and she's there
[49:00] because Matthew and her dad are going to
[49:03] come pick her up so she at that point
[49:06] she anchors down and she is now like
[49:09] that's her stake in the ground she is
[49:11] now sold out and I believe it was that
[49:14] is around the summertime so then right
[49:17] after that it was August is when you got
[49:21] baptized I think there may be a picture
[49:23] of her baptism
[49:28] that's
[49:29] awesome that's awesome so so at this
[49:32] point and I don't know if I do I need
[49:34] this
[49:35] mic so at this point is there a clean
[49:38] break from
[49:40] Jackson for the most part
[49:44] um I would because you're living with
[49:47] Chad around this time um him and a
[49:49] friend moved in
[49:50] together
[49:53] um of course I still loved him dearly um
[49:57] because we were together for almost four
[49:59] years
[50:00] so
[50:03] um I did go over to his house when he
[50:07] was with Chad I think
[50:09] twice and I told
[50:12] Jackson if I give you a shoulder
[50:17] massage for the whole tape will you
[50:20] listen to this and he did it and Chad
[50:25] would sit there and listen to too and my
[50:28] arms would be Jello but I just so wanted
[50:32] him to listen cuz I was believing for a
[50:35] change
[50:38] um I mean it was just it's just hard to
[50:41] let go when you've lived with someone
[50:44] and been through so much with somebody
[50:46] through parents
[50:47] divorcing um the whole drug scene and it
[50:51] was a really tough Detachment at that
[50:55] time
[50:57] um but then there was where I just had
[51:00] to completely let go and what was it you
[51:03] told him on it to the me when we first
[51:09] met she told you she didn't love you
[51:11] that what so so she gets baptized and um
[51:16] we listen to a few tapes and then at
[51:19] that time
[51:21] um there at Christian Life Tabernacle
[51:25] they had their meetings their annual
[51:26] meetings in December so they have
[51:28] brother Isaiah Brooks out so they she
[51:31] invites me Friday night to come to the
[51:34] meetings and that's when I go to the
[51:36] meetings Friday night and that is
[51:37] actually the first night that we met
[51:39] that's so we cross paths and fud Ruckers
[51:42] there um Matthew introduces me and you
[51:45] as the first introduction and then we
[51:48] don't see we don't meet again till Youth
[51:50] Camp of the next year um so that was
[51:52] Friday night I didn't go Saturday Sunday
[51:55] morning she
[51:57] I told her okay I'll meet you at the
[51:58] Burger King at 8:30 then we're going to
[52:00] drive up there so I don't meet her there
[52:03] she her and Bruce Bruce is like hey
[52:06] let's just go it's a big meeting we're
[52:07] going to be late she comes to my house I
[52:10] think it's she knows where the keys at
[52:12] or it's unlocked it was unlocked it was
[52:14] unlocked she steps over everybody that's
[52:16] passed out wakes me up because I had
[52:18] promised her that I was going to come to
[52:20] service so she gets me up I get cleaned
[52:23] up as best as I can and then we're out
[52:25] we go to service well you know how a
[52:27] special meeting is where it's we show up
[52:29] and it's packed especially in that small
[52:32] Church um the only three seats that are
[52:36] open are the first three seats on the
[52:39] front row so there's the pulpit these
[52:42] three seats are open and um they set us
[52:46] up front in her mind she's like oh how
[52:50] can the deacons do that they I mean they
[52:52] should set us in the back what what are
[52:54] they thinking um I said see how God
[52:57] works so at the end of service
[52:59] phenomenal service once again they make
[53:01] kind of an altar call and they ask who
[53:04] wants to give their heart to the Lord so
[53:07] when you were standing here and the
[53:10] pulpit is right here to get to the altar
[53:13] you only have to do that and it was so I
[53:18] I didn't have to do the Walk of Shame
[53:20] like all the way from the back cuz I
[53:23] probably would have never done that but
[53:25] when you just have to make a half step
[53:26] because you're right there uh it made it
[53:29] easy so that was in so that was uh
[53:33] that's always a neat part of it and then
[53:36] fast forward right to uh now it's Janu
[53:39] or it's December 31st of
[53:41] 2002 um we have one more big blowout
[53:44] party at my house it's New Year's Eve
[53:46] the next morning um you can well you can
[53:50] kind of tell us what happened that night
[53:51] like for you oh
[53:53] so um typically I was at the big blowout
[53:57] New Year's Eve party and
[53:59] so um I was so burdened and just sick
[54:05] that I knew what Jackson was
[54:07] doing and I determined that I'm going to
[54:12] pray for him all night
[54:15] long and tomorrow I'm driving to his
[54:17] house and I'm going to see results so
[54:20] that's what I did my knees were sore the
[54:22] next morning I fell in and out of sleep
[54:25] the whole night
[54:27] night uh woke up that next morning just
[54:30] still on my
[54:31] knees and got dressed and drove myself
[54:36] over to the house and uh when I pulled
[54:39] up he actually wasn't there but his
[54:41] friends were there uh Jackson went to
[54:44] town to go get more
[54:46] beer and so I went in there cuz they
[54:49] were actually at your mom's house is
[54:51] where y are doing it and waited for him
[54:54] to show
[54:55] up and and um he did and he walks in the
[54:59] back door and I'm standing there in the
[55:00] kitchen with him and at this point um my
[55:05] dad has decided to move me and him up to
[55:08] kind of the Fort Worth line to get me
[55:10] closer to church because he sees how
[55:13] vital that is for me that's still a very
[55:15] new Christian um always describe to my
[55:19] dad that when I first gave my life to
[55:22] the Lord until I got really anchored
[55:24] that it felt like there's a vacuum
[55:27] cleaner constantly following me around
[55:30] and I could just feel the suction all
[55:32] the time and my dad made a very wise
[55:35] choice in getting me closer up to the
[55:37] church so I could fellowship with u it
[55:40] was mostly the McGary boys sometimes
[55:42] Heather and vong Guy were there um but I
[55:45] needed that um so I came over to tell
[55:49] Jackson that um my dad's decided to move
[55:52] us up close to the
[55:53] church and so she always tell this part
[55:57] so she tells me that she's moving she
[56:00] that that I'm a bad influence she's
[56:03] ready to move on I'm only dragging her
[56:05] down it's the vacuum that she talked
[56:07] about and it's just keeps trying to suck
[56:10] her back to the world and so she lets me
[56:11] know she's moving well she makes like
[56:14] one of the boldest statements I've ever
[56:15] heard she says I want you to know that I
[56:18] don't love you but I would love to see
[56:20] your soul saved and so I was
[56:24] like oh man and that was deep so I I I
[56:29] think I think I finish out that day
[56:31] doing whatever we were doing but at that
[56:33] point that was that was the last time
[56:36] that I ever drank smoke did anything
[56:39] that that day I laid it down so what
[56:43] happened so you prayed all
[56:46] night and the next day would be the last
[56:48] day he ever did any of those
[56:51] things so you got the results you were
[56:54] looking for I did that's awesome that's
[56:56] awesome testimony right there and um so
[57:01] with that I um then I got so then I
[57:05] wanted I wanted to give my heart to the
[57:06] Lord um so finished the day that was it
[57:10] and then got baptized January of
[57:14] 2003 so around that time I I know that
[57:18] oh yeah I think there's January so it
[57:22] was cold it's January we didn't have a
[57:24] baptismal we do it there in the river um
[57:28] I love Brother David so I always give
[57:29] him a hard time about this but we I got
[57:32] baptized first then there was another
[57:34] brother that got baptized and Brother
[57:37] David he had on a he had on a wet suit
[57:40] under his clothes that couldn't be seen
[57:43] and I didn't know this at the time um so
[57:46] he so he's out there and he's fine well
[57:49] the third the third person that got
[57:51] baptized was a sister when she got
[57:53] baptized it was so cold that when she
[57:55] came up she kind of went into shock and
[57:58] kind of stumbled so when she stumbled
[58:00] she fell into Brother David and they
[58:02] both went under the water so I always
[58:04] give him a hard time about that saying
[58:06] that that we got him back for that and
[58:08] um so that was 200 uh that was third
[58:13] week in January at that point I in my
[58:15] head I make the statement I go I got God
[58:18] I got the girl this is going to be a
[58:21] piece of cake and that's when the Lord
[58:23] is like no no no so so I always use the
[58:27] type that U at that point how how uh God
[58:32] hardened Pharaoh's heart there in Egypt
[58:34] I always say God really truly hardened
[58:37] Laura's heart at that season she was
[58:40] done with me we were over um we we had
[58:44] basically talked and said hey we're
[58:46] going to go our own separate ways and
[58:48] that's when we basically split up and I
[58:50] realized now that all that was just
[58:53] really so that we could have our own
[58:55] walk because there was times early on I
[58:58] was batting well is did I do it for me
[59:00] did I do it for the Lord did I do it for
[59:02] her like who am I doing it for so when
[59:03] he cut that off uh that's when we went
[59:06] our separate ways and then really the
[59:08] first event was the 2003 Louisiana
[59:12] Camp um that was when brother Ron
[59:15] Spencer was there and brother Danny
[59:17] steeman was there um we had just a a
[59:21] fabulous service if anybody has ever
[59:23] heard about those times or those
[59:24] Services um I didn't know a lot about
[59:26] Camp history it was both of ours first
[59:29] Camp ever yeah it was both of our first
[59:31] Camp ever yeah and um brother Ron
[59:34] preached the mighty conqueror on
[59:36] Saturday night and the Holy Spirit just
[59:38] fell in waves upon waves I thought you
[59:42] know you everybody's been to service now
[59:44] but I thought like we were there for
[59:45] like 10 hours I just thought man this
[59:48] like it's got to be 4 in the morning or
[59:50] something like what time is it and it
[59:52] just went wave after wave after wave uh
[59:55] and that's really where for me God
[59:57] really just anchored down and completely
[59:59] changed my life when I realized that uh
[1:00:02] there was a power in God and what he was
[1:00:04] doing and what he was trying to
[1:00:05] accomplish uh and I had just seen I say
[1:00:08] almost for a quick work but um it was
[1:00:11] pretty instantaneously when I got
[1:00:13] baptized I gave my heart to the Lord and
[1:00:15] things of the the world really just fell
[1:00:17] off um and then the anchor that for that
[1:00:20] service um was just super powerful and I
[1:00:23] know you had some experiences there and
[1:00:26] and we were screaming and shouting and
[1:00:29] running I'll never forget brother
[1:00:31] Jackson this was the first time we' ever
[1:00:33] hung out and at some point during all
[1:00:35] that he goes is this how it always is
[1:00:38] I'm like no not always but um it was a
[1:00:42] wonderful experience during that time um
[1:00:47] I know Sister Laura had went her way you
[1:00:50] went a different way it's funny because
[1:00:52] seed sewn then or even while we're
[1:00:55] sitting here tonight and that brother
[1:00:58] Jackson to to avoid seeing her would
[1:01:01] start coming over here almost every
[1:01:03] other weekend and he would come over
[1:01:05] here almost every other weekend for
[1:01:07] about a year and um I always think that
[1:01:11] a real important part of his testimony
[1:01:13] is the first time he ever visited our
[1:01:15] church and uh he got in on that Friday
[1:01:18] night and um about 3: in the morning or
[1:01:21] something crazy CU he worked all day
[1:01:23] then drove over and then we me and
[1:01:25] brother Tim winers got him up at 5:30 to
[1:01:28] go
[1:01:28] fishing and um and and this a funny
[1:01:32] story and I'll tell it briefly but he he
[1:01:33] comes in he's never even met brother Tim
[1:01:36] CU When we got to Tim's house and spent
[1:01:38] the night Tim was already asleep and so
[1:01:41] Jackson I wake him up on the C off the
[1:01:43] couch like hey man we're going fishing
[1:01:45] he goes okay and he he stumbles into the
[1:01:47] kitchen he still hasn't met Tim and he
[1:01:50] looks there and there's this cup of
[1:01:51] coffee and he goes man Aaron made me a
[1:01:54] cup of coffee that's awesome' it's just
[1:01:56] how I like it and he picks it up and
[1:01:57] he's drinking his coffee and Tim walks
[1:01:59] around the corner and just stops and
[1:02:01] stares at him and Jackson's like
[1:02:05] Su
[1:02:07] Jackson Tim goes that's my
[1:02:10] [Laughter]
[1:02:12] coffee so that that was their
[1:02:15] introduction to each other well the next
[1:02:17] day we'd kept him up all night and
[1:02:19] Jackson's fired up for the Lord man so
[1:02:21] he sits on the front row oh yeah and he
[1:02:23] says it's an exaggeration but I'm going
[1:02:25] to tell it the way I've always told it
[1:02:26] and the way I remember
[1:02:28] it he was
[1:02:30] tired and it was a it was a Sunday
[1:02:32] morning we'd been going for a while and
[1:02:34] I and I look up there because I'm I'm
[1:02:36] married at this point so I'm sitting
[1:02:38] with lyan Jackson on the front row and
[1:02:39] he's done passed out and he's done slid
[1:02:41] down a little bit and I see his hand
[1:02:43] touching the floor next to the bench
[1:02:46] next to
[1:02:47] us so we tell that story to brother juel
[1:02:49] forny a while later and then brother
[1:02:52] juel comes to preach at our church while
[1:02:54] Jackson's visiting and so brother juul's
[1:02:57] preaching along and just preaching all a
[1:02:59] sudden he just stops and says where's
[1:03:02] Jackson at is he
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:06] awake that was rough so during this time
[1:03:11] they stayed apart for a while and and
[1:03:14] let's move it forward to the time where
[1:03:16] you ask her to um to come visit your
[1:03:18] your
[1:03:20] mom so all that all that had a purpose
[1:03:23] in there um this was also time when I
[1:03:26] literally was traveling going to camps
[1:03:29] uh traveled out to Arizona that's when I
[1:03:31] met the Dexter boys out there we had a
[1:03:33] nice little running out there in Arizona
[1:03:35] in
[1:03:36] 2003 2004 is um and during this time I'm
[1:03:43] passing out tracks I'm witnessing to
[1:03:45] people bringing people to church people
[1:03:47] are getting baptized people are going to
[1:03:49] Camp uh one person in particular uh was
[1:03:52] a young lady that I was a coworker of
[1:03:54] mine her name was Jess iica had given
[1:03:57] her some tracks um she started coming to
[1:04:00] church a lot of times if I was
[1:04:02] witnessing uh maybe to uh a female or
[1:04:05] something like that I would do what I
[1:04:07] can to get them to service and then
[1:04:09] after Ser or then after a few Services
[1:04:11] if I could turn them over to a sister or
[1:04:13] something so they could be um a little
[1:04:16] you know have a little bit more
[1:04:16] fellowship with the sisters than I would
[1:04:18] do that so one her in particular I
[1:04:21] turned uh her over to Laura her and
[1:04:23] Laura got to become uh real good friends
[1:04:25] she came to Camp she got baptized uh and
[1:04:28] then she really started to just have
[1:04:30] some family struggles um just the
[1:04:33] pressure from her family and wearing
[1:04:34] skirts and and not cutting her hair and
[1:04:37] no makeup this was a total
[1:04:39] transformation for her uh but it was
[1:04:41] really neat because even at work she
[1:04:43] worked in the only position I'd worked
[1:04:45] for I worked for Walmart at that time in
[1:04:47] their Distribution Center um and she had
[1:04:50] the only position that had a um that had
[1:04:53] a uniform and she she's like I want to
[1:04:56] change position so that I can wear
[1:04:58] skirts and we prayed about it and God
[1:05:00] opened the door for her got her into the
[1:05:02] HR and she was able to wear skirts so
[1:05:04] she was kind of struggling a little bit
[1:05:06] with wearing skirts a little you know at
[1:05:08] work and then maybe a day at pants but
[1:05:10] she really was starting to have a a
[1:05:12] solid testimony but Laura was she had
[1:05:16] not been or the girl Jessica had not
[1:05:18] been coming to church for maybe for a
[1:05:20] little bit so lur reached out to me so
[1:05:22] this has been now I would say a year
[1:05:25] that we've U kind of been separated and
[1:05:28] that's where she's you're coming back to
[1:05:31] Glenrose and so she comes to Glenrose
[1:05:33] and I just said she says hey can you get
[1:05:36] me Jessica's number I haven't been in
[1:05:38] contact with her so I get her in contact
[1:05:41] um and I said hey if you don't mind
[1:05:44] would you would you come stop by the
[1:05:46] house you know we we dated for so long
[1:05:49] there's been a change in my life my mom
[1:05:51] my brother and them they would like to
[1:05:52] see you um if you if you would feel
[1:05:55] comfortable would you come by so she
[1:05:57] says yeah I'll come by she comes by we
[1:06:00] talk and really it's just like um we're
[1:06:04] just fellowshipping and then instantly I
[1:06:06] on that it's like we
[1:06:08] reconnected uh I mean she fell in love
[1:06:10] again it was
[1:06:14] amazing so it it just was the Lord's
[1:06:17] timing she uh we just started talking
[1:06:19] again so I I I talked to her dad and I
[1:06:22] and this was all new to me dating
[1:06:24] courting all the those kind of things so
[1:06:26] I uh I always would ask uh brother
[1:06:29] Matthew McGary he was my best friend and
[1:06:31] so I'd ask him hey how do you do all
[1:06:34] this and so he's like well you need to
[1:06:35] talk to her dad so I talk to her dad and
[1:06:38] I asked if
[1:06:40] um okay that's when we uh started
[1:06:43] talking again right there so we're
[1:06:45] making the we're making the the change
[1:06:47] back and uh he says yeah I've seen a
[1:06:50] transformation in your life I've seen
[1:06:51] God just cleanse you you're a different
[1:06:54] person uh I would love for you guys to
[1:06:57] you know start talking again um so
[1:06:59] during that time um that was in the
[1:07:02] middle of
[1:07:04] 2004 um then we get engaged in October
[1:07:09] of
[1:07:10] 2004 um and then we get married and yeah
[1:07:15] yeah engagement was pretty quick and
[1:07:17] then we get married in January of 2005
[1:07:20] that was an engagement picture my aunt
[1:07:23] she always is taking pictures and so she
[1:07:26] was like we were there for I think
[1:07:28] Thanksgiving so she's like I want to run
[1:07:30] inside and she grabbed something to put
[1:07:31] on Laura's head cuz we were engaged
[1:07:34] so and then we want then we then we get
[1:07:36] married January of
[1:07:42] 2005 compare what you're looking at here
[1:07:45] to the pictures of them just a few years
[1:07:48] before that's Ain ain't God
[1:07:50] good he's awesome and and I do want to
[1:07:54] just for the sake of people
[1:07:56] understanding you you made the statement
[1:07:58] earlier you know I got God I got the
[1:07:59] girl everything's going to be
[1:08:01] easy as we begin to wind this towards
[1:08:04] the present I I would like you to have
[1:08:06] the opportunity to share you the big
[1:08:09] tragedy that hit you in your
[1:08:11] life soon after you you do really have
[1:08:14] the girl
[1:08:15] now you're married and then you find out
[1:08:18] you're going to have
[1:08:19] Zoey and then what comes from
[1:08:23] there so
[1:08:25] early on in our Christian walk you know
[1:08:27] the lord always gives you this amazing
[1:08:31] uh I say Zeal but he just he put you up
[1:08:34] on the Mountaintop and allows you to
[1:08:37] just you know Fly Above everything
[1:08:39] that's coming at you um and so we we get
[1:08:43] we're married um we're things God's just
[1:08:46] put a hedge of protection around us he
[1:08:48] really starts to solidify us as as in
[1:08:51] our own walks our walks as a married
[1:08:53] couple uh and then I think then really
[1:08:56] the first big test comes uh in December
[1:08:59] of
[1:09:00] 2006 we realized that we're going to
[1:09:02] have Zoe um I called my dad I let him
[1:09:06] know that hey we're expecting our first
[1:09:08] um he super excited for us and
[1:09:12] then my uh then later on a few weeks
[1:09:16] later my mom's grandfa or my mom's dad
[1:09:20] my grandfather she he passes
[1:09:22] away a few days right before Christmas
[1:09:25] my mom and my brother they go up to the
[1:09:27] funeral I'm I I'm having to work I
[1:09:30] wasn't able to break away for whatever
[1:09:33] reason um during this time my brother
[1:09:35] spends time with my dad um the day
[1:09:37] before my Grandpa's funeral my brother's
[1:09:39] with my dad uh my Mom leaves amarella
[1:09:43] goes about 45 minutes north to Dumis
[1:09:45] picks up Cody around 10 o'clock that
[1:09:48] night and then somewhere between 10:00
[1:09:51] that night and 2: in the morning my dad
[1:09:53] wakes up and commits suicide side uh he
[1:09:56] shot himself and it was really the first
[1:09:58] big blow to me as a young Christian
[1:10:01] because it was just so many mountaintops
[1:10:04] you know so many high peaks that you
[1:10:06] know I you know I guess you you know I
[1:10:08] realize that those things are going to
[1:10:10] happen but uh it was a real big blow to
[1:10:12] us uh a lot of times you know I look
[1:10:15] back and there there was no notes there
[1:10:17] was no signs there was no um
[1:10:20] understanding and so really at that
[1:10:22] point um you know I'm I'm just question
[1:10:25] a lot of things it doesn't rock my
[1:10:27] anchor and and who I am and what God has
[1:10:30] planned for me but you know you start to
[1:10:32] battle questions about why and what and
[1:10:36] you know then did I say enough you know
[1:10:38] what I mean because we had a witness he
[1:10:40] had knew our testimony um I always
[1:10:42] believe that um that he saw the change
[1:10:46] in me and Laura I think he knew that we
[1:10:48] were at a good place we were starting
[1:10:49] our family he knew that me and Cody were
[1:10:51] very close uh that I could help take
[1:10:54] care of him my mom was at a good spot uh
[1:10:57] they still had a friendship even though
[1:10:58] they had separated all those years uh
[1:11:01] and so that was really kind of the first
[1:11:03] big blow as a Christian uh to me um and
[1:11:08] I will say this one of the testimonies
[1:11:10] that came out of it is if anybody knows
[1:11:12] Brother David mcgary's testimony he
[1:11:15] comes out of a uh he he he came out of a
[1:11:18] real uh past past with drugs and alcohol
[1:11:21] and bikers and stuff like that so I
[1:11:24] asked him would he do the funeral and he
[1:11:26] says I'll do anything you need uh so we
[1:11:29] he flies up to amarello and you you talk
[1:11:33] about um a funeral with a rough crowd my
[1:11:37] Dad ran with a really rough crowd and
[1:11:39] Brother David just preaches a
[1:11:42] masterpiece and he just uh because he
[1:11:44] can relate he can be in those channels
[1:11:47] uh he's preaching uh Salvation and
[1:11:50] repentance and opportunities and I just
[1:11:52] know that several several folks got
[1:11:54] spoken to
[1:11:55] uh they came up afterwards after the
[1:11:57] service and just thanked him enough and
[1:12:00] you know I just was always super
[1:12:01] appreciative of that because you never
[1:12:03] know when for what situations when God
[1:12:06] is reaching seeds or different things
[1:12:08] like that and what what the impact can
[1:12:10] be um so that was that was really one of
[1:12:14] the first um big battles that we went
[1:12:19] through and through that all The Anchor
[1:12:23] Holds and so we've seen
[1:12:26] God bring youall to Salvation allow you
[1:12:30] to walk on your own bring you back
[1:12:32] together you're married we we have um
[1:12:36] Zoe's born then you go through this
[1:12:38] tragedy and then then we can't forget
[1:12:40] Silas silus is born and and um and you
[1:12:44] have 18 years um there in Fort Worth you
[1:12:47] want you to share a little bit about
[1:12:49] about that just for a
[1:12:51] minute yeah so we um you know uh I I
[1:12:55] always always thank Brother David
[1:12:57] because you know he was he married us he
[1:12:59] did my dad's funeral he uh baptized our
[1:13:03] kids uh we had a phenomenal uh group of
[1:13:05] friends there and there's just such a an
[1:13:07] amazing work there uh in Texas and so
[1:13:11] then I would say this and and then so we
[1:13:15] I I do I always give him also a hard
[1:13:17] time because um I remember he asked me
[1:13:20] if I wanted to be a deacon uh or what I
[1:13:22] pray about being a deacon over there and
[1:13:25] at that time uh I was in my mid 20s and
[1:13:29] I um I look back now and my thoughts are
[1:13:32] different but I'm like deacons are for
[1:13:33] old guys like why why would he want me
[1:13:36] to be a deacon um and uh I look back now
[1:13:40] I'm like well the brothers that were
[1:13:41] deacons over there they weren't old why
[1:13:42] did I think that uh but I said I said
[1:13:45] I'll pray about it and um and he said
[1:13:48] you pray about it you see how you feel
[1:13:50] and then uh we'll see how the people
[1:13:52] feel and then we'll vote on it so I said
[1:13:55] okay we'll do that so everything's going
[1:13:58] well I always tell them this 18 months
[1:14:02] later uh Brother David comes to me he's
[1:14:05] like all right I feel like it's been a
[1:14:07] few months Let's uh let's let's go
[1:14:09] before the people I said Brother David
[1:14:12] it's it's been 18 months he's like what
[1:14:15] whoa where's the time going so so we we
[1:14:19] still do it we make it official um and
[1:14:23] so we serve in that capacity and during
[1:14:25] that time uh Laura Sunday school teacher
[1:14:28] and helping out and doing things and um
[1:14:32] just really putting our shoulder to the
[1:14:33] wheel uh there for that work uh and then
[1:14:36] this last year it um that's kind of when
[1:14:39] things started to change God started
[1:14:41] doing a stirring in our heart um about
[1:14:45] you know potentially moving and what to
[1:14:47] do well uh if you've ever you know
[1:14:49] you've heard other people's testimony
[1:14:51] and at this point um if I wanted to say
[1:14:54] that I thought life was perfect uh we're
[1:14:57] at a great church um I've got the best
[1:15:00] job that I ever had uh we love the the
[1:15:02] school that the kids went to their two
[1:15:05] days at school three days at home um you
[1:15:08] know this just like your perfect picture
[1:15:09] if you could write it up um we had it
[1:15:12] and then all of a sudden God's stirring
[1:15:15] on your heart to
[1:15:16] move so we prayed about it um we left we
[1:15:21] went to Florida and we had such a great
[1:15:23] time in Florida we're on vacation and
[1:15:25] always tell this um that we came back
[1:15:28] and then all a sudden it was like whoa
[1:15:31] we should move to Florida it's amazing
[1:15:33] and I'm like no wait that we're just on
[1:15:34] a vacation High you know we're just wait
[1:15:37] we shouldn't move to Florida that's not
[1:15:38] where the Lord's leading us we're just
[1:15:40] on a vacation High let's really pray
[1:15:41] about it so uh we continue to pray about
[1:15:44] it and then I uh met with Brother David
[1:15:46] and he gave me some great advice and um
[1:15:49] you know told him kind of what was on
[1:15:50] our heart then uh later on I called
[1:15:53] brother Tim cuz I really wanted to make
[1:15:55] sure that I met with the two pastors
[1:15:56] just told them to what's been on our
[1:15:58] heart and then so uh the minute we kind
[1:16:00] of felt led to come and to finalize
[1:16:03] everything it's just like and you know
[1:16:05] you know several of you have raised your
[1:16:08] hand that you've just moved here over
[1:16:10] the last few years um it just went it
[1:16:13] just happened quick we were able to uh
[1:16:15] talk to my boss let him know what was
[1:16:17] going on uh put the house on the market
[1:16:21] um it sold really quick and then we were
[1:16:24] able to to just make a transition and
[1:16:26] several people here just helped us
[1:16:28] through that whole transition and um
[1:16:31] just kind of really let us up to to this
[1:16:34] point you know that God is still
[1:16:36] unfolding maybe the reasons and the
[1:16:39] testimonies of why he's doing things but
[1:16:41] you know you just believe that uh your
[1:16:43] footsteps are ordained
[1:16:45] Amen brother Mike do you have the the
[1:16:47] picture from um from Virginia this year
[1:16:52] you I want y'all to think back to the
[1:16:54] pict that we saw of them where God
[1:16:57] brought them
[1:16:59] from to where God has brought them to
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:12] today and I tell you what I
[1:17:15] don't mean to embarrass people but Zoe
[1:17:18] come on Silas come on come stand with
[1:17:21] your mom and dad
[1:17:26] let's just this is a picture but you can
[1:17:28] stand with
[1:17:29] them I'm going to get out of the
[1:17:33] way and
[1:17:36] say this is what God has
[1:17:39] done and it's marvelous in our
[1:17:43] [Applause]
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:50] eyes amen now as we begin to bring this
[1:17:53] to a close uh this this part of the
[1:17:56] service we just all want to say thank
[1:17:58] y'all for sharing um I know sometimes
[1:18:02] things ain't easy to talk about get in
[1:18:03] front of a crowd and and just talk like
[1:18:05] that thank you so much I know it blessed
[1:18:08] my heart to hear it from beginning to
[1:18:09] end to see the hand of God moving and
[1:18:12] drawing and calling and and for each one
[1:18:15] of us that still have those out there
[1:18:16] that we wanted to get a hold of he found
[1:18:19] them in Glen Rose he found them in the
[1:18:21] party scene he found those that who
[1:18:24] who's even had gone down roads that are
[1:18:26] unimaginable and suffered the
[1:18:28] unimaginable he's going to get yours too
[1:18:30] he's going to find yours too and I
[1:18:32] believe that with my whole heart and and
[1:18:34] this isn't just a story this is a living
[1:18:36] testimony of lives dedicated to the Lord
[1:18:40] Jesus Christ and let's give him a hand
[1:18:42] again for

[1:18:55] seats now the last thing that I do want
[1:18:57] to
[1:18:58] do um is we we don't have time for a a a
[1:19:04] long question and answers session but we
[1:19:07] did think it would be uh uh if there was
[1:19:10] anybody that had something that maybe in
[1:19:11] the course of the testimony that you you
[1:19:14] didn't quite understand or you had a
[1:19:16] question or something that you thought
[1:19:17] maybe they could clear up just briefly
[1:19:19] we want to give you the opportunity if
[1:19:21] there's somebody that had a question
[1:19:23] that they'd like Jackson and Laura to
[1:19:25] answer we're not we're not going to
[1:19:27] grill them they're not on the witness
[1:19:28] stand well actually you are you're
[1:19:30] witnessing right now um but is there we
[1:19:33] wanted to give that opportunity before
[1:19:34] we moved on just in case there was um
[1:19:36] something that you wanted to ask
[1:19:40] them that just means y'all did a really
[1:19:42] good
[1:19:43] job y'all nailed it brother Michael if
[1:19:46] you'll
[1:19:50] come man of many
[1:19:53] hats and and take the service from here
[1:19:55] and I just want to say I know you were a
[1:19:58] great blessing in Dallas um to that
[1:20:01] church and you've been a great blessing
[1:20:03] to us through the years and Mike made a
[1:20:06] great point you know maybe you've just
[1:20:08] come here permanently but you've been
[1:20:10] part of us for for 18 19 years now and
[1:20:14] we're blessed to be a part of your
[1:20:16] testimony and I know that each one here
[1:20:19] um can say they love you dearly and love
[1:20:21] your testimony we thank God once again
[1:20:23] amen
[1:20:28] amen well why don't we just stand for a
[1:20:30] moment and
[1:20:32] uh amen I know you know we talk about
[1:20:35] the new ones here how many's been here
[1:20:37] for over 25 years how about that oh
[1:20:40] brother Tim it's good to have you all
[1:20:44] right well I know um you know there's
[1:20:47] there's certainly a lot of of ranges of
[1:20:49] the time that people have been here and
[1:20:51] I think one one huge blessing is Sister
[1:20:54] Lori and uh sister Lor just been so
[1:20:56] faithful with plain and asked if she
[1:21:07] could man I
[1:21:10] um I just there's a song that just says
