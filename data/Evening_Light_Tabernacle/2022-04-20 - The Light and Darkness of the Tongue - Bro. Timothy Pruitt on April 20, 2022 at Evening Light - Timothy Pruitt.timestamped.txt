[44:12] burn out sin and unbelief and
[44:14] every kind of thing the devil's trying
[44:16] to put on us that's we want to keep
[44:18] building that fire that'll burn that out
[44:21] amen and so we're just thankful to every
[44:24] soul and every life that was touched if
[44:27] you could turn in your bibles to
[44:28] proverbs 18 and verse 21
[44:32] amen i wasn't
[44:35] uh
[44:37] wasn't there
[44:38] i was there part of the time sunday
[44:40] night but i ended up leaving
[44:43] earlier than some of the things that had
[44:44] happened
[44:46] but as i went home this
[44:48] this
[44:49] thought began to
[44:50] uh come upon my heart and i began to
[44:52] think about it and think about these
[44:54] things and
[44:55] and uh tonight we just
[44:58] want to speak to you tonight on the
[45:00] light
[45:00] and darkness of the tongue
[45:03] the light and darkness of the tongue
[45:06] amen i believe that uh
[45:08] amen that we'll we'll hear some things
[45:10] tonight that maybe keep that revival
[45:13] going
[45:14] amen keep that spirit of god moving in
[45:17] your heart and your life proverbs 18 and
[45:20] verse 21 says death
[45:22] and life
[45:23] are in the power of the tongue
[45:25] and they that love it
[45:27] shall eat the fruit thereof
[45:30] amen we let you be seated
[45:36] what the scripture tonight that we've
[45:38] read is literally saying
[45:40] is the words you speak
[45:42] have the ability to give life to a
[45:45] person or to yourself or to a situation
[45:49] however they can also kill or destroy
[45:52] a person a situation or yourself or your
[45:55] testimony
[45:56] this scripture is a simple reminder of
[45:59] how much your words matter
[46:02] you know out of your mouth you have the
[46:03] ability to build up or tear down
[46:06] you have the ability to motivate or
[46:09] discourage
[46:10] you have the ability to lift people high
[46:12] higher or drag them lower
[46:15] you you have the ability to inspire to
[46:18] greatness or to push them to mediocrity
[46:21] all because of the words that have come
[46:23] in out of your mouth
[46:25] this is the life and death or the
[46:27] darkness and light that is in the power
[46:29] of the tongue
[46:30] you know jesus would say in matthew
[46:32] chapter 12 and verse 37 he says for by
[46:35] thy words thou shalt be justified and by
[46:39] thy words thou shalt be condemned
[46:42] so we see there's power in the tongue
[46:44] there's power in the word and brother
[46:46] brandon would speak many things on
[46:48] confession and profession amen are being
[46:51] the same thing that we must confess that
[46:53] god has done it before he can even do
[46:55] anything for us so it's very very
[46:58] important that you keep the right
[47:00] positive attitude towards whatever god's
[47:02] done for you in your life and and you
[47:04] continue to build by the words that
[47:06] comes out of your mouth and and to hold
[47:09] on fat to the fat hold on fast to that
[47:12] profession maybe in this camp you said i
[47:14] got the holy ghost well you're going to
[47:16] have to hold that
[47:18] amen you say well i got healed you're
[47:20] going to have to hold that brother brown
[47:22] we'll talk about somebody coming in the
[47:23] prayer line and says you're healed he
[47:25] said but you're going to have to hold
[47:26] that the you'll stay healed as long as
[47:29] you have the faith to stay healed
[47:31] amen and so i understand that we're
[47:33] sealed into the day of our redemption
[47:34] and those things but amen but still you
[47:37] have to continue in the faith amen you
[47:40] cannot let your guard down you cannot
[47:42] let words begin to come out of your
[47:44] mouth that does not line up with the
[47:46] word of god
[47:47] amen you know you might have thoughts
[47:49] you might have things but don't let
[47:50] those thoughts become words because
[47:53] those words become actions and those
[47:55] actions become a life that you live amen
[47:58] we could read in hebrews chapter 4 and
[47:59] verse 14 seeing that we have a great
[48:02] high priest that has passed into the
[48:04] heavens jesus the son of god let us hold
[48:07] fast our profession and on down in 10
[48:11] and verse 23 let us hold fast the
[48:13] profession of our faith without wavering
[48:17] for he is faithful that promise
[48:21] hallelujah how many believes is faith
[48:24] amen you know it doesn't matter you say
[48:26] well brother timothy what if i i don't
[48:27] feel like it doesn't matter what you
[48:29] feel like or you say well what if i
[48:31] don't i don't see it doesn't matter what
[48:33] you see amen you continue to profess or
[48:36] confess that he's the healer he's the
[48:38] deliverer he's the satisfier he has
[48:41] everything i have need of and you speak
[48:43] it amen out of your mouth until it comes
[48:46] to pass in your life amen you know you
[48:48] say brother branham had that that
[48:50] sickness in his body and i was just
[48:52] reading this amen back before i come out
[48:54] and and he said you know you see he ate
[48:56] that pile of beans and that that servant
[48:59] of beans and onions and the doctor said
[49:00] it was going to kill him but he began to
[49:02] confess that god's my healer he began to
[49:05] lay there and stay there in that place
[49:07] and it didn't matter if it felt it it
[49:09] didn't matter if there was something
[49:10] happen some chill that didn't matter to
[49:12] him what mattered is what god's word
[49:14] said and he began to confess it and he
[49:17] would he would he would eat it and his
[49:18] mama was screaming and said you're going
[49:20] to die the doctor said you'd eat a bite
[49:22] and he said i don't care what the doctor
[49:23] says i'm going to believe the word of
[49:25] god i'm healed and he would begin to
[49:27] profess that and confess that he'd
[49:29] swallow it he would try to come up he'd
[49:31] swallow it and he'd try to come up how
[49:32] you feeling billy i'm healed
[49:35] how you feeling i'm healed he said
[49:37] somebody told me i was lying he said no
[49:39] i wasn't lying i was only saying what
[49:42] god's word said
[49:44] hallelujah the devil wants to make you
[49:46] think you're lying when you try to say
[49:48] something but what you're saying is not
[49:50] your word you're saying the word of god
[49:52] you're saying what god's word said he
[49:55] said i could have the holy ghost he said
[49:58] i could be healed he said i could be
[50:00] delivered he said i am delivered he said
[50:04] i am healed he said i do have the holy
[50:07] ghost his word has declared it therefore
[50:09] i'm not speaking what i feel i'm not
[50:12] speaking what i see i'm speaking what
[50:14] god's word says
[50:16] and light begins to come out of your
[50:18] life and out of your mouth as you speak
[50:20] the words of god psalms 19 psalms 19 and
[50:24] verse 14 says let the words of my mouth
[50:27] and the meditation of my heart be
[50:29] accepted in thy sight o lord my strength
[50:33] and my redeemer 4141 verse 3 said a
[50:36] watch o lord before my
[50:38] my mouth and keep the doors of my lips
[50:43] amen so it's very important what comes
[50:45] out of the lips
[50:47] it's very important what you say it's
[50:49] very important what you speak it's very
[50:51] important amen what you allow to be
[50:54] voiced in your life proverbs 6 and verse
[50:56] 2 says thou art snared with the words of
[50:59] thy mouth and thou art taken with the
[51:02] words of thy mouth
[51:04] thy mouth
[51:06] now what you know we get so worried
[51:07] about what somebody else says about you
[51:09] what you need to worry about what you
[51:11] say about yourself
[51:13] what are you saying about your
[51:14] experience what you're saying about who
[51:17] you are what are you declaring
[51:21] amen he that proverbs 13 and verse 3
[51:23] says he that keepeth his mouth keepeth
[51:26] his life
[51:28] but he that openeth wide his lips shall
[51:31] have destruction proverbs 15 and verse 4
[51:34] says a wholesome tongue is the tree of
[51:37] life wholesome is a health or healing a
[51:40] healing tongue is the tree of life
[51:44] you know i was reading some things
[51:45] brother brennan would say about thoughts
[51:47] and i run across these and questions and
[51:49] answers said brother branham please
[51:51] explain how a person knows if he's
[51:53] thinking his own thoughts or if the
[51:55] devil is placing thoughts in his mind to
[51:57] make him think wrong especially if you
[52:00] know you don't want to thank them
[52:04] amen so it does matter if you're wanting
[52:06] to thank them or or if you're dwelling
[52:08] on them but if you don't want to thank
[52:10] them this is the answer he said if it's
[52:12] contrary to the word it's the devil's
[52:15] thinking
[52:19] amen if it's contrary to the word it's
[52:22] the devil's thinking but if it's with
[52:25] the word it's god's thinking
[52:28] if it's the wrong thoughts it's the
[52:30] devil
[52:32] so let's put it where it belongs amen if
[52:34] a thought comes through your mind every
[52:36] one of us has thoughts
[52:38] either that or we're dead remember we
[52:40] all have thoughts we all have things
[52:42] that comes through our mind but if it's
[52:44] the wrong thing it's the devil's
[52:46] thinking
[52:48] hallelujah if it's good thoughts of the
[52:51] word and of god it's god's thinking the
[52:53] very next question if the case may be
[52:56] that the devil is placing thoughts in
[52:58] your mind about a certain thing how may
[53:00] it be i over i can overcome or get rid
[53:03] of it he says take the very opposite or
[53:07] vice versa of it
[53:10] if the devil makes you think if you know
[53:12] you're a christian if you know what
[53:14] god's done for you but he tries to make
[53:16] you think you're not a christian just
[53:18] take the other opposite side and say i
[53:21] am a christian
[53:24] amen as long as your experience is
[53:26] matching god's word say i am experienced
[53:29] and anything else the same way
[53:32] you say i'm a christian i'm saved i'm
[53:35] delivered i'm set free
[53:41] hallelujah when you answer this he said
[53:44] please pray for me to overcome this as
[53:46] i'm not by myself how many could say yes
[53:48] that's true god grant you overcoming
[53:50] every who you are may your thoughts just
[53:53] go right back to the other side and say
[53:56] i am a christian i am a believer satan
[53:59] you don't have no hold on me
[54:04] come on now satan i am delivered i am
[54:08] set free god done something for me god
[54:11] saved me he touched me i know he did
[54:18] but all the while those other thoughts
[54:20] are trying to come through what are you
[54:21] doing you're taking them captive by the
[54:24] word of god and you're saying that's not
[54:26] my fault that's the devil's thoughts
[54:29] that's not my thinking that's the
[54:31] devil's thinking that's not who i am
[54:34] that's who he is
[54:38] so literally the devil trying to put a
[54:40] thought in your mind he's only telling
[54:42] you who he is
[54:44] defeated
[54:45] bound
[54:47] going to hell
[54:48] not going to make it
[54:51] hallelujah
[54:52] amen that is the devil's thinking
[54:56] he has those thoughts every day he deals
[54:59] with those thoughts every day i have an
[55:01] end i'm not going to make it i'm going
[55:04] to burn in hell god's word has said so
[55:10] but you on the other hand you turn back
[55:12] to god's thinking i've already made it
[55:15] i'm already saved i'm already delivered
[55:18] i'm already set free
[55:27] satan you have no
[55:29] hold on me
[55:31] how many can say that tonight satan you
[55:34] have no hope
[55:41] now listen to this he says frankly i'm
[55:44] standing right here saying the same
[55:47] thing
[55:50] to keep from fainting right here in the
[55:52] pulpit
[55:53] that's right five or four times i've
[55:55] almost pitched over in the pulpit that's
[55:57] the truth god knows that's right so the
[55:59] prophet himself was dealing with the
[56:01] devil's thoughts
[56:07] amen
[56:10] what am i supposed to do well
[56:12] finally brother whatsoever things are
[56:14] true
[56:15] what sort of things are honest
[56:16] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[56:18] things are pure whatsoever things are
[56:20] lovely what sort of things are of a good
[56:23] report if there be any virtue if there
[56:25] be any praise
[56:27] think on these things
[56:32] think on these things
[56:34] amen see divine healing is what the
[56:36] prophet of god said divine healing lays
[56:38] at calvary the only thing that you can
[56:40] do is point to calvary that's where your
[56:42] salvation lays you wasn't saved just 5
[56:45] years 10 years 20 years ago however long
[56:48] it was you wouldn't save you was saved
[56:50] before the foundation of the world
[56:53] he came down 1900 years ago and jesus
[56:56] died at calvary and he took the sins of
[56:58] the world away and you just accept your
[57:00] salvation so many years ago but
[57:02] everything that god can do but both
[57:04] sickness and sin has already been
[57:07] appropriated in calvary
[57:10] the only thing that a minister can do is
[57:12] point you to where it's at what god has
[57:15] already did for you
[57:19] listen he said a man can come to the
[57:20] altar he can pray all night he can cry
[57:23] he can beg he can plead he can walk up
[57:25] down the floor he can make restitutions
[57:28] but until he believes and accepts it
[57:32] he is still a sinner for hebrews 3 said
[57:35] jesus christ is the high priest of our
[57:37] confession profession the same
[57:39] translation he's a high priest of our
[57:41] confession he can do nothing for you
[57:44] until first you confess he's already
[57:48] done it
[57:53] but if your life is singing out the song
[57:55] of
[57:56] i'm depressed i'm depressed
[58:00] every day that i live i'm depressed
[58:03] you'll be singing for i'm depressed i'm
[58:05] depressed every day that i live i'm
[58:07] depressed
[58:08] when i wake up in the morning when i lay
[58:10] my head to rest i want everybody to know
[58:12] i'm depressed
[58:16] i am bound i am bound every day that i
[58:19] live i am bound
[58:21] when i wake up in the morning when i lay
[58:22] my head whose thoughts are you thinking
[58:24] whose thoughts are you declaring
[58:26] whose thoughts are you speaking
[58:30] the only way the devil has power over
[58:32] you by his thoughts is when you put him
[58:34] into actions or into words
[58:40] he's a high priest so you have to accept
[58:42] he's already done it and he will make
[58:44] good anything that's included in his
[58:47] atonement oh hallelujah and there he was
[58:50] wounded for our transgression bruised
[58:51] for our iniquity the chastisement our
[58:54] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[58:56] we are healed not will be or we ought to
[58:59] have been we were past tense already
[59:02] healed god did it back there at calvary
[59:04] the only thing to do is reach for it
[59:06] receive it by faith believe it and
[59:09] confess it
[59:12] amen
[59:15] brother would deal with negative
[59:17] testimonies
[59:20] he says if your number's called tonight
[59:23] and if god reveals to your heart and
[59:25] speaks to you and gives you deliverance
[59:27] here
[59:28] don't you ever
[59:29] have no kind of another testimony only
[59:32] that he healed you
[59:36] because if you do the one time you
[59:39] testify to the other side the negative
[59:42] side it'll come back to you worse than
[59:44] it ever was
[59:47] that's healing that's any kind of thing
[59:49] you want to put there
[59:51] amen whatever depression anxieties fears
[59:54] all those kind of things once you start
[59:56] giving testimony and actions toward that
[59:58] it'll come back worse than it ever was
[1:00:01] he said don't you ever have a negative
[1:00:03] testimony he said let him that's weak
[1:00:06] say
[1:00:10] amen just say in your heart say i'm
[1:00:12] strong say it with your mouth i'm strong
[1:00:17] i've now accepted jesus as my healer and
[1:00:20] never ever ever have a negative
[1:00:22] testimony anymore just believe it god's
[1:00:25] under obligation to bring it to pass
[1:00:31] because he's the high priest of your
[1:00:32] confession to make good before the
[1:00:34] father anything that he died for and
[1:00:36] you're confessing
[1:00:39] it goes another place says healing is
[1:00:40] not something you just say well
[1:00:42] yeah i believe it i believe it he said
[1:00:43] that's all right that's just the best
[1:00:45] you can do mentally just say yes i see
[1:00:47] it i believe it i accept it that if you
[1:00:49] accept it on those bases keep saying it
[1:00:52] over and over
[1:00:55] say it out loud
[1:00:57] say it over and over keep saying i'm
[1:01:00] healed i'm healed i'm healed
[1:01:03] keep saying it till you actually believe
[1:01:06] it
[1:01:08] so this works on the other side too if
[1:01:10] you keep saying i'm lost i'm lost i
[1:01:13] don't have god then you're going to get
[1:01:15] to the point you actually believe you're
[1:01:17] lost and there's no hope for you and
[1:01:19] there's no coming back for you you went
[1:01:21] through too far he'll take you down a
[1:01:23] long dark path
[1:01:26] but if you'll turn back the other way
[1:01:28] and begin to speak i'm a child of god
[1:01:30] god called me by name he i am his friend
[1:01:33] i am his son i am his daughter and he'll
[1:01:36] bring you back towards the light till it
[1:01:39] becomes no more what you just say but it
[1:01:42] is what you believe and therefore
[1:01:44] becomes who you are
[1:01:49] say it until you believe it
[1:01:51] and then when you believe it then it's
[1:01:52] going to take place don't
[1:01:54] have a negative testimony
[1:02:01] listen
[1:02:02] the worst thing you can do to come to be
[1:02:04] prayed for is to come up and give a
[1:02:06] negative testimony
[1:02:10] well brother timothy i'm just going
[1:02:12] through such a dark time and
[1:02:15] i just don't know what i'm going to do
[1:02:17] i just don't know if i'm ever going to
[1:02:19] get you're not ever going to get out of
[1:02:21] it
[1:02:24] you're going to go back and you're going
[1:02:25] to be worse
[1:02:28] well i'm just i'm telling you i'm just
[1:02:30] old and i'm tired and i'm this and i'm
[1:02:32] that
[1:02:34] abraham was pretty old
[1:02:38] anybody in here a hundred
[1:02:42] i didn't ask if you felt like a hundred
[1:02:43] i asked if you're a hundred how many in
[1:02:45] here is a hundred years old
[1:02:47] abraham was 100 years old when he
[1:02:49] received the promise
[1:02:52] so i don't give any of us 90 85 70 65 50
[1:02:56] 50 45
[1:02:58] 40
[1:03:00] don't give us any excuse
[1:03:03] your old age is not an excuse
[1:03:07] unless you allow it to be an excuse
[1:03:09] amen your situation is not an excuse
[1:03:12] unless you allow it to be an
[1:03:14] excuse come on somebody amen abraham
[1:03:18] could have made all kinds of excuses
[1:03:20] amen it's been now 25 years how's it
[1:03:22] going to come to pass but the scripture
[1:03:24] says he got stronger
[1:03:28] not weaker he got stronger in the faith
[1:03:31] he began to confess the word of god he
[1:03:33] began to say it it's going to happen if
[1:03:35] it don't happen today it's going to
[1:03:36] happen tomorrow and if it happens
[1:03:38] tomorrow to be a greater testimony than
[1:03:40] it was today and he kept walking towards
[1:03:43] the promise
[1:03:46] he didn't have no end date he didn't
[1:03:47] know when it was going to be he just
[1:03:49] knew god said so
[1:03:52] come on somebody we don't always know
[1:03:54] the end of our trials we don't always
[1:03:56] know the end of our sickness but we know
[1:03:58] god said so he said i'm healed he said
[1:04:02] i'm delivered he said i'm a son he said
[1:04:05] i'm a daughter he said i'm his i am his
[1:04:18] some of you already may have already
[1:04:19] walked back your testimony
[1:04:22] even from sunday
[1:04:24] night listen you're not always going to
[1:04:27] have
[1:04:28] bright and sunny days
[1:04:32] you're not always going to be on a
[1:04:34] mountaintop
[1:04:37] you're not always going to be in the
[1:04:39] just a bliss of the supernatural when
[1:04:41] things are moving and it's just not the
[1:04:43] christian walk
[1:04:45] we're going to walk through the valley
[1:04:47] of the shadow of death we're going to
[1:04:49] walk through temptations and trials
[1:04:51] we're going to walk through sicknesses
[1:04:52] and trials and problems of life and
[1:04:55] family situations we're going to walk
[1:04:57] through them
[1:04:58] but wherever you're walking that does
[1:04:59] not change who god is
[1:05:01] and that does not change his word so in
[1:05:04] the valley of the shadow of death i can
[1:05:06] still praise him
[1:05:08] i can still quote his word i can still
[1:05:11] speak the word of god it doesn't matter
[1:05:13] if i can see it being fulfilled it
[1:05:15] doesn't matter if i can see it happening
[1:05:16] around me that has nothing to do with it
[1:05:19] i know his word is true
[1:05:23] and i'm going to stand on it
[1:05:26] he says every time when you confess
[1:05:29] well i still feel bad today
[1:05:31] you go right back to the same rut he was
[1:05:34] in the beginning
[1:05:38] hello somebody
[1:05:40] it's time to get out the ruts
[1:05:43] some of you been in a rut too long
[1:05:46] your spiritual life's in a rut
[1:05:51] even somebody had thoughts of a man i
[1:05:53] wish i felt like them young people felt
[1:05:54] then i can praise him listen you can
[1:05:56] praise him abraham i don't care if you
[1:05:57] feel like a young person
[1:06:01] that's an excuse
[1:06:03] that's a crutch
[1:06:06] oh my goodness let me get back over here
[1:06:10] there's a rock you'll get right back
[1:06:12] into it
[1:06:13] there's some that were prayed for last
[1:06:15] year that this year that is back in the
[1:06:17] same rut but it was worse
[1:06:19] it was a deeper rut you know why it's
[1:06:21] deeper because they've been digging and
[1:06:22] trying to spin out of the same rut
[1:06:25] spinning their wheels and spinning
[1:06:26] around throwing this dirt there and
[1:06:28] throwing that dirt there and it ain't
[1:06:29] going nowhere
[1:06:31] why because of their confession
[1:06:33] and the devil bottles them up to where
[1:06:35] they can't even praise god no more and
[1:06:37] they can't give glory to god and he
[1:06:39] bottles them up and tightens them up so
[1:06:41] tight
[1:06:42] in their confession
[1:06:45] i just i can't i can't bless nobody
[1:06:48] i can't do nothing for nobody
[1:06:52] and they can barely breathe
[1:06:54] and they can barely operate and they can
[1:06:57] barely move because he's got it wrapped
[1:06:59] up so tight
[1:07:00] and the words that come out of their
[1:07:02] mouth
[1:07:10] there's not a man or woman here that's
[1:07:12] been baptized with the holy spirit but
[1:07:13] what would start your confession i
[1:07:15] believe i lost it i believe it's gone
[1:07:17] for me and you will go right down
[1:07:21] don't never have a negative testimony
[1:07:23] testify positive jesus heal me and i'm
[1:07:25] well go you go and you'll receive your
[1:07:27] healing no matter how you're feeling if
[1:07:29] you go feeling then you're certainly
[1:07:31] going to have bad feelings but if you
[1:07:33] get back to that every time you have a
[1:07:35] negative testimony every time that you
[1:07:38] look at your symptoms you're falling
[1:07:40] right then
[1:07:43] there's not a christian in here no
[1:07:44] matter how solid you are in faith right
[1:07:46] now something happened to get a hold of
[1:07:48] you and tell you that you're not a hit
[1:07:49] christian and you start out testifying
[1:07:51] well i'm not a christian no more you
[1:07:53] drop right then you're no more christian
[1:07:55] anymore
[1:07:58] that's the power of our words as soon as
[1:08:00] you testify you're not a christian
[1:08:02] you're dropped from grace right then
[1:08:04] you're fallen
[1:08:11] he said it's a strange saying that
[1:08:12] there's so much thought of so much
[1:08:14] thought of people they say well i'm weak
[1:08:17] my faith is not very much i'm not a very
[1:08:20] good christian that's just what the
[1:08:22] devil wants you to say
[1:08:25] you're just talking his language right
[1:08:28] then
[1:08:30] you must never say that don't ever let
[1:08:33] your testimony be negative let it be
[1:08:35] positive all the time i'm saved i have
[1:08:37] god in my heart i believe him with all
[1:08:39] my heart do you believe in divine
[1:08:41] healing with all my heart
[1:08:45] let your testimony always in your
[1:08:47] thoughts everything never permit a
[1:08:50] negative thought to come in your mind if
[1:08:53] you can help it
[1:08:57] but when it starts
[1:08:59] don't entertain it
[1:09:04] sometimes you can't help it
[1:09:06] there's demons you walk when you walk
[1:09:08] through the valley of shadow death you
[1:09:09] walk into walmart you walk into places
[1:09:11] there's demons all around you
[1:09:14] and be honest with you they're not
[1:09:15] worried about those they already got
[1:09:19] but when light calls it comes walking in
[1:09:21] they realize there's something different
[1:09:22] right there and they begin to try to
[1:09:24] bring down doubts and fears and
[1:09:26] unbeliefs and things he said when it
[1:09:28] starts don't entertain it well you say i
[1:09:30] can't help thoughts for coming well
[1:09:32] that's be like the farmer said he
[1:09:33] couldn't stop a bird from flying over
[1:09:35] his place but he could sure stop them
[1:09:37] from roosting
[1:09:40] you can't help thoughts when they come
[1:09:42] but don't entertain them pass them on no

[1:13:16] may be may become effectual
[1:13:19] by the and not acknowledging
[1:13:22] by the acknowledging of every good thing
[1:13:26] which is in you in christ jesus

[1:13:32] have to speak the word of god
[1:13:34] do you always feel like it no
[1:13:36] do you always feel victorious nope do
[1:13:39] you always feel like you do after you

[1:14:00] that they always have good thoughts
[1:14:06] they ain't a preacher in this building
[1:14:09] they can raise their hands and say i
[1:14:10] always have good thoughts
[1:14:13] how many believe they got the holy ghost
[1:14:16] but they don't always have good thoughts
[1:14:20] but when that thought comes

[1:14:25] the holy ghost that little that little
[1:14:27] radar on the inside we're gonna go
[1:14:31] wrong thought
