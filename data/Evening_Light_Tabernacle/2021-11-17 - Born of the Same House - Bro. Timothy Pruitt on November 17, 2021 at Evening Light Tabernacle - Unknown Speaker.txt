you know our thoughts lord you know the things lord that we desire we just ask father you'll move up free bring healing deliverance to salvation father by your word we ask it in jesus name amen let's turn to hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13. amen it says for when god made the promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiply i will multiply thee so and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater an oath for confirmation is to them an end to of all strife wherein god willing more abundantly to show into the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek amen we'll let you be seated today i could speak to you on born of the same house born of the same house i'd like to start out with a quote that i read even wednesday night from melchizedek the great prince and king been studying this message it says faith never rushes itself faith knows what it's talking about said you've never seen our master excited about anything standing by the grave of a dead man he was just as calm as he was when he sat on the mount and looked over jerusalem standing on a troubled sea and or on a troubled ship in the troubled seas and waves being tossed about he was so completely rested in god until he never even paid attention to it enough to wake up always undisturbed faith is he said we find here that the reason we can be undisturbed because it was given to our father and to his children and god and the god who gave the promise swore by an oath that he would confirm it and keep it and that and that he has done and we find the children of abraham are not just jews outwardly but through abraham come isaac through isaac come christ through christ he has blessed the world for it is said unto abraham to and to his seed which was in christ and through there that all tribes of the earth were to be brought into this covenant we'd also read in galatians 3 and verse 27 says for as many of you has been baptized in christ you have put on christ need there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus and if you be christ then you are abraham's seed and heir according to the promise amen so if you have received the spirit of christ or the life of christ this makes you abraham see amen it makes you that you're born of the same house the same household of faith and in this house it has faith in this house it has the ability to believe in the supernatural in this house it has the ability to amen to believe in healings and deliverances and salvations if you're born of this house amen amen in your house that you was born naturally into this world you may have been born a pruitt a smith or whatever your last name would be maybe in that house there wasn't always there wasn't faith there there wasn't the ability to believe there there wasn't the faith wasn't taught or faith wasn't received but when you received this life when you received this life amen you're born of a different house amen and so therefore you have the same faith you have the same ability to hold on to the promise you have the same endurance you have the same determination amen because it's no longer a pruitt doing it it's no longer someone else doing oglesby or adams amen it's god working on the inside of you and through you amen so therefore you can have the same ability abraham had that he endured faithfully and holding on because he knew god had swore by himself and god was going to confirm the oath that he had given him amen it wasn't resting upon abraham it was resting upon god so it didn't matter if he was two years 3 years 10 years or 20 years that made no difference to abraham abraham knew god said it and in this house we believe what god says amen so we're going to have it anywhere because god said so you know if god says so that's a good reason to believe it amen so he said i can you know brother i'm so i can imagine he went and he got little things together and pens and things getting ready to have a baby why god said so no matter how impossible amen in this house there are no impossibilities amen in this house there's nothing there's no there's no sickness that is incurable there's there's no disease too great and this house that we're born of that i'm speaking of tonight is the house of god amen there's nothing that is impossible amen and so he said no matter how impossible it seems god said so that settles it so 20 years passed no baby yet but abraham still believed in god and he didn't get weaker he got stronger he kept saying pray for giving praise to god no matter how impossible it may seem that meant nothing to it amen that show you i mean if you look at the thing and you say you know it's there's no way that maybe this can happen or maybe there's nothing to it amen it shows you you need to be born again it shows you if you cannot believe for the promises of god and hold on to the promises of god no matter how many devils comes up no matter how many impossibilities comes if you can't hold on to it it shows you need to be born again amen abraham's children will hold on to the promises of god because abraham held on amen he says you know we're being dead in christ we take on abraham's seed and therefore we're heirs according to the promise that gives every believer that's been born again the same faith that abraham had amen to call what god said to be the truth and to call what your eye says or anything that contrary to the promises of god you call it a lie amen so because we don't go by sight we don't walk by sight we don't go by feelings in this house it's not a house of feelings well i got my feelings i'm worried about you need to put your feelings outside the door because in this house our feelings don't matter what matters is what god says amen we go by god's word no matter what's outside looks like we still believe it if you're abraham's seed and you're dead in christ and you receive the baptism of the holy spirit that which makes you abraham's seed and gives you the same faith that abraham had that will call those things that are not as though they are it'll call you healed even though you don't feel healed it'll call you delivered even though you feel bound and and unworthy it'll call you set free amen no matter how you look or how you feel like it's what god said about it amen abraham called those things which are not as though they were see he didn't look at the natural things neither does abraham see he didn't he looked at the unseen so does abraham's seed amen i'm not looking at the natural things even in this building amen you know we're looking at the unseen because we know in the unseen there's pillar of fire there's angels there's god moving in our midst there's things that are happening even though we may not feel like it's happening even though we may not think it's happening even though we may not want it to happen it's still happening it's because what god said god will keep it and abraham knew he would keep his word abraham's seed knows god will keep his word so he believed it he testified of things he didn't see as though it already happened amen he said i hope you get it he says i i said i hope you can grasp this he said if you can take the same thing the same faith the same determination and says god promised it amen by jesus christ stripes i'm healed i believe it no matter what takes place how i feel how i look i'm healed anyhow why because god said so and you stay right there and don't move watch what it will do i tell you what it'll do when you stand there in that kind of faith believing and confessing the word of god it'll make the blind eyes come open on a barber chair when critics are around him and telling him he needs to disbelieve but he's still saying by his stripes i'm healed and he jumps out of a barber chair amen with his eyesight again amen that's what faith of abraham will do for you if you can stand there and not waver from it amen see things wants to come and we begin to look at the waves and we begin to look at the things around us and we don't have to look at those things because that really ought not be what we're looking at amen abraham instead of getting weak well you know we said well if god don't answer right away well i failed to get it that's not abraham god didn't answer him right away he gave the promise and he said this is what's going to take place he didn't tell him it's going to be 25 years later he just said this is what's going to take place amen abraham got stronger knowing the longer it lasted the longer it took the greater miracle it's going to be oh hallelujah amen your parents have been crying out for your children don't get weaker get stronger knowing it's going to be a greater miracle god's going to do a greater thing god's going to move more in possibilities the devil may throw another one and another one another one that just means god's going to do more god's going to change the sin god's going to rewrite their lives instead of getting weak let's get stronger in the faith saying god you said it you promised it to me and i'm not backing off of what you promised it'd be a greater miracle see if you're the children of abraham you got that kind of faith abraham got stronger as the days went on amen he got weaker in his body he got maybe uh you know it seemed like more critics rose up and making fun and as even his wife was laughing and this that and the other abraham gets stronger abraham gets stronger amen if god called abraham and abraham had that kind of faith abraham's children will have the same kind of faith the only reason that abraham had that kind of faith is because god seen that quality in him and call to him and talk to him face to face and every person that's elected by god comes in and gets that same faith of abraham because you've talked face to face with god the spirit of the abraham that was rested upon abraham the spirit of christ is now living in you therefore you can take the same promises and stand toe-to-toe with the devil and say i'm not backing off of what god has given me i'm gonna hold it with everything that's gone i'm gonna press forward i'm gonna get stronger let me let you in on something this bride is not getting weaker she's not getting weaker and weaker and weaker no she's getting stronger hallelujah we're gonna see more healings more deliverances more prodigals coming home more of god's goodness being revealed to his people because we've been talking face to face with god amen there's a people that has a direct line to the throne room amen we being dead in christ take on abraham's seed and her heirs according to the promise the same promise he give abraham is the promise he gives us so he promised abraham his son how come he can't promise you your son mercy amen if we being dead in christ we take on abraham's seed and our heirs according to the same promise then the same faith that was in abraham dwells in his children who will call those things which are not as though they are because why god said so he said if we could really grab ahold of that kind of faith there not be a feeble mercen among us in the next five minutes all right friends how many receive the holy spirit ye are sons and daughters of god you are the seed of abraham join heirs with him in the kingdom and the same faith i'm gonna hammer this down the same faith that was in abraham is in every believer tonight by his amazing grace we just heard we just sung about it about his amazing grace the same one that called you out of the slop pens of the world and give you the holy ghost not because you deserved it not because you deserve it but he called you to it unconditionally he didn't call you because you deserved it he didn't call you because you were born in a certain family he called you unconditionally he didn't call you because he was free of drugs he didn't call you because you was free of sin he called you because you were his listen you didn't you wasn't his at the altar you were his before the foundation of the world that ought to give you something to shout about amen i was his before i ever smoked a cigarette i was his before i ever did a drug i was his before i ever committed one sin [Applause] he didn't call abraham because he was some worthy person he caused abraham because he was his son god by his amazing grace called you out of the slop pen of the world give you the holy ghost not because you deserved it but because he calls you called you to it unconditionally not because you were good not because your mother was saved but you was called by god's elected grace oh senator friend he says if you're here lukewarm church remember these things that you see going on the holy spirit making manifest the resurrection of jesus it's the covenant that god said and poured it out through christ the saying very same things that i do shall you do also even more than this for i go to my father a little while and the world will see me no more yet ye shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world oh my the holy spirit is not a guest so it's not a maybe so it's not a probably so it's not i'm guessing at it but i know jesus christ lives i know he reigns i know he's the same yesterday today and forever and his holy spirit is in this place tonight to do the very same things he did while he was on earth oh hallelujah he met abraham and he gave him the covenant and it wasn't a covenant that said abraham you do certain things and then i'm going to do a certain thing you do this and then i'll do that no his covenant with abraham was i've already done it it's already done it's already been fixed amen hey i've already made the covenant with you i'm going to save you i'm going to bring you home with your father at a ripe old age nothing you can do about it i've already done it you say well brother if i only had god to say that to me he said wait a minute god said abraham and his seed after him so you have had it god say that to you because he said it to abraham and your seed after you we don't establish it we are the seed of abraham amen so he's given you the same covenant that he gave abraham because you've been born in the same house it's an unconditional covenant it's not that you got to do something and i'm going to do it you got to do this and i'm going to do it you got to be this and then i'll do it you know i've already done it i've already provided healing i've already provided deliverances i've already provided amen a way back for the prodigal i've already done it i just need somebody to believe what i've already done we are the seed of abraham the same faith that abraham has come to us by the baptism of the holy spirit that's the reason we can believe in divine healing because we're of the same household amen you know it's the spirit of the living god that's in the church that gives it the faith that abraham had so if the spirit of god is not there then the faith of abraham will not be there amen call to be able to call those things which are not as though they are because god said so there's a covenant that god made so what did he do as he did with abraham he would tear apart the animals and he would lay them in half god did the same thing he tore christ apart and he took his body and he set it on the right side of him and sent the other part back the holy ghost down to earth to baptize the church with the same faith to give him the same faith that he had to do the same for works that he did the same thing that i do shall ye do also so he has not left you here to perform the word he has come himself inside of you to do the work in you it's the same faith producing the same words the same signs the same wonders the same glory amen men are not infallible so i'm thankful he didn't put this all on a fickle man good lands if our salvation depended upon a man as far as a a man you know a sin born man i'll put it that way man born of sin and he can make a decision today you know what it'd be one day he'd love you the next day he wouldn't he'd love you as long as you did this dotted every eye and you crossed every team you bowed down you've done this that and the other he would love you all the way but until when you cross something then that love will change amen but that ain't god the many of us gave god millions of reasons not to love us but he still loves you he gave us millions of reasons not to he gave him millions of reasons not to call us out of sin and out of darkness but he still did it anyhow oh hallelujah because his covenant is not on a fickle man but it's on an unchangeable god and this god cannot lie so if god called you he's not going to change his mind about you he could have changed his mind about abraham abraham gave him plenty of reasons to change his mind he went down to egypt he done all kinds of things but that it wasn't dependent on abraham as depending on what god said so god would work it back around to his to the to his word could be fulfilled and abraham and that's exactly what he does in our life now you may go through some horrible times in your life because your own stubborn self but god will work you back around to perform his word in you i'm thankful for that i'm thankful he didn't give up because i gave him plenty of chances to give up on me amen our faith is not in the wisdom of man but our faith rests in the power and the word of god that's where the true seed of abraham rests their promises because they can only be the seed of abraham by the holy spirit without the holy spirit they're not the seed of abraham but when they have that spirit the same faith that was in abraham comes into the believer and no matter what comes about the believer still believes a man still marches on we can see this same the same path all the way through the bible you can look at it you can see it what household they were really quick amen we can see that the 10 spies or other 12 spies that went to come back with a good report and 10 with a bad report but only two of them's report lined up with the word of god the other 10 was their own report and what they saw and what they believed they totally did away with what god had said but the other two said it doesn't matter what i saw it matters what god said so it showed very quickly whose house they were born of come on now when you get somebody that says you know god doesn't heal no more the days of miracles are past and god doesn't do those kind of things it shows you really quick whose house they're born of if they're born of the seed of god they would know he's the same yesterday today and forever but we see it as they come back on that from that report there's giants over there and great big governments and spears my goodness they got chariots and we look like grasshoppers in god's report i never did see you mention one thing about how big the walls was or how many chariots they had or how big their spears was or or if they were if you're going to look like grasshoppers in there that wasn't in god's report amen but joshua amen was born of a different house then these other 10 spies and he jumped up and he said man and brethren not only are we able to go over and take the land we've been made more than abel amen why because he was a seed of abraham and god gave the promise it was my his possession and god gave it it didn't matter what the opposition was a true seed will take it no matter how bad it looks or how impossible it looks brother adam said well now there stands at that same place there stands that today the church of the living god i don't care what anybody says what the doctor says what an unbeliever says we are more than a match for anything that comes along what shall we say to these things if god be for us who can be against us amen that's where we stand no we are more than a match because we are abraham's seed and we will possess we will take hold we will not let go therefore healing is our salvation is our the holy ghost is ours there can be thousands of preachers that says it ain't so but the cedar abraham knows it's so oh they'll wait right into it they'll possess it no matter what takes place his seed is going to take it amen there joshua stood this little fellow seemingly standing all by himself him and caleb i don't care how big they are i don't care what kind of spear they got i don't care how high their cities are how great it is our promise is this is our land let's go take our land we're more than a match for them a lot of them that was born of natural seed said well we just can't do it there's no need of trying we're outnumbered we're outclassed we're everything they were looking at what their eyes saw instead of what god said and this is where you'll know if you're still of natural seed you rely on what you see right here or what your mind can put together or how you can figure it all out with your human abilities and human understanding and you'll totally discredit what god said and or not even bring it into the equation it ain't what god said is not the equation what god said is the answer to the equation amen what god said is is the ultimate final it doesn't matter if some other scholar can come along and show you that this map adds all up and his brother brother joe's been preaching so wonderfully on impossible math and adds all up to a different answer that matters not what matters is what god said and that is the final answer and if he said it's your land then it's your land if he said it's your healing then it's your healing it doesn't matter how many devils line up and say it ain't so it doesn't matter how many uh false prophets arise and say it ain't so if it's your land and god said it's your land it is it's so it doesn't matter what anybody else says the seed of abraham doesn't look at natural things they look at what the lord said whose report are you going to believe what if abraham would have looked at the natural and a woman now 90 years old he was a hundred been with her since she was a little girl him a little boy no seed yet he didn't look at those things he said he counted those things as though they were not for he only looked at what god said i'll bless you abraham and i'll give you a seed by sarah he believed it you don't have to look at the opposition you look at what god says amen but we we find that you know the child didn't arrive till 25 years later but as we've been hammering instead of getting weaker he got stronger i mean i know the promise of the coming of the lord is seemingly delayed and it's further and further and further and you know people's come up with dates for years and numbers come to pass but that don't mean there ain't a date there is a date no man knoweth the hour but there is an hour no man know at the time but there is a time amen so it doesn't matter about what's going on but it ought to make our expectations greater not minimize it make it greater amen not make it less make it more if sarah was one month older it ought to be one more month one month greater in expectation because god is going to keep his word it wouldn't be a lot better to her for her to have a child at 100 or 60 it wouldn't matter but it's greater miracle all the time so you don't get weaker you get stronger and we are the seed of abraham the bible said and we're dead in christ and we take on abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise of abraham because abraham was given that promise and we are the same heirs that he was amen but born of this house of the same house the same house of faith or the household of faith or or the body of christ or or or the building of the lord of this house your natural seed cannot believe in the in the supernatural you know it's nothing really in a natural thing to believe or otherwise even esau or some of the others but jacob and those along that line or that lineage of abraham the promise was flowing through they were able to believe the supernatural signs that were taking place amen why because there was something on the inside of them you know they you know there has to be a supernatural seed to be born of the supernatural to have the same faith amen born not by natural birth but by supernatural birth by supernatural faith amen a faith that is supernatural or that supersedes the natural that goes beyond what a natural eye can see or our natural heart can believe amen it goes beyond all of that and it'll hold it hold on to it for years time doesn't matter to god's word it may look like it's full of moth balls may look like it's moss growing over it but it's still there just as true as it ever was amen god looking for people to believe in the supernatural so the covenant was given to abraham unconditionally not abraham if you do this then i'll do that but i've already done it we have the same covenant it's already done it's not what we do it's what he did it's not what we are it's what he's done for us it's nothing that we could do or our own merit to merit anything or you know to be righteous enough or to be good enough the only thing we can do is accept and be grateful for what he's already done that's why we can sing amazing grace amazing grace it's not just grace it's amazing grace because i knew what i used to be i knew what i used to do i i knew where i knew i used to dwell at and the things i used to dwell on i knew all of that if you knew like i knew what he done for me if i knew like you knew what he done for you you could look at that and say that is not just grace that's amazing grace that's unmerited grace i didn't deserve what i got but he still gave it to me anyway [Music] lebron was saying like this he said i'm positive that many times in people's thinking they try to make divine healing some great outreach in something if i could only reach it he said could you imagine jesus said let me check my faith and see if i got enough faith to do this see if i have to fast a while to see if i have enough faith to do he was unconscious of the faith he had he just spoke it and knew it was going to be so he said just like you're coming from your homes today you probably want to return to your home told your wife and loved ones when you went to work or whatever today i'll be back sometimes right afternoon or about five o'clock whatever time you get off how do you know you are you're not trying to figure it out do i get enough faith to get back home have i got enough faith to drive my car no you just unconsciously turn your key on and drive away and go home it's an unconscious faith that does that that's the way it is christ in christ we are unconscious we just say that's his word that settles it there's no more to it and you just go home and be well so you don't worry about it you go home and be well you say well brother timothy at me when i get home i'll be well no it might be five weeks might be five months might be five years could be five minutes but abraham received the promise after he patiently endured he obtained the promise this is the house we're born of you know i had a neighbor one time he's passed on now but he said he'd say to me all the time tell me i pray to god for patience and i tell them i want it right now that ain't always how it works abraham patiently enduring enduring as seeing what an unvisible god as though he's visible standing right before him after he endured the hard test and the hard trial and the hard fight he inherited the promise you know it looked like god would have spoken and he'd reach down and he would have done it right away he could have done that he could have worked it right out he goes abraham i'm going to give you a son he went right home amen and had the son but god don't always work that way but the children of abraham will believe no matter if it's five minutes five weeks five years or whatever long it is god said it i believe it look at hannah another seat of abraham amen born of the same household when she was at the temple and she was praying and eli come out and said that she thought she was drunk she said i'm not drunk i'm praying that god will take away my reproach and he said the lord god grant thee thy request god could have placed little samuel in hannah's arms right there he's a creator he can do all things he can just speak it into existence he could have put that baby into our arms but instead of that it was a process of time maybe nine months maybe 12 months maybe whatever he could have done it instantly but he didn't do it yesterday he just gave her the promise that he would isaiah 40 and verse 28 said hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary and there's no searching of his understanding in other words he's probably got it figured out better than you do so why you tore up about it rest in his promise he knows the perfect time to move he knows the perfect time to answer we want it right now and it's a lot easier on us the west because that's why we want it now because it's easier right but god don't always do it that way he'll let you go through treatments he'll let you go through tests and surgeries and all kinds of things but that doesn't change his word that doesn't change who he is he giveth power to the faint and to them that might that have no might he increases strength oh hallelujah so if you feel wore out tonight he's got something for you even the youth shall fade and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength and they shall mount up with wings as eagles and they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not face hallelujah that's the faith of abraham working in the believer so when god told moses when he started out to go to the promised land all that all that promise he said i give abraham years ago is all walled up by the philistines and jericho and all kinds of great people the warriors now it's all yours there's amorites there and there's havits there and there's parasites there and there's juvenites there and there's philistines there and there's all kinds of things there there's cancer there there's sugar diabetes there there's sin there and there's all kind of issues there there's all kind of problems there but i give it to you it's your land grown up with weeds and it's been untaken care of for seven seven church ages but i'm giving it to you i'm giving you this land it's yours but you got to go take it you got to go possess it you got to go do something with it you got to grab your sword and go after your believer go after your promise go after the things that you want and i'm so sick of the church being backed into a corner it's time we go on the offensive i i i gotta let that run through my mind many times brother josh shared our meetings a couple years ago talking about muhammad ali and being on the ropes remember that in the seventh round it was time to get off the ropes for 66 years 6 000 years the church has been on the roads but in this age it's time to get off the ropes it's time to go take what is yours it's time to say devil i've had enough of you being on my property this is mine just saith the lord this is mine my inheritance my children i'll give it to you it's yours now go possess it he said i hope you see it it's something i want to get your faith to where it belongs he said many people got faith that they only know how to put it to work he said benjamin franklin one time found electricity story is i wasn't there but apparently the story is he flew a kite up into electrical storm had something some kind of metal on it it popped him pretty good and he said i got it i got it but he didn't know what he had and along came thomas edison said it'll work and we'll find something that it'll work through and he tried thousands of wires and yet he found a wire that would finally carry the electricity through the wire he knew it was the power and the power would work and our benefit he said we found salvation will save us from sin we found it would take the violence woman or the violence man the drunkard the prostitute and make them a child of god if that same faith and that same power will lift up a fallen man or woman like that it'll work for us in more ways than that it'll heal bodies it'll move mountains it'll change lives hallelujah he said see it's like if i had a i had a farm on one side of the hill and it's full of corn but it was dying from the lack of water and on the other side was artesian well and if i could make that artesian well throw water down there up on this side of the hill to water that corn he said what happens i gotta survey that land i gotta find out that that water will take its own current and of course and it'll come around and water the crop if it'll if it'll do it if i'll just let it run in its own channel that's the same thing with the holy spirit in god's promise if we'll just let it run its way not us get in the way not us throw our doubts in there and cause it didn't do that it didn't do this and it didn't happen what i thought it would just let god's holy spirit work in you and you rest on the promise and while you rest it'll work it'll do what god said it would do oh my it's what abraham did abraham received the promise a hundred years old and he rested on el shaddai which means the breasted one the strength giver brother branham would talk about it being as a woman would take a young suckling child to herself and it would nurse and gain strength this is what abraham did he just began to nurse from the strength giver he wouldn't dwell on his doubts he'd pull from the strength river hello somebody that'll help you with a lot of your mind battles if you quit dwelling on them and you start pulling from the strength giver those mind battles are designed to tear your strength down amen to tear your life down to tear your hopes down to tear your everything about you down but if you'll take your mind off of that and put it back on the strength giver hallelujah amen and start nursing from the promises of god and the things of god like a baby to his mother and strength for the baby we do the same thing when we come to god and we see his promise and we lay ourselves right into that promise and we draw from the word the strength of god and given in its own course not our mind just believing it and after we endured we shall obtain the promise the same thing works for salvation it's the same thing that works for divine healing he said surely i will bless thee and we'll multiply thee we see that he can said he said in our scripture he swore by a greater an oath as confirmation confirmed as an end-all god swore to abraham that he would keep his covenant with him and with the seed forever he swore by himself that he would do it and in doing so under the old law he made an oath under the old law he killed an animal animal cut it in two and then old law they would take that host stand between the animals they'd write on up out on a piece of paper a certain contract and they'd tear it apart give one to one another to the other and god having no other no one greater to swear by he swore by himself and he took himself to calvary and he tore his body apart and he lifted up his body to sit on the right hand and send it back send back the holy spirit to being every believer hello every believer to do the same thing in every church and every believer he did in christ when he was here on earth proven that he would raise him up in the last days and set him with him in his own kingdom and today to see the same holy spirit that is upon jesus christ working the same in the church confirming the word exactly the same he proved it by the immutability of his counsel that there was two immutable things which one being impossible for god to lie that we might have a strong consolation and have fled for a refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us we can see what a marvelous promise god cannot lie and be god therefore what he said in his word he has to bring to pass or therefore he's not god but we have seen him bring it to pass time after time after time after time if there's any fault it's in us not in god for god is obligated to his word brother would say it like this said somebody said he said somebody said to him said the holy ghost wasn't given it was only given to the 12 apostles on the day of pentecost you know it's funny they're trying to say that again today say well then what about the 120 that was in the same time when they received it how about those down at the house of cornelius when the gentiles received it how about 33 years later when paul asked the baptist if they had received the holy ghost since they believed and he laid his hands upon them and they received the holy ghost setting the church in corinthian order he said in the church at that time apostles prophets teachers evangelists gifts of healing all those marvelous gifts years and years before beyond pentecost and today it's to every believer go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature how far all the world how many all people and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be down and these signs shall follow them that by their belief in my name they shall cast out devils and heal the sick there you are the promise to every believer it's god's promise that he swore he would do it no matter how many tries to rise up and counterfeit it or say it ain't so or try to contradict it and take it down and ripe it off it's god's word it's not man's word therefore we have a great hope a faith an anchor of the soul that's what's in this house there's an anchor in in your house it may be a double-minded man i don't know but in this house there's an anchor in your house you might think one way one day and think another another way but in this house there's an anchor that the storms may rage and the storms may blow and the wind may come against the boat but there's an anchor there's a holding place there's a line that holds it it may flip around one way and the other you may not can see land you may not can see things around you makes me so dark but there's an anchor that goes down amen to the bottom of the sea and it catches upon a rock and every person that's received jesus christ as a personal savior been born again with the holy spirit you have dropped an anchor if you're sick amen and your hope is built on christ you have dropped an anchor the doctor may say this and the doctor may say that but that doesn't move you because you have dropped an anchor critics may rise this one may start a youtube channel that one may do this but it doesn't bother you you have stopped an anchor [Applause] that's what's in this house what have you got your hopes built on the doctor says it may be gone medicine says it can't do nothing surgery says it's failed but my hope's not built on that we have our hope within the veil through the shedding of his blood that tore his spirit from his body to where we can have the same promises and we can hold on to the same things amen we have an anchor it's steadfast it's unmovable it holds when everything around us is moving everything around us is changing how quickly as our society changing even the last amen a few months much less years things are changing so quick but god's word don't change government's change but god's word don't change man's minds change but god's word don't change churches doctrines can change but god's word don't change preachers can change but god's word don't change it's steadfast it's unmovable it holds it's steadfastness it may the doctor may say there's no hope for you not a hope for you to live but that don't change nothing you know you already died a long time ago therefore you can't die what kind of assurance did abraham have what kind of assurance did sarah have they had what god said they believed what god said we can read in our scripture that he was a forerunner jesus was a forerunner that entered in for us he's the forerunner of what he's the forerunner of our salvation physically and spiritually for he was wounded for our transgression he's bruised for our iniquity the chastisement our peaceful opponent and with his stripes we're healed the forerunner of our salvation and healing is already entered in what is a forerunner it's something that's forerunning something that's coming it's a wave sheath it's something that's saying there's more to come just like me so he's already forerunned our coming that he has another body just like his glorious body it's the bride of jesus christ and she will overcome as he overcome she will rise above it as he arose above it she'll walk on the winds in the way she'll walk over every devil come on somebody she'll walk over cancer she'll walk over every disease of every kind she'll walk over every drug and every addiction she'll walk over it all right because he did it the father of this house did it therefore the children of this house can do the same because the same blood that run through the father now runs to the children by the spirit of that's god bless us hope blessed hope we have that christ the full runner has already come something that runs before or goes ahead an example of a church that the church would do what he did that the church would finish what he started or continue his works after he completed his sacrifice at calvary a forerunner and that's why he would say a little while the world will see me no more but you shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world so we could see abraham we don't have time to get all into this but we can say abrahams he's called out he brings his daddy he brings lot he brings all things he wasn't even that wasn't even called and we see things that had to be separated off of his life for him to obtain the promise brother branham would say it like this he says he said i hope this finds a resting place but maybe the reason some of you are not getting along so well you're holding on to things we ought to let go of there's got to be a separation maybe it's a doubt or a little wonder or a little skeptic wonder if it's right could this be could that be how cut loose from all of that lay aside every weight and sin that so easily beset you and run the race looking under jesus christ the author and finisher of our faith what we see is lot he he went down towards sodom and we know the story and this is where i'm coming down to i got down there and and and sodom and gomorrah and and there was some kings that rose up and they came and took him and took him out and his family with him and abraham heard of it and abraham said i got to go after him my brother has been taken he said look what brother i said look what lord had done to him look what would have taken place but look look at the heart of abraham i got to go back and get him see abraham's brother was taken captive and so he armed his trained servants his trained servants born of his own house 318 born of his own house hey brother adam said why did abraham not go get somebody else to help him fight why did he not go and ask some country next to him or some king somewhere or someplace somewhere to align themselves but he found men born of his own house he said because they had the same faith abraham had so therefore they would fight like abraham would fight they would believe like abraham would believe they would go and take back what was rightfully theirs they wouldn't sit back and say well we came we got part of it and we're okay we're going to go back now no they wasn't satisfied with getting just part of it they wanted all of it they wanted it all back hey man he said see went and got men of his own house oh my he had enough servants to fight an army with and he pursued them and took it all back brought back all the goods bought back everything lot had all his goods all the women all the people everyone why because he found people that would believe just like he believes he said abraham his brother had gone a lot his brother hadn't gone astray he said but see abraham a picture of the true church or a true believer of god that's blessed of god and has the promise of god as the covenant of god has faith in the covenant he said if you'll count here there's about 10 or 15 kings out there that abraham had to face how many servants did they have abraham counted that he had all that he had was faithful and born in his own house born in his own house the faithful servants he could depend upon it was his servants who had come under the same circumcision he had come under and was included in the same promise he was included in he said it's a perfect picture of christ and the church the holy spirit leading the faithful ones that has been born in the same house of the holy ghost where christ was born out and is pursuing after the wayward why i keep preaching about the prodigals because i'm pursuing after them i'm not giving up on one of them they're all coming home we're not leaving a hook behind i've been born in the same house the house of abraham so if he can go after the backslidden i can go after the backslidden well come on now amen pursuing after the wayward pursuing after the blacks the backslidden and listen to this and slaying every evil thing that's overcome them [Applause] hallelujah do we have some servants here that's been born of the same house that has the same faith under the same sign of seal of circumcision and you're willing to go and say let me go after that one devil you had them long enough that's a child of god take your dirty rotten hands off of me i'm coming after them in the name of jesus christ i believe it's time that the servants of god start sharpening your swords start sharpening your sores and saying we got enough of depression we got enough of anxiety we got enough of things that is tearing down the house of god i'm going after in jesus name just like we heard sunday there's uh there's servants of the house of abraham that are willing to defend the rights of the lamb [Applause] somebody want to come up and say there's no such thing as worship there's no such thing as being happy in the house of god and joy in the house of god i got a sword for that amen i have the right to be as joyful as abraham was joyful when he received the promise when i receive it i got a right to be joyful i've been born in the same house oh my slaying every evil thing i have seen right here servants of abraham take their swords and walk down and cut a lot lust off of people's lives cut addictions off of people's lives cut pornography right off got it right to it he said what is it you begin he said overcoming sin laying aside all weight speaking to people about their lusts and things they're doing and cut it all off their sicknesses and all preaching to them the gospel and bringing them back to the full fellowship with god my my my that's what we got to do that's why we got to fight for our god-given rights because as we heard sunday the devil wants to come in and take it from us make you sit down make you shut up make you you know worry about who's seeing what who's saying what no no i'm worried about his rights i'm a defender of those rights because i'm of the same house and they ain't the house of pruitt's or the house of paris's or the house of patents or house of butts or tuschner's or masons her atoms or oglesbees or dexters twiners it's not that house it's the house of god and in his house we got a right to worship him and in his house we've got a right to have an atmosphere and a place that prodigals can come home and give their heart to god in his house are you born of that house that you're willing to say you know what i got to go after that one right there the devil's had them long enough brother aaron just this witness this past meeting sat here up on this platform waiting for one the lord had spoke to him about it and he waited and he waited thoughts all kinds of thoughts but they that weighed upon the lord and he girded himself with the sword and he went after is there any more servants of abraham that's been born of the same house that says you know what i have a right to go after my loved ones as power ins cut their sicknesses off cut off the things that bind them spirits of every kind cut them off so i i don't know i'm not much well you may not be but god's a whole lot and if god before you who can be against you it's a perfect picture of christ the holy spirit leading the faithful that's born of the same house the house of the holy ghost where christ was born pursuing after the wayward and the backslidden and slaying every evil thing that overcome them got a commission whose house are you of are you of the household of faith the same faith that abraham had the same patience enduring holding on thank god for healing me are you healed thank god for healing me you're still blind thank god for healing me you still can't see thank god for healing me whose house are you born of you still don't look good yeah i know i don't i don't know if it's going to happen i don't know if it'll be today i don't know
