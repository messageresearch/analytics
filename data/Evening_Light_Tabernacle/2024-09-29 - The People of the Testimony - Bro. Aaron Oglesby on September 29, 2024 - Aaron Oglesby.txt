be open to receive what you're speaking today anoint the word we pray father as we look to you now and ask you to have complete preeminence we thank you Father for this wonderful atmosphere Lord that we feel in this place and we just ask that your will be done now in Jesus name amen and amen isn't it good to be in the house of God this morning amen we sure love him we love his people love his word amen just ask if you have your bibles if you'll turn with me to the Book of Revelation we're going to read from Revelation 10:7 and then also we're going to read from a place in Revelation 12 you know I was I was a little bit off with my slide work Wednesday night got a little confused and a couple times and I I have a niece Katie I when she runs the uh the words for the songs I like to pick on her afterwards even when she does a good job I'll be like you know if you're going to be that slow I might as well have a song book you know it's not true it's just how I so so she texted me Wednesday after service and said you know the slides were okay but if you're going to be that slow you know I'm might as well keep my Bible but she's picking on me a little bit I'm going to try to I'm going to try to not confuse y'all today with the slides so if you have your Bible let's read in Revelation 10:7 we're going to speak to you today on the people of the testimony the people of the testimony Revelation 10:7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets so however you read this no matter what language no matter what translation we know there has to be a seventh angel we know he's going to sound and we know it's going to fulfill the Mysteries it's going to finish it amen verse eight and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had seen it my had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings and if you'll look with me also in Revelation 12:7 and it says here and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven listen we could close our Bibles right now and be blessed knowing that the war he's fighting he's a loser yes Satan prevails not whether it's in your life whether it's in heaven whether it's here battling against the bride he prevails not amen verse 9 says and the great J Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death amen I pray that the Lord will add His blessings to the word as you take your seats this morning we're going to focus in a lot today on that last verse and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death I know these are very familiar scriptures that we've read scriptures that we know are applicable to us in this day amen scriptures that have been fulfilled and scriptures that that are being currently fulfilled because we know that that we live in in in in the in the days of the seventh angel a time when the word has been restored to its fullness by the message of Malachi 4 amen we believe that's been fulfilled in this day the the Mysteries have been finished and we believe by the word that there there's a people on Earth today that have been and are being prepared for the return of the Lord amen I believe that's what this is all about we're not just Gathering to hang out we're not just Gathering to hear good words sing good songs although we enjoy those things we're Gathering and we're listening and we're feeding on the word to be prepared for the coming of the Lord that's the whole point of everything that we do amen and we are to be a people that are sold out to the the word not to our own ideas we all have ideas you know sometimes I think it gets misconstrued and and we say things like well you know you're not supposed to have opinions right sure you're allowed to have opinions sure you're allowed to have ideas but if your opinions and your ideas don't line up to the word I I would say we need to change our opinions and we need to change our ideas amen this is the thinking man's filter so so it's not not not sold out to our own ideas and not to what the church says but there's a people on Earth today that seek to do only his will and what is his will his word is his will so there's a people on Earth looking to live by the word and fulfill the word and do all that the word declares of them amen and I believe that these people are the Overcomers of Revelation 3:21 it says to him that overcometh so this is right here at the end of the church ages when he says this so we know that somebody coming out of the leot toan age the last age the most wicked age somebody's going to overcome somebody's going to sit on the throne he says to him that I overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down in my father's Throne one thing I want us to cue in here in this moment is we're going to overcome even as he overcame not just the exact same result although that's what it's talking about but we're going to do it the way he did it it you're going to overcome even as I did you're going to do it the way that I did it amen so we're going to get into that as we go and I I believe this morning that I'm talking to a group of people who are a part of these Overcomers and we're not all of them there's Overcomers from all over the world you don't have to go to evening light Tabernacle to be an overcomer but you do have to be somebody that's sold out to the word of God and filled with the spirit they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb the word of their testimony if you fit in that category then you'll fit in this category right here as Overcomers of the age amen people sold out to the word that that that's what we are we're we're people who don't who don't give in to the pressures of the age people who aren't infected with the evil that permeates man's thinking today you say evil permeates man's thinking of course Evil's permeating man's thinking thinking that says men can be women and women can be amen we're not we're not going to be affected by that thinking that that Biblical teaching and biblical roles are bigotry in this day if you believe that then you're just you're a bigot thinking that the type of thinking that would call good evil and call evil good in this day there's a group of people who have sold out to the word and sold out to the Holy Ghost and because of that they've been sealed away from that kind of thinking that kind of thinking isn't dominating your life look want to tell you you're crazy and you're odd and you're different and I look around and I say if this is different and that's normal then give me different Call Me Odd call me different cuz I don't want to be normal if out there is what normal is amen I'm thankful that we've been sealed away from that kind of thinking we we've been vaccinated with a vaccine that actually works amen this is a vaccine you're going to want to take amen the blood of Jesus Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe that that Anchor Holds us this morning amen it doesn't matter how much worse things get Church it don't matter how much crazier things get or how much crazy people get it can't get much worse but you know what we said that 10 years ago we said that 20 years ago so I don't know how bad it's going to get but what I know for sure is The Anchor Holds I know our faith is secure I know the word of the Lord never changes and that's where our focus is this morning amen amen we have a rock this morning aren't you thankful that you have a rock to Anchor to this morning see that's why the world's gone completely mad they got away from the rock they got away from the Rock and that rock was Christ that was the rock that held everything and now now everything in the whole world is just built on sinking sand and it's built on what feels good in the moment what makes you happy you hear it sometimes be be true to yourself don't do that don't do that well you you've got to be be live your truth no let's bring it back into reality this morning there is but one truth there is but one way there is but one life and that's Jesus Christ you can live your life all you want and be true to yourself and you're going to end up truly in hell but there is a Salvation tonight there is a way prepared there is a way provided he said this is the way this is the truth This Is The Life Today amen it's all built on what feels good in the moment I mean come on it doesn't matter if you go to this church or any other church around town or anywhere else in the state I think you'll be able to agree that the principles and morals of the current state of our world is not what it used to be it used to be that people had principles people had morals but over time what happened is is homes begin to drift away from Christ institutions of school government whatever you want to call institutions began to drift away from Christ we outlawed him in our schools we we banned him from the work places we ignored him in our homes and then you have an entire generation of people that that not only do they not know God there's always been people that didn't know God brother Joe but they lived in a world that was influenced by God that's right okay so now we have a generation of people that not only do they not know God but they don't even have any Godly influences in their life to bring some kind of a moral compass to bring some kind of balance to the evil that's trying to come in on every side and the world is operating with all Sals and no anchor just however the wind blows today however you feel about it today well today this is right and that's wrong and tomorrow it's vice versa and tomorrow you know what I think we'll add a new gender to it next thing you know you just might as well recite the alphabet because it's what feels good today it's the way the wind blew today it's what don't offend this person today but I'm thankful today that there is a rock that there is an anchor that'll hold you when the wind blows when the world's going crazy when the world's going to destruction we're standing firm on the rock of Jesus Christ today he's the same yesterday today and forever listen I'm thankful he don't change his mind I'm thankful that this law ain't this is okay and then tomorrow it'll get you killed no sir but if he didn't like it yesterday he don't like it today if it was the way of Salvation yesterday it's the way of Salvation today he says I am the Lord and I change not Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if he says it that settles it there's no debate we're not debating you know we debate it down here but in heaven it's settled it's a settled issue they don't debate the word of God there but what I love so much about that is it means this also once he has a thought he can't change his thought because he doesn't have a better thought he's a perfect God the first thought he has is a perfect thought and he thought of you thought of you and he can't change his mind about you today the Devil comes and says but you did this and you did that and you failed here God ain't sitting there looking going up got him changing my mind Angels take his place away he's not coming no sir he thought of you before the foundation of the world that means you were in him before the foundation of the world that means you were a part of him before the foundation of the world that means you are an eternal being and no matter what Satan does to you here on Earth no matter what dirt he puts on you what sin he puts on you no matter how he has to break you apart you're going to make it you're going to be there you're an eternal being God's not going to lose one of his he can't change his mind about you this morning hallelujah hallelujah you was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and therefore you was a part of him why we listening to the devil anyway we read there in chapter 12 of Revelation he's already been C pass out his testimony's already been found to be false god he said he was accusing you before the throne day and night accusing you and accusing you listen that's what he does that's his job well the devil said this and the devil said that and and you know what he was actually kind of right about this no no no no no no no he ain't right about none of it because he leaves out of the equation the blood of Jesus Christ that is Sanctified us that has given us his spirit that has forgiven us of all sins God looks at it and says what sin are you even talking about it's in the blood of Jesus this morning quit listening to the accuser he's been cast down it's time you take him and cast him down in your life this morning amen he hasn't changed his mind about you just because you had some failures as a matter of fact the great thing about Jesus is he's all knowing yes he knew you were going to fail he knew you were going to fall flat on your face he knew you couldn't do it and he said I'm coming to die for him he knew you were going to drift away he knew you were going to struggle he saw your ups and downs he said yep that's the one I love that's the one he saw you in drugs he saw you in pornography he saw you not caring about God in his word he said yep that's the one I love I'm coming to die for that one that's the one that needs me the most I'm going to shed my blood for him this morning Hallelujah brother Bram says now it's says that he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world before you ever sined one sin that's right before you ever told one lie before you ever smoked one cigarette or did anything that didn't please God it don't matter what you want to put there you were chosen before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that I don't care how hard you try I don't care how hard the devil tries you can't get away from that what's the Bible say about our bodies from dust Thou Art and dust Thou Art will return same thing goes for my soul I was in heaven and in heaven I'm going to return I was in the mind of God I'm going back to God I came from God I'm going back to God I can't get away from it but I sin I lived a miserable life I was a failure get in line me too we all failed we were all miserable but he said you can't get away from it [Applause] Hallelujah I love that an eternal quality it's an eternal word and you can rest on that word this morning there's going to be Overcomers in this day we might as well be part of them you ain't going without me sign me up if there's going to be people that do it I say Lord I feel the pull I want to be part of that I want to do whatever it takes to be part of that in Revelation 10:8 I'm just going to go through this quickly we saw that there was a book open and we saw that there was a taking of the book he said take the little book it doesn't do any good for the book to be unsealed for the book to be open the mystery finished and we leave it the hand of the Angel it wasn't for the angel and I say this with all due respect Malachi 4 wasn't about the angel so many years so many people got hung up on that on on brother BR I thank God God sent a prophet but he said behold I send unto you a lot it's about you the purpose is you the heart purpose of God is you he sent a message for you doesn't do any good he knew the Mysteries doesn't do any good if your pastor knows the Mysteries doesn't know any good if he's delg in the depths and found out you know that he needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost I got to get the book I got to take the book out of the hand of the Angel it was for me today verse n there's a command to eat the book so it don't do you no good to take it if you're just like this we got a lot of people with a lot of books on a lot of bookshelves collecting dust eat the book don't just talk about it don't just say I believe it look I'm happy if you believe it I'm G to say this again that means you've reached the level of the devil congratulations because the Bible says he believes and trembles I don't want to stay on the level of the devil I'm a Believer so is he I know it's true so does he you got to go beyond just being a Believer he says this has to get down on the inside of you that's what eating it does it takes it and puts it on the inside it becomes a part of you and it says it's going to be bitter in your belly know we're just going to stir up some things it's going to change the way you think this might be painful you may not like this part but eat it anyway let it get in there and stir you up you know what this going to be a different ult choice but eat it anyway eat it all don't leave none of it put it on the inside of you you got to feed on it let it begin to work inside of you and then in verse 10 we see John here representing the bride he eats the book and then verse 11 it says Thou must prophesy again before many people Nations tongues and Kings so it shows a an a taking an eating and then a speaking there's a speaking part that comes with this no notice the speaking doesn't come until after the eating we got a whole lot of speaking and not enough eating a whole lot of people got a lot to say but they've never eaten the book we get things out of order he said eat the book then you can speak notice it don't come to after the eating it's the taking of the book and the eating of the book that actually gives you something to say okay that's what gives us words she isn't the bride here isn't speaking her own thoughts she she's speaking what was in the book that's why he says eat the book then speak you're actually saying what was in the book that's how we're the voice listen to brother Brown he says oh God oh God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride the voice is in the bride listen there's plenty people in this world speaking what they think if you want to give up all hope for Humanity spend an hour reading social media it's man I just thought people were dumb it's revealed to me now that they are it's a revelation there's a lot of people with a lot of pin and speaking a lot of things all kind of nonsense all kind of propaganda out there speaking what they think there there's others claiming to be his church that disregard the book and speak from their Creeds speak from their dogmas but there's only one who has taken the book out of the hand of the Angel has fed on the contents of it and was commissioned or given Authority by God to speak what was in that book eat the book it's part of your commission take it out of the hand of of the Angel this morning and begin to ingest it and then allow it to begin to speak out of your life it's not even necessarily that you got to say words let it speak out of your life let your life be a testimony of the power of God let your life be a testimony of the grace of God let your life say what the word says amen we also read in Revelation 12 and 11 I'm going to read this again because we're going to go down into this it says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death we see here plainly that there's two components that allow Overcomers to overcome the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony so what I want to do is just for a second look here at this very first part this wasn't just any lamb because we know that millions of lambs had been sacrificed since that very first one there in the Garden of Eden Millions had had been put to death but the blood of bulls and goats could never pay the debt that we owed it could never pay the sin debt because the life of one human is more valuable than all the Bulls and all the goats therefore it's not equal in value to pay the debt how how many bulls would you have to sacrifice for the life of your child if I say all right look um you know is your child worth 10 Bulls is your child worth 100 100 it's worth a th there hopefully there's no number that make you go yeah let's make that trade because they don't equal in value so it could never pay off the death debt even though it did take the sinner's place it was a temporary thing that the animal was a different species and it had a different nature I want you to think about that for me it's a totally different nature in that animal so the life of that lamb no matter how innocent it was no matter how pure it was it could never come back on the believer that was an animal life this was a human life so so so the center of the worshipper would would come in and and and sacrifice this animal and he would go out of the temple with the exact same sin nature that he came in with he came in maybe he had a lust problem brother Joe I don't know what it is what maybe he had a issue with greed maybe he had an issue with line whatever his issue and he would come in with that issue sacrifice a lamb to cover those sins and then go back out with the same issue unchanged same desire to sin still Bound By by sin nature nothing had changed on the inside of him sin nature was still the dominating force that ruled his life no matter how much he hated it there's a lot of people sitting in a lot of churches that hate the way they are with no power to change the way they are so it doesn't matter how much they hated it no matter how much he fought against it no matter how many lambs were sacrificed those Lambs could only cover it it could only cover that person's sin that's why it had to be a man that's why it was only symbolism or it was only a substitute pointing to the true Lamb of God because when the true Lamb of God came he said Behold the Lamb of God that comes to take away the sins of the world world that's listen we're not operating under the blood of bulls and goats that's why we don't sit here and say it's okay to sin a little bit we're not perfect just forgiven well that's the attitude of the Old Testament believer because they sin constantly but hey they were forgiven if that's the way we're going to live our life what good was Christ's death it was pointless it had to be something more and that's why it had to be a human life that's why it had to be a Kinsman it had to be somebody who was like us so that the life that left that blood cell when he died on Calvary the life of the blood could then come back upon the believer that's right it says he offered a sacrifice one sacrifice for sins forever why don't we have to sacrifice a lamb every year every year every year because the life of that blood has now come back on the believer and now I'm walking with the power of the life of that blood overcoming sin in my life amen yes he was God but thank God he was a man thank God he was one of us he was a Kinsman and his blood set us free forever now we don't have to come back year after year after year after year with the exact same sin burden in our life the same failures Bound by sin nature bound by the fall but I can bury that old man I can bury that old man I can bury I I can bury those old habits I can bury the one who couldn't overcome and I can be filled by the spirit of God I can be born again by the spirit that was released from the blood cell there on Calvary so when it says they overcome him by the blood of the Lamb brother Joe it's not talking about the literal chemistry of the blood listen we couldn't do it with without Calvary we never ever ever want to put Calvary in a lesser place or in an insignificant role you couldn't do it without Calvary but you also can't stop at Calvary you can't just stop at forgiven because the Old Testament saints were forgiven you can't stop right there because then you'll just go right back into the same cycle of sin if you stop at Calvary you you with just forgiveness then you hadn't you had recognize the point of all this we got to go on in our experience until we're endued with power from on high you got to press further in till you have power to overcome till you have power to cast down Satan you have power to live above sin what are you saying brother Haron you've got to be born again and the reason you can be born again is there was a nature that was broken from a blood cell that comes into your nature and your old nature does eyes and you're born again by the life of Jesus Christ that's what it's all about Pentecost was the plan all along brother Joe that's right Calvary was a preparation for Pentecost because you couldn't receive the life until you'd been truly forgiven you couldn't receive the life until you'd been Justified and so Calvary was a preparation because at Pentecost couldn't happen if that blood cell wasn't loosed there was no life to come back on you until he laid his life down so we overcome by the blood of the Lamb it's not the literal blood I don't have a vow of the blood of Jesus in my bag back in the office it's not the blood literally that we're Overcoming By today I don't have a secret stash of it guys but I do have a NeverEnding supply of the life of that blood it's the the life that was in that blood that's what the token life is that's what must be on display when I see the blood I will pass over you what's he saying when I see the Life of Christ in your life I'm going to pass over you Hallelujah when I see you've been filled with the Holy Ghost there'll be no death there there'll be no tribulation there there'll be no missing the Rapture there when I see the life of the blood I'm going to pass over you and it was a perfect blood it was a perfect blood the lamb was inspected and the lamb was accepted Hallelujah this morning people come up and say I'm not good enough I'm not good enough I've got failures no you're not good enough but your lamb was good enough your lamb was inspected it was a perfect lamb it was a spotless lamb Hallelujah he overcame in every single aspect of his life in every situation in every temptation had there been a fault in his life then it would not been a a sufficient sacrifice had pilot found fault it wouldn't have been a sign a sacrifice that was worthy but it was a perfect sacrifice listen what he says in John 16:33 these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace world's falling apart brother Aaron yep it's crazy everywhere yep my life's in shambles I get it but in him you can have peace today in the world you shall have tribulation check it's happening trials every day struggles every day but be of good cheer wait what it's going to be falling apart there's going to be tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world yes what's he telling you here what's he saying the life that was in the man Christ Jesus lived this life to Perfection be of good cheer what's he telling you the life that was in Jesus was an overcoming life why are you telling me that brother Aaron because that's the life that he sends back for you be of good cheer I've overcome the world in the life that I did that by I'm fing to give it to you so guess what that depression this life's already overcoming that anxiety this life's already overcome it that lust problem this life has already overcome it and now I'm sending it to you and I'm allow you to use it to overcome the exact same way I did be of good cheer I'm giving you the key I'm giving you the life the blood of Jesus has already overcome the world what are you afraid of you're living the life of an overcomer today he's given you overcoming power he says I know you can't but I can't and I did and now I'm sending that life to you so that you can too hallelujah it's already won the victory be of good cheer the life of this blood makes you an overcomer they overcame him by the life of the blood of the Lamb by the blood of the Lamb amen there was a second part to this by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony amen I want to look at this next part by the word of their testimony now I don't want you to get confused in all this and think that I'm trying to change the definition of a testimony just follow me for a minute what is testimony testimony is to Bear witness so these people of Revelation 12 gave a testimony that was true that they bore witness of Truth they bore witness of Jesus Christ because they were accepted their testimony couldn't be false their testimony could couldn't have an ounce of untruth in it it couldn't even be leaning one way too much or one way another their testimony was perfect matter of fact it's so perfect that it's used in the same sentence as the blood of the Lamb notice they're not used to contradict they're used as like the same thing the blood of the lamb and the word of their test he's putting the word of your testimony on equal footing with the blood of the Lamb which means your testimony is perfect your testimony has no flaw your testimony has been approved and accepted so so what's different about your testimony Our Testimony these people in chapter 12 Who We Are what's different about their testimony from others because there's plenty of of Christians who claim the blood of Jesus and have a testimony and testify of Jesus Christ so what's so special or so different about this trouth that makes them the Overcomers of the age While others go through the tribulation the key to all of it and and we're going to be on this for a while but the key to all of it and to all overcoming is that it's done by the word all overcoming is done by the word so it's going to be a group of people Revelation 12 is a group of people who have received the word amen the word is it is it that specific brother Aaron is is that singular yes I am the way I am the truth that means there is the word just like there is one Jesus although Paul talks about how they're you know they've created jesuses of their own making so people are out here claiming Christianity but living their truth there's but one truth and in order to be part of the group of Overcomers you have to have accepted the word it it it's so I want you to understand it's not me Overcoming By My Testimony you overcoming by your testimony and you Overcoming By yours it's speaking to the group here as singular they overcame him by the word of their testimony it's not that your testimony is going to be different from mine and mine now if we tell the story of our life sure I'm not talking about that I'm talking about how we got there he's talking to the group we all overcame by the same thing the word of their testimony so I want to go into a few places in scripture here to find out what the word of their testimony is what is the word of their testimony well it's because I'm I'm I'm testifying of about my life and how Jesus saved me that's good but that's not what we're talking about let's look here Exodus 25:21 and thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat above above upon the ark and in the ark Thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee yes Exodus 31:18 this is where he's coming down with the Ten Commandments notice what the testimony is and he gave unto Moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon Mount Si two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the Finger of God 32:15 and Moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both sides of their sides on one side and on the other they were written and the tables were the work of God and the writing was the writing of God Graven upon the tables obviously you know we're talking about the Ten Commandments here what is it it's God's law it was the word of the hour it couldn't at that time be written on the hearts of men and women so God wrote it on Stone The Ten Commandments were the current revelation of what he wanted it's what he liked what he didn't like it bore witness of him it was all that could be revealed at that time it placed bound boundaries upon their lives if you were an overcomer in that day it's because you kept the Commandments or you kept the testimony God Called It the testimony and at that time the ark was the place that they kept the word but that that that wasn't what God wanted brother Joe he he didn't want his word carved out in stone and and then put down in some decorated ornate box it was just portrayed PR something he didn't want the the the word to stay in an ark he he didn't want the word to stay on Stone he wanted the word to be put in you he wanted you to become that Ark he he wanted that word to live in you he didn't want tablets of stone he he he didn't want stones of testimony he wanted people of testimony he wanted people that the word was written in their lives and their lives is where the word was written this wasn't what he wanted at the time but it's all that he could do he couldn't write it in men's hearts at the time it was his testimony it was his will it was his word I'm going to go through some more scriptures that would show this Psalms 25:10 all the paths of the Lord are mercy and Truth unto such as keep his Covenant and his testimonies yet they tempted and provoked the most high God and kept not his testimonies thy testimonies are very sure holy Hess becometh thine house oh Lord forever blessed are they that keep his testimonies that seek him with the whole heart remove from me reproach and contempt for I have kept thy testimonies thy testimonies also are my delight in my counselors and he says concerning thy testimonies I have known of old that thou H has founded them forever why am I reading this why why am i showing you this because the word testimony is being used over and over to represent the word the Commandments the revelation of God it says that the idea of testimony is intrinsic to the idea of biblical Revelation that's right the content of biblical Revelation whether general or special stands as a testimony to The Giver so the Revelation you receive is a testimony of The Giver amen God's testimony is revelation of who he is it Bears witness of who he is and what we're talking about don't lose track of this we're talking about overcoming by the word of their testimony in the last days so just hold our thought how have Believers always overcome by the word Joshua and Caleb they were people of the testimony why were they people of the testim Tony when the other 10 weren't because what they said lined up with the word they overcame because they agreed with the word their testimony lined up with the word whereas the other 10 did not it didn't matter if if what the other 10 had some said had truth in it it didn't matter if what the other 10 said made some sense it didn't matter it didn't match what the word said it wasn't aligned with the promises of the word and so therefore their testimony had had no credibility I want to look at that for a minute and just say this to you if somebody spewing ideas or doctrines or thoughts and it don't line up with the word their testimony has no credibility so when the Devil comes and says you're not going to make it he has no credibility the word says I'm going to make it when he says you're going to die of this sickness it has no credibility the word says by his stripes I am healed Satan's testimony has lost all credibility today he's been a proven liar from the beginning Hallelujah so Joshua and Caleb overcame because their testimony match that of the word right overcoming is done by the word and it has to be present truth it has to be present truth I want to make this clear so we all understand present truth is not new truth when we say the word of the hour we're not talking about new truth that's present truth is exactly what it is it's present tense it's for right now God's truth is eternal but there's a time of Revelation okay there's a time for more light to shine on the truth and therefore more truth can be seen it was always there it was always truth but now it can be sing that's why we call it the message of the hour it does not mean that we're only supposed to preach an hour I was in Louisville and one of the lovely stutsman Brothers let me know you know this is called the message of the hour don't you you know why don't you I got you I got you that's not what it means it means current truth yes it's what you need right now amen that's why it's the message of the hour what we believe is not the only message of the hour but it's the only message of this hour there's been lots of messages of the hour Rahab received the message of the hour that's how she was saved Noah received the message of the hour that's how he was saved right Moses had the message of the hour that's what brought the people out of Egypt there's been lots of messages of the hour for the moment but this is the message of this hour it's the message of right now it's what God reveals for that day to overcome in that day let me let me use a different terminology just to help some of us maybe grasp and understand exactly what we mean I know most of us do but God unfolds himself he's the god of an unfolding Revelation the the revelation of who God is is Progressive it moves on and on and on so in the Old Testament God unfolded himself throughout the Old Testament in Revelation to his people by what he was named and his name would give them a further revelation of his nature of his character of who he is of what he wants he was called Elohim and then in Genesis 17 he reveals himself to Abram as El Shi it wasn't a new go oh I've been serving Elohim but wait now there's El Shai now wait a minute now which one of y'all do I pray to Father Son and the Holy Ghost it's not three different gods it's three different offices of one God it's a revelation of who he is so then he's revealed as as elai it's an unfolding it's a greater understanding of the same person and each name has a meaning and represents his nature and his attributes then look Exodus 6:3 he says I appeared under Abraham under Isaac and under Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them I didn't reveal that part of myself to them they never knew me in this way this is who I am in this hour I've always been this but this is what you need right now so that's how I'm going to reveal myself to you for this moment for this situation God's testimony to the people was his current Revelation to them his testimony is I am Jehovah and that was his current Revelation to the people I am Jehovah his Revelation his testimony so he had been known down through the Old Testament by names that indicated different parts of his nature different parts of who he was or how he moved or how he provided or how he healed he was El elai Elohim Jehovah Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Rafa all these things one God unfolding himself and how wonderful each one of these manifestations was each one of them was magnificent in and of themselves each one of them was amazing but they were just a little portion yes of who God was that's right it was just a part this is a part of me this is something that I do but then after that he comes in a body he comes manifested in a body as Jesus Christ and Jesus was all of those names all of those attributes all of those characteristics manifested in a body he was all he was elsh he was Elohim he was Jehovah he was the son of David he he was he was Jesus he was all of those things all the portions wrapped up into one he is our healer he is our Banner he is our provider he is our peace he is our Shepherd and it wasn't just those things in portion anymore but now they had received all that he was he was all of it he was the fullness of the word it's not that the other Revelations weren't truth brother Joe those were still truth but now you couldn't receive him as just one of those things Luther's message was truth don't ever get the idea that we don't agree with Luther's message is that now you can't stand with Luther's message alone that's we agree with Wesley's message but it don't stand alone that's right it all has been wrapped up in the fullness of the word amen amen so it's the exact same thing that I just want to re reemphasize this it's not that the other Revelations aren't truth it was still each of those things but now a body manifesting each of those things in one place and it happens again after Jesus goes off the scene because down through the church ages each age had a message and a messenger that revealed as much about God as could be revealed at that time it's the message of the hour Luther had light Wesley had light and it's how they overcame Luther's age overcame with Luther's message Wesley's age overcame they're going to be there they're your brothers and sisters but you can't overcome with Luther's message today amen just want to give you an example that would make more sense if you're processing that we can't overcome with Noah's message today we can build the biggest boat we want out here in this field and it ain't going to do nobody it ain't going to fit in the pond we ain't going nowhere we're not going in a Rapture we're not going to be said that was Noah's message though and it was truth and it was revealed but we can't overcome on Noah's message look at this Noah was Vindicated word for his day do you believe that well his message won't work today Moses was Vindicated word of his day do you believe that it won't work for now John was the Vindicated word you believe that it wouldn't work in the days of Jesus certainly not no sir law and prophets were until John since then the Kingdom of Heaven the apostles them who set forth the Bible here come Luther out in Reformation his words his church won't work today Wesley won't Pentecostal won't it worked for their day now God's promise to Noah won't work for us today God's promise to Moses we couldn't have moses' message Moses couldn't have Noah's message can you imagine Moses tell Us's build an ark and sell it down the now it ain't going to work we got the message of the hour he says we couldn't have had Luther's message we couldn't have had Wesley's message this is another time God allotted his word to each age so each age overcomes by the word for that age let's don't get it twisted and think well you know the word they had wasn't good it's what exactly what God wanted them to have so it was perfect it's what God wanted them to have for that age to me to meet the four horse riders that went out it was the anointings that was released in those ages but just like in the Old Testament how it was unfolded in different names until there he stood in a body of Flesh once again the revelation of the word has unfolded until once again here he stands yes in a body of Flesh me yes you and me and all of us with our little portion around the world make up the body of Jesus Christ in flesh again the body of his bride a people who overcome just like he overcame by the spirit that was inside of him him and by the word of his testimony it's a people today if we're honest and I don't like to paint a dark picture but it's a dark scene that's living in the most evil time that there's ever been on the face of the Earth the most troubled time the world has ever known the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil has absolutely reached its height and reached to full maturity the Bible tells us that 200 million demons have been released from the river Euphrates they're under the Sixth Seal in Revelation 9 and I say we can see them yes they are being made manifest all around us I just want to say this if the devil can so possess a people that you can walk down the street and see his influence on their lives what about a god what about a God that can so fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that there's a people walking in the world today that the world can recognize his influence on their life he say there's something different about those people some people don't want to stick out I want to stick out I want them to rec recognize there's something different there there's an influence on that life but we're facing the fullness of Satan's Legions he's not come in portion in this age the fullness of his Legions released the fullness of evil so in over in order to overcome these people you aren't going to be given a portion of the word he's not going to send you out to face the legions of hell with the portion of the word you're facing the fullness of Hell he's going to give you the fullness of the word he's not going to ask you to do it with what evening light Tabernacle is or what this church is or this Creed or this Dogma he says I'm giving you all of me I'm giving you everything I'm giving you the full revelation of who I am my power my might my strength I'm giving it to you to face the enemy and oh you can have peace I've already overcome all this I'm giving you exactly what it took for me to be Victorious and by that you yourself are going to be victorious amen why is it what's the scripture mean when the enemy comes in like a flood I'll raise a standard you are that standard today you are the standard being lifted up by the word of God that people can look at and say there's a still a standard there's still a truth there's still a living God in this day hallelujah it's prepared for this time it's prepared for this moment and in this day the fullness of the word has been restored that we might overcome by the word the same way that he did when he was on Earth brother Aaron I'm not strong brother Aaron I don't have any gifts preachers they have gifts and deacons are men of God and singers they get annoyed I don't have that doesn't matter that's not what it's about you have the same Authority I have you have the same strength I have you're stronger than me no I'm not no because it's done by the word that's listen here how'd the groom do it now in his first battle with Satan he officially listen close now he officially overcame Satan and all of his powers by the word of God it is written it is written it is written whatever he comes and comes and attacks you it is written yes he says here he defeated Satan on the father's word is that right bringing it to show that the weakest Christians I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but I know there's people sitting here that feel like you're the weakest Christian you feel like I'm in the weakest position I'm in the weakest spot I'm struggling I'm going to go under I'm being swamped by the waves it's okay a lot of us get in that situation it's time to just raise a hand up and say Lord I perish save me it's that simple Peter didn't have to come up with a fancy prayer he didn't have to tell Lord I did this I did that I did Lord I perish save me he's looking tonight you may be getting swamped by the ways but he's standing there on the water waiting on you to call out and you say Lord I perish save me it's that simple today he says but the weakest of Christian can defeat Satan on thus sayeth the Lord out of the word of God no matter what you feel no matter what you feel what you think thus saith the Lord it is written I'm weak this morning brother Aon I'm struggling this morning I don't know if I can defeat the enemy no you can't in yourself you can't in your works you can't with your willpower but I don't care how weak you are this morning I don't care how far away you've slid if you'll start using the word of God you're going to start seeing mountains move start see using the word of God we're going to start seeing demons tremble start using the word of God you're going to start seeing sicknesses flee start using the word of God and what's prison bars come open start using the word of God and watch marriages be restored start using the word of God and watch children come home quit speaking your doubts quit using the testimony of the devil quit speaking like the false accuser I'm going to testify what the word said by a Stripes I'm Healed there will be a Turk without spot or wrinkle I'm going to make it I'm more than an overcomer by his stripes I'm going to be there my offspring's going to be there I'm going to testify what the word said watch hell shake this morning hallelujah it's time to quit fighting him with our feelings quit leaning on what we understand and what we don't listen there is so much I don't understand there's so much all of us don't understand and then some of us understand a lot more some of us a lot less like sometimes I think I understand things and then I talk to somebody like brother Tim or somebody I realize I don't understand anything but it ain't about that quit fighting with what you understand and say I understand this the word works I understand this the word will defeat the Devil anywhere any place anytime under any circumstances you don't know the place I'm in any place you don't know the spot I am in my life anytime but you don't understand my circumstances any circumstances use the word today and the place you're in will become a place of Victory a place of rejoicing a place of overcoming put the word of God on your lips today and speak the word hallelujah he says remember the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere Jesus with all of his fine qualities a father giv and he said it was written he could have just told blasted the devil out of existence but he didn't why he said it is written when he met Satan he defeated him right there on the word of God and brought it down to a place this is why he did it that anybody anybody the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan with the word of God why do he suffer all that so anybody could overcome why' he go through all that so anybody could overcome amen so when you feel like you can't but you don't understand how weak I am I know been there that's when Satan attacks us when did he attacked Jesus after he' been fasting for 40 days attacked him in his weakest moment in his weakest moment in your weakest moment let that sink in in your weakest moment you can overcome the devil in your weakest moment you're more than a conqueror in your weakest moment you're still the Bride of Jesus Christ in your weakest moment you still have the right to speak the word in your weakest moment when you take the word of God and put it on your lips it is the same as deity speaking so start speaking to your Mountain Satan get thee hints get out of my family get out of my body let go of my joy let go of my peace return to me all that Christ paid for me at Calvary speak the word today he attacks in our weakness but the weakest of Christians can take the word and drive the enemy out faith comes by hearing hearing the word now the word of God will defeat Satan on any grounds any place anywhere anytime that's the word of God will defeat the Devil any place brother Aon that's like six in a row yep you're going to leave here knowing this if you know nothing else you're going to know I can overcome by the word it don't matter where I'm at today I can overcome by the word the word of God will defeat Devil any place anywhere any time on any condition when Jesus was here on Earth the father was in him God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself we believe that all the fine qualities was in him well the father was in him but when he met Satan look how he did he brought it into your reach and yours and yours and all of you see he never used his great gift you have the greatest gift of all the ability to recognize and use the word that's the greatest gift amen you can use the word that's greater than any preacher gift any singing gift you can use the word you can put it on your lips and you can be an overcomer but what about where I'm at any place any condition wherever you are this morning turn into a place of Victory they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony there's victory in the word there's joy in the word there's healing in the word and the groom showed the bride exactly how to overcome by the word how did he defeat death the word how did he defeat hell the word right how did he defeat the grave the word why did he rise again because the word said he was going to rise again the word declared it and he looks in there and he sees the word that says I'm not going to allow my Holy One to see corruption that's right and he testifies of that word and it becomes the word of his testimony destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up again think about that he found it in the word put it on his lips and then it became the word of his testimony he says Jesus body was quickened after it was dead and in the grave Jesus body was quickened by the word and transformed from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified Son of God because the prophet Psalm 16:10 if you want to put it down said I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption oh God that word has to come to pass it's God's word plant it in your heart if you want to go in a Rapture if you want to be Christians genuine place this word as I believe it was Ezekiel God said take the scroll eat it up that prophet in the word will become the same and every promise in there has to manifest itself you want to go in a Rapture he says plant this seed you want to be an overcomer plant this seed take the word and plant it in your life it has to come to pass it has to listen to this I'm going to read the second paragraph he says why it was prophecy the word word of God and prophecy if it's true word of God can not fail and the same Prophecy in the word of God that said he raised him up here we go says we're already raised with him no wonder he said fear not it is written that the spirit that is now was in him now in us also quickens our mortal body fear not the Sun is up this morning what are you worried about this morning he said the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead is now dwelling in you to Quicken your moral body how are we going to overcome by the spirit and the word of Our Testimony fear not the Sun is up this morning the Sun is up this morning we could go quote and quote and quote I'm going to move on everything is done by the word that's why the restoration I'm bringing this back down that's why the restoration of the word was so important that's why it was so important that's why we have to receive the message of this hour amen we couldn't overcome with Noah's message we couldn't overcome with just the restoration of the gifts there is no Victory without the Restoration in this day there's no Victory without our hearts being turned back there isn't a spoken word bride without the Restoration in this day there isn't a Rapture without the restoration of the fullness of the word think about it so in the days of portions of the word you you could only have portions of him that's right in the days of portions you couldn't even receive the fullness of the Holy Ghost because that portion wasn't revealed it wasn't it wasn't revealed you can't have his holy spirit without accepting the word these two go together I don't want to get them separate it's like Dynamics and mechanics you can't get the Holy Spirit without accepting the word and you can't accept the fullness of the word without it leading you to the holy spirit amen they go hand in hand both of them watch this he says now the Holy Spirit what is the word God is not three he's the same God in three dispensations just like the names we talked about he's he is the same God in three dispensations three offices God the Father over the law God the son and Grace God the Holy Ghost as you call it the same God in the Holy Ghost dispensation God the father was the word God the son was the word and God the Holy Ghost is the word brother Aon why was it so important for the word to be restored because it's everything if I'm going to overcome by the Holy Ghost I can't even get the fullness of the Holy Ghost until the fullness of the word has been restored by the message of the hour see it's just three offices and the Holy Ghost seals you therefore you're sealed by the word why is it so important that we're got the truth why is it so important that we're not wondering in darkness why did God have to send a prophet brother Joe you done a great job on that this is why the word has to be right the word is the Holy Ghost the word is the Father the word seals you there has to be a people in this day sold out to the word of God not Church ideas and church anties and family this and dad this and this preacher that preacher it's all about the word in this day it's all about the word that's Martin had light Luther had light Wesley had light what was that God unfolding himself Through the Ages by his Spirit to The Messengers until the last day when a message took all those loose sins yes all the Mysteries and testified there's a living God brought him up out of History he took the truth from Martin the truth of Wesley the truth of Luther the truth of all these others that had studied some of it true some of it wrong he didn't throw it all away he took the truth tied it all together brought it as a restoration and said here it is here's what you need to overcome if the groom overcame by the word and he wants the bride to overcome by the word then how can he expect you to overcome by the word if he don't restore it all the way back for you that's if he don't put you in the same position he was in because he stood as the fullness on he's not going to ask the bride to stand here with a portion he says no I know what it takes to overcome it I'm giving it all back to you I'm restoring all the word back to you listen brother brownon makes a statement several places and I'm paraphrasing so if I don't get it just perfect help me forgive me I mean don't help me just forgive me where he says the evidence of the Holy Ghost is that you can accept the word for your hour and people want to take that and say that means if you believe the message you got the Holy Ghost they take that and so what they're saying is if I recognize God sent a prophet then I've got the whole what brother Brand's saying is if you're able to take the message of the hour out of the hand of the angel you're able to look upon the book you're able to eat it that's what accept it means and let it get on the inside of you and then your life begins to prophesy what the word says He says if you can accept the message of the what's the message of this hour does anybody want to know all of it all of it it was a portion in Luther it was a portion Martin poron in Wesley today the message of the hour is all of it it's all been revealed So when you say all I got to do is receive the message truth you got to receive acts 238 you got to receive Mark 16 you got to receive John 14:12 that's all part of the message you got to be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to have your own Upper Room experience that's what the message taught so when he said say if you can receive the message for your day it's the evidence of the Holy Ghost he means all of it not just that God sent a prophet what did the prophet say what did he tell you to do eat the book become the book and if you're taking Parts up and saying we don't need that anymore then you don't accept the message for your day because the message for your day is the whole thing it's all of it it's every last bit this last day message testified he was the same yesterday today and forever it took all the portions wrapped them into one glorious message so it was no longer just a portion it was the revealed word in the fullness that would be called bride amen it would call you out yes and then he would say I no longer call you church I call you bride and people would take that word and eat that word and become that word and overcome by that word if you'll bear with me we're going to turn this towards home and take this take this towards home now they wouldn't be a people that would deny any of it that's right they would take all of it even the parts that made the belly bitter that's there's parts that hurt to eat because we have our own thinking and sometimes it may be sensible it may be sane it may seem normal but it's got to line up that's it's got to line up it makes the belly bitter to lay down our will makes the belly bitter to accept things we don't understand it makes us get frustrated when we don't get our way human nature he says eat it anyway eat it anyway it's going to make the belly bitter and that word would once again once you eat it would begin to be made flesh it would bring a bride to a perfect faith for a perfect rapture we Rapture by the word he says but the Church of the Living God that bride moves right on just the same and she'll go in the Rapture by the word Listen People Get It confused sometimes they think well we focus on the word not on the moving of the spirit or the spirit or the emotions you can't separate the two we've already made it clear he said you overcome there was two things the blood of the Lamb which we've already went through and found is what Spirit you got to have the spirit and by the word you got to have the word there's no separating when we say by the word we mean all that's in the word every part of it that's right the word and the word will come together who's the word Jesus and who's the other word the bride he said the word and the word will come together if we're a part of Christ part of it we have to be his word wait did he say we have to believe his word no he said we have to be his word that's why you got to eat it that's why it's got to become yours it's got to become who you are you have to be his word because he is the word this take all the way back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost why did he have to die cuz somebody just like us had to die so we could have his Spirit he can't be United with somebody that's not just like him that's right so if he's the word you got to be the word in order for there to be a uniting amen I want to say this I know there's a lot of good people who serve God to the best of their ability with what they they know and with what Revelation they've received I take nothing from them and nothing from their testimony this this this ain't about that God blessed them each and every one what whatever level of people are in their Christian walk I just wish we had more Christians I'll take it make the world a better place I thank God for every person who calls on the name of the Lord and it gives us some moral compass or something I'm thankful for those people but if they aren't part of the restoration then they aren't part of the Overcomers of the age there in Revelation 3 they aren't part of the ones there in Revelation 12 I'm not saying they're not good people I'm not saying they won't make Heaven what I'm saying is I'm preaching to those that overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony I'm talking to people that are going to go in a Rapture I'm talking to people who are part of the restoration whose Hearts has been turned by the message of Malachi 4 the people that have received the word of their day people that have received the message of the hour who who have received the testimony of Jesus Christ in its fullness and by that word they're standing I want to ask you today how you standing how you still here Devil's been telling some of you was going to quit a long time ago telling you you wern't going to make it telling you you wasn't going to come back telling you you was going to drift away how you still standing it ain't by your willpower don't give yourself that much credit you're still here here cuz the word of God's holding you you're still here cuz The Anchor Holds you're still here because there's a rock in a weary land and we may be in a weary land but the Rock is following us and that rock is Christ and out of that rock we get water there's lifegiving water there's healing water there's power in that water you're still here by the word you're still Overcoming By the word you're still casting Satan down by the word and the bride is going to stand exactly like Jesus did he didn't fall you're not going to fall he was tried in everything and he overcame every trial and he did it by the word the Bible tells us he he was tempted in like manner so you take that think of the way you're tempted don't share it I'm just telling you to think it the worst thing the worst thought you can have the worst Temptation according to the word he was tempted in like manner I don't care if nobody in this place understands you he does I didn't say he gave into it I said he was tempted by it it was presented to him yes and he overcame it by the word and now there's going to be a bride that does the exact same thing quit getting upset and downtrodden because you get tempted Jesus himself was tempted the apostles the disciples they were all tempted brother Brandon was tempted you're going to be tempted Ed but let's finish the sentence and you're going to overcome the same way he overcame because you've got the fullness of the word you're Jesus Christ in a body again you are predestinated not to fall I'm might fall I'm might fall no you're not going to fall you're the word you're going in a Rapture you're predestined in this day to be the Overcomers of the age that's who you are that's the testimony We Believe Hallelujah Overcoming By the word yes sir and since we're overcoming in this day it's going to take the word of this day to meet the challenge Hallelujah the restoration gave us the fullness of the word and because of that we have the fullness of the spirit all the Dynamics all the mechanics and it's our testimony this message is our testimony yes listen brother Brown we know we're at the end time and the people need strength Satan is charging at them and I'm putting the word of God in their hands right now in their hearts we defeat Satan with this word amen It's the final voice to the final age speaking the word yes if he was if he was the fullness of the word then what then is the BR bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power she is him so she is the manifestation of the word how can we say anything else but the word when we are the word how can we do anything but the word when we are the word that's Hallelujah he says the word and her are the same as a man and his wife become one in Union so does the real genuine Church of God when he comes in Christ the Bible is punctuated with an amen every promise don't make any difference what the denomination says the soul that's in The Believer punctuate it because it it is the word in him speaking out if we're speaking something what are we speaking the word now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominations we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour you talk about responsibility and you talk about benefits we are the Manifest ation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living in church that should excite you that's who you are that's what you are that's what your responsibility is that's what he gave you the fullness of the restoration of the word for and to be attributes of him manifested to the world we have no other testimony we have no other Revelation he says that's my message to you Church you that's a union spiritual union by the word that you're dead to these old husbands you're born a new don't try to dig him up he's dead if you're a born again Christian that little germ that was predestinated to you it's word coming on word on word on word on word until it comes to the full stature of Christ that's right so he can come and get his bride how can we speak anything else how can we be saying anything else why couldn't Jesus fail brother Aaron Jesus couldn't fail because he was the word and the word can't fail and now the word is made flesh again and the bride is the very Body of Christ on the earth I want to tell you again you can't fail if Jesus couldn't fail then you can't fail he made sure that you weren't going to come up short he made sure that you weren't going to fail he made sure you weren't going to end up in the tribulation he sent back everything you had need of he sent back everything you had need to make it he said I'm going to prepare a place for you and I'm not doing it for nothing I'm going to make sure you're there I'm not making this beautiful city for me to hang out in all alone but I'm going to have a bride and I'm going to make sure she gets there she's going to be bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh power of my power she will be him she'll cast Satan down where I cast Satan down she'll overcome every Temptation she'll heal the she'll deliver the bound Hallelujah she will show the attributes of a living God to a Dying World in the last day she will be my testimony Hallelujah a people of testimony yes there were two parts the blood of the Lamb the life and the word he says I could stay here the rest of the day Paul said if I sing I'll sing in the spirit uh-huh if I preach I'll preach in the spirit if I walk I'll walk in the spirit if I talk I'll talk in the spirit let everything be done by the word and the spirit yes sir amen it's all God's truth church this testimony has life in it it's not a dead letter it's not a dead word right that's right it's a Living Word it's a powerful word it's a word that heals it's a word that that that created worlds it's a it's a world that defeated Devils it's a word that defeats Devils it's a word that allows us to overcome it's a Living Word and it's not written on tablets of stone anymore brother Joe it's not hid somewhere in the Ark of the Covenant anymore but it's a living word that's been written on the hearts of men and women manifested to the world it's not hid somewhere where people can't see it we're out there it's a testimony God Lives God Saves God delivers I'd be ashamed to stand up here and tell you of the things I did in my prior life I give no glory to that but what I know is when I thought I'd gone too far God said nope you hadn't gone too far from me how frustrating it must be for the devil to pour decade after decade after decade into a life and say I've got them I spent 30 years on this one and then in one moment's time God says no that was mine and in one moment it's finished it's over and I become a testimony to the grace of almighty God hallelujah you're called you're chosen you're going to make it oh blessed be the name of the Lord speak the word say what the word said what is it the word has given us something to say Revelation 10 there was a taking of the book there was a eating of the book it showed it all it says now prophesy again it doesn't show the speaking it says take it eat it and then prophesy again and then we go back to chapter 12 and I heard a loud voice in heaven saying now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accus ACC user of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night he's been accusing you every day since you've been on this earth and the judge says that's enough of that nonsense I've listened to you long enough your testimony has been found false I've already look through the records and it's all been wiped clean there's nothing there so I'm not going to sit here in this courtroom and listen to you spew lies and dishonor my wife any longer how many of y'all let a man come knock on the door and you open the door and he comes in sits in your living room says now I'm going to tell you a lot of stuff about your wife I'm going tell you how she annoys me how she gets on my n how she's a failure here have you seen your kitchen your wife is not that just came out yeah can't get the toothpaste back in the tube brother it's out you wouldn't tolerate it though look around what kind of home she running for you is she even a good with he might get through one sentence you talking about my wife you talking about the one I chose you talk about the one that I've dedicated my life to and he looks at and says I'm not going to hear it anymore he says you're done accusing you're done lying my blood's already paid for it my blood's already settled the debt you are done you're the accuser of the Brethren now get out get out he's bound up and he's cast out of heaven and it says now has come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God Satan has been cast down you've been accused for the last time he says I found you to be a false accuser the witness is a liar and his testimony is false but then our testimony is examined what do we say how do we over overcome but see it's it's a rigged court because we were given the questions ahead of time and we have the answer to the devil's question he already told us what to say he said just say what I said he said take the book we're back in chapter 10 take it open it up eat it and then when it comes time for you to testify you know exactly what to say you know exactly what to say our testimony is what was in the open book and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death what's that mean we laid our lives down we took the book we said let this be our life and what was in the open book the message of the hour was our testimony our testimony is the word but how could we speak it if it wasn't restored and how could it be restored if God hadn't sent a prophet so we made sure that you had the testimony you needed to answer the devil's questions Our Testimony we know is true because God already spoke it and it's his word in our mouth and his word can't lie we can say what God said because we've already had a Vindicated prophet in this day tell us exactly what the testimony was he already tore it open and said look at it eat it we ate it up and now we're saying what the word said don't be on the side of the accuser don't speak what the accuser speaks but when you eat that book and he says okay what's their testimony we begin to say I'm saved I'm Healed I'm delivered I'm the bride I'm called I'm chosen I was in him before the foundation of the world I never did it in the first place I'm going in the Rapture I'm not guilty everything he ever said is false I'm an overcomer I'm going to make it I'm delivered the blood has Set Me Free the blood has loosed me I'm going to make it I'm going to Rapture I'm going up what are you doing I'm just saying what the message already told me it's the word of my testimony I'm an overcomer you're an overcomer the blood has loosed you the Holy Ghost is yours healing is yours your children are yours hallelujah our testimony is the revealed word of the hour it's who we are this message is the testimony of Jesus Christ and it's who he is and just as Moses delivered the tablets of the testimony to the children of Israel and it became part of their testimony it became their testimony it became the revelation of who God was and what God wanted the seventh angel Malachi four has delivered an end time message a revelation a testimony of who God is what God desires and he gave it to us and we have eaten the book and it has changed our lives and it is our testimony see once you eat it it's yours I can't get it from you it's become part of you it's your testimony it's you speaking it's the seals revealed in you Christ in you your message Mage it's the word in your mouth we overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony I want to read this last quote and it's long but I want you it sums up everything we've talked about I don't say why didn't you just read it at the beginning and close well says like on Mount Transfiguration all the prophets and everything else is finished all the days of Lutheran the Methodist the Presbyterian they're all right but this is my beloved Son hear ye him the word of this hour the hour of the seals when all the Mysteries back Yonder that's been hit all these years that Great Pyramid of time was stricken off The Headstone make it hone down so that the Star of David will settle into its place and the great Church of the Living God will be raised like the wings of an eagle packed out yonder into Glory yes and now in our bodies this with speaking with tongues with prophesying foreseeing laying hands on the sick they recovered the world dead and all the things of this world we've passed from Death under life and now we hold the power Hallelujah in that Resurrection on that Resurrection morning when the death seals will be broken we shall rise Hallelujah we shall rise amen there ain't enough devils in hell to keep us from doing it we were for ordained of God for this hour the word of God manifests itself right through us and we live in the presence of God by the word promise of God ain't a devil in hell can keep me from Raising and he ain't a door he could shut in my face at that morning the seals have been Broken Hallelujah I'm free I'm an eagle I'm no longer in a cage but I'm free I've raised from the dead into the new life of Jesus Christ not only me but every man woman boy girl sitting here that's been filled into the spirit of God is a new creature in Christ and you are an eagle Hallelujah we are alive today and enjoy the resurrection forever more because he lives we are alive also and he's living in us making us alive and the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in our being shall Quicken our mortal bodies in that great Eternal Easter glory to God oh take the world take anything you want to but give me Jesus amen I love him he's all the world to me and because that you are a part of him and I'm a part of you and you are a part of me and together we are a part of him no wonder joyful tears can run down our cheeks no wonder our hearts quiver in shape when we can feel the same transforming power coming into our lives and filling us even for letting us speak in a language that comes from Heaven Hallelujah 1965 we're so quickened up into his presence there prophesy foresee foretell and everything hitting perfectly with the word if it's prophesying contrary to that don't believe it but if it's the word if it's the word it's already thus sayith the Lord you say I need a word from a prophet I need somebody to speak over me just find it in the word by a Stripes you're healed that's thus sayith the Lord what's better than that it's for you and your children that's th sayeth the Lord I'll have a church without spot Rinko th sayeth the Lord if it's in the word it's already thus sayith the Lord and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death let me say it like this they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by the life of the blood and by the message of the hour you're going to make it you're going to make it because you're the people of testimony and his testimony cannot fail he testified of you he testified that you were going to be there he testified of Saving Grace he testified of mercies Beyond Compare and it was all about you you're the people of his testimony you can't not make it you can't not make it it's time to start speaking the word it's time to take the word upon your lips and quit saying all the negative quit believing the lies of the enemy how many people that you know that'll come up for prayer and God bless them I pray for anybody who wants prayer but they come up and talk themselves out of it when they get there they tell you all the reasons they're not going to get it and all the things going wrong instead of coming up and going I've been sick but God says I'm Healed let's get it let's go get it I'm about to walk away from here to I'm walking away from here saved I'm walking away from here preparing the fatted cast well my kids

a keeper of that testimony the people of that testimony you're going to overcome I hope in some way I I conveyed it to you the way the lord gave it to me it excited my heart so much to realize he gave me the testimony I don't got to go earn it I don't got to I just got to say what he said that's and not only that he opened the book for me and he handed it to me he did everything he gave me a cheat sheet he said test this tomorrow here's the test eat it up and say what it said and then when I sat before the judge and I began to speak he said that's right that's true I am a savior I am a Healer I
