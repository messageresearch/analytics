bless you today we just pray that God will bless them in every way as they walk together with us in these last few moments of time amen Hebrews chap 11 and verse one and also Luke 1 and verse 26 it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear Luke 1 and verse 26 says in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into the city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and angel and the angel came into her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this must be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come unto thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she has also conceived a son and her old age and this is the sixth Monon with her who ALS was also called baren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her amen we'll let you be seated I'd like to speak to you this evening on a thought on it is the season for Faith amen it's not that Faith goes in and out of season but it is the time to believe amen and I I believe if there ever was a time upon the face of this Earth to believe right now is the time to believe you know I was looking at something brother Rand said about a doctor he visited he said this doctor said I studied to be a minister I studied St for four years and I became an agnostic that's kind of interesting ain't it study to be a minister and become an agnostic I just threw it all up and I said there's nothing to any of it he said I studied Muhammad and they had virgin births I studied Buddha and they had virgin birst then here's the Bible and I said just a minute doctor I said you're trying to compare error with truth that's right I said one of them is ridiculous and the other is Sublime that's right they can't prove one thing mamad can't prove it he said I visited the grave of most all of those Founders but where where is Jesus buried today I said he rose again said how do you know that they didn't just steal him away I said he rose again how do you know he liveth now where in my heart that's right I said the trouble of it is doctor in the Garden of Eden there was two trees one was knowledge and one was Faith one was life amen and one was the death of one was death of knowledge and the other was the life by faith and as long as they eat by faith of this tree all right they lived but when they got on this tree on this other tree of knowledge he died the first bite he took he separated himself from God and man continually has been biting off that tree and every time he takes a bite by knowledge he destroys himself God destroys nothing but man destroys himself through knowledge he says look he bit himself off some Gunpowder and he kills he bit himself off of the that tree an automobile and has killed more than all the wars put together knowledge by eating off of that tree he's gotten himself a hydrogen bomb and nuclear bombs now and I wonder what he's going to do with that see but the trouble of it is these people they figure up so much on this tree of knowledge that when they can't figure it out any longer they just say Bosch with all of it how many knows what that means I never heard that saying before BOS actually means all of this is nonsense or foolish talk so if they can't figure it out any longer they say it's just all nonsense he said listen in the name of the Lord listen I mean thinks we ought to listen right there when you can't figure it out anymore that is the time to believe amen when you can't figure it out anymore that is the time to believe it's like someone going to swim and as long as you got your feet on the ground all right you can jump around you can Splash but it's when you step off in the Deep then it's time to swim it's where you can't figure it out that's when you have to believe from there on Amen figure out as much as you can but when you can't figure out anymore then from right there start believing and believe only you say well I went to the doctor and the doctor says I got a tumor and he said he says he can't do anything for me and it's done went all the way through me it's malignant I can't do nothing for you you go to another doctor he can't do nothing before you it's done then from right there start believing start believing believe right there and say Lord Jesus they can't do nothing but I'm coming to you and then God will move on the scene see faith faith is something that you have to believe it's there when nothing else will declare it's there but Faith amen many times your senses will not declare it's there it would not declare healing is there or Deliverance is there or salvation is there but Faith amen is something that you can take that can declare it even though you can't see it with your eyes you can't feel it with your feelings you can't you can't look around and see it or or know it's there by any of your senses but by faith you say it is there because I have something to believe and what do we believe we don't believe man's ideas our faith is not on man's ideas or man's Creeds or man Dogma our faith is upon the word of God Amen that's where true faith lies now amen you can have faith in a tree but that tree can die you can have faith in whatever you can have faith in your car and get in it today and go down the road and it kill on you right there before you get to mending there you can have faith in a lot of things that can that can fall away but there's something that you can have faith with faith in that'll never fall away or never not come to pass or never fail but it'll be steady and a firm foundation that no matter what you see or what you feel or what you don't see or what you don't feel you can still believe anyhow because what God's word declared it and is there even though we can't declare it in our senses but we can declare it by faith because we know his word will not fail amen it will fulfill that what is sent to do amen he that in the Bible you know said know it says he that cometh to God must believe that he is and it is impossible to please God without faith and you can't please him if he don't have faith see God allows you many times to come come down to the end of the Rope when you can't figure it out no more to see what you're going to do there he allows you to come to those places in your life that the doctor can't help you or your your finances can't help you no more or this that and the other can't do nothing for you you can't do nothing for yourself it's all it's all done as far as humanly declarations can say but God brings you to those places so you he wants to see how you are going to go from there if you're going to step off the tree of knowledge and step on to the tree of of life amen I believe there's a people that's living on that tree of life they're living on the Lord Jesus Christ and his word and what he has spoken this hour amen we're not living we're not believing amen the words of a just the words of a seventh grade KY and it goes beyond that amen has been Vindicated from on high amen God himself came down and said amen to the words that we believe therefore we can stand upon the word no matter what is going on around us amen many of you people people have faith you know brother B said it this way in your doctors and he said you should have if you got a doctor he said now if something gets wrong with you you go to that Old Faithful doctor you believe in that's what you should do that's good and you submit your case to him and but if he says you should go to the hospital you don't do a thing but you you maybe go home and pack a few clothes and go to the hospital you don't necessarily argue with him if you believe him if you got faith in that doctor he said if he doesn't decide what you to go to the hospital but he would thinks you just need a prescription and he gives you a sack full of pills and you'll swallow them and you don't even know what those pills are going to do many times but you got faith in that doctor he said how about God how about God if you're scared to swallow some of the gospels amen that he gives you by his stripes you are healed faith is the victory that overcomes the world swallow it and see what happens amen follow it and see what kind of effect amen it'll have an effect in your life see it's a confidence you show what confidence you have in your doctor by taking the medicine he subscribes now I know we got a lot of knowi it alls amen who knows more than the doctor and they'll go to a doctor and say well he don't even know what he's talking about why you go to the doctor to begin with amen you go there to try to get help you don't go there to find out if he's stupider than you are you go there to find out if he knows more than you know amen if he knows amen what that symptom May indicate or what what that that look may be or what that feel may be amen he's studied he's he's given himself so you go there to because you should have faith amen it takes Faith to go to a doctor yeah it does it takes Faith to go and it sure takes Faith to take what he gives you because with what it gives you has side effects and there's there's the things that it does to your body that you have to do the good and you get the evil with it it's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so there's good with it and there's evil with it there's there's the good that it does and there's evil that it does but you you take it because you have faith in what he said but how much more should we have faith in what God said because God does not have no evil side effects his word does not have one evil side effect or one bad effect in your life matter of fact it's nothing but good if you'll swallow the word of God and let it go into your body into the spiritual man and begin begin to ruminate on that and allow it to affect your life it only has good effects it's not good and evil it's only good amen swallow it and see what happened see it's a confidence you show what confidence you have in your doctor by taking his medicine that's that you don't know what it is you show your confidence in the doctor by submitting yourself to an operation that proves your confidence in the doctor but when it comes to Christ many times we're scared to take him at his word come on now and and and this doctor Jesus ain't lost one case Hey listen you can go to a doctor and I I believe in doctors and I'm thankful for doctors I I'm thankful that God's given them the wisdom that he's given them this day honestly I wouldn't have wanted to go to a doctor 100 years ago or 150 years ago and they thought they had to bleed you to death or bleed you know what all the the stuff they they had tried to I'm glad they've learned to where they're at right now amen quite quite amazing what they can do in the time that we live in but there's a point that your doctor can only take you so far amen amen but see when it comes an operation there's many of them that have made the wrong moves there's many of them that's has done things and many of them malpractice and and done things on purpose and killed people come on now there there's many of them though that in their own wisdom and knowledge they tried to do their best they can and they and they and they slipped or in surgery or something happened and they lost patients or or the surgery didn't do no good but this doctor Jesus has not lost one patient he has not misjudged one case he is not misdiagnosed one case he he knows exactly what is going on in your life and he knows exactly what it will take to to heal that in your life he knows exactly but when the healing or the pill Comes The Gospel comes it's up to you to take it that's right amen it's up to you to believe that's not just Timothy PR or Tim PR or Joe Adams or Aaron Oglesby or whoever stand by in this pull pit that is a gospel that is being given to me and if I'll take it in my life it'll heal me of my disease it'll heal me of what I'm going through amen we've said it many times before and brother Tim's Used this analogy before but it's worth repeating with animals brother Tim was one of the best I've ever seen that diagnosing goats you know you could pull their eyelids back and they'd be pale and it's got worms Timothy go pull up so much MLS of sidon and give this and go get get pull this shot up and do this and so I'd go do it you know I'd go grab that goat chase that goat down or find it on the stand somewhere and grab a hold of his neck and pull it around open his mouth and push that right down that goat didn't have one choice whatsoever it was going to take that medicine because I had decided and brother Tim had decided this is what it needed this is what the problem is this is what it's got to have and so you grab a hold of the goat and you just put it right down its old throat and you just push it in or you pull a shot put it in this muscle or but under the skin however is however is to be given and it didn't have you could it couldn't say I I don't want that today I I don't feel like that's what I need I I want I want a second opinion there was no second opinions you know it was I was the only opinion that that was only that they couldn't say no but that's the difference between you and a goat you can hear the gospel and you can say well I want a second opinion I I just don't know if that'll do what I need I I just don't know if that's what what's important for me right now and if you're not careful you allow what can heal you go right by you what can deliver you if you're not take it cuz us as ministers we we can lay it out there we can put it before you but we cannot grab you by the neck open your mouth and shove it down your throat it don't work that way it's by faith amen by believing that is the truth and therefore I'm going to accept it as the truth for my situation and I know God a move for me he said if you could submit your case to Jesus Christ tonight just as you submit your case to the doctor come on now give me anything you want Lord amen come on now listen if you're sick enough you go to the doctor you say give me anything you got amen you know most people don't believe in doctors ain't never been sick come on I I I've heard it preached even in message circles around overseas especially especially in China about that you know if you you went to a doctor that mean you didn't have faith and and they preached that until they got sick and they needed to go to the doctor then they realized they needed a doctor and so all of a sudden it ain't the same anymore but I I believe they ought to live by what they preach amen there was people that lost children lost little babies and things because they wouldn't take them to the doctor because of what this man preached but when this man got in that situation he got sick enough he went to the doctor he ought to live by what he preached amen but listen you have to submit give me anything you want to Lord and listen that's the way we ought to come that's what real faith is whatever it is if it's if I need to Humble let it be a humble pill if I need to bow down and and worship you give me one of those pills if I need to ask for forgiveness give me that pill Lord whatever it is I want to take it I need help you're the doctor on the case then you can have Victory then you got faith that overcomes he said you'll never hunt another prayer line You'll never hunt nothing else you'll have it right there it'll be settled you'll never jump from church to church to see if this one's got it that one's got it they they haven't got it you got it then when you got the faith you got the victory he said I tell you what we need today in America and what we need to do in this Tabernacle is to let Dr Jesus come in and perform an operation on our Faith amen perform an operation on our faith the doctor tells you you got a little appendix it's all poison it ought to come out you got this or you got something else wrong it's got to come out what he takes out out so the rest of you can function right that's what's a matter with our fa Faith we're afraid to let God take his operating word his knife sharper than any two-edged sword and operate us and tell us that our little Fandango and our huming around is wrong and we got to turn loose of every shadow and sail towards God's Eternal promises hard as we go Jesus will perform an operation of our faith he'll take away all doubt he'll take away all fear he'll take away all worry he'll take everything out of there that's not supposed to be there when our faith is clearly operated on we will come out a new creature different can you trust Jesus for an operation excuse me can you trust Jesus for an operation can you trust him and believe in him and can you say Lord God at Thy word it's a gospel at Thy word you know as disciples in St Mark 5 they said we saned all night have taken nothing nevertheless Lord at Thy word I will let down the net amen they believe what he said Lord I'm I'm a fisherman I know this you know Peter Peter maybe said I know the signs of moon everything I know they're they're biting when they're not I know when they're in schools when they're not I I I've saned all night and here in the C Council of doctors here with me Dr fisherman we know our trade we searched the stream all night we've taken nothing but at Thy word I'll let down the net because the chief surgeon said so the chief doctor said to do it and then they was enclosed with such a multitude of fish until their Nets begin to break why faith is a victory there might not have been in one fish in that water but when God said it he'll create a fish there Hallelujah he'll put them there no matter what your senses declare come on somebody when he said by my stripes your heal amen he will put healing there no matter what your senses say if you'll take him at his word and say at TH word I'm putting down the net that's right said there may not be a chance you'll live you may be dying with cancer you may be bound to a wheelchair you may be totally blind I don't know what your trouble is but if you'll take Chief doctor's subscription whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it Hallelujah that's what's written on on the outside of your bottle amen whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it and believe that faith will overcome any difficult that is there you may be so burdened with sin until your soul as SMUD as can be you may have tried to get rid of that ill temper and that slandering tongue and that gospel gossip on the telephone you might have triy to ever remedy you know how but if you'll just let Jesus Christ coming tonight he will operate on your faith and give you a faith that'll climb Beyond anything the world could ever produce faith is the victory how could you doubt how could we doubt in the time that we're living in when we see the signs that are appearing all around us we see what's been written on here for thousands of years being fulfilled right here before our eyes we see visions that were given back in 1933 that are being fulfilled right one right after another yes but see that's a problem with a lot of people they tried to figure it all out and when they got down to their figure and and they couldn't figure him no more instead of believing anyway they went into doubt and unbelief yeah and then it led into doubting what a prophet said and doubting he even visited about an angel doubting that an angel even knew what he was talking about doubting that there was anything happened down Through the Ages doubting that Jesus was even born doubting that even was a God or is a God Amen it goes it's a it's a bottomless pit but when Jesus Christ the son of the Living God his presence is moving Among Us his great holy spirit is in this building the word promise Lo I'm with you always even to the end of the world it was a promise by the doctor God has to keep his word he when he promised he would do these things God is solemnly obligated to do what he said so that's where our faith has to rest it cannot rest on anything else if your faith is resting on feelings so if your feelings is up your faith is up if your feelings is down your faith is down if it's resting upon your sight as long as you see good things and your faith is seeing good things and long or if you see the storm around you then that's all your faith can see but if your faith is resting on the word the word word stays in that position it doesn't go down it doesn't go up it stays solid amen and long as it's resting upon what he said that it doesn't matter if your feelings are up or down or your sights up or down or or your hearings up or down that matters not anymore amen because there's a faith that is resting upon the word but we see is that we read about Mary and we're in the season of this know of course we don't believe that Jesus was born at Christmas day it's just a day that had been set aside for his birth and we know how they commercialized it and all that not going to get into all that but we know that he was born as a lamb and no doubt in the springtime brother brandom held this all the way through his ministry and and he said as a spring sun was Rising into Judean skies and Mary started walking down the street with a little water pot in her arm and he said her little mind was thinking of the day before how they went to the synagogue and they' heard the priest the rabbi preach a sermon and how he talked of how he explained to the people how they got settled in the land and how they got there and what they all went through and the promises that God had made to their father Abraham hundreds of years before that they would inherit that land and how when God had made the promise he would not go back on one promise and that they had come through the Red Sea as a dry ground and how that before that that God had taken them out of the hands of the enemy and how God loves to take his children out of the hands of the enemy that sounds like a pretty good sermon so far he loves to take his children out of the hands of the enemy I I tell you what I I just wanted to shout when I heard that because I I see a lot of cancer that's got our got God's children and I believe God's going to take them out of the hands of the enemy I see a lot of diseases a lot of sin a lot of things has got God's children and he takes them out of the hand of the Enemy by great signs and wonders and and he fed them in the wilderness for 40 years and what a great God they had but at the end of the message he runed everything he said because he said these great days of Jehovah dealing with people like that it isn't necessary no more we got the same rabbis in this day too and they get up and they say well this is not the season of Miracles rabbis in the message pull pit this is not the season of Miracles well let me tell you something what the prophet said he said if it's if the season of Miracles if it's not the season of Miracles then the if the if it's not the day of Miracles then it's not the day of God cuz God is a miracle so Miracles are always in season hallelujah amen healing is always in season amen deliverances is always in season because it's in God it's in his word and his word will not be unfulfilled it will not return unto him void but it will accomplish that what is sent to do so he said these great days of Jehovah dealing with people like that wasn't necessary no more become settled down in their Homeland they didn't exactly need Miracles no more they had good doctors for their sickness they're better off they had homes they didn't need God of Miracles anymore but somehow that didn't satisfy Joseph and Mary somehow something on the inside you know they' be to be engaged they were engaged to be married soon and and you know as a custom was after the service was over they would go to their home to the home there and she would come over and they would sit out on the porch there and would talk talk about things and they look across the hill where he was building a house for them and you know he was a carpenter and so he he would try to get all the doors to fit exactly right and the windows to fit exactly right cuz he was building a special place for his bride and the you know the windows had to be Plum and the door had to work operate operate right and all these things and they was talking about all the things and the colors and this that and the other then their thoughts started going towards what had been spoken oh yeah and he said Mary said you know since I heard that Rabbi say that that this great God has brought us here and made us who we are but he doesn't do things for us like he did then I've been thinking for a long time that if that that this God was as great in the days of our father as he was in the days of our grandfather why isn't he just the same great God today brother Rand said that's good thinking right there amen because if he was was God back then he's still the same today if he did Miracles back then he still does Miracles today if he healed back there he still heals today or he's not God and let's just fold it up and go home but he is God she goes back in the house she picks out a scroll and she comes back and it's Isaiah she opens it up and it just happens to follow on Isaiah 96 I love how he describes this scene I'm sorry maybe no I ain't sorry I believe you probably saw it all played out and he and he tells says we'll read some scriptures of just wherever God will lead us and she picked it up now and he turned it over the scroll and begin reading out of Isaiah 9:6 unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and she looks over there with her lovely soft eyes and said to her husband to be what do you think think the prophet was speaking of he said well Mary I I believe he was speaking of the Messiah that's to come and that's why we keep our bloodstream clean and we don't mix with other nations because someday God's going to send a messiah Among Us so the next morning as she's walking down the road she's thinking about these things and she's pondering upon them and and wondering how these things will all be and as as she's walking she begins to feel this warm feeling around her I felt that before myself feeling this warm feeling around her and you know it's usually when you're thinking about God and you're keeping them on your mind that's when God comes close to us amen I he said I think that's one of the Troubles of the people today we have too many other things in our mind even we come to a service we seem to think well if I don't get this or if I'm not prayed for if this don't it's don't we got to just let all of that go and start thinking about God God he's preaching to the angelist temple and he says this angelist Temple is thirsting for an outbreak of the Holy Spirit I wonder how many hands would go up and say I'm thirsting for that same thing I read that today I said I'm thirsting for that same thing an outbreak of the holy spirit amen he said I believe that God will let it happen he said let's just be positive in our thinking let's believe that this night a Revival would break come on somebody let's believe that this night God will do exceedingly above and beyond what we can think or he can do tonight don't take no for an answer come on now don't take no for an answer don't take Sunday for an answer don't take another day for an answer amen if we when we begin to think on these things you will begin to create an atmosphere around you that's why it is the time to believe because Believers when they begin to believe in possible situations through impossible things it begins to create an atmosphere around them that God can do what he said he would do and she was thinking on this and she ra raised her eyes and she thought she saw maybe a little Flicker and she thought what was that and she drops her little head again and pulls her Shaw up over her shoulders and she went on what did Isaiah 9:6 mean listen to this statement when God puts something on a person's heart he's ready to do something Mercy Jesus that's the reason he's ready to give this place an outbreak of the spirit of God because it's on our hearts come on now amen it's because it's on our hearts and that she thought on these things and while she raised her head again she felt real strange and thought wow what is going on and he said I just love to feel the presence of the Holy Spirit it just gives me Blessed Assurance you don't always see it but it's there anyhow and as she's moving along she raises her head again and there stood that great light before her perhaps the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel come walking from that light came an Archangel Gabriel and he said Hail Mary that means to stop blessed art thou among the women he said it's hard telling what the other women where they were at perhaps thinking about the washing they had to do or some task or something they had to do tomorrow brother Timothy it's Christmas I got still a lot of shopping to do you already thought about that ain't you I forgot to get the sour cream all kinds of things are going through our minds but if we'll keep him on our mind something will take place Hallelujah say Amen if we keep thinking on him and how great he is and how marvelous marvelous he is and how wonderful and how amazing and how powerful and how he answers prayer and how he how he touches Hearts I've seen him do it over here and I've seen him do it over there so I know he's still that kind of God I've seen him provide for this one so I know if he Pro if he provided for that one he's my provider too I seen him heal that one so I know if he healed he's my healer too amen things begin to change when you start thinking about him that's why the devil is always trying to keep our minds on something else we come we make all the effort we drive miles we go we beat ourselves trying to get off of work and we get here and we're so tired and sleepy sometimes or or this thing on our mind and we got that going on what is it he is trying to get our minds on something instead of on his appearing instead of his instead of him coming where he said where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be I wonder if there's any marriage that's been thinking about that today I wonder if there's anybody that says you know what tonight's Wednesday night I believe God can move in such a marvelous way and it'll change hearts forever and the presence of God will fall in our midst like never before and healings will take place and it not only fall in this place but people are hearing on stream and they'll watching and healing will take place in their living room it it'll take place on their treadmill it'll take place wherever they are why because a Mary begin to get something on her mind other than her Christmas dinner or her Christmas present or this that and the other amen she saw this great Angel it startled her came close to her and saluted Ed her and gave her a message that was a hard message for her to believe a little virgin girl going to receive a child that was more outstanding and hard to believe than anything he had ever given to anyone sounds like the Mary of today believing for a body change a rapture not just one in Enoch not just a change as Elijah would take a chariot no a Rapture of a bride around the world Amen Mary believing that something's about to take place something is going to go something is going to happen something is happening and and know and and it was a hard thing for this little girl to believe 6 months before he had met with Zacharias and the the priest in the temple a priest a preacher who should know the words who who should know an angel when he sees an angel who should believe when he hears him speak to him but he doubted him and from his doubt he took away his speech that's right he said how can this be I'm old my wife is old and he had plenty of examples in the Bible he had Hannah in the temple he had he had had that never had a baby and was had had a child he had had Sarah that would was way almost almost 100 years old over 90 years old when she had Isaac and here this little woman had to believe something that never happened a woman having a baby without knowing a man she said how shall these things be my Lord I want you to understand something that was not a question of doubt that was like help me just to understand help me to know how you going to do this cuz I know I can't do this I know I cannot make my body change I know I cannot receive a child without knowing a man it said it's scientifically impossible he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and the holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God watch her now she didn't question that she said behold the hands made unto the Lord be it unto me that's be it unto me according to what you have said according to Thy word what you have spoken be it unto me come on do we have any marriage here tonight and said Lord you said it now be it unto me you said by my stripes your heal be it unto me according to Thy word I believe what you [Applause] say if we could just do that he says that's what God loves that's the only way to get right with God is to take him at his word that's the only way there is to please God is to take him and don't trust your knowledge you'll reason at all how can this be done and can't be done when you reason you lose the victory we must cast down reasons and believe what God Said is the truth Mary took him at his word and he changed the whole course of night natural life for her he will change the course of your life tonight if you'll take him at his word hallelujah if you're a sinner he will straighten that crooked life out if you're vile and immoral he'll make you pure as a lily if you'll just take him at his word that vile conscious of sin that makes you look at immoral things and use the name of the Lord in vain have tempered enough to fight a buzz all he'll change that course of life for you if you'll just take him at his word if you have cancer tonight he'll change that for you and bring you health it's in all he's the Lord God that heals all th diseases if you have tuberculosis or sickness of any kind that the doctors cannot help he will change that for you if you take him at his word and this is his word I am the Lord thy God that heals all somebody say all all thy diseases at they be it unto me Here I Am Lord at Thy word what you have said I believe let it be done as soon as the angel had told her about her cousin and she accepted the Lord's will to be done the only thing she knew would happen that the Holy Spirit was going to do it if we could only get that settled in our hearts how can cancer be cured when the doctors give up it's not me to me to try to figure out is to take the word of the Holy Spirit he's the one that made the promise he's the one that confirms the promise he's the one that's obligated to the promise I want you he I want you to notice another little thing about Mary she didn't wait till she was positive well I'll just wait till I feel a little movement and then I'll say something about it no she didn't wait she didn't wait till she felt life or some physical sign that she was going to have this baby before she said anything about it God's word was good enough when's God's word going to be good enough to us that's going to be enough it's going to be the final say it's going to be the period it's going to be the everything it's going to be the absolute it's going to be the all it's going to be the end all it's going to be nothing after it God's word and that's it amen this is what he said he is obligated to that word the word was good enough for her and she started rejoicing right away yes sir Hallelujah Mary could have waited till she had some sign feel a leg poke over here that she was going to be a mother feel little swelling going on something happening she could have waited till she had signs hello that's the way we want we want signs first then we'll believe fell right off right over there somewhere we want signs first then we will believe we want something happening you know some physical thing to happen well I feel better so I believe God healed me that has nothing to do with it that's right you may go home and 72 hours later you feel feel more sick than you ever felt does that mean God didn't heal you but too many people have allowed amen their feelings to dictate their belief they've allowed well I feel good today I'm Healed I don't feel good today I'm sick it don't matter none of that happened that none of that matters what matters is his word you could wait till after the meeting's over until you feel you could move your crippled leg just a little better you could hear a little better out of a deaf ear or cancer seemed to be was wasn't bothering you so much that's not taking God as his word to take God as his word is to hear his word accept it and start rejoicing come on somebody Amen to hear it accept it and start rejoicing and say it is done he said we could have 500 M we talking to that saying Angelos Tabernacle he said we can have 500 rush to the altar tonight which be a good sign that a Revival is breaking out we don't have to have a 500 at altar we just have to take God at his word and start rejoicing come on somebody take God of his word and start rejoicing something will happen that brings the word to life is when we water it with praises come on somebody I ain't got nothing in my bank account but that doesn't matter I'm going to praise God any I don't feel good tonight that matters n I'm going to rejoice in the Lord anyhow cuz he has done great things for me Hallelujah he healed my body he saved my soul Hallelujah I ain't got one sign my son's coming home but I'm going to Rejoice anyhow I'm going to praise God no matter [Applause] what that rejoicing begins to water the word what makes the seed grow water well is his word thank you Mr angel thank you I'll go home and think about that I go and before you could even think about it you thought about something else Mercy our minds are so busy anymore you can't even think about what you're thinking about that's pretty good right there I before you even thought about it you didn't thought about 500 other things and you forgot what you was thinking about how many times how many times you walk to go get something before you got there you forgot what you went to walk for it don't just happen to old people it happens to everybody anymore our minds on all kinds of stuff I never forget tell one on brother Tim he used to go in a room and I started doing the same thing A B C D E F G cuz you hope that by the time you hit the letter you remember what it was H oh your Hammer that's right because our minds are on all kinds of things I just texted back brother D David mayor today he texted me back Thursday last week I believe it was if I looked at it correctly and I've he asked me when our October meetings was you know what I did I went to go get the date for him and before I got the date I thought about something else and I ain't remembered him no more until I went to date to send him another text I'm like oh yeah brother David the uh the meetings are October the 10th to the 13th you listening I said but then I ask him other qu listen our minds are so fed up with other stuff Satan is a he's he's he's made this age and so we get into well I thank you thank you Mr angel thank you thank you I I think that's pretty good word I think that's all right I I just go home and think about it that wasn't what Mary did she didn't think about it cuz she' have thought about it she thought wild I don't know how I'm going to do this it's not about you doing it it's about what he's done it's about him taking it Taking the range and him oper operating in your life only thing you got to do you know the only thing you got to do when he has it in his word is to believe it and to accept it and to Rejoice over it did I read that right let me go back and see if I can find that hear his word accept it and start rejoicing it ain't figure it out and make all the EX's my it ain't algebra it ain't geometry it ain't none of that it ain't nothing you got to figure out God has already got the answer yes sir he's already got it he knows exactly how he's going to fulfill it the only thing you've got to do is say yes Lord I've heard it I accept it and I praise you for it I thank you right now for my healing I thank you right now for my son and my daughter I thank you right now for the Salvation of my children I thank you right [Applause] now when Jesus told them to wait in the upper room in Jerusalem until they was dued with power on high that word fell on their ears they was in that Temple continually praising God day and night what were they doing watering the promise this is why Satan's always against our praise well you got the word what you supposed to water the word that's what I hear a prophet saying water that promise and all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house that were setting the word was being watered amen and it took life and started going if you want a Revival start watering the word it's a promise that makes me feel religious right now I want to come out of the wheelchair start watering the word I want to come out of cancer start watering the word he heals cancer he heals all our sickness thousand times thousand thousands of infallible proofs we've seen and even in our day we've seen proofs Mary started quickly testifying she's going to have this baby how was she going to have it she never know a man there was never such things ever happened before but she just took God's word as what it meant what he said it and she believed it and began to Rejoice if each person in here tonight that's bound with sin in your life will just take him at his word and start rejoicing because Jesus said he that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out woo Jesus that's a lot to Rejoice about there amen you come to him he's not going to cast you out amen you ask for bread he's not going to give you a stone amen you ask and you shall receive she was so happy about it so happy that God had permitted her yes to be the one to fulfill This Promise am come on now why you all in your wowy wowy Woos when God has permitted you he's permitted you to be the bride in this last day not be out some denominational snare somewhere or in some sin pot somewhere but he's approved of you and he's called you by name and he's pulled you out of sin and he's pulled you out of unbelief he's pulled you out of the world and he said you're [Applause] he didn't leave you where he found you he didn't leave you in that Darkness he didn't leave you in that pit of despair but he reached down Hallelujah and the devil thought he had you down far enough but it wasn't too far that he couldn't reach down and grab a hold of you and pick you up but not only has he picked you up he's washed you he's cleaned you and not only has he done that he has filled you with his own life there's something to Rejoice about he allowed you to fulfill this he was so happy about it she was so happy sometimes when you're going in the middle of it it's hard to be happy so happy that God had permitted her to let a firsthand Miracle be performed on her she was so happy and to hear about her husband her cousin Elizabeth that she took off and began to run to see her 6 months she'd been with child pretty well wearied about it little baby been promised her in old age six months and there was no life in that little baby yet that's all together unnormal for about at 3 or 4 months life appears but it was 6 month and there was no life and Elizabeth had hid herself cuz she didn't see it being fulfilled somehow down in her heart she believe though in her fearful condition that if God had given a promise to Zachariah her husband a just man she prayed for this baby and signs were showing and she needed the little booties to get ready that's it that's exactly what you do make ready for it Hallelujah I'm not making us up that's a direct quote get ready for it tonight get your blanket off your body get your foot on the floor get ready come on out of the wheelchair come on off the bed make ready for it come out of your doldrums come out of your unbelief come out of your depression come out of your fear and the UN come out of it it's get ready for it told my wife the other ask I'm so sick of being depressed she said that's good news come on somebody if you're sick of being sick that's good news if you're sick of being bow that's good news if you're sick of that Old Devil that's trying to hold at you that's good news make ready for it you're coming out make ready for you're leaving that place and you're going on to the promises of God brother Brown tells about a man in South Africa never had a pair of shoes on his feet in his life been back in the jungles born with deformed feet he came walking up through the prayer line clubbing his little feet along had a shoe box under his arm woo how many tonight come walking in here with your promise [Applause] Hallelujah had a shoe box under his arm amen here clubbing the hall they said what in the world is in there he said a pair of shoes what do you expect to do them I'm going to wear them when the service was over he had those shoes on running down the yard just as hard as he could go praising God what did he do he took God at his word he he said so much and when he was asked he said I've seen others come up crippled and go home healed I've seen others that were blind that can see God won't turn me down oh Jesus if we can get that Revelation tonight God won't turn you down God won't turn you down God won't turn you down ask and you shall receive but walk in here with your promise what you got my promise why you got it cuz I believe it and I know he's going to perform what he said he would [Applause] do God won't turn me [Applause] down hallelujah hallu hallelujah he said Mary knew God wouldn't turn her down either put your spiritual thinking caps on for a minute he said if there was ever a time in the Church of God that needs some more marries it's today take God at his word she didn't wait till she was positive she didn't was going to have this child she she didn't wait till she felt life before she said anything about it she didn't she she started testifying she started telling people she's going to have this baby and there wasn't one sign of it God give us some more marriage don't wait for a sign don't wait for a Wonder it'll come take God at his word and start rejoicing saying it's going to happen why God said [Applause] so he said I believe if every patient in this building right now would accept that upon God's on the grounds of God's word and believe it and start testifying and praising God for your healing this meeting would not close with one crippled person in here God is under obligation God give us some more marriage down here in Cleveland that'll take God his word and testify about it before it even happens notice she took God his word God said she's going to have a baby she told he told it behind an angel that was good enough for her he said well I Need an Angel we had an angel it was the seventh angel this is the word that I'm preaching you tonight it's out of the mouth of the angel sure and he's needing a mar that says be it unto me according to Thy word I believe it I don't care what doubts arise I don't care what a Critic says what or this preacher says that it has nothing to do with it I'm just going to rejoice and water of the word and watch it grow it's what we're called to do that's who we are it is the time for Faith it is the time to believe so when you follow the Commandments of God and take God at his word these signs shall follow them that believe so you don't have to worry about the signs they're behind you they're coming brother Danny steam done that analogy there at Youth Camp maybe some of y'all remember put a couple young guys behind him called s signs and wonders and he just showed you you're a Believer wherever you go signs and wonders follow you went all over the place and they're following right behind him that's what they do because you are who you are these signs shall follow them that believe God sent gifts and everything else to prove to us that he's with us and we lay hands on you and believe it with all your heart get off the go off the platform and you say it's a finished work God said so you say well you're paralyzed can't even move a finger I'm already healed how do you know God said so brother Bram said so no I never said so God said so God's word is true and nothing can stop it come on now let's put it out there cancer cannot stop it it's against the people of God we got brother Ron Spencer we got sister Genie camp we got brother Joel C that's in the middle of a battle and many others no doubt but cancer cannot stop it amen when a marriage says be it unto me according to Thy word it is finished it is done I wish we had more marries here now behold the hands made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word she never questioned other thing she never waited till she felt life she never waited till she felt positive she didn't wait till she seen seen that something ceased by her glory that's good enough when God said so that settles it the word was good enough behold the hands maiden of the Lord beat unto me according to Thy word and start rejoicing and start rejoicing When You Believe The Impossible if the doctor says you got cancer and you're dying you got to believe the impossible to see new life take hold on you if the doctor says You'll Never Walk you got to believe the impossible to see New Life come into you new life in them fibers oh God bring forth a hand bring forth a new arm bring forth new lungs bring forth a new stomach Whatever It Is God will do it if you take him at his word he is the one that said let there be and the very thing we're sitting on was not seen before the very son we admire today was not seen before it was made out of things that was not seen so if he could do that and we walk around on this thing all day we don't think nothing about it but it's a very creative word of God that spoke something out of nothing and that sun we look at and the moon we look at the stars we look at and we think wow that's amazing sometimes we take a moment to pause up and wow other night they had a beautiful it was a beautiful uh meteor shower that went over beautiful man it was just going over it's incredible it's amazing what God did out of nothing it was nothing nothing times nothing times nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing and he said let there be and it was and we look at it every day and don't think nothing about it so common it's just everyday occurrence the sun comes up it's been coming up for thousands of Year brother Timothy what's the big deal that's the spoken word of God that is a sign to you that his word works every day how much more could that God who created something out of nothing create a new liver check he's done that create a new heart check he's done that create a new stomach check he's done that come on now create a new pancreas check he's done that he's the Creator and he does things out of nothing but all he wants is someone to say be it unto me at Thy word at Thy word I'm just going to take you at what you said I don't have to figure it all out I don't have to add it all up you said I could have the Holy Ghost I accept it I let my life just die out say Lord take me I take you Lord as my king and my Lord be it unto me it's not algebra it's not geometry it's dying out and saying be it unto me at Thy word we need some more Marys amen that'll just look that angel in the face and say I don't know how all this is going to happen but it doesn't matter how all that matters is you said and at Thy word we go back to those disciples for a moment they sitting on their stump fished all night discouraged yeah they was discouraged wanted to give up they knew how to fish there fish there's fishermen they wasn't somebody just bought a boat and decided to go fishing it's what they did and they knew all the tricks they knew when they biting they knew all the things that how to throw a net how to do how to hang it how to do and here they stumped and they're like man we've just done this all night long and didn't get one fish we tried everything we could and didn't get one thing and as they sitting there one of them said well here comes that preacher guy let's see what he going to say so I can see that old Apostle get a chunk and sit down and begin to L listen he said man there's something different about this fell he moves his chunk of stump a little closer till he's finally standing right beside him cuz there was something about him that Drew him to Jesus there's something about Jesus Jesus that Drew him he said he still got the same power if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me we were just talking about this the other day brother Jeremy kkin is not here he's up up there now with his wife and brother Ben puit church but he was saved there at a youth camp we're just going back through it again with someone the other day was talking about how the first night he just sat on the very back as far as he could get nearly but Tim and instructed the gator Patrol we call him the deacons not to say anything cuz normally we try to keep the young people up but we knew he was a special special guy wasn't there because he wanted to he's there because his uncle tricked him let's just be honest said you want to go camping so he's going camping shows up at a youth camp whatever you got to do to get him there before the Lord I admire that so he did he had a see what happened was and let's just put it out very plainly something had come on brother Jeff's heart for Him and when something comes on somebody's heart God's about to do something in the first night he's all the way in the back and as the service is progress he's he's getting closer and getting closer and getting closer till he's sitting nearly on the front row if not the front row until that Saturday morning when it gave his heart to God to be changed from that time forever more if I be lifted up if I be lifted up this is what the preaching of the word does it's lifting him up out of history it's lifting him up off the pages of the Bible and showing you he is the same yesterday today and forever I will draw all men unto me and here he is being lifted up and it's drawing Peter closer and closer and closer the crowd got so great he stepped on the boat and Peter said to Peter Thrust out a little bit I want to preach a while stood there and begin to preach a while then after he got through he borrowed Simon's boat he never borrows anything unless he pays for it you can't outg give God he said now Simon I want you to thrust out into the deep launch out he said I'd like to speak on that just for a moment launch out that's what the trouble with people's faith is tonight you're afraid to turn it loose come on somebody there's many of you that's got faith but you're afraid to let it loose your faith without works is dead just as the body without the spirit is dead if you got faith show me your faith by your works now Paul was justifying Abraham by faith James Justified him by works Paul said Abraham was justified Romans 4 by faith so James come over and said he justify works by both of them one confirmed the other Paul was speaking what God saw his faith Jesus James was speaking what man saw works so if you say I got faith in God and afraid to put your faith to work it's not good you have to launch it out that's what's a matter many of people are afraid to launch out you're afraid to venture a little bit just to say well I can I can do all things with Christ to strength amen look at him said launch out into the deep you see somebody jumping up and down in about 4ot of water saying they can swim you know they can't swim they ain't prove nothing I don't care how much they say they can swim oh yeah but you get them in over their heads you get them in over their heads amen it'll it'll it'll determine right then if they can swim or if they're going to drown that's what brother brand talked about he said he said you got to launch out you got to get out deep enough amen what was one of the problems going off with this one of the prophets in the Old Testament said I I was Waters ankle deep and then all the way and said then we got into Waters to swim in come on now God wants to take you further and further and further until you don't have no more support under you you can't support yourself no more you can't do nothing about it no more you don't know you can just flop around all you want to but I on you're wrong you can't do nothing about it so he takes you out in places that you will know when you get there this has nothing to do with me it's all about him and he took Peter to a place that he knew I know there's no fish here I done tried it on my own it's impossible launch out the deep and let down for the drought what Lord we fished all night well I've tried so many services I've tried so many times Lord I've tried and I've tried and I've tried that's right you tried now he's telling you go on out a little deeper throw down your net Peter looks at all of that and he says but at Thy word at Thy word I'm going to let down the net and he lets down the net he said see there's a secret at Thy word taking God at his word just face value what he said it's what he said take it at his word if there was no fish there God will put a fish there he did do it the same net that went through the water all night long and caught nothing I went through the service after service after service and I caught nothing but when God said put it right there and tonight you may have sang through every doctor's office you may have sang through every healing meeting you may have sang through every service but tonight at Thy word Lord I put on the net that's the way it is at Thy word I'm going to let it down cuz you told me if I ask anything in your name there you would do it and I believe it to be the truth and I'm letting it down at your command Don't Be Afraid ask a whole lot see it wasn't Jesus desire to give him two fish that's what we you know we our our minds we think well I just get a little bit that'll bit no big things are as easy to ask for as little things cuz but with God nothing there's no difference between a big thing and a little thing it's all the same to him and just as easy to perform it does not matter if it's a tooth acers if it's cancer it doesn't matter if it's sin or whatever it is amen a little thing big thing that has not that's that's only in our own human intellect we add things up how we think they ought to go first place second place third place fourth place God doesn't do any of that it's all the same to him he just says ask and ye shall receive you may have tried time after time but you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not ask and you shall receive and will let down for the draw he said I seen that little Apostle running in the big S out in the water getting ready and when he begin to pull on that net he made a couple pulls there was nothing and while something was begin to tug it begin to hold just let all left down one time and try a little effort you might not feel much a second effort you might not feel much maybe several efforts will happen but after a while a tug something will happen something's on the other end of the line Hallelujah something's on the end of the line God will put a fish there God will fill your net if you will ask him and [Applause] believe hallelujah how many has a need
