[39:32] thank you for the call of God in our

[39:35] thank you for calling us and believing
[39:38] in us that we could stand in this evil
[39:40] day
[39:41] or we love you with all of our hearts in
[39:43] Jesus name
[39:46] amen turn to Galatians 5 and verse 1.
[39:51] amen it's good to be back home with you
[39:55] again even if it's just for a moment me
[39:58] and sister Ruth and sister Katie and I
[40:00] think sister Rebecca is going with us
[40:02] tomorrow we're going to be up in
[40:04] Missouri this weekend ministering it
[40:06] brother Ben Beard's church it was
[40:08] formerly brother Harold Browns and and
[40:11] um
[40:12] I just ask you to pray for us then we'll
[40:13] be home for a little while and be
[40:15] looking forward to that but we had a
[40:17] good time while we was away was that
[40:18] brother Josh Bennett's dedication
[40:20] meeting and just had a wonderful time in
[40:23] the presence of the Lord and God done
[40:25] some wonderful things there they have a
[40:27] beautiful building that the Lord has has
[40:29] given them and and uh and and they moved
[40:33] from a little small little place into
[40:34] then covered struck and had to go into a
[40:37] gymnasium and then different things
[40:39] happen and their Church grew and they
[40:41] wasn't able to even thinking about think
[40:43] about going back to where they came from
[40:45] and but God had greater plans and they
[40:48] have a nice build a nice facility there
[40:50] and we thank the Lord for that then we
[40:52] went to brother Donnie Reagan's
[40:54] dedication there at the Word of Life
[40:57] Tabernacle and and that's a beautiful
[40:59] place as well that the Lord has given
[41:02] and we thank the Lord for all that he's
[41:04] done something struck me very uh you
[41:06] know a lot of people get tangled up and
[41:08] thinking that we ought not have nice
[41:09] churches and things and you know we not
[41:12] do too many nice things but but Don he
[41:15] said somebody had sent him something on
[41:16] what the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[41:18] cost
[41:20] you heard it didn't you 330 million
[41:23] dollars for a tent
[41:26] that's quite incredible and then then
[41:28] the building the Temple was 30 billion
[41:31] dollars uh God doesn't mind spending
[41:34] money on his own place and I believe we
[41:37] ought to have something nice for him and
[41:39] you know it really ain't the building
[41:40] it's the people right
[41:42] amen that's what makes it all and then
[41:44] as brother Tim would preach their first
[41:46] night on Friday night I'm sure you heard
[41:48] it but the building is just an empty
[41:50] building and just just a gathering of
[41:52] people if it's not for the glory of God
[41:54] there and that's what we want is the
[41:56] glory of God Among Us amen let's read
[41:59] here in Galatians 5 and verse 1 says
[42:01] Stand Fast therefore and the Liberty
[42:04] wherewith Christ has made us free and be
[42:08] not entangled again with the Yoke of
[42:10] bondage
[42:11] amen we let you be seated
[42:14] you know I yesterday we had July the 4th
[42:19] and it's has been quite a holiday in our
[42:22] country
[42:23] for some time men or women are kind of
[42:26] turning against it now in the time that
[42:28] we're living in and and not really
[42:30] wanting to celebrate the freedoms that
[42:32] we have enjoyed for many years and we
[42:35] definitely see this land that was raised
[42:38] up as a lamb is beginning to speak as a
[42:40] dragon
[42:41] and they're coming against the freedoms
[42:44] that were given us by men who had Faith
[42:47] uh men of faith that would rise up
[42:49] against the church and the Tyranny that
[42:52] was there in their land and so we want
[42:54] to land where we can worship God as we
[42:56] would want to worship God and we could
[42:58] give God the glory and honor that he
[43:00] deserved in the way that we want to and
[43:02] so they would by faith they would get on
[43:04] boats and they would come across a great
[43:07] ocean and they would begin to search out
[43:09] and find a place and they begin to you
[43:12] know as as the nation was formed and I'm
[43:14] not going to go into all of that we have
[43:16] a little bit of History here but uh you
[43:18] know they wrote out the uh the the
[43:21] Declaration of Independence and then the
[43:23] Constitution and all those things in the
[43:26] thought of freedom and the thought of a
[43:29] man being free they knew what it was
[43:31] like to be under oppression and to do
[43:34] things a certain way and and to only be
[43:36] able to serve God in certain manners and
[43:38] so they wanted a place where man could
[43:40] be free and and I'm thankful for this
[43:43] country that we have and and God has
[43:45] used it in many ways and we know that
[43:47] that what is what its end is going to be
[43:50] but that's because of Prophecy but you
[43:53] know God raised it up for a purpose and
[43:55] and he raised it up for a place and a
[43:57] time and man that God could use it in
[43:59] the time and manner that he has but you
[44:02] know I got to thinking about freedom and
[44:04] how men and women are coming against it
[44:06] and and calling it different things and
[44:08] I'm not going to get into the political
[44:10] side of it but I thought about you know
[44:12] thinking about this day of how many men
[44:15] gave their lives and women gave their
[44:18] lives that we could have this Freedom uh
[44:21] you know I want to speak about that the
[44:22] cost of freedom because Freedom has a
[44:25] price freedom is not free someone died
[44:29] that we could have freedom you know
[44:32] Freedom means to be one who is not a
[44:35] slave one who has ceased to be a slave
[44:37] who is freed amen is exempt unrestrained
[44:41] not Bound by obligation but somebody
[44:44] amen had to die that we could have the
[44:47] freedom that we enjoyed today now as I
[44:49] said we see it going away very quickly
[44:51] and you know but I got to looking at
[44:54] different things that men have said down
[44:55] through history and one struck me as
[44:58] John F Kennedy he would say the cost of
[45:00] freedom is always high but Americans
[45:03] have always paid it but one path we will
[45:06] never choose and that is the path of
[45:09] surrender or submission and I thought
[45:11] you know that's a wonderful thought
[45:13] because you know there is a cost of
[45:15] freedom but there is also a cost of
[45:18] surrender there's also a cost of
[45:20] submission but you know you know does
[45:22] freedom have a cost and I just want to
[45:24] go through a few things as we begin to
[45:26] look at this thought you know it says
[45:28] ask the question again of the remnants
[45:31] of that same second ranger battalion
[45:33] that's now reinforced and assigned to a
[45:36] hill 400 in eastern France late in
[45:38] November the first Army had already
[45:40] thrown four divisions at the the hill
[45:42] 400 with crushing losses the conditions
[45:45] were even worse than at the point still
[45:47] the Rangers went in knowing the risk
[45:50] outnumbered ten to one their original
[45:52] strength of three full companies
[45:54] eventually were reduced to just five
[45:57] officers and 86 men but they took that
[46:01] hill in two days The Cost of Freedom is
[46:04] not able to be calculated amen ask the
[46:08] 19 year old teenagers the average age of
[46:11] the first U.S Marine Division who landed
[46:14] August the 7th 1942 on the North shore
[46:17] shore of Guadalcanal a small tropical
[46:20] island not far from Australia guatem
[46:23] Canal was the first time that Americans
[46:25] forces stopped the Japanese sweep in the
[46:28] South Pacific turning the tide of War 19
[46:30] year old boys but at what cost under
[46:34] Fire during the landing the naval forces
[46:36] pulled away leaving these young marines
[46:38] without air support with most of their
[46:40] heavy weapons and tanks and all the rest
[46:42] of their supplies left with them but
[46:45] these young teenagers hung on in that
[46:47] rain-soaked malaria-ridden land fighting
[46:50] off snakes leeches jungle rot is well
[46:53] entrenched Army for the next six months
[46:55] Guadalcanal became hell for both the
[46:58] Young Marines and the Defenders when in
[47:00] early 1943 the Japanese pulled out only
[47:03] ten thousand soldiers were left of their
[47:06] original 400 or 40 000 the first Marines
[47:09] required a full year of Rehabilitation
[47:12] before they could be called a fighting
[47:14] unit again having lost many thousands
[47:17] dead and wounded The Cost of Freedom
[47:20] cannot be calculated amen he said think
[47:23] of the 56 signers of the Declaration of
[47:26] Independence in 1776 individually each
[47:30] of them had more to lose and to gain by
[47:33] signing this document most of them were
[47:36] already men of standing in their
[47:37] communities Highly Educated owners of
[47:40] substantial property John Hancock the
[47:43] richest man in America became a wanted
[47:45] man with a price on his head they did
[47:48] not choose to revolt they were mainly
[47:50] meanly merely wanting to be treated the
[47:52] same as other Englishmen in the that
[47:55] were in England but they all knew that
[47:57] the pennant what the penalty was for
[47:59] treason it was death by hanging but each
[48:01] signer immediately become a Marked Man
[48:04] Pursuit relentlessly by the re by the
[48:08] British army not none who had property
[48:11] or family were spared most lived to see
[48:14] their families killed separated forever
[48:16] their property sacked nine signers died
[48:20] of wounds or hardships during the war
[48:22] many died in poverty the fathers of our
[48:25] country their pledge Our lives our
[48:27] Fortune our sacred honor was no Idol
[48:31] boasts The Cost of Freedom cannot be
[48:34] calculated
[48:35] hey man you know it it comes with a
[48:38] price it comes with a call so I think
[48:41] we're up to 1.4 million men that have
[48:43] died Amen in the fight for freedom but
[48:46] Patrick Henry we know the the last few
[48:48] lines of his of his speech it says give
[48:51] me libertarian give me death but this
[48:53] man stood to lose a lot when he stood
[48:55] here and he gave this gave this speech
[48:58] but I want you to hear it in its
[49:00] entirety says if we were base enough to
[49:02] desire it is it now too late to retire
[49:05] from the contest there is no retreat but
[49:08] in submission and slavery amen our
[49:11] chains are already forged they're
[49:13] clanking may be heard on the plains of
[49:15] Boston the war is an inedible and let it
[49:19] come I repeat sir let it come it is in
[49:23] vain sir to extenuate the matter
[49:25] gentlemen May Cry peace peace but there
[49:28] is no peace the war is actually already
[49:31] begun the next Gale that sweets from the
[49:34] north will bring to our ears there's a
[49:36] clash of resounding arms our Brethren
[49:38] are already in the field why stand here
[49:41] till we die why stand here Idol what is
[49:45] that gentleman's wish what would they
[49:47] have it's life so dear or peace so sweet
[49:51] as to be purchased at the price of
[49:53] change and slavery forbid it almighty
[49:56] God I know not what course my others may
[49:59] take but as for me Give me liberty or
[50:03] give me death
[50:04] in other words if it ain't Liberty then
[50:06] Chain's away slavery awaits so there is
[50:09] a cost of freedom but there's also a
[50:12] cost to not accepting the freedom or not
[50:14] fighting for the freedom amen there is a
[50:17] cause to have freedom and liberty in the
[50:19] house of God but there's also a cost and
[50:22] and a change that comes with it for not
[50:26] standing and fighting for having Liberty
[50:28] in the house of almighty God there is a
[50:31] cause for preaching the gospel but
[50:33] there's also a cause for not preaching
[50:35] the gospel
[50:36] amen there is a cause for living for
[50:39] this this life that we live but there's
[50:41] also a cause for not living the life
[50:44] that we live
[50:45] there is a cost of freedom and there and
[50:48] it's way it's a price is worth paying
[50:51] amen you know we're going to have wars
[50:53] we're going to it's already here you
[50:55] know you're not going to live a while a
[50:57] life without fighting I don't care what
[50:59] side you're on you're either going to
[51:00] fight your way to heaven or you're going
[51:02] to fight your way to hell
[51:05] come on now amen don't look out there in
[51:08] the world and think they got it easier
[51:09] no sir they got it worse amen they're
[51:12] living a life full of hell and full of
[51:14] anxieties and full of worries and they
[51:17] don't have nothing to stand upon their
[51:19] life is tore up from one end to the
[51:21] other they may be singing the brother
[51:22] they may be singing and shouting and
[51:24] carrying on all they want to and saying
[51:27] hey we said we're living a good life and
[51:28] drinking it up and partying up but
[51:31] they're paying the price the wages of
[51:33] sin or death amen there is a price that
[51:37] has to be paid no matter what size you
[51:39] take you know even the Bible and I I was
[51:42] looking at this this Bible came at cost
[51:46] we look at it today and well you know
[51:48] this is this is a really nice Bible my
[51:50] wife actually bought for me it's got
[51:52] goat skin leather and things and it's
[51:54] been a wonderful Bible That's lasted me
[51:56] a very long time you can buy one for
[51:58] about 300 bucks if you'd like to have it
[52:00] maybe get one for thirty dollars but it
[52:02] came for more than dollars it costs more
[52:06] than dollars
[52:07] amen you know there's many men that
[52:10] would actually why cliff and different
[52:12] ones that would work and give their
[52:13] lives for the translation of the Bible
[52:16] and but one man I want to read about is
[52:19] William Tyndale and what he went through
[52:20] you know he was found guilty of heresy
[52:24] and translate in the Bible from Greek to
[52:27] English
[52:29] he would and for for being guilty of
[52:31] doing that he was tied to a stake and he
[52:34] was strangled to death and burnt to
[52:36] ashes William Tyndale is popular known
[52:39] as the father of the English Bible a
[52:41] brilliant person who spoke 12 languages
[52:43] 12 languages fluently at 21. man
[52:48] I barely speak one of them
[52:50] amen many historians historians debate
[52:54] on his actual birth but not much is even
[52:56] known about his childhood but it is
[52:58] believed that according to Tyndale the
[53:00] church priests were not following the
[53:03] actual teachings of God amen amen thus
[53:06] misleading people amen one Catholic
[53:09] clergyman once once said to him we are
[53:11] better to be without God's law than the
[53:14] popes
[53:15] can you imagine this we are better to be
[53:18] without God's law than the Pope's law to
[53:21] this statement he responded if God
[53:24] spares me air many years I will cause a
[53:27] boy that drives a plow to know more of
[53:30] their scriptures than you do
[53:35] I'm thankful he was willing to pay the
[53:37] cost
[53:39] at some point he was ordained even as a
[53:42] priest and later a chaplain but remember
[53:44] nothing fighting evils nothing fighting
[53:47] frightens evil men more than a good man
[53:50] who's willing to stand in their way his
[53:52] sediments around religions threatened
[53:54] these leaders of the church and the
[53:57] authorities leading his dismissal as a
[53:59] man of values and principles he was
[54:01] willing to die for it his dismissal was
[54:04] a blessing in disguise because it gave
[54:07] him more time to translate the Bible
[54:11] so he there when he began to fully
[54:13] dedicate his life to studying and
[54:15] teaching the gospel and and begin to
[54:18] work among those that had this language
[54:20] bearing realize that these people needed
[54:22] the Bible in their own language see we
[54:25] know the people England they didn't
[54:27] speak or hear Greek or Hebrew and but
[54:29] that was what the Bible was written in
[54:31] or maybe Latin but they could understand
[54:32] that so the church could say whatever
[54:35] they wanted to say decree whatever they
[54:37] wanted to say do it however they wanted
[54:40] to do it and you couldn't do nothing
[54:41] about it because you didn't even know
[54:42] what the bible really said so he said I
[54:45] want to put the Bible in the people's
[54:47] hands and so he began to give his life
[54:49] to it and and The Possession back in the
[54:52] days of possession the Bible sacred and
[54:54] translating it without the king or The
[54:56] Bishop's permission was strictly
[54:58] forbidden and William headed to the
[55:01] bishop of London to Cuthbert Tunstall to
[55:05] seek consent but Tunstall refused to
[55:08] Grant his wishes devoted to the cause
[55:10] William wouldn't let anyone stand in his
[55:13] way and he secretly begin to search for
[55:15] people that had any form of print and
[55:17] equipment or connections lucky for him
[55:19] he found what several traders who were
[55:21] smuggling Martin Luther's writings from
[55:24] Germany and they encouraged him to flee
[55:25] from England to Europe and would help
[55:27] him smuggle the Bibles thereafter filled
[55:30] with happiness and fear William left
[55:31] England under a false name and began to
[55:34] work and head into Germany and begin to
[55:37] work and work and work knowing his life
[55:40] was at stake with every letter he wrote
[55:45] and it would begin to move from City to
[55:49] City from City to City you know and they
[55:52] tried to uh they tried to do whatever
[55:54] they could
[55:56] and and you know a lot of things went on
[55:58] and I I just get on down to it here
[56:00] there was a man he thought would be his
[56:03] friend and pretended to be his friend
[56:04] and it gained his confidence and
[56:06] eventually he turned him over to the
[56:09] authorities and he was put into prison
[56:11] and for over a year and many months
[56:13] behind bars his trials began to begin
[56:16] and William was accused of heresy that
[56:19] is believing among other things in the
[56:22] forgiveness of sin and that the mercy
[56:25] offered in the gospel was enough for
[56:28] salvation
[56:30] ah
[56:32] he believed that freedom had already
[56:34] been paid for
[56:37] but the church was trying to still get
[56:39] you to pay for Freedom this was their
[56:42] money line and they knew when people
[56:43] began to realize I don't have to pay for
[56:46] it it's already been paid for
[56:49] and so these were the heresies he was
[56:51] guilty of and he was sentenced to death
[56:53] by strangulation and burned at the stake
[56:57] his last wish and prayer was Lord open
[57:01] the king of England's eyes
[57:05] a cry for Freedom amen as he was life
[57:09] was ending his out of his butt going out
[57:11] of his body
[57:14] freedom
[57:15] is not free
[57:21] this this holiday we just went through
[57:23] and fireworks went off and all kinds of
[57:24] things happen
[57:27] but for too many years people have taken
[57:30] their freedoms for granted
[57:32] thought they'd always be here and they'd
[57:34] always be that way and you know this is
[57:36] America no well America's turning
[57:41] and it's very quickly going to be going
[57:43] to become a place that don't have
[57:45] freedoms no longer
[57:47] it's going to turn to the dragon as you
[57:49] know as it was there and what they tried
[57:52] to leave is actually going to come again
[57:54] and be exactly what they left
[57:58] and it's going to begin and that's where
[57:59] when the tribulation hits and all that
[58:01] kind of stuff and all that how that
[58:03] works the Beast is going to come and and
[58:05] take lives amen they're going to realize
[58:07] hey you know I wish we still had those
[58:10] freedoms but of course you know men can
[58:12] be thinking say and a freedom is a you
[58:14] know and and they turn it into the
[58:16] license to do whatever they want and so
[58:18] that's where we're at in this nation now
[58:20] is it's not just the land of the free
[58:22] it's the land of the free to do whatever
[58:24] you want to do
[58:25] think however you want to think be how
[58:28] whatever you want to be if you want to
[58:30] be a dog bed if you want to be a cat bed
[58:32] if you want to be this you you just be
[58:34] what you want to be but that's not what
[58:35] this nation was built upon
[58:38] amen listen the nation how it was built
[58:41] amen it was only meant to be run by
[58:43] Christians it was only meant to be run
[58:46] by men who knew what true Freedom was
[58:50] it wasn't the license to sin and the
[58:53] license to do whatever you want to it
[58:55] was a license to live the freedom to
[58:58] live the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[59:02] but of course they turned it into what
[59:03] it is today
[59:06] and this nation is going to pots I mean
[59:08] it's gone there's no hope for it you can
[59:11] do whatever you want to you can pray for
[59:13] it and do whatever but it's it's
[59:14] prophesied Amen it's going to to burn
[59:19] so we know where it's headed
[59:24] but the greatest Price
[59:27] that was ever paid for freedom
[59:30] and there was only one that could pay it
[59:34] came in he came and done it at Calvary
[59:37] that's where the greatest price was paid
[59:41] that's one of the things God had
[59:43] required it no man was worthy no man was
[59:46] able no man could do it and God came
[59:48] himself was made human and lived a human
[59:51] life under human desires and was
[59:54] crucified at Calvary and that's where we
[59:56] are Satan thought he wouldn't do it he
[59:59] thought he wouldn't go through it and he
[1:00:01] went through it anyhow he stood every
[1:00:04] Temptation and he went through it just
[1:00:06] like all men why so he could pay the
[1:00:10] price
[1:00:12] and it was a price that only one man
[1:00:15] could ever pay
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:19] the Brandon was saying like this he said
[1:00:21] it was a terrible day
[1:00:23] he said that day the sun looked funny
[1:00:26] there was never a day like it would
[1:00:27] never will be again it was a horrible
[1:00:29] thing the debt from Eden has to be paid
[1:00:33] it was a horrible day and we began to
[1:00:35] notice early in the morning he said I
[1:00:37] hear a noise coming down the street and
[1:00:40] I hear something going bump bump bump
[1:00:44] what is it it's an Old Rugged Cross
[1:00:47] and he said I see a little woman run out
[1:00:50] in front of him said what has he done
[1:00:52] what has he done but preached the gospel
[1:00:55] what has he done but heal the sick and I
[1:00:58] see a rough hand smack her in the mouth
[1:01:00] and say sit down would you believe that
[1:01:02] woman who's a prostitute before you'd
[1:01:04] believe you believe your priest she
[1:01:06] couldn't speak her peace his time had
[1:01:08] come for something else that cross was
[1:01:11] dragging for a purpose
[1:01:14] he had a robe over his shoulders and he
[1:01:16] started up the hill and I noticed little
[1:01:18] bitty red spots all over his coat wonder
[1:01:21] what they are his little weak body a
[1:01:24] crown of thorns on his head spit hanging
[1:01:27] down his face what had he done to
[1:01:29] deserve it nothing
[1:01:31] but he was paying my penalty
[1:01:36] he was paying your penalty and those
[1:01:39] spots they watch him with it he drags on
[1:01:42] and his little body begins to get more
[1:01:44] fail more frail on it and they're
[1:01:46] whipping him and they're making him go
[1:01:48] on and he's pulling that old crossbow
[1:01:50] bump bump and those little spots get
[1:01:53] bigger and bigger and bigger and I hear
[1:01:56] splashing down his leg and he's getting
[1:01:58] weaker and he's getting weaker and what
[1:02:01] was it he was willing to pay the price
[1:02:07] and listen he was willing to pay such a
[1:02:10] great price for our freedom of the
[1:02:13] spirit for our freedom of worship for
[1:02:15] our freedom in the house of God to
[1:02:17] Deliver Us From The Law of sin and death
[1:02:21] and he paid such a great price I will
[1:02:23] not be like what our country has become
[1:02:25] and stay inside and Let Freedom at the
[1:02:28] freedom be taken but I know this gospel
[1:02:31] came with a cost
[1:02:34] and if it gave men have died and they
[1:02:37] give their life how much more should we
[1:02:39] stand for the freedom of God in our
[1:02:41] lives
[1:02:42] and say devil you're not taking one of
[1:02:45] our freedoms
[1:02:47] they might rewrite Constitution they may
[1:02:50] rewrite amendments they may take all the
[1:02:53] holidays off and never celebrate the 4th
[1:02:55] of July ever again it matters not to me
[1:02:58] I have a freedom that this world didn't
[1:03:01] give and the world can't take away
[1:03:06] it is a freedom in the land of the Holy
[1:03:09] Ghost
[1:03:12] and it's been paid for
[1:03:21] he said that's what blocked the Earth
[1:03:23] out
[1:03:25] it's like he said it was like operation
[1:03:27] was taking place
[1:03:29] he was
[1:03:30] it was my operation
[1:03:33] here's cutting sin off of me
[1:03:36] he was Breaking Chains off of me
[1:03:39] so when a doctor gives a man anesthetic
[1:03:42] and first knocks him out before he can
[1:03:44] do it and when God gave an operation for
[1:03:46] the church the world got an anesthetic
[1:03:48] nature had a convulsion no wonder God in
[1:03:52] human flesh was dying it was the hour
[1:03:55] the world had looked for yet many of
[1:03:57] them never saw it ain't that a paradox
[1:04:00] like it is today many have looked for
[1:04:02] these things that they don't recognize
[1:04:03] them they don't realize the way out
[1:04:05] they're still trying to seek pleasures
[1:04:07] and things of the world trying to find
[1:04:08] their way out there there was it's been
[1:04:11] and has been many signposts that pointed
[1:04:13] to that day many great foreshadowings
[1:04:16] many have been foreshadowed by the Lamb
[1:04:18] by the Bulldog by the turtle dove all
[1:04:20] these things and yet it could they could
[1:04:22] not see it and that all those other
[1:04:24] foreshadows could not pay the price they
[1:04:28] could not break the Yoke off of the
[1:04:30] earth they could not break the Yoke off
[1:04:32] of men's lives
[1:04:35] you couldn't break death's hold

[1:04:41] down the Earth burning like Brian Brian
[1:04:43] Stones Lucifer was a son of the morning
[1:04:45] and he walked on the Earth when the
[1:04:47] burning volcanic those same rocks that
[1:04:50] it cooled off when Jesus died at Calvary
[1:04:53] bench belts forth again out of the earth
[1:04:55] he said the price that was paid the
[1:04:58] bondage of Satan was broke
[1:05:04] God put back in the hands of man away
[1:05:06] back to what he was looking for he had
[1:05:10] to weep no more

[1:05:14] there at Calvary the backbone of sin the
[1:05:17] backbone of sickness it brings every
[1:05:20] Mortal being on Earth back into the
[1:05:22] presence of God with all sins forgiven

[1:13:23] five months maybe less I drive over to
[1:13:25] Dallas pull off on the side road go in
[1:13:27] this little spot it don't even look like
[1:13:29] an antique place I walk around the
[1:13:31] corner in Andrews and Luke's with me and
[1:13:32] sister Ruth and Andrew there's one of
[1:13:34] them kids went through that Ruby's Cube
[1:13:36] craze and he's just he go whoa dad
[1:13:39] there's an ark
[1:13:41] I knew Andrew and I thought he's pulling
[1:13:43] my leg
[1:13:44] I look down there and sure enough it was
[1:13:46] you know and it's a beautiful Arc and it
[1:13:48] but it didn't look like much it looked
[1:13:50] like it was broke just a broken hunk of
[1:13:52] metal but I knew it was worth something
[1:13:56] I knew that it was rare I knew that it
[1:14:00] was something of great greater value
[1:14:01] than what was on it
[1:14:03] and he was even had a tag on it says a
[1:14:07] great Lantern to paint or decorate how
[1:14:10] fun 24.95
[1:14:13] last night's that thing up because I
[1:14:15] knew even as it said it was worth
[1:14:17] probably 20 40 50 times more than even
[1:14:20] that
[1:14:21] and so I'm just shook up because I don't
[1:14:23] found an ark and I'm walking around and
[1:14:25] I called brother Mike I said hey you
[1:14:27] ain't gonna believe this I found an R he
[1:14:28] said you're lying I put on a table I
[1:14:31] took some pictures I sent her a picture
[1:14:33] I said now my line or what he said hey
[1:14:35] let me ask you this question he said you
[1:14:37] still in that store and I said yeah I'm
[1:14:39] still I'm just kind of I'm just my
[1:14:41] mind's blowed he said go up there throw
[1:14:43] them 30 dollars on the front and walk
[1:14:44] out the door and put that thing in your
[1:14:46] car before somebody realizes what you
[1:14:47] got
[1:14:50] that's what I did because I knew that
[1:14:53] even the tag that was on it it was a
[1:14:55] certain price somebody had put on it but
[1:14:57] I knew it was worth more than that so I
[1:15:00] was willing to even pay more than what
[1:15:01] it was what they had on it because I
[1:15:04] knew that inside of it and what it was
[1:15:06] it could be worth more than that did I
[1:15:08] have to do something sure I had to go
[1:15:10] home and I sent it to another person
[1:15:11] they made it into something now it's
[1:15:14] worth about three grand maybe or
[1:15:15] somewhere around there amen somebody who
[1:15:17] thought it was nothing but a hunk of
[1:15:19] junk that needed to be painted and
[1:15:20] decorated and put out in the yard
[1:15:22] somewhere but somebody with an eye come
[1:15:24] along and said hey that's worth more
[1:15:26] than that
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:30] I remember the day when I was sitting in
[1:15:33] a shop
[1:15:35] and the devil had put all kind of tags
[1:15:37] on me and said do this and he's this and
[1:15:40] he's there and that's all he's ever
[1:15:42] going to be but somebody
[1:15:45] came walking through there and said hey
[1:15:48] that boy is worth more than that
[1:15:52] and I'm willing to pay the price
[1:15:56] I'm willing to give my all cause it's
[1:15:59] worthwhile I don't care what the sign
[1:16:01] says I don't care what it says to do
[1:16:04] with it that's not what I'm gonna do I'm
[1:16:06] gonna remake it I want to remold it and
[1:16:09] it will give light again
[1:16:13] Hallelujah
[1:16:15] some of you ain't been nothing but
[1:16:17] beaten down humanity and the devil's put
[1:16:20] all kind of signs on you and said oh
[1:16:22] just go ahead and have fun paint it up
[1:16:24] and decorate it do what you want to with
[1:16:26] it but that's not who you were
[1:16:30] you was destined to give light
[1:16:33] you is destined to light up the world
[1:16:35] and God saw something on the inside of
[1:16:38] you and he walked and he ripped that old
[1:16:40] tag off
[1:16:43] oh Jesus
[1:16:46] and he made you into something that can
[1:16:48] Shine for his glory
[1:16:51] you don't have to be lost

[1:17:17] man that was shut up in this earth
[1:17:20] fearing that when he died what death
[1:17:21] would have be to him on Calvary he
[1:17:24] opened those cell doors he let every

[1:18:20] man who Longs for a city whose Builder
[1:18:22] maker is God he can step on the highway

[1:18:59] God thought you was worth paying the
[1:19:01] price for and so he was willing to give
[1:19:03] the ultimate price
[1:19:06] no greater love has a man than one

[1:22:48] that's right why would you all have a
[1:22:51] freedom that's been given to the house
[1:22:52] of God
[1:22:53] why would you want it why wouldn't you
[1:22:55] stand for it why wouldn't you stand
[1:22:57] there and hold the sword and say devil
[1:23:00] come take it
[1:23:03] if you wanted you're gonna have to come
[1:23:05] take it because I'm going to fight for
[1:23:07] it
[1:23:09] I'm going to fight for the Holy Ghost in
[1:23:12] our hearts I'm going to fight for the
[1:23:14] Holy Ghost atmosphere that Sons and
[1:23:16] Daughters can be born of the spirit of
[1:23:18] God I'm going to stand there but I've
[1:23:21] done all to stand I want to stand fast
[1:23:23] in the Liberty whereas I have been
[1:23:26] called
[1:23:29] you can go back to the bondage if you
[1:23:31] want to go back I'm not going back to
[1:23:34] bondage
[1:23:36] you can go back to lukewarmness if you
[1:23:38] want to go back I'm not going back to
[1:23:40] lukewarmness you can go back to your own
[1:23:43] comfort zone if that's where you want to
[1:23:44] be but as for me in my house
[1:23:48] we're going to serve God we're going to
[1:23:50] fight for our liberties
[1:23:56] the devil wants to come in the house of
[1:23:57] God and take the liberty of the ministry
[1:24:00] to preach the gospel how dare you devil
[1:24:04] you as the children of God on a fight
[1:24:07] for the Liberty to have a man better
[1:24:09] stand and proclaim the message of
[1:24:12] almighty God whether it burns a hide off
[1:24:15] of us
[1:24:21] but there is a cost of freedom
[1:24:27] that day on Calvary
[1:24:29] there wasn't a lamb on this Earth
[1:24:31] that could pay the price
[1:24:33] no woolly lamb
[1:24:35] but there was the Lamb of God
[1:24:38] he was hacked
[1:24:40] he was chopped
[1:24:42] he was beat
[1:24:44] he was spit on
[1:24:46] slammed
[1:24:48] smacked by the world
[1:24:51] and the blood dropping off his locks
[1:24:54] it was a cost
[1:24:58] and he paid it for you
[1:25:01] he paid it so you can enjoy the
[1:25:03] liberties
[1:25:06] that we could find in Christ Jesus
[1:25:09] the Liberties to let God do as God wants
[1:25:12] to do
[1:25:20] he said in John 8 and verse 36 he said
[1:25:23] the son therefore shall make you free
[1:25:25] ye shall be free indeed
[1:25:28] he'd say this in the church he says now
[1:25:30] don't get tired again
[1:25:32] by traditions and Creeds and
[1:25:34] organizations
[1:25:36] don't get tired again
[1:25:38] don't be led astray by letting be not
[1:25:42] entangled again remember what we just
[1:25:44] read be not until don't be led astray by
[1:25:46] listening to those that deny the power
[1:25:49] of the word
[1:25:51] hello
[1:25:54] don't be led astray by listen to those
[1:25:56] that deny the power of the word and deny
[1:25:59] that Jesus saves and deny that he heals
[1:26:03] and deny that he feels with the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost in power you are God's men loosed
[1:26:09] by his own blood
[1:26:14] it would say it there in that same place
[1:26:16] in Revelations 1 5 unto him that loved
[1:26:18] us and washed us from our sins this wash
[1:26:21] means actually means loosed loosed us
[1:26:24] from our own sins and his own blood
[1:26:25] isn't that wonderful but are you
[1:26:27] spiritually minded did you catch it it
[1:26:29] was his own blood that loosens
[1:26:31] completely from our sins it was not
[1:26:34] human blood it was the blood of God
[1:26:36] Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul
[1:26:39] called it the blood of the Lord the
[1:26:40] blood of Jesus not free person but one
[1:26:43] person there is that Revelation again
[1:26:46] one God that omnipotent Jehovah God came
[1:26:49] down and made himself a body by means of
[1:26:52] the Virgin birth and indwelted that it
[1:26:54] might be the blood of God that would
[1:26:56] free us
[1:26:58] loose us entirely from our sin and
[1:27:01] present us spotless before himself would
[1:27:04] exceeding great joy
[1:27:07] what happened you had sins I had sin we
[1:27:11] were all born since
[1:27:13] but somebody settled to death
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:18] Hallelujah one lamb could always in the
[1:27:22] Bible the Old Testament can only come
[1:27:23] and sacrifice and maybe for a year
[1:27:26] settled the dead or of one sin settle
[1:27:28] the death but this one lamb came and
[1:27:31] settled every debt
[1:27:35] talk about person in this church I'm
[1:27:38] talking about everyone whosoever will
[1:27:40] let him come he has settled every death
[1:27:46] canceled
[1:27:51] the devil wants to come by as your
[1:27:53] accuser and he pulls out his old book of
[1:27:55] remembrance
[1:27:57] wait a minute
[1:27:59] I had a road here but it says cancel
[1:28:03] let me let me go out and I got something
[1:28:05] on him over here
[1:28:07] back in this well
[1:28:09] cancer
[1:28:15] I was sure I knew he told this line he'd
[1:28:19] done this bad deal and he'd done this
[1:28:21] over I had it wrote down let me flip it
[1:28:22] right cancel
[1:28:25] what
[1:28:29] matter of fact
[1:28:31] it's written there in red
[1:28:34] let me read let me put my glasses on
[1:28:35] again
[1:28:37] Justified yes
[1:28:39] as though we never did it in the first
[1:28:41] place
[1:28:50] it's all gone
[1:28:53] there is now no condemnation
[1:28:56] [Applause]
[1:28:58] Hallelujah if you've got condemnation
[1:29:00] tonight and you put everything under the
[1:29:02] blood it's not coming from God
[1:29:05] it's coming from that Old Wicked enemy
[1:29:07] called the devil and he's trying to hold
[1:29:09] us something over you that you never did
[1:29:12] in the first place because God came and
[1:29:15] he canceled the dead and he paid the
[1:29:17] prize
[1:29:19] that you could go free
[1:29:26] became himself to redeem that lost son
[1:29:28] he did not send another
[1:29:32] he didn't send an angel
[1:29:35] he didn't send another one like unto us
[1:29:37] no he came himself
[1:29:39] God did not entrust this Plan of
[1:29:41] Salvation to anyone else
[1:29:44] his trust he trusted only himself God
[1:29:47] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and
[1:29:49] redeemed us into him by himself we are
[1:29:51] saved by the blood of God
[1:29:57] Eternal God indwelt a mortal body in
[1:30:00] order to take away sin he became the
[1:30:01] lamb in order to shed his blood to enter
[1:30:03] into the veil with it consider this
[1:30:05] since it was the blood of God it is a
[1:30:08] perfect blood and if it has a perfect
[1:30:10] blood it has a perfect loosing
[1:30:14] it loosens us from the power and the
[1:30:17] bondage and the defilement of sin then
[1:30:19] the loosen is perfect and complete there
[1:30:22] is now therefore no condemnation who
[1:30:25] shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:30:28] God's elect it is God that justifies it
[1:30:31] or declares us righteous
[1:30:34] [Applause]
[1:30:36] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[1:30:39] that died the blood has loosed us
[1:30:43] there is now no condemnation
[1:30:46] there is now nothing to be condemned for
[1:30:51] amen
[1:30:52] what's in
[1:30:55] Watson
[1:30:57] is removed as far as the east from the
[1:30:59] West because the blood has loosed us
[1:31:01] from the sin we are free Guiltless
[1:31:05] don't listen to man listen to the word
[1:31:11] that's why God
[1:31:13] paid the price for you to have the word
[1:31:22] some years ago brother random says it
[1:31:24] like this we bring this down
[1:31:27] I was walking around looking at
[1:31:29] different pictures and things in this
[1:31:30] old Museum
[1:31:33] I admire art and I think God is in art
[1:31:37] and I walked up and I noticed there was
[1:31:39] an old negro man he was a real old
[1:31:41] stooped in his shoulders
[1:31:44] little rim of hair and at the back of
[1:31:47] his head
[1:31:48] he had a hat on
[1:31:50] he's walking around something in that
[1:31:52] manner looking around
[1:31:54] as if he was watching or looking for
[1:31:56] something something specific
[1:31:58] I stood back and I watched him a little
[1:32:00] bit
[1:32:01] after a while he came to a certain
[1:32:03] little box
[1:32:06] and he looked into it and he startled
[1:32:08] his eyes brightened up and he jumped
[1:32:09] back
[1:32:11] took off his little plug hat and held it
[1:32:13] in his hand
[1:32:14] and I watched him as that he bowed his
[1:32:16] head and tears began to drop off his
[1:32:19] cheeks
[1:32:20] and I stood there and watched an
[1:32:21] amazement
[1:32:22] I thought I had to find out what he's so
[1:32:24] excited about
[1:32:26] and I walked around this side and I
[1:32:28] looked it looked at me like just a dress
[1:32:30] laying there and I said Uncle
[1:32:32] how you doing he said how do you do sir
[1:32:35] I said I'm a minister I'm surprised to
[1:32:38] see you offering prayer at this place I
[1:32:40] believe you must be a Christian he said
[1:32:41] yes sir I am
[1:32:43] so why are you so excited what has
[1:32:45] excited you so much he said come here
[1:32:47] sir
[1:32:48] and I walked over with the old fella
[1:32:50] there and he said you see that dress he
[1:32:52] said yes sir you see that spot on there
[1:32:55] yes sir put your hand on my side I said
[1:32:58] well what's that rough place he said a
[1:33:00] slave belt went around there one day
[1:33:03] he said that blood on that dress is
[1:33:05] Abraham Lincoln's blood
[1:33:07] that blood took the slave belt off of me
[1:33:10] wouldn't that excite you too
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:15] I stood there in amazement I thought if
[1:33:19] the blood could excite a slave for
[1:33:21] taking a slave belt off for him what all
[1:33:23] the blood of Jesus Christ do a people
[1:33:26] like Rosella sitting here that was a
[1:33:29] slave to alcohol or me dying a miserable
[1:33:31] rest but he took the slave belt off of
[1:33:34] me
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:46] he said I can't hardly look at a tree
[1:33:48] without remembering my Lord I was on a
[1:33:52] tree and he gave his life for me he said
[1:33:55] that's not to make anybody Shout
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:59] Hallelujah and you wonder why we're
[1:34:02] shouting you wonder why we get excited
[1:34:04] you know I get Amazed by people they can
[1:34:06] get excited by a song and they can have
[1:34:08] a concert and they can say well the
[1:34:10] spirit of God moved here and maybe he
[1:34:11] did and I'll say he did wonderful but
[1:34:14] somehow we get to preaching of the word
[1:34:15] and we go to shouting and something's
[1:34:17] wrong about that
[1:34:19] I thought it was the word that was
[1:34:21] supposed to make a shout
[1:34:24] not some guilt that's up there singing
[1:34:26] and carrying on AIM I mean it's all fine
[1:34:28] and Danny in this place but what ought
[1:34:30] to really make you shout is the word of
[1:34:33] God because in the word of God there is
[1:34:35] liberty and the word has come he said
[1:34:38] his word and he healed them
[1:34:45] wow that's what is happening that is
[1:34:47] what is going on around us God has sent
[1:34:51] his word and he's delivering that way
[1:34:53] and he's delivering that one and he's
[1:34:55] sitting that one free and the slave
[1:34:57] Builders broke off
[1:35:00] Builders broke off
[1:35:03] and the rejoices I once was lost but now
[1:35:07] I'm found I want to fly but now I see
[1:35:10] Amazing Grace how sweet this sound let's
[1:35:13] save the rich like me
[1:35:17] Hallelujah he paid the price that I can
[1:35:21] go free
[1:35:23] when I think about the Lord Harry save
[1:35:27] me how he healed me how he delivered me
[1:35:32] when I think about the Lord how he
[1:35:34] brought Justin wear back how he healed
[1:35:36] sister Atlanta how he touched different
[1:35:38] hearts in this assembly it makes me want
[1:35:42] to shout
[1:35:45] when I think about the Lord and I feel
[1:35:47] the marks of that old slave belt
[1:35:51] put the Slate belt ain't there no more
[1:35:53] it's just marks of it amen Scholars that
[1:35:57] I hold but it's a reminder there used to
[1:36:00] be a slave out there
[1:36:03] you say well brother Timothy I got a lot
[1:36:05] of scars in my life let that be as a
[1:36:07] reminder there used to be a slave bill
[1:36:09] then but that sleigh bells ain't there
[1:36:12] no more
[1:36:14] he broke it off of you and you're free
[1:36:22] we have a little spot of Abraham's
[1:36:25] leaking blood can make a little man
[1:36:27] shout want all the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:36:29] through the Church of the Living God
[1:36:32] whose sin has been broke on chains have
[1:36:35] been broke off
[1:36:37] pop places have been broken all anxiety
[1:36:40] has been broke off tears called
[1:36:47] who the sun is set free is free indeed
[1:36:52] you're free tonight
[1:36:54] [Applause]
[1:37:08] let's don't give up our liberties let's
[1:37:12] Stand Fast therefore in the liberty of
[1:37:15] Christ
[1:37:18] this ain't a man decreed Liberty
[1:37:22] come on now this ain't a man decreed
[1:37:24] Liberty it was an angel a mighty angel
[1:37:27] that came down with a book in his hand
[1:37:29] and he put his land upon the sea and
[1:37:31] upon the Earth
[1:37:32] and he cried with a loud voice
[1:37:37] his head was in heaven but where was his
[1:37:39] body
