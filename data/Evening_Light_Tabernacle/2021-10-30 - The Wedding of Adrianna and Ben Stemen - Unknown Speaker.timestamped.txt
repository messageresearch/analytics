[26:49] you may have your seats
[27:20] let's all pray
[27:23] our gracious heavenly father
[27:25] our hearts rejoice today lord to see

[27:32] together like this father to christians
[27:35] to be joined in holy matrimony father we
[27:38] desire lord that you would have the
[27:39] highest place in this ceremony
[27:42] lord that your blessings will be upon it
[27:44] father as we remember lord when you is
[27:46] here on earth that your first miracle
[27:48] was performed at a wedding lord
[27:51] lord you rejoice in these things at your
[27:53] institution
[27:54] we ask you to have your way and bless
[27:56] every part of it now in the name of the
[27:58] lord jesus christ amen
[28:07] today we have a wedding of royalty
[28:12] the world may not recognize it as such
[28:15] but this wedding today brings together
[28:17] two families of royalty
[28:20] we have stepped out of eternity
[28:22] into a space of time
[28:25] we were pre-planned from the foundation
[28:27] of the world
[28:29] our names were written in the lamb's
[28:31] book of life
[28:33] and today
[28:34] one of the photos of the lamb's book of
[28:36] life is standing before us
[28:40] and heaven is given witness
[28:42] angels are present
[28:44] watching
[28:46] a scene unfold known
[28:48] only by god but expressed now
[28:51] in this moment
[28:53] eternity and time have
[28:55] blended together in
[28:57] celebration of this moment
[29:01] this is more than a beautiful moment in
[29:03] time
[29:04] as it was for ordained
[29:07] before the foundation of the world
[29:10] not only do we have this great assembled
[29:12] host
[29:13] today of friends and family
[29:16] but
[29:17] host of heaven itself
[29:19] has drawn near to witness this event
[29:22] for these attributes of god
[29:25] are now on display as this wedding
[29:28] itself is a
[29:29] reflecting the glory to come when god
[29:31] will take himself a bride
[29:34] a bride without spot or wrinkle
[29:38] even as the pruitt and steven families
[29:40] unite together today
[29:44] ben
[29:44] you and adriana were acquainted long
[29:47] before
[29:48] you fell in love
[29:51] then she was just another
[29:52] girl but there was a day when the arrow
[29:55] of love struck your heart and
[29:58] you just simply not been able to think
[30:00] of nothing else
[30:02] but her
[30:05] i believe this is a union that god has
[30:07] built
[30:08] adriana it was last christmas
[30:12] i spoke to you that life was about to
[30:14] change
[30:15] i foretold to you that it would happen
[30:17] suddenly
[30:19] when god would bring a man into your
[30:21] life and this so we know this union was
[30:24] for ordained and one that god has built
[30:28] it was pre-planned
[30:30] maybe we can't remember standing in
[30:33] eternity because it was just a thought
[30:35] then in god's mind
[30:37] but now we are in time doing what god
[30:39] foresaw and preak plan long ago
[30:42] in the eternal ages
[30:45] time has its ups and downs
[30:49] with both great joys and deep sorrows
[30:51] but god in his wisdom
[30:53] knew that man should not be alone and
[30:56] has destined for this part of
[30:59] of life's journey for you two to walk
[31:01] together hand in hand here in time as
[31:05] you head toward eternity
[31:08] and then although you may never proclaim
[31:11] the word of god from a pulpit
[31:14] or you either adriana but you both were
[31:17] ordained to carry out this word
[31:20] as a wife
[31:21] true to her husband and as a husband who
[31:24] emulates christ in all things
[31:27] and god has so designed it where you
[31:29] will not do this alone but together as
[31:32] one flesh
[31:34] so today is a reflection of what god did
[31:37] in the garden of eden
[31:39] as the scripture once again becomes god
[31:41] breathed
[31:42] to be fulfilled
[31:44] in you
[31:46] in the garden god created adam in his
[31:48] own image from spirit form to flesh form
[31:53] but god did not want man to be alone
[31:56] and i believe this is the heart of god
[31:59] for he too wants a bride in his image
[32:01] that together they will reign as king
[32:03] and queen
[32:05] in the eternal ages to come
[32:08] looking upon adam god's side man is
[32:11] alone
[32:12] and it's not good
[32:14] so he performed an operation and reached
[32:17] into his side and
[32:19] brought out a portion of man's own flesh
[32:22] what a wedding that was
[32:24] it was there under the canopy of the
[32:26] garden of eden
[32:28] and just
[32:29] as we saw it in your eyes
[32:32] ben as your eyes lit up
[32:34] as she walked down the aisle and all of
[32:36] a sudden
[32:38] these hundreds of guests just faded away
[32:41] as all you could see was her
[32:44] but suddenly in that moment the most
[32:46] important one
[32:48] walked into the room
[32:51] may that never leave your life then
[32:54] for your eyes must always remain single
[32:57] upon her and
[32:59] adriana your eyes must always remain
[33:01] single upon your husband
[33:04] so that you behold no other
[33:07] man but him
[33:09] you see ben
[33:11] the man is never complete until he's
[33:13] married
[33:15] and then after that he's finished
[33:23] and this union you're making is
[33:25] something that god desires to do himself
[33:28] god had placed that in adam to be lonely
[33:30] because
[33:31] he too desired a wife
[33:34] prophets foretold of this
[33:36] isaac and rebecca portrayed it
[33:39] we also read by bible accounts of the
[33:42] love of man and the woman of jacob's
[33:45] love for rachel and of mary pledged to
[33:47] joseph
[33:49] and that of the shulamite and
[33:51] her beloved
[33:52] but none of that could fully express
[33:55] god's great desire
[33:57] so that's why jesus left all the ivory
[34:00] palaces and its golden streets
[34:03] and all of heaven's glory
[34:05] to take upon himself the form of a man
[34:08] and to reflect his pleasure in weddings
[34:12] the first miracle he performed would be
[34:13] at a wedding where water was turned into
[34:16] wine
[34:17] he did this by the power of creation
[34:22] and with this power
[34:24] the same lord jesus is here today to
[34:27] take two people
[34:29] and by the same miraculous power
[34:32] turn two people
[34:33] into one
[34:35] the bible teaches us that god is love
[34:37] and love comes from god
[34:40] from the beginning to the end the bible
[34:42] is a love story
[34:44] then we read of god's love to his people
[34:47] the love that sent christ to the cross
[34:49] and of redeeming love for the sinner and
[34:52] the abiding love for the redeemed
[34:55] god is the author of your love
[34:58] and that love is not to be temporary
[35:01] do not treat it as temporary
[35:03] do not treat it
[35:06] as something
[35:08] that will just
[35:09] quickly fade away
[35:11] not one day is to be grand taken for
[35:14] granted for life is just simply too
[35:16] short
[35:18] you make christ a part of this marriage
[35:20] he wants to be the unseen guest in your
[35:22] home
[35:24] he wants to be in every conversation
[35:27] he's always near in good times
[35:30] and bad times and difficulties and
[35:33] financial troubles and choices of life
[35:36] and great decisions that will have to be
[35:38] made
[35:40] he's always there
[35:41] make sure you don't let one day go by
[35:44] where you don't spend time together and
[35:46] with the lord jesus christ
[35:49] then
[35:51] i think of you as a real man a prince
[35:55] a child of the most high god your family
[35:59] your pastor
[36:00] your church family
[36:02] they've done an incredible job of
[36:04] raising you and preparing you for this
[36:06] day
[36:08] your description of what this message is
[36:10] all about you are the message
[36:13] so may i wonder what is it
[36:16] you're it
[36:17] your description of all the incredible
[36:20] sermons and what they're all about
[36:24] your great compliment to your
[36:25] grandfather's ministry
[36:28] and all the wonderful sermons that both
[36:30] of your uncles
[36:32] and other men of god had poured into you
[36:36] adriana
[36:37] supernatural gifts came through your
[36:39] family
[36:41] you have a great heritage
[36:43] there's a handing down from one
[36:45] generation to another
[36:47] the seeds of greatness that was in your
[36:49] grandmother is in you
[36:51] besides that god has gifted you
[36:54] above
[36:55] many others to be anointed to sing
[36:58] and to bless others
[37:00] you are able with that gift to literally
[37:03] charge the atmosphere and even make
[37:05] demons run for cover
[37:08] but join together now your life will
[37:10] have more depth
[37:12] you will have greater understanding
[37:15] god has set you apart from others
[37:17] to be a shining example
[37:20] to the world of god's grace and his
[37:22] wonderful goodness
[37:25] brother branham spoke in the sermon
[37:27] the chosen of a bride and then there he
[37:30] expounded upon the truth of how a man
[37:32] will choose a woman
[37:34] that reflects his own character
[37:37] and
[37:38] then we really couldn't see the inside
[37:41] of you until now but
[37:42] wow
[37:43] i would say you're absolutely beautiful
[37:50] god
[37:52] is the author of love
[37:54] it is him that brings us together
[37:57] it is his love that will carry us
[38:00] through
[38:01] love conquers all
[38:03] it conquers every demon it conquers
[38:05] every power
[38:06] it is the greatest force on the face of
[38:09] the earth
[38:10] let nothing come between you
[38:13] if it does recognize it as the spirit of
[38:15] the enemy ah there be surely times of
[38:19] dis disagreements
[38:21] but settle every argument or
[38:23] disagreement on your knees
[38:25] and remember this powerful word
[38:28] and put it to use
[38:30] forgive
[38:32] love
[38:33] is based on forgiveness
[38:37] hold no grudges
[38:39] let it go in just love
[38:41] for love
[38:43] is of god
[38:51] ben
[38:53] will you have this woman to live
[38:54] together
[38:55] in the holy covenant of marriage
[38:59] will you love her honor her and comfort
[39:02] her and keep her in sickness and in
[39:04] health
[39:05] and forsaking all others
[39:08] be faithful to her as long as you both
[39:10] shall live
[39:14] and adriana
[39:15] but you have this man
[39:17] to live together
[39:19] in holy
[39:20] covenant of marriage where you love him
[39:23] honor him comfort and keep him in
[39:26] sickness
[39:27] and in health and forsaking all others
[39:30] be faithful to him as long as you both
[39:33] shall live
[39:36] marriage was instituted by god
[39:39] it's not simply an idea of man
[39:42] marriage is a gift of god
[39:45] it's given to comfort the sorrows of
[39:47] life and
[39:48] to celebrate its choice
[39:51] marriage is the classmen of hands the
[39:53] blending of hearts
[39:55] the uniting of two lives is one
[39:58] your marriage must stand
[40:00] not by the authority of the state
[40:03] not by the seal of your wedding
[40:05] certificate
[40:06] but rather it must stand by the strength
[40:08] of your love it must stand this
[40:11] in the devotion of your love to one
[40:13] another in the good times and the bad
[40:16] finally it must stand
[40:18] because of the participation of god
[40:21] in your
[40:22] relationship
[40:24] marriage is to be
[40:26] the greatest
[40:28] relationship
[40:29] you will ever experience
[40:32] however to keep that marriage
[40:35] with it will reach its full of potential
[40:38] you must allow god to play a primary
[40:41] role in your relationship
[40:43] he knows your thoughts
[40:45] he knows your needs
[40:47] he understands your heart
[40:49] and your love for each other
[40:51] in fact it was god that created the love
[40:54] and excitement you're experiencing at
[40:56] this moment
[40:59] the ideal marriage is like
[41:01] an eternal triangle with each of you at
[41:04] the bottom of the triangle
[41:07] and got at the top
[41:08] in that triangle
[41:10] and the closer you get to god
[41:13] the closer
[41:14] you become one to another
[41:17] certainly you want your new life to be
[41:19] perfect
[41:20] you have visions of eternity of joy
[41:24] but let me caution you it won't always
[41:25] be that way all the time
[41:28] unfortunately sorrow and heartache
[41:30] find their way into every life
[41:33] however if that eternal triangle remains
[41:35] unbroken
[41:37] no problem will be too great
[41:39] ben
[41:41] love adriana as your wife
[41:44] with all your being
[41:46] as christ loved the church
[41:49] and your wants and needs will always be
[41:51] met
[41:53] likewise adriana
[41:55] if you respect
[41:56] love and honor ben
[41:58] as your husband
[42:02] he will love and care for you all the
[42:05] days of your life
[42:07] finally let me say to the both of you
[42:10] remember the eternal triangle
[42:13] keep your spiritual eyes and ears open
[42:16] to god who is the source of love
[42:19] and fulfillment will be yours
[42:22] i promise you
[42:24] he will lead you into capacities
[42:26] that you never dreamed you possess

[47:47] promise
[47:50] the word of god tells us what love is
[47:52] and what love does
[47:54] says i if i speak
[47:56] in the tongues of men or of angels but
[47:58] do not have love
[48:00] i'm only a resounding gong or clinging
[48:04] symbol
[48:06] if i have the gift of prophecy and can
[48:08] fathom all mysteries and knowledge
[48:11] and if i have faith that can move
[48:13] mountains but do not have love
[48:15] i am nothing
[48:17] i give if i give all i possess to the
[48:20] poor and give over my body for to
[48:22] hardship that i may boast but do not
[48:25] have love i'm nothing
[48:27] love is patience love is kind it does
[48:30] not envy does not boast it is not proud
[48:34] it does not dishonor others it is not
[48:36] self-seeking it is not easily angered it
[48:39] keeps no records of wrongs
[48:42] love does not delight in evil but
[48:43] rejoices with truth
[48:45] it always protects always trust always
[48:48] hopes always persevere
[48:51] love
[48:52] never fails
[48:54] and now these three remain faith hope
[48:57] and love but the greatest of these
[49:00] is love we will now have the exchange of
[49:03] rings
[49:30] having this kind of love in your hearts
[49:32] you've chosen to exchange rings is the
[49:35] sign and seal of your vows that you're
[49:37] making today

[49:40] they're very large in significance

[49:56] that love must never come to an end
[49:59] we must keep it continuous
[50:01] and as you wear these rings whether
