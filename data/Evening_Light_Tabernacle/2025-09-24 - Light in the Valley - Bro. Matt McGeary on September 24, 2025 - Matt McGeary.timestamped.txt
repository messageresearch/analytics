[14:43] prayer, Amen. Let's just take a moment
[14:45] to tell him you deserve the glory
[14:51] and the honor.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[15:02] as we lift your holy name.

[16:24] &gt;&gt; like you.
[16:29] Oh, there
[16:32] [Music]
[16:39] we might have a need this evening. Just
[16:41] ask the Lord to come and minister to
[16:44] your heart and to your need. We have
[16:46] brother Matt McGiri with us this
[16:48] evening. Him and his family are here
[16:49] with us. And uh Matt is no stranger to
[16:52] us. I believe he's a God- called man
[16:55] anointed for this hour to preach this
[16:57] message. and you got a need. I believe
[16:59] that you can pull from the minister
[17:01] exactly what you have need of, pull them
[17:03] to your need. I just believe he studied
[17:06] and prepared and we just do our part and
[17:09] present our need to Christ and he will
[17:10] in turn use the man of God to direct
[17:13] that. So, let's just go to him in prayer
[17:14] this evening. Father, Lord, we're so
[17:17] thankful we can come in your house in
[17:18] your presence, Lord. Lord, knowing that
[17:21] not only were two or three be gathered,
[17:23] Lord, that's just not a cliche for
[17:25] believers, but Lord, we're gathered not
[17:27] only in this house, but we're gathered
[17:28] in your presence. We're gathered in your
[17:30] name, Lord. And your name is a name
[17:33] that's lifted high and above every other
[17:35] name. Lord, you would tell us even at
[17:37] the mention of that name, every knee
[17:39] shall bow, Lord. Every tongue will
[17:41] confess that thou art the Christ, the
[17:44] son of the living God. And Lord, we just
[17:47] exalt you tonight, Lord. You're the
[17:49] master of the winds, Lord. You're the
[17:52] Lord. You're the one who formed and
[17:53] fashioned our bodies, Father, before the
[17:55] foundation of the world, Lord. You place
[17:57] within us a desire to serve you. And
[17:59] tonight, Father, we just come to give
[18:01] back, Lord. Just what little bit of
[18:03] little bit of worship and praise
[18:05] tonight, God, not only in our singing,
[18:07] but Lord, as we respond to the word, we
[18:10] invite you, God, to come and open the
[18:12] windows of heaven, Lord, and pour out
[18:14] your blessings to us, Lord. You see the
[18:16] hands that were lifted, needs
[18:17] representative. God, I ask that you
[18:19] would come and just minister to those
[18:21] needs tonight. Lord, would you see the
[18:23] visitors in our midst, Lord, may you
[18:26] speak to them, Lord. May they see a
[18:27] living God, Lord. Not some God of man,
[18:31] not some God of some psychology, but may
[18:34] they see the living God displayed before
[18:36] them today, Lord. And they can say like
[18:39] the woman at the well, "Come see a man
[18:40] who's told me all that I've done." So,
[18:43] Father, we just come before you tonight.
[18:44] I pray you'll use a man of God. May
[18:46] you'll just anoint his lips, Lord, to
[18:49] speak the words of life. Father, anoint
[18:51] our hearts that we may receive and our
[18:53] ears to hear and to rightly divide the
[18:56] word. Lord, we pray. We just thank you
[18:58] for it. Now, bless bless this service,
[19:01] Lord. May you just have your way
[19:03] tonight. Father, be with our pastor and
[19:06] Lord, brother Timothy and brother Aaron
[19:08] as they're gone traveling this week to
[19:10] minister there in Canada. But may you
[19:12] use him in a special way. Father,
[19:15] we just commit it to you now in Jesus
[19:17] name. Amen.
[19:20] [Music]
[19:27] Amen. The brothers can take up the
[19:28] offering this evening.
[19:31] I stand in all within the presence of
[19:36] the Lord.
[19:39] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[19:43] lies.
[19:46] In whom the raging of the sea
[19:50] subsides,
[19:53] the living sacrifice,
[19:57] my only source
[19:59] of life, my hope
[20:04] is in the Lord.
[20:08] Oh, from this time on
[20:11] and ever more.
[20:15] Oh, my hope
[20:19] is in the Lord
[20:22] forever.

[20:37] and ever more.
[20:40] Oh, my hope
[20:44] is in the Lord
[20:48] forever more.
[20:53] His tender mercies come with every
[20:57] rising sun.
[21:00] to lead the sinner in his brokenness
[21:07] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[21:14] And those ones who trust
[21:18] they will find their hearts at rest.
[21:23] My hope
[21:25] is in the Lord.
[21:29] Oh, from this time on,
[21:36] oh my hope
[21:40] is in the Lord.
[21:43] Oh, forever more.
[21:46] Yes,
[21:48] my home
[21:51] is in the Lord
[21:54] from this time on
[21:58] and more.
[22:01] And oh, my hope
[22:05] is in.
[22:08] Yes. Forever more.
[22:12] And I'm going to see a victory.
[22:16] I'm going to see a victory
[22:20] for the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[22:26] Oh, I'm going to see a victory.
[22:30] I'm going to see a victory
[22:34] for the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[22:42] And there's power in the mighty name of
[22:46] Jesus.
[22:49] And every war he wages, he will win.
[22:56] Oh, I'm not backing down from any giants
[23:02] because I know how this story ends.

[23:49] to you, Lord.
[23:51] Amen. You can be seated for a moment.
[24:06] [Music]

[24:31] me right back to your amazing grace.
[24:36] Even in trles, I knew that I would be

[25:44] and again and again.

[30:48] When I'm feeling helpless,
[30:51] wondering in the darkness, surrounded by
[30:55] fear and defeat,

[32:47] on every side,
[32:50] praise is our weapon and we'll win this
[32:54] fight.
[32:56] We made our choice
[32:59] our voice. Let the church rise up and
[33:04] say,
[33:06] "Oh, we will sing.

[36:40] almighty
[36:43] God.
[36:46] There is none
[36:48] like you.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:52] Can you testify to that
[36:54] &gt;&gt; this evening? There's none like him.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; There's none greater.
[36:59] There's none higher.
[37:02] There's no one that can help you like
[37:04] the Lord Jesus.
[37:06] [Music]
[37:09] &gt;&gt; And you know, if you've lived on this
[37:11] side long enough, you're going to get
[37:13] into a place where you need more than a
[37:16] man.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; You need more than mommy or daddy. You
[37:20] need more than somebody that can do
[37:23] something in a natural way. You need
[37:25] something supernatural.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; You need the King of Kings. You need the
[37:29] Lord of Lords.
[37:31] You you need a God that can do the
[37:33] impossible to come on the scene. And
[37:36] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that he's the same
[37:38] yesterday, today, and forever.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Maybe as we would go to the Lord in
[37:42] prayer, as maybe somebody wants to lift
[37:46] a hand up and say, "Lord, I I need you
[37:47] to speak to me tonight." And
[37:50] for my my situation, my family, my life,
[37:53] and amen, God bless you, Lord Jesus.
[37:56] We've
[37:58] just humbly approach you tonight, Lord,
[38:02] depending
[38:04] once again upon your grace and your
[38:06] mercy,
[38:08] but your Holy Spirit would just come and
[38:12] pick up
[38:14] a man that would be unworthy to stand
[38:17] here, Lord.
[38:19] But it's only because of your grace
[38:22] and your mercy that would reach down
[38:24] into the muck and mire and you would
[38:26] lift me up out of the chaos, out of the
[38:29] darkness, confusion in the light of this
[38:32] glorious gospel would shine into my soul
[38:35] and quickening me to life to start to
[38:39] manifest that gene attribute that you
[38:41] placed here in this time. And
[38:43] how I love you, Lord.
[38:46] I thank you, Lord, that you would look
[38:48] upon me in my time of need.
[38:51] And you would provide and do it
[38:52] exceedingly and abundantly above all
[38:54] that I could ever think or ask, Lord. So
[38:57] now, Lord, as I stand before the
[38:59] redeemed,
[39:01] the purchased elect of
[39:03] Lord, I ask that you'd come in a
[39:05] supernatural way and just
[39:08] take your word and break it, Lord, and
[39:11] distribute it to the hungry hearts.
[39:14] Lord, maybe there's somebody here that
[39:16] don't know you.
[39:18] Maybe they know of you or
[39:22] they know so much, but Lord, I pray
[39:24] you'd come in a special way and minister
[39:26] to their heart. We love you, Lord. Just
[39:29] pray that you be with brother Tim and
[39:31] the ministry that is away,
[39:34] Lord, and the service they'll be taking
[39:37] for the gallant soldier, Brother Ed,
[39:40] that you've taken home, Lord, to his
[39:43] reward.
[39:44] On this side, our hearts would be heavy.
[39:47] But oh Lord, he he fought a good fight
[39:49] and he finished the course and has
[39:51] entered into the glories of heaven. Now
[39:54] Lord, we want to run and we want to be
[39:57] faithful. So we just commit all these
[39:59] things into thy loving hands. In Jesus
[40:01] Christ's name we pray. Amen. If you have
[40:03] your Bibles, let's just turn into Psalms
[40:07] 23. Amen. It's always good to be
[40:09] gathered here with you. We certainly
[40:11] love you and hold you dear to our heart.
[40:13] And uh so many friends here. And I just
[40:16] want to say it's a privilege to uh uh
[40:19] stand here. And uh as brother Tim asked
[40:23] us just to come and put our shoulder to
[40:24] the wheel. Brother Tim uh means so much
[40:26] to me. I couldn't say enough and each
[40:29] one of you. So, we're just glad to be
[40:31] here. Are you Are you happy to be in
[40:33] church?
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Things might look a little different.
[40:36] You know, you might have to sit
[40:37] somewhere else and look a different way,
[40:38] but you know, we didn't come to just
[40:40] see, man. We come to see the Lord Jesus
[40:42] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[40:44] forever. So,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; are y'all ready for the word?
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Just appreciate all the song specials
[40:48] and everything. Uh we bring you
[40:51] greetings from uh our church, Christian
[40:53] Life Tabernacle, and just happy to be
[40:55] here. Psalms 23
[40:58] and4.
[41:01] Yay, though I walk through the valley of
[41:02] the shadow of death, I will fear no
[41:04] evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and
[41:07] thy staff, they comfort me. Thou
[41:09] preparest a table before me in the
[41:10] presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest
[41:13] my head with oil. My cup runth over.
[41:16] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[41:18] me all the days of my life, and I will
[41:20] dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[41:23] You may have your seats. If you'll also
[41:25] just turn with me to Isaiah 60.
[41:40] Very familiar scripture reading here.
[41:41] Isaiah 60 verse one.
[41:45] Everybody make it?
[41:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[41:49] It says, "Arise, shine, for the light is
[41:52] come, and the glory of the Lord is risen
[41:54] upon thee. For behold, the darkness
[41:57] shall cover the earth, and gross
[41:59] darkness the people, but the Lord shall
[42:01] rise upon thee." I like that. That's
[42:04] personal now. The Lord shall rise upon
[42:06] thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
[42:09] thee. Amen. I just want to read this
[42:12] quote. Brother Brandham says uh
[42:14] referring to Psalms 23, he says, "There
[42:16] has to be enough light to make a
[42:18] shadow." Right? So, we're referring now
[42:20] to Psalms 23, he said where David's
[42:22] saying, "Yay, though I walk through the
[42:24] valley of the shadow of death, I will
[42:27] fear no evil." And the prophet of God
[42:29] says, "There has to be enough light to
[42:31] make a shadow." If it was dark in here,
[42:34] my shadow would not be on this pulpit.
[42:36] But being that there's light, then it
[42:39] makes a shadow. See? So, so death is
[42:41] dark in a certain way, but it's only a
[42:44] shadow. See, the valley of the shadow of
[42:46] death. So, there has to be a certain
[42:48] amount of light in death to make it a
[42:51] shadow. Aren't you happy that so that
[42:54] there is light in the valley? You know,
[42:57] I just want to say we we go through
[42:58] seasons. We go through hard times and
[43:01] good times and dry times. We have
[43:03] mountain tops and we have valleys. But I
[43:06] want to say, aren't you happy that even
[43:08] though you're in the valley, there's
[43:09] light. And that's why we'd want to
[43:11] minister to you a little uh this evening
[43:13] on light in the valley. And you know,
[43:15] the valley isn't always a a fun place to
[43:18] be. You know, there's tribulations and
[43:19] trials and there's there's tests and
[43:22] things that we go through. And you know,
[43:23] we sing that song, you know, uh uh uh uh
[43:26] uh you know, uh you want to be like
[43:28] Jesus. On earth, may I be like him. And
[43:30] and that's our heart's desire. But then
[43:32] when you read in the scripture, it says
[43:33] he was a man of sorrow, a man of grief
[43:35] and agony and say, "Well, you know, may
[43:37] I want to be like him, but I don't want
[43:39] the grief. I don't want the agony. I I
[43:41] don't want to go through those times."
[43:42] But, you know, uh that's the way of a
[43:45] Christian many times. It's a way of
[43:46] grief and agony and sorrow. And I just
[43:49] believe God wants to speak to somebody
[43:51] uh a very personal this evening. you
[43:53] know, a certain one place, Brother
[43:55] Brandon would say, you know, we put a
[43:56] lot on the mountaintop experiences, but
[43:59] not so much down in the valley of
[44:00] decision where where there got to be a
[44:02] digging out and we got to get things out
[44:04] of our life and out of our way and and
[44:06] and have prayer meetings and, you know,
[44:08] uh many times that's that's uh we we we
[44:11] forget that the way of a Christians,
[44:12] it's rugged. It's it's hard. It's It's
[44:15] not always just uh fun and prosperity
[44:17] and and everything's good, but but no,
[44:20] there's agony and there's grief and and
[44:22] and it's hard. It can be a time of
[44:25] testing as as the scripture would say in
[44:27] Revelations 3:21. It say to him that
[44:29] overcomemeth,
[44:32] &gt;&gt; well, then you got to have something to
[44:33] overcome.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; You know, as the prophet says, he's not
[44:37] just going to push you through a pipe
[44:38] and and pull you out on the other side
[44:40] and say, "Well done, my my good and
[44:42] faithful service. if you didn't have
[44:44] nothing to overcome.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; But you're going to have something to
[44:46] overcome. Each one of you have something
[44:48] to overcome. You're going to when you
[44:49] when you come to the Lord and you're
[44:51] born again and filled with the Holy
[44:52] Ghost, that ain't the end. That's just
[44:53] the beginning.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; You're going to have some hard tests,
[44:56] some hard trials. You're going to have
[44:57] to go through some mountain tops and
[44:59] some valleys and go through some hard
[45:00] experiences. That's right.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; To him that overcomes will I grant to
[45:06] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[45:08] overcame and am sat down with my father
[45:11] in his throne. Brother Brandon was
[45:13] saying how can I overcome? He said the
[45:15] test is the greatest thing that ever
[45:17] happened to you.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Hey, that's a hard one there.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; You know you mean you mean you wait a
[45:24] second now, brother Brandon. I thought
[45:26] when when I was born again and filled
[45:28] with the Holy Ghost and a and the burden
[45:30] of sin was lifted off of me and I felt
[45:32] so free. I I could just rejoice. I could
[45:34] scream. I I could shout. I could run. I
[45:37] mean, Brother Brandon, that was the
[45:38] greatest thing that ever happened to me.
[45:39] Well, I'll give you that. But now the
[45:41] prophet's coming and saying, "But the
[45:43] test is the greatest thing that you
[45:44] know, the only thing you take with you
[45:45] to heaven is your character."
[45:48] &gt;&gt; And and how do you get character?
[45:49] Character is a victory. And if you're
[45:51] going to have a victory, you're going to
[45:52] have to have a
[45:54] &gt;&gt; you're going to have to have a test.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; I think it's time that we start
[45:58] embracing that we got to have some test.
[46:00] We got to have some trials that that way
[46:02] when they show up on your door and
[46:03] they're knocking, you're not running and
[46:05] wondering, "Well, what did I do wrong,
[46:06] brother Joe? What what what happened?
[46:08] Did I did I make a misstep? Did I do
[46:10] that?" No, it's a test.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest thing that ever
[46:15] happened to you. I believe it's written
[46:16] in the scriptures. Peter said that, "Oh,
[46:18] our trials are worth more to us than
[46:20] precious gold."
[46:22] &gt;&gt; It's a testing time. It's a good
[46:23] evidence to us that God is with us when
[46:26] we're tested. For all children of God
[46:29] are tested and they're tried. Has
[46:31] anybody ever gone through a trial?
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm preaching to some Christians
[46:36] tonight.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever gone through a dark
[46:38] valley?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe, maybe somebody here right now,
[46:41] you're in a dark valley. Maybe it's
[46:43] agony and it's grieving. I believe God
[46:44] is wanting to speak to somebody tonight.
[46:47] Because we go through hard times. We go
[46:49] through trials. We go through times when
[46:51] we we don't know whether to turn left or
[46:52] right. We can't see the future. We ain't
[46:54] got no vision. We don't know where to
[46:55] turn. We're wondering why is it so hard.
[46:57] It looks like everybody else has it
[46:59] easy. And and this person gets blessed
[47:01] and that person gets blessed and I'm
[47:02] working a 9 to5 at Taco Bell and it
[47:04] seems like I can never get out of the
[47:06] rat hole in mind and and it just seems
[47:08] like I can never advance in life. Oh, I
[47:10] want to tell you friend, don't look at
[47:12] earthly pleasures. Don't look at at your
[47:14] apartment. Don't look at your car. Don't
[47:16] look things of this world to measure
[47:18] God's prosperity in life. I want to tell
[47:20] you if you've got a revelation that
[47:22] Malachi 4:5 is a vindicated prophet to
[47:25] lead you into a body change, I say you
[47:27] are blessed. You are blessed beyond
[47:29] measure.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; But you might be going through a hard
[47:34] time. You might be going through a
[47:35] trial. You might be wondering, "Why has
[47:38] this all befallen me?"
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe it's the greatest thing that
[47:42] ever happened to you. I'm going to tell
[47:44] you, some of you young people, you go to
[47:46] camp and you have a real born again,
[47:48] Holy Ghost filled experience with God
[47:49] and you get the Holy Ghost and you come
[47:51] home and some of those things that you
[47:53] were fighting and battling, they show up
[47:55] knocking on your door. Yes, you might
[47:56] fall to it, but I want to tell you the
[47:58] difference is is you get back up.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Don't be surprised when the devil comes
[48:04] trying to tempt you.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; The test is a testing time. It's the
[48:09] greatest thing that ever happened to you
[48:10] because you know what it teaches you,
[48:11] man, I there's some more growing. I got
[48:13] to do
[48:15] &gt;&gt; you know and don't let devil rob you of
[48:17] your experience but what happens is a
[48:19] lot of times the test comes and maybe
[48:21] you fall but you know what you get back
[48:22] up say Lord I I want to be right I want
[48:25] to be prayed up cuz next time that thing
[48:26] comes around I want to get the victory
[48:29] &gt;&gt; because what is it doing it's molding
[48:31] you it's shaping you it's building
[48:32] character you're building up into the
[48:34] stature of a perfect man
[48:37] &gt;&gt; so we go through those trials and those
[48:39] hard places doesn't mean God's not with
[48:42] you
[48:43] That's right.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, a vindicated prophet
[48:45] told me it's one good evidence,
[48:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:49] &gt;&gt; That God is with you.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, now I I want to I want to talk like
[48:53] that. I don't want to talk use the
[48:54] devil's language. Oh, well, I'm going
[48:56] through a hard time because, you know, I
[48:58] I messed up and maybe I don't have what
[49:00] I thought I had and and maybe that's
[49:02] just everybody else and I'm foolish
[49:04] virgin and I maybe I better start
[49:06] handing out bottles of water and cups of
[49:08] water because at least there will be
[49:09] grace for me. Quit talking like that.
[49:12] You are the bride.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; You are going in a rapture.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; And it's about time you recognize if
[49:18] you're in a valley in a hard time. I
[49:20] ain't saying you you got to be jumping
[49:22] up and down. But I want to say there's
[49:23] peace in the valley.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; There can be joy in the valley.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; In your agony, in your grief, there can
[49:29] be peace.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; A peace that passes understanding. And I
[49:33] want to say you can sit there like Job
[49:35] and say, "Though he slay me, yet I trust
[49:37] him." Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And you can say the test is the greatest
[49:42] thing that ever happened to me.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me tonight?
[49:47] &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage you.
[49:50] May maybe maybe this is maybe this is
[49:52] the great shepherd leaving the 99 for
[49:54] the one. So, let's just maybe all get
[49:56] put our shoulder to the will of God
[49:57] speaking to one
[50:01] &gt;&gt; God coming to you and letting you know
[50:03] that that maybe it does look hopeless to
[50:05] you and maybe you're getting down to the
[50:07] end of the line. You know, God uh you
[50:09] can look into the Bible and see many uh
[50:12] uh stories where it looks like they got
[50:13] down to the end of the line and God
[50:15] wants it to get that way where you can
[50:17] no longer depend on your ability. You
[50:19] can no longer depend on man. Where you
[50:20] finally look up and say, "Lord, I got no
[50:22] other option." Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; I got no other way. The doctors have
[50:27] given up. Uh my friends have given up.
[50:29] And Lord, I even I've given up now. I
[50:32] need you to come on the scene.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; You look pretty hopeless for them Hebrew
[50:38] children.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; You know, they had gotten to a place
[50:40] where they said, "Look, I'm not going to
[50:42] bend. I'm not going to bow. You know,
[50:44] you you can make your laws and your
[50:45] creeds and your dogmas and and tell, but
[50:48] I'm going to stay true to the word."
[50:49] They said, "All right, we got to throw
[50:50] you in the fiery furnace." Well, they it
[50:52] looked like they were getting down to
[50:53] the end of the road.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Looks like we're going to have to die
[50:56] for the cause. And you know, Brother
[50:57] Brandon would so beautifully uh
[50:59] dramatized where Wormwood would come and
[51:01] say, "Lord, I I'll go down. Let me go
[51:03] down the I'll wash and I'll set him free
[51:06] right now. I'll pour out the water. I'll
[51:07] do whatever I have to. I'll put out the
[51:09] fiery furnace."
[51:11] &gt;&gt; And maybe uh Michael was standing and
[51:13] say, "Well, Lord, I I I'll go right now.
[51:16] I I'll set the thing straight. I'll
[51:17] deliver your children. They stood for
[51:20] you. my house stand for them, Lord. Let
[51:22] me go.
[51:24] And God just sat back and said, "No, no,
[51:27] I don't want any of you to go
[51:30] &gt;&gt; because I'm going to go myself."
[51:32] &gt;&gt; And there the great creator, Jehovah,
[51:35] you know, he gr he he just blew out some
[51:37] wind and said, "Come from the east and
[51:38] come from the west." He grabbed a few
[51:40] lightning bolts and there he fleshed on
[51:42] down. And what was it? There was a
[51:43] fourth man in the fire. I want to tell
[51:45] you, you might be in a fiery furnace
[51:47] right now. You might be going through a
[51:49] deep dark trial and it might look
[51:51] hopeless. Want to tell you that Jesus
[51:52] Christ is here for you.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; James would say in chapter 1 and verse
[52:01] three, knowing this, that the trying of
[52:03] your faith workketh patience.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Well, let patience have her perfect work
[52:07] that you might be perfect and entire
[52:09] wanting nothing.
[52:12] I mean, how many times have you had some
[52:14] really good church services, some really
[52:17] good meetings, and man, you're just
[52:19] testifying about I believe I'm healed.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; I I I believe God's word and and my I'm
[52:26] just standing upon the uh the promise of
[52:29] God's word and and you're testifying and
[52:31] everything and oh, you're feeling so
[52:33] good. Well, listen to what the prophet
[52:35] of God said. He said, "Satan, he won't
[52:37] let you rest upon it very long. When you
[52:41] go to talking about the Lord Jesus and
[52:43] about his works, he is going to be right
[52:46] there to interrupt that.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; That's what's going on. You keep
[52:51] thinking, "What did I do wrong? Do I not
[52:53] have faith? I didn't get what I thought
[52:55] I got." Come on. Am I talking to
[52:57] somebody? Has anybody ever been there
[52:59] where you've been in a really good
[53:00] service? The pastor has brought the
[53:02] word. He spoke directly to your life and
[53:04] directly to your situation. You talked
[53:06] to it to the wife on the way home. My
[53:08] goodness, Lord was really speaking to
[53:09] our needs and and things are going to be
[53:11] different. We're going to we're going to
[53:12] get our home right. We're going to get
[53:14] our life right. We're going to go on
[53:15] with Jesus. And you start making the
[53:16] right things right and and getting rid
[53:18] of the wrong things and and all of a
[53:20] sudden one day, two day, one week, two
[53:22] week go by and all of a sudden a big
[53:24] test shows up and a big trial and and
[53:26] maybe something happens. You say, "What
[53:27] did I do?"
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Well, you did exactly what you said you
[53:33] did. You took God at his word. You
[53:36] testify that he did something for you.
[53:38] But our prophet said, "Satan ain't going
[53:40] to let you uh rest up very long."
[53:46] &gt;&gt; He's right there to interrupt that.
[53:49] Now, he starts to speak about
[53:53] the disciples and how they were out on
[53:55] the boat. He said, "Trouble arose and
[53:58] all of a sudden the ship begin to rock.
[54:00] The sails blew off and the orars broke
[54:04] and the water filled up the boat and
[54:05] trouble was at hand. See, it happened
[54:07] suddenly. All hopes of survival was
[54:10] gone. Though they had seen him do so
[54:13] many great things. Can you testify to
[54:16] that?
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm here to have church. Y'all
[54:18] here to have church.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Well, you might be tired. It might be
[54:21] Wednesday. But he's the same yesterday,
[54:22] today, and forever. And I choose to
[54:24] worship. I choose to give him praise. I
[54:26] choose to Amen. I choose to have a good
[54:28] time. Look, I had a good time out in the
[54:30] world. I'm done having good times out in
[54:32] the world. I come to church to have
[54:33] church. I come to church to have a good
[54:35] time. I don't want to have a good time
[54:37] out in the world. There's only a bad
[54:39] time out there. So, I want to tell you,
[54:40] when I can get happy, when I can have my
[54:42] fun is when I get together with God's
[54:44] people.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Hey, I like coming together. I like to
[54:48] praise him. I like to worship him.
[54:50] Because you go back out there, that's
[54:52] where the trial, that's where the test
[54:53] is, and that's where the devil's trying
[54:54] to interrupt things. But I like it when
[54:56] I can come to church and we brought our
[54:58] little licks of fire and the pillar of
[55:00] fires here and it's swirling around. And
[55:02] if you need a blessing, if you need
[55:03] deliverance, if you need healing, he's
[55:05] here to give it to you. Hey, I come to
[55:07] have church tonight.
[55:13] Trouble's at hand.
[55:17] See, all hopes of survival was gone.
[55:20] Though they they they had seen him do so
[55:22] many great things. When trouble strikes,
[55:25] they forget all about it.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you something,
[55:29] brother. Isn't that about the attitude
[55:32] of the people today?
[55:33] &gt;&gt; We'll come to church here and shout and
[55:36] praise God when our brothers and so
[55:38] forth speak the word and we can hear the
[55:40] promises. We just praise God for what
[55:43] he's done. Listen at the testimony of
[55:45] the one saying, "I once was blind, uh,
[55:48] but now I see." And we hear the
[55:50] miraculous healings and the people
[55:51] testify and a and pray prayer requests
[55:54] have come over and then the praise
[55:56] report goes forward and oh uh we rejoice
[55:59] and we gather together.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; He says but just let it strike our
[56:05] little house one time.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Then we forget all about that glory
[56:12] &gt;&gt; that we've been enjoying.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; All those great things. Oh, it's it's us
[56:18] now.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; See, those things happen for a purpose.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; They happen to try you.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Trouble strikes
[56:34] and then we forget.
[56:36] We forget all that God's done.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; You know, we we've we've heard the
[56:42] testimonies. We've we've been in the
[56:43] church. I I say we could have we could
[56:45] have uh saints stand up one by one and
[56:48] testify of the supernatural gone around
[56:50] the world testifying preachers picking
[56:52] up the testimonies and testifying of the
[56:55] supernatural because he's the saint
[56:56] yesterday to am I talking to somebody
[56:58] has somebody experienced the
[57:00] supernatural touch of almighty God. Has
[57:02] somebody been healed? Have they been
[57:04] delivered of cancer? Have you been
[57:05] delivered of something in your body that
[57:07] the doctors give up? But Jesus Christ
[57:10] been the same yesterday, today, and
[57:11] forever. He came on the sun scene and
[57:13] healed you. Has somebody had a lost way
[57:15] in a prodical son that was out there in
[57:17] the world, but you prayed and you prayed
[57:19] and you held all life and you kept on
[57:22] praying and God brought him back into
[57:23] the fog. I want to tell you that's the
[57:25] supernatural.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; And we rejoice and we praise God and we
[57:30] thank God for all the things that he
[57:32] done and then all of a sudden we're so
[57:34] thankful for what he did for brother J.
[57:36] We're so thankful what he did for Sister
[57:37] L. We're so thankful what he's done for
[57:39] each one of us. But then all of a sudden
[57:40] it strikes her. Oh no.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[57:45] is God with me?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; What did I do to deserve this?
[57:51] &gt;&gt; We forget all about it.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; We start to point fingers. We start to
[57:55] wonder, is it the church's fault? Is it
[57:58] is it do we got this wrong? Is it my
[57:59] wife? Is it me? Should I quit my job?
[58:02] Should I should what what Lord, why is
[58:04] this all befalling me?
[58:06] See, that's what happens sometimes when
[58:08] the strike the the the it strikes
[58:10] suddenly and all of a sudden you find
[58:12] yourself in a a valley and the prophet
[58:13] of guess God said we all we all sudden
[58:15] forget.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, there's one story in the
[58:18] Bible I I really I really I really like
[58:21] and and I'm just thinking about it
[58:23] because there was a time that David, you
[58:25] know, he had to go down into the valley
[58:27] to fight Goliath. But, you know, he got
[58:30] down into that valley and he had to
[58:31] fight Goliath. But the scripture doesn't
[58:33] say he forgot.
[58:35] David remembered.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David got down there. He
[58:40] didn't say, "Oh my goodness, you know,
[58:41] you didn't look that big. You didn't
[58:43] look that big when I was up on the hill
[58:45] and now that I'm down in the valley and
[58:46] you're just, man, you really are a big
[58:48] giant. No wonder how my brothers are up
[58:49] there quaking in their boots and they
[58:50] don't want to fight you. You really are
[58:52] a man of war. You really are big and
[58:54] your hands as big as my whole body. What
[58:56] in the world am I going to do when David
[58:58] got down there and it looked like it was
[59:00] impossible? It looked like there was
[59:02] nothing he can do about it. David looked
[59:04] at that cancer. He looked at that trial
[59:07] and he didn't forget. He remembered. He
[59:09] said, "Oh, God was with me when I slayed
[59:11] a lion. God was with me when I killed a
[59:14] man and the last you ain't no different.
[59:17] This trial is no different. This devil
[59:19] is no different. This demon is no
[59:21] different." I say it's time. He be like
[59:23] tabernacles. Remember, remember the
[59:26] glory. Remember the outpouring. Remember
[59:28] the blessing. He was saying yesterday,
[59:31] today, friend. And he is here.
[59:36] I say we ought to remember.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; I said we ought to remember.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Well, if you haven't started, I'm hoping
[59:49] somebody starts remembering right now.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'll give you some time to do it.
[59:55] You remember when you were out out there
[59:56] in the chicken yard of denominations? Do
[59:59] you remember when you were out there in
[1:00:01] the muck and mire of sin and the only
[1:00:03] god you had was drugs and alcohol
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; and it could never fill that void in
[1:00:08] your life? Do you remember out there
[1:00:09] when you went to all the denominational
[1:00:11] churches and it just never struck the
[1:00:13] chord with you?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; You remember growing up on the church
[1:00:18] pew and you heard that God sent a
[1:00:19] prophet and you heard brother Tim preach
[1:00:21] all your life. One day,
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; I think there ought to be some young
[1:00:27] people in here that remembers what God
[1:00:29] did for you at camp.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Satan's trying to come and rob you of
[1:00:32] your experience and tell you you don't
[1:00:34] got what you said you had. But I'm here
[1:00:36] as a servant of God to tell you you
[1:00:38] didn't get the Holy Ghost. You did have
[1:00:40] a real born again with experience with
[1:00:42] God. And Satan's trying to get you to
[1:00:44] forget. But I say you ought to stand up
[1:00:46] tonight and say, "I remember."
[1:00:48] [Applause]
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm talking to somebody.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Hey, don't get me remembering.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I remember when I was stoked
[1:01:00] drugs and alcohol. I didn't know what to
[1:01:03] do. I didn't know where to go. I tried
[1:01:06] to call on his name. But you know what?
[1:01:08] It was a formality
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; because I wasn't willing to die. I
[1:01:12] didn't want to give up my earthly
[1:01:13] pleasures. I wanted to hang on to some
[1:01:15] of them.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Just take away the guilt, Lord. just
[1:01:18] take away the condemnation because I
[1:01:20] know I shouldn't be living like this,
[1:01:22] but let me hold on to my drinking.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And I remember that. But one day I got
[1:01:29] to a place where it didn't matter. I
[1:01:31] said, "Lord, whatever this is, hey, I'm
[1:01:33] just remembering a little bit tonight.
[1:01:34] So maybe this service is for me." I got
[1:01:36] to a place where I said, "Lord, whatever
[1:01:38] this is, it's bigger than me and I need
[1:01:41] your help." Oh, and it was just like the
[1:01:43] Hebrew children in the fiery furnace. He
[1:01:46] said, "Stand back, Michael. Stand back,
[1:01:48] Warren. This is my Jeep seat. I'm coming
[1:01:51] for him." And the great Jehovah God, he
[1:01:54] dropped down in the Beth, Texas, and he
[1:01:57] changed my life.
[1:01:59] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:02:01] forever. If you need God to come on your
[1:02:03] life right now, he'll fill you with the
[1:02:05] Holy Ghost, he'll deliver you of cancer.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, I need somebody to help me
[1:02:11] remember.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:17] Oh, he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:02:19] forever.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Prophet of all goes goes on and says
[1:02:24] trouble
[1:02:26] that we can't remedy.
[1:02:29] Seems like the doctors can't remedy.
[1:02:32] Nothing
[1:02:34] can remedy.
[1:02:37] Think of them disciples, the ores busted
[1:02:39] up. Maybe put yourself in that
[1:02:41] situation. Maybe that's how you feel
[1:02:42] tonight.
[1:02:44] Maybe your marriage is all busted up and
[1:02:47] your house is all busted up and your
[1:02:48] home's all busted up and your children
[1:02:50] ain't serving God. You feel all busted
[1:02:52] up and your orars are busted up and your
[1:02:54] boat's taking on water and you don't
[1:02:56] know how much longer you can make it.
[1:03:02] Satan just pulling it on, determining to
[1:03:04] sink your life. Doctors have given up.
[1:03:08] And that's what happens. we start to
[1:03:10] forget all that God's done and doubt
[1:03:13] starts to swirl and fear starts to press
[1:03:15] in. The prophet of God would go on and
[1:03:17] say, "Now notice trouble that they could
[1:03:20] not remedy. Then fear sets in just like
[1:03:23] it is now. Even we got fears in national
[1:03:26] troubles. We got fears in church
[1:03:28] troubles. We got fears all around
[1:03:30] everywhere." Now we say, "Well, now what
[1:03:34] can be done about it?" If we could only
[1:03:36] remember
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; that he is in the ship.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; See, you say, "But yes, is he in the
[1:03:44] ship?"
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; He is in the ship.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; I don't care how big the storm.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; How big the tumor,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; how big the trial, how deep the valley,
[1:03:56] I'm wanting to tell you this evening,
[1:03:58] there's light in the valley.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Don't be weary. Jesus is here.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; And sometimes when you don't feel him
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; and sometimes it doesn't feel like he's
[1:04:11] near, I say, why don't you just start
[1:04:13] remembering,
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Lord? I might not feel you right now,
[1:04:17] but I can think back.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, you might be able to think back 40,
[1:04:21] 50 years what it was like on that day
[1:04:24] when you met the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[1:04:26] tell you, it's good to revisit those
[1:04:27] things. I I I say, young people, I I I
[1:04:30] encourage you to start going to some of
[1:04:31] our elders. If you don't know their
[1:04:34] testimony and you think they've just
[1:04:35] been sitting a church pew all their
[1:04:37] life, I encourage you young people to go
[1:04:39] encourage the old the older and go. You
[1:04:42] know what, sister? Why don't you tell me
[1:04:43] a little bit like it was I can testify
[1:04:46] of some of some saints in here been a
[1:04:47] real Sister Rachel's been a real
[1:04:49] encouragement to me. She's a she's a she
[1:04:51] she's a a warrior for this message. I
[1:04:54] tell you, I've sat around. I've heard
[1:04:55] her testify and I've seen her stand. I
[1:04:57] say that does something for me. You
[1:04:58] ought to go to some of the older ones,
[1:05:00] you young people, and give them a chance
[1:05:01] to testify. You know what it'll do?
[1:05:03] It'll not only light their fire again,
[1:05:05] it'll light your fire.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Hey, this gospel is from faith to faith.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; And you older people, if you've seen a
[1:05:13] young person's life be changed, why
[1:05:14] don't you go tell them say, "I see God's
[1:05:16] really done something for you." Why
[1:05:17] don't you testify what has God done for
[1:05:19] you?
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And the scripture talks, it's good to
[1:05:23] remember.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; It's good to talk about the things that
[1:05:26] God has done in our life.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; He's in the boat. He's in the ship.
[1:05:31] Whether you feel it, whether you don't
[1:05:33] feel it, Christ is here.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; He goes on and says here, this is him.
[1:05:41] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:05:42] word was with God
[1:05:44] and the word was God. And the word
[1:05:47] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:05:49] forever.
[1:05:51] It still just take this. It's the
[1:05:54] remedy. It's the medicine.
[1:05:57] You hearing me? It still take this.
[1:05:59] Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; It's the remedy. It's the medicine. It's
[1:06:03] the cure for every breakdown. It's the
[1:06:06] cure for every cancer. It's the cure for
[1:06:09] every ailment. It's God manifested in a
[1:06:12] word. Look, just take this. Come on,
[1:06:15] church. Just take this.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; It's the medicine. Just take the message
[1:06:19] of the hour. It's the medicine. It's the
[1:06:21] cure for every breakdown. It's the cure
[1:06:24] for every breakup. It's the cure for
[1:06:26] every cancer. It's the cure for every
[1:06:28] ailment. It's the cure for every being
[1:06:30] laid off. It's the cure for not having a
[1:06:32] job. It's the cure for not being able to
[1:06:34] pay your bills. It's the cure for every
[1:06:36] mistake. It's the cure for every
[1:06:38] failure. It's the cure for whatever
[1:06:39] you're going. I'm saying what we need to
[1:06:41] do is take this tonight. The word of God
[1:06:43] is always the answer. It's the only
[1:06:45] answer. Man's ideas will fail. Religion
[1:06:48] will fail. But it's still just take
[1:06:50] this.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; It is the cure.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. I don't care if it's mental,
[1:06:57] physical, spiritual, emotional.
[1:07:02] I believe God's trying to speak to
[1:07:04] somebody. Maybe you're all emotionally
[1:07:05] erect. Maybe the anxiety and things
[1:07:07] getting to you so bad you don't know
[1:07:08] what to do. I want to tell you the cure
[1:07:11] is the word of God.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And the word says he is still in the
[1:07:17] boat. He's still in the building. You
[1:07:19] didn't leave him at the last church
[1:07:20] service. You didn't leave him that camp.
[1:07:22] You didn't leave him here or there.
[1:07:23] Christ is here right now, present
[1:07:26] amongst us to meet whatever need you
[1:07:28] have.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Is there somebody here that needs
[1:07:32] something?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; I saw a lot of hands go up in the
[1:07:35] building before we started preaching. I
[1:07:36] believe God is coming to you tonight to
[1:07:38] speak to your need.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to tell you it's the cure.
[1:07:43] It's the remedy. I don't know. What do
[1:07:45] you got need of? You're the one that
[1:07:46] raised the man. What's in your heart?
[1:07:48] This message is the cure. This word is
[1:07:50] the cure. I want to say Paul said, "I
[1:07:51] didn't come to you with enticing words,
[1:07:53] a man's wisdom, but in power and
[1:07:55] demonstration." And the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:57] fire is here tonight to perform his word
[1:08:00] the same yesterday, today, and forever
[1:08:02] in power and in demonstration. Oh, I
[1:08:05] want to tell you this, this medicine,
[1:08:07] this cure, it'll give you back your joy.
[1:08:09] It'll give you back your peace. It'll
[1:08:11] give you back your shout. It'll give you
[1:08:13] back your dance. It'll give you back
[1:08:14] your victory. It'll give you back your
[1:08:16] joy.
[1:08:18] I don't know about you, but sometimes I
[1:08:20] let the devil rob me of the joy of my
[1:08:22] salvation. And I'm here tonight to say,
[1:08:24] "I'm taking it back." Say, "You might
[1:08:26] have taken my joy. You might have taken
[1:08:28] my shot, but I'm taking it back because
[1:08:30] it still take this Jesus Christ the same
[1:08:33] yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:41] Prophet of God goes on and says,
[1:08:45] "The word is God."
[1:08:48] Jesus said, "It's a seed. The seed being
[1:08:50] planted in the right kind of ground,
[1:08:51] it'll grow exactly what it is, and every
[1:08:54] promise will be produced. We forget all
[1:08:57] about it. Know that he is in the ship."
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Help me preach
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; or help me read
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; or just help me.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; I need a lot of help.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; They should have known that he knew that
[1:09:18] that thing was going to happen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And we act, oh Lord,
[1:09:25] why me? And we act like God's this uh uh
[1:09:30] uh uh you know, you know, when I say
[1:09:33] when I was a kid, but I still do. You
[1:09:34] know, well, I don't want to claim it,
[1:09:36] but the doctor said I had ADD. You know,
[1:09:38] I got I you know, I'd start something,
[1:09:40] then I go to the next thing. I'd have
[1:09:42] five things going at one time and not
[1:09:43] one of them get finished.
[1:09:46] You know, I'm like, man, what's wrong
[1:09:47] with this kid? You know, I'm a
[1:09:48] visionary. I got big visions and I can
[1:09:49] start all the visions, but I don't know
[1:09:51] if I can bring them to pass. I need
[1:09:53] people to help me.
[1:09:56] And that's a that's a that's a that's a
[1:09:57] real strength is when you figure out
[1:09:59] what your weakness is.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Some of us just we just want to be so
[1:10:03] strong. We don't need nobody. We don't
[1:10:05] need the preacher. We don't need God. I
[1:10:07] got the message figured out.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. Oh. No. You You better find out
[1:10:12] you are weak and you can't do nothing.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; And then when you finally get to a place
[1:10:17] where you're so weak and you can't do
[1:10:18] nothing, God says, "I don't need your
[1:10:19] weakness either."
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Like, wait a second. God doesn't need
[1:10:23] your ability or your your your strength
[1:10:26] or your weakness.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; He just needs a surrendered vessel to
[1:10:29] say, "Lord, I believe." If the word is
[1:10:31] the remedy, if it's the cure, then I'm
[1:10:32] staying with that. I'm staying with the
[1:10:34] message. I'm staying with what works.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; God gl God doesn't have ADD. He didn't
[1:10:41] start a work in your life and then run
[1:10:43] over and now he's working on brother Joe
[1:10:45] and he forgot all about you. And you're
[1:10:46] over here wondering, "Well, God started
[1:10:48] a work in my life, but where is he?"
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; He's right there.
[1:10:53] He's been there the whole time.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Don't get frustrated when the test
[1:10:59] comes. It's the greatest thing that ever
[1:11:01] happened. God has confidence in you
[1:11:04] because he knows what he put in you.
[1:11:05] Just like Job.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Job didn't even know the revelation was
[1:11:10] in there. But when the test and the
[1:11:12] trial came and it got so dark what the
[1:11:14] revelation struck.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; So God lets you go through trials.
[1:11:20] He let you go through agony and times of
[1:11:23] testing.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; You should know that God knows.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; He knew it was going to happen. Do you
[1:11:32] believe that?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Certainly he knew it. He knew all the
[1:11:35] time it was going to happen. Why? He
[1:11:37] only did it to prove to test their
[1:11:41] faith.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; You mean I got to be tested? You mean
[1:11:46] when I come out of church service and I
[1:11:48] say, "Yeah, I believe the word of God. I
[1:11:50] believe I repented of my sins. I believe
[1:11:52] I've been filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:53] fire. Now, let's just put out the picnic
[1:11:56] blanket. Brother Joe, make us some
[1:11:58] sandwiches and bring the chips. We're
[1:11:59] going to have a picnic until the rapture
[1:12:01] comes.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Don't work like that.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; And if you do that, the ants are going
[1:12:08] to end up in the chips.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; The wasp are going to be on the
[1:12:11] sandwich.
[1:12:13] The stray dogs are going to come eat it.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Your picnic's going to get tested
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; cuz it ain't a picnic.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; It's a battle.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; And you're wondering, Lord, our Lord,
[1:12:25] did you know? Yes, he knows.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz he knows you're a son and daughter
[1:12:29] of God. And every son and daughter of
[1:12:30] God that comes to God must be tried. It
[1:12:32] must be tested. But don't fear. God
[1:12:34] knows what he put in you. He'll never
[1:12:36] give you more than you can bear.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; He'll be right there with you.
[1:12:45] Certainly he knew it.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; He knew all the time it was going to
[1:12:49] happen. He did it to test their faith.
[1:12:51] And sometimes he does the same thing for
[1:12:53] you and me. He lets things happen just
[1:12:56] to see what we'll do about it.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? The scripture said,
[1:13:00] "Every son that cometh to God must be
[1:13:02] tried, chased, and proved." Satan will
[1:13:04] make you prove every inch of ground that
[1:13:07] you claim. Certainly, he will.
[1:13:12] Oh, and when you've claimed, I've been
[1:13:14] delivered, Brother Joe. I've been set
[1:13:16] free. I've been filled with the Holy
[1:13:17] Ghost.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; God delivered me from pornography. God
[1:13:19] delivered me from anxiety. God delivered
[1:13:21] me from depression. That doesn't mean
[1:13:23] depression or anxiety won't show up
[1:13:24] knocking.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Because what is what did the prophet
[1:13:29] say? Satan will make you prove every
[1:13:31] inch of ground that you claim. He
[1:13:33] certainly will. I want to tell you
[1:13:35] whenever those things show up that you
[1:13:37] claimed you've been delivered from,
[1:13:39] don't forget. That's not church. I'm
[1:13:41] telling you, that's not the time to
[1:13:42] forget. That's the time to remember.
[1:13:45] When anxiety comes knocking, when
[1:13:47] depression comes knocking, when
[1:13:48] pornography comes knocking, that's the
[1:13:50] time to remember. Oh, Satan, I want to
[1:13:52] tell you, I did believe God. I did take
[1:13:55] him at his word and I came down to the
[1:13:57] altar and the pillar of fire came. He
[1:13:59] touched my life. He delivered me. I've
[1:14:02] been set free. And I want to tell you
[1:14:04] that's the time to start rejoicing.
[1:14:06] Satan, you might have come back to put
[1:14:08] depression on me. You might have come
[1:14:09] back to put anxiety on me. But I am
[1:14:11] remembering tonight that Jesus Christ is
[1:14:14] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; What happens if I fall?
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Get back up.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Does that mean I wasn't delivered?
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; That's not what that means. That's
[1:14:30] right.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; It means Satan's trying to test you
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; and make you prove
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; every inch of ground that you claim. See
[1:14:41] the difference many time is before you
[1:14:44] weren't fighting.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm talking about to somebody
[1:14:48] tonight. Before you weren't fighting,
[1:14:50] you kind of just went with the flow.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; But when God comes and does a work in
[1:14:55] your life, now you're fighting. And if
[1:14:58] you fall, if you give in, you say, "Lord
[1:15:00] Jesus, I didn't mean to do that. Forgive
[1:15:02] me, Lord. I plead the blood of Jesus
[1:15:03] Christ. I claim the blood, Lord. Uh,
[1:15:06] forgive me for my iniquity. Forgive me
[1:15:07] for for my failure, but I'm going to get
[1:15:09] back up. Don't stay down."
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; You get back up because what has God
[1:15:15] called you to do? He called you to prove
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; that you are a real son and daughter of
[1:15:19] God.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God lets those things happen.
[1:15:24] See, we we got to remember, we got to
[1:15:26] believe what the word says about us,
[1:15:28] that I am the bride.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; I I I have been placed here. I was
[1:15:33] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:15:35] the world. God knew that I would be in
[1:15:37] this age and he gave me an ear to hear
[1:15:39] the voice of Malachi 4:5. I've been
[1:15:42] predestinated to overcome the devil and
[1:15:44] the wickedness of the, you know, it's
[1:15:46] gross darkness upon the look out there.
[1:15:48] It's gross darkness upon the people, but
[1:15:50] oh, arise and shine. Thy light has come.
[1:15:53] Don't be surprised when you go into a
[1:15:55] valley
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; right now. Some of you are just proving
[1:15:59] to the devil.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; See, you just think, "Woe is me. Why did
[1:16:05] the trial come upon me? Why am I having
[1:16:07] such a hard time?" Because you're
[1:16:08] proving to the devil
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; that I do got what I said I got. But I
[1:16:12] ain't the one that said it. He said it.
[1:16:14] And I'm just taking sides with Jesus.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I say there ought to be
[1:16:18] a victory shout in the camp of God. You
[1:16:21] don't have to be discouraged in the
[1:16:22] valley. You don't have to be worried
[1:16:24] because you're going through a hard
[1:16:25] time. It's God only testing you and
[1:16:27] allowing that faith that's inside of you
[1:16:29] to prove that he's the same yesterday,
[1:16:31] today, and forever.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe you you've been in a valley and
[1:16:35] you haven't heard from God in a long
[1:16:37] time. You haven't felt his presence in a
[1:16:39] long time.
[1:16:42] Well, we go through times like that.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; That does not mean God's not with you.
[1:16:49] Prophet of God said, "I believe it's
[1:16:50] joyful and happy." But remember,
[1:16:52] brother, it's the way of agony
[1:16:55] and suffering in the cross.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; You must realize that, too. Just as
[1:17:01] Timothy would say, if we suffer, we
[1:17:03] shall also reign with him.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying by God's grace, my burden
[1:17:09] is to speak to somebody specifically.
[1:17:11] It's not always smooth.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; It's not always easy.
[1:17:16] It's not always outward uh joyous
[1:17:20] a and like you're just floating on the
[1:17:23] clouds.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; It's rugged.
[1:17:28] There's agony and suffering and real
[1:17:31] heartache and real heartbreak and lost
[1:17:34] loved ones and family troubles and
[1:17:36] things that you go through and you feel
[1:17:38] like you can't talk to nobody about it
[1:17:39] and maybe you're embarrassed that you're
[1:17:41] going through it.
[1:17:43] That does not change that you are a son
[1:17:44] and daughter of God. A matter of fact,
[1:17:46] the prophet of God is encouraging you,
[1:17:47] telling you it's actually a good
[1:17:49] evidence that God is with you because
[1:17:50] the test is the greatest thing that ever
[1:17:52] happened. Oh, I say you might be
[1:17:54] brokenhearted. You might be in agony.
[1:17:56] You might be really going through a hard
[1:17:58] time. You might not have felt like God
[1:17:59] has spoken to you a long time. But I say
[1:18:01] it's time to start remembering, Lord.
[1:18:03] You started the work. And I know that it
[1:18:05] wasn't me that did it, Lord Jesus. But
[1:18:07] one day, you came and you started
[1:18:09] calling my name, Lord. and you put
[1:18:12] something on the inside of me to respond
[1:18:13] to that call. And I'll never forget what
[1:18:16] you've done for me. I thank you for
[1:18:17] Calvary. I thank you for the blood. I
[1:18:20] thank you for the Holy Ghost. But Lord,
[1:18:21] I'm going through a really hard time
[1:18:23] right now. But you told me in your word
[1:18:25] that you'd be with me. You'd be even in
[1:18:27] me. You would never forsake me, but you
[1:18:29] would be with me till the end. Oh, you
[1:18:31] might be going through a hard time, but
[1:18:32] God is telling you, I am with you.
[1:18:36] Yes sir.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Prophet said
[1:18:41] in the church age he said he may commit
[1:18:44] you to death as he did Paul. He may
[1:18:46] commit you to suffering as he did Job.
[1:18:48] That is his prerogative. He is
[1:18:49] sovereign. But it's always with a
[1:18:53] purpose. If he did not have a purpose
[1:18:57] then he would be the author of
[1:18:58] frustration and not of peace.
[1:19:01] It's what Job said. He said, "A man that
[1:19:03] is born of a woman is a few days and
[1:19:05] full of trouble."
[1:19:08] Has anybody Is anybody hearing me?
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Anybody been going through some hard
[1:19:14] times?
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but out there
[1:19:18] it's it's wicked, man. It's dark.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, we we are living in such a a
[1:19:23] time of sinful acts of violence and and
[1:19:26] just people are total total have totally
[1:19:28] lost their mind. The prophet of God
[1:19:30] said, "If this goes uh for another 50
[1:19:32] years, it'll be totally insanity." And
[1:19:33] to think that we're living in the time
[1:19:34] where we are seeing total insanity.
[1:19:37] Common sense is not common anymore. You
[1:19:39] can't even talk facts or reason with
[1:19:41] people. There's like no basis for their
[1:19:43] reality. They they believe things that
[1:19:45] aren't even real. And it has no
[1:19:47] absolute. It has no footing. The only
[1:19:49] thing you can tie it back to is that the
[1:19:51] lid of hell has been ripped off. And
[1:19:53] 200,000,000 demons have been loosed upon
[1:19:56] the earth. And you're seeing demons
[1:19:57] pressing themselves into people's lives
[1:19:59] and possessing people and causing them
[1:20:01] to do uh the most heinous things that
[1:20:03] we've ever seen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And and you wonder why our young people
[1:20:07] are are having a hard time. And you you
[1:20:09] wonder why there's there there there's
[1:20:12] difficulties praying and you you wonder
[1:20:14] why there's so many emotional challenge.
[1:20:15] Come on. We're living in the darkest age
[1:20:17] that man has ever seen. Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; And then right in the own ranks of the
[1:20:21] message where we we we're experiencing
[1:20:24] uh uh deep uh uh uh uh dark uh things
[1:20:27] that a Christian should uh you're
[1:20:28] hearing about uh churches and and and
[1:20:31] families and breakups and things happen
[1:20:33] and you thought my how did they ever get
[1:20:35] to that place? Look, I I'm telling you
[1:20:37] uh Satan's out there like a roaring
[1:20:39] lion. He he wants to tear up homes and
[1:20:41] tear up marriages and tear up churches.
[1:20:46] And then if you have your life right and
[1:20:48] you are serving God and you're filled
[1:20:49] with the Holy Ghost and you're doing
[1:20:51] what the word says to do and you're
[1:20:52] walking with the Lord, you still go
[1:20:54] through hard times,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; heartache and brokenness and and you you
[1:21:01] you might not understand what's going
[1:21:02] on. Look, that's the time and seasons
[1:21:04] that we go through.
[1:21:09] But as we read, though I walk through
[1:21:12] the valley
[1:21:14] of the shadow of death,
[1:21:17] I will fear no evil, for thou art with
[1:21:20] me. Maybe this is simple tonight.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; But somebody needs to know that he's
[1:21:27] with you. Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to know that in your
[1:21:31] trial
[1:21:34] and your heartache
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; and your brokenness,
[1:21:39] he's with you.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; And in that valley,
[1:21:44] there's light in the valley.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; I like this in Psalms 27. For in the
[1:21:52] time of trouble,
[1:21:54] if we've ever lived in troublesome
[1:21:56] times, for in the time of trouble, he
[1:21:59] shall hide me in his pavilion. In the
[1:22:01] secret place of his tabernacle shall he
[1:22:03] hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock.
[1:22:07] I I want to testify to you this evening
[1:22:09] that that's a real place for the
[1:22:11] believer, the rock of revelation. I want
[1:22:14] to tell you if if if if if the word of
[1:22:16] God and the Bible and listening to the
[1:22:18] message of the hour and the ministry and
[1:22:20] the five-fold and your pastor preach if
[1:22:22] if it's just kind of a set of rules and
[1:22:24] it's just kind of a better way to live.
[1:22:26] And I want to tell you there is a real
[1:22:27] revelation. There is a real change for
[1:22:30] the believer where it becomes a reality
[1:22:32] to you where it's just not rules and
[1:22:34] regulations and you trying to o obey a
[1:22:36] dress code. Look, if you're just trying
[1:22:38] to obey a dress code, that is not
[1:22:40] liberty. That is bondage.
[1:22:43] Now I you know I that that's good that
[1:22:45] you're trying but you can surrender to a
[1:22:47] greater power than that you have
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; because look if you're trying to
[1:22:51] manifest the message with your ability
[1:22:52] you will fail. If you're trying to be a
[1:22:54] good Christian with your ability you
[1:22:56] will fail. But if you come to the place
[1:22:57] where you die out knock stalk and barrel
[1:22:59] and say Lord I've tried it on my own and
[1:23:02] I can only be good so far but what I
[1:23:04] need is I need another power. I need the
[1:23:06] Holy Ghost and power to come and
[1:23:08] transform my life and make me a new. And
[1:23:10] then what happens? He comes inside of
[1:23:12] you and he starts living out the very
[1:23:14] word that you're hearing. It's no longer
[1:23:16] you that's living, but greater is he
[1:23:18] that is in me than he that is in the
[1:23:20] world. Greater is he that is in you than
[1:23:22] that cancer. Greater is he that is in
[1:23:24] you than that lust. Greater is he that
[1:23:26] is in you than that pornography. Greater
[1:23:28] is he that is in you. It's no longer you
[1:23:30] trying. It's no longer you wrestling.
[1:23:32] It's you in a total surrender to the
[1:23:34] Lord Jesus Christ. And now he's coming
[1:23:36] to your body. He's coming to your bones.
[1:23:38] And it's no longer you that's living,
[1:23:40] but it's Christ that's living in you.
[1:23:42] The message of the hour taken on flesh
[1:23:44] and your skin and your body. So then
[1:23:46] when that anxiety and that depression
[1:23:48] comes back, you can say, "Boo devil. I
[1:23:50] done died." And it's the Lord Jesus
[1:23:52] Christ that same yesterday, today, and
[1:23:54] forever. Shut up in my bones.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; It is not I that liveth, but Christ
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; that liveth in me.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because faith is a revelation.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said in the rapture, he
[1:24:13] said, "Faith is something that has been
[1:24:14] revealed to you
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; like it was to Abraham."
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; That could call anything contrary to
[1:24:21] what had been revealed to him as though
[1:24:22] it wasn't. So,
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; did you hear that?
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Faith, something that's been re revealed
[1:24:29] to you that you could call anything.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, that means faith has a voice.
[1:24:35] Huh?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Faith has a voice to call anything
[1:24:38] contrary to the word.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's your situation.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; It's a lie and vanity.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care if the doctors wrote it up
[1:24:48] and said, "You only got four months to
[1:24:49] live." I say, "Faith has a voice."
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah, the doctor might have a voice. My
[1:24:54] symptoms might have a voice, but faith
[1:24:57] also has a voice. And it's the word of
[1:24:59] God. And I will say what the word says.
[1:25:01] By his stripes, I am healed. I am
[1:25:05] predestinated. I am going in a rapture.
[1:25:08] I am the bride of Jesus Christ. I can do
[1:25:11] all things.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Faith. It's time we start speaking the
[1:25:15] word, church.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Faith has a voice.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Well, you might as well just call those
[1:25:22] things that are contrary to the word.
[1:25:25] Start speaking the word.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Tell that devil he's a liar.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Devil, you are a liar. I am the bride of
[1:25:33] Jesus Christ.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Devil, you're a liar. I am going in a
[1:25:36] rapture. Devil, you're a lie. I do got
[1:25:39] the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Well, you failed. You did this. You did
[1:25:42] that. Well, I'm going to say what the
[1:25:44] word says. Blessed is the man whom the
[1:25:46] Lord will not impute sin. Hallelujah.
[1:25:49] Because the seed of God remainth in me.
[1:25:51] A matter of fact, a vindicated prophet
[1:25:53] came and said, "You're justified. You
[1:25:55] never did it in the first place. You are
[1:25:58] perfect. I'm just going to keep saying
[1:25:59] what the word says, and I'll say it. You
[1:26:01] can point to my faults. You can point to
[1:26:03] my thirst. But I'm going to keep
[1:26:04] pointing to the word. I'll keep pointing
[1:26:06] to the word. I'll keep pointing to the
[1:26:08] word. And I want to tell you, one day,
[1:26:10] I'm going to be pointing to that word.
[1:26:11] And I'm going to be changed in a moment.
[1:26:13] In a twinkling of an eye, I'll be gone.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:21] Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread
[1:26:23] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[1:26:25] out of the mouth of God."
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; What are you living by?
[1:26:30] We'll work towards a close quickly.
[1:26:32] Jehovah and the prophet said to the
[1:26:34] royal seed called predestinated to
[1:26:36] eternal life. The royal seed of Abraham,
[1:26:38] they believe that word. I don't care
[1:26:41] what comes or goes, how much they laugh,
[1:26:44] who says this or that or the other.
[1:26:48] They are ordained to eternal life. And
[1:26:51] she goes right straight back. Her and
[1:26:52] her lover, Christ is one. The life, the
[1:26:55] spirit that's in Christ is in the
[1:26:56] church.
[1:26:59] Well, glory to God. I don't care what
[1:27:02] comes or goes.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad it gets or how easy
[1:27:07] it gets. You can laugh at me. You can
[1:27:10] make fun of me. But I like to say it
[1:27:11] like my prophet said, "Just leave me
[1:27:13] alone. I am happy this way."
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; I like how David says this. He says in
[1:27:20] Psalm 62
[1:27:22] and verse 6, he says, "He only is my
[1:27:25] rock
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; and my salvation.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; He is my defense.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; I shall not be moved.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; In God is my salvation and my glory.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; The rock of my strength and my refuge is
[1:27:41] in God. Trust in him at all times, ye
[1:27:46] people. Pour out your heart before him.
[1:27:50] God is a refuge for us. Sah I want to
[1:27:54] tell you no matter the test, no matter
[1:27:56] the trial, no matter what I'm going for,
[1:27:59] God is my refuge. And I am going to pour
[1:28:02] out my heart. I choose to worship. I
[1:28:06] choose to praise in the valley, on the
[1:28:09] mountaintop, in the good times, in the
[1:28:12] bad times. I don't care how bad it gets.
[1:28:14] I'm going to pour out my heart. I'm
[1:28:16] going to give him praise. Why? Because
[1:28:18] there's light in the valley. I don't
[1:28:21] care how dark it gets. I don't care how
[1:28:23] rough the road is. I will give him
[1:28:25] praise.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, he shall set you up upon a rock
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; of revelation.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Yet a little
[1:28:38] while, and the world seeth me no more,
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; but ye see me, because I live, ye live
[1:28:44] also.
[1:28:46] At that day ye shall know that I am in
[1:28:48] the father and the father in me and I in
[1:28:51] you. When is that? That's this day
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; when the revelation comes forth. When
[1:28:58] the word is opened up and the word comes
[1:29:00] an invisible union. Now it's it's I and
[1:29:03] you and you and me.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; I'll just invite the musicians to come.
[1:29:07] We'll try to work quickly to a close
[1:29:09] because I I I believe God's speaking to
[1:29:12] somebody right now. Prophet
[1:29:17] of God said the power of revelation
[1:29:19] brings stimulation to the believer.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; He said there is a power of revelation
[1:29:25] of the word
[1:29:26] gives stimulation of joy to the
[1:29:28] believer. Stimulation of satisfaction.
[1:29:31] The stimulation that it's vindicated and
[1:29:33] proved. Look, if you go through the
[1:29:34] testing times, if you're just always
[1:29:36] going through a cycle of revival and
[1:29:38] death,
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you for fighting. God bless
[1:29:41] you for trying. But I want to tell you
[1:29:43] young people and old alike, you can end
[1:29:46] the cycle of revival and death right
[1:29:48] now. God has an eternal prescription and
[1:29:51] it's never changed. Repent of your sins
[1:29:53] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:29:55] Jesus Christ and you shall be filled
[1:29:57] with the Holy Ghost. Look, I want to
[1:29:59] tell you it works. Just take this. It
[1:30:02] works. It's the eternal prescription.
[1:30:04] Quit trying to live off of secondhand
[1:30:07] revelation. Quit trying to do it on your
[1:30:09] own. There is an oldfashioned altar.
[1:30:11] There is still the oldfashioned Holy
[1:30:13] Ghost and fire that can come and change
[1:30:15] you and set your soul on fire. And it's
[1:30:18] no longer you trying to live the
[1:30:19] message. It is Christ in you living out
[1:30:22] the message. Oh, my Bible says if that
[1:30:25] same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ
[1:30:28] dwell in you, it will quicken your
[1:30:30] mortal body. I'm not just looking for a
[1:30:32] quickening to come, but I'm also being
[1:30:34] quickened right now. Day by day, he's
[1:30:37] quickening my thoughts. He's quickening
[1:30:39] my actions. He's quickening my mind.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Maybe we can sing that song. Speak to
[1:30:46] the mountain.
[1:30:50] I want to say whatever's trying to
[1:30:52] discourage you,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; make you doubt,
[1:30:57] rob you.
[1:31:00] I say hit it with the word.
[1:31:06] Heavens and earth will pass away but his
[1:31:09] word will never pass away.
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:12] Do we know that song speak to the
[1:31:14] mountain?
[1:31:16] Uh why should I worry you?
[1:31:23] [Music]
[1:31:25] Whatever is trying to discourage you, I
[1:31:27] say let's take sides with the word.
[1:31:31] He said, "I won't leave you."
[1:31:34] And somebody, you've been questioning if
[1:31:36] he's with you.
[1:31:37] [Music]
[1:31:39] You've been wondering, "Lord, where have
[1:31:41] you been? I've been going through a hard
[1:31:42] time. The devil says you're not going to
[1:31:45] make it." What do you do? Hit him with
[1:31:48] the word.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't let the devil rob you.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil shut you up and back
[1:31:57] you up into a corner.
[1:32:00] Don't listen to his lies
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; telling you, "Look, you failed again."
[1:32:04] And see, that just shows you ain't got
[1:32:06] it.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Look, everybody else is, you know,
[1:32:08] everybody else does this and that and
[1:32:10] they rejoice. But you you you be you.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, if you're a son
[1:32:15] and daughter of God, you got a right to
[1:32:17] the message of the hour.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; You got a right to the word of God. And
[1:32:20] you got a right to every promise. You
[1:32:22] say, "Devil, I am sick and tired of
[1:32:25] listening to you boast." The children of
[1:32:27] Israel, they listened to Goliath boast
[1:32:30] for how many days? But the prophet of
[1:32:32] God said Goliath one mistake. Was his
[1:32:34] boast ended up falling on the ears of
[1:32:37] David. And I say we are of the same
[1:32:40] faith seed. I say devil, your boast has
[1:32:42] fallen on the wrong ears tonight. I'm
[1:32:45] going to fight for the bride of Jesus
[1:32:46] Christ. You back up. I'm going to fight
[1:32:49] for every single one of them to be
[1:32:50] delivered, to be healed, to be filled
[1:32:53] with the Holy Ghost. You are not alone.
[1:32:55] God is with you.
[1:32:57] You can be healed by his stripes. You're
[1:33:00] already healed. You can receive the Holy
[1:33:03] Ghost.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; I say, if he don't move, what do you do?
[1:33:09] Hit him with the word.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And if he don't move, hit him again. I
[1:33:14] say as we sing this song, I say some
[1:33:17] people with faith, why don't you start
[1:33:18] hitting that old devil?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; May maybe you maybe you know a brother
[1:33:22] or sister that's having a hard time. I
[1:33:24] said, "Let's bind our faith together. I
[1:33:26] want to see God move amongst us. I I
[1:33:28] want to see somebody healed. I want to
[1:33:29] see somebody delivered." Look, tomorrow
[1:33:32] may never come, Brother Joe.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; You might not make it to Thursday.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; I want to say, "What happens if this is
[1:33:41] our last moment on this side
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; to praise him?"
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Could be.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; What happens if this is the last time? I
[1:33:52] don't know.
[1:33:54] But it makes me start thinking, Lord, I
[1:33:57] want to play my part.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; And if that devil's running his mouth,
[1:34:00] hit him with the word.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; I am sanctified. I am filled with the
[1:34:04] Holy Ghost. My son will be saved. My
[1:34:07] daughter will be saved. You start
[1:34:08] claiming your prodals. You start
[1:34:10] claiming, I say, you take the word of
[1:34:12] God. You hit him with the word. The
[1:34:14] prophet of God said, "And if you whack
[1:34:15] him the first time, it don't seem to
[1:34:17] move. Whack it again and whack it again
[1:34:19] and whack it again and whack it until
[1:34:20] you chip the hole through like a little
[1:34:22] chicken peeping itself out. But you're
[1:34:24] an eagle what you are. Peep yourself
[1:34:26] right up through that old shell of
[1:34:27] sickness. Cut your way out and say,
[1:34:29] "Hallelujah. Where's the next one?" Hey,
[1:34:32] I believe somebody here is going to get
[1:34:33] so filled with the Holy Ghost and all
[1:34:35] them demons and all them giants that
[1:34:37] have been fighting you, you're going to
[1:34:38] cut his head off and you're going to
[1:34:40] say, "Hey, where's the next one?" I
[1:34:43] think it's time to start fighting for
[1:34:45] our brothers. It's time to start
[1:34:46] fighting for our sisters. Hey devil, I'm
[1:34:49] going to beat you right out of the back
[1:34:50] of the church. There ain't no place for
[1:34:52] that demon of doubt. Get out of here,
[1:34:54] devil.
[1:34:56] Hallelujah.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Well, why should I worry when giants
[1:35:03] come calling my name?
[1:35:09] Oh my God. So much
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; in the troubles.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; And why would I hunger for power or
[1:35:24] riches or fame?
[1:35:28] Oh
[1:35:30] my. My God is so much better than all of
[1:35:34] these things.
[1:35:38] And I won't be shen.
[1:35:41] [Applause]
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:47] And my God is faithful.
[1:35:52] His promise is true.
[1:35:57] So I'll speak to the mountain.
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:03] It's high.
[1:36:07] Oh my God is bigger, better,
[1:36:12] greater than you.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And my enemies scatter cuz they know the
[1:36:22] battle is done.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; You see, my God is stronger. The victory
[1:36:31] already won.
[1:36:36] And he died for my race and rose up on
[1:36:41] the third day.
[1:36:44] [Applause]
[1:36:46] Oh my God is greater than death.
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:55] I won't be shen.
[1:36:59] Oh, I will be
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; and my God is faithful.
[1:37:09] His promise is true.
[1:37:13] So I'll speak to the mountain.

[1:37:23] my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:37:28] gater you

[1:37:47] promise is true.
[1:37:51] So I'll speak to the mountain.
[1:37:57] Oh, it's time to move.

[1:38:30] presence.
[1:38:33] I speak Jesus.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I just want to speak the name of
[1:38:45] Jesus.
[1:38:49] Every
[1:38:51] day starts to break.

[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Hey, why don't you just worship him now?
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; I say, why don't you let God deal with
[1:39:21] your heart?
[1:39:23] Just take a moment.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; I say there's liberty in his presence.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; I speak Jesus.

[1:39:35] to pray with you.
