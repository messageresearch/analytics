word may your spirit be free to move among us lord to follow the word to bring it to pass we pray in jesus name amen amen let's turn to john chapter 14 and verse 1. amen i'm going to read a few verses here down there we're going to be down to verse 27. it says let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me for in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know in the way you know thomas said on him lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me he said if you had known me you would know my father also from henceforth you know him and have seen him and philip sayeth unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us and jesus saith unto them have i been so long time with you and yet hast shall not know me philip he that has seen me has seen the father how saith thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am the father and the father and to me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son and if you ask anything in my name i'll do it if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray to the father he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth in the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you now know you know him and he for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless but i will come to you yet a little while in the world saith me no more but you shall see me because i live ye shall live also and that day you shall know that i am of my in my father and ye and me and i and you and he that hath my commandments and keepeth them is he that he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him judas saith unto him not iscariot lord is it how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not into the world jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the father which sent me these things have i spoken to you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid amen we can let you be seated this evening so i want to speak to you on a been on this thought of light for a few months now but i just want to continue on that but i'd like to speak to you on the most precious light the most precious light i was looking at these words and you know twice in the scripture reading at the very beginning he would say it and again here in verse 27 he would say it again let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid this trouble is to agitate or to cause one inward commotion it's to take away his calmness of mine to disquieten him to make him restless to stir one up to str to trouble to strike one's spirit with fear and dread to render him anxious or distressed to perplex the mind of one by suggesting scruples or doubts and that's what the trouble that we're looking at tonight and i i believe that is very fitting for the time that we're living here uh there's a lot of inward commotion there's a lot of fear that is arising upon the land and there's a lot of restlessness and anxiousness and worry and perplexities of mind not knowing you know what's going to happen how it's going to be but he said let not your heart be troubled and and how could why and in making that statement he said because i go to prepare a place for you and that's why our heart can be at peace in this time of of trouble in this time of perplexity that this we know that this world is not our home but we have a place prepared to go and you know and then speaking of this he said he would say twice again and he would begin to speak about the comforter that he would sin and this comforter is someone that's summoned or called to be at one side it's called to be one's aide one who pleads in others calls before a judge or or a counsel for defense a legal assistant an advocate it's one who pleads as an intercessor so of christ as he would plead for us and pardon pleading with god for the pardoning of our sins in other words it's a helper aider assistant so the holy spirit is destined to take the place of christ in the apostles because he could not come in you as a man he had to come in you as a spirit amen so he would come to lead them amen into deeper knowledge of the truth to give them divine strength to hold them and enable them to undergo great trials and great persecutions on the behalf of his kingdom now i i got to looking at this thought on the most precious light and it came from a little statement that i saw said the most precious light is the one that comes in your darkest hour when you're in your darkest moment and your darkest time that's when life light is very precious to you you go through a desert water becomes very precious to you you might be at a place that you can have water at your fingertips right now and go to your sink and get water you can go uh to your refrigerator and pull up a bottle of water i mean why even right here i have water here available for me but you get into a desert you get into a place where there is no water one little drop becomes very precious to you and we find that in the in the darkness the darker it gets the more precious light is and we know that we have a precious light in this hour is the truth the revealed word of god amen not some man's theology not some man's ideas or man's creeds or dominance that he's dreamed up in some headquarters somewhere amen but it is the mind of god that has been revealed in our generation and it's a precious light and the darker it gets the more precious this light will be amen the darker it gets and the more anxiety comes the more fear comes the more precious the word of god is going to become to you because you can see as as the world is in turmoil in the world is in all kind of trouble and the world is all kind of fear i don't forget i was just looking up things that have happened since you know 2020 when covet hit how the explosion of anxiety has taken place the explosion of fear and the explosion of worry and the explosion of all those kind of things but in the middle of all of that you can still be at peace amen because we're not depending on if the world is at peace we're dependent on his kingdom amen because this world is not our kingdom so our peace is not depending upon whether the world is at peace or whether governments are at peace or whether things are working out all right that's not what our peace is based upon our peace is based upon i have gone to prepare you a place and if it was not so i would have told you but it is so therefore he told you i have a place prepared for you amen and so in the moment of darkness in the moment of great darkness and that's where we're at as is getting darker and darker and more evil and more evil all the time amen light is becoming more and more precious it's becoming more and more amen you right now you might go over there and you might flip a light switch anywhere in this building the light come on or at your home amen but you know how it is when you when your lights go out how precious light is to you there you don't think about it any time when you walk in a bedroom and just flip a light switch but how many times have you went into your dark bedroom the lights be out and you hit that switch and nothing happens it's because of something that's precious to you want to see or what you're going through you want to see where you're at and darkness is coming upon this earth and and i'm thankful that we have something to see by and we can see where we are we can see where we're going amen we're not blind as the blind leading the blind but we have eyes that can see we have a word that has illuminated our path and we can see where we're going we can see the things that are around us and all the things that are happening people are getting stirred up by russia all that they're doing that's only a pawn in the hand of god and they're only doing what god allows kingdoms are only doing what god allows him to do and you can see it written in the word therefore we don't have to get all tore up about it we don't have to get all disquiet and our emotions tore up about things that are going on because our emotions is not tied to fox news our emotions ain't good one day because the news is good but a matter of fact if you went by that your emotions would never be good because there's no good news out there in this world but there is some good news here tonight and we can stand upon the word of god and we can stand firmly we can stand at peace we can be at peace in our darkest hour because there is a light that is shining you know brother brandon would tell the story about carlsbad canyon or cavern and he talked about a man and a wife and a bunch of children that went there and they got down on the bottom of it and they turned the lights out and he said it was midnight dark down in there and he said they turned all the lights he said maya you could put your hand in front of your face and you couldn't see nothing have you ever ever experienced that i've been there in czech republic in a place like that he said there there was a little girl that was standing there and she began screaming oh help help screaming she was scared to death because it was so dark now in that moment light became very precious to her light became something that was more important than eminem's more important than a starburst more important than mcdonald's down the street she wanted light more than anything so she could see who was around the support thing began to grab and begin to scream begin to holler for a papa and mama and everything amen because she couldn't stand it it was so dark she had never seen such darkness and this is where you're seeing people at today the lights are going out and they're beginning to scream as we we could read about the ten virgins five wise and five fur foolish what was very important during that time it was light it was the oil the lamp to be burning amen it was a light to be burning amen this is where people are at they're finding themselves lost in darkness they don't know which way to go they don't know what to believe they don't know to believe this one or that one or the other but there is a truth amen there is a true genuine light that'll shine on every verse it'll shine on every scripture amen you don't have to take your bible and tear it halfway out because you don't believe it but there is a light of god that'll shine and make it illuminate every verse every scripture every line every book every promise hallelujah that's the way it is it got so dark he said that's the way it is today it's getting so dark you don't know where to go the little girl standing there she was screaming at the top of her voice about to get hysterical about that he said it's about like the little bride her little brother cried out in that very moment her brother spoke up and said little sister don't fear maybe i can say that for you tonight little sister don't fear because he's standing right by the engineer he was right there and he saw the man as he saw what was taking place he said don't fear there is a man here who can turn on the light [Applause] don't fear little sister there's a man here who can turn on the light he can make the word live he can make the word be manifest there is somebody here amen there might not be it might not be according to what you think or how you think is going to take place but there is somebody here who knows how to turn on the lights amen he said he's we don't know how we don't know how it's going to be we don't know when he's going to turn it on how but he's coming we don't know how he's coming but he's coming we don't know when he's coming but he's coming he said i don't know nothing about that but i know he is here and he can turn on the lights he is here he's the one who can turn on the lights he's the one he is the light he just makes himself known and that's how he turns on the light it takes christ to flash on his lights i'm going to have another microphone brother it takes christ to shine out it takes christ to flash on his lights that all the darkness scatters hallelujah all the darkness scatters it separates it and he is in this moment of darkness he is pulling his little bride out i'll take a people out of the gentiles for my name say they'll have my name they'll have my name not the name of baptist not the name of methodist not the name of lutherans but the name of jesus christ for he is the light he is the truth he is the way and in him there's no darkness at all and he scatters the darkness when he comes in because he is the word bear with me for a minute the word is light because when he spoke it in the beginning he said let there be light that was the word that become light and when he speaks it the light of this age it'll light up he is the vindicated word he is absolutely the light in the time of darkness all these false glares and everything else is going to fade away yes sir he's here don't fear he will turn on the lights there is a man presence hallelujah i'm not talking about this man here or these men here or anybody else in this building and then i'm talking about there is a man his name is jesus christ and he is present we just heard him speak at the other wednesday night he's never left us he is in the midst of her and he's moving and he's orchestrated and he's making things happen and he's making things come to pass because he is present he's a never failing presence he's always there and he can always turn on the light he's just waiting to see what you're going to do are you going to scream out in fear or are you going to scream out in faith hallelujah he can he listen to this he said he's seeing what you're going to do he can flip the switch anytime he wants to so if you're sick tonight he can flip the switch anytime he wants to if you're depressed tonight he can flip the switch anytime he wants to if you're down in your delusion and you don't know where to turn to and you're full of fear and anxiety he can flip the switch hallelujah what does that do it turns the tide on the devil because in darkness devil hides in darkness he is there but when the light comes on it exposes him for who he is hallelujah i want to look at matthew 4 and 13 and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the seacoast and the borders of zebulon and nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaias the prophet isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebulon and the land of nephilim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death light is sprung up i got to looking into this while seeing why this prophecy was given over zebulon and naftali and actually if you look where they're at they're one of the outward lying areas in israel and they're closer to the gentiles and closer to attack and closer to being bombarded and closer to being invaded and you know not only that they're further away from the center of worship they're farther away from the movement of the spirit of god they're further away from the things but listen god don't always he won't leave you there if you're one of his children you may be sitting in darkness you may be sitting in disillusion you may not know which way is up and which way is down but those that sat in darkness they saw a great light because the light of god that came two thousand years ago born in a virgin walk down their street and begin to do miracles among them and signs and wonders happen and they begin to realize there's a light there's a god there's a man here who's more than a man hallelujah there is a man here that can turn on the lights amen those who sat in the regions of the shadow of death some of them under cancer hallelujah some of them under the death of denomination some under their creeds of death some on untraditional death all kinds of death but they saw a great light hallelujah a man that flashed the lights on is the same one that said let there be light and he's the same yesterday today and forever he can still turn on the lights don't get scared hallelujah you say well what about this out there don't get scared what about this trouble over here don't get scared what about all of this over here don't get scared he's the same god when persecution comes don't get scared there is a light he said he's going to catch his people away listen to this she'll not go through the tribulation she'll never do it he said she wouldn't she'll be caught away how's they gonna do that brother branham looks awful dark no matter how dark it is you two you can't see your hand before you just remember there's a man who can flip the switch and rapture the church [Music] hallelujah tomorrow might be your darkest day but don't you ever forget it could be the same day that the flip the light the switches flip and you step out of this whole mortality into immortality you step out of that old ragged body into a new body you step out of that depression into happiness you step out of cancer into healing you step out of backslidden condition to being on fire for god he knows how to flip the switch i say god tonight flip the switch there's some depressed here tonight flip the switch there's those that's got fear and anxiety in their life flip the switch there's backslidden about it flip the switch don't get away there is a man [Applause] this man stays with us no matter if it's dark notice the engineer didn't leave the building he said where's that at psalms 42 8 by day the lord directs his love at night his song is with me hallelujah he will light our past through darkness you're in second samuel 22 and verse 29 you lord are my lamp the lord turns my darkness into light and psalms 91 5 and 6 says you will not fear the terror of night nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness hallelujah the pestilence that stalks is what they walketh in darkness stalks in the darkness he says a roaring lion stalking seeing me who who he made of fire same bed trying to see who he's going to destroy who he's going to pull away but there's an angel of god that encamps about those that fear him and that angel has the power over the light and over the darkness hallelujah amen and he would say again in john 16 33 in this world you have trouble but take heart i have overcome the world so the darkness you're dealing with i've already overcome it the darkness that you're facing i've already faced it amen i want to give you some hope today you might have walked in here depressed jesus has already faced depression he's already faced fears he's already faced anxieties he's already faced worries and doubts he's already faced complexes you don't think he had complex as sure he did he was human and he was telling him all the time he was born in an out of an adultery such an adulterous situation he had to face those complexes he had to face those lies he had to face all of those things he's already done it let's look at second corinthians four i'm going to read out the amplified but this precious treasure this light and power that does now shine within us is held in a perishable container that is in our weak bodies everyone can see that the glorious power we're in must be from god and is not our own hallelujah that's why the light that's in you hasn't went out because it's not your light it's the light that has been burning since the beginning of time amen when there wasn't even a world that light of eternity is what has been deposited in those who's got the holy ghost therefore the devil can blow at it he can push at it he can come try to put it out he can do everything he can and he just keeps on cancer comes [Music] problems in the family comes situation in the church comes hallelujah that why you say well how about that you know it only burns on those that don't have no trouble it's those people that gets up and shout they don't ever have no trouble he says we are oppressed on every side by troubles but not crushed and broken we are perplexed because we don't know why things happen as they do but we will not give up and quit [Applause] hallelujah man and we are hunted down but god will not abund abandon us we get knocked down but we get up and go again these bodies or our of ours are constantly facing death just as jesus did so it is clear to all that it's the only it's only the living christ within us who keeps us alive amen i might have to read all that again because that would i got to have it oh i got to have it one more time but this precious treasure this light and power that now shines within us is held in perishable containers that is in our weak bodies everyone can see that the glorious power we're in must be from god and it's not our own because we are pressed on every side by troubles but we are not crushed and broken we are perplexed because we don't know why things happen as they do but we will not give up and quit we are hunted down but god has never abandoned us we get knocked down but we're gonna get up and go again these bodies or ours are constantly facing death but the god of heaven is the one who keeps us safe hallelujah that's what you need to tell that devil i might be perplexed i might know where to turn to i know i may not know which way is up and which way is down but i'm not giving up i'm not turning around i'm going to press with everything i've got into the kingdom of god is there anybody here that feels the same way i mean he's been through trials i mean he's been through torments i mean he's been through anxieties and fears but i'm not giving up i'm not quitting i'm not turning around matter of fact i don't have quit in me i have the sea gene of god and it's going to press through and it's going to press through until it takes his body into a body change come on somebody hallelujah you realize it's not me that's doing it it's christ in me the hope of glory i want to ask you young people how in the world are you still standing in the darkest of times pornography at your fingertips and it seems like sin on every street corner and every phone and everything every device it's all around you but that life's still burning that light's still pulsating that light's still giving out it's still moving it's still having something of some effect it's in the darkest hour is the most precious light so god would put the most precious in the darkest do you hear that i ain't nobody you're most precious he's waited 2000 years and it's got as dark as it's ever going to get and getting darker but yet all down through midden over to bosu louisiana texas all over the united states all over the world there's these little lights and he's looking let me tell you what he's doing god is looking over the banister as he did for those three hebrew children and he's looking down look at that precious look at that precious light you're precious in his eyes you think sometimes god doesn't care about you god cares everything about you you get in those kind of situations it's in dark times you think people don't care people don't understand people don't want to know me about darkness there's many of them through the scriptures they came to that moment very familiar but we know the family of lazarus came to that moment came to a very dark time in their life they call for jesus their brother's sick and their friend the one they're claiming to be the messiah goes the opposite direction could you imagine the post that was going to be on facebook if it was today i just gotta rant tell somebody no you don't don't have to tell nobody tell jesus amen when jesus came along that in that dark hour he said he comes he said that's him it's in the dark moment that the light is precious he lets it happen that way the darkest of hour then jesus comes along why because his presence always brings hope that's why it's very important to fight for the presence of god to be free in a service we want a service with hope amen amen the darkest hour his presence always brings new hope he said it may be the darkest hour for some tonight the doctor has given you up with cancer the man has done all he can to save you your life but it's beyond his knowledge it's beyond his reach he has no more to work with he's done all he can do you're going to die it might be the darkest hour you ever seen but remember it's in the moments when he's there to flip the switch that's when he comes to bring new hope it brings new hopes when he comes his presence always brings hope martha you know she she had seen enough out of jesus to know he was god's representative that day but they watch him as he walks away and he travels further and further and further and they watching on the other hand his brother brother going down down down down until he takes his last breath and they go have a funeral and one day jesus still ain't there two days three days four days martha hears he's coming and she goes out to meet him you know brother brother said should have had a right to say something maybe why didn't you come why why we sent for you we left our own churches we left everything and then we get in this situation we've done all of this look what we've done he said that's a lot of people's attitude look what i've done look what i've given up he said it ain't about what you've done it's what he's already done for you matter of fact all you ever done you're still unworthy but she didn't do that she ran to him and she began to move out there and said you know he if i'd have been here my brother would not have died but even now lord even now that no matter how bad the situation is you know even now yes lord he said well thy brother will rise again yeah lord at the last day of the general resurrection he's a good boy he served you he said i am the resurrection and the life he was wanting to bring her to right now amen after turned her down how could a man that's a resurrection life ever treat a friend like that that's a good question sometimes he's just testing you to see what you're going to do to see how you're going to react to see how what's going to happen what's going to really come out of you because you know we can put on all kind of facades especially in a good happy moment things are going good and we're jumping and shouting and having a good time and we're just hallelujah glory to god but all of a sudden we have a bad day and we sit and we want to make sure everybody knows we had a bad day it ain't nothing about wrong you don't have bad days you don't have to let everybody know you had a bad day amen you know you got to put your heart into it no matter what you want something from god you got to put everything you got into it amen come to even now lord amen you can come tonight and say well i've done this i've had this i've had that i'm i don't know how am i going to get it even now lord even right now in my bad day you can come and minister to me you can come and meet me put the thing before you sometimes he does to see just what you're going to do with it he might do that he's been doing it just to see what you'll do about it we find out that when this was done she said i believe you are the son of god that was coming to the world that's exactly what he had confessed and even now though my brother is dead though he's embalmed though he's buried though he's stinking in the grave even now whatsoever he asks god god to give it to you there you are that's the keynote she believed in what he said she believed in what he asked even though it was dark around her this light that stood before her was very precious this moment with him was very precious this time with him was very precious it was the difference between life and death you say well the doctor turned me down and said he couldn't do no more even now i haven't walked for years even now i haven't moved in years even now amen even now he's there sitting on the right hand of god making new sessions upon your confession even now i mean if you ask you shall receive even now no wonder he said thy brother shall rise again he said i am the resurrection life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet he shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this and she said lord yeah i believe it now he said notice when he spoke and she responded in that matter he said what was it you have real faith and your faith goes to that word cogs go together and the will starts to turn something is going to take place something is going to happen because faith has responded to the word the word was precious and faith went out and said i believe what you said i believe you can do it even now i believe you're the same yesterday i believe it with all my heart even now you know to make a light happen it takes two coming together can't just come off a one it takes two it takes a ground and a positive it takes two are neutral and a positive it takes two coming together to make light and if they come together the dynamos together it'll make light it'll make faith it'll make power it'll make healing it'll make whatever the promises of god come to pass because it becomes in line the only thing you have to do to get electricity is push the button that's all you have to do when the scripture is supposed to be fulfilled now press the button don't be afraid hallelujah that's what's the matter with people he said i've seen two classes of people one who has money in the bank but they don't know how to write a check one that has a check but they don't have no they know how to write a check but they don't have no money in the bank that don't ever do you any good one or the other you can have all the money in the world and you don't know how to write out a check or you have nothing to know how to write a check you can write them all you want to they'll bounce as high as a ceiling but if you can ever get that together and he said i believe there's a people that's got that together not only has the ability to write the check but also has the ability amen the money in the bank ask anything in my father's name it'll happen she had heard him and she said he's right i am the resurrection life i believe with all my heart even when all hope was gone she wasn't saying this when it looked like something good was about to happen she didn't know what was about to happen this word was coming out of her before she ever saw one move of lazarus body before she ever saw anything happen at that tomb words were already coming out of her mouth i believe it i believe it and that's the way you got to be many times we like to wait till we see a symptom go down or so you know something happen or a rock move or something's going on amen then we say oh i believe it i know you got to start saying it with your mouth you got to start speaking it you got to start confessing it and saying i know it's true and i know he's true and i know his word is true i know he won't let it fall to the ground what he said will come to pass and i'm going to ask him i'm going to push the button even now lord in that dark hour resurrection life took place job he got pretty where he was gotten a pretty dark spot i don't i doubt anybody's pretty well where job was or ever was he was a righteous man come up to god and said you know he said god said you consider my servant job he said well i mean you got a hedge around him you got all you got a fence built up i can't even get to him look at all he's got no wonder he praises you no wonder why he comes on a wednesday night and his hands are up no wonder why he said well i'll take that back he said well if you do i'll make him curse you he said you do it he said do it all but don't take his life he said but you'll never make him curse me god knows how who to trust hallelujah job got in all kinds of trouble he lost all of his wealth he lost all of his pop popularity he was a prince and the heist a young prince used to come about but other princes used to come bow before him as a great man of wisdom he was known as a prophet everyone wanted to see him everyone wanted to talk to him he was everybody's friend he was everybody's confident he had confidant he could you know walk down the street and people would call him by name wise men would come and say job sir we know that great god of heaven is with you we know god's blessings on you we can see it all and then all of a sudden it switched he lost his children he lost his wealth he lost his home he lost everything amen until he came to a part in his life he's sitting on an ash heap scraping balls darkness was all around him and closing in on him but job just stayed right with it brother reynolds said he said he didn't move away because he knew i had offered a sacrifice i had done all that god had provide required therefore i'd done it and god it was up to god to bring it to pass but he finds himself in that situation and even to where his wife turns against him and job said job you're miserable why don't you just curse god and die the death look what he said he didn't call her a foolish woman he said thou speak is like a foolish woman in other words you speak foolish the lord gave and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord you know listen to that i thought this was a very wonderful wonderful lesson right he said he knew he had influenced people he knew his life had been useful he said see god never gives us our life just to hang around and we do this and we do that he give it to be useful to him do something tell somebody if you can't talk whistle him do something for him do something that god knows your life is fulfilling his purpose and job began to look at the flowers and how they die and there's a resurrection the tree it goes down and out of its roots burst up new trees and he said but a man layeth down and he giveth up the ghost and he's his sons come to honor him and then he's just as dust and he's gone what about this he couldn't understand it how could a man have much that was much more glorious than a flower much more glorious than a tree built in the very image of god yet he's planted in the ground and that settled it he's getting darker he's questioning more he's wondering more what about this what about that what about this when all this distress comes all of his friends turned their back on him accused him of being a secret sinner his wife turned away from him the bible said his breath was strange to his wife all the things that happened to him looked like god had turned him completely down but then all one in another chapter god comes and speaks to him says job i want you to gird up your loins i have to i'm going to have a talk with you you see the tree never sin the flower never sin it served my purpose there was dramatized one to another it didn't sin so it arise up again but as man sin therefore he's cut off and job began to wonder all these things distresses and the darkest hour but all of a sudden god began to speak to him and begin to show him but man's hope is not out he might be cut off but i want you to look past the grave joke i want you to look past the trouble job i want you to look past the darkness and god took him up to a place to where he could look thousands of years down the road and he could see a man called jesus bear his old sins up to a cross and he said i shall know him my redeemer liveth though these skin won't destroy my body yet in my flesh i shall see god it was in his darkest moments god revealed himself to him he began to look up in this vision he's caught up in lightnings and thunders and he's seen him in the last days i know my redeemer liveth in the last days he'll stand upon this earth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god the darkest hour was when god could show him the last days we got tons of others moses pretty got pretty dark on moses he tried and killed an egyptian ran out got on the backside of a desert away from god thousand miles a million miles away but all of a sudden in that dark hour he saw a light and it goes to that light and we know the scriptures and i'm not going to go through all of these very very deeply but he finds himself and it so changes his thinking to where he's not not even thinking like a normal man thought anymore in that dark moment he saw a light and that light spoke out of him and began to reveal who he truly was and what that light became very precious to moses because he had been in a lot of darkness he had no doubt had all kind of complexes and things he had been fighting for 40 years why didn't this i i thought it was going to be this way why didn't it be this how how was all how is how is god going to do it how is he going how in the world i tried i tried to take it i tried to and all i did was kill some of my own brothers turned against me and here i'm out i ain't heard from god in 40 years all of a sudden he looks and there's a light that light was precious enough to him that he walked up there to see what it was all about hello somebody and if i understand correctly the scriptures bear with me if i'm wrong but the scripture talks about gathering together even the much more you see that day approaching why because he said where two or three are gathered i'll be there so you got to get to where the light is more precious to you than the darkness because if the darkness is more precious you'll stay home maybe i'm talking to somebody streaming right now you'll stay home as i got no you're staying home because there's darkness but if the light will come become more precious you'll leave those babbling sheep and old things around you and your work and everything you've got to gather to the light amen god has a way of forcing the issue sometimes to make you come face to face with the light you know jairus in the bible he came to that moment he tried to divert away from me tried to out still be on the outskirts he tried to you know try to sidestep the issue tried to but all of a sudden his little girl got sick and something became very precious to him light becomes very precious than darkness well you can have the you can have money in the bank and you can have everything going your way and all of a sudden things begin to turn and all of a sudden you realize man the house of god is precious to me i i it didn't take me very many services to realize how pressure it was to me and covet that sealed the deal it was precious to me to come together with the children of god it was precious to me to hear the word of god come service after service and the spirit of god move and me be free that's precious to me it's precious to me to sit in his presence and bask in the glow of the holy ghost it's precious to me to be in that atmosphere i think about it men will pay thousands and thousands of dollars to get a courtside seat to watch a man run up and down a court or watch something happen or pay thousand thousand dollars to go kill a big trophy amen but what should be precious to us is this life amen their jobs become more precious all kinds of things around i didn't expect it to go here but we're going amen things become more precious but this is the most precious thing you'll ever come in contact with amen you can stack the gold to the ceiling and out the door it'll never compare to what this word of god can do for you hallelujah man has been looking for the fountain of you he's so kingdom so look for the fountain of you he has sold everything he's burned boats he's tried to conquer all kinds of things countries and everything else killed people for the fountain of you but we have it tonight we have a fountain we there is a fountain open in the house of david it ought to be precious to us amen i think about even david himself how many drinks he used to take from bethlehem but one day he got away from it and there was a philistine army all the way around it and something began to cry out i want a drink that dream became very precious to him and let me tell you something if you find yourself in the tribulation you're going to wish this was precious you're going to waste the services that you stayed away from what's more precious to you listen this ain't me this is god crying out right now amen you're gonna wish that you'd have gave your all you're gonna wish i'd have gave everything to be there god i get you there somehow the darkest hour jairus was walking down he finds the lord jesus he said well you come pray for my daughter takes him begins to walk down the road towards his house just as hard as he can go so please lay your hands on my child come lay your hands and she'll live now this light was more precious than his sect of pharisees and things that he had held on to for thou all of his lifetime traditions of men he found something more precious and he's willing to do whatever it took to get to him because it was dark he was in a dark time of his life and his baby was dying i got to get to jesus maybe that wasn't a thought three days with prior maybe he even said a few scornful things i don't know mocked him made fun of him but all of a sudden his daughter gets sick he's like i got to get to jesus so something flipped something changed to where he didn't no longer care what the pharisees thought about him he didn't no longer care what his family thought about him he didn't no longer care what anybody thought about him i got to get to jesus listen god knows how to get you to that spot amen he finds himself in that place and then he starts walking towards his road with his child with jesus and the news comes she's died it gets darker and i said i can see jesus look at him did i not tell you fear not you'll see the glory of the lord i imagine his heart went to beating right right back went up the road oh she's dead she's asleep and jesus said she's not dead she's asleep and they begin to laugh and make fun we heard you were crazy now we know you are he said get get get get all the unbelievers out get them out i can't do nothing with you unbelievers sitting here put them all out and he walked over to the child and said rise up and the darkest hour death has struck the home jesus walked in and light came on hallelujah when his little girl was sick he didn't wait like nicodemus for a private interview his need was right then he had to get an action right then and the same is right now if there's ever a time you want to get healed right now is the time if there's ever a time you want to get saved right now is the time if there's ever a time you want the holy ghost right now is the time don't wait for another time right now is a time of action he got desperate and jesus came and he called her from the dead there was another man named zacchaeus he was in a real dark place his wife was even facing darkness even though she was a believer praying here zacchaeus had his own sect again of religion and businessman had the wealth of things and going on with rebecca's wife a believer in the lord jesus said he didn't believe it himself because the rabbi told him there's no more prophets wayne had prophets knows a bunch of nonsense don't you ever believe in nothing like that you're too fine cultured of a man to believe that your business just go about and do your business but you said you know rebecca had prayed don't ever give up on your prayers don't ever give up on your prayers he said she prayed until her little heart was about to break she wanted him to meet jesus and that morning zacchaeus decides you know what i'm gonna go up and see what this is all about he was a man of little stature about brother joe's height maybe a little shorter just couldn't see past most of the crowd so i'm gonna find out if he's truly a prophet or not i'm gonna see if he's just like any other man so he climbs up a tree and pulls some leaves around him so he passes by i'll see him and as jesus began to pass by walking down the street he got right under the tree right to the place right to the mark and he looks up and he says zacchaeus come down i'm going to your house oh may that be a service you can have tonight that jesus would come to your hiding spot where you've been hiding and you've been hiding behind complexes you've been hiding behind fears you've been hiding behind things in your life but tonight i'm coming to your house tonight i'm coming to where you are and i'm going to call you by your real name the devil's calling you fear the devil's calling you anxiety he's calling you depression he's calling you complexes but i'm calling you the bride of jesus christ and i'm going to your house it's a dark moment but it came by we get in dark spots we could talk about the woman at the with the blood issue and all that she had to press through the woman at the well and all she had to press through i want to end it on this one dark moment because we're on a ship it's called the ship of zion one night the disciples was on the sea all hope was gone maybe you're sitting there tonight in that same place on the boat seems like all hopes are gone boats water logged it's going down they were screaming and crying they'd went away without him they were scared they didn't know what to do and here he came walking on the sea do you understand that he uses the very thing that's trying to kill you to come to you the very thing that was trying to drown them he comes walking over it cancer to him is only a footpath situations in your life that's why you that's why you have them it's because he uses them to walk to you he uses them to come to where you're at so he can move and you might be in the darkness but all of a sudden you can look in the middle of that darkness and you see a light glow and it starts getting brighter and brighter and brighter as it's walking down the very thing the waves and the winds were trying to destroy them fear and anxiety and all kinds of things were happening that little boat was like a little bottle topper looked like nothing out there on let's see but all of a sudden here comes somebody walking on it man if i don't give you confidence tonight to know that no matter what trouble you have god can walk on it oh hallelujah did you feel that no matter what you're facing tonight god can walk on it i'll say it like this no matter what has your child bound tonight god can walk on it god will use it to get to where they are hallelujah and jesus is the same today as he ever was amen he's a man walking out there and they're in the waters they're screaming and they're hollering and then they see him and they're scared of him ain't that about like the church today amen they're crying and screaming and wanting god to move and wanting god to move and here he comes and they said eyes just a bunch of emotion that's just a bunch of work up this is a bunch of nonsense they scared the death of it but as i said last wednesday night we'll take her amen i want him in my boat i want him with me i want him walking with me talking with me living with me living in me christ in me the hope of glory jesus says the same yesterday today and forever the master is calm as he promised he would but he's calling for his believing children to recognize him in his word and make it manifest this is the darkest hour we have ever seen and tomorrow you can get up and you can say today is the darkest day i've ever seen because it's getting darker and darker and darker right in the darkest hour here comes jesus right along i want to see if i can find something really quick that's coming to my mind it's one of my favorite uh quotes it's in christ a mystery i believe let me go back christ is revealed in his own word he said the stabilizers has been put on the ship great fearful waves are out before us we know just beyond that wave there though we're nearing the shore we're nearing the shore just stay stable let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me no matter how you feel no matter what anything else stay with god stay with the word let's stay stable when you see those great old clouds around us storms are coming bombs in the hangar everything else they're talking about our stabilizers is right into the word god said it would be here he said it would be like this he told us what we were going to go through amen he said but i'm going to i'm going to give you a peace though not like world gives but a peace that the world didn't give and the world can't take away hallelujah he said the waves are going to be there but we will crest every one of them hallelujah we will go right over the top of them they cannot sink us they cannot drown us you put us in a grave we're coming up again there ain't no way the world is keeping it out we are going to crest every wave because our chief captain the great light is calling us to the other side hallelujah he's saying let's go to the other side we ain't got to worry about the winds and the waves he done spoke it and we're on our way he doesn't set it i'm on my way to a body change because it's in the word of god and you don't say i'm healed therefore i'm on my way let's go to the other side come on somebody why don't you tonight hear the word of god let's go to the other side of depression let's go to the other side of anxiety let's go to the other side let not your heart be troubled there's a big wave coming but don't you worry about it little children the stabilizers are on the ship and we're going to crest it like we did the last one and if there's another one coming we're going to go over it and over it until we go on to the next shore hallelujah i don't know about you but i'm ready for this boat to land on that sign [Applause] to land on that other shore whatever it might be let it come whatever it is it won't make any difference we're anchored in jesus christ are you anchored tonight are you cresting the waves is the light precious to you he's here to take you over to the other side maybe you've been caught up man's creeds and dogs ain't no life there but there's life in his word there's life in the presence of god how many would say lie to the lord tonight i i want that light just to become more precious to me in this dark time we're living in i want more of you getting close getting close what about that wave we're going to go over it what about that situation going to go over it what about that trouble brother we're going to go over it stabilizers have been placed on the ship we'll crest every one of them maybe you need to look at things a little different maybe right now you feel like you're about to fall over backwards flip over backwards things seem to be so out of cater no you know what's happening you're just going up a wave you're going to crest it and you're going to move to the other side it's in the darkest moments maybe you find yourself in that dark moment right now but there is a man that'll turn on the light i wonder how many pray that tonight lord flip my switch on turn on the light in my life i need you father we love you with all of our hearts we thank you lord you've moved and touched our lives in such a way lord we just ask tonight lord that you would come and let this word just sink into our hearts lord there's some here that's going through some really dark times but may this awakening awaken an awareness in their life to start looking because it's in these moments jesus comes it's in these moments you come and you show yourself you the resurrection and the life it's in these moments you come and you show you're the healer and the deliverer and all these things father father we get our eyes so many times in the darkness forgive us let this light become so precious to us lord god may it be not like those come to that moment and realize they didn't have it because it wasn't important but may we be found like those five wise virgins that kept their lamps trimmed and clear because light was precious to them lord of fresh experience was precious to them a refilling of the holy ghost was precious to them the movement of the spirit was precious to them oh god may we never live that lose that love affair with you father that love to be in your presence
