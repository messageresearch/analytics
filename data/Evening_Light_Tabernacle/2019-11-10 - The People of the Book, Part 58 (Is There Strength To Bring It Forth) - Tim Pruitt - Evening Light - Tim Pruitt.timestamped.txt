[47:38] we're so thankful to know that you're
[47:41] working now you're not giving up on your
[47:45] people and that you have never failed to
[47:48] keep a promise we want to thank you that
[47:51] you're here and that you present your

[48:05] people that reached out to you today you
[48:08] know their hearts cry as they've come in
[48:11] Lord from different places hearing from
[48:14] different ones around the world and
[48:16] throughout the u.s. Canada many are the
[48:21] afflictions of the righteous but the
[48:23] Lord delivers them out of them all
[48:26] may they today know us deliver
[48:29] as Savior as Redeemer as lord I pray
[48:34] dear God that you'll bless your people
[48:36] has assembled with us today and those
[48:39] Lord that are assembled with us from all
[48:42] over the world different places they've
[48:45] already have their services Lord been to
[48:48] church but now here in the evening time
[48:51] as the hours are difference they're
[48:55] sitting there in their homes perhaps and
[48:57] they're just wanting to hear from you
[49:00] again Lord there's something about it
[49:03] Lord that we get a little touch from you

[49:13] a living God and we believe that that's
[49:16] the way that you are your God that long
[49:18] for fellowship that you wanted our
[49:21] fellowship and so therefore you made a
[49:25] man in your image somebody that you
[49:27] could fellowship with and then we think
[49:30] of Jesus when he was here the what he
[49:33] the only thing he asked her father for
[49:36] was for our fellowship oh no God we're
[49:40] here today to give back that worship and
[49:43] fellowship back to you than to tell you
[49:46] that we love you Lord and that we're
[49:48] glad to be your children and I know that
[49:50] makes your heart glad but you would look
[49:53] over the children of Israel and say it's
[49:55] not laws and Commandments and the animal
[49:59] sacrifices and endless bloodshed that I
[50:02] desire but I just want this if you would
[50:05] just love me with all your heart with
[50:08] all your soul with all your might may it
[50:11] be today Lord that we love you with all
[50:14] that is within us as we surrender our
[50:17] lives to you Lord I surrender my life to
[50:21] you to minister today the minister life

[50:35] that will go forth direct and every word
[50:38] to its mark
[50:39] speak in their ever life-changing us in

[51:44] a vacation spot where we're really happy
[51:46] to have you a man good to be in the
[51:49] presence of the Lord together I was just
[51:50] there at his little church just a few
[51:55] weeks ago and we spent our 44th
[51:57] anniversary my wife and I they're in
[52:01] their little church just worshiping the
[52:03] Lord together and that's you know that's
[52:05] what it's all about we don't bum to
[52:07] ourselves anyway we belong to Jesus so
[52:10] we we had a wonderful time with them and
[52:12] just speaking to a lovely congregation
[52:15] packed out just a house full of
[52:18] believers there that had gathered in New
[52:21] Albany area so it was just wonderful to
[52:25] be with them god bless you and your
[52:27] service for the Lord it may he just
[52:30] energize you and strengthen you and give
[52:32] you a rest as you have these few days
[52:34] here and wherever you got leaves you and
[52:37] every person we just welcome you today
[52:40] and I hope you just feel welcome in the
[52:43] presence of the Lord those are on the
[52:44] internet some from South Africa telling
[52:47] me they'd be listening and God bless you
[52:49] Saints we love you and the Lord and
[52:52] you sojourn with us today in this
[52:55] service may the Lord speak to you
[52:57] directly let's let's look now at verse
[53:00] 20 Exodus chapter 23 behold I send an
[53:04] angel before thee to keep thee in thy
[53:07] way and to bring thee into the place
[53:10] which I have prepared that's sound
[53:13] wonderful
[53:14] Amen we've been speaking about returning
[53:18] you know the people of the book
[53:20] returning to the land of the book and
[53:22] remember God sent an angel I had to
[53:25] prepare the way a man to bring us into
[53:28] this place
[53:29] and and yet we we had a man a human
[53:34] angel if you want to speak of the
[53:35] messenger the Church of Laodicea you see
[53:38] John the Baptist was a messenger which
[53:41] is and Angelo's him so he was an angel
[53:44] that was sent from God but you know we
[53:47] had that not only just a an earthly
[53:50] angel we we have those supernatural
[53:54] angels that have went forth to bring
[53:57] preparation and that are here with us
[53:59] right now in this building this morning
[54:03] a man to bring you into the place that
[54:06] has been prepared for you and I think if
[54:10] you're lost you're confused if you're if
[54:13] you don't know the way around of your
[54:16] whatever this situation is in your life
[54:18] the angel of God is here the Holy Spirit
[54:21] to lead you right back to the fountain
[54:25] of life amen but beware of him and obey
[54:29] his voice provoke him not he will not
[54:32] for he will not pardon your
[54:33] transgressions for my name is in him but
[54:36] if our southern indeed obey his voice
[54:39] and do all that I speak then I will be
[54:44] an enemy unto thine enemies and an
[54:47] adversary unto the adversary for mine
[54:51] angel shall go before thee and bring
[54:53] thee in unto the hammerites into the
[54:56] hittites and the perizzites and the
[54:58] canaanites and the high writes and the
[55:00] jebusites
[55:01] and I will cut them off thou shall not
[55:04] bow down to their God
[55:05] not serve them neither do after their
[55:08] works but thou shalt utterly overthrow
[55:11] them and quite break down their images
[55:14] and you so said the Lord your God he he
[55:17] shall bless thy bread and that water and
[55:19] I will take sickness away from the midst
[55:22] of thee there shall nothing cast their
[55:26] young nor be barren in thy land the
[55:29] number of that days I will fulfill I
[55:32] will send my fear before thee and will
[55:34] destroy all the people to whom thou
[55:37] shalt come and I will make all that
[55:39] enemies turn their backs unto thee and I
[55:42] will send the Hornets before thee which
[55:44] shall drive out to highlight the
[55:46] Canaanite in the height Hittite from
[55:49] before thee I will not drive them out
[55:52] from before thee in one year
[55:54] lest they land become desolate and the
[55:57] beasts of field multiply against thee
[55:59] but little and little I will drive them
[56:02] out from before thee until thou be
[56:05] increased and inherit the land and I
[56:08] will set up bounds from the Red Sea even
[56:11] unto the sea of the Philistines and from
[56:14] the desert into the river for I will
[56:17] deliver the inhabitants of the land into
[56:19] your hand and thou shalt drive them out
[56:21] before thee and thou shalt make no
[56:24] covenant with them nor with their gods
[56:27] doesn't they shall not dwell in thy land
[56:30] lest they make these sin against me for
[56:33] his ass they'll serve their gods it will
[56:36] surely be a snare unto thee and then I
[56:39] would like to turn to 2nd Kings chapter
[56:43] 19 we read from the 3rd verse and they
[56:49] say unto Him thus saith Hezekiah this is
[56:55] a day of trouble and a rebuke and
[56:58] blasphemy but the children are come to
[57:01] the birth and there is not strength to
[57:05] bring forth man may God bless you can as
[57:10] you can be seated we noticed here that
[57:13] God was making a promise to them send in
[57:17] the angel before them bringing
[57:19] back to the land that would flow with
[57:22] milk and honey in other words it would
[57:24] be a fruitful Ayana and then of course
[57:27] he said that he would bless our bread
[57:29] and I water I will take sickness from
[57:32] away from the midst of these so he
[57:35] promised divine healing in this land and
[57:37] amen the necessary needs that we have to
[57:41] be fulfilled and then he would say that
[57:44] he would send my fear before thee and
[57:46] and would destroy all the people to then
[57:49] come and your enemies would put their
[57:53] back to you and and they would run from
[57:55] you in other words and then he made
[57:59] clear that there would be no baron in
[58:01] the land that but it would be a fruitful
[58:04] land and that God would would turn the
[58:08] barren situation into fruitfulness
[58:11] wonderful thing that God is doing and
[58:14] then we find in the Book of Kings where
[58:17] we have just read it was day when
[58:19] Sennacherib would come down from Assyria
[58:22] and would come to fight against Judah
[58:27] and he would he would mock the God of
[58:30] Israel and tell them not to put any
[58:33] confidence in that God because he had he
[58:36] had destroyed all the gods of the other
[58:38] lands and then he tried to also convince
[58:42] Israel or that the people of Judah that
[58:46] Hezekiah by removing the high places and
[58:49] bringing them back to Jerusalem to
[58:52] worship that he and indeed had offended
[58:55] Jehovah himself and so therefore he was
[58:58] being sent by God himself dis Joe
[59:01] himself to bring destruction to them and
[59:03] of course there was all kinds of
[59:06] different things that he was was wanting
[59:11] to do he he made them to pay tribute and
[59:14] they was he was taking bribes from them
[59:17] and things to to satisfy his his wrath
[59:22] and but he said that I'm gonna come and
[59:25] I'm gonna take you away from this land
[59:26] and I'm gonna take you and put you in
[59:29] another
[59:30] it'll be a land that is a fruitful land
[59:33] and you'll prosper and but it won't be
[59:35] this land and so again when Hezekiah
[59:41] hears all this news and and hears all of
[59:46] this blasphemy against God as the
[59:49] heralds of the Sanitary of his his army
[59:53] would would come out and stand shout out
[59:56] all of these blasphemies and against God
[59:59] and against the king and against the
[1:00:02] Lord Himself that it would be that
[1:00:06] Hezekiah would become very troubled by
[1:00:09] this and he would take it to the Lord
[1:00:11] and then he say this is a day of trouble
[1:00:14] and a rebuke and a blasphemy for the
[1:00:19] children are come to the birth and there
[1:00:21] is not strength to bring forth now this
[1:00:24] is a kind of a proverbial expression
[1:00:28] meaning that a dangerous crisis
[1:00:31] approaches and that the nation has no
[1:00:34] strength to carry it through the peril
[1:00:36] that is coming and brother Branham told
[1:00:39] us that you know that we - were in a in
[1:00:43] the stage of birth pains that the world
[1:00:45] was in birth pains and that it was about
[1:00:49] to have been coming through the water in
[1:00:53] the days of Noah the blood in the days
[1:00:55] of Jesus and then the the spirit or the
[1:01:00] fire that would come that would baptize
[1:01:02] the world with fire cleanse it so the
[1:01:04] Spirit of God could come down upon it
[1:01:06] you know that that as the world had went
[1:01:10] to that process are going to that we was
[1:01:12] about ready for our last and final birth
[1:01:15] pains but then he comes around and he
[1:01:18] said the church is also in birth pains
[1:01:20] and that is to bring forth on the
[1:01:24] promise of the word Jesus Christ back to
[1:01:27] the earth again and of course as we're
[1:01:30] looking at this today as he the question
[1:01:33] or what it was coming was he said the
[1:01:36] children her come to birth but there is
[1:01:39] not strength to bring forth so he's he's
[1:01:42] like him in Israel
[1:01:43] their trouble took throat a travailing
[1:01:46] woman a woman that's in travail but she
[1:01:48] just she is us
[1:01:50] he's labored so long and and is now wore
[1:01:53] out and is unable to bring forth have
[1:01:57] that final push to bring that child into
[1:02:00] being and so my question today that as
[1:02:05] we look at these things I want to just
[1:02:07] pose a question to us knowing that we're
[1:02:10] here and I also another day of time of
[1:02:14] blaspheming where it's against the Word
[1:02:16] of God and day of rebuke and trouble and
[1:02:19] and every kind of threat of the enemy
[1:02:23] that wants to take in and now take us
[1:02:26] out of the promised land of the word and
[1:02:28] put us over in some denominational camp
[1:02:31] where there is no power and where there
[1:02:34] is no real strength of the word of God
[1:02:38] to sustain of people I would you to
[1:02:41] understand I'm asking the question this
[1:02:43] morning is there strength to bring forth
[1:02:47] you know Jesus asked the question will I
[1:02:51] find faith and this is where that he he
[1:02:55] said when the Son of man cometh will I
[1:02:57] find faith upon the earth well well I
[1:02:59] find someone who will believe will I
[1:03:02] find that that faith that is going to be
[1:03:05] needed in that hour to take a people
[1:03:08] over into the promised land and I just
[1:03:11] want to save today there must be a
[1:03:13] church that reproduces Christ that is of
[1:03:18] the same species of the same character
[1:03:21] and the same faith in the sermon um it
[1:03:25] is horizon of the son brother Branham
[1:03:27] would give the example of two luxury
[1:03:30] cars and he said it was a Cadillac with
[1:03:33] you know as he described that maybe what
[1:03:36] he and that time thought was a very
[1:03:38] luxurious car and it was for the time
[1:03:41] but a Cadillac with dull skin leather
[1:03:44] seats and you know diamond studs in the
[1:03:47] steering wheel and and polished hubs and
[1:03:50] filled with the best gasoline you know
[1:03:54] in other words loaded with Scripture
[1:03:56] theology but yeah that one of them had
[1:04:00] no spark to move down the road and the
[1:04:03] other of course had spark so you know
[1:04:06] again when we when we look at this car
[1:04:09] for a moment it was a car that was what
[1:04:13] they say a Ford is you know for Dean
[1:04:15] they used that as acronym was found on
[1:04:18] the road dead now some of you Ford
[1:04:23] lovers won't love that but I drove to
[1:04:25] church and the Ford so don't get mad at
[1:04:27] me but but nevertheless you know we you
[1:04:32] know found on the road dead and somehow
[1:04:35] somehow this is what we find with with
[1:04:39] so much of Christianity today it's just
[1:04:42] it's just found on the road dead there's
[1:04:46] no life in it there's no power in it
[1:04:49] there's nothing that really save a man
[1:04:51] from his sins but yet he has to live in
[1:04:54] his sins and so he just in that dead
[1:04:58] that condition but I'll tell you I I'm
[1:05:01] believing that God's gonna have a place
[1:05:03] somewhere right around the world I'm not
[1:05:06] just talking about a local assembly but
[1:05:09] a place in the Bride of Christ around
[1:05:11] the world where that that she won't be
[1:05:14] found on the road dead but she'll be
[1:05:17] found in this last day alive those who
[1:05:20] are alive and remain at the coming of
[1:05:23] the Lord
[1:05:24] that will not hinder the resurrection
[1:05:26] what a what a promise that is to us now
[1:05:29] as we think about somebody he's found on
[1:05:32] the road dead some of them are worth
[1:05:34] billions and it will set thousands upon
[1:05:37] thousands of members some of my ornate
[1:05:41] stained glass and fancy pews and and ER
[1:05:44] they're the drivers who get behind the
[1:05:47] wheels are phd's and and you know a
[1:05:51] doctors of divinity and on and on and on
[1:05:54] but it does nowhere it cannot move down
[1:05:57] the road to divine healing it can't take
[1:06:01] you down to real deliverance and to real
[1:06:04] salvation and
[1:06:06] move you on to the rapture but rather is
[1:06:08] stranded and unable to move man now I'll
[1:06:13] tell you what I'd rather than having a
[1:06:15] car like that there's a dream car I'd
[1:06:17] rather have an old jalopy that would run
[1:06:19] that would take you down somewhere
[1:06:21] wouldn't you man it's more important to
[1:06:24] have Sparky and the power with it within
[1:06:27] that engine to take you down the road
[1:06:30] now brother madam would tell you in the
[1:06:32] it is horizon the Sun in his
[1:06:34] illustration he said the gasoline
[1:06:36] represents the word so it's full of the
[1:06:39] word it's the truth it but it's without
[1:06:42] the spirit it won't move and man and
[1:06:46] then he says and this is kind of gonna
[1:06:48] be the key to what we're talking about
[1:06:50] this morning we put too much stress on
[1:06:52] the mechanics and nothing on the
[1:06:56] dynamics and he said it needs the
[1:07:01] dynamic power of God the resurrection
[1:07:04] power of Jesus Christ upon the church to
[1:07:07] manifest and to bring to pass that this
[1:07:10] is gasoline hey man it might be in a
[1:07:14] gasoline can but it should still be
[1:07:16] water but the only proof of it is put
[1:07:19] life on it and then approved whether
[1:07:21] it's gasoline or not so now if we want
[1:07:24] to know if we've really got the world if
[1:07:26] we will really have received the word
[1:07:28] will it take us down the road will it
[1:07:31] take us to deliverance will it take us
[1:07:34] to the power of God will it take us down
[1:07:37] to divine healing will it take us on to
[1:07:39] rapture
[1:07:40] hey man that's the question brother
[1:07:43] branham assay we put too much stress on
[1:07:45] the mechanics we put too much stress on
[1:07:48] the body getting it right and polished
[1:07:51] and looking pretty and looking nice and
[1:07:54] we don't put enough on the dynamics
[1:07:56] I don't believe brother Brandon was
[1:08:00] against having a nice church and then
[1:08:03] sitting in Nice Tuesday they built two
[1:08:05] Tabernacles during his lifetime bill
[1:08:08] what did they the new and over the old
[1:08:11] one they're trying to make things better
[1:08:12] nicer for people to sit and and who
[1:08:15] lured with our condition and so on and
[1:08:17] on and on
[1:08:18] knives in the building he wasn't against
[1:08:20] that but what he wanted was there was
[1:08:23] not so much emphasis on how nice of
[1:08:26] church is because a church without life
[1:08:29] is a dead church a man we must have the
[1:08:35] life of God in every service I'll tell
[1:08:39] you I don't ever meet in vain I won't
[1:08:42] ever service to be powerpack packed with
[1:08:45] the life of God the Holy Spirit moving
[1:08:48] from the pulpit to the back.you
[1:08:51] I'm on but now he would say there has
[1:08:55] been churches and churches and brides
[1:08:57] brides and churches brides bride but
[1:09:01] there's got it someone hallelujah
[1:09:04] there's gotta come the real bride there
[1:09:06] must come one that's not only got the
[1:09:08] mechanics but there but the dynamics of
[1:09:11] it that makes the church live and move
[1:09:14] in the power of his resurrection
[1:09:17] but until we come to that place until we
[1:09:19] find that place what good does it do to
[1:09:22] polish the hub what good does it do to
[1:09:24] give her a facelift well our simonize
[1:09:27] job when there's no dynamics in it no
[1:09:29] matter how much the mechanics prove to
[1:09:31] be right there has to be the dynamics to
[1:09:35] make it work and I'll tell you the same
[1:09:38] thing you know some people will
[1:09:40] criticize because you have a nice church
[1:09:42] and a nice building and a nice place the
[1:09:44] works have been but they'll sit down in
[1:09:47] some little jalopy of a building or a
[1:09:50] little wreck of a place and a little
[1:09:53] storefront thinking that they're there
[1:09:55] holier than everybody else because
[1:09:56] they're so humble and they don't have no
[1:09:59] power of God and there's no healing and
[1:10:02] there's no delivers a man the building
[1:10:06] isn't what counts and the what counts is
[1:10:09] the Holy Spirit moving in that church
[1:10:13] demonstrating his glory among his people
[1:10:16] that's what counts
[1:10:17] amen all all the other isn't bein a man
[1:10:23] oh yeah you know I I had a guy used to
[1:10:26] come to church when we were when we were
[1:10:28] in and all abandoned building that
[1:10:31] hadn't had Church in it for 15 years and
[1:10:33] and you know we had swept up buckets
[1:10:36] full or basketballs at wasp in it and we
[1:10:39] had old bowel heaters made out of drum
[1:10:43] barrels and pipes out the window
[1:10:45] to burn and try to have a little heat in
[1:10:47] the building we had an outdoor toilet
[1:10:49] because we didn't have indoor facilities
[1:10:52] we didn't have water it's a place we and
[1:10:54] we had six like bugs and who won that
[1:10:57] one plug in and this man would always
[1:10:59] come to me and he said back to those
[1:11:01] little dimly lit places you know we got
[1:11:03] to get back we got to get back to how
[1:11:06] far back dimly lit do you wanna get you
[1:11:12] need to look around I mean we got we got
[1:11:14] rusty gold pews that that get splinters
[1:11:17] in you when you slide down them and you
[1:11:19] know we we freeze on one side and burn
[1:11:21] on the other you know there's no
[1:11:23] convenience there's no air conditioning
[1:11:25] how much more rustic do you want a man
[1:11:30] but you see he thought they're getting a
[1:11:32] little more arresting what get him into
[1:11:34] God but I'll tell you that I'll get you
[1:11:36] to God I might what gets you to God is
[1:11:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost power
[1:11:42] Jesus Christ that makes you live right
[1:11:45] walk right talk right
[1:11:47] [Applause]
[1:11:52] hey man I remember sitting in a in a
[1:11:55] kitten folks place you know one time
[1:11:57] when I was a young boy and seeing an old
[1:12:00] old car had a hand wiper that you wiped
[1:12:03] like this and the skids get in there and
[1:12:06] drives that old set course it didn't
[1:12:08] move but we could pretend that we were
[1:12:12] going down the road a man and it was an
[1:12:15] old no car that had been left to set and
[1:12:18] the tires were were rotted and run down
[1:12:20] it with nothing would move nothing would
[1:12:22] crank but buddy we could pretend but
[1:12:26] what I do here so that we don't want to
[1:12:27] pretend we're having church a man we
[1:12:32] don't want to have a bunch of pretense
[1:12:34] that this is the message just because
[1:12:38] it's in a gasoline can of a building
[1:12:40] called church and what we want is the
[1:12:43] power of God the spark of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:46] that black night the word that is
[1:12:49] preached otherwise if it isn't being
[1:12:52] ignited it might as well be water but
[1:13:03] it's been prophesied that there is a
[1:13:05] people who is strength to bring forth
[1:13:08] let me just read you a prophecy this is
[1:13:11] from spoken words original seed and he
[1:13:15] says know what here's what I'm trying to
[1:13:16] say to you the lawn reproduction bring
[1:13:20] forth of its kind Genesis 111 these last
[1:13:25] days true church bride comes to the
[1:13:27] headstone will be a super church a man a
[1:13:33] super race and she nears the great
[1:13:36] headstone there will be so much like him
[1:13:38] so much like him until that will be in
[1:13:41] his very image as an order to be united
[1:13:45] with him there will be one that will be
[1:13:47] the very manifestation of the word of
[1:13:51] the Living God
[1:13:52] a man now of course you know today there
[1:13:57] there can be a lot of bringing forth the
[1:13:59] members
[1:14:00] that can be okay we can bring both
[1:14:03] beautiful buildings we can bring forth
[1:14:06] even great sermons but what about
[1:14:09] bringing sons of the word a people who
[1:14:13] know their God and who do exploits now
[1:14:18] of course as we look at this we're gonna
[1:14:21] look into some prophecies of the last
[1:14:24] day if you just will because this will
[1:14:26] tell you a little day a bit about the
[1:14:29] day of blasphemy and rebuke now Jesus is
[1:14:33] on his way to Calvary so as we're as
[1:14:35] we're turning to Luke 23 27 let me
[1:14:38] preface this by saying this he was being
[1:14:41] led away to be crucified now we know
[1:14:44] Jesus was the word and there he was he
[1:14:50] was being crucified not because daddy he
[1:14:55] didn't that he did something wrong but
[1:14:57] because that he went against the
[1:15:01] preconceived ideas of the religious
[1:15:04] systems of that day and so as he has led
[1:15:08] away to be crucified we break in on the
[1:15:11] scene in verse 27 at Luke 23 and there
[1:15:14] followed him a great company of people
[1:15:16] and of women which also be wailed and
[1:15:20] lamented him but Jesus turning in to
[1:15:23] them said daughters of Jerusalem we not
[1:15:27] for me but weep for yourselves and for
[1:15:30] your children for behold the days are
[1:15:33] coming in which they shall say blessed
[1:15:37] are the barren and the wombs that never
[1:15:39] bare and the paps which never gets up
[1:15:43] and then they shall begin to say to the
[1:15:47] mountains fall on us and onto the heels
[1:15:50] cover us for if they do these things in
[1:15:54] a green tree what shall be done in the
[1:15:57] dry in other words if they do this kind
[1:16:00] of thing to the innocent
[1:16:01] what are we happen when we wouldn't when
[1:16:04] there in the days when they're guilty
[1:16:05] now so as we're looking at this for a
[1:16:08] moment
[1:16:09] brother Branham would explain this
[1:16:10] scripture and it is a whole different
[1:16:12] light
[1:16:13] and what most theologians look at it
[1:16:15] because he said it speaks of a day where
[1:16:18] women wouldn't want no more children and
[1:16:21] man they want a dog or a chat or
[1:16:24] something like that but she doesn't want
[1:16:25] children anymore
[1:16:27] now let me just before we go further any
[1:16:29] further there's nothing wrong with
[1:16:30] owning a dog or a cat and enjoying a pet
[1:16:33] I've had many of them through my life
[1:16:35] and and we're not condemning that so
[1:16:37] let's get that thought out of your head
[1:16:39] right now but here's here's what we want
[1:16:41] to bring it down to because we're
[1:16:44] talking that straight to bring forth and
[1:16:47] he said that there was he was this was
[1:16:49] speaking of a day that women wouldn't
[1:16:51] want no more children they want a dog or
[1:16:55] cat or something like that but she
[1:16:57] doesn't want children anymore why she's
[1:16:59] old Mother Hubbard if she has a child
[1:17:01] she didn't want to that's a remark so
[1:17:04] Hollywood it don't want some mothers his
[1:17:06] woman to be an old Mother Hubbard so
[1:17:08] he'll have some operation or she will
[1:17:11] performed himself for her to keep them
[1:17:13] from having children they don't want no
[1:17:15] more children and Jesus spoke heaven and
[1:17:19] said what did he and what did he say at
[1:17:22] that time that will begin begin to cry
[1:17:24] for the rocks and the mountains to fall
[1:17:27] on them she'll practice birth control so
[1:17:31] she can go to parties she can't be
[1:17:33] bothered with a baby nursing her in this
[1:17:37] farmer and when she's pregnant they'll
[1:17:39] be deforming deformers he won't look
[1:17:42] like she used to and her husband is
[1:17:44] ignorant enough to let her go that way
[1:17:46] she won't give him a child and Jesus
[1:17:50] spoke of it and he said that what they
[1:17:52] were doing this at that time they will
[1:17:55] go to crying in for the rocks to fall on
[1:17:57] them it's the coming of the Lord and
[1:18:00] they'll pay great sums for cats and dogs
[1:18:03] to mother that's right
[1:18:04] she must mother something because it is
[1:18:07] a god-given nature so now even and we're
[1:18:12] talking about a society today you know
[1:18:15] motherhood is
[1:18:17] thing that is now looked down upon a
[1:18:20] homemaker is something that is unwanted
[1:18:23] you know the womanís who are sees
[1:18:26] unfulfilled to raise children you know
[1:18:29] she she should be career minded and you
[1:18:32] know I mean everything is exploiting a
[1:18:35] woman in a wrong position and make them
[1:18:40] the firefighters in the end on the
[1:18:42] military and you know make them you know
[1:18:45] the Amazon Queen out here fighting and
[1:18:47] then the man you know on the other hand
[1:18:51] has been feminized are you with me in
[1:18:56] his masculinity taken away while the
[1:18:59] woman takes on that masculinity because
[1:19:03] it's an hour of perversion the Bible
[1:19:06] said it would come this way as it was in
[1:19:09] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:19:11] coming of the Son of Man so you see this
[1:19:15] idea not to have human babies but to
[1:19:18] have parent but the parent fur babies
[1:19:21] instead has captured the imagination of
[1:19:24] the young adults and others in this
[1:19:27] generation man I just read an article
[1:19:30] about the Millennials a generation that
[1:19:32] depends on technology and Anna's poem
[1:19:36] and is politically opinionated and aware
[1:19:39] of climate change and her walk in their
[1:19:42] understanding society and culture and
[1:19:44] politics and environment and since
[1:19:47] perhaps their need to foster animals
[1:19:48] Trump's procreation for a socially
[1:19:51] conscious reason or maybe they're just
[1:19:54] second generation hippies who would
[1:19:56] prefer to stay independence to being
[1:19:58] bogged down by parental responsibilities
[1:20:01] or sorts simpler they just like being
[1:20:04] pet parents so the one that went on to
[1:20:09] talk about that now this generation
[1:20:11] should be called Generation Rex and if
[1:20:15] you're wondering why the playgrounds in
[1:20:16] the city are quite and the dog runs are
[1:20:19] packed a new report has an answer more
[1:20:21] and more us women are for
[1:20:23] foregoing motherhood and getting their
[1:20:26] maternal kicks by owning handbag size
[1:20:29] canes canines sorry tines do they know
[1:20:37] the difference but the data from this
[1:20:40] Center for Disease Control and
[1:20:42] Prevention showed that a big drop in the
[1:20:46] number of babies born to women aged 15
[1:20:48] to 29 corresponds with a huge increase
[1:20:50] in the number of tiny pooches that are
[1:20:53] owned by young u.s. women and and said
[1:20:57] dog crazy New York ladies told the Post
[1:21:00] they aren't surprised by the findings
[1:21:02] that they happily give up diaper changes
[1:21:05] temper tantrums and college funds for
[1:21:08] the easy affection of their doggy child
[1:21:11] so you know the Millennials are are
[1:21:14] opting out for pets and not Parenthood
[1:21:17] and they explain why because you know
[1:21:21] the dogs need heaps of love and
[1:21:23] attention but not constant monitoring
[1:21:26] like a human child and it isn't
[1:21:29] considered an abuse of our legal
[1:21:31] practice to leave your puppet home alone
[1:21:33] when you head off to work
[1:21:35] and parents don't have the luxury to do
[1:21:37] this with the child and those kids have
[1:21:39] to be watched all the time you know this
[1:21:43] insanity gets worse in the recent news
[1:21:46] here lately a woman you know of course
[1:21:50] she did admit to happen mental trouble
[1:21:52] and for her mental capacity you know she
[1:21:56] was suing her her homeowners association
[1:21:59] because they forbid her to have chickens
[1:22:03] and she had four pet chickens which were
[1:22:05] prescribed to her to help cope with her
[1:22:08] stress and the soul she said her girls
[1:22:11] are her life sound like people that went
[1:22:16] to the chickens you know they're there
[1:22:21] again I mean we're living in an insane
[1:22:23] world where people can't tell what's
[1:22:27] right from wrong we have a whole
[1:22:30] generation that exhausts the creation
[1:22:33] about the create
[1:22:34] and they will do this and we'll see them
[1:22:37] you know elevating animal rights over
[1:22:39] human rights and their worship because
[1:22:43] the Bible said in the book of Romans
[1:22:45] that in the last days they were worship
[1:22:48] the creation over the Creator so it's
[1:22:52] not been taught in our art schools and
[1:22:54] by esteemed educators you know where
[1:22:59] where they they promote animal rights
[1:23:02] then and so on that and it fosters these
[1:23:06] ideas that are coming out now and annum
[1:23:09] kind of real catchy among the world that
[1:23:11] we live in beyond me than the impossible
[1:23:14] burger and it's an attempt to make meet
[1:23:17] my man in order to stop or limit animal
[1:23:21] as useful food because it calls that
[1:23:24] abuse and the reason part is is because
[1:23:27] men are now worshipping the curry a that
[1:23:31] the creation rather than the Creator and
[1:23:34] then of course as you look into this
[1:23:37] many of you don't realize but there's an
[1:23:40] underlining um thing that it's bringing
[1:23:44] the world together and the religions of
[1:23:47] the world are even binding together for
[1:23:50] the good of mankind because of the
[1:23:53] environment and climate change becomes
[1:23:56] the tool for bringing the two religions
[1:23:58] of the world into a one-world government
[1:24:01] you know and the Tobii is if you don't
[1:24:04] love the environment you know then you
[1:24:08] know if you don't go along with their
[1:24:10] ideas and you don't love the environment
[1:24:12] and your your hater and you know if this
[1:24:16] isn't bizarre enough we even have
[1:24:19] seminary students we're talking about
[1:24:21] religious people in religious seminaries
[1:24:24] in America in New York confessing sins
[1:24:28] to plants now this is insanity now let's
[1:24:37] just stop for a moment because we're
[1:24:38] talking about we're talking about
[1:24:40] strength to give bring forth birth and
[1:24:43] brother madam said now we're here in
[1:24:45] this last day in this a prophecy
[1:24:47] and there's a prophecy he says we don't
[1:24:51] weep for me but wait for your children
[1:24:57] because we're coming into a day an hour
[1:25:00] where things are vastly changing and so
[1:25:04] you know again the idea of putting
[1:25:08] animals - with equal rights to man or
[1:25:13] giving them rights period are you with
[1:25:17] me
[1:25:18] it comes from the spirit of insanity
[1:25:21] that's in this world the sorts of Rights
[1:25:24] comes from God himself he's the one who
[1:25:28] gives rights and he gave man his
[1:25:31] capacity for rational thought because he
[1:25:33] was man was made in the image of God but
[1:25:37] to give rights to creatures that are in
[1:25:39] irrational lacking a moral sense and
[1:25:42] incapable of living in a rights-based
[1:25:45] environment makes a mockery of the very
[1:25:48] concepts of rights and ultimately
[1:25:50] threatens man himself and now to show
[1:25:54] you the spirit that is behind this the
[1:25:57] the man Peter Singer who is widely
[1:26:00] viewed as the father of international
[1:26:03] animal rights movement singer publicly
[1:26:06] stated that parents should have the
[1:26:09] right to euthanize their children within
[1:26:12] 28 days of birth who have severe
[1:26:15] handicaps and in fact killing an
[1:26:17] effective infant is not more is not
[1:26:20] morally equivalent to killing the person
[1:26:22] he's written sometimes is not wrong at
[1:26:25] all but but apparently apparently though
[1:26:28] killing an animal is you see let me just
[1:26:32] care it carry this down what were your
[1:26:35] on this subject to say we should not eat
[1:26:37] animals is to challenge God himself and
[1:26:43] to and the question God's own goodness
[1:26:49] for he said in Genesis 9:3 every moving
[1:26:54] thing that's the liveth shall be meat
[1:26:55] for you even as ever greener
[1:26:58] have I given you all things so then sew
[1:27:03] them to question or to say we should not
[1:27:06] eat animals is to challenge God and
[1:27:10] challenge his own goodness as he would
[1:27:14] say and carried it further him to first
[1:27:17] Timothy four and one and that he said
[1:27:19] and the spirit speaks expressly in the
[1:27:22] latter times some shall depart from
[1:27:24] faith from the faith giving heed to
[1:27:26] seducing spirits and the doctrines of
[1:27:30] devils
[1:27:32] notice what Paul calls these seducing
[1:27:37] spirits and doctrines of devils
[1:27:39] you know what's because they're being
[1:27:41] taught in our schools they've been
[1:27:43] taught by our educators and he says he
[1:27:46] brings it the speaking lies in hypocrisy
[1:27:49] having their conscience seared with a
[1:27:51] hot iron forbidding to marry commanding
[1:27:55] to abstain from meats which God created
[1:27:59] to be received with Thanksgiving of them
[1:28:00] which believe and know the truth for
[1:28:03] every creature of God is good and
[1:28:06] nothing to be refused if it be received
[1:28:08] with Thanksgiving for it is sanctified
[1:28:11] or made holy by the Word of God in
[1:28:14] prayer
[1:28:15] a man now courts we're against animal
[1:28:20] cruelty and God is against it but to
[1:28:24] elevate animals to human rights removes
[1:28:27] man from his position of sonship and
[1:28:30] makes animals equal to him so here we
[1:28:34] get it you know fur babies and pet kids
[1:28:37] and pet brands instead of raising
[1:28:40] children for God it's a part of the
[1:28:42] prophecy of the last day now jesus said
[1:28:48] if they did this to me where they beat
[1:28:50] and strife and crucify when I have done
[1:28:53] nothing wrong what will happen the last
[1:28:55] day when human life will be devalued now
[1:28:59] brother Brennan would give the
[1:29:01] illustration of this and he said you
[1:29:03] know the time will come he said where
[1:29:05] that where they won't want to have
[1:29:07] children and raise a children
[1:29:10] for the to glorify God and and and to be
[1:29:14] in position you the family is under
[1:29:17] attack the structure of the home is
[1:29:21] under attack motherhood has been under
[1:29:24] attack hey man
[1:29:27] and then of course fatherhood is under
[1:29:30] attack marriage itself is under attack
[1:29:35] somebody help me preach now the whole
[1:29:38] thing that every every everything of the
[1:29:42] Word of God season is coming against it
[1:29:45] in every way that he can and you're
[1:29:48] gonna be the one talking rationale
[1:29:50] you're the one that's going to be
[1:29:52] thought yeah you know hard-headed and
[1:29:54] stupid and man and worthy of jail time
[1:29:58] and sent to prison and whatever else
[1:30:01] because you go against the trends of
[1:30:04] society and brother Bantam gave the
[1:30:07] illustration he says I'm a mother bear
[1:30:09] that doesn't conceived during the winter
[1:30:11] and said she'll hunt up last year's Cubs
[1:30:13] and mothered him and she has to mother
[1:30:16] something remember that this is this is
[1:30:21] why other all the need for the pet
[1:30:23] brands and and even let me just say even
[1:30:25] though the deal of the feminist spirits
[1:30:29] getting their up on the homosexual
[1:30:31] community and then they'll get into
[1:30:33] livestock raising and little baby goats
[1:30:36] or lambs or calves or this or that the
[1:30:39] other and they're flooding the whole the
[1:30:42] whole livestock in industry and all the
[1:30:45] pet industry because they're got a
[1:30:48] mother something are you with me a man
[1:30:52] but but again again what about the
[1:30:55] church and brother Madden said if a
[1:30:58] woman won't have a baby for a husband
[1:31:00] she'll take a cat or a dog or something
[1:31:02] she's got a mutters something it's a
[1:31:05] nature but to bear a child for a husband
[1:31:08] and raise it to the service of God
[1:31:09] that's entirely
[1:31:12] out of her line she should all not she'd
[1:31:16] be so disgraced if she did buy her sin
[1:31:18] loving society of this 1965 type of
[1:31:22] women what about right here in 2019
[1:31:25] nearly over fifty years later are you
[1:31:27] wouldn't me
[1:31:28] but then he equates and he said a true
[1:31:30] picture on the modern church today
[1:31:33] neither does a modern church here won
[1:31:37] any screaming shouting tongue speaketh
[1:31:40] to 38 young and surrounder yeah yet she
[1:31:43] don't want me to them whooping and
[1:31:45] crying and screaming hey ma'am
[1:31:47] hallelujah what such a child would
[1:31:49] immediately throw her out of her
[1:31:51] denomination they had one like that and
[1:31:54] her churches rather tore out right quick
[1:31:56] why are you letting such stuff as that
[1:31:58] goal so you see she's preg needed with
[1:32:00] something because he's bringing board
[1:32:03] members all the time but she don't want
[1:32:06] none of them screaming hollering
[1:32:08] blabbered suits are eight miserable
[1:32:10] creatures that she thinks they are
[1:32:12] it was certainly embarrassing it would
[1:32:14] ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:32:17] scientific society church that she
[1:32:19] belonged to here they would throw her
[1:32:22] out at the next council she came havin
[1:32:24] so she don't want to be printed with the
[1:32:26] word is anybody listening because that's
[1:32:31] the only kind that the word can't bring
[1:32:35] forth now we talked about warning the
[1:32:38] word the word the word the word but the
[1:32:40] only time the word can bring forth a man
[1:32:44] is not gonna be pet babies come over you
[1:32:48] have to pediment baby in the church and
[1:32:51] they're backslidden all the time they
[1:32:53] never have deliverance in their life are
[1:32:56] you with me look what God wants his
[1:32:59] genuine forlorn sons and daughters of
[1:33:02] God that are in his image and in his
[1:33:05] likeness
[1:33:05] Amen the only kind of work can bring
[1:33:08] forth is those whose got a spark in them
[1:33:11] they must come to light and what I'm
[1:33:16] asking today is the church is the bride
[1:33:20] Church is the message search do they
[1:33:23] have the strength to bring four children
[1:33:27] at the word those Pentecostal babies
[1:33:34] acts 2:38 the only time that the word
[1:33:38] can bring forth those kind of when they
[1:33:41] come and have born they're born with a
[1:33:43] life in them it's not a stillbirth it's
[1:33:47] not a dead baby it's not a quiet baby
[1:33:51] come on it's a baby that screaming
[1:33:54] yelling hollering man rich I see because
[1:33:59] light the brass has entered into my porn
[1:34:06] of the spirit it has the Spirit of God
[1:34:08] in it he said no and Alexa Church John
[1:34:10] three gone bobbed hair painted face
[1:34:13] there's no such of that they just added
[1:34:15] all of it you don't find that in the
[1:34:17] Word of God amen now he tells what you
[1:34:20] find in the Word of God you find an
[1:34:23] old-fashioned sanctified Holy Ghost
[1:34:27] filled child born of the Spirit of God
[1:34:31] screaming and hollering and shouted and
[1:34:34] praising God
[1:34:35] but that's altogether out of the reaches
[1:34:37] for her she don't want none of that
[1:34:39] Oh what does she do then she brings
[1:34:42] forth a pair of painted face short
[1:34:44] wearing Jezebel society illegitimate
[1:34:47] cats they call him or she was born and
[1:34:52] married connected with her she was
[1:34:55] married connected with her first husband
[1:34:57] the first Adam by the adulterous wife of
[1:35:00] Eve Adams first wife you say adulteress
[1:35:02] she sure was but no she claims it atom
[1:35:05] this atom this first atom is dead
[1:35:07] so he died a long time ago and I'm
[1:35:10] reborn again I'm certainly married to
[1:35:12] the second Adam Christ the word but he
[1:35:15] said notice what she loves now you want
[1:35:19] to know if she really married him walk
[1:35:21] the Sheila
[1:35:22] what's her lover and you can see what
[1:35:24] she loved in love with the church says
[1:35:26] this dar the word says this but she says
[1:35:29] my church says this then who she is in
[1:35:33] love with who is her husband her own
[1:35:35] fruits prove who she is she was born
[1:35:38] first to Adam that's her natural birth
[1:35:40] she never left that she's a lover of the
[1:35:42] world and she claims he's born the
[1:35:44] second time to Christ but her lover
[1:35:46] notices to Adam yet because she loves
[1:35:49] the world and another thing noticed what
[1:35:52] kind of children she is bearing it tells
[1:35:54] what their Papa is whether it's the
[1:35:57] first item or the second I'm a man if
[1:36:00] the church belongs that brings for the
[1:36:03] child of the second Adam amen he acts
[1:36:06] the second Adams way of acting like they
[1:36:10] did on the day of Pentecost that is a
[1:36:12] really true
[1:36:13] second adam's children how many can say
[1:36:17] Amanda that this morning I mean that's
[1:36:20] what God is asking the church do we have
[1:36:22] strength to bring out of this word that
[1:36:25] has been given the seals have been taken
[1:36:28] off of it the mysteries have been
[1:36:30] revealed hallelujah the seven thunders
[1:36:33] have other divorces amen God has spoke
[1:36:37] to this generation but now do we have
[1:36:41] strength to bring forth custom reinforce
[1:36:47] it's got to be something with life
[1:36:49] finished a man now brother Branham would
[1:36:54] tell us in marriage and divorce now some
[1:36:56] of these things are a little difficult
[1:36:58] for a lot of modernist to swallow but
[1:37:00] it's still our message but he talked
[1:37:05] about in in marriage and divorce
[1:37:08] speaking about Christ said he can put
[1:37:11] the church away but she cannot put him
[1:37:13] away he did it and he's true that in the
[1:37:16] days of the Luther Wessling Pentecost
[1:37:18] when they refused to become further part
[1:37:21] of him by having a spiritual sexual
[1:37:24] affair to become pregnant with further
[1:37:26] part of the word you understand she
[1:37:29] refused that Lutheran Church refused for
[1:37:31] Christ to have any more desire with her
[1:37:34] Luther refused and let me say
[1:37:36] she's gonna call me something anyhow so
[1:37:39] it is today with that but one of them
[1:37:40] they failed to take that word that
[1:37:42] refused Christ and any woman that
[1:37:44] refuses a man his child has no right to
[1:37:47] be a wife to him
[1:37:49] they might remember in the Bible and the
[1:37:52] King married Esther because the Queen
[1:37:53] reviews he just got another one what
[1:37:55] happened when she refused to come out
[1:37:57] with the King and obey him the same
[1:37:59] thing it is when a woman refuses to be
[1:38:02] wiped her husband and so it with the
[1:38:05] church that refuses to become fragmented
[1:38:08] in the age that we now live to bring
[1:38:10] forth children of this age we are not
[1:38:14] loosened and we're not wet sleeves and
[1:38:15] neither are we Pentecostal we've got to
[1:38:18] be children of this age through the
[1:38:20] pregnancy of the Word of God to bring
[1:38:22] forth the child of this age the seed
[1:38:25] child I hope you understand a man now he
[1:38:29] goes on and he said but he said now
[1:38:31] notice said the bride will be a lovely
[1:38:34] little lady of the word unadulterated
[1:38:36] not touched by any man's organization or
[1:38:40] any man-made tearing she'll be purely on
[1:38:43] adulterated bride of the word a man and
[1:38:46] a man I hope you get that not on the air
[1:38:49] and I'm saying this morning even out on
[1:38:51] their hair I'm hope you get that and
[1:38:54] then there's gonna be a bride in this
[1:38:56] last day that has the strength to bring
[1:38:59] for the child with life a night now
[1:39:05] saying this I'm afraid that we have over
[1:39:10] emphasized the letter and under
[1:39:15] emphasized the spirit too much stress he
[1:39:20] said on the mechanics and nothing on the
[1:39:24] dynamics let me just go over some things
[1:39:31] about the gospel and what the gospel is
[1:39:36] and the Great Commission that has been
[1:39:38] given brother Branham would would
[1:39:43] emphasize this many times and so I've
[1:39:45] just picked out of you and I think
[1:39:47] brother Timothy may have read one of
[1:39:49] these
[1:39:49] maybe there's some of these winds
[1:39:51] tonight was a great message brother
[1:39:53] Timothy god bless you for that but he
[1:39:56] said that he said here Jesus said go
[1:39:58] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:40:00] to every nation now listen see whether
[1:40:04] that's right or not preach the gospel to
[1:40:06] every nation that's the United States
[1:40:08] and to all the world he that believeth
[1:40:09] is baptized whom he saved he that
[1:40:12] believeth not so be damned these signs
[1:40:13] shall follow them that believe and in my
[1:40:17] name they will cast out Devils speak
[1:40:20] with new tongues take up serpents drink
[1:40:23] deadly things or lay their hands on the
[1:40:25] sick and shall not harm them now he
[1:40:28] didn't say go teach the word he said go
[1:40:33] preach the gospel and he said the word
[1:40:37] is the beginning or the forerunner of
[1:40:40] the gospel you read that one and the
[1:40:43] word goes out and the gospel of and the
[1:40:47] power of the demonstration of God
[1:40:49] follows the word and makes the word
[1:40:52] manifest that's the gospel right amen
[1:40:58] now the Bible said that that God went
[1:41:02] with them confirming the word with signs
[1:41:06] following them a ma'am so the word went
[1:41:10] forth and God confirmed it
[1:41:13] and now I've got ed to me this is on
[1:41:17] shouting ground to you if this if the
[1:41:19] word is a forerunner of the gospel and
[1:41:22] we today have received the word again
[1:41:28] hallelujah
[1:41:29] then Gorda God if the word is a
[1:41:31] forerunner the gospel then the power the
[1:41:34] demonstration of God follows the word
[1:41:38] hallelujah Amen no wonder we say we
[1:41:41] shall see miracles and while with no
[1:41:45] wonder we can stress and know that our
[1:41:48] God will be a God that is among us
[1:41:50] healing the sick delivered his people
[1:41:53] moving in his church the Copa word has
[1:41:58] went forth as the forerunner for the
[1:42:01] signs to follow a man now he would also
[1:42:10] go on to say and then this is another
[1:42:13] one Christ never told us to build in his
[1:42:16] seminary or anything like that he said
[1:42:18] preach the gospel and the gospel isn't
[1:42:23] word only but through power
[1:42:26] manifestation of the Holy Spirit which
[1:42:29] would produce the science of mark 16
[1:42:31] when he said go into all the world
[1:42:32] preach the gospel to every creature
[1:42:34] these signs shall follow them the word
[1:42:37] itself is dead until it becomes in an
[1:42:42] action and produces life are you with me
[1:42:48] now the word itself is dead until it
[1:42:53] comes into action and produces life man
[1:42:59] you say well we got the word the word
[1:43:01] the word and I'm telling the lot of you
[1:43:03] dead churches out there it's just a dead
[1:43:05] word it's a word without life until it
[1:43:09] becomes God breathed and when it becomes
[1:43:12] God breathed moved on by the spirit it
[1:43:15] heals it delivers it set free
[1:43:18] [Applause]
[1:43:21] there's a lot of word that's laying
[1:43:24] there lifeless hey man oh my and but but
[1:43:28] listen it's just and listen here's what
[1:43:31] your brothers said it's just waiting for
[1:43:33] someone with faith to an order that make
[1:43:35] it live again
[1:43:37] somebody with me now am i waiting for
[1:43:41] you to anoint it with faith man because
[1:43:44] it takes a faith to spot that word to
[1:43:48] make it live hey man now so it's because
[1:43:53] there's an outfit atmosphere that brings
[1:43:55] forth the product now so again he would
[1:44:00] talk about it again let me just share a
[1:44:02] couple of these more but he says in the
[1:44:04] missionary talk he said the word gospel
[1:44:07] means good news the good news is a Bible
[1:44:10] and the Bible is the letter and the
[1:44:12] letter killeth and the spirit giveth
[1:44:14] life so Paul said the gospel came not
[1:44:17] through word only brother Branham said
[1:44:22] it we're putting too much stress on the
[1:44:23] mechanics and nuts and on the dynamics
[1:44:27] in mind now I'll tell you right now the
[1:44:31] moment you start talking like that then
[1:44:34] you get somebody trying to tell you
[1:44:35] you're gonna be an old Mother Hubbard
[1:44:37] you're just gonna be another Pentecostal
[1:44:40] you're you're gonna hear you're gonna be
[1:44:42] something something like that you know
[1:44:44] you know that that ain't what we do
[1:44:46] today where we're hearing the word age
[1:44:48] and what you got in your word ages you
[1:44:51] got a letter that is killing you hey man
[1:44:55] but let me tell you something friend
[1:44:57] good it wasn't sick to kill you
[1:44:59] it was the gasoline that only needs to
[1:45:03] fire the Holy Ghost to come upon that
[1:45:07] word I prove that what you really got is
[1:45:11] gasoline
[1:45:12] because otherwise it won't be water now
[1:45:21] so he said the only way the gospel could
[1:45:24] be priests would be to manifest the
[1:45:27] power of the Holy Spirit now he said
[1:45:31] then strictly speaking when he said the
[1:45:34] science must follow them may not the
[1:45:36] sign may follow them they ought to
[1:45:38] follow them they shall follow them
[1:45:39] therefore strictly speaking a man cannot
[1:45:42] qualify himself as a believer until this
[1:45:45] has happened no church can have the
[1:45:48] right are calling themselves a believe
[1:45:50] in church until these signs have
[1:45:53] followed them a man and what to do and
[1:45:58] it's making the word manifest now again
[1:46:03] in what is the Holy Ghost she said he
[1:46:05] said he said go into all the world and
[1:46:08] preach the gospel what does the gospel
[1:46:10] not word only but through the power and
[1:46:12] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:15] making the Word of God manifest is the
[1:46:18] gospel so now again you know the
[1:46:22] denominations brother Brennan said
[1:46:23] couldn't take the gospel and finish the
[1:46:25] Great Commission because he said they
[1:46:28] couldn't receive all the word amen and
[1:46:31] so now again if we're gonna finish the
[1:46:33] Great Commission we received the word
[1:46:35] and then to preach the gospel here is to
[1:46:39] make the Word of God manifested a man to
[1:46:44] see the word demonstrated in his power a
[1:46:47] man now
[1:46:49] again in five identification he says
[1:46:52] Paul said the gospel came not to us in
[1:46:54] word only but through power
[1:46:56] manifestation of the Holy Ghost the
[1:46:58] gospel is the power of God to make the
[1:47:00] word act what it says it'll new preach
[1:47:04] the gospel into all the world so the
[1:47:06] gospel is the power of God to make the
[1:47:09] word act so if the power of God to make
[1:47:14] the word act isn't in the body of
[1:47:17] believers they're not believers they're
[1:47:19] only professor
[1:47:20] believers they have a profession without
[1:47:23] a possession a man they're bringing
[1:47:27] forth stillborn babies instead of babies
[1:47:31] with life in them they don't have
[1:47:33] strength to bring forth to what kind of
[1:47:36] word said that they would produce now
[1:47:39] again what is the gospel not just word
[1:47:42] on impulse it but manifestation the word
[1:47:44] the gospel came didn't live until word
[1:47:46] only but through power and demonstration
[1:47:48] go on all the world and demonstrate the
[1:47:51] power of the Resurrection see these
[1:47:53] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:47:55] just cheat see the word won't do it
[1:47:59] you've got out of the power of the Holy
[1:48:02] Ghost behind the word to make it come to
[1:48:05] life again amen there again if he says
[1:48:11] it takes more than just teaching a word
[1:48:14] it takes a manifestation of that word to
[1:48:17] make these signs follow
[1:48:19] that's right God manifested himself oh
[1:48:22] my there again he would say otherwise
[1:48:27] the only way the signs of March 16 can
[1:48:29] follow the believer is that the Holy
[1:48:31] Spirit Himself takes the Word of God and
[1:48:34] demonstration to the people now faith
[1:48:36] makes that word live and then again in
[1:48:40] Christ the mystery a great sermon that
[1:48:43] everybody said listened to and if a man
[1:48:45] says he's born again and he tries to
[1:48:47] place these promises of Christ in this
[1:48:50] last day to some other age making him
[1:48:53] Christ yesterday but not today then that
[1:48:56] man or that person it's been an a
[1:48:59] delusion by Satan and if a man says that
[1:49:03] he believes that and it doesn't manifest
[1:49:06] through him Jesus said mark 16 these
[1:49:09] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:49:11] into all the world to every age cast out
[1:49:14] devils speaking with tongues all these
[1:49:16] great manifestation of gifts that would
[1:49:18] follow that they shall not they may be
[1:49:21] they all do they will
[1:49:23] and heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:49:25] his word walked hallelujah a man he come
[1:49:32] right along in his horizon of the Sun
[1:49:34] what was just reading about the dynamics
[1:49:36] he said that gospel came not in the word
[1:49:38] only but through power in manifestation
[1:49:42] of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is
[1:49:44] alive amen he said below I'm so glad
[1:49:49] there is a 10000 octane power is the
[1:49:54] word of God and man I tell you it's
[1:49:57] already been demonstrated to power this
[1:50:00] word man it can create it can heal it
[1:50:04] can save a man they can speak storms out
[1:50:08] of you out of existence somebody help me
[1:50:11] preach a man if there is power that lays
[1:50:14] in this word a 10019 power the Word of
[1:50:19] God oh did you get it and the Holy Ghost
[1:50:24] to light it up it's not just enough to
[1:50:28] have the quotes it's not just enough to
[1:50:31] read Bible verses it's not just enough
[1:50:34] to teach the Bible and teach the message
[1:50:37] it's gotta be priest that means is gonna
[1:50:40] be manifested that demonstrated
[1:50:44] oh yeah he said look there's a 10,000
[1:50:49] octane power the world of God the holy
[1:50:52] gifts to lighted up and resurrect the
[1:50:55] power cord into men's life a woman's
[1:50:57] life into a church that said that
[1:51:00] Cadillac down the road under that
[1:51:01] dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which
[1:51:04] came back and was waved again the day of
[1:51:07] Pentecost making him the same yesterday
[1:51:09] today and forever but the thing of this
[1:51:13] is and God helped me here but wouldn't
[1:51:18] brother Branham left us he left us a car
[1:51:22] that had both mechanics and dynamics but
[1:51:28] somebody turned it off and took away the
[1:51:30] key and said only William Branham could
[1:51:31] drive a car and the car in gonna move no
[1:51:38] Lord until he comes back well I Got News
[1:51:41] for You he ain't coming back until the
[1:51:43] resurrection and after the resurrection
[1:51:48] you know after we've changed we won't
[1:51:50] need to buy in healing we won't need a
[1:51:54] rapture will be in the rapture we won't

[1:51:59] a drive to amen don't put me back to
[1:52:04] horse and buggy don't take put me back
[1:52:06] to an oxcart

[1:52:14] mother we we have got a car that can

[1:52:23] all your children along the way is
[1:52:25] bringing them to
[1:52:27] [Applause]
[1:52:40] [Applause]
[1:52:54] [Applause]
[1:53:31] [Applause]
[1:53:45] that's the thing I battled with
[1:53:48] preachers for years I was told you can't
[1:53:53] even sing only believe because that was
[1:53:55] his theme song well my question is why
[1:53:58] can't it be the bride's theme song why
[1:54:03] can't we be ones who believe hey man I
[1:54:07] was I was told that Kate lay hands on
[1:54:11] the sick that was a brother branham's
[1:54:12] job no he don't tell me I wasn't I was
[1:54:14] there hey man I know what I'm talking
[1:54:17] about and the moment that these are dead
[1:54:22] heads see someone in the driver's seat
[1:54:25] they immediately want to send out a
[1:54:28] warning saying don't try to be brother
[1:54:30] branham there's only one turn age oh
[1:54:34] yeah
[1:54:36] I know there's but one prophet to this
[1:54:38] generation and I'm not stupid enough to
[1:54:40] try to take his place and I know we saw
[1:54:46] demonstrated the maasai sign and there's
[1:54:49] only one of them to generation it was
[1:54:52] shown to Israel in their clothes someday
[1:54:54] it was shown to the Gentiles in our
[1:54:57] closing day it was shown - it was to
[1:55:00] identify to us the word and there will
[1:55:04] be no one else had that sign the
[1:55:07] Messianic sign was given to show us the
[1:55:10] attitude once more time what
[1:55:12] the same attitude that Jesus has toward
[1:55:15] the sick a man took toward the lost
[1:55:18] towards mercy it was to vindicate that
[1:55:22] the word has come and to demonstrate the
[1:55:25] power that lies within the word and then
[1:55:29] we don't have the maasai sign but we do
[1:55:32] have the Messiah a man and and brother
[1:55:37] Bannerman saying God gave us the Messiah
[1:55:39] his promised word for this day and it's
[1:55:43] just waiting for somebody with faith to
[1:55:46] ignore it and they can live again I'm
[1:55:50] going to say we got the message we got
[1:55:53] the word we got the Bible it's unsealed
[1:55:57] it's unveiled oh it's a real Messiah the
[1:56:13] Word of God which Jesus said both
[1:56:16] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:56:19] words shall never pass away but the
[1:56:22] church sits spiritually dead
[1:56:24] the hour has passed them they're in a
[1:56:27] slump
[1:56:28] and hardly know what to do one run in
[1:56:31] this way and the other that way and here
[1:56:34] every promise that God made in the Bible
[1:56:37] every one of them is layin there just as
[1:56:39] good as it ever was
[1:56:41] it's the hour what makes the church like
[1:56:44] this we're in the age of Laodicea when
[1:56:48] when she has to come this way this is an
[1:56:50] hour for it so agree we can't be William
[1:56:55] Branham we will and just let me let me
[1:56:59] just say it like you know let me let me
[1:57:01] mean it like this you know let me get it
[1:57:04] like this I don't think we should try to
[1:57:05] be him I don't think we should
[1:57:08] impersonate him and we're not gonna add
[1:57:11] them aside sign but the Messiah's here
[1:57:15] amen the anointed word and because he is
[1:57:19] here there will be prophecies there will
[1:57:21] be word of knowledge
[1:57:23] there will be word of wisdom there will
[1:57:25] be discerning the spirits and then there
[1:57:28] will be divers high type of tongues and
[1:57:30] interpretation of tongues it will be
[1:57:32] workings of miracles and there will be
[1:57:33] gifts of healing and there will be
[1:57:35] somebody with faith to avoid it to make
[1:57:39] it live again that be a people who can't
[1:57:43] believe and those and there also will be
[1:57:48] those with green-eyed jealousy who want
[1:57:50] to crucify the workings of the Holy
[1:57:52] Ghost amen
[1:57:55] I'll tell you right now I just stop and
[1:57:58] pause and this ain't gonna work well in
[1:58:02] the face of some but I'm praying God
[1:58:05] helped me to be a big man he's in what
[1:58:09] in the world by the Tim you're supposed
[1:58:10] to be humble you're right I'm supposed
[1:58:13] to be a humble I'm to Humble down to
[1:58:15] God's Word but I'm not to Humble down to
[1:58:18] man's ideas
[1:58:20] [Applause]
[1:58:30] here's what a big man is this is what
[1:58:35] I'm praying God helped me to be a big
[1:58:36] man Jesus with his head back walking on
[1:58:40] the priests is screaming at him making
[1:58:42] fun of others called not a crime
[1:58:45] how who's that him but did you notice
[1:58:46] the whole burden of all the world rested
[1:58:49] on him Calvary the dark hours and guests
[1:58:51] simony laid before him in only as he
[1:58:53] went he never noticed their scoffing and
[1:58:57] you know when someone says something
[1:58:59] evil about you and you want to take it
[1:59:01] up and get anger about it that shows you
[1:59:02] hadn't went quite deep enough yet with
[1:59:05] God
[1:59:06] big men don't do those things that's
[1:59:08] what made him God to me he was big he
[1:59:11] didn't have to notice their little
[1:59:13] scoffing he had a purpose he had a work
[1:59:17] to do and that was fulfill what God had
[1:59:20] sent him to do and he was determined to
[1:59:23] do it and he didn't care what anyone
[1:59:24] else said and I say this with respect to
[1:59:28] all I have I've been offered a great
[1:59:30] position in churches if I'd forget about
[1:59:32] divine healing and a good salary and a
[1:59:34] fine home but God sent me to pray for
[1:59:37] sick children it don't make any
[1:59:38] difference what anyone else says I have
[1:59:40] a commission to do and they can say Holy
[1:59:43] Roller or there whatever they wish I've
[1:59:45] got a commission to do and you've got a
[1:59:48] commission to do and everyone that's
[1:59:50] born of the Spirit of God has a
[1:59:52] commission to do it don't make any
[1:59:54] difference what the world says and you
[1:59:56] don't have to notice their scoffing and
[1:59:59] I'm just saying God helped me to be a
[2:00:01] bigger man a man that what I am so big
[2:00:05] till I don't care about the skull fee
[2:00:08] that I got reminder one thing and that's
[2:00:11] the message and that message is that
[2:00:14] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[2:00:18] and forever
[2:00:21] hallelujah and I don't care how much
[2:00:24] were made fun of and call old Mother
[2:00:26] Hubbard because we have a church that is
[2:00:28] given birth to 238 Bible screaming
[2:00:32] yelling children that are live of the
[2:00:34] power glove I don't care what kind of
[2:00:37] name that will attack on us I want to be
[2:00:41] big enough don't notice anybody feel how
[2:00:55] many feels that way the women oh but the
[2:01:23] reason you don't see things happening in
[2:01:24] the church is cause they cling to
[2:01:26] believe in the blood but they reject a
[2:01:29] very plan to get into the blood the word
[2:01:31] a man now listen we got the word sons
[2:01:35] are going to follow the word a man now
[2:01:40] so you see me says no wonder they can't
[2:01:44] believe in miracles no wonder no wonder
[2:01:48] they condemn it and the same reason they
[2:01:52] condemned it back there is the same
[2:01:53] reason they condemn it today they're
[2:01:55] guilty as it can guilty can be because
[2:01:57] only under the shed blood and those who
[2:02:00] would dare would you dare drive that car
[2:02:05] would you dare use that same key and
[2:02:10] turn it on like the Prophet did would
[2:02:15] you dare would you dare oh just sit

[2:07:24] said yeah I said you read the other one

[2:07:50] understand we can sit through three
[2:07:52] hours of a ballgame I understand I
[2:07:58] understand we can sit for hours at a
[2:08:00] movie but I understand the gospel hasn't
[2:08:05] lost its attraction I think brother on

[2:08:42] there was just it wasn't even standing
[2:08:45] room only they were they were around the
[2:08:48] walls up and up and every little crack
[2:08:50] and coroner everywhere I looked out and
[2:08:53] I said huh this looks like a Branham
[2:08:56] meeting to me where people are eager to
[2:08:59] come to church amen Gary stank he says
[2:09:04] to me all the time he drives up 70
[2:09:06] something year old man he'll drive up
[2:09:08] for Manny in here two hours and he'll
[2:09:10] say a church alive was worth the drive a
[2:09:15] lot of you feel the same way sister
[2:09:18] grace tackies from Mississippi drove
[2:09:19] over this morning because the church
[2:09:21] alive was worth the drive a man that's
[2:09:24] way there it ought to be a man a church
[2:09:26] where the power of God is moving are you
[2:09:29] with me and he's heading those who would
[2:09:31] dare some little brother who dares under
[2:09:34] humility to take God at His Word and
[2:09:36] walk out there and confess his sins and
[2:09:39] forget all these dogmas and days and
[2:09:41] stand there under the blood and believe
[2:09:44] it then they want to call him a fanatic
[2:09:47] oh they have crucified the effects of
[2:09:52] the word I got a bunch of scripture on
[2:09:54] that I might quote two or three of them
[2:09:56] they crucify said how do you
[2:09:58] rather than they crucified the word when
[2:09:59] Jesus Christ said he's the same
[2:10:01] yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8
[2:10:04] they say in such a way he is
[2:10:07] and Jesus said his last commandment go
[2:10:10] into all the world mark 16 preach the
[2:10:12] gospel these signs have followed them to
[2:10:14] believe all the world and every creature
[2:10:17] and half of it ain't reached and there's
[2:10:19] millions dying every year that never
[2:10:21] heard the name of Jesus so it's still
[2:10:24] the same general still that General
[2:10:26] Orders it's still a commandment of God
[2:10:29] all the world and preach the gospel to
[2:10:31] every creature he that believeth in his
[2:10:33] baptized shall be saved he that
[2:10:35] believeth not shall be damned and these
[2:10:36] signs have followed them that believe
[2:10:38] are you with me Amen sit still the
[2:10:41] general orders and he said but they say
[2:10:43] that was for that generation and and
[2:10:46] they made the commandment of God of none
[2:10:49] effect to this and they crucified the
[2:10:52] effect you see the crucifixion today is
[2:10:59] not trying to kill the man Jesus but to
[2:11:03] kill the effect of the gospel oh wow
[2:11:11] it's true but oh yeah it worked back
[2:11:16] there but watch out now I'm real you
[2:11:20] know brother Jim you're not supposed to
[2:11:21] drive this car I'm not well who is some
[2:11:27] of you is let it set dead for over 50
[2:11:29] years and ain't went nowhere you ain't
[2:11:34] even got a tire mark to prove you moved
[2:11:37] an inch I'm not trying to be smart I
[2:11:42] mean god help me I'm trying to be big
[2:11:45] I'm trying to say I've got a commission
[2:11:49] and we've got a commission and what
[2:11:54] we're asking this morning is there is a
[2:11:57] church is there people is there bride
[2:12:01] somewhere that has the strength to bring
[2:12:05] forth in the face of all the opposition
[2:12:17] now is there strength to stand and let
[2:12:25] me just tell you we're we're commanded
[2:12:27] to stand
[2:12:28] can I take just a few more minutes all
[2:12:31] right let's go to Joshua one and three
[2:12:33] and let me tell you where we have been
[2:12:36] commanded to stand the position in other
[2:12:40] words we have been commanded to take now
[2:12:45] I am fully convinced that all one man's
[2:12:47] scriptures have been fulfilled and I'm
[2:12:51] not in any way trying to say I'm the
[2:12:52] only driver I'm saying that you've got
[2:12:55] the car to drive your car down to
[2:12:57] healing down to deliverance hey Matt but
[2:13:04] now we have been commanded to stand
[2:13:07] somewhere look at Joshua 1 in 3 every
[2:13:09] place that the sole of your foot shall
[2:13:12] tread upon that I have given to you as I
[2:13:16] said unto Moses so now here's his he
[2:13:20] said I've given you this land I want you
[2:13:24] to go take possession of it man I'll
[2:13:28] tell you we were left a car that would
[2:13:31] run I say let's go take possession of it
[2:13:35] and as I was with Moses brother branham
[2:13:39] would explain this because you know
[2:13:41] immediately someone said out brother to
[2:13:43] him don't go trying to be the Joshua
[2:13:44] well in this case you want to be the
[2:13:46] Joshua you understand where Joshua's to
[2:13:50] it are you with me because he said it
[2:13:53] was then again Josh would the new
[2:13:55] commander to lead an army the second
[2:13:58] place the second to the place were a
[2:14:01] great
[2:14:02] like Moses stood it was no little task
[2:14:05] and I think of a minister today
[2:14:09] that's called a God to step into the
[2:14:13] tracks what Jesus stood what a command
[2:14:18] what a commission but each that's called
[2:14:23] of God is commissioned to stand in that
[2:14:25] same place I'll be with you even in you
[2:14:29] to the end of the world
[2:14:30] each Minister is called to stand where
[2:14:33] he would the works that I do say you do
[2:14:36] also its ministers ordained of God and
[2:14:39] is commanded to stand in the tracks of
[2:14:42] Jesus Christ and perform those duties
[2:14:44] that Jesus performed that quite a
[2:14:48] command
[2:14:50] Amen so don't tell me don't tell me John
[2:14:54] 14:12 is not for me oh yeah oh yeah
[2:14:58] although I do have a book in my library
[2:15:00] that was put out by message preacher
[2:15:02] many many years ago they said John 14:12
[2:15:05] is only for brother branham night
[2:15:09] collects dust in my office and it's a
[2:15:12] relic that are I never reference because
[2:15:16] I know better
[2:15:17] I left that book far behind a man
[2:15:23] because John 14:12 says the works that I
[2:15:26] do shall you do also and greater works
[2:15:31] than these how you do because I go unto
[2:15:34] my father are you with me oh man so
[2:15:37] Jesus made it personal to ever
[2:15:39] individual and that's why brother
[2:15:41] Branham would make it personal to ever
[2:15:43] individual a man so but every minister
[2:15:46] every minister is ordained of God
[2:15:49] commanded to stand in the tracks of
[2:15:52] Jesus Christ and perform the duties that
[2:15:55] Jesus performed
[2:15:56] that's quite a command he said we also
[2:16:00] find Joshua knowing his commission
[2:16:02] knowing it laid his hand God had called
[2:16:05] him for duty then he must not fail he
[2:16:08] walked softly before God and when he
[2:16:10] called the people together and told him
[2:16:12] that God had Commission and what's the
[2:16:14] costs of the people they said we'll
[2:16:16] follow you as we did Moses if we can see
[2:16:20] the same thing that followed Moses
[2:16:23] following you only be strong and
[2:16:26] courageous and that ought to be the
[2:16:29] requirement of ever born again person
[2:16:31] today if we're requested to follow then
[2:16:34] let's see the signs follow the believers
[2:16:38] as Jesus said the things that I do say
[2:16:42] you do also notice every believer
[2:16:46] somebody women now every believer is to
[2:16:49] stand in those steps and he said every
[2:16:53] one of must do they said to Joshua if
[2:16:56] you if we seek God is with you as he was
[2:17:00] with Moses now Joshua didn't do the same
[2:17:04] science as Moses he didn't use the rod
[2:17:08] like Moses he didn't call frogs like
[2:17:12] Moses he didn't imitate Moses he just
[2:17:15] did what he was called to do are you
[2:17:19] with me and he said if we're requested
[2:17:22] to follow then let's see the signs
[2:17:24] follow the believer you're asking you're
[2:17:29] asking for others to follow
[2:17:31] well let's just let's see the signs of a
[2:17:33] Christian let's see the holiness of God
[2:17:36] let's see the honesty let's see the
[2:17:40] purity let's see the righteousness you
[2:17:43] want others to follow you you know you
[2:17:46] want your children to follow in your
[2:17:47] footsteps and then let's see that same
[2:17:52] thing that was in Jesus living in you
[2:17:55] then you'll be alive worthy of following
[2:17:58] are you with me not just went ahead to
[2:18:01] take this command and then the people
[2:18:03] said go let God be with you as he was
[2:18:05] with Moses and we all know that the same
[2:18:07] spirit that led us thus far can take his
[2:18:10] own oh how the church ought to look this
[2:18:12] morning to find the spirit working among
[2:18:15] the people if you want to church home
[2:18:18] where the spirit that raised Christ from
[2:18:21] that they had the Holy Spirit that I
[2:18:23] move among the people that's that's the
[2:18:26] spirit that's raised
[2:18:28] God's raisin up in the last day to take
[2:18:30] a people over into the other land into
[2:18:34] the full promise of all the blessings of
[2:18:36] God and did a book a mission that he
[2:18:38] gave and the promise the promise is unto
[2:18:40] you and do your children a man some
[2:18:44] brother renders any of you if you want a
[2:18:46] church home where the sphere of God and
[2:18:48] that's what I think we want a man we
[2:18:51] want a church home or preachers are
[2:18:53] anointed they don't just get up and read
[2:18:57] you and do your little sermon but our
[2:18:59] mountain there's a fire shut up in their
[2:19:02] bones you know somebody said to me this
[2:19:11] week's and and I don't mean to get into
[2:19:14] it was just something negative here on
[2:19:17] this at all but somebody said something
[2:19:20] me this week said you know said Tim
[2:19:23] there are those it said of you it's just
[2:19:26] your ego what you wanted this big church
[2:19:29] I said my ego I was my my goodness I I
[2:19:36] was happy where I was if God hadn't
[2:19:39] given me a divine command to go and do
[2:19:41] something and then God was with me every
[2:19:44] step of the way until this building is
[2:19:47] totally debt-free with miracle after
[2:19:49] miracle after miracle and it was my ego
[2:19:52] as to what they call ego is God's zeal a
[2:19:58] man they're mistaken what it is it's not
[2:20:01] an ego it's God zeal I said because I
[2:20:04] was jealous for his people because I
[2:20:08] wanted God's people to be able to gather
[2:20:11] together in our foul meetings see the
[2:20:13] sphere of God move and as faster others
[2:20:16] were invited to come because we had a
[2:20:19] vision besides us for and no more amen
[2:20:24] because I was going to make sure it
[2:20:26] wasn't just a family church but it was a
[2:20:28] family of God Church and it would be run
[2:20:31] by the Holy Ghost I say this melody go
[2:20:33] it's the seal it's the sea
[2:20:36] God and God put a righteous seal in
[2:20:39] every believer there oughta be a seal to
[2:20:43] get to the house of God there will be a
[2:20:46] seal to read your Bible to hear the word
[2:20:49] of God preached hallelujah you are
[2:20:52] people of zeal that's why you see their
[2:20:55] service after service and you can sit on
[2:20:58] the edge of your seat and you're not
[2:21:00] playing around with your phone or you're
[2:21:02] not to communicate in something else and
[2:21:04] working somewhere else doing something
[2:21:06] else in your mind you're right here in
[2:21:08] the service pulling on the gift of God
[2:21:11] because your people that's Jesus heal
[2:21:25] the sick raise the dead
[2:21:28] [Applause]
[2:21:40] my brother branham would say Joshua in
[2:21:43] all is knowing that the command was
[2:21:45] great but having the assurance that he
[2:21:48] could be fearless he could be and we
[2:21:52] call it reckless well I've always been
[2:21:56] kind of reckless when I was out in the
[2:21:59] middle of the country and you know where
[2:22:02] it was where the GPS couldn't find us
[2:22:04] and I had a little church there in the
[2:22:07] back way in the backwoods people around
[2:22:11] here Wonderworld all these people come
[2:22:13] from we built this building that was
[2:22:14] filled up Hey where in the world well
[2:22:18] we'd been out in the country started
[2:22:22] there in 1972 and all the old abandoned
[2:22:28] building you know baptist preacher come
[2:22:32] there for a funeral and I opened it up
[2:22:34] by that time we had we were running
[2:22:35] water in a toilet there's some people
[2:22:38] thought we were unspiritual for heaven
[2:22:48] if adolescent discovers you wouldn't
[2:22:52] even have a toilet and baptist preacher
[2:23:03] come in looked around he said son he was
[2:23:07] there to preach a funeral I was there to
[2:23:10] open up the building for for the
[2:23:12] convenience of the of the people of the
[2:23:15] mourners that come he come looked around
[2:23:18] he said son I sure AM a sure admire your
[2:23:22] courage come look at him I said courage
[2:23:27] what in the world are you talking about
[2:23:29] courage
[2:23:30] he said the courage to come out here in
[2:23:33] the sticks like this and start a church
[2:23:37] that's courage
[2:23:39] you see it don't fit
[2:23:43] but I knew if I would preach the word
[2:23:47] people will come now people got that the
[2:23:51] opposite they think if you preach the
[2:23:53] word won't nobody be there but I Got
[2:23:55] News for you but I was fearless and
[2:24:19] brother branham's and I was reckless
[2:24:22] I'll be honest with you I was reckless I
[2:24:25] didn't know any better I didn't know you
[2:24:28] were supposed to go and scout out how
[2:24:30] many people lives in this place and you
[2:24:33] know and then decide if that would
[2:24:35] support a church or not and you do all
[2:24:37] of the math and and figured out and you
[2:24:41] know for all the people that because
[2:24:43] they won't drive more than 15 minutes or
[2:24:46] else he'll go to the next church he's
[2:24:48] closer that's America that's America
[2:24:55] hey man so I didn't know to do all that
[2:25:00] so I was reckless
[2:25:01] I was fearless I didn't have no fear I
[2:25:08] just did what God called me to do that
[2:25:11] chips follower than me some people say
[2:25:14] well brother Tim you know you how long
[2:25:17] you been a pastor well I said you know
[2:25:19] the reason I'm a pastor I preached in
[2:25:21] one place for too long some people came
[2:25:27] but you have to be you have to be
[2:25:29] realized your commission you got a job
[2:25:31] to do
[2:25:32] you got something that you're called to
[2:25:34] do and you got to be courageous and
[2:25:37] fearless and willing to take the SKA
[2:25:41] theme because others are not going to
[2:25:45] understand your vision
[2:25:48] and others don't understand my vision of
[2:25:51] a bride with power others don't
[2:25:55] understand my vision of a place where
[2:25:58] Devils are cast out that they're not
[2:26:01] just coddled and allowed to sit on the
[2:26:04] pig on the Pew and feel our young people
[2:26:07] and possess their lives and pull them
[2:26:09] away in the sand but we can have a the
[2:26:12] power of God that will cast Satan out
[2:26:15] [Applause]
[2:26:17] hallelujah
[2:26:19] hey man and you don't understand my seal
[2:26:22] my seal is to see young people barred
[2:26:25] Amen ago people born I'm an adult so
[2:26:29] just taking Jesus as their Savior to
[2:26:32] come out a little further and be filled
[2:26:35] with the Holy Ghost and be born of the
[2:26:37] breath of God a man that may be a little
[2:26:41] reckless and may take courage but friend
[2:26:44] I know it's a reason because I got a
[2:26:46] commission and my commission is that
[2:26:48] God's Word won't fail and it's gonna
[2:26:50] have a bride and she will be without
[2:26:53] spot or wrinkle and that there will be a
[2:26:57] bride that will be as she was at
[2:26:59] Pentecost that will welcome back the
[2:27:02] Lord Jesus Christ I want to know is
[2:27:05] there straight is it somewhere or there
[2:27:09] others around the world today this here
[2:27:12] yes I have found the strength to make
[2:27:15] one more push to move with your spirit
[2:27:19] one more time
[2:27:20] Oh breathe breath of God fill the house
[2:27:23] with your presence fill the church young
[2:27:27] people people put a seal in them
[2:27:31] take out the slothy laodicea out of
[2:27:34] their lives that replace it with it
[2:27:36] Ginuwine Xia but seal double repent but
[2:27:40] feel that a humble down to the word seal
[2:27:43] clapping leaving
[2:27:50] so can the Church of the Living God be
[2:27:54] reckless and fearless in faith if we're
[2:27:57] pointing the right way and I'll tell you
[2:28:00] friends I don't care how you counted you
[2:28:02] may have your favorite quote but I'll
[2:28:04] tell you I've got word after word of a
[2:28:07] thousand teen power in its word so that
[2:28:18] could be reason in the party salvation
[2:28:20] and the few ultra power sinners with the
[2:28:24] way to Calvary where demons are cast out
[2:28:27] and the people of God walking at freedom

[2:31:33] people we don't notice a scuffle
[2:31:37] we just look at the promise oh yeah I
[2:31:41] know
[2:31:43] the mechanics without the dynamics is no
[2:31:46] good neither is dynamics without the
[2:31:49] mechanics as all sermons that we could
[2:31:53] preach it takes two wings to fly it
[2:31:59] takes spirit and it takes truth truth
[2:32:04] alone won't do it spirit alone look good
[2:32:06] for the car it's got to have the
[2:32:09] mechanics thank God for the word but
[2:32:15] it's also has to have the dynamics
[2:32:18] brother branham's would say you could
[2:32:20] scream and shout and jump up and down
[2:32:22] all you want to and deny the word it
[2:32:23] won't do any good you just cranking the
[2:32:25] Pistons you got to spark there to fire
[2:32:28] but no gasoline to fire by
[2:32:32] it only work as they come together we
[2:32:36] want to be a balanced Church we don't go
[2:32:39] off to the right or to the left we just
[2:32:42] want to walk with Jesus we want to see
[2:32:45] him in our lives see move maybe today is
[2:32:52] we just bow our heads just for a moment
[2:32:54] let me just talk to you just a second
[2:32:58] we're in this church you didn't
[2:33:00] understand everything I said maybe you
[2:33:03] couldn't brother Tim and really things
[2:33:07] that you talked about I I don't quite
[2:33:10] see that way I don't quite understand I
[2:33:15] I'm trying to get a little picture of it
[2:33:19] but there's one thing I really want I
[2:33:22] really want to see Jesus I really want
[2:33:27] to see Jesus
[2:33:32] you seem to know him his life that's
[2:33:36] what you gotta knows him if you would
[2:33:40] like to know live not Church not a good
[2:33:46] preacher not just a noisy box for this a
[2:33:52] lot of freedom people get attracted to
[2:33:54] that some of them are like you know get
[2:34:00] attracted don't understand what it's all
[2:34:04] about but if I can get you to get in
[2:34:07] love with Jesus thank you just get you
[2:34:11] to love him with all your heart with all
[2:34:14] your soul with all this within you won't
[2:34:19] you just look at your life today and
[2:34:21] compare it there's a sign of a Christian
[2:34:24] follow you maybe your mom or dad and you
[2:34:28] want your children to follow you in
[2:34:30] righteousness but no can they follow
[2:34:33] your life is the works that Jesus done
[2:34:38] being done in you is this love being
[2:34:41] manifested this faith is the fruits and
[2:34:48] won't you ask him today what did you ask
[2:34:51] you Lord really I want to see you I want
[2:34:57] you to be the Lord of my life
[2:34:59] would you'd be the ruler over everything
[2:35:01] want you to be in my life she'd be in my
[2:35:05] heart
[2:35:06] do you take sin and darkness from me and
[2:35:09] put in there a real faith to believe
[2:35:10] every promise Lord if I have to start
[2:35:14] making baby steps toward you I'll I'll
[2:35:16] do whatever if I have to run I'll run
[2:35:18] whatever I do I'm doing it but but I
[2:35:21] don't want to have a seal I want to have
[2:35:24] a seal to do right
[2:35:26] if their heads are bowed in your
[2:35:28] thoughts of the Lord just a moment maybe
[2:35:31] you might just want to put a hand up
[2:35:33] toward God and say Lord come by my way
[2:35:36] today be real to me Lord I know a little
[2:35:44] bit about the word but I want that
[2:35:47] dynamic power of the Holy Ghost gonna
[2:35:50] changed my life don't be the same person
[2:35:54] I was when I come here I won't be new
[2:35:56] I'm God to forgive me of all my sins
[2:35:59] watch me make me pure cleanse me he sees
[2:36:06] you he sees your hand going out to him
[2:36:08] now you just keep that in faith right
[2:36:11] now and so we believe got together
[2:36:14] though Jesus
[2:36:17] is a step towards righteousness Nord
[2:36:23] it's a confession under salvation you
[2:36:28] said except we be born of the water in
[2:36:30] the spirit and we must be first must
[2:36:33] have that word portion of our birth
[2:36:36] where our faith is based on the word and
[2:36:38] what you said and I pray O God today
[2:36:42] that you'll take every sin of theirs and
[2:36:45] forgive them and remove it as far as the
[2:36:47] East is from the West put in the sea of
[2:36:51] your forgetfulness that is no more
[2:36:54] remembered against them anymore I would
[2:36:57] pray Lord that also that you do such a
[2:37:00] work in your children and in these lives
[2:37:03] that you to lead the moon to where
[2:37:07] they're not just get the water part when
[2:37:09] they have the word but the Spirit of God
[2:37:12] brings an awakening and a realization
[2:37:16] then a spark in their life of real life
[2:37:19] or they scream out they scream out that
[2:37:24] they love you with all their heart their
[2:37:26] whole life demonstrates it to a world
[2:37:30] the thing that we can see Jesus I pray
