father these are your people father speak we pray lord speak lord and give us life from your word we pray in jesus name amen amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen you can turn in your bibles to deuteronomy 31. amen is nothing quite like your ipad deleting your notes amen so what do you do you find the scripture amen i want to just key in on that song he never left me i mean thankful he never left you he could have walked away but he never left you i just believe it's just the lord tonight amen be strong and courageous be not afraid or terrified because of them for the lord your god goes with you he will never leave you or forsake you amen you can be seated he's never left me he's never left you he's always been there with you every step of the way you know god asks for confidence in him to trust him and it's easy to trust him when you're going through on top of the mountain and you're having a wonderful day and everything's been going very good and all's rosy and singing the songs and shouting the victories but he also wants you to trust him when you're going through your darkest valleys truly that's where trust is really built is when you don't feel him you don't know he's there you maybe can't see see him anywhere around you but you know he's there how do you know he's there because his word says he's there and you know it's very it's very important to believe in him especially in the day we an hour that we live in you know and so to do that you got to understand who you are and also understand who he is because he will not let his word go unfulfilled he will fulfill it he will promise it he promised to keep it and that was going to be my title tonight the promise keeper but he promises that he will keep his word he will not let one jot or one tittle go unfulfilled in other words he will not even let a dot that goes over an eye be unfulfilled but even the smallest portion of his word god is concerned about and i'm thinking about that tonight because if you feel to be the least in the kingdom of god then you also have this confidence that god is concerned about you god knows about you he knows your needs he knows your struggles he knows exactly what you're going through and he knows on a wednesday night that you're down in the valley but he wants to come and tell you again he's never left you but he's walking with you and he's leading you and he's guiding you know i know right now that we're living in a very dark time and it seems impossible and possible situations are going on around us just hearing of all the deaths that are taking place just brother brother erickson's church was seemingly facing death after death four in the last few weeks and and brother david kegley had told me about his dad and that was mom he found her on the floor and it seems like in those moments that you're all alone it seems like that's the darkest times and it's around you and there's no help for you there's no no no nothing that can go on maybe you've done something wrong but you have not done something wrong god is wanting to show you that in your darkest moments he won't leave you amen he's allowing the bride of christ to come to the darkest time that there's ever been amen even even the dark ages was dark but it's not been as dark as it is now to where there's not even hardly a hope or or a glimpse of of righteousness or or a glimpse of holiness anymore so dark around us and so he would allow it to be in this valley that he could prove his word over and over again i'll never leave you but i'll be with you amen and he would build a society you know the society would live in amen the bar is set on how much you can earn or how much you can accumulate and your accomplishments and what you do and you they're lauded you know above everything about what you've done and how you've done it it's put above amen even the god-ordained purposes in our lives very often people have a hard time taking god at his word and if god's but if god says it that settles it if god says it it doesn't there's no need to ever doubt it because he will bring it to pass amen so we read here he promised them that they're going to go into this place and it's going to be battles they're going to go in there there's going to be high walls they're going to go in there there's going to be giants they're going to go in there and there's going to be impossible situations there's going to be high mountains with giants that have lived there for years and years and they've been happy living in that land but you have been commissioned to go in there and cast them out and you're not going alone but i'm going to go with you and i'm going to be with you in a trial i'm going to be with you in the fire i'm going to be with you in your trouble i'm going to be with you when you face that giant of cancer was he not with you sister atlanta hey remember that giant would step out with those priestly robes and try to scare the liver out of you but he couldn't scheme i could scare you but he could not scare the god that was in you but the god that was in you would rise up and begin to pulsate in your life until you can call i mean come with assurance that god is with me i might have cancer god is with me i might have every kind of sickness god is with me i might not have a dollar in my account but god is with me i'm not looking at me looking at an impossible situation but god is with me walls may be thick all around me and it seems impossible but god is with me [Applause] hallelujah you might be one of those seeds like rahab that was calling that wall and there seemed to be no self for her and there seemed to be no hope for her her life was wrecked and her life was shot and it was no hope for her but one day a messenger came to her and began to tell her the good news amen it wasn't just a god of history but it's a god of today and he gave her a token a covenant and said if you put it in your door you and your family will be saved amen it gives me courage to know that even rahab god didn't leave her god didn't forsake her it was only one or maybe maybe two or maybe three but god i tear the walls down to go get his children that gives me so much confidence in the hour that we're living in we know of some ray halves we know of some people that have sold their birthright but they ain't enough big enough walls that god won't knock it down and go to where they are and prove again over and over i never left you to my tonight they might be saying god's left me he's a million miles away i ain't felt them in years but i'm here to tell you once again god's never left you [Applause] but in this time we have a hard time taking god at his word you know why because we're relying so much on this right here or this right here in our minds and it's the world has been built to where the standards are are are the earthly accomplishments and the worldly standards and all these things are placed above amen the call of god you know because he would say it again in hebrews 13 5. he says keep your lives free from the love of money oh yeah and be content with what you have because god has said amen why does he want you to get away and not be have a love of money because if you have a love of money then money is your god and money becomes your everything therefore it doesn't hurt to miss what miss church on sunday because you got a greater god come on now hey man you got someone some money in the bank and you got confidence in in something more than but listen god does not want you to have confidence in something that's temporary because we know goodwill the money that we have today is temporary you can have it stacked up to the ceiling in every room in your house and he'd never sock in your drawer but it's temporary amen one day maybe i won't even be able to buy anything amen money can become worthless overnight but people get so involved and chasing after it and that's their god and they'll destroy friendships over money amen amen over money they'll destroy friendships and then they'll have it to in their heart but why because they love it so much because it's their god but he said don't do that because i have said i will never leave you when money leaves you i'll still be there hallelujah when troubles come i'll still be there listen you serve a god amen that can get you out of a trouble that money can't get you out of listen well steve jobs was talking about the other night he had that uh pancreas cancer listen if there had been a cure he had enough money to buy it but money couldn't get him there amen no doubt he spent a lot of his wealth searching after it and wanting it and desiring it wanting to live wanting to go a little further wanting to be a little more i wanted to go another month another day whatever another hour whatever money was worthless to him in those moments amen but see this god can get you out of trouble amen where money can't get you out it'll get you healing when money can't get you healing amen this god will get you joy when money can't get you joy it'll get you happiness when happy that when when this world can't get you that hallelujah amen this god he promised us he promises no matter how long we go we may go 10 more years five more years i don't know how far we're going and it's going to get harder and it's going to get harder and it's going to get harder but his word will remain the same he will never leave you he'll be with you he'll guide you he'll hold you he'll keep you deuteronomy 31 6 was written to encourage the children of israel as they're getting ready to go across into some great battles into some great wars and some really hardships some big trials through some difficult times through loss of loved ones amen through tragic tragedies and and through killings and all kinds of things and he was trying to show them right at the beginning you're going to go through some things but i'm going to be with you you're going to go through things but i'm going to be there you're going to go through a valley but i'm going to be there amen you're going to go have you're going to have problems and situations you know he would also tell it he would tell it to joshua amen in joshua 10 and verse let me go let me go down and see we go it would go to tell him to joshua because joshua would begin to fight and joshua would go and he would come against five kings and he would come against all the walls and he would come against ai and he he would face defeated ai but he knew when he faced defeated ai something was wrong because god promised him i'll be with you he went through all kinds of things he told it to solomon he told it to solomon in first chronicles 22 and verse 13 says you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the lord gave moses be strong and courageous do not be afraid or discouraged david would say it again in 28 20 said be strong and courageous do the work or play the man do not be afraid or discouraged for the lord god my god is with you he will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the lord is finished hallelujah we can take that scripture for us tonight because there's a building that's taking place right now it's the building of the body of christ and his word will remain to say all the way to the last support the last stone is put in position to the last part is there whatever it is if it's a stone if it's a piece of timber whatever it is it's going to hold there and it's going to remain i will not forsake my bride i'll be with her when she needs healing i'll be with her when she needs deliverance i'll be with her when she needs comfort i am the comforter the old testament is full of insurmountable challenges but god wanted them to know that no matter how big the challenge you could trust him for complete victory it was a call for trust and i feel like we're hearing that same call we're going through some really tough times economically things are happening situations we don't know what tomorrow holds he would tell it again to hezekiah and ii chronicles 32 said be strong and courageous do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of assyria and the vast army with him for there is a greater power with you than there is with him if you can understand that tonight boy you would go out here shouting a victory because no matter what you're facing it may seem to be an insurmountable odd but there's a greater power with you amen sister sister ruth you have been facing a very dark trial but there's a greater power with you amen you may be facing something in your family and you don't know the answer to but there's a greater power with you than all that surrounds you and all the problems around you and everything around you even if that enemy begins to begin to say and mock you and make fun of you and say see i told you he's just the god of the hills and he's not the god of the valleys i told you he's only god when you're singing the praises and you're up on top of the mountain and you got up this morning and nothing went wrong and you checked your bank account and it slammed full amen you got it overflowing coming out your ears money in the bank and no jobs lined up for days oh it's so wonderful i told you he's god there but now you're in the valley now you're in a dark time now you're going through a trouble now deaths have hit the church now problems is all around you see i told you he's only a god at youth camp he's only a god at meetings he's only a guard at special services but on a wednesday night i told you you're going to go there and you're not going to get nothing because you're in a valley but the lord heard your enemy tonight he said you tell their enemy i'm not just the god of the mountain i'm also the god in the valley hallelujah i'm not just a god when you're singing my praises i'm still god when you can't say a word i'm still a god when you're all down and you're all depressed and you don't know which return i'm still god i'm not just god when your family's sitting on the front row and they're all serving god but i'm still god when one's in a bar room one's lost over here one's lost over there i have not forgot them but i am a god in your valley be strong and courageous i'm not just a god when you've been dancing around in youth camp and you guessed the victory over that devil and you he lost his victory over you but i'm also the god when you're going through your hallways at school or you're riding by yourself in the car or you don't know where your next job's coming from i'm still the same yesterday today and forever i will not chase i have no chance i was gone on this sunday morning when a little friend woman got out of that pew and she ran around that building and she gave god praise leaning on me everlasting odds but tonight in your valley i'm still a god you can lean on i'm still a god you can trust i'm still a god it's a victory it's tonight for you you don't have to be afraid you don't have to be discouraged god's promises are always or never [Applause] therefore he can be fully trusted blessed be the name of the lord the bible says god is not human that he should lie he's not a human being that he should change his mind does he speak and then does he not act does he promise and not fulfill you know i need some answers to that tonight god is not human that he should lie we had a human being he full of lies can't hold some some of them can't even hardly tell the truth because the truth ain't in them a human will lie to you tell you you're his best friend the next day hate you like you was a murderer sad to say that's even in church but we got but god's not a human thank you god he became human but he's not a human therefore god don't change his mind thank you god so therefore if god chose you before the foundation of the world he cannot unchoose you [Applause] even though you tried to walk away even though you took the wrong road even though tonight you might be on the wrong road he can't un-choose you even though you're going the wrong direction even though you've posted stupid stuff on facebook we're gonna get it where we live at even though you've done all kinds of things he can't unchoose you know to give some shouting shoes to somebody tonight god cannot unchoose you he cannot say you're my child one day and the next day or the next hour or the next minute or the next second say you're not my child but if he chose you before the foundation of the world [Applause] you will be chose until there's no more until we step into eternity and all through eternity god cannot unchoose you he cannot change his mind therefore when you go down the wrong road he's not going to turn and walk away oh my god how many times have you realized in your life you were walking down the wrong way but somehow he still touched you that's because he didn't turn around and walk the other way and say i give up on him i'm tired of him i don't want him no more i hear i've told him i tried i've done everything but i give up on him i'm walking away he's like no he sees you walking away and he just still follows you he's still walking with you he's still talking to you he's still guiding you no don't get that far over there come on back over here not not that far get back over here and you keep feeling these you think it's rather just me it's just my who i am no god is still choosing you there he cannot say i don't want him no more yeah y'all don't understand i have tried all day long i have tried all week long i've tried in the last few days to get something to preach tonight and i thought i had it and my ipad said nope come on might have been an angel again all i know is it deleted it and i was back there what am i going to do what am i going to do and these words been rolling through my head all day he never left me can i be real honest with you just this week driving down the road i said lord i'm ready to give up i'm done he never left me he was still there he was still there all the time he's still moving still coming on the scene still operating still touching still directing still doing things when you've given up you probably gave up this week yourself and though i'll never go back to the service but he was still directing he was still nudging and he was still pushing and here you are tonight i think about it i i i listen i heard that song so many years ago and it touched me i sent it to brother phillip he never sang it but i guess god was saving it for tonight so i sent it to him today i said look man you got sing this song i've been listening to it over and over and over and i i i just need to hear it and i believe you're the man for it because i remember a time in his life he went the wrong way he'd went down the wrong path he'd went down the wrong place but god never left him he might have thought he had he might have given up on him he said i'll never go back but god was still nudging god was still pushing god was still coming god was still every angle god was directing god was orchestrating that life until one night on a wednesday night he was sitting there and he looked at his families they're about to walk out the door and he said if you'll wait for me i'll go with you [Applause] what was it god never left him he may have left god but god didn't leave him every one of us can testify the same thing we all had moments in our life we pulled away but god didn't leave us god was right there for us he came to that church service on a wednesday night and guess who was preaching guess who was raised up with him all his life guess who fought with him in the backyard god's doing something nowadays man back in our dark days we had fights every service i ain't talking about just me and brother phillip i'm just talking about fights i'm thankful we ain't got some kind of kids no more he's sitting back there he's discouraged and he's aggravated he's like brother timothy's preaching why did i come can't they say anything i'm just trying to remember his own testimony i think i got it pretty close he said he said can't they say anything new anymore i've heard this before but see god was orchestrated god was moving because here i am i just went through a situation in my life and on a saturday morning i was studying again trying to come up with something like on a four sunday night communion service and i couldn't i had a thought on the god we could rely on but i couldn't i couldn't get it together i couldn't it wasn't nothing to delete so the kids went out to play some disc golf out the state park and i told ruth i said let's go get some hamburgers and some buns and let's go cook them barbecue out there and let's just get away from here i i ain't doing no good here anyway so we went out there and uh some of my youngest i think it was andrew and it was pretty young at that time and grabbed the rip sticks and throw them in the car and we get there do you realize what's going on the whole time god is nudging god is moving god because if i don't get there and go through this situation i'm not going to be preaching what i'm going to preach on wednesday night and it wasn't an easy situation it was a terrifying situation my little girl adriana goes down a hill the wrong way down the wrong path thinking she's trying to snowboard on asphalt and she don't make a curve and she goes down a parking lot ends up flying 30 feet through the air smacks into a brick into a steel pole with her head and just goes flying dirt and stuff all over and i come down to her and she's out of it and she's just got this rattle in her throat and her eyes are rolled in the back of her head and i just ease her onto her back just make sure her airways are clear and i'm talking to her adriana talk to me baby talk to me talk to me talk to him and then she she go daddy i can't see and i look at her eyes across from hitting her head and her head's all swolled out and i said lord i'm here on this place not by happenstance i don't believe i said i'm just like that man that was with your prophet who got the bit on the foot with a snake so we're not out here doing anything wrong we're out here enjoying nature enjoying some time of fellowship i'm asking that the same god that took that poison out of that life will take the the hurt and the pain and the call all the things that it's causing away from my little girl in jesus name amen and i looked down and then my eyes uncrossed and she said daddy i can't see you and i bowed my head and i prayed again i said father she can't see you you uncrossed her eyes well you now give her a sight and she goes daddy i see you now but she couldn't remember nothing for 20 minutes she couldn't remember what had happened and she's screaming why am i here what's up with this what's wrong with my feet do i still have feet she had been wearing flip-flops and they'd tore off some yards back and her feet was skinned up ambulance came as we're putting her in ambulance her mind starts sparking again and she remembers what she had done played disc golf did this this so we let her go sister ruth jumps in with her i get in the van i believe the ladies were there and took some of our kids brother james sister jeannie sister jenny and then brother matthew was there i believe also he called brother tim and he told brother tim brother tim picks up the phone hears the news closes the phone and says hangs it up and says lord let there not be one broke bone what a prayer because it looked like everything was messed up gets to the hospital they don't find one sign of a broke bone one sign of a concussion done cat scans x-rays all this kind of stuff the doctor said look we're going to be taking your word that you saw or knocked out but we cannot we cannot find one sign of a concussion there's nothing there hallelujah well on the way to the hospital i was praising god for what i just saw i saw a little girl going down the wrong path and seemingly go down to our destruction and in a moment god turn it around and her come back to herself and i'm still got my hand in there and i'm praising god tears are coming down my eyes and all of a sudden i hear my voice speak and it says what you see in the natural you'll also see in the supernatural hallelujah that's sunday night i get up and i give the testimony she spent the night saturday night in the hospital they dismissed her right after the sunday service i brought her to church said that very next service and i'm giving thou i don't need notes i've witnessed a god i can rely on and i could say he never left me but he was right there on that shore with me as i was knelt over my daughter the angel of god was right there and not only was he there he was some miles over in athens louisiana had a little house where a man had went down a wrong path and he found himself in amnesia and he found himself lost but he found himself on a wednesday night in a church service and i'm speaking on spiritual amnesia spiritual identity crisis i'm speaking on that and i was saying she's saying well i've done heard all this and heard all this and i come down to the end of it and i talk about the french soldier who got off the got off the train and he's looking around he's seeing a few things familiar around there and the guard is watching him as he begins to walk and he walks over a little no he said what was it he said there was a little water tower there that got us attention and there happened to be the same thing that was going on at brother phillips a water tower outside of his house and god was getting his attention god was moving on him and here he thought god left me i left him a long time ago you may have left god but god never left you he's been walked with you every mile of the way he was with you in every conversation he was with you in every trial he was with you in every trouble and that night he found himself in an altar but the best thing is god never changed his mind about it ought to give hope to anyone tonight any prodigal doesn't matter if you've been gone five months five days or five years or 10 years or 100 years it don't matter whatever you are tonight god has never left you he never left the prodigal son he was right there nudging him when he was even in the hog pit [Applause] what gave him the unction to come to himself and say hey there's better food in my father's house i'm going to go home and be a servant but the father hasn't changed his mind about him i'll tell you what if he ever comes back he's going to be a servant i'm going to put him he's going to wash the dishes and he's going to make up for all the amends and he's going to make up for this and he going i'll tell you what that low down sorry no good for nothing joker that wasn't a father's attitude i'll tell you what it done something to me the other night brother gabriel told that part about why the father ran because he had to get to him before the townspeople did i'm so glad he got to me before anyone else did that he threw that robe of adoption around me that robe of of a royalty around me his robe and said hey get the party started kill the fatted cast one that's been lost has come home again hallelujah listen if you're out there and you're wondering well people they're gonna think i'm crazy they're gonna call me a bunch of low down nothing for all i know we're not we're ready to put a robe around you we're ready to welcome you back to the father's house we're ready to say welcome home why can you say that because i'm saying what the father said it was a call to trust amid great adversity a few verses later he would say again the lord himself goes before you and be with you he will never leave you nor forsake you don't be afraid don't be discouraged when we promise we promise always or never most of the time we can't keep it things happen humanity humans something called being a human that's why the saiyan would say never say never because just as soon as you say never i'll never marry somebody younger than me i'll never never marry a bald-headed man these are some i've heard and it happened i'd never marry him anyone that's got ugly feet i ain't heard that one but just in case you never say never because you're human but god can say never and it be never. or he can say therefore he can say i will never forsake you and he don't kind of come back and say well i shouldn't have said never man what was i thinking i messed up big time no god doesn't matt it doesn't matter where you go his word remains the same if you're his child it will never forsake you you can say well i'm just going to go out and i'm going to make my own life and i'm going to be my own person and but if you're a child of god you're going to be one of the most miserable people on the face of the earth because this word will never leave you you go to drink something it'll be in your ear you go to smoke something it'll be in your ear you're going to cut your hair off it'll be in your ear it will never leave you god's promises are always and never therefore he can be fully trusted to honor his word he can be fully trusted he would say it even to abraham he said behold i'm with you and will keep you wherever you go and bring you back to this land and i will never leave you until i've done what i've promised to you god stands with his word therefore he stands with his children therefore you can go through the roughest waters of your life he'll be there you can go through cancer he'll be there you can go through troubles of life that it seems like there ain't no way this is gonna ever work out that ain't what god says god says there is a way i am the way i will make a way where there seems to be no way therefore he's the waymaker he's a miracle worker he's a promise keeper and even when you don't see him working i wonder this move this even in this week or maybe this month you said lord i don't see you working i mean he said that lord i i just don't see you working even when you don't see me i'm working even when you don't feel me i'm working i'm thankful for that because we don't always feel him [Applause] listen you're not you're we're we're not in a place to where we always feel him you're not always in a an electric service or in a church service period you're at work you go through trials go through troubles you go through tribulations you go through deaths you don't feel him maybe you ain't felt him in a week a month maybe a year but he's never left you really what you ought to do if you hadn't felt him is see where you're at because many times feelings are based on where you're at if you're walking through grass you can feel grass if it comes up to your ankles to your knees if you're walking in the heat you can feel the heat if you're walking in the cold you can feel it so feelings many times are based on where you're at so if you have yourself in a in a real dry time you need to start looking where am i am i in a desert and am i in a desert because i walked into a desert am i in a hard moment in my life because i walked there because i my footsteps led me there amen am i here where i'm at because of where i walk to then if you find that self in that place turn back and walk towards him get closer to him listen in these times of trials they ain't the one thing to do get closer to him that's why they come you can read the bible and have enough evidence of times when things were plentiful and things were good and things were just all so hunky-dory they started bowing after other idols they started going after other things what had god have to do he'd have to send plagues he'd had to send trials he'd have to send the armies and what would they do they would pull closer to him we're not going to go through the tribulation but that does not mean we're not going to go through trials that does not mean we're not going to have hardships of life and face deaths brother erickson's church is just phase four and just the last few moments i'm sure there's some soul searching going on i may not have all this testimony exactly right but the gist of it is this brother wayne was telling me so there was a family that had left the church previous in two days two days before that fire the boy in that family dreams of charlie and his wife in a fire and out of the fire charlie screams at him and says get yourself to that summer camp brother wayne said you talking about expectations if god would be merciful to some backslidden people to give them a dream that in the middle of a trial in the middle of a trouble middle of a house exploding and a voice of mercy could scream out and say get yourself to that camp he never left them he never left them he was there with them even in their backslidden conditions you may find yourself tonight in a backslidden condition but i'm here to tell you god has not left you but he's with you even in a fire i've said it reminded of it this week as i would say that to god god would say back to me have i left you i promised you i was with you in the fire i haven't left you so don't leave me that's why the scripture would hit me as i would read it at the beginning i'll never leave you go through trials of our life we go through situations and you want to just give up god hasn't left you so don't leave him let's power it i feel if you can just come sing that song again for me i wonder all this she would say just off the cuff unplanned unrehearsed [Music] god would just give a scripture [Music] maybe you find yourself in the desert [Music] maybe you find yourself in a trial maybe you find yourself backslidden away from him [Music] many times we ask for hands hands go up all over the building [Music] but i want to ask for more than that tonight i want to ask for footsteps because footsteps are possession [Music] say lord i want to walk towards you tonight brother philip sings this song you want to we've been hearing about the holy ghost we've been hearing about el shaddai lord i want to walk closer to you lord [Music] why
