[0:09] I've been through heartbreak, through
[0:12] trials of many
[0:15] kind. Running on my own, but running out
[0:19] of
[0:20] fight. The enemy had me, thinking I
[0:26] would lose.
[0:28] I called on my
[0:30] savior. My savior came
[0:33] through. Through Jesus I have overcome.
[0:37] Through Jesus all my
[0:40] change. By his power I stay in
[0:46] victory. The Lord has washed my sins
[0:49] away. His presence is my hiding place.
[0:53] The devil know if he's ever going to get
[0:56] to me.
[0:58] You got to go through Jesus.
[1:02] Through Jesus.
[1:05] His arms around me. There's no place I'd
[1:09] rather
[1:10] be. What can come against me in the
[1:14] shadow of me?
[1:17] I know the battle's
[1:19] coming, but I won't be afraid. Oh no, I
[1:23] know the God who defeated the
[1:27] grave. Through Jesus I have overcome.
[1:31] Through Jesus all my chains are gone. By
[1:35] his power I stand in
[1:39] victory. His blood wash my sins away.
[1:43] His presence is my hiding place.
[1:47] know if he's ever going to get to
[1:50] me. He's got to go through Jesus.
[1:55] Through Jesus.
[1:58] He is on my side. He gives me what I'm
[2:04] needing. I can do all
[2:07] things. Do all things through Jesus.
[2:11] He is on my side.
[2:14] gives me what I
[2:16] needed. I can do all
[2:19] things. Do all things through
[2:26] Jesus. My change are
[2:29] gone. By his power, I stand in victory.
[2:36] and wash my sins away. His presence is
[2:41] my
[2:47] new
[2:50] Jesus.
[2:52] [Applause]
[2:55] Jesus through
[2:57] Jesus. I go through Jesus.
[3:01] [Applause]
