[56:46] together today amen aren't you glad to
[56:49] be here amen may he just minister to
[56:53] your heart today and reveal himself to
[56:55] you as only he can amen we're going to
[56:58] turn to Matthew chap 17 and verse
[57:02] 14 I read this scripture last week I
[57:05] want to read it again as we just speak
[57:09] further along on this thought today I'm
[57:12] going to speak on the mountain movers
[57:15] when two
[57:17] omnipotents
[57:19] meet
[57:21] amen Matthew 17 verse4
[57:26] and when they had come to the multitude
[57:29] there came to him a certain man kneeling
[57:32] down to him and saying Lord have mercy
[57:35] on my son for he is a lunatic and sorely
[57:39] vexed and often times he falleth Into
[57:42] the Fire and off to the water and I
[57:45] brought him to thy disciples and they
[57:47] could not cure him and then Jesus
[57:50] answered and said oh faithless and
[57:53] perverse generation how long shall I be
[57:55] with you you how long shall I suffer you
[57:59] bring him hither to me and Jesus rebuked
[58:02] the devil and he departed out of him and
[58:06] the child was cured from that very hour
[58:10] then came the disciples to Jesus apart
[58:12] and said why couldn't we not cast him
[58:15] out and Jesus said unto them because of
[58:19] your unbelief for verily I say unto you
[58:23] if you have faith as a grain of mustard
[58:25] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[58:28] remove hence To Yonder place and it
[58:31] shall remove and nothing shall be
[58:36] impossible unto you and then turn with
[58:39] me to Mark 9:14 I just want to get a a
[58:43] little glimpse of this again from
[58:45] another gospel just one one phrase here
[58:49] verse actually and when he came to his
[58:52] disciples he saw a great multitude about
[58:55] them desribes questioning them and then
[59:00] finally before you're seated 2
[59:03] Corinthians
[59:05] 4:17 for our light Affliction which is
[59:08] but for a moment worketh for us a far
[59:11] more exceeding an eternal an eternal
[59:14] weight of Glory while we look not at
[59:17] things which are seen But at the things
[59:20] which are not seen but the things which
[59:23] are seen are temporal but the things
[59:27] which are not seen are Eternal amen God
[59:31] bless you as you're seated and as we
[59:34] look into the Unseen and the realm of of
[59:39] faith today and speaking on the word of
[59:42] God from these scriptures we spoke last
[59:45] Sunday about Jesus coming from the Mount
[59:48] of
[59:50] transfiguration and found his disciples
[59:52] here questioning or being actually
[59:55] questioned by a great
[59:57] multitude and as we spoke about that we
[1:00:01] realized they were not asking questions
[1:00:04] to learn nor asking questions in support
[1:00:08] of the the disciples but disputing with
[1:00:12] them and the and so you see again you
[1:00:18] you have a conflict that is going on as
[1:00:22] they are trying to deliver this child
[1:00:25] that is is Afflicted with the devil and
[1:00:29] and of course it this conflict be brings
[1:00:33] a war against their faith and and it
[1:00:37] quickly would dissipate and and be
[1:00:40] replaced with unbelief now unbelief is
[1:00:43] really faith that is aimed in the wrong
[1:00:46] direction so you again it's just the the
[1:00:50] Turning actually salvation is the
[1:00:52] Turning of the heart and and it turns
[1:00:55] you from doubt and unbelief unto faith
[1:00:59] in God and that's what salvation does
[1:01:02] and it removes your doubt and and it it
[1:01:06] it puts a firm belief in God because you
[1:01:11] of of a love for God you'll find that
[1:01:13] love and faith works together they're
[1:01:15] like husband and wife you know they are
[1:01:18] actually one but but they're two but one
[1:01:21] they work together for the same purpose
[1:01:24] now these in the crowd were were're
[1:01:28] arguing and we find today there is a
[1:01:31] crowd of Christian them today that
[1:01:34] argues against the the very power of the
[1:01:38] Holy Spirit the very working of the Holy
[1:01:41] Spirit and so there's there's much of
[1:01:45] doubt and questioning when it comes to
[1:01:48] the word of God and these things can
[1:01:51] affect us they can affect our own faith
[1:01:54] if we take let them take a resident
[1:01:57] within us and cause us to question or to
[1:02:00] doubt or to wonder or Ponder and so you
[1:02:05] see the Unseen Realm of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:08] which is the kingdom of God from which
[1:02:11] sons of God's rule from cannot be
[1:02:14] understood by the children of this world
[1:02:17] you will really never understand the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost the kingdom of God until you
[1:02:23] are born again and and of course then
[1:02:26] you've experienced it so you begin then
[1:02:28] to understand it and yet with their
[1:02:31] wisdom the children of this world can
[1:02:35] out argue the children of light and for
[1:02:38] the the the Bible said Jesus even said
[1:02:41] the children of this world are in their
[1:02:45] generation wiser than the children of
[1:02:48] light so you will always find they are
[1:02:51] wiser with their understanding with the
[1:02:54] with their thoughts of the word world
[1:02:56] that will always be um smarter in
[1:03:00] science and be you know far far ahead of
[1:03:03] anybody else on the especially the
[1:03:06] children of light the children of this
[1:03:09] world are more in tune with the trends
[1:03:12] of the day with science with learn
[1:03:16] knowledge while a Believer is in tune
[1:03:19] with the word of God and the Unseen
[1:03:22] Realm of the spirit the seen realm and
[1:03:25] the Unseen realm they always conflict as
[1:03:29] one goes solely by the five senses while
[1:03:33] the the Unseen realm understands and
[1:03:36] sees by faith and the Bible tells you
[1:03:40] that as Believers we are to walk by
[1:03:43] faith and not by sight but you see by
[1:03:47] arguing their wisdom the crowd was
[1:03:49] pulling the disciples from the realm of
[1:03:52] the spirit and the realm of reason and
[1:03:56] and rational thinking and this made the
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:01] disciples um Faith waver and become
[1:04:05] actually unbelief you see unbelief is is
[1:04:09] simply faith in anything but God's word
[1:04:13] so you see that's what really faith is I
[1:04:16] mean unbelief is it is just simply faith
[1:04:19] in anything else but God's word so you
[1:04:23] see I I want to say this about faith
[1:04:25] faith is not
[1:04:28] rational faith will make you believe
[1:04:30] that all things are
[1:04:32] possible that you are what God says you
[1:04:36] are and that you can have what God says
[1:04:39] you can have and you can do what God
[1:04:42] says you can do amen so faith is not
[1:04:47] rational at all faith is is very
[1:04:50] irrational it makes you believe that all
[1:04:53] things are possible and that you can do
[1:04:56] all things through Christ that empowers
[1:04:59] you and it'll cause a man like Abraham
[1:05:03] to Stager not at the promise of God but
[1:05:06] to praise God believing for a promise
[1:05:10] when his when the scene realm of his
[1:05:13] five senses declare what is what is so
[1:05:17] in the physical scene realm such as as
[1:05:20] his body is now dead amen that the
[1:05:24] deadness of Sarah's wound is real while
[1:05:28] Faith looks at the Unseen and declares
[1:05:31] it is
[1:05:32] so amen when your feelings and your
[1:05:35] sight and your other senses declare it
[1:05:38] is different you see Faith sees the
[1:05:42] Unseen realm amen Faith lives in the
[1:05:46] Unseen realm it does not abide here in
[1:05:48] the seen realm it believes for what you
[1:05:51] cannot see it believes for what you
[1:05:54] cannot feel for what you cannot hear or
[1:05:57] touch but you see Faith believes God
[1:06:02] Amen he believes God who is the
[1:06:05] invisible amen he is he believes god
[1:06:08] with and and that's exactly how Faith
[1:06:11] Works Faith Works in the Unseen realm
[1:06:15] now as I said faith is required and it
[1:06:19] is required to please God timid faith is
[1:06:23] reluctant Faith real faith faith is
[1:06:26] aggressive it is persistent it is like
[1:06:30] an invading Army surrounding a city they
[1:06:33] lay hold on eternal life it's like in
[1:06:37] the times of Jesus they would tear off a
[1:06:39] roof to get to him that's Faith you see
[1:06:43] there is an excitement there is a Divine
[1:06:45] eagerness to receive the inheritance for
[1:06:49] what is yours they're like an army
[1:06:51] taking it by force you see it's a
[1:06:55] spiritual
[1:06:56] War amen Satan walls the promises of God
[1:07:00] off from you fortifies it to keep you
[1:07:03] from possessing it he shoots fiery darts
[1:07:06] against your faith because your
[1:07:08] unwavering faith will plunge the sword
[1:07:11] of the spirit the word of God right into
[1:07:14] his heart so you see he he wants to keep
[1:07:17] you always on the defense and never get
[1:07:20] on the
[1:07:21] offense because as long as you are
[1:07:24] defending and warding doubts instead of
[1:07:26] operating in faith and plunging the
[1:07:29] sword amen he's got you
[1:07:32] cornered he's got you retreating he's
[1:07:35] got you
[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:07:38] hiding God wants you to use what you
[1:07:41] have now and of course you see Jesus
[1:07:45] said it ain't going to take a lot of
[1:07:48] faith just Faith just Faith as small as
[1:07:53] a grain of mustard seed
[1:07:57] am and that faith that little bit of
[1:08:00] faith is powerful and will move Big
[1:08:04] Trees it'll pluck them up cast them in
[1:08:07] the sea I'm quoting Bible amen it'll
[1:08:10] make mountains in moh Hills you see Adam
[1:08:14] did this we know this because the the
[1:08:18] the the the Hebrews tells us through
[1:08:20] faith through the word of God that God
[1:08:23] created the heavens and the Earth and
[1:08:25] the word of you see the word of faith
[1:08:29] cared out the word of command and Faith
[1:08:32] was the power that ignited the word and
[1:08:35] filled it with power you see and this is
[1:08:38] where two omnipotence meet your faith
[1:08:42] omnipotent power at God's word
[1:08:45] omnipotent
[1:08:47] power so here's where we want to look
[1:08:50] two omnipotence meat God's word with
[1:08:54] power
[1:08:56] amen the Bible said the word of God is
[1:08:59] quick that means it's alive it is
[1:09:03] powerful amen so there's power in the
[1:09:06] word but it's going to take Faith to
[1:09:10] come with the word and when two
[1:09:13] omnipotence meet mountains move
[1:09:17] hindrance get out of the way Deliverance
[1:09:20] take place you know I can preach all I
[1:09:23] want to that God's a Sav
[1:09:25] and he'll save you from your addiction
[1:09:28] from that drunkenness from that alcohol
[1:09:30] or he'll save you from tobacco or our
[1:09:34] habits or drugs or or pornography or
[1:09:37] whatever I preach all I want to of the
[1:09:39] word and his power but somebody's got to
[1:09:42] believe that and the moment your faith
[1:09:45] comes together with the word of God it's
[1:09:48] over addiction's over the power is
[1:09:51] broken
[1:09:57] now that's where two omnipotence meet
[1:10:02] your faith omnipotent power and God's
[1:10:06] word omnipotent
[1:10:09] power now you may question that but
[1:10:13] we'll talk about it a little more as we
[1:10:15] go
[1:10:16] along and I want you to get out of the
[1:10:19] crowd and come on the side of
[1:10:24] Faith now now originally mankind was
[1:10:27] empowered and placed in the Garden of
[1:10:29] Eden to carry out and represents God's
[1:10:32] Kingdom on
[1:10:33] Earth but man failed to represent God by
[1:10:37] sinning and he was cast out of the
[1:10:40] Garden of Eden where God exercised his
[1:10:42] rule the Bible tells us clearly in in
[1:10:46] Genesis
[1:10:47] 3:23 that the Lord was send Adam out of
[1:10:51] the Garden of Eden to till the ground
[1:10:53] from which he was taken and drove Dr him
[1:10:56] the man to the to the east of the Garden
[1:10:59] of Eden and place some cherubims with
[1:11:02] flaming uh swords to guard the way of
[1:11:06] the tree of life so the Garden of Eden
[1:11:10] as we look at it for a moment is a a
[1:11:12] picture of the Kingdom of Heaven or the
[1:11:16] center it was the center of God's
[1:11:19] government on Earth and since man was
[1:11:22] expelled from the Garden of Eden man
[1:11:24] lost his can ction he lost his
[1:11:27] connection with God he lost power and he
[1:11:30] lost the Garden of Eden and and the
[1:11:32] Garden of Eden the symbol of the Kingdom
[1:11:35] of Heaven on Earth became
[1:11:39] hidden now Jesus came from
[1:11:44] heaven when you couldn't go there he
[1:11:48] came
[1:11:49] down and Jesus came from Heaven to bring
[1:11:53] back Dominion oh
[1:11:56] hallelujah amen he came to bring
[1:11:59] Heaven's Kingdom and it's rule to man
[1:12:02] again now he would not
[1:12:05] restore he would not restore Eden to the
[1:12:08] Earth yet because all of those who would
[1:12:11] inhabit Eden would have to be
[1:12:15] reborn right amen those Flesh and Blood
[1:12:20] the Bible said cannot inherit the
[1:12:21] kingdom of God so we know sinful flesh
[1:12:25] can not inherit God's
[1:12:27] Kingdom so the only way to get into it
[1:12:30] is to be born
[1:12:32] again so Eden cannot come until the last
[1:12:36] one who is a child of God whose name is
[1:12:40] on the book is manifested up on the
[1:12:43] earth and is born
[1:12:46] again and then Eden can come on the
[1:12:49] Earth
[1:12:50] again now let's just picture it this way
[1:12:53] picture it this way I want you to think
[1:12:55] of it a minute and lock in just a
[1:12:59] minute there in the beginning when man
[1:13:03] fell he was the god of the earth he had
[1:13:08] Dominion he was the
[1:13:10] king and when man fell all beneath him
[1:13:17] fell so it wasn't just man that came
[1:13:21] under Satan's
[1:13:23] Dominion but it was the whole whole
[1:13:25] earth came in to Satan's Dominion now
[1:13:30] the only way to get the Earth back under
[1:13:33] God's Dominion is to bring restore man
[1:13:37] back as King
[1:13:41] again now so you see this is exactly
[1:13:45] what salvation is it's it's getting rid
[1:13:48] of the Dominion of Satan of sin upon
[1:13:51] your life who sits upon the throne of
[1:13:54] your heart is dethroning Satan and is
[1:13:58] installing another king and his kingdom
[1:14:01] his Dominion in your
[1:14:05] heart now so we let me just cover that
[1:14:10] thought again so Jesus came from Heaven
[1:14:15] to bring back Dominion Heaven's Kingdom
[1:14:19] and his rule to man he would not restore
[1:14:23] Eden to the Earth yet 2,000 years ago
[1:14:27] because all who would inhabit Eden would
[1:14:31] have to be
[1:14:33] reborn and the till the last one is
[1:14:36] reborn Eden cannot come back to the
[1:14:40] Earth but all who are reborn are born
[1:14:44] again would receive God's Kingdom on the
[1:14:49] inside and become New Creation therefore
[1:14:53] a new creature with old things pass away
[1:14:57] and All Things become a
[1:15:00] new amen that's the marvelous thing of a
[1:15:03] new of a new birth it changes your
[1:15:05] habits your ways amen everything about
[1:15:08] you changes from the inside
[1:15:10] out so the first thing he does is
[1:15:13] restore God back as the rule of the
[1:15:18] heart which begins to control this
[1:15:23] Earth this flesh
[1:15:26] we're worried about out here moving this
[1:15:28] mountain and and moving and caling this
[1:15:31] this to see is right
[1:15:34] here within you you want to bring this
[1:15:37] under
[1:15:38] Dominion amen we'll come into full
[1:15:40] Dominion later but I mean even right now
[1:15:42] our faith can move mountains but when
[1:15:45] you are spirit filled when you are born
[1:15:47] again then you become an
[1:15:51] Invader in Satan's kingdom and we have a
[1:15:55] purpose and that is to cast Satan
[1:16:00] out amen now in that great battle you
[1:16:03] know when when Jesus used the word to
[1:16:06] defeat the devil on the Mount of
[1:16:08] Temptation he would leave them after
[1:16:12] defeating him with the word he did it
[1:16:15] with the word so that all of us could do
[1:16:17] it he showed he was not going to be a
[1:16:20] certain gifted person
[1:16:25] you you know first first of all I I want
[1:16:27] you to get it out of your mind well
[1:16:29] Jesus can do it but we
[1:16:32] can't I I want you to understand Jesus
[1:16:36] was God's example
[1:16:40] son and every son is to be like
[1:16:45] him is that right amen so you know you
[1:16:49] say well he he he was always God no he
[1:16:53] laid aside his
[1:16:56] godship to become a man yeah amen he
[1:17:00] would even pray glorify me with the
[1:17:03] glory I had with you before the world
[1:17:07] began which is exactly the same thing
[1:17:10] you have to pray Lord glorify me with
[1:17:13] the glory that you had in mind of me in
[1:17:18] your mind before the foundation of the
[1:17:20] world glorify me with that Glory let me
[1:17:24] become that
[1:17:26] glorious I want to
[1:17:28] match what you thought of
[1:17:31] me now in that great
[1:17:34] battle when after Jesus came down off
[1:17:37] the mount
[1:17:39] Temptation after defeating the Devil
[1:17:41] with the word remember how he defeated
[1:17:45] the devil with faith in the word every
[1:17:48] time every time the battle started with
[1:17:52] a new thing come on Amen because he's
[1:17:55] the father of lies and he comes again
[1:17:58] he's speaking to he's he's the father of
[1:18:00] all the crowd so he speaking for the
[1:18:03] crowd and he is saying if thou be that's
[1:18:07] the first thing the devil will do to you
[1:18:09] when you're born again is
[1:18:12] question whether or not you really are
[1:18:14] who you are then he'll want you to prove
[1:18:17] it and I tell you how you prove it and
[1:18:21] that is is simply by staying with the
[1:18:24] word you don't have to do anything else
[1:18:27] but just stay with what God's word said
[1:18:30] and say I believe it not because I feel
[1:18:33] it now because right now I feel this
[1:18:36] ugly Spirit of a demonic
[1:18:38] presence amen I'm no longer feeling as
[1:18:41] Jesus standing there he was say I'm no
[1:18:43] longer feeling what I felt when he came
[1:18:47] down on the river and the heavens open
[1:18:49] and a Dove came I no longer have that
[1:18:52] feeling I'm feeling a different feeling
[1:18:55] yeah and the feeling I feel now is
[1:18:58] demonic it's a powerful Evil dark spirit
[1:19:03] and it comes to him questioning and now
[1:19:06] you say well I don't feel like it no
[1:19:08] more no you don't you're feeling that
[1:19:12] other come on look into the Unseen for a
[1:19:15] minute see what you're dealing with that
[1:19:18] Spirit of depression is nothing but the
[1:19:22] devil that Spirit of the enemy that says
[1:19:26] you can't make it you can never be what
[1:19:29] God says you you you can't overcome this
[1:19:32] addiction you you can't you see he's
[1:19:34] only afraid you're going to do
[1:19:37] it he knows as long as you disbelieve
[1:19:42] you will never rise up above it but the
[1:19:44] moment you start believing and to
[1:19:47] omnipotence God's word and your faith
[1:19:49] comes together that Mountain's got to
[1:19:53] move that enemy
[1:19:55] [Applause]
[1:20:02] got now
[1:20:04] Jesus
[1:20:05] would leave the Mount of Temptation
[1:20:09] after defeating the devil there and he
[1:20:12] would walk out into Satan's
[1:20:15] kingdom he would walk right out into the
[1:20:18] realm of the earth which he Satan is the
[1:20:22] God of this world he's the prince of the
[1:20:25] power of the air of
[1:20:27] atmospheres he is the prince of this
[1:20:30] world all of these are Bible terms about
[1:20:33] the devil how did he get to be that way
[1:20:36] not because God made him that way this
[1:20:39] Earth was never made for the
[1:20:43] devil this Earth was made for sons of
[1:20:46] God to have dominion over let me say to
[1:20:50] you your body your flesh your mind your
[1:20:53] spirit was never never made for the
[1:20:55] devil to rule you were created to be a
[1:21:00] son or daughter of God and the devil
[1:21:02] took a hold of you because of your first
[1:21:05] birth where you were born in the Sin but
[1:21:08] a new birth dethrones him and puts God
[1:21:11] back in control of your life which again
[1:21:14] can control your flesh and bring it
[1:21:17] subject to
[1:21:19] God
[1:21:22] now so now Jesus would leave the Mount
[1:21:26] of
[1:21:28] Temptation and he would
[1:21:30] immediately begin calling
[1:21:37] recruits I'm calling
[1:21:39] Apostles Apostles means one
[1:21:42] cent I'm going to commission me some
[1:21:45] men we're going to we're you know
[1:21:48] there's men that are gathered to me kind
[1:21:50] of like David's men you know from every
[1:21:53] kind of situation broken
[1:21:56] situations difficult you remember when
[1:21:59] when they gathered to David those men
[1:22:01] gathered to him those that were in debt
[1:22:04] those who had got out of prison those
[1:22:06] who had been in and was running from the
[1:22:09] king or this that all of these men
[1:22:12] gathered to
[1:22:14] David to make him
[1:22:17] King and that's what God did with you
[1:22:20] yeah he went looking for
[1:22:22] you amen he went to the son of man goes
[1:22:26] to seek and save that which is lost
[1:22:29] Jesus said I didn't come to cause the
[1:22:32] righteous repentance I called come to
[1:22:35] call those who realize I need a savior I
[1:22:38] need a
[1:22:40] deliverer and so he took you out of the
[1:22:43] dreads of humanity in the lowest of sin
[1:22:47] to make you it call you into his kingdom
[1:23:01] now Matthew 4:17 tells us from that time
[1:23:06] Jesus began to preach and to say
[1:23:11] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:23:14] hand I I know we make that
[1:23:17] hard and we think what in the world is a
[1:23:21] kingdom the kingdom is the Holy Ghost
[1:23:23] it's his Dominion
[1:23:26] so he said men are about to be filled
[1:23:29] with the Holy Ghost repent get ready for
[1:23:31] it deity is about to come into people's
[1:23:34] lives get prepared for it the kingdom of
[1:23:38] God is about to come within men amen so
[1:23:42] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven same
[1:23:44] thing kingdom of God is at hand there's
[1:23:48] about to be an outpouring of the spirit
[1:23:50] get ready for it you know what men and
[1:23:53] women would do do that today amen get
[1:23:56] prepared for the outpouring of the Holy
[1:24:00] Ghost come on you need the Holy Ghost
[1:24:03] get prepared for it make room for it get
[1:24:06] ready for it repent turn from your
[1:24:11] wickedness now
[1:24:14] Jesus filled with the spirit now
[1:24:18] operates in the Unseen
[1:24:21] realm he doesn't use the Physical Realm
[1:24:25] he's not a
[1:24:26] doctor he doesn't go and examine
[1:24:30] diseases you know oh yeah well you got
[1:24:33] the he's he actually doesn't call them
[1:24:36] by scientific names he don't even use
[1:24:39] the terms he says th
[1:24:43] devil thou demon he not dealing with the
[1:24:47] physical thing he's dealing with the
[1:24:50] spiritual
[1:24:52] thing and so he from that time you know
[1:24:56] he filled with the spirit operates in
[1:24:58] the spirit realm and and he begins to
[1:25:01] cast Satan out I want you to see this in
[1:25:04] verse 23 of Matthew 4 Jesus went about
[1:25:08] all Galilee teaching in their synagogues
[1:25:11] preaching the gospel of the Kingdom
[1:25:13] that's the good news of the kingdom and
[1:25:15] healing all manner of sickness and all
[1:25:18] manner of diseases among the people
[1:25:21] what's now and his Fame went throughout
[1:25:23] all Sy Syria and they brought unto him
[1:25:26] all sick people that were taken with
[1:25:28] diverse diseases and torments and those
[1:25:31] who were possessed with devils and those
[1:25:34] which were lunatic and those that had py
[1:25:37] and he healed
[1:25:38] them he delivered them the first thing
[1:25:42] he does is begin to cast Satan
[1:25:47] out that's why I say the principal work
[1:25:50] of the church is to cast Satan out
[1:25:53] you're not stop preaching the gospel
[1:25:56] unless you're casting Satan
[1:26:00] out that's what happens at the alar when
[1:26:02] somebody gets saved Satan gets cast out
[1:26:06] that's what happens when the sick are
[1:26:08] healed Satan gets cast
[1:26:12] out not that they're Devils or demon
[1:26:16] possessed it's that that evil spirit has
[1:26:19] come and brought
[1:26:20] diseases and afflictions
[1:26:24] and healing cast him
[1:26:27] out and this is what Jesus began to do
[1:26:30] he began to come in as a just filled
[1:26:34] with the spirit oh I I want you to get
[1:26:36] this you just been filled with the
[1:26:39] spirit amen you have been equipped to
[1:26:42] cast Satan
[1:26:46] out amen you have been you have been
[1:26:49] ordained and commissioned to cast him
[1:26:53] out amen now so again again everywhere
[1:26:57] Jesus went he overthrew Satan's kingdom
[1:27:01] he attacked sin he attacked his
[1:27:03] counterpart sickness amen he he he cast
[1:27:08] out unbelief and doubt in every form
[1:27:12] some of it was in religious forms some
[1:27:15] of it was theology that had been falsely
[1:27:19] taught that the Bible calls it doctrines
[1:27:22] that demons teach
[1:27:24] that's
[1:27:28] right because that's what Satan does
[1:27:31] every time the word comes when a message
[1:27:34] comes Satan gets in it to do what
[1:27:37] distort
[1:27:39] it Adam and Eve received a message from
[1:27:42] God and Satan got in it to do what
[1:27:45] distort it to twist what God Said to put
[1:27:50] a question on
[1:27:51] it yeah has God said
[1:27:58] now this was to fulfill Isaiah's Words
[1:28:02] which we find in verse 16 the people
[1:28:05] which sat in darkness saw great light
[1:28:09] and to them which sat in the region in
[1:28:11] the shadow of death light has sprung up
[1:28:14] let me tell you without Christ this is
[1:28:16] where you're at you are in the region
[1:28:19] and shadow of death amen and and you
[1:28:23] sitting in
[1:28:25] Darkness amen and the Lord the king of
[1:28:28] darkness is there with rule over your
[1:28:30] life but Jesus comes to bring light into
[1:28:33] your
[1:28:35] Darkness to give hope where there is no
[1:28:37] hope to give peace that the world cannot
[1:28:41] give Amen to pour out his blessings upon
[1:28:44] your
[1:28:47] life to take you from the dreads of
[1:28:49] humanity and set you as a son of God
[1:28:54] with sin and darkness under your
[1:28:58] feet
[1:29:00] now Jesus was not a conqueror like
[1:29:02] Alexander the Great who conquered the
[1:29:04] known world only be conquered by his own
[1:29:07] flesh and evil
[1:29:08] life he would die at
[1:29:11] 33 but this this young man Jesus Christ
[1:29:16] he died at 33 and conquered everything
[1:29:18] that could be
[1:29:19] conquered I want you to remember he is
[1:29:22] the king of kings so he leads in battle
[1:29:26] and when and so he came when he was on
[1:29:29] the earth he conquered passions he
[1:29:31] conquered Pride he conquered sickness he
[1:29:34] conquered devils and and he and when he
[1:29:37] died he even conquered death death had
[1:29:41] to become obedient to him and he rose up
[1:29:44] on the third day amen when he arose he
[1:29:46] conquered hell hell couldn't hold him he
[1:29:50] went he went up and conquered everything
[1:29:52] that was against mankind and tread The
[1:29:55] Wine Press of the wrath of God and and
[1:29:58] received God's Wrath poured upon him
[1:30:01] that was do you and he became your sin
[1:30:05] that you might become his
[1:30:09] righteousness and then he would he would
[1:30:11] conquer the all the atmospheres above
[1:30:13] because Satan is the prince of the power
[1:30:16] of the air and there he would cut that
[1:30:19] mist between God and man and connect
[1:30:21] Heaven and Earth back together again
[1:30:25] and God's got an army here on the
[1:30:29] earth I'm part of that
[1:30:34] Army now there on Calvary by dying he
[1:30:39] entered into the stronghold of death and
[1:30:42] there he conquered death hell in the
[1:30:44] grave and he took the the keys of death
[1:30:48] and Hell from Satan I want you to look
[1:30:50] at this as John saw him and his
[1:30:52] glorified condition
[1:30:54] in Revelation 117 he he when John sees
[1:30:58] him he he's so overcome by me he says he
[1:31:01] said fear not I am the first and the
[1:31:04] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:31:07] and behold I am alive forever more amen
[1:31:11] but I have the keys of death and of
[1:31:14] Hell amen here he comes the mighty
[1:31:18] conqueror amen he's rent the veil in two
[1:31:21] and says fear not and he lays his hand
[1:31:24] his right hand upon on John and and he
[1:31:28] says Don't Fear John I've conquered it
[1:31:31] all and I've come to tell you something
[1:31:35] I'm exalting you to
[1:31:39] godship I'm ex I've exalted you to
[1:31:42] sunship that not only have I overcome it
[1:31:46] but I've making you an
[1:31:48] overcomer amen now brother brandom
[1:31:54] speaks about these things and he says
[1:31:56] now I was about to choke
[1:31:59] this but I'm going to say
[1:32:03] it man is
[1:32:07] omnipotent what you knew God
[1:32:12] was I'm telling you man is
[1:32:17] omnipotent and then he says you don't
[1:32:19] believe that
[1:32:25] but he
[1:32:27] is a man fully surrendered to God is
[1:32:34] omnipotent oh I must not be fully
[1:32:37] surrendered to God well that's to
[1:32:39] receive the Holy Ghost you had to be
[1:32:41] fully
[1:32:44] surrendered so if you have the Holy
[1:32:46] Spirit in your life you are fully
[1:32:50] surrendered to God therefore omnip
[1:32:59] and he says did not he say in Mark 11:22
[1:33:03] whatsoever thing you say and don't doubt
[1:33:06] in your heart it'll come to pass you can
[1:33:09] have what you have said well that's
[1:33:12] omnipotence isn't it amen he said what
[1:33:15] happens when two omnipotence meet when
[1:33:20] God and man comes together through
[1:33:22] omnipotence something's got to Shake
[1:33:25] whatsoever you say with that creative
[1:33:28] power of omnipotence of God knowing that
[1:33:30] he promised and he said it in his word
[1:33:33] it creates a power that goes out yonder
[1:33:36] and brings things to pass things that is
[1:33:38] not makes them as though they are
[1:33:40] because two
[1:33:43] omnipotence have
[1:33:45] met two

[1:37:06] happen
[1:37:09] amen I shook hands the other day with
[1:37:13] brother James strong back
[1:37:15] there spoke to him just for a moment we
[1:37:18] exchange phone
[1:37:21] numbers just one moment
[1:37:24] just one moment of
[1:37:27] believing addiction since he was about
[1:37:32] in his early teens drunk every day
[1:37:36] since a man an alcoholic couldn't help
[1:37:41] himself one
[1:37:44] moment two omnipotence came
[1:37:48] together amen it you know it doesn't
[1:37:51] take even coming up and hands laid on
[1:37:54] you while the word is
[1:37:56] preached amen I I can recall a man there
[1:38:00] that went out and and left the word of
[1:38:02] God went out into sin he was he was went
[1:38:05] into a horrible condition and he came
[1:38:07] back into church and he's full of an
[1:38:09] addiction with with a cigarette habit he
[1:38:11] can't give up and as I'm preaching he
[1:38:14] screams out I'm delivered I'm delivered
[1:38:16] I'm delivered and from that Moment On
[1:38:19] never smoked another
[1:38:22] cigarette why was two omnipotence came
[1:38:26] together that's what happens when we
[1:38:30] preach when the word of faith is
[1:38:32] preached what happens people begin to
[1:38:35] believe and when when we believe demons
[1:38:37] have to
[1:38:40] leave only your unbelief can give them
[1:38:43] permission to stay the word of God says
[1:38:46] they have to
[1:38:51] leave to omnipotence
[1:38:54] I want to show you again here in this
[1:38:58] passage first of all we have the
[1:39:01] crowd they're saying what science says
[1:39:04] they're saying the impossibilities
[1:39:07] they're asking the disciples who do you
[1:39:09] think you are and who do you think this
[1:39:12] man you're calling Messiah is that gave
[1:39:14] you this Authority you didn't get it
[1:39:16] from Moses and you know you didn't get
[1:39:19] it from one of our
[1:39:21] prophets it didn't come out of our
[1:39:23] church
[1:39:24] church and they got all these accusation
[1:39:27] and first thing you know their faith is
[1:39:30] dropping being replaced with
[1:39:33] unbelief they're siding with the
[1:39:36] crowd but Jesus has already met the
[1:39:40] tempter
[1:39:42] himself and defeated him he knew who he
[1:39:46] was and he knew what his job was he knew
[1:39:51] what his position was we'll read it
[1:39:52] later but he knew his position because
[1:39:56] the word said he was
[1:39:59] this I want you to get it Jesus knew it
[1:40:02] not because of of of that he came with
[1:40:06] this knowledge he would leave the
[1:40:08] knowledge of godship to the point when
[1:40:11] they ask him as a human okay when are
[1:40:15] you coming back I don't
[1:40:17] know when's your second coming I I don't
[1:40:21] know why don't you know you're God no
[1:40:24] I'm a man and I put aside my godship to
[1:40:28] come and show you how God receiving God
[1:40:32] in a man can make you live I'm the first
[1:40:36] born of your race of a new creation and
[1:40:40] so I've laid aside my godship and so
[1:40:44] there are things I won't know till I go
[1:40:47] back to being God
[1:40:50] again when I sinned I'll come back and
[1:40:53] he comes to John on the aisle ofart of
[1:40:55] pmas and gives us a whole scope of his
[1:41:00] coming so there's going to be seven
[1:41:03] stars and seven churches these are
[1:41:07] written in symbols as as ages and here
[1:41:10] it will be in the last age in the days
[1:41:13] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:41:15] he begins to sound the mystery of God
[1:41:17] would be finished and I I'm going to I'm
[1:41:20] going to delay my coming until the last
[1:41:23] day and then I'll break the Silence of
[1:41:25] it opening up that seventh seal which is
[1:41:28] silence and reveal my coming and I'm
[1:41:31] going to set it in motion I want you to
[1:41:33] know his coming is in
[1:41:35] motion the end time is in it is it is in
[1:41:41] cycle it is now we're in the cycle of
[1:41:43] the end time and every prophecy is
[1:41:46] pointing there
[1:41:54] Mr Trump I don't know what part he'll
[1:41:57] play I don't know what his Catholic
[1:42:00] running mate will play who's married to
[1:42:04] a
[1:42:04] Hindu I don't know all of all about what
[1:42:08] part they play but I'm reading in the
[1:42:11] Bible Nebuchadnezzar my
[1:42:19] servant and the other day when a
[1:42:21] Assassin's bullet tried to take came
[1:42:23] down it
[1:42:24] couldn't he still got a job to do I
[1:42:27] don't know what it is but all I know is
[1:42:30] we're in the end time and things are
[1:42:35] happening amen whe whether it'll be
[1:42:38] another defeat at the pole and that
[1:42:40] woman in purple that was there and in
[1:42:42] the inauguration there that brother Bram
[1:42:44] saw and and the and and behind them the
[1:42:47] Catholic Church which Joe Biden is I
[1:42:50] don't know I don't know exactly how it
[1:42:52] all will play but I'm looking at
[1:42:54] it I'm wondering I'm I'm reading the
[1:42:57] book I'm doing like Daniel did when it
[1:43:00] was time to go home and for the for the
[1:43:03] Exiles to return back I want to look at
[1:43:06] Jeremiah and he says what 70 years will
[1:43:08] be accomplished we're right at the time
[1:43:11] and I believe there should be a people
[1:43:13] in this moment seeking God and searching
[1:43:16] the word and say God what is our hour
[1:43:20] what is our day don't let me m your
[1:43:26] visitation but everything is coming
[1:43:29] right there right in the
[1:43:34] place
[1:43:38] now here we come the
[1:43:41] crowd they're screaming their
[1:43:44] unbelief and the whole world is
[1:43:46] screaming at
[1:43:47] out you'll never have a Rapture in this
[1:43:50] day what Jesus said we would
[1:43:55] you'll never get a bride ready well he
[1:43:58] said I'll have one without spot a
[1:44:03] wrinkle how's he going to do it I don't
[1:44:05] know I just know he's going to do it how
[1:44:07] do you know Abraham how's he going to I
[1:44:09] don't know I just know he's going to do
[1:44:11] it I just know even that that when
[1:44:14] Elohim came down and discerned the heart
[1:44:18] of Sarah and told her the promise he
[1:44:20] said I will come
[1:44:21] again according to is the time of
[1:44:24] life Hallelujah I don't know about you
[1:44:27] but I I'm seeing the return of the
[1:44:30] angel I'm seeing the stir of the Holy
[1:44:33] Spirit I'm seeing another surge as
[1:44:36] people hearts are starting to
[1:44:42] believe watch now that's the crowd the
[1:44:46] disciples are now in
[1:44:49] unbelief but now in order for this book
[1:44:53] boy to be
[1:44:54] healed in order for this devil to be
[1:44:57] cast out two omnipotents are going to
[1:44:59] have to
[1:45:03] meet and so in Mark chapter 9 verse 22
[1:45:07] and oftimes the boy's father tells of
[1:45:12] times it has cast him into the fire and
[1:45:16] into the waters to destroy
[1:45:19] him but if thou can't do
[1:45:25] anything have compassion on us and help
[1:45:28] us now here's the
[1:45:30] man he's putting an if in part of in in
[1:45:34] front of the
[1:45:37] word if you can do anything you know
[1:45:40] that's the way that a lot of people
[1:45:41] approach God if you can
[1:45:45] God if you will I mean a leper asked him
[1:45:49] that one day and said Lord if I will I
[1:45:53] you can make me clean he said I will be
[1:45:55] thou
[1:45:56] clean it's just that simple church I
[1:45:59] mean it's his
[1:46:01] will it's his will to deliver he's a
[1:46:05] savior that's his job he's a savior he
[1:46:08] wants to
[1:46:11] save save you from that addiction save
[1:46:14] you from that sickness save you from
[1:46:17] that sin he's a
[1:46:21] savior now but if thou can do
[1:46:25] anything have compassion on us and help
[1:46:32] us now King James don't say it exactly
[1:46:35] like this but most of the rest of the
[1:46:37] translations agree with
[1:46:40] this and Jesus says if I
[1:46:48] can look at verse
[1:46:50] 23 if I can
[1:46:55] and then he says all things are possible
[1:46:57] to them that
[1:46:59] believe and so you see if they there
[1:47:02] again if th can't believe all things are
[1:47:06] possible to him that believeth he says
[1:47:08] if I
[1:47:10] can yeah I I've been sent for this it's
[1:47:14] my position but what I got to do is get
[1:47:17] you to believe
[1:47:20] it and the question isn't if I I can but
[1:47:24] if you will
[1:47:27] believe if I I I am I have the
[1:47:30] omnipotence I need you to step into
[1:47:34] omnipotence and the two when they meet
[1:47:36] things
[1:47:38] happen so if I can get you to believe
[1:47:41] cuz I need Faith to
[1:47:46] operate and straight way and this ought
[1:47:49] to be us this morning and straight way
[1:47:51] the father of the child DED out and with
[1:47:53] tears says Lord I believe help thou my
[1:47:58] unbelief that's where that's where
[1:48:00] you've got to come to every situation
[1:48:02] Lord to that point I believe God I
[1:48:06] believe it I believe what you said I
[1:48:09] believe you're the Healer I believe
[1:48:11] you're the deliverer I believe you can
[1:48:13] do I believe your word but help my
[1:48:21] unbelief now
[1:48:23] when those two omnipotence met God's
[1:48:26] words
[1:48:29] omnipotent and that's one omnipotence
[1:48:31] but like electricity we need two
[1:48:36] wires need two to come
[1:48:39] together so I want want you to see when
[1:48:42] that two came together the devil
[1:48:47] left amen the same thing will happen
[1:48:49] when those two omnivent meet Satan
[1:48:55] fleas the moment he meets with
[1:48:58] faith amen and faith in that father's
[1:49:01] word something's going to happen
[1:49:03] somebody with me now ammen let's go to
[1:49:05] John 11:21 and we're going to see Martha
[1:49:08] at the tomb of Lazarus and I want you to
[1:49:11] watch the battle between the crowd of
[1:49:14] man's thinking and the resurrection
[1:49:17] power of
[1:49:20] Jesus so now we're at the tomb of
[1:49:23] Lazarus or we're here with the family of
[1:49:27] Lazarus Jesus has went
[1:49:29] away because he could do nothing till
[1:49:32] the father showed him first he would see
[1:49:35] that he would know he would know when he
[1:49:37] died he said our friend elzar is asleep
[1:49:39] well if he's asleep the disciples said
[1:49:41] he's doing
[1:49:43] well said they didn't understand he man
[1:49:45] he was
[1:49:47] dead and Jesus shows
[1:49:50] up and they think he's 4 days late
[1:49:53] but he's right on
[1:49:55] time he's stepping right into the
[1:49:59] vision following there God will show now
[1:50:01] through him he has resurrection power
[1:50:04] power over death even four days dead
[1:50:09] amen so now here again Martha's he he he
[1:50:14] meets with Martha and and and of course
[1:50:16] you know she she's heard from the crowd
[1:50:20] All The
[1:50:21] Consolers well you you know he'll be in
[1:50:23] heaven and he's gone and you know he was
[1:50:26] a good boy and we we've given him a good
[1:50:29] funeral and we we've cried and we talked
[1:50:31] about all his deeds and everything else
[1:50:34] and and and here comes Jesus
[1:50:37] up and in John 11:21 Martha said to
[1:50:41] Jesus Lord if thou H has been here my
[1:50:44] brother had not
[1:50:47] died but I
[1:50:49] know watch now that even
[1:50:53] now now look I want you to see here
[1:50:56] Faith Rises up because Jesus has
[1:51:00] appeared and when you can see that Jesus
[1:51:03] is
[1:51:04] here then faith will
[1:51:07] rise and so she began to believe now
[1:51:10] because Jesus is here and she said but
[1:51:14] even
[1:51:16] now even now Lord whatever you ask God
[1:51:21] God will give it to you
[1:51:23] I'm confident in you I'm confident
[1:51:26] whatever you ask it'll be
[1:51:31] done oh I tell you what if the church
[1:51:33] this morning could realize Jesus is here
[1:51:36] well he said he was I said that he said
[1:51:39] he was he said where two or more Gather
[1:51:42] in my name I am there in their midst he
[1:51:46] does miss a church service even when you
[1:51:50] miss he's there
[1:51:54] he's there for you to call him on the
[1:51:56] scene he's there for you to recognize
[1:51:58] his presence he's there to for you to
[1:52:01] wash his dirty feet somebody help me
[1:52:04] preach to make him the welcome Christ to
[1:52:07] to entertain him to welcome
[1:52:10] him see Jesus is here and he and he says
[1:52:14] but I know that even now even now Lord
[1:52:18] whatever thou ask of God God will give
[1:52:21] you and Jesus gives the word watch now
[1:52:25] Jesus gives the word in verse 23 thy
[1:52:30] brother shall rise
[1:52:35] again I see they just said what do you
[1:52:38] ask God and Jesus said your brother will
[1:52:41] rise
[1:52:43] again Jus said even now
[1:52:46] Lord whatever you ask and Jesus says
[1:52:51] your brother will rise again now the
[1:52:54] word is released want did you get this
[1:52:57] it can't return him to him
[1:52:59] void amen Jesus has already spoken but I
[1:53:04] want you to notice now the word of the
[1:53:07] crowd now comes back and wars in her
[1:53:11] mind the Bible said you know you have to
[1:53:14] cast down reasoning and every High thing
[1:53:17] that exalts itself against the word of
[1:53:19] God a lot of high Things
[1:53:21] Are true
[1:53:25] things true as far as the scene realm
[1:53:32] goes well I tell you what I I I the
[1:53:34] doctor said I I don't have cancer yes
[1:53:37] you
[1:53:39] do yes you
[1:53:42] do faith is not
[1:53:45] denying faith says my God is able
[1:53:54] well I don't have this problem yes you
[1:53:58] do but just give it over to
[1:54:01] God don't go along pretending this is
[1:54:04] not pretending amen what we see in the
[1:54:07] in the in the five senses that what is
[1:54:10] declaring is declaring what they see
[1:54:12] taste smell or feel or
[1:54:14] hear and that's what the doctor is going
[1:54:16] by but we're looking in the Unseen realm
[1:54:20] where Jesus Paid It All
[1:54:22] amen and where we have the right to cast
[1:54:25] Satan
[1:54:26] out listen we're not dealing with the
[1:54:29] with the with the the symptom we are
[1:54:32] dealing with the
[1:54:38] spirit so Jesus says I mat said verse 24
[1:54:43] now she Echoes the words of the
[1:54:46] crowd the crowd says I
[1:54:49] know he was a good boy he'll raise again
[1:54:52] in the Resurrection to the last day she
[1:54:56] immediately put her promise off way in
[1:55:00] the
[1:55:03] future she's just
[1:55:06] declared whatever you ask God and he
[1:55:08] said he'll Rise Again ah yeah I I I I
[1:55:12] know in the last days I know he'll rise
[1:55:16] again in the resurrection yeah he was a
[1:55:19] good boy he he'll come forth then but
[1:55:22] you know my brother's dead now it's too
[1:55:26] late you know but in the sweep by and by
[1:55:29] he will rise but it's impossible
[1:55:33] now he been dead four
[1:55:38] days but if you'd have been here you
[1:55:41] know if if we would have lived when
[1:55:43] Jesus walked the shores of Galilee we
[1:55:45] could have
[1:55:49] Miracles if we would have been in
[1:55:51] William Adam's day back in the 40s and
[1:55:54] 50s when the healing reviv we could have
[1:55:59] Miracles but I guess we'll have to wait
[1:56:02] for the
[1:56:07] Millennium I guess we'll have to wait
[1:56:09] until squeeze
[1:56:12] comes I guess we'll have to wait until
[1:56:14] we're
[1:56:15] adopted when are you going to realize
[1:56:17] your position in Christ that you are
[1:56:19] adopted that's what the token is it gave
[1:56:22] you adoption life a mature son or
[1:56:25] daughter of God filled with the holy
[1:56:27] spirit amen dress come on you don't
[1:56:30] dress an infant with a shield of faith
[1:56:32] and a helmet of salvation and the and
[1:56:35] good about your Lords that's a
[1:56:37] man amen quit you like men be men
[1:56:41] realize I'm no child I am a blood blood
[1:56:45] buffed son and daughter of the Living
[1:56:47] God matured by this word ready to take
[1:56:50] and go to battle
[1:56:52] [Applause]
[1:56:55] going to have to wait till I grow up let
[1:56:57] me tell you something just get born
[1:56:59] again get filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:57:03] that'll place you in the body of Christ
[1:57:05] as a
[1:57:07] son
[1:57:08] well I know someday this would be
[1:57:13] true one day we'll have the
[1:57:16] power one day you know but not
[1:57:19] now it's not here now what day the bride
[1:57:23] will be adopted and rise in power but
[1:57:26] not now one day when the third pool
[1:57:29] comes but not right now we have to place
[1:57:33] it all in the
[1:57:35] future and Jesus jerks her
[1:57:39] faith back and connects her faith back
[1:57:43] to the presence and he says in verse 25
[1:57:46] I am the resurrection that's right the
[1:57:49] resurrection is here ien
[1:57:52] Resurrection Life is here right now I'm
[1:57:56] here I'm the now God not not tomorrow
[1:57:59] I'm the present God I am I am right here
[1:58:02] right now the I am that that I
[1:58:08] am don't put it in the
[1:58:11] future don't say
[1:58:13] someday right now one day we'll be sons
[1:58:18] of God right now you're sons of God Amen
[1:58:21] well one day you will have power over
[1:58:23] the enemy greater is he that is in you
[1:58:26] than he that is in the
[1:58:33] world Jesus says I am the
[1:58:37] resurrection I am the
[1:58:39] life he's a life he's the
[1:58:42] lifegiver he's same one that breathe
[1:58:44] breath into Adam at the
[1:58:46] beginning he's the same one that gave
[1:58:48] you
[1:58:50] breath says I'm the resurrection and the
[1:58:54] life if I can get you to believe in
[1:58:57] me though he is dead yet shall he
[1:59:03] live if I can get you to believe in a
[1:59:06] present tense
[1:59:13] God this man though he were
[1:59:16] dead yet he will
[1:59:19] live it doesn't matter that deadness of
[1:59:22] Sarah's womb didn't matter to Abraham
[1:59:25] the Bible said he staggered not at it
[1:59:27] you say he didn't see it oh yeah he saw
[1:59:30] all the
[1:59:31] wrinkles he saw her crippled condition
[1:59:35] and what old age had done but he looked
[1:59:37] past that into the Unseen and he saw a
[1:59:40] young woman bringing forth a child and
[1:59:43] that woman materialized in such a child
[1:59:45] to such a young woman till a king wanted
[1:59:48] to marry her 90 years old
[1:59:54] Jesus said I am the resurrection and the
[1:59:56] life he that believeth in me though he
[1:59:57] were dead yet shall he live and
[2:00:00] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[2:00:02] shall never die believeth thou this yes
[2:00:06] and she said what now here faith comes
[2:00:10] back together again yes Lord yay Lord I
[2:00:14] believe that thou art the Christ the son
[2:00:17] of God which should come into the world
[2:00:22] so now she makes her profession now her
[2:00:24] faith is strong yes Lord I
[2:00:27] believe I believe you're the Christ I
[2:00:30] believe you're the Son of God I believe
[2:00:32] you're the one that should come in the
[2:00:34] world I've got full confidence you are
[2:00:36] the life you're the resurrection
[2:00:41] power and then Jesus walks up to the
[2:00:44] tomb now I'm want I'm want you to see
[2:00:46] and what the battle going back and
[2:00:49] forth and Jesus says in 112 39 I think
[2:00:54] it's
[2:00:55] 39 take away the
[2:00:58] stone now he knew that somebody had to
[2:01:04] do some
[2:01:05] part you got your part to
[2:01:09] do amen take away the stone that sin
[2:01:12] that lies at the door move the
[2:01:15] stone you want to see dead man
[2:01:19] walk come on got to move away the stone
[2:01:22] that's right you see men will put stones
[2:01:25] in front even of the lost and they would
[2:01:28] say oh Mercy's over you got to move that
[2:01:34] stone as long as you believe Mercy's
[2:01:36] over it is for you well I'll tell you
[2:01:39] I've sent away my day of Grace as long
[2:01:41] as you believe that and you keep that
[2:01:43] stone in there you can never have a
[2:01:47] resurrection you've got to believe it is
[2:01:50] far me it is not too late this is my
[2:01:54] moment amen it looks too late but God's
[2:01:58] right on time he has exactly the
[2:02:02] time brother Bram would get beyond the
[2:02:04] curtain at time and he would find a 90y
[2:02:07] old young now but a young woman
[2:02:10] beautiful who gave her life to Christ in
[2:02:13] his meetings at 90 years
[2:02:15] old long you know predestinated seats
[2:02:19] can go a long time before they're
[2:02:20] converted but he's going to get
[2:02:23] them goodness and mercy is on your Trail
[2:02:26] you can run you can hide you can go here
[2:02:29] you can go there you can commit it and
[2:02:31] the devil do every kind of thing to your
[2:02:33] life let the woman at the well and smear
[2:02:36] your life and wreck it and ruin it but
[2:02:38] let me tell you God Specializes and
[2:02:40] things thought impossible he'll do what
[2:02:43] no other power can do he'll reach
[2:02:46] further down than what you can look up
[2:02:52] he's God who'll get right down in the
[2:02:54] gutter where you are and bring you out
[2:02:58] and save
[2:03:01] you I don't know if I got another chance
[2:03:05] he's a god of first chances Second
[2:03:08] Chances third chances amen 10 chances 20
[2:03:13] chances 100 chances you can't put a
[2:03:16] number he's a god rich in Mercy a god
[2:03:19] rich in
[2:03:20] Grace men will try and put a stone up
[2:03:23] there and bring some chronic Creed or
[2:03:26] dogma and say Mercy is now over and
[2:03:28] nobody else can come in but you see when
[2:03:31] he opens a door no man can shut it and
[2:03:33] when he shuts it no man can open it man
[2:03:36] does not have the
[2:03:39] [Applause]
[2:03:43] power you got your part to
[2:03:47] do you got to move back to
[2:03:50] Stone you got to move back that unbelief
[2:03:52] that lays at the
[2:03:54] door that's holding your promise from
[2:03:57] you you got to put your faith to work
[2:03:59] you got to release your
[2:04:02] faith without works faith is
[2:04:07] dead a lot of dead Faith laying around
[2:04:10] but he's resurrection and the life
[2:04:21] now then here's still the
[2:04:25] battle and
[2:04:27] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[2:04:30] said to him
[2:04:31] Lord by this time he
[2:04:35] stinketh he's been dead for
[2:04:41] days now there's a war between the word
[2:04:47] and the
[2:04:48] reasoning and the eye and the senses
[2:04:52] that and what the eye and the senses can
[2:04:54] see and the impossibilities are now
[2:04:59] stated he's been dead four days and his
[2:05:02] body is rotten now he
[2:05:03] [Music]
[2:05:05] stinks we dare not roll away the stone
[2:05:08] we'll suffocate with the smell coming
[2:05:10] out of that
[2:05:12] tomb I tell you what you know there's a
[2:05:14] lot of smelly things in a dead man's
[2:05:18] tomb
[2:05:22] Hallelujah but God ain't ain't caring
[2:05:25] about how your sin smells and how rotten
[2:05:29] you are and how l in sin and what a
[2:05:32] wretched man or woman that you are God
[2:05:35] ain't caring about that he is the
[2:05:38] resurrection and the life he is greater
[2:05:40] than the stink in your
[2:05:45] life
[2:05:48] Hallelujah I don't care what the devil
[2:05:50] has done to you and what kind of dreads
[2:05:52] of humanity you've been down in amen
[2:05:55] this God don't care about your
[2:05:59] stink in one moment he can take your
[2:06:02] stink away
[2:06:12] that's now this war between the word
[2:06:15] what the reason I can see the senses is
[2:06:19] declared we can't roll away that
[2:06:22] stone everybody see it everybody smell
[2:06:25] it that's things in my life that I'm
[2:06:28] ashamed of I've been a wretched sinner
[2:06:32] I'm a
[2:06:33] dead the Bible says you're dead the
[2:06:37] Bible said you're dead in sin and every
[2:06:40] one of you have been
[2:06:42] dead amen but dead men are now
[2:06:46] walking Hallelujah there's many elus out
[2:06:49] of the Tomb this morning who can and say
[2:06:52] like Jesus I once was dead but now I am
[2:06:56] alive and I have the key to open any
[2:06:59] door that Satan would want to try to
[2:07:01] stop me because I am blood B Blood
[2:07:06] Washed
[2:07:11] redeemed watch
[2:07:13] now this war between the word and
[2:07:18] reasoning and Jesus said
[2:07:22] now the word comes again said I not unto
[2:07:27] thee that if thou wouldest
[2:07:30] believe thou should see the glory of
[2:07:33] God didn't I tell you that you're
[2:07:37] looking at the symptoms you're looking
[2:07:38] at how bad off is nobody's ever raised
[2:07:41] him to that yeah you you raised him with
[2:07:43] a son and name before she be you you you
[2:07:46] you before he was buried you raised the
[2:07:48] little girl that there at Gus's daughter
[2:07:51] before she was buried but this
[2:07:55] man ain't nobody ever been 4
[2:08:00] days and his soul was four days journey
[2:08:04] and Jesus had to go get it in the
[2:08:06] Unseen and say here come back here your
[2:08:09] time's not up on
[2:08:13] Earth I've got a purpose I'm going to
[2:08:15] preach the gospel through
[2:08:18] you hallelujah amen I I tell you what he
[2:08:22] went forth after that and his his life
[2:08:25] Lazarus life would preach the gospel
[2:08:28] that man was dead that's that dead man
[2:08:31] that's that man that was addicted that
[2:08:33] that's that man that woman that was in
[2:08:36] sin that's that Harlot out there that's
[2:08:38] that woman
[2:08:40] that Hallelujah but there you know again
[2:08:44] when Lazarus shows up at a at another
[2:08:47] meeting of Jesus they want to kill
[2:08:49] Lazarus what devil is you couldn't kill
[2:08:52] him the first time you can't kill him
[2:08:54] the second
[2:08:55] time amen if God can raise him up once
[2:08:58] he can raise him up
[2:09:01] again but what about you he'll raise you
[2:09:04] up and seal you to the day of redemption
[2:09:06] till Satan's sealed out and you're
[2:09:07] sealed
[2:09:16] in Jesus
[2:09:17] said didn't I tell you
[2:09:23] I need someone to
[2:09:26] believe and if you
[2:09:29] believe you'll see the glory of
[2:09:32] God if we'll
[2:09:34] believe we can have whatever we
[2:09:41] ask
[2:09:43] amen if we can get you to believe your
[2:09:47] lost family is going to be saved prodal
[2:09:50] will come home
[2:09:52] the angel of the Lord will go get
[2:09:56] him Hallelujah the angel of the Lord
[2:09:59] will go get up and say I've had enough
[2:10:02] of this sloth I've had enough of a pig's
[2:10:04] life I am not that anymore I I have a
[2:10:07] father and I'm going
[2:10:10] home I tell you friend he'll welcome you
[2:10:13] home he'll bring you there he'll put a
[2:10:15] robe up on you and a ring on your finger
[2:10:17] and restore you to sunship
[2:10:25] finally he gets him to do what he ask
[2:10:27] him to do they took away the Stone from
[2:10:30] the place where the dead was laid and
[2:10:32] Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father
[2:10:36] I thank you because you've hurt
[2:10:40] me and the Bible said he only prayed
[2:10:43] that way for their sakes CU he already
[2:10:47] knew he had been hurt of the father
[2:10:52] said I thank you that you've heard
[2:10:55] me and he called Lazarus come forth and
[2:11:00] a man who was dead four days came out I
[2:11:03] tell you there was such power in that
[2:11:06] word I'm talking about this word
[2:11:08] now this is God in printed for amen
[2:11:11] there's enough power in this word that
[2:11:14] if he had not have said
[2:11:16] Lazarus all the dead would have risen
[2:11:22] in fact he proved he could do that
[2:11:24] because when he rose all the dead of the
[2:11:27] Old Testament Saints rose with
[2:11:34] him now without unbelief out the way
[2:11:37] Jesus thanks God for the resurrection by
[2:11:39] power before he even sees it happening
[2:11:42] he thanks him for the miracle thank you
[2:11:44] Father you've Hur me you know that's the
[2:11:45] way you've got to pray you got to pray
[2:11:48] believing God heard you
[2:11:51] amen you you said well I spoke it in the
[2:11:53] seen realm but it was heard in the
[2:11:55] Unseen
[2:11:57] realm come on Amen there again Jesus
[2:12:02] thank thank God for the resurrection
[2:12:03] Miracle before even seen it happen and
[2:12:06] that's the way with you you got to start
[2:12:07] thanking God before you even see it
[2:12:11] happen you want the Holy Ghost well I
[2:12:14] tell you look and see the Promise for
[2:12:16] you repent of your sins and go to
[2:12:18] thanking God for he'll fill you with the
[2:12:20] Holy Ghost
[2:12:21] when you come with that Assurance with
[2:12:24] that with that knowledge of his word
[2:12:26] I'll give you the Holy Ghost I will not
[2:12:28] give you a serpent or a stone I will
[2:12:31] give you as a good father would give the
[2:12:33] Holy Ghost to everyone that
[2:12:41] ask see that's when
[2:12:44] two omnipotence meet when one omnipotent
[2:12:49] now I'm quoting from Brother bradam from
[2:12:51] uncertain sound when one omnipotent she
[2:12:56] had she had omnipotent faith in Christ
[2:13:00] and Christ was
[2:13:03] omnipotent but I want you to stop for a
[2:13:05] minute you say well if I have a battle
[2:13:08] that don't mean I have
[2:13:10] it
[2:13:12] no that means Satan's pretty sure you
[2:13:15] got
[2:13:17] it so he tries this side and he tries
[2:13:20] that that
[2:13:22] punch so he comes to Jesus and said if
[2:13:25] thou be and Jesus defeats him with the
[2:13:29] word well if you had a
[2:13:33] battle stop for a
[2:13:36] minute many of you worry about
[2:13:40] Temptation I'm tempted to do
[2:13:43] wrong well I
[2:13:48] guess you always will be
[2:13:52] Satan's going to come he's going to
[2:13:53] tempt you all the
[2:13:56] time but we don't yield to
[2:13:59] Temptation we come against him with the
[2:14:02] word Jesus was tempted of the devil so
[2:14:05] will you be tempted of the Devil he's
[2:14:08] going to come to you today this week
[2:14:11] whenever he will
[2:14:12] come and he will come and he'll lay
[2:14:15] Temptations for you it happens to me all
[2:14:16] the time it happens all the time
[2:14:22] I have to turn my head like every other
[2:14:24] man
[2:14:26] does amen I have to resist evil like
[2:14:29] every other person
[2:14:31] does I get stupid thoughts just like you
[2:14:35] get you think while you're holy and
[2:14:38] you're way up here no I I am up here and
[2:14:41] I am
[2:14:42] Holy but I also have
[2:14:46] temptations said brother Tim you're
[2:14:49] bragging on your I'm bragging on Jesus
[2:14:51] the Bible said he had made us to sit in
[2:14:53] Heavenly places amen that is high places
[2:14:57] amen he has positioned me in
[2:15:00] him watch now the these omnipotence
[2:15:04] these omnipotence she had she had
[2:15:06] omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ
[2:15:08] was omnident he said she had perfect
[2:15:11] infinite faith in Christ that he was the
[2:15:14] Lord and knew whatever he would ask God
[2:15:17] God would give him in other words you
[2:15:18] just speak the word and that's all you
[2:15:20] have to do whatever you have to ask
[2:15:22] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[2:15:24] you that's omnipotence all powerful
[2:15:27] because he just said so and all right
[2:15:30] and he was all powerful and that's when
[2:15:33] two Powers two omnipotent Powers meet
[2:15:36] together it's a contact then then when a
[2:15:39] line here has got 150 volts and this is
[2:15:42] has 150 volts they come together and you
[2:15:45] you got 10050 volts both ways and when
[2:15:48] you have supreme power when Jesus said
[2:15:50] let hands on the sick and they shall
[2:15:53] recover and you got supreme faith and
[2:15:55] that being the truth you need a supreme
[2:15:58] god that made a promise and a supreme
[2:16:01] result will
[2:16:02] happen will
[2:16:05] come amen now I believe we're living a
[2:16:08] day where faith is
[2:16:14] rising I believe in a people who's
[2:16:17] having Rapture in
[2:16:19] faith and I'm speaking that over you
[2:16:22] right now we're are people of a
[2:16:25] Rapture and have Rapture in
[2:16:28] faith somebody's beginning to believe
[2:16:30] somebody's beginning to have faith and
[2:16:33] brother brother Brandon spoke about this
[2:16:35] injunction of time he said we're at the
[2:16:37] end time we're going into the Millennium
[2:16:40] every hand is pointing that way the old
[2:16:42] clock is ticking about two minutes to
[2:16:44] midnight omnipotence is speaking angels
[2:16:47] are appearing prophets are coming
[2:16:50] prophets are prophesying Visions are
[2:16:53] being poured out upon the people of this
[2:16:55] day and the gospel is preached and the
[2:16:58] sick is being raised up and the blind
[2:17:00] sees the death hears the devils are
[2:17:02] rages impersonators Janice and jambes
[2:17:05] are here but omnipotent
[2:17:11] speaks I'm going to
[2:17:15] just come down toward the end of
[2:17:19] things and I just want to say
[2:17:21] say Jesus said with that little Mustard
[2:17:26] Seed of
[2:17:28] Faith nothing shall be impossible unto
[2:17:32] you I just quoted
[2:17:35] Bible I've just quoted the words of
[2:17:38] Jesus nothing shall be impossible to you
[2:17:43] you see faith is
[2:17:45] powerful Faith created the
[2:17:48] world come on
[2:17:51] say well the word did no faith in the
[2:17:54] word created The
[2:17:57] World God had faith in his own word
[2:18:00] that's what he's trying to get you have
[2:18:02] faith in what he
[2:18:05] said amen and have faith in what he said
[2:18:07] you
[2:18:10] are now notice Faith the Bible tells you
[2:18:14] in Hebrews 11:33 that Faith subdued
[2:18:17] kingdoms it wrought righteousness it
[2:18:19] obtained promises stopped the mouth of
[2:18:21] lions it quenched the violence of the
[2:18:23] fire it escaped the edge of the sword it
[2:18:26] out of weakness was made strong it wa
[2:18:29] valan and fight it turn to flight the
[2:18:31] armies of the alien and face P power
[2:18:34] even raised the dead to life
[2:18:38] again so that's What Faith Can
[2:18:42] Do when
[2:18:44] two
[2:18:46] omnipotence meet
[2:18:55] let me just bring this to a
[2:18:58] moment and I want to talk
[2:19:01] about where we are right now in the
[2:19:06] service because in this
[2:19:09] service every time I
[2:19:11] preach I'm I am here for
[2:19:16] battle and I'm Waring against unbelief
[2:19:20] even evil spirits doubt
[2:19:24] confusion and I'm attacking
[2:19:28] it I'm not waiting for the enemy to come
[2:19:31] and bring the attack to you I am
[2:19:33] attacking the
[2:19:37] enemy now I want you to think of

[2:21:55] and look in the
[2:21:56] Unseen and see that there's a spirit
[2:22:00] hanging over
[2:22:01] you that won't let you fully accept God
[2:22:06] and believe his promise that he's done
[2:22:08] it so he's there right there attacking
[2:22:11] your

[2:23:09] won't let him do

[2:23:21] the devil's holding that boy why want he
[2:23:23] do right the devil's holding it he wants
[2:23:27] to do right but there's a
[2:23:29] spirit a power that won't let him do
[2:23:32] right now Hallelujah he
[2:23:35] says here it is no wonder if God would
[2:23:39] never let a true man of God ever say he
[2:23:41] could heal somebody Christ did that when
[2:23:43] he died I couldn't save nobody or no one
[2:23:45] else can save anybody but God can and
[2:23:49] God can't save you because he's he
[2:23:50] already done it and the reason the only
[2:23:53] thing you have to accept it it's already
[2:23:56] done I wasn't saved 20 years ago I was I
[2:23:59] was saved 1900 years ago but 20 years
[2:24:02] ago I received it and accepted it if it
[2:24:04] hadn't the first sin I'd done God would
[2:24:06] have wipe me off the face of the Earth
[2:24:08] because he said he would and he has to
[2:24:10] give his promise I was healed 1900 years
[2:24:13] ago but I've got to accept it now watch
[2:24:16] this and the only thing that kept me
[2:24:21] from being
[2:24:22] saved when I was 12 years
[2:24:25] old I stop here there's people in the
[2:24:29] church right here this morning you were
[2:24:32] here at 12 years old or maybe you was in
[2:24:35] another
[2:24:37] church 12 years
[2:24:40] old the only thing that kept me from
[2:24:42] being saved when I was 12 why 12 it's
[2:24:48] the age of accountability
[2:24:51] it's the age that Jesus was where he
[2:24:53] started doing father's business it was
[2:24:56] the age where you come and you are
[2:25:00] responsible before God for your sins
[2:25:04] you're no longer under your your
[2:25:07] parents your under under your parents
[2:25:10] now you're
[2:25:12] accountable and he says I would the only
[2:25:15] thing that kept me from being saved when
[2:25:18] I was 12 was because because a spirit
[2:25:22] hung over me a
[2:25:25] devil saying wait a little
[2:25:29] longer I want to ask you how has that
[2:25:32] worked out for
[2:25:38] you
[2:25:41] heartache
[2:25:42] divorce
[2:25:46] drugs
[2:25:47] alcohol prostitution
[2:25:54] all kinds of
[2:25:56] things it didn't work out so good did
[2:25:59] it brother Johnny by not accepting the
[2:26:02] Lord when you was 12 didn't work out so
[2:26:05] good for you did
[2:26:06] it took your life down into Life Of
[2:26:09] Heartache didn't it you want want want
[2:26:13] to see any 12y old to go down that path
[2:26:17] do
[2:26:18] you if that's not just him
[2:26:22] that's you and you and you and
[2:26:26] you but a spirit hung over you and
[2:26:31] pulled you into the
[2:26:35] crowd that same crowd of
[2:26:39] unbelief that was screaming at the
[2:26:42] disciples when they were given a
[2:26:44] commission and power and authority to
[2:26:47] cast Satan out but now he comes from the
[2:26:52] crowd and the crowd's voice lured you
[2:26:57] out you walked with the crowd to do
[2:27:01] evil because a spirit hung over you that
[2:27:06] said wait a little
[2:27:10] longer and that's the reason you wasn't
[2:27:13] saved when you come to the age of
[2:27:14] accountability and spirit got with the
[2:27:18] crowd that hovered over you and kept
[2:27:21] hanging over you you wanted to do
[2:27:24] right and that's the truth there's not a
[2:27:27] person that doesn't want to do right you
[2:27:30] want a good home you want a good
[2:27:32] marriage you want you you want to be a
[2:27:34] loving kind you want to be a good father

[2:27:44] but what wants to do right but there's
[2:27:46] something won't let you do right
[2:27:50] and that's the
[2:27:54] devil but your salvation's paid
[2:27:59] for but you got to quit listening to the
[2:28:04] crowd I want you to Bow your heads
