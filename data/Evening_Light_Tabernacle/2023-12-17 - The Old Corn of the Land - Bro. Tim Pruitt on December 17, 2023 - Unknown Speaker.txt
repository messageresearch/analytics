again amen what a mighty God we serve today amen God bless you let's turn to Joshua chap 5 and we'll read from verse 10 this morning Joshua 5: 10 I'm going to be speaking on the the old corn of the land and uh we're going to look here into the word of God today and praying that he will just speak to you in a wonderful way today and reveal himself and uh as we speak the word you know faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God and and that we wanting to just Place us where we are in time and what God is doing in the day and hour that we're living in and remember remember my little story that I had of going on a trip and and uh you know and and needing a map and yet as we went along on the journey there uh we got lost along the way and and uh the brother asked me said uh well brother Tim look on this map and tell us where we are and I said well no can't do it that way you have to know where you're at I said so you since you got lost go in there and ask him where are we so once we found out where we were I could find on the map and get where we were going that brother was George Hamilton you know that amen we told the story many many times God bless you brother George you have blessed many many with that little incident he says I embellished that story and I should have really told it right but um because we could you know we could have a lot of good times with that but anyway you know it took in this day God to send us a prophet we had a road map but it took us a a prophet in this day to open up the scripture and say okay here's where you come from and now here's where you're at you're way over here in the back of the book at the last Church age and where the seventh angel sounds his message and and of course and laying beyond that is the Tribulation period that thank God we're raptured and don't go through and and then finally over into the battle of Armageddon which we will be a part of we're already the winners amen it's already said in the book we win then we we're going to come come on down to to all the way to the new heaven heavens and the new Earth and my you know the word of God is so rich and so full and I'm so glad that we can be a part of that today Joshua 5:10 and the children of Israel encamped in gilgal and kept the Passover on the 14th day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the tomorrow after the Sabbath uh on the tomorrow after the Passover and unleavened cakes and parts corn in the S same day and the Mana ceased on the tomorrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel Mana anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year God bless you as you are seated now we we have used the type of Israel's Journey as we have traveled you know from um uh all the way from Egypt to the promised land and you know and and of course that is a shadow of the church as it takes its Journey leaving Egypt and his and then of course the Wilderness Journey where the Mana is poured out we and we use this type in this way that we we have been on the journey and we have left Egypt and of course we will go to the Millennium and until the Millennium there is Mana which is a type of the Holy Ghost he would pour out the holy spirit all the way to the Millennium so if you just stop and think about it he even seals in 144,000 with the Holy Spirit after the Gentiles leave so the Holy Spirit still keeps falling uh and it ends for the Gentiles and then we'll go to the Jews so you know we have used it in that way today we're going to use the type differently and and this is one reason why that I have chosen to do the uh overhead we're going to be using the types uh we're going to be speaking about Moses and where he types in this picture um where that uh they come up to to Kadesh Baria and continued on Into the Wilderness and then and of course um but today we're going to use a type differently of the Mana or the food during the Wilderness the Mana that would only last for the day for for each age like of Luther or Wesley or Pentecost having fresh Mana every day you could not keep Luther's message over to Wesley's day because it had denominated and it it bred worms and it stank and and Mana cannot be held over unto another day so the types we're going to use today is originally the the church was like the family of Abraham so journeying in the land of promise now they didn't fully possess it um and you know they it was the promise was given they walked over it they claimed it and um and of course then they were taken down into Egypt for 400 years and so but there um the the church has been like the family of Abraham originally we were in the promised land the church was in the fullness of the word of God Amen the the Mysteries had been revealed to the Apostle Paul the truth of the word now of course the symbols and the things in the Book of Revelation that would speak in our day he did know of that but things like predestination the security of the believer or water baptism by immersion these truths that got lost down to the ages Paul understood that and brought it to the church so you know they in effect they are the old corn are the produce of the land so you see we we are coming now to where we are again R returned turning to the land eating of the old produce of the land what what the land provides what the word of God which is our Promised Land provides for us it all Lays in the word of God we we're not just having a temporary blessing of Mana coming down and and then that getting old and stinking and and and have to be renewed and refreshed and with another move of God and but no this is where we enter into the land of promise uh we into the promised land of the entire word of God and here we have every divine blessing we are like Ephesians 1 we are blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so you see we just as Israel um Jacob and his family would be taken down to Egypt and and they would die down there and of course live for 400 years so the first age left its first love and it started drifting but now that there has been a journey that has been taking place actually since the reformation and the Church of course has went down to um you know is went down to Egypt at n of Rome and uh but however there's been was a Deliverance made from Egypt's bondage and so now to come out was not the promised land but they were headed toward it they were making a journey toward it and so Luther's message was a great message in that it would deliver them from the the the bonds of of Egyptian if we'd call it or Babylonian or you could call it Roman bondage where the church had been down in slavery now under popes and Bishops and ideas of man now for hundreds of years but now God was bringing an exodus out of that into the promised land and the the church would start its Journey at the Reformation beginning with Luther and and uh go back to to head toward coming closer to you know Miran are looking toward that land of Peter James John and Paul right amen so but now of course as Israel would leave the land of Egypt and start along the journey they would have camps along the road they would camp in different places the these camps would have different names that were given to them they would be camped at the springs or the Waters of Mara or they would be camped finally at kades Baria and then then on other camps in the wilderness now of course you know the camps along the road for us has been Luther and Wesley and isusa street now these are just the major camps or the major stops along the journey they are now over 40,000 denominations are places where the church is camped that's now you know you you can still see the ashes of the camps you know the the Baptist ashes of Methodist ashes where the memories of you know where Luther was or Wesley was or how God moved in the ages past and so you can still find those relics and you know memorial stones or you know where where they were at and one of them's called Luther or Wesley or zeza street but now again you know you know each one of them in their time has always has every one of them have come to their own Cades Baria in other words to a judgment seat where the decision was made and where we are today is no longer journeying from one Camp to a another camp this message is not about building another denomination it is not another station along or stopping place in the desert or in the wilderness but the bride of Christ I would like to say today is no longer a Wilderness dweller they're no longer wandering in the wilderness we have arrived to the land of milk and honey we are now eating the produce of the land spoke of here as the old corn of the land it wasn't that it was old but it's what it's what Abraham ate it's what Isaac had it's what what all of them down to the the in the past had that's why they're calling it old corn you see this wasn't a part of their Wilderness diet are you with me they had mana and which was temporary blessings that was coming down and if they tried to keep it over to the next day it would breed worms and stink amen so it had to be renewed they would have to again every day get a new Supply now now I I just want to say we are no longer wandering in the wilderness but unfortunately that all who claim the message have not crossed over into this land of abundant resources they're still on the other side in camps where that they have elected leaders to take them back to Egypt in other words to have the similar bondage to have the similar things but to go back to the way it was under the spirit of Catholicism and this of course is called Nick ISM to conquer the Ley to bring them into bondage to take away from them the Glorious Freedom that belongs to us in Christ now as I said each movement has had is Cades Baria every denomination has come to its Jordan where it died refusing to go in the land and said not one of them will cross over now let's let's understand the Joshua commission and and we're we're want to look at here because we have to have a Joshua to lead us into this promised land that would be need to be a transition from the Wilderness journey to possessing the promises now so the Book of Joshua starts out Moses my servant is dead now if you if you just see here Moses and the type we we will see that it types the denominations and the ages now I know you don't like to think of that but this is the way that brother Bram typed it he said Moses coming through the Wilderness here would actually type the denominations and the ages but and the Book of Joshua starts out Moses my servant is dead now Moses would represent the law and assist system of religion that had come to its Jordan and it had led them right up to the Border but it could not take them over remember this no denomination or a man-made system can ever take you over into the full promise only the supernatural workings of almighty God can do that amen now so you see um so now we're going to we're going to speak about Joshua in the type here in a moment but brother bradam says about him he said how Joshua must have felt standing that morning talk to God I will not fail thee that as I was with Moses so will I be with you in other words as I I blessed them leaving the bondage of denominationalism and and starting out you know on the journey toward the Promised Land and the miraculous things that I did so will I be with you as I was with Moses I'll be with you no man shall stand before you all the days of your life he said I want to make that way clear only be strong and courageous don't be afraid I'm with you and I'll see you through what a commission this was given to the new man called Joshua so there's been lots of types here we could go into but he said we can we'll bypass some of them for instance MOS was like the church age that brought them to SI to their Theology of last night Moses was not permitted to take the children of Israel over into the promised land because he had failed now again he continues to explain and the church organizations and denominations has failed they will not take the church over God God will raise up a new system an inter denominational system in other words not you know a a a a Believers made up of all walks of life Baptist Methodist Presbyterian catholic whatever coming you know many times people are saying oh that we could just have that Unity brother brandom talked about well if you look out here this morning you will see Baptist and Methodist and Pentecostals and Catholic all worshiping in the same building under the unity of the spirit the very thing that he desired to see is happen because we heard a voice that said come out of her my people and we have all entered into this Promised Land yes sir Hallelujah so you see and and again so he said it would it'll tell God would raise up a new system in denominational system by the power of God that it take the church into the promised land now Moses had failed and he was a lawgiver Joshua was called a Grace and he took the church over Moses failed he could not take them over this is something brother Brandon would hammer over and over again that that it would be impossible for them to take it over just a minute let me just look at my slides just a minute let me see where we're at here I want to just I just want to see um where where we're at here okay I didn't quite get all the the quotes that I wanted in here but nevertheless we will paraphrase them as we go along so now again as we as we look at this the J the Book of Joshua he said was the Ephesians of the Old Testament now let's look at it like this you know Joshua was the book in the Bible where God placed the people into their inheritance where they took over their land of promise the book of Ephesians for the New Testament is the book like Joshua that places us in our inheritance what what is it do it begins that you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world what's he doing he's placing you as to where your origin is so that you would know your destiny yes sir are you with me you knew you came from God and you're going back to God no matter what's in between here and there that doesn't matter no matter how many Falls and bumbles and mistakes you make along the way it doesn't matter what matters is you were there and his thinking there and he's already seen your D Destiny your destiny has been set to complete adoption of sons by Jesus Christ in other words recognition that you're a child of God that you are an heir to the promises of God so therefore he has blessed you with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you are a blessed people in this land so again you see the Joshua of the Old Testament was the Ephesians of the of is if like the Ephesians of the new it's a a book of redemption so he says again that book of Ephesians of the Old Testament Joshua where Moses represented the law could save no one but Grace could and Joshua is here the same word like Jesus Jehovah savior now we find out when we come to another another other Ephesians where that in that our intellectual denominations and so forth all our educational program has come to its Jordan and then we must have an Ephesians again you see this is what brother Brandon was was telling us that that all systems of man have come to his Jordan you know it it has come to his time of death and and and there if they wouldn't go in the land they went back into wanderings you know we we passed many churches on our way to church today and and I I just say God bless them all you know I I I don't want in my heart to criticize any of them or look down my nose at them and I don't want you to you know they're struggling wanding around the Wilderness many of them circling around the same mountain of doctrines over and over and over again because somebody somebody in the in the where God was moving at that time they came to their Cades and refused to go in but even then there may be a Joshua or a Caleb among them that God will pull out and take them [Applause] in so we don't throw out criticism at it there's many many many that are like that and God have mercy upon them because and may there be life for them in the in the Great Tribulation or wherever you know at the white judgment Throne judgment to come that's not that's not for me to decide what my decision is what I'm decide is I must I must take my inheritance you can't just look at the them and thou and them those and what them and look at them and them what about you that's are you possessing everything that God said for you you see so he would tell us in the breach between the seals he said that that this book this this seven sealed book this book of redemption which is the Bible is not revealed until the church ages and denominational ages has run out and there's no more time it's revealed after the Church ages and denominational ages has run out in other words we we have run out of Ages we've come one two three four five six S no more ages ages are over Church ages are done we're here at the very end before the Rapture we're standing right here as the Overcomers to be caught up before him in the throne and experience Revelation 41 and I heard a trumpet likee voice from Heaven saying come up hither that's what the trumpet says if you want to know when the trumpet sounds it's going to say something what it is it is the call to come up here to leave the Earth to leave the the world of sin that you're in and be caught up and that happens right at the close of the leoan age and we have arrived yes I can point on the map and say here we are not by my authority a prophet told me amen now but he said but that's the reason that things in such a scruple tonight he said they pick up a little doctor and they run off on this side and say this is it and another picks up another doctor and runs off this side say this is it and each one builds a denomination under until we got hundreds of denomination but still it's all all all of it to see the confusion the people are wondering what is the truth and and that's it if you went on the quest today how are you going to find truth there's 40,000 denominations and by the time you sort through all of them your lifetime is over visiting that one go here you know studying this one how how are you going to know this this is why God vindicates a message to show you with so you will not have a doubt amen that this is my voice this is my servant this is my way now what is the ti why is the type of Joshua entering in the land and possessing divided an inheritance why is that so important to us why are we even looking at that because it is a prophecy of our day and represents our message now stop for a minute remember remember I I try to bring it to you over and over again that which is that which has been done in the Bible every character of The Bible all down to the scripture is a shadow there's something that is coming and as it approaches it makes a shadow so just like you see the Shadow on my Bible you know it shows that there is something that is approaching and it's making a shadow and the the closer it comes the more defined the shadow is if you'll look right here you know you can look and sometimes it looks like there's actually two or three shadows right there and this is where people get two or three three Gods because in the shadow is not plain amen but when the word comes and as it the more it approaches the clearer and the more defined that it gets until the two the two becomes one and I want you to know that we are not typing another generation to come we are the positive of those negatives they were prophesying of us we are not prophesying of another age but we are the age of the Fulfillment of all prophecies so the prophecy of our day of course would be found in the scripture this is why we're looking at the at Joshua because brother brandham said you know it's the Ephesians of the Old Testament it's the placing in the land and if you go look and see what God did you'll get an idea of what he's doing now now as we as we look it is a prophecy because we too have returned to the land of our fathers after the church so Journey Down in Egypt learning Egyptian ways getting confused on deity having a trinity baptism having everything scrup and messed up and God has been bringing us on a journey the church on a journey to the promised land to the land of full inheritance it is the land of the New Covenant of Jesus Peter James John and Paul it is it is the land of the prophets of Elijah Isaiah Ezekiel the land of the Patriarchs of Abraham Isaac and Jacob it is our land you know this is where Israel is today there they they go over there and they dig up at Shiloh and and they find it the the ancient names of of the the place and ancient names of the people that was there and little Clues here and little Clues there Philistines can't do that pales Ians can't do that do do you hear what I'm saying all the Arabs can't do that only the Jews can do that right because that's their forefathers this was their land predated before any of them and I I want to say this that this was our line before the Catholics messed it up before the Baptists the Presbyterians the others made made a mess out of things come on Amen this was our land first and we have returned to the land of the Bible Amen to where every Divine promise of God that lays in the Land Is Ours where that we are fulfilling every type that spoke of the Bride now so now as we're looking at this we're we're going to we've talked about Moses and the type now he does he does not type and I want to get this clear he does not in this in in this way at all type brother brandom he is typing the denominational system I just read you quotes I intended to have them up but I didn't get them so I read them to you but nevertheless as we look here Al also in Joshua about Joshua Joshua will type the end time leader to take us into the promised land I'll read this quote again another time it might be a little redundant on it but let me just say you know here in this in this instance where where that Joshua and the type brother brandham as you know he would receive the a hand come down out of heaven and I'll go into more details in that I saw the Bible in hand come come down in the room and St where I at a hand from above came down and parted the pages and turned them out and come slowly to Joshua 1 to the 9th verse and stop going down slowly so he would actually the hand would come down out of heaven and point to brother branam his commission now remember I want you to say say it types the end time leader that will take us into the promised land now so again Joshua in the type it it it shows that in Joshua in the Hebrew means savior it represents the promis Endtime leader to take the church over Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua remember not just Joshua took the land but there was also the some calebs amen a Caleb that also stood with him and said we can do it amen so every person has to have their kades Baria moment and go and say we can take this land This Is Our Land now again Joshua means Jehovah's Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader and Caleb rep represents Caleb represents that now so here again Joshua is not brother Brandon you say well but you just said he was no he's the end time leader that uses a man stop just for a moment it was not it was not Joshua who won the Battle of Jericho there was the Lord himself came down sword in his hands and said this is my battle that's right and I'm in charge I'm the captain I am the leader I want you to understand this this we are not following a man and his message we are following God and his message but he happens to use a man I'm going to do a work in that day and you'll no wise believe it because a man will bring it so man you know have that trouble you know of of accepting but Joshua is the holy spirit that would lead the church through his servant the prophet the one in charge is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he stands with his sword drawn Furnishing the battle plans to remove move every devil off of the land of promis come on I want to just say today he's still in charge he's still with us even now amen he's still the mighty Jehovah with his sword drawn to chase every devil off your land to give you the battle plan of how to defeat your enemy I don't care what it is I don't care what kind of unbelief it is is I don't care what kind of cancer or disease or what he is in charge and he is leading the battle he knows how to defeat the enemy and he knows exactly the [Applause] time and sometimes he'll just tell you to March around in silence till I tell you to shout the victory but whatever it is don't murmur and complain and fuss and wonder and Ponder and say well God ain't doing nothing yes he is just keep marching like he said now let's remember why Joshua was chosen Moses had died Moses represented the law in the wilderness Journey he represents the many camps along the journey as I said 40,000 denominations God had used him he done marvelous things great things as he says in Israel in the church that Martin Luther saw the pillar of fire move and when he came out of the Catholic church he followed the pillar of fire and he brought 10, thousands of them out and then Martin Luther built under that Pillar of Fire and when he got down there first thing he made he made a a great organization in other words a camp they Camp there called the Lutheran Church both one day the pillar of fire began to move again but Martin Luther couldn't move because he was organized he had to stay there that's right and a little fell into England by the name of John Wesley and saw it and Martin Luther said the just shall live by faith and now John Wesley said that Jesus suffered within the out the gates that he might sanctify the people with his own blood he seen sanctification the pillar of fire moved on but Luther couldn't move because he was organized and then he goes on to say they then they couldn't move so John Wesley saw the pillar of fire and he moved after it he saved the Nation about three or four nations was in moral Decay and John Wesley saw the pillar of fire and started the Wesley Revival that swept around the world and come out here him and Asbury and them and save the day and then the first thing you know John Wesley organized so tight the pillar of fire began to move again and and um and Wesley couldn't move because he was organized and the Pentecostal people saw it and away they went that's right it left Wesley sitting in the shade and God laid him on the Shelf with Luther all right now the first thing you know they had a great Revival a Pentecost Revival restoration of the gifts and so forth and the first thing you know the pillar of fire has began to move again but Pentecost is so organized it can't go brother that hurt didn't it that's good it's so organized crystallized so it can't go that's right that's true but the pillar of fire is moving out brother and there's people that's going with it Hallelujah we are bound for the promised land so you see at cadus Baria they were to go up and take the land but they didn't they said they were unable and they brought back an evil report of the land you know what they said let's bring it modernize it a little bit they said it was only for God's Prophet it was only for his days you know it was only to vindicate him that John 14:12 was only for him to fulfill that prayer lines were for days past this is the evil report that tongues and other gifts of the Spirit was only for Spiritual babies and the immature that all spiritual gifts were on the shelf that that which is perfect had come and everything else is done away with that we don't receive the Holy Ghost as it did on the day of Pentecost that we Gentiles just believe the word that we called the Holy Ghost just fleshly emotions and evil report notice this as we go in there this this is what happened that the Bible said that in the Book of Numbers remember when they left Kadesh and started their wandering that immediately they got to thirsting and they spake against God and Moses and said wherefore have you brought us up out of this Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither there is in water and our soul Lo is is like bread even the revelations and the truths that they had received now [Music] become disdained and the Lord sent fiery serpents among them and they bit the people and much of the people died and this made for had church members don't hang up on me this is what happened this made they they you know God was sending Mana but they complained about that so God sent them fiery serpents and they were bit of them and this made dead church members for instead of God sending the fire of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit he let them suffer the fire of serpents and now they were bitten and they die they become mortified on the Pew crystallized dead amen sermons become dead church members become dead dead sermons you know make for dead people dead sermons kill are you with me this made for denominational Pew waren and Christians who lusted for the leaks and garlics wanting the flavor of Education every denomination made their schools and Seminary to educate their Ministry in culinary skills to flavor the food served in their churches well let me just quote some of the flavor well the Bible's not to be taken literally some Miracles were explained way Moses really didn't cross through the Red Sea but through a sea of reeds before long the miraculous was explained way so flavored with Egypt's garlic until not even the Virgin birth was believed see even even some some years ago brother Bram talks about it and it's true that the Methodist wanted anything about the blood taken out of their song books cuz they didn't want no bloody gory religion you know some and and you got where church members out many of them will not even believe in the Virgin birth and even I'm going to bring it now this is a little bit hard but some within the message Community now minimize the Corporal physical return of Christ saying he's already came when the word was open and of course he did he came in the form of the word but there's still a Corporal coming that's right are you with me amen so again others deny the working of Miracles and gifts of the Spirit and say that were only for the apostles or or the prophet to vindicate the New Testament that's what they would say in denomination they say it in the message community that was only now for the prophet and you know that which is perfect is come we have perfect word and So speaking in tongues is done away with that's not what the prophet said the prophet said now we do have today by by Divine Vindication the the perfect interpretation of the word of God so jumping up and down like a kid and trying to speak with tongues is over so trying to speak with tongues getting somebody down the Altar and jiggle their chin up and down and manufacture a gift that's over but tongues can't be over that's Bible That's Right a prophet could not even dismiss it and say it's no more applicable it's the Bible Paul said I I would did you all spoke in tongues rather but rather that you prophesied so the fiery serpents there among many remove the gifts of the Spirit and and and and tries to with the bites bring that poison in you see every generation comes to his cadesh Baria I can bring out quotes to you where brother brandham would say brandham Tabernacle you are at kades barnea Pentecost you are at kades Baria you know again in every every age every time has their own Revival every move has its own chance at the word and so everyone will come to their Cades Baria and say well we just can't take it it ain't the season it's not the right time we this ain't for us and they'll go back into wandering every generation has the opportunity to go into the fullness of the word you have it this morning every person sitting on your this Pew today are in in it's your own right hasn't had to have your Cades Baria moment amen the lutherans came out of the Catholic Move whose Mana had bred worms and stank and and they the Catholics that stood at Cades and were refused they were offered to taste the the taste of justification and refus to go on and they fulfill the scripture let me see if I have the scripture up excuse me here just a minute all right so Hebrews 6 which it says for it is impossible here they fulfill this scripture it is impossible for those who were once enlightened tasted of the Heavenly gift Catholics would taste of justification you don't have to be saved by crawling on your hands and knees doing Penance you can be Justified and forgiven by Faith No More do you have to B buy a candle and burn for for a loved one they're forgiven by Grace but you see that would come to that Cades moment and refuse to go in and they would die in the wilderness now again he said and they have tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the world will come if they shall fall away to renew them to repent to see and they crucify the Son of God of fresh and put him to an open shame and every movement down there there can be no Revival you will not be a Revival Catholic Methodist Baptist none of them none of them will have a Revival the only Revival that there will be is a bride's Revival and we're in it we're a part of it and it didn't start at evening like Tabernacle it started because the lamb took the book and opened up the Seven Seals revealing the mysteries of God that started the bride's Revival now so the Lutheran came to Kadesh Baria when when Wesley brought the fruit of sanctification and offered it to them to taste and they stayed with their organizational system saying well we've received from Heaven this mana and it was Mana from heaven but they had kept it over for another day and it stank and bread w worms Wesley with his sanctification movement went forward but they also came to their Cades refusing speaking in tongues and they also fulfilled the same scripture it's impossible to renew yourselves because they refused speaking in tongues and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at ausa street so they also fulfilled Hebrews 6 and 4 and then lusus Street got the taste of the powers of the world to come standing at their Cades and refused to go over once again you see once again it was here here there was at cadesh and they turned back in the wilderness and what's now they will go out there and they will get thirsty and Moses will Smite The Rock to try to bring them some new thing remember the original atonement is to where was where The Rock was smitten that was 2,000 years ago at Calvary you do not have to Smite The Rock again you speak to the Rock it's already been smitten but you see every movement comes along and it's another smiting of the rock bringing trying to bring something new out of Christ trying to bring a new doctrine trying to bring a new teaching starting a new system of organization another man as a leader so lack of water at kades caused Moses to Smite The Rock and there was plenty of water in the promised land but they refused to go over did you hear what I said if they' have went in the promised land there was plenty of water there was streams and rivers and abundance m land flowing of milk and honey but in the wilderness they get thirsty again now it's in the wilderness that Moses glorifies himself and this is the problem you see those movements have men as their leaders and what they do is glorify themselves look who we are we're the great church and they Smite The Rock trying to bring out l to the people and it's not Abundant Life come on no it's not AB the Abundant Life lays in the promised land flowing with milk and honey this is Desert out here now so Moses brother brandom tells us a message of Grace he said Moses that great leader God should have killed him when he went down there to glorify himself by smiting The Rock and he said you see what I can do in other words you rebels must we fetch you water from this rock and he smoted it and the waters didn't come and he smoted it again what did he do he testified of the weakness of Christ because Christ was that rock that's a headstone instead of speaking to it it was smitten once that's when it was to be remember God told Moses over in Exodus go and I'll Stand before you before the rock Smite The Rock and then he smoked the Rock and it brought forth Waters the next time you go speak the rock it'll bring forth those Waters but Moses wanted to show he had a little authority a little power and he said I'll bring you water out of this rock and God should have killed him for it God should have separated him there he broke God's law there because he spoke of the weakness of Christ he had to be has to be smitten the second time Christ was only smitten once now we speak the Rock and it bring forth this water so in the ever presentes water from the Rock brother bandam talks about this how that then when they wandered off the path when they refused to go in at cadus barnea you know that and they got into ISM and adopted things like Apostles Creed and and catechism and and denominations instead of experience and shaking hands instead of a born again experience adopted sprinkling instead of water baptism they adopted an evil form of Father Son and Holy Ghost when there's no such a thing in the Bible the Bible said in the name name of Jesus Christ there's only one thing to do if you want to if you want that same water is come back to the path again now so he goes on to tell he said you take the Creeds in the stead of Christ you wander off in Tantrums one said I'm a Methodist the other said I'm a Baptist that shows you're not a Christian then we are Christ we belong to him well if me a Baptist it's all right if that's all you are then you're none of Christ you're a Baptist well I'm Pentecostal if you're just Pentecostal by denomination that's all you are but if you got the Pentecostal experience and the Pentecostal word will bring for the Pentecostal experience follow the same thing those disciples did stay there till you get filled with the Holy Ghost and then if you if that you get contrary to the word that spirit in you goes contrary to what the word said then it isn't the holy spirit it's the devil impersonating the holy spirit so he continues on and he said Christ was to be smitten once and he said he smoted him now the second time and he said Moses was setting up something new trying to make a new thing and that's the way our clergymen have done they tried to make something new and we'll make ourselves the Assembly of God we'll make ourselves the Pentecostal Church of God we'll make oursel the general counsel we'll make oursel this that or the other that's not what God did that was not his idea now if you bring it bring that forward what have we done many the message Community came to its on Cades Maria and we make ourselves tape only our Coleman's Thunders our veils perua or two Lord you know what it is it's smiting The Rock again it will water a thirst and people but it doesn't bring them into the promised land people get excited and have a little Revival over this new doctrine but he don't bring them into the fullness of the promise they're still in the wilderness you see Christ was to be smitten once that's the original experience amen and and and every everyone must have that experience that's the original way Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and we'll spray we sprinkle Father Son and Holy Ghost and give all kinds of Creeds and whatever when we get off the word you know that's what happens you wind up in wanderings and the same thing has happened in the message Community you see God is trying to bring us to place where where that we we are in the land of promise and subject to everything that is there you see that but he said they're smiting The Rock again to start something new we don't need a new doctor and the last thing the message Community needs is another man to raise up that knows it all going to be the Joshua to lead us in and really it's just a captain to take you back to Egypt again we've already had the Joshua that's and by now you should have crossed over into the land yes sir and if you're not there the opportunity is still there the stragglers there they can still come across the Jordan still come into the promised land where all things are possible to them that believe where that Every Word of Promise can be yours Hallelujah were the same signs that followed them follows you amen but but there again this is what happens is that that man come along and raise up and try to bring you down take you to another Camp hidden always away from the promised land remember when they came out to get us they moved away from the promised land and go to circle around and around the mountain now we have journeyed a long time and we needed a Joshua amen and we know that right now even the promised land is in sight and and you know we've had men that raised up to the ages denominational ages you know but the Bible promise that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he sounds his message then the mystery of God would be finished then there would be a people that would be back in the land and I I just want you to know that God already has his Joshua the end time leader to take us into the prise now this was of course would be the prophet of Malachi 4 he was sent to restore us to the faith of the fathers what Abraham Isaac and Jacob had this is what Israel would get come on when they left Egypt and got into the land the same thing that had on the day of Pentecost this is what we are to have right here in the land every promise that lays in the Bible belongs to us do the prophet bringing restoration of Malachi 4 so now God had chosen brother brandham to to take a message of Divine Healing listen I I don't know how we get away from the supernatural when this message is rooted in the Supernatural listen this is not it it is not rooted and somebody just had a good thought or or you know studied the Bible and come up with this or that idea what happened there was a man there in 1946 being told of his misunderstood ways and you know that he was of the devil and he wanted all of these things to to leave him these these visions that he was having he was told it was of the devil and he he went away to pray about it and when he did there in the middle of the night here come a light into into the room and out of that light walked a 6ot tall man an angel of God in white robe hair to shoulders looking there at him and said that I have come from been sent from the presence of God to tell you of your misunderstood life and I'm sending you with a message of Divine Healing and this is going to forun the second coming of Christ this is going to initiate the second coming of Christ and I wanted just to say we're in it as a result of that visitation we are in it in that you know right in that same time frame 1946 1948 do you know in that same time frame here come Israel as a nation you know the Bible said that the tree that when you see the tree the Fig Tree puts forth his buds Israel's a viig tree and then it says in all the other trees so you had then a Revival that started taking a place in the denomination Billy Graham raises up come on you have all Roberts for the Pentecostal and they've been getting put forth branches right come on Amen the United Nation would start there and Gathering the Nations together and and they're all in this the World Council of churches would started the same time all Gathering Together are you with me a Revival was going on and at the same time the angel of God appeared first to a prophet of God sending a message and if you can look at see Israel in their rev having a Revival in their land and the Baptists and the Pentecostals have their Revival come on then what about the bride because that's what he said I will restore sayeth the Lord so already God had chose him to take a message in 1946 now in 1951 he would visit South Africa and he would learned there a very important lesson because he had you know tried to be inner denomination you know I don't care if you're one H hump two H hump camel whatever whatever you you believe Jesus coming on cloud you believe he's coming on a horse you know as long as you believe he's coming which is actually the framework of charismatic movement today we don't really care what you believe just as long as you believe in the gifts long as you believe in healing so in 1951 he would go to South Africa and he would learn there a very important lesson he would find out that denominations with political men would exalt themselves over the Vindicated word and would cause him to stray from the Vindicated path it was in September 1951 which is the beginning of summer for South Africa brother Sydney Jackson he was a man that you might have heard of brother brandham talks about him on tape but he was sitting there well you know one day praying and he heard himself say William Marian branam well this surprised him he had read about William brandham the American evangelist though had not been on his mind said but who was Marian brandham was that his wife or you know and and what did what did they have to do with missionaries in Africa and he knew that God was trying to tell him something but at the moment he didn't know what it was well the following night it was followed up by a dream that he saw where brother brandham was sitting in a stadium seat and he was smoking a cigarette well I troubled him because William brandham had a worldwide reputation as a man of God well you know why would he dream of such a godly man doing something as such so Unholy as smoking what in the world was God trying to tell him few weeks later he would find out that William brandham would be visit in South Africa in October they had a National Committee that was formed and it was composed of church leaders from South Africa's three largest Christian denominations the Dutch Reformed Church the English church in the Apostolic Faith Mission and they were sponsoring a two-month tour that would settle brother brandham around to 11 African cities and the tour would begin in Johannesburg on October the 3D and in 1951 and a program had been set up by the National Committee that had approved brother brandom's trip to South Africa and those days you would have to have somebody to sponsor you to come in because to gather a large group of people especially the blacks and the whites there was uh civil unrest in those days and it could cause riots and breaking out and so you know it was tightly controlled by the government but before to leave in South Africa brother brandham had received a prophecy in spport right here in sort Louisiana and God warned him in a dream or actually warned him uh in a prophecy that Satan was going to lay a trap for him in South Africa well you know he assumed the Trap would have something to do with doctors and demons and you know he asked the saints of God to pray you know somebody's going to oppose my gift to Divine healing or I'll be challenged by Devils I don't know what I'm going to face but you know the prophecy had rung out in spport that Satan was going to lay a trap for him well he arrived in South Africa you know he asked about his location and he found that the meetings were in Johannesburg and God had told him to go to Durban and and he you know he had a desire to go he he he really didn't want to just preached to the whites he was wanting to preach to the poor blacks who didn't have real opportunity and was was um you know living a suppressed lifestyle well in Johannesburg they would not allow whites and blacks to meet together in a meeting only in Durban was this able but the meetings were started there in marinan park Tabernacle it was not really an auditorium but it was a enormous op sided steel structure with a galvanized roof and it had once been the Johannesburg railway station but the Apostolic Faith Mission the largest Pentecostal denomination in South Africa had purchased this for Conference Center and and the Tabernacle covered a a you know a part of a crowd numbering around about 15,000 people well and then I I suppose outside of that could be set many more others but anyway when brother Bram found out what he where he was he says but all I know is that the Lord has spoke to me to go to Durban like I said he would find out later that he would be able to minister not just to the white population but also the Indian population that was there and the black population and it would be the only place in South Africa that he would be able to do this and and so but the National Committee of these denominational men refused to hear the word from the Lord that the angel instructed him you know to stay in Johannesburg and then rest take a rest with Sydney Jackson and and uh then after recuperating a bit from the strains of the meeting go to Durban and then God said I'll give you the country the angel had come and give him exact instructions on what to do now by the time he had met brother Sydney Jackson you know he actually would meet him as he was walking him and his wife was walking along uh uh the road and and he' stopped at the car and said jump out and he said I want to talk to this man and he he walks over and he introduces himself your name your name is Sydney Jackson I've seen you in a vision and he said I don't smoke but your dream me means that I'm listening to man instead of the Holy Spirit and besides my middle name is Maran and you know then he would then he then he would tell the the men over and again it is not the will of God for us to take this tour of 11 cities I am to minister here in Jo Johannesburg I am to go to rest with brother Jackson and recuperate from the meetings and then I'm going to to Durban and God said I'll give you the country but the National Committee was was indignant to think that this man thought that God only spoke to him God speaks to us too and God led us to take this itinerary and of course their itinerary was denominational minded it was based on political favors to certain pastors and of course thousand thousands of dollars had been spent on advert advertisings and meeting halls and rentals and and everything else and so they had quite a bit invested already and made these plans and made these promises we'll be here this night and there and people were making vacations and plans and whatever to to come to those meetings and here brother Brandon said I'm not to do it and he said God may have led you to follow this itinerary but he told me not to do it so he then he would show sign after sign of vindications telling them things of events we're going to go and we're going to we're going to stop here at a little trinket place along the road and we'll see a woman there with a scar on her face and then just as soon as we see her there will be some kind of a bird I'm not familiar with with it makes a big squawking noise that will fly over well the man he he told him you know about that and he said well I'll tell you he said there's a lot of them vendors along the way they didn't see any of them and here they get to the outskirts of where they're going and and here here he he says hey there's there's a stand right there so they turn around and go back and they go back and they said see here's that woman with that scarf face and it just as he said that here comes a big wild peacock flying over squawking and there would be sign after sign after sign he would break off branches as they were headed toward uh toward the city taking him to a city that he didn't that he was told not to go to and he break off branches and hit them on the feet and say thus sayith the Lord we're out of the will of God so we'll have nothing but trouble from on them and and so the committee however had set up their own itinerary to go from one small City to another and it turns out they would dismiss this meeting of thousands where the newspaper was writing favorable articles where the doctor's Association was supporting them and and everything else and they had the support of the whole people and they would close that meeting these men and go to another little town that wouldn't accommodate 3 or 400 people in the church because they promised Brothers so and so we're going to take him there and they had to scratch his back and and and the backs of different denomination you'll have him one night and then we'll have them another night and you'll have them another night and even brother Bosworth spoke against the instructions of the Angel of the Lord after seeing thousands upon thousands of times and he said I believe if you'll go with this these men and do what they said you know you're going to see the exceeding abundantly and they had nothing but trouble after that you see and and the deal of it is here he is in a strange country he has no money and he couldn't do nothing by himself and now they've dismissed the meetings at Johannesburg he would have to have the same Corporation of the the corporation of the same men who were now opposing the his move to to go back he was in a terrible fix and and and as he sat there he remembered the prophecy Satan's got a trap La for you and he realized here was a trap right here among his Christian Brethren the political jaws of the denominational system had snap closed around him holding him firmly in their cold unyielding teeth keeping him from doing what the Lord had told him to do and his situation seemed hopeless and so trapped he told you know he couldn't do anything and said here I am strange country no money I the these are one funded they won't cooperate God told me not to do it they're taking me anyway what am I to do and so he so told the brother said we'll have nothing but trouble we're out of the will of God we're in this permissive will so well if it's his permissive will W don't you go ask God if we can have his permissive will let me tell you something you always want to walk in God's perfect will permiss I will will cause you a lot of trouble now if you're predestinated you'll finally get back on the path of the perfect will but you didn't have to go come on I want to say this Jonah you know Jonah could have done what God said he didn't have to take a ship to Tarsus he didn't have to take a ride in the whale he didn't have to have three days and nights in a dark belly of a well and seaweed and bombit around he didn't have to suffer like that he could have just did what God Said but he was stubborn and he wanted his own way and he ran from the presence of God and what happened he got into trouble and so will you you want to stay in God's perfect will come on Amen you know so tra he he he he had to ask for God's permission of will the angel of God came and he said the men want to know can I go can you give me your permissive will he said you can go but you will pay for it now listen he was training his Prophet for a greater job and brother brandham would suffer for months and months almost dying from an amoeba and although the meetings were tremendous and miraculous he finally did get to to Durban but it didn't even come close to God's full blessings and after his return to the states the doctors tried to cure him and he came close to the point of death and the angel Lord would not speak to him he would go for months and the angel would not visit him and after months and months of suffering even the doctor said you're just so close to it get in your blood once he get in that blood stream you're dead and you're so close it's breaking out now and there's nothing we can do it's you know you you're You're gone you might better put your house in order CU you're you're a dying man and there after pleading repenting calling on God finally the angel of the Lord appeared and he told him he was forgiven and he would have no further issues from the amoeba he would actually go back to the doctor that day and get another test said do another test well we did it yesterday well get another one said the Lord visited me did another test said I don't know what to say but you don't have not one sign but during the visitation from the Lord he was startled to see his Bible rise up all for the night stand by the bed and Float across the room and sto in front of him and it would and and as it was still hanging there it was open to Acts chapter 27 where Paul was speaking to the crew of his prison ship during a ter terrible storm and and and a and there a hand appeared above the text and pointed to the verses while he read Paul stood in the midst of them and said s you should have hearkened to me and not loose from creit to have gained this harm and loss now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there should be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood be by me this night the angel of God who said who I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God has given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore serves be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as he told me and as soon as he finished reading this portion of scripture that same floating hand took and flipped the Bible right over to Joshua chapter 1 and it pointed at verse two and followed down the lines and said Moses my servant is dead now arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people to the land which I give them even to the children of Israel every place place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon have I given to you and then he seemed to stress verse five and six there shall not be any man be able to stay stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake the be strong and of good courage For unto this people Thou shalt divide an inheritance which I swear unto their fathers to give them I want you to notice here's a commission here the finger is going right down Joshua chapter 1 and as it is it's given him a commission and said you will divide for inheritance the land which I swear to their fathers to give them just be strong and courageous that thou May observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from the right hand to the left that thou May Prosper wherever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that's written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee wherever you go so you know now reading that he had to understand how that Joshua chapter one appli to him as I was with Moses as I as I have led them out of bondage as I brought him to this place so will I be with you and it was God's Declaration of his commitment to this ministry and and he and here he was showing a specific connection between his ministry and Joshua that's why I hear why I say you hear anybody else said well we're the Joshua rais up you know that ain't true God already sent the Bible down and the angel of God come on a hand going right down and saying as I was with Moses so shall I be with you it was God commissioning him to lead the church into a spiritual Promised Land the same way that Joshua had had led Israel into a natural promised land so he said be of good courage you know Thou shalt and this people shalt divide for an inheritance of the land so this would be the job or the work of the seventh angel messenger he would be sent to do what to divide the inheritance now you say brother T why would the inheritance need to be divided why would it need to be defined you know why would he I have to okay Joshua would have to know what belonged to Israel What lands they were to possess are you with me so they would he would have to know what lands so he he would tell them now Moab don't bother them I've given the children of lot an inheritance leave them alone he would say of Esau Edom he said leave Esau alone I have given him the mount sier don't try to take that here is the definition of your borders from the river Euphrates to the Sea and he would go and Define the borders to tell them what belonged to Israel what was theirs to possess now you say but how's that applicable to us well how in the world do you think then that we how in the world do you think at all that we as as a people of God would know what to possess if we're over here trying to be the 144,000 or if we're trying to be the multitude without number coming out of Great Tribulation amen we have to know what is our inheritance what is our borders I'm glad to know that our borders do not extend over into the tribulation amen that you're that the Rapture takes place before the tribulation amen how do we know that because we have had a Joshua and said that does not belong to the bride it belongs to the church who will go through the tribulation but for you there is nothing of that don't worry about it at all no matter how hot the Winds of tribulation are blowing and what you feel around you a pre-tribulation and problems that are coming you can know this amen he's got to stop because it's not our land you're going to be raptured out of here before that time you don't have to be the 144,000 you don't have to be a tribulation Saint you have been called to a promised land and God has defined your [Applause] borders well but everything in the book is mine no the great ain't yours her destruction ain't yours tribulation ain't yours we say every promise you know in the book is mine no every promise for the bride is mine there's some things I don't want there's some things that ain't for us are you with me so you see again again what lays in the land I mean what are we looking forward to Israel would go back to their land in 1948 and they would say we have come to see the Messiah and that's what I want you to know here we have returned to this land to see the Messiah to have a people ready for his name's sake it is time for this scripture to be fulfilled Brethren flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither do corruption inherit corruption but behold I show you a mystery we will not all sleep I'm telling you what's in the land we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump and that last Trump shall sound and Revelation 4 says it says come up hither amen and the dead shall rise Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruption must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality Hallelujah that lays in the land now we know now we know who it was that God would use to by the Holy Spirit remember it's the holy spirit's the leader is the holy spirit still here brother Brandon may be gone but the holy spirit is still here but it's the Holy Spirit still here using a vessel look so so he would he would tell us you know that it would represent the end time leader now so now in there we we see that the promised land is now coming in sight as as he as he said I lost my thing well it's under my Bible yeah there it is so you know you know I now he said let's stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight as theirs did that Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as original leader now then notice here in the message Paradox he would have he would have a vision there as as um there he said I was coming down to the Jordan it looked like I was standing on the map of Palestine and as I was coming to the Jordan it seemed like I could hear I could hear them sing the song I am going down to the Jordan someone was singing it and as I drew near the river I looked back and seen which way I'd come and I was 2third of the way there to the Jordan and I looked across Jordan and I said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the promised land can't you see now this is why we want to be in the promised land because it's there every promis is laid now then he would have the vision of The Binding of the of the of the Mamba serpent you know which is death and when for the serpent is to be bound and death is defeated by an end time people for we are to be alive and remain at the come of the Lord and be changed in a moment and a twinkling I the only people as a group who defi death who defeats death are you with me so he comes down the end of his sermon now in Paradox now you see what coming down to Jordan meant we're down here now let's cross over let's quit playing this is good admonition for all of you let's cross on the other side cuz it all belongs to us it is all ours the business has never failed they can't fail because they come from God I believe it with all that's within me we're not the hireling that are run back in the wilderness we'll cross Jordan to separation then he says God break to us the seals that's on the back of the book let us enter into this great place now for Joshua divided to the people their inheritance that God left for them amen so again what was it now notice what it be it would God breaking the seals that would bring us across Jordan the book The Land had to been open it had been sealed with Seven Seals amen the mysteries of it were not known many had proved at it but they didn't know it they could not know it until the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound his message are you with me now so there again our Ephesian our Joshua which means the Holy Spirit Joshua means Jehovah's savior Joshua means the Holy Spirit represented as the spiritual as it was in the natural and he's our great warrior he's our great leader as Joshua God was with Joshua so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us about and When sin comes in the camp the Holy Spirit Demands a halt what's wrong in this church something's wrong now oh can't you see how we got too many sons of Kiss now too many Sauls coming from SIM minaries and Theological schools and going out and teaching perverse things as the Bible said they would do seemingly not having the faith separating themselves from you having no fellowship with you and having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turn away I just want to say how many Souls have we seen raised up men who men men that were made King by the people are you with me amen but just just just again they come from from theological School in other words educated men educating themselves into the truth and they wind up bringing perverse things and then they separate themselves and now you got to come to us or you don't you're not a part of it and where is the power where is the courage to defeat G lith where is the power in the church amen to cast out Devils what is it been too many Souls have risen up men who were not called of God and ordained of God Amen now notice here as we go on in the message adoption he said he speaks of this how that Moses the great miracle performer brought them down down Israel down to the land brought them to to the promised land but did not Place their inheritance to them he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but Joshua divided the land to the people is that right and Christ brought the church up to a place where their possession was made to them was given to them just the Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order the Joshua today puts the church in its order given to each one not taken away given to each one gifts places position and he is the voice of God speaking to the inner man that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit now you get that that much of it where we're getting over into the book of Ephesians that that's the way he positionally plac in the church where they belong and Joshua placed them in that natural land and the Holy Spirit is placing the church positionally in the land that in the position they belong in their inheritance amen now so again as we as we look at this and I'm just going to skip down through some of this right here because we are I I want to get to get so to to some of this as we go along now going here you know you cannot you cannot break one of these types there has to be a people in this last day cross over and like I said I believe we have I believe that's what this message has done I believe it sent us to Joshua of this day the holy spirit that lead us to the land and and has to speak through somebody because he's a spirit so God would choose a messenger of Malachi 4 to do that right amen so the Holy Spirit would come among the church to get the people ready get among the people to get her ready to go up now let's go on down just a little bit but what is the old horn in the wilderness they had the Mana but in the promised land they ate the grain produced in Canaan no longer Wilderness food but the same food that Abraham had eaten if you watch this translation it doesn't say old corn it mean it says they ate the fruit of the land notice here you know the first thing that would happen would be the Passover think about it they couldn't have the Passover in the wilderness there was no grain come on only Mana there was no grain they couldn't make bread unleavened bread so it was only till when they come into the land could they come now into the Passover only in there would they circum eyes the new generation only in there in the land are you with me amen would would would be there where that they would now come and eat of the old produce the same thing the same food the same food that Isaac Drew and during a famine he planted rather than going down to Egypt but stayed in the land where God told him and during the famine reaped a h hundredfold you know that tell you stay in the promised land stay in the word you want to be blessed that's where you're going to find your blessing amen now so again again stay in that promised land now the Book of Joshua starts out Moses my servant is dead I'm going to go I'm going to go just a little longer now just so hold on your seat I hope you brought a big vessel the Book of Joshua starts out Moses my servant is dead remember it represented the law a system of religion it was dead it come its Jordan it left him right right up to the border and in the land the whole word would be opened up even the seven thunders of Revelation 10 the Thunders of the voice of God sealed up for the last age for those that entered the land they would they would be heard and and and revealed and opened the seven sealed Book of Revelation in other words open the entire word of God back to us again amen now so the Book of Joshua starts out Moses my servant is death now this has been used by every Kingdom Builder who builds their own many denomination they they take brother brandom and type him as Moses say okay the prophet's dead Moses Moes is dead so now I'm going to lead the bride into the land of promise but Moses didn't type brother brandham Jo Joshua was his type the angel said as I was with Moses as I've used down to the ages as the spirit has moved and led them from place to place to this land I will be with you same Pillar of Fire leading are you with me amen but as I was with Moses I'll be with you you are the Joshua with a commission to place the people in their inheritance now some of you might have heard of of Brother Joseph Coleman who back in the 70s he started the seven Thunder movement and uh and and then and then with the seven Thunder movement there he he um said that they were the seven virtues that Peter wrote and they and they there's a whole movement out there a whole Camp still out in the wilderness wandering around that claimed that brother Coleman was to Joshua after brother brandham that like Moses was dead now he was to lead the bride over to place her into inheritance he thought his ministry was needed to be bring Clarity and it only muddled the truth until many of more many people will not even mention the seven Thunders cuz they don't want to be identified with that and it's become a scarecrow now again I want you to remember every time one of these movements rise up it is smiting The Rock again and it's a man exalting himself see what I can do and when it does yeah people get a Revival and people jump and shout and people go on but it don't take them to the promised land from there they get bit with fiery serpents now let's go a little further in this as far as the Thunders being virtues there's not one place in the message where brother brandham says the Thunders with the Seven Virtues because how could Peter write what John was forbidden to now some of you maybe you don't know and and maybe maybe I should take a little more time with this but maybe maybe sometimes you don't know and you don't understand what the Seven Virtues are but Peter said right here he said and besides all of this did I miss it it's right there yeah Peter Peter remember Peter Peter wrote and said besides all this given all diligence add your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity so you see there are seven ads Seven Virtues to add to your faith so you know they are virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity and they propose that these are the Thunders and of course that was wrong they are not the Thunders now what are the seven Thunders and why are they important to us because we needed the voice of God which a thunder is a voice of God but it's something that was said that wasn't meant for that time and so it was sealed up until the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins the sound now so you see so this this is why brother brandom you know is asked the question he said have the seven Thunders which equal the seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but not known yet yet to Thunders yet no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about so if you want to know what the Thunders are they were revealed in the Seven Seals You See It Was Written in symbols but the mystery couldn't be made known to the last day because it would be for the people who came back to the land to open up the land to unseal the book to bring us into the fullness of the word so you see they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about now if you want to know what the Thunders are there it is and guess what it didn't take me to bring it that's right come on it didn't take some other preacher to rise up that's it didn't take somebody else a prophet in this day heard the voice of God every every day I was about to make a horrible mistake I was going to take what others had said said about the seal and i' read there about Smith and this and the other but about that time he came in the room and he changed my thinking entirely and now we know that which was written in symbol amen which was left for a later day amen and the interpretation left for another day but had to be written in the Bible cuz you can't put an addition to the word of God so it had to be written in the word so now a prophet comes in the last day with Divine interpretation and says here you are here is the ver seal and it is not Christ it is the Antichrist and it's not writing in the tribulation is starting out over here in this first age and begins his ride and it's the Antichrist how did we know that the Thunder the voice of God spoken what was once misunderstood now becomes revealed amen now then notice this the seven Thunders are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely mystery revealed truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so so you see it's really important it's not something to be glossed over it's something that that must become understood what is a thunder a thunder is When God Says something but he doesn't want it known yet or he says something and it's not for those that are nearby it's for a particular person now I want you to understand the seven Thunders was not for the first eight the second the third the fourth the fifth the sixth the seven Thunders would be re served to the people of the end time look here Jesus said now is my soul trouble he's on the way to the cross and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came out in the world father glorify thy name then there came a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said it thundered others said an angel spoke but Jesus knew what it meant it was a message to him amen saying I have both glorified and will glorified again and the others standing by only heard of Thunder that's right now for Seven Ages that's all we heard was Thunder God had said something but we didn't know what it meant because it wasn't for them do you realize what I'm talking about now because it's for you it's for you it's a word reserved for an end time people are you with me so God would hold it back you see because in it it would have to tell you you're this is the last AG well he couldn't let them know in that first age now there's going to be 2,000 years and seven Church ages so he wrote it in symbols unto the angel of Church of Ephesus and the angel of Church of Smyrna and and the Seven Stars in the hand of John oh nobody knows what all of this means or when it applies I've heard preachers preach United Pentecostal preacher one of their one of their top men was I heard him preach and said well I believe we are in the Philadelphian Church age I said you're an age behind buddy but you don't know I wouldn't know that's right but God sent a prophet and Vindicated him so I would know because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom but to them it is not given so he would write it in Parables and symbol that would not be understood until the last day when a people had come back to the land again and the land that would be open up that would open up every promise of God hallu Hallelujah so let's just look at this for a minute I'd like to carry this one more scripture down hope you can read this but it says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head and his face was as it were the sun his feet is pillars of fire and I've been through this many times with you and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right hand upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as a lion roar and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying to me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered I want you to see something here there are seven seals right there right seal up those things seven Thunder Vo vo is sealed up Seven Seals what's now and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying let me seal up those things with the seven Thunders UT and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up his hand to Heaven swear by him that lives forever who created heaven the things that therein are and the earth and the things which are therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and actually if you look at the translation it says that there would be no more delay because God was delaying the understanding of this voice of God until the last days and then he says but now wait a minute it says up here in verse 5 or be verse six try it again no verse four seal up the the things with those seven Thunders UT and write them not and then explains that he declared though it wouldn't always remain closed so he lifts up his hand to heaven and swears there's going to come a time when I'm not going to hold this back any longer when there the people on the Earth to possess the land of promise who are going to go into their inheritance and when does what is going to happen seal it up now watch and there's coming a Time there'll be no more delay but in the days of the voice you know I think brother Aaron is a pretty good fellow but I think brother Joe does pretty good with his money but I think David but is a he works does a has an important job at the hospital but wonder what's coming after you never start a complete thought with butt but I love brother Joe but you don't start a complete thought with but people pull this one scripture right out and they start with but and they believe this part here but but what but what seven Thunders have been sealed up that's and I'm telling you you know don't write it but but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he starts sounding his message this mystery this mystery will no longer be a secret I'm going to make it known to an end time people so they will hear the voice of God for the last days to know they are in the land and this is their Divine promise and because of that every promise in the book is now opened up to you healing is yours salvation is yours the Holy Ghost is yours the power of God is yours predestination is yours security of Believers is yours the correct baptism is yours it's all yours it's all yours it's all yours the land LS a h go and possess it Hallelujah go possess it take your
