[7:48] amen we have several several requests
[7:51] we want to make mention before the lord
[7:53] i want to continue to remember to pray
[7:55] for brother ron
[7:56] during this time as the lord just does a
[7:58] healing work in his body
[8:00] from the cancer also sister erica parker
[8:04] and the different ones that are sick and
[8:06] body around the
[8:07] world with like the covet virus just
[8:10] pray that the lord would
[8:11] heal and protect those and i also have a
[8:16] prayer request that was just sent in
[8:17] through the email from
[8:19] sister carolyn westerfield said please
[8:21] remember
[8:22] sister betty nall from indiana she needs
[8:24] a healing miracle for the lord
[8:26] of the lord in her body we know how god
[8:29] spared sister karen's life and we're
[8:31] asking god to come on the scene for her
[8:33] too
[8:34] please also remember her family in
[8:36] prayer amen so a number of
[8:39] number of needs tonight if you have a
[8:40] need you want to just lift to the lord
[8:42] as brother joe adams opens the service
[8:44] for us in prayer
[8:45] amen let's just take these together to
[8:47] him
[8:51] amen you're glad to be in the house of
[8:52] the lord this evening you believe we
[8:55] serve a living god
[8:57] amen just you know we see all the chaos
[8:59] that's going on around us but yet
[9:02] this year we've probably seen the most
[9:03] miracles that we have
[9:05] have witnessed in one church maybe even
[9:07] in our
[9:08] our church congregation here and those
[9:10] that we affiliate with
[9:11] we've seen god move time and time and
[9:14] time again letting us know that he's not
[9:16] forsaking his children
[9:18] and i believe we should continually be
[9:19] under expectation and i
[9:21] trust tonight when you lift your hands
[9:23] that you got a need that you
[9:24] have an expectation that will meet that
[9:26] need there's a god here
[9:29] he's a living god and he's ready tonight
[9:31] to do exceeding abundantly above
[9:33] all that we can even ask or think
[9:35] tonight and i would just
[9:36] ask i have an unspoken request for
[9:38] sister rachel and
[9:40] for our family just pray that you would
[9:41] bind us and that god knows the need and
[9:43] the situation there
[9:44] and i believe we serve a mighty god and
[9:47] i also just want to
[9:48] interject real quick before we go to
[9:50] prayer you know many times we can
[9:52] believe god for the supernatural of
[9:53] healing and deliverance and brain bleeds
[9:55] and cancer and
[9:57] you know different things of that nature
[9:58] but how many of you have a lost loved
[9:59] one out there
[10:01] and it looks like an impossible case
[10:04] the same god that can heal brain bleeds
[10:06] and deliver cancer is the same god that
[10:07] can bring the prodigal back
[10:09] and i believe sometimes we put more on
[10:11] the impossible and than that
[10:13] than we do the supernatural of healing
[10:14] but yet he's the same god
[10:17] so whatever your need is tonight god
[10:19] does the impossible
[10:20] you got wayward children he does the
[10:22] impossible
[10:24] and i want you to know tonight you found
[10:25] favor with god
[10:27] and god's here to move so let's elevate
[10:29] our faith and trust god
[10:30] to do exactly what he said he will do
[10:33] you ask
[10:34] anything in my name and i'll bring it to
[10:36] pass so father we bow before your throne
[10:39] tonight

[10:52] good thing from us

[31:50] luke 1 26 it says in the sixth month the
[31:54] angel gabriel was sent from god unto a
[31:56] city of galilee
[31:57] named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a
[32:00] man whose name was joseph
[32:02] of the house of david and the virgin's
[32:04] name was mary
[32:05] and the angel came in unto her and said
[32:08] hell thou art
[32:09] highly favored the lord is with thee
[32:12] blessed art thou among women and when
[32:15] she saw him she was troubled at his
[32:17] saying and cast in her mind
[32:19] what manner of salutation this should be
[32:22] and the angel said unto her
[32:24] fear not mary for thou has found favor
[32:27] with god and behold thou shalt conceive
[32:30] in thy womb and bring forth a son
[32:32] and shalt call his name jesus
[32:36] he shall be great and shall be called
[32:37] the son of the highest
[32:39] and the lord god shall give unto him the
[32:41] throne of his father david
[32:43] and he shall reign over the house of
[32:44] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[32:47] shall be no end
[32:49] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[32:51] this thing be
[32:52] seeing i know not a man and the angel
[32:55] answered and said unto her the holy
[32:56] ghost shall come upon thee
[32:58] and the power of the highest shall
[33:00] overshadow thee
[33:01] therefore also that holy thing which
[33:03] shall be born of thee shall be called
[33:05] the son of god and behold thy cousin
[33:07] elizabeth
[33:08] she hath also conceived his son in her
[33:10] old age and this is the sixth month with
[33:12] her
[33:13] who was called barren for with god
[33:17] nothing shall be impossible and mary
[33:20] said behold the handmaid of the lord
[33:23] be it unto me according to thy word
[33:27] and the angel departed from her
[33:30] may god add his blessings now to the
[33:32] reading of the word i
[33:34] you can have your seats
[33:40] i'll tell you as we go along tonight
[33:42] it's not going to be
[33:45] any mystery what i'm trying to get
[33:47] across to you it's not going to be any
[33:48] mystery of what we're speaking about
[33:51] we're going to hammer this point and
[33:52] we're going to stay on this point as
[33:54] long as the lord would lead
[33:55] and the title tonight what i'm going to
[33:57] preach to you about is thou
[33:58] has found favor with god
[34:02] thou has found favor with god what i
[34:05] want you to do tonight right now before
[34:07] we even start is
[34:08] is take that and apply it to yourself i
[34:11] want you to take that favor and accept
[34:12] it for yourself
[34:14] right now for whatever situation you're
[34:15] in whatever you're facing
[34:17] we live in troubled times and sometimes
[34:20] we don't know which way to turn but in
[34:21] the midst of all that i want to announce
[34:23] to you
[34:24] that thou has found favor with god
[34:27] i don't think that there's anything else
[34:28] we need to know tonight there's anything
[34:30] else we need to hear
[34:31] if we can actually get that revelation
[34:33] to drop down into our heart
[34:35] if we could actually get that that true
[34:37] revelation right now to completely
[34:39] compass us about we could leave here so
[34:42] victorious over every situation over
[34:44] every sickness
[34:45] we could walk out as conquerors tonight
[34:47] knowing that i have favor
[34:49] with god almighty it's a wonderful thing
[34:52] to think about and that's what we're
[34:53] going to preach to you about tonight
[34:56] what an awesome account we find there in
[34:58] the scripture that we just read and many
[35:00] times
[35:00] brother brown would dramatize uh what
[35:03] went on the day before and the day of
[35:05] as mary met that angel you find him do
[35:08] it several times he does it in mary's
[35:10] belief
[35:12] and that's a lot of the message that i
[35:14] listened to and studied a lot as i was
[35:16] preparing for this sermon and brother
[35:18] branham would dramatize the account over
[35:19] and over and it just seems to come to
[35:21] life when brother branham takes
[35:22] something and begins to dramatize it
[35:24] i love to listen to him take an account
[35:26] or take a story and begin to put flesh
[35:28] on it and begin to talk about things and
[35:30] and it's not just a story when he tells
[35:32] it because we know the office that he
[35:34] held and
[35:35] and who he was i can hear that story and
[35:37] not think well that was a nice story i
[35:39] can hear that and go
[35:40] that's incredible that's how it was i
[35:42] know when he tells those things i know
[35:44] that that he has he has been able to
[35:46] see and look and and witness what
[35:48] actually went on so
[35:49] so they're not just stories we can take
[35:51] those things and actually apply
[35:53] the things that he says as he dramatizes
[35:55] those events
[35:56] and he talks about how joseph and mary
[35:59] had gone to service that day
[36:00] and how it had been a wonderful service
[36:02] and he said that the the rabbi had
[36:04] taught
[36:05] uh talked all about god bringing the
[36:07] children of israel
[36:08] out of egypt and how he had brought them
[36:10] through the red sea and he talked about
[36:12] how god took them
[36:14] out of the hand of the enemy with
[36:15] miracles and with power and
[36:17] and how by great signs and wonders for
[36:19] 40 years he had fed them in the
[36:22] wilderness
[36:23] he talked about how they came out of the
[36:24] wilderness on a 40-year journey with not
[36:26] a single
[36:27] feeble person among them how even their
[36:30] clothes didn't wear down
[36:31] and he began to proclaim what a great
[36:33] and mighty god that we had what a great
[36:35] god
[36:36] that was leading the children of israel
[36:38] and he goes on and brother branham
[36:40] says it was a wonderful message he said
[36:43] it was a
[36:44] wonderful service all these wonderful
[36:45] truths that the rabbi brought out
[36:47] but brother branham says at the end of
[36:49] it the rabbi
[36:51] ruined the whole thing he says he ruined
[36:55] the whole thing by saying god
[36:57] just doesn't operate like that anymore
[37:00] he said it's not necessary anymore
[37:02] the people have settled in the homeland
[37:05] and they don't need
[37:06] a god of miracles anymore
[37:09] i wonder how many messages today i
[37:12] wonder how many good messages how many
[37:14] wonderful messages today
[37:16] are ruined by that exact same thought
[37:18] process that comes forth over the pulpit
[37:21] wasn't god good wasn't god amazing in
[37:24] the way that he used to heal
[37:25] didn't god do amazing things in the past
[37:28] but god just doesn't do those things
[37:30] anymore
[37:31] he did that to get people's attention he
[37:33] did that so people would recognize there
[37:35] was a prophet
[37:36] but now that the people have been
[37:37] settled in the homeland
[37:39] we don't need that god of miracles
[37:41] anymore
[37:42] now that we've settled down in this
[37:44] place and everything's as it was this is
[37:46] where god was taking us this is what he
[37:48] was trying to accomplish i don't believe
[37:49] that
[37:50] for a minute i believe that god's
[37:52] purpose is yet fulfilled because his
[37:54] purpose was to get a people that could
[37:56] overcome in this land
[37:58] his purpose is to get somebody that's
[37:59] going to take a rapture
[38:01] and until that takes place we need a god
[38:03] of miracles we need a god that's on the
[38:05] scene for every situation we're going to
[38:07] face today
[38:08] and tomorrow and i'm glad i can announce
[38:10] you tonight he's still here he's still
[38:12] moving
[38:13] he is the same yesterday today and
[38:15] forever he is still
[38:16] the god of miracles i think too many
[38:19] times testimonies are told in a way to
[38:22] where they're just some ancient relic
[38:23] some ancient story we're giving this
[38:25] testimony to lift something up that used
[38:27] to happen
[38:28] instead of testimonies being told for
[38:30] the purpose that they were meant
[38:32] to be that is to elevate your faith for
[38:34] the miracles we need today
[38:36] testimonies are to tell you what god can
[38:38] do right now
[38:39] it's not to tell you what he used to do
[38:41] i'm telling you a testimony because
[38:43] today you need him today i need him and
[38:45] if he did it yesterday
[38:47] he'll do it tonight if he did it
[38:49] yesterday he'll do it tomorrow
[38:51] testimonies are to prepare you for the
[38:52] miracles of today
[38:54] not to point to a time pass
[39:02] it's something that we must realize
[39:04] tonight
[39:06] that god wants to move in your situation
[39:10] he wants to move right now in your
[39:13] situation
[39:14] god wants to display his power on your
[39:17] behalf
[39:18] god is willing and god is able to move
[39:21] for whatever it is you're looking
[39:23] into tonight he's willing and he is able
[39:26] to move in that situation
[39:28] but he's looking for somebody who will
[39:31] take him
[39:32] at his word he's looking for somebody
[39:35] that will take him at his word and will
[39:37] believe
[39:38] no matter what the circumstances are
[39:42] listen he's not asking you that has a
[39:44] church to have a church that believes
[39:47] he's not worried necessarily about what
[39:49] the church he's wanting somebody that if
[39:50] the church don't believe it you believe
[39:52] it
[39:52] if the pastor don't believe it you
[39:54] believe it if your family don't believe
[39:56] it you
[39:57] believe it he's looking for somebody
[39:59] that doesn't care what everybody else
[40:01] believes
[40:01] but they take the word of god for
[40:03] themselves for
[40:05] their situation and they say lord i know
[40:08] you love me
[40:09] i know you died i know you took stripes
[40:11] i know you're the same today you can
[40:13] heal me right now you have healed me
[40:15] you can save my children you can save my
[40:18] spouse
[40:18] i believe it right now because you're
[40:20] still the god of miracles
[40:23] and he's looking for people like that
[40:27] you have to take god's word yourself
[40:31] for your situation the rabbi that day
[40:35] believed
[40:36] that the miraculous was a thing of the
[40:37] past
[40:39] brother brown said somehow that didn't
[40:41] satisfy the thirst and hunger
[40:44] of joseph and mary evening like
[40:47] tabernacle i pray that that type of
[40:49] preaching
[40:50] or that type of teaching will never
[40:53] satisfy the hunger that's in your soul
[40:55] may this church never become a place
[40:57] that would stand for or accept that type
[40:59] of thing that would take the power of
[41:01] god
[41:01] and put it in the past that would take
[41:03] the power of god make it a thing of
[41:05] yesterday a relic of the past
[41:07] listen a church or a person that makes
[41:10] god only a god of yesterday
[41:12] and only a god of the past eventually
[41:14] what's going to happen is they're going
[41:15] to dry up
[41:16] right where they're at there will be no
[41:18] progress there will be no altar calls
[41:20] there will be no soul saves you won't
[41:21] see any baptism taking place
[41:23] they may have great theology they may
[41:25] have great teaching they may be able to
[41:27] quote circles all around you and make
[41:29] your head spin but at the end of the day
[41:30] there ain't enough power there to heal a
[41:31] toothache
[41:32] there's not enough power there to get
[41:34] souls to the altar there's not enough
[41:35] power there to save people
[41:37] filled people with the holy ghost preach
[41:38] the deliverance of the bound
[41:40] because they put god in the past but i
[41:43] need god tonight
[41:45] i need god right now i need the god that
[41:47] opened the red sea to open up the seas
[41:49] in my life
[41:50] i need the god that fed the children of
[41:52] israel man in the wilderness i need him
[41:53] to feed my soul
[41:55] right now god i'm hungry and i know you
[41:57] can feed my soul right now
[41:59] there's a c in front of me and i know
[42:00] you can open it right now
[42:02] you did it once and i'm looking to you
[42:04] tonight god say open the sea for me
[42:07] open the sea for my need lord jesus
[42:13] i still believe in hebrews 13 8 i
[42:16] believe in john 14 12
[42:19] we can't become satisfied with religion
[42:23] too many people are settling down on
[42:25] religion the message has become
[42:28] a religion
[42:32] instead of a personal relationship with
[42:34] the living god
[42:37] instead of he came and called my name
[42:39] and he's my friend and we fellowship and
[42:41] we talk
[42:42] he's there for me and he loves me and i
[42:45] love him and i'm gonna serve him all the
[42:46] days of my life it's become
[42:48] when we go to church on sundays and
[42:51] sometimes wednesdays
[42:55] that's what it's become that is
[42:58] a nominal life at best
[43:02] as a matter of fact there's a lot of
[43:06] good
[43:06] baptist and methodist people that
[43:08] outshine a lot of message people
[43:10] in their religion you
[43:14] can't compare to them they will outwork
[43:16] you
[43:17] they will out church attend you i don't
[43:20] think that's proper to say it that way
[43:21] but
[43:22] we said it church attend you
[43:27] it works you
[43:31] can't let it become about religion it's
[43:33] about you
[43:34] and god and a god that called your name
[43:37] a god that came to save your soul a god
[43:40] that came to heal your sick
[43:42] and save your children and save your
[43:44] husband and savior
[43:45] your wives he came to do all that for
[43:47] you it's not just about religion
[43:48] it's about a love affair with the lord
[43:50] jesus christ
[43:56] we can never let religion satisfy our
[43:58] souls
[43:59] brother branham says mary said you know
[44:01] since i heard the rabbi say that
[44:04] this great god that brought us here and
[44:06] made us what we are
[44:07] that he doesn't have to do things for us
[44:09] now like he did then
[44:11] i've been thinking for a long time that
[44:13] if this god was as great in the days of
[44:15] our fathers
[44:16] as he was in the days of our
[44:18] grandfathers then why isn't he just the
[44:21] same
[44:22] great god today brother brown says
[44:25] that's only good thinking that's
[44:28] only good thinking church it's only good
[44:32] thinking if it says he's the same
[44:33] yesterday today and forever than what we
[44:35] saw
[44:36] in the ministry in the healing revivals
[44:38] of the 1950s and 60s
[44:39] we can still see today if he's the same
[44:42] as he was then
[44:43] there's just as many needs as there was
[44:45] then i guarantee there's more needs than
[44:47] there was then
[44:47] and there's not any less power the power
[44:50] not only that i wouldn't say the power's
[44:52] the same i would say the power is
[44:53] increased
[44:54] as he has poured out more and more of
[44:55] himself into this world yes we see the
[44:58] tree of knowledge of good and evil it's
[44:59] reached his height that doesn't worry me
[45:01] none
[45:01] because there's another tree that's
[45:02] reached its height and it has unleashed
[45:04] its power
[45:05] and it's unreleased all it has for you
[45:07] in this day we have more than enough
[45:08] we have more than enough how dare us
[45:10] look at it and say you don't do that
[45:12] number what we're trying to say
[45:13] really is god can't do that anymore
[45:19] and we say he don't do those things to
[45:21] make excuses for why we don't see them
[45:23] in our home
[45:24] or make or why we don't see them in our
[45:26] church instead of just getting down
[45:28] repenting saying god i was wrong i need
[45:30] you to move i need you to move in our
[45:32] church i need you to move in our home
[45:34] just repent lay your pride down or admit
[45:36] you were wrong and let god move in your
[45:38] life
[45:39] let god move in your family we got
[45:41] people that don't think god moves that
[45:43] way anymore they got lost children lost
[45:45] loved ones
[45:45] i refuse to believe that i'm not going
[45:47] to believe something that would damn my
[45:49] children
[45:50] i'm going to say god go get them you can
[45:52] still do it i know you can i believe you
[45:54] will i'm holding on for them
[45:56] that's how i choose to believe
[46:02] mary wasn't satisfied mary wanted
[46:05] something more
[46:07] and she was not going to be disappointed
[46:11] the prophet would say that mary and
[46:13] joseph read from the scroll of isaiah
[46:15] that afternoon
[46:17] when they read about the coming savior
[46:20] unto us a child is born what a wonderful
[46:23] scripture
[46:24] what a wonderful scripture unto us
[46:28] us a child is born
[46:32] this is what she was dwelling on the
[46:33] next morning as she walked down that
[46:35] little path
[46:38] we find her dwelling on the word of god
[46:44] there's nothing better for you and i to
[46:46] dwell on
[46:47] there's nothing better for you and i to
[46:49] feed on there's nothing better for you
[46:51] now to put our time into
[46:53] i know sometimes we have a lot on our
[46:54] mind i know sometimes
[46:57] work may consume us we may be
[46:59] overwhelmed on the job and we come home
[47:01] with it that's what's on our mind work
[47:02] those are
[47:03] those are all things of life i know
[47:05] sometimes school may consume you
[47:07] you're caught up in school and i got to
[47:08] do this and i got to do that those are
[47:10] things you have to do i get that
[47:12] sometimes entertainment may consume your
[47:14] mind
[47:15] sometimes maybe it may be a video games
[47:19] for young people or social media and
[47:20] that ain't just for young people social
[47:22] media
[47:22] for grownups whatever stuff consumes our
[47:25] mind
[47:26] and sometimes it's things of life that
[47:27] that are understandable and we we have
[47:29] to take care of work we have to take
[47:30] care of school but then sometimes we
[47:31] fill our mind with things
[47:32] that really we have no excuse for at the
[47:35] end of the day we made a choice to fill
[47:37] our mind
[47:38] with that we made a choice to pick that
[47:40] up and consume that all day instead of
[47:41] consuming something that would benefit
[47:43] and edify us
[47:44] so many times it's a choice that we make
[47:46] and not necessarily something that we
[47:47] have to do
[47:48] but the point being you can
[47:52] never dwell on and consume enough or too
[47:54] much of the word of god
[47:57] and that's what we find mary dwelling on
[47:59] and thinking of as she walks down the
[48:00] street
[48:01] and what i want us to think about
[48:03] tonight is it's when we get our mind on
[48:06] him
[48:07] it's when we begin to think about him
[48:10] and it's when our conversation begins to
[48:12] center around him
[48:13] that's when you can have your visitation
[48:17] that's when god can move on the scene
[48:18] for you that's when an angel can come to
[48:20] your home
[48:21] that's when the atmosphere can get right
[48:23] for your need and for your miracle
[48:26] brother branham says he said hail mary
[48:30] you're highly favored before god oh i
[48:32] like that
[48:33] that little woman in the meanest city
[48:35] there was in the world at that time
[48:37] known the meatest meanest city anywhere
[48:39] in palestine
[48:41] and in there she had lived such a life
[48:42] until god chose her for a certain work
[48:44] that he was going to do
[48:46] there she looked into his face and it
[48:48] startled startled her
[48:50] you know it's usually as we were
[48:52] thinking on those things
[48:53] the bible said if there be any praise if
[48:56] there be any virtue
[48:57] think on these things i think the reason
[49:00] we don't see no more of it than we do is
[49:02] we got our minds on too many other
[49:04] things
[49:05] i think the angels would still appear to
[49:08] us
[49:08] if we only kept our minds upon them
[49:12] but we're thinking about something else
[49:14] that's where we're gonna go
[49:16] a certain program we gotta get back to
[49:18] look at or certain shopping that we got
[49:20] to do
[49:21] but our scripture tells us seek ye first
[49:23] the kingdom of god
[49:25] and his righteousness and all these
[49:27] other things will be added
[49:28] unto you and there when we see that
[49:31] he's talking about with mary when we see
[49:33] that in order we see a person who's
[49:35] seeking first the kingdom of god we see
[49:37] a person whose mind is on the lord
[49:39] we see that he said to her thou
[49:42] art highly favored before god
[49:47] i think back to that special day we had
[49:50] there at the lake house
[49:51] at brother tim's lake house there on
[49:54] lake clabor when brother ron came for a
[49:56] visit
[49:57] and we had a wonderful time there
[49:59] visiting and for several days and just
[50:01] talking about different things
[50:03] talking just the way friends talk you
[50:05] know
[50:07] then on that tuesday i believe it was it
[50:11] was a tuesday
[50:12] as the conversation took its course it
[50:15] began to turn
[50:16] towards the things of god we talked
[50:19] about different meetings
[50:21] that different ones had been in our
[50:23] experiences in those meetings we talked
[50:25] about the mighty things that we had seen
[50:27] god do
[50:29] and we talked about how wonderful he is
[50:31] and we talked about how faithful he
[50:32] is and as we begin to talk about these
[50:35] things you could feel him draw near in
[50:37] the room
[50:39] you could feel the atmosphere get right
[50:42] you could tell the waters were troubled
[50:45] you could just tell in that moment that
[50:47] it was the right time it was the right
[50:49] moment
[50:50] and in that moment brother tim
[50:51] recognizing it called everybody together
[50:53] and said we're going
[50:54] to prayer and we had a time of prayer
[50:56] with brother ron that was absolutely
[50:57] supernatural
[50:58] it was an amazing atmosphere an amazing
[51:01] experience really
[51:02] words fail me to describe the power of
[51:04] it
[51:05] brother ron said it felt like the walls
[51:07] of the house were breathing
[51:09] and in that moment because we got our
[51:11] mind on the things of god and because we
[51:13] talked about those things and we
[51:15] created an atmosphere that allowed him
[51:17] to draw near in the waters to be
[51:18] troubled
[51:19] brother ron received the touch and his
[51:21] testimony is he hasn't been the same
[51:22] from that day
[51:24] he's been re-energized he's he's
[51:25] preaching he's working he's doing
[51:28] everything he says i'm a new man
[51:30] and in that moment there as he's
[51:31] receiving that touch from god
[51:33] um andrew pruitt and luke pruitt and
[51:36] brother adam who had come there with
[51:38] brother ron
[51:38] all three of them in that moment when
[51:40] the waters are troubled had an
[51:42] experience with the god and received the
[51:43] baptism of the holy ghost
[51:45] and i'll never forget after andrew was
[51:47] prayed for and luke was prayed for
[51:49] he looks up at brother ron looks at adam
[51:51] and he says adam we drove 17
[51:53] hours for a miracle while you're
[51:55] standing there you might as well get in
[51:57] while the water's troubled
[51:59] and i'm telling you tonight that when
[52:00] the angel draws near because you're
[52:02] talking about him and
[52:03] you're thinking about him and you're
[52:04] thinking about how good he is don't just
[52:06] stand there and let that moment pass you
[52:08] by
[52:08] don't stand there when the angel's
[52:10] moving through the build and when he's
[52:11] here and you have an opportunity
[52:13] recognize how precious the opportunity
[52:14] is recognize there's people that will go
[52:16] their whole life and not
[52:18] experience that opportunity you can have
[52:20] on a wednesday night or on a sunday
[52:22] here in this church or even in your home
[52:23] but right now in this service as he
[52:25] begins to move
[52:26] and the waters are troubled don't waste
[52:27] the opportunity get in the water
[52:29] allow him to do the work you need him to
[52:31] do how dares have
[52:33] so much disrespect that when the angel
[52:35] moves and the spirit moves through the
[52:36] building we can sit there with our arms
[52:38] crossed
[52:38] and just stare and look around like
[52:40] nothing's going on
[52:42] well i don't feel nothing well you ought
[52:43] to have enough about you to recognize
[52:45] when the presence of god is in the
[52:46] building
[52:47] if you can't recognize his presence in a
[52:50] service that says more about you than it
[52:51] does him
[52:53] if you can't recognize when people are
[52:54] being blessed and poured out it may not
[52:56] be for you that moment but go to prayer
[52:58] for those people
[52:59] begin to worship in god recognizing he's
[53:01] in your presence
[53:02] so that things can happen for other
[53:04] people
[53:06] i've said it before it's a shame that we
[53:08] can be so cold that we can sit there and
[53:10] backslidden people can come sit next to
[53:12] us and go to sleep
[53:14] what kind of atmosphere did you create
[53:16] that they can come sit there and snooze
[53:17] they ought to be terrified to sit next
[53:19] to you they ought to be so uncomfortable
[53:22] how can they drag their devils in and
[53:24] sit next to you and be comfortable
[53:26] they sit there dozing off they ought to
[53:27] be a shout out hallelujah and they go
[53:29] what was that
[53:30] what's going on let your praise and your
[53:33] worship
[53:34] wake up the sleeping virgins wake up the
[53:36] backsliders create an atmosphere
[53:38] where things can take place i'm not
[53:42] feeling anything that's okay it may be
[53:43] somebody else's night but do your part
[53:45] for that person
[53:57] i think it's wonderful how brother
[53:58] branham describes mary's thoughts
[54:01] and her entire life being centered
[54:04] around the coming messiah
[54:07] she's thinking about the coming messiah
[54:09] she's she's talking about she's seeking
[54:11] for a living god and that's what her
[54:12] mind is on
[54:14] and i find this so pertinent to us
[54:17] because of the trouble in the land at
[54:20] the time of mary's visitation
[54:23] with something that somewhat parallels
[54:25] the troubled times that we're living in
[54:28] we oftentimes don't think back
[54:31] in a historical context and i'm gonna do
[54:33] my best not to give you a history lesson
[54:37] but the angel's visit to mary occurred
[54:39] during a truthful
[54:40] a truly dreadful time in a land
[54:44] that was already a troubled land it was
[54:47] a time of religious and political
[54:48] upheaval throughout the land
[54:51] there were very violent rebellions that
[54:53] were taking place
[54:55] there were evil bloodthirsty leaders
[54:57] such as herod that were ruling over the
[54:59] land
[55:00] there was rome influencing everything
[55:04] and the jews themselves were separated
[55:06] into different religious and political
[55:08] factions
[55:09] that couldn't agree on anything even
[55:10] amongst themselves
[55:14] that's a that's a bleak picture yeah but
[55:17] that was the atmosphere and the
[55:19] condition of the world when jesus showed
[55:21] up
[55:23] that was the time that jesus came on the
[55:26] scene
[55:26] was in a time like that
[55:30] listen don't be discouraged by all the
[55:31] things you're seeing around you don't be
[55:34] discouraged by what you're seeing don't
[55:35] let those things get you down
[55:37] there have been end times before this
[55:39] isn't the first end time there have been
[55:41] end times before and every single time
[55:44] that there's an end time
[55:45] we see evil and wickedness and sin we
[55:47] see instability in the world
[55:49] and we see a climate that is not
[55:52] god friendly we see a climate in every
[55:55] end time that rejects god and rejects
[55:57] his people and pushes his people out
[55:59] there was an end time in noah's day
[56:02] genesis 6 5 says and god saw that the
[56:05] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[56:07] and that every imagination of the
[56:08] thought of his heart was only evil
[56:11] continually
[56:12] it was an evil time it was an end time
[56:14] there was an end time for
[56:16] sodom genesis 13 13 says but the men of
[56:19] sodom were wicked
[56:20] and sinners before the lord exceedingly
[56:24] and we're told in luke 17 that we can
[56:26] expect
[56:27] these same things in our day
[56:30] luke 17 26 as it was in the days of noah
[56:33] so shall it be in the days of the son of
[56:35] man
[56:36] luke 17 28 likewise also as it was in
[56:39] the days of lot
[56:41] luke 17 30 even though shall it be in
[56:44] the day
[56:45] when the son of man is revealed
[56:48] listen we have longed for and preached
[56:50] about and looked for
[56:52] the end time here we are
[56:56] if it doesn't really even take a
[56:58] spiritual person to look around and
[56:59] realize
[57:00] things aren't right
[57:05] there was a time for years i i have a
[57:07] lot of good what i would call nominal
[57:09] christian friends good people
[57:10] and we discussed the end time and it
[57:12] wasn't something they ever thought about
[57:15] they would say things like well we know
[57:16] he's going to come back one day but i
[57:18] don't think it'd be in my lifetime just
[57:19] it was just this one day one day one day
[57:21] but in the last few years you begin to
[57:22] hear them say things like man it's got
[57:24] to be close
[57:26] it's got to be close listen if they're
[57:29] recognizing it what about a people that
[57:30] received a message that told you many
[57:32] years ago that it was close
[57:34] of people that taught that were told
[57:35] exactly what to look for a people that
[57:38] knew the end time was upon us
[57:39] and yet some of us are walking around
[57:41] like the boy whistling past the
[57:42] graveyard
[57:43] acting like nothing's going on we are on
[57:45] the culmination of the wrapping up
[57:47] of all things we are standing on the
[57:50] brink of eternity we are standing where
[57:52] time
[57:53] is blending to eternity you are at the
[57:55] moment of receiving a body change
[57:58] the greatest miracle that has ever taken
[58:00] place on the face of the earth as the
[58:02] power of god's gonna sweep over a people
[58:04] and catch them up in a moment in a
[58:06] twinkling of an eye how can we act like
[58:08] nothing's happening
[58:09] it's all happening everything we've ever
[58:11] lived for
[58:12] everything we've heard preached about
[58:14] everything we've ever sung about
[58:16] it's happening right now
[58:18] [Music]
[58:19] it's happening right now you are in the
[58:22] middle of it
[58:29] we've prayed and long for the end time
[58:31] and what you are experiencing
[58:33] are end time conditions
[58:40] this was the ending of the jewish
[58:42] dispensation
[58:45] right in the middle of a wicked city
[58:48] right in the midst of their world
[58:49] completely falling apart
[58:52] there had been rebellions there had been
[58:55] riots
[58:56] sound familiar as a matter of fact
[59:00] many of the jews most of the jews
[59:02] believe that
[59:04] when the messiah came he was going to
[59:05] take part in these riots and these
[59:07] rebellions
[59:08] that shows you how tumultuous the time
[59:11] was
[59:12] they thought he was going to be a leader
[59:13] that was going to come in on a horse and
[59:15] i don't know maybe their rights are
[59:17] different from our rights he's gonna get
[59:18] spray paint and go
[59:20] put graffiti on everything and run i
[59:22] don't know what they expected
[59:24] they didn't get what they expected
[59:25] though and that's why they missed it
[59:27] there's a lot of people today that had
[59:29] so many preconceived notions of what was
[59:30] going to happen
[59:31] and they're missing it because it's not
[59:33] lining up with their thinking
[59:34] cast away your thinking we had a prophet
[59:36] coming this day and clear up everything
[59:37] so you didn't have to worry about your
[59:39] thinking
[59:40] he told us what to expect he told us
[59:41] what to look for
[59:43] he prepared us and here we are i feel
[59:45] like we're a well-prepared people
[59:52] they believed he would come and rid them
[59:55] of roman government
[59:57] overthrow the romans it was a world of
[1:00:00] constant
[1:00:01] unrest and in the middle of all that
[1:00:04] in the middle of constant unrest and
[1:00:07] riots and upheavals and this and that
[1:00:09] going on we find mary's mind is on
[1:00:12] the lord in the middle of all that her
[1:00:15] desire is i want a living god
[1:00:17] i want more than just a tradition i want
[1:00:20] more of that god i believe you're the
[1:00:21] same yesterday today and forever i don't
[1:00:23] think that you're just a god of the past
[1:00:24] i believe you can that's what her
[1:00:25] mindset was on
[1:00:26] not politics not factions not this
[1:00:30] not that but god i want more of you
[1:00:33] i want to see you real in my life i
[1:00:35] believe you've got
[1:00:36] everything in control
[1:00:40] and that has to be us tonight church god
[1:00:42] the world is falling apart around us
[1:00:45] but you're so good god i love you so
[1:00:47] much i want more of you tonight lord
[1:00:49] reveal yourself to me lord
[1:00:50] lord if i failed you in any way let me
[1:00:52] lay that aside let me lay my thoughts
[1:00:53] aside lord i want to draw closer to you
[1:00:55] i want i want to give you all that i am
[1:00:57] lord i know the words of evil i'm not
[1:00:58] worried about right now lord i'm
[1:00:59] thinking about you
[1:01:00] lord i'm walking towards you i'm trying
[1:01:02] to draw closer to you
[1:01:03] but this is going on impossible i'm not
[1:01:05] worried about that right now there's a
[1:01:06] riot
[1:01:06] i'm not worried about that god i need
[1:01:08] more of you my mind's on you
[1:01:10] i'm focused on you and that's how she
[1:01:12] was and she's walking down this path
[1:01:14] lord you're wonderful i want to
[1:01:15] experience more of you lord and all of a
[1:01:17] sudden
[1:01:19] flicker flicker oh god let there be a
[1:01:23] flicker of light in here tonight
[1:01:25] let somebody's eyes come open to what's
[1:01:27] going on and what's happening all around
[1:01:29] us
[1:01:29] flicker and then a pillar of fire
[1:01:34] and then an angel steps out of that
[1:01:35] pillar of fire
[1:01:37] with a message an angel steps out of
[1:01:40] that pillar of fire and he says
[1:01:43] hell thou art
[1:01:46] highly favored oh my
[1:01:49] the unrest didn't matter then brother
[1:01:51] joe the politics didn't matter at that
[1:01:54] moment brother joe the factions didn't
[1:01:56] matter at that moment
[1:01:57] none of those things met the rabbi's
[1:01:58] opinion of the god not doing the
[1:02:00] miraculous at this moment
[1:02:02] i promise you it didn't matter anymore
[1:02:04] she stood face to face with gabriel
[1:02:07] those things didn't matter anymore they
[1:02:09] had fallen away
[1:02:12] what did we receive in this day church
[1:02:14] what did we receive in this day a pillar
[1:02:16] of fire
[1:02:17] vindicating a message a message that
[1:02:20] told you
[1:02:20] you are highly favored a message that
[1:02:23] came and told you
[1:02:24] i chose you but i'm no good he didn't
[1:02:26] ask you if you were good he said i have
[1:02:28] chosen
[1:02:29] you you are highly favored church hear
[1:02:31] that tonight there's a messenger telling
[1:02:33] you you
[1:02:34] are highly favored of the lord he has
[1:02:37] chosen you he delights in you he loves
[1:02:39] you
[1:02:40] but what about my mistakes you are
[1:02:42] highly favored tonight
[1:02:43] he has chosen you tonight he loves you
[1:02:46] he's taking you in a rapture
[1:02:48] quit trying to talk your way out of it
[1:02:50] he chose you
[1:02:51] quit running from it he loves you he's
[1:02:54] taking you home
[1:02:55] he's going to get you you may go kicking
[1:02:58] and screaming because for some reason
[1:02:59] some people just want to bring up all
[1:03:01] the reasons they
[1:03:02] can't and he's telling you i love you i
[1:03:04] don't care
[1:03:05] quit saying those things just accept my
[1:03:07] favor
[1:03:08] just accept my favor tonight
[1:03:16] every end time has awful conditions
[1:03:19] every end time it seemed like satan
[1:03:20] turns the world mad
[1:03:23] but every end time had something else
[1:03:25] too
[1:03:26] every end time had someone that found
[1:03:29] favor with
[1:03:30] god abraham found favor
[1:03:33] noah found favor mary found favor and i
[1:03:36] would like to remind you tonight that
[1:03:38] you
[1:03:38] have found favor with god in the end
[1:03:41] time
[1:03:42] of all end times in the most wicked time
[1:03:44] the world has ever seen
[1:03:46] you have found favor with almighty god
[1:03:50] can we let that begin to elevate our
[1:03:52] faith a little bit tonight
[1:03:54] can we begin to turn our attention
[1:03:55] tonight away from the negatives of the
[1:03:58] end time
[1:03:59] and begin to acknowledge that if the
[1:04:01] world is getting in an end time
[1:04:03] condition
[1:04:04] there must be a people that are also
[1:04:06] getting in an
[1:04:07] end time condition if the world's in
[1:04:10] end time condition there's a bride in an
[1:04:12] end time condition
[1:04:13] if satan has reached his power there is
[1:04:16] a people
[1:04:16] with the full power of the living god it
[1:04:19] has reached its zenith and here we are
[1:04:21] in our end time condition you say oh i
[1:04:25] don't want to be in the end time
[1:04:26] condition i do
[1:04:27] i want to be in the end time condition
[1:04:29] for the bride that condition
[1:04:30] that's going to have him look over the
[1:04:32] banister and say they're ready
[1:04:34] they're ready and we get to such a place
[1:04:36] that our lives
[1:04:37] it begins to call him back we actually
[1:04:40] call for the rapture
[1:04:41] we call for the dead in christ to rise
[1:04:43] because we are in
[1:04:44] an end-time condition
[1:04:47] [Applause]
[1:04:50] brother tim put it so wonderful sunday
[1:04:51] we are the anointed ones at the end time
[1:04:56] in an end time condition there must be
[1:05:00] people in that condition
[1:05:02] you are that people
[1:05:05] you are highly favored
[1:05:08] there in verse 28 the angel says hell
[1:05:12] thou art highly favored come
[1:05:16] that's just in the written part he
[1:05:17] didn't say that
[1:05:20] comma thou art highly favored comma
[1:05:23] the lord is
[1:05:26] with thee the lord
[1:05:30] is with thee so what we recognize is
[1:05:32] that with his favor
[1:05:34] comes his never failing presence
[1:05:38] with his favor comes his never failing
[1:05:41] presence church the lord is with thee if
[1:05:43] you have his favor tonight
[1:05:45] the lord is with thee why should i fear
[1:05:48] then
[1:05:48] why should i worry what can satan do
[1:05:51] when the lord is with me
[1:05:52] when i have his favor upon my life when
[1:05:55] he has called me
[1:05:56] when he has chosen me and he is going
[1:05:58] before me and he is with me i have
[1:05:59] nothing to fear
[1:06:03] it's the exact same thing he told gideon
[1:06:05] over in judges 6
[1:06:07] right before he gave him his commission
[1:06:09] he says the lord
[1:06:11] is with thee think about that for just a
[1:06:13] second
[1:06:14] the lord is with you the angel is about
[1:06:16] to ask mary
[1:06:18] to believe something that seems
[1:06:19] impossible to the human mind
[1:06:22] the angel is about to tell her that
[1:06:24] she's going to have a child even though
[1:06:25] she knows no man
[1:06:27] and what does the angel tell her to
[1:06:29] raise her faith
[1:06:30] to meet the challenge of what it is
[1:06:32] she's about to hear
[1:06:35] thou art highly favored and the lord
[1:06:38] is with thee these are the two things he
[1:06:41] gives her
[1:06:42] to elevate her faith so that when she
[1:06:44] hears these things she doesn't respond
[1:06:46] like zechariah responded
[1:06:48] to elevate her faith to a place that
[1:06:50] she's able to respond in a way that
[1:06:52] pleases the lord
[1:06:53] thou art highly favored and the lord is
[1:06:56] with thee listen church there may be
[1:06:58] great challenges ahead
[1:07:00] i don't know what lies just around the
[1:07:02] curve or just over the men there may be
[1:07:03] great challenges
[1:07:05] there may be great storms some of you
[1:07:07] may already be in the midst of one of
[1:07:08] the greatest storms of your life
[1:07:10] i know there are great miracles that lay
[1:07:12] just ahead i know there's a body change
[1:07:15] that lays just ahead
[1:07:16] i know there's a rapture that lays just
[1:07:18] ahead and what did our message
[1:07:20] tell us to elevate our faith to the
[1:07:22] place that we can receive and meet the
[1:07:24] challenge of the hour
[1:07:25] thou art highly favored and the lord is
[1:07:28] with thee listen he told us the lord
[1:07:32] is with you he said i am not a dead god
[1:07:35] i am not a god of history
[1:07:37] i am not a god of the past but night
[1:07:39] after night
[1:07:40] service after service time after time he
[1:07:43] came and he declared i
[1:07:44] am here i have not left you alone i'm
[1:07:47] not a god in a history book somewhere
[1:07:49] but i am with you i am an ever-present
[1:07:52] help in the time of need
[1:07:53] time after time i'm here i can hear a
[1:07:56] prophet of god say
[1:07:57] he's here he's here because he hasn't
[1:08:00] left
[1:08:00] us he's favored us and he will never
[1:08:03] leave us
[1:08:03] the never failing presence of almighty
[1:08:06] god is in this building tonight
[1:08:08] and he is here to show you favor
[1:08:11] amen i am with you
[1:08:16] brother branham says and now we pray
[1:08:18] heavenly father that you will continue
[1:08:20] to be with us
[1:08:21] and help us as we journey on each and
[1:08:24] every one of us
[1:08:28] give us thy undergirding power and the
[1:08:30] faith of knowing
[1:08:31] that thy never failing presence will be
[1:08:34] with us
[1:08:35] in that hour when we cannot help
[1:08:36] ourselves we know
[1:08:38] the angels of god are encamped about
[1:08:40] those who fear him
[1:08:41] and they will bear us up lest at any
[1:08:43] time we dash our foot
[1:08:45] against the stone church it's not a time
[1:08:49] for us to be dwelling on our favor
[1:08:50] on our failures it's not a time
[1:08:54] for us to look at how possible it may
[1:08:56] seem
[1:08:57] we've heard two wonderful services from
[1:08:59] brother joe impossible doesn't mean
[1:09:00] nothing to god
[1:09:01] god solves impossible situations
[1:09:04] it's not a time to question really me
[1:09:08] but but but i've done so many things
[1:09:09] wrong but you don't understand my
[1:09:11] i think god understands your past
[1:09:14] there's nothing you can tell him that he
[1:09:15] don't know and yet we seem
[1:09:17] so intent on telling him all the reasons
[1:09:19] we can't live up to what he wants us he
[1:09:21] knows
[1:09:22] hello that's why he provided a way
[1:09:25] that's why he provided a sacrifice
[1:09:27] that's why he made a way for you because
[1:09:29] he already knows
[1:09:31] you're not surprising him he's not going
[1:09:34] i picked you
[1:09:37] my bad no
[1:09:41] he don't have my bads he don't make
[1:09:43] mistakes he's not telling you you're
[1:09:45] highly favored tonight just to get your
[1:09:47] hopes up and when you leave he's gonna
[1:09:48] go
[1:09:49] yeah they don't stand a chance that's
[1:09:51] not our god
[1:09:52] our god is true our god is faithful and
[1:09:55] if he's telling you that you are highly
[1:09:57] favored and if he's telling you that his
[1:09:58] presence is with you it's because it's
[1:10:00] the truth
[1:10:00] it's because he's called you and he's
[1:10:02] chose you and he's gonna see you all the
[1:10:04] way through
[1:10:04] there is nothing gonna stop this bride
[1:10:07] there is nothing gonna stop this bride
[1:10:08] i'm telling you right now he said i will
[1:10:10] have a bride that will be without spot
[1:10:12] and without wrinkle and i don't know how
[1:10:14] he's gonna do it i look at myself and i
[1:10:16] go i myself would mess up that whole
[1:10:18] plan
[1:10:19] i would be a spot i would be a regal but
[1:10:21] he says no i
[1:10:22] already thought about that i provided
[1:10:24] everything i took away every blemish
[1:10:26] i took away every sin i took away every
[1:10:28] failure and now
[1:10:30] you are highly favored hallelujah
[1:10:37] i'm so insignificant yes you are
[1:10:41] so am i but not to him
[1:10:48] i'm so full of problems i'm so i'm so
[1:10:51] listen it's not about what you can do
[1:10:55] this isn't about how good you are this
[1:10:57] is about you have found favor
[1:11:00] brother branham says i love this
[1:11:03] hail mary blessed art thou amongst women
[1:11:06] thou hast found favor with god o
[1:11:09] church hail blessed are you among the
[1:11:13] people
[1:11:13] for you have found favor with god you've
[1:11:16] believed for eternal life
[1:11:17] and gods give you the baptism of the
[1:11:20] holy ghost
[1:11:21] hell church you are highly favored
[1:11:25] you are highly favored quit putting it
[1:11:28] over there i know that person is you
[1:11:30] are highly favored tonight
[1:11:34] it's time that you receive the favor
[1:11:36] that he's trying to give you
[1:11:38] if we're going to bring forth the return
[1:11:40] of the promised son
[1:11:41] if we're going to produce all the word
[1:11:43] says that we're going to produce
[1:11:44] we must respond to god's favor the same
[1:11:47] way that mary responded to it
[1:11:50] if we're going to bring these things
[1:11:51] forth we got to move beyond
[1:11:53] our self-pity we gotta move beyond woe
[1:11:57] is me and move a little bit closer to be
[1:11:59] it unto me
[1:12:01] we got too many people saying woe is me
[1:12:03] woe is me i just need you to move over
[1:12:05] here
[1:12:05] and say be it unto me is not that much
[1:12:08] different in words it's not that much
[1:12:09] harder to say
[1:12:10] just let it come out of your soul lord
[1:12:12] whatever it is you have
[1:12:14] my circumstances aren't perfect my
[1:12:16] situation isn't perfect
[1:12:18] but i hear a word tonight saying i'm
[1:12:19] highly favored and i just want to
[1:12:21] respond
[1:12:22] and say lord be it unto me
[1:12:25] let that be who i am tonight
[1:12:33] six months before this visitation with
[1:12:35] mary
[1:12:36] gabriel visited zacharias in the temple
[1:12:41] in luke 1 5 it says there was in the
[1:12:43] days of herod the king of judea
[1:12:45] a certain priest named zacharias of the
[1:12:48] course of abia
[1:12:49] and his wife was of the daughters of
[1:12:51] aaron and her name was elizabeth
[1:12:54] and they were both righteous before god
[1:12:56] walking in all the commandments and
[1:12:58] ordinances of the lord
[1:12:59] blameless and they had no child
[1:13:03] because that elizabeth was barren and
[1:13:05] they both were now well
[1:13:07] stricken in years brother branham talks
[1:13:10] about how
[1:13:12] zacharias actually had examples in the
[1:13:14] scripture
[1:13:15] and he had no reason to doubt whereas
[1:13:17] mary actually had something harder to
[1:13:19] believe
[1:13:20] because it was something that had never
[1:13:21] happened and when i looked back and i
[1:13:23] looked at abraham and sarah it's amazing
[1:13:26] there's literally a scripture that is
[1:13:28] almost identical to that scripture
[1:13:30] and it's in genesis 18 11.
[1:13:33] it says now abraham and sarah were old
[1:13:38] and well stricken in age and it ceased
[1:13:41] to be sarah
[1:13:42] to be with sarah after the manner of
[1:13:45] women
[1:13:47] luke 1 7 says they had no child because
[1:13:49] elizabeth was barren
[1:13:50] and they were both now well stricken in
[1:13:53] years
[1:13:53] it's literally almost the same situation
[1:13:57] and him being a priest you know he knows
[1:13:59] the story well he knows that this has
[1:14:01] happened before
[1:14:04] skip down to verse 11 of luke 1 and it
[1:14:06] says and there appeared unto him an
[1:14:07] angel of the lord standing on the right
[1:14:09] side of the altar of incense
[1:14:11] and when zechariah saw him he was
[1:14:12] troubled and fear fell upon him
[1:14:14] but the angel said unto him fear not
[1:14:16] zacharias for thy prayer is heard
[1:14:18] now wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[1:14:21] thou shalt call his name
[1:14:23] john and thou shalt have joy and
[1:14:26] gladness
[1:14:27] and many shall rejoice at his birth
[1:14:28] listen to this salutation it's
[1:14:30] absolutely wonderful
[1:14:31] you're going to have joy and you're
[1:14:32] going to have gladness
[1:14:35] he shall be great in the sight of the
[1:14:37] lord and shall drink neither wine nor
[1:14:39] strong
[1:14:40] drink and he shall be filled with the
[1:14:41] holy ghost even from his mother's womb
[1:14:44] and many of the children of israel shall
[1:14:46] he turn to the lord their god
[1:14:48] this is wonderful this is powerful
[1:14:52] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[1:14:54] and the power of elias
[1:14:55] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:14:57] children and the disobedient to the
[1:14:59] wisdom of the just
[1:15:00] to make ready a people prepared for the
[1:15:02] lord
[1:15:03] listen church this is big this this is
[1:15:07] good news
[1:15:09] there has never been a message quite
[1:15:11] like this delivered to a person
[1:15:12] what a message and the thing is what's
[1:15:15] amazing about this
[1:15:16] look zechariah probably fits and run the
[1:15:18] house he's fixing to jump and shout and
[1:15:20] give praise and glory and receive this
[1:15:22] message
[1:15:23] and this is all i can't wait to see how
[1:15:25] he responds here what what a message he
[1:15:27] says
[1:15:28] listen you've been praying and asking
[1:15:30] for a child i don't know if you noticed
[1:15:31] that in the very beginning he said this
[1:15:32] is an answer to
[1:15:34] your prayer zacharias has been praying
[1:15:38] for this
[1:15:39] he's been praying oh zechariah your
[1:15:41] prayers have been heard
[1:15:42] not only will you and elizabeth have a
[1:15:45] son but he's going to be great in the
[1:15:46] sight of the lord
[1:15:47] not only are you going to have a son but
[1:15:48] he's going to be filled with the holy
[1:15:49] ghost even from his mother's womb
[1:15:52] many are going to turn to god because of
[1:15:54] your son this is wonderful
[1:15:55] he will be the forerunner oh praise the
[1:15:59] lord
[1:16:00] and zechariah says unto the angel
[1:16:03] whereby shall i know this for i'm an old
[1:16:06] man
[1:16:07] and my wife is well stricken in years
[1:16:12] church this was his prayer this was what
[1:16:16] he'd been asking for
[1:16:18] and now the angel comes to tell him your
[1:16:20] prayers have been heard and not only
[1:16:21] that as god usually does he's going
[1:16:23] above and beyond not only are you going
[1:16:24] to have a son
[1:16:25] but look how awesome this is going to be
[1:16:27] he's the forerunner he's going to turn a
[1:16:29] nation back to their god can you believe
[1:16:31] this is that
[1:16:32] i said i can't
[1:16:35] no i can't believe that
[1:16:39] i wonder sometimes if we're expecting to
[1:16:41] receive the things we're asking for
[1:16:46] can we accept it when the word
[1:16:47] pronounces you healed
[1:16:50] i've been praying a long time for this
[1:16:52] you're hilton you don't know how i feel
[1:16:54] right now
[1:16:55] i'm telling you by his stripes you're
[1:16:57] healed no you don't understand what i'm
[1:16:59] telling you
[1:16:59] i'm hurting can we accept it
[1:17:03] when the word gives us what it is we've
[1:17:05] been asking for
[1:17:07] can we accept it when the word says that
[1:17:09] your children are going to be saved
[1:17:11] you don't know my children you're right
[1:17:12] i probably don't
[1:17:14] but the word says that they'll be there
[1:17:16] in their offspring with them so i'm just
[1:17:17] going to hold on to that
[1:17:18] regardless of the case regardless of
[1:17:20] your situation i'm just going to hold on
[1:17:22] he's given me no reason to doubt him i'm
[1:17:24] not going to start doubting now
[1:17:28] can we accept it when the lord says when
[1:17:30] the word tells us that the promise is
[1:17:31] unto you
[1:17:33] i just can't receive the baptism of the
[1:17:35] holy ghost i've tried it ain't about
[1:17:36] trying
[1:17:37] it's about receiving it's about
[1:17:38] accepting he gave it to you quit arguing
[1:17:40] with him and accept the favor that he's
[1:17:42] trying to give you here tonight
[1:17:44] or do we respond tonight like zacharias
[1:17:48] instead of like mary one bible scholar
[1:17:51] says that this was not a humble petition
[1:17:53] for the confirmation of his faith
[1:17:57] but a peevish objection against what was
[1:18:00] said to him
[1:18:01] as altogether incredible or impossible
[1:18:06] as if he would have said i can never be
[1:18:08] made
[1:18:09] to believe this
[1:18:13] i can never be made to believe this
[1:18:17] verse 19 and the angel answered said
[1:18:19] unto him i
[1:18:20] am gabriel something tells me that his
[1:18:23] tone probably changed a little bit after
[1:18:25] zechariah's response
[1:18:27] i'm thinking that it wasn't quite so
[1:18:28] friendly and warm at first it was like
[1:18:30] fear not
[1:18:31] you know there are this wonderful
[1:18:32] thing's about to happen i don't believe
[1:18:34] you
[1:18:35] i am gabriel at this point he might have
[1:18:38] had a little reason to fear oh that's
[1:18:40] just that's just me
[1:18:43] his tone changed a little bit i am
[1:18:45] gabriel that stand in the presence of
[1:18:47] god
[1:18:47] and i have sent to speak unto thee and
[1:18:50] to show thee
[1:18:51] these glad tidings and behold you
[1:18:54] shall be dumb and not be able to speak
[1:18:57] listen doubt and fear are contagious
[1:19:02] and he was in a situation where he knew
[1:19:04] mary was fitting to have to receive a
[1:19:05] miracle
[1:19:06] he knew these things were in the season
[1:19:08] of miracles and i'm not going to have
[1:19:09] you spreading your doubt
[1:19:11] i'm not going to have you spreading your
[1:19:12] unbelief i am going to shut
[1:19:14] your mouth listen it's time to tune out
[1:19:17] the messengers of doubt
[1:19:19] it's time to tune out those that will
[1:19:21] tell you god don't do that anymore
[1:19:23] god may not shut their mouths but you
[1:19:24] can shut your ears and tell them i'm not
[1:19:26] listening to you
[1:19:27] i don't care if it comes over social
[1:19:29] media or facebook or across a pulpit
[1:19:31] if they're a messenger of doubt don't
[1:19:33] listen to them
[1:19:37] so he shuts his mouth
[1:19:40] listen what he said was completely
[1:19:42] different from what mary said there was
[1:19:43] a time when i was younger and i'd look
[1:19:44] at it and mary would said
[1:19:46] well how will this thing be and then i
[1:19:48] would read where the prophet says she
[1:19:49] never
[1:19:50] questioned anything she and i'm like
[1:19:51] well i mean i don't know that looks like
[1:19:52] a question i'm just saying
[1:19:56] but i'm moving on but the difference is
[1:20:00] if you actually get into it and look at
[1:20:01] what mary is saying
[1:20:02] it's just a question of okay i believe
[1:20:06] this
[1:20:06] how are you going to do it's almost
[1:20:07] inquisitive how are you going to do it
[1:20:09] she's excited by the news that she has
[1:20:11] received
[1:20:12] she's excited by the news she said in
[1:20:15] other words how would i
[1:20:16] how can i at this time conceive a child
[1:20:18] when i know not a man
[1:20:19] she's asking this because it's it's
[1:20:21] simply look i know the messiah is going
[1:20:22] to be virgin born
[1:20:23] i get it and now i'm the virgin this is
[1:20:25] good i'm excited
[1:20:27] now can you can you tell me how it's
[1:20:29] going to happen
[1:20:30] in other words this wasn't a language of
[1:20:32] distrust or a language of that it was
[1:20:34] simply a request
[1:20:35] for a little bit more instruction can
[1:20:37] you just tell me a little bit more
[1:20:39] can you tell me and i think that's the
[1:20:40] attitude of every real christian we sit
[1:20:42] here and the lord begins to speak to us
[1:20:44] and
[1:20:44] and we sit there can you tell me just a
[1:20:45] little bit more can you instruct me just
[1:20:47] a little bit more
[1:20:48] i like what i'm hearing you said there's
[1:20:49] going to be a bride you said there's
[1:20:51] going to be a rapture tell me a little
[1:20:52] bit more
[1:20:53] feed me a little bit more i want to know
[1:20:55] a little bit more about what it is
[1:20:56] you're doing
[1:20:57] lord feed me tell me a little bit more i
[1:21:00] believe you lord
[1:21:01] i believe you but i just want a little
[1:21:03] bit more of it tonight
[1:21:05] and that's what mary's saying can you
[1:21:07] just give me a little bit more
[1:21:09] can you tell me how you're going to do
[1:21:10] it there's there's an air of excitement
[1:21:12] about it
[1:21:14] this isn't a language of doubt it's a
[1:21:15] language of excitement
[1:21:17] luke 1 35 and the angel answered and
