[19:03] honor knowing I I'm standing with you
[19:05] today, Lord, and that you're going to
[19:07] come in this place because you promised,
[19:08] [music] Lord, where two or three gather,
[19:10] Lord, that you would be in the midst of
[19:12] us. And so, Lord, we want to give you
[19:14] the preeminence, Lord. I'm asking you to
[19:16] take control. Well, I'm asking, Lord,
[19:17] that everything said and done and every
[19:20] song, Lord, may it bring glory to your
[19:22] name, Lord. And may today, may the
[19:24] kingdom of God be elevated and lifted up
[19:26] in the hearts of men and women. And
[19:28] Lord, Satan's kingdom destroyed today,
[19:31] torn down today. May may the chains of
[19:33] bondage and sin and depression and
[19:35] anxiety, Lord, I pray they fall off

[20:09] pray today, Father. Lord, every hand
[20:11] that went up, you understand what
[20:13] [music] was represented by the lifting
[20:14] of that hand. You know the heart beneath
[20:16] it, the needs in the homes, Lord.
[20:18] Financial needs, spiritual needs,
[20:20] physical needs. [music] Lord, nothing is
[20:22] too hard for you. There is nothing too
[20:25] hard for our God. And we look to you
[20:27] today, Lord, and we expect you to meet
[20:29] those needs because you promised, Lord,
[20:31] we I don't believe we can ask anything
[20:33] too big. I believe you want [music] us
[20:34] to ask big. So, we're here today asking
[20:37] and believing and we shall receive
[20:39] today, Father, because we're your
[20:41] children. We're not coming as beggars,
[20:43] Lord. We're coming as family today.
[20:45] We're coming as children of the most
[20:47] high God. And Lord, we just thank you
[20:49] and we ask you now, Lord, to take
[20:51] control, Lord. Every moment of this
[20:53] service, may it bring you glory today,
[20:55] [music] Lord. And we just commit it all
[20:57] into your hands now. In Jesus name we

[56:54] Uh
[57:01] &gt;&gt; number of years ago, my daughter Rebecca
[57:05] wrote a song.
[57:08] She sung [music] it at church and and um
[57:12] let me also say this that I I don't mind
[57:16] if y'all sit down, but I don't mind you
[57:17] standing either. Whatever you want to
[57:19] do,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; we just come to worship the Lord.
[57:24] But uh a [music] few years ago, my
[57:26] daughter wrote a song and um such an
[57:30] encouragement to us uh at home and many
[57:33] of the saints were blessed by it. And
[57:35] when she wrote [music] it, she said,
[57:36] "Dad, I want you to sing this song." And
[57:40] um she given it to me and [music] I
[57:42] start singing it. And then um we were
[57:45] invited to a night of worship there at
[57:47] brother Paula Fontaine and uh brother
[57:50] Wesley Van Wick. [music] He said,
[57:53] "Sister Rebecca, we want you to sing the
[57:55] song. I know you gave it to your dad,
[57:56] but we want you to sing it." And that
[57:59] was like really her first time ever
[58:00] singing it. And from that uh video, some
[58:04] of the saints here, Sister Rebecca got a
[58:06] hold of it and [music] uh she started
[58:08] singing it and uh we happened to hear it
[58:12] at home. we were watching um and we
[58:15] [music] saw the song being sung here and
[58:17] we were just so blessed in our home in
[58:20] in West Palm Beach that man this song
[58:23] has taken off [music] and and going
[58:25] places and being a blessing to people.
[58:27] So we're we're grateful. So when I I
[58:29] knew I was coming, I said I'll I'll try
[58:32] to sing that amen here uh for you all. I
[58:36] know you're familiar with it. Amen.

[1:05:55] [applause]
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:06:04] [music]
[1:06:08] [applause]
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Father we pray that the spirit of God
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; will take us higher and [music] take us
[1:06:20] deeper
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; deeper in the love of God.
[1:06:28] What a privilege it is to [music] come
[1:06:30] into your house and to worship you and
[1:06:32] to praise you.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Forget about everything that we're going
[1:06:35] through and just concentrate [music] on
[1:06:38] Jesus.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Believe things happen when we come into
[1:06:42] your presence. [music] Change occurs
[1:06:45] when we come into your presence. We're
[1:06:48] asking God that you would just take
[1:06:50] control of the next portion of the
[1:06:52] service
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; to turn our heart to the word of God.
[1:06:57] the eternal living word of God. May
[1:07:00] Father, you come forth and may you speak
[1:07:01] to your people. Bring strength, [music]
[1:07:03] Lord, to each and every circumstance and
[1:07:06] situation.
[1:07:08] Lord, we commit this [music] portion of
[1:07:09] service into your hands. Thank you for
[1:07:11] all that you have done thus far.
[1:07:15] And we welcome, Father, the rest of the
[1:07:17] [music] service.
[1:07:19] It's in Jesus name that we pray. Amen.
[1:07:24] Can we give the Lord another hand of
[1:07:25] praise? [applause]
[1:07:35] [applause]
[1:07:36] We praise the Lord. Amen. We'll turn in
[1:07:39] our Bibles to very familiar passage of
[1:07:42] scripture.
[1:07:44] Uh
[1:07:48] when I call it out, I know that you
[1:07:50] don't even have to turn to it because
[1:07:51] you will just quote it to me. Hebrews 13
[1:07:58] and 8.
[1:08:03] The Bible declares
[1:08:06] Jesus Christ
[1:08:08] the same yesterday
[1:08:11] and today
[1:08:13] and forever.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[1:08:21] We are taking
[1:08:24] uh thought today. Amen. On
[1:08:28] the great I am.
[1:08:31] And um I know this is uh probably
[1:08:36] something that you have heard and and
[1:08:38] it's probably um
[1:08:42] good for me to announce that I don't
[1:08:43] bring anything new.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; I'm saying what all the other ministers
[1:08:49] are saying. And as I was just speaking
[1:08:51] with brother Tim, I've seen so many
[1:08:53] people try to be different and bring
[1:08:57] things new that maybe nobody else has
[1:09:00] ever seen. And I think when you start
[1:09:03] getting into areas like that, you get
[1:09:05] lost. You get confused
[1:09:09] because why would God Amen. make it so
[1:09:12] special that you the only one
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; that can see it?
[1:09:18] That's not the way God does things.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; He loves us all and he would want all of
[1:09:23] us to know. So, amen. You shouldn't be
[1:09:26] so special that you're the only one got
[1:09:28] a revelation that nobody else knows
[1:09:30] about, right? Praise the Lord. So, we
[1:09:33] we've all been through things like that.
[1:09:35] But uh as I bring this talk today, I
[1:09:38] know there'll be things that I'll say
[1:09:39] that you're very familiar with, but I'm
[1:09:41] hoping by the end of this journey uh we
[1:09:43] will trace the great I am.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; We want to we want to see where he has
[1:09:50] been and we want to see he where he is
[1:09:53] today.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; All right. So bear with me. I want to
[1:09:58] just uh read a few statements just to
[1:10:00] get us amen in the right channel. Uh,
[1:10:04] and um, they did not give me a time
[1:10:07] limit on the sermon, so
[1:10:10] I'll watch the clock. [laughter]
[1:10:12] Amen. But here in the message, Hebrews
[1:10:14] chapter 5 and six, brother Brandham
[1:10:16] makes a statement. He says, "And on his
[1:10:18] road down, he struck an experience."
[1:10:20] He's talking about Paul says, "The Holy
[1:10:22] Spirit come out in a big pillar of fire
[1:10:25] and it blinded him." Says, "Now we've
[1:10:27] went through that. The pillar of fire
[1:10:29] was Christ."
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the pillar of fire was Christ.
[1:10:36] Amen. And they said he's the same pillar
[1:10:38] of fire that led the children through
[1:10:41] the wilderness. Christ was God and God
[1:10:45] was Christ.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Says God was made flesh and dwelt in the
[1:10:49] body of the Lord Jesus. God was in
[1:10:52] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:10:55] showing what he was in the Bible back
[1:10:58] here. And the former verses we've been
[1:11:00] reading that he made himself Lord and
[1:11:01] the angels taken on the form not of
[1:11:04] angels but taken on a form of flesh.
[1:11:08] Angels had not fallen. They need no
[1:11:10] redemption. Flesh had fell human beings
[1:11:12] and they needed redemption. So in the
[1:11:14] old laws a man could be a redeemer.
[1:11:18] First he had to be kin folks. The great
[1:11:20] book of Ruth went through there went
[1:11:22] through here some time ago. And how that
[1:11:24] God being a spirit this is the key point
[1:11:25] that I want to make here. God being
[1:11:28] spirit was made kinfolk with us by
[1:11:30] becoming one of us in order to redeem us
[1:11:33] and give us eternal life. And look at
[1:11:34] this. He says this. He says he had to
[1:11:38] become us
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; that we through grace
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; might become as he.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; He had to become us
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; so we could become as he.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; We're not just in the message just to be
[1:11:54] in the message. There is a purpose and a
[1:11:57] goal here for God drawing you to the
[1:12:00] revealed word for this hour is so that
[1:12:02] you could become he.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. He goes on to say he
[1:12:08] says and we find the pillar of fire.
[1:12:11] Amen. That led the children of Israel
[1:12:13] and when it was made flesh here on earth
[1:12:15] we hear him talking one day and he
[1:12:17] claimed that he was the pillar of fire.
[1:12:20] Says they said do you say that you're
[1:12:22] greater than our father Abraham. said
[1:12:23] before Abraham was
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Who was the I am? Brother man asked the
[1:12:30] question. Who was the I am? He says the
[1:12:32] pillar of fire in the burning bush, a
[1:12:36] perpetual memorial through every
[1:12:38] generation. Not only that generation,
[1:12:41] but this generation, the same pillar of
[1:12:44] fire. And we're thankful this morning
[1:12:46] that we even have the picture of it.
[1:12:49] Amen. He has not changed.
[1:12:52] And we're not just talking about a
[1:12:53] pillar of fire that led the children of
[1:12:55] Israel out of Egypt.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And the pillar of fire that Paul met met
[1:12:58] on the road to Damascus. It's the same
[1:13:00] now. But he didn't stop there. That
[1:13:03] pillar of fire took a picture with his
[1:13:05] prophet. And there's been many services
[1:13:09] since the prophet has left where the
[1:13:11] same pillar of fire has showed up in the
[1:13:13] congregation.
[1:13:16] Brother, he is the same yesterday,
[1:13:19] today, and forever. The great I am is
[1:13:22] here.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You know, there was a a time
[1:13:31] in Israel's history uh before God
[1:13:34] actually displayed himself as this great
[1:13:36] pillar of fire and led them uh through
[1:13:38] Egypt. He gave a a promise to them in
[1:13:40] Genesis chapter 15. Glory to God. Verse
[1:13:43] 13- 16. We'll read it here really quick.
[1:13:45] It says he said to said unto Abram,
[1:13:48] "Know of assurityity that thy seed shall
[1:13:51] be a stranger in a land that is not
[1:13:54] theirs, and shall serve them, and they
[1:13:57] shall afflict them 400 years."
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "And also that nation whom they
[1:14:02] shall serve will I judge, and after it
[1:14:05] shall they come out with great
[1:14:07] substance."
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; I love these scriptures.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; It says, "And thou shalt go to thy
[1:14:13] fathers in peace. Thou shalt be buried
[1:14:15] in a good old age. It says, "But the
[1:14:18] fourth generation."
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. They shall come hither again, for
[1:14:23] the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet
[1:14:26] full.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like that fourth
[1:14:30] generation. I can't go in there today,
[1:14:31] but I know I know why brother Aaron
[1:14:33] said. Amen. But but but here here's what
[1:14:36] I want you to understand. Amen. that in
[1:14:38] this promise, God is telling Abraham
[1:14:40] that, you know, your seed, they're going
[1:14:42] to suffer for about 400 years and uh but
[1:14:45] God's going to bring them out with a
[1:14:46] mighty hand. Now, when it's in promise
[1:14:48] form,
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. God could be known as the great I
[1:14:54] will be.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Or God could be known as the great I
[1:15:00] will do.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; When it's in promise form, amen, it's a
[1:15:04] future tense work. So it would be the
[1:15:06] great I will do or the great I will be.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; But I'm not preaching about the great I
[1:15:13] will be or the great I will do. I'm
[1:15:16] preaching about the great I am.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; You see when the when the when the time
[1:15:22] of deliverance came for the children of
[1:15:24] Israel the promise was actually now
[1:15:27] coming to pass. So his name changes.
[1:15:30] Amen. When the situation changes.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when you begin to I mean you
[1:15:34] might be going through a sickness but
[1:15:36] when he becomes your healer he's not the
[1:15:39] I will do or I will be. He becomes the I
[1:15:42] am
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; I am your healer. I am your deliverer. I
[1:15:48] am your way maker. I am I am I am
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel pretty good.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; My God. My God.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, brother.
[1:16:02] [laughter]
[1:16:04] But here, you know, when we go back and
[1:16:05] we look, Amen. at scripture in Exodus 3,
[1:16:09] uh, we we pick them up there in in verse
[1:16:11] one, because now the time of fulfillment
[1:16:14] is coming for this promise that he made
[1:16:16] Abram. Hallelujah. Exodus 3 and verse
[1:16:19] one. Bear with me. Amen. I love this.
[1:16:22] Amen. We're not talking about the I will
[1:16:24] be the I. Amen. I used to be. No, I am.
[1:16:28] Here
[1:16:30] we see uh verse one says, "Now Moses
[1:16:33] kept the flock of Jethro, his
[1:16:35] father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and
[1:16:38] he led the flock to the backside of the
[1:16:40] desert and came to the mountain of God,
[1:16:42] even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord
[1:16:44] appeared unto him in a flame of fire,
[1:16:46] that pillar of fire, right? Uh and a
[1:16:49] flame of fire out of the midst of a
[1:16:51] bush, and he looked, and behold, the
[1:16:54] bush burned with fire, and the bush was
[1:16:55] not consumed." And Moses said,"I will
[1:16:58] now turn aside and see this great sight
[1:17:01] why the bush is not burnt." And when the
[1:17:04] Lord saw that he turned aside to see,
[1:17:06] God called unto him, Amen, out of the
[1:17:09] midst of the bush and said, "Moses,
[1:17:13] Moses." And he said, "Here am I."
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Draw not nigh hither, but
[1:17:21] put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for
[1:17:23] the place where on thou standest is holy
[1:17:25] ground. Mori said, "I am the God of thy
[1:17:29] father, the God of Abraham, and the God
[1:17:32] of Isaac, the God of Jacob." And Moses
[1:17:35] hid his face, for he was afraid to look
[1:17:37] upon God. Verse seven, "And the Lord
[1:17:40] said, I have surely seen the affliction
[1:17:42] of my people." So now the we're we're
[1:17:45] we're moving now into manifestation of
[1:17:47] the promise that God gave. And I want to
[1:17:50] tell somebody today, you're moving into
[1:17:52] manifestation of the promise that God
[1:17:54] gave you. Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. There's a season where
[1:17:59] you got to hold on, but then there's a
[1:18:02] season where it changes
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; and you begin to rejoice for the
[1:18:05] manifestation that God has brought to
[1:18:07] you.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse seven again. And the
[1:18:10] Lord said, I have surely seen the
[1:18:12] affliction of my people which are in
[1:18:14] Egypt. Amen. Uh and and and have heard
[1:18:17] their cry. I by by reason of their
[1:18:20] tasks, for I know their sorrows. For I
[1:18:22] am come down to deliver them out of the
[1:18:24] hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them
[1:18:26] out of the land, that land unto a good
[1:18:29] land, and a large unto land flowing with
[1:18:31] milk and honey, unto the place of the
[1:18:34] Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
[1:18:35] Amorites, and the Parizzites, and the
[1:18:37] Hivites, and the Jebusites. Now
[1:18:39] therefore, behold, the cry of the
[1:18:41] children of Israel is coming to me, and
[1:18:43] I have also seen the oppression
[1:18:44] wherewith the uh Egyptians oppressed
[1:18:47] them. God sees your oppression,
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; and he wants to do something about it.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Watch this now. Amen. He
[1:18:53] says, "Come now therefore, and I will
[1:18:55] send thee under Pharaoh, that thou
[1:18:57] mayest bring forth my people, the
[1:18:59] children of Israel, out of Egypt." And
[1:19:01] Moses said inh uh uh uh Moses said unto
[1:19:04] God, "Who am I that I should go unto
[1:19:07] Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth
[1:19:10] the children of Israel out of Egypt?" He
[1:19:12] says, "Certainly, I will be with thee,
[1:19:14] and this shall be a token unto thee that
[1:19:16] I have sent thee uh when thou when thou
[1:19:19] has brought forth the people of Egypt,
[1:19:21] ye shall serve God upon this mountain."
[1:19:23] Watch this now. It says, "And Moses said
[1:19:25] unto God, Behold, when I come unto the
[1:19:28] children of Israel, and say unto them,
[1:19:31] the God of your fathers has sent me unto
[1:19:34] you, and they shall say to me, what is
[1:19:38] his name?
[1:19:40] What shall I say unto them?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Now, Moses thought he had God stumped.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; They're going to want to know what your
[1:19:48] name is
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; when I go into to into Egypt and I try
[1:19:53] to tell them that the God of their
[1:19:54] fathers that sent me, they need to know
[1:19:56] your name. He thought he had God
[1:19:59] stumped.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; But God answered the question.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anytime you think you got a
[1:20:06] question for God, he has an answer for
[1:20:08] you.
[1:20:09] It might not be the answer that you
[1:20:11] like, but he's going to have an answer
[1:20:13] for you.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Look at the answer that God gives Moses.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; And God said unto Moses, you want to
[1:20:21] know my name?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; God said unto Moses, I am
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; that I am.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; And he said, thus thou shalt say unto
[1:20:31] the children of Israel, I am have sent
[1:20:35] me unto you. [screaming]
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Now that blessed me. Because when God
[1:20:40] gave Moses an answer to his question, he
[1:20:43] did not give him a past tense name.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; He did not give him a future tense name.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; But God gave Moses a name that could be
[1:20:54] used from generation to generation to
[1:20:58] generation. [cheering]
[1:20:59] That name can still be used today. What
[1:21:03] is his name? I am that I am. If you need
[1:21:08] healing, [screaming] I am. Hallelujah.
[1:21:11] If you need deliverance, [cheering]
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; praise God. I don't care what you're
[1:21:16] bound in. He is still the great.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; He's still the great I am.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad Moses asked that question.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Because we benefit from the revelation
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; of who God is.
[1:21:34] That's right.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; I was looking at a Let me put it this
[1:21:39] way. I was not just looking. I was
[1:21:41] listening to a tape.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; I want to make that clear. I was
[1:21:46] listening.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I I was listening to a tape.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; I pressed play.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; I've always been pressing play.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Ever since I came to the message,
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; I've been pressing play.
[1:22:01] That's how I get inspiration for my
[1:22:02] sermons by pressing play.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelu.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Right. I was listening to the tape and
[1:22:10] this is how the sermon came to me. And
[1:22:12] this this the sermon that brother
[1:22:14] Brandon preached was a sermon called
[1:22:15] perfect faith.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; And and he made a statement there. He
[1:22:18] says now and I want to just I want to
[1:22:20] just coast here just for a little bit.
[1:22:22] Uh but we're going to pick up and and go
[1:22:23] some places. I'm eventually I'm going to
[1:22:25] turn a corner in this sermon because I
[1:22:28] got to we got to trace the great I am.
[1:22:30] We got to trace him.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; We see him back here in Exodus when he
[1:22:33] gives his name to Moses, but we got to
[1:22:35] trace him right through the scriptures.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I can tell you even
[1:22:40] before he spoke to Moses in this fashion
[1:22:42] in Genesis, he identified himself as the
[1:22:44] I am.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; We'll get there later.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; But let me just share this this little
[1:22:49] quote with you out of our perfect faith.
[1:22:51] Brother Brandon makes a statement says,
[1:22:53] "Many of you will be waiting over till
[1:22:55] in the morning that's got a long
[1:22:57] distance to go and I appreciate that
[1:22:59] effort. Some of you will drive home
[1:23:01] tonight cuz you got to go to work by
[1:23:03] daylight in the morning and I know it's
[1:23:05] hard." And then when I think I see that,
[1:23:07] he says, he says, "I see that." He says,
[1:23:10] "I get spells, too."
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; A a prophet.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I get spells, too. You know, and
[1:23:19] look at what he says. I get moody.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. Oh, not a prophet. A prophet
[1:23:27] is spiritual all the time, brother.
[1:23:29] Never has any problems. No issues at
[1:23:31] all. That's not what he said.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "I get spells, too, and I get
[1:23:36] moody." See, I like to just bring things
[1:23:38] like this because we need to we need to
[1:23:40] see the humanity
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; of God's prophet. I'm going to tell you
[1:23:44] the reason that we have so many problems
[1:23:45] because people miss the humanity.
[1:23:51] Can you imagine being around the prophet
[1:23:52] and he gets moody?
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; You know what happens with me when I get
[1:23:57] moody?
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; I don't even want to talk.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, I guess we don't have anybody in
[1:24:01] here that gets moody.
[1:24:04] I don't even want to talk. And and
[1:24:06] people might say, "You got an evil
[1:24:07] spirit on you, brother. You got a bad
[1:24:09] spirit because you don't talk." No, just
[1:24:11] give me grace.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; I'm just a little bit moody.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he gets moody.
[1:24:20] Somebody just got free right there.
[1:24:26] [applause]
[1:24:30] It
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; It's good to see the humanity of things.
[1:24:33] Let's be sane, Christian.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I I like the way he put that, right? So,
[1:24:40] he says, "I get moody. I get spells. I
[1:24:43] get all He says, I get moody. get to a
[1:24:44] spot where what gets me is when I get to
[1:24:47] to to those spells when I c when I get
[1:24:49] all overworked.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said when I get all
[1:24:52] overworked that's when this comes on me.
[1:24:54] He says um and Satan comes telling me
[1:24:57] why nobody cares for you.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; You really haven't got a friend in the
[1:25:02] world.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; See and say and remember he and look at
[1:25:05] this. He says I'm not immune
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; from temptation.
[1:25:10] That's right.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; He says, "I got to overcome that." Then
[1:25:14] when I look back and see something like
[1:25:16] this, I put it right back in his face
[1:25:19] and say, "What about that?" And that
[1:25:21] helps me to overcome what about that.
[1:25:24] Now, now he was going on in this in this
[1:25:26] in this quote and he was talking about
[1:25:28] an experience of a young brother that
[1:25:30] somebody approached this young man and
[1:25:32] begin to kind of try to cast doubt on
[1:25:34] brother Brandham's meetings. And uh now
[1:25:37] maybe you should, you know, that that's
[1:25:38] that's they off to work. they this, they
[1:25:40] that, and maybe you shouldn't be with,
[1:25:41] and they're just kind of casting all
[1:25:43] kind of doubt.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Well, this young man um he didn't really
[1:25:47] know what to say when all these people
[1:25:49] were coming against him. So, what
[1:25:51] happened was that somebody at a meeting,
[1:25:53] amen, in a town where these people were
[1:25:56] coming from to come against brother
[1:25:57] Brandham. He said somebody was in a
[1:25:59] meeting and got prayed for and got
[1:26:01] healed in the meeting. Amen. And when
[1:26:04] they got healed in the meeting, that
[1:26:06] young man took them back to that
[1:26:08] experience. He says, "Now, I know you're
[1:26:10] saying this and you're saying that, but
[1:26:12] you know, sister so and so was really
[1:26:14] going through a lot, but she got healed
[1:26:16] in the meeting. The vindication alone
[1:26:18] was enough to keep that young man
[1:26:20] stabilized."
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; God has already vindicated this this
[1:26:25] message. We don't have to do any more
[1:26:27] vindication. It has already been
[1:26:29] vindicated.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; He said he said he says uh he says now
[1:26:34] he says uh uh you we know about that
[1:26:36] sister. We know how bad her condition
[1:26:38] was. And now that lady is perfectly
[1:26:40] healed. And that young man looked to
[1:26:42] them people that were criticizing the
[1:26:43] message. He says, "What about that?"
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; And see what it is is that sometimes you
[1:26:51] have to go back in your mind and realize
[1:26:53] what God has already done.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he don't do anymore, you
[1:26:58] can go back to what he has already done
[1:27:01] and look the devil in his eye and say,
[1:27:03] "What about that?"
[1:27:06] You already seen God heal cancer in this
[1:27:08] church.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; What about that? Sister had stage four
[1:27:12] cancer and God brought her back. What
[1:27:15] about that
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; brother in the [screaming] hospital
[1:27:20] dying and Amen. And and God raised him
[1:27:22] up when when the pastor cast that spirit
[1:27:25] off of him. What about that?
[1:27:29] [cheering]
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; We got witnesses here of God being a a
[1:27:31] healer. Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Don't tell us about the great I was
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; tell us about the great I am.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes in this message
[1:27:44] says so this young man knowing that he
[1:27:47] said then explain her case that settled
[1:27:49] it. Explain you know she had cancer. She
[1:27:51] here she was here in Louisville and the
[1:27:53] doctors was to perform the operation
[1:27:55] just simply she had cancer. Uh he says
[1:27:58] uh they they turned and and and solded
[1:28:00] her put her put her back. nothing could
[1:28:02] be done and now she is perfectly well.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; He said explain that that settled it.
[1:28:08] You know what the Bible said and they
[1:28:10] could say nothing a miss
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; because the man was standing right in
[1:28:13] their midst on whom the miracle was done
[1:28:15] on.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; And that's where we that's where he say
[1:28:18] it puts Satan to a shame, doesn't it?
[1:28:20] The man was standing there that the
[1:28:22] miracle was performed on. Does God raise
[1:28:24] the dead?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; He say here sits a man right here raised
[1:28:28] from the dead. Does God heal the sick?
[1:28:30] He says, "Oh my, the hands could just go
[1:28:32] up everywhere." God [screaming] heals
[1:28:34] the sick.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And brother Randle said, "We know he's
[1:28:38] the great,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; the great I am,
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; not the great I was
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; or will be.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; I am."
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. I am that's ever present,
[1:28:53] everywhere,
[1:28:54] all times. the same yesterday, today and
[1:28:59] forever.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. As I
[1:29:02] said, you could go back in the book of
[1:29:04] Genesis and God had used this name I am
[1:29:07] before.
[1:29:09] Uh go back to Genesis 15 and and one.
[1:29:12] We'll see what he says here to Abraham.
[1:29:17] It says, "After these things, the word
[1:29:21] of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision,
[1:29:24] saying, Fear not, Abram,
[1:29:27] I am
[1:29:29] thy shield
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; and thy exceeding great reward."
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; So, he's [clears throat] already using
[1:29:36] this title, I am I He's telling Abram, I
[1:29:39] am your shield
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; and your exceeding great reward. And and
[1:29:43] I I looked that up and I found that uh
[1:29:46] the word shield there, it means that I
[1:29:48] am the place where you place your faith.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; When he's telling you that I am your
[1:29:55] shield, that means I'm the place that
[1:29:57] you place your faith. Sometimes we try
[1:30:00] to use mama as a shield.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we try to use daddy as a
[1:30:05] shield.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; But God says, "I am your shield. I am
[1:30:10] the place that you put your faith.
[1:30:13] That's right.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; And when you got your faith placed in
[1:30:17] Christ, then it becomes your exceeding
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; and great reward.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I want to I want to
[1:30:24] just kind of share just how how how how
[1:30:27] quick Abraham saw it. So, this is
[1:30:30] Genesis 15 that God is telling him this.
[1:30:32] But in Genesis 14, praise God, I believe
[1:30:35] it was the the previous chapter there,
[1:30:37] uh where Abraham had a uh Lot got into
[1:30:43] some trouble and always is that Lot was
[1:30:46] just always in trouble
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; and Abraham would have to go and try to
[1:30:50] rescue Lot and get him out of this and
[1:30:52] get him out of that and what are you in
[1:30:54] now, Lot? Go get him. I mean, it was
[1:30:56] just always trouble with Lot. But
[1:30:58] Abraham never gave up on his brother.
[1:31:00] That's the That's the spirit of Christ.
[1:31:02] that's supposed to be and all of us not
[1:31:04] give up on our brothers and not give up
[1:31:06] on our sisters.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; No matter what condition they find
[1:31:09] themselves in, we still go after them
[1:31:11] with Christ went after us.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; But when Abraham overcame, he went and
[1:31:16] he battled these five kings and and when
[1:31:18] he overcame, they began to try to give
[1:31:20] Abraham a reward.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and Abraham said, "No, I don't
[1:31:27] want anything from y'all unless y'all
[1:31:28] say that y'all y'all going to get some
[1:31:30] glory out." say I don't want I don't
[1:31:31] want to have anything to do with that.
[1:31:33] And after Abraham said no, Abraham met
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Melzdc,
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; the very person MelzDC. And and here
[1:31:42] he's told in the next chapter say, you
[1:31:44] know what? I'm your shield. I'm the
[1:31:46] place that you put your faith. You
[1:31:48] didn't even have any weapons, but you
[1:31:50] went out after your brother anyway. I am
[1:31:53] your shield
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; and you're exceeding in great reward
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; pretty much. Now, he's given Abraham a
[1:32:01] promise that just turn and look around
[1:32:02] with the as far as your eyes can see.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; I've given you that.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; He became Abraham's shield and his great
[1:32:12] reward. I want to tell you another
[1:32:13] thing. When Abraham said no to those
[1:32:16] king those those kings and the offering
[1:32:18] that they were trying to give him, he
[1:32:19] said no to it. I want to I want to just
[1:32:21] say something very personal here to you.
[1:32:24] If Satan comes along and offers you a
[1:32:28] job,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; come on buddy,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; with a lot of money,
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; great benefits,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; but
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; you're going to have to miss church.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to say no to that.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And if you say no to it, I'm here to
[1:32:44] encourage you.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; God himself
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; will be your shield
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; and your exceeding great reward.
[1:32:58] Genesis 17, we see another time where
[1:33:01] God uses this term, I am. And here in
[1:33:03] Genesis 17:1, it says, when Abram was 90
[1:33:07] years old and nine, it says, "The Lord
[1:33:11] appeared to Abram and said unto him, I
[1:33:14] am
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; the Almighty God. Walk before me and be
[1:33:20] thou perfect." Now we got to understand
[1:33:22] when God is telling Abraham in this
[1:33:24] scripture that he is the almighty God,
[1:33:26] there was a little bit more being said
[1:33:28] than that. And what brother Random tells
[1:33:30] us that this is telling us that God
[1:33:32] became his El Shadai.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; I am your El Shadai, which means I am
[1:33:40] the breasted God.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Anytime you need strength, you just lean
[1:33:44] on me.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, we had a a a a
[1:33:49] family in the church and they had
[1:33:50] recently uh had a baby and I noticed
[1:33:53] that, you know, uh and being a father
[1:33:55] myself, I noticed there's times in the
[1:33:56] life, especially when they're they're
[1:33:58] they're newborns, there's times where
[1:34:00] you hear him crying and as a father, you
[1:34:02] want to go and you want to try to soo
[1:34:04] the baby and you pick it up and you pat
[1:34:06] it on the back and you just doing
[1:34:08] everything you can and seem like every
[1:34:09] time you touch the baby, the baby starts
[1:34:11] screaming harder and harder and harder
[1:34:13] and just I mean louder and louder and
[1:34:15] louder like it's like nothing you could
[1:34:16] do. But all of a sudden, you turn and
[1:34:19] you give the baby to mama.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; And when mama just gets that baby next
[1:34:23] to her breast, the baby just begins to
[1:34:26] calm down. It's something about Amen.
[1:34:28] going to the breasted God.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; All the worries begin to subside when
[1:34:34] you can make your way to the breasted
[1:34:36] God.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; I am El Shadai.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; I am thy shield. I am thy great
[1:34:43] exceeding and great reward. I am all
[1:34:46] this and more.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Let's look at something here.
[1:34:53] Uh
[1:34:55] in Isaac's day, God actually tells him
[1:34:58] in Genesis 26:24,
[1:35:01] God speaks to Isaac and he tells him, it
[1:35:03] says, "And the Lord appeared unto him
[1:35:05] the same night and said, I am the God of
[1:35:08] Abraham, thy father. Fear not,"
[1:35:10] Hallelujah. Here's a a good one. "I am
[1:35:13] with thee." And if he was with Isaac, if
[1:35:15] he was with Abraham, he's also with you
[1:35:18] to this morning.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am with thee and will
[1:35:22] bless thee and multiply thy seed for my
[1:35:25] servant Abraham's sake.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; We got to trace this I am through the
[1:35:30] scriptures. I found them also in Psalms
[1:35:32] 46. Amen. And 10. Glory to God. This is
[1:35:36] the the scripture that my my daughter uh
[1:35:39] uses. The whole Psalm 46 is where she
[1:35:42] gave birth to that song, You Are With
[1:35:43] Me. It comes out of Psalm 46. I won't
[1:35:46] take time to read it all, but you can as
[1:35:48] homework. But in in verse 10, it says
[1:35:50] something in verse 10. And Psalm 46
[1:35:52] says, "Be still."
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; And know that I am God.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; I will be exalted among the heathen. I
[1:36:04] will be exalted in the earth. I like
[1:36:06] that. Sometimes we get real fidgety. We
[1:36:08] get we want to get in God's way, but no,
[1:36:10] God said, "Be still
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; and know that I am God." I heard a
[1:36:15] sermon last week that was preached to
[1:36:16] me. He said, "Just just just just the
[1:36:18] power of committal, being able to commit
[1:36:20] something to God and not pick it up
[1:36:21] anymore
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; until God manifests himself. Be still
[1:36:25] and know that I am God." Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Also in Psalm 81:10, another one. I love
[1:36:32] this because uh this one there was a a
[1:36:35] George Mueller, if you ever heard his
[1:36:37] story, he was a man that had orphanages
[1:36:39] back in um in England. And uh and George
[1:36:43] Mueller, I was reading his his little
[1:36:44] biography, a little book that he
[1:36:46] written, and he says, you know, he used
[1:36:48] to pray prayers in a certain way uh like
[1:36:50] Lord, would you do this and Lord, would
[1:36:52] you do that and just just meet my need?
[1:36:54] Like one one minister said uh to me uh
[1:36:57] he said to our church a few weeks ago,
[1:36:58] he says, "Sometimes we pray that God
[1:37:00] would just give us enough gas money to
[1:37:02] get to church. God, I need just enough
[1:37:05] gas money to get to church." No, no, no,
[1:37:07] no. That's that's not the God we serve.
[1:37:08] You not only need gas money to get to
[1:37:10] church, you're going to need gas money
[1:37:11] to get home from church, and you need
[1:37:14] gas money to go to work next week. So
[1:37:16] when you're asking God, don't just ask
[1:37:18] for enough gas money to get to church.
[1:37:20] Ask for money for the whole week.
[1:37:27] That's exactly right. I mean, just ask
[1:37:29] God for big things. So, this man, George
[1:37:31] Mueller, said he used to ask very small
[1:37:33] things until he read this one scripture.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; When he read the scripture, he turned
[1:37:38] and started asking God for a lot greater
[1:37:40] things and said, and and and God began
[1:37:42] to fill his house with these greater
[1:37:43] things. Look at what the what the
[1:37:45] scripture was. says in in Psalms 81:10,
[1:37:47] "I am the Lord thy God,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; which brought thee out of the land of
[1:37:53] Egypt.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Open thy mouth
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; wide
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; open your mouth wide
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; and I will fill it."
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; But I mean that that's that I mean wide
[1:38:11] means big. O I mean open up and ask for
[1:38:14] big things.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; And said George Mueller read that
[1:38:17] scripture and said it changed his whole
[1:38:19] outlook on how he should have be
[1:38:21] approaching God. And from that day, not
[1:38:22] only did a man have one orphanage, he
[1:38:24] started having multiple orphanages.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:38:29] Hallelujah.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Let me go on a little further. Song of
[1:38:34] Solomon says this verse chapter 2 verse
[1:38:37] one. I am the rose of Sharon
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; and the lily of the valleys. This I am
[1:38:43] is being traced right through the
[1:38:45] scriptures.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; God is using this this term this title I
[1:38:48] am. And it's all over the scriptures. We
[1:38:50] we find it even all the way down in the
[1:38:52] book of Revelation. Revelation 22:16. It
[1:38:55] says, "I Jesus have sent my angel to
[1:38:58] testify to thee these things and
[1:38:59] churches. I am the root and offspring of
[1:39:02] David, the bright and morning star."
[1:39:04] Amen.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Revelation 18, I am Alpha and Omega, the
[1:39:09] beginning and the ending, sayeth the
[1:39:10] Lord, which is and which was and which
[1:39:12] is to come, the Almighty.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Everything you need.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to make a turn.
[1:39:27] There was a story in scripture. Brother
[1:39:31] Brandham made it very clear to us that
[1:39:33] when we look at this lady, her life
[1:39:36] looked in shambles.
[1:39:38] so bad that she was not invited to go to
[1:39:41] the well at the same time of day that
[1:39:43] the other ladies would go to the
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; she was a prostitute
[1:39:49] and she uh makes her way to the well uh
[1:39:52] one day and as she's on her way with her
[1:39:54] pots walking up to uh the well to get
[1:39:59] water
[1:40:00] somebody's sitting there at the well and
[1:40:03] she begins to enter into a conversation
[1:40:05] with this man that's sitting there and
[1:40:07] as she's talking to this man. Um, you
[1:40:11] know, the man's like, they got to
[1:40:12] talking about worship like, oh, you
[1:40:14] know, we worship over there and y'all
[1:40:16] worship over here and y'all say, you
[1:40:17] know, this and that. He says, you know,
[1:40:19] I'm not really here to kind of talk
[1:40:20] about that cuz, uh, you know, actually,
[1:40:23] uh, if you drink of the water that I got
[1:40:26] to offer,
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; so you never thirst again.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; And this would be like living wells of
[1:40:31] water coming out of your soul. She say,
[1:40:33] she's like, "Wait a minute. You ain't
[1:40:34] even got nothing to draw water with.
[1:40:36] What are you talking about?" I said,
[1:40:37] "No, no, the water." And I'm talking
[1:40:38] about a little different than what what
[1:40:39] you're looking for. And and he said, he
[1:40:41] said, "You'll never thirst again." He
[1:40:42] said, she said, "Sir, give me this
[1:40:44] water."
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; I want water like that that I'll never
[1:40:49] thirst again. He said, "Well, before I
[1:40:51] can give you a drink of this water, one
[1:40:53] issue." Brother Ram said the sin
[1:40:55] question had to be settled.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, he said, he said, "One
[1:40:59] one issue," he said, "Go get your
[1:41:00] husband
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; and come."
[1:41:04] She looked down. She says, "Um, I don't
[1:41:07] have no husband." He say, "Well said."
[1:41:09] Now, she never even got a chance to
[1:41:11] confess everything,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; but they were on the same wavelength.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; She said, "I don't have a husband." She,
[1:41:19] he said, he said, "Well said, because
[1:41:21] the one you living with right now is not
[1:41:24] your husband." Amen.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; She said, "Uh,
[1:41:28] sir, they told us that when Messiah
[1:41:32] comes, these are some of the things that
[1:41:34] he's going to be doing."
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; And and and and uh I mean, I know I
[1:41:39] learned in Sunday school about Messiah,
[1:41:41] but but I've never seen this coming to
[1:41:42] manifestation. Say, she said, and she
[1:41:44] said, "But they said this is what
[1:41:45] Messiah would do." And this is what
[1:41:47] Jesus said to her.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. She says I he pretty much said
[1:41:51] I am the Messiah that you've been
[1:41:54] looking for. Now he could not reveal
[1:41:56] himself like that to anybody else but to
[1:41:58] her because she had a predestinated
[1:42:00] seed.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; I am he that you've been looking for.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; And when she heard the I am was in
[1:42:08] flesh,
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; she took off running through the city.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Come see a man who has told me the
[1:42:17] things that I've done.
[1:42:19] Is not [screaming] this
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; from one experience at the well. Is not
[1:42:25] this the very Messiah?
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; You you see her experience there at the
[1:42:33] well. Jesus actually uh uh uh expressed
[1:42:37] to her the sign of the Messiah by
[1:42:40] revealing her sins.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; And then after he revealed her sins, he
[1:42:45] he revealed himself.
[1:42:48] Now let's watch this.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Random told us that you know um
[1:42:53] in this message recognizing your day in
[1:42:55] its message. He says if they only
[1:42:57] recognize the promised son of Messiah,
[1:42:59] the son of the son of man, he come in
[1:43:02] the name of the son of man. No. Now he
[1:43:04] was in the name through the Pentecostal
[1:43:06] age and the holy spirit son of god. Now
[1:43:08] the next thing is the millennium of son
[1:43:09] of David. Three sons name say three sons
[1:43:13] same god same father son holy ghost.
[1:43:15] Same God, son of David, son of God, the
[1:43:17] son of David, son of man, son of God,
[1:43:18] and the same God all the time, just in
[1:43:20] three different office works. So is the
[1:43:23] father, son, and holy ghost. Not three
[1:43:25] gods, but the same God in three
[1:43:27] dispensations, three office works as
[1:43:30] father, son, and holy spirit. He says,
[1:43:32] but like today, traditionally blinded,
[1:43:35] they was then traditionally blinded,
[1:43:38] they don't see it. Why can't they see
[1:43:40] it? He says, they never will see it.
[1:43:44] Remember that's thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:43:46] And that's sad. That's sad. I was
[1:43:48] talking to the brothers earlier say
[1:43:50] people that walk with the prophet,
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; slept with the prophet,
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; watch the miracles firsthand, watch the
[1:43:57] discernment firsthand and could not see
[1:43:59] it. And the prophet said they never
[1:44:02] will.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Well, who is this message for?
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; They're sitting here right now.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; We see it and we thank God for it. He
[1:44:14] says uh he says that's thus says Lord
[1:44:15] say why why are you standing up there?
[1:44:17] He says just the same as John did and
[1:44:19] just as the rest of them did. There was
[1:44:20] one sticking here and there that got to
[1:44:22] be brought out. Oh sheep of God, hear
[1:44:24] the voice of God. My sheep hear my
[1:44:25] voice. It said the woman at the well
[1:44:28] recognized her day by the sign of the
[1:44:31] Messiah. She was in a bad shape. She
[1:44:33] didn't have she didn't want to fool with
[1:44:35] them old churches. And I like what he
[1:44:36] says. She didn't want to fool with them
[1:44:38] old churches. This mean this lady had a
[1:44:40] desire to go to church
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; but didn't like what she was seeing in
[1:44:42] the church and that's how she ended up
[1:44:44] in the condition she was in because of
[1:44:46] what was happening in the church.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a lot of people out
[1:44:50] like like like that. A lot of people out
[1:44:51] in the world because of what happened in
[1:44:53] church and they just need to find
[1:44:54] something real.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; She didn't want to fool with the old
[1:45:00] churches. They that they were they that
[1:45:02] what what they were doing they were
[1:45:03] living every way and things they were
[1:45:05] doing. She didn't believe in that stuff,
[1:45:07] but she know there should come one one
[1:45:10] day. The poor little fellow up there on
[1:45:12] the way to the well, she found that
[1:45:14] thing that she was looking for.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; When he began to reveal to her the
[1:45:19] secret of a heart, told her the sin that
[1:45:21] she was living in. She said, "Sir, I
[1:45:23] perceive that you're a prophet."
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Now, they hadn't had one for 400 years.
[1:45:27] Said, "I perceive that you're a prophet.
[1:45:28] I know that when the Messiah comes, he
[1:45:30] will do these things." He said, "I am
[1:45:32] he." She recognized there was no more
[1:45:35] question. How can you prove it? It was
[1:45:36] already proved. When Messiah cometh,
[1:45:39] this is what he'll do. Well, if she
[1:45:40] recognized it by the scriptures, what?
[1:45:43] But but can't we recognize the evening
[1:45:45] lights and the sign of today? We know
[1:45:48] when Messiah cometh, he'll show us all
[1:45:50] these things. He tells us this. He said,
[1:45:52] "I am he that speaks to you." No more
[1:45:54] questions. Away she went. She told the
[1:45:57] people, "Come see. Here he is." No more
[1:45:59] question to her. It was set up because
[1:46:01] she recognized the day she was living
[1:46:02] and she recognized it. I like that. I'm
[1:46:05] at a spot in my Christian journey. I
[1:46:08] don't have any questions
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; about this message.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; It don't matter how many more websites
[1:46:16] are produced.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; I have no questions.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; None whatsoever. And and I remember a
[1:46:22] person kind of talking to me like,
[1:46:24] "Well, it's probably a waste of time to
[1:46:26] talk to you about this." It is. I mean,
[1:46:29] you be my guest. If you want to just try
[1:46:31] to get all the wind out that you can, be
[1:46:33] my guest. But it's not going to change
[1:46:35] my mind.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you bring up.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to change my mind. I
[1:46:41] simply believe.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; And that's what believers do. We
[1:46:44] believe.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; In this time of Jesus on the earth, he
[1:46:49] he he he he tells this lady, "I'm the
[1:46:52] one that you've been looking for. The
[1:46:53] very Messiah you've been looking for. I
[1:46:55] am he." But you know with the Sadducees
[1:46:59] and the Pharisees, he never revealed
[1:47:01] himself in that matter to them.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; There was a conversation that was
[1:47:05] conducted in uh John 8. A conversation
[1:47:09] in John 8 that Jesus has with the with
[1:47:12] the religious leaders. And let's look at
[1:47:13] this
[1:47:17] verse 53 says, "Art thou greater than
[1:47:19] thy father Abraham
[1:47:22] which is dead
[1:47:25] and the prophets are dead? Whom makest
[1:47:28] thou thyself?"
[1:47:31] Jesus answered, "If I honor myself, my
[1:47:34] honor is nothing. It is my father that
[1:47:37] honorth me, of whom you say that that he
[1:47:39] is your God. Yet ye have not known him,
[1:47:42] but I know him.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And if I sh if I should say I know him
[1:47:46] not, I shall be a liar like unto you,
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; my God. But I know him and keep his
[1:47:53] saying. Now watch this. Your father
[1:47:55] Abraham, because they ask him, say, you
[1:47:57] saying you greater than our father
[1:47:58] Abraham?
[1:48:00] He dead. But look at what Jesus said.
[1:48:02] Your father Abraham
[1:48:05] rejoice to see my day.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Look at this. and he saw it.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Not only that, and was glad. Now, the
[1:48:16] question was, you think you greater than
[1:48:19] our father Abraham and he's dead?
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Jesus answer, Amen. Here
[1:48:25] in verse 56, your father Abraham rejoice
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; to see my day and he saw it and and was
[1:48:34] glad. Verse verse 57. Then said the Jews
[1:48:37] unto him, "Thou art not 50 years old,
[1:48:39] and hast thou seen Abraham?"
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily,
[1:48:46] I say unto you,
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; before Abraham was,
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; wait a minute, we heard this language
[1:48:59] before when he talked to Moses, he used
[1:49:02] these these same words." But before
[1:49:04] Abraham was, [screaming]
[1:49:07] I am
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; They they had a good question.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; You saying that you you you you you're
[1:49:20] greater than our father Abraham and he's
[1:49:22] dead.
[1:49:24] How how did Abraham see Christ's day,
[1:49:31] rejoiced in it, and was glad?
[1:49:35] How could this happen if Abraham was
[1:49:37] dead before Jesus actually came on the
[1:49:40] scene?
[1:49:43] Well, brother Brandham tells us
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; about 12:00 noon
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; one day,
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; God comes down in a body of skin
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; with two angels
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; and they're walking there down those
[1:49:58] dusty trails
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; and they get there to Abraham's house
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; and they begin to have some fellowship
[1:50:05] and Abraham first words it says, "My
[1:50:08] Lord," even though he saw three
[1:50:09] visitors,
[1:50:11] his revelation that these three are one.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelu. Even though we might see a
[1:50:16] father, son, and the holy ghost as
[1:50:18] titles, we know those three are one.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham said, Abra Abraham say, "Oh,
[1:50:24] wait, wait a minute. Say, I got these
[1:50:25] three visitors say there's something
[1:50:26] special about." He say, "Sarah, Sarah,
[1:50:28] get something prepared really quick
[1:50:30] because we got these vision. Let's get
[1:50:31] them some food."
[1:50:33] And as they're sitting there and they're
[1:50:34] fellowshipping and everything and all of
[1:50:37] a sudden the great I am speaks to
[1:50:39] Abraham and he says now I'm going to
[1:50:41] visit you at the time of life
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; and Sarah thy wife shall have a son. He
[1:50:48] says uh now a couple days later before
[1:50:51] Abraham had laughed but this day Sarah
[1:50:54] was laughing
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; and while he was there with his back to
[1:50:59] the tent
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; he said why is Sarah laughing
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Sarah said I'm not laughing I'm not
[1:51:07] laugh said no no sir I heard you laugh I
[1:51:09] know you're laughing even though it
[1:51:10] wasn't out loud it was inside but I
[1:51:12] still heard the let me tell you
[1:51:13] something God knows when you're doubting
[1:51:15] on the inside.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; You can try to have all kind of faith on
[1:51:20] the outside, but God knows whether it's
[1:51:21] real on the inside.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; And Sarah was laughing on the inside.
[1:51:26] He says, "Why is Sarah laughing?" So
[1:51:28] when he had his back turned to the tent
[1:51:32] and he discerned what was going on
[1:51:33] inside the tent, that was when Abraham
[1:51:37] was seeing
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; that day.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; And he rejoiced when he saw it.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. and was glad.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; When Abraham saw the sign of the
[1:51:49] Messiah, just like the woman at the well
[1:51:52] saw the sign of Messiah, he rejoiced and
[1:51:56] was glad. [applause]
[1:51:59] Hallelujah.
[1:52:01] And there are eyewitnesses
[1:52:03] that were in Brother Brandham's meetings
[1:52:06] and they saw for themsel the sign of the
[1:52:09] Messiah. They rejoice
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; and they've been glad ever since.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could speak words like
[1:52:22] that
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; because of what happened there when when
[1:52:24] when when when when the when the secrets
[1:52:27] of the heart
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; were revealed.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. Even
[1:52:32] today, the secrets of the heart are
[1:52:35] still being revealed. There is many a
[1:52:37] times you walk into this church and a
[1:52:40] minister begins to preach and he's
[1:52:42] preaching what just happened in your car
[1:52:43] on the way to the church.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; That ain't nothing but the sign of the
[1:52:47] Messiah.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; the same yesterday,
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; today and forever.
[1:52:58] When we have experiences like this
[1:53:02] where we see God moving in certain ways
[1:53:04] and we know that this was this this had
[1:53:06] to be God. Didn't nobody tell the
[1:53:08] preacher that this had to be God.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; There was a question that came in Jesus
[1:53:13] day that comes again today. And in Jesus
[1:53:16] day, Jesus asked the question,
[1:53:19] who do men
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; say that I am? Now, we can tell what
[1:53:26] everybody else is saying. We can just
[1:53:28] pull up a website and tell them what men
[1:53:30] are saying about the message. Who do men
[1:53:34] say
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; that I, the son of man, am? Some say,
[1:53:39] "You Elias, Jeremiah, one of the
[1:53:41] prophets, these people confused. They
[1:53:43] don't know who you are."
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; And Jesus got tired of the just the the
[1:53:47] the the the little conversation they're
[1:53:49] having. He says, "Okay, I'm gonna change
[1:53:51] the the subject."
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Who
[1:53:55] Do you say
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; that I, the son of man, am
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; now? It goes from a group question
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; to an individual question. And now you
[1:54:10] got to be able to give an individual
[1:54:12] answer.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; And only one that spoke up and said
[1:54:15] anything was Peter. Peter said, "Well, I
[1:54:18] don't know what they got to say,
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; but what I got to say, thou art
[1:54:22] [screaming]
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; the the the the son of God."
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "Blessed are your eyes, Peter,
[1:54:30] cuz flesh and blood did not reveal this
[1:54:31] to you, but my father in heaven did." He
[1:54:32] says, "Upon this rock, I'll build my
[1:54:34] church." You need to know who he is.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Not who he was,
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Not who he will be.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; But who he is.
[1:54:46] Peter had a present tense revelation and
[1:54:49] you're going to need the same exact
[1:54:51] thing. I need a present tense
[1:54:52] revelation. We thank God for the
[1:54:54] prophet.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; But he's not here anymore.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; So, who do you say?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; I Christ am. [clears throat]
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; And let me ask another question.
[1:55:08] Where is
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; the I am?
[1:55:15] Okay, let's keep going.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; I want you to go with me on a testimony
[1:55:23] brother Brandham gave gave. And I didn't
[1:55:25] even realize this until right now. He
[1:55:28] preached a message in Shreport,
[1:55:30] Louisiana.
[1:55:33] And the message is titled testimony. And
[1:55:35] he shares this. He says,
[1:55:40] "I went back up to the top of the
[1:55:42] mountain again,
[1:55:45] finding my way through the blowing,
[1:55:46] twisting trees." So, this is the
[1:55:47] Colorado storm. It says, "I sat down,
[1:55:51] took my gun,
[1:55:54] and keep the scope from getting up like
[1:55:57] that, a bear run in that that kind of
[1:55:59] time." So, I put my scope back under my
[1:56:02] shirt like this and sat down a moment. I
[1:56:05] thought, what am I doing sitting here
[1:56:08] now? You know, I I want to I just want
[1:56:10] to say just just my study of brother
[1:56:13] Brandon in in his message. There were
[1:56:15] certain things that he shared in his
[1:56:17] ministry that um knowing him, he
[1:56:20] probably feel more comfortable sharing
[1:56:22] it in Jeffersonville
[1:56:24] than sharing it outside because people
[1:56:26] might not believe what he's actually
[1:56:29] saying. They probably really think this
[1:56:30] man is really off his rocker. So there's
[1:56:32] only places that he felt very
[1:56:34] comfortable going back to Jeffersonville
[1:56:35] and sharing certain things. But when he
[1:56:37] would come here to Streetport, it seemed
[1:56:38] like he had a different type of
[1:56:40] relationship.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; So he's sharing this
[1:56:44] how I mean most people sitting there in
[1:56:47] the service and would hear this man
[1:56:48] share something like they're like where
[1:56:49] where did he get that from? Because they
[1:56:50] never heard testimonies like this from
[1:56:52] nobody else.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; But look at this. Look at what he says.
[1:56:54] He says,
[1:56:57] "By time I get to the bottom of the
[1:56:59] hill, that storm getting more ter
[1:57:01] terrific all the time, closing in, you
[1:57:03] can see very far ahead of you." He says,
[1:57:07] "You don't have to believe this, but
[1:57:10] this is true."
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Now, he's saying that in Shreport, you
[1:57:14] don't have to believe this, but this is
[1:57:16] true. He say a voice spoke to me.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Now, look at what the voice said. I am
[1:57:24] the Lord God.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Same thing he told Abram in in Genesis.
[1:57:29] I am in a Colorado storm, God comes and
[1:57:32] says, I am the Lord God. I've created
[1:57:35] the heavens and the earth. Nature
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; obeys me.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; And then I sit there a little bit,
[1:57:44] jerked off my hat and the voice uh
[1:57:46] somewhere I couldn't uh voice somewhere
[1:57:47] I couldn't see it. Only thing I could
[1:57:49] hear it was around them trees somewhere.
[1:57:50] I thought usually you see that that
[1:57:52] light that all of you know about usually
[1:57:54] it's there but I looked everywhere and I
[1:57:57] couldn't see the light. I said where are
[1:58:01] you oh God my creator I looked around I
[1:58:05] couldn't hear it no more hear his voice
[1:58:07] I waited a few minutes he said I am
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; the Lord God that had you speak to those
[1:58:17] squirrels into existence what So, it
[1:58:21] wasn't brother Brandham doing it. It was
[1:58:22] the I am inside of the prophet.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; I am the one that told you to speak the
[1:58:30] squirrels into existence.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; We got to find the great I am. Brother
[1:58:35] Brandham's not here no more.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; So, the I am couldn't have died when the
[1:58:39] prophet died.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; If he was living in Genesis, he's still
[1:58:44] living today.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; But, but we need to understand if we can
[1:58:48] trace him, Amen. And through the
[1:58:50] scripture, we can see even in the
[1:58:51] prophet's ministry, he identifies
[1:58:53] himself as the I am.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that told you to do that.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that gave you the
[1:59:01] inspiration to speak that.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm the one that fulfilled it when
[1:59:05] you spoke it.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; the Lord God that had you speak those
[1:59:12] squirrels into existence. And all he
[1:59:16] says, "And all of you know about that.
[1:59:17] And so help me with this Bible before me
[1:59:20] on this Thanksgiving morning." If that
[1:59:22] isn't true, God strike God may strike me
[1:59:24] dead at that platform. Now see, it's
[1:59:26] true. He just he is just still as much
[1:59:28] creator a God.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; A God that could provide a ram for
[1:59:32] Abraham
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; can provide. He's still Jehovah Gyra.
[1:59:36] The Lord can provide. And we know even
[1:59:38] when brother Brandon was was telling the
[1:59:40] story in Sister Hadley Wright's house
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; was talking about those squirrels being
[1:59:44] created and everything and and she said,
[1:59:46] "My God, that's nothing but the truth."
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; He says, "The same God that provided a
[1:59:51] ram for Abraham is the same God that
[1:59:53] provided squirrels for me."
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that God still lives
[1:59:56] today. And he says, "I am the God that
[1:59:59] actually inspired you to do that."
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; That God is still inspiring today.
[2:00:04] I'm telling you, I'm I'm here to tell
[2:00:05] you, he did not die
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; when the prophet died.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Remember this. I started out by reading
[2:00:16] a quote out of Hebrews chapter 5 and 6.
[2:00:18] I'm going to repeat it again because
[2:00:20] we're going to find where the great I am
[2:00:22] is.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, Brother Timothy came to me.
[2:00:28] He says, "Uh, brother Jack, did they get
[2:00:30] your title?" I said, uh, I said,
[2:00:33] "Brother, I'mma preach on the great I
[2:00:34] am." He says, "Oh, you're going to
[2:00:36] preach about yourself."
[2:00:44] I say, "Only a preacher could say that."
[2:00:49] And And I could I couldn't say anymore.
[2:00:50] I say, "Only a preacher can say that."
[2:00:52] But but I'm going to set you up for
[2:00:55] another quote that I'mma read
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; because I I have a revelation of where
[2:00:59] the great I am is.
[2:01:04] Uh
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; oh. Y'all want to know where he is?
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; The first quote I read out of out of out
[2:01:10] of Hebrews chapter 5 says, "So in the
[2:01:12] old laws, a man could be a redeemer."
[2:01:15] First, he had to be kin folks.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; The great book of Ruth, we we went
[2:01:19] through here some time ago and how that
[2:01:21] God being spirit was made kin folks with
[2:01:22] us by becoming one of us
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; in order to redeem us and give us
[2:01:28] eternal life. And this is what he says.
[2:01:30] He had to become us.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; That we through grace
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; might become as [clears throat] he
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; in the church age book there's a
[2:01:46] statement that is being made
[2:01:49] in the message in the the section the
[2:01:51] revelation of Jesus Christ. Brother
[2:01:52] Random says this, that's why no man can
[2:01:56] ever come along and say the holy man is
[2:01:59] a pope
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; or the holy man is a bishop or a priest.
[2:02:03] The holy man is Christ.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in us.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; He says, "How dare
[2:02:12] the hierarchy declare the ley has no
[2:02:15] word to say.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Each one has something to say. Each has
[2:02:21] a work. Each has a ministry. The Holy
[2:02:25] Ghost came at Pentecost and separated
[2:02:27] himself on each.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; He says that it might be fulfilled
[2:02:32] whereof Christ said at that day,
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; ye shall know that I am in my father and
[2:02:42] ye in me.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:46] and I [screaming]
[2:02:48] in you.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; I think we found where the great I am is
[2:02:54] the great I am is laying inside of you
[2:02:57] Holy Ghost fil believers.
[2:02:59] [applause]
[2:03:01] Brother, we not talking about I was a
[2:03:04] [screaming] I will be. But the great I
[2:03:06] am is here.
[2:03:09] [applause]
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; If you didn't believe it, I'll read the
[2:03:14] rest of the quote.
[2:03:16] Brother Brandham says this, "The great I
[2:03:19] am,
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; the almighty God
[2:03:24] has come
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; as spirit
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; to fill his true church."
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Brother, they weren't saying that in my
[2:03:38] Baptist church. They was not telling me
[2:03:40] things like that in my Baptist church.
[2:03:42] The great I am. I Yes, I know about what
[2:03:45] he said in in the Old Testament, but
[2:03:46] where is he today?
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; That great I am is living in me,
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; living in you.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; We don't have to go far to find him.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; You know, even brother Random made a
[2:04:00] statement. He says, you know, uh you're
[2:04:02] not praying to God some
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; up in the universe somewhere.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; The God that lives in you, you're
[2:04:09] praying to him.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:12] Oh my. That's why he has communion and
[2:04:15] fellowship with you.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; It's a personal relationship with the
[2:04:18] Lord Jesus Christ. This is not something
[2:04:19] far-fetched. This is personal, up close
[2:04:22] and personal.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; The great I am, the almighty God has
[2:04:28] come as spirit to fill his true church.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; He has a right to move anywhere he wants
[2:04:34] to.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; And upon anybody he wants to. We don't
[2:04:39] make any holy men amongst us. But the
[2:04:41] whole true congregation of the Lord is
[2:04:44] holy because of the presence of the Holy
[2:04:47] Spirit. It is he, the Holy Spirit that
[2:04:50] is holy, not the congregation
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; of itself.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; I think it's just time for us to
[2:04:58] recognize
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; who we are.
[2:05:02] You know, Jesus had a conversation one
[2:05:04] time
[2:05:06] with a centurion soldier.
[2:05:09] He the centurion had sent uh some of the
[2:05:12] men of Israel to go say, "Please, I
[2:05:14] don't think I should go and ask Jesus. I
[2:05:15] don't think he going to come to me, but
[2:05:16] I got a servant here that that needs
[2:05:18] healing, and I I I don't know what to
[2:05:20] do. Would y'all go and ask Jesus if you
[2:05:22] would come and pray for him?" So, they
[2:05:23] did. They went. They got Jesus. And
[2:05:25] Jesus on the way to the house and the
[2:05:27] man, the centurion said, "Oh my, I
[2:05:29] didn't think he would come." But since
[2:05:30] he is, he says, "Let me meet him before
[2:05:32] he gets into the house." He stopped out
[2:05:33] there and he says, "Now, um, Jesus, I'm
[2:05:37] not worthy
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; that you you should come underneath my
[2:05:40] roof." He says, he says this, see, this
[2:05:42] is why I said you got to recognize who
[2:05:44] you are because this man knew who he
[2:05:45] was.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; This man said, uh, I am
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; a man
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; of authority.
[2:05:57] It says, "And I can tell a soldier, come
[2:06:02] and he comes."
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; And I can tell another one, "Go." And he
[2:06:06] goes and you know when I speak and I
[2:06:08] say, "Come," the soldier don't say,
[2:06:10] "Give me a minute. I I'll be there in a
[2:06:12] few seconds. Just I got something to do.
[2:06:14] I'll be there. When I when I get ready,
[2:06:16] I'll be." That soldier don't talk that
[2:06:18] way to me. I tell one to go here. Uh I
[2:06:20] ain't I ain't ready. I got to go home
[2:06:22] first and talk to my wife and get my
[2:06:23] kids to bed. No, I said go. It could be
[2:06:26] midnight and if I say go, the man goes.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; He realized that he was a man of
[2:06:32] authority. He says, "And if you would
[2:06:33] speak the word, you don't even have to
[2:06:36] go underneath my roof, but if you would
[2:06:37] speak the word, I know my servant will
[2:06:40] be made whole." Jesus said, "I have not
[2:06:42] found faith like this anywhere in
[2:06:45] Israel."
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It was because the man recognized
[2:06:51] who he was.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; And what we got to do is come to a re re
[2:06:55] realization of who we are in Christ.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't have to allow the devil
[2:07:00] just to run rough shot.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes sometimes you see that devil
[2:07:05] just going a little bit too far. I heard
[2:07:07] a brother uh preaching a few weeks ago.
[2:07:09] He said somehow his car just started
[2:07:12] acting up. He couldn't understand what
[2:07:13] was going on and he couldn't get the car
[2:07:15] to the shop and I mean just all kind of
[2:07:18] things going on. So he said, "Wait a
[2:07:19] minute."
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "No, this is the devil. This is
[2:07:22] too far, car. You're going to have to
[2:07:24] start working in the name of Jesus."
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; You know what happened? The car start
[2:07:28] working in the name of Jesus.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Look, that may seem simple, but sometime
[2:07:34] God wants us to use simple faith
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; to see him move in our simple needs.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to recognize who we
[2:07:44] are. Can I give you a few scriptures
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; just to cement who you are?
[2:07:49] Psalm
[2:07:51] 71
[2:07:52] and 7
[2:07:55] David said this and I believe he speaks
[2:07:57] about all of us. I am as a wanderer
[2:08:01] unto many and especially if you in a if
[2:08:04] you one of the ones you might be the
[2:08:06] only one in your your family that
[2:08:08] believes the message, you are a wanderer
[2:08:10] to them.
[2:08:12] I am a wonder unto many. When you go to
[2:08:15] work, you're the only one believer. When
[2:08:16] you're in school, you're the only
[2:08:17] believer. I am a wonder unto many.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; But thou
[2:08:23] art my strong refuge.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Psalms 139 and 14. This is for my young
[2:08:29] people. Hallelujah. You need to anytime
[2:08:33] you're going through and you're having
[2:08:34] low self-esteem, read this scripture.
[2:08:36] Psalms 139:14. I will praise thee
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; for I am
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; fearfully
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; and wonderfully made. I I like to say it
[2:08:49] like this. God don't make junk.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; And I ain't no junk.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; I was handcrafted by God. Fearfully and
[2:08:59] wonderfully made.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Marvelous are thy works. When you look
[2:09:04] in the mirror, young sister, marvelous
[2:09:06] are his works, with no makeup. Marvelous
[2:09:09] are his works,
[2:09:12] [applause]
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; and that my soul knoweth right well.
[2:09:17] Romans 1:16. Here's another one. You got
[2:09:20] to know who you are.
[2:09:22] For I am not ashamed
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; of the gospel of Christ. For it is the
[2:09:29] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[2:09:31] that believeth to the Jew first and also
[2:09:34] to the Greek.
[2:09:37] Philippians 4:11.
[2:09:39] Not that I speak in respect of want, for
[2:09:43] I have learned and whatsoever state I am
[2:09:49] there with to be content. Because you
[2:09:52] know when whatever state I'm in,
[2:09:54] whatever I am, I know he's there with
[2:09:56] me. so I can be content.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; There's a
[2:10:03] um
[2:10:06] uh a few statements that that are in the
[2:10:08] um in the church age book that I want to
[2:10:11] just read to you really quick and then
[2:10:13] one last scripture I want to read.
[2:10:17] One of the statements out of church age
[2:10:19] book as well as out of scripture. 2
[2:10:21] Corinthians 5:20 says that I am the very
[2:10:24] righteousness of God. Another
[2:10:28] statement in church age's book says I I
[2:10:30] am loosed by the blood of Jesus and no
[2:10:34] one can lay any charge against me.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Here's another one in the church's book.
[2:10:39] I am an heir
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; to all God's power and his omnipotence.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; So therefore I need not to fear. Another
[2:10:48] statement he says, "I may not have the
[2:10:51] material sources resources to fall back
[2:10:53] on, but I am rich
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; in spite of it all. My security lies in
[2:10:58] Christ who is my shield and my exceeding
[2:11:01] great reward."
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I will walk with him and
[2:11:06] white because I am worthy."
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; The devil tells you that you're not
[2:11:11] worthy, but you can tell the devil.
[2:11:12] Jesus said, "I'm going to walk with him
[2:11:14] right and white because I am
[2:11:17] worthy.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Here's another one. I am the very elect
[2:11:21] of God
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; and I cannot be deceived.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Here's one other out of the church age
[2:11:30] book is I am a king
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; and a priest
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; and I have dominion over sin,
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; the world,
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; over my flesh,
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; and I got dominion over the devil.
[2:11:44] Hallelujah.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; I am a king and priest.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; One other that we find here in
[2:11:50] scripture,
[2:11:53] Paul tells us who we are. Romans 8 verse
[2:11:57] 28. One of the most uh read scriptures
[2:12:02] in Christendom. Amen.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; And we know
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; that all things
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; work together
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; for good to them that love God,
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to
[2:12:15] his purpose.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; For whom he did forno,
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; he also did predestinate
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; to be conformed to the image of his son
[2:12:26] that he might be the firstborn among
[2:12:28] many. Brethren, I'll invite the
[2:12:29] musicians to come. I'm winding down
[2:12:31] right here.
[2:12:33] It goes on to say this. Moreover, whom
[2:12:35] he did predestinate,
[2:12:37] then he also called. And whom he called,
[2:12:40] then he also justified. And whom he
[2:12:42] justified, them he also glorified.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; What shall we say then to these things?
[2:12:48] If God be for us,
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; who can be against us?
[2:12:58] He that spare not his own son but
[2:13:00] delivered him up for us all. How shall
[2:13:02] he not with him also freely give us all
[2:13:05] things?
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; He says who shall lay any
[2:13:09] anything to the charge of God's like it
[2:13:11] is God that justifieth.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ
[2:13:15] that died. Yay rather that is risen
[2:13:17] again who is even at the right hand of
[2:13:19] God who also maketh intercession for us.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Verse 35. Who shall separate us from the
[2:13:25] love of Christ?
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Shall tribulation
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; or distress
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; or persecution
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; or famine
[2:13:39] or nakedness or peril or sword or
[2:13:44] websites.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; As it is written, for thy sake we're
[2:13:53] killed all the day long. And we are
[2:13:54] counted as sheep for the slaughter. I
[2:13:57] like Paul's response. He says, "Nay,
[2:14:00] nay, nay, nay, nay." That means no, no.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; In all these things,
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; we are
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; more than conquerors
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; through him that loved us.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; I told you, you need to know who you are
[2:14:20] because Paul recognized it and he wrote
[2:14:22] it in scripture.
[2:14:24] For I am
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; this is me. I am
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; because the great I am is living in me.
[2:14:31] I am persuaded
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; that neither death
[2:14:39] nor life,
[2:14:42] nor angels,
[2:14:45] nor principalities,
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; nor powers,
[2:14:50] nor things present,
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; nor things to come. That mean nothing.
[2:14:54] Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Brother, this is when you're anchored in
[2:15:00] God.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; nor height,
[2:15:08] nor depth,
[2:15:11] nor any other creature
[2:15:13] shall be able to separate us from the
[2:15:17] love of God.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Which is in Christ Jesus [music]
[2:15:22] our Lord.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus made you a promise.
[2:15:30] Matthew 18:20, [music] he told you, he
[2:15:32] says,
[2:15:34] "I am with you always,
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; even unto the end of the world."
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Not only is he with us,
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; but because of the presence of the Holy
[2:15:45] Ghost,
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; he's also in us.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; So, no, no, no. We're not looking for a
[2:15:52] God of I will be.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. or a God of I was.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; But we serve a God of I am.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; He's a present tense God.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; And he's currently involved in all of
[2:16:05] your circumstances.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Church, we don't have to be afraid.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; We know where he is.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; He's in us.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; He's in us.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Not me. Only you. every born again
[2:16:24] believer, he's in you.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Let's have a word of prayer.
[2:16:32] Father,
[2:16:36] we are grateful
[2:16:41] for understanding and revelation.
[2:16:45] It's the thing that makes the
[2:16:47] difference. when we can have a
[2:16:49] revelation, Father, there is nothing
[2:16:51] that the enemy can do that would shake
[2:16:54] us, that would harm us,
[2:16:58] that would hinder us, oh God.
[2:17:01] Lord, I I I I just appreciate, [music]
[2:17:05] Lord, how your prophet just kind of
[2:17:07] allows us to be able to walk through
[2:17:08] scripture and [music] and to see, Lord,
[2:17:10] that this this great God
[2:17:15] that Moses had a conversation with, this
[2:17:17] great God that led [music] the children
[2:17:19] of Israel, this great God that spoke to
[2:17:23] Paul on the road to Damascus, this great
[2:17:26] God that took a picture with his
[2:17:28] prophet, this great God has chosen to
[2:17:32] dwell in the hearts of believers.
[2:17:37] Help us to [music] realize Lord who we
[2:17:38] are in you.
[2:17:42] Lord as we will leave this place and God
[2:17:45] just going on and just thinking about
[2:17:46] what has been spoken to us. Trials will
[2:17:49] come, tribulations will come, distresses
[2:17:51] will come. But God, we know that we
[2:17:53] can't be defeated in the midst of all
[2:17:55] that [music] because the great I am is
[2:17:57] on the inside. I pray your blessings
[2:17:59] Lord upon the pastor, this family, the
[2:18:04] ministry, Lord, all the believers that
[2:18:07] assemble here in this in mind mend.
[2:18:09] Father, we just pray God that you just
[2:18:10] continue [music] to use them as a
[2:18:12] lighthouse in this part of the world.
[2:18:14] And Lord, we know this ministry not only
[2:18:16] touches just this neighborhood, but
[2:18:18] Father, it touches all over the world.
[2:18:21] God, we ask that you continue to use
[2:18:22] them and lead them and guide them. Thank
[2:18:24] you for what they do, Lord, for you.
[2:18:26] Thank you, Father, for all that you've
[2:18:28] done for them. And we know there's so
[2:18:29] much more that you have in store.
[2:18:32] Father, we carefully give you all the
[2:18:33] honor,
[2:18:35] all the glory,
[2:18:37] and all the praise.
[2:18:40] It's in Jesus name we pray.
[2:18:42] Amen. Amen. Can we give the Lord Jesus a
[2:18:46] hand of praise? [applause]
[2:18:47] [music]
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; Um,
[2:19:04] they asked me just to sing [music] a a
[2:19:07] song or two and I'll do that. But before

[2:19:24] and and and one of the biggest things
[2:19:26] that I feel like I can do as a minister
[2:19:27] [music]
[2:19:28] is to get the people to recognize who
[2:19:30] they are in Christ. That that's like the
[2:19:33] most important thing. Often times we
[2:19:36] live so far beneath our privileges
[2:19:37] because we don't know who we are.
[2:19:41] You all remember the story of the the
[2:19:43] the the young the lady she had a brother
[2:19:45] Brandham told about this lady that um
[2:19:49] she thought she was poor
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; and uh her son was overseas and the
[2:19:54] [music] son was sending her these pretty
[2:19:56] pictures
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; and uh and as she was looking at the
[2:20:00] pictures and you know and and got sick
[2:20:02] and and everything and somebody come by
[2:20:04] the house and say you know we [music] do
[2:20:06] you have any anybody that can take care
[2:20:07] of you anybody can say yeah I got a son
[2:20:09] but I ain't want bother me overseas and
[2:20:11] all he does send me these pretty
[2:20:13] pictures. That's all he does. And and I
[2:20:15] I just didn't want to bother him. Man
[2:20:17] said, "Well, let me look at the pictures
[2:20:18] that he sent you." I said, "Okay, I'll
[2:20:19] let I'll show them." And went and didn't
[2:20:22] realize the pictures was hidden in the
[2:20:23] Bible. Pulled the pictures out the
[2:20:26] Bible. And the man looked at him and
[2:20:27] said, "This not pictures. These are
[2:20:29] money orders. Lady, you are wealthy."
[2:20:33] And didn't even realize it.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; We just need to recognize Yes. Amen.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Who we are.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Let's do our God. Amen. Hallelujah.
