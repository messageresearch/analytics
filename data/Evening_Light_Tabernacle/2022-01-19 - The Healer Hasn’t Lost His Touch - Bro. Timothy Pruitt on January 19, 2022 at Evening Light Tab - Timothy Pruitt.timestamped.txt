[41:29] you at home and the services here
[41:31] amen god is good
[41:34] all the time amen
[41:36] luke chapter 9 and verse 12 and when the
[41:38] day began to wear away
[41:40] then came the twelve and said unto him
[41:43] send the multitude away that they may go
[41:45] into the towns and country round about
[41:48] and lodge and get victims
[41:50] for we are here in a desert place
[41:53] but he said unto them give ye them to
[41:56] eat and they said we have no more but
[41:58] five loaves and two fish
[42:01] except we should go and buy meat for all
[42:03] these people
[42:04] for they were about five thousand men
[42:06] and he said to his disciples
[42:08] make them sit down by fifties in a
[42:10] company and they did so and made them
[42:13] all sit down and when he took the five
[42:14] loaves and two fish
[42:16] and looking up to heaven he blessed them
[42:19] and break
[42:20] and gave to the disciples to set before
[42:22] the multitude
[42:24] and they did eat and were all filled and
[42:27] there was taken up fragments that
[42:29] remained to them 12
[42:31] baskets
[42:32] amen we let you be seated
[42:39] amen actually was headed a different
[42:41] direction
[42:42] to
[42:43] about the middle part of today and just
[42:46] hit a little something that just shot
[42:47] through me and so we just felt to move
[42:50] this in this way so i'd like to speak to
[42:52] you this evening on the healer hasn't
[42:55] lost his touch
[42:57] amen the healer hasn't lost his touch i
[43:00] want to look at this scripture for a
[43:01] moment and it's a very
[43:03] amazing scripture and a very amazing
[43:05] event that took place
[43:07] as god would or jesus would take the uh
[43:11] few loaves of bread and a few fish
[43:14] and he would he would begin to multiply
[43:17] them and i thought it was very
[43:18] interesting because it's actually as you
[43:20] read about it it's when the day began to
[43:22] wear away it was in the evening time
[43:25] and it was uh you know in a place and a
[43:28] place that they couldn't go gather
[43:29] something on their own as we read as in
[43:31] the desert place
[43:33] and you know and the disciples their
[43:35] thought was to send the multitude away
[43:37] and for them to go provide for
[43:39] themselves but that wasn't jesus thought
[43:41] he he had another thing in mind he
[43:44] wanted to provide for them he wanted to
[43:46] do something for them that they could
[43:48] not do for themselves and we can say
[43:50] what a miracle that took place as he
[43:52] would
[43:53] it was actually the very very creation
[43:56] that was taking place
[43:58] maybe they didn't catch it right at
[43:59] first and didn't see it as he would take
[44:01] small loaves and and a few fish and
[44:04] break them and multiply them and feed 5
[44:07] 000 that were counted as men there's
[44:09] really no telling how many people were
[44:11] actually there
[44:13] and you know in doing so as we know he
[44:15] bypassed the planning he bypassed the
[44:18] growing he bypassed the harvest he
[44:20] bypassed the kneading he bypassed the
[44:23] baking he broke off a piece and another
[44:26] took its place
[44:27] and he had enough for every person who
[44:29] wanted it he had it enough for every
[44:31] person who desired it he had enough
[44:34] because he is more than enough he was
[44:36] shown once again that he's jehovah jireh
[44:39] and he's the same way today with his
[44:41] healing with his forgiveness with his
[44:43] mercy with his grace and with his love
[44:45] whosoever desires it whoever whosoever
[44:48] wants it he's got it and not only does
[44:50] he have it he has more than enough
[44:53] and i'd like to declare again tonight
[44:55] that he is still in the miracle working

[1:00:32] cleopas and his buddy
[1:00:35] on the way to emmaus luke chapter 4 and
[1:00:36] verse 13.
[1:00:40] so two of them went the same day to a
[1:00:42] village called emmaus
[1:00:45] it wasn't a dark time
[1:00:47] it's what seemed like a dark time but it
[1:00:49] was one of the greatest times
[1:00:52] and this is where i was going to go this
[1:00:53] evening was
[1:00:54] out of darkness and into light
[1:00:56] during chaos
[1:01:01] here they were seemed like in chaos
[1:01:04] everything around them had changed very
[1:01:06] quickly and very rapidly the one they
[1:01:07] loved and been following for years had
[1:01:09] now been put on a cross and put in a
[1:01:11] grave
[1:01:12] but what they fail to realize that
[1:01:14] morning they're walking and they're in
[1:01:15] the molly groves he's risen
[1:01:19] and they talked together of all these
[1:01:21] things which had happened and it came to
[1:01:22] pass that while they communed together
[1:01:25] in reason jesus himself drew near
[1:01:27] and went with him
[1:01:29] but their eyes were holding
[1:01:31] they should they should not know him
[1:01:34] and he said unto them what manner of
[1:01:35] communication are these that you have
[1:01:37] one to another as you walk in are sad
[1:01:40] and the one of them whose name was
[1:01:42] cleopas answered
[1:01:43] and said unto him art thou only a
[1:01:45] stranger in jerusalem
[1:01:47] has thou not known the things which are
[1:01:48] come to pass in these days
[1:01:50] and he said unto them what things
[1:01:53] there's a concern in jesus of nazareth
[1:01:55] with the prophet matty indeed and word
[1:01:56] before god and all the people and how
[1:01:58] the chief priests and all the rulers
[1:02:00] delivered him to be condemned to the
[1:02:01] death and crucified him but we trusted
[1:02:03] he that that had been he which would
[1:02:05] have redeemed israel
[1:02:07] besides all this to this day the third
[1:02:09] day since these things were done
[1:02:11] but now certain women also of our
[1:02:12] company made us astonished
[1:02:14] which were early at the sepulcher and
[1:02:16] they found out his body and said they
[1:02:18] seen visions of angels which said that
[1:02:20] he's alive
[1:02:21] and certain of them which was with us
[1:02:23] went to the sepulcher and found it even
[1:02:24] so as the women said
[1:02:26] but him they saw not
[1:02:28] he said oh fools and slow of heart to
[1:02:30] believe all the prophets have spoken
[1:02:32] ought not christ to have suffered these
[1:02:34] things he entered in his glory beginning
[1:02:35] at moses all the prophets expounded them
[1:02:37] all the scriptures things concerning
[1:02:39] himself and they drew nine to the
[1:02:40] village where they went he made as
[1:02:42] though he would go further
[1:02:44] but they constrained him
[1:02:48] abide with us for us toward the evening
[1:02:49] the day is far spent
[1:02:52] notice again
[1:02:53] toward the evening time
[1:02:56] where are we at the evening time
[1:02:59] the day is far spent
[1:03:01] and he went into terry with him and it
[1:03:03] came to pass he said it meet with them
[1:03:04] and took bread and blessed it and break
[1:03:07] and gave it to them and their eyes were
[1:03:09] open and they knew him
[1:03:11] oh the master hadn't lost his touch
[1:03:17] what do you think happened it wasn't
[1:03:19] just the way he tore a piece of bread in
[1:03:20] the sense of taking a a piece of bread
[1:03:22] and just tearing it in half and here's
[1:03:24] your piece and here you know he took a
[1:03:26] piece of bread and he tore it off and
[1:03:28] another one took his place he took up
[1:03:33] he hadn't lost his touch
[1:03:35] he was showing you in this day that i'm
[1:03:37] the same jesus that was before i went to
[1:03:40] the cross i've risen from the grave i'm
[1:03:42] still the same and i haven't lost my
[1:03:45] touch so if i pulled off a piece of
[1:03:47] bread and gave it to one you can have a
[1:03:49] piece of bread if you want it
[1:03:51] you can have healing if you want it you
[1:03:53] can have deliverance if you want it you
[1:03:55] i got more than enough
[1:03:57] and listen he done it in our generation
[1:03:59] for for years to a prophet's ministry he
[1:04:01] tore a piece of bread after a piece of
[1:04:03] bread after a piece of bread and it
[1:04:05] showed healing after healing deliverance
[1:04:07] after liver listen he ain't run out of
[1:04:09] bread because he said i am the bread of
[1:04:12] life
[1:04:14] hallelujah he is still there creating
[1:04:17] and moving and changing and healing and
[1:04:20] delivering and doing all the things he
[1:04:22] did before because he hasn't lost his
[1:04:24] touch

[1:04:27] piece of bread for you
[1:04:28] you might be down in the dumps tonight
[1:04:30] but there's a piece of bread for you you
[1:04:33] might be depressed and all down and
[1:04:35] wondering how it's all going to happen
[1:04:37] how it's all going taking place and
[1:04:38] meanwhile there's a resurrected jesus
[1:04:40] christ walking in your midst
[1:04:44] i say tonight may he do what he did

[1:05:00] one beautiful thought of christianity
[1:05:03] even today
[1:05:04] as we speak of this marvelous gospel
[1:05:07] we know we don't have to take a hearsay
[1:05:10] or a historical thing
[1:05:12] because it's been proven
[1:05:14] that jesus christ lives and reigns
[1:05:18] and is raised from the dead and is alive
[1:05:21] forevermore
[1:05:24] what do you think happened in our midst

[1:06:28] whatever it is still the devil
[1:06:31] gets on a body and tries to anoint it
[1:06:33] but god came by with a piece of bread
[1:06:35] that lord and said here's your peace
[1:06:37] others have been suffering with covenant
[1:06:38] and god came by that morning said here's

[1:06:52] twinkling of an eye
[1:06:54] we know about his touch
[1:06:58] he hadn't lost it we we know but the
[1:07:00] story of those two women it's just too
[1:07:01] powerful to pass up those two women in
[1:07:03] the neighborhood that morning amen got

[1:07:07] thought man i'm hungry and but i don't

[1:07:12] and knowing if she ate some of that
[1:07:13] stuff what it would do to her but she
[1:07:15] said that morning she just felt a cool
[1:07:17] feeling
[1:07:20] how many's ever felt that
[1:07:22] brother ron remembers that feeling when

[1:07:53] over me and i would feel that all of
[1:07:55] that action and i said it's over
[1:07:58] why because i know his touch
[1:08:01] these women were there in that
[1:08:03] neighborhood that morning amen have we
[1:08:05] just seen the same thing happen in our
[1:08:06] day

[1:08:27] louisiana handing out bread
[1:08:30] oh my god amen this is what brother
[1:08:32] battle said he said what happened when
[1:08:34] that woman received her healing and she
[1:08:36] was able to eat what she wants she goes
[1:08:37] down to the neighbor amen she had that
[1:08:39] border on her and she got up that
[1:08:41] morning and it fell off
[1:08:43] and she was screaming and hollering she
[1:08:44] the woman thought well this woman
[1:08:46] something doesn't happen she runs in
[1:08:47] there and she's shaking out the sheets
[1:08:49] and said it was here but now it's gone
[1:08:51] it was here but now it's gone
[1:08:54] oh hallelujah i pray this evening we can
[1:08:57] wave that old white flag of victory this
[1:08:59] evening said it was here but now it's
[1:09:01] gone

[1:09:05] hasn't run out of touch he hasn't run
[1:09:08] out of breath he hasn't run out of meat
[1:09:10] he hasn't run out of the goodness of god
[1:09:13] he hasn't run out of victory and peace
[1:09:15] and harmony and joy or whatever you have
[1:09:18] need of
[1:09:21] he's showing the same mercy
[1:09:26] he said 2000 years ago
[1:09:28] he's just as present as he was then
[1:09:33] walking down the shores of galilee with
[1:09:34] the disciples he's doing the same things
[1:09:38] he's performing the same miracles
[1:09:40] he's showing the same mercy
[1:09:43] he's preaching the same gospel
[1:09:45] he's not dead he's alive forevermore
[1:09:48] he said how happy our hearts ought to be
[1:09:51] it ought to make christians today to
[1:09:53] know this is not some curious philosophy
[1:09:55] we're understanding but this is the
[1:09:58] power of the resurrection of the lord
[1:10:00] jesus christ
[1:10:02] hallelujah as a great point saint paul
[1:10:04] said he said he said that being the only
[1:10:06] educated one among the disciples he said
[1:10:08] but i don't come to you with excellency
[1:10:11] a word or the speech of some man and
[1:10:12] tyson wisdom but i come amen in the
[1:10:15] power and demonstration of the holy
[1:10:17] ghost that your faith will not rest in
[1:10:19] men but it will rest in god
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:25] he said how we love that to know the
[1:10:27] same thing that paul preached in the
[1:10:29] days after the resurrection of christ is
[1:10:32] the same thing tonight and it can be
[1:10:34] proven here again his infallible proof
[1:10:37] that jesus christ is alive

[1:11:12] about his wife he says as you say so it

[1:11:16] and he said before the doctor's hand
[1:11:18] touches her
[1:11:21] that tumor will be gone
[1:11:24] he said she's in the place here tonight
[1:11:25] as a witness
[1:11:27] that she could hardly go into the
[1:11:28] doctor's office and get on her gown and
[1:11:30] hardly get up on the table and lay it
[1:11:32] over there with a sheath and as soon as

[1:12:02] amen to touch and remove the pain
[1:12:07] amen a doctor comes and he cuts this and
[1:12:09] he cuts that and it takes months of

[1:12:14] that's his touch
[1:12:16] hallelujah amen we saw it as we said
[1:12:18] sister atlanta it was a moment of touch
[1:12:21] it wasn't months and months and months
[1:12:23] and months of agonizing after that when
[1:12:26] he touched her in that moment it was
[1:12:28] over with
[1:12:32] and it doesn't matter how dark it is it
[1:12:35] doesn't matter how close you get to a
[1:12:36] knife
[1:12:38] it doesn't matter how close the devil
[1:12:41] gets to you
[1:12:43] i'm not trying to make the doctor the
[1:12:44] devil would understand me the devil's
[1:12:46] trying to also touch you
[1:12:48] he's also trying to grab a hold of you
[1:12:50] but before he can get to you god already

[1:12:57] devil tried to do some of you he tried
[1:12:59] to destroy your life he tried to bring
[1:13:01] every kind of thing upon you that you
[1:13:03] could never be anything it was
[1:13:05] impossible to do anything for god
[1:13:06] anymore because your life was all
[1:13:08] scarred up but before he could do all of
[1:13:10] that god touched you
[1:13:13] and you're here tonight sitting on these
[1:13:15] pews why not because your own ideas and
[1:13:18] your own walter here because of the
[1:13:20] master's touch
[1:13:22] [Applause]
[1:13:27] what a marvelous day
[1:13:29] it must have been
[1:13:32] when cleopas and his friend was walking
[1:13:34] down the street
[1:13:36] but they were brokenhearted
[1:13:39] bible said they were
[1:13:41] you know they
[1:13:42] were down they were
[1:13:44] trying to figure it all out
[1:13:47] he says you got to remember you're not
[1:13:49] ever going to figure it all out
[1:13:51] so many people try to know the doctrines
[1:13:53] of the church and they think that's life
[1:13:56] all those things are good but to know
[1:13:57] him
[1:13:58] he said that's where you got to get to
[1:14:00] that life
[1:14:01] it's good to know your books it's good
[1:14:03] to know your doctrines
[1:14:05] but all of that is on the sideline
[1:14:07] but to know him is life
[1:14:09] for he that because he said for he that
[1:14:11] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:14:12] has sent me hath everlasting life and
[1:14:15] shall never come into condemnation but
[1:14:17] it's passed from death and life jesus
[1:14:19] made those statements
[1:14:20] and those words that were made
[1:14:23] were that were after there were no those
[1:14:24] words will remain after there's no more
[1:14:26] stars no more moon then words will still
[1:14:29] be in effect and just as powerful as the
[1:14:31] day he spoke them because his words
[1:14:33] cannot fail
[1:14:37] so they're here they're walking along
[1:14:40] man

[1:14:53] deaths
[1:14:54] this past couple of years and i've heard
[1:14:55] in all my life and

[1:14:59] come by now
[1:15:03] and meanwhile he's been walking with the
[1:15:05] church
[1:15:06] he's been there the whole time

[1:15:12] you what's been going on all down to the
[1:15:14] dark ages and all for the ministering of

[1:17:13] terrible it is and how this was losing
[1:17:15] that one that one's lost this one this
[1:17:16] one's died over here and that one's died
[1:17:18] over here and this one don't remind that

[1:17:40] few more devils to defeat we got a few
[1:17:43] more services to have and stomp a mud
[1:17:45] hole in the devil
[1:17:47] we got a few more times in this human
[1:17:49] flesh amen to wear that devil out when
[1:17:51] he tries to come and says there ain't no
[1:17:53] more god and we'll rise up and we'll say
[1:17:55] yes there is i know he's still the same
[1:17:57] yesterday today we got a few more times
[1:17:59] when young people will get drunk on the
[1:18:01] holy ghost we got a few more times when
[1:18:03] the presence of god will fall in here
[1:18:05] it'll get so thick that the preacher
[1:18:06] can't even preach no more we got a few
[1:18:08] more times of god moving in our midst
[1:18:12] we're looking at the darkness and start
[1:18:14] looking at the lights
[1:18:20] he starts explaining to them what's all
[1:18:21] been happening why it's all taking place
[1:18:23] and what's going on and why we're still
[1:18:25] here because there must be a few more
[1:18:27] seeds
[1:18:32] and some of them might be your children
[1:18:38] i'll say it even more direct some of
[1:18:40] them are your children
[1:18:45] if i was you i just grabbed that one
[1:18:48] say unto the righteous it shall be well
[1:18:53] say unto the righteous your children
[1:18:55] your offspring shall be there
[1:18:59] say unto the righteous the promises unto
[1:19:01] you and your children
[1:19:08] god works all things together for the
[1:19:09] good
[1:19:11] he had to bring them to that talking
[1:19:12] about jesus
[1:19:17] how could you have
[1:19:18] listen to this brother the prophet of
[1:19:19] god he said how could you ever have
[1:19:21] confidence in your loved one being
[1:19:23] raised from the dead if only you just
[1:19:25] had enoch that had been translated
[1:19:28] or elijah that went home in a chariot if
[1:19:30] only had them we'd be miserable but this
[1:19:31] man died
[1:19:33] he died till the sun knew he was dead
[1:19:35] the moon and the stars knew his dead he
[1:19:38] died into everything in the earth and
[1:19:39] heaven knew he was dead that he might
[1:19:41] die the death of every mortal and that
[1:19:43] ever lived the worst death of man could
[1:19:46] ever die but because he died
[1:19:48] we can now live
[1:19:50] he died he was mistreated he came in the
[1:19:52] way by the way and the came into the
[1:19:54] world by the way of a barn no place to
[1:19:56] lay his head when he came over he was
[1:19:57] rejected by the people he didn't even
[1:19:59] have a place to be buried the earth
[1:20:01] refused him the heaven wouldn't have him
[1:20:03] because he's coming as a sinner
[1:20:07] not his own sin but my sins
[1:20:11] he was bearing the sins of the world
[1:20:13] upon him so he was rejected in heaven
[1:20:15] and earth didn't want him they had to
[1:20:17] lift him up between the heavens and the
[1:20:18] earth and let him die outside of heaven
[1:20:21] and outside of earth
[1:20:24] what a savior
[1:20:27] how could you turn that down such a
[1:20:29] person as that for modern theology or
[1:20:32] for the persons of the people when you
[1:20:34] know
[1:20:35] when you know that you've got to stand
[1:20:37] in his presence in the day of judgment
[1:20:39] to give account for your life god won't
[1:20:41] hold you responsible for being a sinner
[1:20:43] god will hold you responsible for
[1:20:45] rejecting the way out of it
[1:20:48] wow
[1:20:50] you can't help being a sinner you was
[1:20:52] born that way but god has given you a
[1:20:55] choice
[1:20:59] your nature's a sinner you can't help it
[1:21:01] but jesus made a way out
[1:21:04] and he ain't lost his touch
[1:21:07] hallelujah
[1:21:10] oh my
[1:21:13] mary no doubt to think you know one day
[1:21:15] i was packing some water to a whale an
[1:21:18] angel visited me and
[1:21:20] spoke to me
[1:21:21] out of a big light
[1:21:23] said that holy thing which is born of
[1:21:24] thee shall be called the son of god how
[1:21:27] could god ever permit his own child
[1:21:29] hanging there suffering bleeding
[1:21:31] twisting and dying how could it be they
[1:21:33] were looking at any time for him to come
[1:21:35] from the cross
[1:21:37] but if they didn't realize if he had
[1:21:39] came off that cross we would be left
[1:21:41] sinners today
[1:21:44] he said they paid him the greatest
[1:21:45] compliment pharisees did when they
[1:21:47] crucified they paid him the greatest
[1:21:49] compliment he said he saved others but
[1:21:51] he can't save himself they didn't
[1:21:53] realize that if he saved himself he
[1:21:55] wouldn't be able to save others
[1:21:57] he would have lost his touch
[1:21:59] amen but he had to give himself an order
[1:22:02] to save others it was a compliment to
[1:22:04] him them not even know it
[1:22:11] and he said and men today
[1:22:14] in modern theology try to make him
[1:22:16] preach in a social gospel just a
[1:22:18] philosopher
[1:22:19] or just a good man or a fine scholar
[1:22:23] or two lords
[1:22:25] just a teacher
[1:22:26] he was more than that
[1:22:28] he was god himself made flesh among us
[1:22:31] he was divine his blood did not come
[1:22:34] from any mortal man it came from the
[1:22:35] created power of jehovah god
[1:22:38] his father he was divine he proved it
[1:22:40] when he broke the seals of death and he
[1:22:42] rose on the third day
[1:22:44] but how many of the disciples would
[1:22:45] dishearten when all this was taking
[1:22:47] place peter went back fishing
[1:22:51] as did others
[1:22:56] how little do they know
[1:22:58] on this beautiful first easter morning
[1:23:01] that jesus christ was alive
[1:23:03] and among his people
[1:23:06] they thought he was dead
[1:23:09] and he said and so do they think so
[1:23:11] today
[1:23:14] many people
[1:23:15] who really love jesus fail to understand
[1:23:18] he's right with us
[1:23:20] living resurrected here among us
[1:23:23] they teach it as a historical affair
[1:23:26] or it's a history
[1:23:27] the bible is not just history it's
[1:23:30] prophecy
[1:23:32] it's being fulfilled even today he's not
[1:23:34] dead he's risen amen there's many fine
[1:23:38] christian people this morning belong to
[1:23:39] fine churches who don't realize that
[1:23:41] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:23:44] and forever and is alive among us
[1:23:48] who is us the bride of jesus christ
[1:23:51] amen i'm gonna say among us
[1:23:54] today with the same powers
[1:23:56] say it same powers
[1:23:58] same principles same acts that he did
[1:24:01] here on earth
[1:24:03] little does people know that
[1:24:05] and they were just wondering
[1:24:07] but while they're thinking about it
[1:24:10] he appeared
[1:24:12] and he comes out
[1:24:14] and he said that's the way he usually
[1:24:16] comes
[1:24:18] is when you're thinking about him
[1:24:22] i'll just drop this in because i think
[1:24:24] it's just real beautiful he said that's
[1:24:26] you when you usually find your greatest
[1:24:28] blessing you housewives
[1:24:30] children going to school and you're out
[1:24:32] by yourself washing dishes running to
[1:24:34] sweep on the floor or something when
[1:24:35] you're eating your lunch maybe by
[1:24:37] yourself reading the bible on the side
[1:24:39] somewhere when you're on your road going
[1:24:41] home in the car you're
[1:24:42] meditating he said then that's when he
[1:24:45] comes by
[1:24:48] with the trouble
[1:24:49] we're thinking about too many other
[1:24:51] things
[1:24:53] we're thinking about how bad it is
[1:24:55] thinking about how difficult things are
[1:24:58] how dark it is
[1:25:00] quit thinking about that
[1:25:02] think on him
[1:25:04] he hasn't lost his touch
[1:25:09] they went wrong along the road that
[1:25:10] morning
[1:25:12] they had seen him mocked
[1:25:14] made fun of
[1:25:16] we're seeing it in our day they're
[1:25:17] mocking they're making fun
[1:25:20] saying it ain't so he's not coming back
[1:25:24] mocking it to such a christianity to
[1:25:26] such a point to where you can't even
[1:25:27] hardly speak the name of jesus christ or
[1:25:29] even god in the school anymore
[1:25:33] but just seeing just seeing a a
[1:25:36] a news clip on fox shared with me amen
[1:25:39] by the ledels of how they're now
[1:25:40] starting satanist clubs in our schools
[1:25:44] how is that possible
[1:25:48] and the man there's crying out about
[1:25:50] it's like how can you do that when you
[1:25:51] can't even quote the old testament in
[1:25:53] the new testament
[1:25:57] but darkness is coming
[1:25:58] it's here and it's getting worse
[1:26:04] but that doesn't change his promises
[1:26:06] that doesn't change who he is
[1:26:09] that doesn't change what he does
[1:26:11] that doesn't change that he's
[1:26:13] that he won't can't fulfill his word or
[1:26:15] are not able anymore he's still the same
[1:26:18] yesterday today and forever
[1:26:20] he hasn't lost his touch he hasn't
[1:26:23] changed who he is in the day that we're
[1:26:25] living in
[1:26:29] the holy ghost is still the same
[1:26:33] i don't care what the critics say they
[1:26:34] can say the holy ghost ain't the same no
[1:26:36] more that he's lost his touch but the
[1:26:38] holy ghost has not lost his touch
[1:26:41] the same holy ghost that changed peter
[1:26:43] is the same holy ghost that changes you
[1:26:47] it'll change you from a backbiter and a
[1:26:50] slanderer and a and denying jesus christ
[1:26:53] it'll change you from that to a man of
[1:26:56] boldness that'll stand there and witness
[1:26:58] the glory of god
[1:27:00] and give your life for this gospel
[1:27:04] it hasn't lost his touch
[1:27:08] how many witnesses we got of that the
[1:27:10] holy ghost ain't lost his touch
[1:27:12] he still gives the same overcoming power
[1:27:15] he still comes down and changes nature
[1:27:18] and changes hearts and changes
[1:27:20] he still saves young
[1:27:30] people let me get on down real quick
[1:27:35] come down to the place where there's
[1:27:36] about to pass by
[1:27:41] and he said he does that sometimes
[1:27:44] he said he'll come right into service
[1:27:46] and he'll make as if he's going to pass
[1:27:48] by
[1:27:50] he said dad with you with the heart
[1:27:52] trouble mother you with cancer that's
[1:27:54] going to die

[1:28:01] won't it happen i've asked him
[1:28:03] but maybe
[1:28:04] he's just made like he's going to go on
[1:28:06] by
[1:28:08] he said that's what he'd done to cleopas
[1:28:09] in them
[1:28:10] but he knew all the time
[1:28:13] he was going in there
[1:28:16] oh hallelujah
[1:28:18] oh glory to god sometimes he makes like
