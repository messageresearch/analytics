Look now, our chains are on the floor. Look up. We're not hindered anymore. Look around. He's already won the war. Look up. Look up. Fear is defeated. No hold on me. I live in the power of my Savior's victory. So look now. Our chains are on the floor. Look up. We're not hindered anymore. Look around. You already won the war. Look up. Look up. Look down. Our chains are on the floor. Look up. We're not hindered anymore. Look around. He's already won the war. Look up. of God. Freedom is contagious. Come and join us in his praise. Let the name of Jesus is for freedom. We are saved. Freedom is contagious. Come and join us in his praise. Let the name of Jesus is for freedom. We are saved. Freedom is contagious. Come and join us in his praise. Let the name of Jesus is for freedom. We are saved. Freedom is contagious. Come and join us in his grace. The name of Jesus is for freedom. We are safe. Look now. Our chains are on the floor above. We're not hindered anymore. Look around. He's already won the war. Look up. Look up. Look now. Our chains are on the floor. Look up. We're not hindered anymore. Look around. He's already one more. Look up. Look up. Look around. He's already one more. Look up. Look up. Look up. [Applause]
