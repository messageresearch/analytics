[music] Lord, we come to you this evening thankful, Father, that you've taken a wretched sinner [music] that we were, Lord, brought that gift of love that we sang about earlier, Lord. Lord, not just in a physical manger, but come into the manger [music] of our hearts. Lord, that you've done such a wonderful work for us. We thank you, Father, for the opportunity we have [music] to come together again this evening, worship your holy name, Lord, Lord, and to hear from your throne tonight, [music] Lord, the things that you've laid on brother Aaron's heart. I pray that you'll continue to move upon him as [music] he prepares in the study in the back, Lord. That you'll, Lord, move through the ministry of the word tonight. Move through the songs that are sung, Father. Lord, anoint each one of us that we may be vessels, Lord, [music] that you would, Lord, be pleased to dwell in again. Just wash us, we pray, with your sweet presence. Lord, I ask you be with each one of the [music and singing] needs tonight. Our brother Matt Spencer, Lord, recovering from his surgery.

[music] And just as the Emmas row, Lord, that you'd appear to them and you'd walk with them. They would compel you to stay. And Lord, [music] we ask you to stay here tonight, woo over this congregation in a very special way. We pray. We love you and [music] we thank you for all you've done. Jesus Christ's name we pray. Hallelujah. Amen. I [singing] just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the blood line [singing and music] because I'm covered by [music] his blood. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; You may win and you may [music and singing] fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. [music and singing] Remember, you can't cross the bloodline. [singing] The brothers could take [music] up the offering tonight. say, "Even though [singing] my spirit is blown and it seems [music] I can hardly go, [singing] but still I see [music] victory. [music] Many times [singing] I'm walking by faith. I can't [music] see what lies before [singing] me, but still I see victory. [music and singing] [music and singing] And I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't [singing and music] cross the bloodline because I'm [music and singing] covered by his blood. [music] And you may stare and you [singing] may find you're [music] going to lose this battle tonight. Remember, [singing] you can't cross the blood. Sometimes [music and singing] our battles get hard. Sometimes our battles get hard and it seems [singing and music] we're fighting along. But remember standing [music and singing] on the rock. So Satan, [music and singing] if I were you, I'd turn around and [music] give up to you. Cuz I believe that [music and singing] you're bound to lose. And I [music] just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline [music and singing] because I'm covered by his [music and singing] blood. And you may stay and you [music and singing] may fight. You're going to lose this battle tonight. Remember [singing] [music] can't cross the blood. Amen. You can be seated for just a moment. Keep praying. Hallelujah. [music] And I'm expecting [singing] anticipating [music] a move of [singing] God. The move of [singing and music] God. I'm [music] expecting [singing] anticipating a [music] move of God. [singing] A move of God. [music] Yes. I'm expecting anticipating [music and singing] the move of God. [singing] A move of God, [music] not expecting, [music] anticipating [singing] a move. Oh [music] God. [singing] Oh, here I am to [singing] worship. [music] Here I am to bow and here [singing and music] I am to sing. Oh that you're my God. [singing] [music] You're all together love me [music] all together. Oh, [singing] you're all together one.

Oh, here [music] I am to [singing] say that you're my [music] God [singing] and you're all together love all together. [music and singing] Yes, you're all together one. Amen. Can [music] we sing it to him one more time? Say, here I am. Here [singing] I am to worship. [music] Here I am to bow. Oh, [singing] here I am to say [music] that you're my God in [singing] your all together love. Oh, all together. [music] All together [singing] wonderful to [music] me. You are [singing] beautiful beyond description, Lord. You're tongless [singing and music] for work, [music] too wonderful [singing] for comprehension, [music] like nothing [singing] ever seen or heard. And who can [singing] grasp your infinite [music] wisdom? [singing] And who can fathom [music] the depths [singing] of your love? [music] And you are beautiful beyond description. Oh [singing] majesty [music] enthroned above [singing] [music] and I stand I stand in [singing] all of you. [music] Oh, I stand I stand in all [singing] of you [music] and holy God [music] to [singing] all praisees to I stand [singing] in all [music] of you for I stand [singing] say I stand [music] I stand [singing] in all of you. Oh, [singing] I stand. I stand [music] in all of you, holy God. [music] Who through who all praise is [singing] you. I [music] stand in awe of you [singing] and [music] you are beautiful [singing] beyond description. Yeah. God [singing] crushed you for [music] my sin. And [music and singing] in agony and deep affliction you were [singing] cut off that I [music] might enter in. Who can grasp such tender [music and singing] compassion? And who can fathom [music and singing] a mercy so free? [music and singing] And you are beautiful beyond [singing and music] description. Oh lamb of [singing and music] God. Yes. Who died for me? [music] And I stand. I [music] stand [singing] in all of you. Oh, [singing] I stand. [music] I stand in all of you. Holy [singing] God to whom all praise [music and singing] is due. I stand [music] in all [singing] you and I believe [singing] you are who you say you are [music] and you [singing] do what you say you'll do. [music] You'll come [singing] through. You are always [music] faithful. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; I believe that you [music] already made [singing] a way. So I'm running through parted ways [music and singing] straight to you. You are Oh. Can we all stand and sing it now? Say, [music and singing] "I believe. I believe you [singing] are who you [music] say you are. And you do what you say you'll do. You'll come through. You [music and singing] are always there. I believe [music] that you've [singing] already made a way. I'm running through parted ways [music and singing] straight to you. You are Oh, can we sing it one more time? [singing] Tell them tonight. [music] Say, I believe. I believe that you [singing] are who [music] you say you are. If you'll do [singing] what you say you'll [music] do, you'll come [singing] through. You are [music] always faithful. I believe you've [singing] already made [music] a way. So [singing] I'm running through parted ways [music] straight to you. You are always [music] [singing] faithful. Amen. And do [music] you believe tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Without faith, it's impossible to please [music] God. Amen. So tonight, we're to believe. We're called [music] to believe. Amen. No matter what circumstances you face, no matter what situations [music] face you tonight, we're believers. Amen. Let's just pray together. Father Lord, we come before [music] you tonight on this Wednesday night, Lord. Just asking you to come and move and speak, Lord. [music] Lord, speak to every need and every heart. I just pray, Lord, as we go through your word and Lord, take a journey through these scriptures, Lord, that something [music] would would stand out and and speak and Lord, reach somebody's heart tonight in the situation that they may be in. [music] Lord, I just pray we'd be encouraged tonight to press the battle, to take another step, [music] Lord. Lord, to go further with you tonight, Father, as you've called us, Lord. You've called us on a faith journey, Lord. And we're not stopping along the way, Lord, but we're going all the way, Lord, to fulfillment. [music] Lord, I just pray you'll just move me out of the way now, Lord. That you'll speak, Lord, [music] words of life, Lord, and that you'll bless your word as we read it throughout this evening. In Jesus name we [music] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. It's good to be in the house of God, isn't it? Amen. If you have your Bibles and you'd [music] turn with me tonight to Genesis 12 and verse one, we're going to speak to you tonight on the thought the reward of Melzdc. The reward of Melzdc tells us here in Genesis 12:1 says, "Now the Lord had said unto Abram, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee. And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. And I like I'm just going to read the beginning of verse four. So Abram departed. Amen. I pray that the Lord will add his blessings as we have our seats. What we see here is is is the call of Abraham and and the promise given to Abraham. And and immediately we see how Abraham responds and and I feel like that so much can be learned from these three words. So Abram departed. Amen. Because because instantly we see him begin to operate in faith. There's not a whole lot of questions of well well how are you going to take care of me on this journey and what's going to happen along the way? But it just says Abram departed. Amen. and and he he obeys the command of God without question and without knowing where it is exactly he's going. You know, the Lord just said, "You're going to a place that I'll show you." And he and he begins this journey and he leaves his father and he leaves security. He leaves familiarity. And and I think we can learn from this because whenever God speaks to us and when we know that it's God speaking to us, it behooves us to do what it is God's saying. Amen. We don't have to get him to explain everything to us just perfectly. If God says move, we should move. If if God says go, we we should go. Amen. Whether it makes sense to us or not. It doesn't really matter if it if it makes sense to us or whether we can see the benefit of this move. Th those things don't matter. I'm I'm sure in the moment it didn't really make sense to Abraham and and I'm sure it really didn't make sense to Sarah when he went in there and just said, "Pack up your house. You know, we're moving." And she's like, "Oh, do we get a a bigger house and a nicer neighborhood?" And he's like, "No, we're we're just going." Well, where are we going? We're just going. &gt;&gt; Just pack up your things. I'm sure these things didn't make sense to them. Amen. I mean, this was the first time that God had spoken to Abraham. He hasn't unfolded himself to him yet. He He hasn't revealed much about his nature and he doesn't give him a specific plan. He just gives him a a command and he gives him a promise. Amen. And and I believe tonight that we've been given we've been given commands and we've been given promises. But we're we're blessed to live in a time where God has completely unfolded himself to us and and we see the plan of God and and we know how God's working. We can see how God's work. There's so much available to us that our faith should be at a place that when God speaks, we don't have to question. When God speaks, we know that he has our our our um our best interest at heart. He's going to work all things out according to our good. And we just need to be willing to follow his leadership. Amen. And and God gives Abraham a command. And he gives him a promise. And he says, "Get thee out, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee." And and Abraham responds by leaving. And he starts this journey. And it's in a journey that that'll entail hardship. It's a journey that's going to entail many trials and and uncertainty. And and on this journey, there's family disputes. And on this journey, there's famines. And on this journey, there's human mistakes. And there's failures. There's even lies on this journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm thankful tonight that the uncertainty and the trials and the lies and even the failures are not what his journey is remembered for. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this journey leads to Abraham being known as the father of the faith. It's not a journey of failure, but it's a journey of victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's faith in the promise resulting in the in the manifestation of the promise. Listen, I want TO TELL YOU TONIGHT, wherever you're at, no matter how many failures you've had, this isn't a journey of failure. It's it's not a journey about how you got left in Leody and how how you missed the rapture. That's not going to be how this story is told. Amen. It's a journey that results in the manifestation of the promise in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans would SAY THAT THAT ABRAM CALLED those things which were not as though they were. He against hope believed in hope. And it tells us here in in verse 20, it says, "HE STAGGERED NOT AT THE promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in the faith, giving glory to God, and being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. And therefore, it was imputed unto him &gt;&gt; for righteousness." &gt;&gt; Impute. What? What? What does this word mean? Impute. It means to credit or reckon something to someone's account. &gt;&gt; Amen. THINK ABOUT THAT. GOD CREDITED Abraham's faith and his promise as right standing between him and God. &gt;&gt; He credited him with right standing between him and God because of his faith in the promise. And he declared HIM RIGHTEOUS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS PERFECT &gt;&gt; but because of his faith in the promise. &gt;&gt; Simply put, Abraham believed God. Amen. Do we have any believers here tonight? People that SAY, "I BELIEVE GOD TONIGHT no matter what." Listen, we look at IT AND WE KNOW Abraham's failures. &gt;&gt; We know his missteps. WE SEE THE FLAWED HUMANITY. BUT WE GET OVER HERE IN the New Testament and that isn't THE STORY THAT'S TOLD AT ALL. &gt;&gt; Faith is the story. Strength is the story. Righteous is the verdict. Amen. AND IT'S NOT JUST ABRAHAM, BUT SARAH ALSO. SHE LAUGHED AT THE PROMISE RIGHT IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF GOD. BUT YOU GET OVER IN HEBREWS 11 AND IT SAYS THAT THROUGH FAITH ALSO SARAH receives strength because she judged him faithful. &gt;&gt; And that, you know, and that's great for Abraham and that's great for Sarah. That's great for FOR THE DIFFERENT BIBLE CHARACTERS DOWN THROUGH THE THROUGH THE AGES. But I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU, DON'T STOP READING RIGHT THERE ON VERSE 22. DON'T STOP THERE, BUT READ ON WHERE IT SAYS, "NOW IT WAS NOT WRITTEN FOR HIS SAKE ALONE THAT IT WAS IMPUTED TO HIM, BUT FOR US ALSO TO WHOM IT SHALL BE IMPUTED, IF WE BELIEVE ON him that raised up the Lord Jesus from THE DEAD." &gt;&gt; CHURCH, YOU'VE DONE THINGS WRONG. I DID THINGS WRONG. You've sinned. You failed. YOU'VE COME UP SHORT. AND SATAN JUMPS UP AND DOWN AND POINTS AND HOLLERS AT EVERY LITTLE MISTAKE YOU MAKE. OH, LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE NOW. LOOK AT THE THOUGHT THEY'RE HAVING NOW. LOOK AT HOW HE ACTED TODAY. Every little stumble and every misstep and every past sin, HE'S THE ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN. &gt;&gt; It says he's the accuser of the brethren both day and night. &gt;&gt; In other words, IT NEVER STOPS. &gt;&gt; WHY THE CONSTANT mind battles, brother Aaron? Why the torment in my mind? Because the he's the accuser of the brethren. HE DOESN'T TAKE A BREAK, BUT HE ACCUSES YOU CONSTANTLY. HE STANDS THERE AND accuses and accuses and accuses. BUT ONCE THOSE SINS HAVE BEEN DROPPED IN THE BLEACH OF THE BLOOD, ONCE THEY'VE BEEN PUT UNDER THE BLOOD, THE DEVIL CAN HOWL ALL HE WANTS TO. HE CAN SHOUT ALL HE WANTS TO. HE CAN ACCUSE YOU ALL HE WANT TO. BUT GOD DOES NOT SEE IT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD DOESN'T SEE YOUR FAILURES. HE DOESN'T SEE YOUR FLAWS. HE DOESN'T REMEMBER IT. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU'RE FORGIVEN TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE FORGIVEN TONIGHT. AND WHEN THE STORY OF YOUR LIFE IS RECOUNTED, IT WON'T BE FULL OF ACCUSATIONS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT WON'T BE FULL OF TALKING ABOUT YOUR SINS AND TELLING ABOUT YOUR RUNNING. AND IT WON'T MENTION YOUR BACKSLIDING. IT WON'T MENTION THE STRUGGLES THAT YOU HAD TODAY. BUT IT'LL SAY THEY OVERCAME HIM IN LEODOSA BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB AND BY THE WORD OF THE TESTIMONY. THEY WERE STRONG IN THE FAITH. GIVING GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'LL SAY, "HE CONQUERED SATAN'S EDEN." IT'LL SAY, "SHE STOOD IN THE DARKEST OF TIME. HE BELIEVED MY MESSAGE. HE RECEIVED MY SALVATION. HE ACCEPTED MY TOKEN." THAT'S HOW YOUR STORY will be told in the ages to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then we'll stand clothed in his righteousness, holy with his holiness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, that excites me &gt;&gt; that my story is going to be told through the blood. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Aren't you glad that every thought you had today isn't going to be recounted. &gt;&gt; Every word, every thought over the last month, how you acted in certain situations, but it's going to be told through the blood. That you staggered not. That you stood in Leodysia. That you accepted the word for your hour, THAT YOU HAD THE TOKEN IN YOUR LIFE. THAT'S HOW YOUR STORY IS TOLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. prophet of God says, "And that's the way with a real Christian." &gt;&gt; Did you know a real Christian doesn't even ha even any sin at all imputed to him? &gt;&gt; David said, "Blessed is the man who God will not impute sin to." When you're washed in the blood of the lamb, not by make believe, &gt;&gt; but really the blood of the lamb, God does not impute to you anything that's done. &gt;&gt; Notice he didn't say you don't do anything. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's powerful, church. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS HE DOESN'T IMPUTE TO YOU ANYTHING THAT'S DONE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDER THE BLOOD AND HE DOESN'T SEE IT. &gt;&gt; OH, BUT I FAILED TODAY. AND THE DEVIL SAID AND THE DEVIL SAID AND THE DEVIL SAID AND HE PROBABLY TELLING YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID, BUT HE DOESN'T IMPUTE IT TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING AND YOU'RE FAILING AND YOU'RE FAILING, QUIT WALLERING IN YOUR FAILURES. PUT IT UNDER THE BLOOD AND PRESS ON INTO FORGIVENESS TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I love that the way the scripture says, "But for us also &gt;&gt; because we too have been called." &gt;&gt; Amen. We too, many of us have have have departed from family, have left father and mother and separated from friends. And you're on a journey, &gt;&gt; a faith walk just like Abraham, walking after the promise, and not knowing exactly whether he went si searching for a city whose builder and maker is God. And along the way on this journey, you have so many trials. Days where you're so unsure about things, mistakes, failures, days where the journey seems overwhelming. &gt;&gt; Times where YOU WONDER AND TIMES WHEN YOU DOUBT. But if we can look into the journey of Abraham tonight and see those things are normal. THAT'S HUMANITY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S PART OF THE JOURNEY. THAT THAT'S THE BATTLE THAT WE'RE IN. BUT FOR A SEED OF ABRAHAM, IT DOESN'T STOP US. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T DERAIL US. WE WE DON'T CAMP DOWN IN OUR FAILURE AND WE WE DON'T MAKE EXCUSE FOR OUR FAILURE. BUT WE GET UP AND WE JOURNEY ON AND WE JUDGE HIM FAITHFUL TONIGHT. WE GET UP AND WE TAKE ANOTHER STEP AND WE BELIEVE GOD TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE FAILURES, BUT WE DON'T LIVE IN THAT PLACE OF FAILURE. &gt;&gt; WE GET UP, WE REPENT, WE PUT IT UNDER THE BLOOD, AND WE MARCH FORWARD TOWARDS THE PROMISE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT, SO IT WILL BE DONE. &gt;&gt; HE PROMISED HE'D NEVER LEAVE ME OR FORSAKE ME. &gt;&gt; THESE ARE PROMISES THAT WE'RE HOLDING ON TO TONIGHT. HE PROMISED THAT THOSE WHO BELIEVE WOULD BE SAVED. HE PROMISED I COULD HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. HE PROMISED THAT I COULD HAVE MY CHILDREN. And I may BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN CHAPTER 12 WHEN THE CALL WAS GIVEN AND CHAPTER 21 when he received THE PROMISED SON. I MAY BE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. AND A LOT OF STUFF HAPPENED IN THOSE CHAPTERS. &gt;&gt; I MAY BE SOMEWHERE IN CHAPTER 14 OR 15 IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE, BUT WHAT I KNOW IS I'M ON THE ROAD TO FULFILLMENT ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; We're on the road to fulfillment tonight. Yes, just going to go through a lot of these scriptures tonight and take a journey with Abraham in these scriptures. We know in chapter 13 that Abraham separates himself from Lot due to the striving amongst the herdsmen and Lot chooses the well-watered plains of Jordan. says here in chapter 13 and 11, then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan. And Lot journeyed east, and they separated themselves the one from the other. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan. Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom. Now, I'm going to keep reading, but one thing I want you to recognize some of the things we're talking about is that on the journey, you're going to go through painful situations. &gt;&gt; You're going to go through hard separations. &gt;&gt; You're going to go through things you don't understand, but there's always a reason for it &gt;&gt; in God's economy. says, "And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward. For all the land which thou seeest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever." And one thing I I don't think we pay a lot of attention to sometimes is how difficult this was for Abram to do. First of all, he knew he was supposed to do it when he left originally &gt;&gt; and he couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; And we come to this place and it's a very painful separation because Abraham loves Lot. &gt;&gt; This is no small thing. It's a very big deal for Abraham because remember Abraham is childless. Right. &gt;&gt; Abraham's brother Heron had passed away and and Lot was like his adopted son. &gt;&gt; He had taken him into his home and had taken the responsibility of caregiver, the responsibility of of watching over and keeping and guiding and giving wisdom and being a father to Lot. &gt;&gt; It was like an adopted son and he felt an obligation to watch out for him, &gt;&gt; to care for him. And in chapter 14, we see he's willing to risk his life and his entire household in ORDER TO SAVE LOT WHEN HE'S BEEN CAPTURED. &gt;&gt; HE'S WILLING TO RISK everything for Lot. &gt;&gt; And you we can see there's such a a deep love and a deep affection and the WAY THAT HE FIGHTS for Lot and and even the way he intercedes WITH GOD OVER SODOM BECAUSE OF LOT. BECAUSE IT'S A LOT THAT'S THERE AND ALL OF IT GOES BEYOND TYPICAL FAMILY DUTY AND IT ILLUSTRATES A PROFOUND AND EVEN FATHERLY love &gt;&gt; and commitment. &gt;&gt; This is the relationship THAT HE HAS WITH LOT AND WE START TO see why WHY DID GOD WANT HIM SEPARATED FROM LOT? WHY DID GOD ALLOW THE STRIFE TO COME BETWEEN THEM that separates them? And first of all, as like we've already said, WE KNOW IT'S BECAUSE he was supposed to leave all of his kindred as God told him in Genesis 12:1. And and this conflict here in chapter 13 essentially puts Abraham in a position to come into complete obedience to that command. &gt;&gt; But it's even deeper than that because what we SEE IS A FATHERLY love and affection from Abraham towards Lot. And we begin to see Lot as a potential heir. &gt;&gt; We see Lot as a potential heir, as Abram's closest kin and with the way that he feels towards Lot. And as long as Lot is there, Abram's desperation for a son is satiated. &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS LOT IS THERE, HIS DESPERATION FOR FULFILLMENT IS SATIATED BECAUSE HE FATHERS LOT AND HE LOVES LOT. IN THAT VOID AND THAT DESPERATION IS FILLED BY LOT. &gt;&gt; There has to be A SEPARATION. IT'S NOT THAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE promised son. &gt;&gt; It's not that he doesn't believe in the promised son, BUT THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISE EXACTLY HOW GOD GAVE IT MUST BECOME HIS ONLY HOPE. &gt;&gt; IT MUST BE THE ONLY WAY TO FULFILL IT. IT MUST BECOME HIS ONLY OPTION. ALL OF HIS FAITH MUST LAY IN THE PROMISE WITH NO OPTION OF FULFILLING IT A DIFFERENT WAY OTHER THAN HOW GOD HAS PROMISED IT. &gt;&gt; LOT CAN'T BE AN OPTION, &gt;&gt; BUT ONLY THE PROMISED SON. AND THIS SEPARATION MAKES IT CLEAR HERE THAT THAT THE PROMISE WOULD NOT COME THROUGH LOT AND IT WASN'T GOING TO COME THROUGH HAGAR, BUT IT WAS GOING TO COME THROUGH A SON BY ABRAHAM AND SARAH EXACTLY THE WAY GOD SAID IT WOULD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't understand why is this person being pulled out of my life? &gt;&gt; Why is this friendship being torn AWAY FROM ME? &gt;&gt; WHY ISN'T THIS JOB WORKING OUT? &gt;&gt; Why do we have TO MOVE HERE? AND WHY DO WE HAVE TO LEAVE THIS BEHIND? AND WHY IS THAT PERSON SUDDENLY COLD TOWARDS ME? WHY THIS TRIAL? WHY THIS HURT? WHY ARE ALL THINGS DOING THIS? AND THE WHOLE TIME, GOD IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE IN POSITION TO RECEIVE THE PROMISE. &gt;&gt; HE'S MAKING SURE THAT HE'S REMOVING OBSTACLES OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AND YOU MAY NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS AN OBSTACLE, BUT ABRAM'S LOT LOVE FOR LOT WAS AN OBSTACLE. &gt;&gt; Then God's JUST MOVING YOU INTO POSITION THAT YOU CAN FULLY BE BLESSED AND FULLY RECEIVE THE PROMISE THE WAY GOD INTENDED IT FOR. &gt;&gt; Making sure that you're not too comfortable where you're at. &gt;&gt; Making sure that you're NOT TOO COMFORTABLE IN YOUR CURRENT situation to be desperate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's hard to be desperate when things are going perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO BE DESPERATE WHEN EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE LINES UP PERFECT AND it's blessing after blessing after blessing after blessing. Woo! &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO BE DESPERATE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT GOD WANTS HIS PEOPLE DESPERATE FOR FULFILLMENT, DESPERATE FOR THE RETURN OF CHRIST, DESPERATE FOR THE BODY CHANGE, DESPERATE FOR THE PRODALS, DESPERATE FOR MIRACLES, DESPERATE FOR HIM TO FULFILL HIS WORD. NOT COMFORTABLE WHERE WE ARE, BUT DESPERATE TONIGHT. GOD MOVE IN OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to have a fallback plan. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to have a plan B. &gt;&gt; You're right. He wants your faith and your trust totally in him. &gt;&gt; If he has to take away earthly comfort, so be it. &gt;&gt; If he has to take away friends, so be it. Now, it's not that easy for us, and I don't say that in a way that those things don't hurt, but the way God looks at it, if this is what it takes &gt;&gt; to get you here. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, no matter how horrible it sounds, so be it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he has to end relationships, so be it. If he has to put you through tough decisions that put you in really difficult situations, &gt;&gt; so be it. Whatever it takes for you to get desperate for him, &gt;&gt; desperate to be obedient. &gt;&gt; How many times &gt;&gt; do we just roll along along and and and and those little nudges and you don't really pay attention to them and you just keep rolling and God has to bring something in your life that makes you slow down and pay attention to those little nudges. Pay attention to Lord, HAVE I MISSED YOU? H HAVE I GONE WRONG? HAVE Have I not given YOU THE THE THE TIME AND THE EFFORT THAT I SHOULD HAVE? HAVE I BEEN disobedient &gt;&gt; and put YOU IN A PLACE WHERE YOU'RE DESPERATE FOR OBEDIENCE? Desperate for him TO FULFILL HIS WORD, DESPERATE FOR GOD TO MOVE IN OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT TAKES. SO THAT WHEN YOUR STORY IS READ ON THAT DAY, IT'LL SAY HE BELIEVED GOD AND IT WAS IMPUTED UNTO HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Once the separation is complete, immediately God comes and immediately he reaffirms and even expands his covenant promises. &gt;&gt; Look in verse 14. And the Lord said unto Abram after that Lot was separated from him, &gt;&gt; lift up now thine eyes, &gt;&gt; and look from the place where thou art, northward, southward, eastward, westward, for all the land which thou seeest to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever. So there's separation here. It sets the stage for chapter 14 and and Abram's meeting with Melzdc. Lot had moved on down to Sodom and and during this time war breaks out amongst the kings and it was a conflict between two different coalitions of of kings. And I don't expect you to really be able to pronounce all these. I struggled with. I looked at them over and over a day and I was like, "Wow, I just if I say them real fast and confidently, maybe they won't know." But you had the Mesopotamian coalition, which was the four kings. They were led by Keor Lmer. Lawmer, that was it. Keto Lawmer. Yeah. King of Elum. The king of Elum is the leader and he's the primary power and and with him there's Amrifale king of Shannar, Ariotch king of Elazar, Title the king of nations and then the Jordan Valley Alliance which is five kings. It's Barra king of Sidum, Bersa king of Gomorra, Shannab king of Adma, Shim Shimber king of Zebulun and then the king of Bala. And these five kings had been subject to the king of Elum. And they had paid him tribute for 12 years. But on the 13th year, these five kings rebelled. And they said they wouldn't pay tribute anymore. And so and so the king of Elum gets him an alliance of these four kings and and they invade the valley. And all this you can read in chapter 14. And the king of Elum and his allies march in to crush the rebellion and to reestablish their dominance. And there's quite a few smaller battles and skirmishes, but the main battle is known as the battle of the veil of Sadine. And the five kings of the valley are no match for the invaders. And the king of Elum and his allies crush the valley kings. And the victorious armies then plunder Sodom and they plunder Gomorra. And they they take all their goods. They take all their food. They take all the people captive. And among those captives is Lot. Yes. &gt;&gt; And it says that one escaped from captivity and comes to Abraham. &gt;&gt; And it says, "And there came one that had escaped and told a and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt in the plain of Mamry, the Amorite, brother of Echel, brother of Anor. And these were confederate with Abram. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, 318, and pursued them unto Dan. And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smokeote them, and pursued them unto Hoba, which is on the left hand of Damascus. AND HE BROUGHT BACK ALL THE GOODS, and also brought AGAIN HIS BROTHER LOT, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. And I love how in the scripture through different Bible characters, we can see we can see the spirit of Christ manifested. &gt;&gt; And we learn here that God IS A GOD THAT PURSUES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I if you've BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE TONIGHT, IF YOUR LOVED ONES BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY kings there are. It doesn't matter how many demons THAT HAVE TAKEN HOLD. IT DOESN'T MATTER THE CONDITION OF YOUR LOVED ONE TONIGHT. ODDS DON'T MATTER. ABRAHAM HAD 300 men and he was going against four kings and FOUR ARMIES THAT HAD JUST CONQUERED FIVE KINGS AND FIVE ARMIES. BUT GOD WAS ON HIS SIDE AND ABRAHAM PURSUED AFTER IT TONIGHT. AND IT SHOWED HIS NATURE. I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GO. I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOUR CHILDREN GO. &gt;&gt; OH MY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE DEVILS JUST WON A BATTLE IN YOUR HOME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE DEVILS JUST WON A BATTLE IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. THE ENEMY HAD JUST BURNED ZIGLAG. THAT WAS A VICTORY for the enemy and they TOOK DAVID'S WIFE. THEY HAD COME AND THEY HAD CONQUERED ALL THESE KINGS AND AND IT WAS A VICTORY FOR THEM. BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER. THEY JUST WON A VICTORY. THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE SLAUGHTERED. HALLELUJAH. ABRAHAM GOES AFTER HIS BROTHER LOT AND HE SLAUGHTERS THE KING THERE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, maybe you've been down. Maybe the family's in turmoil. Maybe your children are in disarray. MAYBE YOUR JOYY'S BEEN STOLEN AND PEACE HAS BEEN STOLEN. YOUR HEALTH HAS BEEN STOLEN. GOD WANTS US TO PURSUE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; David went to HIM AND SAID, "SHALL I PURSUE?" AND GOD ANSWERED BACK, "PURSUE." &gt;&gt; It's the nature of God. &gt;&gt; He wants us to pursue the promise. &gt;&gt; He wants us to put the word ON OUR LIPS AND TAKE BACK OUR PROMISES. TAKE BACK OUR FAMILY. GO AFTER OUR CHILDREN TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; OUR GOD PURSUES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOUR CHILDREN'S OUT THERE TONIGHT, DON'T GIVE UP. GOD'S PURSUE. SEND MERCY AND GRACE ON THEIR TRAIL TONIGHT. MERCY AND GRACE WILL OVERTAKE THEM. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SITUATION, THIS SITUATION DIDN'T LOOK GOOD EITHER. &gt;&gt; But our God pursues. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what happened in the beginning &gt;&gt; when news reached glory that man had failed. and fear spread. There was Christ who said, "I will pursue." &gt;&gt; He came and won everything back for man. He pursued the enemy all the way to hell to restore back what was lost. I found this quote and I loved it so much. Brother Brandon says, "What a beautiful picture of Christ." He's talking about Abram who heard from heaven that we WERE LOST AND HE CAME AND PURSUED THE ENEMY ALL THE WAY TO HELL AND CAPTURED the lost souls and brought us back and restored us to everything that we had before the fall. We backsliders. &gt;&gt; We that was born to be sons of God that's perverted into the sons OF THE DEVIL WENT AFTER THE THINGS OF THE WORLD DONE WRONG. RUN GREEDILY LIKE LOT DID. SOLD OUT OUR BIRTHRIGHTS TO GO AFTER THE THINGS OF the world. CHRIST CAME DOWN. &gt;&gt; OH, THOUGH FALLEN, GOD KNOWING IN THE BEGINNING WHO WOULD BE SAVED AND WHO WOULD NOT. THEREFORE, COME DOWN AND PURSUE THE ENEMY THROUGH LIFE, THROUGH DEATH, THROUGH PARADISE, INTO HELL, ALL THE WAY FROM GLORY TO HELL AND TOOK OVER THE POWERS OF HELL AND THE KEYS AWAY FROM THE DEVIL AND ROSE AGAIN AND RESTORED TO MANKIND THAT HE CAN BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD AGAIN. THERE IS NO LINK. THERE [cheering] IS NO LINK THAT HE WILL STOP AT TO REDEEM YOUR SOUL. [applause] &gt;&gt; HE CAME FROM GLORY ALL THE WAY TO HELL. &gt;&gt; OH, there's nothing too hard for our God. &gt;&gt; There's nothing too extreme. THERE'S NOTHING TOO DIFFICULT. THERE'S NO PROMISE HE WON'T KEEP. THERE'S NO GARRISON OF DEMONS THAT CAN STOP HIM. NO MOUNTAIN HE WON'T CLIMB UP. NO WALL. NO LIE. THERE'S NOTHING. WHAT DID HE DO? HE WENT FROM GLORY TO HELL FOR YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR CHILD, HE WENT. &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR SITUATION, he went. &gt;&gt; Oh, it looked bad. It looked like THE DEVIL HAD WON. BUT OUR GOD PURSUED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The devil had not won. The kings have not won. As a matter of fact, they're about to receive THEIR GREATEST DEFEAT. ALL THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN. ALL THAT HAS BEEN taken is going to be restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 17. And the king of Sodom, and this is after the battle, and Abraham's won the battle. He's got all the goods. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter. and of the kings that were with him at the valley of Sheva, which is the king's dale. And notice who's with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Melzdc, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of the heaven and earth. And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand." and he gave him tithes of all. &gt;&gt; I want to look into this for a bit. First of all, just so we understand who we're dealing with, I want to establish who was this Melzdc. It's the title of a sermon. Who is this Melzdc? It's wonderful. You should listen to it. Hebrews 7 and1. For this Melzdc, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham, returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace, without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a priest continually. &gt;&gt; This is what your prophet says about miser all from the same sermon. And the person is eternal. If you notice, he had no father. He had no mother. He had no time. He ever began. He had no time. He ever ended. And ever who it was is still alive tonight &gt;&gt; because the Bible said here that he had neither father nor mother, beginning of days or ending of life. &gt;&gt; His first being was spirit, God, supernatural. All right? The great eternal. Second, he began to form himself towards flesh &gt;&gt; in a theophony. It's called the word, a body. This then is the state he was in when he met Abraham was called Melzdc. He was in the form of theophony. &gt;&gt; He was at the beginning the word and immorate body. He came in and lived in that in the person of Melzdc. Then later we never heard no more melazedc because he became Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. says, he says, "But this man had NO FATHER OR HAD NO MOTHER." Jesus had a time he started. This man didn't. Jesus gave his life. This man couldn't because he was life. &gt;&gt; So, it would have to be an eternal person. Is that right? An eternal person. SO, IT CAN ONLY BE ONE PERSON. That's God. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's the ONLY ONE THAT'S ETERNAL. GOD. WHO IS THIS Melzdc &gt;&gt; but God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Here he is and he he's unfolding. He's prefiguring God in a body. No beginning of days, no ending of life. And Melzdc presents himself to Abram with the other kings. Notice just just to establish that they come at the same time because in verse 17 it says the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter. Verse 18. And Melzdc, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine. And just so we see that the king of Sodom hasn't left and that they're all there. In verse 21, the king of Sodom begins to speak. And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, "Give me the persons and take the goods to thyself." He offers him a reward. And Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lift up my hand unto the Lord the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latchet, and that I will not take anything that is thine, lest thou should say, I have made Abram rich." I want you to notice something in these actions in Abraham's actions to where he takes the communion from &gt;&gt; Melzdc. &gt;&gt; He takes that communion and then he rejects the king of Sodom. &gt;&gt; Abraham shows where his loyalty is and also the current condition of his faith, &gt;&gt; where his faith is at currently. It shows that he knows where his blessings come from. THAT'S WHY HE gives him the tithes. &gt;&gt; He knows where HIS BLESSINGS COME FROM. AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT he knows there's more to come. THERE ARE MORE PROMISES TO BE FULFILLED. AND THAT'S WHAT Abram is looking to in this moment. HE DOESN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HERE AND NOW. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE THE POSSIBILITY OF A REWARD HERE. The king comes out and HE ACCEPTS WHAT MELZDC GIVES HIM. HE TAKES THE bread and wine. He communes with Melzdc. And in recognition of where his blessings come from AND WHERE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO come from, he offers tithes of everything. But then he turns TO THE KING OF SODOM AND HE REJECTS HIS OFFER. HE REJECTS his gifts and all the spools AND HE SAYS, "I WON'T TAKE anything from you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; OH MY CHURCH. WE DON'T NEED THE REWARDS OF SODOM. WE DON'T NEED WHAT THIS WORLD CAN OFFER US TONIGHT. ABRAHAM KNEW HE WAS BLESSED. HE KNEW THERE WAS MORE COMING. HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE RICH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO POSSESS THE LAND. &gt;&gt; AND HE KNEW WHY. CHURCH, YOU'RE GOING TO BE BLESSED. YOU'RE [screaming] GOING TO OVERCOME. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT. YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE AND YOUR OFFSPRING WITH YOU. AND WE KNOW WHY TONIGHT. IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SAYS, "GOD DID THIS. &gt;&gt; God brought the victory." &gt;&gt; And he's making sure in this moment that all credit FOR ALL HIS BLESSINGS AND FOR ALL HIS wealth remained with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're not going to be able to say, "I got one thing from you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHERE MY BLESSING COMES FROM. &gt;&gt; He's going to receive all the credit. He didn't want a claim on his life, Brother Tim. HE DIDN'T WANT SODOM TO BE ABLE TO SAY, "YEAH, BUT I GAVE YOU THIS." &gt;&gt; "YEAH, BUT I DID THAT FOR YOU." &gt;&gt; YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT? HE DIDN'T WANT SODOM COMING AFTER HIS KIDS YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WITH A CLAIM SAYING, "YEAH, BUT YOUR DADDY DID THIS AND YOUR DADDY DID THAT." THERE WAS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL REJECTION OF SODOM AND SODOM'S IDEAS. DADDIES, IT'S TIME TO REJECT SODOM. REJECT THE IDEAS OF SODOM. HAVE NO CLAIM ON YOUR HOME. HAVE NO CLAIM ON YOUR CHILDREN. HAVE NO CLAIM AT ALL EXCEPT THE CLAIM MADE BY Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Abram made sure there were no claims. God called me. &gt;&gt; God placed me. God is providing for me. &gt;&gt; And here Abraham reaffirms his trust that God alone is his provider and God alone is his exceeding great reward. Abraham refuses in this moment to be entangled by Sodom. And by refusing wealth from the kings, he sets a very clear boundary that he will not be entangled and therefore he will not be influenced by Sodom. &gt;&gt; Sodom rewards do nothing but bring an influence into your life. &gt;&gt; Sodom offers pleasures. Now &gt;&gt; it offers an easier way. It offers less commitment. It offers less sincerity. It offers you a way to fit in at school. It offers you A WAY TO QUICKLY advance at work. &gt;&gt; It offers you the pleasures of sin for a season. &gt;&gt; But it's time we declare THIS WORLD WILL HAVE NO CLAIM ON MY LIFE. WHAT I GET AT WORK WILL BE BECAUSE GOD BLESSED ME AT WORK. WHAT I GET IN THIS WORLD WILL BE BECAUSE GOD BLESSED ME WITH IT. BUT I WILL NOT BEND. I WILL NOT BOW. I WILL NOT LOWER STANDARDS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FROM THE KINGS OF SODOM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm going to be faithful to God and allow him to bless me as he sees fit &gt;&gt; with the rewards that he sees fit for my life because our God is a God who rewards those who diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to get our eyes back on the promise. &gt;&gt; And don't forget, there is a promise that we receive at the end just like Abraham. But we've got to recognize the blessings that we receive along the way. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, all that is within me. Bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, OH MY SOUL, AND FORGET NOT ALL HIS BENEFITS. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities. Who healthth all thy diseases. Who redeemth THY LIFE FROM DESTRUCTION. WHO CROWNETH THEE WITH LOVING KINDNESS AND TENDER MERCIES. WHO SATISFYTH THY MOUTH WITH GOOD THINGS SO THAT THY YOUTH is renewed like the eagles. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, WE WANT THE FINAL REWARD. BUT AS WE FIGHT AND AS WE JOURNEY AND AS WE PRESS TOWARDS THAT, FORGET NOT ALL HIS BENEFITS. &gt;&gt; HE PROMISES JOY AND HE GIVES IT. HE PROMISES PEACE AND HE GIVES IT. HE PROMISES HEALING AND HE GIVES IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Our God is NOT SLACK CONCERNING HIS PROMISES. HE'S with us every STEP OF THE WAY. I SAY, WHAT AN AWESOME GOD WE SERVE. &gt;&gt; WHAT A MIGHTY GOD THAT WE SERVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's time that WE BEGIN TO HAVE RESPECT UNTO THE recompense of THE REWARD. &gt;&gt; LOOK PAST THE CIRCUMSTANCE. LOOK PAST EARTHLY PRESSURE, earthly pleasure &gt;&gt; and begin to keep our eyes on the promise. &gt;&gt; Reject doubt. Reject unbelief. Reject Sodom and get a hold on the promise tonight. No matter KNOWING THAT NO MATTER WHAT SODOM OFFERS, &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT YOU OFFER ME IN THIS LIFE, THE REWARD I'M GOING TO GET IS GREATER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MOSES KNEW. THAT'S WHAT ABRAHAM KNEW. NO MATTER WHAT THEY CAN OFFER ME, THAT IS GREATER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's what Moses did. He looked to God's reward. [snorts] says, "By faith, Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season." Sodom's reward. &gt;&gt; Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, Sodom's reward, &gt;&gt; for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward. Amen. &gt;&gt; You study a little bit and it's believed that Pharaoh's daughter was an only child and she herself was childless. Moses was in line to be the Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Think about that temptation. Not a CEO, not a powerful business owner, the most powerful man in the world, &gt;&gt; right at his fingertips. Think about the justification he could have used. Oh, I can really help Israel more from a position of power. &gt;&gt; I I I can do this and then I can work in a way and I can I can ease their bonds and I can I can free them with this power. But in order to do that, he'd have to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. &gt;&gt; And he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter because he couldn't be that and a son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You can't be of this world and a child of God. &gt;&gt; You got to make a decision tonight. You got to pick one or the other. Where am I at? WHAT AM I GOING TO BE? WHAT AM I GOING TO STAND FOR? HE COULDN'T BE THAT AND PART OF THE PROMISE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's time to put things in the scales. IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT the things that that we choose and the things that WE DO AND AND COMPARE THEM TO THE PROMISE. COMPARE THEM TO DO WE HAVE RESPECT UNTO THE RECOMPENSE OF THE REWARD? DO WE RECOGNIZE WHAT IT IS WE'RE FIGHTING FOR? DO WE RECOGNIZE WHAT IT IS WE'RE STRIVING FOR? &gt;&gt; AND SO MANY TIMES WE THROW OFF ON PEOPLE LIKE ELVIS AND SAY HE SOLD OUT FOR A FLEET OF CADILLACS AND THERE'S MANY WHO SELL OUT FOR WAY LESS. &gt;&gt; What is the reward at the end? He chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. In other words, he was willing to pay take his part with the people of God here. Though it was a suffering part, &gt;&gt; though it was a suffering lot, that he might have his portion with them eternally. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He rejected Sodom's offer because he knew that the reward of God was so much greater. Maybe you're suffering now, maybe struggling now, maybe hardships now, AND YOU OFFER A PALACE HERE NOW, AN EASY WAY OUT. BUT I KNOW WHAT'S COMING. I KNOW WHAT REWARDS ON THE WAY. AND IT'S SO MUCH GREATER THAN A LIFE OF EASE. IT'S SO MUCH GREATER THAN A JOB THAT TAKES ME OUT OF CHURCH. IT'S SO MUCH GREATER THAN CARS AND TRIPS AND TRAVEL AND ANYTHING SODOM CAN OFFER ME. &gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER PUT THOSE THINGS OVER SERVING THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I know what's coming. I know the rapture is my reward. I KNOW THAT HEAVEN is our reward. &gt;&gt; Oh, we can't imagine how great heaven's going to be. I know heaven has to be suitable for the price that was paid. &gt;&gt; And the price that was paid was the blood of Jesus. So how amazing heaven must be, &gt;&gt; HOW MARVELOUS, HOW wonderful &gt;&gt; Matthew Henry says this. He's a commentator on the Bible. He says this about heaven. He said, "Believers may and ought to have respect to this recompense of reward. They should acquaint themselves with it. approve of it and live in the daily and delightful expectation of it. Thus, it will prove a landmark to direct their course, a lone a load stone to draw their hearts, a sword to conquer THEIR ENEMIES, A SPUR TO QUICKEN them to duty, and a cordial to refresh them under all the difficulties of doing and suffering work. WHAT'S HE SAYING? ACQUAINT YOURSELF WITH THE REWARD. EXPECT IT. LIVE FOR IT. QUIT LIVING FOR WHAT'S HERE AND LIVE FOR THE REWARD THAT WE'RE GOING TO GAIN. &gt;&gt; I don't want to settle tonight &gt;&gt; for temporary rewards. &gt;&gt; I have a promise of eternal rewards. &gt;&gt; No matter what comes my way, no matter the ups and the downs, no matter the circumstances, we judge him faithful tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that he that made the promise is able to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He tells us &gt;&gt; my we got to believe. We got to have faith. We got to trust. He tells us in Hebrews 11:6, "Without faith, it's impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; I know what's coming, church, &gt;&gt; and I don't want any other reward." &gt;&gt; I don't want nothing that sin can offer or Satan can offer or pleasure can offer. just the snares of life. Even if it's not sinful, I don't want to put those things in a place that it hinders me &gt;&gt; to where I can't reach those rewards that are coming. &gt;&gt; This is this isn't about just being a good person. &gt;&gt; This isn't about just just going to church and and everybody thinks you're a great guy. That's not going to get you the reward. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO BE SOLD OUT FOR IT. &gt;&gt; We got to be all in for it. We got to run WITH OUR WHOLE HEART TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be tainted by the desire for popularity, &gt;&gt; tainted by the desire for riches. I don't want it set of me that I've already received my reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about Jesus talking about the hypocrites and and the Pharisees and those that were bound up by religion and those who desired man's praise. And he says, "Take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them." &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you have no reward of your father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Now, why says, "Therefore, when thou doest thine arms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogue and in the streets, that they may have glory of men." Notice where they want their reward from, &gt;&gt; men. &gt;&gt; They want it here. And he says, "Verily I say unto you, they have their reward." &gt;&gt; And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as hypocrites are, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward. Moreover, when you fast, be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance, for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward. &gt;&gt; They're doing it for the wrong reasons. &gt;&gt; They're in church on Sunday for the wrong reasons. &gt;&gt; They do it for human recognition and human praise and earthly reward. And I found this so outstanding. If you look into the Greek, that saying there, they have their reward, and I'm not going to try to pronounce it in the Greek, but it comes from a term that means paid in full. The transaction is complete. &gt;&gt; They get nothing else. &gt;&gt; The transaction is complete. &gt;&gt; He's given you all you're going to get. &gt;&gt; He's sealed the book. He's moved on. Imagine if Moses had accepted the riches of Egypt. Imagine if Abraham had exacted the king had accepted the king's praise and the king's reward, the reward of men. It would be said they have their reward. &gt;&gt; Think about it. But instead, Abraham paid him tithes. Abraham recognized his blessings. Abraham received the covenant and staggered not. Abraham fought the good fight and he remained true to the promised reward. The one that he couldn't see with his eyes. The one that he could only see through FAITH AND GOD SAW HIM RIGHT THERE TURNED DOWN THE REWARD OF THE KINGS. HE SAW MOSES TURN DOWN THE REWARDS OF EGYPT BECAUSE THEY HAD FAITH TO the reward THAT WAS COMING. SO BECAUSE THEY TURNED THAT DOWN AND THEY STOOD THERE, THEIR TRANSACTION WASN'T CLOSED, THEIR TRANSACTION WAS NOT CANCELLED BECAUSE IT WASN'T COMPLETE, THERE WAS A REWARD COMING. OH, HALLELUJAH. THERE'S A REWARD COMING FOR YOU TONIGHT. OH, EVEN THOUGH there were MESS UPS AND EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE FAILURES AND EVEN THOUGH SARAH WAS IN A BAD MOOD THAT DAY, ONE DAY WHEN IT WAS LEAST EXPECTED, Abraham lifted his eyes up in the tent door and here came three men walking. THERE WAS A TRANSACTION TO BE SETTLED. OH, HALLELUJAH. ONE DAY WHEN IT'S LEAST EXPECTED, YOU'RE GOING TO LIFT YOUR EYES UP AND A LOVED ONE'S GOING TO APPEAR IN YOUR LIVING ROOM. A LOVED ONE'S GOING TO COME WALKING THROUGH THE DOOR. THERE'S A TRANSACTION TO BE SETTLED. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED OUR REWARD YET, BUT IT'S COMING. IT'S COMING. HALLELUJAH. [applause] There was a transaction. There was a promise to be received. There was a reward coming. Prophet of God says there that Melzdc met Abraham and Abraham paid ti to him. Amen. Abraham, the greatest man on the face of the earth, paid ti to Melzdc, the king of peace, the king of Salem, the king of righteousness, and he was a prince, he was a prince, he was a king, and he was the servant of the most high, which Jesus was. And when Abraham a few years later or not long after that when Lot had backslid and Sodom had been burnt and Abraham was left alone with Sarah out on the barren grounds on this journey when things get hard when nothing's going right when everything's going against you out on the barren grounds when their cattle was all dying from starvation. It looked like God had failed him. But he had a strong faith to believe. And one day, let it be today, Lord. He was sitting in the door of his tent under the big oak. It still stands in memorial TODAY AS IT'S CHARRED OVER AND HELD. AND THERE ABRAHAM SITTING IN THE DOOR OF his tent seen Melzdc coming to him. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TRANSACTION TO COMPLETE. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A REWARD TO SETTLE UP. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT MOMENT? HE CHANGED THEIR BODIES. HE REWARDED THEM FOR THEIR FAITH WITH THE CHANGE OF THEIR BODIES THAT THE PROMISED son could come. Church, we got the same thing coming. We're waiting on a PROMISED SON AND WE'VE BEEN HOLDING ON AND WE'VE BEEN BELIEVING AND WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING AND HE SAYS, "I'M COMING DOWN TO SETTLE THE TRANSACTION. I'M COMING DOWN TO REWARD YOU WITH MELZDC'S REWARD." OH, he says, "Church, he will have to change this physical being to let us be caught up. We can't go up THIS KIND OF BODY. HE WILL CHANGE OUR body in a moment. In a twinkling of an eye, WE'LL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER IN THE AIR TO meet the Lord IN THE AIR. I SAY, "LET THAT BE MY REWARD. THAT'S WHAT I'M HOLDING ON TO. THAT'S WHAT I'M FIGHTING FOR." THE REWARD OF A BODY CHANGE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We're on a faith walk. &gt;&gt; And there are promises that have been made to you. &gt;&gt; Promises that have not been fulfilled yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's okay to say that. Yet &gt;&gt; some of you have held on for decades, &gt;&gt; but we judge him faithful. &gt;&gt; We trust him to bring it to pass. We have faith and it's accounted unto us. I'm not settling for an earthly reward evening like tabernacle. &gt;&gt; I'm not settling for riches here. They have their reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May that never be said of me. I don't want to just be religious. I want to be faithful. &gt;&gt; I want to have faith. I want to please God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses refused the rewards that came with Egypt in order to receive the reward of Abraham's seed. That was greater to him. It's time we recognize what's coming. It's time we look to the promise and get our eyes off the here and now. all that the kings are offering, all that Sodom's offering you, all that the world's offering you, and and they're presenting all these rewards. And I say, I'm not taking my reward now. I have recompense to the reward. I'm not going to get tied down to Leodysa and tied down to a RELIGIOUS SPIRIT. WE'VE COME OUT OF HER. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT HIM STUCK ON MY FRONT PORCH KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. I WANT HIM TO COME IN LIKE MELZDC DID AND AND COMMUNE WITH ME. I WANT HIM TO BE MY PORTION. I WANT HIM TO BE MY REWARD. I WANT HIM TO FEEL WELCOME. I I WANT HIM TO COME INTO MY HEART. AND I I WANT ETERNITY. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HIM OUT THERE ON THE DOOR SAYING, "BUT I GO TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; I I I TAKE MY KIDS TO CHURCH." NO, I WANT TO COMMUNE WITH CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I WANT THAT REWARD. I WANT TO LAY EVERYTHING OF THE WORLD DOWN. I WANT TO REJECT SODOM TODAY AND SAY, "LORD, YOU ARE MY GREAT REWARD. YOU ARE MY SHIELD. YOU ARE MY EVERYTHING. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, brother Brandham says, he says that's part of their inheritance that he has reserved for them. If they were willing to walk with him through the tools and snares of life and being an honor to him, he was going to reward them. He is not forgetful of our labor of love. God will always recompense us for our efforts to please him. He says, "Oh, cries the spirit, I see your poverty. I see your need. You haven't very much, if anything, to boast of. What you did have has been taken from you. You gladly gave up your possessions in exchange for eternal ones. You're laughed at. You're scorned. You don't have material resources to fall back on, but you're rich in spite of it all. Your security lies in him who is your shield and exceeding great reward. Your kingdom IS YET TO COME, BUT IT WILL COME, and it WILL BE AN EVERLASTING ONE. YES, I AM MINDFUL OF YOUR TRIALS AND WOES. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET ALONG, BUT I WILL REMEMBER ALL OF THIS WHEN I RETURN TO claim you as my own. And then I will REWARD YOU, &gt;&gt; CHURCH. HE HASN'T FORGOT ABOUT YOU. HE'S MINDFUL OF YOU. HE SEES WHERE YOU'RE AT AND HE SAYS, "I'M GOING TO REWARD YOU FOR ALL OF IT." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, this is the promise to all those who suffer with him here on earth. All those who endure patiently, knowing that God, the just judge, would reward them. They who gave up all for him and committed all to him will sit down in his throne and share in his glorious kingdom. Oh, we have a word for us all at this time. Hold fast. &gt;&gt; Hold fast. Persevere. Don't give up. Put on the whole armor of God. Use every weapon he's given us. Use every gift AT OUR DISPOSAL AND LOOK AHEAD WITH JOY. LOOK PAST WHAT SODOM'S OFFERING YOU TONIGHT. LOOK PAST THE THINGS OF THE WORLD TONIGHT. LOOK AHEAD WITH JOY BECAUSE we're going to be crowned by him who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; Such a promise, a reward, an eternal reward. Brother Brandham, I'm gonna close with this. Brother Brandon would take that meeting there that he had with Melzdc there in Genesis 14 where Melzdc serves him communion and then he would tie it over into the book of Mark where Jesus is taking communion with his disciples and and Jesus says and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many verily I say unto you I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink get new in the kingdom of God. And brother Brandham ties it in there with with Melzdc and he shows how that when this earthly battle is over, he's returning from the battle of the king's victorious. He said, "When this earthly battle over, when we go to that meeting in the air, then he will serve us the communion at the wedding supper." And he says, "But Melzdc, after his child Abraham had won the victory, Melzdc met him and gave him wine and bread, showing that after this earthly battle is over, we will meet him in the heavens and take the communion again. It'll be the wedding supper. I will not drink no more of the vine or eat the fruit until I eat it and drink it with you and new in my father's kingdom." Is that right? Notice again, Melzdc went to meet Abraham before he got back home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a beautiful type here. We have Melzdc meeting Abraham before he got back home after the battle. We meet Jesus in the air &gt;&gt; before we get home. Amen. &gt;&gt; After you've stood the test, &gt;&gt; after you've held out in faith, &gt;&gt; after you've believed God and it's been imputed unto you for righteousness, after you've rejected the rewards of Sodom, Melzdc &gt;&gt; will serve you communion. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the great high priest Melzdc will come someday and we'll eat the communion a new with him in the kingdom of God. One of these great glorious days. Oh, I'm so happy tonight to be in his kingdom. Yes, sir. Some great day, some marvelous day. Time shall be no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, God rewards faith. &gt;&gt; He rewards those that stand on the promise. those who are faithful and our God will repay. &gt;&gt; He's not going to be indebted to you. &gt;&gt; He's not going to be indebted to no man. Tonight, if I could just encourage you, seek that reward right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lay everything here down and run with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Seek that reward with all your heart. Seek after that with everything that's in you. He's our portion. &gt;&gt; He is our reward. He is our everything. And he offers it to you tonight. &gt;&gt; He offers communion to you tonight. And you stand in a place, many of you, where you got to make a choice. &gt;&gt; Which reward? &gt;&gt; Which way am I going to go? I know reward I'm after. &gt;&gt; I'm seeking Melzdc's reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. Will you stand together with me tonight? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father, Lord, we're offered so much in this world, but Lord, the scriptures show how faithful you are. Lord, the scriptures show that every promise you ever gave you will fulfill. And you're just looking for somebody to hold on. You're looking for somebody who'll reject what's going on in this world and turn their whole heart to you. Lord, I lift my hand to you tonight and I say, Lord, that's me. Lord, forgive me, Lord, if I haven't, Lord, had enough respect, Lord, to the reward and the greatness of it and recognizing, Lord, what purchased that reward for me, Lord, that your blood purchased it, Lord, may I give you my everything tonight and my all in all, Lord, no matter what comes my way, Lord, may it be written of me that I, Lord, I staggered not at the promise. May it be written of me that I overcame by the word and by the blood of the lamb. Lord, I want to give you my everything tonight. Lord, as I seek that city whose builder and maker is God, Lord, you are our portion. You are our great and exceeding reward. Lord, may that satisfy our soul till that day when once again you serve us that communion, Lord, at the marriage supper of the lamb. Lord, thank you for your word. Thank you for how rich it is. Thank you, Lord, how a prophet came in this day and opened it all up to us. Lord, we thank you in the name of Jesus. We commit this service and these people into your hands in Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. The only [singing] real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in [music] you.
