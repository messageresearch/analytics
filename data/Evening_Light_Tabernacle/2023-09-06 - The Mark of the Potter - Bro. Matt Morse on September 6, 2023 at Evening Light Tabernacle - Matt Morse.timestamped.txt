[24:10] Tim and myself
[24:12] others went with us or gathered with us
[24:15] up there brother Ron Spencer's meeting
[24:16] for Labor Day had a wonderful time of
[24:18] the Lord and but it's always good to be
[24:21] home amen I always love coming home amen
[24:25] we have many needs this morning this
[24:26] evening we just want to take before the
[24:29] Lord and just ask God to move on the
[24:31] scene because I believe he's that kind
[24:33] of God and I I believe he knows what we
[24:36] have need of today
[24:38] um in our in our hearts and our lives
[24:40] before we even before we even ask he
[24:43] hasn't answered and we we know what kind
[24:46] of God he is he's not just enough he's
[24:49] more than enough
[24:51] amen he's he's not just a Healer and a
[24:54] liver but he's more than that he's
[24:55] everything we ever had need of
[24:58] amen we just love him tonight with all
[25:00] of our hearts and I was just reading
[25:03] this scripture and just read it again I
[25:05] sent it to some some of the days of the
[25:07] Lord will go forth like a warrior he
[25:10] will stir up his Zeal like a man of war
[25:13] he will shout out yes he will raise a
[25:17] war cry he will prevail mightily against
[25:20] all his enemies amen what a mighty God
[25:24] we serve there's nothing too hard for
[25:26] him there's nothing too great for him
[25:28] there's no sickness too great we know
[25:30] that already amen we can even like
[25:32] Tabernacle and say cancer is not too big
[25:34] out of peace is not too big brain bleeds
[25:37] are not too big he's that kind of God
[25:39] Amen and we know him to be that kind of
[25:42] God we have sister Erica Parker that's
[25:45] in a real intense battle right now
[25:48] that sickness of cancer in her life the
[25:51] devil's trying everything he can do to
[25:53] to Ravish her body with cancer
[25:56] but it doesn't matter what it looks like
[25:59] as far as what we see with these natural
[26:01] eyes it only matters what his word says
[26:03] and his word says by his stripes she's
[26:06] healed and I just believe that with all
[26:09] of my heart I maybe I'm dumb enough to
[26:11] believe it what if you don't call me I
[26:12] know God is able he ain't more than able
[26:16] and you know I was thinking about this
[26:18] thought of that little boy that little
[26:20] baby that brother Brandon went to and
[26:22] said it's the most hideous thing you
[26:24] ever saw could barely whistle out of his
[26:26] throat because of the cancer or whatever
[26:28] it was that was on him he said he didn't
[26:30] even know what to say but he said I I
[26:32] just placed the blood of Jesus between
[26:35] this boy and that sickness and he walks
[26:37] out in just a few moments and just a few
[26:40] look not too many hours of young man
[26:41] young baby was healed that's our God
[26:45] and I and I hope you come tonight
[26:47] expecting that kind of God to to move on
[26:50] our behalf and for our sister Erica and
[26:52] of course brother Ron Spencer as well
[26:54] and uh just ask the Lord to continue to
[26:57] touch his body we have brother Philip
[27:00] roncaller that went in today I believe
[27:02] it was today for a heart cath and they
[27:05] didn't really give him good news he has
[27:07] 100 percent blockage in what they call
[27:09] the Widowmaker so he has to have a
[27:11] surgery on Friday so uh just asking the
[27:15] Lord to be merciful in that situation
[27:17] brother Jonathan Middleton asked for
[27:19] prayer for sickness in his body tonight
[27:22] also brother Boyce Mitchell's in the
[27:24] hospital with an infection I think from
[27:27] a surgery that he had had some infection
[27:29] there so I just want to remember him
[27:31] today brother Dennis siminelli's brother
[27:34] John is on hospice really bad shape and
[27:37] asking prayer for that need how many
[27:39] would want to just take these knees
[27:41] before the Lord and maybe you have a
[27:42] need on your heart tonight you want to
[27:44] just mention it to the Lord in prayer
[27:46] let's just go to him in prayer father we
[27:49] just want to say Lord tonight how much
[27:51] we love you once again over thankful
[27:54] tonight that you are a faithful God that
[27:58] you're here and you hear our hearts
[28:00] request
[28:01] Lord I I think about
[28:04] the the where you told us to knock and
[28:07] keep on knocking and and ask and keep on
[28:10] asking and Lord we've called out these
[28:13] names many times but Lord we're here
[28:14] again tonight calling out the name of
[28:17] Erica Parker to you lord lord just
[28:20] reminding you Lord you have a daughter
[28:21] that has a need
[28:23] Lord I believe there's still purpose in
[28:25] her life here on this Earth and I just
[28:28] want to remind you Lord there's purpose
[28:30] as a mother and a wife and a daughter
[28:32] Lord she could serve and and a great
[28:34] testimony of your healing power Lord
[28:36] Lord I asked God that you would go to
[28:39] where she's at father the doctors are
[28:41] saying all the worst things they could
[28:44] possibly say and but Lord we don't look
[28:46] to what the doctor says we look to what
[28:48] your word says and your word says I'm
[28:51] the Lord God that heals all diseases
[28:53] your word says that by your stripes
[28:55] she's healed and Lord we confess that
[28:58] word and upon the confession of that
[29:00] word tonight we confess healing over our
[29:02] sister's body Lord that those spots of
[29:05] cancer will leave her and the lesions on
[29:08] her liver will go away and the swelling
[29:10] and all of that God you're more than
[29:12] enough Lord we don't really have the
[29:14] words to say but Lord we have an example
[29:16] and we as a Church of the Living God
[29:18] place the blood of Jesus between that
[29:21] daughter of God and that sickness and we
[29:23] say sickness take your hands off of
[29:25] God's Property Lord we ask these things
[29:28] tonight because we believe and we know
[29:30] you're that kind of God and we're just
[29:32] keep on asking and keep on knocking or
[29:34] for our brother Ron we continue to knock
[29:36] it for his need Lord and Lord we see
[29:39] Lord such a miracle in his life and God
[29:42] but we're looking for a completion of
[29:43] that healing and deliverance Lord and
[29:45] that body and Lord once again we place
[29:48] the blood of Jesus between him and that
[29:50] sickness and Lord we ask it in the name
[29:52] of Jesus to go and leave his body Lord
[29:55] for this infection and brother Boyce
[29:57] says well Lord brother Jonathan fight

[43:18] game changer he's a glory maker he's a
[43:21] body changer there's something about him
[43:23] is worth talking about when I get an
[43:25] opportunity I like to tell people my God
[43:27] is an awesome God he ain't never tell me
[43:30] one time he led me out of sin he's led
[43:33] me from the from the shuts and he turned
[43:35] me from my path and he set my feet on a
[43:37] rock to stay I said he's an awesome God
[43:39] and he's worthy to be praised
[43:42] I think we have an awesome God
[43:46] I like to talk about it
[43:48] amen help me come to hear the word of
[43:50] the Lord amen how many come to have
[43:52] church tonight
[43:53] I love a church that's on fire for God a
[43:56] church of people that love the word of
[43:58] God how many love the word
[44:00] hey man isn't it wonderful to go to a
[44:02] church that people come and they come to
[44:04] hear the word there ain't no there ain't
[44:06] no other attraction but they come
[44:08] because they're weren't born children of
[44:09] God and they come to hear the word of
[44:11] the Lord
[44:12] there was an old preacher back in the
[44:13] 50s you may have heard of him his name
[44:15] was Jack Cole
[44:17] Jack Cole brother bam said he had
[44:18] Bulldog faith and I love Jack Cole I've
[44:21] listened to every sermon that he has
[44:22] recorded I'm one of them old souls I
[44:24] like to hear this old guys and they're
[44:27] the the inspiration that they had and
[44:30] but I remember a message that he
[44:32] preached it was called a message to the
[44:33] modern day Church
[44:35] I thought my if he preached that then
[44:36] imagine what it'd be like now
[44:38] he said but you know the churches today
[44:40] he said the only way they can get people
[44:42] to come to church is if they have a if
[44:44] they serve chicken and have an ice cream
[44:46] party and make sweet tea for everybody
[44:48] and he said that's about the only way
[44:49] they can get them there he said but I
[44:52] think if your church has to serve
[44:53] chicken and ice cream and tea to get
[44:55] people to come to church then your
[44:56] church is As Dead As the chicken it's as
[44:58] cold as the ice cream and it's as weak
[45:01] as the tea but I thank God that we have
[45:03] a church tonight that we can go to with
[45:05] a body of Believers that don't have to
[45:07] have some other attraction but the word
[45:09] of God has drawn us to the house of the
[45:12] Lord tonight that we could Fellowship
[45:14] around God's word
[45:16] didn't he Wonderful Tonight
[45:18] I said God's a life changer
[45:21] amen I love the Lord amen I just want to
[45:23] say it's good to be in the house to the
[45:25] Lord tonight and just want to thank
[45:27] brother Tim for inviting us to become
[45:29] and be a part and it's the first time
[45:31] I've got to see the the church that you
[45:33] built I've been there when in the old
[45:35] building before as a young man and my
[45:38] what a what a beautiful place God's
[45:41] really blessed you I it just touches my
[45:43] heart that God cares that much for his
[45:45] children
[45:46] what a blessing it is and I I've always
[45:49] had a lot of respect for brother Tim and
[45:51] and he even when I was a young man he
[45:53] used to come and preach our way and I
[45:55] fell in love with him as a as a little
[45:57] boy and I don't know if maybe because I
[45:59] was the shortest guy in there and by the
[46:01] time he was kind of he was kind of short
[46:03] too maybe I related but he just really
[46:05] he just was such a blessing to us and
[46:08] always always treated me with great
[46:10] respect and and I I've told my wife this
[46:12] before and I said you know there's only
[46:14] about four people in my life that called
[46:16] me Matthew and one of them is my mom and
[46:18] one of them is my banker and one of them
[46:20] is my wife and the other one was brother
[46:22] Tim Pruitt so my every time you'd see
[46:25] him you know I kind of I got a little
[46:26] older and I made my name Matt because it
[46:28] was a little easier and but every time
[46:29] brother Tim see he'd say well hey
[46:31] brother Matthew how are you and so he
[46:34] just really always touched my heart and
[46:36] we've it's just been a real blessing and
[46:38] we appreciate his leadership and the
[46:41] work that the Lord's done here and we've
[46:43] been pastoring in Arkansas there for
[46:45] almost five years now and had the
[46:48] privilege of sending a lot of our young
[46:49] people to your camp meetings and and I
[46:52] know a lot of them that y'all have met
[46:53] and I just want to say thank you as a
[46:55] church for putting on the meetings and
[46:57] the youth meetings I know it's a great
[46:58] sacrifice but I was telling brother Tim
[47:00] today I get to see the results of those
[47:02] young people when they come home and so
[47:04] I thank God that there's a people that
[47:06] will that will make the sacrifice and
[47:08] take the time and and put forth the
[47:10] effort to sow into the Youth of the
[47:12] message of the hour and and it's just
[47:14] been a great blessing and we're so happy
[47:16] to be able to be a part of him and I
[47:19] just want to maybe if we could just go
[47:21] before the Lord and a word of prayer
[47:23] tonight before we read the word and
[47:24] maybe if you have something on your
[47:26] heart I believe God is mindful of what
[47:28] we have need of and I heard brother
[47:30] Timothy say it before we came out that
[47:32] God has orchestrated this service as he
[47:34] does every service
[47:36] he knew who would be here and what would
[47:38] be spoke and what he would put on our
[47:40] heart to speak and I just I don't have
[47:42] anything I could say that would help
[47:44] anybody but I believe if the Lord would
[47:45] come by he could help
[47:47] amens I just trust him and maybe if you
[47:49] have a need on your heart won't we just
[47:51] see each one invite him to come in your
[47:52] own way and maybe just pray for those
[47:55] that's by you and
[47:57] gracious Heavenly Father Lord how
[48:00] privileged we are our Lord to stand in
[48:02] your presence again
[48:04] Lord we're so thankful for your spirit
[48:06] in this building and Lord as you told us
[48:09] in your word Lord and you've never
[48:10] failed us
[48:11] you told us where two or three are
[48:13] gathered together in my name there shall
[48:15] I be in the midst of them and Lord here
[48:17] we've came and Lord we've lifted your
[48:20] name in song and Lord in prayer and Lord
[48:23] we've lifted you in Praise Lord and I
[48:26] hope we've asked you Lord we've invited
[48:28] you Lord him God not only do we believe
[48:30] you're here by your word but Lord we
[48:32] recognize your presence tonight
[48:35] Lord I ask you Lord tonight a special
[48:37] request Lord
[48:38] God that you've brought this meeting
[48:40] together Lord and I pray Lord that you

[48:54] the Lord we ask you Lord that you would
[48:56] intercede on their behalf and God I pray
[48:58] Lord whatever they'd have need of Lord

[49:06] leave me tonight and God that your
[49:09] children will be blessed Lord we are so
[49:12] careful to give you the glory for all
[49:13] you do Lord we pray you anoint the word
[49:15] of God in the name of Jesus Christ we
[49:18] pray
[49:19] amen
[49:20] amen may God bless you tonight and amen
[49:24] I just want to invite you to the
[49:25] scripture and we're going to read out of
[49:27] Jeremiah in the 18th chapter and we're
[49:29] going to start in the first verse and I
[49:31] want to bring greetings from our home
[49:33] Church in Grace Tabernacle and BlackRock
[49:36] Arkansas and and also my my wife has
[49:40] came with me this evening so just to
[49:43] appreciate that I have some of these
[49:45] young people I've had the privilege of
[49:47] meeting I had our tent meeting and
[49:49] things that we do at home and so just
[49:50] have a lot of dear friends here and I
[49:53] pray y'all will keep us in your prayers
[49:54] as well amen amen we just want to read
[49:57] from Jeremiah the 18th chapter we're
[50:00] going to start in the first verse the
[50:02] Bible says in the word which came to
[50:04] Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and
[50:07] go to The Potter's House
[50:09] and there I will cause thee to hear my
[50:11] words then I went down to The Potter's
[50:13] House and behold he worked a work on the
[50:15] wheels and the vessel that he made of
[50:18] clay was marred in the hand of the
[50:19] Potter so he made it again
[50:22] another vessel has seen good to the
[50:24] Potter to make it then the word of the
[50:26] Lord came to me saying O House of Israel
[50:29] cannot I do with you as this Potter
[50:32] saith the Lord behold as the clay is in
[50:35] The Potter's hand so were you in mine
[50:37] hand and what has asked the Lord to add
[50:40] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[50:41] as you take your seats and and just I
[50:44] want to speak tonight on the mark of the
[50:47] Potter and this is something the Lord
[50:49] had just put on my heart and and just
[50:52] again just to appreciate the privilege
[50:55] of being here every one of these
[50:56] brothers have have came and spoke at our
[50:59] church and been just such a tremendous
[51:01] blessing and and just just wonderful
[51:03] testimonies and I might just share this
[51:06] as I get started but at our tent meeting
[51:08] last year brother Timothy had came and
[51:10] and spoke for us had a real move of God
[51:13] and and there was a lady there that was
[51:15] in that in that meeting during the time
[51:17] of the meeting and and that was 27 years
[51:20] she had been on pain medicine and been
[51:22] in and out of doctors for some health
[51:23] issues and they had her on a pretty high
[51:26] medication and and she had done that for
[51:28] 27 years and it was in that meeting last
[51:31] year that she came through the prayer
[51:32] line and the Lord took it from her
[51:34] immediately and she went home that night
[51:36] and and didn't take the pain medicine
[51:38] went to the doctor he said well we got
[51:40] to put you on a program to get to get
[51:42] past that and and because you're going
[51:44] to have withdrawals and you're going to
[51:46] have these symptoms and to this day here
[51:48] we are a year later and I can testify to
[51:50] you she's not had one symptom she had
[51:52] one withdrawal it was just a total
[51:54] deliverance and I believe God's that
[51:56] kind of a God and I appreciate these
[51:58] brothers for serving the lord and but I
[52:00] want to speak this this evening on the
[52:03] mark of the Potter and I know I just
[52:06] think it's wonderful as we come to
[52:09] church tonight and I had traveled around
[52:12] doing a lot of meetings and went from
[52:14] place to places doing missionary work
[52:16] and had the fellowship with a lot of
[52:19] Believers and and you know it's just
[52:21] there's so much chaos in the world it's
[52:22] nice to be able to have a place you can
[52:24] just come and fellowship around the word
[52:26] of God and and just have a wonderful
[52:28] atmosphere and you don't have to worry
[52:29] about people or what they'll say or do
[52:31] it's just a free spirit and and I feel
[52:34] that here and I just it's a welcoming
[52:36] spirit and I just want to just say
[52:39] appreciate it and and but you know I've
[52:42] been in the in the mission field and and
[52:44] done a lot of work over in India and
[52:46] been several times on trips there and
[52:48] and you know you go around the world and
[52:50] you find there's a lot of beliefs and
[52:51] there's a lot of there's a lot of gods
[52:53] there's a lot of religions there's even
[52:55] in just India alone there's there's
[52:57] hundreds of thousands of different gods
[52:59] even millions that people they worship
[53:01] all sorts of things and and you know the
[53:04] great religions that are there Hinduism
[53:06] and Buddhism and Muslims and you know
[53:09] after after a while you find out that
[53:11] every person that you meet it don't
[53:13] matter what what their race is or what
[53:15] country they're from or or what their
[53:17] background is every one of us have a
[53:19] testimony and every one of us have
[53:21] something that we're going going through
[53:22] or came through or going to go through
[53:24] and and but but I noticed in especially
[53:27] in in India you'll see so many religions
[53:29] and you'll notice that each person when
[53:31] they come after a little while you start
[53:33] being able to identify what religion
[53:35] they're of and because they haven't they
[53:37] have marks that are identifying marks
[53:39] and so when they would come you know you
[53:41] would maybe when you first got you
[53:42] didn't understand but after a little
[53:44] while you'd realize that a Muslim you
[53:46] could go and this was a Muslim people
[53:47] these were Hindu people or these were
[53:49] Buddhists and into you know but when you
[53:52] when you visit with them a little while
[53:53] they'll always ask you you know what
[53:54] what are you and you say I'm a Christian
[53:56] and I found this to be the case that
[53:58] that used to you could say I'm a
[54:00] Christian but today uh saying I'm a
[54:02] Christian isn't enough because once you
[54:03] tell somebody you're a Christian then
[54:05] they want to know what kind of Christian
[54:06] that you are you know well you're a
[54:08] Christian or are you a Baptist Christian
[54:09] or you're a Pentecostal Christian are
[54:11] you you know are you or you know what
[54:12] kind of a label it just seems like it
[54:14] don't matter who you talk to today that
[54:16] everyone wants to put a label on you
[54:17] they won't either make you a Baptist or
[54:19] make you a calvinist or or even in the
[54:21] in the political world the Democrat
[54:23] wants you to be a Democrat and the
[54:25] Republican wants you to be a Republican
[54:26] and it just seems that everyone is
[54:28] pulling you to their point of view and
[54:29] and you know they're trying to they're
[54:31] trying to to put that label on you in
[54:34] other words they're trying to keep or to
[54:35] get you to carry their marker to be a
[54:38] Democrat is to carry the mark of a
[54:39] Democrat to be a republican is to carry
[54:41] the mark of Republican and it just seems
[54:43] like it's the nature and I don't think
[54:44] it's a bad nature it's just the nature
[54:46] of humanity it's to get people to agree
[54:47] with you people want people to agree
[54:49] with them and and so you you see as they
[54:51] go and they begin to to pull their way
[54:54] and spread their their belief or
[54:56] introduce you to what they what they
[54:58] have it just seems like that each one is
[55:00] trying to draw you to this and and
[55:02] whenever if they can get somebody to
[55:04] believe them and if they can get
[55:05] somebody to get on their side if they if
[55:06] they can get somebody it's like an
[55:08] argument that's going on and you got one
[55:09] people on one side and other people on
[55:11] another and and they're just pulling at
[55:12] people trying to get them to get on one
[55:14] side or the other so they can say they
[55:16] have somebody else on their side and it
[55:17] just seems they get excited about it
[55:19] well we got another one and we gotta we
[55:21] got another one on our side and you know
[55:22] I thought as Paul dealt with this same
[55:24] thing he was preaching to the Galatians
[55:26] and he said you know this is the same
[55:28] nature when they were going around and
[55:29] and they were teaching on the doctrine
[55:31] of circumcision and Paul they would come
[55:33] to Paul and they would ask him about
[55:35] this this Doctrine and Paul said see he
[55:37] said neither they themselves who are
[55:39] circumcised to even keep the law but
[55:40] they he said but they desire you to be
[55:42] circumcised so that they make glory in
[55:45] your flesh he said see because their
[55:47] Glory came from winning another to their
[55:49] cause it wasn't really your soul that
[55:51] they were interested in it wasn't your
[55:52] life that they were interested in but it
[55:54] was getting somebody else to to to
[55:56] believe in their cause but the more I
[55:58] read about it I thought you know we too
[56:00] have a cause and Paul Paul said see we
[56:02] we our cause is this he said see God
[56:04] forbid that we should glory in anything
[56:06] except the cross of our Lord Jesus
[56:09] Christ he said by whom the world has
[56:11] been crucified and I unto the world he
[56:14] said it's by this cross that I've been
[56:15] dead to the world he said it's Christ
[56:17] before in Christ Jesus neither
[56:19] circumcision availeth anything nor
[56:21] uncircumcision but but only a new
[56:22] creation and Paul said so from
[56:24] henceforth let no man trouble me he said
[56:27] for I bear in my body the marks of the
[56:31] Lord Jesus I thought my isn't it
[56:33] something if we're going to Bear the
[56:34] mark of something Paul said let me bear
[56:36] the mark of the body of the Lord Jesus
[56:39] that the nature of my old man has been
[56:41] cut away and there that remains in me is
[56:43] a new creation a new creature in Christ
[56:45] I say this tonight let my body bear the
[56:48] mark of the Lord Jesus I mean say
[56:50] tonight let my body bear the mark of the
[56:52] Cross of Calvary let my body if I'm
[56:54] going to Bear a mark let me bear the
[56:56] mark of a new creation in Christ see the
[56:58] Bible says we were we're all marked you
[57:00] can go in the Book of Revelations and I
[57:02] won't take a lot of time on it tonight
[57:03] but just to lay a foundation but in the
[57:05] Book of Revelations it tells us that in
[57:07] the end time that people are going to be
[57:09] marked the Bible says that there will be
[57:10] a people that will be marked that would
[57:12] be marked for the mark of the beast and
[57:13] and so in their their end would be
[57:15] destruction and their end would be
[57:17] judgment and their their end would be
[57:19] the the the the Avengers of God and but
[57:22] you notice that in the end time that
[57:23] wouldn't be the only people that would
[57:25] have a mark But brother William said see
[57:26] in the end time there was two classes he
[57:28] said one would have the mark of the
[57:30] beast and the other one would have a
[57:32] seal of God he said see in the Seal of
[57:34] God is the holy spirit that's what
[57:36] Ephesians 4 30. he said greed not the
[57:38] holy spirit of God whereby you are
[57:40] sealed unto the day of your Redemption
[57:42] he said but those that reject the Holy
[57:44] Spirit they're already marked by the
[57:46] beast but here but friends I've not come
[57:48] to talk about those that are marked by
[57:49] the beast but I'm come to talk about
[57:51] those that accepted the mark of God he
[57:53] said see this Mark of God is the Seal of
[57:56] God and it don't mean that you just say
[57:57] something that well I I accept the Seal
[58:00] of God it don't mean you say it just to
[58:01] be a part of something and it don't mean
[58:03] that you say it just so you can fit in
[58:05] the church and it don't mean that you
[58:06] say it to make Mama happy or you'll say
[58:08] it to me Daddy happy to accept the Holy
[58:11] Ghost is to accept a new life to accept
[58:13] the Holy Ghost is to accept a new
[58:15] creation to set to accept the Holy Ghost
[58:18] is to accept the new heart to accept the
[58:20] Holy Ghost is that the body change is to
[58:23] accept that one day this overall body
[58:25] will be caught up in the air with the
[58:27] Lord it'll be changed from corruption
[58:29] unto incorruption from mortality into
[58:32] immortality to accept the mark of God is
[58:35] to accept healing to accept the mark of
[58:37] God is to accept truth he says see well
[58:40] brother man I can't you know I can
[58:42] accept the mark of God but there's
[58:43] certain things there are certain things
[58:44] I can't accept but friends let me tell
[58:46] you a secret tonight you can never
[58:48] accept the Holy Ghost and reject the
[58:50] truth of God's word but the Bible says
[58:52] the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide
[58:54] you into all truth so if you accept the
[58:57] mark of God you accept the supernatural
[59:00] if you accept the mark of God you accept
[59:02] the move of the spirit of God if you
[59:04] accept the mark of God you accept the
[59:06] pastor if you accept the mark of God you
[59:09] accept evangelists and preachers and
[59:10] teachers and Prophets everything that
[59:13] comes with the word of God to accept the
[59:15] mark of God is to accept the word of God
[59:18] then when you accept it it'll keep you
[59:20] from evil for the Bible said that there
[59:22] were those
[59:24] that came they were under this great
[59:26] evil in the revelations of ninth chapter
[59:28] they came into a great evil you remember
[59:30] he said they come out of a bottomless
[59:32] pit those that that didn't have the Seal
[59:34] of God on their foreheads so this
[59:36] Tormentor came out of a bottomless pit
[59:38] and they went to torment in the world I
[59:40] got to reading this yesterday and
[59:41] thought hell what a tragedy it is to
[59:43] think of a people that would be
[59:45] tormented in such a way that the Bible
[59:47] says they would beg for death and God
[59:49] wouldn't even let them die
[59:51] they were tormented for all the time
[59:54] that would pass by of this torment but
[59:56] the Bible says is this Tormentor went
[59:58] out this great evil that came out of the
[1:00:00] bottomless pit that went out to torment
[1:00:02] he said see it could touch not those
[1:00:04] that had the Seal of God on their
[1:00:06] foreheads I thought my every man and
[1:00:09] every woman it didn't matter it didn't
[1:00:10] matter where they came from or who their
[1:00:12] mama was or who their dad he was or or
[1:00:14] what church they went to or what what
[1:00:16] denomination they were from or how great
[1:00:18] they were or how much money they had he
[1:00:20] went out to torment all of them that
[1:00:22] didn't have the Seal of God upon their
[1:00:24] forehead but let me tell you something
[1:00:26] friends that this seal of God not only
[1:00:28] is it on their foreheads but when it's
[1:00:31] placed there it affects your whole body
[1:00:33] to the Seal of God it affects the way
[1:00:36] you act it affects the way you live it
[1:00:39] affects the way you look see the Seal of
[1:00:41] God although it's placed on their
[1:00:42] forehead but it but it affects your feet
[1:00:44] it changes where you go it affects your
[1:00:47] hands and it changes what you touch it
[1:00:49] affects your eyes and it changes what
[1:00:51] you see it affects your mouth and it
[1:00:53] changes what you say see it's the Seal
[1:00:55] of God and brother man said this seal he
[1:00:57] said it ain't some stamp or some spot
[1:00:59] that God would come and put on you he
[1:01:01] said but see hear what God is doing he
[1:01:03] said your forehead is your Revelation
[1:01:05] and your hand is the thing you do about
[1:01:08] it he said so see here what God is doing
[1:01:10] is giving you a spiritual Mark that we
[1:01:13] might do the work of the Lord I thought
[1:01:15] isn't it something that this is what
[1:01:16] Peter asked the Lord when he knelt down
[1:01:18] and Jesus was going to wash his feet and
[1:01:21] Peter said Lord I'll not have you wash
[1:01:22] my feet and Jesus said if I don't wash
[1:01:25] your feet you'll have no part with me
[1:01:27] and Peter asked him he said well Lord if
[1:01:29] that's the case then what's not my feet
[1:01:30] only but also wash my hands in my head
[1:01:33] I'm thought isn't it something here the
[1:01:35] prophet of God would say he says see the
[1:01:37] Seal of God is on your forehead he said
[1:01:39] and it's the Revelation from God and
[1:01:41] then he said but then the hands is the
[1:01:43] work that you do I thought oh my God let
[1:01:45] me be that way tonight Lord not my feet
[1:01:48] only but wash my hands in my head I say
[1:01:51] Lord cleanse me that I may do the work
[1:01:53] of the Lord cleanse me from my head down
[1:01:56] to my feet that night but one thing in
[1:01:58] my body that would hinder the move of
[1:02:00] God and let me bear in my body the mark
[1:02:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:05] you say brother man what will it do to
[1:02:07] you let me tell you what the prophet
[1:02:08] said he said it'll do what they did in
[1:02:10] the first church they were filled with
[1:02:12] the Holy Ghost and their Works were the
[1:02:14] works of Christ
[1:02:16] they laid hands on the sick and they
[1:02:18] recovered they've done all kinds of
[1:02:19] signs and miracles and wonders he said
[1:02:22] because their forehead was healed by the
[1:02:24] Revelation that he was the son of God
[1:02:26] and they were working with him the deity
[1:02:28] of Christ he said there's the mark
[1:02:31] not only were they marked for the
[1:02:33] Revelation he said but then they had
[1:02:35] hands to do a work
[1:02:37] the Revelation caused you to do a work
[1:02:40] you say brother my well you mean the
[1:02:42] Lord's calling us to work that's what
[1:02:43] Jesus said he said the Harvest is plenty
[1:02:45] but the laborers refute
[1:02:48] my think about us doing the Lord's work
[1:02:50] what is the Lord's work we go out and
[1:02:52] have services and we we preach the
[1:02:54] gospel and we go in the mission fields
[1:02:56] and spend money and time and efforts and
[1:02:58] winning souls and testifying to the work
[1:03:00] of the Lord and building places for
[1:03:03] people to come and worship and little
[1:03:05] huts and places and laying hands on the
[1:03:07] sick it's all God's work
[1:03:09] I think sometimes people forget it takes
[1:03:11] work to do the Lord's work
[1:03:14] see sometimes it takes work to do the
[1:03:16] Lord's work see it's a different it's a
[1:03:18] different kind of work working for the
[1:03:20] Lord than it is working at a job or
[1:03:22] working in the Natural Way working for
[1:03:24] the Lord don't have the toll of the of
[1:03:26] the labor that we have in this natural
[1:03:27] it's a different kind of work see see
[1:03:29] our natural work came after the fall in
[1:03:31] the garden remember what God came and he
[1:03:32] told the the woman he said in sorrow
[1:03:34] Thou shalt bring four children and that
[1:03:36] desire shall be to thy husband and he
[1:03:37] shall rule over thee and then he told to
[1:03:39] Adam he said curse will be the ground
[1:03:41] for thy sake for in sorrow thou shall
[1:03:43] eat of it all the days of my life and
[1:03:45] the thistles it'll bring forth in the
[1:03:46] sweat of thy face Thou shalt eat bread
[1:03:49] see it looks like the work began after
[1:03:51] the fall but see but before the fall
[1:03:54] there was still work to do but it was
[1:03:56] just not the sorrow of work see before
[1:03:58] the fall it was not the sweat or the
[1:04:01] toll or the that heavy yoke of survival
[1:04:03] that we go through working in our
[1:04:04] natural life but before the fall it was
[1:04:07] a different kind of work for the Bible
[1:04:08] says when God made man and he made him
[1:04:10] in the Garden of Eden here that man was
[1:04:13] in a perfect condition with God here he
[1:04:16] was in fellowship with God and I thought
[1:04:18] isn't it something that there there
[1:04:19] wasn't nothing negative that could come
[1:04:21] in not even a negative thought if he
[1:04:23] that he could even allow here Adam when
[1:04:26] he was sitting in fellowshipping with
[1:04:27] God in this perfect place
[1:04:29] and here God would desire that the
[1:04:31] people of God today would be in that
[1:04:33] kind of condition I thought isn't that
[1:04:35] the way it is when we come to the house
[1:04:36] of God see Eden is a sanctuary to have
[1:04:39] fellowship with God that's why we come
[1:04:41] to the house of God and we sing songs
[1:04:44] and we worship God you say what are we
[1:04:45] trying to do is to create an atmosphere
[1:04:47] a sanctuary you could say it's a
[1:04:49] temporary Eden it's a place where that
[1:04:51] God can come and have fellowship and he
[1:04:53] can he is a sanctuary he can have
[1:04:55] communion with his children where he can
[1:04:57] speak lift to ear and when you have
[1:04:59] needs you can tell him what you have
[1:05:00] need of and he can answer your prayer to
[1:05:03] make an atmosphere where God can move
[1:05:05] that's why we come we come to church to
[1:05:08] have communion with God to get into a
[1:05:10] place that God can speak to us but even
[1:05:12] in this place listen what God told Adam
[1:05:15] the Bible said and the Lord took the man
[1:05:17] and he put him in the Garden of Eden to
[1:05:20] dress it and to keep it so see even in
[1:05:22] that atmosphere there was still work and
[1:05:25] it wasn't just the man for the Bible
[1:05:26] said he needed to help mate so he made
[1:05:28] him a wife to be a helper mate for him
[1:05:30] so him and his wife both had work to do
[1:05:32] you see see it still work but without
[1:05:34] the toll of the flesh it's work without
[1:05:36] the cause or the curse of death see the
[1:05:38] Lord's work comes with an eternal reward
[1:05:40] I wonder tonight how many would say I
[1:05:43] come to do the Lord's work
[1:05:45] why don't we go to church we come to do
[1:05:46] the Lord's work we come see this is
[1:05:49] God's work this ain't this ain't this
[1:05:51] ain't something that you come to get a
[1:05:52] paychecker we come to do the Lord's work
[1:05:54] brother said that's what we're here for
[1:05:56] that's why we're happy to hear that the
[1:05:58] work of the Lord is increasing every
[1:06:01] time we come into the house of God
[1:06:02] Brother David that's why we come to
[1:06:04] church it's that we can make a place for
[1:06:06] God to move that's why when we come to
[1:06:08] the house of God is to do is to do the
[1:06:10] work of the Lord friends we're not just
[1:06:12] working on the church service it ain't
[1:06:13] just working on having a good time it
[1:06:15] ain't just working on that way we can
[1:06:17] feel good whenever we go home but when
[1:06:19] we come to into the the house of God we
[1:06:21] come to to have a a place of worship
[1:06:24] when we come to restore the temple of
[1:06:25] God and we don't come just to do the
[1:06:27] physical part we don't come just to run
[1:06:30] this town and make a good live stream or
[1:06:32] to make some good songs or good singing
[1:06:34] you know sometimes even that kind of
[1:06:36] work it gets common in the work but
[1:06:38] there's a greater work that we do every
[1:06:40] time we come in the house of God
[1:06:42] Jesus said know ye not that you are the
[1:06:45] temple of God see when you come to the
[1:06:47] house of God you come to do the work on
[1:06:49] God's house when you come to the house
[1:06:51] of God you come to work on the temple of
[1:06:53] God I thought you know that's the way it
[1:06:55] is sometimes the temple gets in bad
[1:06:57] shape and it just needs a little bit of
[1:06:59] work amen somebody sometimes the temple
[1:07:02] needs work sometimes it used to be a
[1:07:04] place of worship and it used to be a
[1:07:06] place of sacrifice and it used to be a
[1:07:08] place that was dedicated to God a place
[1:07:10] that God could well but sometimes just
[1:07:12] like our natural house it'll get
[1:07:14] cluttered up and it needs a little bit
[1:07:16] of spring cleaning and things start to
[1:07:17] get in there that that that you you
[1:07:19] wouldn't really want to invite anybody
[1:07:21] in to see what's going on the inside and
[1:07:23] that's what happens with the temple
[1:07:24] sometimes the Bible says you're the
[1:07:26] temple of God but sometimes the temple
[1:07:28] gets filled up with things
[1:07:30] sometimes it just needs a little work
[1:07:32] it's a spiritual house sometimes it gets
[1:07:35] in bad shape
[1:07:37] sometimes we need the Lord to come by
[1:07:40] we need to work on the temple
[1:07:42] you ever thought of the history of
[1:07:43] Solomon's Temple when God made it it was
[1:07:46] a place where the glory of God could be
[1:07:49] seen
[1:07:50] and when they built the temple it wasn't
[1:07:52] long I thought how did they built it and
[1:07:54] it was so wonderful and the presence of
[1:07:56] God moved and flowed so freely through
[1:07:59] it and the people they were so free to
[1:08:01] worship and but after a little while and
[1:08:04] as the the sin would enter in and before
[1:08:06] long they got into this captivity of
[1:08:08] Babylon and the Bible would tell us as
[1:08:10] Babylon had taken over and took the
[1:08:12] people of Israel and put them in this
[1:08:13] state of Exile
[1:08:15] you know what I saw when I thought of
[1:08:16] these people being in this state of
[1:08:18] Exile here was a people that had a
[1:08:20] desire you know think of all these folks
[1:08:23] it wasn't every one of them wasn't doing
[1:08:24] something wrong
[1:08:25] I thought here's some people there was
[1:08:27] some good people in that in that Land
[1:08:29] There were some good people and there
[1:08:30] there was there were some prophets there
[1:08:32] there was some even even we read the
[1:08:34] prophets of Exile and I thought here
[1:08:36] they were they were all in this
[1:08:37] condition and it was a people that had a
[1:08:39] desire to worship God but it had no
[1:08:41] place to do it
[1:08:43] I thought I wonder if you ever felt that
[1:08:44] way there there's something on the
[1:08:46] inside of us that has a real desire to
[1:08:48] worship God in there there's something
[1:08:49] on the inside of us that has a real
[1:08:51] desire to be a believer and to be so and
[1:08:53] to be so sold out to God that God could
[1:08:55] freely work through us but there's
[1:08:57] something that that won't let us do it
[1:09:00] to see this is the condition of the
[1:09:02] temple a desire to worship but no place
[1:09:05] to do it
[1:09:06] but then they they came and the prophet
[1:09:09] Joel came and spoke he said but I will
[1:09:11] restore saith the Lord
[1:09:14] I thought am I into something even in
[1:09:16] that condition but they had a word from
[1:09:18] the Lord I will restore you say brother
[1:09:20] Matt well what did it take to restore it
[1:09:21] took a people that was willing to take
[1:09:24] the prophet's word
[1:09:26] he said I'll restore it took somebody
[1:09:28] that was willing to take the words of a
[1:09:30] prophet and go get their hands dirty it
[1:09:32] took a people that was willing to follow
[1:09:34] us Aruba back into Jerusalem and didn't
[1:09:36] care to pick up a shovel or pick up a
[1:09:38] wheelbarrow or pick up a saw cutter or a
[1:09:41] diamond bait or something that didn't
[1:09:43] care to go work on rebuilding the temple
[1:09:45] of God friends all it took was somebody
[1:09:47] they had a desire to return the temple
[1:09:49] to its former glory
[1:09:51] and the Bible says in the word of the
[1:09:52] Lord came to the prophet hagai he said
[1:09:55] speak now to zerubbabel the governor of
[1:09:57] Judah into Joshua the high priest and to
[1:10:00] the residue of the people and say who
[1:10:02] among you is left that saw this house in
[1:10:05] her first glory and how do you see it
[1:10:07] now is it not as nothing what a question
[1:10:10] that he asked he said asked him who
[1:10:12] among you saw the house like it used to
[1:10:14] be and is it not as nothing now I
[1:10:17] thought my listen what God was asking
[1:10:18] them are you satisfied with the temple
[1:10:21] of God now what a question if God would
[1:10:23] ask it this evening are you satisfied
[1:10:26] with your temple are you satisfied with
[1:10:28] the condition of God's Temple are you
[1:10:30] satisfied with the temple of God
[1:10:33] has it lost some Foundation has it lost
[1:10:36] some Stones has it been filled with
[1:10:38] things has it been taken up by things of
[1:10:40] the world oh friends if there if there
[1:10:42] was ever a time then the time is now if
[1:10:45] there if there ever was a time you could
[1:10:47] think of a people that need to be
[1:10:48] satisfied with God's Temple he's called
[1:10:50] us to praise he's called us to a time of
[1:10:53] worship
[1:10:54] he said brother man there was a time
[1:10:56] when the temple it was pleasing to God
[1:10:59] there was a time when this Temple it was
[1:11:02] filled with the glory of God there was
[1:11:04] time you know that this Temple it was so
[1:11:06] free to come and worship God and you
[1:11:08] know I could go to church and I could
[1:11:09] lift my hands and in my ear it didn't
[1:11:12] take it it didn't take some song to get
[1:11:13] me worked up it I'd be the first one in
[1:11:16] there and I'd go to church 30 minutes
[1:11:17] early I took my Bible and I'd read my
[1:11:19] Bible in prayer and create an atmosphere
[1:11:22] for God to move
[1:11:23] and when I'd go home I'd kneel down on
[1:11:25] my bedside at night and you know I'd
[1:11:28] kneel down and pray and I had a real
[1:11:29] relationship with God
[1:11:31] put my job and things in my life and the
[1:11:34] pressures of life and all those things
[1:11:36] begin to build up and you know I used to
[1:11:38] sing I used to have so much joy but now
[1:11:41] I got so many bills and oh you know I
[1:11:43] went through a disagreement with
[1:11:44] somebody or whatever it is
[1:11:47] are you satisfied with the condition of
[1:11:50] the Temple
[1:11:52] what a question
[1:11:53] are you satisfied with the condition of
[1:11:55] the table let me tell you something that
[1:11:57] not only were the people not satisfied
[1:11:59] with it but God wasn't either
[1:12:01] but he didn't leave him in that
[1:12:02] condition
[1:12:03] he said now hey guy say to unto them be
[1:12:07] strong osiruble saith the Lord and be
[1:12:10] strong o Joshua the high priest and be
[1:12:12] strong all the people of the land and
[1:12:14] work for I Am With You
[1:12:17] isn't it something that he told he says
[1:12:19] irritable Joshua and the people Caesar
[1:12:22] Ruble was the type of the Lord Joshua
[1:12:25] being the top of the Holy Ghost he said
[1:12:27] Joshua the priest I thought am I here
[1:12:28] see the Lord has a work to do the
[1:12:31] preacher the Holy Ghost Field preacher
[1:12:32] he had a work to do he said but see the
[1:12:34] preacher has to do his part and the
[1:12:36] people have to do their part but then
[1:12:38] the Lord does his part
[1:12:40] so what what did he say he'd do he said
[1:12:42] in a little while I'll shake the heavens
[1:12:45] and the earth and the Sea and all the
[1:12:47] dry land and I will shake all the
[1:12:48] nations and I will fill this house with
[1:12:51] Glory saith the Lord of hosts in the
[1:12:54] glory of this latter house will be
[1:12:56] greater than the glory of the formal but
[1:12:58] friends let me tell you tonight that God
[1:13:00] wasn't just talking about Israel but he
[1:13:02] was talking about you tonight he wasn't
[1:13:04] just speaking of Israel but he was
[1:13:06] speaking of Christ in the Church of the
[1:13:07] Living God that when Christ would come
[1:13:09] into the heart of a Believer he would be
[1:13:11] a greater glory be strong and work you
[1:13:15] say brother man that's the way it is in
[1:13:16] the church today every time you come in
[1:13:18] God's house it takes work let me tell
[1:13:20] your friends I don't think I've ever
[1:13:22] went to church it takes work to get your
[1:13:24] mind off the world it takes work when
[1:13:26] you sit down on a Pew to get your mind
[1:13:27] off a problem it takes work to get your
[1:13:29] mind off your job and work to get your
[1:13:31] mind off of school and work to get your
[1:13:34] mind off your life and work to get your
[1:13:36] mind off of trouble
[1:13:37] but we keep working
[1:13:39] see that's the devil's trick is to get
[1:13:41] your mind so caught up in problems that
[1:13:43] you can't see the promise of God you
[1:13:45] can't see the will of God that you'll
[1:13:47] miss out on a blessing of God but I say
[1:13:49] who came to work tonight yet to work see
[1:13:51] brother I want to work to get my mind on
[1:13:53] the things of God let me work to create
[1:13:56] an atmosphere for God to move let me
[1:13:58] work to make Christ welcome
[1:14:01] and the devil says you're just trying to
[1:14:03] get people worked up I say no I'm not
[1:14:05] that was the prophet of God he said be
[1:14:07] strong and work
[1:14:10] it ain't me but be strong all the people
[1:14:12] of the land and work
[1:14:14] worked at the house would be filled with
[1:14:17] Glory sometimes it takes work it takes
[1:14:19] it takes laying before the Lord it takes
[1:14:21] it takes crying out to God and
[1:14:23] surrendering and it just seems like
[1:14:26] people today they only can the only uh
[1:14:29] forgiveness now that wonders they come
[1:14:31] and stand for a few minutes and walk
[1:14:32] away and think it's going to change
[1:14:34] everything in their life
[1:14:35] but it takes time to pour it out and
[1:14:38] emptying out and emptying out before the
[1:14:40] Lord that the house could be filled I
[1:14:43] imagine some of them got tired of
[1:14:44] working
[1:14:45] some got tired of pushing wheelbarrows
[1:14:47] some of them got tired of packing Stone
[1:14:50] and things to the temple but they worked
[1:14:53] what an encouragement be strong and work
[1:14:56] for the glory of the latter will be
[1:14:59] greater than the glory of the former
[1:15:01] isn't it something that God wouldn't
[1:15:02] leave the temple in that condition I
[1:15:05] thought what a type that is today that
[1:15:07] he won't leave your temple in that
[1:15:08] condition either
[1:15:10] he said because I have made a covenant
[1:15:12] with you
[1:15:13] when I brought you out of Egypt I made a
[1:15:15] covenant and I'm and I intend to keep
[1:15:18] the Covenant that I made I thought it
[1:15:20] did something it's not just the
[1:15:21] preachers that are working it ain't just
[1:15:23] the people that are working but God's
[1:15:25] working too
[1:15:27] it ain't all on us but God's doing his
[1:15:29] part every service God's working to
[1:15:32] every time you come in the house of God
[1:15:34] God's working too the Bible says the
[1:15:36] word of God is a discerner of the
[1:15:38] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:15:39] it's God working on his children he goes
[1:15:42] out into the congregation and he's
[1:15:44] searching hearts and lies and he's
[1:15:46] finding weaknesses and voids in her life
[1:15:48] and cutting things out of her life to
[1:15:50] bring us to a certain place
[1:15:53] see it's not God's desire for you to be
[1:15:55] wrong God don't trap you and trick you
[1:15:57] that's what the devil does he don't he
[1:15:59] don't lay a trap up ahead to try to see
[1:16:01] if he can catch you in a trap just to
[1:16:02] bring you down a little bit God don't
[1:16:04] lay a trick up the road that try to
[1:16:05] trick you to bring you down the devil is
[1:16:07] traps and then goes and tells on you for
[1:16:09] falling in them but God's intention is
[1:16:12] to lead you out to see God still works
[1:16:14] too I thought of how that he comes in
[1:16:17] the service what is he doing but he
[1:16:19] comes to bring the preaching of the word
[1:16:21] to to bring correction and you know I
[1:16:24] thought isn't it something that that you
[1:16:26] know most people when you receive
[1:16:27] correction you take a little boy and by
[1:16:29] it don't feel very good he said but what
[1:16:31] we ought to do is we ought to thank God
[1:16:32] because it's the grace of God that he
[1:16:35] wouldn't leave you in error
[1:16:38] the Bible says Jesus said as many as I
[1:16:40] love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous
[1:16:43] therefore and repent
[1:16:45] can I break this down a little bit let
[1:16:47] everyone said notice he said first off
[1:16:49] notice who he was talking to he said and
[1:16:51] now he says to his own
[1:16:54] so if God is correcting us it's because
[1:16:57] we belong to him
[1:16:59] but first off he says to his own as many
[1:17:01] as I love I rebuke and Jason said seek
[1:17:04] to rebuke is to refuse Mo or to reprove
[1:17:07] most people read this I rebuke and
[1:17:09] chasing and they've got God running
[1:17:10] around with this great whip just beating
[1:17:12] up on people because they don't do
[1:17:13] things right but around said notice he
[1:17:15] said see to rebuke is to reprove and to
[1:17:18] reprove is to expose with a view to
[1:17:21] correction so in other words if God is
[1:17:23] correcting us he's correcting us for a
[1:17:26] purpose he says see so so chasten it
[1:17:29] doesn't mean to punish see most of the
[1:17:31] time you you'll take the the moments
[1:17:32] today I may as well just preach about
[1:17:34] you take the moments today and they
[1:17:35] don't want nobody whipping their kids
[1:17:37] you got these this certain weird thing
[1:17:38] going on around the world that you can't
[1:17:40] spank kids no more and you know it's
[1:17:42] just a you know I I knew that I do a
[1:17:44] different way of parenting and all and
[1:17:46] they came up this new way of parenting
[1:17:47] but but the reality is is because they
[1:17:49] don't understand the difference between
[1:17:51] punishment and discipline but around
[1:17:53] says see God chasten does not mean
[1:17:56] punish punish means to inflict a penalty
[1:17:58] so if you're beating your kids out of
[1:17:59] punishment well they didn't write anyway
[1:18:01] he said see but it means to inflict the
[1:18:03] penalty but to Chase and it means to
[1:18:05] discipline don't mean they didn't get a
[1:18:07] weapon but it was for the purpose of it
[1:18:09] he said see the purpose is to train a
[1:18:12] certain Behavior because the subject's
[1:18:14] amendment is in mind that's what
[1:18:16] discipline is it's to train a child
[1:18:18] remember the Bible says train up a child
[1:18:20] in the way it ought to go that's why we
[1:18:22] discipline our children and God
[1:18:23] disciplines us he says see it's a
[1:18:25] trainer Behavior because the subject's
[1:18:27] amendment is in mind in other words that
[1:18:29] God has a desire to make minor changes
[1:18:31] or modifications in our life he's trying
[1:18:34] to bring us into this perfect place or
[1:18:36] to this image that he has in his mind
[1:18:38] and so and so he he ain't punishing us
[1:18:40] but he discipline us says he chastens us
[1:18:43] and when we hear the word of God see
[1:18:45] it's changing us and it's growing us
[1:18:47] this is what Paul said about it he said
[1:18:49] my son despise not thou the chastening
[1:18:52] of the Lord nor faint when you're
[1:18:53] rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth
[1:18:55] he chasteneth
[1:18:57] and he Scourge with every son whom he
[1:18:59] receiveth and if you endure chastening
[1:19:01] God deals with you as Sons for what son
[1:19:05] has the father that he doesn't chase him
[1:19:07] but if you be without chastisement
[1:19:10] you're where are where we're all
[1:19:12] partakers then you're a bastards and not
[1:19:14] Sons I thought friends I want God to
[1:19:17] deal with me as a son
[1:19:18] I don't want God to deal with me as a
[1:19:20] servant I want to be dealt with as a son
[1:19:22] you see a Son of God he has different
[1:19:24] privileges that a servant don't have see
[1:19:27] sons that come with a they come with a
[1:19:29] certain thing a son a Son of God has a
[1:19:31] security see you have a servant that
[1:19:32] worked for you and you didn't want him
[1:19:34] working for you or he done something
[1:19:35] wrong you could just fire the servant
[1:19:37] but a Son of God you can't fire so you
[1:19:39] don't fire your son well you've done
[1:19:41] something wrong and and you shouldn't
[1:19:42] have done that and daddy don't come down
[1:19:44] and say well you're fired you're no
[1:19:45] longer my son or you're no longer my
[1:19:47] daughter see a Son of God it has a
[1:19:49] security
[1:19:50] but also it has an assurance the Bible
[1:19:53] says the spirit of God Bears witness
[1:19:54] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:19:57] of God so because we're children he
[1:20:00] reminds us that we're his children he
[1:20:02] gave us the security that we will always
[1:20:04] be his children and the Bible said and
[1:20:05] if you're his children then you're Heirs
[1:20:07] of God and your torn heirs with Christ
[1:20:09] that means everything that God gave to
[1:20:11] Christ he gave to you so if he made him
[1:20:14] gave him power over the devil then he
[1:20:16] gave you power over the devil if you
[1:20:18] gave him power over sickness then he
[1:20:20] gave you power over sickness he raised
[1:20:22] him the Bible says he raised him from
[1:20:24] the dead and he set him on the right
[1:20:26] hand of God in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:20:29] Jesus and then Paul said and then God
[1:20:31] has made us to sit in Heavenly places
[1:20:33] see friends he's made us co-equal he's
[1:20:36] made us a joint Heir with God that every
[1:20:38] right that he had was been given to the
[1:20:40] Church of the Living God appearance I
[1:20:42] don't know about you tonight but I thank
[1:20:43] God for my god-given rights I thank God
[1:20:46] for the privilege of being a son and a
[1:20:49] daughter of God we ain't just some that
[1:20:51] just get by every now and then but God
[1:20:53] has bestowed upon you the rights of a
[1:20:56] son and the daughter of God
[1:20:58] we've been made to sit in Heavenly
[1:21:00] places in Christ Jesus
[1:21:02] well the man said every enemy is under
[1:21:05] your feet how many say Amen every enemy
[1:21:07] is under your feet as long as you're in
[1:21:09] Christ because everything's under his
[1:21:11] feet can we get a little bit more on
[1:21:12] this he said see he said every sickness
[1:21:15] every devil every Power even death
[1:21:18] itself is under your feet
[1:21:21] this is the truth he said if I can just
[1:21:24] get the church to see that brother we'll
[1:21:26] be a triumphant church friends we know
[1:21:28] what it'll do it'll cause the church not
[1:21:30] to come to church just guessing to see
[1:21:31] if God's going to do something but a man
[1:21:33] said well what he'll do he'll take all
[1:21:34] the guessing out of it it'll take the
[1:21:36] Hope out of it it'll take the imaginary
[1:21:39] out of it it'll take I thank God the
[1:21:41] make-believe the story time the little
[1:21:43] good old stories that people talk about
[1:21:44] God and it'll put the real faith of God
[1:21:47] in the heart of a Believer he said and
[1:21:49] then they'll come and say I have the
[1:21:51] faith of God and I know it's going to be
[1:21:54] and then something is going to happen
[1:21:56] you see what Satan's doing he's trying
[1:21:58] to take that out of your life you say
[1:22:00] well how will he do it he'll take the
[1:22:01] power out of The Believer by unbelief
[1:22:05] how would he take the power you see but
[1:22:06] let me tell your friends that Satan
[1:22:08] ain't the one that gave it to you so
[1:22:09] Satan can't take it away hello somebody
[1:22:12] somebody say the word gave it to me
[1:22:15] see Satan didn't give it to you what
[1:22:16] gave you the power what gave you the
[1:22:18] power of the devil the word gave it to
[1:22:20] you what gave you power over sickness
[1:22:22] the word gave it to you what gave you
[1:22:24] power over grief the word gave it to you
[1:22:26] what gave you power over sin the word
[1:22:29] gave it to you what gave you power over
[1:22:31] the flesh the word gave it to you
[1:22:33] he said in all things are under your
[1:22:35] feet
[1:22:37] but how many knows did Apostle Paul he
[1:22:39] said but there's one exception to that
[1:22:42] he said all things under my feet this
[1:22:45] exception that Paul preaches about he
[1:22:47] said this there's an exception to that
[1:22:49] and that exception is why so many people
[1:22:50] are powerless today
[1:22:52] I I counsel with people all the time
[1:22:54] that just seem like they live such a
[1:22:56] powerless life
[1:22:57] and I say you know friend the first
[1:22:59] thing I'm going to ask you I'm going to
[1:23:00] talk about Paul's exception
[1:23:02] see Paul says you can read this you say
[1:23:04] well brother man what what exception is
[1:23:06] it is it cancer that's not under my feet
[1:23:08] no that wasn't it
[1:23:10] is it maybe it was depression that's not
[1:23:13] under my feet no that ain't it
[1:23:16] maybe it's suicide the only the thing I
[1:23:19] can't overcome maybe that's that's what
[1:23:21] it is no that ain't it at all
[1:23:24] Paul tells us First Corinthians 15 27.
[1:23:27] he said he has put all things under his
[1:23:30] feet
[1:23:31] but when he saith all things are put
[1:23:33] under him now this word put under come
[1:23:34] from a Greek word hupatasso which means
[1:23:37] to rank under or to make subject to and
[1:23:40] Paul said when he saith then it is
[1:23:42] Manifest that he is accepted in other
[1:23:44] words it's an exception which did put
[1:23:46] all things under him this is good stuff
[1:23:48] in other words read this in context what
[1:23:51] he's saying he says that when God said
[1:23:53] he put all things under the feet of
[1:23:55] Christ he said there was an exception
[1:23:57] and that exception was the one that put
[1:23:59] all things under his feet he said see so
[1:24:02] in other words he's not included in the
[1:24:04] group specifying he says so the one that
[1:24:06] gave the power for you to be subject to
[1:24:09] the devil or the one that put all things
[1:24:11] under your feet Paul said the next verse
[1:24:13] he said see how everything everything is
[1:24:15] subject to him he said but the son
[1:24:17] itself is subject to the father he says
[1:24:20] so so the only exception there is he
[1:24:22] said God is our exception he says Caesar
[1:24:25] the only way listen what Paul's saying
[1:24:27] he said the only way that the son ever
[1:24:29] had power is because the son was subject
[1:24:32] to the father how come everything was
[1:24:34] under his feet it's because he was under
[1:24:36] the father he said see he was subject to
[1:24:38] the one that gave the power I thought my
[1:24:40] isn't that the way it is it's the power
[1:24:42] of the church came by the word of God
[1:24:44] you wonder why people are so powerless
[1:24:46] it's because they're not under
[1:24:47] subjection to the word of God
[1:24:50] see the only way Satan is subject to you
[1:24:52] is if you're subject to God the only way
[1:24:54] he's subject to you is if you're subject
[1:24:57] to the word you want healing in your
[1:24:58] body then you must be subject to the
[1:25:00] word of God if you want Deliverance then
[1:25:02] be subject to the word of God if you
[1:25:04] want God to move on your behalf then be
[1:25:06] subject to the word of God if you want
[1:25:08] the Lord to answer your prayer come
[1:25:10] under subjection to God's word
[1:25:12] no wonder Satan wants to keep the word
[1:25:14] out of the church because the subjection
[1:25:16] to the word brings authority over the
[1:25:19] devil
[1:25:19] oh my you ever noticed a picture I
[1:25:21] always thought it was wonderful the
[1:25:23] picture the brother by him and had the
[1:25:25] angel of the Lord taking the picture
[1:25:27] over in in Houston Texas I thought it
[1:25:29] did something about that photo that the
[1:25:31] angel of the Lord didn't appear under
[1:25:33] his feet but it appeared over his head
[1:25:36] he said see because he was subject to
[1:25:37] the angel
[1:25:39] we're subject to God we're subject to
[1:25:41] the word of God we ain't trying to be
[1:25:43] big somebody's we're not trying to be
[1:25:45] over everybody else but we want to be
[1:25:47] subject to the word of God that God can
[1:25:49] use us he can heal us he can deliver us
[1:25:51] he can lead us
[1:25:54] to do the work of God
[1:25:55] see there's a purpose of God's
[1:25:57] correction see the Paul said he said our
[1:26:00] Earthly fathers they correct us to
[1:26:02] satisfy their own gain he said and we
[1:26:05] reverence them but he said but rather
[1:26:07] much rather wouldn't be be in subjection
[1:26:10] unto the father of spirits and live
[1:26:13] severely I say a few days chastened us
[1:26:17] after their own pleasure our Earthly
[1:26:19] fathers
[1:26:20] he said but whenever God chastens us he
[1:26:23] does it for our prophet
[1:26:25] he said see that we might be partakers
[1:26:27] of his Holiness but isn't it wonderful
[1:26:30] that when God chastens us he chastens us
[1:26:33] for our good
[1:26:34] see he chastens us that we'll be
[1:26:36] partakers he he chastens us he corrects
[1:26:39] us that we might receive a blessing from
[1:26:40] God let me tell you something about God
[1:26:42] friends God he can't change his word for
[1:26:44] anybody so it means God can't change his
[1:26:47] word for you so if God wants to bless
[1:26:49] you and there there's things in his word
[1:26:50] that God wants to bring for your life
[1:26:52] and the only way he can get it there is
[1:26:54] to get you in line with the word that
[1:26:56] provides it he says cease to obedience
[1:26:58] to the word brings out the blessing of
[1:27:00] God he corrects Us in order to bless us
[1:27:03] God don't correct us to beat on us he
[1:27:05] don't correct you just to stomp on you
[1:27:07] and to beat you down where you can't
[1:27:08] have any Liberty and you can't be a Son
[1:27:10] of God and then you can't even can't
[1:27:12] even worship God no more but God don't
[1:27:14] correct that way it corrects you to lift
[1:27:16] you up he corrects you to bless you he
[1:27:19] corrects you that you can be free he
[1:27:21] corrects you that you can have Liberty
[1:27:22] in the house of God
[1:27:24] that's the kind of correction that God
[1:27:25] brings and Paul said to me the
[1:27:28] chastening it seems not joyous it seems
[1:27:30] Grievous he said when it's going on but
[1:27:33] afterward it'll bring forth the fruit of
[1:27:35] his righteousness afterward it'll bring
[1:27:38] the blessing of God on our life he said
[1:27:41] and then we'll lift up our hands that
[1:27:44] have been hanging down
[1:27:46] after correction he said you'll lift up
[1:27:48] our hands that have been hanging down he
[1:27:51] said you'll you'll take he'll lift up
[1:27:53] your old feeble knees and make the path
[1:27:55] straight for your feet I thought isn't
[1:27:57] it something that the correction of the
[1:27:59] word of God brings a Revival to the
[1:28:01] church isn't it something that God's
[1:28:03] word when it comes in the power of
[1:28:05] Correction it don't beat the church down
[1:28:07] it beats it lifts them up it'll cause a
[1:28:10] joy to come into your heart it'll cause
[1:28:12] a Revival to come into your life Paul
[1:28:14] said it'll lift up your old hands that
[1:28:16] have been hanging down and change your
[1:28:18] feeble knees
[1:28:21] it's sad how people go go in church
[1:28:24] today just sometimes or the way people
[1:28:25] walk around it's sad how they are when I
[1:28:28] when I read that scripture it made me
[1:28:29] think of Darwin in that picture that
[1:28:31] they have whenever they talk about
[1:28:32] Evolution and at the very beginning they
[1:28:34] have that whole ape and have knees out
[1:28:36] like this and hands all hanging down and
[1:28:39] that that's where they depicted that
[1:28:40] humans were made and then they went from
[1:28:42] that and turned into people but but
[1:28:44] anyway we were made it all I thought
[1:28:46] isn't that something but Paul says but
[1:28:48] it'll straighten up your feeble knees
[1:28:49] and it'll cause the hands that have been
[1:28:51] hanging down to be raised up let me tell
[1:28:53] you friends we didn't come to church
[1:28:55] like a bunch of eights we came to church
[1:28:57] like Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:59] and the correction of the word puts joy
[1:29:02] in your heart the correction of the word
[1:29:04] it takes condemnation out of your life
[1:29:06] and the correction of the word it causes
[1:29:09] you to lift your hands and praise God
[1:29:10] when you can't be free in the house of
[1:29:13] God a little correction of the word of
[1:29:15] God it'll put a dance back in your step
[1:29:17] it'll take that old Spirit of down the
[1:29:20] depression off of you
[1:29:21] cause you to be able to worship God
[1:29:23] again
[1:29:24] we weren't made like a bunch of AIDS the
[1:29:27] Bible says we are made in the image of
[1:29:28] God
[1:29:29] we weren't meant to be filled with
[1:29:31] condemnation you weren't meant to walk
[1:29:33] around with your head down and your
[1:29:35] knees down and your arms all beat up and
[1:29:37] defeated that ain't the way God Made You
[1:29:39] he made you to walk upright
[1:29:42] the position of a Believer is not down
[1:29:44] the position of a believer's up
[1:29:46] our position is an overcomer that's why
[1:29:49] God told job he said Joe where were you
[1:29:51] when the morning Stars sang together and
[1:29:53] the sons of God shouted for Joy see
[1:29:56] those morning Stars they were the angels
[1:29:57] of light but you know that ain't the
[1:29:59] only place they sing but a brown said
[1:30:01] see they had a celebration before there
[1:30:03] ever was a speck of Stardust before God
[1:30:05] ever created they were having a
[1:30:07] celebration in heaven but then one day
[1:30:09] whenever Christ was born on the Earth
[1:30:11] then the angels of God came down to some
[1:30:13] Shepherds in a field he said then they
[1:30:15] had a celebration on Earth you say
[1:30:17] brother man what caused them to sing in
[1:30:19] heaven it's because God was in heaven
[1:30:21] what caused them to sing on the earth it
[1:30:22] was because God was on the Earth
[1:30:24] he said see and what they did on the
[1:30:26] Earth was a reflection of what they did
[1:30:29] over on the other side I thought Nah if
[1:30:31] it's that way for the angels of God then
[1:30:33] what about the sons of God that were
[1:30:35] shouting for Joy I say they've shouted
[1:30:38] on the other side what caused them to
[1:30:40] shouting Glory it's because God was in
[1:30:42] glory what caused him to shout on the
[1:30:44] earth is because God's in the Earth
[1:30:48] and what you do here is a reflection of
[1:30:50] what you are there
[1:30:52] friends we weren't made to be dead God's
[1:30:54] people ain't a bunch of dead people we
[1:30:56] he said we're made to be alive we're
[1:30:59] made to praise God we're Made To Worship
[1:31:02] the Lord
[1:31:03] we can't help it even even if this flesh
[1:31:06] dies isn't it something even the Flesh
[1:31:08] of a man dies in a few days it'll come
[1:31:11] back
[1:31:12] it'll come in in another body I thought
[1:31:14] my even a flesh dying it can't keep you
[1:31:17] down
[1:31:18] it'll be right where it was back into
[1:31:21] the perfect image of God again appears
[1:31:24] the same God I think of the same God
[1:31:26] that made the man in the beginning he's
[1:31:28] the same God this Foreman man now
[1:31:32] it's never changes the same work
[1:31:35] you say how do you know that that's what
[1:31:36] God is doing with people now because
[1:31:38] it's the same form or nothing's ever
[1:31:40] changed
[1:31:41] it's always been the same Potter the
[1:31:43] Bible says the Lord God formed Man Out
[1:31:45] of the Dust to the ground
[1:31:46] and he breathed or breathe into his
[1:31:49] nostrils the Breath of Life in the book
[1:31:51] of Jeremiah he said to Jeremiah before I
[1:31:54] formed you in your mother's womb I knew
[1:31:56] you isn't it something that was the same
[1:31:58] Potter it was the same God it was the
[1:32:00] same one that formed him but remember
[1:32:02] says see they're the Potter before the
[1:32:04] Potter lies all mankind as one lump of
[1:32:06] clay and out of that same lump he'll now
[1:32:09] make vessels of honor and dishonor and
[1:32:12] the choosing is his own choosing but
[1:32:15] then the chosen ones born of his spirit
[1:32:16] will be trained to conform to His Image
[1:32:19] in their walk he reproves us with all
[1:32:22] long-suffering and gentleness and mercy
[1:32:24] but his own hands think of it with his
[1:32:27] own hands Brother David he corrects us
[1:32:30] for the hand of the Potter
[1:32:33] he corrects us
[1:32:34] but the hand of the Potter I thought my
[1:32:36] isn't it something that this is the
[1:32:38] place when Judah had sinned and they had
[1:32:41] allowed evil to come in their hearts
[1:32:43] it's so bad that whenever God would send
[1:32:45] judgment upon Judah that that Jeremiah
[1:32:48] would go and repent to God and say Lord
[1:32:50] this judgment is so bad don't let it
[1:32:52] come upon me
[1:32:53] he saw it and he said Lord whatever you
[1:32:55] do don't let I'm not part of it he saw
[1:32:58] the Judgment of God and the Lord began
[1:33:01] to speak to him he said Jeremiah go down
[1:33:03] to The Potter's House and I'll give you
[1:33:06] the answer
[1:33:08] so here the prophet of God I thought
[1:33:10] here as he goes down the Bible says he
[1:33:12] went down to The Potter's House and he
[1:33:14] went down he said I've seen him doing a
[1:33:16] work on the wheels and the vessel that
[1:33:18] he made was marred in his hand
[1:33:21] so he made it again
[1:33:23] isn't it something to think they'd hear
[1:33:26] this Potter could take something that
[1:33:28] was broken
[1:33:29] something that was they had they had
[1:33:32] cracks in it and had maybe some dryness
[1:33:34] of over the past few months or things
[1:33:37] that had been going on and let a little
[1:33:38] dryness get in and some cracks in the
[1:33:40] vessel that it wasn't able to be used in
[1:33:42] the way it was intended
[1:33:44] he said but he could make it again
[1:33:47] I thought as he watched the hens of the
[1:33:50] Potter I could just see Jeremiah sitting
[1:33:53] there the Lord sends his Prophet to go
[1:33:55] to a Potter's House here he's looking
[1:33:57] for the answer of the Lord and he goes
[1:33:59] down to a place I could just see they
[1:34:01] have a little Hut out there and the
[1:34:02] Potter working out there on the wheel
[1:34:04] and here Jeremiah the prophet goes out
[1:34:06] and he just stands as a as a visitor
[1:34:09] just watching as The Potter's work in
[1:34:11] this work of clay
[1:34:13] no I thought of it and you know one time
[1:34:15] I was over I was over in India on my
[1:34:17] first trip missionary trip that I went
[1:34:19] on
[1:34:20] when I was out there they we we had a
[1:34:22] big youth meeting there
[1:34:24] and these are kids that don't have they
[1:34:26] don't even have the the their parents or
[1:34:29] Hindus or different ones and and if they
[1:34:32] would even accept Christianity that
[1:34:34] their mamas and daddies wouldn't even
[1:34:35] let them move back in their house
[1:34:37] I watched 13 and 14 year old boys and
[1:34:40] girls that would give their heart to the
[1:34:42] Lord and go live in an orphanage because
[1:34:44] their parents wouldn't allow them home
[1:34:45] but they'd come to a meeting and get
[1:34:48] under the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:49] and you know all these things that
[1:34:51] they've been taught these are kids that
[1:34:52] had grown up and never even heard the
[1:34:54] name Jesus
[1:34:55] but somebody would bring them to a
[1:34:57] meeting and they'd get so inspired by
[1:34:59] the word and I thought my if God would
[1:35:02] take him and he could take their life
[1:35:04] and change it in that way and I remember
[1:35:06] after that first meeting that we had
[1:35:07] there there were so many I I don't
[1:35:09] remember the number but then maybe 25 or
[1:35:11] 30 or or so of them in that first
[1:35:13] service that came in and gave their
[1:35:15] heart to the Lord and wanted to be
[1:35:16] baptized so he went out in on the
[1:35:19] riverbank there and then Brothers was
[1:35:21] going out and there was several hundred
[1:35:22] kids at the at the meeting that invited
[1:35:24] their friends and in the in the pastors
[1:35:26] we were setting up on the river bank and
[1:35:27] I remember watching those young people
[1:35:29] go down into that River and as they
[1:35:32] walked down in there of course here me
[1:35:33] being from the United States I I kind of
[1:35:35] eased over to the side and if you get
[1:35:37] caught baptizing somebody then then it's
[1:35:39] you know it's a it's a life sentence for
[1:35:40] about every one of them that you would
[1:35:42] baptize and so it's quite a in that in
[1:35:44] that region so so I went over to the
[1:35:46] side and I was watching them baptize
[1:35:48] them and and I remember when I looked
[1:35:49] down on the in the Rocks there was a
[1:35:51] there was a little clay picture about
[1:35:53] this big around
[1:35:55] when I saw it I thought you know that'd
[1:35:57] be a neat souvenir you know I come from
[1:35:58] from Arkansas and they there's a lot of
[1:36:00] pottery and Indian artifacts and stuff
[1:36:03] like that and so I thought you know
[1:36:04] that'd be a neat souvenir and I picked
[1:36:06] it up and and the brothers all the
[1:36:08] pastors that were there and they kind of
[1:36:10] gathered around where we were we were
[1:36:11] praying and one of the brothers he said
[1:36:12] oh brother Matt throw that down throw
[1:36:14] that down
[1:36:15] I said what's the matter he said you
[1:36:16] don't want you don't want that I said
[1:36:18] well why not he said well that was used
[1:36:20] to worship Hindu gods
[1:36:22] and I thought here I was holding this
[1:36:24] piece of pottery and just a piece of
[1:36:27] clay
[1:36:27] that had been used it was made it was
[1:36:30] created for the purpose by the by the
[1:36:32] man that had put it together for the
[1:36:34] purpose of worshiping a Hindu god
[1:36:37] and the more I thought looked at it the
[1:36:38] more I thought about it I asked that
[1:36:40] brother I said brother have you ever
[1:36:42] heard the story of the Potter and the
[1:36:44] clay he said well I don't guess I have
[1:36:46] and I I got I sat down on some rocks and
[1:36:48] them brothers began to gather around I
[1:36:50] took that little pot piece of pottery in
[1:36:52] my hand he said oh brother I wouldn't
[1:36:53] even hold that he said don't you realize
[1:36:55] he said that that's something we would
[1:36:57] break it he said that was used for the
[1:36:59] wrong reason and I looked out at those
[1:37:00] young people walking down in that River
[1:37:02] little girls and little boys that were
[1:37:04] walking down the water and something
[1:37:06] came over me and I said brother so were
[1:37:08] every one of them when they were made by
[1:37:10] their parents and and they were raised
[1:37:12] up they were put in them to serve a
[1:37:14] Hindu god they spent every day of their
[1:37:16] life worship it's some other God every
[1:37:19] day of their life they spent out there
[1:37:21] in Hinduism I said that one day the
[1:37:23] Potter came by where they were and he
[1:37:26] called him out of their house into a
[1:37:28] meeting over here and he began to pour a
[1:37:30] spear and he took them down to the
[1:37:32] potter's wheel and he moved holding him
[1:37:35] and he reshaped them and he made them
[1:37:37] into a vessel that could worship
[1:37:39] almighty God I said friends that may
[1:37:42] been used to worship something else but
[1:37:44] today it's been changed I said this
[1:37:46] Potter has got a hold of it it ain't
[1:37:49] what it used to be he's changed it
[1:37:52] by the hands of the Potter
[1:37:55] God said as the clay is in The Potter's
[1:37:58] hand so are you in my hand I don't care
[1:38:00] what you came out of I don't care what
[1:38:02] you've been going through I don't care
[1:38:04] what life's been alive I don't care how
[1:38:06] many battles you've been facing as the
[1:38:08] apocaly is in The Potter's hand so are
[1:38:10] you in my hand
[1:38:11] [Applause]
[1:38:13] he's the same Potter he's the Potter
[1:38:16] that formed in the very first man in the
[1:38:18] beginning let me tell you friends
[1:38:19] there's many Potters that has formed
[1:38:22] many vessels they made Vessels to carry
[1:38:24] water they made Vessels they carry to
[1:38:27] carry grass seed and Herb see in food
[1:38:29] but let me tell you this Potter the
[1:38:31] first vessel that he ever made he wasn't
[1:38:33] made to carry some man-made thing it was
[1:38:36] made to carry the very breath of
[1:38:38] almighty God for the Bible says he made
[1:38:40] it and he breathed into his nostrils the
[1:38:43] Breath of Life
[1:38:44] that's our Potter
[1:38:47] oh my authority he made us
[1:38:50] if he made us in the beginning well what
[1:38:53] makes you think he can't mold you
[1:38:55] what makes you think you can't shape you
[1:38:58] what makes you think you can get so out
[1:39:00] of shape that God don't know what to do
[1:39:01] with you let me tell you this I can tell
[1:39:03] you you can get so out of shape that the
[1:39:05] devil don't know what to do with you
[1:39:09] that God don't know what to do with us
[1:39:10] he's the Potter
[1:39:13] the one that made us who I thought is he
[1:39:16] this Potter
[1:39:18] he went down that day
[1:39:21] here in the very beginning
[1:39:24] he took a
[1:39:26] dirt off the ground
[1:39:28] the first vessel he ever made
[1:39:31] and he began to form it
[1:39:33] I'm gonna hurry and close
[1:39:35] but to begin to form it
[1:39:38] y'all too easy to preach to
[1:39:41] but I could just see as he went down
[1:39:44] he made made the shoulders of a man
[1:39:48] here he was made in His image of the
[1:39:50] Bible said but then he took the dust to
[1:39:51] the ground and he formed man
[1:39:54] or isn't it something to think that he
[1:39:56] formed he took him and made his hair in
[1:39:59] his head and began to make this shape
[1:40:02] that God wanted the man to look like
[1:40:04] he formed him
[1:40:06] you catching it he formed him now here's
[1:40:09] the The Potter's hands
[1:40:11] he formed him with his own hands
[1:40:14] he placed his hands on every every part
[1:40:16] of him he made there wasn't a piece of
[1:40:18] him that God didn't make he formed the
[1:40:20] Men Out of the Dust to the ground
[1:40:23] when it was when it had no form when it
[1:40:26] had no shape I thought it it did
[1:40:28] something and he had never had any
[1:40:29] practice it was the first vessel that
[1:40:31] God had ever made and he made it in
[1:40:33] perfection
[1:40:35] he formed it and I thought as he looked
[1:40:38] down at it I wonder if God when he
[1:40:40] looked at it that he wanted it to live
[1:40:43] the Bible said when it got done forming
[1:40:45] I could just see Adam laying there on
[1:40:48] the ground formed by God maybe God
[1:40:51] walked around and looked at him for a
[1:40:52] bit that's exactly what I wanted him to
[1:40:54] look like
[1:40:56] but then he said he knelt down
[1:40:58] and he breathed into his nostrils the
[1:41:01] Breath of Life
[1:41:03] Friends when the Breath of God entered
[1:41:05] into that clay vessel
[1:41:07] something started to happen
[1:41:09] I say something started to happen the
[1:41:12] heart in that clay vessel started
[1:41:14] beating that heart that was made from
[1:41:16] clay it started beating the lungs that
[1:41:19] was in that vessel that was made by God
[1:41:22] they began to fill up with air I thought
[1:41:24] as God would Breathe the breath of life
[1:41:26] into that old clay vessel all of a
[1:41:28] sudden maybe over his hand just laying
[1:41:30] there still and after God began to
[1:41:32] breathe in him all of a sudden a little
[1:41:33] finger starts to move like this after a
[1:41:36] little bit a little toe starts to move
[1:41:38] like that you say what is it brother man
[1:41:40] it was Signs of Life why because the
[1:41:43] Breath of God had entered into an
[1:41:45] Earthen vessel
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:47] he made him he formed in him and he
[1:41:50] breathed into him his own breath and Man
[1:41:52] became a living soul and all of a sudden
[1:41:55] I can just see Adam as he stood up and
[1:41:59] he rose from the dust to the ground
[1:42:01] hear that that man that God had formed
[1:42:04] imagine what it was like I I wish I
[1:42:06] could see it what it was like that day
[1:42:08] that he stood up by God and God took him
[1:42:10] by the hand and he shook his hand for
[1:42:12] the first time and he hugged his neck
[1:42:14] for the first time
[1:42:15] he was made by God
[1:42:17] in the same God that formed him formed
[1:42:20] you
[1:42:21] he made every part of you there ain't
[1:42:24] not one part of you that was a mistake
[1:42:26] he made sure that's why I told Jeremiah
[1:42:28] I formed you in your mother's womb he
[1:42:30] knew how you would be he knew the
[1:42:31] problems that you'd faced he knew the
[1:42:33] things you'd have to overcome he's God
[1:42:35] and he made you
[1:42:38] he's our partner
[1:42:40] he's been molding us ever since
[1:42:43] you know they say a Potter an old Potter
[1:42:46] when he makes a vessel
[1:42:48] there's something distinct about every
[1:42:50] Potter that whenever he gets to the end
[1:42:53] of making the vessel that he's making
[1:42:55] that he actually leaves a mark on it
[1:42:59] so they say it like this that the Potter
[1:43:01] that because when it gets down to the
[1:43:03] end and he's shaping and the wheels
[1:43:05] turning and the clay is turning in the
[1:43:06] wheel then when it gets to the end maybe
[1:43:08] he would have his hand aimed a certain
[1:43:10] way while it while he was shaping it is
[1:43:13] the peace begins to take shape he would
[1:43:15] he would move his hand a certain way and
[1:43:17] would leave a mark they call this in the
[1:43:19] Antique World The Potter's mark
[1:43:21] and so there are those that were
[1:43:23] whenever the antique dealers when they
[1:43:25] go look at a piece of pottery that's how
[1:43:26] they identify if it's authentic because
[1:43:29] because it has the mark of the Potter on
[1:43:31] it see it shows by what hand that it was
[1:43:34] made
[1:43:34] you know sometimes I thought of this as
[1:43:37] our Potter as he's made us the hand of
[1:43:39] our Potter just as he made Adam and just
[1:43:41] as he created him and you know sometimes
[1:43:43] the hand of God is Stern sometimes the
[1:43:46] hand of God as he as he's making us and
