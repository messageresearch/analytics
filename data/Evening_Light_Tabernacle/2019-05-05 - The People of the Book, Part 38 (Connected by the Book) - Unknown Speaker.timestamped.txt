[57:24] worship and praise we ask Lord your
[57:27] blessings today upon us as we look into
[57:30] the word and we look into the xix of God
[57:34] knowing that nineteen will break the
[57:36] yoke
[57:37] it'll take the unbelief of our lives as
[57:40] we ministered Wednesday night Lord our
[57:44] chief purpose ISM as a church is to cast
[57:47] seek now that's what salvation is no
[57:51] word is preached the devil is moved back
[57:53] and the hearts are convicted and able to
[57:57] believe and they come to you Lord oh god
[58:00] I prayed that today that we'll just move
[58:03] in a temple that were you can work in
[58:05] our lives and hearts bring healing and
[58:08] deliverance in the mighty name of Jesus
[58:10] Lord and do you know those that are in
[58:13] need no God those that are even out on
[58:15] the Internet or they would be listening
[58:18] in to the service today father I pray
[58:21] that you minister to them some of them
[58:23] are homebound and maybe can't come to
[58:26] church but Lord you know their need we
[58:29] just ask God that you'll supply the
[58:31] cordilla riches and glory and I asked
[58:34] Lord today that our offering of
[58:37] sacrifice would be acceptable in your
[58:40] sight as we offer it with the blood of
[58:42] Jesus because we know only through that
[58:45] blood is it is accepted in Jesus name
[58:48] Amen
[58:50] it may God bless you amen
[58:54] good to see each one of you here this
[58:56] mornin we just want to look right into
[58:59] the Word of God I hope you enjoyed
[59:01] worshiping the Lord that's what it's all
[59:04] about is giving him the praise and the
[59:06] glory and the honor we're going to look
[59:09] at Luke chapter 24 and verse 49 and then
[59:14] go back to Acts chapter 1 and verse 6
[59:17] for our scripture reading this morning
[59:20] Luke chapter 24 and verse 49 and behold
[59:24] I send the promise of my father upon you
[59:27] but are ye in the city of Jerusalem
[59:30] until you be endued with power from on
[59:35] high and then over here in Acts chapter
[59:38] 1 and verse 6 and when they therefore
[59:43] were come together they asked of him
[59:45] saying Lord without at this time restore
[59:49] again the kingdom to Israel and he said
[59:52] unto them it is not for you to know the
[59:55] times of the seasons which the father
[59:57] have put in his own power but you shall
[1:00:00] receive power after the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:03] come upon you and you shall be witnesses
[1:00:04] unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea
[1:00:08] and in Samaria and unto the uttermost
[1:00:11] parts of the earth and here we are
[1:00:14] amen god bless you as you are seated in
[1:00:19] man I would get you to continue
[1:00:21] remembering those that will be traveling
[1:00:24] this week brother Timothy and brother
[1:00:27] Tim winners will be returning from the
[1:00:30] beans to Japan connect in there with a
[1:00:33] brother Cragin and brother George
[1:00:36] winters and they'll be all flying home
[1:00:39] on Tuesdays should arrive here sometimes
[1:00:42] Tuesday so just keep them in prayer the
[1:00:45] Lord's done some wonderful things there
[1:00:47] and we thank God for that
[1:00:49] amen for His mercies baptisms were
[1:00:53] taking place I think in brother
[1:00:55] Timothy's meetings at the the youth
[1:00:58] gathering in in the Philippines they
[1:01:02] baptized 30 in the wonderful name of
[1:01:04] Jesus amen we thank God for that then
[1:01:12] you know some of the one of the Japanese
[1:01:15] young young sisters got to go over to
[1:01:18] the Philippines and take part of those
[1:01:20] meetings and it was really life-changing
[1:01:22] for her and so you know where you can
[1:01:26] see other young people for 500 gathered
[1:01:29] there and and just all just dedicated to
[1:01:33] serve the Lord and got moving in a
[1:01:35] tremendous tremendous way a man in those
[1:01:38] meetings and then of course in the other
[1:01:41] works it's altogether different yet it's
[1:01:44] the same God but on a different
[1:01:47] application of gifts when you're
[1:01:49] speaking to new believers and and trying
[1:01:52] to establish works but I understand
[1:01:55] there was a whole lot of things that
[1:01:57] have been accomplished by their journey
[1:01:59] there and they ministered with the the
[1:02:02] church group of 25 30 people there and
[1:02:06] on the first weekend by the Timothy
[1:02:09] ministered along with brother Craig and
[1:02:11] then flew out to the Philippines while
[1:02:13] they remain behind and went down into
[1:02:16] other parts of Japan and witnessed
[1:02:19] baptized and and it's just wonderful to
[1:02:22] see Seoul sate and then people wonder
[1:02:25] sometim well you know is is is there
[1:02:28] still grace well I'll tell you there is
[1:02:30] still grace amen because God is still
[1:02:33] reaching out to Souls and bringing
[1:02:36] deliverance and so we're just continue
[1:02:39] looking to that and you know that we are
[1:02:42] continuing
[1:02:43] the translation works so there's quite a
[1:02:46] bit of being works that are being
[1:02:48] translated we're we're just finishing up
[1:02:51] the seven seals in the Japanese language
[1:02:53] getting them on the hub and and the many
[1:02:57] other sermons that are getting up there
[1:02:59] now so you know we we want to get the
[1:03:01] message in their hands right God's doing
[1:03:04] some wonderful things in our age and
[1:03:06] time and we want to be a true witness of
[1:03:10] that we know what it did for us and how
[1:03:12] it changed our lives and how it opened
[1:03:14] up our understanding and brought us to
[1:03:17] know and love Jesus more so you know we
[1:03:20] want to get the message in them in a way
[1:03:22] that they can understand it and be
[1:03:24] blessed by it
[1:03:25] so we are we're diligently just last
[1:03:28] night I paid for the translations of the
[1:03:31] of the sixth seal and getting it up on
[1:03:35] there on the hub and so we're just
[1:03:37] finishing up question answers and then
[1:03:40] the Seventh Seal and the whole seal book
[1:03:42] will be done plus we got a lot of other
[1:03:44] sermons that are now maybe twenty
[1:03:47] twenty-five sermons on the hub already
[1:03:50] that the Lord has helped us to do to get
[1:03:52] them in the Japanese language we'll be
[1:03:55] starting on the next I laid out five the
[1:03:59] next ones for them to go through that I
[1:04:03] picked out in 1965 sermons for them to
[1:04:07] start now to translate and as busy as
[1:04:11] they have been they'll get them right
[1:04:13] away and every time that we get one on
[1:04:15] the hub it just makes it work anybody in
[1:04:19] all the world that speaks Japanese
[1:04:21] nobody you don't have to be in Japan you
[1:04:23] can be in Alaska you can be in South
[1:04:27] America you can be in Africa but if you
[1:04:30] speak or use the Japanese language you
[1:04:33] can access it on the hub and of course
[1:04:37] the English is there and much of the
[1:04:40] French and Spanish and different other
[1:04:42] languages that are daran and so if you
[1:04:45] even you if you want to go listen to it
[1:04:47] the sermons and brother branham the
[1:04:49] message hub just just get on there and
[1:04:53] and have a gastronomical jubilee amen I
[1:04:57] think we ought to be listening to the
[1:04:59] message I believe it'll bless our hearts
[1:05:01] and change our lives and transform us
[1:05:04] amen we know what it did for us so I
[1:05:07] encourage it to do for others I I know
[1:05:11] myself I've been transformed not only by
[1:05:14] the Holy Spirit but by the Word of God
[1:05:16] as we have grown in the Word of God so
[1:05:19] you don't feed your experience on God's
[1:05:22] Word hey man it's all available to you
[1:05:25] it's at your fingertips it's a lot
[1:05:27] better than you know going to somewhere
[1:05:30] like that than some of these other sites
[1:05:31] that are out there you know put your put
[1:05:34] your time into the right time now this
[1:05:37] morning we're going to be speaking on
[1:05:40] connected by the book and we're speaking
[1:05:43] about the people of the book and as we
[1:05:47] just continue to stop the people of the
[1:05:50] book that we have been ministered of
[1:05:53] home but this morning this little sermon
[1:05:56] here we're going to be speaking about
[1:05:57] being connected by the book because the
[1:06:02] Word of God connects us to God amen
[1:06:05] you might have seen in the recent news
[1:06:07] where Israel's ambassador to the United
[1:06:11] Nations Danny Danon addressed the the
[1:06:15] United Nations and he held up a copy of
[1:06:19] the Bible for all the ambassadors
[1:06:20] present to see and he says this is our
[1:06:25] deed to our land and he said God gave
[1:06:31] the land to the people of Israel and
[1:06:33] Genesis when he made a covenant with
[1:06:35] Abraham and he stressed to all the world
[1:06:39] that the Bible is what gives them the
[1:06:43] deed to the land and even so God has
[1:06:47] given us the deed to the land of promise
[1:06:50] the holy ghost that's our promised land
[1:06:52] and and so we we open our scripture this
[1:06:57] morning with the question that has been
[1:06:59] asked by the disciples Lord
[1:07:03] now at this time this is 2,000 years ago
[1:07:06] now at this time restore again the
[1:07:09] kingdom to Israel and jesus answered it
[1:07:13] is not for you to know that times of the
[1:07:15] season which the father had put in his
[1:07:18] own power
[1:07:19] now that was 2000 years ago as we said
[1:07:23] and now seven church ages ago and it was
[1:07:27] not for them to know the times nor the
[1:07:30] seasons of the restoration of Israel but
[1:07:35] we are in the hour when it is time to
[1:07:38] restore the kingdom and I'm not so type
[1:07:42] and our counterpart Israel is a nation
[1:07:44] who has been now restored back to their
[1:07:48] homeland we can actually actually begin
[1:07:52] to see some of the fulfillment of the
[1:07:54] scripture even the question that they
[1:07:56] were asking Lord will you at this time
[1:07:58] and know we can say no it's this day
[1:08:01] it's not 2000 years ago but no it's this
[1:08:04] day that you will restore the kingdom
[1:08:07] back to Israel again and Israel now
[1:08:10] being a sovereign nation over their land
[1:08:12] and restored to their homeland now if
[1:08:15] they are our type the natural seed of
[1:08:19] Abraham and we are the spiritual that
[1:08:22] can we see that it's also restoration
[1:08:26] time and that it is a season for all of
[1:08:30] Israel but the natural and by the seed
[1:08:33] and the royal seed for the kingdom to be
[1:08:36] restored a man and for a people to
[1:08:40] return back to their homeland
[1:08:43] can I say addy return back to the Holy
[1:08:45] Ghost amen to all the power of God and
[1:08:49] the promises that lay in the Word of God
[1:08:52] the entire title deed of everything that
[1:08:57] was promised to a people in the end time
[1:09:00] it is the season of restoration now you
[1:09:05] know we we've seen the Israel as a a
[1:09:07] land that has been barren and forsaken
[1:09:11] Oh howling wilderness and Desolator
[1:09:14] acronym and it all came because they
[1:09:17] rejected their Messiah and we understand
[1:09:20] all of that but you know today again we
[1:09:23] also look and we see a church that has
[1:09:27] come through a similar type of dispersal
[1:09:30] were that they have have wondered now
[1:09:32] and the Bible the Bible has come like a
[1:09:36] howling wilderness and and an unfruitful
[1:09:39] land and what was promised not coming to
[1:09:43] pass in the lives of the people the
[1:09:45] supernatural not being on display and
[1:09:48] the power of the Holy Ghost not being
[1:09:51] made known are you with me and man and
[1:09:54] brother branham talked about this kind
[1:09:55] of thing and he says you know he himself
[1:09:58] was one as a restoring prophet and he
[1:10:02] would look out there and God would show
[1:10:04] him types and signs and and examples and
[1:10:09] even out when he was in the wilderness
[1:10:11] he said I was up in Canada thousands of
[1:10:14] miles from a hard top road and I was
[1:10:18] writing and and on through the moonlight
[1:10:21] at night
[1:10:22] as I was returning there oh my with my
[1:10:25] horse and I came up over a great big
[1:10:28] burn over and he said that you know
[1:10:32] there was Jesus even would tell the
[1:10:35] Pharisees and the Sadducees that they
[1:10:37] formalized such denominations of his day
[1:10:40] said you're nothing but an open
[1:10:42] Sepulchre
[1:10:43] you're just a grave you're just full of
[1:10:46] dead men bombs this is Jesus description
[1:10:50] of them and brother men would look at
[1:10:53] these trees and he said you know it's
[1:10:55] just like a graveyard and it's a spooky
[1:10:58] little looking place and he said here
[1:11:00] come a wind right down coming through
[1:11:03] and as it hit them they would they would
[1:11:06] sway in the wind must have been quite a
[1:11:08] wind for for trees without limbs and
[1:11:12] without leaves to be the big move but
[1:11:15] they would move and he said as they
[1:11:17] moved there it was a mournful sound
[1:11:20] and he said the trees put him in a mind
[1:11:23] of somebody's great big spider to stand
[1:11:28] in there but just as dead as a doornail
[1:11:31] is that even the Palmer ones eat all the
[1:11:34] black off of them and the fiery trial
[1:11:37] says has Emblaze all the spirit away
[1:11:42] from it and there's nothing left but a
[1:11:43] big sculpture
[1:11:44] and then this big just as dead as it can
[1:11:48] be and he said in when the Russian
[1:11:51] mighty winds come down from heaven the
[1:11:53] only thing they can do is grow and carry
[1:11:57] on and say it ain't so and hardly
[1:12:01] knowing anything they say the days of
[1:12:03] miracles are past and just every time
[1:12:06] that God sends a revival man every time
[1:12:11] God sends a revival in signs and wonders
[1:12:14] begin to come up and fall around the
[1:12:16] people like that they say Oh days of
[1:12:20] miracles were past what the problem left
[1:12:23] the cattle were me in Caterpillar Aidan
[1:12:26] and what the Methodists left the Baptist
[1:12:28] has eaten what the Baptist's left the
[1:12:30] Presbyterians Eden and what the
[1:12:32] Presbyterians left the Pentecostals is
[1:12:35] eaten and he said why you stripped the
[1:12:37] tree of everything it's got a man all
[1:12:41] the power all the joy all the good
[1:12:44] things that God gave to his church on
[1:12:46] the day of Pentecost they tore it out
[1:12:49] and nothing's left but a big church name
[1:12:52] hey man now you know the Bible said they
[1:12:56] have a name but they're dead they have a
[1:12:58] name that they're living man but they're
[1:13:01] dead he said sir you was once a tree but
[1:13:05] what about now
[1:13:06] that's a Pentecostal church - what's the
[1:13:08] same thing you you took the route of the
[1:13:11] dead tree what the palmer worm left the
[1:13:14] caterpillar read the Baptist took all
[1:13:17] the shouting away from the Methodists
[1:13:20] and one ate this and one eat this until
[1:13:24] they stripped the church down till they
[1:13:26] got them you're sitting there dead as a
[1:13:28] doornail
[1:13:29] no spirit no shouting and man no joy no
[1:13:36] peace no healing no nothing hey Matt now
[1:13:41] you're gonna have to decide whether if
[1:13:43] you're one of them old dead trees this
[1:13:45] morning because the way some of you are
[1:13:48] responding as the wind is going for that
[1:13:51] the Holy Spirit you're sitting there you
[1:13:57] see you see you've got nothing but
[1:14:00] adjusted cold Church Creed we don't want
[1:14:05] just a church creed and message theology
[1:14:08] we want the Holy Spirit to be able to
[1:14:11] come in our Church in our bein a man
[1:14:15] move us not the Holy Ghost but he said
[1:14:19] you know he said God's every time God
[1:14:21] sends down a big rush of glory down you
[1:14:24] to sit there and moan and say well I
[1:14:26] don't believe it it's just psychology or
[1:14:29] it's this it's that dead from the roots
[1:14:32] twice dead I'm reading what your prophet
[1:14:34] said put that by the roots
[1:14:36] it's a sad-looking day with Joel looked
[1:14:40] at that and so he said that God said I
[1:14:43] will restore saith the Lord
[1:14:45] I'm trying to tell you Church we are in
[1:14:48] the season on restoration
[1:14:51] they were asking will it come now Lord
[1:14:54] when will it be and God has let you know
[1:14:57] you're in the hour of it URM the day of
[1:15:01] it when the word has been restored in
[1:15:04] its power and its glory and all the
[1:15:06] promise of the Lord I will restore and
[1:15:11] he says I happened to look that night
[1:15:13] when that William was blowing and how
[1:15:16] stiff and starchy and dead it was
[1:15:20] sitting there moaning and groaning
[1:15:22] didn't have no leg to bend with it no
[1:15:26] bark on it to make it flexible and it
[1:15:29] was just moaning and groaning on account
[1:15:31] of the
[1:15:32] when my my dog dr. so-and-so and
[1:15:35] so-and-so said so-and-so but he said I
[1:15:38] happened to notice that down underneath
[1:15:42] there was some undergrowth coming up
[1:15:48] hallelujah amen some little mooses like
[1:15:51] that and they are the life in them and
[1:15:55] when that wind began they hit them they
[1:15:57] just got to twisting and raining and
[1:16:00] shouting and have a glorious time he
[1:16:03] said Lorna Linden let me read you what

[1:19:36] but dureena as a time as it comes to
[1:19:41] times ludus season said times and
[1:19:43] seasons and so there are seasons within

[1:20:22] coming from the presence of the Lord now
[1:20:26] if you don't you just remain an old
[1:20:28] stately pine tree that's burned over and
[1:20:30] no life in it I mean you know get while
[1:20:34] you're living and living there in your
[1:20:37] pleasures of sin of Laodicea and
[1:20:40] refusing to move but God's gonna have
[1:20:43] some movers
[1:20:45] Amen God's going to have some people
[1:20:47] that are responded through the Holy
[1:20:50] Ghost that deal with the issues in their
[1:20:52] lives
[1:20:53] hey ma'am now of course just because the
[1:20:57] word tongues don't mean it fulfills
[1:20:59] fulfill but let's look here in a buck
[1:21:03] two and three for the reason is yet for
[1:21:07] an appointed time but at the end it
[1:21:11] shall speak and shall not lie though it
[1:21:15] Terry wait for it because it will surely
[1:21:19] come a man it will not tarry and my
[1:21:26] worry that again case he misses a man
[1:21:29] for the reason is yet for an appointed
[1:21:31] time now Jesus would tell them this it's
[1:21:35] for an appointed time it ain't for you
[1:21:38] to know I'm gonna deal with the Gentiles
[1:21:41] for two thousand years
[1:21:43] it ain't for you to know there's gonna
[1:21:45] be two seven Church ages it ain't for
[1:21:48] you to know this the father has kept
[1:21:50] that in his own hands he sealed it up
[1:21:53] and kept it a mystery to the end time
[1:21:56] but we're not living in the days of the
[1:21:59] sealing up of the mystery but we are in
[1:22:03] the days of the opening of the mystery
[1:22:05] worried now is revealing the season and
[1:22:09] the time of restoration where there's a
[1:22:13] people going back to their homeland
[1:22:15] after all of these years are going back
[1:22:18] to the Holy Ghost again going back to
[1:22:21] the Apostles doctrine going back to what
[1:22:24] Paul preached going back to Bible truths
[1:22:27] and Bible doctrine and Bible healing
[1:22:30] through final salvation
[1:22:32] instead of just I accept Jesus as my
[1:22:34] savior and going back your old simple
[1:22:36] way but a real power of God unto
[1:22:40] salvation the changes alive
[1:22:43] now that we are in that season that
[1:22:46] season of the blowing of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:49] [Applause]

[1:27:03] just because you're given a word don't
[1:27:07] mean it's fulfilled that was our mistake
[1:27:10] 50 years ago we got a message and
[1:27:14] thought that is what it was a message
[1:27:16] we're all ready to go home there was a
[1:27:19] lot of that word we had to step into and
[1:27:21] put on a met and dress ourselves e hey
[1:27:27] man somebody help me now a man you see
[1:27:30] just because the word come doesn't mean
[1:27:32] it's fulfilled I was listening to
[1:27:35] brother Ron Spencer that he shared
[1:27:38] recently about his daughter Whitney she
[1:27:41] was a girl that was born and with a with
[1:27:45] a certain with a certain age to a
[1:27:48] certain problem she was born with her
[1:27:51] her womb was this doctor said and I
[1:27:55] don't understand this but it was upside
[1:27:57] down and that she was born that way and
[1:28:01] and would never be able to have a child
[1:28:06] never so the doctors gave them
[1:28:10] absolutely no hope when she married her
[1:28:12] husband Dave he she said well you know
[1:28:14] the doctor said I can't have a baby he
[1:28:16] said I'm not marrying you for a baby I
[1:28:18] married you because I love you and he
[1:28:21] said so you know they they agreed in
[1:28:23] marriage and there was no no promise of
[1:28:27] a baby whatsoever she was she would be a
[1:28:30] barren woman and so they you know as
[1:28:34] they who committed their ways to the
[1:28:37] Lord and was serving him that one night
[1:28:41] in a prayer line their God gave a word
[1:28:45] to brother Ron that his daughter Whitney
[1:28:48] would bring forth a child and after that
[1:28:53] promise was given he said you know that
[1:28:57] her husband Davey on that tray was on
[1:29:02] January 1st I think that he he went to
[1:29:06] went to work
[1:29:07] and as he's going to work he hit some
[1:29:09] black ice spun him around and throwed
[1:29:13] him into a tree and there he hung upside
[1:29:16] down for for several hours until that
[1:29:19] when he was found and and they they
[1:29:21] rescued him and he was trying to figure
[1:29:23] out how to to do you know try to to get
[1:29:28] him down without injuring him worse
[1:29:30] that found that his shoulder was broken
[1:29:33] he had broken ribs and broken legs and
[1:29:36] he had a broken pelvis that was all was
[1:29:40] absolutely just pulverized and there
[1:29:44] there you know in that situation word
[1:29:49] that he was in and all the injuries in
[1:29:52] that area it made it look even more
[1:29:55] impossible and brother on even was as he
[1:30:01] was to giving this testimony he said I
[1:30:03] he said you don't know how many times
[1:30:06] the devil talked in my ear you know God
[1:30:12] gives a promise and many times you know
[1:30:16] it seems like a little bit of delay you
[1:30:19] don't know that devil talks right in
[1:30:21] your ear a man it'll never happen it'll
[1:30:25] never come it looks more impossible he

[1:30:34] husband now who's all messed up and and
[1:30:37] it is very seed life it's gone but you
[1:30:43] see what's impossible with man it's
[1:30:47] still possible with God and to those
[1:30:50] that believe hallelujah
[1:30:54] man what do you do in situations like
[1:30:57] that you keep on believing
[1:30:59] you'll never give up you look there
[1:31:02] though the pigeon Terry's yeah it shall
[1:31:06] come to pass
[1:31:07] wait for it a man cause he'll come in
[1:31:12] its season and God gives us a word but
[1:31:16] don't sometimes tell us what season it's
[1:31:18] gonna be fulfilled in but I tell you
[1:31:21] friends you're in the season our
[1:31:23] fulfillment
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:26] I remember cuz we are in an hour of
[1:31:29] restoration and in an hour of
[1:31:32] restoration that brings a season of
[1:31:35] fulfillment a man amen

[1:31:46] send me a picture of that miracle man a
[1:31:52] man even even to the point I'll tell you
[1:31:55] what a miracle it was the brother
[1:31:57] brother Ron was given the child's name
[1:31:59] told nobody just wrote it down in an
[1:32:01] envelope and there wouldn't when the
[1:32:04] baby was born and they named it he pulls
[1:32:06] out the envelope and sit here and it
[1:32:10] matched exactly God knows your name
[1:32:19] he knows the name of your child amen
[1:32:24] sometimes Eden's gotta wait for that
[1:32:26] predestinated seed to come to that
[1:32:28] predestinated egg a man to bring for the
[1:32:31] match but I'll tell you at the appointed
[1:32:34] time

[1:33:39] two hours just two hours and he gave up
[1:33:43] a man he forbidden his whole kingdom for
[1:33:47] two hours a man right on the verge of
[1:33:51] receiving it Amen oh my butt yeah but in
[1:33:59] now again you know he he waited way and
[1:34:03] he waited and he waited and he waited

[1:34:10] waiting a long time brother Jim I'm
[1:34:12] gonna just give up well you know I've
[1:34:15] got an answer for you people talk about
[1:34:18] giving up I'm just gonna give up okay
[1:34:20] well then why don't you why don't you
[1:34:24] what you give up sin the world your own
[1:34:28] ideas that your worship is hot dolla
[1:34:32] tree because we exalted over the Word of
[1:34:35] God what you just give up

[1:34:44] a confession yeah give up give up those
[1:34:47] things but don't you ever ever ever give
[1:34:51] up on the promise
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:35:00] the message came I remember what it
[1:35:04] meant to us but it's taken years of
[1:35:09] fulfillment but we're in the season
[1:35:15] hallelujah amen
[1:35:18] now as said Israel is not restored so
[1:35:23] that she recognizes her Messiah but
[1:35:26] she's in the season of it
[1:35:29] hey man the time has not yet been
[1:35:32] fulfilled we don't know the time but we
[1:35:35] know we're in the season why because we
[1:35:38] see the victory putting forth herb herb
[1:35:41] herb buds right amen so we see that
[1:35:45] there is signs of restoration and
[1:35:49] seasons of restoration and we see
[1:35:53] there's processes and and all of these
[1:35:56] things as we the cogs of God's wheels of
[1:35:59] prophecy just continue to grind slow but
[1:36:03] sure heading toward the fulfillment
[1:36:06] there's a word that's laying out there
[1:36:09] that she'll be taken into her place by
[1:36:12] two wings the wings of two prophets that
[1:36:16] will take him put her in her place
[1:36:19] hey ma'am hey man also let me just tell
[1:36:23] you that's what God sent you today is he
[1:36:25] sent you a message an eagle message gave
[1:36:30] you the wings of an eagle where you can
[1:36:32] fly into your place are you with me hey
[1:36:37] man yeah it's a prophetic message but
[1:36:39] let me tell you it rides it rides on
[1:36:42] spirit and in truth I'm an you know how
[1:36:49] how we have looked and seen as I you
[1:36:53] know when I was a boy we learned a very
[1:36:54] tactics of keeping a bird in a pen we
[1:37:00] learned what to do to get it off balance
[1:37:02] we'd have an old chicken who wouldn't
[1:37:04] stay in the pen and Amman we
[1:37:06] flyout right over the top of it well you
[1:37:09] know we want that chicken to stay in the
[1:37:11] pen so what we did is we just slipped in
[1:37:15] at night when it was sleep on the coop
[1:37:17] on the roost in the coop and we would
[1:37:20] take that chicken and we would just take
[1:37:23] one wing just one and we would we would
[1:37:28] trim it we'd cut it right back you try
[1:37:32] not to get into the quick because
[1:37:34] they're like a fingernail on the
[1:37:35] feathers and you can make them bleed but
[1:37:38] if we get right down there and just cut
[1:37:39] off them feathers harmless didn't hurt
[1:37:41] the chicken but it couldn't fly it would
[1:37:44] just flop around and round and round and
[1:37:47] go to try to fly it could never get off
[1:37:49] the lever couldn't lift off the ground
[1:37:51] he just flying around in a circle and
[1:37:53] fall right back down and I tell you too
[1:37:58] long we have had that you know in the
[1:38:01] message are you with me if we go back
[1:38:04] and look in the pentecostal chickens
[1:38:06] over there
[1:38:07] those birds Amanda what they did is they
[1:38:11] just trimmed true thoughts and they had
[1:38:14] a lot of spirit and they flop around and
[1:38:17] round in the circle they couldn't move
[1:38:20] they couldn't fly they couldn't get out
[1:38:22] of the fence man but I tell you what
[1:38:26] they've done to these but the Eagles to
[1:38:28] keep them earthbound they didn't they
[1:38:30] didn't do truths they did spirit and
[1:38:33] we've seen a lot of the spirit been
[1:38:36] trimmed off you know we can't have
[1:38:40] divine healings we don't have no altar
[1:38:42] calls we don't we don't have no prayer
[1:38:45] meeting we don't have the working of the
[1:38:47] Spirit we don't want none of those
[1:38:49] things and they cut that off and what
[1:38:51] can the church do it can't fly are you
[1:38:57] with me it takes spirit and truth it
[1:39:01] takes mechanics and we've done a good
[1:39:03] job building up the wings of the
[1:39:06] mechanics
[1:39:07] and we topped the seals that we talked
[1:39:10] the mysteries we've been real heavy on
[1:39:12] that side and neglected the spirit side
[1:39:15] but it's gonna take two wings if you're
[1:39:18] gonna fly hey man we got a bunch of fat

[1:44:22] another message this one works it works
[1:44:28] as I've said before when brother branham
[1:44:31] left the scene he left us a car that was
[1:44:33] running he didn't leave us one with all
[1:44:38] mechanics in no spark he didn't leave us
[1:44:42] one with all spark and no and no
[1:44:44] mechanics no word he left us a car that
[1:44:48] would drive it would drive down to the
[1:44:51] Holy Ghost it would drive to divine
[1:44:54] healing a man it would drive anywhere
[1:44:59] you would need to go a man because he
[1:45:03] left a car in good mechanical order and
[1:45:07] brothers you don't have to tamper with
[1:45:09] it by trying to read between the lines
[1:45:13] and trying to plan something it ain't in
[1:45:16] the manual ma'am but just take the
[1:45:20] manual take the message I'll apply the
[1:45:22] mat-su don't need fixin you need fixin
[1:45:27] [Applause]
[1:45:33] hey man but he left us a car that's
[1:45:36] running and I'll tell you this morning
[1:45:39] hey man if we don't
[1:45:40] maybe we'll get the mechanics back in
[1:45:42] the way that brother branham had it and
[1:45:44] the dynamics the way brother branham had
[1:45:47] it what we believe in healing again
[1:45:52] miracles again signs again the Holy
[1:45:55] Ghost again the power of God again hey
[1:45:59] man I'll tell you you can start that
[1:46:01] engine and it'll just occur and hit on
[1:46:03] 16 cylinders because it Jesus hit on 16
[1:46:07] cylinders so we'll divide whatever he
[1:46:11] did she'll do the same thing
[1:46:14] mmm so the message came but of course
[1:46:19] it's been years of fulfillment but we're
[1:46:22] in the season amen
[1:46:26] we're in the season we're in the season
[1:46:34] look stand up how old are you 17
[1:46:41] would you know like the Lord to come
[1:46:44] when I was 17 I would
[1:46:48] that's when I turned electricity on in
[1:46:51] this church they're still fighting
[1:47:40] classic toys the RV fight take your
[1:47:44] sword against reality
[1:47:46] [Applause]
[1:48:05] Louie Terry it shall come to pass a man
[1:48:11] restoration is still owned the holy
[1:48:14] ghost is still falling the spirit of
[1:48:17] time is still here there's a shot at the
[1:48:19] king in the myths that's the holy cows
[1:48:22] where can among these people there's a
[1:48:25] way blue and that there's a new
[1:48:27] generation that can move with the Holy
[1:48:31] Spirit
[1:48:32] [Applause]
[1:48:41] hallelujah hallelujah it's the word of
[1:48:49] promise word to promise the message has
[1:48:54] come yet Israel is not yet restored so
[1:49:01] that she recognizes her Messiah but the
[1:49:05] fig tree is putting forth its branches
[1:49:10] we could see a little tiny signs I don't
[1:49:14] know about you but in the spring
[1:49:16] sometimes especially when the winter has
[1:49:20] been long and wet and rainy and storming
[1:49:23] and all the other stuff I go to looking
[1:49:30] for spring I go to looking for signs of
[1:49:34] restoration I rejoice when I see the
[1:49:38] first daffodil stick up its head and
[1:49:41] start shining I say all glory ain't
[1:49:45] spring yet but it's coming hey man I go
[1:49:49] and I look and I see some of the other
[1:49:51] precautious little trees that that meant
[1:49:54] that our head of some of those others
[1:49:56] and I finally see another one come and
[1:50:00] this is where that might I see a red bud
[1:50:03] begin to put forth its blues kind of say
[1:50:07] spring is Klaus and then we're in the
[1:50:10] season it hey man and I hear Wars going

[1:50:39] I'm a boy long that no man winners gonna
[1:50:43] go back to his home be chased back by
[1:50:46] the warm winds of spring and restoration

[1:50:53] the Sun has provided the light to let it
[1:50:57] happen and I'm gonna tell you Turks we
[1:51:00] are in the season a restoration because
[1:51:03] the Sun has provided the light
[1:51:13] [Applause]
[1:51:19] war against it till it flies it out so
[1:51:26] that wind you're feeling this morning
[1:51:28] it's just one of those resistance to Old
[1:51:33] Man Winter that wants to make you barren
[1:51:38] and cold and worship like Amish or
[1:51:42] Baptists hello somebody get the old
[1:51:50] Amish out of your bones today I'm old
[1:51:54] order yeah you're all right
[1:51:58] oh hey you know you don't know about me
[1:52:02] you know I do know about you you need a
[1:52:05] good dose of the Holy Ghost limber up
[1:52:10] and move with the spirit of God get an
[1:52:13] action invincible damn your needs
[1:52:17] ranging around here we'll start praying
[1:52:19] then the groaning ain't going to do it
[1:52:24] the complaining ain't going to do it but
[1:52:27] when you get the callin on heaven
[1:52:29] Kevin's gonna serve on them - yeah are
[1:52:33] you with me now so you see it is as we
[1:52:37] say it you know Israel's not yet
[1:52:40] restored but we see the fig tree now the
[1:52:43] Bible said that when you see the fig
[1:52:46] tree and you can read it yourself and
[1:52:49] all the other trees when you see the fig
[1:52:53] tree and all the other trees so it's not
[1:52:56] as Israel hey man it's all the other
[1:53:01] trees man they begin to put forth their
[1:53:04] buds mountain you know even around here
[1:53:09] our pecan is about the last one to come
[1:53:11] out you know in Italy it'll ignore
[1:53:14] everybody else and standard land will
[1:53:18] not come out until it finally finally
[1:53:21] begrudgingly puts forth a little oh okay
[1:53:26] let me check and see if the temperatures
[1:53:29] just right it's okay it's okay to be a
[1:53:34] pecan tree then make good then make good
[1:53:37] pies come on out
[1:53:41] [Applause]
[1:53:42] you never come out you're dead cuz I'm
[1:53:53] telling you the dark ages that killed
[1:54:18] the life out of me I've got laughing me
[1:54:20] here it comes here it comes
[1:54:23] hey man now Israel is the type and we
[1:54:31] are the anti-type answer type means that
[1:54:35] we're the fulfillment of the type so you
[1:54:38] have a type and then the Anna type and
[1:54:43] the type means I'm no type I'm not
[1:54:47] typing I'm the fulfillment a man I'm a
[1:54:52] match to the type but I'm not a type and
[1:54:58] man a type is a shadow of good things to
[1:55:01] come it's an allegory in this example
[1:55:04] but but again you know an anti-type is
[1:55:08] the fulfillment I want to tell you a man
[1:55:12] we're we're reaching the time we're
[1:55:13] tights running out and when this amount
[1:55:17] of time of typing another generation to
[1:55:20] come man we're not typing we are the
[1:55:25] other type they do we can look back and
[1:55:28] say they were type they were tight why
[1:55:31] even Luther was a type of justification
[1:55:34] Wesley was a type of sanctification
[1:55:36] Pentecost was a type of Pentecost hey
[1:55:41] man oh you say brother different type of
[1:55:44] Benegal yeah in a way well you know a
[1:55:46] shadow doesn't show you all the real
[1:55:48] details in fact you can get the shadows
[1:55:50] in right now I'm looking the way the
[1:55:53] lights is hitting this
[1:55:54] now I've got about three or four hands
[1:55:55] there on the desk in my shadow well that
[1:55:59] ain't the way it is kind of reminds me
[1:56:04] today I was trying to I was trying to
[1:56:07] listen to something coming down we were
[1:56:10] listening to to enlighten and a lot of
[1:56:13] times on Sunday morning they'll have you
[1:56:16] know some pretty decent songs I you know
[1:56:19] the about taken they've got taking a
[1:56:22] this Southern Gospel and turned it in to
[1:56:25] Country Gospel and is a tear in my beer
[1:56:28] and we were doing this and doing that
[1:56:29] and you know some story and whatever
[1:56:32] it's not about Jesus no more it likes a
[1:56:35] lot of inspiration a man likes a lot of
[1:56:41] inspiration and though you know but I'm
[1:56:43] listening to some some of those songs
[1:56:45] and here they come out I'll say well
[1:56:47] that's a pretty good group the
[1:56:49] Collinsworth holy holy holy
[1:56:53] Blessed Holy Trinity God in three
[1:56:57] persons Holy Trinity or Blessed Trinity
[1:57:03] where's a good song I just turned the
[1:57:07] thing off and I said three persons
[1:57:11] there's never been gods not three
[1:57:14] persons let me tell you what you got
[1:57:17] here you got a one God Bible this is not
[1:57:22] a to Lord Bible it's not a three God
[1:57:25] Bible it's not a to God Bible it's not a
[1:57:29] three person Bible amen it's where God
[1:57:33] was a person in Christ so you got God
[1:57:37] the spirit who was a person in Christ
[1:57:41] are you with me man that's a one God
[1:57:44] Bible but I tell you what you know they
[1:57:49] get all confused as we go along you know
[1:57:53] even on what the Godhead is about and I
[1:57:57] don't find the worship in that now but I
[1:58:00] want you to understand that as we as I
[1:58:04] said you know we we got a hunger in our
[1:58:07] heart we're looking for that restoration
[1:58:10] for that for that we're in the season of
[1:58:13] the rapture
[1:58:14] but it's but not truly the time of the
[1:58:18] rapture now that's where people get
[1:58:20] confused so the Lord has come the temple
[1:58:23] you believe the Lord has already come no
[1:58:25] I don't believe he's already come I
[1:58:27] believe that he is appeared and he
[1:58:32] appeared in a prophet bringing the
[1:58:35] message and we heard a message he come
[1:58:38] in Word form to a prophet that's his
[1:58:41] appearing man I believe he's hearing
[1:58:45] Brad form but that's still not as coming
[1:58:48] so well now the bride coming to Christ
[1:58:50] yeah is Chris Christ coming as a bride
[1:58:52] in bride form but it's his appearing in
[1:58:55] his people hey man I just heard about he
[1:58:59] he appeared the other day in the
[1:59:01] Philippines I heard that he's appearing
[1:59:04] in Japan I hear that he's appearing and
[1:59:09] evening like Tabernacle I hear that he
[1:59:13] appeared and brain bleeds left and
[1:59:16] alopecia was cured and cancer went and I
[1:59:20] trouble when I hear that he appeared in
[1:59:25] our youth camp and Devils couldn't stay
[1:59:29] I've shared that that there was a people
[1:59:33] in his dead casting out Devils using his
[1:59:37] name acting in his stead delegated
[1:59:41] authority via haven't been filled with
[1:59:44] the Holy Ghost
[1:59:45] that's his appearing but he's still
[1:59:47] coming we're in the season of his coming
[1:59:52] if he didn't come with a if he didn't
[1:59:55] appear in the inward form to a prophet
[1:59:58] well then we would still be you know
[2:00:01] trying to make this a three God Bible
[2:00:05] are you with me hey man if he didn't if
[2:00:09] he didn't do that if he didn't bring a
[2:00:11] word that wouldn't be a bride because
[2:00:13] the bride is a creation from that word
[2:00:15] going forth you might have missed that
[2:00:19] but you are the spoken word the original
[2:00:23] see not denominational see but the
[2:00:27] original seed a member cuz a message
[2:00:31] come and this day that actually spoke
[2:00:34] you into existence
[2:00:36] you did not let me say it again the
[2:00:39] bride of this last day did not exist
[2:00:43] until a prophet came and when he brought
[2:00:48] a message it spoke a bride into
[2:00:53] existence
[2:00:54] you are the existence of the spoken word
[2:00:59] people bride now so if it hadn't gotten
[2:01:07] to prophet well then in this in the
[2:01:10] season and the season if you hadn't come
[2:01:15] to a prophet there be no bride if there
[2:01:17] was no bride there would be no one
[2:01:19] living to come for now you get a you
[2:01:24] know forget what we're talking about in
[2:01:25] the sense of their ages we know there's
[2:01:27] a bride in every age we're not talking
[2:01:29] about that we're talking about the
[2:01:30] living bride and if there wouldn't be a
[2:01:33] prophet comes there wouldn't be a people
[2:01:35] ready prepared for his coming is that
[2:01:41] right
[2:01:41] so we've the season then brought a
[2:01:44] profit on the season and then the season
[2:01:47] opens up and what happened then from
[2:01:50] that coming out that prophet listen it's
[2:01:53] the seventh seal which is to come to the
[2:01:55] Lord which is the you know if brother
[2:01:58] Branham told us it is like a candlestick
[2:01:59] going up and up as it breaks the silence
[2:02:02] and make it known to mysteries and one
[2:02:05] of the mysteries God had in his mind was
[2:02:07] I'm gonna have a bride in this last day
[2:02:09] that a match this one over here in the
[2:02:12] beginning and she matched Christ so this
[2:02:18] one match Christ so this is one the
[2:02:22] mysteries you got to understand the
[2:02:24] mystery is I'm not calling a
[2:02:27] denomination you remember in Paul would
[2:02:31] would say now I'm gonna preach you the
[2:02:34] mystery of Christ I'm gonna preach you
[2:02:38] the mystery of Christ and then preaching
[2:02:41] you the mystery of Christ I'm going to
[2:02:42] show you that God's gonna call a people
[2:02:44] out of the Gentiles
[2:02:46] sake so now God does the same thing that
[2:02:49] when we come back to Paul's gospel again
[2:02:51] he shows us to give the mystery I'm
[2:02:55] gonna call a people back to the homeland
[2:03:00] back to the Word of God come on I've
[2:03:04] ever tried nascent people wherever
[2:03:07] they're scattered I mean wherever my
[2:03:10] seat has been dispersed I'm gonna call
[2:03:12] them all back to the homeland why are we
[2:03:15] here why are we here the same reason the
[2:03:20] Jews are there so the Messiah can be
[2:03:23] revealed to them Wow have we returned
[2:03:27] back to the homeland not just so we can
[2:03:29] have the fruits of it of healing and
[2:03:31] miracles and signs and wonders but know
[2:03:33] what we can have more than that where
[2:03:35] the Messiah will come where the season
[2:03:39] will give way to the time hallelujah so
[2:03:45] now we are in the season of the rapture
[2:03:48] but not truly in the time of the rapture
[2:03:51] now there again I'm not I'm not even
[2:03:55] trying to to argue quotes with unions
[2:03:58] while I got a quote we're brother Brent
[2:03:59] said this is a wrap your time that's not
[2:04:01] what I'm talking about the time of the
[2:04:03] rapture is that at that moment when
[2:04:06] we're changed when when we are caught up
[2:04:10] to meet the Lord and we see him that's
[2:04:14] still our Blessed hope and no matter how
[2:04:17] much he come in a prophet born
[2:04:19] it ain't complete yet no matter how much
[2:04:22] he's here in Bradford it ain't complete
[2:04:25] yet it's not gonna be complete a time
[2:04:27] isn't gonna be fulfilled for the rapture
[2:04:30] until we see him
[2:04:33] as he is and when we see them we shall
[2:04:37] be like him are you with me now so now
[2:04:41] we are having these times season times
[2:04:45] of refreshing being made ready by
[2:04:48] repentance hey man now I'm not gonna
[2:04:53] preach long this morning so hold on your
[2:04:54] seat but if they just want to ask you
[2:04:59] today is there a true ambassador to the
[2:05:04] world that will hold up your Bible to

[2:15:58] commended their celebration of the
[2:16:00] Passover with a toast next year John I
[2:16:05] said next year Jerusalem be quite honest
[2:16:15] with you if those people down there in
[2:16:18] that Sabbath over there in California in
[2:16:21] that synagogue if they don't obey the
[2:16:25] Word of God they wouldn't have been
[2:16:26] there when a gunman came in here to
[2:16:29] found the empty synagogue if they would
[2:16:34] have heard and listened and obeyed the
[2:16:36] call I'm not condoning what was done not
[2:16:42] by any means but you know right over
[2:16:44] here in California gunman goes in there
[2:16:46] and just goes shooting them you know as
[2:16:49] they're in their Passover services
[2:16:55] killing people indiscriminately
[2:17:02] if I uh don't let me die on the homeland
[2:17:07] I sure don't want to die in California
[2:17:14] man if I die let me die in my homeland

[2:18:01] theology that's price dead and put up by
[2:18:04] the roots let me die
[2:18:08] believe in this word yesterday today
[2:18:12] forever and people be able to say Tim
[2:18:22] Burton gave his life and his last breath
[2:18:26] defending his promise
[2:18:31] possessing his land that should no
[2:18:40] longer be the cry of the Jews next year
[2:18:42] Jerusalem hey Matt you know what they
[2:18:46] ought to be shouting you know what
[2:18:48] they'll be saying that at now in their
[2:18:52] homeland there is it take their Passover
[2:18:56] next year
[2:18:57] Temple Mount next year the prophets that
[2:19:05] are promised next year the Messiah
[2:19:09] that's what they ought to be saying now
[2:19:11] and then it shouldn't be it meant
[2:19:13] tourism we ought to be able to say Dell
[2:19:15] they'd be able to say we have Jerusalem
[2:19:17] but next year we want more than
[2:19:21] Jerusalem I'm on that ought to be it you
[2:19:27] know again you know not next year
[2:19:29] that was the word the word reveal the
[2:19:32] words been revealed we're in the
[2:19:35] homeland we ought to say that God let me
[2:19:38] be in that place
[2:19:41] they meant expand my borders and say
[2:19:45] let's hear the body change this year
[2:19:49] next year coming up on the millennial
[2:19:53] reign then that year Eden again cry
[2:20:00] resonated out of our hearts next year
[2:20:06] we'll expand our borders does that bring
[2:20:11] this down these few last dots I want you
[2:20:14] to stay with me for a moment just give
[2:20:17] me just a little more time the Land of
[2:20:20] Israel became a desolate desolate desert
[2:20:25] became a Holland wilderness because the
[2:20:30] people lost the connection to the word
[2:20:33] therefore they lost their connection to
[2:20:37] their homeland
[2:20:40] I'm and of course as I've said for much
[2:20:46] of the ages the the land of promise of
[2:20:51] the Holy Ghost became a desolate desert
[2:20:54] in a howling wilderness because the
[2:20:59] people left the word and the dispersal
[2:21:06] of course didn't leave the Jewish people
[2:21:09] in a good spiritual condition it left
[2:21:13] them in a even more hardened heart and
[2:21:17] unbelief the dispersal down to Babylon
[2:21:21] that happened before Jesus came you know
[2:21:24] in the times of Daniel you read of him
[2:21:26] Jeremiah so on like that word the
[2:21:29] dispersal was going on down to Babylon
[2:21:32] it was there in Babylon that they kind
[2:21:37] of because they had no temple to worship
[2:21:39] in they created synagogues in the
[2:21:43] formation of Pharisees and Sadducees
[2:21:47] shall I say denominations begin to form
[2:21:51] because of the dispersal they were out
[2:21:54] of their homeland and out of the place
[2:21:57] of true worship and so it brought about
[2:22:01] that that you know there again it
[2:22:04] brought about formations of synagogues
[2:22:06] where that each had an independent rabbi
[2:22:11] spewing out his own thoughts nonsense so
[2:22:18] rather than being united under God they
[2:22:22] either actually became in the dispersal
[2:22:24] further away from God are you with me
[2:22:28] and so you went out with different
[2:22:30] synagogues and different ones with
[2:22:33] different rabbis and independent rabbis
[2:22:35] and each one with their ideas and they
[2:22:38] would give their lectures and they were
[2:22:39] these were the synagogue's that Jesus
[2:22:42] would go to and that he would go to the
[2:22:46] synagogues in and he would bring his his
[2:22:49] message
[2:22:50] now the dispersal from the lamb brought
[2:22:54] about the rejection of their Messiah
[2:22:58] because it brought about the acceptance
[2:23:01] of the sayings of the rabbi's creeds of
[2:23:05] men that exalted those Creed's to a
[2:23:08] greater position than the actual Word of
[2:23:11] God itself you see you have with the
[2:23:15] Jews you you have them who have the the
[2:23:19] literal word that was given and then you
[2:23:22] have the oral law a law of traditions
[2:23:26] passed down from their from their elders
[2:23:30] right on down and so you have the world
[2:23:34] and you have their oral law that they it
[2:23:37] steamed over the word itself now you
[2:23:41] with me now
[2:23:42] so you know again again um I just want
[2:23:47] to kind of bring that down for a moment
[2:23:49] because this is what the Jews would do
[2:23:51] Jesus said by your traditions by your
[2:23:56] oral laws that you've extreme greater
[2:24:00] than the written word itself you have
[2:24:04] you have you have made the Word of God
[2:24:08] by those traditions of none effect is
[2:24:12] everybody with me right now
[2:24:14] now you know it said about the message
[2:24:17] movement that that we have the Bible and
[2:24:21] that we also accept William branham's
[2:24:24] sermons as as oral on scriptures and I
[2:24:29] didn't want to address that while we're
[2:24:31] here just a moment because many times we
[2:24:35] quote from the prophet of God and we
[2:24:37] speak but let me tell you we never exalt
[2:24:41] exalt there are words even of a prophet
[2:24:45] above the word of God
[2:24:48] now we are moving those that wants to
[2:24:52] make that the message the absolute the
[2:24:55] Bible is our absolute that was brother
[2:24:58] branham's absolute that is our absolute
[2:25:01] and many of you and he taught us if you
[2:25:04] get an idea from something that I've
[2:25:07] said that is contrary this Bible you
[2:25:10] forget your idea and come back to the
[2:25:13] Word of God oh man we got to base it on
[2:25:17] the word come on somebody hey man we
[2:25:20] can't base it on an oral tradition we
[2:25:23] must base it on the written word of God
[2:25:28] amen so the message was not to connect
[2:25:32] us to a prophet but to connect us by
[2:25:35] that prophet back to the word again hey
[2:25:39] man are you with me and brother branham
[2:25:41] brought a message that is exactly in
[2:25:43] harmony with the Bible and if you get
[2:25:47] something out of it
[2:25:48] that's contrary to the Bible you ain't
[2:25:51] understanding it right and you need to
[2:25:54] quit reading between the lines and go
[2:25:56] back to what was said on the line are
[2:26:00] you with me now
[2:26:01] but now so now likewise as Israel when
[2:26:06] did their dispersal likewise the early
[2:26:09] church was a mighty church it was a
[2:26:12] fruitful church with signs and wonders
[2:26:15] miracles dedicated lies you didn't lie
[2:26:19] on the Holy Ghost in that church you got
[2:26:22] hauled away dead like Ananias and
[2:26:24] Sapphira and made the church stay pretty
[2:26:27] clean amen
[2:26:30] but it wasn't long until the land with
[2:26:32] his promised fruits were left barren a
[2:26:35] howling wilderness and wasteland
[2:26:37] unfruitful and the people were dispersed
[2:26:40] pulled away captive down into spiritual
[2:26:44] Babylon and doing so they lost their
[2:26:47] connection with the book the word and
[2:26:53] they even forsook this one God Bible for
[2:26:59] multiple dear
[2:27:01] but I got some news for you we have
[2:27:04] returned because there was a word that
[2:27:09] was said I will restore sayeth the Lord
[2:27:13] and we are not a part of the dispersal
[2:27:17] we are part of the return and there's
[2:27:25] some ambassadors in this building this
