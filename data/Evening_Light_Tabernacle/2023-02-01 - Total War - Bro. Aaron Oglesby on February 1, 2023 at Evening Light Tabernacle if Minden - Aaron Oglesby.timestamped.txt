[38:04] Lord asking that you would come and

[38:07] Lord these people have come out on this
[38:09] cold rainy night Lord and they didn't
[38:10] come to see or hear from me
[38:12] but Lord they came to hear from almighty
[38:14] God
[38:15] Lord and I believe Lord that that's
[38:17] exactly what will happen if we can yield
[38:19] ourselves Lord because you promised to
[38:21] be in our midst you promised Lord that
[38:24] you would come I'm asking you now to
[38:26] break the bread of life Lord to move me
[38:27] out the way Lord and to speak words of
[38:30] life
[38:31] Lord we each one have our own battles
[38:33] and our struggles but Lord we stand here
[38:35] tonight knowing that you'll never leave
[38:36] us or never forsake us so Lord tonight
[38:39] may we just walk for a while with you
[38:41] may you speak to us and strengthen each
[38:44] one Lord in our time of need we thank
[38:46] you father in Jesus name we pray
[38:51] if you have your Bibles with you we're
[38:52] going to get
[38:54] directly into the word and start in
[38:56] Deuteronomy the seventh chapter in the
[38:59] first verse
[39:00] Deuteronomy the seventh chapter
[39:03] and the first verse
[39:08] and it says when the Lord thy God shall
[39:11] bring thee into the land whether thou
[39:13] goest to possess it and hath cast out
[39:16] many nations before Thee the Hittites
[39:19] and the gergisites and the amorites and
[39:21] the Canaanites and the parasites and the
[39:23] hivites and the jebusites Seven Nations
[39:27] greater and mightier than thou and when
[39:30] the Lord thy God shall deliver them
[39:32] before thee Thou shalt Smite them and
[39:34] utterly destroy them Thou shalt make no
[39:37] Covenant with them nor show Mercy unto
[39:41] them
[39:42] and I pray the Lord I add His blessings
[39:43] to the word as you take your seats
[39:49] we see here the Lord is is speaking of
[39:52] what he's going to do as it relates to
[39:55] the taking of the land of promise and I
[39:59] like here how he speaks in no uncertain
[40:01] terms but it is extremely
[40:03] straightforward almost as if this goes
[40:07] without saying I shouldn't even have to
[40:09] tell you this almost is the tone in
[40:11] which he's speaking in and he says when
[40:14] I bring you into the land there there is
[40:17] no wondering here not if and maybe if
[40:19] everything goes right and if we stick
[40:21] according to the plan he says when when
[40:25] I bring you into the land and then again
[40:27] in verse 2 he says and when the Lord
[40:31] shall deliver them before thee this is
[40:35] how our God operates tonight and I think
[40:37] we need to start operating in a not well
[40:39] if I'm Healed and if this happens and if
[40:42] my son returns and if my daughter and if
[40:44] we but when my son returns and and when
[40:47] my healing is manifested and when
[40:49] because says it's a certainty and it's a
[40:51] thing that is going to take place and
[40:54] and when our God speaks his word or
[40:57] whenever he he makes a promise that word
[41:00] is going to come to pass no matter what
[41:03] he has to do in order to bring it to
[41:05] pass he will move Heaven he will move
[41:08] Earth but he's not going to speak a word
[41:10] and allow it to return unto him void
[41:12] he's going to do whatever it takes he
[41:15] told Abraham there in the scripture that
[41:17] his seed would sojourn in a Strange Land
[41:19] for for 400 years but after that they
[41:22] would be delivered in that and that they
[41:24] had a land that they would go to and
[41:26] that it was going to be theirs and now
[41:28] there's an awful lot of things if as you
[41:30] look through the scriptures that lined
[41:32] up in the way of that Deliverance but
[41:35] that Deliverance had already been spoken
[41:37] and so it didn't matter that things came
[41:40] and lined up in the way things came and
[41:41] lined up in the way of their Journey to
[41:43] the promised land it came in lined up in
[41:46] the way of them actually possessing the
[41:48] promised land when they got there but
[41:49] let's listen and to put it in these
[41:51] terms Our God doesn't play games okay
[41:53] when he puts Something In Motion when he
[41:56] starts a war he don't play War he's
[41:58] going to war to win once he has spoken
[42:01] there's nothing off limits as to what he
[42:04] will do listen Pharaoh thought that he
[42:06] could stop them from leaving but it
[42:08] already been spoken they would be
[42:09] delivered so Pharaoh comes and lies up
[42:11] himself against almighty God and his
[42:13] kingdom is totally destroyed the Red Sea
[42:16] got in the way and thought it could do
[42:18] something but God looked at the Red Sea
[42:20] through Angry Eyes and the Red Sea had
[42:22] to roll back they needed water on the
[42:24] journey so water flowed from a rock they
[42:27] needed food on the journey so food
[42:28] rained down out of Heaven it didn't
[42:31] matter what stood in their way God had
[42:33] already spoken so he would do whatever
[42:35] it took to bring it to pass they reached
[42:38] the Jordan and the Jordan was in flood
[42:40] stage but guess what it rolled back and
[42:42] they strolled across it on dry ground
[42:44] Jericho stood in their way but Jericho's
[42:47] walls had to fall what am I telling you
[42:49] to night I don't know what you're facing
[42:52] but it's gonna move I don't know what's
[42:54] standing in your way but it's got to go
[42:56] because there's already been a word
[42:57] spoken over you there's already been a
[43:00] word spoken over this bride there will
[43:02] be a Rapture there will be Victory and
[43:04] God's gonna do whatever he has to do to
[43:07] bring it to pass
[43:10] you say but but you don't understand my
[43:12] problems they're really stacking up and
[43:14] the odds don't look so good
[43:17] hey I can relate but let's go back to
[43:19] the scripture here because God tells
[43:21] them there are seven different nations
[43:24] there and all seven of them are greater
[43:28] than you
[43:29] in other words he says not only are
[43:31] there seven of them but even if there
[43:33] was only one that one would whoop you
[43:36] but there are seven of them that could
[43:38] whoop you and they're all waiting on you
[43:40] these Seven Nations are greater and
[43:42] mightier and thou know listen here's one
[43:45] thing I love the strength of your
[43:47] enemies only magnifies the strength of
[43:50] our god it only serves to show how
[43:53] strong our God is the battle you're in
[43:55] is only going to bring glory to God it's
[43:57] only going to magnify how strong he is
[43:59] because he is going to bring you through
[44:02] that and as soon as he lets them know we
[44:04] touched on this last time as soon as he
[44:06] lets them know that they can't defeat
[44:08] them that they're too strong that
[44:10] there's seven of them and that this is
[44:12] impossible he follows that out by going
[44:14] but when I deliver them done to you but
[44:17] when you are victorious when I come and
[44:19] fight the battle when I do these things
[44:22] church is not it but it is when our
[44:26] promises are going to be fulfilled
[44:28] and I say tonight that he will withhold
[44:30] no resource
[44:33] he will leave no stone unturned
[44:36] and he will employ whatever force is
[44:38] necessary to ensure that everything that
[44:42] he has said about you and everything
[44:44] that he said about this bride will come
[44:46] to pass
[44:48] well brother Aaron is it going to be
[44:50] easy not a chance
[44:52] not a chance that it's going to be easy
[44:53] because we are in a battle we are in a
[44:56] constant War but the Lord said I'm going
[44:59] to deliver the enemy into your hands so
[45:01] it's not going to be easy but just don't
[45:03] be found running away don't be found
[45:05] laying your weapon now just be found
[45:07] fighting tonight and he says he will
[45:10] deliver the enemy into your hands
[45:13] and then it says you got a job to do
[45:17] Thou shalt Smite them
[45:21] he's going to deliver them but Thou
[45:23] shalt Smite them brother Branham says
[45:26] remember we are not on a picnic
[45:28] but we're in a battlefield many people
[45:31] think that when they become a Christian
[45:33] that that's all they need to do
[45:36] that that settles it forever as they are
[45:38] a Christian and everything's going to
[45:40] come easy don't ever get that in your
[45:43] head he says
[45:45] for I become a Christian to fight the
[45:48] good fight of faith I become a Christian
[45:50] to get in the battle lines
[45:52] he says no Satan will constantly punch
[45:55] at you now listen to this for those of
[45:58] us who get the wowzy wowzy Woos and
[45:59] think I'm the only one going through
[46:01] this and I'm the only one and I'm the
[46:03] only one here's the prophet of God
[46:05] saying Satan will constantly punch at
[46:08] you until you're finished here on the
[46:10] Earth
[46:12] wow where's the good news
[46:17] constantly punch at you he says just
[46:20] remember that you'll never
[46:23] I know this is almost depressing you'll
[46:26] never have a Time
[46:33] because
[46:35] a battle
[46:36] did you ask to come to Christ to go on a
[46:38] picnic well you're sure going to be
[46:40] surprised because it's a constant battle
[46:43] I've been on the field for 31 years and
[46:46] I fought every inch of the way that's
[46:48] right Israel had to fight every inch of
[46:50] the way Palestine was given to them but
[46:53] they had to fight every inch of the way
[46:57] to get it
[46:59] so listen I hate to be a downer tonight
[47:01] but things ain't fixing to get better
[47:04] things ain't fixing to get easier
[47:06] but the same God that said I'm gonna
[47:08] deliver it into their hands the enemy is
[47:11] the same God tonight he's the same
[47:13] yesterday today and forever he hasn't
[47:15] left us fighting alone it may not get
[47:18] easy but you're gonna win you're gonna
[47:20] be victorious you are going to overcome
[47:24] things aren't getting easier but that's
[47:26] okay because he's pouring out exactly
[47:28] what we have need of he's given us the
[47:30] strength to take another step he's given
[47:32] us the strength to overcome he's given
[47:34] us the strength to keep on fighting
[47:38] I'm thankful tonight that we serve a god
[47:41] of Total War
[47:45] and that's what I'm going to speak to
[47:47] you all tonight for a little bit is
[47:48] Total War
[47:50] Total War
[47:52] it is his attitude towards battle
[47:56] it is his attitude towards attaining
[47:58] Victory and he wants it to be your
[48:01] attitude as well
[48:02] whatever it takes
[48:05] whatever it takes listen he didn't stop
[48:07] short and send somebody else to do his
[48:09] bidding he said it's going to take my
[48:11] life then I'll give my life he says
[48:13] their healing is going to take Stripes
[48:15] then I'll take the stripes he was
[48:17] willing to do whatever it took to bring
[48:19] Victory and he wants a people who are
[48:21] willing to do whatever it takes to
[48:23] attain that victory of people that won't
[48:25] back up a people that won't give in of
[48:27] people that in the most dark and evil
[48:29] age when people are ridiculed and people
[48:31] are making fun of even people in your
[48:33] own rakes are calling you fanatic you
[48:35] say that's okay I'm gonna do whatever it
[48:37] takes to get to the other side I'm going
[48:40] to do whatever it takes to get there I'm
[48:42] totally sold out I'm totally invested
[48:44] because I want a total Victory and I'm
[48:47] telling you you're in a war and if you
[48:49] want to win it it must be Total War
[48:55] he wants a people totally committed
[48:57] totally surrendered
[48:59] willing to do whatever it takes willing
[49:03] to do whatever he commands even when we
[49:05] do not understand
[49:07] even when what He commands
[49:10] Cuts Us in the process
[49:12] [Music]
[49:14] whatever it takes
[49:16] tonight you can't allow anything to get
[49:19] in the way of you and total and complete
[49:22] victory
[49:23] what did he say there at the end of the
[49:25] opening verse he said Thou shalt Smite
[49:28] them
[49:28] and utterly destroy them
[49:31] Thou shalt make no Covenant with them
[49:33] nor show Mercy unto them listen you read
[49:38] this and I'll tell you it's time tonight
[49:39] to recognize that we're not playing
[49:41] games that we're not playing church this
[49:44] devil that we're fighting isn't taking
[49:45] it easy on you he isn't taking it easy
[49:48] on your family he isn't it taken easy on
[49:50] this church I think it's time that we
[49:52] sit that we quit sitting back and trying
[49:55] to out strategize the devil I say it's
[49:58] time that we quit sitting back and
[50:00] trying to out think him and out debate
[50:02] him I say it's time that we get
[50:04] ourselves ready for battle that we go on
[50:06] the offensive that we Smite him that we
[50:09] destroy him that we make no peace with
[50:12] him and we show him no mercy because
[50:15] tonight this is total Wars what we're
[50:17] dealing with here it's time we quit
[50:19] trying to to learn how to live with
[50:22] devils and start destroying devils it's
[50:25] time that we quit making treaties with
[50:27] the Enemy quit letting down the bars to
[50:30] make sure you know that some people
[50:31] aren't uncomfortable in the church
[50:37] time we keep the standards where they've
[50:39] always been quit trying to teach people
[50:40] how to overcome and get them to the
[50:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost this is total
[50:46] war quit trying to make peace through
[50:48] coping and cut his head off I don't need
[50:51] to cope with my depression I don't need
[50:53] to cope with the Enemy I don't need to
[50:55] cope with anxiety what I need to do is
[50:57] say This Is War there will be no peace
[51:00] there will be no treaty and take his
[51:02] head off tonight
[51:04] [Music]
[51:07] it's time to take the gloves off and go
[51:10] on the attack
[51:12] give him no peace
[51:14] give the enemy no peace give him no
[51:17] resting place give him no foothold and
[51:20] destroy the works of the devil
[51:23] brother Branham would say here what we
[51:25] need is old-fashioned God sent
[51:27] heaven-born preachers who will tell the
[51:30] truth regardless who it hurts
[51:33] like John who said the ACT is laid to
[51:35] the root of the tree and every tree that
[51:37] not bringeth forth good fruits is hewn
[51:39] down and cast Into the Fire we need
[51:41] preachers prophets like that who will
[51:43] bombard and use the judgments of God for
[51:46] ammunition to tear up this wicked
[51:49] condition that we're living in you can
[51:51] never rid sin by patting it on the back
[51:54] you can never rid sin by educating
[51:57] people our programs has become
[52:00] demolished and have failed there's only
[52:02] one remedy for sin and it's Christ is
[52:05] that remedy and not Christ through
[52:07] intellectual confession but through the
[52:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost to a new life
[52:13] and a regeneration that's the only
[52:15] remedy for sin only remedy for our
[52:17] nation is the only remedy for our church
[52:20] it's the only remedy for the people
[52:24] Total War
[52:27] he said there in verse 2 to utterly
[52:30] destroy
[52:32] and we see that word a lot as we
[52:34] actually read about the conquest of the
[52:36] Promised Land destroy
[52:39] destroy means to put an end to the
[52:41] existence of
[52:44] that don't sound like patented
[52:47] that don't sound like you need to to
[52:48] deal with this and cope with this to put
[52:51] an end to the existence of by damaging
[52:55] or attacking
[52:58] now I want you to think about the thing
[53:00] that's been hindering you and holding
[53:02] you and attacking your family maybe
[53:03] generation after generation and think
[53:06] about that as we look through these
[53:07] synonyms it says to consume it to crush
[53:10] it to dismantle it to end it to
[53:13] eradicate it to get it to kill it to
[53:16] shatter it to smash it to wipe it out
[53:19] that sounds like something I'd like to
[53:21] do to the things that have come against
[53:22] me I don't want to keep dealing with it
[53:24] I don't want to face it day after day I
[53:27] want to eradicate it I want to wipe it
[53:29] out I want to give no quarter to the
[53:31] enemy but tonight I want to destroy him
[53:34] completely
[53:38] brother Brown says but when he come and
[53:40] fought against them and taken from the
[53:41] people then God told him Israel vowed to
[53:45] God if he would deliver the king into
[53:47] his hands that he'd utterly destroy the
[53:50] land and that's a type today
[53:53] if God will give you the spirit the Holy
[53:57] Spirit utterly destroy sin out of your
[54:00] life move on nothing can stop the church
[54:03] they may call you fanatic they may call
[54:05] you simply to pack a Bible they may say
[54:08] that you're a Holy Roller or whatever
[54:09] they do nothing's going to stand in
[54:12] God's Church's way she's moving towards
[54:15] Canaan if you don't go God's going to
[54:17] take them that will go that's right that
[54:20] church there's nothing it's an
[54:22] irresistible Force that's right and God
[54:25] will move everything he said he will
[54:28] move everything so tonight nothing is
[54:30] too big that's hindering you nothing is
[54:33] too big that's hindering you no cancer
[54:35] no devil no family trouble there is
[54:37] nothing in between you and the Rapture
[54:39] that God will not move out of the way if
[54:42] you're willing to stand and declare war
[54:44] on it stand on your faith and not back
[54:46] up he will move it he said nothing's too
[54:49] big
[54:53] I say we ought to get ready for things
[54:55] to move
[54:59] not if
[55:01] when
[55:05] things are going to move
[55:07] now I understand that sometimes we get
[55:09] blindsided by things
[55:11] I understand that sometimes we don't see
[55:13] things coming so there's not necessarily
[55:15] a way that we can go attack that thing
[55:17] when we don't even know it's in
[55:18] existence yet
[55:20] I get that
[55:21] but for far too long I believe that we
[55:24] have fought a defensive War
[55:27] and we tried to counter-attack the devil
[55:29] or defend against his attacks and true
[55:32] we must I know the Bible says that we
[55:34] have to withstand the Wows of the enemy
[55:35] his attacks sure that's something that
[55:37] we must do I get that but Joshua wasn't
[55:40] sitting over there in his Camp defending
[55:43] his Camp making sure it was guarded good
[55:45] going have we taken the promised land
[55:47] yet
[55:49] is it ours yet
[55:50] make sure you defend the camp real good
[55:52] so they don't get in tomorrow is it do
[55:54] we got it yet well no you hadn't got it
[55:56] because you hadn't went and took it yet
[55:58] no you hadn't got your joy back because
[56:00] you hadn't went and took it yet you
[56:01] hadn't got your piece back because you
[56:03] hadn't went and took it yet you hadn't
[56:04] received the Holy Ghost yet because
[56:06] you're sitting around in a defensive
[56:07] position get up take the promise of the
[56:09] of the word and go get your promise and
[56:12] go possess your promise and go get what
[56:14] it is you have need of it's time to go
[56:17] on the offensive and quit sitting back
[56:20] letting the devil attack and attack and
[56:22] attack and attack it's time we start
[56:24] lobbing some of those Rockets right back
[56:26] at him it's time to load up your weapon
[56:28] it's time to pick up your sword and it's
[56:31] time to go get him boy it's time to get
[56:33] after him tonight and quit fighting a
[56:35] defensive War Joshua was on the attack
[56:40] I believe we should be on the attack
[56:42] tonight I believe we should be tearing
[56:45] stuff up
[56:46] tearing stuff down oh that's his
[56:48] stronghold tear it down that's in my way
[56:50] tear it down I'm gonna let nothing stand
[56:52] between me and my complete victory
[56:56] when's the last time the devil said
[56:58] about you he don't give me no rest
[57:04] when's the last time that was the
[57:06] devil's testimony about you when's the
[57:09] last time he said I don't know what to
[57:11] do with that guy I don't know what to do
[57:14] with that woman
[57:18] that's what I like about a offensive
[57:20] services not because you get offended I
[57:23] mean offensive in the way that you were
[57:25] on the attack I love offensive services
[57:31] I love services that put us on the top
[57:33] see defensive Services teach you how to
[57:36] cope with things defensive Services
[57:38] teach you how to live with it you know
[57:40] how to maybe not give up and hang in
[57:42] there for a little while hey and that's
[57:44] Noble to be sure that's fine if that's
[57:46] what you want to do but I like to go on
[57:48] the offense and say today on this day
[57:51] I'm gonna take your head off on this day
[57:53] you'll know there's a God in Israel on
[57:55] this day I will have my Deliverance on
[57:58] this day you will die listen Saul was a
[58:02] son of Kish and he fought a defensive
[58:04] battle
[58:07] and he said you know what
[58:09] David those days are over
[58:11] we just got to be defensive
[58:14] you know what we can't do that anymore
[58:16] as we mature Goliath will leave the
[58:19] valley
[58:22] no he won't
[58:24] well as we mature we'll grow out of this
[58:26] you don't have to deal with him today
[58:29] listen don't feed me that defense wins
[58:32] championships garbage
[58:33] if you want to win you got to score more
[58:35] points than the other team it's time to
[58:37] go on the offensive and say by his
[58:39] stripes we are healed come up here if
[58:41] you got a devil we'll lay hands on you
[58:43] we'll cast him out come to the Altar and
[58:46] get filled with the Holy Ghost it's time
[58:47] to go on the attack to go on the
[58:50] offensive so we can have it it's ours
[58:52] I'm going to get it tonight I believe in
[58:56] being offensive
[59:00] it's time to take back what is yours
[59:03] it's not going to change what you just
[59:05] digging in and sitting in your tent you
[59:07] got to be willing to go take it it's
[59:10] time for Total War
[59:13] Deuteronomy 12 1.
[59:16] these are the statutes and judgments
[59:18] which you shall observe to do in the
[59:20] land which the Lord God of thy fathers
[59:22] giveth thee to possess it all the days
[59:24] that you live upon the Earth
[59:27] ye shall utterly destroy
[59:29] all the places wherein the Nations which
[59:32] you shall possess served their gods
[59:35] sounds like we shouldn't be going to
[59:37] places where they serve their gods
[59:39] upon the high mountains and upon the
[59:41] hills and under every Green Tree you
[59:44] shall overthrow their altars and break
[59:47] their pillars and burn their Groves with
[59:50] fire and you shall hewed down the graven
[59:52] images of their gods and destroy the
[59:54] names of them out of that place
[59:57] this doesn't sound very friendly
[1:00:00] nor does it sound very defensive
[1:00:04] but he's telling you you go do this and
[1:00:07] this is total war and you destroy it all
[1:00:09] you wipe out their names you wipe out
[1:00:11] their altars you completely destroy
[1:00:14] because if you don't it will be a thorn
[1:00:16] in your side
[1:00:19] Total War
[1:00:21] we're going to delve into a little bit
[1:00:22] of History right here I hate to shock
[1:00:24] you like that
[1:00:28] you know the American Civil War is such
[1:00:30] a fascinating study that
[1:00:32] goes much deeper than the surface level
[1:00:35] that is taught in schools and textbooks
[1:00:38] there are wonderful and Godly men on
[1:00:40] both sides and there were horrible
[1:00:42] Dreadful men on both sides
[1:00:45] but two Central characters today just to
[1:00:47] compare and to contrast for a moment
[1:00:51] General Robert E Lee
[1:00:53] and General William Tecumseh Sherman
[1:00:58] General Lee was considered the greatest
[1:01:01] and boldest strategist in the war
[1:01:04] many of his battle plans are still
[1:01:06] studied today in places like West Point
[1:01:09] he was bold
[1:01:10] he was Swift and he was daring
[1:01:13] and yet he was a gentleman even to his
[1:01:16] enemies
[1:01:17] now on the everyday basis that's a good
[1:01:20] thing
[1:01:21] you know they would say about brother
[1:01:22] Brown that you couldn't tell his enemies
[1:01:24] from his friends
[1:01:26] but this ain't everyday life we were
[1:01:28] talking about this was
[1:01:31] War
[1:01:34] when they invaded the north up into
[1:01:36] Pennsylvania the Army had strict
[1:01:38] instructions from Robert E Lee do not
[1:01:40] interfere with the lives of civilians
[1:01:43] do not damage the property of civilians
[1:01:45] these people are not our enemies we are
[1:01:48] not at war with these people we want
[1:01:51] them to see that we mean them no harm
[1:01:55] as a matter of fact there were stories
[1:01:56] that I'm sure like many down through
[1:01:58] time and down through history get fudged
[1:02:01] a little bit or or maybe exaggerate
[1:02:03] embellished Through Time
[1:02:04] but supposedly there were men that he
[1:02:06] had court-martialed for tearing wood off
[1:02:08] of a fence to build themselves a fire to
[1:02:10] keep from freezing to death
[1:02:12] because he said you will not touch
[1:02:15] anything that doesn't directly related
[1:02:18] to the Army
[1:02:20] and then there was Sherman
[1:02:23] on the other side of things
[1:02:25] other men had tried to outmaneuver the
[1:02:27] southern armies
[1:02:28] others had had the gentleman's approach
[1:02:30] they had fought a pretty War they had
[1:02:33] fought a poetic War a war of pageantry a
[1:02:37] war without altar calls a war without
[1:02:39] prayer lines a war without casting out
[1:02:42] Devils a war where sin isn't called out
[1:02:45] just the pageantry and forms of church
[1:02:47] services in a battle plan that doesn't
[1:02:49] offend
[1:02:52] that doesn't destroy anybody's ideas
[1:02:55] because that's that's their ideas let's
[1:02:57] leave that alone let's not bother that
[1:03:00] we don't want to offend or make enemies
[1:03:03] they fought a war that wouldn't get
[1:03:05] messy that wouldn't step on people's
[1:03:07] toes
[1:03:08] and officially in the United States
[1:03:10] government it was called the policy of
[1:03:12] conciliation
[1:03:13] in other words it was a limited War
[1:03:18] it says this policy meant where you are
[1:03:21] to respect the private property even of
[1:03:23] those actively working against you
[1:03:26] it's the idea that most of those people
[1:03:28] on the enemy side really aren't our
[1:03:31] enemies
[1:03:32] or let me bring it down to where we can
[1:03:34] understand what we're talking about
[1:03:35] tonight that's really not something we
[1:03:37] should worry about that's just a family
[1:03:38] trait
[1:03:40] that's really not something we should
[1:03:42] worry about that's just my ideas I'm
[1:03:44] allowed to have my own personal opinions
[1:03:47] so let's leave that alone because it
[1:03:49] really doesn't have anything to do with
[1:03:50] the war
[1:03:51] I'm just turned a little bit towards the
[1:03:53] negative
[1:03:54] I'll eventually grow out of this
[1:03:58] foreign
[1:04:01] and Sherman realized that in all of this
[1:04:03] the war wasn't getting won
[1:04:06] because it didn't matter how much they
[1:04:08] outstrategized and planned Robert E Lee
[1:04:11] would whoop them every single time
[1:04:14] and he recognized this war is going to
[1:04:16] go on
[1:04:17] and on and on and on
[1:04:21] so in 1863 he began to apply what he
[1:04:24] called the hard hand of War
[1:04:27] in central Mississippi in the Meridian
[1:04:29] campaign and for the first time Sherman
[1:04:32] would order his troops to wage a war of
[1:04:35] Destruction
[1:04:37] he believed that by doing so would
[1:04:40] remove all hope from the enemy
[1:04:44] I like that
[1:04:46] I think it's time that we remove all
[1:04:48] hope from the enemy to where they
[1:04:50] realize it don't matter what you throw
[1:04:52] at me it don't matter how you attack me
[1:04:54] it don't matter what you bring at my
[1:04:55] family you are not gonna win you might
[1:04:58] as well give up all hope because I won't
[1:05:00] quit I Won't Back Down I'm not going
[1:05:02] away I'm not retreating I'm not
[1:05:04] surrendering I'm going to win this war
[1:05:06] so no matter what you do you might as
[1:05:09] well give up any hope of winning because
[1:05:11] at the back of the book no matter how
[1:05:13] you come at me I go up and you go down
[1:05:16] at the back of the book I'm in eternity
[1:05:18] and you are in hell you can't win this
[1:05:22] war and tonight we are going to declare
[1:05:24] Total War and we are going to remove all
[1:05:26] hope you ever had of taking me
[1:05:32] but in order to do that you're going to
[1:05:34] have to be willing to die to self die to
[1:05:36] your own thinking and tear up whatever
[1:05:39] you've got to tear up
[1:05:41] and let him know I'll fight you wherever
[1:05:44] I'll fight you however but you have no
[1:05:47] hope
[1:05:49] Sherman's goal was to make Georgia howl
[1:05:54] I instantly thought of the brother Brian
[1:05:56] I'm saying why is the devil howling
[1:05:59] because we got the answer to his
[1:06:00] question
[1:06:01] he said he wanted to make Georgia how he
[1:06:04] says now listen to this we are not only
[1:06:06] fighting hostile armies but a hostile
[1:06:09] people we must make old and young rich
[1:06:13] and poor feel the hard hand of War we
[1:06:16] cannot change the hearts and minds of
[1:06:18] those people but we can make war so
[1:06:20] terrible and make them so sick of war
[1:06:23] that Generations would pass away before
[1:06:26] they would ever again appeal to it
[1:06:28] Sherman contended that the United States
[1:06:31] and its Representatives had the right to
[1:06:35] remove and Destroy every obstacle
[1:06:38] come on now every obstacle if need be
[1:06:41] take every life every acre of land every
[1:06:45] particle of property everything that to
[1:06:48] us seems proper that all who do not Aid
[1:06:51] are enemies and we will not account to
[1:06:54] them for our Acts
[1:06:57] I say it doesn't matter tonight what
[1:06:58] other people think about our war it
[1:07:01] doesn't matter tonight how you think we
[1:07:02] ought to conduct our war I'm saying I
[1:07:04] will tear down whatever I have to tear
[1:07:06] down I will preach what we have to
[1:07:08] preach we will say the Holy Ghost can
[1:07:10] have Liberty here we will preach healing
[1:07:12] we will preach being filled with the
[1:07:14] Holy Ghost we will preach the gift we
[1:07:16] will preach whatever and we will not
[1:07:18] give account to you for how we conduct
[1:07:20] our war but we will be victorious we
[1:07:23] will overcome because we're willing to
[1:07:26] do whatever it takes you can perpetuate
[1:07:28] War perpetuate War perpetuate War but I
[1:07:32] am in it to win it tonight a minute to
[1:07:35] do whatever we have to do I say tear it
[1:07:38] up if it's in your way tear it up if you
[1:07:41] need to burn it burn it down tonight
[1:07:43] light it a fire light your soul on fire
[1:07:46] get your house on fire do what you gotta
[1:07:49] do but win
[1:07:52] This Is War
[1:07:55] and it must be Total War
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:08:03] what all should we burn down anything
[1:08:06] that hinders
[1:08:07] any idea
[1:08:09] any ism
[1:08:12] any Doctrine
[1:08:14] any division
[1:08:16] that would stand between me and my full
[1:08:18] inheritance
[1:08:20] I'm going to destroyed
[1:08:23] Deuteronomy 20 16.
[1:08:28] they just laid out High there to treat
[1:08:30] all the people
[1:08:31] and all the cities
[1:08:33] on the way to the promised land
[1:08:36] now it gets to the cities that are in
[1:08:39] the Promised Land
[1:08:40] in other words cities built on top of
[1:08:42] your inheritance
[1:08:44] what are you supposed to do to the
[1:08:46] things that are on your inheritance
[1:08:49] but of the cities of these people
[1:08:52] wish the Lord thy God doth give thee for
[1:08:54] an inheritance
[1:08:56] Thou shalt save alive nothing that
[1:09:00] breatheth
[1:09:03] anything that has stood in your
[1:09:06] inheritance
[1:09:07] anything that has tried to stop you
[1:09:09] anything that has tried to hinder you or
[1:09:12] made you think you couldn't make it
[1:09:15] cast it down
[1:09:16] and destroy it tonight
[1:09:19] verse 17 but Thou shalt utterly destroy
[1:09:23] them namely the Hittites and the
[1:09:25] amorites in the Canaanites and the
[1:09:27] parasites the hibites and the jebusites
[1:09:30] as the Lord thy God
[1:09:32] hath commanded thee pardon me
[1:09:44] brother Brandon would say listen
[1:09:47] and we're going to get into some things
[1:09:48] here he says listen destroy your enemy
[1:09:50] before your enemy destroys you
[1:09:53] he says he'll do it
[1:09:55] he says bring back the old-fashioned
[1:09:57] meetings
[1:09:57] you know leave Delilah alone
[1:10:00] leave the world alone that thing that
[1:10:03] Woos you off into little things that you
[1:10:04] shouldn't and little things troubles
[1:10:06] come up in the church and you won't
[1:10:08] stand correction because you don't have
[1:10:10] to you can drop off to another church
[1:10:12] and things like that in the early days
[1:10:15] when a man didn't cope up with the word
[1:10:17] of God they packed him out dead
[1:10:20] it says bring us back to Pentecost not
[1:10:23] Hollywood Showmanship but a wholehearted
[1:10:26] turn to God is what we need once more oh
[1:10:30] Lord once more
[1:10:31] he says again let me say this my friend
[1:10:34] you better destroy your enemy before
[1:10:37] your enemy destroys you
[1:10:40] you know people don't have a problem
[1:10:41] with this statement as a matter of fact
[1:10:43] everybody in here is like man yeah it's
[1:10:44] exactly right destroy that devil
[1:10:47] destroy that enemy before he destroys me
[1:10:51] but see
[1:10:53] what they have a problem with is
[1:10:54] recognizing what the enemy is
[1:10:58] that's where the problem comes
[1:11:01] they toy with things they toy with
[1:11:03] unbelief
[1:11:04] they toy with complexes they toy with
[1:11:07] self-righteousness they toy with their
[1:11:10] ideas of how things should be not
[1:11:12] recognizing that those things that
[1:11:14] you're toying with want to destroy you
[1:11:18] see that's the thing about Total War and
[1:11:19] that's what Sherman was willing to do
[1:11:21] that none others were willing to is he
[1:11:23] was willing to look at things that look
[1:11:25] so simple and so insignificant and say
[1:11:29] burn that Barn down
[1:11:31] why it's just a barn it belongs to yeah
[1:11:34] it belongs to Bob over here but what
[1:11:35] Bob's doing is he's raising cattle and
[1:11:37] housing in that barn and those cattle
[1:11:39] are feeding the army so to you it looks
[1:11:41] like a barn but what it is is it's
[1:11:43] something the enemy is using against us
[1:11:45] to defeat us Burn It Down
[1:11:49] and he was willing to make to call out
[1:11:51] what we would call the uncomfortable
[1:11:53] enemies we can all say the devils and
[1:11:55] that's not uncomfortable but Total War
[1:11:58] recognizes the uncomfortable enemies it
[1:12:01] recognizes that things we had let lay
[1:12:04] around are benefiting the enemy and it
[1:12:07] says it's time to burn it all
[1:12:10] brother Branham says after a while when
[1:12:12] Joshua took the land God told him
[1:12:14] utterly destroy everything there is
[1:12:16] don't leave nothing now you talk about
[1:12:19] uncomfortable why could you imagine some
[1:12:22] of them Israelite women picking up a
[1:12:24] little baby
[1:12:25] oh isn't it cute look at it it ain't
[1:12:27] even got teeth yet
[1:12:29] Joshua said kill it
[1:12:33] the mother said oh I'm a mother I can't
[1:12:35] kill that baby and he said hand it here
[1:12:39] oh
[1:12:40] talk about uncomfortable
[1:12:43] but this is total war
[1:12:46] he says why it might look cute now but
[1:12:48] it'll grow up and be just like its Daddy
[1:12:51] you can't baby sin it's got to be
[1:12:55] handled not with gloves on but
[1:12:58] bare-handed
[1:13:01] oh it can't be that bad brother Aaron
[1:13:04] why can't I have just my opinions about
[1:13:07] these things why Why Can't This well how
[1:13:09] come that's considered so bad why can't
[1:13:10] we do these things
[1:13:12] oh yeah now we're getting to the
[1:13:13] uncomfortable that total war will call
[1:13:15] out
[1:13:17] see everybody wants to kill the devil
[1:13:20] the obvious enemy but people don't like
[1:13:22] Total War because Total War makes you
[1:13:25] deal with
[1:13:26] self
[1:13:29] now this isn't the way I wanted it to go
[1:13:31] tonight but the more I studied it just
[1:13:33] wouldn't come out of this channel so
[1:13:34] we're going to be here for a minute
[1:13:36] it makes you deal with self listen you
[1:13:40] have two great enemies
[1:13:43] the devil
[1:13:45] and yourself
[1:13:47] and if you put anybody else on that list
[1:13:49] I'll be the first to tell you got real
[1:13:51] problems
[1:13:54] but it's the devil and yourself and it's
[1:13:57] a pretty tough battle for which one of
[1:13:59] those is number one
[1:14:01] those are the enemies that fight against
[1:14:04] you
[1:14:05] you know everybody believes the quote
[1:14:06] destroy your enemy before it destroys
[1:14:08] you but then they don't want to identify
[1:14:11] where the main enemy lies
[1:14:14] and when you can't identify it as the
[1:14:16] enemy then you baby it we baby the flesh
[1:14:20] we want to be comfortable
[1:14:24] I started to say something about eating
[1:14:25] a lot and I decide
[1:14:27] we want to eat foods that we like
[1:14:29] we want to do what we want to do
[1:14:31] we don't want to be told what to do
[1:14:34] some of us have real problems with
[1:14:35] authority
[1:14:37] we just do
[1:14:40] and we baby it and we make excuses for
[1:14:42] why we can't do things and excuses for
[1:14:44] why we can't overcome excuses for why we
[1:14:47] can't be in church excuses for why our
[1:14:49] family can't be lined up and live in a
[1:14:51] Christian Life excuse after excuse and
[1:14:54] then we don't want to take
[1:14:55] accountability and recognize what the
[1:14:57] enemy is
[1:15:02] you won't identify it
[1:15:04] and so you let it live
[1:15:07] you don't destroy your own ideas
[1:15:10] and you let it live and you feed it and
[1:15:12] since it can't be you
[1:15:15] then others become the problem
[1:15:18] because it can't be you so then you have
[1:15:21] a list that's the devil and other people
[1:15:24] and somehow you leave yourself off that
[1:15:27] list
[1:15:29] this is total war now
[1:15:32] so others become the problem and you
[1:15:34] take aim at others instead of the two
[1:15:36] enemies that you should be fighting
[1:15:38] against
[1:15:39] so the devil gets a break because you're
[1:15:40] so busy
[1:15:42] at this one and hang grenades over there
[1:15:45] and the devil's sitting there going get
[1:15:46] him boy
[1:15:47] get him
[1:15:49] and he's encouraging you and he's
[1:15:50] whispering in your ear yeah he said that
[1:15:52] about you I know how he thinks about you
[1:15:54] and he told so and he's feeding it why
[1:15:56] because all the ammunitions going in the
[1:15:58] wrong place and he's loving it he ain't
[1:16:00] taking a single shot he's got you
[1:16:02] fighting your brother
[1:16:04] because you can't identify for a minute
[1:16:07] I need to die
[1:16:10] I need to die to self
[1:16:14] see we have to apply Total War
[1:16:17] to us brother Brown says God said
[1:16:21] utterly destroy the thing
[1:16:23] amen hallelujah what we need today and
[1:16:26] he stops and he says you're a baby
[1:16:29] and around with a whole lot of
[1:16:32] things you ought to be destroying
[1:16:35] I'm gonna read that again because I
[1:16:37] can't say that to you but he can
[1:16:40] you're a baby
[1:16:43] and around with a whole lot of
[1:16:45] things you ought to be destroying
[1:16:48] see there's a reason God demands that
[1:16:50] you killed these things not that he
[1:16:51] wants to hurt you he's because he wants
[1:16:53] to save you
[1:16:54] he don't want these things to rise up
[1:16:56] and overtake you down the road he's
[1:16:58] telling you kill it all lay down your
[1:17:00] thinking lay down your ideas lay down
[1:17:03] yourself lay down your human nature so
[1:17:05] that you can have more of him more of
[1:17:08] eternal life more of that glorious
[1:17:10] presence but as long as you're holding
[1:17:12] on to this
[1:17:14] it's gonna rise up and it's gonna kill
[1:17:16] you anything not dealt with now
[1:17:19] I was up later try to destroy
[1:17:25] destroy we'll rise up again you will see
[1:17:28] it again
[1:17:29] it always comes back
[1:17:32] I want to look at it for a minute here
[1:17:34] in Samuel
[1:17:37] first Samuel 15 1.
[1:17:41] and we're gonna try to get through the
[1:17:42] rough stuff
[1:17:43] as fast as we can but just bear with me
[1:17:45] because this is this was heavy on me
[1:17:48] it says Samuel also said unto Saul the
[1:17:51] Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king
[1:17:53] over his people it's a man with a
[1:17:56] powerful position
[1:17:58] over Israel now therefore hearken thou
[1:18:01] unto the voice of the words of the Lord
[1:18:03] thus saith the Lord of hosts I remember
[1:18:06] that which amalek did to Israel how he
[1:18:09] laid weight for him in the way when he
[1:18:11] came up from Egypt now go and smite
[1:18:14] amalek and utterly destroy all that they
[1:18:17] have I want you to pay close attentions
[1:18:19] to how God gives him very clear
[1:18:21] instructions there was no room for I
[1:18:23] think so's and I felt like and maybe we
[1:18:26] should have handled it this way this
[1:18:27] time lord
[1:18:30] utterly destroy all that they have and
[1:18:33] spare them not but slay both man and
[1:18:37] woman infant and suckling ox and sheep
[1:18:41] camel and ass this is total war
[1:18:48] this is destruction but this is what
[1:18:52] will bring total Victory you can't have
[1:18:55] total Victory without Total War because
[1:18:59] a limited war never will wipe out
[1:19:01] everything but a total war will
[1:19:04] and Saul gathered the people together
[1:19:06] and numbered them into lame 200 000
[1:19:09] footmen and ten thousand men of Judah
[1:19:10] and Saul came to the city of amalek and
[1:19:13] laid weight in the valley skipping down
[1:19:15] to verse 7.
[1:19:16] and Saul smote the amalekites from
[1:19:19] havilah until the cometh until they come
[1:19:22] as to sure that is over against Egypt
[1:19:24] and he took agag the king of the
[1:19:26] amalekites a lot oh
[1:19:32] there's trouble Brewing
[1:19:36] and utterly destroyed all the people
[1:19:38] with the edge of the sword look at this
[1:19:42] it's almost
[1:19:43] in a roundabout way it's almost an Eden
[1:19:46] like situation
[1:19:48] he just disobeyed a little bit
[1:19:52] I mean he went to battle because God
[1:19:54] told him to he slew a malachite he
[1:19:57] risked his life because God told him to
[1:20:01] I've been serving the lord 30 years
[1:20:05] God don't care if you ain't doing what
[1:20:07] he asked you to do
[1:20:11] you might have been doing it wrong for
[1:20:13] 30 years
[1:20:18] he went to battle
[1:20:21] next verse
[1:20:25] go back
[1:20:28] I don't know this just hits me
[1:20:31] in the midst of absolute victory
[1:20:36] in the midst of freedom
[1:20:39] in the midst of the spirit being poured
[1:20:41] out in a church service
[1:20:44] in the midst right there when you could
[1:20:46] have complete Victory we let the enemy
[1:20:48] live
[1:20:50] this one's having Victory this one's
[1:20:52] having Victory this one's having Victory
[1:20:54] this one's running and shouting
[1:20:57] and you leave
[1:20:58] and you take agag with you
[1:21:02] and you say that was powerful that was a
[1:21:05] service there was a there was a
[1:21:06] malachite slain
[1:21:08] there was victory in the house of God as
[1:21:11] you walk out with a gag
[1:21:15] come on now this is the opportunity to
[1:21:19] end it all
[1:21:20] this is the opportunity for total
[1:21:22] Victory and we're going to see here in a
[1:21:24] minute if we have time Lord willing how
[1:21:26] this decision would hinder Israel for
[1:21:29] years and years and generation after
[1:21:33] generation
[1:21:34] in the midst of deliverance we spare the
[1:21:37] enemy why do we do that
[1:21:41] because we think what we're holding on
[1:21:43] to has some kind of value
[1:21:46] we think our opinion matters
[1:21:50] brother Aaron are you saying that
[1:21:52] towards the lake no I'm saying that
[1:21:53] towards me brother Joe brother Tim we
[1:21:56] can't do nothing until we lay our
[1:21:57] opinions down
[1:21:59] God can't speak to us as long as we're
[1:22:01] looking at going well I think this and I
[1:22:03] think that now that's all of us
[1:22:08] our opinions when it comes to the word
[1:22:11] of God look I understand you're saying
[1:22:12] we're not allowed I'm talking about when
[1:22:13] it comes to the word of God
[1:22:15] our opinions don't matter
[1:22:19] we have no thought coming that's exactly
[1:22:21] right and let me drive that point home
[1:22:23] we're dealing with this
[1:22:27] we feel like that something we could
[1:22:29] keep has value
[1:22:32] and it says but Saul and the people
[1:22:34] spared a gag and the best of the sheep
[1:22:37] and of The Oxen and of the fatlings and
[1:22:40] the Lambs and all that was good and
[1:22:42] would not
[1:22:45] utterly destroy them direct disobeying
[1:22:49] a word from the Lord
[1:22:51] but everything that was vile and refuse
[1:22:54] that they destroyed utterly now see once
[1:22:57] again it's easy for all of us to see the
[1:22:59] devil and go we need to destroy that we
[1:23:01] need to destroy that that smile that's
[1:23:04] vile that's vile we need to destroy that
[1:23:06] I see where that's wrong so that needs
[1:23:09] to be destroyed but I don't really know
[1:23:11] about these sheep
[1:23:13] what's wrong with these what's wrong
[1:23:15] with this what's wrong with the music I
[1:23:18] listened to when my mom and daddy ain't
[1:23:20] around
[1:23:20] what's wrong with this what's wrong with
[1:23:23] these things we destroyed all the evil
[1:23:25] stuff
[1:23:26] but we're just holding on to some of
[1:23:28] this little the problem is those things
[1:23:30] they saved alive were a link back to the
[1:23:34] vial and the refuse that song is a link
[1:23:37] back to that movie is a link back to
[1:23:39] that conversation you shouldn't be
[1:23:41] having is a link back to where you were
[1:23:44] supposed to be victorious
[1:23:46] we're supposed to cut down all those
[1:23:48] links we are supposed to separate those
[1:23:50] things we are not to lay our head in the
[1:23:53] lap of Delilah those things are a link
[1:23:56] they may not be violent refused but they
[1:23:59] are a link to
[1:24:01] that attitude is a link to
[1:24:05] that ism is a link to that idea is a
[1:24:08] link to
[1:24:09] destroy it
[1:24:13] let's see
[1:24:14] about destroying the obvious
[1:24:17] what they did is they satisfy
[1:24:20] their religious conscience
[1:24:23] but you don't satisfy what God has asked
[1:24:26] you to do
[1:24:27] you've only satisfied your conscience in
[1:24:30] the matter
[1:24:31] verse 10 then came the word of the Lord
[1:24:33] unto Samuel saying it repenteth me that
[1:24:35] I have set up Saul to be king for he has
[1:24:38] turned back from following me and hath
[1:24:40] not performed my Commandments and it
[1:24:42] Grieves Samuel and he cried unto the
[1:24:44] Lord all night now notice right here
[1:24:46] just quick as I moved on before I move
[1:24:48] on to fail to do any of it
[1:24:50] is to fail in all
[1:24:53] he says he failed to do it he did not
[1:24:57] perform my Commandments
[1:24:59] verse 12 and when Samuel Rose early to
[1:25:01] meet Saul in the morning it was told
[1:25:03] Samuel saying Saul came to Carmel and
[1:25:05] behold he set him up a place and has
[1:25:07] gone about and passed on and gone down
[1:25:09] to gilgal and Samuel came to Saul and
[1:25:12] Saul said unto him now what's the
[1:25:14] attitude of a person in this
[1:25:18] place
[1:25:20] I'll just go ahead and say it what's the
[1:25:22] attitude of a person with a
[1:25:24] self-righteous religious spirit
[1:25:27] what's his attitude we've already been
[1:25:29] told by the word of God that he did not
[1:25:31] do what he was supposed to do
[1:25:35] Saul said unto him blessed be thou O
[1:25:38] Lord
[1:25:39] glory and church service
[1:25:42] Hallelujah
[1:25:46] blessed be the Lord oh he's religious he
[1:25:50] is glad to be here or glad to be
[1:25:53] streaming are glad to be doing whatever
[1:25:54] he's doing other than doing what the
[1:25:56] Lord told him to do
[1:26:00] I have performed the Commandment
[1:26:04] of the Lord
[1:26:07] really because that's not what the Bible
[1:26:09] said
[1:26:13] notice his self-righteousness look what
[1:26:16] I've done for God
[1:26:18] look at how it prospers look at me I
[1:26:22] I mean he didn't even mention the armies
[1:26:24] he didn't mention none that look what I
[1:26:26] have done I did this and God used me and
[1:26:29] God worked through me me me me me me
[1:26:32] me
[1:26:36] and Samuel said what meaneth then this
[1:26:39] bleeding of the sheep in my ears
[1:26:42] and the lowing of The Oxen which I hear
[1:26:45] and Saul said
[1:26:47] they have brought them wait a minute
[1:26:49] where does they come from
[1:26:52] it was all about me
[1:26:54] but now it's they
[1:26:58] they have brought them from the
[1:27:00] amalekites for the people spared the
[1:27:04] best of the sheep and of The Oxen to
[1:27:06] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and the
[1:27:09] rest we have utterly destroyed just like
[1:27:12] God told us to
[1:27:15] I'm still holding on to this
[1:27:17] I'm still holding on to that I'm still
[1:27:19] holding on to this this Grudge this
[1:27:22] bitterness this unforgiveness but I have
[1:27:24] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:27] no
[1:27:29] no you're saying I can't ever have a
[1:27:32] grudge I'm not saying that I'm saying
[1:27:33] the Lord will deliver you of it you
[1:27:35] won't hold it and it won't hinder you
[1:27:37] and it won't destroy your family and
[1:27:38] destroy this one and destroyed that one
[1:27:40] you all while going along going look
[1:27:41] what I've done
[1:27:43] listen sometimes things
[1:27:47] I don't know I just feel to do this this
[1:27:49] is going to take up some time but
[1:27:50] sometimes things come into our life
[1:27:53] and we can't help it
[1:27:56] brother Tim this cup this bottle of
[1:27:58] water is not very heavy
[1:28:02] but if I hold it for an hour it's going
[1:28:04] to get heavier
[1:28:07] if I hold it all day
[1:28:09] this arm's gonna begin to hurt
[1:28:12] and if I hold it long enough without
[1:28:14] setting it down it's going to paralyze
[1:28:16] my arm
[1:28:18] to I can't move it because it's been
[1:28:20] stuck you ever slept in one position all
[1:28:22] night woke up you can't hardly move it
[1:28:24] yeah it don't matter how heavy it is
[1:28:27] you need to set it down
[1:28:30] and give it to God before it paralyzes
[1:28:32] your faith
[1:28:34] before it paralyzes your walk before the
[1:28:37] next thing you know you're so paralyzed
[1:28:38] that all you can do is look at the
[1:28:40] faults of everybody else you can't even
[1:28:41] turn and look back at Jesus you can't
[1:28:44] even go back to the Cross Where Mercy
[1:28:46] and Grace and forgiveness is because
[1:28:48] you've held something so long
[1:28:50] because you wouldn't identify the enemy
[1:28:52] that now you are paralyzed
[1:28:59] they have brought them from the
[1:29:01] amalekites
[1:29:02] still trying to defend his actions still
[1:29:05] trying to deflect blame
[1:29:07] then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I
[1:29:09] will tell thee what the Lord had said to
[1:29:11] me this night and he said unto him say
[1:29:13] on and Samuel said when thou was little
[1:29:16] in thy own sight which thou not made the
[1:29:18] head of the tribe of Israel and the Lord
[1:29:20] anointed thee King over Israel and the
[1:29:22] Lord sent thee on a journey and said go
[1:29:24] and utterly destroy the Sinners the
[1:29:27] amalekites and fight against them until
[1:29:29] they be consumed
[1:29:31] wherefore then did thou not obey the
[1:29:35] voice of the Lord but did fly upon the
[1:29:38] spool and did evil in the sight of the
[1:29:40] Lord notice how God interprets what has
[1:29:42] happened and how his interpretation is
[1:29:45] so much different than how Saul
[1:29:46] interpreted it
[1:29:48] now look at Saul when we and it's a very
[1:29:51] dangerous thing and I don't throw this
[1:29:52] around Loosely but when you get a
[1:29:54] self-righteous or a religious spirit on
[1:29:56] you you will even stand in the face of
[1:29:58] the man of God and argue with him
[1:30:00] he says and Saul said unto Samuel yea I
[1:30:04] have obeyed the voice of the Lord
[1:30:08] wow
[1:30:10] I have gone the way which the Lord sent
[1:30:13] me and have brought a gag the king of of
[1:30:16] amulet and have utterly destroyed the
[1:30:19] amalekites he got so lifted up and so
[1:30:22] consumed with this religious spirit that
[1:30:24] even when he was pointed back to the
[1:30:26] word he would argue with it
[1:30:29] and he's in a very dangerous place here
[1:30:31] when he gets to where he evalues his own
[1:30:32] opinion over what the prophet says
[1:30:36] you're in a dangerous place
[1:30:39] you did not do as God said well that's
[1:30:43] your opinion
[1:30:45] this is your opinion on it I don't like
[1:30:46] it I have obeyed the Lord
[1:30:49] verse 21. but the people took the spoil
[1:30:53] sheep and oxen the chief of the things
[1:30:55] which should have been utterly destroyed
[1:30:57] to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in
[1:31:00] gilgal one thing I want you to notice is
[1:31:02] that Sauls will always Master failure
[1:31:05] behind worthy causes and worthy
[1:31:07] arguments
[1:31:09] they're good sheep and it's for the
[1:31:11] church service
[1:31:13] it's for sacrificing
[1:31:16] I did this so we could have better
[1:31:17] services
[1:31:22] that's not what God asked you to do
[1:31:24] it matter if it's not what God told you
[1:31:26] to do
[1:31:29] but he'll take and mask it behind this
[1:31:31] worthy argument oh and all the while
[1:31:32] everybody else is to blame
[1:31:38] listen when you get to the place
[1:31:41] when you get to the place that all
[1:31:42] you're focused on is others and what
[1:31:44] they are doing wrong instead of taking
[1:31:46] that energy and directing it into how
[1:31:48] you can grow and where you need to
[1:31:50] repent you can always Trace that back to
[1:31:52] a religious spirit
[1:31:54] it just is what it is and the thing is
[1:31:57] it doesn't do it will do no good for me
[1:31:59] to recognize it it will do no good for
[1:32:01] brother Joe to recognize it it'll do no
[1:32:03] good for brother Tim to recognize it
[1:32:04] until you're willing to declare Total
[1:32:07] War on that Spirit it will consume you
[1:32:10] you have to be willing to go I recognize
[1:32:13] the enemy
[1:32:14] I recognize it it is upon me and I have
[1:32:18] to do what I have to do listen I had to
[1:32:21] kill the old man I was
[1:32:23] this ain't for everybody else we've all
[1:32:25] had to do it I that man had to die my
[1:32:29] ideas had to die how my family thought
[1:32:31] had to die or I could never grow in the
[1:32:33] Lord I could never become filled with
[1:32:35] the Holy Ghost I had to lay those things
[1:32:37] down and say Lord I surrender all I
[1:32:40] leave it here I lay it here and I want
[1:32:43] what you want
[1:32:46] you say oh this you're attacking me no
[1:32:48] I'm telling you what every Christian
[1:32:50] that has ever come to Christ has had to
[1:32:53] do every single one had to lay self down
[1:32:56] recognize myself is not worth anything
[1:32:59] there's nothing we're sparing there's
[1:33:01] nothing we're saving my ideas are trash
[1:33:03] everything the way I used to think is
[1:33:05] trash and all I want Lord is you all I
[1:33:09] want is more of you to fill me Lord I
[1:33:11] want you to use me and I want more of
[1:33:14] you but I've got to Lay All of Me Down
[1:33:19] that's a everybody's sermon is what that
[1:33:22] is
[1:33:27] I couldn't come and say this is just how
[1:33:28] I am this is how my family is
[1:33:32] that all had to die
[1:33:34] then I could be free
[1:33:36] then I could be filled
[1:33:38] then I could have total victory in my
[1:33:41] life
[1:33:42] and Samuel said hath the Lord
[1:33:44] as great delight and bird offerings and
[1:33:46] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:33:49] the Lord
[1:33:50] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:33:53] and to hearken than the fat of Rams for
[1:33:56] Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft
[1:33:58] and stubbornness is as iniquity and
[1:34:01] idolatry because thou has rejected the
[1:34:04] word of the Lord he hath also rejected
[1:34:07] thee from being King skip with me down
[1:34:09] to verse 32s I'm gonna try to hurry
[1:34:11] then said Samuel bring ye hither to me
[1:34:14] agag the king of the amalekites and a
[1:34:17] god came unto him delicately and agag
[1:34:20] said surely the bitterness of death is
[1:34:22] passed now what it means here when it
[1:34:24] says delicately is it actually means he
[1:34:26] came stately carrying himself as a king
[1:34:29] who should be respected
[1:34:31] he comes walking in as a king who should
[1:34:34] be respected and says surely the
[1:34:36] bitterness of death is over surely you
[1:34:39] know yes we fought yes I brought
[1:34:40] depression upon your family yes I tried
[1:34:42] to take your life yes I've tried to kill
[1:34:44] you and destroy you and bring anxiety
[1:34:46] and tear the church apart I know I've
[1:34:47] done all those things but surely now
[1:34:48] that those things are in the past you're
[1:34:50] going to let me Live Another Day
[1:34:52] next verse
[1:34:54] Total War and Samuel said as thy sword
[1:34:57] hath made women childless so shall thy
[1:35:00] mother be childless among women and
[1:35:03] Samuel hewed a gag into pieces before
[1:35:06] the Lord and gilgal what should I do
[1:35:09] with this depression brother Aaron
[1:35:10] Hewitt into pieces what should I do with
[1:35:12] this attitude you went into pieces what
[1:35:15] about this Rebellion you went into
[1:35:17] pieces don't tolerate it don't tolerate
[1:35:20] it anymore it wants to destroy you
[1:35:23] you've got to say I recognize what this
[1:35:25] is I will not be talking and letting it
[1:35:28] live with me another day but tonight I
[1:35:30] will deal with the thing I will Hewitt
[1:35:33] in two pieces
[1:35:35] don't let it Live Another Day
[1:35:38] strife and grudges and complexes and
[1:35:40] unbelief and secret sins Hewitt into
[1:35:42] pieces
[1:35:48] God will provide total victory
[1:35:51] but you have to carry it all the way out
[1:35:55] you can't stop short
[1:35:58] because wherever and whatever you stop
[1:36:01] short on will return
[1:36:03] we're gonna go into that for just a
[1:36:05] minute as we begin to bring this to a
[1:36:06] close procrastination with the devil
[1:36:08] won't work
[1:36:10] you can't hesitate to do all that the
[1:36:12] word has told you to do you can't have
[1:36:14] mercy on the devil for even a moment if
[1:36:18] you know you need to deal with it deal
[1:36:20] with it tonight because every day you
[1:36:21] leave it it grows stronger every day you
[1:36:24] hold it it holds you tighter it's
[1:36:26] paralyzing you not vice versa if temper
[1:36:29] is hindered you deal with it if lust is
[1:36:32] hindered you deal with it bitterness has
[1:36:34] hindered you deal with it unforgiveness
[1:36:35] has hindered you deal with it quit
[1:36:38] letting it lay there
[1:36:40] because if we'll fast forward Into the
[1:36:42] Book of Esther we'll find that Haman
[1:36:44] is a direct descendant of the amalekites
[1:36:48] that's the amalekites that Saul was
[1:36:50] supposed to destroy and he even carries
[1:36:53] the name of their King agag look in
[1:36:56] Esther three and one
[1:36:58] after these things did King of hazarus
[1:37:01] promote Haman the son of hamaditha the
[1:37:05] agagite
[1:37:07] he even carries the name of their King
[1:37:10] he is a direct descendant you say they
[1:37:13] slaughtered them all
[1:37:14] they killed every one of them
[1:37:17] but Jewish writings say that the
[1:37:19] leniency showed by Saul to King agag
[1:37:22] actually made it possible for Haman to
[1:37:24] appear because had he been killed one
[1:37:26] day sooner or the day that he was
[1:37:29] supposed to die
[1:37:31] then the great Peril which the Jews had
[1:37:33] to undergo what the hands of Haman would
[1:37:35] have been averted because it was in that
[1:37:37] one day that agag's lineage was able to
[1:37:41] continue
[1:37:44] leniency for a day and it was passed on
[1:37:48] to the Next Generation
[1:37:50] for the Next Generation to fight
[1:37:53] you know sometimes I think it's pretty
[1:37:55] selfish we won't deal with things
[1:37:56] because you're intentionally passing
[1:37:58] that thing and why I don't want my kids
[1:37:59] to deal with it then deal with it
[1:38:01] I don't want to hinder my grandkids than
[1:38:03] deal with it
[1:38:04] take care of the thing and quit showing
[1:38:06] it leniency before it gets passed on
[1:38:08] but I'm telling you tonight
[1:38:11] you don't have to be a saw
[1:38:14] none of this was to say you have to be a
[1:38:16] Saul because if you stay there right in
[1:38:18] the Book of Esther what you're going to
[1:38:19] find is that there's a Mordecai you can
[1:38:21] find a mordecai there who the Bible
[1:38:23] tells us in Esther 2 5 was a descendant
[1:38:25] of Kish
[1:38:27] he's a descendant of Kish
[1:38:30] and so what God is doing here is he's
[1:38:32] allowing an opportunity for someone to
[1:38:35] be a cycle breaker what he's saying is
[1:38:37] your granddaddy was supposed to do it
[1:38:39] and he's couldn't do it and he failed
[1:38:41] and your daddy was supposed to do it and
[1:38:43] he couldn't do it and failed but I ain't
[1:38:45] giving up on you I'mma give you your
[1:38:47] chance it's your time to deal with it
[1:38:50] it's your time to declare war Maybe
[1:38:52] daddy couldn't maybe Mama couldn't but
[1:38:54] now it's your turn to go to battle it's
[1:38:57] your turn to say this will hinder my
[1:38:59] family no more this will bring us down
[1:39:01] no more it's your turn it's your
[1:39:04] opportunity God hasn't given up on you
[1:39:07] it's your opportunity it's your turn to
[1:39:10] deal with the situation
[1:39:12] to say I'm not just gonna fight the
[1:39:15] comfortable enemies
[1:39:16] but I'm declaring Total War on anything
[1:39:18] that stands between me and my
[1:39:20] inheritance it dies here
[1:39:26] brother Brown says oh destroy that thing
[1:39:28] pick up that little old jebusite baby
[1:39:30] say he's so cute he grins so little so
[1:39:34] sweet he's a little heavy baby I'll just
[1:39:37] tell you the Bible says destroy that
[1:39:39] fellow not pet him and babe him he will
[1:39:41] raise up and be just like Daddy and the
[1:39:43] first thing you know you go to petting
[1:39:45] your sickness around and petting your
[1:39:47] little petties around and things like
[1:39:49] that because your neighbor don't believe
[1:39:50] in healing and your neighbor don't
[1:39:52] believe in the Holy Ghost destroy that
[1:39:54] thing let's go over and take the land
[1:39:57] Hallelujah
[1:39:58] he says there's the promised land she's
[1:40:00] flowing with milk and honey but before
[1:40:02] you get there you're gonna go through
[1:40:04] all these hivites and Canaanites and
[1:40:06] everything but don't you bow down to one
[1:40:08] of them you destroy the things as you
[1:40:10] come to them stop building fire on the
[1:40:13] enemy's altar wished I was twice my size
[1:40:16] right now maybe I'd feel twice as good
[1:40:18] oh I like that
[1:40:20] maybe I don't want to be twice my size
[1:40:22] but I could handle feeling twice as good
[1:40:25] he says I wish I was twice my size I'd
[1:40:28] feel twice as good
[1:40:29] churches we bring this to a close what
[1:40:31] is Total War for
[1:40:33] Total War is for total victory
[1:40:37] and it's right there before us we're
[1:40:40] standing right there at the final push
[1:40:42] the final battles and we're not going to
[1:40:45] get there by petting Devils we're not
[1:40:47] going to get there by letting things
[1:40:48] live this is at the culmination of it
[1:40:50] all and he fought a total war so that
[1:40:54] you could be totally redeemed he fought
[1:40:56] a total war so you could be totally
[1:40:58] healed so you could be totally filled
[1:41:00] that you could be totally delivered he
[1:41:02] fought a total war so that you could
[1:41:04] have total freedom and he's looking for
[1:41:07] a people
[1:41:08] that's willing to be totally committed
[1:41:10] all in that's willing to fight a total
[1:41:12] war
[1:41:13] like I said we're not worried about how
[1:41:15] people think we should fight our war
[1:41:16] it's our battle it's our war to win
[1:41:19] if it's in your way tonight
[1:41:21] Burn It Down
[1:41:23] if it's hindering you burn it down we're
[1:41:26] called to destroy the works of the devil
[1:41:30] I call this church
[1:41:32] to go on the offensive
[1:41:35] to quit sitting back and taking the
[1:41:37] punches to quit sitting back and
[1:41:39] allowing the Devil to come time after
[1:41:41] time but to take the word take your
[1:41:44] prayers take committal to God take the
[1:41:46] Holy Ghost take those weapons that God
[1:41:48] put in Your Arsenal gear up tonight and
[1:41:50] head out to battle gear up tonight and
[1:41:52] head out there to destroy anything that
[1:41:54] would stand in your way not sitting back
[1:41:56] and waiting you the Bible says right
[1:41:58] there and we're going to close with this
[1:41:59] the Bible tells us that the Gates of
[1:42:01] Hell shall not Prevail and many times I
[1:42:04] understand that that we feel like that
[1:42:06] means as they come against us they won't
[1:42:08] Prevail but gates are a defensive
[1:42:09] position
[1:42:10] gates are in walls that is a defensive
[1:42:13] position
[1:42:14] so what it's saying there is obviously
[1:42:16] you're supposed to be on the attack
[1:42:18] because when you come up against the
[1:42:19] Gate of sickness it will not Prevail
[1:42:21] when you come up the gate of depression
[1:42:23] it will not Prevail when you come and
[1:42:25] attack a gate of anxiety it will not
[1:42:27] Prevail he has no stronghold that can
[1:42:30] Prevail against you if you'll take the
[1:42:32] sword of the word if you'll go out in
[1:42:34] Courage and you'll stand there and say
[1:42:36] this is total war I'm fighting anything
[1:42:38] and everything that stands in my way in
[1:42:41] the way of my family in the way of my
[1:42:43] joy in the way of my peace in the way of
[1:42:45] total Victory what is total Victory the
[1:42:48] body change it's not just a down payment
[1:42:50] anymore but it's total war for total
[1:42:53] victory for the Rapture listen what does
[1:42:56] Total War do it settles the question oh
[1:42:59] let me tell you what church on Rapture
[1:43:01] morning there'll be no question who the
[1:43:03] Victor was there'll be no question who
[1:43:05] won the battle it's Rapture Day it's
[1:43:08] victory day it's going home day total
[1:43:11] war for total victory I say I want Total
[1:43:16] victory tonight I want Total victory
[1:43:19] tonight and I will wage total war
[1:43:22] on my enemies
[1:43:24] Hallelujah a few musicians can come
[1:43:26] tonight
[1:43:27] Hallelujah
[1:43:29] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:43:32] but thanks be to God
[1:43:34] which gives us the victory
[1:43:36] through our Lord
[1:43:38] Jesus Christ

[1:43:42] offensive

[1:43:49] been too long worried about you know not
