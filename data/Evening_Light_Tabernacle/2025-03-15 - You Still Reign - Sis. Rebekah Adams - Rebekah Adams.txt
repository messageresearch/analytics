========================================

When all foundations have been shen when I'm left standing in the dark and all I feel is my heart breaking. You still reign and you're still God. And when it feels all hope has faded, the heavy questions hit so hard. And through my soul may feel forsen, you still reign and you're still God. And though I can't see what's before me, I know that I can trust your heart. And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still gone. I will declare that you are with me. The voices whisper that you're not. You'll never leave me nor forsake me. Cuz you still reign and you're still God. I know I can't see what's before me. I know that I can trust your heart. And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. Though I can't see what's before me, I know that I can trust your heart. And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. And when my eneies surround me, I'll trust the victory of your cross. And fix my eyes upon you, [Music] Jesus. For you are God and I am not. Though I can't see what's before me. Oh, I know that I can't trust your heart. One truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still gone. You are good and you are [Music] faithful as you have been from the start. And you are working for your [Music] glory. Cuz you still reign and you're still God. Though I can't see what's before me, I know that I can trust your heart. And this one truth will be my story. You still reign and you're still God. [Music] You are good and you are faithful as you have been from the start. You're working all things for my [Applause] glory. Cuz you still reign and you're still God. You're working all things for your glory. Cuz you still rain and you're still gone. [Music] [Applause]
