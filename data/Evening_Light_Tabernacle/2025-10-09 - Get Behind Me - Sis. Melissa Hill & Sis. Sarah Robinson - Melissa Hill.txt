========================================

[Music] When fear like a viper strikes and worry starts to creep. I know that ain't my father's horse. It could only be that liar in my ear trying to make me believe. So I'm calling him out in the name of the Lord when I speak. Devil, get behind me. Run on home to the grave where you belong. In case you forgot, let me tell you the truth. You're stuck under my blood for food. Devil, get behind me. You got no hope. I've been changed by the Holy Ghost. Try all you want, but it ain't no use. You're stuck under my blood. Get behind me. Get behind me. Devil, get behind me. [Music] It's the power that raised my savior. It's the power that lives in me. So if you want to pick a fight, you better think twice. Cuz he's got an angel on me. Devil, get behind me. Back to the grave where you belong. In case you forgot, let me tell you the truth. You're stuck under my blood for food. Devil, get behind me. You got no hope. I've been changed by the Holy Ghost. Try all you want, but it ain't no use. You're stuck under my blood. Get behind me. Get behind me. Devil, get behind me. In the name of the Lord. In the name of the Lord. Get behind me. Get behind me. Devil, get behind me. In the name of the Lord. Devil, get behind me. Run on home. Back to the grave where you belong. In case you forgot, let me tell you the truth. You're stuck under my blood. Boots. Devil get behind me. You got no hope. I've been changed by the Holy Ghost. Try all you want, but it ain't no use. You're stuck under my blood. Get behind me. Get behind me, devil. Get behind me in the name of the Lord. [Music] [Applause]
