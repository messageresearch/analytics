I believe as the song says we shall see Miracles amen I believe we're seeing Miracles amen we want to say God bless you all this evening my such a wonderful presence in the building tonight we know that in an atmosphere like this all things are possible amen I know it may be a a Wednesday afternoon but amen I believe our God is the same on Wednesdays the same as he is on Sunday anden maybe we tonight just buy our hearts together and we just approach him for a moment and just ask him to come as we feel his presence here let's just invite him to come and speak to our hearts maybe you have a special need upon your heart tonight amen I believe he sees every hand I believe he sees the desires of every heart and I believe that his word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart now Heavenly Father we bow our hearts before you tonight in this atmosphere Lord realizing that we're not here alone but Lord there is a supernatural host in this building father to the world they would think we're crazy they would think we're oddballs but Lord we've been trained to believe in the Supernatural we've been taught that there is a supernatural host that accompanies this message and Lord we believe that wherever this message is preached the supernatural will take place so father as We Gather here tonight we're not Gathering as a natural people under a natural message following a natural light but Lord we're gathered here as that Supernatural people that has come forth from that Supernatural seed Lord with a supernatural faith and Lord you promised us a supernatural manifestation now father you see every hand that was raised here tonight behind that hand there is a need and whether it be a sickness oh God or a discouragement in the spirit whatever it may be Lord I know that you're more than able to come in this meeting tonight and by your word you're able to take that two-edged sword and cut between the soul and the spirit you're able to cut between the joints in the tomorrow for lord your Prophet taught us that the sword of Hebrews 4 is like a surgeon's knife and Lord we know Lord how cautious that a surgeon has to be when he handles that knife but Lord when the surgery is over the patient will be cut free from whatever is causing them suffering it'll set them free from whatever is causing them pain or Lord hindering them from living life to the fullness now Lord that's in the natural but tonight we're inviting you to come among us as the great physician take your sword oh God and cut away everything that's unlike you Lord and father May the children be able to leave here free may they be able to leave here encouraged oh God I pray for those that are homesick Lord I pray for our brother Timothy tonight lord they're suffering in his body I'm asking Lord that the angels of God would Minister to your servant Lord as he has just so Faithfully stood and poured out so much to be a blessing to your people now father may you pour back into him Lord and all those that are sick among us Lord may you bring healing in their bodies and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen do you love him tonight amen we want to say God bless you all this afternoon if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we'll invite you in the scriptures we want to turn to the book of Isaiah the 53rd chapter and while you're turning there tonight we want to just take this opportunity to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we bring a greetings from our pastor brother Shawn Martin the Saints there at Faith Tabernacle brother Sean said to be sure and greet brother Tim and brother Timothy for him so greetings from brother Shawn and we just coming again over from the uh Oklahoma Camp there uh sister Rachel stopped by the house there today at brother Joe's and amen she said well it's just after Oklahoma Camp tradition you know so uh here we are again but we're sure thankful for the opportunity to be here with you tonight and just seen the Lord do some wonderful things in the meetings there in in Oklahoma and the camp and we sure appreciate your prayers and support for that those of you that were there with us and I tell you you would uh I've had the privilege over the past two weeks to preach a meeting with brother Tim and brother Timothy and I just tell you all You' be proud of these men of God the word they brought in these meetings brother Tim there in Arkansas just the Lord used him in a supernatural way to bless the church there and then brother Timothy this weekend just poured his heart out and preached the power of this word and amen ain't it good to be identified with men that preach this message amen and they'll stand for this message and nothing else amen we sure appreciate these men of God and we tonight just want to take a few moments here with you in the scripture from the book of Isaiah the 53rd chapter and then we're also going to look at Matthew chapter 11 Isaiah 53 and verse number one the Bible here says who hath believed I report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed now I'm taking this from God hiding himself in Simplicity revealing himself in the same brother BR says in other words if you have believed our report then the arm of the Lord has been revealed so we asked a question who hath believed our report and he answers the question with a question that if you believe the report then the arm of the Lord is revealed somebody say revealed now in Matthew 11 and verse 25 St Matthew 11 and verse number 25 uh those of you will know I'm taking these scriptures I'm borrowing them from Brother bram's sermon God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same and in Matthew 11 and verse 25 the Bible here says at the time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and Hast revealed them them unto babes now the carnal mind would think that would be the other way that you've hid these things from babes and have revealed them to the wise and prudent but here he says I've hid him from the wise and prudent but has revealed them unto babes even so father for it for so it seemed good in thy sight and all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son Will will reveal him amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if I would speak to here if I title this tonight I want to talk to you on the Simplicity of God in the message of the hour see the Simplicity of God in the message of the hour I've just recently uh been a burden on my heart and started back through the seven seal book and tonight just taking a portion of this from God hiding himself in simplicity brother reads those two scriptures and says now can you catch those two scriptures who has believed I report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he said then Jesus thank God that he had hid the mysteries from the wise and prudent but would reveal it to babes such as would learn for it seemed good to God to do that now when you look here at this word revealed in the Greek that word revealed it means to uncover it means to lay open what has been veiled amen or covered up it is to disclose to make be to make known to make manifest to disclose what before amen was unknown so when something is revealed at one time it was covered it was disclosed it was veiled but when it is open then the beholder can see it amen in all of its beauty and all of its power now brother BR preaching there and he's opening the series there on the seven seal and he in the seven seal book in paragraph 164 of God hiding himself in Simplicity says now when God is just about to do something to deliver his people God sends a message to the people and it's so simple he said as well as catching the breaking of these seals we'll catch it there he said that was my purpose of bringing this first that we find out that the breaking of those seals is so simple amen that the smart will miss it a million miles he said see I hope that God anoints me for it see it just goes over the top he said but that's the reason I thought this message this morning would be appropriate Amen to lay a foundation of the Simplicity of God to see how that God hides himself in simplicity so here the prophet of God is saying that the opening of the word which we believe has come open amen the foundation of it is not education the foundation of it is not intellectualism but the foundation of the opening of the word amen is a foundation of Simplicity now you all know that John 16:13 says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come amen he will guide you into all truth he will not speak speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak amen and he will show you things to come how many can say tonight be on the shadow of a doubt I know that I have the spirit of Truth Amen on the inside of my heart now the prophet of God said when the new birth comes he said comes in it cannot come until there's a death first amen and people don't want to die they don't want the simple leadings of the Holy Spirit he said they want to take their own thinking of it but you cannot thank your own faults amen you've got to thank his thought so here amen is the foundation of the greatest Revelations that's going to come from the word amen is a foundation of Simplicity and a prophet says now let this mind that was in Christ be in you he said see he thanks God's thoughts and he brings God's blessing seek God's power to you it'll make a mess out of you as far as the world is concerned amen but it'll bring new life it'll bring resurrecting life it'll bring new thoughts it'll bring a new person it'll bring a new Faith it'll bring you amen from Death unto life amen can I say that what we believe as the Revelation amen of Jesus Christ is not a dead work amen it's not a dead Revelation it's not a powerless religion amen but I believe that it is have the power Amen to bring a new faith in the church I believe it has the power to turn sadness into Joy amen I believe it has the power to turn defeat into Victory I believe it has the power to turn confusion amen into clear understanding because it's not coming coming from the confusion of Education it is coming from the spirit of Truth now brother B prayed this he prayed actually his prayer amen is that God would raise up a simple people he said now said may your people that's called by your name may they be revived again he said bring us back to oldtime Pentecostal meetings Lord where the Holy Spirit can have the RightWay may we lay aside all of our learnings and just be simple people amen that is led by the holy spirit for we realize amen that this is the way he leads Amen in the way of simplicity so when God made man he did not make man amen to rely upon himself amen for his leadership but he made man to completely rely upon god brother said that's the reason we're liking the Lambs or Sheep amen is a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the holy spirit amen is supposed to lead us see so man is made that way now I want you to catch this church God made all of his works so simple amen that the simple could understand it and God makes himself simple with the simple in order to be understood by the simple amen that's a mouthful God the Mighty God makes himself simple and identifies himself with the simple Amen in order to be understood by the simple brother BR says when we do is we walk over the simple things amen looking for God when we ought to look at the simple things and we can see God in the nature right we can see him in the sun we can see him in the tree we we can see him in his Universe right we can see him in his word amen and we can see him in his people now the Bible speaks of a Time amen of a falling away or a turning back or a departing from the revealed truth and I'll just say this I believe amen it will be a people who are able or not able rather or they will simply lose their ability Amen to follow the simple leadership of the Holy Ghost that has been sent into this generation Jesus said to his disciples you know what he said to them he said said follow me in Matthew chapter or rather Luke 9 he said If any man will come after me Amen Let Him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me now watch this word follow means to follow one who proceeds Amen to join him as an attendant to accompany him to join one as a disciple Amen to become or be his disciple side with his party and the prophet of God said it very beautiful he said what we must follow him is the only way to have eternal life see so the leadership of God Amen is to follow the word of the hour the Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost now you all believe here tonight that you are the sons of God right you're the children of God see amen then the Bible tells us that the Son of God Amen was led by the spirit and it also says amen that the sons of God are led by the spirit as well in Matthew chapter rather Luke again chapter 4 ver1 I'll get my Matthew and Luke straight in a minute amen Luke chapter 4 ver1 the Bible said that that Jesus being full amen of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan amen and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness in Romans 8:14 the Bible said as many as are led by the spirit of God Amen they are the sons of God said the Bible speaks and says that it's his holy spirit that leads you amen then the same holy spirit that led Simeon to believe that is the same holy spirit that lead you Amen to believe in Divine Healing amen there's no two holy spirits amen the same holy ghost that led Simeon Amen to believe that God was a God who keeps his word he is a God that no matter how dark it gets no matter amen how many walks away God will not make a promise and then back off of that promise but if God made you a promise he will bankrupt Heaven amen before he lets one of those promises fail you come on church I think it's time to remember amen that the Holy Ghost wasn't one for the apostles and brother Bram got one and this one got another one amen but it's the same Holy Ghost amen from Genesis to Revelation amen from 47 to 65 amen it is the Holy Ghost of God coming into the church amen to strip the church away from the ideas of Education the complications of religion and to come back to the Simplicity amen the god leading his church now amen when you start talking about the Holy Ghost amen how can we not talk about the power of the Holy Ghost amen how many agree the Holy Ghost has got power it's got power to save it's got got power to heal it's got power to deliver it's got power to cast out Devils it's got power to reveal the secrets of hearts come on Church the Holy Ghost is a powerful Holy Ghost and the prophet of God said then that's what power is in the church now amen but it is controlled by a law see and that law is not keeping a bunch of carnal Commandments but it's a law of faith for Jesus said amen all things are possible to them that believe how many Believers have I got here amen and if you can believe it now listen if you you can believe it then whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours amen if you can believe it then whatever God Amen will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place the soul of your foot can set up on by faith amen God gives it to you it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of Faith amen that opens it to you you see what I mean if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God Amen that never leaves you amen it's with you all the time amen but your faith can get away from it but it's still there then I love that because amen it's not just on my good days amen that the Holy Ghost is leading me it's not when I feel like the Holy Ghost is leading me it's not when I can sense the Holy Ghost is leading me amen but there is a law of Faith Amen in the soul of a Believer amen and when you're on the mountain he will lead you when you're in the valley he will lead you when you're in the wilderness he will lead you amen when you're sick he will lead you when you're well he will lead you listen I don't believe it's time to back off amen of the leadership of the Holy Ghost and go find a new leader I think if there's ever been a time to come back to the leadership of the spirit of truth and the message of the hour I say Now's the Time to do it amen you may get away from it but it don't get away from you amen then listen if the Lord leads you to believe it amen then you got a right to believe it and you got a right to possess it if God come on church if God leads in a service to believe for a miracle you've got a right to believe for that miracle if God leads you to believe for a healing you got a right to believe for that healing if God leads you to believe for the Salvation of a prodal you got a right to believe that we talk a lot about putting our foot Amen on the head of the devil and we believe in that don't we amen but I think it's time we turn that from the negative to the positive amen we put our foot on the head of the devil amen but now I think it's time to make some footsteps amen as possession in the land of in inance to this Joshua generation listen we've not been called Amen to come up to the border of the land and back off and say well it's too hard or or it's to this or it's to that but we have been anointed by the message of the hour amen the opening of the word has placed an anointing upon the church to move into every promise that God has made amen I love the definition of this word simple amen it means easily understood or done amen it is presenting no difficulty it is used to emphasize the fundamental and straightforward nature of something plain basic or uncomplicated in form amen nature or design it is without much decoration amen or ornamentation now can I just say this to you we're living in a world where everything is complicated I think we can all agree on that point amen everything from education to government to science Amen to political systems amen the economy is even compli am mean everything around us is complicated and let me just say this what's not already been complicated amen just give it a few days and it will be amen amen it used to be you just go open the refrigerator and get you out something cold to drink amen but now you got about have a college degree Amen to even get in the thing because there's so much science and so much education taking over these things amen now listen the devil don't stop out there but that devil moves right in the message of the hour churches and tries to start complicating things amen but let me say this we will not bow our knee and we will not follow a spirit of organized religion amen that raises its head around this message amen because organized religion is what took the word of God and made it complicated and made it difficult and made it confusing because the prophet of God said organized religion amen does not tend a simple word he said in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word and the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost amen for organization tends toward dogma and Creed amen and not simple word they could no longer speak for God so then God sent Wesley and he was a voice with a word in his day and the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has come on through the years until this last day amen there is again another people Amen in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice Amen to the final age amen whenever organized religion moved in amen God raised a standard and he raised the people to follow that standard and the people become the combativeness amen to the spirit of organized religion well let me just say this to you we are not amen the denominational Brides but we are that voice that has been spoke up by the word Prophet amen we will be raised up by the message of the hour am met another people in the land can I say this to you another people is a simple people acts 15:14 said see declared how God at first did visit the Gentiles now what did he do this for Amen to take them out a people amen for his name amen I love this brother said I believe that you're risen from the dead in 2,000 years ago and you are alive tonight amen you're calling as simple people just as you've always did there'll be one here and one there no groups no Organization no great manners of what man had done but you said you would take a people out of the Gentile a people there would be two in the field I will take one leave on two in the bed I'll take one leave on are you ready for this he said a people here and there amen for your name's sake the bride amen so that tells me amen that the bride brother Mark the bride amen is the simple people of Acts 15 amen that will be the final voice to the final age and they will stay underneath the headship of their messenger he said Heavenly Father through our hearts we will see the spirit move among the simple people just plain simple people I'm afraid father many of us teachers has tried to make it so complicated for the people amen but in our great day of learning we are in now everything everyone smart educated spend all their time studying books and so forth getting Scholarships in school learning science literature mathematics and left out the Holy Spirit now listen I'm going to preach tonight amen because that's why there's 900 plus denominations amen we might as well preach we're here tonight amen that's why there's two soul and peruse well might as well preach and return and seven thunders in this camp and that camp is because men amen without the Holy Ghost invaded pull pits and begin to study things they shouldn't study begin to say things should never come across a message pull pit and brought a spirit of confusion among the church but listen I believe there's a simple people on the face of the Earth tonight who has been called by the same holy ghost that called William brandom has called this generation and we are not ACH to educate ated intellectual amen but we are a simple people who believes God can come in our services on a Wednesday night and defeat Devils we are a simple people who believes God still gives baren wombs babies we are simple people who believes that cancer can still lead bodies at the preaching of the word of God we are as simple people who still believes Mark 16 is an action we are as simple people who still believes we can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover listen we ain't replacing the Holy Ghost with Psych ology we believe there's still power in the message of the hour to whip a devil anywhere anytime any place come on church under any conditions the word will defeat the Devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition that's why brother B said see in the midst of all of that amen draw out a people that loves you in the midst of all the confusion draw out of people who loves you and believes you Lord let me say this I believe he's here amen drawing out a simple people you ready for this that believes he can do anything I said I believe he's here drawing out a simple people who loves him and believes he can do anything y'all remember in Matthew 16 the Bible said that the that the the disciples were come to the other side and they had forgotten to take some bread and Jesus said to them take he and beware the 11 of the Pharisees and Sadducees 16:7 and they reason among themselves saying it's because we've taken no bread which when Jesus perceived that he said to them oh ye little faith while reason you among yourselves because you brought no bread do you not understand neither remember the Five Loaves of the 5,000 and how many baskets you took up neither the seven loaves of the 4,000 and how many baskets you took up how is it that you do not understand that I spake to you not concerning bread that you should be aware of the Le of the Pharisees and Sadducees then understood they how that he bath them out of Beware B them not Beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees now here's what he's doing as he's saying amen the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees amen is a Doctrine Amen to rob you of the power to believe that God can do anything any time any place anywhere under any condition brother must ask a question what did Jesus mean in St Matthew 169 and 10 what do the 12 baskets and seven baskets represent he said in other words like this if you seen God provide and do a miracle then can he not do a miracle again if you seen him do it one time can he not do it again if you seen him save one time can he not save again if you seen him heal one time can he not heal again if you seen him resurrect one time can he not resurrect again I tell you what we ought to do tonight we ought to shake off ever sadducee and Pharisee doctrine that is creping around this message and say well it could only happen this time and could only happen that time and could only happen this time but I am a believer it can happen again and again and again and again and again I believe he can save again I believe he can refill again I believe he can revive again see in other words if he saves you from a life of sin can he not heal your body amen if he saves you from a life of sin can he not heal your body don't you remember when you was a sinner how he lifted your soul and Faith to believe can he not likewise do something great amen for you again can he do the miracle or anything else for you he said remember like when they crossed the Red Sea God opened the way like that and made the Red Sea open and walked through come right on the other side and as soon as they got without water they started murmuring as soon as they got without bread they started crying we don't have no bread see said didn't you consider the miracle back there with the Red Sea well they got in a spot by the Red Sea they said we ought have died here coming Egyptian right on this now here it is what are we going to do he said who smoke the Earth was plague still there who kept the sun shining and gohing see we must remember those things and remember that God is God hallelujah he said any of it he's still God he certainly can do anything now you know when you become you know when you become a complicated people is when something happens between one miracle and another and you think because of what happened something can't happen good again well we might as well preach we here amen because youve seen one Victory and then there was little space of trouble and the Devil comes in and says because of that trouble and that situation then that's going to hinder God Amen from working again but I come here not to say the devil is a liar amen and there is a people here tonight who says I don't matter what condition I'm in I don't care what way I'm in if God moved before he can move again come on evening lot y'all got a youth camp in a few days amen God has blessed that camp God has used that camp amen I stand here tonight as a testimony of the Youth Camp of Louisiana amen and I'll say this amen if God did it for me he can do it for anybody if God did it before he can do it again I think it's time to kick out the Pharisee and saddu doctrine that is so complicated the movement of the Holy Ghost and bring a liberty back in the church to believe for the impossible to believe for a miracle to believe for the come on didn't he open the Red Sea didn't he bring the walls of Jericho down didn't he raise the Widow of Nam son didn't he heal blind barus didn't he save the woman at the well didn't he give him the upper didn't he give him the holy ghost in the upper if he did it before he can do it again if he did it before he can do it again because he's still God can I say this brother lemel he simply still God I felt good he simply still God and brother William if he's simply still God then we're simply still Believers hello somebody if he's simply still God we're simply still Believers and if thou can't believe then some things are possible a few things are possible one Miracle here and there is possible one Revelation here and there is possible amen what Pharisee Bible are you reading out of Amen if fou can't believe amen all things are possible to them that believe Hallelujah Noah was a simple believer and he preached the gospel you know what it was it was out of the way it was out of line with the way of the believer now that's the problem amen is if somebody believes one way and God says something different you got to leave the way somebody's believing and go with God and stand with God in the face of criticism in the face of hery come on in the face of heresy whatever you got to do you got to stand with God and believe that God is still God and His word is still true his power is still here he said see this simple sheep herder believed if God said it would rain It Would Rain just compare that with today about somebody gets healed they say well it's only emotion or I can scientifically prove to you that the cancer or the substance or the thing is still there are you ready for this amen scientifically amen they can prove the substance they can prove the cancer is still there I love what a prophet said but Timmy said but to the believer it's gone come on to science it's still there but to the believer it's gone because he's not looking at the substance amen he's looking at the promise come on Church he's not looking at the substance he's not looking at the report he's not looking at the signs he's looking at the promise and the promise says it's gone amen I say tonight give us this s Phoenician woman's attitude she was a simple believer and the prodag God said I lay hands upon this sister may she have the attitude of the s bonan woman may she be healed in Jesus Christ's name are y'all ready for this he said let the heart be well in the name of Jesus Christ I speak these words it has to be well amen it can't be anything else I love that let the heart be well it has to be well it can't be anything else because Jesus said I can if you believe now if he can make a squirrel appear like that like he did a Ram one time he can make that heart appear normal and well has to be in the name of Jesus Christ let the heart be well now isn't that simple it is simple but God is so simple are you ready for this now you just be simple enough not to even think about it anymore God was simple enough to heal you of it he was simple enough Amen to send a man in the pullit and say the Cancer's gone the sickness is defeated Christ is the Healer amen God was simple enough Amen to send a simple word to send a simple healing into your body let's just be simple enough to believe it amen if God said I'm Healed I'm going to believe I'm Healed if God said I'm delivered I'm going to believe I are y'all hearing me the message of the Hour come Amen to break the confusion and bring a simple people back who could just simply take God and his word and walk on rejoicing and praising God I love how brother talks about the Indian man brought his father to the meeting one time he said now brother BR I packed him across the river on a stretcher I said sir aren't you afraid amen that you'll take pneumonia he said no Jesus Christ is take care of me I bring my father I said you believe he said yes that's why I brought him he said I said pass him on by and as he went by I laid my hands over on the old man and I said dear God an old ancient father here laying here old and crippled up and shaken with py like F I said have mercy on him God and heal him I pray in Jesus name I said now take him on as you believe so will it be I brought another one the next one coming just a tired I could hardly stand there but then all of a sudden I heard somebody amen screaming and going on it looked and the old man had the board on his own shoulders and he was going along W when everybody like that amen just walk along amen just that simple but you try to figure it all out how it happens and that's the reason you miss it amen but they just simply believe let me say this friends quit trying to figure it out and believe the word that's being spoken over your life and let that word whip that devil and bring a healing into your body well I don't know how this can happen I don't know how the change I don't know how the situations can happen I know how it can happen if somebody step out and take God at his word and believe that if he did it before he can do it again are y'all hearing me I think it's time to take the restrictions and the limitations off of our faith and start saying God your God in the face of every difficulty in the face of every bad day in the face of every trial my God remains on the throne as God come on we might as well preach or here amen I believe it's the season for miracles I believe it's the season for victories I believe it's the season for the supernatural you know what I believe is out of season bu your cold formal ritualistic ideas around this message is out of season amen but the power of the Revelation that's been seasoned with the anointing of God is in season for every believer who can sit at the table and can feed upon the promises of God listen I believe we're living in a special time I believe it's a time where things are happening amen and we can't figure out how they're happening we can't figure out why they're happening but we know one thing they're happening come on we might as well preach we're here amen y'all realize you're living in a SE I've been I've been using your church for a few days amen we're living in a season amen where we're not turning prayer request in on Wednesday and 3 months later still praying about it but we're living in a season amen where a prayer request can be turned in and can be healed in the same service are you hearing me it's a season to believe these things I was preaching out in Georgia a few years ago there was a paricus come in right before I got up to preach there was a lady in the hospital during Co there was a lady in the hospital she had a high fever in a terrible condition Amen brother Tim we just stood there and prayed and pronounced the word of God over her and about halfway through the sermon they brought a prayer request up and laid it down and I turned it over and I begin to read it and this is what it said as the Saints begin to pray the fever broke she's doing better getting ready to go home well when I said that it literally like somebody opened the floodgates of heaven and an anointing dropped in that building you know what's happening friends the Supernatural is happening Miracles are taking place but we got to kick that old formal devil out that says the message can't do it and preaching the word can't do it I believe they're still power in the preaching of the Simplicity of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the age we're living in y'all know y'all remember a few years ago amen our sister come up for prayer for her brother who was out of church amen I want to sing back in church brother justware probably you're not amen he's here amen I want to see him back in the house of God right amen do you realize it wasn't four Services later he showed up it wasn't six months later amen but within a matter of minutes amen her prayer request turned into a testimony and that testimony has gone around the world whipping devils and encouraging faith for mamas and families to believe if God Did It for Justin he can do it for their family I'm talking about a God who it's time to take the limits off of him and believe simply believe Hallelujah simply believe if God did it before he can do it again hallelujah amen simply believe let me say this with a simple faith will come a simple confession and I love what the prodag God says he says that's what people who get he said that's what people get who try to figure it out they miss it but you just believe it and when God says it just say that's right God that's right God see that can change the atmosphere in a service when the word Goes Forth and you say that's right God glory when the anointing is moving and you say that's right God when brother Joe's up here preaching and says the healings here the miracle here when brother Tim's laboring or the anointing amen something moving you and say that's right God see what that is that's not emotion that's not sensation that's not a preacher trying to get an amen for his ego amen that's the anointing moving a simple believer to a simple confession I love this brother said Jesus talked with such a simple language with the simple people see he wasn't out there great big swelling outstanding hold on for dear life as I call it words and miss it he said now watch the more simpler you can get amen the higher God will raise you the more simpler you get the higher God will raise you now you say brother anderw what is a simple person a simple person never questions the word of God I love Proverbs 14:15 the simple believeth every word amen but The Prudent man lookth well to his going remember said but those simple people they never question they don't question they see something done that settles them every one of them he said you should never question the word of God that's what got the whole human race in trouble when Eve question whether God would keep all this word or not I say tonight Brethren are you ready for this I say tonight Brethren it's come time that we must believe every word that God wrote every bit of it to be the truth now in order to believe sometimes you got to lay some things aside the protag God said go back to the beginning therefore if we're going to talk on the church age we got to go back to the beginning we got to lay aside every statement that has been made down through the age if we're going to believe the Revelation that is coming to us we've got to lay aside everything that's contrary to the word of God Amen I love how the prophet of God gives us three identifications of simple Believers he said now watch follow the generation of Seth they were humble they were peasants they were farmers on down to the destruction but kan's children was smart intellectual group they could temper copper make Metals Builders they were smart men when these other men amen just dwelt in tents and heard their sheep here it is and rested upon the promises of God see just follow the genealogy that's how Noah was chose from that kind of people that's how Paul was taken from that flock see that's how John Wesley Martin Luther what more that's how you come to be what you are today the same thing amen humbled to believe the promises of God so the message of the hour is coming to the church amen to Humble them to Simply believe the promises of God I love how the Bible tells us in Genesis 18:17 that the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely amen become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth amen shall be blessed in him in Matthew 5:5 Jesus says blessed are the meek amen for they shall inherit the promises now in other words the humbled ones amen are the ones who will inherit the promises of God in the breach B said Jesus blessed are the meek the simple ones they don't try to be something great big they shall inherit the earth and Jesus said so now they polluted it and God will destroy them but the meek shall inherit the earth amen after it's been purified can I say this to you amen God will hide his Secrets amen from the wise and prudent but he will reveal them to the bride which will become babes which will which will learn of him he said all this Myster is revealed only is he Pro promis to his bride and hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery amen now watch this church that's why the prophet had to come and release this mystery because hell is against this bride he says but the bride is standing on it see that's her stand he said that's her stand where's her stand on the revelation of Jesus Christ listen that's where we stand on our good days is on the Revelation that's SAR we stand on our bad days is on the Revelation when we're on the mountain we stand on the Revelation when we're in the valley we stand on the Revelation listen the message of the hour has come to give the church a place to stand now I'm going to say this that little girl that little faith woman brother Tim preached a beautiful message on it there in Arkansas amen that little faith woman amen she's not living by what she can see she's not living by what she can feel amen she's living by faith amen and that is the faith of Jesus Christ and brother tells us a beautiful story of a little girl who was chosen amen by the armor son to be his bride you know what brother BR called her he said that girl was simple-minded that little girl that was chosen to be the wife of the armor son he said she was simple-minded Revelation 19:7 said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come amen and his wife hath made herself ready remember said there she was she got herself already ready all cleaned up all washed and the wedding garment on now want I want you to catch something here and you know what as it got closer the more critical got her little cousins let me ask you this when did they get critical they didn't get critical when she said he's coming back for me they didn't get critical amen when she went and got washed up they didn't get critical when she got cleaned up but when she put the wedding garments on when she put the wedding garments on is when they begin to get critical of her amen because now she's changing positions amen from just a girl amen from a girlfriend from just a fiance but she has now put on the wedding garments and the protagon said they say you poor little simpleminded thing do you mean to tell me if the armor son would marry somebody he would marry somebody like us somebody who had some fit and Society had some education had some glamour about them he said see that's the way the church thinks today but how far off they are they're way off amen listen friends that's why we got Liberty to shout that's why we got Liberty to Rejoice that's why we got Liberty to enjoy the blessings of the message amen it's because we're not a girlfriend we're not flirting with the message but the prophet of God said if I can get her to stand still long enough amen I will dress her in the garments of the word and there is a bride on the Earth today lay out a sea as naked amen but there's a bride who is dressed with the wedding garments on there's no spots on them there's no wrinkles on them and you know what's happening they're getting more critical they're getting more critical of our worship they're getting more critical of our preaching or get more critical of our singing or get more critical of the anointing amen but you know what I say criticize all you want to amen because one of these mornings between 6:00 and 9 that horse is going to come down the road and the butt board's going to open and I'm going to step in and I'm going to leave here in the moment in the twinkl of an ey call me simple-minded if you want to criticize me if you want to but I'm just simple enough to believe if he said he was going to come get me he's going to come get me I'm just simple enough to believe if he said I was going to be his bride he ain't going to save me or lose me he ain't going to teach me to swim and Let Me Drown he ain't going to build his home in me to move away I'm talking about somebody who's not just standing around looking at the wedding garments but they have put the wedding garments on Hallelujah well go ahead and walk around in them for a minute go ahead and enjoy the blessings of being the Bride of Jesus Christ come on y'all know I'm preaching the truth tonight amen they can laugh they can criticize they can call us holy rollers they can call us emotionalist they can call us message Fanatics they can call us what they want to but some morning between 6:00 and 9 they're going to have to change what they call us they're going to have to call us gone because we're not going to be here because the message of the hour has brought a change upon the church hallelujah amen there's a change on the church now I'll said to you like this I don't believe the message come to give us a puffed up mind as a matter of fact I believe it came to Humble us brother BR preaches a message called humble thyself he said I was thinking on a little illustration amen can I read this to you he said to back up what he said now look at this watch to find out what time it is unless every instrument in that watch is coordinating on with the other will never know the correct time said and that LS all of us all together if we want to see the Third P really do something for God it's coordination with every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God and confess our wrong and pray and believe God for those things how many believes we're in the third pole now the problem of God said God can only operate as we let him operate he said you know people want power and really they don't know what power is now now now put your seat but I'm going to preach for a minute if that's okay brother Tim amen they don't know what power is they don't really know what goes up they don't know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power amen see how humble you can get now you know what amazes me is the people that fight about the power in the message are the most arrogant people I think I've ever met now come on church but watch a prophet just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you've got more power amen than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him amen that's really power so here a prophet is connecting power with the ability to humble yourself the prophet is connect oh God have mercy the prophet is connecting power with the ability to lay aside what we want and to accept what God wants now you all know if you're going to a church amen and got got a good siiz crowd of people here amen listen there's always going to be somebody who thinks it ought to be done a little bit different than the way it's being done well if we could change this then that would fix that and if we could change that that would fix this and if brother Tim would change this and brother Aaron would change that amen but let me just say this if you would change it might fix a lot of things come on now amen always trying to fix everything and change everybody amen but sometimes we need to look in the mirror and realize the problem ain't the song leader the problem ain't the musicians the problem ain't the new people that moved in the church the problem ain't all these other things the problem is standing in the mirror looking at oursel when we get ready and the problem is we're too arrogant to say somebody else is right and that might be a better way to do it oh glory to God we might as well preacher here a well I don't like when they sing that song that song's too new you know I don't like that song amen now come on Amen so then you got that whole bunch of well we ought to just sing old songs you know amen let's just sing them old Lutheran songs and brother Tim I've sat in services and we sang songs that Luther didn't even know and it didn't change the anointing a bit more than if we have sung our God is Awesome come on church amen well I think we ought to change this amen but why don't we change us come on why don't we humble our ideas come on Church y'all know what I'm talking about amen let them sing a song you don't like amen listen we all know you don't like it amen cuz that's when you go to the bathroom or you look back at the musicians or you look glory to God somebody preach are you with me now amen but sometime or another you got to humble yourself and say God it's not about me and it's not about you it's about him it's about you Lord coming in the building and blessing somebody it's about you Lord coming in the sanctuary and deliver in somebody's heart it's about you Lord it ain't about the way I think it ain't about what I want it's about him can I let y'all in a little secret down here you on a little secret there's songs I don't like say that again and you know how you knew that because I told you you didn't know that because the way I act when they sing them well come on Church you didn't know that cuz I put a post on Facebook about the songs and everything you didn't know that you know how you knew that cuz I told you now you know why I told you it's because I'm not a baby I was with some brothers the other day and they got talking about some songs and they said well we're going to sing this one I said you know I I really never have cared for that song but what' you say that's what they said how we didn't know that I said no you didn't you know why cuz I'm not a baby I'm a mature adopted son of God and I've Been Around Church long enough to know if they sing a song I Don't Like give it five minutes and they're going to sing another song now let me say this if he comes on how great thou art or I would not be denied or there power in the blood or Pass Me Nots or we will see Miracles or our god is awesome what difference does it make as long as he comes into the sanctuary and begins to bless his church and begins to heal the sick as long as he comes we ought to take the shackles h of the atmosphere release the atmosphere and let the Holy Ghost find a simple people who believes God is still God and His word is still true and his power is still here and his anointing can still destroy the Yoke of the enemy anywhere anytime any place under any conditions we want to see God take the brakes off the [Applause] atmosphere now the prodag God said conquer yourself commit yourself to Christ humble yourself before him that's really power you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogancy a church a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God put your seat belts on letting God work through us don't have to make a L of noise now there's all them noise people right there amen will you amen too quick because there's a difference in noise and sound hello somebody there's a difference in noise and sound most people generally think of sound and noise as being the same thing however there is actually a difference between noise versus sound sound is a type of energy that travels through the air or any other medium and is then heard when it reaches a person's ear so while the word is being preached he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying and the prophet of God said the Holy Ghost is the energy oh God the Holy Ghost is the energy of the church so when the word is being preached the energy of the Holy Ghost picks that word up and carries it to your ear and puts it in in your heart and you say Amen now a lot of people say that's a bunch of noise that's not noise that's sound because noise can be described as unwanted sound can I ask you this I know there's some places that amens are unwanted sound but wherever Jesus is wherever Jesus is amens are not nois now people say well wherever Jesus says there's a whole lot of noise and brother Andrew you just said amen that there was a difference in sound and noise there is is a difference in sound and noise and when Jesus passed by barus you know what the prophet God said he said there was a lot of noise but you know where that noise was coming from it was coming from those who did not want him passing by where he was so the prophet of God said what they done was they formed a committee and they said well squash all this nonsense amen but there was a difference in barus barus had a revelation barus was in a terrible condition but when he heard oh God when the word got car to his ear that is Jesus of Nazareth passing by listen barnes's cry wasn't a why barnes's cry wasn't a w w w why his cry was a confession and as he begin to cry he was crying from a revelation that Jehovah of the old was the same God that got in Jesus and barus begin to say he's passing by Jesus thy son of David have mercy on me and you know what they said they said sh sh sh but you know what he did he cried the more a great deal you know why because he was in the position to receive his healing he was in the position listen in other words barus could look around and say I know you bunch of backslid and Pharisees and Sadducees really don't need nothing from God but I need something from God I need oh God I need something from God so you know what barame done he begin to cry out you know what he begin to say he begin to say Jesus have mercy upon me and the pr of God said Jesus didn't hear his voice but he failed his faith out of all that confusion brother Joe amen God had a simple man with a simple faith that believe God could still open blinded eyes and he began to say you can make fun of me if you want to you can laugh at me if you want to but I need a miracle well glory to God I think it's time Church to get back to crying out for God I think it's time to Humble ourselves well come on church amen humble ourselves and follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost if you got to cry for it cry for it if you got to holler for it holler for it but let me say this don't you don't you confuse noise and sound well brother Andrew all them young people shouting around that's a bunch of noise well if you'd been as bound as we had you know why it's noise to you is cuz you're exalted and you're high and you got a high well Glory you got a high opinion of yourself but if you ever was where we were if you ever was as lost as I was lost if you was ever bound as Andrew Glover was bound if you was ever as confused as I was confused and then Jesus come walking on the Waters of your situation and call you out and guide you to freedom and guide you there would be a shout and you know what I say I say bring back the Liberty to bless the name of God bring back the Liberty to enjoy a freedom to enjoy a victory I'm talking about the sound of Freedom I'm talking about the sound of Deliverance I'm talking about the sound of the Kings coming in the camp It Ain't Noise It Ain't Noise freedom is not unwanted come on Church freedom is not unwanted stimulation by Revelation is not unwanted Miracles are not unwanted babies being saved is not unwanted healings taking place in bodies is is not unwanted we welcome we welcome the supernatural we welcome Freedom we welcome Miracles we welcome the anointing we welcome revelation we welcome the sh Glory come on we welcome it we welcome him in the sanctuary with all of his power with all of his anointing with all of his ability we welcome him with the supernatural we've not well come on somebody we ain't got so so high and mighty we can't welcome God now you saider what are you getting at well the Bible says we're living in the hour where there would be an unfolding or the revealing of the word of God now I love the book of Psalms can I share a few more things with you 119 130 the entrance of thy words giveth light are you ready for this it giveth understanding unto the simple now that word entrance is an open opening unfolding it's an entrance it's a doorway so in other words God enters the church through Simplicity now God unfolds himself in Simplicity in second Peter 11:11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said God's great mystery now being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured it all the way down through now watch he said down to the ages he has been slowly unfolding this mystery can you see now another place down to the ages he has been gradually letting it out slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets and through the types now watch this in Christ the mystery paragraph 301 he said blind leaders to Blind notice god holds the key alone no Theologian can tell you if it's not known it's hid from them they know nothing about it so the schools when you say I got a pH or lldd to me and I believe in God now watch this he said now you say I got a pH or an lld to me and I believe into God and to any real True Believer that means you're just that much farther away you just backed off God is not known by education he's not known by how to explain it but God is known by the Simplicity and the revelation of Jesus Christ ready for this to the most illiterate person see now not your theology it's a revelation Upon This Rock I build my church no other rocks are accepted no other things accepted no other Roman Rock no other Protestant Rock no other school no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new birth he borns in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of Christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminence to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of it's not even called to at all Watch God's Great Revelation unfolding now the promise of the hour is in the age of confusion there will come an understanding in Psalms 119:130 he says the entrance of thy words giveth light it giveth understanding amen unto the simple that word understanding means to have insight and the pro God says paragraph 127 God hid himself not today he said now today we preach philosophy we preach Creed denominationalism and so many things leaving off the word because they say it cannot be understood it can be understood it has to be he promised to do it now listen friends in the last days they're going to say we've gone as far as we can go because the things in the message are too hard to understand like we can't move in that third pool we can't move in that seventh seal we can't move into the theophanies we can't move into the promises of God we cannot move into future home we cannot move into Daniel 7 we cannot move into the adoption we cannot move in these things because they're too hard to understand but I love what Psalms 106 ver6 says it says we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly and our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the Red Sea nevertheless he saved them amen for his name's sake that he might make his power to be known in other words amen God saved them so the Next Generation could testify amen of what God done amen for them at the Red Sea let me say this young people amen this message has not come to this generation to just be put back on a former generation or well I remember when I remember when but these men of God like brother Tim amen our brother bisc amen these Elders that had blazed the trail you know what they've done they brought us to the border and they haven't said now stay out of that message they said go into that message amen because there is where the mercies of God is there is where the grace of God is and you know what I say I say it's time to take our foot and kick that door down it says we cannot move into the revelation of what a prophet is taught in the age we're living in brother I believe it's moving time I believe it's time to move out of shallow Waters I believe it's time to move out of ankle deep water I believe it's time to move into some swimming Waters you are the generation that is set underneath the voice of the word and an entrance are you hearing me an entrance has been ministered unto you oh mercy now watch this God is so easy to be misunderstood by unbelievers by those who don't want to understand now we just now we just figured out brother Jimbo they don't want to understand so the reason they don't want to understand is the reason they don't want you to understand many people try to understand but they don't want to understand they just shut up themselves and say there's no such a thing I don't believe in such see then they can never understand but a man that's willing to understand that's willing to sit down come let us reason together say the Lord now that man is on the line of learning something from the Lord what are you saying I'm saying you got to kick the unbelief out you got to move out of the depths of Satan now come on Church the world is drowning in the depths of Satan by accepting substitutes for the reality but there is an open book there's an open door I'm going I'm going somewhere listen to me Church you don't have to stay where you're at are you hearing me you don't have to stay where you're at there's a door that's been Minister unto you and watch what the prop of God says the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testim of the Lord making wise the simple so if you're going to go through this door you've got to move into the Simplicity of the way God does things listen the pr of God said very beautiful he said those little handkerchiefs God always hon that such a simple thing as print over a handkerchief now can I say this to you who would have thought that a shout would bring a wall down but it did who would have fought a wall that you could run chariot races on top of would have brought would oh God would have brought a wall down but when they begin to shout the Bible the prag God said watch when they begin to shout he said see it's so simple but that's what makes it God to me he said when they begin to shout don't dig out the wall but just sound the trumpet and the walls will fall down the blast of the trumpet will knock the walls down how foolish to the caral mind but God proved his word was true for the walls fell down amen one on top of the other they went straight up and they took the city are y'all hearing me they went straight up and they took the city amen God chose a simple method to reveal his word through prophets and he said Elijah simple sort of a person serve God's purpose he said now watch are you ready for this he just had sense enough to believe God simple that's it that's the kind of people God works hides himself is simple God identifies himself in the unidentified things he said God could take that simple man and put his words in his mouth it come into human lips he said now watch A Simple Man and the blood of bulls or goats first thing you know Moses a green fly began to fly around the next thing you know five pounds what was it was the word of God spoke through Moses the Creator because under the blood he was standing in the presence of God his own words wasn't his word I'm closing on this if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be given to you where's the church standing at Let There Be frogs and there wasn't a frog in the country but in an hour's time brother Josh in in hour's time they were 10 foot deep in some places he said see what was it it was God the Creator hiding himself in a simple man I want to ask you something can I ask you something NE light if the blood of a bull or goat be used for a bleach which can only cover could put a man in position to speak the creative word of God and bring flies into existence then why would you stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ's blood when you could speak a squirrel or something into existence don't you do it don't you stumble over Simplicity but you believe that he still remains God hallelujah don't you stumble over the simple ways that God decides to deliver his children you believe he's still God are you hearing me you say brother and a simple people yeah a simple people often has been referred to as simple and you know what a simpleton is it's a person who's gullible or foolish enough to just believe what they hear I raised my hand brother Caleb and I say I am proud to be called a simpleton of the teachings of William Mary and brandham I am proud to be called a gullible foolish young preacher to stand and say what a prophet said listen friends it's more than a book it's more than a tape an entrance has been ministered unto you you don't have to stay where you're at are you hearing me you don't have to stay where you're at the preaching of the message of the hour in the Simplicity is opening a whole new world to you oh God it's opening a whole new world you say preacher I don't know if God's able look at your neighbor and say God's able you looked at the wrong one look at somebody else and say God's able brother Aaron God's able brother Tim God's able brother Joe God is able amen I say even like God is able Hallelujah brother Phillip God is able he's able to heal he's able to deliver he's able to restore he's able to refresh he's able to bring back the new again I say my God is Not on a holiday somewhere my God is right here in the preaching of the message of the hour and he's able I said he's able if you're able to believe he he's able to perform if you're able to take him at his word he's able to fulfill his word He's Able I said he's able brother Ben He's Able He's Able these stones to raise children under Abraham you know what the prod of God said he said God's able to heal aome or a fish or anything if he will bring his message forth and the people won't believe it then God will raise up a posum to believe it God can raise a dead fish he can raise a dead possum he can do what he wants to you know why because he's God now to reject the simple message God's simple message is to reject it God's simple way is to be destroyed eternally in other words everyone that refuse Jesus is perished to refuse the Simplicity of God is just not something you say well I made a mistake you don't do it that way God don't receive it that way you perish eternally are you hearing me brother says we better be thinking about something now it's got to be properly identified by God then if it is it's his word see oh like they rejected Moses rejected Elijah reject rejected John rejected Jesus of their days can I say this to you can I can I can I give this to you a message properly identified by God becomes the word and to refuse it is death a message properly identified by God becomes the word and to refuse it is death can you give me that first picture you say brother Ander what what are you showing us here amen when a message comes from God and is properly identified that message becomes the word h the the other one and to refuse it is death now to some that's a picture to some that's a man in the water amen baptizing amen somebody on the Ohio River amen but to the Believers come on church to the Believers that's more than just a man in the Ohio River baptizing in the 17th person the prophet of God said on the 17th person he said Out of Heaven amen come a whirlwind and a fire appeared and there was something spoke out of it you know what it said it said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forun the second coming and a prophet of God said this day this scripture is fulfilled in other words God hid himself in the Simplicity of the 17th baptism on the Ohio River in 1933 but then in 1950 the next picture in Sam Houston Coliseum a prophet stands there amen under a debate and Dr best says to Dr Bosworth they're debating arguing and he said now listen he said how many psychic things have you done how many how many tricks have you played how many how many how many people have you hypnotized said

minutes even in the valley well brother Andrew I'm in the Valley but even in the valley there's a Door of Hope God have mercy even in the valley there's a door of hope y'all know what I'm talking about Israel was a winning people God fought their battles God stood with them they went from the Battle of Jericho William they went all the way down to the Battle of AI and the Bible says they whipped the devil at Jericho they went to Ai and they lost the battle Joshua said hold it there's something wrong we're not supposed to lose we are the people of God so he fell down on his face and he be to Crow to God and he said God what's the matter and God revealed to him Simplicity God revealed to him that there was sin in the camp the Bible showed him that the sin in the camp was in the family of achen he had taken a gold wedge and put it in his tent and the Bible says that Joshua went down there in Israel and they took aen and they took his family they took his tent and they killed them slaughtered them amen and they burnt their ashes Amen in the valley and they covered their ashes up with a rock and you know what the Bible called it in the valley of aor in the valley of aor they there they killed aen now here's what they done they went back to the battle and brother Mark when they got back in the battle they were victorious again when the sin was dealt with brother Jackson when the sin was dealt with they went back to the battle and they won now if you leave there and go to Hosea 2 you will read about a woman and the Bible talks about Hosea amen Mary and a harlot and having kids by right and the Bible says it's almost as if it's a story of redemption you know what the Bible says oh God the Bible says amen amen that God could not throw Israel away no matter how much wrong they done no matter how many times they fail hear me young people God could not throw Israel away because they were part of him so what God done in this story was he reveals to Hosea the reason why I cannot throw Israel away is because she's my wife she's a part of me and you know what he says he says now take the that daughter and I will Allure her to the valley of acor and will give her a Door of Hope brother Joe you know what that word aure means it means I will open and what I open will attract her attention in other words in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen the mystery of God should be finished the word should be open and it will become the attraction on the mountain it'll become the attraction in the bride and I will Allure her sir to the valley of acor and there will be a door of hope y'all catch us about 12:00 tomorrow at lunch and scare everybody to death at work I will Allure her to the valley of acor to the door of Hope can I say this if the devil's going to bury us in a valley he better pick the right one out yeah if he's going to bury us in a valley he better pick the right one out because he thought the valley of acor was just a horrible thing because of what happened to a but God turned that and said if I could take Israel and make her deal with her sin then I could raise her back up and put her back on The Winning Side then anybody that gets in the same condition if they make it to the valley of acor there will be a Door of Hope what are you saying preacher I'm closing by saying this this

saying brother Andrew I'm saying the critic is going to criticize the unbeliever is going to unbelieve the doubter is going to doubt the scoffers are going to scoff but the Believers the Believers are simply going to believe can I say this and by the simple people following the simple message they will simply take the [Music] Rapture brother glory to God brother BR said like this he said I'm going to shock you he said but the Rapture will come in such a simple way the judgments will fall they'll see the son of man he said now look the teachers have got it all wrong he said but God will just speak and the Rapture will [Music] come what if I told you tonight the rapture's already in process what if I told you tonight the Rapture door has already been [Music] open y'all know the song brother John my theophan calling me you know that verse one day I'm just going to take [Music] a another step notice it don't say I'm going to open a door I'm just going to take another step because the door is already open can I say this the seventh angel opened the door he he ministered the entrance it's open it's open don't confuse it step in it don't add to it step through it don't live in that depressed condition step into the freedom sir the message of the hour has opened the door I want you to Bow your hearts with this tonight God has hid himself in Simplicity and has revealed himself in the same Church the true word of God is being made manifest they're too smart and too educated brother sister to believe the simple form of the written word they want to put their own interpretation to it it don't mean this it don't mean that see it does mean that listen may I say this right quick now even the visions that God gives here at this place is so misunderstood that's the reason you hear me on the tape say say what the tape say say what the Visions say Hallelujah says where is our faith to believe the simple word of God just what God Said take him in his word god hides himself now in Simplicity in a humble little Bunch but one of these days he'll manifest himself as he always has in the days past I hope and trust he says that this message will produce what is intended to do that it'll get you to a place that you don't look for Flowery things or when you see God in greatness you look how humble it is then you'll see God with they ever head bowed every eye closed here tonight how many could say Lord humble me humble me all over again to this message maybe I've gotten a little bit too carried away in my ideas about how God can't move in this situation and God can't fix this thing and God can't move in this condition but the prophet of God says humble yourself just be humble don't try to be peculiar just love Jesus see and say this Lord if there's any G in my heart if there's anything wrong father I don't want to be like that you take it away I don't want to be like that oh I want to be numbered as one of them in the day Lord and I see that day approaching how many can say Lord draw me tonight draw me back to the Simplicity of the message of the hour [Music] draw me back to where I could stand with the message of the hour and stand with a confession of Faith draw me back lord to where I didn't have to back up on my confession I didn't have to question my confession I could just stand there and simply believe that God still moves how many can say Lord let the energy of the Holy Ghost tonight let it carry the words of this message when I'm sitting at home listening to a tape let the energy of the Holy Ghost carry the words Hallelujah from the voice of the seventh angel into my heart and let a sound of Amen come out let a sound of Freedom come out how many can say Lord when I come to church and I hear the man of God stand behind the pull pit let the spirit of the Holy Ghost the energy of God carry the word of God simply to my heart God bless you God bless you there hands up all over the building I humble myself tonight all over again to the message of the hour I humble myself to the Simplicity of God I humble myself to the pillar of fire I humble myself to the things a prophet taught I humble myself to the supernatural I humble myself to the anointing Hallelujah everything that's in the word from the teaching to the preaching to the gifts of the Spirit to the manifestation of the power of God to the Seven Seals to whatever is in the word I humble myself to it tonight Heavenly Father Lord all across this building tonight Lord the pillar of fire I believe has been moving across hearts and lives now father I'm fir I am a firm believer that wherever the message of the hour is preached it is a Door of Hope Lord it is an entrance that's being ministered father there's one thing we found that a door is an entrance as well as an exit Lord if you go through a door you're exiting one thing and you're entering into something else now Lord as you sent a prophet in this age to take the Book of Revelation to take the things that theologians and Scholars had so stum tumbled over confused and complicated but he comes in 1963 after meeting a consolation of angels and steps behind a pull pit and says now I'm going to lay a foundation of Simplicity for this upcoming meeting week of meetings before he goes to the breach Lord before he goes to one seal he lays a foundation of Simplicity and ministers Hallelujah he ministers a door of entrance into the open of the word by the means of Simplicity by simply believing God taking him at his word and acting upon what he requires now father I pray for every believer here tonight I pray that if there be one here that the devil has tried to come in and convince him because of something that's happened or a situation or whatever it might be Lord that things can't change I pray that this thought tonight will bring back the freshness of the message of the hour to every heart to believe that God is still moving people from the valley back to the mountain tops in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen how many can say the move is on the move is on how we moving brother Andrew by the opening of the word we're moving from confusion to peace from doubt to Faith from complicated to Simplicity how many he says Lord move me move me God bless you tonight friends God bless you where the spirit of the Lord is there is is freedom I am free
