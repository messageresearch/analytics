[35:50] brother Tim and brother Donnie came and
[35:52] especially when they prayed for me I
[35:54] felt a sensation in my eyes and and and
[35:58] uh I just felt something and and so then
[36:00] when we went the first 40 minutes of the
[36:02] doctor's appointment with sister Connie
[36:04] with us and and they told us of what
[36:06] they were going to have to do and then
[36:09] when I saw the the head doctor he looked
[36:12] at me and he said you've got lesions in
[36:13] your eyes but you have no cancer in your
[36:17] eyes and so we thank the Lord we thank
[36:20] the Lord for
[36:26] that isn't he wonderful he cares about
[36:30] every need that you have and I believe
[36:33] that he'll come by this way and amen I

[37:53] God is our refuge and
[37:56] strength a very present help in
[37:59] trouble therefore will not we fear

[38:04] removed and though the mountains be
[38:06] carried in the midst of the sea though
[38:09] the waters thereof Roar and be troubled
[38:12] though the mountain shake and the
[38:14] swelling thereof

[39:04] spear in suer and he burneth a chariot

[39:13] and I will be exalted in the Earth the
[39:15] lord of the host is with us the god of
[39:18] Jacob is our refuge if you will turn
[39:21] with me to Psalms chapter 23 and verse
[39:24] one it's a very familiar portion of of
[39:28] scripture Psalms 23 and verse one I
[39:31] would like for you to read this with me
[39:33] this morning if you
[39:37] will the Lord is my shepherd and I shall
[39:41] not want he maketh me to lie down in
[39:44] Green Pastures and he leadth me beside
[39:46] of the Still Waters he restoreth my soul
[39:50] he leadth me in the paths of
[39:51] righteousness for his name's sake and
[39:54] yay though I walk through the valley of
[39:56] the shadow of death death I will fear no
[39:59] evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[40:02] thy staff they comfort me thou preparest
[40:05] a table before me in the presence of my
[40:07] enemies and thou anointest my head with
[40:10] oil and my cup runneth over surely
[40:13] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[40:16] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[40:19] the house of the Lord
[40:21] forever amen you can be
[40:26] seated
[40:32] sitting beside of you is a thought of
[40:38] God and you also a thought of
[40:41] God you were in thought for him but now
[40:44] you're sitting here in physical
[40:46] reality you're an expression of God's
[40:49] Vision you are important to
[40:53] God as much as God said let there be a
[40:56] son and moon and stars God had you on
[41:00] your on his mind now he held you until
[41:04] this
[41:07] day you could not have been born in any
[41:10] other day God held you to believe this
[41:13] message of the hour and to stand as a
[41:16] light and an overcomer in this
[41:20] dispensation now he did not just create
[41:23] you and maybe you think well brother Ron
[41:26] I don't know if I've ever seen him a
[41:27] miracle when you look in the
[41:32] mirror when you look in the mirror you
[41:36] are a
[41:38] miracle God designed you the way that
[41:40] you are maybe many times you'd like to
[41:44] change some things about you but God
[41:47] designed
[41:50] you he wanted you so
[41:52] tall he wanted your eye color a certain
[41:55] way he wanted your hair to flow a
[41:57] certain way he wanted your personality
[42:00] he wanted your you to be designed after
[42:03] what he was
[42:06] thinking since the fall of Man God has
[42:09] watched over your natural
[42:12] seed not only your spiritual reality but
[42:15] he watched over your natural seed and he
[42:18] watched over it through Wars and
[42:21] pestilence and many different deaths and
[42:23] types of deaths and hatred and Malice
[42:26] and all different kinds of things and
[42:28] God had this one to marry that one and
[42:30] this one to marry that
[42:32] one you know what a challenge that is
[42:36] you listen to the eagle last night that
[42:38] girl Eagle I think it's kind of
[42:44] unfair and they just keep picking up
[42:46] sticks and you keep
[42:50] diving there's going to be some guys in
[42:53] some mud holes here this
[42:56] week
[42:58] and you know how it is if she would just
[43:00] smile at me or you know I think she's
[43:03] the one and you know you fall in love
[43:05] and then all of a sudden she don't want
[43:07] nothing to do with
[43:11] you and you just know you just know and
[43:13] after a while she
[43:15] smiles that has happened all the way in
[43:21] history and then you say you're not a
[43:26] miracle on
[43:28] and I'm sure I'm on the right track
[43:30] there's some of you sitting here you're
[43:31] just hoping that she
[43:35] smiles but in the Lamb's Book of Life he
[43:38] took your
[43:39] picture when you were at your best and
[43:42] many of you are very near that picture
[43:44] right now and death hasn't started to
[43:46] set in yet and you're just in the
[43:48] liberty of life but God didn't just
[43:51] bring you
[43:52] here to see if he could do
[43:56] it
[43:57] God has a purpose in your being here oh
[44:01] brother Ron but I can't wait till the
[44:02] Rapture but you got work to do between
[44:05] now and the
[44:07] Rapture there's some overcoming that
[44:10] you've got to do to prove to Satan that
[44:13] you're here to destroy the works of the
[44:22] devil now God didn't just watch over
[44:25] your seed all the way down through here
[44:27] to bring you to this point to be
[44:32] wishy-washy to be a compromising group
[44:34] of people but you are
[44:40] warriors looking sitting in this room is
[44:43] the most powerful people that there are
[44:44] on the
[44:47] earth when this world is falling apart
[44:50] in Sodom and it's falling apart and
[44:53] people are going every which away they
[44:55] don't have a compass you been sent a
[44:58] message that the seed that is on the
[45:01] inside of you God has confidence in that
[45:05] seed that he deposited not a preacher
[45:09] not your mama not your daddy but God
[45:12] watched over that seat and he's got
[45:15] confidence in the life that he placed on
[45:17] the inside of you you will not
[45:23] fail as much as you think oh brother Ron
[45:26] if I can hold on I don't know if I can
[45:29] make it another day God's not
[45:31] determining this about your flesh or
[45:34] your feelings or your attitudes he's got
[45:37] confidence in the Eternal
[45:40] [Applause]
[45:42] seed that comes to life some of you will
[45:46] get your start
[45:51] here some of you will get your start
[45:53] here maybe as brother Danny was saying
[45:56] and brother Tim was saying last night
[45:58] you may not even want it to
[46:02] come but God designed Gathering
[46:06] you and pulling you to a certain spot
[46:09] because somewhere you're going to start
[46:12] running
[46:13] right somewhere you're going to start
[46:17] don't let the devil block your
[46:19] visitation this
[46:23] week get moving let's get after this
[46:26] thing let's finish the work that God
[46:29] gave us to
[46:31] do now brother Tim brother Danny brother
[46:33] Timothy the ministers are setting all
[46:35] over this building they can't do it for
[46:40] you they can't do your work for you we
[46:44] will cheerlead we will lead you we will
[46:46] try to inspire you we will try to
[46:48] motivate you we will point you to the
[46:50] word to who you are but you've got to
[46:53] catch it for
[46:54] yourself your eyes have got of come
[47:02] open
[47:03] now the reason Satan fights you so
[47:07] much is because you're carrying an
[47:10] atmosphere around you that maybe you're
[47:13] not even aware but there's a light
[47:15] that's with
[47:17] you and Satan being in that real is
[47:20] privy to see that light in all of this
[47:22] darkness and he knows that if you ever
[47:25] get Who You Are
[47:31] if you ever get who you
[47:35] are then you will become Satan's worst
[47:42] nightmare you may be the only one in
[47:44] your school you may be the only one in
[47:46] your company you may be the only one in
[47:48] your
[47:51] family but you are not
[47:55] alone
[47:59] now let's just let's just think about
[48:01] this brother random said it is not the
[48:06] size of the dog that's in the
[48:09] fight it is the size of the fight that's
[48:13] in the
[48:17] dark don't look in the mirror to sit
[48:21] look at that you look in the
[48:25] word brother B quotes this he said must
[48:28] I be carried home to heaven on a flowery
[48:30] bed of East While others fought to win
[48:33] the prize and sail through bloody Seas I
[48:37] must
[48:40] fight now now notice you don't just
[48:42] leave it there
[48:44] increase my courage
[48:48] Lord you got to know where your source
[48:50] of strength
[48:52] is it's not on
[48:55] Facebook
[48:58] when the
[48:59] enemy shall come in like a flood how
[49:02] many's ever felt like you've been in a
[49:04] flood where it looked like the devil was
[49:07] going to overwhelm
[49:09] you but when the enemy shall come in
[49:12] like a flood God don't just leave it
[49:14] there the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[49:19] up a
[49:25] standard God loves a
[49:30] fight want you tell your neighbor God
[49:33] loves a
[49:39] fight Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21

[51:08] you I'm your granddad and I'm your
[51:11] pastor but I don't go to school with you
[51:13] but God is depending on the seed that's
[51:17] in
[51:18] you to overcome in your
[51:23] school to shine a light they will never
[51:27] probably ever read the
[51:28] message may never see the pictures on
[51:31] the wall may never know the name William
[51:34] brandom but they will see that
[51:45] Jesus and the Jesus in you will cause
[51:48] them to be
[51:50] thirsty and they 10 years from now will
[51:53] remember I knew a guy in school
[51:57] that regardless of all the darkness and
[51:59] the bullying and all the nonsense that
[52:01] was going on and all of Sodom and
[52:04] gamorra and all the politics I knew a
[52:07] [Applause]

[52:12] of them your
[52:14] life Your
[52:17] Atmosphere Your Atmosphere will bring
[52:20] them back in the
[52:24] compass are you with me
[52:27] that's how important our work is to do
[52:30] you may not influence them today you may
[52:33] not see it but maybe years from now
[52:36] they'll look
[52:37] back I saw the life of Jesus on the
[52:40] inside regardless of the circumstances
[52:44] regardless of what was going I saw
[52:54] Jesus two r
[53:00] Spencer that
[53:02] overcometh which means you're going to
[53:04] wrestle with it you're going to fight
[53:06] with it but you're going to
[53:09] win will I grant to sit with me and my
[53:15] throne even as I also overcame and have
[53:19] sat down with my

[54:49] and fell though a host should encamp
[54:51] against me my heart shall not fear
[54:54] though War should rise against me and
[54:56] this will I be confident one thing that
[54:58] I have desired of the Lord that will I
[55:01] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[55:04] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[55:06] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[55:08] inquire in his Temple for in the time of
[55:11] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[55:14] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[55:16] hide me and he shall set me upon a
[55:19] rock and now shall my head be lifted up

[1:02:44] down his
[1:02:45] neck and he just knew at any minute his
[1:02:49] neck was going to be snapped and he was
[1:02:51] going to be bit he ran under the couch
[1:02:54] and he ran across the floor and he ran
[1:02:57] over the tables and there was an open

[1:11:32] the Lord last year two years ago or
[1:11:34] three years ago that chapter now has
[1:11:41] turned these two boys that drove 32
[1:11:43] hours they're friends of
[1:11:45] ours they've had difficult
[1:11:48] lives life hasn't been exactly a just a
[1:11:51] flowery bed of
[1:11:53] these but it sure wasn't the devil that
[1:11:55] caused them to get in their
[1:11:58] car and come through snowy storms cars
[1:12:01] slide in every different
[1:12:03] direction there was something at this
[1:12:07] camp and they came with
[1:12:10] expectation am I right they came with
[1:12:13] expectation that I'm going to be
[1:12:15] stronger when I leave
[1:12:21] here brother Ron you're not preaching
[1:12:23] nothing to me new listen
[1:12:26] you fought last week to get
[1:12:28] here and you'll fight to go home but you
[1:12:31] can be stronger come
[1:12:43] on General Robert E Lee maybe's familiar
[1:12:47] to especially in the
[1:12:49] South but he made a scream one day and
[1:12:51] he said I'm too weak to retreat
[1:12:58] so we will just
[1:13:02] charge you may be too
[1:13:05] weak to even Retreat so I got some
[1:13:09] advice for you
[1:13:21] judge I have to tell you I could live
[1:13:24] this by experience
[1:13:26] there are days that I'm too sick to walk
[1:13:28] to a pull pit but I refuse to let that
[1:13:32] devil there are I'm too sick to get out
[1:13:35] of bed but I refuse to let that
[1:13:42] devil I could have quit and laid home
[1:13:44] and had all kind of different
[1:13:46] excuses but I refuse to
[1:13:51] retreat so if I can fight with stage
[1:13:54] four cancer

[1:15:20] [Music]
[1:15:21] [Applause]
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:25] messing on what do I have to
[1:15:39] do I want to tell you your origin ye are
[1:15:42] of God little children and have overcame
[1:15:46] them because greater is he that is in
[1:15:48] you
[1:15:49] hallah than he that is in the world
[1:15:53] Hallelujah brother Ron I don't have
[1:15:54] strength
[1:15:55] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[1:15:58] to think anything of ourselves but our
[1:16:04] sufficiency is of
[1:16:07] God hallelu and he saith unto me my
[1:16:10] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[1:16:13] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:16:15] most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:16:17] glory in the infirmities that the power
[1:16:19] of Christ May rest upon
[1:16:22] me Isaiah 40 and verse 29 he giveth
[1:16:26] power to the
[1:16:29] faint and to them that have no might he
[1:16:32] increases strength even the youth shall
[1:16:34] faint and be weary and the young men
[1:16:36] shall elderly fall but they that wait
[1:16:40] upon the
[1:16:44] Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:16:46] shall Mount upon wings as an eagle they
[1:16:49] shall run and not be weary they shall
[1:16:53] walk and not faint
[1:16:56] Give the Lord a great big hand right
[1:17:08] there Romans chapter 8 and 28 these are
[1:17:11] some of my favorite
[1:17:16] scriptures and we know that all
[1:17:20] things work together to the good to them
[1:17:22] that love God that's right
[1:17:26] to them who are they
[1:17:28] called according to his
[1:17:30] purpose God knows what he deposited on
[1:17:33] the inside of
[1:17:36] you he did not do it by
[1:17:41] random he knowed what he put on the
[1:17:44] inside of you if you can get the
[1:17:46] revelation of what's laying on the
[1:17:48] inside of
[1:17:49] you that seed has power within itself to
[1:17:53] produce what God's word call for it to
[1:17:56] do for whom he did for
[1:18:00] no turn to your neighbor now he's
[1:18:02] talking about you
[1:18:06] now you're a Qui
[1:18:09] Bunch he's talking about you
[1:18:23] now how many of you have ever been in a
[1:18:25] group
[1:18:31] picture 40 people in that
[1:18:35] picture when they showed you the picture
[1:18:37] who did you look
[1:18:40] at well you're a bunch of Bain
[1:18:49] people 40 people and you looked at
[1:18:52] yourself you didn't look at your best
[1:18:56] friend my hair wasn't right can we
[1:18:58] retake that picture I didn't smile I had
[1:19:01] an eye
[1:19:03] closed can we retake the picture so now
[1:19:07] we look at the work we're not looking at
[1:19:08] Noah Moses
[1:19:14] Jeremiah Moses is not sitting here
[1:19:17] Jeremiah is not sitting here brother
[1:19:19] brandom is not sitting here your
[1:19:22] favorite preacher may not be sitting
[1:19:23] here it's your
[1:19:27] turn it's your
[1:19:31] turn remember some of you now at a point
[1:19:33] and the teacher ask you what do you want
[1:19:35] to be when you grow
[1:19:37] up I want to be an
[1:19:49] overcomer now more over whom he did
[1:19:51] predestinate them he also
[1:19:53] called who did that
[1:19:55] God
[1:19:56] did and God don't
[1:19:59] lose whom he called he then he also
[1:20:06] Justified so if you properly ask
[1:20:10] forgiveness and the old man
[1:20:15] dies it's
[1:20:21] gone it's gone habits you've had things
[1:20:25] you've thought about words that you've
[1:20:27] said attitudes that you've had and you
[1:20:29] say God forgive me I don't want to be
[1:20:32] that man no
[1:20:35] longer and you properly ask forgiveness
[1:20:38] of those things and then God washes you
[1:20:42] and justifies you it's as though
[1:20:50] you never did it in the first place
[1:21:05] some of you were rotten dirty stinking
[1:21:09] Rascals but you see we didn't put forth
[1:21:12] a a history report to see if it was okay
[1:21:15] if you
[1:21:20] come and the devil for sure didn't want
[1:21:22] you to be in here but God got you
[1:21:27] here Pastor Jesus has people in his
[1:21:33] congregation one was naked on a boat
[1:21:36] cursing and the devil had to laugh
[1:21:40] picking
[1:21:43] him picking
[1:21:45] him he'll be my lead disciple you
[1:21:48] picking
[1:21:51] him and some of your parents has got
[1:21:54] filth
[1:21:56] records that they don't tell you nothing
[1:21:58] about but God picked
[1:22:03] them God picked them because God could
[1:22:07] see the potential that laid on the
[1:22:09] inside of
[1:22:11] it and God's a cheater he already
[1:22:15] knows he's not dampling he's not what if
[1:22:20] he know what he put on the inside of
[1:22:23] you
[1:22:33] and the devil goes you'll never be
[1:22:34] nothing you're right for the devil will
[1:22:36] never be nothing for
[1:22:38] him I do not intend on advancing Satan's
[1:22:41] kingdom I intend on destroying
[1:22:53] it I love this scripture verse 31 what
[1:22:57] shall we then say to these
[1:23:00] things if God be for
[1:23:05] us I like my odds
[1:23:09] here I like my odds
[1:23:12] here if God be for
[1:23:18] us who can be against
[1:23:22] us listen I live this this I live this
[1:23:26] doctors think I'm going to die but
[1:23:28] they're thrilled I'm living because they
[1:23:31] think it's the medicine's
[1:23:33] working it doesn't matter what their
[1:23:36] report
[1:23:37] says it doesn't matter how big the
[1:23:40] cancer
[1:23:41] is it doesn't matter how much your
[1:23:44] darkness that you're in if
[1:23:53] God
[1:23:56] come on help me
[1:24:00] preach if God be for me if my parents
[1:24:04] aren't for me if my pastor's not for me
[1:24:07] and he's going to give up if God is on
[1:24:10] my
[1:24:13] side if God is on my
[1:24:21] side David could say it my brothers have
[1:24:24] turned against me the King has turned
[1:24:26] against me but if God's with me I'm
[1:24:29] going to pick up five

[1:25:16] of your own
[1:25:18] home it's in the privacy of your own
[1:25:21] mind but greater is he that is in you

[1:25:54] not
[1:25:57] wimps we are
[1:25:59] warriors and we are armed for the
[1:26:03] battle and God just didn't give us armor
[1:26:06] to see how we would wear
[1:26:08] it we're here to
[1:26:11] win we have recognized that we're in a
[1:26:17] battle we know we've got a
[1:26:23] fight I'm going to raise the banner High
[1:26:27] we are going to
[1:26:29] [Applause]
[1:26:45] win now God has had a strategy he

[1:27:06] vessels wish you had
[1:27:09] one he empties human
[1:27:13] vessels make sure they're
[1:27:20] empty don't tell the
[1:27:23] jity
[1:27:24] and he empties them completely
[1:27:26] out of all of the sin all the habits all
[1:27:32] the
[1:27:33] nonsense all the
[1:27:35] stuff now it looks like the same
[1:27:41] vessel it looks like the same
[1:27:46] vessel it looks like the same vessel but
[1:27:49] a new king is living on the
[1:27:53] inside thank
[1:27:57] you I can preach a little while long
[1:28:03] now so the devil used to fight you when

[1:28:07] there oh he could have a
[1:28:12] party cuz you would listening to his
[1:28:15] music you was reading his
[1:28:18] junk because the old man was living in
[1:28:20] there now it looks like the same vessel
[1:28:24] but once the new man the new king lives
[1:28:27] in the
[1:28:28] heart and he comes back to pick on you
[1:28:33] War has

[1:29:48] match well put him in the ropes and
[1:29:50] knock him around and take a breath out
[1:29:52] of him hit his jaw and break his
[1:29:57] jaw brother Andrew when he would go over
[1:30:00] and sat down in the
[1:30:02] corner Angelo
[1:30:04] dunde would remind him of who he
[1:30:09] is and when people would ask Angelo
[1:30:12] Dundee what was the secret what did you
[1:30:14] tell him that he would come back and win
[1:30:16] the championship
[1:30:20] again he said all I
[1:30:22] did was reminding him of who he
[1:30:35] was because he already knew how to
[1:30:39] fight he had trained for the moment he
[1:30:42] knew what to do how to throw the left
[1:30:44] and how to throw the jab and how to come
[1:30:46] around with the roundhouse how to keep
[1:30:48] his head out of the way how to take the
[1:30:50] blow into his belly but he needed to be
[1:30:53] reminded
[1:30:58] you are the
[1:31:02] champion Muhammad nobody else can come
[1:31:04] in here and do it for you I can't do it

[1:40:12] somewhere brother the brown said that in

[1:40:26] sweat you wet the
[1:40:30] bed you'll remember that statement more

[1:41:05] things you you sweated not going there
[1:41:08] again you throwed the covers off of the
[1:41:12] bed you was mad at your wife when you
[1:41:14] got
[1:41:15] up it was emotional it takes you a
[1:41:18] couple of hours to get over
[1:41:20] it but thank God you were woke
[1:41:43] up now want you just
[1:41:45] think Satan's in a
[1:41:51] nightmare since Calvary
[1:41:54] yeah he doesn't even have the keys to
[1:41:56] his own
[1:41:57] house he's no longer the ruler of
[1:42:06] death and he's tried for 2,000 years to
[1:42:09] wake
[1:42:12] up now in this nightmare you have come
[1:42:18] along now he loves Darkness but you're
[1:42:21] light now in the the
[1:42:24] light you shine upon the Cockroaches of
[1:42:27] the
[1:42:28] devil and you expose
[1:42:31] him that's why people maybe many times
[1:42:35] don't like you but they don't really
[1:42:38] know you said I'm going to have a child
[1:42:41] and the devil said oh you'll never do
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:48] that and what a nightmare it is for the
[1:42:51] devil to watch you you don't
[1:42:54] quit because there's something on the
[1:42:57] inside of you that just keeps
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:00] going aren't you
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:05] thrilled aren't you
[1:43:08] thrilled to be the devil's worst
[1:43:22] nightmare
[1:43:37] God built the devil he built it to be
[1:43:40] his Archen enemy to always believe that
[1:43:43] he was going to win knowing he
[1:43:48] wouldn't and God built
[1:43:52] you
[1:43:54] to be lights that would never go
[1:43:57] out that in every dream and every day
[1:44:00] and every
[1:44:01] second there you
[1:44:04] are and you thought before you walked in
[1:44:07] this service that you was
[1:44:10] nobody but you are a beacon of
[1:44:13] light you're a beacon of
[1:44:17] light and you are our Archen
[1:44:22] enemies
[1:44:24] [Music]
[1:44:27] worst
[1:44:30] nightmare and if we can say it right he
[1:44:33] can't wake

[1:46:45] you I want you to hear these
[1:46:48] words many times we get rocks in our
[1:46:51] pocket and we we throw them at each
[1:46:57] other but those rocks were intended for
[1:47:01] the
[1:47:03] devil but he'll confuse you to throw him
[1:47:07] at a
[1:47:08] buddy or throw him at another believer
[1:47:11] or throw him at a preacher we're all
[1:47:14] been
[1:47:15] guilty but why don't you wake up this
[1:47:18] morning and said
[1:47:20] devil the rocks that God gave me from my

[1:47:28] enemy they're going to kill some
[1:47:33] enemy are you with me how many caught
[1:47:36] that the rocks and the criticism is not
[1:47:39] for my brother and my
[1:47:41] sister it's not to make fun of nobody
[1:47:44] it's not to put pressure on somebody
[1:47:46] else but with Jesus
[1:47:48] help in my book like shamgar
[1:47:53] and my book like

[1:50:19] realize who we really
