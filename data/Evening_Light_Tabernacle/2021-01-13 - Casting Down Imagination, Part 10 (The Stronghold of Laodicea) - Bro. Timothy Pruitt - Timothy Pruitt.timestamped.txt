[30:58] lord we just tune out all the things of

[31:30] god in every every part lord we need you
[31:34] lord we're living in a world that says
[31:36] they have need of
[31:37] no need of you they they don't even want
[31:39] to acknowledge your existence
[31:42] but lord we need you and we long to be
[31:45] in your presence
[31:46] father and long to be lord where you're
[31:48] at father and
[31:50] leave this whole world behind what a day
[31:53] that'll be
[31:54] father we just commit this service to
[31:56] your hands
[31:57] everything that be said and done would
[31:59] be lord for your
[32:01] will and your glory and your honor
[32:04] we ask father you just anoint us we pray
[32:07] in jesus name
[32:09] amen amen
[32:12] let's turn to second corinthians 10.
[32:18] amen
[32:21] verse 4 says for the weapons of our
[32:24] warfare are not carnal
[32:27] but mighty through god to the pulling
[32:30] down
[32:31] of strongholds casting down imaginations
[32:36] and every high thing that exalted itself
[32:39] against the knowledge of god
[32:42] and bringing into captivity every
[32:44] thought
[32:45] to the obedience of christ
[32:48] sounds quite opposite of the world that
[32:52] we're living in
[32:54] amen but this is what the scripture
[32:56] tells us to do here is we read it
[32:58] i also want to read in uh revelations
[33:01] believers chapter 3 and
[33:03] it says unto the angel of the uh of the
[33:05] church of laodicea wright
[33:07] for these things saith a the amen the
[33:10] faithful and true witness
[33:12] the beginning of the creation of god i
[33:15] know that works
[33:16] that thou are neither cold nor hot i
[33:19] would thou were cold or hot
[33:21] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[33:23] neither cold nor hot
[33:25] i will spew thee out of my mouth because
[33:28] thou
[33:28] sayest i am rich and increase with goods
[33:31] and have need of nothing
[33:33] and know us not that thou art wretched
[33:35] miserable
[33:36] poor blind and naked now could you
[33:39] imagine
[33:40] or the imaginations of someone who would
[33:43] make the statement that i'm
[33:45] rich increase with goods and have need
[33:47] of nothing
[33:48] yet god would come back and say thou
[33:51] thou knowest not that thou
[33:52] art and know it not that thou art
[33:54] wretched and miserable
[33:56] and poor and blind and naked that's
[33:59] quite a
[33:59] problem if you have that kind of problem
[34:01] in your mind
[34:03] amen to where you don't know the
[34:04] condition that you're truly in
[34:06] he said i counseled thee to buy me gold
[34:09] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[34:10] rich
[34:11] and white raiment and thou mayest be
[34:13] clothed
[34:15] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[34:17] not appear and anoint thine eyes with i
[34:19] salve
[34:20] that thou mayest see as many as i love i
[34:23] rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
[34:25] and repent
[34:26] behold i stand at the door and knock
[34:30] if any man hear my voice and open the
[34:32] door i will come
[34:33] into him and will sup with him and he
[34:36] with me
[34:37] and to him that overcometh will i grant
[34:39] to sit with me in my throne
[34:41] even as i also overcame and have set
[34:44] down
[34:45] in my father's and with my father in his
[34:47] throne
[34:48] he that hath and hear let him hear what
[34:51] the spirit
[34:52] saith unto the churches amen we'll let
[34:55] you be seated
[35:02] as we read here in this scripture as we
[35:06] know is speaking directly to the time
[35:08] that we're living in
[35:10] and and the age that we're living in the
[35:13] situations that we're
[35:14] seeing even unfold very quickly before
[35:17] our eyes
[35:19] and we're seeing a world very quickly
[35:21] turn very much
[35:22] towards complete darkness until our
[35:25] minds are
[35:26] our minds of men are on evil continually
[35:29] and their minds are being taken over by
[35:32] uh you know they can think well i just
[35:33] think this way or just my own thoughts
[35:35] but
[35:36] we know thoughts are are activated or
[35:38] are operated by
[35:39] spirit and we see spirits that have been
[35:42] uh being brought to the forefront
[35:44] and bodies of women men and women today
[35:47] that we're we're seeing around us
[35:49] and you know it's an age of apparently
[35:52] an age of imaginations
[35:54] to where people can be caught up in
[35:56] imaginations to where they think they're
[35:58] rich
[35:59] and increase with goods and have need of
[36:01] nothing but
[36:02] really they're wretched miserable poor
[36:05] blind and naked
[36:06] now they may have money that this world
[36:09] gives but they don't have the things
[36:10] that god
[36:12] godly values they may have things of
[36:15] houses and lands but
[36:17] amen what about eternal values
[36:20] amen you know somebody was saying the
[36:22] other day you know people wants to be a
[36:24] millionaire you know and it's not that
[36:26] shouldn't
[36:26] that's not our goal and that's not our
[36:28] our destination really to be
[36:30] a man of mighty wealth here upon this
[36:32] earth but i want to be rich in the
[36:34] goodness of god
[36:36] amen i want to be an eternal heir
[36:39] amen an eternal heir amen he said you
[36:42] know in their imaginations or in their
[36:43] thinking they're
[36:44] rich and creatures of goods and have
[36:46] need of nothing from
[36:48] god and the scripture was to go on to
[36:50] say in another place that they have
[36:52] become
[36:52] vain in their imaginations and we're
[36:56] living in an age that's going into
[36:58] complete
[36:59] and total darkness into complete and
[37:01] total chaos
[37:03] there is a total rejection of christ all
[37:06] over again
[37:07] as they rejected him there in the body
[37:09] of jesus christ they're rejecting him
[37:11] again
[37:12] amen and crucified him again the word
[37:14] that has been sent
[37:15] in this age in this hour that we're
[37:16] living in until we see them
[37:18] completely reject him from their lives
[37:21] completely reject him from schools from
[37:24] jobs and from government and we see leo
[37:27] laodicea
[37:28] has been set up in the atmosphere to be
[37:31] satan's eden
[37:32] or satan's stronghold and we see here
[37:35] and that's what i want to minister on
[37:37] this evening as we would look into this
[37:39] is casting down in that imaginations
[37:42] amen laodicea the stronghold of laodicea
[37:46] and we are living in a stronghold as a
[37:48] strong age
[37:50] it's a strong time and it's got very
[37:52] many
[37:53] many ways of of coming coming at you as
[37:56] a
[37:56] as it would try and we we've seen very
[37:58] quickly how men
[38:00] in this age have given up their their
[38:02] their godliness and their holiness
[38:04] and their and their thinking has been
[38:07] being completely flipped over
[38:09] to the other side and we see very
[38:11] quickly
[38:12] amen how the god of this age as we know
[38:14] would be satan he has set up his
[38:16] rulership
[38:17] and his domain and this age will end up
[38:20] going into complete destruction
[38:22] so therefore there's no hope in this
[38:24] time that we're living in
[38:25] and we see it very quickly ending very
[38:28] quickly right here in front of us
[38:31] and we know he has set it up to be his
[38:33] eid and or his stronghold
[38:35] you know brother branham would speak and
[38:36] it's a very good sermon to go listen to
[38:38] the god of this evil age
[38:40] he would he would start out and he said
[38:42] the bible has the answer for every age
[38:46] it's already written in the bible for
[38:48] the believer of that age
[38:50] i believe that everything we have need
[38:51] of is written right here
[38:53] it don't need to be interpreted it just
[38:56] needs to be interpreted by the holy
[38:58] spirit
[38:58] he said i don't believe that any man on
[39:00] earth has a right to put his own
[39:02] interpretation to the word
[39:04] god doesn't need anybody to interpret
[39:06] his word he's his own interpreter
[39:08] how does he interpret it by bringing it
[39:10] to pass
[39:12] amen he said i've said many times he
[39:13] said a virgin shall conceive
[39:15] he spoke it through the lips of the
[39:17] prophet and she did no one had to
[39:19] interpret that
[39:20] in the beginning he said let there be
[39:22] light and there was no one had to
[39:24] interpret that
[39:25] and he said in the last days he will
[39:27] pour out his spirit upon flesh
[39:29] and he did it don't need any type of
[39:32] interpretation
[39:33] but he said notice how we closely as we
[39:35] study the word
[39:36] the god of this evil age that we're now
[39:38] living in
[39:39] he said it may seem strange a very
[39:41] strange thing
[39:43] that in this age this evil age it's also
[39:45] an age of grace
[39:48] hallelujah he said because in the middle
[39:50] of this chaos
[39:52] in the middle of all these things are
[39:54] going on god
[39:55] is taking a people for his name's sake
[39:58] and that is the bride in this evil age
[40:00] that can be called the most evil age
[40:02] there's ever been
[40:04] in this very age god is calling out a
[40:06] people
[40:07] for his name's sake by grace and calling
[40:10] them out of this evil time
[40:12] now we prove that by the bible that this
[40:14] is the age that he's speaking of very
[40:16] strange
[40:17] to think that in this time god is
[40:20] calling out a people
[40:22] amen you notice he said a people not a
[40:24] church it's called
[40:25] it's called the church but he would call
[40:27] a people he said a church is a gathering
[40:30] of many people of different makeups
[40:32] but god is calling one he said he didn't
[40:35] say i'll call the methodist or the
[40:37] baptists or the pentecostals
[40:38] he will call a people a bride for his
[40:42] namesake
[40:43] right in the middle of this dark age and
[40:46] when this bride leaves she'll go into
[40:47] dark complete darkness amen
[40:50] he said but we're seeing a people for
[40:52] his name that receives his name
[40:54] engaged in his name going to a waiting
[40:57] to be married to him
[40:58] to become part of him by a
[41:00] predestination just as a man that
[41:02] chooses a right wi
[41:04] the right wife in his life ordained to
[41:06] be part of his body so the bride of
[41:08] christ will be
[41:09] now and from old ordained by god to be
[41:12] part of that body
[41:13] he said notice not what someone has said
[41:15] or what someone called
[41:17] but what god chose before the foundation
[41:20] of the world
[41:21] me and you a people for his name's sake
[41:24] in the middle of this age in this evil
[41:27] age right in the middle of it he said
[41:29] it's the most deceiving
[41:30] age of all ages it's got the most
[41:34] deception
[41:35] of all ages all the ages of deceit from
[41:38] the garden of eden all the way down
[41:40] never has there ever been an age so
[41:43] deceptive
[41:44] as this age that we're living in to
[41:46] where it was it would say false prophets
[41:48] will rise
[41:49] and show signs and wonders if possible
[41:52] they would deceive the very leg
[41:54] but now just a cold now we see now in
[41:57] this age just cold
[41:58] formal starchy churches and so forth a
[42:01] man's theology
[42:02] he said but the elect won't pay no
[42:04] attention to that
[42:05] they're just going to keep going on with
[42:07] the word with the promise of the word
[42:10] and they're going to keep living the
[42:11] word for their hour
[42:13] right here in the middle of this dark
[42:15] age but we see
[42:16] satan is setting up his kingdom we find
[42:20] why why is god doing this why has god
[42:22] allowed
[42:23] all the things that are taking place and
[42:24] all the chaos and
[42:26] all the all the problems in the world
[42:28] and the situations
[42:29] and the sicknesses and the plagues and
[42:31] satan having seemingly having his way
[42:34] time after time after time he said what
[42:36] god is doing
[42:38] he's bringing a people here so she can
[42:40] be
[42:41] made manifest so she can be tried
[42:44] be proved and prove to satan that she
[42:47] won't fall
[42:48] like the first eve did hallelujah
[42:52] so he's allowed it to become where it is
[42:54] today
[42:55] laodicea a stronghold satan's
[42:58] eden amen an evil age to prove to satan
[43:01] this bride
[43:02] is not like eve amen eve fell in god's
[43:06] eating but this bridal stand and satan's
[43:08] eating
[43:09] amen this bride will stand no matter how
[43:12] bad the situation gets
[43:15] but we see laodicea and we see it it's
[43:18] amazing as you would
[43:19] which do a study of the you know as
[43:22] reading revelations it was cities there
[43:25] in the area
[43:27] of the greek and and this particular one
[43:30] named
[43:31] laodicea which means people's rights
[43:35] more it's very very fitting for the age
[43:38] that we live in
[43:40] people's rights you know they had they
[43:43] had a lot of
[43:45] very it was very flourishing city a lot
[43:48] of money a lot of wealth
[43:50] uh you know very financially seemingly
[43:52] stable
[43:54] much property and you know great medical
[43:57] schools and
[43:59] and and been this you know they were
[44:01] distinguished in the hearts and the
[44:03] sciences
[44:04] and you know they their worship to god
[44:06] whose name was zeus
[44:09] you know how fitting were the
[44:10] characteristics of this city
[44:12] to represent the age that we now live in
[44:16] but as we go on to this don't forget god
[44:19] has called a people out of this
[44:22] amen that's not going to go into
[44:24] destruction but she's going to go in a
[44:26] rapture
[44:28] amen and but see they said they worship
[44:31] one god zeus who was the chief and the
[44:33] father of gods and
[44:35] this forecast into the 20th century one
[44:38] god the fathers of us all
[44:40] and and to have a religious premise that
[44:42] sets forth
[44:43] the brotherhood of men even now bringing
[44:46] together protestants and catholics and
[44:48] jews and hindus
[44:49] with the intent that a mutual form of
[44:52] worship
[44:52] will increase our love we'll increase
[44:55] our understanding
[44:56] we'll increase our care for each other
[44:59] see how slick that devil is
[45:01] amen let's just bring it all together no
[45:03] one's right no one's wrong
[45:05] we're all serving one god we're we're
[45:08] all
[45:08] we all read the bible we all believe the
[45:10] bible but
[45:11] in their hearts they really don't
[45:14] believe what the word said
[45:16] amen in their hearts is far from him
[45:18] amen amen but they want to say
[45:20] they want to put this out that you know
[45:21] all of us were you know i just saw an
[45:23] article the other day we need an
[45:25] all-inclusive religion
[45:28] and we see it being set up that that
[45:30] we're the world that we're living in is
[45:32] all-inclusive everybody's right
[45:35] there's no wrong there's there and you
[45:37] go down that highway you're going down
[45:39] to
[45:40] a wreck somewhere amen because
[45:43] there is good there is evil there is
[45:45] right there is wrong
[45:48] amen amen but they want us to get in our
[45:50] ideas and our imagination there's
[45:52] nothing wrong and there's nothing right
[45:55] everything's right and nothing's wrong
[45:59] confusion and we're seeing a world
[46:01] that's being brought right into this
[46:03] confusion
[46:07] and to where you know or it says
[46:09] organizations with world leaders
[46:11] refuse to recognize any one individual
[46:14] concept
[46:15] of spiritual worship but recommend
[46:18] putting aside all the separate concepts
[46:22] with hopes that all religions become
[46:24] leveled into one
[46:25] for all desire the same goals all have
[46:28] the same purposes
[46:30] and all are basically right it's a lie
[46:33] of the devil
[46:37] amen the laodicea people's rights
[46:41] you know everybody wants their rights
[46:44] they want their rights to live without a
[46:46] god
[46:47] they want the rights to live as as how
[46:50] they want to live and
[46:51] do as they want to do and and and act
[46:54] how they want to act we we got to have
[46:56] our rights and how dare anybody
[46:59] raise up and say the word of god says
[47:01] this and the word of god says that
[47:03] we have our rights amen and they won't
[47:07] if we see their
[47:08] nations rising up and demanding equality
[47:12] socially and financially this is the age
[47:15] of the communists where all men
[47:16] are supposedly equal
[47:20] though it's not so in theory this is the
[47:22] age of political parties that calls
[47:24] themselves christian democrats
[47:26] christian socialists i don't even know
[47:28] if there's christian republicans anymore
[47:31] christian commonwealth federation
[47:33] according to our liberal theologians
[47:36] they want to say jesus was even a
[47:37] socialist and an early church on the
[47:40] guidance of spirits practice socialism
[47:42] and thus we also do so today
[47:45] do you see where the world is going
[47:48] one world one government one head satan
[47:53] the god of this evil age
[47:59] you know it's pretty crazy world you're
[48:01] living in when the roman catholic
[48:03] becomes the voice of the conservative
[48:10] it's unbelievable
[48:14] the harlot the becomes the voice
[48:18] of the conservative
[48:21] murdering babies
[48:24] and you know you you read about the
[48:26] history of rome you see what
[48:27] who they really are and what's really
[48:29] behind them it's
[48:31] it's not too hard to look into but
[48:32] people are being brought right into it
[48:34] how by capturing their minds
[48:45] you know
[48:50] he says he says when the ancients called
[48:52] laodicea the metropolis
[48:54] it was looking forward to a one world
[48:56] government
[48:57] that we are now setting up this is in
[49:00] the laodicean church age book
[49:02] as we think of that city being the
[49:04] location of a great church council
[49:06] we see foreshadowed the ecumenical move
[49:09] taking place today
[49:10] we're in very soon we'll see all the
[49:12] so-called christians
[49:14] come together indeed this church and the
[49:16] state
[49:17] religion and politics are coming
[49:18] together the tares are being bound
[49:23] well if the tares are being bound the
[49:25] wheat is also being brought together
[49:28] amen it was a city of earthquake such
[49:31] earthquake
[49:32] that it was finally destroyed by it this
[49:34] is the age will end in god
[49:37] shaking the whole world that has gone
[49:39] off to make love with the old the
[49:41] harlot
[49:41] not only will the world systems crumble
[49:44] but every
[49:45] the very earth will be shaken and that
[49:47] to such a point
[49:48] that it will be renovated again for a
[49:50] millennial reign of christ
[49:53] hallelujah but the city was rich
[49:57] endowed with wealth full of culture
[50:01] science abound so much like today
[50:05] you know rich you know churches you know
[50:08] rich
[50:08] worship in beautiful formal and formal
[50:11] formalities but cold
[50:13] and dead cultures and education has
[50:16] taken the place
[50:17] of spirit given word and faith has been
[50:20] superseded by science
[50:22] so that man is a victim of materialism
[50:26] amen in every attribute ancient laodicea
[50:29] is found
[50:30] reborn in the 20th century's laodicean
[50:32] age
[50:33] it is the only the mercy of god that may
[50:36] those who have an ear to hear come
[50:38] out of her and not be partakers of her
[50:41] sins
[50:41] and the consequent judgment
[50:47] and here laodicea
[50:52] here's a message to laodicea in
[50:54] revelations 3
[50:55] verse 15 it says i know thou works
[50:59] that thou are neither cold nor hot i
[51:02] would that work cold or hot
[51:04] so then because i want lukewarm and
[51:06] neither cold nor hot
[51:08] i will spew thee out of my mouth because
[51:11] thou
[51:11] sayeth something rich thou says isn't
[51:14] god saying
[51:15] they're saying this i'm rich increase
[51:18] with goods and have need of nothing
[51:20] no it's not that thou art wretched and
[51:22] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[51:24] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[51:26] in the fire that thou mayest be rich
[51:29] and the white raiment that thou mayest
[51:30] be clothed that the shame of thy
[51:32] nakedness do not appear
[51:34] and anoint thine eyes with eyes out that
[51:36] thou mayest see
[51:39] he said i would that thou were cold or
[51:41] hot
[51:42] but because our lukewarm i'm going to
[51:45] spew you out of my mouth
[51:48] listen right here i'm going to tell you
[51:49] there's something i'm a lot more afraid
[51:51] of
[51:51] than the coveted that's the lukewarm flu
[51:54] that's going around
[51:57] it's a stronghold that's trying to take
[51:59] over people's lives
[52:01] amen the devil used covet to bring
[52:03] lukewarmness right into people's lives
[52:08] i've talked to ministers and pastors all
[52:10] over and they say we've not seen people
[52:12] a lot of people since coveted why
[52:14] it wasn't covered they kept them out the
[52:16] truth be known it was the lukewarmness
[52:18] of laodicea the stronghold of satan
[52:23] that's trying to come take over people's
[52:30] minds
[52:34] lukewarmness demands a penalty from god
[52:40] so therefore i don't want to be lukewarm
[52:43] i said god keep me from that let me let
[52:46] me have
[52:46] the inoculation you know people are so
[52:50] happy about this vaccine for the coven
[52:52] amen it's a man-made vaccine it does
[52:55] good and it's going to do evil
[52:58] it's off the tree of good and of good
[52:59] and neat knowledge of good and evil it
[53:01] can't help it
[53:01] it can only do what it's been made to do
[53:04] as i ever other vaccines there's a lot
[53:06] of good in them but there was also a lot
[53:07] of bad
[53:08] this is not going to be no different
[53:11] amen but i i'm here to tell you there's
[53:13] another vaccine
[53:17] this vaccine to protect you in the time
[53:19] of storms
[53:20] it'll protect you when all the world is
[53:22] going insane
[53:23] amen it ain't a man-made vaccine that
[53:26] has been built in less than a year
[53:28] it's a vaccine that's been proven over
[53:30] thousands of years
[53:32] and has not lost a case
[53:37] but people want to refuse it we'll get
[53:40] into that later and then they
[53:42] allow lukewarmness to come in
[53:47] as he would say pretty soon people start
[53:49] doing things they used to wouldn't do
[53:52] and they stopped doing things they used
[53:54] to do prayers out
[53:59] satan has designed this age that we're
[54:01] living in to take every bit of time you
[54:03] got
[54:05] and he's trying to destroy you and try
[54:07] to bring you down with the rest of the
[54:09] world and
[54:10] and and trying to bring luke warmness
[54:12] upon people to the point
[54:13] amen you can't hardly pipe them you
[54:15] can't hardly pump an amen out of them
[54:17] anymore
[54:18] if you can even get them to come to
[54:19] church and what is it this lukewarmness
[54:23] let's just get to the bones of it you
[54:25] say it was my it's my personality no
[54:27] it's lukewarmness
[54:29] because a seed of god cannot help but
[54:31] respond to the word of god
[54:34] it may not be a shout and dance up in
[54:35] the aisle but something on the inside of
[54:38] you being so lit up
[54:39] by the word of god that you can't help
[54:41] but hold
[54:42] and you can't hold it back it's there
[54:45] it's coming out of you
[54:50] why
[54:55] but why is people allowing things in
[54:57] their home they used to wouldn't allow
[54:59] lukewarmness why are people
[55:02] why are women putting stuff on their
[55:04] face they used to wouldn't do
[55:06] look warmness
[55:10] people like i said people are rejoicing
[55:12] about a vaccine
[55:14] over a covet that's you you've got about
[55:15] a 99 whatever percent chance of
[55:18] surviving
[55:19] on this right here if it takes you you
[55:21] have zero percent
[55:23] of surviving i'd be a lot more afraid of
[55:26] something that's got zero percent
[55:28] than 99 percent come on now
[55:32] but people will go they just live like
[55:34] it's going like it's just another day as
[55:35] usual you know
[55:36] just like they were in jesus day just
[55:38] another day things are
[55:40] but things are happening and things are
[55:41] being put it's just another day
[55:44] nothing really going on you know how
[55:48] people's minds have been so clouded up
[55:55] listen what we're seeing in our
[55:57] government is not about whether you
[55:59] agree with democrats or republicans
[56:01] what we're seeing in our government is
[56:03] satan coming into
[56:04] fulfillment
[56:10] it doesn't matter what side you feel
[56:12] you're on
[56:14] it's all the work of the s of the devil
[56:17] amen but people are and all these
[56:21] this age that we're living in it's a
[56:23] lukewarm age
[56:25] it don't really matter god didn't really
[56:28] don't really think that no more and
[56:31] people
[56:32] become lukewarm about scriptures that
[56:33] they used to hold very dear to their
[56:35] heart
[56:37] people become very lukewarm about
[56:39] gathering together which they used to
[56:40] hold very dear to their hearts
[56:42] people become very lukewarm about amen
[56:45] about their family life and things
[56:46] around that they used to hold dear to
[56:48] their heart
[56:49] people have become lukewarm about a lot
[56:50] of things
[56:54] it's creeping in it's a stronghold
[56:58] to try to hold you here
[57:03] listen the rapture
[57:06] the day of the rapture to many is going
[57:09] to be another day as usual
[57:13] but to some it's going to be the
[57:14] greatest day ever
[57:21] oh he cried out he's crying out in this
[57:24] last age you have the word
[57:26] you have the bible more bibles than ever
[57:29] but yet you're not doing anything about
[57:30] the word except dividing and hacking it
[57:32] into pieces
[57:33] taking what you want and leaving out
[57:35] what you don't want you're not
[57:37] interested in living it you're
[57:39] interested in debating it
[57:44] i would sooner you were cold or hot if
[57:46] you were cold and rejected
[57:48] if you were cold and rejected it i could
[57:50] i could stand there
[57:51] if you would get white hot and know it's
[57:53] the truth and live it i would praise you
[57:55] for it but when you simply take my word
[57:58] and don't honor it oh that's a sign of
[58:01] lukewarmness
[58:02] don't honor it how many people don't
[58:05] honor the presence of god no more
[58:09] it's a holy thing it's a it's a
[58:11] wonderful thing to be able to come into
[58:13] the presence of god
[58:14] but people don't honor it
[58:23] you know you walk into a a courtroom
[58:27] and the judge comes in my understanding
[58:29] is right you honor him by standing
[58:33] but you can see the presence of god
[58:34] sweep the sweep this audience
[58:36] and people just still sit in their seats
[58:38] and look around like nothing's going on
[58:40] what is it lukewarmness
[58:44] i'm not trying to say that you ought to
[58:46] be on your feet 100 of the time
[58:48] but when he comes in the room and it's
[58:50] very
[58:51] very obvious and very vivid when he
[58:53] comes in the room
[58:55] you realize something different is
[58:57] taking place that's the time to honor
[58:59] him
[59:00] lay aside the things that you're
[59:01] thinking about and the situations of
[59:03] tomorrow and yesterday
[59:05] and say i'm in the presence i'm not just
[59:07] some earthly judge
[59:08] i'm in the presence of the king of kings
[59:10] and the lord of lords
[59:12] therefore i'm going to honor him and
[59:14] worship him when he comes
[59:28] he says anybody knows that lukewarm
[59:30] water makes you sick to the stomach
[59:35] he says if you need something to cause
[59:37] you to vomit lukewarm water is about the
[59:38] best thing to drink
[59:40] a lukewarm church has made god sick
[59:47] and he's declared he would spew it out
[59:52] he said oh to god the church were cold
[59:54] or hot
[59:55] best of all she should be fervent
[59:59] if there's ever an hour to be fervent
[1:00:00] this is the hour
[1:00:03] if there's ever an hour to be sincere
[1:00:05] this is the hour
[1:00:06] if there's ever an hour to be looking
[1:00:09] for something to happen on a
[1:00:10] in a spiritual realm this is the hour if
[1:00:13] there was
[1:00:14] ever an hour to take advantage of every
[1:00:16] church service this is an hour
[1:00:19] if this is an hour if there's ever been
[1:00:21] an hour to be listening to tapes and
[1:00:23] reading your bible and praying
[1:00:25] this is the hour
[1:00:35] it says because thou sayest
[1:00:43] people may not say anything with their
[1:00:44] words
[1:00:46] about their lives but our lives speak
[1:00:49] volumes
[1:00:53] he said well i'm not trying to say i'm a
[1:00:55] christian well it's obvious when the
[1:00:57] white life you're living you're not
[1:01:01] amen
[1:01:05] because you can hear the word of god you
[1:01:06] can hear the the offer given for
[1:01:08] inoculation and you won't take it
[1:01:17] we see we see it here let me go back to
[1:01:19] where i was
[1:01:23] so because thou says they were talking
[1:01:26] as the mouthpiece of god
[1:01:31] they were trying to say things when god
[1:01:33] what god they were trying to say things
[1:01:35] that god wasn't saying
[1:01:39] you know the catholic church even says
[1:01:41] she speaks for god
[1:01:43] god help us if that's god's voice
[1:01:46] saying she has assured the voice of the
[1:01:48] lord
[1:01:50] how how any people can be so spiritually
[1:01:52] wicked is more than i know
[1:01:53] but they produce according to the seed
[1:01:55] which is in them the label to see in
[1:01:57] churches say it i am rich increased with
[1:01:59] goods
[1:02:00] and have need of nothing that was her
[1:02:02] self estimate
[1:02:05] that was not what god thought about her
[1:02:08] she looked at herself and what she saw
[1:02:09] and she said i'm rich
[1:02:11] which means she's wealthy in the things
[1:02:13] of this world
[1:02:14] thou says i'm increased with good which
[1:02:16] means i have
[1:02:17] which literally means i have spiritual
[1:02:19] wit riches that sounds like the
[1:02:21] millennium
[1:02:22] a street of gold and presence of god but
[1:02:24] there was very lacking
[1:02:26] in spiritual things
[1:02:36] you know it says brother branham puts us
[1:02:37] here he says if the church
[1:02:39] is truly spiritual rich its influence
[1:02:43] will be felt upon the community life
[1:02:48] wow
[1:02:51] we're here right now at the last calls
[1:02:55] go out into the highways and the byways
[1:02:59] beg them to come so that my table may be
[1:03:02] filled
[1:03:04] we're seeing it happen if there ever
[1:03:07] ought to be a time our church
[1:03:09] is felt in our community it ought to be
[1:03:11] this time right now
[1:03:15] this is why you're seeing people show up
[1:03:17] off the streets
[1:03:18] you're seeing people stop for no reason
[1:03:20] seemingly and just say i felt they came
[1:03:22] come here
[1:03:24] why because there's something that we
[1:03:26] have here that the world didn't give
[1:03:28] and the world can't take away
[1:03:32] amen you know he said exactly what kind
[1:03:34] of lives are these so-called spiritual
[1:03:36] influential men in the community living
[1:03:38] out in suburbia out in better
[1:03:40] class districts said let me tell you
[1:03:43] what kind of lives there
[1:03:44] wife swapping prostitution
[1:03:47] bands of children crashing parties
[1:03:50] exacting a terrible toll on property
[1:03:52] damage
[1:03:54] hello immorality has reached an all-time
[1:03:58] high
[1:03:58] in promiscuous sex acts narcotic
[1:04:01] addictions gambling stealing
[1:04:03] and all kinds of evil and the church
[1:04:05] goes on claiming how fine
[1:04:07] this generation is how full our churches
[1:04:11] are how responsive
[1:04:12] amen the mission fields are the church
[1:04:15] has turned to the people over to doctors
[1:04:17] especially psychiatrists
[1:04:22] amen how how he can parade about being
[1:04:25] spiritually rich is more than i know
[1:04:27] it isn't true they're bankrupt and they
[1:04:30] don't know it
[1:04:33] he said take a good look examine the
[1:04:35] people as you walk by
[1:04:36] in the multitudes can you pick out those
[1:04:39] who have a
[1:04:40] appearance of christians
[1:04:43] it's almost gotten possible
[1:04:47] you don't know the christians from the
[1:04:49] atheist anymore
[1:04:51] out in the world but yet apparently some
[1:04:55] supposedly dress don't matter
[1:04:59] watch how they dress watch how they act
[1:05:01] hear what they say
[1:05:02] see where they go surely there ought to
[1:05:04] be some real evidence of the new birth
[1:05:06] amongst all those who see we see go by
[1:05:09] but few there be
[1:05:10] and it's getting fewer and fewer and
[1:05:13] fewer
[1:05:16] yet the fundamental churches are crying
[1:05:18] out saying
[1:05:20] we've had millions saved this year and
[1:05:22] spirit filled
[1:05:24] and they call spirit filled those who
[1:05:27] frizz bobbed hair and shorts and slacks
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:31] painted up like jezebels
[1:05:34] hello message churches are calling
[1:05:37] women's spirit filled and they got pain
[1:05:39] all over their
[1:05:40] you're not spirit filled not by the holy
[1:05:42] spirit your spirit filled but by a
[1:05:44] different spirit
[1:05:49] it's still the word whether you want it
[1:05:51] or whether you don't want it
[1:05:59] what's problem lukewarmness
[1:06:04] likes a days ago
[1:06:07] daddies are out worried about money more
[1:06:09] than they're worried about their family
[1:06:12] got to have a job got to have this
[1:06:16] lukewarmness is taking over minds
[1:06:20] it's a stronghold
[1:06:23] it's taking over families
[1:06:34] he said he's gotten to such a point he
[1:06:35] said i would hate to even witness have
[1:06:37] to witness
[1:06:38] a display of in modesty what's called a
[1:06:41] display of miss
[1:06:42] he said it's so immodest i'd hate to
[1:06:43] know what a real display of modesty is
[1:06:46] because it's called morality and good
[1:06:48] people and
[1:06:49] everything's okay
[1:06:53] but if we see this world that we're
[1:06:55] living in
[1:06:57] they're saying i have need of nothing
[1:06:59] what they're saying is i have needed no
[1:07:01] need of god
[1:07:05] oh they want stuff they want more money
[1:07:06] they want more items they want more
[1:07:08] objects they want more lands they want
[1:07:10] more
[1:07:10] houses they're saying i don't need god
[1:07:14] and this is the world that we're living
[1:07:15] in amen i have need of
[1:07:17] nothing i have everything i want
[1:07:22] hello somebody i have everything i want
[1:07:28] you can spread express this any way you
[1:07:31] want and all it adds up to the fact
[1:07:33] that the church is complacent she's
[1:07:36] satisfied with what she has
[1:07:39] i don't want to be satisfied with what i
[1:07:40] have
[1:07:42] i don't want to be satisfied with the
[1:07:44] experience i have
[1:07:46] i want more of god i don't want to be
[1:07:50] satisfied with one good church service
[1:07:52] i want more good church service i don't
[1:07:54] want to be satisfied with one
[1:07:56] time the holy ghost falls in in the
[1:07:57] building we're all happy and we go oh no
[1:07:59] i wanted every service i don't want to
[1:08:02] be a
[1:08:02] halfway half-living nominal christian
[1:08:05] that's not who i'm called to be
[1:08:09] i'm not called to be a baptist message
[1:08:11] believer
[1:08:12] i'm not called to be a methodist message
[1:08:14] believer
[1:08:15] i mean i'm not called to be none of that
[1:08:17] i'm called to be
[1:08:18] his
[1:08:22] and live with for him with all my heart
[1:08:30] but lukewarmness is settling hearts
[1:08:34] well we're not a baptist but we act like
[1:08:36] one
[1:08:40] we dress like one we live like one
[1:08:46] you know we bring things in our homes
[1:08:52] maybe this is my new year service
[1:08:56] we bring stuff in our home sometimes we
[1:08:59] allow it to take
[1:09:00] preeminence why lukewarmness
[1:09:05] things that i'm talking about is not of
[1:09:06] god but actually
[1:09:08] angels angel god would warn the prophet
[1:09:11] about it tvs
[1:09:14] things that we put there before amen
[1:09:16] ourselves and
[1:09:17] and we feast upon them and feed upon
[1:09:19] them and we got it there
[1:09:21] i know today it may not be a tv it's
[1:09:23] hulu or something else
[1:09:35] my wife was actually telling him
[1:09:38] a man and his wife about the about
[1:09:42] the situation that when the devil talked
[1:09:44] about the tv there
[1:09:46] at youth camp trying
[1:09:49] to hear they had the tv on their wall
[1:09:51] and just trying to witness to them about
[1:09:53] what god is doing and we need to be more
[1:09:56] sincere more fervent
[1:09:58] not so caught up in these things and he
[1:10:01] just dismissed it as well i can
[1:10:03] understand if you really had a problem
[1:10:04] with it
[1:10:06] that was his answer that was his cop-out
[1:10:09] that the devil would call it out if you
[1:10:10] had a problem with it
[1:10:17] what is it lukewarmness
[1:10:21] people were drying up
[1:10:25] even before coven pastors were talking
[1:10:29] about they couldn't hardly get people to
[1:10:30] come on a wednesday night anymore
[1:10:33] sundays was but you know more about the
[1:10:35] ball game they had to go to or
[1:10:36] this that and the other whatever some
[1:10:38] other thing they had to go through
[1:10:40] too
[1:10:43] let's be honest people in this age is
[1:10:45] the age of easy living
[1:10:47] so we can become professional vacation
[1:10:49] goers
[1:10:51] and it's all about our pleasures and
[1:10:53] what we have and it's nothing no more
[1:10:55] about the kingdom of god
[1:10:57] and his righteousness and the fervent
[1:11:00] desire that we once used to have
[1:11:02] this is what happened in ephesus they
[1:11:04] lost their first
[1:11:05] love what happened luke warmness came in
[1:11:11] this is where we want to guard ourselves
[1:11:12] against it and realize
[1:11:14] satan is trying to do everything he can
[1:11:17] to steal the joy of god away from us
[1:11:20] to steal the joy of his presence and
[1:11:22] being in his presence
[1:11:24] and living for him satan's doing
[1:11:26] everything he can to destroy it
[1:11:30] make us complacent
[1:11:39] but god saw entirely different from what
[1:11:42] they saw
[1:11:44] they said they were rich spiritually
[1:11:47] wealthy they had arrived they had need
[1:11:49] of nothing
[1:11:50] but god said you're wretched miserable
[1:11:53] poor blind and naked
[1:11:55] and when a people are that way
[1:11:56] especially naked and don't know it
[1:11:58] there's something wrong somewhere
[1:12:02] surely something must be happening
[1:12:06] god also calls the church of laodicean
[1:12:08] age
[1:12:09] wretched
[1:12:13] he says the word comes from two greek
[1:12:15] words which means endure and trial
[1:12:17] it has nothing to do with trials that
[1:12:19] come to a true christian for god
[1:12:20] describes a christian trial
[1:12:22] as blessed and his attitude one of joy
[1:12:25] whereas
[1:12:26] he does this description his phrase
[1:12:28] phrase wretched and
[1:12:29] miserable and how how strange and the
[1:12:32] age of plenty
[1:12:34] miserable in an age of progress
[1:12:37] wretched and miserable in an age of
[1:12:40] abundance
[1:12:41] wretched and miserable how can there be
[1:12:44] trials in such a time
[1:12:46] it's strange but in the age of plenty
[1:12:48] and opportunity
[1:12:49] when everyone has so much and there's so
[1:12:51] much more to be had
[1:12:53] what with all the inventions to do our
[1:12:55] work and so many things to give us
[1:12:56] pleasure
[1:12:57] suddenly we find mental illness taking
[1:12:59] such a toll
[1:13:00] as such to alarm a nation when everybody
[1:13:03] ought to be happy with really nothing to
[1:13:05] be unhappy about
[1:13:06] millions are taking sedatives at night
[1:13:09] pep pills in the morning rushing to
[1:13:11] doctors in an institution
[1:13:13] trying to drown out unknown fears by
[1:13:15] alcohol this age
[1:13:17] boasts of his tremendous stores of
[1:13:18] worldly goods but this people
[1:13:21] are less happier than ever so it tells
[1:13:24] me there's nothing in this age
[1:13:26] you're gonna find happiness in amen
[1:13:29] this age boasts of his spiritual
[1:13:31] attainments but most more people are
[1:13:33] less sure of themselves than ever
[1:13:35] this age boasts a better morals but is
[1:13:37] more corrupt than any age since the
[1:13:39] flood
[1:13:40] it talks about knowledge and science but
[1:13:42] it's losing a battle in all fields
[1:13:44] for the human mind and soul and spirit
[1:13:47] cannot comprehend
[1:13:48] and keep abreast with all the changes
[1:13:51] that have come upon the earth
[1:13:52] in one generation we've gone from a
[1:13:54] horse and buggy to a space age
[1:13:56] and we're proud and boasting about it
[1:13:58] but inside
[1:13:59] it's dark void caverns that's crying out
[1:14:02] and
[1:14:03] torment without a known reason
[1:14:07] men's hearts are failing for fear the
[1:14:10] world is
[1:14:10] darkening and to where it could be
[1:14:12] called the age of neurotics
[1:14:17] it boasts but it can't back it up it
[1:14:18] cries peace
[1:14:20] but there'll be no peace
[1:14:23] did you hear that it cries that it has a
[1:14:27] great amplitude of all things
[1:14:29] but it keeps burning with a desire like
[1:14:32] an unsatisfied
[1:14:33] fire there is no peace says my god to
[1:14:36] the wicked
[1:14:36] they're miserable which means they're
[1:14:39] objects to be pitied
[1:14:43] they scorn pity they're full of pride
[1:14:45] they bought what they have
[1:14:46] but what they have will not stand the
[1:14:48] test of time they built upon the
[1:14:50] quicksand rather the rock of the
[1:14:52] revelation of god's word
[1:14:53] soon cometh the earthquake soon there
[1:14:57] will become storms of the wrath of god
[1:14:59] and judgment
[1:15:00] then comes sudden destruction in spite
[1:15:03] of all their carnal preparation
[1:15:06] they will still be unprepared for what's
[1:15:08] coming upon the earth
[1:15:13] they are those who spite of all their
[1:15:15] worldly efforts
[1:15:18] are actually opposing themselves and
[1:15:20] don't know it objects of pity are they
[1:15:22] indeed
[1:15:22] pity the poor people in the last
[1:15:24] economic medical move
[1:15:27] for they call it the move of god when it
[1:15:29] indeed is the move of satan
[1:15:33] pity
[1:15:36] don't envy them pity them
[1:15:42] they're poor this is what god is saying
[1:15:44] they're poor
[1:15:46] well i've never seen such wealth
[1:15:49] look at mr jeff bezos or whatever his
[1:15:52] name is
[1:15:53] wealthiest man wow such wealth never
[1:15:56] been such a wealthy man
[1:16:00] but indeed he's poor
[1:16:07] could you imagine the richest man on
[1:16:08] earth be the poorest man at the same
[1:16:11] time
[1:16:18] we see we see also he said they're blind
[1:16:21] and naked
[1:16:22] now this is really desperate how can
[1:16:24] anyone be blind and naked and don't know
[1:16:26] it
[1:16:28] what is it they can't perceive it they
[1:16:31] can't understand
[1:16:35] they've been blinded by the glare of an
[1:16:37] age
[1:16:40] and their eyes have caught the wrong
[1:16:43] thing
[1:16:44] you know brother danny steeman brought
[1:16:46] out in our one of our youth banquets
[1:16:47] here a couple of years ago
[1:16:49] about the sea turtles and how you know
[1:16:52] they're born on the beach
[1:16:53] and they've had to actually go and and
[1:16:56] change things the way they
[1:16:57] we they have built through the years
[1:16:59] because
[1:17:00] you know it would it would be the the
[1:17:03] sea
[1:17:04] that would catch the eye of the turtle
[1:17:06] the glistening of it at night as it
[1:17:07] would maybe catch the moon or
[1:17:09] or the stars that when they'd come out
[1:17:11] and they'd be born in the darkness
[1:17:14] that they would catch that and they
[1:17:16] would go that away he said well what
[1:17:17] happened with cities being built
[1:17:19] lights were put up and they would catch
[1:17:22] the light of the city
[1:17:24] and they would go the wrong way and
[1:17:26] we're seeing people heading the wrong
[1:17:28] way
[1:17:30] i'm going to take it a little down a
[1:17:32] little further i'm not even talking
[1:17:33] about the world we know where it's going
[1:17:34] i'm talking about people in our churches
[1:17:37] headed the wrong way their families are
[1:17:40] headed the wrong direction
[1:17:44] what is it they've caught the wrong
[1:17:45] light
[1:17:48] and he said those turtles instead of
[1:17:49] finding their life in the sea
[1:17:51] and growing up they they actually become
[1:17:53] smashed under a tire somewhere
[1:17:56] because they caught the wrong light
[1:17:59] and people are being caught up with the
[1:18:01] light of laodicea
[1:18:03] and this glare the frizzles and the
[1:18:08] boom and the shouts and oh this problem
[1:18:12] over here and that over there
[1:18:14] and they're being blinded by it
[1:18:19] blindness has taken in
[1:18:26] we see as we're going down
[1:18:36] read this here
[1:18:42] he said they have become blind because
[1:18:46] they refused the word of god
[1:18:50] these are they who have stripped
[1:18:52] themselves naked by leaving god's care
[1:18:54] and protection
[1:18:56] and sought to build their own way of
[1:18:57] salvation
[1:18:59] their own tower of babel oh how lovely
[1:19:02] and beautifully dressed they appear in
[1:19:03] their own eyes as they form their
[1:19:05] general assemblies and their councils
[1:19:07] but now god is stripping it all the way
[1:19:10] and they're naked for their
[1:19:11] organizations have led them into the
[1:19:13] camp of the antichrist
[1:19:14] into the field of tares right to the
[1:19:17] binding and burning
[1:19:18] objects of pity indeed they are yes pity
[1:19:21] them
[1:19:22] warn them beseech them still they go
[1:19:24] their way headlong to destruction
[1:19:26] wrathfully turning away any and all
[1:19:28] attempts to save them
[1:19:29] as brands from the burning miserable
[1:19:32] indeed they are yet they know it ought
[1:19:34] not
[1:19:34] callous and beyond hope they glory in
[1:19:37] what is
[1:19:37] actually their shame define against the
[1:19:40] word
[1:19:41] yet one day they'll be judged by that
[1:19:43] same word
[1:19:44] and pay the price of its indictments
[1:19:55] as we talked about it
[1:19:59] people are all caught up in this new
[1:20:02] vaccine and i'm not going to say whether
[1:20:04] you should take it or you shouldn't take
[1:20:06] it
[1:20:07] they think it's the savior
[1:20:10] curing all problems the world pro listen
[1:20:13] this is only the beginning if you felt
[1:20:16] unrest during this time you don't want
[1:20:19] to be here when the bride leaves
[1:20:22] if you felt anxiety during this time you
[1:20:25] don't want to be here when the bride
[1:20:26] leaves
[1:20:29] amen they're thinking it'll cure the
[1:20:31] worry and the anxiety
[1:20:34] yet there's a vaccine that's available
[1:20:38] that if you don't take it there's zero
[1:20:42] survival rate if you don't take it
[1:20:47] there's a zero percent of a rapture rate
[1:20:51] you will go into destruction and wake
[1:20:53] the judgment
[1:20:55] and this vaccine is not a man-made
[1:20:57] vaccine
[1:20:58] it's a god-made vaccine it's been tested
[1:21:01] it's been tried and it's shown over
[1:21:03] thousands of years
[1:21:05] to hold true amen it held through the
[1:21:09] dark ages some of the darkest times
[1:21:11] even when women would watch their kids
[1:21:13] but brains be bashed out
[1:21:15] it held
[1:21:20] it was they took the vaccine they took
[1:21:22] price they took the answer
[1:21:24] and it held and you're seeing a little
[1:21:27] bit of a sickness come by with 99.7
[1:21:31] and people are falling away why they
[1:21:34] haven't taken the vaccine
[1:21:38] because this vaccine holds when you see
[1:21:42] these signs coming you're not going to
[1:21:43] fall away you're going to go further in
[1:21:46] to christ say man you know brother brown
[1:21:49] would talk about a vaccine he says
[1:21:51] you know a man dying on the doorsteps of
[1:21:53] a doctor's office when the doctor in the
[1:21:55] building
[1:21:56] has a cure for his disease but he
[1:21:58] refuses to take it
[1:21:59] if a man has a disease and the doctor
[1:22:02] has a cure for it
[1:22:03] the man may lay on the doctor's
[1:22:04] doorsteps but if he refuses to take the
[1:22:07] medicine he'll die
[1:22:10] and we're not talking about a vaccine
[1:22:11] that may we're talking about a cure
[1:22:15] amen we're talking a cure a man may lay
[1:22:17] on the doctor's doorsteps but if he
[1:22:19] refuses it
[1:22:20] he'll die you can't blame the doctor the
[1:22:22] doctor tried to give it to him
[1:22:24] if he'd only come and take it but it
[1:22:26] isn't the doctor's fault he's got the
[1:22:28] remedy
[1:22:28] but men is too stubborn to take it then
[1:22:31] whose fault is it
[1:22:33] he said oh praise the lord thank you so
[1:22:35] what about this
[1:22:36] he says people die in the front of
[1:22:39] churches
[1:22:40] on steps in pews they die in their sins
[1:22:44] because they refuse the cure
[1:22:48] there is a cure for laodicea
[1:22:51] there is a cure for this lukewarmness
[1:22:53] there is something that will break the
[1:22:55] stronghold
[1:22:56] of laodicea for lives
[1:22:59] i know it's going to break strongholds
[1:23:01] off of lies because he promised it would
[1:23:03] he said to him that overcometh
[1:23:15] they die in their sins because they
[1:23:17] refuse it
[1:23:18] not because there wasn't any
[1:23:21] there is cure there is a
[1:23:24] a vaccine there is a serum there is a
[1:23:28] remedy however you want to word it
[1:23:30] but you got to take it
[1:23:38] we have a few brother tim's use this
[1:23:40] analogy it's really good
[1:23:42] but we have a few cows left and we're
[1:23:44] planning to get rid of this spring
[1:23:49] we're looking out there and we see some
[1:23:51] of them that's
[1:23:52] sowing signs of being wormy
[1:23:56] weights falling off and they're getting
[1:23:58] what they call bottle jaw and they
[1:24:00] they they're appetiting there and so we
[1:24:03] know they need a medicine
[1:24:06] in a few days lord well i'm gonna go out
[1:24:07] there and i'm gonna put them in a pen
[1:24:09] and i'm gonna sort them out and i'm
[1:24:11] gonna
[1:24:11] put them through a chute they're not
[1:24:13] gonna like it they're not going to want
[1:24:15] to be there
[1:24:16] they're going to hate it they're going
[1:24:17] to fight every step of the way but they
[1:24:19] ain't got a choice
[1:24:22] because i have a system designed that's
[1:24:24] going to get them to where i need them
[1:24:25] to be
[1:24:26] to administer what i need to administer
[1:24:31] but people can come to a church
[1:24:34] the man of god can pour his heart out
[1:24:37] the medicine that is needed
[1:24:39] for the cure of sin the medicine that is
[1:24:43] needed to take the pain off your face
[1:24:46] the medicine are needed that'll give you
[1:24:47] joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:24:50] the medicine that is needed that'll heal
[1:24:52] families
[1:24:54] the medicine that is needed to put them
[1:24:55] all back together again
[1:24:57] amen he'll deliver it but the difference
[1:24:59] is you have a choice
[1:25:05] but if you die it won't be the
[1:25:06] preacher's fault
[1:25:09] because he'd been preaching the word of
[1:25:10] god if you go into destruction
[1:25:13] it won't be this pulpit's fault
[1:25:16] because you've heard the war how he's
[1:25:17] heard the warnings i mean he's heard the
[1:25:20] word priests over this pulpit
[1:25:21] without fear of favor amen so if
[1:25:24] somebody goes there it's not because it
[1:25:26] hasn't been given
[1:25:27] or a way out it's because they choose it
[1:25:35] he said they die sitting right on a pew
[1:25:43] he said it wasn't because there wasn't
[1:25:44] done there it was there but men and
[1:25:46] women just refuse to take it
[1:25:48] they die right there in the church
[1:25:49] sitting in meetings listen night after
[1:25:51] night to inspired prophets of god
[1:25:53] who take the world word fearlessly and
[1:25:55] lay it out
[1:25:56] ye must be born again men and women set
[1:25:59] in the pew and die
[1:26:00] and sink into utter despair annihilated
[1:26:03] from god
[1:26:04] not because there wasn't grace and
[1:26:06] salvation but it was because they
[1:26:08] refused to receive it
[1:26:11] and this is what he said is there no
[1:26:12] bomb in gilead then why is the daughter
[1:26:15] of my people so sick
[1:26:16] isn't there a physician there to sure
[1:26:18] there is
[1:26:19] isn't there prophet sure there is isn't
[1:26:21] there preachers sure there is
[1:26:23] isn't there a word of god that's true
[1:26:25] and infallible sure there is
[1:26:27] why are they sick because they won't
[1:26:29] take the medicine
[1:26:33] they refuse it
[1:26:37] now we know medicine has been tested
[1:26:42] they find a what we might call a toxin
[1:26:45] they
[1:26:45] put some kind of other stuff with it try
[1:26:48] it on a guinea pig and
[1:26:50] and that you know after they work with
[1:26:51] it for for a time they shoot it into
[1:26:53] this pig to
[1:26:54] watch the reaction and if it doesn't
[1:26:56] hurt him they try to use it on humans
[1:26:59] but medicine is a chance to take
[1:27:04] let's just be honest the vaccine at his
[1:27:07] best
[1:27:07] is a chance to take
[1:27:11] that's why i we've always prayed you
[1:27:14] know when you
[1:27:14] take vaccine vaccinations lord let this
[1:27:18] thing do what it's supposed to do
[1:27:20] and don't let no harm come from it
[1:27:23] brother tim was talking about it there
[1:27:24] they shall drink no deadly
[1:27:26] drink drink it if they drink any deadly
[1:27:28] thing it shall not harm them
[1:27:30] it's very applicable to this age there's
[1:27:32] people with cancer having to take some
[1:27:34] deadly stuff
[1:27:36] but i pray that that stuff goes and
[1:27:37] kills the cancer
[1:27:44] medicine is a chance to take
[1:27:48] medicines will help one human being and
[1:27:50] might kill another one
[1:27:52] you know mercy you're hearing
[1:27:54] advertisements of medicine
[1:27:56] don't listen to that fast talking if you
[1:27:57] catch that you won't take any medicine
[1:28:01] man there's all kinds of stuff that
[1:28:02] stuff can possibly do
[1:28:05] sometimes you might must be sure that
[1:28:07] you know what you're doing let a doctor
[1:28:09] that knows how to give it
[1:28:10] someone you got confidence in he said we
[1:28:13] hear so much today about heart disease
[1:28:15] heart troubles the number one killer in
[1:28:17] america heart trouble
[1:28:21] sin is the number one he said heart
[1:28:23] trouble is not the number one killer
[1:28:25] sin is the number one killer sin is what
[1:28:28] does the kid
[1:28:29] killing you might be able to pat your
[1:28:30] body up for a little while but the
[1:28:32] body's going to die anyhow and go into
[1:28:34] the dust
[1:28:34] but the soul will live somewhere you
[1:28:36] under that's the killer is sins of the
[1:28:38] soul
[1:28:39] that's the number one killer in america
[1:28:43] so if we know what the number one killer
[1:28:45] which by the way
[1:28:47] it's come out that we have set a record
[1:28:49] this year this past year for cancer
[1:28:51] deaths it's the lowest ever
[1:28:55] how's that food for thought i'll leave
[1:28:57] you with it
[1:29:05] covet ain't the number one killer
[1:29:09] cancer is not the number one killer
[1:29:11] heart trouble is not the one
[1:29:12] number one killer and people get all
[1:29:14] worked up about it sin
[1:29:16] is the number one killer and sin is
[1:29:19] trying to permeate your lives and
[1:29:21] come in day after day laodicea is kind
[1:29:23] of like sandpaper
[1:29:25] is constantly there rubbing against you
[1:29:29] you can take a sandpaper light as it can
[1:29:31] be and you rub it long enough
[1:29:32] it'll rub this wood completely out of
[1:29:34] existence
[1:29:36] it's the truth and laodicea we've
[1:29:38] watched it on people's lives
[1:29:40] it is totally amen it went right down to
[1:29:42] the baptist baptist or today
[1:29:44] not what they used to be pentecostals
[1:29:46] today are not what they used to be why
[1:29:48] lukewarmness of laodicea
[1:29:51] there i say message people many of them
[1:29:53] are not what they used to be
[1:29:56] what is it laodicea is constantly
[1:29:59] against your convictions
[1:30:00] against your god against everything
[1:30:03] that's godly
[1:30:04] trying to rub it all out we are seeing
[1:30:07] the world
[1:30:08] that's trying to rub out anything to do
[1:30:10] with god
[1:30:17] sin is the number one killer
[1:30:20] so why wouldn't you take that vaccine
[1:30:37] he said the man just lay there and just
[1:30:39] die
[1:30:41] why don't you just go in and get the
[1:30:42] medicine
[1:30:46] he said you can talk to them about their
[1:30:48] soul and the sin and their life
[1:30:51] yet people won't go in it's their
[1:30:54] unbelief
[1:30:56] if you believe god you'd rush to calvary
[1:30:58] just as quick as you could
[1:31:00] god has a remedy for unbelief
[1:31:03] god has a remedy for anxiety god has a
[1:31:06] remedy for fear
[1:31:08] god has a remedy for every sickness god
[1:31:11] has a remedy for everything the devil
[1:31:13] could ever do to you
[1:31:15] or put upon you god has a remedy for it
[1:31:21] you talked about when they had
[1:31:22] diphtheria and there was no toxin many
[1:31:25] people died
[1:31:27] it was a time there was no toxin for
[1:31:28] typhoid fever
[1:31:31] they got toxins there were vaccines
[1:31:32] today for those things
[1:31:34] he said there was a time when there was
[1:31:36] no bomb in gilead for your sin
[1:31:38] but that's not today for in the day in
[1:31:41] the house of david
[1:31:42] the house of god is a fountain open for
[1:31:45] you to be washed and cleaned again
[1:31:47] and made new and though your sins be as
[1:31:49] scarlet

[1:31:54] and women who's been made in the image
[1:31:55] of god stand
[1:31:56] and say that god's word's not right they
[1:31:59] doubt this they doubt whether it's so or
[1:32:00] not

[1:32:05] of your doubts and your fears
[1:32:07] and your anxiety there is a fountain for

[1:33:20] the churches now go back about
[1:33:22] three uh maybe three verses let me look
[1:33:24] at it
[1:33:25] i'll just go back
[1:33:31] i think this is where i want to be i
[1:33:32] counsel thee to buy me gold strident of
[1:33:34] fire

[1:33:36] noticing he's given the vaccine
[1:33:39] white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:33:41] clothed that the shame of thy nakedness
[1:33:43] do not appear

[1:33:46] thou mayest see
[1:33:48] there is a people that's going to accept
[1:33:50] this vaccine
[1:33:53] that's going to tear down the
[1:33:54] strongholds of laodicea
[1:33:57] there will not be a laodicean lukewarm
[1:33:59] and ungodly and without god
[1:34:01] will but will be on fire with the fire
[1:34:04] of almighty god
[1:34:05] there is a people who will be on fire
[1:34:08] with the holy ghost

[1:35:11] and he come in and he began to reveal
[1:35:14] who he really was
[1:35:15] the way he broke bread
[1:35:20] he broke bread and there was another
[1:35:22] piece there he broke bread
[1:35:28] and there was another piece there
[1:35:32] they knew who he was because they seen
[1:35:34] him do it before
[1:35:36] hallelujah to him that overcometh will i
[1:35:40] grant to sit with me in my throne

[1:35:50] throne even as i'm also overcome
[1:35:52] and have set down with my father in his

[1:35:59] saith unto the churches listen we got
[1:36:02] we got hebrews 11 they can tell you
[1:36:04] people that listen to the voice of god
[1:36:06] not only listen
[1:36:07] but they received it and they acted upon
[1:36:10] it
[1:36:10] they just didn't allow it to go in one
[1:36:12] ear and out the other no but they'd
[1:36:14] heard it
[1:36:14] they received it and they acted upon it
[1:36:17] and there's also a people here in this
[1:36:19] hour
[1:36:19] that's hearing the word receiving the
[1:36:21] word and acting upon the word
[1:36:24] hallelujah amen this is why paul would
[1:36:26] say hey we've got a great cloud of
[1:36:28] witnesses
[1:36:29] that this power works that there this
[1:36:32] god works he's not going to leave us
[1:36:34] alone
[1:36:34] he's not going to leave us by herself
[1:36:36] he's with enoch he was with noah
[1:36:38] he was with moses there's all kind of
[1:36:40] testimonies god
[1:36:41] has never left any one of his and he's
[1:36:44] not going to start now
[1:36:46] amen we've got a cloud of witnesses and
[1:36:48] so therefore if we've got this cloud of
[1:36:50] witnesses and saying god's
[1:36:52] going to do what he said he would do
[1:36:54] then let's lay aside every week
[1:36:57] let's lay aside the lukewarmness of
[1:36:58] laodicea
[1:37:00] let's lay aside our bitterness just say
[1:37:06] something right there
[1:37:07] there's people in this church that's
[1:37:08] carried bitterness too long
[1:37:11] it's time to lay it down i don't care
[1:37:14] who it's against or who it's about
[1:37:16] lay it down this ain't the time for that
[1:37:19] this is a time to lay aside every weight
[1:37:22] amen it's time to get real and get right
[1:37:24] with god
[1:37:25] lay aside every way and the sin that was
[1:37:27] though so easily beset us
[1:37:29] and run with patience the race that has
[1:37:31] set before us
[1:37:32] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:37:34] finisher of our faith
[1:37:35] who is the joy who for the joy was set
[1:37:38] before him endured the cross
[1:37:39] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:37:42] the right hand of the throne of god
[1:37:43] for consider him that endures such
[1:37:46] contradiction of sinners against himself
[1:37:48] lest ye be wearied and feign in your
[1:37:52] minds
[1:37:55] this laodicea takes over your mind
[1:38:02] jesus what an example
[1:38:06] he didn't he he didn't put it in he
[1:38:08] didn't put this vaccine
[1:38:10] or this serum in a guinea pig he came
[1:38:13] down
[1:38:13] and he tried it in himself
[1:38:17] that's when you know a man's got
[1:38:19] confidence in what he's got
[1:38:22] god had confidence therefore he came
[1:38:24] down he said i'll take it
[1:38:26] and i'll show you it works and he took
[1:38:29] it at the river jordan
[1:38:30] and it kept him in the trials of life
[1:38:32] and the mocking and all the problems
[1:38:34] that came his way
[1:38:35] it kept him
[1:38:40] i'm thankful we're not dependent upon
[1:38:42] some man-made vaccine
[1:38:47] but we're dependent upon a god-made
[1:38:51] word that's going to take us
[1:38:54] out of here i don't know about you but
[1:38:57] that makes
[1:38:58] me very happy to think about that
[1:39:02] that i'm not staying here this world is
[1:39:04] not my home
[1:39:06] could you imagine not having a hope
[1:39:11] and you're wondering what's happening
[1:39:12] right now and what's going on
[1:39:15] disturbed there's a lot of disturbed
[1:39:19] people right now
[1:39:22] worried people
[1:39:25] anxiety to this fullness men's hearts
[1:39:28] are failing for fear
[1:39:30] why because laodicea and his
[1:39:34] lukewarmness
[1:39:36] has put their eyes out and they can't
[1:39:39] see
[1:39:40] but thank god for myself
[1:39:45] you know i went through the different
[1:39:46] times i believe it was about three times
[1:39:48] he mentioned it
[1:39:49] as far as mentioning the vision but i
[1:39:52] believe he told it about three times
[1:39:53] what i found so far
[1:39:55] of the bride the church and the bride
[1:39:58] the preview
[1:40:00] but in the masterpiece he says one thing
[1:40:02] that caught my attention
[1:40:04] he said that that last time as that
[1:40:06] bride came through
[1:40:10] he said there was a few in the back he
[1:40:13] said it started to get out of step
[1:40:16] he said what was they was not looking at
[1:40:17] the right thing
[1:40:19] he said they was looking at the church
[1:40:21] going in chaos
[1:40:25] we've got to keep our eyes on jesus
[1:40:28] he's the one who started the work he's
[1:40:30] the one who's going to finish the work
[1:40:32] he's not going to get to this age and
[1:40:34] say i quit
[1:40:40] we're only at the beginning it's going
[1:40:43] home time
[1:40:44] it's time to take a body change
[1:40:48] god bless you tonight liz bowery heads
[1:40:58] you need a determination
[1:41:01] i'm not going down in defeat
[1:41:05] that's not who i am
[1:41:09] i'm determined to see jesus
[1:41:12] when you come with that determination
[1:41:14] god will make a way for you to see
[1:41:18] he will show himself to you
[1:41:34] how many tonight just examine your lives
