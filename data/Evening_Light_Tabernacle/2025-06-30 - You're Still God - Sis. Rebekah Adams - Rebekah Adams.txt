========================================

[Music] When all foundations have been shen when I'm left standing in the dark and all I feel is my heart breaking. You still rain and you're still gone. When it feels all hope is faded, the heavy questions hit so hard. And though my soul may feel forsaken, you still reign and you're still gone. I can't see what's before me. I know that I can trust your heart. In this one truth will be my story. You still reign in God. I will declare that you are with me. No voices whisper that you're not. You'll never leave me or take me. You're still gone. I can't see what me. I know that I can trust your heart. And this one truth will be my story. Oh, will rain your stor. You are good and you are faithful as you have been. working all things for your glory. Cuz you still reign and you're still and when my enemies surround me, I'll trust the victory of your cross and fix my eyes upon you, Jesus. [Applause] You are God and I am not. You are good and you are faithful. As you have been working all things for glory cuz you still reign in your heart. I can't do all me. I know that I can trust your heart. Won't truth be my story. [Music] Then you still reign and you're still God. This one truth will be my story. Oh, you still rain and you're still gone. [Music]
