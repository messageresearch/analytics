just let him know once again we're praying for him and lifting him up before the lord in his battle with the sickness that he's dealing with i know our god is great enough amen so just want to wish him a happy birthday also amen amen also it had prayer for young boy isaac hildebrandt that had was facing serious issues in his body and his intestines and things been going on for quite some time and doctors were expecting the worse and and expecting to maybe have to do surgery on him and things but today the reporters wants to thank you for your prayers we're all done they had they had all the checks today and said isaac is enjoying some chicken fingers and mashed potatoes solid food tastes really good after a day and a half of fluids but the endoscope which checks the stomach and top of the small intestine was perfect the colonoscopy showed mild colitis with inflammation throughout we're expecting to remove we were expecting also to remove several polyps that were there last time but they only found one very small one the doctor liked to switch to a different medication to try and further reduce the inflammation in the large intestine in the next few weeks but isaac is doing awesome came through it all like a champ we want to thank you all for your prayers and we're still believing and we're thanking god for his good report and believing for a complete healing amen so we thank the lord for that amen he truly is a great god amen let's turn our bibles to acts chapter 2 and verse 1. i want to kind of skip through here for uh i love to read all of it but we're very familiar with this scripture amen i believe it's it's very much as applicable to us and the time that we're living in it says here and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all in one accord and in one place and suddenly they came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all in the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as unto fire and it set upon each of them and they were all filled with a holy ghost and began to speak in other tongues as a spirit gave them utterance and they were dwelling in jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold or not all these which speak galileans and how we how here we every man in our own tongue therein we were born now look on down to verse 12 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meanest this others mocked and said these men are full of new wine but peter standing upon the up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said to them ye men of judea and all that dwell in jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which is spoken by the prophet joel i want to go on down to verse i believe 37 and we know that he preached a mighty sermon there he said but now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remissions of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call amen will let you be seated this evening i'd like to speak to you on the same light the same effect and the same effect two words here affect and effect one starts with a one starts with e and many times we intertwine them and and probably use them and wrong in the wrong places and and at the wrong times because they're so close but they actually have a different meaning and a different wor use the word affect which starts with a is an action word the word e the effect is an object word so the verb affect means to act on or to produce a change in something effect which is most commonly used as a noun meaning result or the consequent or the end result so affect is for action effect is for result and here are some synonyms of effect it means to alter to change to influence to modify to impact so amen as we look this at in the same context as the light we know the or the holy ghost and the word of god the holy ghost it alters it has altered us it has changed us it has influenced us it is modifying us amen is impacting us and every one of us could say amen to that i'm sure tonight because we could look maybe what we were even five years ago two years ago or whatever and we came in contact with the word of god 20 years ago and we can say it has altered us it has changed us it has influenced us it has impacted us but the effect is the word like a is a result or the outcome or the as as as the outcome of the impact so but whether it's the effect or the effect the holy ghost is the same it has the same results it has the same change in power it has the same altering power it says the same modifying power it has the same effect so if one received the holy ghost back 20 years ago and once receives it today it still has the same effect upon their lives or the same effect amen even it was 2 000 years ago on the day of pentecost where they receive the holy ghost we'll find out tonight that that holy ghost when it falls again upon a person it still has the same effect on their lives amen you know and we can we can start looking at this because we know it's the same light and it has the same manifestations you can take the sun out there and it rises and it has an effect upon a plant life and it touches it it affects it it alters it it changes it all kinds of things happen and you can take that same plant and take it out of the presence of the sun and it would begin to die it would begin to wither away it would begin to maybe not grow and not flourish but if you can you can put it under another light you could put it under one of these lights and it would not have the same effect but if you put it out there again under the next day or the next week or whatever and if it still had life in it and that sun began to shine on it it would be the same light that gave birth as it came out of the ground it would begin to have again the same effect upon its life because it's the same light and therefore we know that if the holy ghost fell 2 000 years ago is the same today as it was then it'll also do the same thing today for whoever receives it amen and so i looking at this thought on the light being the same we we can see it very quickly watch it as it goes down to the seven church ages all the way down that it is the same light it is the same spirit of god it is the same attribute of god it is the same god it is the same jesus christ it is the same and it's depicted very clearly in the lamp stands in zechariah 4 and 1 we could read about the angel that talked with him and he said what see us thou and i said i've looked and behold a candlestick all of gold and and the bowl and the top of it and seven lamps thereon and seven pipes which are on the top of it but notice they were all connected to one source they were all connected they didn't have their own source they wasn't piped from somewhere else or some other place they all everyone individually came from the same place and and he said the two olive trees by one on the right side and on the other on the left side and i answered and i spaken the angels saying what are these my lord and the angel answered and said to me knowest thou not what these be and i said no lord and he answered and said this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by by by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts so in other words he is speaking right there that my spirit is going to remain the same it's going to have the same power it's going to have the same life-giving power it's going to give the same light it's going to give the same manifestations it's going to do it all the same because it's coming from the same source now brother branham would look at this and he would begin to draw it out and he said here's another lamp of pure gold it's burning brightly because it has plenty of oil which is getting from these two olive trees one standing on one side and other on and the other and he said these two trees represent the old and new testament and of course the oil typifies the holy ghost who along can give the light of god to god's people the angel who spoke to zechariah was as much saying this what you see means the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or its own power it will only accomplish things by the holy ghost amen therefore we can't take creeds we can't take dogments we can't take ideas of men and we can't put them into this message we can't we got to keep it in it's purity and it's holiness to know that if it if it comes it will produce the same life in its purity amen so we examine this uh lampstand and you'll notice it has a large bowl and in the center it is pulling from a source it is pulling it and the priest just kept pouring oil into this bowl and it would go into each lamp stand into each light now the lamp was lit in a special way first the priest took a fire from the sacred altar which is originally lighted by the fire of god he lit it first of all the lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl he then lit the second and then the third and then the fourth and all the way down to the seventh until all lamps were burning and it said the holy fire from the altar being passed from lamp to lamp to lamp is a wonderful type of the holy spirit throughout the seven church ages the original outpouring of pentecost which is outpouring came directly from jesus on the mercy seat is in doing his church throughout all the seven ages and showing forth perfectly that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and then and the never changing god and his essence in all of his ways and he's showing very very plainly amen as he said i am the vine and ye are the branches that the life or the oil or the spirit is coming from that that vine into those branches and it's producing the same life it's producing the same overcoming power and it ain't our power because he showed us that we can we don't have any power but it's the power of the holy ghost working through the church amen and so we see here as it comes out of that original root from the original seed that has life in it now the vine does not bear fruit the branches do that you said you can take a citrus tree and you can graft it into a grapefruit and a lemon and a lemon lemon to it and a tangelo limb and any other kind of citrus limb and it would grow all those kind of fruits a limb a lemon lime will grow lemons an orange limb will grow oranges but if that original vine ever puts off on its own branch again it'll produce what is in that original vine amen if it's a grapefruit it won't produce oranges it won't produce lemons it won't produce anything but what's in the lime amen what's in the vine and so he says that's the way the church is the vine has been split there's been grafts and there's been this grafted in you got a methodist limb and presbyterian limb and a pentecostal limb and a baptist limb and all kinds of limbs grafted in but if that that vine ever puts off another branch it will have the same life as the original did hallelujah amen they said exactly it'll be the same kind of branch that brought forth at pentecost it will speak in tongues it will prophesy it will have the same power it will have the signs of the resurrected jesus christ in it because it's thriving on the same source as the vine itself hallelujah it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born into the vine hallelujah amen you wasn't grafted here you were born in that's why it's not coming and putting your name on a book and and you sign a paper saying i'll serve him and i'll do this and you sign promise keeper notes and all kind no that's being grafted in but when you're born of the same spirit of god it's no longer you trying anymore because it's not you anymore it's the work of the holy ghost the same light having the same effect and effect upon your life amen he said how thrilling is to think that the seven lamps are drawing life and light from the resources of that main bowl because they had their wicks dipped therein he said each church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the holy ghost how many can see that in the messengers of the seven church ages oh yeah amen i'm setting you up for something his wick has been immersed in christ though that wick he's he through that week he is drawing the very life of christ and by it gives light unto the church and what kind of light he's given is he given the very same light that what the first lamp was lit with amen right on down to the ages to present present time the last day messenger the same life the same light is manifested by the life that was hidden christ and god he said but now here we go not only do we speak thus of the messengers does this speak of the messenger but every true believer is dramatically depicted here amen they are all drawing from the same source they have all been dipped into the same bowl they are dead to themselves and their lives are hidden christ in god they're sealed in by the holy ghost ephesians 4 30 said grieve not the holy spirit of god wherein you're sealed into the day of redemption and no man can pluck them out of his hand their lives cannot be tempered with the visible life of the burning shining is giving light and the manifestations of the holy ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in god and fed by the lord's word satan cannot touch them amen satan cannot touch them not even death can touch them for death has lost his sting and the grave has lost his victory amen you are depicted here very dramatically it's not by your power that you're here tonight you're not here because you had some superhuman power to withstand laodicea and you've been doing a good job no it's not you that doing the work it's christ that's living on the inside of you it's the same light that struck peter on that day that one day he was a coward one day he was he was saying he didn't even know jesus until when he met that life for himself he could stand up and preach the word of god and three thousand souls give their heart to god you have been endued with the same power by the same holy ghost it's the same promise i'm going to go through some things here it's the same manner we know the manner that fell brother would type that to the manna be in the holy ghost the same baptism of the holy ghost he said see it's the same manner that fell on them talking about those in the day of pentecost to give them eternal life like the manna that carried the children of israel through the wilderness is the same baptism of the holy ghost that will carry the church through to glory shouting grounds right there amen you've seen what it did for the children of israel it took them through dry land it took them through enemies it took them through where there's no food no water it held them it kept them and it took them into the promised land you see what it did for peter and paul and all those down to the dark ages they held on it had affected their lives so where they could hold on he said every man that will come to christ and believe that he is a rewarder of those who seek him and give up their sins and throw their arms open to god can have not something that looks like it not an invitation of it but a genuine heart full of the real baptism of the holy ghost like it fell on the day of pentecost make the man it'll make the same signs it'll have the same wonders it'll make you act the same way well what is the effect what is the effect of this it'll make you act like a drunk man liquor's been around for thousands of years and it still has the same effect amen wine has been around for thousands of years and it still has the same effect the holy ghost has been around for thousands of years and it still has the same effect creeds can try to dampen it they can say it ain't so all they want to but if you ever get a drink of it if you ever get a real dose of the holy ghost it'll have the same effect on your life it'll make you act like a drunk man carry on just like they did on the day of pentecost oh my every believer has a right to receive it just like every priest coming into the priesthood had a right to get a dose of that original manner so does everyone that comes into this priesthood have a right to the same kind of dose as they had on the day of pentecost i don't care what a preacher says it's what the bible says we have a right it's our in enable right to have the holy ghost to have the power of god to have healings and deliverances it is our rights he says my i wish i was twice my size so i can make twice as much noise amen you know we could read about the parable of the bridegroom is he would give the invitation he would furnish with robes which is the type of the holy ghost he would invite because he would invite poor and he would invite rich and to make everyone look the same he would give them all the same kind of robe amen the poor has the same as the rich man does so when they put on this robe you couldn't tell the difference amen and he said when god gives a poor man the holy ghost it's the same holy ghost he gives to a rich man hallelujah they all have it that to be the same that's when they come into the present god no one can say i dress better because it's the same blood it's the same grace it's the same holy ghost making you act the same way if a rich man gets the holy ghost he'll act just like the poor man does this ain't an uh exclusive gospel to where you got to have certain amount of this to be here or you have to do a certain no god gives to whosoever wants and desires it and if they want a taste of it he'll give them a taste of it if they want a spoonful he'll give it to him if they want a cup full they'll give it to him if they want a wheelbarrow load he'll give it to him don't matter what kind of bank account you got has nothing that determines nothing when it comes to getting the holy ghost amen he is here working with his church in the form of the spirit of god that if his spirit is with us he'll act exactly like he acted when he was here on earth and it'll make you act the same way because it's not your spirit anymore it's his spirits in you amen it'll probably change some of the ways some of you act because it won't be your spirit no more if a man's born of god he believes every word god wrote he said and says he just as great today as he ever was he never changes he's just the same yesterday today and forever if he's filled with the holy ghost he's got the same holy ghost to give on the day of pentecost and makes him act the same way and do the same things if he's born of the spirit of god mark 16 these signs shall follow them that belief so they'll act the same way they'll go out there and they'll fulfill the commission of god that he spoke go go into all the world and preach the gospel and to them that believe baptize you'll lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover amen they're acting the same way just like paul after peter received the holy ghost he went to the gate called beautiful peter and john and they saw that man they're begging for arms and they say hey silver and gold have i none but what i do have i can give you some of it amen what i do have i just happen to just get a good dose of the holy ghost the pillar of fire is not no longer above me it's living on the inside of me it's no longer jesus walking with me it's jesus walking in me look on me and he fastened his eyes upon them and he said in the name of jesus rise up and walk and that man stood up and began to leap and praise god that'll make you act the same way he said here stands the anointed apostles going up to the up to pentecost to receive the holy ghost they went straight to pentecost and received it now the church is inaugurated what are we going to do the first thing comes out the prescriptions got to be made dr simon peter has got to write the first prescription because jesus gave them the keys they give you the keys peter whatsoever you're buying what whatever prescription you write on earth i'll receive it at the drugstore write it and i'll accept it what do they do when all men heard the noise abroad they said what mean is this what did peter say repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what did they do they added father son and holy ghost they went to messing with the prescription you don't have to go out and act like they did god don't do it that way no more this is a prophet's word you don't have to go out and act like they did it don't give you joy and power and speaking in tongues and all those things you don't have to have it just make your confession confessions shake hands and you'll be okay they started messing with the original prescription there's some more poison dope that said that let me get this right he said that's some more poisoned dope of the devil some more poisoned dope of the devil if it made them act like that when they took the medicine it'll make you act like with that if you take the same medicine amen if you'll take a good dose of the holy ghost it'll change your life it'll alter you it'll it'll begin to transform you it'll begin to change your thinking what do you think's a bit is going on in the world that we're living in right now people's thoughts are being altered by a spirit and it's changing their thinking the word they they can't even describe what a woman is no more and they they we're now legalizing all kinds of ungodly things it is something that's changing their thinking and they're calling it freedom amen but it's a spirit that is binding them it's binding them amen and people want to say it this message is binding nothing like the world what the world's doing it's binding them for the burning i agree there is this message is binding people but it's not binding you for burning is binding you for a harvest it's binding us together to get out of here the world is also being bound together but they're being bound together not to get out of here but to burn people want to say they're getting away from here to be free you're getting away to be more bound this is more poisoned dope of the devil if it made them act like that when they took the medicine to make you act the same way it's his prescription if god poured out the holy ghost from the people of pentecost and that was his decision then how the church must operate that how that the church must operate under the power of the holy spirit he cannot change that he cannot turn it over and say well i'll give you a bishop i'll give you this or that he's got to remain to that same decision therefore if the church on the day of pentecost received the baptism of the holy ghost the reaction that came from that baptism of the holy ghost will be the same reaction on every person that ever receives the baptism of the holy ghost mercy jesus maybe i need to read that again because that was a direct quote the reaction that came from the baptism of the holy ghost will be the reaction on every person that's ever received the baptism of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost peter was speaking people who have been had been speaking in tongues and making a noise and speaking in other languages acting like they were drunk men they were questioned about these things and want to know how they could be saved and peter told them to repent and be baptized for the remission of their sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and your children them that are far off the promises to whosoever will let him come god cannot change that it's the word of god it's perfect forever we find out that as the ages go on men come in and pervert the word of god to make it fit a certain tradition now they'll come around and say well there's no need of receiving the holy ghost it's just you come into our fellowship you believe what we believe you believe the message and you got it then meanwhile they're still in pornography and ain't nothing altered ain't nothing changed still living the same life they just got a different idea about how things what's truth he's got some more philosophy to hang on to listen we're interested in more than philosophy here we're interested in the life lebron said i fear we're getting too many people to an idea or a church or something like that but we're not getting them to jesus christ we want to get people to the life amen amen said see god talking about he's talking about solomon this is another place i thought was really good he said solomon god had given a gift to that generation it was a gift of discernment and solomon after received the gift of discernment he was put into action and people came from everywhere to believe him he said what if they had turned that gift down that had been a lost country but they believed it and no matter what solomon done they stayed with it they believed that he was a servant sent from god he said what about the christian church tonight what if the christian church tonight could believe the gift of god sent to them the holy ghost what if they would receive it what if all denominations would rally around the holy spirit what if all the message would rally around the holy spirit around the holy spirit amen as israel rallied around solomon with his gift the holy spirit is the gift is a gift to the church but the church turns it away and shuts it off with their doctrines and their theologies and their man-made creeds we shut christ right out and we don't let the holy spirit come in there's no miracles there's no shouting there's no speaking with tongues there's no praising god we have put it all out direct quote you want it i can send it to you he said if the holy spirit done that in the book of acts it'll do the same thing today because the book of acts is not the acts of the apostles it's the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles it's the same holy spirit that's in the church tonight it will act the same way and it will give the same results why except the substitute why have a substitute when the skies are full of the real pentecostal power listen i don't want a substitute i want the real thing i want god manifested among his people i don't want a substitute of some rosy religion that everything's hunky-dory i don't care if it skins the hide off of me i want god in my life i want god to alter my thinking i don't want to be conformed to this world but i want to be transformed by the power of the living god [Applause] we don't have to have a substitute we can have the real go on the same effect same effect but then found out it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor now let's see this he said i was in a meeting our largest crowd in bombay one of my greatest altar calls whatever number was in durban south africa about 30 30 000 heathens gave their heart to the lord jesus when they seen something miraculous take place on the platform ten thousand muhammadans followed that he said but i noticed something you can take the bushmen you can take the tribesmen you can come in you they come in and doesn't even know what's their right hand or what their left hands many of them don't even hardly wear clothes they don't know one word of english they don't know any but just their tribal language but when they receive the holy spirit they act and do the same things you do when you get the holy spirit it acts the same way just exactly the same it shows that god is a universal god god is omnipresent omniscient omniscient infinite and he works the same with all people so therefore it doesn't matter if you're rich poor if you're white black yellow if you're purple headed you get the holy ghost it'll transform you amen because it just has the same effect it's a certain sound it's it has a certain sound anything different is uncertain anything that says the days of miracles are past that's not the holy ghost anything anything that says that these are there's no more miracles the days of miracles are over that's not the holy ghost anything that says there's something wrong with liberty of worship and the freedom of worship and you you don't need none of that that is not the holy ghost anything that says you don't need the birth the new birth the holy ghost in your life that's not the holy ghost the holy ghost is trying his best to get in every individual he can he just wants an open heart that'll say god here i am i i'm surrender i'm sorry i give it all to you i want you more than anything else my date might make you act crazy to the world but a certain sound does that when noah heard his certain sound it made him act pretty uh foolish started beating together some nails and a butt and some boards together and what in the world you doing noah woke me up earlier this morning he said well i had a visitation he said the lord showed me in a dream to build a certain boat and i've started this morning well no it ain't even seven o'clock in the morning the sun just barely came up he said but it's got to happen and he started getting crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier i heard seen something the other day and said people may thank you me thank you crazy they thought mo i know it was crazy until the rain started coming down amen people listen we are going to become crazier and crazier and crazier to this world amen we're not we're we're so far to the other side of things to where people think we are insane but if i mean if you take one of us back about 100 years we'd probably fit in one of our sisters back 120 years 140 years whatever it was back amen which fit right into what was the normal but it's changed so much to where we are it's not normal what's normal is to be purple-headed or or to have tattoos all over your face and your hands and your legs everywhere have all kinds of things that are manifestations and they're not they're they think well i'm just being me no you're not you're being you're manifesting a spirit no i thought they thought he was crazy but then one day it started raining then one day the flood started coming up all of a sudden brother noah wasn't as crazy as he they thought he was amen and you know what's going to happen one day the fires are going to start burning the bombs are going to start falling and they're going to say you know what those people that preach that message they ain't as crazy as what we thought they were matter of fact they knew a lot of things i wished i would have listened where are they at now i don't know we ain't seen them in a while they're gone [Applause] hallelujah amen you might think i'm crazy you wait till that morning that body changed amen when you wait till that starts happening the dead and christ started arising and appearing as we heard sunday the the appearing are you what you wait till that happen i won't be as crazy then but i tell you who will be crazy this world will go completely insane to where their minds are lost and they see locusts with hair and all kinds of things are taking place because of the torment that's coming upon this world hallelujah but there's a people who's not being conformed to the world they might be thought crazy to the world but to them there's a precious light it's life-giving life he said so it is with the church today that accepts christ and been born of the holy ghost people think those people are crazy some of them say brother branham are you still a baptist said no i'm a pentecostal notice here a what a pentecostal what do you mean i've been born of the spirit of god and received the holy ghost i'm pentecostal oh you don't went off the deep end no i just heard a certain sound where it came from it wrong right out of the pages of the bible just as clear as a bell and when i received it i know what happened i was there i know what took place it changed me from death to life it done something for me he said i know i act crazy to people you act crazy to people too you have received it but we know where we're standing we know what we're talking about it's a real sound just the same kind of sound that came in the bible like a rushing mighty way makes us act the same way it'll make a black man a yellow man a brown man all act the same because it's the same sound the effect it might make you be crazy to the world it might make you act like a drunk man you might get lost into how many has ever been there hey man i know brother lamia's been there i witnessed it coming to a youth meeting they're up in up in oklahoma and and and was desiring the holy ghost and i i'd actually preached that night went and changed clothes come back and he was having a prayer line and the spirit of god was moving i come over to the side door and brother lemuel saw me and he come running out uncle timothy i got to get baptized and i i was like why you need to get baptized i i just i just want the holy ghost i said i'll tell you what you can receive it and then you can get baptized he threw with his arm to lay my hands on and the boy came became instantly drunk for over an hour it'll make you act the same way well i'll tell you what i don't know but well just get a drink of it find out what it'll do to you you know but we're we just come to a real i don't know if anybody's been around but we we come to a real pandemic you know and things are made people act really strange they come out with this vaccine that we don't know yet that works but let me just let me just read one about the smallpox brother branham talks about when people were dying and things were taking place many people died with small plots because there was no toxin but when he said when the epidemic breaks out and and out in the city quickly you could go down and get a smallpox vaccine or a diphtheria shot because it had a toxin in it and he said i'm thankful for that i'm glad of that i'm glad we got it he said i thank the lord for that he said i pray that he'll give us more and more he said i believe if we'll just warm up to god there's things here for us we was made out of the earth you know if we just warm up to him and pray to him and quit our wickedness and things all these things would be found that's right but for you who believe he's got the remedy beyond all of that amen certainly has it's already made and ready for you there was a time when the toxin there wasn't any and many people died from those diseases but now you can be inoculated there was a time when god's bomb wasn't perfect it was because it was drawn out of the veins of an animal he said but it's only and it only covered sin it didn't divorce it but there's no excuse now god one day made a toxin and he gave i'm going to say something he said he didn't try it on a guinea pig he gave it to his own son amen he said he said he gave it to his own son and he inoculated him at jordan with the holy ghost when it came down upon him every boy every eye watched him as he lived amen he lived the life of god he looked like god he acted like god he lived like god he prayed like god he healed like god he raised the dead like god he was god and he was inoculated from the things of the world and they watched him and in his hour of death the inoculation held there's the effect of it the end result if you'll get this holy ghost you'll go through a trial it's not going to keep you from it but when you come on out on the other side you'll still have the holy ghost amen amen you'll go through hard times in your life you might even face death but when you come out on the other side you'll still have that same inoculation that same power of god living in you so when they they knew he was a prophet roman soldier put a rag around his head and close his eyes and took a stick hit him on the head and said now if you be a prophet tell us who hit you and we'll believe you the inoculation held some of you might ought to check your inoculation get another dose get a real dose amen if it ain't holding you when you get hit by words and hit by somebody doing you wrong and somebody wraps you over the head with something and it don't hold you need to go back and say god i need more of that amen he didn't mind the devil he said he said he didn't mind the devil he said i do what the father this is the effect of the inoculation amen he didn't mind the devil neither do you have to mind the devil hallelujah i do what the father shows me i only do what he says proved that the inoculation held when men they reached over and they got a big handful of his beard and they hocked and spit in his faith the inoculation held when his own children cried for his blood the inoculation hell what did he say father forgive them for they know not what they do oh somebody needs some more inoculation i don't know i just can't forgive then you won't be forgiven that's the law of god actually wrote down in his own prayer forgive us as we forgive our debtors so therefore the forgiveness you give is the forgiveness you receive so if you don't want to forgive you're not going to be forgiven that was free but the inoculation if you'll take that it'll go make you put your arm around him or her whoever it was and say i'm sorry i don't want nothing standing but between me and you and god i want to put it under his blood that's the inoculation that's what he did father forgive them that's the effect when he was riled upon he riled not back the inoculation held all hell was looking to see if it would hold he was making a way for you and i making an example and when he died at the cross the inoculation held you know people got really afraid really afraid and i know people died i'm not trying to make light of that my own wife was very sick with it but they got terrified about a virus that had somewhere over a 99 if i understand right survival rate and got terrified wouldn't come out of their house you see them even today riding down the car by themselves with a mask on terrified and it's got a 99 whatever if it's i'll just go lower 90 percent let's just hit that not because i know somebody asking whatever 90 percent survival rate and they're terrified and yet i know a disease is going throughout the land that's got a hundred percent death rate and they don't think nothing about it they lined up for shots inoculations promises given this is going to keep you out of the hospital this is going to keep you from dying and they lined up for it made you have to do it to go travel made you have to do it all these kind of things and i'm not for it and i'm not against it whatever you want to do you do all i'm saying is they lined up for it and they were so proud posting their pictures look what i got and yet they were a 100 death rate of sin and they've never taken that inoculation this world is crazy go completely insane over a 90-something percent survival rate and yet a hundred percent death and they don't think nothing about it but god said i'm going to have an inoculation against it and this thing 10 chance is going to keep you 15 chance is going to keep you 30 chance it'll help you 50 chance it'll keep you 80 percent chance it'll keep you 90 95 this is a hundred percent chance a hundred percent chance that if you take this inoculation it'll get you out of the grave hallelujah it's a hundred percent chance that if you take this inoculation it'll keep you out of the bar room it'll keep you off of those dirty websites it'll keep you out of hell it'll keep you out of the devil's oh grip it'll keep you away from hell hallelujah it is a hundred percent why wouldn't we line up for it why wouldn't we say god i want more of it i want all i can have when he died at the cross the inoculation held on eastern morning it proved it was there death couldn't hold him life and death can't exist in the same place and he rose up from the dead the inoculation held and he sent it on high and amen they wanted and people began to want the same thing they begin to want this same inoculation amen what happens it go on the day of pentecost and right there the mighty russian wind came down and he gave them the same inoculation that he had hallelujah and he still got doses if you wanted tonight and i ain't talking about the dope of the devil that'll take you down to the devil's grave a sinner's girl it's in the center of hell i'm talking about a inoculation that'll keep you from those places it'll keep you on the right road it'll keep you in your time of trouble you may go through some dark times but on the other side you'll still be singing the praises of almighty god these people when they become inoculated they acted funny we found out inoculations have side effects and people lined up for inoculations that some have even died from just saying it is what happened someone's died from them brother brother david mayer he talked about when he had to go get his to be able to travel he had his glands swole way up under his arm had a big old knot out here all kinds of side effects were taking place in people's lives and people were signing up for it this inoculation has side effects too it'll make you stagger it might make you a little woozy for a little bit you might not be able to do numbers sitting over that chair and your hands up in the air and tears streaming down your frays face crying out to god like brother lemuel don't know of where you're sitting don't even care where you're sitting don't care nothing about what's around you all you got now is a direct channel between you and god this this thing does have some side effects amen you know what the side effects are it gets rid of your bitterness it gets rid of your unforgiveness it gets rid of your unholiness it gets rid of your ungodliness it gets rid of sin it gets rid of the devil it gets rid of all those things why wouldn't you sign up for it might not make you act a little funny usually they do when something happens substantially that's a profit usually they do when something happens substantially makes them become funny when they take this shot strange thing of it it was they were all drunk looked like or they thought they were drunk they were dancing and acting like a bunch of drunk people and the people that was wasn't inoculation said wasn't inoculated said ah these men are full of new wine he said listen my catholic friend the virgin mary was in there and if the virgin mary the mother of our lord jesus christ had to go up to pentecost and get so full of the inoculation of god's spirit till she acted like a drunk woman how are you going to get it anything with any way less than that just think that over how are you going to make it no matter what the church you belong to she belonged to a holy church too but she had to get inoculated that the only thing that would raise her up had to come that life had to come in she had to become inoculated and when they got this inoculation they went into the streets and began to act real strange dancing screaming running around people no doubt laughed and said they look like they're having a fit but they were inoculated hallelujah he said i remember one time he was out on the range and he was there in colorado with the hereford organization there and it was brandon some calves and they brought these yearlings up and they'd heat this old brand and iron up surreal hot and they'd put it on the side that calf that calf would let loose and have a fit and you'd let him go after he got burned he would had a running fit he'd begin to scream and holler and carry on he said but brother he was yours he was branded it hurt him a little bit but he knowed where he belonged after that he said this holy ghost might hurt your pride it might burn a little your egg ecclesiastical fur off but you know where you belong to from then on because you've been branded by the holy ghost there's something that has happened to you they began to speak with other tongues these men said now what menace all this with him speak in her own tongues and after a little while this little boy little man got up and he stood on this soapbox and he began to preach and he began to speak of this of the prophet joel and he said this is that and he preached to him they said well where can we get some of this inoculation where can we get it this serum had been just poured out and dr simon peter said you can have it too i'll write the prescription repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall be inoculated and besides that i'm going to make this a lifelong prescription it'll hold all your life hallelujah amen but it's a prescription that cannot be full with nobody else can try to write it any other way it has to be wrote the same way if a doctor goes and writes a prescription a real good doctor he knows how much certain things need to be there but another one comes in and upsets it some quack druggest starts adding this or taking this away it might kill the patient and that's exactly what's happened quack preachers have gotten a pulpit and they've taken this out and they've added this to it and it's messed it all up go back to what he said repent and be baptized and ye shall receive the holy ghost it's the same light and it'll have the same effect and it'll have the same result it's god's prescription there is a bomb in gilead there is a great physician don't fool with the prescription shake somebody's hand and take them to philip no that don't that don't take no repentance sprinkle somebody with a little shaker full of salt nope it they don't take the place of water baptism quit fooling with the prescription the physician is here he said the doctors hear the holy spirit he's the one who wrote it and they used it and it held and it held and it held and it'll still hold every time it's the same light it's the same life it's the same jesus it's the same yesterday today and forever therefore it has to have the same effects it has to have the same effects it has to be the same or it ain't the same light might be an artificial light it might look like light might light up a real dark place for a while but it'll go out but that sun it'll shine on and on and the s-o-n it'll shine on and on and when men's creeds die off that sun will still be shining when men's ideas die away many times it does with their when they die but that sun will still be shining because he rose again hallelujah he said what we need is men and women today they can shut the mouth of the world by the signs of the holy ghost we need to turn it upside down and shaken out a lot of the world and things out of the church that come in these last days he says there's got a lot of a lot of compromising going on compromising with scriptures he said the blood doesn't run in a genu that blood doesn't run in a genuine holy ghost man or woman of god all devils in hell can't upset him on that word he'll stand on it and regardless of what comes nothing present future anything the real genuine birth of the holy spirit comes in that man he'll stand there it'll hold it'll hold amen some of you the devil's been after you this way you need to look at that devil and say hey i'm still here and it's not by my mind it is not by my power it's by his spirit saith the lord it'll hold it has the same it has the same effects we heard already god doesn't have grandchildren he just has sons and daughters so you've got to do the same thing they did on the day of pentecost you've got to have the same experience you've got to have the same thing they had god don't ever change his program he never changes his ways he just the same does the same all the time the way he lays it down at the beginning it'll tow each time it's got to be the same and if you do the same thing the same results will come the same results will come the toxin will hold it'll keep you from death there's a plague of death going throughout the land you better get the toxin against it there's a plague of death and people are dying falling off falling into a bottomless pit because they refused the toxin the inoculation i wouldn't refuse it tonight this is one you don't want to refuse you can refuse to covet shot if you want you can refuse to give your kids vaccine whatever but don't refuse this he said well what if it makes me act like that so be it as long as i got it i don't care how it makes me act i just want it if i need it in both arms i'll take it in both arms i want him more than anything and i want it to affect my life and have the effect that it had for them the effect is if you go by the grave it'll take you out of there that's the end result or if you don't go by the grave it'll change your body to be like his glorious body say lord i want to i want to witness that effect in my life let's buy our heads you stand to your feet musicians come it's the same doctor finds a remedy for disease he writes out a prescription some quack drug is gets a hold of it adds little this a little that he'll either kill the patient or or hurt him somehow the prescription doesn't even have enough medicine in it to do it any good anymore it's so weak it won't help the patient see that's what's the matter with a lot of these seminary druggists today they've taken the prescription out add a little bit of this and you know you got now is a bunch of dying morgues the prescription still remains the same when the samaritans received it they got inoculated the same thing when the gentiles receive it the same thing paul met a bunch in acts 19 the same thing what's the matter today there's plenty of bomb in gilead and we've got plenty of physicians but the people are afraid of the prescription he says is there no bomb in gilead is there no power of the holy spirit there is the inoculation works on all it did on all jews it did on all samaria samaritans it did on all gentiles it does on everybody the same way and it'll do it on you the same way he's here tonight will you take the inoculation one of me just to be honest before god said lord i want a real dose real dose of that holy ghost yes lord oh yes uh you know this altar is always open for you to pray and call it out to god whatever you do get
