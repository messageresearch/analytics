not a paid camper but i want to stay and an adult here that's driving in or something you want to stay and have a meal with us well you just pay inside the cafeteria at a table by the door um we just collect and pass on back to the camp what you know that they request and that's nine dollars uh but if you're registered here you've already paid your account there's no charge to your meals your meals are included already now woods yeah we have every known species of poisonous snakes in louisiana and i am not joking we have the coral the copperhead we have the rattlesnakes we have um the watermoxkins we got we got we got all of them and different different varieties of them and um so you know this time of the year they're waking up so you know we really uh don't want you going out in the woods by yourself and boys there are some nice little ponds here i want to tell you about these ponds have got nice little green frogs in them and they jump in there and whatever and you can grab them and play with them but they're sewer ponds and sewer frogs and sewer hands so stay away from the ponds now you met your sweetie here you knew they were coming i don't want you pairing off i don't want you walking away and you two going out for a stroll through the woods can't do that woods are off limits there are limits for all of us we're going to stay in this area we have the basketball we have the baseball field we have the volleyball field we have different activities we're going to be having skits we're going to have you know special services we're going to have just wonderful times together together and i don't want you going off by yourself out there on your own hike and especially boy and girl going out there alone we can't have it we have to do everything in decency and in order right so keep that in mind and you won't get in trouble we do have a good gator patrol here and gator's got big teeth and um so you know they will be uh checking and and uh making sure that everything continues in order now um like i said we after the services we're going to give you a chance to go the snack shack the hours of course is two o'clock in the afternoon but after service he usually opened the snack shack for those of you that miss the meal or you're still hungry or you want a snack for bed well this snack shack is open and um and so you know after you you know we'll we'll be giving you a little opportunity to to get some things or fellowship or whatever and then we'll be announcing time to go to the dorms we also are going to request that you stay in your dorms

going to get where you can get up you know and uh prepare for the service and and get ready um for for the for the spirit of the lord to move in in the service and um so you know so we got we got all of those things i think about got them uh about got them covered some people will ask about the services well we put them online conveniently for you to download and use and and we will have them for

so they will be available as soon as we can put them on our website eveninglight.net or on youtube or some of the other perhaps facebook some of the other places that we will have i wanted to mention just one thing more about your your sweetie i know you're supposed to love one another right well but when you got a girlfriend or boyfriend you may do whatever at your church but we feel like you know here it's kind of good to follow the scripture rules it's good for a man not to touch another so you know why don't you just um instead of holding hands you can get a stick and walk together you know all the way around the campground and you eat someone holding the stick but um unless you got a rock on your finger don't be don't be pairing off and holding hands with your sweetie you know um we're going to just leave that with your pastor and whatever you all do in your church i'm not going to even argue with that but right here at this campground you'll go by our rules and uh and so if you don't have any if you don't have any um uh rules that maybe at your church for this or that we're gonna loan you hours while you're here so we'll have a good time together and we're going to have a great camp together and the spirit of god's going to move amen and god's going to meet your needs amen because he's a living god and he's for you and he loves you and he cares for you and he's going

conqueror they gave him four months to live and he's still here but they were trying to put a time limit on you and you're still here you're not defeated yet amen you're here to overcome we have here also brother andrew spencer that's going to be ministering also god bless you brother andrew amen 1988 for our second youth camp we had a young preacher come for that meeting he wasn't well known at that time his name was donny reagan but he came and ministered in that meeting for us we had just got acquainted the year before and i invited him to the spring camp for that year but the daniel williams and i agreed to have him there for the camp and the holy spirit moved in such a way it was such a dynamic moving of the holy spirit there was there was victory in the camp there was more than victory as far as just jumping shout there were lives that were changed completely totally filled with the holy ghost [Music] people say today want to say well louisiana camp's not the same it is we still have the same god we still have the same outpouring of the holy spirit and he still uses the men of god that he used back then and i'm pleased tonight to invite brother donnie reagan to come and minister to you [Music] we all have our troubles we all have our trials we press through them these ministers are not men who who just are not acquainted with troubles they're acquainted with troubles just like you are and i want you to know your problem is not too big for my jesus your depression has to bow to the name of my jesus the suicide spirits that try to get a hold of your young people and destroy your life it's not too big a devil for my jesus there is not a problem that he can't handle there's not a sickness he can't heal there's not a miracle that he can't bring he's that kind of god to meet your need and i want you to believe in him tonight with all your heart and call on the name of the lord so that you can have your deliverance and walk in freedom let's stand together let's sing this song he is here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] holy [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's a person of god [Music] amen [Applause] [Music] that's what i believe for you you're gonna leave this camp different the problems you brought amen when you come to the red sea remember the egyptians that you that that have tormented you the devils that have bothered you you're gonna see them no more we're not going away the way we came we're going to go away with a greater victory a greater patience and greater promising taking our land taking our heroes he is here he is here to lead you into deliverance the partial deliveries so let's worship the lord again and sing it with your heart he is here [Music] me [Music] well i guess that means the devil's mad one of the wonderful things that'll be missing in heaven microphones amen we're so so happy to be gathered together here tonight post post-covered post troubles post heartaches we were saved before kovac came we're still saved after covet is gone no matter what satan throws at us we are more than conquerors it's such an honor to be able to to be with you i wanted to say before we read how much i appreciate brother tim and his church and all the workers that makes this possible for all these many many years that they've done this i want to be standing near one day when my little buddy walks up before the throne of god and the lord goes to reward him and no doubt many of you will stand right there and say i got the holy ghost i was saved i was delivered thank you about tim we appreciate all the efforts and all of that to make it possible god bless you listen tonight if you would to the book of ephesians chapter 6 verse 13. i know you're tired many of you driven today flew in today you're tired and worn so i'll keep that in mind as we start for the service tonight but we know that we'll never ever be gathered quite like this again even if the lord tarries another year and there'd be another spring camp probably some of you would not be able to be here maybe myself brother tim brother ron we don't know so we want to take advantage of this time every moment that we're together and see what the lord will do this is a very um famous portion of scripture as far as in the book of ephesians it's called the panoply of god which basically means dealing with the armor of god but i think it's very fitting for the day that we're living wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore and this is how we will do it having your loins gird about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god now i'd also like to read to you from satan's eden paragraph 13. i love the way that brother branham approached this he's had a few meetings there in jeffersonville and he says i wanted to speak to you something to bring something to you to enlighten you to the promise of god for this age something not something that somebody else was and some other day them things are all right and we all refer to those things but i thought i would try to bring something to your mind in these scriptures that i've got written down that would enlighten you to know and to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything that gets to you see that's the main thing he said if you get time sometime do a search on that how many times that he said that that's the main thing a lot of the things that we think are the main thing are not the main thing at all but this is what he said is one of the main things that that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can so the main thing is to be able to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can now remember brother branham when he was younger he was a boxer now most of us of course have not boxed too much but for him saying this would have had such a powerful meaning because the more punches you take the weaker you are the more punches you do the more you surrender that secrecy about yourself and your enemy watches you and he learns your tactics so you're sparring he's learning you're fighting he's learning so the main thing is keeping it all we thank god for the blood of jesus that forgives us when we do wrong don't we but i appreciate the holy ghost that can so live in our lives that can keep us from doing wrong in the first place now the majority of christendom that's where they live in this age we're living so it's constantly about repentance their songs are constantly written about the mercy of god the grace of god which basically they have no power to help them overcome the world so they're constantly thinking for the blood the blood does this that's what the blood's for they say it's to god knows you're going to make mistakes and you're going to live awful so they say so the blood's there to forgive you so you just basically go ahead and do it that's not what the lord jesus died for he died to redeem us from the power of the devil amen and we'd like to be remembered tonight as we pray god bless you let's bow our heads together heavenly father it's such an honor to be able to stand here lord and address these young men and young women lord some their parents and grandparents also here lord not only those in the visible audience but those that are invisible different time zones around the world that are streaming tonight and some that will archive this service father we just come before you with humility in our hearts and asking you to help us we're so needy lord in this hour that we live but we're grateful that all of our needs we can bring them to you and you're mindful of us i pray for a few moments here this evening lord that you would be able to capture our attention you see for many of them lord they're tired in their bodies and they're just settling into a place that's not their own home and not their own bed and all of that but would you help us while we're here these few days may we hear from across the river may eternity speak to us lord dear god we know if there's anything that's accomplished out of these meetings that'll be of eternal value it'll be you that'll do it no doubt brother ron has studied and prayed brother ander has studied and prayed i've done likewise brother tim lord has prayed and prayed in his church but father we know without you coming supernaturally it'll just be a protractive gathering we don't want that lord but we want lives to be changed delivered set free speak to us tonight father we pray in the name of the lord jesus and the saints said god bless you you may be i'd like to speak to you tonight for just a little bit on standing in the evil day i could imagine that brother random would have had so many things that he had the ability the understanding the revelation to be able to bring to his people here he's in branham tabernacle he felt more liberty to preach there than pretty much anywhere else in the world no doubt he could have spoke on some great mysteries some great things that had so much depth and would have brought such exhilarating feeling to our emotions and we would have thought wow that was so profound but yet his desire was to be able to bring something that would enlighten not only the branham tabernacle but those of us that never even got to meet brother branham and see him and yet we are the trophies of his message as well as they were but something that would enlighten us to the hour that we're living in now we know that whenever the prophet was here there was great darkness on the earth but in reality it was nothing compared to what it is today and for sure he said even then that the world was groping in insanity what would he say about it today when people don't know if they're a man or a woman or a dog or a cat or a horse they're not even sure really what they even are they're not sure what they even want to be and we know that that darkness is so permeating over the entire earth and we can see that the handwriting is certainly on the wall and if he was here today i wonder what would be the burden on his heart if he could stand here before you tonight and be able to speak something to you would it be rallying words that would just help us to get excited for a few days would it be something that he would point us to a system would he point us to some doctrine as even some message people would do and they think the message is all about this doctrine and that doctrine and another doctrine but i'm so glad who i'm looking for is not a doctrine he's a person it was not a doctrine young people that died for you it was not a doctrine that raised from the dead it was a person it is not a doctrine that we're looking for to come and change our bodies but it is a person as much as we thank god for the teachings and the doctrines of the message yet if satan cannot stop us from embracing those truths he will try to get us to emphasize that instead of the very literal life of the lord jesus himself but i'm glad that over the years that we've been able to be a part of this camp and the years that i wasn't here was able to get a bus and send our young people here because i feel like that what is going to be said and what is going to be preached is going to be an emphasis that the lord jesus would be happy with and not only that but that there will be lives that will be changed and it will not be so much that it will be trophies for brother ron trophies for brother tim trophies for brother andrew but trophies for the lord jesus himself and as we are in this darkened age and may i say to those of you that are serving the lord that no doubt you are facing things that no other generation of young people ever had to face the darkness that is keep continually coming out upon the face of the earth even though we're walking in the greatest light that's ever been we cannot keep from being affected by the darkness that is here the prophet told us when he was here that the lid had been tore off of the kettle and demon powers were streaming in every direction now if that was 1961-62 can you imagine what it is in the day that we're living now and we're not here tonight to give the devil praise we're not here tonight to tell what a mighty mighty devil that he is but i do want you to recognize that we do uh are are against a powerful adversary and we are also more equipped than the army of hell is equipped but that is only as we find our position in the word and we realize what what god has done for us and we know that our position is more than just quoting quotes and we can have all the memorabilia of the message of the hour we can know many of the great events where brother branham was sharing a certain day brother branham was there on a certain day and all that is good but yet really what i want to emphasize to you tonight is not just where brother branham was on a certain day but where were you when life struck you because it's not going to be us just recognizing who brother branham was as a matter of fact brother brennam tells us one day the bride will recognize who she is and when she recognizes who she is the rapture will go not the rapture will come but the rapture will go when she recognizes who she is so it's not it's not great enough for you to be able to say oh i've got a wonderful mama i've got a wonderful father my pastor is such a wonderful man that's wonderful i'm glad that you have that kind of parents and that kind of a pastor but that will not give you the overcoming power that you need to face the darkness in this day you have got to be able to know that you have met the god of your mother the god of your father the god of william branham we don't want to just say well where is the god of brother branham we want to be able to say i know where he is he's here in my heart he's in my church he's in the message of the hour he's here in this meeting do we believe that with all of our hearts we believe he is the same yesterday today and forever for real believers that is not just a cliche that we say around the message of that well he's the same yesterday today and forever we really believe that he is the same and i really want to inform hell tonight that they are coming against the greatest generation of young people that have ever been on the face of the earth we're not just a second-handed generation of people well my grandfather was in the message or my grandmother or my mother or my father no that's not our credentials our credentials are we have met the lord jesus christ ourself is that right now you know the enemy that we are faced with there's certainly one that we would not want to meet on our own i would not want to meet this enemy on my own he was so defiant against the lord jesus that he just came right up against him and questioned who he was and we must remember that we have a strong adversary that is by no means saying that we acknowledge him as being some great something and we are weaklings but yet peter says it this way in first peter chapter 5 verse 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour now you know peter was a man that i really really like in the bible because he's one of the few new testament characters that were able to see growth in his life we see him fall flat on his face and get right back up again by the grace of god so who better than peter to write about this now paul we don't know so much about his walk but yet peter were able to see that peter was able to be a man that had a lot of pride about himself and an element of arrogance about himself and he felt like that he was so secure in the kingdom of god and he felt like that if john backslid and turn away from jesus peter would never do it and he had such confidence but his confidence was not in the reality of god it was in the strength of his own flesh those others will turn you away lord i will not do it and it must have been very very hard for him to accept what the lord jesus said that you will deny me is that right now i want you to notice that the lord jesus tried to warn peter several times and tell him that satan was out to get him but you see the danger of having spiritual pride and spiritual arrogance is that we tend to look at ourselves and think well the devil will never get me well so-and-so is caught up in porn but it'll never happen to me so-and-so is caught up in this and that but it'll never happen to me we need to hide behind the mercy and the strength of our god not confidence in our flesh for if a man thinks that he stand let him take heed lest he fall now you know i find this myself and i'm sure our brothers could agree that there's so too many christians that are around this message that have gone to sleep they've entered into a slumber of the last days and they're taking confidence in what they think they can do and they're not really listening to their pastors as their pastors are trying to warn them of the darkness that's pressing against us and yet we know that as we go on it's going to get worse listen to this in matthew 26 40 when he cometh unto the disciples and find them asleep and he says unto peter what could you not watch with me one hour just one hour listen to these words watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak once again the lord jesus warns peter and he lets him know that the spirit may be indeed willing but his flesh was still very weak now the pewter whenever peter when it goes back to this and he remembers no doubt this very night relived it many many times i'm sure in his life and peter sought to write in his epistle what could i say to the people that are in this day and the people that will read this what can i say to them that i would be able to give them something that would help them and peter chose to use the word sober and he chose the word vigilant and he could have described the devil by many many terms but he chose to describe him as a roaring lion not as a sitting lion or a sleeping lion or even as a crouching lion now notice he said as a roaring lion notice peter says be sober be vigilant the word sober is to watch to be calm collected in spirit to be temperant to govern both the outward and the inward man by rules of temperance modesty and mortification cares will intoxicate the soul therefore be sober now many of you have never drunk any alcohol in your life you've never drunk any wine or any any type of spirits as the world calls it but yet you know there's so many more things by which we can become intoxicated than it would just be wine or alcohol but we can just get so busy with the sayings of life themselves now peter was not drinking it wasn't that peter had truthful girlfriends on the side and peter was kind of running the bars you know and he was smoking and doing all that sort of thing but peter just got so caught up and no doubt he felt like that he himself was really established upon the truths of what he believed the gospel was and he felt like if everybody forsook the lord jesus there's no way he's going anywhere and i just can't believe that peter actually took the words of the lord jesus when he said peter before the croc crows you will deny you even know me now if peter would have believed that i believe the man would have fell on his feet and repented and say please strengthen me please help me help me that i won't do this but it was as if though he was so arrogant in himself that the words of the lord jesus did not even penetrate his soul and shake him to such a spot that he would say lord please help me that i don't do this give me strength and i don't do it you know you think about life whenever a lot i was given the decision to choose which way would go to the left to the right abraham said whichever way you go i'll go the opposite way if lot would have known who abraham was you think of being the prophet of that age they would have come back and said help me guide me lead me i i don't know what to do i don't know which way to go that it's apparent that lot had so much confidence in the leadership of his own mind's own walk maybe the influence of his wife because she had this worldly desire he didn't even inquire from the prophet what should i do help me to know i don't know i mean there's evil there there's evil there you direct me you guide me all young people how many have we seen that have had such confidence in themselves and then they they tend to become to a spot to where they're not as peter said that they are sober now the next word that he uses is vigilance and it means to watch and wait oh so wonder why he's using these words watch and be awake watch and be awake these are the very words the lord jesus spoke to him but did peter do it he did not this is one thing i love about the grace of god all these preachers up here and how many evermore's out here and how many ever stream in this service every one of them is preaching to you about the mercy of god you know one reason they can preach it with such passion they've experienced it you know why they can preach to you god can forgive you because god's forgiven them is that right i wouldn't give you a nickel for a preacher that preaches so high and he acts like that he ain't never needed no forgiveness he's a hypocrite that's exactly right there won't be one preacher that will ever walk down the streets of gold that did not need the mercy of god the salvation of god sanctification forgiveness is that right that's why they can stand up and tell you that god is mindful of your needs i'm sure as we've gathered here tonight there's young people that maybe not even say there are some of you that are saved and you're not sanctified there's somebody that are saved and sanctified not filled with the holy ghost and there's probably some that are saved sanctified filled with the holy ghost but maybe you're fighting depression or sadness or whatever it is we've got people with all walks of life but i believe our god is so mindful of every one of your needs that from the very back back road to the very front row all the way across the whole front i believe our god can lead these men and direct these men to preach exactly what you have need of in these days that we are here and we don't want it to be a protracted meeting but we want it to be a meeting where devils are cast out and the sick are healed and tumors will lead people's bodies hallelujah and the shackles will fall off of people's lives and those that are bound will say praise god i'm true why because we are watching and we are vigilant and we say we need to be stirred in this hour we need more holy ghosts than we've ever had in our life we need more the love of god we need the power of god we need the word of god is that right why because we are facing a deadly enemy but we want to let him know tonight we are more than conquerors we are not leia to sin survivors we are overcomers [Applause] so this man when he wants to write to young people to preachers to older people he wants to tell watch stay awake why because he hadn't done so good at it to be cautious to take heed this is the meaning of the word vigilant lest through remission and carelessness some destructive calamity would overtake you be self-controlled now we realize this is what the majority of christendom lacks brother branham uses a very simple illustration about salvation something like this you go out in the barnyard and there's a glass laying out there it's got cow manure on it straw hay it's filthy nasty there's no way you're gonna pick that up and drink out of it so you reach down and when you do you pick it up now you have taken the filth of this upon yourself this is why he had to become a man god in spirit form could not take our sin upon himself so god became a man is that right now whenever he did this he reached down and he took our sin upon himself but did he save me he saved me from the barnyard but i'm still not full of anything yet full of myself full of arrogance full of stench full of all that sort of thing now this is where the majority of christendom is they profess him as their savior all glory i'm saved thank god i'm saved are they they are they're saved from the barnyard they're same from the you know the things that are out there but are they in service they're not but you know if you really want to use that you take that glass in the house and you go to run in some warm water and you'll put dishwashing soap inside of there and you'll suds it up and you'll stick it down in there and wash it depending on how picky you are you may rush it once and then twice and then three times why because you do not want to put anything in that glass and press that glass to your lips until that glass has been washed and sanctified and filled all young people may i say to you tonight you don't want to just be picked up out of the barnyard and say oh hallelujah the lord saved me oh hallelujah i'm different than what i was is the glass different it is different but that's not the end destiny of what god wants for that glass you bring it in you wash it really good and then you set it up on the counter there it is it's justified it's sanctified but unlike that gatorade bottle it is still empty oh my let's not leave this place may there not be a one that'll leave this place on sunday that'll say i'm an empty vessel may there not be a one young person or middle-aged person that'll pull out of this parking lot that won't be so full of the baptism of the holy ghost that every fiber of your being is this is what makes it so sad that many are washed and they're even cleaned and they're setting there and they're empty they never go any farther they never move beyond and they're just oh i thank you lord oh i used to drink but i don't drink no more i used to cuss but i don't cuss no more i used to do this better don't do that no more and they're still just thanking god that they come out of the barnyard and they're thanking god that they've been baptized and they've been washed but they're not in service so they're just sitting there praise the lord praise the lord oh hallelujah i'm so clean i feel so clean i feel so good to be clean ain't it good to be clean this is why we needed a profit in this day to be a help to restore us back to the true apostolic face of our fathers they didn't just preach justification and sanctification they preached the baptism of the holy ghost and a message preacher that ain't preaching that i ain't preaching the message well praise the lord not only the baptism of the holy ghost but the baptism of the holy ghost with the same sensation the same emotion living the same kind of life the prophet said it right here in the state of louisiana that the second adam's children have only got one way to act and that is like they did on the day of pentecost and if we're born i know a lot of our folks don't want emotion anymore i'll tell you the reason some preachers don't preach for emotion because they've not had a real experience themselves they've accepted an intellectual conception of the message but that'll never back up the devil in your life that'll never keep all the sins of sin and the power of darkness that's on the face of the earth today we will not be able to back the devil up just by quoting quotes i'm telling him brother branham said this and brother branham said that the devil cannot quote every one of us the devil can quote the bible better than every one of us but there's one thing we can do we can live right we have the power of god and our soul the devil cannot live this word he cannot have the life of christ now i'll tell you one thing i appreciate i really appreciate this container can you imagine me now i'm getting hot and sweating and i'm going to be thirsty shortly can you imagine me trying to get this gatorade in me without a vessel so if it was just here it was all laying on the floor and it was laying on the pulpit how am i going to get it am i going to do like a dog go around and laugh it up with my tongue how i appreciate a vessel young people this is what god wants you to be right here a vessel oh glory to god a vessel so full of the holy ghost that when you get up on monday morning the devil says oh no here they come again oh no here they come again hallelujah not you getting up on monday morning say no no not monday again i'll tell you what the prophet said he said a man or woman could live so close to god that the devil don't know what to do with you we ought to be young people in this message that when we get up out of the bed the devil says oh no there's that young man there's that young woman there's that preacher that's that deacon walk out hell here they come here they come they're not compromising they're not just talkers they're possessions [Applause] so what do you do you take that glass and you set it there you fill it with milk orange juice water tea whatever it is now you identified yourself with it hallelujah you identified yourself with it when you picked it up the first time now it's identifying itself with you when you press it to your lips [Music] is it possible that that filthy dirty thing could minister drink to the lord jesus hallelujah is it possible that the lord could so feel you god don't want just preachers to talking about this he wants you young people set on fire hallelujah he wants you young people so filled with the power of god that people will notice something about your life not just your hair sisters not just your dress not just your brothers don't look like women and all that sort of thing but the life of christ so permeating out of your life that people say there's something about that young boy there's something about that girl what is it it ain't the bottle it ain't the vessel it's the contents it's the conscious that's what it is that's what makes us different oh but our adversary the greek word here calls him diablos the slanderer the slander peter said his as a roaring lion lion walking about seeking whom he may devour not a sweeping line as i said not a couching lion several years ago i was in kenya going to the serengeti park a brother there in the message was a game warden and i was able to go in places to where the normal tourist was not able to go and see and as we were driving out in the serengeti on a jeep and i saw this big female lioness up on an abandoned anthill maybe maybe this tall something like that and she was so conspicuous you could see her she just stuck out of the sore sum as we would say so i asked the brother i said why why is she doing that and he said she's a decoy now there were gems about there was all kinds of animals out there everywhere saying that if you look really close in the bush you'll find the hunters so we had binoculars and we started looking in there we looked and we looked and the grass there is almost identical same color of the lions and there we finally found them and they were sneaking up but yet all of those animals hundreds of them they were not looking in the bush you know where they were looking at that one decoy so they have their eyes listen young people satan will not hit you in your strengths he will hit you in your weaknesses oh come on now don't get quiet on me what what strengths in your life he will not hit you so much there but every one of us has weaknesses inside of our flesh and that's what we've got to fortify by the grace of god your weakness might be not been able to cope and deal with people laughing that you're making fun of you and satan will deal with you that way you're some of you others your weakness may be one thing or another but we need the grace of god to help us strengthen those weaknesses because satan will put a decoy in front of us and we'll get our eyes on that decoded coin not knowing the real enemy is right here and your greatest enemies not your mama your greatest enemies not your daddy but your greatest enemy is yourself now that's very difficult because there ain't nobody i love in this world any better than me oh i just love me don't sit down and look at me like i'm a weirdo you do too i ain't nobody you love no matter who did you feed today your mama or yourself who did you get ready for church your sister or yourself satan don't put the whole you better oh you better watch oh oh my oh my but your enemies actually over here as i sat there and i watched and i watched and i pondered and i thought about brother ron how the enemy actually does you know and whenever naturalists tell us that whenever the lion is roaring that is when he is the most hungry i i hope that you can see tonight that every individual here including me satan looks at us as potential supper what do you think he'd rather have in his trophy room one of these men of god or some denominational guy that don't really know nothing about god which do you think he'd rather have some of these denominational young people that all they've ever known is denomination there's a denomination that or some of you that's been raised in the message of the hour oh you said well that's my protection no it's not your protection has not been raised in a message pew but it's that baptism of the holy ghost don't take that pride oh i i'll never do this i'll never do that there's only one way you won't do it the power of the holy ghost inside of you [Applause] in 1898 england which is in control of kenya wanted to build a railway so they send an engineer they hire many locals and bring also other people from england to come and to construct this railway they start missing employees they first they're bewildered by it and they start finding blood trails and in the middle of the night hearing people scream and holler come to find out it was two lions lions from savo one was called ghost and the other one was called darkness these lions were man-eaters a minimum of 35 that they know of and they say possibly up to 135 that they killed they had no appetite for the gyms but impala normal lion food but they had an appetite for people and they killed one after another after another they finally found their den and when they did they found the skulls and the bones of one human being after another after another well i'm going to tell you tonight our enemy is even worse than the lions of savo they're in the museum in chicago to this very day it's been a mystery for all of these years why that they actually did what they did but let me tell you young people your enemy tonight is even more cunning even more of a challenge for you and i than the savo lines were they finally were able to take them both and there they are in the museum the most famous and infamous animals in all the natural history museum i actually have a mountain lion myself that come from the same area of saavo those lines are very peculiar in that they did not have a mane they were massive in size and the one i have is massive as well but it doesn't hardly have any mane so i found a mane on ebay and i bought him a toupee but he's sort of like the devil he ain't really got no hair but he looks like he does now unless you knew it you know unless you was there in my house should never even know so sometimes people will come and want to look at it and while they're saying oh wow how beautiful wow he's really big he's this and that and i just reach over and grab this whole thing off of him and there he is bald as a pumpkin why because it's something about their dna they found out in that area that it does not produce a mane you know i think for a real child of god if we really know what satan is and what our lord is he might roar and he might terrify you in your flesh but if you have got the baptism of the holy ghost you're able to remove his toupee and say peter said you was as a roaring lion he didn't say you were one hallelujah hallelujah but i'll tell you the line that i love it's the lion of the tribe of judah that's the lion that is the conqueror and satan is nothing but an impersonator he wants to act like he's the almighty but he's not the almighty he is a devil he is a thief he is a liar and he is defeated by the power of the holy ghost hallelujah look at yourself tonight you're a walking ham sandwich you're a walking t-bone steak you're a walking pork chop dinner or a big chicken dinner the devil looks at you as food but aren't you glad that if he does just get a portion of us in his mouth we'll turn his stomach you are undefeatable you cannot be defeated as long as you are in christ jesus there is no enemy young people that can defeat you oh brother donna you don't know this and no i don't but i know a mighty god that's bigger than everything you're facing tonight you don't know what i come here with you're right i don't but i know my father knows what you're facing i know what you're going to face i don't have an idea what you're going to face when you go back home but i want to bring to you a message about the power of the holy ghost that when you leave out of here on sunday evening if you've got to face a trial or a test you can say by the grace of god out of my way you lying devil out of my way you lying devil you're not gonna stop me i was in the barnyard but i ain't no more i was in the dishwater but i ain't no more now i've got the water on the inside of me i'm full of that water you know satan tempts in three forms as the subtle serpent to our senses pervert our judgment and enchant our imagination the form of the serpent is the way it came to our mother in the garden of eden to enchant her to lead her by the power of imagination to beguile her senses the serpent beguiled me oh my and to pervert our judgment well you can get by with this my you've been hearing the lord's coming all these years well who knows it may be a hundred years it may be but can any of you show me the divine guarantee that you'll live till the end of the service for generations nuclear war nuclear fear has not really been on the average common mind but look in the last month and a half we're hearing more about nuclear this and nuclear that my it has been in decades i spoke to my church the other night and told them that i just found where russia had been working on a stealth bomber they call the name of that bomber the messenger the messenger america turned down god's messenger but they won't be able to turn down russia's messenger look young people there's only one place that we can hide oh you know i'm sure that you you've read about it already and heard bomb shelters have went through the roof in the last month people ordering them online having them buried in their backyard put here and there and there but aren't you glad you've got one made out of feathers [Applause] that's what the prophet said we've got a bomb shelter made out of feathers i don't want a concrete one i don't want a steel one or a titanium one i've got one that's called my father's wings for before one of them bombs every land this way hallelujah the bride will be sailing off into the presence of god you understand friend how close we are those warheads when they start this way our nation only has a quantity of 40 deterrents by which they can stop them and if russia starts sending hundreds of those and those warheads moving 15 000 miles an hour that plane will fire so fast it can be from moscow to any place on the earth in less than 30 minutes people won't have time to get right they won't have time to fix this and that now is your time tonight is your time in the morning tomorrow night now is your time this is the day of your visitation accept your hour accept your time if you're on the barnyard the master is here to pick you up if you're filthy he's here to wash you if you're empty he's here to fill you so when you leave out of here you can leave a full vessel full of the holy ghost and say lord what do you want me to do oh he reveals himself and tempts us as a serpent but also as an angel of light to deceive us try to deceive us with false views of spiritual things and to redefine the declarations of god's word whether it's on holiness and sanctity or even the holy ghost and what's so sad is that we're dealing in our own ranks with preachers preaching a watered-down version of the holy ghost all you've got to do is believe god sent a prophet well if that's so every devil in hell will be saved there are no devils that follow the move but believe the sign because they know better they talk people into believing he wasn't a prophet but they know better so the angel of life will try to deceive people with false views of the truth or restructure the truth in such a way that it is more appealing and easy believism if you will and then as a roaring mind to tear us down destroy with violent opposition and y'all ever seen an african lion out in the wild i ain't talking about the cincinnati zoo now one brother back here a few brother here well i i don't mind telling you i've seen him in the zoo but they're like kitty cats compared to the ones that you see in the wild several years ago my wife and i was in south africa and the brothers there wanted to treat us to a really nice nice place to stay so they got us a place out and there was a dark whenever we got there and it was a very neat place but yet about three in the morning something like that we heard something and i'm not sure who moved the fastest me or my wife she was moving toward me and i was moving toward her we didn't know that we were staying right next door to a game reserve and right outside of our window was a fence about 15 feet tall something like that but we didn't know that because we came in in the dark all we knew we were hamming eggs for breakfast the next morning the baboons woke us up on the roof well whenever we finally got up and stirred around a little bit and saw that fence it made me feel somewhat better until three in that morning come to find out the king like that resort so he was camping out real close to our room so needless to say it took a little bit of the fun out of us watching the empower and all the rest of the things that was there because every morning we were being awakened by this now many of you from the signs of your hands you've never seen or heard you're saying quite like that but let me tell you you've heard worse because you have heard this impostor out of hell as he roars i'm going to get you i'm going to get you i'm going to destroy you i'm going to do this to you and i'm going to do that to you and his roar is so ferocious and so terrifying but if you could only look in his mouth and realize he ain't got no teeth to bite you he goes because the lord jesus doesn't pull his teeth on calvary [Applause] glory to god remember he's got a bow but he ain't got no arrows so he'll roar and roll and roll and can you imagine you run up on this line and then he opens his mouth and you're second you've got to be kidding me i was scared of that oh grandpa where's your polygrip oh brother sister if we knew who we were and can look at it in the right way when that devil comes roaring i'm going to kill you i'm going to do that you can look at him by the word of god and say get behind me satan you are a liar i'm a child of god i'm born again i'm going to heaven and you're going to hell leave me alone but instead he roars and then whenever we jump i ain't going to get too much out of use camp because boy last year last time i was here i already got a lot more the devil jumped me back so i ain't forget much this time if i shoot i get more i get more i make up in my mind this is going to be one of the paramount times of my life i'm talking about an emotion i'm talking about just a stir i'm talking about something in your soul that'll set you on fire so the devil is so hungry he's roaring i want russia i want ukraine i want to young people i want your preachers i want them all and he roars and we jerk and he roars and we quiver can you imagine god's prophet being so in tune with god that he said if a person had cancer and you didn't fear it it couldn't hurt you your sister's frying frying meat one morning for breakfast and the grease pops out and burns your hand and if you don't fear it you can say in the name of jesus you said that's a quote no it ain't it happened to my youngest daughter a year or so ago frying meat in her kitchen and the grease jumped out of her hand and pop trot on her hand and her first reaction was what it's the fight or flight within us and the devil wrote oh you're going down you're this or that the other but all of a sudden something from on the inside of her reminded her of that quote hallelujah oh what would it be like if we as the children of god whenever satan comes against us instead of us running and said well i'm quitting i'm just turning my back on the lord oh you coward come on get your backbone in this meeting i'll be able to walk out of here and look the devil in the face and say look devil you have blessed me your last time you have loved me your last time roar oh you want to devil but i am a young person in this message that is more than a conqueror or you can keep coming to this meeting year after year after year and get what brother brown called camp meeting cramps so you come and you get all fired up then you go back home and it lasts about a week or two and then some of your pastors get up there to preach and you say oh no not him again and you say well if he'd preach what brother andrew does well if you'd get with him the way you get to brother andrew you might turn that dry high preacher yours into a fireball if you had pulled on him come on to you saying brother branham would have looked at his dog go fritz whenever he wanted friends to be able to get that skunk and brother branham would have went that's what other message folks folks do anymore they don't say amen they nod we're not holy rovers we're holding others so you're reckoning that brother brandon looked at fritz and said principle what they said are you kidding me you think i'm going in there and going to tackle that skunk but what brother andrew said seeking boy seeking boy you don't need just get with me and brother ron and brother anger and these special meetings you need to take this special something home with you and when your pastor gets up to preach staring to death god said amen pastor that's why brother oh wow they located one will a revival may break out in your church [Applause] or of course you can just let the lion say you ain't gonna get nothing i wouldn't go in that prayer line if i was you if you do i'll get you just tell him what he is shut up polygraph mouse the lord jesus broke your back the prophet of god said we are dealing with a defeated enemy a defeated and brother donna the symptoms are still there sure they may be there but by faith you can look at that which is not and say it is as though it was already substance in your life oh but i've got to beset him sin yeah and that lion wants to tell you you'll never get rid of it are you going to believe the lion or the tribe of judah or are you going to believe this lying devil are you going to believe satan well you can't get delivered you've tried and you've tried you've probably turned away your day of grace the very reason you're here tonight proves there's grace for you some of you may think you've send away your day of grace don't you listen to that lying devil if you had you wouldn't even be here there's grace for you there's mercy for you there's deliverance for you so why do that young people are we going to be standing in this last day we're living in an age when people don't know that for a man or a woman the lady that was just voted in by our senate to be the next justice of our supreme court was asked the question to define what a woman is she couldn't even say what one was i found that was so profound since she herself was a woman she should have been able to say i am a woman a real child of god when the devil comes against you oh what about this and what about that where's a real believer say i am a real believer i am a real christian ah well who who's going in the rapture i'm going in the rapture who's going to be an overcomer i'm going gonna be an overcomer either died or you're gonna listen to the lying mouth of this devil but you need to stand your ground and say no satan i am an overcomer by the grace of god [Applause] young people he's hungry he wants you he wants you you you he wants you as a trophy i'm a hunter and i've been able to hunt in different places around the world i've got a big old e land in my one of my game rooms it's a big old gigantic antelope the largest of the antelope in the world he's number 32 in the world actually whenever i shot him six and a half foot tall at the shoulder so his head was his horns is about nine feet tall massive massive animal well i've seen some a lot littler but i wanted a trophy don't you understand why this lion wants you you are a trophy oh how many have sat here in this building but now they're on satan's wall of fame that one right there oh yeah he used to go down to louisiana camp oh he shouted run carried on this that and the other now i don't even believe in god i got him look at that one there you see her preacher's daughter used to believe the message now she don't think there's a god no more one of my favorites is it up now x message preacher i'll tell you friends he'd love to have that one and that one and that one he'd love to have you and you and you but it's up to you do you want to be on his wall or do you want to be one of them trophies that'll walk down the streets of gold hallelujah the lord jesus ain't going to put you on a wall he's wanted to put you in a city oh hallelujah he don't want your head he wants your heart that's his trophy if we can give him our hearts and satan will roar and he will lie and he will do all he's going to do and what do we do we're more than conquerors more than conquerors [Applause] oh i sing tonight of our poor brothers and sisters in the ukraine they have been bombed they've had missiles shot at their homes their homes are annihilated their country nearly destroyed and you've probably seen some of the videos that are coming out from the message people there and they're gathering i saw one the other day but the bad coffee had sent it to him and it was the young people in a certain area of ukraine and they were standing there singing about 20 of them maybe 30 something like that sending their singing of the victorious power of god their home gone the livelihood gone every single round i'm gone maybe their freedom naturally russia want to take them over because the bear is wanting to exercise its authority and there they were singing i thought praise god still able to sing about the grace of god what about you you may look at how well this is gone and my dreams are gone and that's gone but if you got enough joy the lord inside of you that you can stand and say i maybe look like at the end of my rope but my god has never lost a battle which one are you going to hear the line or the tribe of judah or are you going to hear this toothless liar that's going to tell you there's no way you're going to have to believe one or the other you're going to have to believe the voice that said you can't come back you're going to have to believe the voices said this preacher's prayed for you and that one's prayed for you and you didn't get the holy ghost but who knows tonight might be your night friend tonight might be your night and if you don't get it tonight i'll be back in the morning and tomorrow night and the next morning and the next night you say lord i read until you fill me with the holy ghost hallelujah standing on this dark day it is so dark friends when brother branham looked and he looked into that realm he could not see past 1977. now many people try to take that and twist it around it make him a false prophet he never said he prophesied in the first place he said i predict so you imagine as he's looking out through that realm by vision and he cannot see any farther than 1977. you know where that puts us from 77 till now it's been so dark that the prophet couldn't even see past it no wonder you're fighting the powers of hell every day how many knows what i'm talking about every day of your life well used two years ago my i used to come down through louisiana as a pentecostal preacher oh man i run up and down this country and preach and boy in them days my mountaintops is like this wow boy i mean you get up on the mountains and i mean you just go forever and then you go down the valley whoa here you go back again and now they're whoop if you back your eyes you miss your mountain and then valleys just seem like they go on and on anybody been there beside me you've been there anybody been there or you just think lord is this valley ever going to end and you just you know you and you said well whatever oh you just missed your mountain it's 30 seconds long what's going on what's wrong is it you the devil wants to make you think it's you it's the hour we're living the darkness is pressing the ghost and the darkness the wanting to haunt you remember cigarettes is not your enemy pornography your smartphone no it's demons demons they've gathered right in this building right here tonight oh yeah you may find it shocking but they would follow the prophet's meetings demons and angels they'd say the darkness is here and the light is here i can hear him screaming the angels of god walking down the aisles he said which way will the battle go he said it'll depend upon your face your face praise the lord well i believe that we are going to be more than conquerors any young men here tonight want to say i refuse i refuse to be the devil's supper breakfast or lunch what about young ladies i refuse i refuse i want to give my body my soul now all those lines of darkness all they could do was eat the bodies of those people they could never touch their souls but this one this one wants your body and your soul he knows this is the shortest span of time that he will have people so people live to be 80 years old they live a wicked life and they die satan knows okay no big deal i'll take them to the lake of fire and there i'll have them for maybe hundreds of years or thousands of years which will it be you're going to hear the line of the tribe of judah as he whispers his message of redemption and love and salvation but brother donnie i am so filthy my god specializes in picking up filthy vessels [Music] some of us we don't even want to get our hands dirty dealing with some people it's it's pretty bad i mean a lot of these preachers these brothers right here are guaranteed they have dealt with some filthy cases filthy lives of people and there's a reproach there's a preacher even doing it but our god is so loving and so wonderful that he can reach down and pick up your life oh you say but i come here today with cigarettes i come drink and i i sinned even today well acknowledge that and that's the lord to forgive you and pick you up out of that old filthy barnyard and wash you and cleanse you and fill you with the holy ghost before you leave this place or you will become satan's meal next week or the week after remember you'll never be the same after this meeting either you'll be better or you'll be worse we can't be the same we can't be the same god called these meetings i think it's more than brother tim would you i think he's more than brother tim i believe god did it amen but i want to be a better person when i pull out of here lord willing on sunday i want to be a better man i want to be closer to god when the devil roars after me and he's roared after me my whole life i give my heart to the lord when i was a 12 year old boy and started preaching when i was 18. so i've been preaching almost all my life and he roars and he roars and he still does and he wants to scare me and make me fear but i found out a long time ago i can listen to his roars and be intimidated by him or i can listen to the coos of the dove of the holy ghost as he's drawing us closer and closer i mean brother tim was talking to us i guess some of the message brothers have been studying on russia more and he said yeah probably some of them having said but i ain't he said i've actually been studying more on how to get people filled with the holy ghost how to get them a ticket in their hand to be able to leave this world in a rapture can we bow our heads i wonder on the first night here tonight maybe there's some that's you're not where you need to be with the lord we're not going to be here to look at you and judge you and none of that but you say really you describe my life i'm out in that barnyard i'm so filthy i'm so dirty i'm so ashamed anyone you'd like to be remembered just raise your hand to the lord not not to us preachers god bless you god bless you friends god bless you may the lord help you maybe there's others of you that you're picked up out of the yard but you're in the sanctification process you're still hanging on to habits and this and that and you need the lord to help you you raise your hand to the lord god bless you maybe there's others heavy that you're washed you're sitting up on the counter of god you've been there for five years ten but you know but the way you live you still don't have the holy ghost because you have to make yourself live this life the prophet tells us how can overcome it's not a life that you force yourself to live it's lived out of you automatically and if you're here tonight that way and you say i need to be filled not just in the visible audience but streaming as well all right let's break together in this belief when we pray heavenly father as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth from whence we came the first night lord of what we believe to be a great great meeting our hearts have been under such anticipation [Music] lord god i pray in the name of jesus may you deal with every heart tonight you saw the hands this is like a one-room schoolhouse as it were we have people of all different spiritual levels speech spiritual understanding so may you deal with every one of them on their level father oh lord god may you deliver those that maybe have got habits and besetting sins lord they've been around the church in the message for years but they've never really moved beyond that father may this be the meeting that they can say i'm free i'm free lord maybe some's been picked up out of that barnyard and they're in the process of sanctification when they get angry they still lose their temper and say words they shouldn't lord they they have resentment in their hearts and this and that and they're they're being washed but they're just not quite clean yet you saw the hands it was uplifted in that category and the others lord that believe that they've been picked up and they've been washed and sanctified but they're still empty lord god your prophet said you're wanting empty vessels and if you can get those empty vessels and you will fill them with yourself you'll send them out to conquer the world how angry hell must be satan and all of his demons has our nation under control they have our president's office under control congress senate every senate of the state the nations of the world but there's a group of people on the face of the earth he cannot get and it makes him so angry [Music] of all the people on the face of the earth why are these people still here he hates us so if he can't get our soul he'll try to afflict our bodies and if he don't afflict us he'll try to afflict our children lord god help us father but lord jesus give us the strength as your children to stand and face this enemy not with our strength we don't want to be strong like peter was in his flesh but lord god we want to say not through me but through him who lives in me hallelujah oh jesus may your presence sweep down this way tonight lord have been listening to the brother and brethren saying that satan is howling and he's on the rampage and he uses that statement several times satan is howling he's howling oh lord how beautiful it was the other day when you spoke to him and i was down the basement listen to the prophet saying that and you said he's howling but i'm cooing praise god you're cooing to your little bride oh hallelujah you're cooing to your bride that's what it was when moses pinned it there in genesis and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the deep and the word there is ruach elohim ruach elohim and the hebrew word is as a mother bird as she gathers her little chicks together and you brood it over the earth oh jesus come by tonight father brood over our hearts lord ruok elohim brood over my heart brood over me jesus hallelujah we worship you lord god we worship you can we just worship him now just a little bit before we go look at me for just a moment that vessel which was filthy dirty and nasty now administers back to me the prophet tells us in question answer 64 when rebecca went and got those pots and started watering those camels and whenever you multiplied and see how many gallons she had to have for those camels it was phenomenal she was packing back and forth about six or seven hours to be able to get those camels enough water you imagine she's probably ringing wet with sweat and she was just worn out but little did she know those beasts she was watering was the same ones that was going to carry her to her bridegroom so when you praise him you're watering you're blessing his name let's water tonight you know oh he said but i'm tired and i'm weary that's one of the best times to give him a sacrifice of praise amen can we just worship me brother timothy would you sing something for us can we just worship him we'll let you go here just momentarily but may the spirit of god just be able to come by and flood her over our hearts cool cool brother charlie cox told me one time brother brown was down there in the year 1956 there were some power lines over brother charlie's driveway in his house there maybe some doves that would get out there and they would coo he said brother branham would go out there and he'd listen to them doves he makes mention of it and god making a way in brooklyn new york 1956 and he said them doves they just cool and they make love to one another and they take their little necks and they just wrap around one another can you imagine how privileged you are satan wants you for supper but god invites you for supper what does he say if any man will open the door i will come in and sup with him you know what that word is i'll have supper with him praise god satan wants you for supper god is inviting you for supper he said call this meeting for a few days and he said if you all will open the door i'll come and have supper with can you imagine how honored you are a couple years ago i was up in washington was able to go to the white house and all that out of the white house comes the vice president mike pence walking right down the aisle here's people all around him just comes right up i'm able to shake his hand well that was quite an honor but that ain't near the honor i've got right here tonight he ain't vice president no more he got voted out but you know what nobody
