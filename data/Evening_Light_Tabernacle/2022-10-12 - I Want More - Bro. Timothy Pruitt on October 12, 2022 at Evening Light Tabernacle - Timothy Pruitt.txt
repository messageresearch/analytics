was still there even when you gave up he never gave up what a mighty God we serve father we love you tonight with all of our hearts thank the Lord you never left his Lord that you've been with us every step of the way Lord reminded or the man who looked back and saw one set of footprints and wondered where you was at but through it all you was carrying him Lord we're so thankful you've been carrying this small and moving in us and changing lives and hearts God we just thank you with everything that's within us Lord for all the Miracles that you've done Among Us the healings and the deliverances families that's been restored God what a mighty God you are we love you father and we thank you for these things in Jesus name amen let's turn to Psalms 42 and verse 1. amen have you had a good week amen as the heart paneth after the water Brooks so panteth my soul after thee o God my soul thirsts for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat and day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God what I when I remember these things I pour out my soul in me for I've gone with a multitude I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy day why art thou cast down on my soul or thou disquieting me hope thou and God for us so yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the hermionites and from the hill mizar the Deep calleth unto the Deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me amen we let you be seated I I don't think that we could find anyone in here that could say that we didn't have some wonderful meetings amen just a wonderful outpouring of the Holy Spirit if if you didn't get what you needed it wasn't anybody's fault but yours amen because God was here and the atmosphere was in place and and God was moving in a miraculous way and we saw him move very uh spontaneously in many ways and and many many different Avenues and uh just a prayer line that would form and different things even Sunday afternoon as the Lord would begin to still deal with hearts and and I just want to say thank you to all that was involved in in helping with every part of that I I was saying to the ones in the back that this meeting went went without a hitch it wasn't a even a hiccup and it was because of Amen dedicated hearts that saw a vision and and put their heart into it and we've witnessed the Glorious outpouring of the spirit of God there were many healings there were many deliverances there were families that were restored amen there were many things and no doubt we'll mark this uh for a long time as one of the the greatest meetings we've ever ever been in but I want to say it's in the past and I want to also say I want more amen I don't think we should ever amen just only be able to point to the past and what God did but God is still moving and God is still touching and I I believe we ought to come to every service with the expectation amen you know we call them special meetings but every service that we ever Gather in ought to be special amen we ought to be expecting amen the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and we we have that a lot here at this church and and God comes according to our expectations amen and he comes according to what we're expecting him to do if you expected him to do the exceedingly abundantly he'll do the exceedingly abundantly if you expect him to heal and deliver he'll do exactly that whatever you expect amen I believe he would do and so tonight amen just as uh even that that song that brother Michael brought to the to the meetings and and I've been listening to it over through the week amen I I just want to speak for a moment on I want more amen I'm not satisfied I was yesterday but I want more I believe every day ought to be a fresh and a new experience with the Lord amen I believe our I believe we ought to be looking for a you know as a children of Israel they went out and they gathered Manna amen they couldn't depend on the manna that they gathered yesterday but they had to gather more for every day of their life and it ain't just get the one it ain't just a one and done with the Holy Ghost and one and done when his presence and one and done but we need to be expecting God to move more and more and greater and greater than he ever has before amen because we're looking to something greater that's never happened before amen we're a group of people is going to take a body change amen if you say it happened I guess you know we could look back to Abraham and Sarah but as a group amen a multi-membered body amen I believe we have to be moving our faith to that moment to believe for that moment amen so therefore our faith King decrease has got to increase amen and so I want to look at this and I want to look again at another scripture in Psalms 34 and verse 1. it said I Will Bless The Lord at all times I will bless the all the Lord at all times and his praise shall continually be in my mouth amen not just in a certain setting or a certain time but at all times my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles have you found yourself anywhere in there the angel of the Lord and campus round about them that fear Him and delivereth them oh taste and see that the Lord is good and blessed is the man that trustses in him oh fear the lord use his Saints for there is no want to them that fear Him oh taste and see I love how the scripture put that it wasn't oh see that the Lord is good oh taste and see amen you can see a picture of a of a wonderful meal or maybe your favorite thing you ever ate maybe it's crawfish or whatever it is you can see a picture of that but that is nothing like be able to be there and taste what it's like amen when you taste it and you put it in your mouth the picture is good it looks good looks amazing but it's just a picture amen but if you could ever taste it if you could ever put it into your mouth it'll start Awakening the sensory things in your mouth and saliva start falling and things are beginning your stomach will start rumbling amen as you begin to taste and if it's good you'll want more of it amen if it's what you thought it was going to be and it's what you've been designed you'll want more of it amen one little bite won't satisfy you amen will want more and more and more amen many times more than your portion amen amen the prophet of God said it like this he said the supper call is home the robes are being given God is taken from the gentile people for his namesake in the last days and he's bringing them in through campaigns of healing the lame blind the Halt and the withered he said now these big starchy stuck-ups won't even come they think they're better but Jesus said they won't taste my supper Hallelujah but you can taste and see that the Lord is good it tastes like Honey in the Rock and oh how good it is he said I've seen it in the churches well people will all be filled in a little prayer meeting somewhere to the children even lick their tongues it's so good spiritually speaking wonderful it's Honey in the Rock hallelujah amen he said to remind him one time of being up there in a hunting trip and and he was going he had caught a few trout and was going to skin him out and make him a little breakfast and he was getting some things together and he come back into Camp after he cleaned up the trout and got them all skinned up and he's going to bring him in and find his frying pan and his grease and things and here's a bunch of rumbling going on he looks in there and there's these bears that are coming to the camp and they had found at something he couldn't figure out what it was until he finally could get over a little bit and he could find where one little Cub had found the Molasses jar and somehow he had got the top off of it and he stuck his paws in there and he said ma he was just having a wonderful time and and he said I was just watching him as it took place and and then he said I tried to make a noise he said if you ain't careful those bears and scratches what he said he said so I try to make a little noise to get him out of the way and that's when Mama Bear made a little noise and sent one Cub running and but the other one wouldn't leave there was something that had his attention it was something that was greater than and the fear of men or the fear of what's around him or what was going on around the circumstances he found something better and he wasn't ready to leave it and she could coo and she could call and he just kept on stopping he said and he stopped some more and he stopped some more and he stopped some more he said till he got the last sop out of the bucket and he said he ran back when he finally got that last little sop out of the bucket and he pulled his foot up and he saw me he said I thought he saw I thought my he said what's going to happen now he said he got he said I screamed get away from here and he ran to his mama he said but they didn't go nowhere for a while because they realized he had something on him that they wanted and they began to stop and they begin to he said a brother if that ain't the old time Pentecostal meeting I never saw one got his hand in the Honey Bucket come up to his arm like that just sopping away all condemnation was gone all fear was gone everything was on the only thing in his mind was I want some more Hallelujah I want some more amen they say the only thing he was doing is just kept oh it tastes like Honey in the Rock the strange one thing was when he finally sopped the bucket out he went over to where this Mammy was and his little brother and they began to lick on him just like the red like he had getting them some of the honey amen I believe that's what we should do that's why we should share our testimonies it is sharing the honey that we received it is sharing the things of God and the goodness of God that we have tasted and saw that he was good we have saw that he'll raise the dead we have saw that he'll heal the sick we have saw amen they'll take depression off our lives and break black streaks of family troubles off of life we have saw it and therefore we want some more of it we want more of his goodness we want more of his grace we want more of the Holy Ghost to be poured out in our lives we want more [Applause] Hallelujah he said one thing the Tabernacle needs us is the Tabernacle with Jeff he says is a rededication and a refilling of the Holy Ghost everyone to get to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing the whole church be filled with the power of God he said that's what we need not only the Tabernacle there but the body of Christ Universal I I like David said it one day restoring to me the joy of my salvation see he hadn't lost his salvation but he lost the joy of it and he said when it comes to a place I can't enjoy my religion there's something wrong somewhere you ought to want more of it amen there should be an enjoyment amen if there's a something that whatever your brother brother Joe what's your favorite meal yeah I know what it is and he don't even know it's Biscuits and tomato gravy [Applause] when he gets some of it he might be on a diet but he'll let that diet go amen amen if he could just find somebody that'll make him a good pan of biscuits and tomato gravy you got one happy man right there and let me let you know he ain't interested in just a little nibble on it oh he might nibble on something else sometime but that ain't what he really desires but if he ever gets what he really wants amen and I found evening like Tabernacle has found what she really wants the other world other churches they can nibble they can nibble but this church has found the goodness of God and God is being poured out in hers and we want more Hallelujah if you can't enjoy your religion there's something wrong with you but I like enjoying my religion I like to enjoy the presence of God I like to just sit in it and then let him rain down or dance or shout or whatever it takes I'm going to enjoy it Hallelujah if you got a problem with me enjoying it you just ain't tasted it yet maybe it ain't your favorite thing to eat amen Hallelujah it was a debate that was being taken place it was an infant that was saying there was no such a thing as God doing that little silly looking boy sitting there with his hair hanging down his eyes over all his own came walking out one tooth out in the front stood up in front of that Infidel started peeling the Apple he said what do you want little boy said I want to ask you a question he said well ask well wait a minute he just kept peeling his Apple cut the core out of it got it just like he wanted he said hurry up see what you're going to do say her or I'll I'll get you through it wait just a minute and he kept peeling the Apple and he took a piece and he put it in his mouth and he chewed on and swallowed it he said I had to ask you a question is this apple sweet or is it sour Infidel said I'm not eating it I don't know he said that's what I thought and he walked right on down and sat down how do you know whether there's a holy ghost or not until you received it how do you know Jesus heals or not until you receive it how do you know what it's like to be in the presence of God till you've been in it how do you know what it's like to be free until you're free once you realize what it was to be a free man you want more of it everybody else can kind of look and don't don't understand and don't know what's going on and what's happening look at that person dancing and they can call it a bunch of work up and a bunch of motion the problem is they ain't ate the apple they ain't hated the presence of God oh taste and see that the Lord is good they want more of it no matter how much you read out of the Bible that won't work the Holy Ghost has got to witness it to you that he's resurrected in your life therefore you won't know whether sweet or whether or sour as David said taste and see that the Lord is good who knows if it's good before you taste it but it's he that tasted it that knows Hallelujah as old saying goes the proof of the puddin isn't in the eating thereof Hey listen I've seen some beautiful cakes that look beautiful looked amazing look like you're even you're starting you know stuff starts and all of a sudden you get your slice of it and it's terrible look it tastes like you put some kind of sweet stuff on cornbread or taste got some funny taste it's it's all to us you're like man that thing don't taste as good as it looks it's deceiving a lot of people's religion looks real good but you get a taste of it you find out there's a lot of bitterness there amen you find out there's a lot of dryness there you find out there ain't much moisture of the spirit of God there you realize the rain ain't been on it kind of gets in your mouth and you can't hardly swallow it and you're trying to get it down and trying to and it just won't go and there's it just ain't there but I've also saw some cakes that didn't look like much wasn't the prettiest ice and wouldn't have put together the best but boy when you got a bite of it you wanted more you got a bite of his eye on another piece of that let me just give you a little hint while we're just family here if brother Tim ever hands you a piece of cake it ain't no good [Applause] I made that mistake before me once it's your fault fool me twice is mine amen it ain't no good amen but when when he's over there and he ain't giving you none you want a piece of that cake amen there's something in there that's good it may not look the best it may not be the you may be your favorite but if it if he's eating it you want it I know it's going to get you in trouble because sister's going to be looking at you like is he eating my cake or not but I was it I was there before I was sitting in a group of people and he got his peace and and I was waiting on my piece and it looked so good looked so good and he said here you can have mine I didn't think about it I just took me a big old bite I see why you gave it to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof therefore you wonder why some people's religion you just don't want none of it you tried it but I don't want no more none of it but if you can ever get the sweetness of the honey of God and you can get into the spirit of the Wrath the realm of the spirit of God and let it get to flowing over you and then you'll know why there's joy in the heart said why we got a George shoes on and why are we rejoicing if you'll just eat what we're eating if you don't want it it's up to you I ain't gonna make you eat it ain't gonna make you eat it but just get a taste just get a taste he says he said see he said he was sitting there and he said see no man can say Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost you need a taste he said well how do you know taste and see give God a chance see if he will take it and give your glory give you glory for your misery see if he will give you happiness for your Gloom see if he will give you health for your sickness see if he will give you the Holy Ghost for your theology try it and see taste and see the Lord is good let's give him a chance Hallelujah he said see I don't want to just walk I want to walk closer to him he said while the Branham Tabernacle is having a Revival I want one myself amen I just wanted to happen in the building I don't want it to just happen in the building I want it to happen in me I want more of the Holy Spirit oh that's what the prophet of God said I want more of the holy spirit in me to reflect Christ in me I want to be like him I know that every true Christian wants to be like him that's my heart's desire to be like Jesus I want him as an example I want him I want to be as him the example of what I should be I'll take it'll take the Holy Ghost to do that that's the only thing that I'm not interested in seminaries I'm not interested in what somebody else got to tell me I don't care about kissing crucifixes or doing all that I want more of the Holy Spirit to take over William Branham well if he can have that desire we can have that desire I'm not interested in joining a greater Church than what I belong to I belong to the real Church of the Living God the firstborn I was born into it I want more of the holy ghost in my life to reflect Christ who I love I don't care what plane or level I have to come on to get it I don't care if I have to go here go there be called a fanatic a Holy Roller or whatever it may be I want more of his life to be reflected in me I'm not interested in the plane I have to come on in other words don't be satisfied with the plane you're on ain't talking about the one buzzing over I'm talking about the walk you're on and they don't you don't have a walk of satisfaction and I'm satisfied no we ought to be something wanting more I want more more than I had yesterday more than I had in the last meeting just think how great these meetings would be if you come to the next meeting with more than what you had the previous meeting and then we all have that same walk and we all get there and we come in with more when I get a taste of God when the Holy Spirit comes into the meeting that's good but I want more of it there's more of it or you wouldn't never have that desire for more of it because he promised it is every Redemptive blessing is ours you get what you're looking for you get what you're Desiring for If You're Expecting tonight to get healed you're going to get healed if you're not expecting it if you come to the meeting and say well I'll just see what goes on that's all you'll see is what's going on the devil will show you something that isn't right if you say I know that's not right the devil's going to make sure he shows you something that isn't right if you say Lord I believe you I want a blessing in my heart you'll get it just what you're expecting that's what you'll get always be expecting when you get up in the morning be expecting when you go to bed be expecting when you come to the house of God every service say God I want more of you [Applause] usually you get just what you expect if you come to the meeting or service and you say well I'm just going to go there tonight there's nothing to it that's what you're going to get out of it you'll get down there and say well I'll go down there there's no need of me going because I'm not going to get healed well that's just the way you'll go back but if you'll come expecting God to do something for you he'll do it if you expect to find something to criticize the meeting or criticize the way it's conducted Satan will show you plenty of it you'll find plenty but if you'll come not to criticize a meeting but you'll come and say God I want to see where you are in it I want to see where you are in it amen I want to see where you are God will show you himself in it just whatever you expect God will give it to you it's your expectancy now I want you to come tonight expecting to see God move in the greatest ways move since we've been here [Applause] what's wrong with that expectation every service [Applause] I had a man a preacher friend of mine that says well we can't just expect every service to be special meaning I say why not if you want to exp if you want to preach that expected expectancy that's what you're going to get but how come we can't expect God to move the greatest he's ever moved since he's been here since we've been here amen that's where that's where you know we wonder sometimes how come is it when you can come out some services and you sing one song and the place explodes you know why because people are expecting it they're they're they're longing for it they're look they woke up that morning maybe it was a song that hit him or or Bible verse that hit him it caused the desire and there's and then another one comes and it's got the same desire in a few and this fire begins to spread as the music begins to go and the song leader comes out he ain't hardly got to sing nothing and it just goes why it ain't because he done anything greater it's because you did it Hallelujah let's ask God not to leave one crippled person one blind person one deaf person one dumb person one sick person in our midst tonight let's believe it will you do that with me and I'll believe God will do it if we're expecting that right now Hallelujah why are you going to be taking a body change because you're expecting a body change [Applause] he said usually as we talk of expectancy well we think whatever we expect to do that's the way to be he said I'm expecting I got an engagement or appointment to meet you I expect you to be there I know one thing that we everyone today got an appointment that we're going to meet God somewhere sometime or another do you know that it was once appointed to man to die and after that the Judgment we're all going to meet that some men sins go before them if you confess them here some follow after so let's meet God now let's get the thing right now and then be expecting him when he comes in his glory and power for him to say it was well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord if you come with a kind of sarcastic criticism whatever you expect to see that's just what you'll see if you come expecting to be disappointed you will be disappointed you'll get what you expect if you come

I'm waiting on you Lord touch my heart God it's me Jesus [Applause] I want more be watching expecting something to happen hey man you want an angel to show up you start expecting an angel to show up if you want Jesus to come on the scene you start expecting Jesus to come on and say if you want the pillar of fire to fall Among Us you'll be expecting it every service Hallelujah he said I know I'm talking maybe there ain't many tonight but many opossum Hunters I had an old dog once talking book about this tree everybody took him out the tree but he'd come and treat something it was a skunk and I'd get a skunk on the brush pile and a dog dog wouldn't go get it only thing I'd have to do is raise up the brushed pile Pat him a little bit and say second seek Him and he'd go get him the worst skunk I know of is the devil and he said a little amen a little while once in a while and a second that's what we need to do is seek the devil every service amen let's turn it a little bit not just expecting God to come but start expecting the devil to be defeated change the power law the powers of Hell to be broken fathers will be restored mothers to come home children to come home we will not receive a prodigal unless we're under the expectation of receiving particles [Applause] but if you're under the expectation God will fulfill the desires of your heart Hallelujah being led by the spirit of God be expecting it Simeon was expecting God to keep his word Abraham was expecting God to keep his word David was expecting God to keep his word when he met the John Samson was expecting God to keep his word when he laid his his arms around the pole Sampson was expecting God to keep his word when he picked up the Jawbone of a mule and beat down a thousand Philistines the Hebrew children was expecting God to keep his word when they walked into a fire furnace Daniel was expecting God to keep his word when he went in among the lines the woman that touched the hymn of His Garment was expecting God to keep his word Martha was expecting God to keep his word if you're expecting it you shall receive it he will always get what you expect if you come to get healed you'll go away healed that's what you expect God to do got to do it delivered set free whatever it is are you expecting something tonight are you expecting to go home well you get what you expect if you come to a meeting to find something that criticize the devil show you plenty but if you come for the good of it to be saved the holy spirit will speak to you you come expect them to be healed the holy spirit will see to it you get what you're expecting so be expecting it but look at Mary when the Holy Ghost told her you're going to have a child knowing no man she didn't reason with it she just took him at his word and said there it is and she went around testifying I'm going to have a baby I'm going to have a baby I'm going to have a baby she didn't wait till she had a positive result she didn't wait till she had a kick she didn't wait till she had one sensation she said I'm going to have a baby she took God in his word she didn't wait excuse the expression you listened to a doctor I'm listening I'm your brother she didn't wait till she felt life she didn't wait till something took place she could see naturally she was going to be a mother she just took the Angel's word and when the Angels said you're going to do it she said behold the hands made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word and she went around rejoicing I'm going to have a baby before she had one evidence the baby was coming outside of what the angel had spoke to her that's the only evidence she had she couldn't go even go back in the Bible and say hey here this happened before it had never happened before that a woman received a child without knowing a man amen Hannah couldn't look back and look at back and see it amen different others had an examples but she didn't have that example but she had the word of the Angel so she took him at his word and started expecting him to bring it to pass she took God his word started rejoicing saying God said so that settles it I'll Rejoice anyhow I don't have to feel nothing I don't have to have some sensation I just believe it anyhow oh you'll see an old-fashioned Revival sweep this country burning out sin and every church will fill up what a time it'll be of men and women will do just that take God in his word and be expecting him to do what he said he would do he said it was a little boy one time that would eat erasers off of bicycle tires because there was something lacking in his body he had a taste for it because there was a lack and he wanted more it's something called sulfur and they had but before he could have that desire that had to be something there to respond to that call or it wouldn't be a call there something's hungry got to be something to respond when our forefathers the pilgrims landed on here in Plymouth Rock they found the Indians they were worshiping the sun they were worshiping images sprinkling with blood dancing carrying on what was it it was a human being it was something in their heart to worship something they had knew there had to be a Creator there was a deep calling to the Deep if there's a deep call and there's got to be a deep to respond amen you remember not long ago before you received the Holy Spirit your heart burned for something it was something down deep I got to have something more I want more you come to church you joined it whatever but you've never been born again your heart called for what was it the deep that called it to the Deep there's got to be a deed to respond and tonight if you're craving healing God's Bible says us there something's in you telling you it's there and it sure is there something you craving for Divine Healing there's a fountain open somewhere Hallelujah there's a fountain open somewhere the same Holy Ghost they gave Simian the promise and led him to the Christ has led you here tonight has led you to the fountain or if you'll just see it and bathe in it and get more and more and more and more and more of it Simeon led by the Holy Spirit here he comes not knowing where he's going men who walk with God don't care where they're going as long as they're walking with him he walked into out into the building I could see this old sage as he's walking the holy spirit is leading him it was a deep calling he knew he had been promised he would see the Messiah before he would die and it was something in him looking for it and anticipation for it and wanting it and Desiring it it wasn't satisfied just sitting over in the corner somewhere but there was a pool that was going on he said Lord now has it come and he's seen this little baby he picks up this little bundle of love and he wrapped it in swallowing clothes pulled him up to his bosom tears running down his cheeks he said Lord now let your servant depart in peace according your word for my eyes of senior salvation the Holy Spirit was moving because he was expecting it he was expecting to see it and God led him to his full expectancy are you expecting him tonight if you are God will lead you to him same time there was this prophetess Anna was blind 80 years old stayed in the temple prayed day and night she too was looking for the consolation of Israel the coming of the Lord and here she sat in the corner blind the same time the holy spirit said rise up and here comes this old blind woman filling away her way to the crowd going to the great host of the temple till she got right to where he was and lifted up her hands and blessed God if the Holy Ghost could lead that Brian prophetess because she was expecting to see the Lord Jesus when he comes and he could leave he can also lead you to The Fountains of His blessings and Grace just be expecting it looking forward to it it's here God said it is he's moving by his Spirit moving all over the Earth signs and wonders when God moves say move oh Lord on me move on Lord on me everywhere God moves anytime Through the Bible you will see healings miracles signs and wonders I like how he said this because it it's it the devil takes that black line of family issues and wants to follow you listen to what he said he leaves a track behind him of the supernatural foreign God has a track record he leaves a track behind him of the supernatural I don't care what theologians say the Bible is right when God moves the world shakes and when he moves at every Revival they've ever had at Luther's day Wesley's day days of Calvin Knox Finley and saying all the way down through and today he's no less than he was then if anything he's greater today than he was then [Music] [Applause] what a mighty God we serve what a great God we serve what a what a wonderful God we serve over there and go get my phone be expecting it now what if you're sitting here he let me go back for a minute I missed something he leaves a track behind him of the supernatural why did you come here tonight did you come to get healed did you come to see him did you come what'd you come for he said here not long ago I was over in Dallas Texas started back home an airplane got caught in a storm we had to come down to Memphis and Memphis Tennessee put me up in that famous hotel the Peabody couldn't stay in a place like that on my own money but they put me up there and I'm wondering what's going on he said why was I there he said because of a little woman's expectancy Hallelujah he said well while you're sitting here and I turned and said what I did do you believe me to be his prophet he said then go eat your supper your stomach trouble go away it won't bother you no more quit worrying about it you're always taking other people's troubles and they quit thinking about it be happy Rejoice amen cancer Devils everything they're moving away why because we are expecting it to happen praise God Satan's lost another battle the devil calls one to another screaming and calling for help he said right now I'll call for your prayer it's a battle that's going on there's a power the devil's fighting wrong fighting against right right against wrong quit being Skeptics don't come in there being Skeptics the holy spirit is healing the holy spirit is delivered but what you come expecting be expecting to be next Hallelujah be expecting to be next if he delivered that I'm next if he touched that one I'm next Hallelujah If He restored her Joy I'm next if he broke their chains I'm next If He restored their family my family's next if that child come home my child is next be expecting to be next I want more [Applause] he said see you keep believing demons that dark streak we keep screaming help help help keep him from believing keep him from believing but all of a sudden I saw another woman another one dark streaks but all of a sudden I saw a light come through and that dark streak is gone now and the Holy Spirit is standing between you and the Darkness thank you hallelujah hallelujah that light step between sister Jessica and her Darkness be expected to be next I'm next [Applause] be under great expectation he said let me tell you what I expect I expect the church to be on fire I expect the glory of the Lord to be falling everywhere centers around the altar people getting saved and filled with the Holy Ghost that's just a great thing my expectation and anticipation is built way up high well if he had these expectations why does the bride of Christ have anything different they don't expect doctors to be filled no more that's why they closed them and put them in the basement they don't expect anybody to be healed of prayer line that's why they don't have them no more but I still expect God to move how he wants to move foreign I'm going to ask this right now how many how many experienced God at this altar this weekend I want you to raise your hands if you get I need you to stand on your feet raise your hands because I want the whole world to know God still deals in an altar all right I'll let you be seated how many God what you was expecting through a prayer line I want you to stand and wave and let the whole world know [Applause] [Music] all right Hallelujah he's still the same yesterday and a day and forever this should be the bride's expectation man wants to put God In The Box and he only operates the way they want him to you're limiting God by limiting your expectations I'm expecting something to happen Hallelujah he said I believe he said let me go back he said I want to speak on the subject to kind of build up Faith you got to build your faith up if there's ministers here in which there's no doubt there is knows that when you're speaking to people you have to have an atmosphere of preaching for salvation then you want to make that call for it then if you want the atmosphere of healing you get the anointing you get the anointing Yourself by the word of God and deliver it to the people and that puts the whole group in the anointing for a certain thing under expectations of certain things we're expecting something he said you know I believe then to bring that little higher that God's got to all all of his church now the called out remnant of his church under expectations of his coming you see I remember at the gate and it's coming there must have been tremendous Good Friday when they knew he was coming to the feast and expectation many of them were expecting them to be there to see him some kind of Miracle he performed others wanted to see him others there to make fun of him and it was kind of a different Passover than been for a long time when he wrote to the city let's be expecting him to come take us home Hallelujah let's be expecting him to come take us home but God is moving again in his people I got a testimony I got to read here tonight if I can find it right quick we know the Belgium Group that came brother Joshua his brother Isaiah and his wife brother Isaiah's wife Julie they had come with expectations but God did exceedingly above what they even expected see if you can get your expectations high God will always move higher because he does exceedingly above what you can expect so people say I ain't seen a miracle because they hadn't had their expectations High Enough she said I based this sister Julie now brother Isaiah was saved Lord got a hold of him there in Europe back in the end of as 2019 was turn it over into 220 me and brother Danny stayman was their Minister and at a youth conference for Brother David Iverson and the Lord had dealt with me to preach on born of the fire and I was preaching about the seeds that was in the Giants uh the giant trees they're in California how they'd fall to the ground but they cannot come to fruition unless they burnt over with fire and how that man has has regulated the fire and to try to keep from getting the old trees burned up they've they've regulated the fire into where now they're actually having even issues and things because of man-made regulations so you could tell where all that was going and here we were ministering there and I was coming down to the end of it and the altar it filled up there was actually tongues in Prophecy that went forth and um brother brother David Mayer started praying for this young man I didn't know who he was had no idea and but I was expecting God to do something because he just had spoke to me about him so I went down there and began to pray with Brother David and David Mayer was he knew the Brethren is raised up together and uh been in been in some false doctrines and Brother David of course come out of it and this young man had gotten really wounded in that false Doctrine and um so anyway he'd but his his dad had spoke to brother Ron about it and brother Ron had spoke to him a few things so here we are and we're and I began to pray and all of a sudden this man's hands went up and he just began to scream to the top of his lungs and just shout the glories of God and the place begins to erupt and things begin to take place and still I'm not catching this because God goes above your expectations and uh and so he told me later he said you know I I the reason he said I I couldn't contain myself no more he said because I actually heard what sounded like another Realm and he said such beautiful voices of singing like I thought wow these people are singing amazing and it's just pouring into him and he just begins to enter into that and Shout and he actually goes back and if I understand right he goes back and realizes it wasn't really even singing going on in that moment there's rejoicing in the presence of angels his dad had went on just a few months before that and his desire was to see Isaiah and his family saved and and God got a hold of him there and just a few weeks later his wife would come to the Lord and and God would save her but I want to read you her testimony she said I basically can't possibly put into words what we experienced and felt in those Services there in Louisiana but I'm going to try anyway the presence of the Lord in the Eden light Tabernacle was simply like no other I've ever experienced before it really made me very quiet that week speechless with moments to be very honest speechless in moments to be very honest the Lord is doing great things for his children as much as I realize that I don't deserve it all but I know for sure now I'm his how did I ever get to these meetings in Louisiana because oh if you would have told me this 10 years ago but the Lord knows and knows I realize even more now that we're simply fulfilling the vision as brother coffee preached in our church a while back I had to be there everything has a greater purpose for the Lord otherwise I and I'm very I'm sure many others with me wouldn't be writing down our experiences right now I really wanted to be in those meetings Isaiah has been following them for a long time and they had also attracted my attention more and more throughout the few last few years when I was very but I was very excited about the Jubilee Service as I was streamed from Cloverdale bibleway and he asked me if I would like to join him at the meetings in Louisiana this year and even though I never thought of going in advance here we are we were there an old and I can tell you I was full of anticipation not only did I crave for the spiritual food but I was looking for more more of him the first service of Wednesday evening was powerful the sermon did not miss its effect on me and certainly not when brother Andrew spoke the words and the author flips the script because yes that is exactly what he did in our lives and that was just a start the next evening I was even under more anticipation brother Ron Spencer spoke for me that man is a miracle in his own right I remember my heart was about to explode when I entered the room that night and the prediction or the prededication itself was again a true blessing the message itself is a translated the message itself is again a true blessing let's finish this toward the end pour your spirit out sound it out through the room like many others I stepped forward and I raised my hand to the Lord Brother Ron began to pray in the presence of the Lord and the Tabernacle was so intense I could feel it about my head and started praying myself I prayed Lord I know and feel that you are here I know I'm in these meetings for a reason please give me something personal Lord something that is for me that I know that I'm in the right place you know my heart and I need this confirmation I need more from you I converted a while ago and also most people know that and I had an experience at home before but given my past and the doubt Satan plants in my head every day I just had to know that there was nothing left that stood between me and him and that I was okay so I got very serious as I prayed and I beg please give me something something tangible Lord so I just know forever and suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder I stiffened I can't describe it but every muscle in my body cramped a feeling of fear overtook me at first and I tried to turn around after a short while I could remember but I just couldn't turn I did feel that grip remained completely the same and so did the pressure I would I would could collapse because the emotions afterwards and I literally can't put in the words what was going on inside of me at that moment I told myself I had to put myself in my many other thoughts together my thoughts together again and afterwards I would become enraptured and saying like personally never had I hadn't saying before even though I no longer lived in sin we still make mistakes I think and Satan also was always trying read it in my head to sow new doubts this was the moment for me the Breakthrough that deep down I craved so much and what can I say he knew and he knew exactly what I needed after the service I was completely speechless sincerely silent I did not dare to share it at first so I laid awake all night but my heart was overflowing so how can you not share what the Lord has done for you I told my husband Isaiah and sister Bethany Dexter the next day about my experience and we shared it with brother Ron two days later brother Ron also knew that that same Thursday evening another sister from the audience had seen the angel Lord coming through the door I just can't help myself but say hallelujah praise the Lord he knows exactly what he's doing and he always answers every prayer besides his personal experience I had and I'm so so thankful for that there were honestly many more things that touched me deeply during these four days of meetings it still makes me emotional with moments these meetings were a life-changing experience for me was very powerful and clear message and I can only exclaim I take it all Lord I want to stay in his presence forever my heart only wants more foreign I wonder if there'd be here tonight would put their Same Heart with sister Julie and say Lord that's me Lord I only want more I only want more I only want more I want more of you father I want more than I had yesterday I want more than I had this past meeting I want to continue to get more and more and more and more if you'll never fiber Lord favorable part of my heart God not it not let him let me open every door God I will Norm [Applause] oh let's just stand together and lift our voices cry out into the Lord if you have a desire for more there's more to be had elujah maybe you'd be like sister Jessica tonight Lord start with me and my family start with me let me have that same Revival let me have that same moment Hallelujah he's more he's more he's more he wants to do more he wants to give
