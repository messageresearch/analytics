[44:48] and he believed in the Lord and he
[44:50] counted it to him for righteousness and

[44:54] brought thee out of the Earth the
[44:55] chaldees to give thee this land to
[44:58] inherit it skipping down to verse 18. it
[45:01] says in the in the same day the Lord
[45:03] made a covenant with Abram saying unto
[45:05] thy seed have I given this land from the
[45:08] river of Egypt unto the Great River the
[45:11] river Euphrates and also I'm going to
[45:14] read in Genesis 17 and verse 1. Genesis
[45:18] 17 and 1. it says that when Abram was 90
[45:20] years old and nine the Lord appeared to
[45:22] Abram and said unto him I am the
[45:24] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[45:27] perfect and I will make my Covenant
[45:29] between me and thee and will multiply
[45:31] thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his
[45:33] face and God talked with him saying as
[45:36] for me behold my Covenant is with thee
[45:39] and thou shalt be a father of many
[45:40] nations neither shall thy name any more
[45:43] be called Abram but thy name shall be
[45:45] Abraham for a father of many nations
[45:47] have I made thee and I will make thee
[45:50] exceeding fruitful and I will make
[45:51] nations of thee and Kings shall come out
[45:54] of thee and I will establish my Covenant
[45:56] between me and thee and thy seed after
[46:00] thee in their generations for an
[46:02] Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[46:05] thee and to thy seed after thee and I
[46:08] will give unto thee and to thy seed
[46:10] after thee the land wherein thou art a
[46:12] stranger in all the land of Canaan for
[46:15] an everlasting possession and I will be
[46:18] their God Amen
[46:21] amen this thought tonight I hope I can
[46:24] convey it properly as we go through it
[46:26] it's not meant to to be attacking or
[46:29] even cutting but to serve as a warning
[46:33] or an admonition not to be satisfied
[46:36] with being a message believer
[46:39] not to be satisfied and not to ever rest
[46:42] on our on our works not to take um our
[46:45] calling for granted and not not to rest
[46:48] even in that we are a chosen people not
[46:52] to rest in that but to always be seeking
[46:55] more and looking for more always seeking
[46:57] more Revelation always seeking another
[47:00] outpouring because one thing to me that
[47:03] is a sure sign that you have been called
[47:05] and chosen and had an experience with
[47:07] God is that you're looking for more and
[47:09] you're seeking for more amen so tonight
[47:12] I'd like to speak to us for a little
[47:13] while on
[47:14] the expectations of Pharisees the
[47:19] expectations of Pharisees and and the
[47:22] call of God to Abraham right here and
[47:24] and God's covenant starting right here
[47:28] in chapter 12 seems to be a great
[47:30] um a mark it marks a great turning in
[47:33] the scriptures because back in Chapter 3
[47:36] of Genesis we see the fall and and and
[47:38] and from verse from chapter 3 all the
[47:40] way to chapter 11 humanity is depicted
[47:44] in an almost continual spiral towards
[47:47] sin so from chapter 3 to verse 11 it's
[47:50] this downward spiral but here in chapter
[47:52] 12 we have an introduction of God's plan
[47:56] for a path to Redemption amen and I'm so
[47:59] glad that that path is established and
[48:01] the the Covenant with Abraham is
[48:04] established and and in these
[48:05] interactions these three different
[48:07] interactions that we looked at we we see
[48:09] details of the Covenant began to emerge
[48:12] Abraham is going to be blessed a great
[48:15] nation will come out of the Kings will
[48:17] come out of Thee I will give thee a land
[48:20] I will be a god unto thee and thy seat
[48:22] after thee and I will save thee and thy
[48:24] seed after thee and brother Branham says
[48:26] here God called Abraham out of what that
[48:30] whole world of people why because
[48:32] Abraham was better no sir it's Grace
[48:36] God's chosen election and call you are
[48:40] what you are because the grace of God
[48:42] has made you what you are who taking
[48:45] thought can add one cubit to his stature
[48:48] is that right it's by Grace amen I'm
[48:52] thankful for that tonight that it's
[48:53] Grace it's amazing grace it's nothing
[48:55] that I can do nothing that you can do
[48:57] but God called God chose God elected and
[49:01] tonight I say thank you Lord Jesus for
[49:04] that Amazing Grace amen amen when my
[49:06] nature was against God he called me when
[49:09] I was alienated from God without hope he
[49:12] called me it was nothing I did but he
[49:14] said that one is mine and tonight I'm
[49:17] thankful for that call amen Abraham we
[49:20] see was no better than anyone and God
[49:23] called him and made his Covenant with
[49:25] him unconditional
[49:28] what Grace what Grace to make it
[49:31] unconditional because God took him upon
[49:33] himself that I'm going to make this
[49:35] Covenant and I'm going to keep this
[49:37] Covenant because we found out early on
[49:39] you cannot rely on man time after time
[49:43] man would break the Covenant man would
[49:45] fall away from the Covenant man would
[49:46] forget the Covenant but God said I'm
[49:49] going to do this I'm going to make thee
[49:51] a great nation I'm going to bless you it
[49:53] was all about what he was going to do he
[49:56] didn't put it on me and he didn't put it
[49:57] on you so tonight we can have faith that
[50:00] this is God's word it's God's covenant
[50:03] he's going to bring it to pass in our
[50:05] lives tonight amen he was determined I
[50:09] will save man
[50:11] because man couldn't do it
[50:13] man couldn't keep it man would forget it
[50:17] but God wouldn't
[50:19] amen that's why tonight that we can have
[50:21] faith because it's not our covenant it's
[50:23] not brother Tim's Covenant it wasn't
[50:25] even brother branham's Covenant it's
[50:27] God's covenant this is God's word amen
[50:30] he said I will make of thee a great
[50:33] nation I will establish my Covenant
[50:36] between me and thee he said unto thy
[50:38] seed have I given this lamb he said a
[50:41] father of many nations have I made thee
[50:43] he said I will give unto thee and to thy
[50:47] seed after thee
[50:49] well how am I going to do this Lord I
[50:51] don't even have a son how is this going
[50:54] to be possible how am I going to
[50:56] accomplish all that you're not Abraham
[50:59] I am
[51:01] I am oh how am I going to overcome and
[51:03] let us see how am I going to do this he
[51:05] said I'll have a church without spotter
[51:07] wrinkle how are we going to do it how
[51:09] are we not going to do it we're not
[51:11] going to do it it's his Covenant he said
[51:13] I am I'm going to bring it to pass I
[51:16] will have a church I will have a bride I
[51:19] will give you Victory I will give you
[51:21] the Holy Ghost I will bring a body
[51:23] change it's him doing the work tonight
[51:27] you're not going to have to do this
[51:30] I am amen man couldn't do it never could
[51:34] do it always would break the Covenant so
[51:37] he called and he chose and he elected
[51:41] and he said these are my people and I
[51:45] will bless them and I will keep them
[51:49] many times throughout history we work in
[51:51] the Old Testament we see that they would
[51:53] fall but they were still his people
[51:55] oh that gives me Faith tonight that
[51:58] gives me encouragement tonight they
[51:59] would fall but they were still his
[52:01] people sometimes they were slaves but
[52:03] they were still chosen sometimes they
[52:06] were in a Wilderness but they were still
[52:07] his they were still called and they were
[52:09] elected sometimes you're in a Wilderness
[52:11] sometimes you're in a battle sometimes
[52:13] you don't know which way is up but
[52:15] you're still called You're Still chosen
[52:17] you're still elected you're still his
[52:19] your trial isn't changing that tonight
[52:21] whatever you're going through and
[52:23] changing that tonight you are the called
[52:25] The Chosen you are the Covenant people
[52:28] of Jehovah tonight you are called to it
[52:32] and you're chosen and he's the one
[52:34] holding us amen
[52:37] many times even in their struggles maybe
[52:39] they forgot
[52:41] maybe in their beatings in their
[52:43] whippings in Egypt maybe they forgot
[52:45] in the wilderness they would forgot
[52:48] but he didn't forget
[52:50] he said I have remembered my Covenant
[52:52] with Abraham with eyes that came with
[52:54] Jacob and I have come down to bring them
[52:57] up and what did it all brother Aaron it
[52:59] was Grace marvelous grace Amazing Grace
[53:03] brother Brown says watch when he called
[53:05] Abraham here he called him by election
[53:08] not because he was but because God was
[53:14] and he called him out of his people and
[53:16] blessed him and told him I'm going to
[53:20] save you oh my that's wonderful about
[53:22] Abraham that's wonderful about Abraham
[53:25] all the promises he gave to Abraham
[53:27] Galatians 3 29 and if ye be Christ then
[53:31] ye are Abraham's seed and heirs
[53:34] according to the promise everything he
[53:36] said about Abraham he said about you he
[53:39] said to you and to your seed I'm going
[53:42] to be a God to them has he been a God to
[53:44] us tonight has he been faithful has he
[53:46] seen us through has he fulfilled every
[53:48] promise because this Covenant is God's
[53:52] covenant amen the same promise that he
[53:55] gives to Abraham he gives to you the
[53:58] Royal Seed of Abraham and he says I have
[54:01] remembered
[54:02] oh that makes me feel good tonight I
[54:05] have remembered I haven't forgot you in
[54:07] your situation I haven't forgot you in
[54:10] the trial I haven't forgot my promise
[54:12] over Rapture I haven't forgotten my
[54:14] promise of healing I haven't forgot my
[54:16] promise of a body change I haven't
[54:19] forgot you where you're at but I am come
[54:21] down
[54:22] Hallelujah and just like Israel
[54:25] sometimes we may be sick
[54:27] but we're still chosen sometimes we may
[54:30] be in a dry place but we're still called
[54:32] sometimes we're in a great battle but
[54:35] I'm still his tonight Earthly
[54:37] circumstance and temporary circumstance
[54:39] do not change Eternal things I am an
[54:41] eternal being seen before the foundation
[54:43] of the world my name was written on the
[54:45] Lamb's Book of Life I'm called I'm
[54:48] chosen I'm elected I'm gonna make it
[54:50] because these temporary circumstances do
[54:53] not change
[54:54] Eternal things
[54:57] the Covenant remains true
[54:59] we can Rejoice tonight in that calling
[55:01] we can Rejoice tonight in that choosing
[55:04] I can Rejoice tonight that I have
[55:07] nothing to do with it that is the best
[55:09] part about it because I wouldn't mess it
[55:11] up
[55:12] but I have nothing to do with it Abraham
[55:15] had nothing to do with it it is elective
[55:18] love
[55:19] it is elective love
[55:22] brother Brown says so now it's by grace
[55:24] that God called you not what you did
[55:27] what you could do what you will do if
[55:31] you're the Seed of Abraham God spoke to
[55:33] you by his Amazing Grace just like he
[55:36] did Abraham in the 12th chapter of
[55:38] Genesis and as Abraham was called by
[55:41] Grace by election so was his seed called
[55:44] by grace
[55:46] and election
[55:48] and when God does this when God begins
[55:51] to move on a heart
[55:52] and when God begins to call and comes
[55:55] into Covenant with you just like with
[55:57] Abraham God calls for separation
[56:01] he calls for a separation in your life
[56:03] separation from the world separation
[56:06] from sin and separation from unbelief
[56:08] and and as we follow the Journey of
[56:10] Israel we'll see a people called to be
[56:13] separate
[56:14] just as we are called be ye separate
[56:17] Israel was called to separate and they
[56:20] are separated they don't worship like
[56:22] other nations do
[56:24] they don't live like other nations live
[56:26] things that are acceptable in the world
[56:28] is not acceptable in Israel amen they
[56:32] don't live like other nations and
[56:33] because there is a real and a living God
[56:36] in their midst they live to please him
[56:39] and he goes before them and He blesses
[56:41] them in battle and the whole of Israel
[56:44] is very aware of a living God
[56:47] they are very aware of the supernatural
[56:49] the Supernatural is not foreign to
[56:52] Israel they've witnessed the plagues on
[56:54] Egypt they've seen the waters part
[56:56] they've seen the walls fall down just at
[56:59] the sound of a trumpet
[57:01] they seen God go before them in battle
[57:05] Elijah and Elisha have walked among them
[57:07] the miraculous and the supernatural
[57:10] isn't foreign to them wherever Israel
[57:13] has gone the supernatural has been
[57:15] present the pillar of fire has been
[57:17] amongst them signs and wonders has been
[57:19] there whether it was in Egypt whether it
[57:20] was in the wilderness whether it was in
[57:22] Canaan whether it was in Israel or down
[57:24] in Babylon the supernatural was always
[57:27] present with Israel
[57:30] come on somebody the supernatural should
[57:33] always be present with the Royal Seed of
[57:35] Abraham it doesn't matter that we're in
[57:37] laodicea it doesn't matter that we're in
[57:40] tough conditions it doesn't matter that
[57:41] we're in the Lion's Den the pillar of
[57:44] fire was there the supernatural was
[57:46] always there and they were acquainted
[57:49] and familiar with it
[57:52] and God blesses them and keeps them even
[57:55] in their failures because they're his
[57:58] people
[57:59] they're his people
[58:00] can't you see yourself there tonight
[58:03] can't you relate to what we're talking
[58:04] about with Wilderness experiences dry
[58:07] times
[58:09] hard battles
[58:10] great trials but he was there with you
[58:13] all the time because we're his people he
[58:16] was there leading the way through it all
[58:18] God has been there providing through it
[58:20] all he's been there leading through it
[58:22] always been making a way through it
[58:23] always been healing to sick been
[58:25] restoring families feeling with the Holy
[58:27] Ghost it's an evil time but my God is
[58:30] still moving my God is still on the
[58:32] scene my God is still here and laodicea
[58:34] because we are his people
[58:40] he's never left us
[58:43] Israel was the Covenant people
[58:46] called chosen blessed
[58:50] and they had a promise of a messiah and
[58:52] scriptures that spoke of him the
[58:54] prophets declared him they were wanting
[58:57] to see him
[59:00] but somewhere in the waiting
[59:03] somewhere in the waiting
[59:06] for the coming of the Lord
[59:08] somewhere in the waiting for the Messiah
[59:11] somewhere in the studying and the
[59:13] teaching and the learning
[59:16] the expectations of what God would do
[59:19] and how God would act and how these
[59:20] scriptures would be fulfilled got all
[59:23] twisted up
[59:25] they got disjointed and they got
[59:26] misinterpreted and they got misplaced
[59:28] things that brother Brown said we can
[59:30] never do
[59:32] and they weren't studying to be bad
[59:34] people they weren't reading the prophet
[59:36] to be bad people they loved God they
[59:39] worshiped God they lived good lives but
[59:42] somewhere in the waiting their
[59:43] expectations got off
[59:46] how would God move how does God operate
[59:48] what's he going to do when he comes on
[59:50] the scene
[59:51] somewhere in the waiting it all became
[59:53] intellectual
[59:55] It came it became about how well you
[59:57] could quote the prophets
[1:00:00] it became about how holy you could live
[1:00:02] about how good you could be
[1:00:05] and God's chosen people became arrogant
[1:00:09] in their choosing
[1:00:11] they became arrogant in their calling
[1:00:16] listen sometimes we get to the point
[1:00:18] that we're arrogant in our calling not
[1:00:20] even not even so much as we're in the
[1:00:22] messenger and you're not but sometimes
[1:00:24] even in conversation of oh well this
[1:00:26] happened in this oh what church do they
[1:00:28] go to
[1:00:29] oh that's yeah okay
[1:00:33] you are who you are and you are where
[1:00:35] you are by God's calling and God's
[1:00:37] choosing if you are anything or you
[1:00:39] overcome anything it is God that has
[1:00:41] done it if your eyes are open it's God
[1:00:43] that has done it if you're saved it's
[1:00:45] God that has done it we have no reason
[1:00:47] to be arrogant if anything we should be
[1:00:49] on our knees each and every day thank
[1:00:51] you Jesus I love you Lord why me Lord
[1:00:54] I'm so thankful I'm so grateful it's so
[1:00:56] wonderful Lord of all the people you
[1:00:58] could have chose you chose me I have
[1:01:01] nothing to do with it I was worthless
[1:01:03] I'm a worm but you chose me
[1:01:08] you chose me
[1:01:12] instead of grace and mercy
[1:01:15] instead of an incredible feeling of
[1:01:17] Wonder and thanks that God would choose
[1:01:20] it became
[1:01:21] we are God's chosen people
[1:01:24] we are better than you
[1:01:28] God will come to us and us alone and he
[1:01:30] will only work here and in our Temple
[1:01:32] and in our synagogues
[1:01:37] listen it should thrill our hearts
[1:01:40] each and every day that we are called
[1:01:43] it should thrill our hearts that we are
[1:01:45] chosen we should never lose the Wonder
[1:01:47] of it the joy of it the excitement of it
[1:01:50] the Thanksgiving of it we can never
[1:01:52] allow it to turn into entitlement
[1:01:56] well God's going to take care of me
[1:01:57] because I'm God chosen people
[1:02:00] well God's not going to let anything
[1:02:01] happen to me I'm the bride and and I
[1:02:03] can't be wrong I can't see things wrong
[1:02:05] apparently you can you're seeing it
[1:02:06] wrong already
[1:02:10] yeah we can't allow it to turn into an
[1:02:12] entitlement looking down our nose at
[1:02:15] others because as we said if we are
[1:02:17] anything it's all him if we are anything
[1:02:20] it's all Grace
[1:02:22] and yet through this time of the waiting
[1:02:25] and waiting on the Messiah to come on
[1:02:26] the come on the scene
[1:02:28] they became entitled
[1:02:30] and they bound themselves tight in
[1:02:32] Traditions
[1:02:34] they took truths from the word and used
[1:02:37] it to bind
[1:02:40] anytime the word is used to bind
[1:02:43] anything other than the devil it is
[1:02:45] being misused if you take the word and
[1:02:48] use it against your brother it is being
[1:02:50] misused you take the word and use it to
[1:02:52] bind Worship in the house of God it is
[1:02:54] being misused the only thing we should
[1:02:57] be bonding with the word is the devil
[1:02:59] bonding evil spirits bonding sickness
[1:03:01] bonding the pornography that runs
[1:03:04] rampant bonding depression binding
[1:03:06] anxiety loosing the people of God not
[1:03:09] using the word of God to bind the people
[1:03:11] of God
[1:03:14] but they began to use it to buy not only
[1:03:16] themselves but others
[1:03:19] and it became all about the law and not
[1:03:22] the one who gave the law
[1:03:26] it became about the rules it became
[1:03:28] about the rituals it became about the
[1:03:30] traditions
[1:03:31] and they weren't really looking for the
[1:03:33] Messiah anymore maybe they said they
[1:03:36] were
[1:03:38] they said they were looking for a
[1:03:39] messiah but they had become comfortable
[1:03:41] in their life of rules and traditions
[1:03:44] and Holiness and piety
[1:03:47] they had become comfortable in that
[1:03:49] feeling like they had done enough
[1:03:51] comfortable in their calling comfortable
[1:03:53] in their choosing comfortable that we're
[1:03:55] God's people
[1:03:57] and they began to settle down
[1:03:59] to where they weren't really seeking the
[1:04:01] Messiah anymore they were just looking
[1:04:03] to live their life according to
[1:04:04] Traditions be good be holy be kind do
[1:04:08] what the prophet said
[1:04:10] brother Aaron these don't sound like bad
[1:04:12] things they're not
[1:04:15] they're wonderful things
[1:04:19] they're awesome things be good be kind
[1:04:22] do what the prophet said
[1:04:25] live according to the law of Moses
[1:04:28] but what I see lacking and all that is
[1:04:30] where is the supernatural
[1:04:34] where did they get away from the god
[1:04:36] that that rained down plagues on Egypt
[1:04:38] where did they get away from the god
[1:04:40] that opened the Red Sea where did they
[1:04:42] get away from the god that fed them man
[1:04:44] and the rock that followed them in the
[1:04:46] wilderness where did they get away from
[1:04:48] that God to where they no longer
[1:04:49] expected those things to happen and
[1:04:52] their expectations became cold their
[1:04:54] expectations became formal their
[1:04:56] expectations became tradition their
[1:04:58] expectation became Wednesday and Sunday
[1:05:01] church
[1:05:03] when did it change
[1:05:06] in the waiting for the Messiah
[1:05:10] in the delay
[1:05:12] as they waited for him to come
[1:05:15] they had seen him move on their behalf
[1:05:17] Time After Time
[1:05:19] but at some point they quit expecting
[1:05:21] God to move like that anymore
[1:05:24] at some point it became all about the
[1:05:27] word
[1:05:29] oh brother Aaron that's a dangerous
[1:05:31] statement we'll get there I have quotes
[1:05:33] for it
[1:05:34] it became all about the word
[1:05:37] study the word live the word study the
[1:05:39] word study the word get in the word I
[1:05:40] can put a pin through a scroll and tell
[1:05:42] you what words it hit because I studied
[1:05:44] the word I studied the word it's all
[1:05:45] about the word
[1:05:49] at some point it became all about the
[1:05:51] prophet's message
[1:05:55] what do you mean where you want the
[1:05:57] message but not the Fulfillment of that
[1:06:00] message they didn't want the Fulfillment
[1:06:02] of the Old Testament they wanted the Old
[1:06:04] Testament and we got people that love
[1:06:06] the quotes and they love the tapes and
[1:06:08] they love the books but they don't want
[1:06:10] the Fulfillment of the message they
[1:06:12] don't want the message with skin on it
[1:06:14] but I'm here to declare it's too bad
[1:06:16] because here we are this is the
[1:06:19] Fulfillment of the message you are the
[1:06:21] message this is what it was called to
[1:06:24] produce Jesus again on the earth they
[1:06:26] didn't like him showing up then they
[1:06:28] don't like you showing up now but here
[1:06:31] we are it's too late we are the
[1:06:34] Fulfillment it came off the pages it
[1:06:37] came off the tapes and here it is
[1:06:43] I'm sorry if I disappoint you you don't
[1:06:46] always just make me thrilled either but
[1:06:48] here we are
[1:06:50] it is what it is
[1:06:53] somebody has to fulfill the word
[1:06:59] at some point it just became going to
[1:07:01] synagogue
[1:07:03] and believe God sent a prophet know the
[1:07:05] Mysteries claim the message live clean
[1:07:07] and holy and you're going in a rapture
[1:07:11] I hate to tell you but that's not the
[1:07:13] truth
[1:07:18] but brother Aaron aren't all those
[1:07:19] things good things yes
[1:07:22] they're wonderful things
[1:07:25] but somewhere in our waiting our
[1:07:27] expectations have gotten off
[1:07:30] I want to tell you tonight he still
[1:07:31] moves the way he's always moved he still
[1:07:34] heals the way he's always healed he
[1:07:37] still saves the way he always saved and
[1:07:39] he still feels with the baptism of the
[1:07:42] Holy Ghost the way he always has and
[1:07:45] that is the expectation of the broad
[1:07:47] we're not stopping short of the new
[1:07:50] birth what do we got to have the new
[1:07:52] birth the Holy Ghost the token and
[1:07:54] without it you are lost
[1:07:58] but I live the rules I listen the tapes
[1:08:00] I come to church I worship I'm glad you
[1:08:03] do but are you born again
[1:08:05] have you had the new birth have you had
[1:08:08] that experience
[1:08:10] that is our expectation nothing short of
[1:08:13] that
[1:08:14] anything less than that is the
[1:08:16] expectation of the Pharisees
[1:08:23] it's not it's not to be our expectation
[1:08:25] is it to be just just a good life
[1:08:28] our expectation isn't to be that we're
[1:08:31] just different from others
[1:08:33] our expectation isn't is it satisfied
[1:08:36] and God called me
[1:08:39] you're not saved in your calling
[1:08:42] are you born again
[1:08:46] brother Brown says certainly those
[1:08:48] Pharisees and Sadducees why they know
[1:08:50] more about the word than any of our
[1:08:53] Scholars will ever know
[1:08:56] but they didn't know Jesus
[1:09:03] he says to know the word is not life
[1:09:13] I'm gonna say that again to know the
[1:09:15] word is not life this is your prophet
[1:09:19] to know your catechisms is not life to
[1:09:23] know your church doctrine is not life
[1:09:25] but to know him is life do you know him
[1:09:29] the prophet says and I Echo that tonight
[1:09:32] do you know him I'm not asking do you
[1:09:34] believe the message I'm not asking are
[1:09:36] you a good person I'm not asking how
[1:09:38] much you come to church I'm asking you
[1:09:40] do you know him tonight do you know
[1:09:42] Jesus have you met him for yourself have
[1:09:45] you had the new birth that is our
[1:09:47] expectation that is our calling that is
[1:09:50] our Victory the new birth
[1:09:57] John 3 and 3 Jesus answered and said
[1:09:59] unto him verily verily I say unto thee
[1:10:01] except a man be born again he cannot
[1:10:05] see the kingdom of God
[1:10:07] we have to keep our expectations right
[1:10:11] the expectation isn't just good kids
[1:10:16] the expectation isn't just good morals
[1:10:18] and good homes
[1:10:19] the expectation is when Jesus comes
[1:10:22] lives are changed there is a new birth
[1:10:25] and there is a life that is filled with
[1:10:27] the Holy Ghost
[1:10:29] but I'll tell you where the problem is
[1:10:31] the problem comes from the top down the
[1:10:33] people's expectations are wrong because
[1:10:35] it ain't preached right
[1:10:38] it's from the top down if we don't
[1:10:39] preach the new birth if we don't preach
[1:10:41] the supernatural then how can we blame
[1:10:43] the people when they don't accept it
[1:10:45] when they don't have it I'll tell you
[1:10:47] the problem is a lot of weak pulpits
[1:10:50] it is our responsibility to declare
[1:10:52] truth you will not make it without the
[1:10:55] new birth you must have the experience
[1:10:58] you must meet him for yourself you must
[1:11:00] be sealed with the Holy Ghost God does
[1:11:02] still move like he always did he still
[1:11:05] feels he still heals he still delivers
[1:11:07] he is the same may it always be declared
[1:11:10] in this church may it always be declared
[1:11:12] from this Pulpit you will be without
[1:11:14] excuse because we're here to tell you he
[1:11:17] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:11:25] if we don't preach the supernatural in
[1:11:27] our midst then we don't expect it
[1:11:30] then we don't get it
[1:11:32] and we miss it
[1:11:35] preachers Dads Moms
[1:11:39] leaders
[1:11:42] what are our expectations
[1:11:45] what are we striving to see in our lives
[1:11:49] what is it that you want to see in your
[1:11:51] children's lives
[1:11:53] what are your expectations for this
[1:11:55] service tonight what did you expect when
[1:11:57] you came here or did you even give it a
[1:11:59] thought
[1:12:01] have you slipped into the pharisaic
[1:12:03] mindset of we're just going to church
[1:12:05] this is what we do did you even think
[1:12:07] about the service
[1:12:10] are you here just because it's Wednesday
[1:12:11] and that's what we do
[1:12:13] I'm thankful for that because there's a
[1:12:15] lot of people that this is Wednesday and
[1:12:16] it's what we do and they didn't show up
[1:12:19] at least you got them beat
[1:12:21] today
[1:12:24] I had to be here I'm kidding
[1:12:28] sure we come to church it is what we do
[1:12:30] sure it is
[1:12:32] we're coming no matter what but we
[1:12:35] should come with expectations
[1:12:38] we should come expecting something from
[1:12:40] God are you expecting him to move
[1:12:42] tonight are you expecting the Rapture to
[1:12:44] come tomorrow
[1:12:46] are you expecting it
[1:12:48] are you expecting a new birth
[1:12:50] what do we and here's where we can look
[1:12:52] at our expectations where have we gotten
[1:12:55] to where what is it that allows us to
[1:12:58] classify someone as a believer
[1:13:04] because they accept that God sent a
[1:13:06] prophet oh there are they
[1:13:08] have we lowered our expectations
[1:13:12] what is a Christian
[1:13:15] what is an overcomer
[1:13:17] have we allowed those things to fall off
[1:13:19] we said where did Israel get off I say
[1:13:22] where did we get off
[1:13:24] where did our expectations change
[1:13:27] in the waiting
[1:13:30] in the waiting
[1:13:33] listen at Pentecost they knew that they
[1:13:36] had to be endued from Power with power
[1:13:38] from on high
[1:13:39] in the first age they knew that they had
[1:13:42] to be born again and they expected it
[1:13:44] and they got it
[1:13:47] but even there that was the expectation
[1:13:51] in the first age but even there
[1:13:53] somewhere they allowed the expectations
[1:13:55] to change in that first age
[1:13:58] it became about church attendance it
[1:14:00] became about a form of godliness
[1:14:02] coldness crept in Services became formal
[1:14:05] ceremony form rituals and works took the
[1:14:09] place of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:13] don't let our expectation change
[1:14:17] don't let our standards come down
[1:14:20] God still moves
[1:14:23] God still requires the token
[1:14:25] and if God still requires the token I'm
[1:14:28] here to tell you he still gives the
[1:14:29] token
[1:14:30] he doesn't require something that he
[1:14:32] won't give you he requires it but he's
[1:14:34] here tonight going yes I require it yes
[1:14:36] you'll never make it without it but here
[1:14:38] I am saying you can have it it's yours I
[1:14:40] still pour it out I still move in
[1:14:42] Services just like this
[1:14:45] I still take somebody that's been
[1:14:47] sitting there 25 years and sitting on a
[1:14:49] bench called informal and filling with
[1:14:51] the Holy Ghost I still do it
[1:15:01] when did it become a dress code
[1:15:03] in a list of rules and Hyper legalism
[1:15:08] when did it become just know the word
[1:15:12] listen Israel's expectations had lowered
[1:15:14] and it was no longer a living God
[1:15:18] but it just became a god of the prophets
[1:15:20] from days gone by
[1:15:23] and now we just have to try to live holy
[1:15:26] just try to live according to what the
[1:15:27] scripture says and in all that they miss
[1:15:29] him
[1:15:31] and all that he walks right amongst them
[1:15:33] and they miss him
[1:15:35] how many times can he walk right amongst
[1:15:37] us and we miss him
[1:15:39] because we're not expecting him
[1:15:43] you know how it is when you're not
[1:15:44] expecting company and all since my bangs
[1:15:47] on the door
[1:15:48] who is that who's coming my house ain't
[1:15:50] ready
[1:15:51] ain't nothing
[1:15:53] everything's in disarray I mean not at
[1:15:56] my house I'm just talking about like
[1:15:56] y'all's house
[1:16:03] you know how it is but if you're
[1:16:05] expecting him to move
[1:16:07] then you recognize here he comes I see
[1:16:10] him coming down the driveway I already
[1:16:12] got it ready I'm waiting for him I'm
[1:16:13] opening the door come on in come on and
[1:16:16] move on my life move on my heart in this
[1:16:18] service deliver me tonight move from my
[1:16:21] family tonight well how come stuff's
[1:16:23] always happening for this one and not
[1:16:24] when they're expecting it to happen and
[1:16:27] they open the front door and they say
[1:16:29] come in and move in my life come in and
[1:16:32] move in my home
[1:16:34] and so guess what he does it he does it
[1:16:38] because they expect him to it's not a
[1:16:41] hope so they're looking for him
[1:16:47] they became so sure of their calling
[1:16:50] so arrogant that they were chosen
[1:16:53] so confident in their superb knowledge
[1:16:56] their knowledge of the word that they
[1:16:58] couldn't be taught
[1:17:01] I mean what Revelation could you give
[1:17:03] them
[1:17:04] think about what could you have told a
[1:17:06] Pharisee imagine trying to witness to
[1:17:08] one
[1:17:12] you could not have said anything that he
[1:17:14] didn't either a correct you
[1:17:16] or B say yeah I know that
[1:17:20] that's exactly what it says
[1:17:22] what Revelation could you give them
[1:17:25] what Supernatural could persuade them
[1:17:29] they didn't need the supernatural
[1:17:31] because they had
[1:17:32] the word
[1:17:36] brother Brown says when Jesus came he
[1:17:37] was just as fundamental as the Pharisees
[1:17:40] listen to this
[1:17:42] the Pharisees couldn't believe it but
[1:17:45] Jesus was fundamental but there were
[1:17:47] signs and wonders following his ministry
[1:17:50] where the Pharisees had the word just
[1:17:53] the same as he had
[1:17:59] now the Pharisees were off no they was
[1:18:01] no they weren't off
[1:18:04] matter of fact they were spot on
[1:18:10] they had the word just the same as he
[1:18:12] had
[1:18:13] but it's a spiritual revelation
[1:18:18] and they couldn't be led
[1:18:20] when people become so supremely
[1:18:22] confident in their works
[1:18:25] so supremely confident in their
[1:18:27] knowledge
[1:18:29] when they are confident that there is
[1:18:31] nothing outside their interpretation
[1:18:33] then they reject the leadership of the
[1:18:36] spirit
[1:18:39] because we've got it figured out
[1:18:41] we live so holy look I haven't cut my
[1:18:43] hair since I was born my skirts touched
[1:18:46] the floor I've never said a curse word I
[1:18:48] pray three times a day I've never missed
[1:18:50] a service
[1:18:52] and are you born again
[1:18:57] that's what I want to know I don't care
[1:18:58] about your works
[1:19:01] now if you're born again The Works will
[1:19:02] follow
[1:19:10] he says in the first time that the
[1:19:13] church lets their leaders take over to
[1:19:15] lead the people the Holy Spirit gets
[1:19:18] right away from them and the very first
[1:19:20] time that you go being led by man
[1:19:22] instead of God the holy spirit will get
[1:19:24] away from you too
[1:19:25] let the Holy Spirit lead that's what we
[1:19:29] need as leadership and God gave us a
[1:19:31] leader and we don't hear it
[1:19:35] listen Revelation is of the utmost
[1:19:37] importance
[1:19:39] brother Branham deals with a lot in the
[1:19:41] church age book where he says you could
[1:19:43] never pray too much for revelation
[1:19:46] you could never ask for too much
[1:19:48] Revelation because your knowledge won't
[1:19:51] do it
[1:19:53] I don't care how much you read how much
[1:19:55] you study how many sermons you listen to
[1:19:57] you will never even be in the same
[1:19:58] ballpark with the Pharisees
[1:20:01] you would not even be able to sit down
[1:20:03] and have an intelligent religious
[1:20:05] conversation with them
[1:20:08] and what good did it do them
[1:20:12] because there was no spirit
[1:20:14] and there was no revelation
[1:20:17] brother Brown says no one can doubt but
[1:20:20] the scribes and Pharisees and the great
[1:20:21] Scholars of the Year 33 A.D knew the
[1:20:24] exact laws of grammar and the exact
[1:20:26] meaning of the words in which the Old
[1:20:27] Testament was written but for all their
[1:20:29] superb knowledge they missed the
[1:20:31] revelation of God's promised word
[1:20:33] manifested in the Sun
[1:20:35] there he was set forth from Genesis to
[1:20:37] Malachi with whole chapters devoted to
[1:20:40] him and his ministry and yet except for
[1:20:43] a few who were illuminated by the spirit
[1:20:47] they missed him
[1:20:48] entirely
[1:20:52] and tonight the holy spirit's trying to
[1:20:53] illuminate you and say don't go the way
[1:20:56] of the Pharisees
[1:20:59] called
[1:21:01] so were the Pharisees
[1:21:02] they were
[1:21:05] they were the Covenant people and they
[1:21:07] knew it
[1:21:08] called chosen God's people Covenant
[1:21:12] people Supreme knowledge holy life
[1:21:15] and missed it
[1:21:19] and we want to point to our
[1:21:20] righteousness and how good we live and
[1:21:22] why we're better than somebody else in
[1:21:24] the church because of their struggles
[1:21:25] and their ups and their failures
[1:21:32] you know we often look at the Pharisees
[1:21:34] as the bad guys when we read the the
[1:21:37] Bible because of what we read about them
[1:21:38] in the New Testament and truly that
[1:21:40] they're not the protagonist of the story
[1:21:42] there's there's no doubt
[1:21:44] as it relates to to Jesus and in his
[1:21:47] crucifixion yes they are the bad guys
[1:21:52] but to me they serve as a great
[1:21:53] cautionary story because of how close
[1:21:56] they are
[1:21:58] to us
[1:22:01] oh and they're the bad guys as a matter
[1:22:02] of fact you are of your father
[1:22:05] the devil
[1:22:08] and yet how close they are in the
[1:22:11] parallels that you can see between them
[1:22:14] and us
[1:22:16] we are the Covenant people Royal Seed of
[1:22:18] Abraham
[1:22:19] and listen I believe we will not fall
[1:22:21] the prophet of God said we're
[1:22:23] predestinated not to fall
[1:22:25] but we can't sit back in the world we're
[1:22:27] called and we're chosen so we're going
[1:22:29] to make an attitude no sir that's not
[1:22:31] the attitude the attitude is I will take
[1:22:32] more today I will progress more today I
[1:22:35] will learn more today I will be
[1:22:37] revelated more today I will seek more of
[1:22:39] the Holy Spirit today not I'm called and
[1:22:41] chosen so here we go
[1:22:44] we can't settle because we're chosen
[1:22:47] and I want to look at the Pharisees for
[1:22:49] for a minute a little closer maybe we
[1:22:51] can get a different idea about who they
[1:22:53] were
[1:22:55] just to be a little historical for a
[1:22:57] second
[1:23:00] they were the Covenant people
[1:23:02] and they knew it
[1:23:04] they could even look at our opening
[1:23:06] scriptures that we read tonight
[1:23:08] and see who they were and that they were
[1:23:10] God's people
[1:23:11] the Pharisees emerged around 150 BCE and
[1:23:15] promoted the idea of Priestly Purity for
[1:23:18] all Jews
[1:23:20] they believe that their life and their
[1:23:22] worship to God should extend beyond the
[1:23:25] temple
[1:23:26] they did not believe in Sunday Wednesday
[1:23:28] religion
[1:23:30] they believed you should live for God
[1:23:32] each and every day not just in the
[1:23:34] temple that Holiness and piety wasn't
[1:23:37] just for the priest but it was for
[1:23:39] everyone even the common people man
[1:23:41] these guys sound terrible don't they
[1:23:46] the Pharisees were of the Common People
[1:23:51] the Pharisees included people of all
[1:23:53] classes in all professions
[1:23:56] Pharisees were in a sense blue-collar
[1:23:58] Jews who adhered to such things as
[1:24:01] individual prayer and assembling
[1:24:04] themselves together in synagogues
[1:24:07] can't disagree with them on anything yet
[1:24:11] this put them at Great odds with the
[1:24:14] Sadducees who were comprised of priests
[1:24:16] and social Elites and were responsible
[1:24:19] for maintaining the temple they believed
[1:24:21] that Temple worship was all that
[1:24:23] mattered
[1:24:25] so already the Pharisees got to step up
[1:24:27] on the Sadducees as far as I'm concerned
[1:24:29] Sadducees just as long as you sacrifice
[1:24:31] you can live how you won't do what you
[1:24:33] want don't matter this is all that
[1:24:34] matters that was their attitude
[1:24:37] they were elitist who wanted to maintain
[1:24:40] the Priestly cast but they were also
[1:24:42] liberal talking about the Sadducees in
[1:24:45] their willingness to incorporate
[1:24:46] Hellenism into their lives Hellenism was
[1:24:50] Greek culture
[1:24:52] they were all about bringing the culture
[1:24:54] of the world into the church
[1:24:58] the very rise of the Pharisees was to
[1:25:01] combat the Greek effort to hellenize the
[1:25:04] Jews in other words to make the Jews
[1:25:07] conform to the modern culture that's the
[1:25:10] very reason that that people stood up
[1:25:12] and said we're not going to take this
[1:25:14] this is not what we're about because all
[1:25:16] the Jews began to love Greek culture and
[1:25:18] they were quickly giving over to it they
[1:25:20] were accepting Pagan rituals they were
[1:25:23] worshiping many gods just like the
[1:25:24] Greeks and the Sadducees were just going
[1:25:27] along with it
[1:25:28] the Sadducees were just living this
[1:25:30] lukewarm kind of Life letting the world
[1:25:32] creep in acting like the world
[1:25:33] worshiping like the world living like
[1:25:35] the world and a group began to rise up
[1:25:38] that saw corruption in the temple they
[1:25:40] saw corruption in the worship they saw
[1:25:43] lies that were slipping away from a true
[1:25:45] dedication to Jehovah and they said we
[1:25:47] must stand for truth
[1:25:49] we can't stand for this this isn't what
[1:25:51] God called us to be God called us to be
[1:25:54] separated God called us to be holy God
[1:25:57] called us not to fit in with the world
[1:25:59] and they said we're going to stand for
[1:26:01] truth no matter what the cost no matter
[1:26:03] if Society it kicks us out no matter
[1:26:05] what we have to give up if we're
[1:26:07] rejected we will not go with this modern
[1:26:10] Greek culture
[1:26:12] and they stood for truth
[1:26:16] and they look to the Covenant
[1:26:18] and the god when God made the Covenant
[1:26:21] he told Abraham separate
[1:26:24] and so they looked there and they saw
[1:26:25] that
[1:26:27] and they point back to the original back
[1:26:30] to Abraham and they recognize this isn't
[1:26:32] how Abraham lived
[1:26:33] he separated
[1:26:36] and they become known as Pharisees which
[1:26:39] comes from the word parisha which means
[1:26:42] separated ones
[1:26:46] these were the people who stood for
[1:26:49] truth they were the outcast who wouldn't
[1:26:51] go with the world
[1:26:53] and they stood up and said no
[1:26:55] Abraham was a separated one
[1:26:58] we're going to be separated once
[1:27:01] what terrible people
[1:27:06] they began to teach the importance of
[1:27:08] staying in the word
[1:27:11] of all the sects of Judaism they alone
[1:27:13] remain separated from the ways of
[1:27:15] foreign influence invading their lives
[1:27:17] in religious practice
[1:27:19] the Pharisees also maintained that there
[1:27:21] was an afterlife the Sadducees did not
[1:27:24] believe in any afterlife whatsoever
[1:27:27] the Pharisees taught there is a record
[1:27:29] there is a resurrection
[1:27:30] there is an afterlife he taught that God
[1:27:34] punished they taught that God punished
[1:27:36] the wicked and rewarded the righteous in
[1:27:38] the world to come
[1:27:40] they also believed in a coming Messiah
[1:27:42] which the Sadducees did not
[1:27:45] they studied and read and prayed so much
[1:27:48] that they gained the reputation of being
[1:27:51] experts in the law it wasn't what they
[1:27:53] were trying to do they were just in the
[1:27:55] word so much so that was the reputation
[1:27:57] that they gained
[1:27:59] they began to see themselves as experts
[1:28:02] in the law and over time in the waiting
[1:28:05] in their stand for truth in the Holding
[1:28:08] Out for the Messiah they began to trust
[1:28:11] in their goodness
[1:28:14] in their holiness
[1:28:17] you better not be trusting in your
[1:28:19] Holiness tonight
[1:28:21] you better not be trusting in your
[1:28:23] goodness tonight
[1:28:25] you better not be trusting in how clean
[1:28:26] you live
[1:28:28] you better not be making this message
[1:28:29] about do's and don'ts
[1:28:31] because you can never compare to the
[1:28:33] goodness and the Holiness of the
[1:28:35] Pharisees you'll never touch them
[1:28:38] brother Brown says you may be a member
[1:28:40] of a church that don't mean one thing
[1:28:41] you say well I live a good clean life
[1:28:44] that still don't mean one thing to God
[1:28:46] who could be any cleaner who could be
[1:28:48] any more holy speaking than those
[1:28:50] Pharisees was in that day
[1:28:54] they were blameless
[1:28:57] blameless
[1:28:59] brother Brown says as far as Holiness
[1:29:00] while they would make the Holiness
[1:29:02] Church today feel ashamed of themselves
[1:29:05] when it come to holiness
[1:29:07] they really had to live holy they lived
[1:29:10] separated consecrated lives
[1:29:14] so I tell you tonight that if
[1:29:15] righteousness was all that God required
[1:29:17] the Pharisees would be first in line
[1:29:20] the Pharisees would have it over on all
[1:29:22] of us they held on and they held on and
[1:29:25] they believed and they fought for the
[1:29:27] truth and they stood for righteousness
[1:29:30] brother Brown says those Pharisees
[1:29:32] believed in many things to be the truth
[1:29:34] now here's the turn
[1:29:36] they said we are God's children
[1:29:39] brother Brown says and they were
[1:29:41] until that word was preached
[1:29:47] but when that word was preached and
[1:29:49] Vindicated then they become sinners
[1:29:52] for rejecting the thing that they knowed
[1:29:54] was right
[1:29:56] and witnessed it we know thou art a
[1:29:58] teacher come from God for no man can do
[1:30:00] the things that you do without God being
[1:30:03] with you
[1:30:05] the Pharisees
[1:30:06] were far from being wrong
[1:30:09] as a matter of fact they were right
[1:30:12] until they rejected him truth
[1:30:16] they were fighting to protect the truth
[1:30:19] then why did they fight against Jesus
[1:30:22] because it wasn't what they expected
[1:30:27] it was contrary to their interpretation
[1:30:29] of what the prophet had said notice it
[1:30:30] wasn't contrary to what the prophet said
[1:30:32] it was contrary to the interpretation
[1:30:34] that they felt that that the prophet had
[1:30:36] said
[1:30:37] and their entire attack against Jesus
[1:30:40] was a desire to protect the truth and in
[1:30:43] their desire to protect the people and
[1:30:45] protect the truth and stand for the word
[1:30:48] they fought against the very thing they
[1:30:50] had to have
[1:30:52] oh we see it all the time
[1:30:54] in a desire to protect the people in a
[1:30:57] desire we don't want any any Wildfire
[1:31:00] loose in the church
[1:31:01] we don't want any moving of the spirit
[1:31:02] we don't want any of those gifts any
[1:31:04] desire to protect the people just in
[1:31:05] case what if it isn't what if it isn't
[1:31:07] real what if it's this and they're
[1:31:09] afraid of the very thing they need to
[1:31:10] bring life into the church they become
[1:31:13] afraid of the new birth and the very
[1:31:14] thing that they have to have they fight
[1:31:16] against
[1:31:17] the very thing that gives them a chance
[1:31:19] to overcome this world that gives them
[1:31:22] opportunity to Rapture they fight
[1:31:23] against it
[1:31:25] they stand for the truth they fight for
[1:31:27] the truth and they're scared of the new
[1:31:28] birth
[1:31:30] and get so scared of the moving of the
[1:31:32] spirit so scared so scared of everything
[1:31:37] we've got to protect the people
[1:31:39] scared that the supernatural might be
[1:31:41] out of place
[1:31:42] listen they will never deny that the
[1:31:44] supernatural operating in brother
[1:31:46] branham's Ministry they will never deny
[1:31:48] the supernatural of the past and yet
[1:31:50] question every single aspect of the
[1:31:52] supernatural in the now
[1:31:56] well I don't know about all that brother
[1:31:58] Aaron I don't know if all that's
[1:31:59] necessary just stay with the word that's
[1:32:02] exactly what the Pharisees did they just
[1:32:04] stayed with the word
[1:32:11] according to to the rabbis
[1:32:13] to disbelieve any Miracle recognized as
[1:32:15] such in the Old Testament now hear me to
[1:32:19] disbelieve any Miracle recognized as
[1:32:22] such in the Old Testament according to
[1:32:24] the Pharisees incurred the greatest
[1:32:26] possible punishment which was the loss
[1:32:29] of one's portion in the world to come
[1:32:31] if you disbelieved or doubted one of the
[1:32:34] Miracles recorded in the Old Testament
[1:32:36] doubted or disbelieved your portion in
[1:32:39] the next world was wiped away
[1:32:43] my goodness
[1:32:45] they believed in that Supernatural
[1:32:48] however disbelief in a post-biblical
[1:32:51] miracle which for them was post-old
[1:32:54] Testament
[1:32:55] incurs no punishment at all
[1:32:58] that spirit's never died
[1:33:00] oh yeah you better believe that those
[1:33:03] miracles in brother branham's they were
[1:33:04] the truth
[1:33:05] absolutely that was the truth you better
[1:33:07] believe God used to do that you better
[1:33:09] believe he used to do that but if you
[1:33:10] don't believe he does it today that's
[1:33:12] okay
[1:33:13] that's no big deal but you better
[1:33:15] believe back then you better believe God
[1:33:17] could you better believe God used to
[1:33:20] well could and used to does me no good I
[1:33:22] need God right now and I believe he
[1:33:25] still does he still will and he still is
[1:33:28] doing the same thing tonight that he did
[1:33:31] back there I choose to believe right now
[1:33:33] for my life right here in this moment
[1:33:38] why would I want to choose to believe he
[1:33:40] no longer does it
[1:33:42] he still does it
[1:33:47] says for the religious leaders of the
[1:33:49] day a supernatural feat no matter how
[1:33:52] impressive would not have any sway in a
[1:33:55] religious discussion
[1:33:58] no wonder that they didn't care what
[1:34:00] Jesus did
[1:34:02] no matter how great the miracle it would
[1:34:04] have no sway in a religious discussion
[1:34:09] whenever Miracles made their appearance
[1:34:12] trying to interfere with legal matters
[1:34:14] of the talmud
[1:34:16] they were for the most part rejected
[1:34:20] notice they didn't care that the man got
[1:34:22] healed they were just mad that he was
[1:34:23] healed on the Sabbath
[1:34:25] the miracle didn't matter you messed
[1:34:27] with the law
[1:34:29] the manifestation that he that he says I
[1:34:31] am the Lord thy God that healeth thee
[1:34:33] didn't matter you did it on the wrong
[1:34:34] day
[1:34:37] well I don't care that people got healed
[1:34:38] in that prayer line did you see how they
[1:34:40] acted
[1:34:42] people getting filled yeah people got
[1:34:43] the Holy Ghost but did you see those
[1:34:45] people running all over the building
[1:34:46] shouting and screaming I know people got
[1:34:48] delivered but are we supposed to act
[1:34:50] like that in church
[1:34:51] you Pharisee
[1:34:58] people gaining eternal life and you want
[1:35:01] to nitpick the service that they got it
[1:35:03] in instead of praising God and saying
[1:35:06] thank you Jesus that you saved somebody
[1:35:08] thank you Jesus that you healed somebody
[1:35:10] thank you Jesus that you delivered
[1:35:13] somebody let our expectations be of a
[1:35:16] God that still moves and still operates
[1:35:19] and still heals and still delivers
[1:35:27] what are our expectations for a service
[1:35:31] what are we wanting When We Gather how
[1:35:34] much are we willing to let God move when
[1:35:36] it's outside your understanding or
[1:35:38] interpretation of what church order is
[1:35:43] the Pharisees expectations of how the
[1:35:46] Messiah would conduct himself hindered
[1:35:49] them from being able to receive him
[1:35:51] well the Messiah wouldn't do this
[1:35:54] well the Messiah wouldn't do that
[1:35:57] and they sure didn't like the way people
[1:35:59] worshiped when the Messiah came around
[1:36:00] Pharisees will always
[1:36:04] be the one saying tell the people to
[1:36:07] hold their peace
[1:36:11] and Jesus said if the people hold their
[1:36:13] peace that the rocks will cry out listen
[1:36:15] what brother Brown says that's the way
[1:36:17] today when the congregation is gathered
[1:36:19] together that foreshadow of his
[1:36:22] appearing the Holy Spirit began to
[1:36:23] breathe on them they see those signs and
[1:36:26] wonders performed of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:27] they can't hold their peace something is
[1:36:31] going to cry out
[1:36:33] why were they so against the shouting
[1:36:36] why were they so against the yelling
[1:36:38] because they didn't recognize him as God
[1:36:42] had they recognized that it was God they
[1:36:44] would have acted the same way why are
[1:36:47] people so against that shouting and
[1:36:49] running and dancing and screaming in the
[1:36:51] house of God they don't recognize it's
[1:36:53] the holy spirit in our midst
[1:36:56] if they did they would do the same thing
[1:37:01] I know we've covered it we've covered
[1:37:03] we're not all going to act and worship
[1:37:05] exactly the same I understand that but
[1:37:07] you would worship with all your heart
[1:37:08] how about that
[1:37:10] there's no way that right now you could
[1:37:12] truly believe that Jesus Christ is in
[1:37:14] this room
[1:37:15] and not be all in
[1:37:20] if you're not all in it's because you
[1:37:21] don't believe he's here
[1:37:28] brother Brown says certainly it is
[1:37:32] now listen
[1:37:33] some people say it's just all emotion
[1:37:36] brother Brown says certainly it is it's
[1:37:38] something present and it is true that
[1:37:41] when the Holy Ghost comes down it stirs
[1:37:44] the crowd to emotion
[1:37:48] so you are exactly right it is all
[1:37:50] emotion now let's get into why it's all
[1:37:52] emotion because the Holy Spirit has come
[1:37:54] down and it has stirred the crowd to
[1:37:57] emotion
[1:37:59] they're setting there Anointed with the
[1:38:01] spirit of God and the Holy Ghost sweeps
[1:38:04] across them it stirs emotions it's got
[1:38:08] to
[1:38:12] he said it's got to so if you sit there
[1:38:16] emotionalists all the time
[1:38:19] I don't know what you're going to do
[1:38:20] with that
[1:38:23] because he says when the holy spirit
[1:38:24] moves on you it's got
[1:38:26] to stir your emotions
[1:38:30] I had a guy tell me one time after a
[1:38:32] service I don't even got to describe it
[1:38:34] to you as one of those Services you know
[1:38:36] what I'm talking about one of those
[1:38:37] Services we got freed and up up in here
[1:38:41] and afterwards he says well I didn't
[1:38:43] feel anything
[1:38:44] like everybody else was feeling
[1:38:46] obviously I watched them running and
[1:38:48] jumping and shot and feel a thing I mean
[1:38:50] it was a good service and all by that
[1:38:52] field nothing
[1:38:54] well certainly you didn't I wouldn't
[1:38:56] expect you to
[1:38:58] because you reviewing Jesus coming
[1:39:00] through the building the same way the
[1:39:02] Pharisees viewed him coming in riding on
[1:39:04] the coat
[1:39:06] you didn't recognize he was in the
[1:39:08] building
[1:39:12] you approached it the same way as they
[1:39:14] did in order to fill
[1:39:17] let me tell you something in order to
[1:39:19] feel it you've got to be in the spirit
[1:39:20] of worship like the ones who were
[1:39:22] shouting Hosanna
[1:39:24] brother Branham says this listen
[1:39:27] God likes to be worshiped and when you
[1:39:30] worship Him it just isn't exactly
[1:39:32] singing a song as we do
[1:39:35] but singing it in the spirit of worship
[1:39:38] you see and then you feel the Holy
[1:39:41] Spirit bounce back
[1:39:44] well I never feel anything well then I
[1:39:46] ask you how are you worshiping
[1:39:50] then you feel the Holy Spirit
[1:39:53] listen we spent a lot of time a few
[1:39:55] weeks ago and I'm about to be bringing
[1:39:56] this to a close but we spent a lot of
[1:39:58] time a few weeks ago talking about how
[1:40:00] it ain't in the run and jumping shouting
[1:40:02] dancing that none of that meant you were
[1:40:03] saved
[1:40:04] I'm gonna jump on the other side for
[1:40:06] just a minute you're perfectly clean
[1:40:08] Pious and holy perfect Church attendance
[1:40:11] life doesn't mean you're saved either
[1:40:17] you must
[1:40:18] be born
[1:40:20] again
[1:40:26] bringing this down
[1:40:28] just because you believe the message
[1:40:30] you're not saved
[1:40:31] because you live clean because you live
[1:40:33] holy and righteous listen your humility
[1:40:36] this is one that people love they're so
[1:40:39] humble that person's so humble your
[1:40:42] humility means nothing
[1:40:46] I read a quote today if you want to look
[1:40:48] it up you can it is there where brother
[1:40:50] Branham said the Pharisees were twice as
[1:40:53] humble as Jesus was
[1:41:00] they're so humble and
[1:41:04] good I guess
[1:41:06] are you born again
[1:41:10] that's the question
[1:41:12] that's what matters
[1:41:14] yes if you're born again there will come
[1:41:16] humility to your life I believe that
[1:41:19] listen I'm in no way advocating for
[1:41:21] loose living
[1:41:23] I'm in no way advocated that you
[1:41:25] shouldn't do all these things
[1:41:28] but it's got to be more than that it's
[1:41:30] got to be that he is now on the inside
[1:41:33] of me and he is living this out of me he
[1:41:36] is overcoming through me it's his
[1:41:37] righteousness it's his Holiness it's not
[1:41:39] some manufactured Holiness a
[1:41:42] manufactured
[1:41:44] come on now
[1:41:45] put on that you put on yourself
[1:41:48] it's got to be him living in you doing
[1:41:51] the works out of you because if it's
[1:41:53] just you doing the works and there's
[1:41:55] been no experience there's been no New
[1:41:57] Birth you are lost and Bound for hell
[1:42:01] I know it's rough but it's truth anyway
[1:42:08] look I I like I said I don't never want
[1:42:10] to promote loose living I'm thankful for
[1:42:13] correct Doctrine I'm thankful for the
[1:42:15] for for the parameters in the word that
[1:42:17] plainly declare what pleases God and I
[1:42:19] believe as Christians we should try to
[1:42:21] please God
[1:42:23] we should try our best what are you
[1:42:25] saying the same thing I said a couple
[1:42:27] weeks ago that you can't rest in to jump
[1:42:28] in the in the shout you can't rest in
[1:42:30] your works you can't rest and how long
[1:42:33] your skirts are or how long your hair is
[1:42:35] or boys that you don't tell bad jokes
[1:42:37] and that you read your Bible you can't
[1:42:38] rest in those things the only thing you
[1:42:40] can rest in is I've got the token I've
[1:42:43] got the new birth I'm ready to go I'm
[1:42:45] going home I'm part of the Covenant
[1:42:47] that's what you can put your rest in
[1:42:52] let me skip down some of this
[1:42:55] brother Branham says
[1:43:05] you know many times when people are real
[1:43:07] legalistic it causes them to judge other
[1:43:09] people pretty harshly
[1:43:12] well we don't do that so you shouldn't
[1:43:16] how about you worry about you
[1:43:23] quit being so quick to judge everybody
[1:43:25] around you and so quick to question well
[1:43:27] how can they be a Christian and do this
[1:43:29] or do that we would never dream of doing
[1:43:31] such a thing in our home
[1:43:33] it is a trick of the devil to get you
[1:43:35] focused on how others live and to
[1:43:37] compare your righteousness to them
[1:43:40] well I would never how can they
[1:43:44] it's a trick because no matter how clean
[1:43:46] you live and how perfect you're living
[1:43:48] it without the Holy Ghost you will in no
[1:43:50] wise enter in
[1:43:52] think about this for a second
[1:43:54] let this settle home
[1:43:56] their standards and yours may be totally
[1:43:58] different yours may be stricter and
[1:44:01] Holier and they be born again and you
[1:44:03] not
[1:44:12] brother Brown says and the legal it says
[1:44:14] I've got to do this and I must do this
[1:44:15] and I must do that then if you're not
[1:44:18] born again you're still not saved so
[1:44:21] there you are he says
[1:44:23] what you are what Calvinism is what
[1:44:26] Grace is is what God did for you but
[1:44:28] what works is is what you do for God in
[1:44:31] appreciation of what he did for you
[1:44:34] through Grace that's the whole answer
[1:44:36] now listen to this then if I'm saved
[1:44:39] then I will live like I'm saved but I
[1:44:43] could live like I'm saved and not be
[1:44:45] saved
[1:44:48] see so it's the fact then brings it to
[1:44:51] this spot he says we must be born
[1:44:55] again
[1:44:57] we must be born again
[1:45:00] Paul speaking in Philippians 3 tells us
[1:45:03] for we are the circumcision which
[1:45:05] worship God in the spirit and rejoice in
[1:45:07] Christ Jesus and have no confidence in
[1:45:09] the flesh though I might also have
[1:45:11] confidence in the flesh if any other man
[1:45:13] thinketh that he hath whereof he might
[1:45:16] Trust In the Flesh
[1:45:19] he says I got more to boast about than
[1:45:21] any of y'all
[1:45:22] there's nobody can lay a finger on me I
[1:45:24] was circumcised on the Eighth Day Hebrew
[1:45:26] of Hebrews Israelite on both sides I
[1:45:29] mean his father and his mother were
[1:45:30] Pharisees from one generation to another
[1:45:32] excuse me Israelites
[1:45:34] acts 23 he says I am a Pharisee and the
[1:45:37] son of a Pharisee taught according to
[1:45:40] the perfect manner of the law Paul was
[1:45:43] blameless
[1:45:45] you couldn't accuse him of one
[1:45:47] shortcoming
[1:45:48] by anyone according to the word and yet
[1:45:50] Paul said I count all that is done
[1:45:54] that I might win Christ
[1:45:57] three and nine says and be found in him
[1:45:59] not having my own righteousness which is
[1:46:02] of the law but that which is through the
[1:46:04] Faith of Christ the righteousness which
[1:46:06] is of god by faith that I might know him
[1:46:09] and the power of his resurrection
[1:46:14] that's my expectation that's what I want
[1:46:17] do I want a holy life yes do I want an
[1:46:20] overcoming life yes but how am I going
[1:46:22] to get it I want to know him in the
[1:46:24] power of his resurrection I want to know
[1:46:26] him the way they knew him on the day of
[1:46:28] Pentecost I don't want our expectations
[1:46:30] to fall but we need the new birth we
[1:46:32] need the Holy Ghost we're looking what
[1:46:34] is my expectation my expectation is a
[1:46:36] Rapture my expectation is Victory my
[1:46:39] expectation is a body change my
[1:46:42] expectation is overcoming lives how how
[1:46:44] brother Aaron how are we going to do it
[1:46:46] he says you're not little bride I am I'm
[1:46:50] gonna come I'm gonna give you the new
[1:46:52] birth I'm gonna fill you with the Holy
[1:46:53] Ghost I'm gonna give you the token I'm
[1:46:56] going to move the way I always did I'm
[1:46:58] going to deliver you that is the
[1:47:00] expectation of the broad that is my
[1:47:04] expectation
[1:47:05] will you stand together with me tonight
[1:47:12] the Pharisees weren't wrong
[1:47:15] until they rejected the word manifested
[1:47:18] they were right they were righteous they
[1:47:20] were holy they were called they were
[1:47:22] Abraham's seed
[1:47:24] and let this sink in
[1:47:26] but the new birth wasn't as important to
[1:47:29] them as being called and chosen
[1:47:33] they didn't feel the need it wasn't as
[1:47:35] important as being a message believer
[1:47:38] they held to the written word
[1:47:40] over the Fulfillment of it
[1:47:43] look I get happier
[1:47:46] when I think about the fact that it's
[1:47:48] not what I can do
[1:47:49] that it's not the life I have to live
[1:47:52] that is not him up there going well he
[1:47:54] did this wrong today and he I'm glad
[1:47:55] it's not my goodness I'm glad it's all
[1:47:58] on him I'll say let it go tonight let go
[1:48:00] of what you think you have to control
[1:48:01] let go of everything you think you have
[1:48:04] to do and just wrap yourself in the
[1:48:05] grace of God wrap yourself in his
[1:48:07] righteousness tonight wrap yourself in
[1:48:10] the New Birth listen this don't make it
[1:48:11] harder this makes it so much easier I
[1:48:13] don't have to do it I don't have to do
[1:48:15] it he said I got this he said I'll take
[1:48:18] care of you listen there isn't one
[1:48:20] building one person in this building
[1:48:21] better than another
[1:48:23] there isn't one life here worthy of
[1:48:25] going to heaven which means every life
[1:48:28] here is worthy of going to hell
[1:48:31] but he said I'll make a covenant
[1:48:33] and he made a covenant there at Calvary
[1:48:35] he was torn apart
[1:48:37] and in the old days what they would do
[1:48:39] is they would stand between the beasts
[1:48:40] that had been torn apart and they would
[1:48:42] take a piece of paper they would write
[1:48:43] the Covenant on and then they would tear
[1:48:45] it and he would get one half and I would
[1:48:46] get one half
[1:48:47] and then to prove that we had the
[1:48:49] Covenant and that we were of the
[1:48:50] Covenant when I came with my peace
[1:48:53] he had to have the other peace and they
[1:48:55] had to dovetail together perfectly
[1:48:58] and on that day he was he was torn apart
[1:49:01] and his body went back into heaven but
[1:49:04] the other piece was sent down to you the
[1:49:05] Holy Ghost
[1:49:06] and on that day when he comes down he
[1:49:08] says it's Rapture Day it's body changed
[1:49:11] day I'm coming for a bride he's going
[1:49:13] I'm looking for the other piece I'm
[1:49:15] looking for the other piece there it is
[1:49:17] he's got the peace he's got the peace
[1:49:19] and he's got the pieces she's got the
[1:49:21] peace they've got the peace they're the
[1:49:23] other part that's the token they are the
[1:49:26] Covenant people oh I'm not calling you
[1:49:29] Pharisees tonight I'm saying don't be
[1:49:31] like them don't rest in that don't lower
[1:49:33] your expectations my expectation is I've
[1:49:36] got the other piece I've got the token
[1:49:39] and if you don't got it tonight get the
[1:49:41] other piece he's coming for somebody
[1:49:43] he's gonna say show me the Covenant show
[1:49:46] me the Covenant show me the token
[1:49:49] there's my life there's the baptism of
[1:49:52] the Holy Ghost come on little bride

[2:22:30] sure good to be here tonight what a
[2:22:32] wonderful time in the Lord that we had
[2:22:35] so thankful for his grace in my life and
[2:22:38] what he's done
[2:22:39] I just want his grace amen nothing that
[2:22:43] I can do but it's what he's done
[2:22:45] it's so appreciate brother Aaron and the
[2:22:47] message
[2:22:48] I wanted to talk to you all about our
[2:22:50] work day that we have coming up Saturday
[2:22:53] uh we're wanting to start early
[2:22:56] the heat is pretty
[2:22:58] rough right now a lot of humidity and a
[2:23:01] lot of heat so we're going to try to
[2:23:02] start around 6 30. Saturday morning I
[2:23:07] have a list put together some of you may
[2:23:09] have seen it but we wanted to put it up
[2:23:10] on the screen if you could put that up
[2:23:13] Sister Joanna
[2:23:14] these are some of the things that we're
[2:23:16] wanting to try to accomplish Saturday
[2:23:19] and we had everybody stay because it's
[2:23:22] not just for the brothers there are some
[2:23:24] things that the sisters can do if some
[2:23:26] of you sisters want to come out and
[2:23:28] we'll get to that but
[2:23:30] a lot of it is uh just stuff that's kind
[2:23:33] of happened with the storm that we had a
[2:23:35] lot of damage so a lot of this stuff is
[2:23:38] driven by that and then there's just
[2:23:40] some other things that have come along
[2:23:42] too so we're wanting to try to get this
[2:23:43] done you can see the first one uh the
[2:23:47] sign out here we had damage from the
[2:23:48] storm we're wanting to get everything
[2:23:50] torn out so that we can start the
[2:23:52] Reconstruction we're going to be
[2:23:55] constructing it just a little
[2:23:56] differently so we want to tear
[2:23:57] everything out and kind of be starting
[2:23:59] from scratch
[2:24:01] so we're going to have a trailer out
[2:24:03] here I believe brother Steven's going to
[2:24:05] have a dump trailer that we can put all
[2:24:07] the stuff that we tear off in to get it
[2:24:09] away and then we also have AC condenser
[2:24:13] unit that was damaged in the storm we're
[2:24:14] wanting to try to get that replaced I
[2:24:16] believe it's on order I don't know if
[2:24:18] it'll be here in time so that'll be
[2:24:20] another thing that we'll just have to
[2:24:22] see if we get the parts in we got
[2:24:24] thermostats that we want to replace
[2:24:27] in some of the areas to try to get those
[2:24:31] working on the network
[2:24:33] we have the fence row
[2:24:35] that is over here on 371 that is grown
[2:24:39] up we've got a lot of stuff in it when
[2:24:41] we get our sign up it's going to be a
[2:24:44] little lower so we're wanting to get
[2:24:45] that cleared out plus it'll just look
[2:24:47] nice so that's going to be a lot of
[2:24:48] manual labor so we're wanting to start
[2:24:50] early on that as well
[2:24:52] um
[2:24:53] we've got some dirt and erosion in the
[2:24:55] driveway entrance that we're wanting to
[2:24:57] fix Brother David Mitchell is going to
[2:24:59] try to be here with a little Trico
[2:25:02] excavator that we make in uh
[2:25:05] move that along a little faster than
[2:25:07] doing it by hand
[2:25:08] we'll be working on that and we have
[2:25:10] lights in the sanctuary that are out
[2:25:12] from
[2:25:13] electrical issue that we had a lightning
[2:25:16] or whatever so we want to try to get
[2:25:18] those replaced some of these we've
[2:25:21] gotten done I believe brother Mike Wares
[2:25:23] already agrees the casters but
[2:25:25] uh we have the sanctuary wall mounters
[2:25:28] we have one out so we're wanting to put
[2:25:30] a projector in so there's going to be a
[2:25:31] lot of work in the attic to get the
[2:25:34] infrastructure up there so that those
[2:25:36] can be hung so we're wanting to try to
[2:25:38] accomplish that we have a damaged fence
[2:25:40] around the septic system that we
[2:25:43] recently put in and the storm blew a lot
[2:25:46] of that away there's I believe two
[2:25:48] sections missing the rest of them are
[2:25:50] there but it'll have to be put back up
[2:25:52] is that something that you'll be able to
[2:25:54] kind of head up or will you be available
[2:25:57] okay all right so we'll get somebody on
[2:26:00] that what we're going to try to do is
[2:26:02] take a few people maybe and run point on
[2:26:05] these projects and get Brothers to kind
[2:26:07] of help gather and get groups together
[2:26:10] and work on each project so we can do
[2:26:11] them simultaneous
[2:26:14] there's some ceiling tile missing in
[2:26:17] here in the platform entrance and a
[2:26:18] couple others have water damage that we
[2:26:20] want to replace four by fours around the
[2:26:23] swing area we've got the nice swings and
[2:26:25] all set up the brothers worked on we're
[2:26:28] wanting to put four by fours around it
[2:26:29] and we have the sb2 out here that we'll
[2:26:32] have a tractor and we'll put that in
[2:26:33] place
[2:26:35] um we have a hole that we want to dig
[2:26:37] for a concrete acre for our cargo
[2:26:39] trailer we got a new one because others
[2:26:42] were damaged in the storm we're wanting
[2:26:43] to have a way to maybe secure it down so
[2:26:46] if we have another strong wind it won't
[2:26:48] blow this one away
[2:26:50] and damage it and then the sisters we
[2:26:53] have
[2:26:54] in the fellowship hall and the kitchen
[2:26:56] is really where we want to concentrate
[2:26:58] there's a lot of cleaning can be done
[2:27:01] that area we have sister Lydia that
[2:27:04] takes care of the church area in here in
[2:27:07] the sanctuary in different places but
[2:27:09] that doesn't include our fellowship hall
[2:27:11] in the kitchen so it's kind of a effort
[2:27:14] from everybody to take care of those so
[2:27:16] we're wanting to get sisters to come in
[2:27:18] and maybe help clean that area up mop
[2:27:21] the fellowship hall maybe organizing the
[2:27:24] kitchen where things have gotten in
[2:27:25] disarray so those are some of the things
[2:27:28] that we're looking at doing if there's
[2:27:30] more time or more available there's a
[2:27:32] lot of cleaning in the gym same thing
[2:27:34] with that it's not really an area that's
[2:27:36] regularly maintained but we want to work
[2:27:39] on that as well so we have the pit ball
[2:27:43] area I skipped that
[2:27:45] um brother Jimbo you had you had kind of
[2:27:48] run point on that and built it but we
[2:27:50] need a few extra boards on that are you
[2:27:52] able to be here Saturday okay we'll see
[2:27:56] if you'll let me know what we need maybe
[2:27:58] we can get stuff picked up and any
[2:28:00] supplies that any of you need for any of
[2:28:03] the projects let me know we'll make sure
[2:28:06] that we have some of that available if
[2:28:08] you're not picking it up yourself
[2:28:10] so can I just see maybe a show of hands
[2:28:13] who would be able to come out Saturday
[2:28:16] so we kind of have an idea what to
[2:28:18] expect as far as help
[2:28:20] so we've got
[2:28:27] probably about 15 16. okay
[2:28:31] all right well that is all I have I sure
[2:28:34] appreciate everybody and everybody
[2:28:36] coming out don't know how long it'll
[2:28:38] take we'll just be here until but we do
[2:28:40] want to start at 6 30 try to get ahead
[2:28:42] of the heat on some of these projects
[2:28:44] especially the attic projects and the
[2:28:46] outside projects so God bless you and
[2:28:50] we'll see y'all Saturday morning
