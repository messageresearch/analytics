[50:35] fine and so I'll just catch the key of
[50:38] it here in a
[50:41] moment you know life comes along with
[50:44] changes that happens to us all and I
[50:48] reflected over again um this year and in
[50:53] even in the last few
[50:55] days
[50:57] um 56 years ago I uh moved from Boer
[51:03] City Louisiana that's just across the
[51:05] river from streetport I was born in
[51:08] streetport and uh they didn't have a
[51:12] hospital at that time in Boer so I was
[51:15] born in Freeport my parents lived
[51:18] there and um they moved to a farm of 120
[51:21] Acres over in clayber
[51:24] Parish and it was
[51:27] in March of 1968 when that farm was
[51:30] purchased I was 13 I would turn 14 the
[51:34] following
[51:36] September and those of you that know me
[51:39] know that I've lived on that farm there
[51:42] for all of these years built a couple of
[51:45] homes there on that land and um some of
[51:49] you helped me actually with both of
[51:51] those homes to to uh make it where we
[51:55] could keep a ministers and different
[51:58] ones um we hosted you know great um my
[52:04] wife put on bridal showers and great um
[52:09] baby showers and uh birthdays and all
[52:12] kinds of things that uh we did
[52:16] there 1972 as a church we moved from my
[52:19] dad's home um and started meeting in an
[52:23] old abandoned church building I hadn't
[52:26] had service in it for 13 years it was u
[52:31] a big old white frame building had no
[52:33] heat had no air conditioner I had six
[52:35] light bulbs and one receptacle to plug
[52:37] something
[52:39] in and um we worked on that every way we
[52:43] could and and uh finally got facilities
[52:48] in there running water and natural gas
[52:51] and uh you know through the years we
[52:54] outgrew that and we built a new on the
[52:56] property there and dedicated it in
[52:59] [Music]
[53:02] 1996 in the year of
[53:04] 2013 realizing we was landlocked and we
[53:08] had to do something and I received a
[53:11] Divine mandate from
[53:14] God and you know it had to do with the
[53:16] healing of Brother Gary stanan where
[53:19] that I was in the hospital there with
[53:22] him a man who was dying the doctor said
[53:25] he was dying and
[53:27] God raised him up and in that moment
[53:29] there I received a mandate to to do
[53:34] something different to build another
[53:37] building and um to uh to start something
[53:41] there and so we we bought this land in
[53:46] 2013 40 acres we can't be landlocked
[53:49] here I hope and we um started building
[53:53] and then dedicated this in 200 17 it's a
[53:58] miracle we uh we were so blessed because
[54:03] we paid for every every bit of it with
[54:05] cash God provided for it he not only
[54:10] showed himself as Jehovah Gyra the
[54:12] provider but he did even more than that
[54:15] he he blessed us with a wonderful youth
[54:18] facility and you know also then the The
[54:21] Pavilion and the mes Park and all of
[54:25] that
[54:27] well you know um
[54:30] in in the year 1972 is when we moved out
[54:34] of my dad's home into a a church
[54:37] building and and
[54:40] uh and cuz I at 15 that started
[54:43] preaching and there I was 17 at that
[54:46] time and the church has just grown and
[54:50] you know went to where we had to do
[54:51] something
[54:52] different and this
[54:54] year this 15-year-old boy preacher
[54:57] turned
[54:58] 70 so you know I have some changes in my
[55:03] life as you
[55:06] know
[55:09] now next year sister Karen and I would
[55:12] have been married 50
[55:15] years and God rescued
[55:18] her from a brutal s satanic attacks that
[55:23] he used in his attempts to destroy
[55:26] me and uh she's now been gone for 2
[55:29] years and 7
[55:31] months now before the first of the year
[55:34] I was praying earnestly about my life
[55:37] and what I what I'm to do you know I've
[55:40] I've always tended to be more proactive
[55:42] than
[55:43] reactive and so I was praying earnestly
[55:46] and about my future as I look toward
[55:50] older
[55:51] Years brother Josh Bennett came here and
[55:54] preached uh our New Year's meeting on
[55:56] the changing of the seasons and it
[55:58] confirmed what I was praying about and I
[56:00] made the decision to leave the farm and
[56:03] move to
[56:04] Menan and I want to thank my family and
[56:07] my church family and there have been
[56:09] many that have helped me go through 50
[56:12] years of accumulated things to and move
[56:15] to mendum and still have some more
[56:18] things to sort out and whatever but I
[56:21] want to thanks to give thanks to all the
[56:23] help of those involved and there have
[56:25] been a lot of volunteer work on my house
[56:27] the the lay family all of you brother
[56:30] John Brother Joseph brother Tom Herring
[56:33] brother Jim Morgan there so many others
[56:36] I I can't name you all because I'd have
[56:38] to stand here and name the whole church
[56:40] who have have um lifted up and and help
[56:46] me with this and facilitate this move
[56:49] and I want to thank you from the bottom
[56:51] of my heart so I have now moved my
[56:53] residence officially from what we called
[56:57] PR bille on the farm about 20 mi north
[57:01] of Menan here and um I'm living here and
[57:05] uh you know one day I'll make an
[57:08] opportunity to welcome you to my home
[57:10] that that I have here but anyway we're
[57:13] going to another home and we're getting
[57:16] ready to to leave here and so with that
[57:20] this morning we just want to look to the
[57:23] Lord with all our hearts and um
[57:26] and and press on now to whatever the
[57:29] future lays I trust there will not be
[57:32] another Youth Camp I not here I trust
[57:35] the next Youth Camp will be in glory so
[57:39] may the Lord be with us as we progress
[57:43] as we move we're moving toward the
[57:46] Rapture I am I I know that the Lord is
[57:50] coming because we're part of that
[57:53] coming and I know he's preparing a PE
[57:56] people for his name's sake and I know
[57:58] we're a part of that people so with all
[58:01] of our hearts we press on Seasons may
[58:05] change times you know of our future I I
[58:09] I believe our future is clear I believe
[58:11] we have clear streams ahead I'm looking
[58:14] for greater times greater outpouring of
[58:17] the Holy Spirit greater Faith than ever

[1:00:34] Exodus 12 and verse 21 anden I want to
[1:00:39] thank you for accompanying me on that I
[1:00:43] kind of sprung that as a surprise on
[1:00:44] that I'm not a singer but I'm you know
[1:00:47] we continue to take steps like Enoch did
[1:00:50] until we go home amen Exodus 12: 21 then
[1:00:56] Moses called for all the Elders of
[1:00:59] Israel and said unto them draw out and
[1:01:01] take you a lamb according to your
[1:01:03] families and kill the
[1:01:05] Passover and ye shall take a bunch of
[1:01:08] hisab and dip it in the blood that is in
[1:01:11] the Basin and strike the lentil and the
[1:01:14] two- side post with the blood that is in
[1:01:17] the Basin and none of you shall go out
[1:01:21] at the door of his house until the
[1:01:24] morning for the Lord will pass through
[1:01:26] to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth
[1:01:30] the blood upon the lentil and on the two
[1:01:33] side post the Lord will pass over the
[1:01:35] door and will not suffer the Destroyer
[1:01:39] to come into your houses to Smite you
[1:01:42] amen may God bless his word you can be
[1:01:44] seated we're going to speak today on the
[1:01:48] token displays his
[1:01:52] power as we're looking at this this
[1:01:55] morning
[1:01:56] we know it was a very serious hour in
[1:02:01] Egypt when Israel was leaving that place
[1:02:04] and going into their promised land and
[1:02:08] of course they wouldn't get there in one
[1:02:10] day it would be a journey through the
[1:02:13] Wilderness they didn't realize it would
[1:02:15] be 40 Years of
[1:02:17] Journey and of course it didn't have to
[1:02:19] be that because of
[1:02:21] Disobedience it would it would take
[1:02:24] place like that where that there would
[1:02:25] be 40 Years of wandering in the
[1:02:28] wilderness and of course on this night
[1:02:32] the there would be a separation between
[1:02:36] the Egyptians and the Israelites in so
[1:02:39] much that there would be death that
[1:02:42] would come upon the first born of of
[1:02:44] every house in the land and of course in
[1:02:49] the and the children of Israel they were
[1:02:52] given a lamb to die in their place
[1:02:56] so there was blood that would be applied
[1:02:59] that would be showing that the death
[1:03:01] angel had already passed through and he
[1:03:06] had that death had already came to that
[1:03:08] land and the Death Angel then would pass
[1:03:11] over that house because he would see
[1:03:13] death has already been there and and of
[1:03:16] course that goes in the beautiful type
[1:03:19] of Christ where he became our lamb and
[1:03:23] and of course he is the one who protect
[1:03:26] us from the death angel that is coming
[1:03:28] through and we're living in an hour
[1:03:31] where there is death in the land and if
[1:03:34] you would read the book of Revelation
[1:03:36] and you would know where we are in that
[1:03:38] book as it as it spells out the end time
[1:03:41] that you know that the fourth horse
[1:03:43] rider which is death is about to take
[1:03:47] his ride and as it as he morphed from
[1:03:51] the red and or and from the red the
[1:03:53] white the red into the black and then to
[1:03:56] the pale then he he is there poised to
[1:04:00] make his final ride and and and bring
[1:04:03] death to the whole world and we're
[1:04:05] living in a day where where it's very
[1:04:09] real the Bible said that that the Earth
[1:04:12] will burn as an oven and there is of
[1:04:16] course a civilization here who is well
[1:04:20] capable of wiping it out with their
[1:04:23] nuclear weapons and we're closer now to
[1:04:27] that Midnight Hour than we ever have
[1:04:30] been and Israel of course being under
[1:04:32] attack the way it is it shows us the
[1:04:36] signs of the time and we were told to
[1:04:38] watch Israel and you look and see what
[1:04:40] is happening there and you also know
[1:04:43] that things are similar happening here
[1:04:45] and Satan is doing everything with a
[1:04:48] spiritual Slaughter just as he did with
[1:04:51] the with Israel over there to slaughter
[1:04:54] to kill to maim to to to plunder uh
[1:04:59] every child of God and this is why that
[1:05:03] it is so important that we be under the
[1:05:05] token of the blood of Jesus Christ for
[1:05:08] he said when I see the blood I will pass
[1:05:11] over you now we have spoke about how in
[1:05:16] um the in other services about this and
[1:05:20] the last one that I spoke was on a lamb
[1:05:22] for a household and and I I just talked
[1:05:26] about the the
[1:05:28] preparations that we must be making for
[1:05:30] the Rapture and then the practical
[1:05:33] application that is more than just
[1:05:35] saying oh I'm under the token it's more
[1:05:38] than just a cliche of of words it's more
[1:05:42] than just um even saying well I've
[1:05:44] kicked out the trash you know the uh we
[1:05:46] got out the bad newspapers and the the
[1:05:48] television and the all the evil things
[1:05:51] like that and so we're now under the
[1:05:53] token but then we found that it must be
[1:05:55] applied to our
[1:05:57] lives you know to to our body our soul
[1:06:01] our spirit you know to every part of us
[1:06:03] as as the the blood would be put in
[1:06:06] three places on on each side of the door
[1:06:09] and then over that every house must come
[1:06:11] under the blood but now I want to bring
[1:06:14] it down to another step because I want
[1:06:18] you to understand that not only your
[1:06:21] house your body must be brought under
[1:06:24] the blood not only your home your
[1:06:27] household must be brought under the
[1:06:29] blood but also the blood must be applied
[1:06:33] to the
[1:06:34] church so this is very very important
[1:06:37] because we are also a house so the Bible
[1:06:40] said to every
[1:06:42] house so the church itself must have the
[1:06:45] blood
[1:06:46] applied and and brother Brandon would
[1:06:49] tell us in the message of toen and today
[1:06:51] every church every individual that isn't
[1:06:55] and cannnot display that token of the
[1:06:59] Holy Ghost is spiritually dying and will
[1:07:02] die so not only are we seeing death uh
[1:07:06] in individuals as as um as manhood is
[1:07:10] dying and Womanhood is dying and and
[1:07:13] motherhood is dying you know um the
[1:07:16] whole family structure is breaking down
[1:07:18] and and that then then we we see it
[1:07:21] there in the home where where again
[1:07:24] families are are being wrecked and
[1:07:26] ruined and marriage and given and
[1:07:28] marriage and the evil day as it was in
[1:07:31] the days of Noah but then we see that
[1:07:34] also churches are
[1:07:36] dying they are losing the very Life of
[1:07:39] Christ that the Holy Ghost isn't there
[1:07:43] and and many places that kabad is over
[1:07:46] the door the glory of the Lord has
[1:07:50] departed so it's a it's a day where
[1:07:53] there's death and dying but there also
[1:07:56] uh it's a day of also life where we
[1:07:59] receive the death of the lamb and his
[1:08:01] blood has been applied and we have
[1:08:04] received of his spirit and so the token
[1:08:06] must be also upon the
[1:08:10] church and the token is the Holy Ghost
[1:08:13] now in the Bible there he said the blood
[1:08:15] shall be a token to you but today the
[1:08:17] life of the blood which is the blood of
[1:08:19] Jesus Christ his life the holy spirit is
[1:08:22] our token it's the sign when we receive
[1:08:25] it
[1:08:26] that we have passed from death into life
[1:08:28] and that the death angel can pass again
[1:08:31] he said today the Holy Ghost is God's
[1:08:34] covenant with God's covenant people the
[1:08:37] Holy Ghost the life of the resurrected
[1:08:40] Christ has got to be displayed in the
[1:08:44] church notice now we again emphasizing
[1:08:49] the church uh uh amongst the people
[1:08:52] making him the same yesterday today and
[1:08:56] forever so you see it's got to be
[1:08:59] displayed in the church in a way that it
[1:09:03] makes him the same yesterday today and
[1:09:07] forever now that is the message amen the
[1:09:12] true message of God the true teaching of
[1:09:15] the church brother Randon would go
[1:09:17] through this and the five
[1:09:18] identifications of the Church of the
[1:09:20] Living God and he tells us John 14 which
[1:09:23] you know what that is John 14:12 which
[1:09:26] says verily verily I say unto you he
[1:09:28] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:09:31] shall he do also and greater than these
[1:09:34] shall you do because I go to my father
[1:09:38] so he gives this teaching this was the
[1:09:41] teaching of Jesus of what the church
[1:09:45] should do amen now we you know there
[1:09:48] have been Ministries there have been
[1:09:51] Apostles there have been prophets and we
[1:09:54] have had a prophet Ministry in this age
[1:09:57] but let me tell you it's more than just
[1:09:59] them doing the works The Church Must do
[1:10:03] the works of Jesus Christ so he gives a
[1:10:07] teaching of what the church must do that
[1:10:10] is the message of the church Jesus
[1:10:14] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:10:16] forever living in the church King of the
[1:10:19] church raised from the dead same
[1:10:21] yesterday today and forever performing
[1:10:24] the same Works doing the same things
[1:10:26] that Jesus did that's the message of the
[1:10:29] church so our real message is we must do
[1:10:34] what Jesus did if Jesus healed the sick
[1:10:39] we must not let the sick lay if Jesus
[1:10:42] reached out to the lost and the sinner
[1:10:44] then we must provide a place and an
[1:10:48] atmosphere where the Holy Spirit can
[1:10:50] move whatever did Jesus did we must do
[1:10:54] what he taught we T must teach his works
[1:10:57] that he did we must do you see that's
[1:11:02] the message of the church now listen and
[1:11:04] brother Brandon would say if the church
[1:11:06] isn't teaching that it's teaching some
[1:11:09] false Theology and that's what Jesus
[1:11:13] commanded them to preach that's right so
[1:11:16] this must be preached put that scripture
[1:11:17] back up Katie you know John 14:12 this
[1:11:21] must be preached this must be our messag
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:25] so I'm in the message well this must be
[1:11:28] the message that we are represented of
[1:11:31] Christ as his bride that the works that
[1:11:35] he did we do also and not just his works
[1:11:39] but greater than
[1:11:43] these so therefore we we have been
[1:11:46] challenged by almighty God to step up a
[1:11:50] higher
[1:11:51] level this age causes if we're going to
[1:11:54] preach the true message we must not only
[1:11:57] bear his name in baptism like our
[1:12:00] brother David Peak will do in a moment
[1:12:03] but but we must we must also be
[1:12:06] identified as a church true church by
[1:12:09] doing his
[1:12:12] works now
[1:12:14] originally you know first the the early
[1:12:17] church
[1:12:19] were were known as Christians they were
[1:12:23] at first called Christians at Antioch
[1:12:26] and what they believed was called the
[1:12:29] way many of you don't realize it but
[1:12:32] they would they would say instead of
[1:12:34] saying I'm in the message they would say
[1:12:35] I'm in the
[1:12:36] way we believe in the
[1:12:39] way this was their identification and
[1:12:43] their their identity was with Christ
[1:12:48] Christian and so they this this perhaps
[1:12:52] came from Isaiah 40 and3 prepare the way
[1:12:54] of the Lord but also no doubt when Jesus
[1:12:57] said I am the way the truth and the life
[1:13:01] so the original Church would say we are
[1:13:04] in the way we are walking in the way we
[1:13:07] are teaching the way of the lord we are
[1:13:10] preparing the way of the Lord they were
[1:13:12] looking for the Rapture in their age
[1:13:15] they didn't know they would go to sleep
[1:13:17] they didn't know there would be seven
[1:13:18] Church ages they didn't know that we
[1:13:21] were coming that's right but God had
[1:13:23] more in the book that's right amen he
[1:13:26] had more names in the book than them and
[1:13:29] and so time would go on in order to
[1:13:32] manifest every name on the book but
[1:13:34] we're coming down to the end of the
[1:13:38] book and we must be in the
[1:13:41] way and we best be
[1:13:46] Christians now a little later there were
[1:13:50] men came up with doctrinal
[1:13:53] differences they began to differ from
[1:13:55] the from the original church at
[1:14:00] Pentecost they began to change the
[1:14:03] formula of water baptism where there was
[1:14:06] nowhere anywhere in the Bible that
[1:14:09] anybody was ever baptized than in the
[1:14:12] name of Jesus
[1:14:14] Christ and they would when you know when
[1:14:17] when when they they would change it over
[1:14:20] into titles which are not names but the
[1:14:23] father Son and Holy Ghost to represent a
[1:14:26] Triune God when God is one God here o
[1:14:30] Israel the Lord thy God is one
[1:14:32] Lord this is this is a one God Bible
[1:14:37] it's not a three good Bible there's no
[1:14:39] such things as three three Gods neither
[1:14:42] are there three persons in the Trinity
[1:14:44] there is one God one person of God and
[1:14:47] he was manifested in Jesus Christ and
[1:14:51] Jesus is the very God that weigh the
[1:14:54] truth and the life and there is no
[1:14:57] salvation in any other name but his
[1:15:02] name so you see a group rose up and The
[1:15:06] Trinity was formulated not in Bible
[1:15:09] Doctrine but 325 Years Later by Turan
[1:15:14] who come up with the Trinity Doctrine a
[1:15:16] word that's not even in the
[1:15:18] Bible and you
[1:15:20] see they were
[1:15:23] pagans and they had a pagan
[1:15:26] mindset of multiple
[1:15:29] deities and so they embraced paganism so
[1:15:34] therefore they called their name
[1:15:36] Universal
[1:15:37] Christians which means
[1:15:41] Catholic so you see anybody that's
[1:15:44] baptized in the titles of Father Son and
[1:15:46] Holy Ghost are baptized into the
[1:15:47] Catholic
[1:15:49] Church they're not baptized into Christ
[1:15:53] there's one way amen there's one way one
[1:15:56] Lord One Faith one
[1:15:58] baptism are you with me one God father
[1:16:01] of us all this is Bible Doctrine has
[1:16:04] been there all the way through it's what
[1:16:07] it's what they believed in the Old
[1:16:08] Testament it's what they believed in the
[1:16:09] New
[1:16:10] Testaments in the New Testament the
[1:16:13] apostles didn't come up with another
[1:16:14] deity and say oh we forgot one the Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost so we got three of
[1:16:21] them but the pagans did the UN Universal
[1:16:25] Church the universal that would be
[1:16:29] inclusive that would change the their
[1:16:32] their statutes of you know to the pagan
[1:16:36] gods and and so on that they worship the
[1:16:39] idols that they worship and would
[1:16:40] renamed them to Peter and James and John
[1:16:44] saint this and saint that and Saint
[1:16:45] somebody else and on and on and on and
[1:16:48] there was um one of one of the early
[1:16:51] leaders his name was ignatus he was the
[1:16:54] first to use the word Catholic and he
[1:16:57] was among those who brought the idea
[1:17:00] that a bishop was one of preeminence or
[1:17:04] authority over the other Ministries and
[1:17:07] this helped set a platform for the pope
[1:17:11] who would rule over all so you know they
[1:17:14] started out as all
[1:17:16] Brothers amen just one Ling
[1:17:19] family but the next thing you know we
[1:17:22] have a hierarchy of ministry and then
[1:17:25] that Ministry would Overlord over other
[1:17:28] ministers and then that Minister would
[1:17:31] then had one over over him so you had
[1:17:34] you had a pope and then you had a
[1:17:36] cardinal and then you had Bishops and
[1:17:38] then you had a priest and then you come
[1:17:40] down to the nuns and the Layman and so
[1:17:42] on like that and it's called nickan
[1:17:47] ISM because they set men over men to
[1:17:50] rule the church and the church became
[1:17:53] ruled by men instead of of the spirit of
[1:17:55] God and they took on a name that was
[1:17:59] different from Christian now they're
[1:18:01] Catholic
[1:18:03] Universal I'm going somewhere with this
[1:18:08] now due to the nickan doctrine and the
[1:18:12] the the heavy
[1:18:13] thumb of the
[1:18:15] Pope the reformers struggled against
[1:18:17] Rome and Luther was one of
[1:18:20] those and he was one of the first that
[1:18:24] broke away from the Catholic church and
[1:18:28] his movement was called by his own name
[1:18:32] now Luther actually objected to
[1:18:35] this he he did not want his movement as
[1:18:39] he would call it he want he he did not
[1:18:41] as it would be called identified with
[1:18:44] him he wanted it he wanted them to be
[1:18:48] Christians and I I want you to be
[1:18:50] realized you know sectarianism wants to
[1:18:53] force its way and make us make us call
[1:18:57] this or that or something besides
[1:18:59] Christians above Christ and take on
[1:19:02] another name so Luther said in the first
[1:19:06] place I ask that men make no reference
[1:19:09] to my name let them call themselves
[1:19:12] Christians not Lutheran what is Lutheran
[1:19:16] after all or what is Luther after all
[1:19:19] the teaching is not mine neither was I
[1:19:21] crucified for anyone St Paul PA in 1
[1:19:25] Corinthians 3 would not allow the
[1:19:26] Christians to call themselves Pauline or
[1:19:29] petrin but Christian so how then should
[1:19:33] I a poor stinking maggot fod that I am
[1:19:38] come to have men call the children of
[1:19:41] Christ by my wretched
[1:19:44] name not so my dear friends let us
[1:19:46] abolish all party names and call
[1:19:49] ourselves Christians after him whose
[1:19:52] teaching we hold the pap
[1:19:55] deservedly have a party name because
[1:19:57] they are not content with the teaching
[1:19:59] and the name of Christ but want to be
[1:20:02] papist as well let them be papis then
[1:20:05] since the pope is their master I am
[1:20:08] neither I neither am nor want to be
[1:20:10] anyone's master I hold together with The
[1:20:13] Universal Church the one universal
[1:20:15] teaching of Christ who is our only
[1:20:17] master I dislike very much that Doctrine
[1:20:22] and I and people have to suffer to be
[1:20:24] called Lutheran and thus see God's word
[1:20:28] profaned by my
[1:20:30] name so you know it actually though
[1:20:33] would start as a label of
[1:20:36] division you are
[1:20:39] Lutheran now we're Christians well you
[1:20:42] you're following Luther no we're
[1:20:44] followers of
[1:20:47] Christ and and then it became an
[1:20:51] identification that we're
[1:20:53] Lutheran we follow Luther's
[1:20:58] message I me all you have to do is put
[1:21:01] brandom in
[1:21:03] there you see exactly what what the
[1:21:05] spirit is going on in this day you see
[1:21:08] it became as a title of derision and
[1:21:11] Scorn and that's how it began and it
[1:21:14] became a labeling of
[1:21:16] Pride and people willingly took on the
[1:21:19] name
[1:21:20] Lutheran and starting back in the sardan
[1:21:23] age from the birth out of Rome there
[1:21:26] came others you know the Bible talks
[1:21:28] about it talks very plain language it
[1:21:31] talks about a great and it talks
[1:21:33] about her
[1:21:35] daughters so the great we we know
[1:21:38] that started out and and from her would
[1:21:40] birth all the other denominations would
[1:21:43] be the Catholic church and then there
[1:21:45] would be others and they would take on
[1:21:47] the name of a certain Doctrine the
[1:21:49] Baptist became known as Baptist because
[1:21:51] they baptized by immersion and didn't
[1:21:54] believe in infant baptism good things
[1:21:57] good truths lutherans would become
[1:22:00] Lutheran because they identified that
[1:22:02] with with Luther's protest against the
[1:22:05] heavy hand of Rome where that he nailed
[1:22:08] his 90 0th what
[1:22:12] third 95th thesis to to the door and and
[1:22:17] and there he would he would declare you
[1:22:20] know the and the start of the
[1:22:22] reformation and so you see it would
[1:22:25] start though with that a tremendous
[1:22:29] growth to denominational
[1:22:32] spirit and and I'm quoting this from the
[1:22:34] church A's book that if the Corinthian
[1:22:37] attitude of I'm of Paul and I'm of cus
[1:22:41] was ever exhibited it was now there were
[1:22:45] Lutheran and hussites and Z English
[1:22:47] party and and such fragmentation of the
[1:22:50] body was deplorable they were living a
[1:22:53] name but were
[1:22:55] dead certainly they were dead they died
[1:22:57] the minute they organized the great
[1:23:00] groups organized and tied themselves to
[1:23:02] the matrimony in matrimony to the state
[1:23:05] so in other words they would get their
[1:23:07] power from political power they would
[1:23:10] get Kings and rulers and local rulers
[1:23:13] and their armies to stand behind them
[1:23:16] and be persuaded by their Doctrine and
[1:23:18] support them so it didn't become just a
[1:23:20] religious move it would be also a
[1:23:22] political move
[1:23:26] and so and so they were they tied
[1:23:30] themselves to in matrimony to the state
[1:23:32] they did it they were and they were
[1:23:34] finished here were those lutherans who
[1:23:37] criticized the Roman Church they knew
[1:23:40] the unrighteousness of political and
[1:23:43] spiritual unions yet Luther as when
[1:23:46] Peter was overbalanced by the judaizer
[1:23:48] went right ahead and made the state
[1:23:51] instead of God the defender of the faith
[1:23:53] so you know Luther would actually
[1:23:55] welcome that support and this was the
[1:23:59] first denomination of repute that came
[1:24:01] out of the Harlot but when Luther died
[1:24:04] it was not long until the it had a
[1:24:06] hierarchy like the one it had fought
[1:24:09] this move of God by the time of the
[1:24:11] second generation came along was right
[1:24:15] back under the wing of her mother she
[1:24:18] had gone back and didn't even know it
[1:24:20] they had taken on their own name above
[1:24:23] his name name they were living their own
[1:24:27] name to and all the denominations are
[1:24:30] doing the very thing today they are
[1:24:32] living their own name and not the name
[1:24:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ that is easily
[1:24:38] seen for every church is known by the
[1:24:41] way it worships but none are known by
[1:24:45] the power of
[1:24:46] God now here I want you to get the
[1:24:49] picture they're known by the way they
[1:24:52] worship and they're known by their
[1:24:55] Theology and their doctrinal stats but
[1:24:58] they're not known by the power of
[1:25:01] God they they gave up the power of God
[1:25:04] for the power of the state they clung to
[1:25:06] their own name and made their names
[1:25:08] their own names great it was that old
[1:25:11] Spirit of getting everybody into his
[1:25:13] fold today the Baptists want the
[1:25:15] Methodist to come over to the Baptist
[1:25:17] the methodists are out to proelite the
[1:25:19] Presbyterians the Pentecostals want them
[1:25:22] all each claims to offer the most and
[1:25:24] hold out the greatest hope a sort of
[1:25:26] door of Heaven uh or at least a way to a
[1:25:29] more abundant entrance how tragic it all
[1:25:33] is but again the scripture says that God
[1:25:36] anointed Jesus at nazarus with the Holy
[1:25:39] Ghost and power and he went about doing
[1:25:41] good and healing all that was oppressed
[1:25:44] as Jesus went away he told his disciples
[1:25:47] to T into Pentecost unto at which time
[1:25:51] the very same spirit that was upon him
[1:25:54] would come back and fall upon them and
[1:25:57] fill them notice it is is not even the
[1:26:01] doctrine it is the spirit of Jesus that
[1:26:05] is to give us our
[1:26:07] identity the identity again for the for
[1:26:11] the Israelites was the life of the Lamb
[1:26:14] to be on the door our identity again it
[1:26:18] should not be just word only but it must
[1:26:22] be the life of the spirit of God Amen so
[1:26:27] again again he said that they were told
[1:26:30] to to tear the Pentecost until the same
[1:26:33] spirit that was on him came back upon
[1:26:37] them and they would fall on them and
[1:26:39] fill them and then that called out body
[1:26:42] the church would be in his dead upon the
[1:26:45] Earth taking his place I want you to get
[1:26:49] the picture we are to be in his T we are
[1:26:52] to be taken his place
[1:26:54] we must come in his name doing his works
[1:26:59] and because the same spirit that was in
[1:27:01] him was in them then they would do the
[1:27:05] very same works and any people that is
[1:27:08] truly the body of Jesus Christ the true
[1:27:11] church WIll manifest the same works as
[1:27:15] Jesus and the Pentecostal church because
[1:27:17] the same spirit will be in them at any
[1:27:21] other church that does not have the
[1:27:23] spirit and manifestations is going to
[1:27:26] have to account to
[1:27:31] God can you imagine standing there on
[1:27:33] that day by a different name or
[1:27:41] identity I want to say today the power
[1:27:46] and the works of Christ must be our
[1:27:52] identification so is either when you Tak
[1:27:55] what some organization said some
[1:27:59] man-made Theory you know that preach the
[1:28:02] doctrine of that theory then that's
[1:28:04] their
[1:28:05] credentials this is their acceptance you
[1:28:08] know to the Deacon board or whatever it
[1:28:10] is to be in good fellowship with that
[1:28:13] organization but and and as brother
[1:28:16] brand was I don't have anything against
[1:28:18] that but what I'm
[1:28:19] defending is Jesus said these signs
[1:28:22] shall follow them that believe
[1:28:25] here is what we are defending and it
[1:28:27] says in John 14:12 verely verely I say
[1:28:30] un you absolutely absolutely I say to
[1:28:33] you he that believeth on me the works
[1:28:36] that I do shall he do also and how can a
[1:28:39] man believe he is sent from God and then
[1:28:42] turn around and deny the very commission
[1:28:46] that God said would that would be the
[1:28:49] identification of every person that he
[1:28:51] sent out I want you to get not one man
[1:28:54] not one person well not one great man
[1:28:57] among us but every person have that
[1:29:01] identification The Works that I do these
[1:29:04] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:29:06] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:29:09] and forever the same in every detail
[1:29:12] except his Corporal body amen but yet
[1:29:15] here he is in a body on the earth a
[1:29:18] bride body a people a church called by
[1:29:21] his name identified with him by his
[1:29:24] works by his
[1:29:26] power
[1:29:28] amen so how you know men are so willing
[1:29:32] to take on another name I'm Lutheran I'm
[1:29:36] Methodist I'm two Soul I'm seventh
[1:29:39] Thunder I'm this I'm that you know some
[1:29:41] I'm perusia we're this all party
[1:29:44] Spirits all organizational Spirits all
[1:29:47] Daughters of the
[1:29:50] amen everyone I'm Daughters of the
[1:29:54] same horish system with a hierarchy of
[1:29:56] man some great one leading us on let me
[1:29:59] tell you we have a great
[1:30:02] one and it's Jesus Christ amen he's the
[1:30:06] great one it's his name that had must be
[1:30:09] ENT we're identified with his name must
[1:30:12] be the exalted name Among
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:18] Us so men will willingly take on other
[1:30:23] identific
[1:30:24] ations but the
[1:30:26] identification that he sent out would be
[1:30:30] these
[1:30:31] signs the works that I do this is going
[1:30:36] to identify my
[1:30:39] disciples amen so how can a man say
[1:30:42] there's no such thing as the baptism of
[1:30:44] the Holy Ghost how can a man say there's
[1:30:47] no such thing as healing of the sick how
[1:30:50] can a man say there's no such a thing as
[1:30:52] speaking in tongues and cting out Devils
[1:30:55] when that was the very credentials that
[1:30:58] Jesus pinned onto every believer that
[1:31:02] that he sent out that's the authority
[1:31:04] listen this shows you have been sent of
[1:31:07] God you said well many many will come to
[1:31:09] me and that day and say Lord Lord but
[1:31:11] let me tell you that may be them with a
[1:31:15] lying sign and a lying Wonder but the
[1:31:18] church's identification is he is the
[1:31:21] same yesterday today every ever that the
[1:31:24] works that I do shall he do also amen
[1:31:28] that these sign shall follow them that
[1:31:30] believe in my name in my stad this will
[1:31:35] identify here you will know these are
[1:31:37] mine they will lay hands on the sick and
[1:31:40] they shall recover they will cast out
[1:31:43] Devils they will speak with new
[1:31:48] tongues that is our
[1:31:52] credentials
[1:31:54] Lord
[1:31:56] yes you might go to school and get a PhD
[1:32:00] and lld or whatever where you want
[1:32:03] that's all right that's your
[1:32:04] identification to your
[1:32:09] organization and them's all right said I
[1:32:12] have nothing against them wish I had
[1:32:13] them but the
[1:32:15] identification that Jesus when he sends
[1:32:18] a man
[1:32:20] is these signs shall follow them that
[1:32:23] believe
[1:32:24] see that's the
[1:32:26] identifications that he sent by
[1:32:30] God so to know that a man would be sent
[1:32:33] of God he'd have the same life of God
[1:32:36] therefore the same power of God
[1:32:39] therefore the same works of God you see
[1:32:42] how important it is that our message
[1:32:46] must
[1:32:48] be John
[1:32:50] 14:12 amen The Works that I do shall he
[1:32:53] do also and greater than these shall you
[1:32:57] do that must be our
[1:33:01] identification amen we must be known as
[1:33:04] a people who believe Mark
[1:33:07] 16 amen we must be known as a people
[1:33:11] that when people come in here and the
[1:33:13] sick are coming with heavy laden with
[1:33:15] sickness or heavy laden with sin that
[1:33:18] they can find a place of Refuge that
[1:33:20] must be our
[1:33:22] identification amen I ask you
[1:33:27] today would Jesus call you a
[1:33:32] Believer the spoken words Original Seed
[1:33:35] brother brandham poses this question he
[1:33:38] said the works that Jesus did if a man
[1:33:41] has the seed of God in him with the
[1:33:43] spirit of God watering that seed the
[1:33:46] same works that was manifested in Jesus
[1:33:49] him being the Original Seed of God his
[1:33:52] death brings you back to the original
[1:33:53] origal seed of God and if the same
[1:33:57] spirit that was within him is in you the
[1:34:01] same Works will be manifested you don't
[1:34:03] believe that we'll turn over to John
[1:34:05] 14:12 you say I'm a Believer brother
[1:34:07] Brandon I sure am a believer all right
[1:34:10] I'm going to see if Jesus would call you
[1:34:14] one see if the word of God called you
[1:34:17] one very very absolutely absolutely I
[1:34:21] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:34:24] works that I do shall he do also and
[1:34:27] Greater Works than these shall you do
[1:34:29] because I go to the father what is it
[1:34:32] same
[1:34:33] seed thus works the same manifest in his
[1:34:37] church that was manifested in Christ he
[1:34:40] said so John 14:12 heavens and earth
[1:34:42] will pass away but my word Shall
[1:34:46] Not So no matter how much word we have
[1:34:51] you say well we're a word church and I
[1:34:54] believe in the word yes sir amen but I I
[1:34:57] want to say again letter
[1:35:00] kth and without the spirit is just dead
[1:35:04] that's right amen even even the word
[1:35:08] preached must be mixed with faith that's
[1:35:12] right so well we're pure word if you
[1:35:13] don't have faith mixed with
[1:35:15] it it ain't of no account that's right
[1:35:19] amen so you see if he ever was God he
[1:35:23] still
[1:35:24] God Amen so he said it's a lack of faith
[1:35:28] that has been preached into the people
[1:35:30] that makes them let that six sense which
[1:35:32] is Faith laid
[1:35:34] dormant so it's so important Faith be
[1:35:38] preached Faith with the word faith with
[1:35:41] the word come on Amen signs fallowing
[1:35:44] them that believe actions of the Holy
[1:35:47] Ghost not just word not just doctor not
[1:35:50] just known by doctor but known by the
[1:35:53] works
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:56] Jesus even said if you don't believe me
[1:35:59] then look at my
[1:36:03] Works brother Bram would go on and on
[1:36:05] and on I'm going to do I'm going to do a
[1:36:07] sermon on it one of these days brother
[1:36:08] Bram would go over and over he said the
[1:36:10] bride must stand at that same
[1:36:15] spot who can convince me of sin who can
[1:36:19] say I'm an
[1:36:20] unbeliever The Works that my father does
[1:36:23] I
[1:36:27] do now the token or the Holy Ghost is
[1:36:32] the power that keeps the death angel
[1:36:35] from our
[1:36:36] church without
[1:36:38] it we're just a meaningless group of
[1:36:44] people we're just a corpse without a
[1:36:48] life kiss all you want to on the corpse
[1:36:50] it's
[1:36:52] dead make love to it all you want to
[1:36:55] call it all all kinds of pretty names
[1:36:57] it's dead paint it any color you want to
[1:37:00] it's
[1:37:01] dead we must have the Life of Christ the
[1:37:05] Holy Spirit must be applied to the
[1:37:07] church and when it
[1:37:10] does it creates an
[1:37:14] atmosphere now I want you to get this
[1:37:16] because both wisdom and faith can both
[1:37:21] produce
[1:37:22] atmospheres
[1:37:24] and and brother Brandon would preach
[1:37:26] that sermon wisdom versus faith and he
[1:37:29] would show he said let's let's take
[1:37:32] these two sources what you call
[1:37:34] atmospheres and see what they create so
[1:37:37] wisdom creates an atmosphere and Faith
[1:37:40] creates an
[1:37:42] atmosphere atmospheres both of these
[1:37:45] sources will produce create an
[1:37:48] atmosphere so he said I want to ask you
[1:37:50] something I say this reverently it's to
[1:37:52] make a point point so God forbid did you
[1:37:56] ever go into a church where the pastor
[1:37:58] is real
[1:38:01] starchy the congregation is the same
[1:38:05] way that's right what is it it's that
[1:38:09] atmosphere that brought
[1:38:11] it think about that you go into church
[1:38:15] the pastor's real
[1:38:17] starchy and he says the congregation's
[1:38:20] the same way why he said it's the ad
[1:38:23] atmosphere that brought it you go into
[1:38:25] place we say well wait a minute pastor
[1:38:28] says wait a minute there's no such thing
[1:38:29] is that nonsense I don't believe in such
[1:38:32] thing as Divine Healing about baptism of
[1:38:34] the Holy Ghost you'll see every one of
[1:38:36] them the
[1:38:37] congregation and if there's an eagle in
[1:38:40] there somewhere he'll get
[1:38:43] out he'll get out from amongst that
[1:38:45] bunch of chickens uhhuh exactly the
[1:38:47] truth sure will he can't stand that he's
[1:38:50] an eagle he's skyb built bird not a
[1:38:52] barnyard amen now we find out those
[1:38:55] atmospheres and you get in where faith
[1:38:58] is taught in a church you'll find a
[1:39:01] church in that
[1:39:03] atmosphere sir so let's take the other
[1:39:05] side for a minute will you have faith
[1:39:07] taught in a
[1:39:08] church amen you're going to find a
[1:39:11] church in that
[1:39:13] atmosphere amen because there'll be an
[1:39:15] atmosphere of believing there'll be an
[1:39:18] atmosphere where Miracles can happen
[1:39:20] miracles of a new birth mirac mirales of
[1:39:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Miracles
[1:39:26] that has save you from sin come on
[1:39:29] Miracles that will heal the sick that
[1:39:32] will cast out Devils
[1:39:35] Miracles When Faith is preached when the
[1:39:39] true faith is preached Miracles will
[1:39:44] happen
[1:39:46] now he said oh God let me get this to
[1:39:49] you if you can see it that's the reason
[1:39:52] people come among the saints where
[1:39:55] they're praying Believers Paul said he
[1:39:57] didn't find any in the city Only Timothy
[1:39:59] that was like Precious faith that he had
[1:40:01] you know the rest of them were all
[1:40:04] denominational see but when you he get
[1:40:06] but when he got into that atmosphere see
[1:40:09] he you find those things going the
[1:40:12] atmosphere has created you find people
[1:40:16] living by
[1:40:18] faith when you get in a place where it
[1:40:20] says my why the Bible is true
[1:40:24] God
[1:40:26] heals amen you walk around their
[1:40:29] congregation and you'll find those like
[1:40:31] sister Lanta I was dying of cancer and I
[1:40:34] was
[1:40:36] healed come on Amen what one moment
[1:40:40] dying the next moment
[1:40:43] well amen go back to the doctor and find
[1:40:46] out what not one trace of
[1:40:50] it amen why because fath fa was taught
[1:40:55] and because of that It produced an
[1:40:58] atmosphere and in that atmosphere
[1:41:00] healing took
[1:41:02] place Hallelujah why because we believe
[1:41:06] we were living in Bible days in Bible
[1:41:09] times preaching Bible Doctrine Bible
[1:41:12] truth with Bible Holiness with a living
[1:41:16] God Among Us Hallelujah and we saw a
[1:41:20] living God manifest
[1:41:22] himself
[1:41:25] Hallelujah and that's not the only case
[1:41:29] time would fail us to just go through
[1:41:31] one after another after another after
[1:41:32] another after
[1:41:37] another stranger
[1:41:40] says what what do you mean what was the
[1:41:43] matter with you well I'll show you on my
[1:41:44] record come home with me come eat dinner
[1:41:46] with me I'll show you some I got a
[1:41:48] record there my neighbors know I was
[1:41:50] this kind of condition I was paralyzed
[1:41:52] for years I was pray prayed for what is
[1:41:54] it that word in that
[1:41:57] church listen now that word in that
[1:42:01] church that group of believer has
[1:42:04] created that atmosphere well if we're
[1:42:07] really preaching the
[1:42:08] message if we're really preaching the
[1:42:11] word it will create an atmosphere where
[1:42:14] there will be healings and miracles and
[1:42:17] signs and wonders and power and the
[1:42:21] works of Jesus will
[1:42:26] follow
[1:42:31] Hallelujah say brother Tim you're kind
[1:42:34] of an extreme preacher while this is an
[1:42:36] extreme
[1:42:39] gospel these things are hard to believe
[1:42:41] well you'd have been very hard pressed
[1:42:44] in the days of
[1:42:47] Noah You' been hard pressed in the days
[1:42:50] of
[1:42:51] Enoch when he kept walking with God and
[1:42:54] was not going to be another Enoch in
[1:42:57] this day a bride seventh from the second
[1:43:01] Adam going to take a
[1:43:03] Rapture each step we take takes us
[1:43:06] closer Home the word in that church that
[1:43:09] group of Believers has created that
[1:43:13] atmosphere now how is the word in
[1:43:16] Simplicity but yet in its completion
[1:43:18] ever going to grow in a place where
[1:43:20] knowledge overshadows that and say says
[1:43:23] it can't be so see it can't so when
[1:43:26] knowledge is preached from a seminary
[1:43:29] the children die I don't care if it's a
[1:43:30] message
[1:43:32] Seminary amen when knowledge is preached
[1:43:34] from the Seminary the people die the
[1:43:36] children die amen but when faith is
[1:43:40] preached from the word the children
[1:43:44] live amen that's the different just life
[1:43:47] and death amen you know you know we we
[1:43:51] we know we know the power you know I
[1:43:53] I've I've seen I've been in churches I
[1:43:56] have been in churches calling themselves
[1:43:59] by the by the word of God preach to them
[1:44:02] and and the pastor tell me Well in the
[1:44:05] year 2000 I got a revelation from God
[1:44:07] ain't nobody else going to be
[1:44:12] saved I said
[1:44:14] well Mercy goodness I said I wouldn't
[1:44:18] want to believe
[1:44:19] that I said don't you know what that'll
[1:44:22] do it'll damn your children your
[1:44:23] grandchildren your loved ones everybody
[1:44:25] else I said you can't close the door of
[1:44:31] Mercy amen but you see that produced an
[1:44:35] atmosphere so you know one of their
[1:44:37] preachers come up to me and said brother
[1:44:39] Tim have you seen anybody even in years
[1:44:43] saved I said

[1:48:10] whistled you can hear him you know all
[1:48:13] over the place he just UPS you know in
[1:48:16] his own way

[1:48:20] hold he's still a believer
[1:48:26] does it work he's a married man with
[1:48:29] wonderful children serving the lord it
[1:48:32] works the token works the Holy Ghost

[1:48:38] have you seen people saved yes is Mercy
[1:48:42] over no is it Grace yes it's amazing
[1:48:48] grace it's a god rich in
[1:48:51] Mercy he can take the viest of the viest
[1:48:56] The Sinner of The Sinner he can take a
[1:48:59] man that hadn't hadn't had a a sober day
[1:49:02] in years and years and one moment in his
[1:49:05] present take every bit of it
[1:49:08] [Applause]
[1:49:11] away Chang his life
[1:49:14] forever that's our
[1:49:16] God that's the power of this Christ amen
[1:49:21] that's the workings of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:23] ghost but you see it depends on what
[1:49:27] atmosphere is being preached if wisdom
[1:49:29] is being preached and you can preach the
[1:49:32] same word in wisdom or you can preach
[1:49:35] the same word in
[1:49:43] faith so he
[1:49:45] says so he says you know you get that
[1:49:48] word in that church has produced a
[1:49:54] atmosphere that's what we want produced
[1:49:56] an evening light Tabernacle is an
[1:50:01] atmosphere where the Lost can be saved
[1:50:05] where the drunk never ever drinks again
[1:50:10] where the dop head has found his joy in
[1:50:13] the Lord and he don't need it
[1:50:15] anymore amen come on where faith is
[1:50:19] preached from the word the children live
[1:50:22] amen you see what happened in the Garden
[1:50:25] of Eden there you see there was those
[1:50:27] two atmosphere and and Eve got off of
[1:50:31] the correct one and got onto the wrong
[1:50:33] one and when she did she
[1:50:36] died see here comes Satan with his
[1:50:38] wisdom and what did he do he used to
[1:50:41] quote yeath God
[1:50:51] said
[1:50:53] so he
[1:50:54] said so they cannot stay if your church
[1:50:57] has got that kind of atmosphere of
[1:50:59] wisdom oh child if you want to live
[1:51:02] believe the
[1:51:04] word that's what we want to be as word
[1:51:06] Believers we want to be identified with
[1:51:10] him who is the word now now you know I
[1:51:14] hear it
[1:51:15] said
[1:51:17] oh this atmosphere you're talking about
[1:51:19] it's just culture brother Tim it's just
[1:51:23] culture you're just
[1:51:25] Southern because you're Southern you
[1:51:28] know you are more free and more open and
[1:51:31] you know more more more expressive
[1:51:34] you're not uptight and cold like us
[1:51:39] Northerners so it's just
[1:51:42] culture now we got a Canadian here this
[1:51:44] morning but I'm not preaching that
[1:51:47] her I'll just make a disclaimer there we
[1:51:50] got a few more Canadians around here
[1:51:52] don't raise your hands you'll be
[1:51:56] identified but you know I I want you to
[1:51:58] say brother Brandon spoke of the
[1:52:01] Canadians at Edmonton and he warned
[1:52:05] them he warned them very very sternly
[1:52:09] and this is right in the height of the
[1:52:12] healing Revival it's
[1:52:14] 1957 and he and and and I I I want to
[1:52:18] say this as we as I make these comments
[1:52:21] I don't care where you live I don't care
[1:52:24] what culture you are I don't care what
[1:52:27] race you may be black you may be white
[1:52:30] you may be Hispanic you may be you may
[1:52:33] be Chinese it doesn't matter what race
[1:52:35] you are of course you're all God's
[1:52:37] children but it doesn't matter what you
[1:52:41] you might be
[1:52:42] Jews amen and the holy ghost that made
[1:52:46] Jews shout and dance and speak in
[1:52:49] tongues and glorify God on the day of
[1:52:52] pente because if it gets on a German it
[1:52:55] will make him do the same thing it has
[1:52:59] nothing to do with your
[1:53:01] [Applause]
[1:53:06] nationality brother Bram and God
[1:53:08] projecting his love spoke to the
[1:53:11] Canadians there in Edmonton he said and
[1:53:15] and I I'm not trying to reflect this on
[1:53:17] the churches in
[1:53:18] Edmonton God bless them all this has
[1:53:21] nothing to do with them they wouldn't
[1:53:22] even in existence back then this is this
[1:53:25] is speaking to what I what I'm pretty
[1:53:29] sure was a Pentecostal
[1:53:30] group he said surely I know what I'm
[1:53:33] talking about he wouldn't let me do
[1:53:35] those things and prove he's here and he
[1:53:38] was started singing the song there's a
[1:53:40] fountain filled with blood and was
[1:53:42] making an Altra call said you want to
[1:53:45] make you want to lose your guilty stains
[1:53:47] come on down now each one of what's the
[1:53:50] matter with you Canadians what's the the
[1:53:52] matter it's a good thing to be
[1:53:54] conservative but don't be too
[1:53:57] starchy you're going to grieve the holy
[1:54:00] spirit away from you and you won't have
[1:54:02] no Revival listen to me I speak in the
[1:54:05] name of the Lord break up that
[1:54:07] stubbornness among you that starching
[1:54:10] get to your knees you know you need
[1:54:12] repenting I speak in Jesus Christ's name
[1:54:15] yes sir if you want to have Revival warm
[1:54:18] your heart to
[1:54:19] God and then he goes on he says here
[1:54:22] you're too starchy you better get right
[1:54:25] with God because the hour is coming when
[1:54:27] you're going to scream to find this and
[1:54:30] you won't find it thus sayeth the Lord
[1:54:33] that's God speaking find your way to the
[1:54:35] altar you are different in different
[1:54:38] shame on you when the Holy Spirit come
[1:54:40] and do things he's doing right in the
[1:54:42] midst of you and you sit like you're
[1:54:43] froze to death get out of the seat and
[1:54:46] get to the altar repent or perish that's
[1:54:48] true don't know why I'm saying this
[1:54:50] something is saying to me to say it I'm
[1:54:53] giving you a warning this may be your
[1:54:55] last one too you repent I don't care
[1:54:57] what church you belong to if you're not
[1:54:59] repenting to the love of God not in your
[1:55:01] heart you're a sinner on your way to
[1:55:02] hell that's thus sayith the Lord and he
[1:55:05] goes on he said you've got to have a a
[1:55:08] breaking up before you can be remolded
[1:55:10] again you just went to church so long
[1:55:13] you got so
[1:55:14] mossback and stiff about it that's right
[1:55:17] you need a repentance you need an
[1:55:19] oldfashioned experience of God's love in
[1:55:22] your your heart and and you remind my
[1:55:24] voice will haunt you as long as you're
[1:55:27] Immortal that's true I speak it in Jesus
[1:55:29] Christ's name let me say something else
[1:55:32] another thing you got something against
[1:55:34] somebody you better be making it right
[1:55:36] right now it's setting off dark in this
[1:55:40] building think about that amen what a
[1:55:44] what a stiff
[1:55:45] warning so it doesn't matter it doesn't
[1:55:48] matter whether you're Canadian whether
[1:55:50] you're cold northerner whether you're
[1:55:52] you're a Mexican whether you're Hispanic
[1:55:54] whether you're German what what your
[1:55:57] your nationality has nothing to do with
[1:55:59] it break out of that stubborn spirit
[1:56:03] that says I ain't going to worship god
[1:56:05] oh you're not going to make me I'm not
[1:56:07] trying to make you do anything I'm
[1:56:09] giving you opportunity to Worship the
[1:56:12] Lord of Lord and the king of kings and
[1:56:15] to wash his feet and make him
[1:56:20] welcome break out out of your mold break
[1:56:24] out of where you've
[1:56:25] been break up the follow
[1:56:29] ground yes sir
[1:56:31] hallu you
[1:56:34] see you make up that atmosphere with
[1:56:36] what you are on inside of you so the
[1:56:39] atmosphere in this church is made up of
[1:56:42] what's inside the
[1:56:44] Believers amen and the atmosphere or the
[1:56:48] or should say the spirit of Leo
[1:56:53] will make your atmosphere
[1:56:57] dark if you have the Holy Ghost then its
[1:57:01] atmosphere will manifest I want you to
[1:57:05] understand there's something about
[1:57:07] atmosphere it is actually a supernatural
[1:57:13] thing
[1:57:15] amen and you can create an
[1:57:19] atmosphere because you are a super
[1:57:22] natural being if you have been born
[1:57:24] again and even if you're not a
[1:57:25] supernatural being you well everybody is
[1:57:29] you're either God or the devil there's
[1:57:31] only two spirits in the world you're
[1:57:34] either ruled by the holy ghost or the
[1:57:36] devil's got the hold of your life come
[1:57:38] on Amen it's the devil that makes you do
[1:57:41] things that are contrary to the word and
[1:57:43] live an Unholy
[1:57:46] life amen so you see whatever your
[1:57:50] atmosphere is or what's on the inside of
[1:57:52] you is going to produce an
[1:57:55] atmosphere and if we're people with the
[1:57:58] Holy
[1:57:59] Ghost it ought to produce an
[1:58:01] atmosphere of the holy ghost
[1:58:04] moving it ought to produce an atmosphere
[1:58:07] that people love to come amen they love
[1:58:11] to come like they love to come to Youth
[1:58:13] Camp I know there's Deliverance for me I
[1:58:15] know the power of God is there I know I
[1:58:19] know I can be healed I know I can be
[1:58:22] saved I know I can have Deliverance for
[1:58:25] my husband for my child for my
[1:58:31] need amen you talking about an action
[1:58:34] church we ought to be Jesus Christ an
[1:58:36] action on the
[1:58:39] earth Jesus began to teach and do it's
[1:58:44] not just teaching it's also
[1:58:49] doing so atmosphere is a supernatural
[1:58:52] things and when the presence of the Lord
[1:58:55] comes down it creates an atmosphere for
[1:58:59] Faith that's why we don't want to have a
[1:59:03] meeting that the atmosphere isn't
[1:59:06] charged with the Holy Ghost oh yeah
[1:59:10] sometimes it's sobering sometimes it's
[1:59:12] solemn sometimes it's soul searching
[1:59:14] sometimes you sit quiet sometimes you
[1:59:16] sit there on the edge of your seat and
[1:59:18] you're intense and you're listening and
[1:59:20] you're hardly responding but but you are
[1:59:25] responding
[1:59:27] amen and in other times it's
[1:59:30] Joy amen Joy bells are flowing and we're
[1:59:33] rejoicing and shouting you see it ain't
[1:59:36] all running the
[1:59:37] aisles or jumping the benches that ain't
[1:59:40] what it's all about amen it's but it's
[1:59:43] getting in the atmosphere where the
[1:59:46] presence of the Lord comes down amen and
[1:59:50] creates an atmosphere for for
[1:59:56] Faith now
[1:59:58] actually you're own faith will produce
[2:00:02] an
[2:00:04] atmosphere you see you get to believe in
[2:00:07] God and things are going to
[2:00:09] happen you go to
[2:00:14] expecting you you you know people people
[2:00:17] come here for our special
[2:00:20] meetings and and they they will come you
[2:00:22] know expec and hear the speaker and
[2:00:25] expecting the Lord to speak to them and
[2:00:27] I know that the Lord's going to do
[2:00:29] certain things and mighty things and
[2:00:31] wonderful things and they come with that
[2:00:33] expectation and that faith and that
[2:00:35] expectation produces an atmosphere and
[2:00:38] that atmosphere produces
[2:00:44] results but we don't have to have
[2:00:46] special
[2:00:48] meetings every service at evening light

[2:05:39] church if it's not
[2:05:42] there then you have a job to

[2:06:01] God here well I tell you what when I

[2:06:37] the house of

[2:06:42] here but they began to create an
[2:06:47] atmosphere hallelujah amen they forget
[2:06:50] to pray begin to expect they came with
[2:06:53] expectation they came with a hope they
[2:06:56] came with a PR and they begin to
[2:06:59] exercise that and then they begin to
[2:07:02] pray then sing and then worship they're
[2:07:05] not just making pretty
[2:07:07] music they're inviting the
[2:07:10] [Applause]
[2:07:13] presence and the Holy Ghost comes down
[2:07:16] and when the Holy Ghost come down
[2:07:18] there's
[2:07:19] atmosphere and like I said if it ain't
[2:07:21] here you
[2:07:23] [Applause]
[2:07:30] created each one of you people that are
[2:07:33] born again is a Creator we must create
[2:07:38] an
[2:07:41] atmosphere so full and complete
[2:07:45] obedience put you in the word one yeah
[2:07:48] you believe it every bit it's all in you
[2:07:51] and you watch it working through
[2:07:53] you and when you let the word and you
[2:07:55] become one then it lives itself out and
[2:07:58] then you become a walk in Epistle of
[2:08:00] Jesus
[2:08:02] Christ when he's got complete control of
[2:08:05] you to make every word I'm going to make
[2:08:07] a few more points but I'm not going to
[2:08:09] promise to
[2:08:16] close so brother bradam would make an
[2:08:20] assessment of things after being on the
[2:08:22] field for some
[2:08:26] time at this point was from 1946 or
[2:08:32] 7 to where it was 1953 and he preaches a
[2:08:35] series calls Israel in the church by now
[2:08:39] he's got a pretty good thumb on the
[2:08:42] movement where an angel of God had
[2:08:45] appeared to
[2:08:49] him stepping out of a light a pillar of
[2:08:52] fire you know there's a pillar of
[2:08:56] fire in Israel it led the children of
[2:08:59] Israel that is that is the Holy
[2:09:03] Ghost and he veils himself behind a
[2:09:07] light God is
[2:09:09] light Paul would see him on the road to
[2:09:12] Damascus and he and he would know that
[2:09:16] that would be God because it was a
[2:09:18] bright light and it blinded
[2:09:20] him and he said who art thou Lord now he
[2:09:23] would have never called that Lord being
[2:09:24] a Jew unless he recognized this was the
[2:09:27] light of the Old Testament so he said
[2:09:29] who art thy Lord and he says I am Jesus
[2:09:32] that's right so if you want to know who
[2:09:34] the Lord
[2:09:36] is the god of the Old Testament he's
[2:09:42] Jesus I am
[2:09:45] Jesus so you
[2:09:47] see again the pillar of fire would would
[2:09:50] would appear here to this
[2:09:53] man and what he what he
[2:09:56] did coming out of that light stepped a
[2:09:59] man an angel of
[2:10:03] God and it would tell him of his
[2:10:05] misunderstood low ways and misunderstood
[2:10:08] life and that he was sent to bring a
[2:10:11] gift of healing to to the to the
[2:10:15] world and he was to pray for the
[2:10:19] sick well
[2:10:22] so this now would be after many many
[2:10:25] meetings and seeing God move in
[2:10:28] tremendous ways this would be after the
[2:10:32] South African meetings where there would
[2:10:34] be thousands saved and healed at the
[2:10:37] same time truckloads of crutches and
[2:10:40] Wheelchairs and everything else blind
[2:10:43] eyes seeing deaf hearing tremendous
[2:10:46] things like I said we believe in extreme
[2:10:50] gospel
[2:10:52] we believe that Bible days are here
[2:10:55] again now so but he would say now he
[2:11:00] talk about the church in the in the
[2:11:02] different
[2:11:03] spheres spheres that it's in he said now
[2:11:07] here's one sphere and here's another
[2:11:09] sphere and here's another one and down
[2:11:11] here is the nominal church now in here
[2:11:14] and up here is subblime here's where we
[2:11:16] supposed to be next right next door to
[2:11:18] heaven where the powers of God are
[2:11:20] leaking down and it drops on down and
[2:11:22] drops on down through this one to that
[2:11:24] one till this one and this is a nominal
[2:11:26] Church it goes on just on cold
[2:11:28] professions little ritualistic Affair
[2:11:31] that's the nomal church they just get
[2:11:33] the very slight drippings next Church up
[2:11:35] here is Full Gospel get some of the
[2:11:37] blessings but they go off in isms if we
[2:11:40] got to if we got to lift up into this
[2:11:43] next sphere here before we can ever go
[2:11:46] into a Rapture you got to get up in that
[2:11:50] before we can ever have it that's true
[2:11:52] so in other words he he said we're going
[2:11:54] to have to take a step
[2:11:56] higher remember we're Enochs we're the
[2:12:00] seventh from the second Adam seventh
[2:12:02] Church
[2:12:03] age all the way to Le oosa and we are
[2:12:06] the anex and we're walking with God so
[2:12:10] we're taking steps now and then to doing
[2:12:14] so he said we're going to have to step
[2:12:16] up another
[2:12:18] round so we're going to have to get off
[2:12:20] of where we're just getting nominal
[2:12:23] blessings which is a lot where a lot of
[2:12:25] message churches find theirselves in
[2:12:28] others you know where slight dressings
[2:12:30] but we want to get into where the full
[2:12:32] blessings of God I'm not satisfied with
[2:12:37] just being in the lower
[2:12:40] reals are you with me I I don't want a
[2:12:43] church that's that way I want a church
[2:12:44] that has so much Faith it's rapturing
[2:12:48] Faith so much grace it's rapturing Grace
[2:12:52] come
[2:12:53] on I want to I want us to live in the
[2:12:58] heavenlies brother John leay and I were
[2:13:02] driving along the other day we were
[2:13:04] going to to streetport to get some
[2:13:07] supplies for my house he he helped me
[2:13:10] quite a bit there getting things ready
[2:13:13] to make my move and he told me as we
[2:13:16] were going and we were actually talking
[2:13:19] about the services Sunday and lamb for
[2:13:22] the household or and and then I may have
[2:13:25] been brother Donnie Reagan's what a
[2:13:27] great sermon that was but anyway he he
[2:13:30] said you know brother Tim he said I just
[2:13:33] want to get where I just live in the
[2:13:40] heavenlies and he told me about the
[2:13:42] pressures in
[2:13:46] China where he was always under the
[2:13:49] threat of persecu ution and
[2:13:57] arrest you may not know this man but
[2:13:59] he's a hero in my
[2:14:02] eyes he would leave just knowing that
[2:14:06] there was millions that had never heard
[2:14:08] the name of Christ and nobody was taking
[2:14:11] anything to him and he started smuggling
[2:14:13] Bibles into the
[2:14:18] country and God was with him in a
[2:14:20] supernatural
[2:14:22] away you don't know this but even like
[2:14:25] Tabernacle supported him we sent sermons
[2:14:27] to him you know right to CH China
[2:14:29] address tapes sermons from our library
[2:14:32] here for him to you know to feed on to
[2:14:35] catch the atmosphere to to keep you know
[2:14:38] to to to encourage him they were a
[2:14:41] Lifeline wasn't they brother
[2:14:43] John and so as we you know he he saw
[2:14:47] phenomenal Miracles that took place you
[2:14:50] know where God would blind the eyes of
[2:14:52] the officials and let the entire
[2:14:55] shipments come in books and and sermons
[2:15:00] and witness material and all of that
[2:15:03] going in and you know and but he was
[2:15:06] always Under
[2:15:08] Pressure but that pressure made him live
[2:15:11] in the
[2:15:13] heavenlies he had to be sensitive to the
[2:15:16] Holy
[2:15:17] Ghost he had to be sensitive to its
[2:15:20] leaders ship I'm going
[2:15:23] somewhere because I want to tell you you
[2:15:26] are also Under Pressure that's
[2:15:29] right and it ain't the Chinese
[2:15:32] government where people rot in jail for
[2:15:35] years and years and years and years and
[2:15:37] even the US government will forget
[2:15:40] them but we're under pressure look what
[2:15:43] happened to Israel here the other day
[2:15:45] with their Invasion that same evil
[2:15:48] spirits are coming in against us
[2:15:51] in a ecclesiastical manner in a
[2:15:54] spiritual manner pressure upon the bride
[2:15:58] you you know people have said well we we
[2:16:00] want the squeeze you know we can't do
[2:16:02] nothing till the squeeze come well hello
[2:16:05] you are
[2:16:07] here amen it's not coming in the
[2:16:10] physical manner that like it does to the
[2:16:12] Jews it comes in an ecclesiastical
[2:16:15] manner because what they receive
[2:16:17] naturally we receive spiritually so you
[2:16:20] understand there is a difference between
[2:16:22] us but one is reflecting the other and
[2:16:26] watch Israel what's happening in Israel
[2:16:28] is the same attack against your family
[2:16:31] yourself your church your
[2:16:39] pastor you're under
[2:16:43] threat and instead of being withdrawn
[2:16:48] hiding depressed
[2:16:51] worried fearful oh attack my wife
[2:16:55] brother
[2:17:00] him did not I show you how to act when
[2:17:05] your wife was
[2:17:10] attacked how many times did I come out
[2:17:12] here preaching
[2:17:15] discouragement how many times did I come
[2:17:17] out with my head bowed
[2:17:19] low how how many times did I create an
[2:17:23] atmosphere of depression on this
[2:17:26] church it didn't
[2:17:29] happen why I knew we was the
[2:17:32] winner I knew we can't
[2:17:35] lose amen I knew that whatever we go
[2:17:38] through that God is on our side and
[2:17:41] we're coming out
[2:17:43] Victorious Hallelujah I did not start
[2:17:46] out to be a loser I started this race to
[2:17:50] be a winner and when I
[2:17:52] [Applause]
[2:17:57] will living in the heavenlies hearing
[2:18:01] from Heaven Guided by Heaven expecting
[2:18:05] Miracles he'd walk right through the
[2:18:08] government lines packing message
[2:18:10] material without them even seeing him
[2:18:14] that's listen God wants more than
[2:18:18] ritualistic
[2:18:19] Farms he wants more than just a
[2:18:21] denominational church members Pew armers
[2:18:25] he wants men and women on fire for God
[2:18:28] this bride will by no means be a lot of
[2:18:31] sin she will not be lukewarm she will be
[2:18:34] on fire for God Amen that's the
[2:18:37] Declaration so the token must display
[2:18:41] its power in the
[2:18:45] church that's where it must be
[2:18:48] displayed we know of the warning of the
[2:18:51] Holy Spirit what it would be in the end
[2:18:54] time and the leoan age but I also want
[2:18:56] to re remind you that there are
[2:18:59] Overcomers in Leo deia yes there is the
[2:19:02] lukewarm the Christ rejectors yes there
[2:19:06] is those who who are naked and blind and
[2:19:10] wretched and don't know it yes that is
[2:19:13] also Leia but there is another people in
[2:19:17] Le oia who are Overcomers
[2:19:21] they wear the robe of white amen they
[2:19:24] have the gold they are not poor and
[2:19:28] riched come on somebody they will sit
[2:19:30] with him on his throne they are
[2:19:34] Overcomers amen no matter what you see
[2:19:37] in Leo deia know this there is also
[2:19:40] another group of people right here in
[2:19:43] Leo
[2:19:46] deia one is called The Church the other
[2:19:48] is called the bride let me be a part of
[2:19:51] the
[2:19:51] Bride amen and she is not going down
[2:19:54] she's going up amen I want you to hear
[2:19:58] the message loud and clear in the vision
[2:20:01] you have been seen walking with the word
[2:20:04] stepping to the music and instead of
[2:20:06] going down going
[2:20:09] up you are not falling little church you
[2:20:13] are
[2:20:14] rising you're not going to drown hey man
[2:20:18] you're going to
[2:20:19] swim
[2:20:24] the
[2:20:25] atmosphere you
[2:20:27] see that's what brother Brandon would
[2:20:30] say what we need is a holy ghost
[2:20:33] atmosphere where the power of God's
[2:20:35] moving with one
[2:20:36] Accord and he said you sit
[2:20:39] there and you know you come down you
[2:20:43] just say well I don't know about it well
[2:20:45] you hurt the other person because you're
[2:20:47] creating an
[2:20:49] atmosphere
[2:20:52] and guess
[2:20:54] what if I get to preach long enough and
[2:20:57] hit the vein hard enough I'm going to
[2:21:00] cast you Devils
[2:21:03] out and I'm not talking about
[2:21:08] people I'm talking about the demons that
[2:21:11] would want to hold back the movement of
[2:21:13] the Holy
[2:21:15] Ghost amen you you see you can hurt the
[2:21:18] other person you can hurt the other
[2:21:20] person right next to you but do you
[2:21:23] realize if you get in the right
[2:21:25] atmosphere and you begin to worship God
[2:21:28] and you begin to respond and you quit
[2:21:31] sitting there with your arms folded but
[2:21:33] you start entering into the service of
[2:21:35] God don't you know it will affect those
[2:21:37] that are around
[2:21:40] you Hallelujah I tell you what there's
[2:21:43] some of you that have been so dead and
[2:21:45] dry for so long if the Holy Ghost would
[2:21:47] get a hold of you and move on your life
[2:21:50] we would everyone shout about
[2:21:52] it hallelujah amen it would create such
[2:21:56] an atmosphere because we said dead
[2:21:59] people come to life we saw those who
[2:22:02] were
[2:22:04] dead live
[2:22:10] again expectancy will get Unity among
[2:22:13] the people that's what happened on the
[2:22:14] day of Pentecost brother brandham told
[2:22:16] us they were there they had received the
[2:22:19] Holy Ghost and seed form like getting an
[2:22:21] acre it's you know it's not an oak tree
[2:22:24] but you have the potential Jesus had
[2:22:26] breathed on them and said receive you
[2:22:27] the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost had
[2:22:29] not yet come because Jesus had not yet
[2:22:31] ascended and had not sent it
[2:22:36] back I'll send you another
[2:22:41] comforter I've comforted you walking
[2:22:43] with you as human but I'm not going to
[2:22:46] comfort you that way anymore I'm going
[2:22:48] to send you another comforter I will
[2:22:50] come to
[2:22:52] you how did he come on the day of
[2:22:55] Pentecost in the form of the Holy Ghost
[2:22:57] not another deity the same
[2:23:00] God the same
[2:23:03] Jesus
[2:23:04] amen so uh brother Tim is the Holy Ghost
[2:23:08] and Jesus the Same well the Holy Ghost
[2:23:10] just the spirit of
[2:23:12] Jesus Jesus had breathed on them and
[2:23:15] they had it in potential and every one
[2:23:17] of you have the Holy Ghost potentially
[2:23:20] those without it have the Holy Ghost
[2:23:23] potentially you have the promise that's
[2:23:25] the
[2:23:27] potential amen and what they did when
[2:23:31] they got in the upper room once they got
[2:23:33] Pastor
[2:23:36] politics you know they had to get past
[2:23:38] voted in another apostle that never am
[2:23:40] mounted to a hill of beans cuz God had
[2:23:42] his own man he's going to put there man
[2:23:44] can't put them there well we're going to
[2:23:47] we're going to select this one and he'll
[2:23:48] take the place of Judas and this and
[2:23:50] that once they got Pastor
[2:23:52] politics they got together and now boys
[2:23:56] what we're really here for let's get
[2:23:58] down to real business we're here because
[2:24:01] he promised the power would come from on
[2:24:06] high and he breathed on us and said
[2:24:08] receive the Holy Ghost and told us to T
[2:24:10] in Jerusalem till we got it and so now
[2:24:13] that's why we're really here you know if
[2:24:16] we get all this we got all this
[2:24:18] Apostolic succession behind politics in
[2:24:21] the church and our church politics and
[2:24:23] all this and who's going to be Bishop
[2:24:24] here and who's going to do this that we
[2:24:26] got to pass all of that but now let's
[2:24:29] focus on the real thing oh if the bride
[2:24:32] of Christ would get past all the
[2:24:35] politics of big I and little you and I'm
[2:24:39] the leader and I'm the one's got the
[2:24:40] truth and I'm the one that's leading the
[2:24:42] bride we can impal all of the
[2:24:45] politics amen and even in even in light
[2:24:48] Tabernacle we just forget the politics
[2:24:51] of it well they let this and preach and
[2:24:53] he's not my favorite and they do this
[2:24:55] and I you know I don't like that song
[2:24:57] and then they sing that and I don't I
[2:24:59] like this song leader better than that
[2:25:00] one and you know this and and that one
[2:25:02] drives me crazy and if they sing that
[2:25:04] one song one more time I'll quit well go
[2:25:06] ahead and
[2:25:09] quit
[2:25:11] amen don't quit

[2:25:16] [Music]
[2:25:18] nonsense amen get your poic behind you
[2:25:21] and get

[2:25:32] he's here for that amen what are we here
[2:25:35] for we're here to create an atmosphere
[2:25:38] where he will come
[2:25:40] down amen because we want the Holy Ghost

[2:25:46] in the camp we want him in our lives we
[2:25:49] want the Death Angel to Passover when
[2:25:52] other churches are
[2:25:54] dying we want our church to live because
[2:25:58] the bleeding word has life in
[2:26:02] it and so they kept blessing god brother
[2:26:05] brandham told us what they were doing he
[2:26:07] said they kept blessing God until the
[2:26:10] atmosphere got just
