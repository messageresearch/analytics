[50:50] god bless you as you're seated she's not
[50:54] able to be here with us today but we
[50:56] have a new addition to the family Butler
[51:00] Michael Dexter and his wife Bethany my
[51:03] daughter has given birth to a new grand
[51:06] a new grandchild for us Karen and my and
[51:10] my my wife and I we have this new little
[51:14] one that the Lord has blessed us with
[51:16] and of course Michael and Bethany are
[51:18] proud parents and William and drew
[51:21] welcomed them big brother again and big
[51:25] brother
[51:26] any man that are real proud to have this
[51:30] little one and part of the family and we
[51:32] is even in like tavern I feel proud to
[51:34] have her a part of our church family
[51:36] amen so we want to say congratulations
[51:38] to them now if you remember this was one
[51:42] of the promises I claimed at the ruins
[51:45] Shilo when I was in Israel we had some
[51:49] real situations that had come up there
[51:53] with Bethenny we'll be talking about it
[51:54] here for a moment
[51:56] but I want you to remember as we have
[51:59] been coming to this moment the Holy
[52:02] Spirit just directed me as we have been
[52:06] spiritually talking about some great
[52:08] things about the new birth I've been
[52:10] preaching about the barren church
[52:12] bringing forth Christ back to the earth
[52:14] again and that we have returned to the
[52:18] Pentecost the land of the Holy Ghost and
[52:21] that there's to be a church born of the
[52:24] breath of God and asking is there any
[52:27] strength to bring forth and that we that
[52:31] it is a battle for our inheritance and
[52:34] so all of these sermons you know leading
[52:38] up and now we have this little baby that
[52:42] has come to birth and see yourself is a
[52:45] miracle baby and I believe that it's a
[52:48] sign to us
[52:50] amen that there is strength to bring
[52:53] forth and amen but it's going to be a
[52:55] battle
[52:56] it surely will be a battle after four
[53:01] miscarriages then a image and the uterus
[53:05] at six weeks along in the pregnancy at
[53:09] 12 weeks they couldn't find the
[53:11] heartbeat until we got we got to pray in
[53:14] and they and then they could find it and
[53:16] then at 19 weeks they discovered that
[53:19] she had a two cord vessel instead of a
[53:26] normal three and this caused concern by
[53:29] the doctors that this baby wouldn't
[53:31] develop normally at 29 weeks the stomach
[53:36] and legs were judged to a measured as
[53:40] too small and it was that we're very
[53:43] concerned about this and you know so
[53:47] this was something that was great or
[53:50] great concern actually sometimes earlier
[53:54] in the summer I think God is so good to
[53:56] us
[53:57] because I had a very very vivid dream
[54:00] and I saw Bethany handing me a little
[54:04] dark headed little girl with curly hair
[54:06] about five eight months old I'm not sure
[54:09] exactly what her age was but as she
[54:12] handed her to me I saw especially you
[54:15] know the little fat legs were and feet
[54:18] were bare as she handed her to me and I
[54:21] looked at him and they were perfectly
[54:23] formed and normal so when this news came
[54:28] that it wasn't you know that was
[54:29] underdeveloped and I had that was way
[54:32] too big for the body and and the stomach
[54:35] that was not developed and the legs
[54:36] underdeveloped I knew that wasn't true
[54:39] because I'd already seen her in God good
[54:43] to us so you know it was too late for
[54:45] Satan to try that because I'd already
[54:48] seen it but right after the fall
[54:51] meetings Bethany was to go for a checkup
[54:54] and to determine the growth of the child
[54:58] and and so on as she was under the care
[55:00] of a specialist and on Saturday at the
[55:03] fall meetings
[55:04] you will remember brother Ron prayed for
[55:07] her and on the following Tuesday was her
[55:12] doctor's checkup and they were amazed at
[55:16] her stomach and legs had nearly doubled
[55:19] in size and at birth she is a
[55:22] proportionate healthy baby passed every
[55:25] test in her exam by the pediatrician
[55:28] Amen hallelujah
[55:31] what a mighty God
[55:34] mighty God sometimes you know even in
[55:38] those moments your faith is tried you
[55:41] have many highs and many lows and many -
[55:45] you know many victories and then it
[55:47] looks like the the enemy comes again and
[55:51] right down to the end our faith was
[55:54] tested my Michael Dexter was there as
[55:57] you know he's a and are in that and so
[56:01] he was there in the delivery room with
[56:03] his wife and child and and normal
[56:05] neonate heart rate is generally 120 to
[56:08] 160 s it begins below hundred at after
[56:12] birth they are often required extra
[56:15] oxygen to help the heart rate if it gets
[56:17] below sixty after the birth and oxygen
[56:20] hadn't helped they sometimes require
[56:22] chest compressions and Bethany's labor
[56:25] progressed very rapidly and Michael said
[56:28] that as we started getting closer to the
[56:31] time of delivery the contractions really
[56:33] intensified and I noticed the baby's
[56:35] heart rate had dropped down to the low
[56:37] 60s for a little bit and then came back
[56:39] up as the contractions grew harder the
[56:42] heart rate kept dropping again this can
[56:44] mean that the cord is getting compressed
[56:46] and the charge nurse commented on and
[56:48] said we may need to move her move real
[56:50] quickly here she's having heart rate
[56:53] issues but he just silently prayed that
[56:56] the Lord would protect her and he knew
[56:57] that after all we had come through there
[57:00] was no way we could have a major issue
[57:03] like this right now
[57:04] and not come through with the victory
[57:06] and so she delivered fine without
[57:09] requiring any emergency procedures are
[57:12] needing any additional oxygen
[57:15] although the nurses had it set up and
[57:17] ready to go because of the heart rate
[57:19] concern so she's certainly a miracle
[57:22] baby and we're getting ready for another
[57:24] miracle a man for another miracle a man
[57:28] too many vindications to believe
[57:30] otherwise we we had God sign and the
[57:35] scripture given to me at the Sea of
[57:37] Galilee as I looked early in the morning
[57:40] and looked across the Sea of Galilee and
[57:43] was so moved because as the Sun came
[57:47] at the rising of the Sun and I just
[57:49] realized our Lord Jesus and the
[57:52] disciples and many others down to the
[57:54] ages had looked across that sea at the
[57:57] very same Sun and as I as I did
[58:01] scripture came to me it was very very
[58:04] pertinent to this then as we as we there
[58:09] prayed about the that very thing brother
[58:12] Timothy have a vision the sister asked
[58:16] her given birth to a child and we had a
[58:19] prayer and a witness at Shiloh and an
[58:22] angel visitation also right here in the
[58:26] in the church you remember that and
[58:28] brother Michael coming out and telling
[58:30] about the bump in the boat we won't go
[58:32] into all of this today but I just want
[58:34] to say we're walking in the vision a man
[58:37] and your name was called there two amens
[58:40] of the promises for Candace also and
[58:42] forever and for a barren church because
[58:46] that was really upon my heart is and not
[58:48] only for a barren church for it but for
[58:50] barren souls that have never brought
[58:54] forth of birth Amen of the Holy Ghost in
[58:57] their lives my prayer for was that to a
[58:59] man and we've seen God bein doing a lot
[59:03] of things now of course of course we
[59:06] didn't come down to this end and have a
[59:08] stillborn baby we had a baby with life
[59:11] in it a man and it came with emotion it
[59:15] came with shouting or screaming out and
[59:17] just um III think what brother Branham
[59:20] said about a stillborn births he said
[59:23] what we need today is a good old
[59:25] heartfelt religion let me tell you
[59:28] something if a baby's born that baby
[59:30] don't cry don't whine they don't open
[59:32] his little mouth and say a thing well
[59:34] you know nothing happens what's the
[59:36] matter with the baby he's born dead and
[59:38] he said I think we still we got too many
[59:40] still births today yeah in the church
[59:42] fella come up and say do you believe God
[59:45] the Father Almighty Creator heaven earth
[59:48] Jesus Christ son yes I do we you promise
[59:51] to do so and so for this church yes take
[59:53] his a little salt shake and and drop a
[59:55] few drops of water on him and give him
[59:58] the right hand of fellowship and put him
[59:59] in
[59:59] Church that stillborn babies yeah what
[1:00:03] happened when a baby born if he don't
[1:00:05] cry as soon as he drops the earth what's
[1:00:08] the first thing you do to him is pick
[1:00:10] him up and turn him over your arm and
[1:00:12] give him a little what do you call it
[1:00:14] you paddle him that's right you give him
[1:00:16] a little a few wraps like that and the
[1:00:18] first thing you know why here here he
[1:00:20] goes you got a baby living and that's
[1:00:22] what it needs today in the church is is
[1:00:27] not somebody to say now I know it might
[1:00:29] not be the right thing to do that little
[1:00:31] fide thing but you need a preacher
[1:00:34] behind the pulpit that it to you that a
[1:00:36] tear you to pieces
[1:00:39] do you get squallin out once in a while
[1:00:40] and that God come in and let something
[1:00:43] take place and then you're born not that
[1:00:46] somebody you baby around your sins and
[1:00:48] say oh well our forefathers believe that
[1:00:50] and our forefathers my Bible said it's
[1:00:54] right that's what's right is our Bible
[1:00:57] and the same Holy Ghost that fell on the
[1:00:59] day of Pentecost which we all know is
[1:01:01] the birth of the new church if that same
[1:01:03] honest spirit doesn't bring the same
[1:01:06] experience to you then you've got a
[1:01:08] different Holy Spirit than what that was
[1:01:10] exactly right if it don't make you a
[1:01:12] live a sacrificial life a life full of
[1:01:16] joy and pleasure and the baptism of the
[1:01:18] Spirit leading you into signs and
[1:01:21] wonders and miracles and things there's
[1:01:23] that there's something happened Jesus
[1:01:25] said these signs shall follow them that
[1:01:27] believe a man so and just I want you to
[1:01:33] share this one with you just in case
[1:01:34] some would think that changed after the
[1:01:37] seven seals was open let me read you
[1:01:40] from birth pains he said now you take
[1:01:42] some little kind of a shock maybe
[1:01:45] wouldn't have to spark him but shock him
[1:01:47] a little bit the very idea of him being
[1:01:49] born sometimes would do him grab him
[1:01:51] shake him he don't start breathing spank
[1:01:53] him a little and then he yells having
[1:01:56] the unknown tongues himself I guess but
[1:01:58] anyhow he's making a noise and I think
[1:02:01] if a baby is born just by still birth
[1:02:03] with no sound no emotion that's a dead
[1:02:05] baby and that's what's the matter with
[1:02:08] the church today the system we got too
[1:02:10] many still more than children that's
[1:02:11] right
[1:02:12] they need a gospel spankin you see so
[1:02:15] wake them up to bring them to their
[1:02:17] selves so that God can breathe the
[1:02:19] breath of life into them
[1:02:20] we know that's so true he said his crude
[1:02:23] theology but it's a truth anyhow we're
[1:02:27] gonna be speaking today about our land
[1:02:31] of promise again where we of course have
[1:02:36] been speaking is about that the people
[1:02:40] the people of the book have returned to
[1:02:43] the land of the book and then we're
[1:02:47] going to be speaking today on this part
[1:02:49] as faith is our victory now I was
[1:02:53] speaking last Sunday on the battle for
[1:02:56] our inheritance and so we've been
[1:02:59] speaking on that line but faith is our
[1:03:02] victory we must seize it from the enemy
[1:03:06] remember we cannot be apathetic about
[1:03:10] this we must we cannot be lukewarm about
[1:03:12] this we must must say this is I'll and
[1:03:16] this is our inheritance and God gave it
[1:03:20] to me and I'm gonna receive that a man
[1:03:24] now the Bible said that ye shall
[1:03:26] dispossessed the inhabitants of the land
[1:03:29] which means take possession out inherit
[1:03:32] to occupy and we must proclaim ourselves
[1:03:35] as an heir to it I am an heir to this
[1:03:39] land God has given it to me now you know
[1:03:43] we are in the greatest battle ever
[1:03:45] fought we would really look in
[1:03:48] Revelation 12 and you could see there's
[1:03:50] a war going on for heavenly places where
[1:03:54] Lucifer and Michael are battling it out
[1:03:56] in Revelation 12 and then where did we
[1:03:59] find that he's cast to the earth and
[1:04:01] when he does there's a redeemed people
[1:04:03] that are caught up into the heavens and
[1:04:06] that they are saying now is come
[1:04:09] salvation and the Kingdom of our God and
[1:04:12] so as we're speaking about that we know
[1:04:16] we're in a great battle in this end time
[1:04:20] and and just to quote brother branham
[1:04:23] from the greatest battle ever father
[1:04:25] said on the great hour of charge is at
[1:04:28] hand
[1:04:29] hallelujah soldiers with armors cleamen
[1:04:33] and colors streaming faith and doubt is
[1:04:35] set in yourself an array in this
[1:04:37] tabernacle this morning down on one side
[1:04:40] faith on the other soldiers standing
[1:04:43] supposed to duty hallelujah our captain
[1:04:46] the morning star leads own he never goes
[1:04:49] back he don't know the word retreat he
[1:04:52] don't have to retreat the greatest
[1:04:55] battle ever fought he's going on right
[1:04:58] in here now yes sir between life and
[1:05:01] death between sickness and health
[1:05:04] between Liberty and bondage the battle
[1:05:08] his own shyness fears soldiers polish up
[1:05:12] the armor God is getting his soldiers
[1:05:15] ready Amen God anoints his army so I
[1:05:19] believe that God is prepared and called
[1:05:21] the people for this end amazed to take
[1:05:24] their stand as the sons and daughters of
[1:05:26] God and God gave us the greatest weapon
[1:05:30] to defeat the devil with and of course
[1:05:33] that's the Word of God but Satan wants
[1:05:36] to take the power out of it and he wants
[1:05:40] us to to disbelieve our weapon and he
[1:05:44] also wants us to know it's okay to have
[1:05:47] the Word of God so Kate out the weapon
[1:05:50] and as long as we never use it as long
[1:05:53] as we never pull the sword and and it
[1:05:56] just says a piece of decoration and in
[1:05:58] the sheath that is just a badge of honor
[1:06:02] I've got the Word of God I I have the I
[1:06:05] have the Bible have the truth but again
[1:06:09] it is a weapon and man it is to be a
[1:06:12] sword and the word is a weapon but faith
[1:06:16] is the trigger
[1:06:19] Batman without Phase II you cannot
[1:06:21] please God without faith you cannot
[1:06:24] subdue kingdoms
[1:06:25] you cannot wrought righteousness you
[1:06:28] cannot obtain promises you cannot stop
[1:06:31] the mouths of Satan that ruin line that
[1:06:33] goes about seeing who he may devour you
[1:06:37] know you cannot quench the violence of
[1:06:39] the fire you cannot turn to flight the
[1:06:41] armies of the aliens you cannot quit the
[1:06:45] fiery darts of the wicked without faith
[1:06:47] you are powerless you are weak and you
[1:06:50] and the Word of God is ineffective but
[1:06:56] with faith all things are possible with
[1:06:58] faith we can subdue kingdoms wrought
[1:07:01] righteousness obtained promises stopped
[1:07:04] the mouths of Satan and then quits the
[1:07:07] violence of the fire turned to flight
[1:07:08] the armies that the aliens quits all the
[1:07:10] fiery darts of the wicked we can speak
[1:07:13] to any mountain we can cast out Devils
[1:07:17] we can tread on serpents and scorpions
[1:07:19] without being harmed we can heal the
[1:07:22] sick we can save the lost and we can
[1:07:25] overcome all things in this land is much
[1:07:32] different from the land of Egypt hey man
[1:07:35] it's so much different from the land of
[1:07:37] bondage what we were once slaves to sin
[1:07:39] and slaves the Satan in this land we're
[1:07:43] not slaves
[1:07:45] a member in this Lander a man who we are
[1:07:48] a new creation in this land I am
[1:07:52] redeemed from the curse of the law
[1:07:56] hallelujah
[1:07:57] a man I'd like you to look with me in
[1:07:59] Galatians three and thirteen for Christ
[1:08:01] has redeemed us from the curse of the
[1:08:04] law I want you to notice here God has
[1:08:07] redeemed you from the curse God has
[1:08:12] redeemed you from the curse of the law
[1:08:15] being made a curse for us for it is
[1:08:20] written cursed is every one that hangeth
[1:08:22] on the tree so Jesus would take our
[1:08:24] curse that the blessing of Abraham or
[1:08:29] what's these words now they're very key
[1:08:31] the blessing of Abraham might come on
[1:08:33] the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that
[1:08:36] we might receive the promise of the
[1:08:39] Spirit through faith
[1:08:40] now the blessing of Abraham was there
[1:08:43] was to be a seed remember and blessing I
[1:08:47] will bless you I'm gonna give you a
[1:08:49] child but it was more than Isaac and it
[1:08:52] was certainly more than Ishmael but it
[1:08:54] was a seed and it would be a royal seed
[1:08:57] and this seed which would be Christ the
[1:09:00] Messiah and it would be this seed that
[1:09:02] all nations would be blessed are you
[1:09:05] with me now so the blessing of Abraham
[1:09:07] was that would come a seed a messiah
[1:09:11] that through whom the blessings would
[1:09:13] come and that blessing of course is the
[1:09:17] gift of the Holy Spirit and then the
[1:09:20] spirit of Jesus that would give you the
[1:09:22] power to live above sin and unbelief you
[1:09:27] see now the law itself was not a curse
[1:09:29] the curse is the penalty levied for not
[1:09:33] keeping the law and all of us were
[1:09:35] guilty all of us a man and you remember
[1:09:41] brother Timothy's Wednesday night sermon
[1:09:43] how many enjoyed that and God bless him
[1:09:47] where he's serving the Lord today over
[1:09:49] in North Carolina preaching you'll be
[1:09:51] back tomorrow pray for him but
[1:09:53] remember brother Tim of these wonderful
[1:09:55] sermon them being blessed a man but I
[1:10:01] want to show you here's what happened if
[1:10:04] you didn't keep the law and here's our
[1:10:08] condition because James 2 in 10 says
[1:10:11] this for whosoever shall keep the whole
[1:10:14] law and yet offend in one point he's
[1:10:18] guilty of all of it because no man of
[1:10:25] his own self can live holy it takes the
[1:10:29] power of the Holy Ghost but let's just
[1:10:33] look at a moment and I didn't want to
[1:10:36] get on his subject material so I asked
[1:10:38] his permission to bring this this
[1:10:40] morning a man but Deuteronomy 28 verse
[1:10:43] 15 let's just look back at some of the
[1:10:47] things that in this chapter because he
[1:10:51] would be blessed but if you would offend
[1:10:55] the law if you would break the law if
[1:10:57] you didn't keep the law
[1:10:59] then you would come under a curse is
[1:11:04] that right and so verse 15 brings it
[1:11:07] down and says it shall come to pass if
[1:11:09] you will not hearken to the voice of the
[1:11:11] Lord God to observe all his Commandments
[1:11:15] and his taxes which I command thee this
[1:11:18] day that all these curses shall come
[1:11:22] upon thee and overtake thee well
[1:11:25] actually we were all born in this
[1:11:27] condition disobedient to God so breakers
[1:11:32] of the law and because of that the
[1:11:34] curses of the law came upon us somebody
[1:11:37] wake up your neighbor and tell him where
[1:11:39] you jerks all right so now notice in
[1:11:42] verse 16 it's that cursed shall beat not
[1:11:45] be in the city and curse it's how about
[1:11:47] be in the field and curse it remember
[1:11:51] all these were blessings
[1:11:53] but now Kerstin shall be that basket and
[1:11:56] I store and curse should be thy that
[1:11:59] fruit of that would body and the fruit
[1:12:01] of thy land and the increase of thy kind
[1:12:03] and the flux of thy seat and curses
[1:12:07] shall be thou shalt be will now come and
[1:12:09] stand and curtsied shall be when thou
[1:12:11] goest out and the Lord shall send upon
[1:12:13] thee cursings and vegetations and rebuke
[1:12:16] and all that thou settest the hands and
[1:12:19] said what to do until they'll be
[1:12:21] destroyed and until thou perish quickly
[1:12:24] because of the wickedness of that doing
[1:12:27] were by thou has forsaken me and this is
[1:12:31] the case of every sinner today there
[1:12:35] under the judgments of God and Satan has
[1:12:38] a right to implement every one of these
[1:12:41] and the Lord shall make the postulants
[1:12:44] cleave unto thee until he has consumed
[1:12:46] me from off the land
[1:12:47] whether thou go to possess the Lord will
[1:12:50] smite thee with consumption that's
[1:12:53] tuberculosis and with a fever and with
[1:12:56] inflammation and with extreme burning
[1:12:59] that's neuropathy and with the sword and
[1:13:03] with blasting and with mildew and they
[1:13:06] shall pursue thee until thou perish
[1:13:12] shall be brass and the earth that is
[1:13:15] under thee shall be iron and the Lord
[1:13:18] shall make the rain of the island powder
[1:13:21] and dust for heaven shall come down upon
[1:13:25] thee from heaven it shall come down upon
[1:13:27] thee until thou be destroyed and the
[1:13:29] Lord shall cause thee to be smitten
[1:13:32] before thine enemies thou shalt go out
[1:13:35] one way against them and flee seven ways
[1:13:37] before them and thou shall be removed
[1:13:39] into all the kingdoms of the earth this
[1:13:45] is a life you live before you are cursed
[1:13:52] but now this is what you have been
[1:13:56] redeemed from therefore the blessings of
[1:14:00] Abraham are yours and in fact of the
[1:14:05] matter is when you couldn't when you
[1:14:07] couldn't meet the requirements of the
[1:14:09] law with his perfections Jesus the
[1:14:12] perfect one came and paid the price for
[1:14:15] you met the requirements of the penalty
[1:14:18] of the law so that you don't have to
[1:14:22] meet them that's the good news this
[1:14:26] morning that way you can be blessed
[1:14:28] because of him
[1:14:30] a man this is your salvation a man the
[1:14:37] life you live before but now you have
[1:14:40] been redeemed therefore your Redemption
[1:14:45] you have the redemption that is promised
[1:14:48] now instead of sickness and dreaded
[1:14:52] diseases health and instead of running
[1:14:56] from your enemies they're gonna run from
[1:14:58] you seven ways and all these blessings
[1:15:01] shall come on thee and overtake thee a
[1:15:05] [Applause]
[1:15:07] man I just love it church the blessings
[1:15:10] are going to come upon you and overtake
[1:15:12] him
[1:15:14] they're gonna come running after you and
[1:15:18] catch up with ya wherever you are so
[1:15:22] that you can receive the benefits of
[1:15:24] your salvation hallelujah and verse 4
[1:15:29] says that infant brother Timothy shared
[1:15:31] this but I'm just touching this briefly
[1:15:33] he's talked about you will prosper and
[1:15:36] so blessed shall be the fruit of your
[1:15:38] body the fruit of that ground the fruit
[1:15:42] of that cattle the increase of that kind
[1:15:44] and the flux of thy sheep and blessed
[1:15:47] shall be the basket and iced-over verse
[1:15:49] 7 the Lord shall caused an enemy's to
[1:15:52] rise against thee that rise against thee
[1:15:55] to be smitten before that face they
[1:15:57] shall come against me one way and flee
[1:16:00] before these seven ways the Lord shall
[1:16:02] establish you as a holy people unto
[1:16:05] himself as he is sworn unto thee and all
[1:16:09] the people of the earth shall see thee
[1:16:11] that thou are called by the name of the
[1:16:14] Lord and they should be afraid of thee
[1:16:16] and the Lord shall make thee Plymouth's
[1:16:19] and goods in the fruit of that body in
[1:16:21] the fruit of that cattle in the fruit of
[1:16:23] the ground in the fruit of the land in
[1:16:25] the land which the Lord swear unto God
[1:16:29] father's to give thee and the Lord shall
[1:16:31] open up to be his good treasures the
[1:16:35] heaven to give the rain unto the land in
[1:16:38] his season and that bless all the works
[1:16:40] of the hand and the set lens of many
[1:16:43] nations and the soundbar oh and the Lord
[1:16:46] shall make thee the head and not the
[1:16:49] tail and thou shalt be above only and
[1:16:52] thou shalt not be beneath if thou shalt
[1:16:55] hearken unto the commandments of the
[1:16:57] LORD thy God which I commanded thee this
[1:17:00] day to observe them to do them and
[1:17:02] furthermore he says and I will put none
[1:17:06] of these diseases upon thee which I have
[1:17:10] brought from among the Egyptians for I
[1:17:13] am the lord that healeth thee
[1:17:18] that's its promise to you I'm not gonna
[1:17:20] put a disease on you so if it comes is
[1:17:24] from the devil and if it's from the
[1:17:27] devil we have a right to cast it out
[1:17:31] a man now the tactic of the devil is to
[1:17:35] get you to disbelieve your weapon God's
[1:17:38] Word but the moment you disbelieve your
[1:17:41] weapon you're disarmed because only that
[1:17:45] hand of faith can hold the sword of the
[1:17:48] word now so again we're to take the word
[1:17:52] and to phim because he said in my name
[1:17:54] they shall cast out devils now Jesus
[1:17:58] prove this to us on the on the mountain
[1:18:01] of temptation that the devil can that
[1:18:03] defeated even the garden can be
[1:18:05] conquered by the word hey man here he
[1:18:09] got the devil defeated Eve by adding to
[1:18:13] the word and discredit in the word and
[1:18:15] causing her to disbelieve the word man
[1:18:18] Jesus meets the devil in the garden of -
[1:18:20] and not in the Garden of Eden but in -
[1:18:23] in the place of temptation hey man were
[1:18:27] all the powers of hell came against him
[1:18:29] I'm convinced it wasn't a demon that
[1:18:32] came and attacked Jesus it was Lucifer
[1:18:34] himself and was questioning if thou be
[1:18:38] the Son of God by the way if he will
[1:18:41] question Jesus if he's the son of God
[1:18:43] what about you don't you think he'll
[1:18:45] question you don't you think he'll try
[1:18:49] to put down upon your experience now
[1:18:53] some but Jesus proved that the Word of
[1:18:57] God will defeat the devil he and to do
[1:19:01] this farce he didn't use his powers he
[1:19:04] didn't use his gifts he didn't use some
[1:19:08] supernatural ability that you don't have
[1:19:12] he used the word
[1:19:14] and he simply took what was written and
[1:19:17] applied it to the situation he beat the
[1:19:21] devil with him on every point the devil
[1:19:23] came against him
[1:19:26] hallelujah you know why this is because
[1:19:30] God intends you to have dominion he does
[1:19:36] not intend you to be a defeated person
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:42] faith is not defeat faith is a victory
[1:19:47] now in the beginning Adam ruled having
[1:19:52] dominion over the earth the Bible would
[1:19:56] say in in Genesis 1:26 God said let us
[1:20:00] make man in His image after our likeness
[1:20:01] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:20:03] the sea over the fowl of the air over
[1:20:06] the cattle over all the earth and over
[1:20:09] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[1:20:11] the earth
[1:20:12] so Adam ruled the earth but he ruled the
[1:20:17] earth by faith you see he he could
[1:20:22] rearrange the mountains he's held
[1:20:26] brother Tim honey we know he could do
[1:20:27] that I'll tell you how we know he could
[1:20:29] do it because God gave him dominion and
[1:20:32] then jesus said if you believe you can
[1:20:35] say to this mountain is that right
[1:20:39] Amen so we know then that Jesus was
[1:20:42] pulling from somewhere because this was
[1:20:45] a man in his original position to be to
[1:20:50] be the inheritor of the earth to own the
[1:20:53] title deed to it to be in possession of
[1:20:56] all things have everything underneath
[1:21:00] his feet now remember some bad faith he
[1:21:04] he could control and rearrange the
[1:21:08] mountains could rearrange the rivers the
[1:21:11] trees they could say to them be plucked
[1:21:14] up here and moved up
[1:21:16] and on the disk on privet to you the
[1:21:19] Bible tells you after the curse came he
[1:21:21] had to do this by the sweat of the brow
[1:21:23] so you know he wasn't sweating doing
[1:21:26] what we do we wanted to removed it takes
[1:21:28] a lot of sweat to do it
[1:21:29] we either dig it up or slow it down or
[1:21:32] do something to move it right and that
[1:21:35] takes a lot of sweat but Adam didn't
[1:21:37] need any sweat he had faith in what God
[1:21:42] made him and he had dominion and he
[1:21:45] spoke and he expected it to be done are
[1:21:50] you with me so he could rearrange the
[1:21:53] mountains the rivers he can move the
[1:21:55] trees by the law of faith and jesus said
[1:21:59] himself if you have faith as a grain of
[1:22:02] mustard seed you can say to this sack of
[1:22:05] mine tree be that plucked up and cast
[1:22:07] into the sea and it'll be done even as
[1:22:10] you said is that the Bible a man
[1:22:13] now of course Satan was there oh yeah he
[1:22:17] was treading upon the earth watching
[1:22:20] looking for a way in and seeing how he
[1:22:23] he could come and and bring deception
[1:22:26] and deceive and he's over there but he
[1:22:29] had no power to do anything about it he
[1:22:33] couldn't stop at him when he said move
[1:22:35] this tree he couldn't stop at him when
[1:22:37] he he you know there was nothing he
[1:22:39] could do and man he could he all he can
[1:22:42] do is just pace around and then look and
[1:22:46] watch him oh my isn't isn't that
[1:22:50] marvelous hey man look at the power that
[1:22:53] he has here he is he's controlling the
[1:22:56] atmosphere he says it's a little windy
[1:23:00] today Adam peace be still how do we know
[1:23:03] that second Adam did that
[1:23:06] is that right looked over the brow of
[1:23:08] the boat and the bow of the boat and
[1:23:11] looked out and saw the winds and the
[1:23:13] waves and the Baffler swamped the boat
[1:23:15] and said peace be still didn't matter
[1:23:18] how big the wind was hey man he went but
[1:23:22] he was controlling my faith I want you
[1:23:25] to understand everything is by faith by
[1:23:28] faith and a lot of times when faith
[1:23:32] becomes very mysterious to people as to
[1:23:34] what faith is faith is simply believing
[1:23:36] that God's Word is true and he'll do
[1:23:39] what he said he would do
[1:23:40] that's all faith is it just simply
[1:23:43] believing God's Word it's true and God's
[1:23:46] going to perform what he said that he
[1:23:48] cannot lie hey man that's faith now so
[1:23:53] you see Satan was as I said but his
[1:23:57] power was limited he couldn't work there
[1:24:01] was nothing he could do until something
[1:24:04] was broken and so he can do is just
[1:24:08] watch him controlled the atmosphere the
[1:24:11] animals he didn't have to raise his
[1:24:13] voice hey man he doesn't he doesn't not
[1:24:18] to shout or scream at everything
[1:24:20] all he has to do is say it speak and it
[1:24:24] happened
[1:24:25] hey man and so Adam could say tree
[1:24:30] here's my view of that mountain move
[1:24:33] over a little bit about about ten feet
[1:24:36] you see you know he he is operating as
[1:24:42] the god of the earth that I read the
[1:24:45] scripture that he gave his Dominion
[1:24:48] Genesis 1:26 he said let him have
[1:24:51] dominion over the fish of the sea the
[1:24:52] found the air the cattle over every all
[1:24:55] the Earth's and every creeping thing
[1:24:56] that creepeth on the earth and so he had
[1:24:59] Dominion that was given to him by God so
[1:25:04] he had the word that placed him in that
[1:25:05] position and then he had faith in that
[1:25:09] word to operate that position
[1:25:12] are you with me now so now as he did you
[1:25:17] know as I said as long as faith was in
[1:25:21] effect as long as Adam walked by faith
[1:25:24] and live by faith Satan's power was
[1:25:27] broken now this is why Satan tries to
[1:25:33] get every Son of God to doubt this is
[1:25:36] why Jesus that he did the first thing
[1:25:38] after Jesus received the Holy Ghost
[1:25:40] forgave him to doubt his experience and
[1:25:44] Jesus had an experience so does every
[1:25:47] other child of God when you get the Holy
[1:25:48] Ghost it's not an imagination it's not a
[1:25:51] profession of faith it is an experience
[1:25:54] where heaven comes down and cleanses the
[1:25:57] soul and purchase you a man is an
[1:26:00] individual and comes to indwell are you
[1:26:03] with me but this is what Satan tried to
[1:26:06] get him to doubt you see but it was
[1:26:09] given the Adam that I'll be turn alive
[1:26:11] and as long as he ate from that tree of
[1:26:14] life he had eternal life Adam ruled over
[1:26:19] the earth
[1:26:20] he was like an amateur God over the
[1:26:23] earth everything was just given in his
[1:26:26] hand because hereit's was his he could
[1:26:29] do with it whatever he wanted to do and
[1:26:31] he named it there wasn't an animal that
[1:26:36] he didn't name he called him to himself
[1:26:39] and he named him one by one and whatever
[1:26:41] he named it that was the name thereof
[1:26:43] hey man he was truly a son of God but
[1:26:48] now in the foul Adam forfeits the title
[1:26:51] deed to that to the whole earth even to
[1:26:55] our own bodies which is earth and Adam
[1:27:00] was of course unable to redeem you see
[1:27:05] he could not redeem his rights he didn't
[1:27:10] redeem his rights because he couldn't
[1:27:11] read him his rights but Satan which does
[1:27:15] not rightfully on it I want you to get
[1:27:17] it because he got it by the seat

[1:27:52] nation belongs to him he governs and
[1:27:55] controls a whole world and everything in
[1:27:57] the world that's Satan but that's not
[1:28:01] his original place that was our place
[1:28:06] Adam ruled in that position and Adam did
[1:28:10] it with no mind battles he would say to
[1:28:15] this mountain and there was nothing
[1:28:17] there that said you know you you know
[1:28:19] hey you're just a man now you know you

[1:28:31] wind and the trees and he didn't have a
[1:28:35] headache or didn't take in his body no
[1:28:38] it contains while he was speaking to her
[1:28:40] that was something that was reminding
[1:28:43] him of his humanity or his mortality he
[1:28:48] didn't have a sign of age he didn't have
[1:28:51] any sickness somebody help me preach now
[1:28:55] Adam here he's over here speaking and
[1:28:58] all of this he don't have any sickness
[1:29:00] in his body he's never been sick he
[1:29:02] don't know what it means to be sick he
[1:29:04] doesn't have a negative thought to
[1:29:05] overcome he's never had to overcome
[1:29:07] anything he is operating in a perfect
[1:29:13] round in a plan a perfect world in a
[1:29:17] perfect Eden
[1:29:19] are you with me he moves it moves
[1:29:21] Mountain and us in his feets not hurting
[1:29:25] his back isn't aching he don't give a
[1:29:29] headache from working too long in the
[1:29:31] Sun you know he speaking and rearranging
[1:29:36] the earth and he has no scars of his
[1:29:38] past what a what his friends why or why
[1:29:43] he is commanding or while he is
[1:29:46] operating or is somebody with me
[1:29:48] there's nothing whispering him about his
[1:29:50] past and why you should not receive this
[1:29:54] because of your past hey man there's no
[1:30:00] reminders of any sin that he ever did
[1:30:04] he's standing in and the perfect Eden he
[1:30:07] doesn't know fear he's not afraid it's
[1:30:10] not gonna happen he's not wondering am I
[1:30:14] talking as a madness timer is a god at
[1:30:17] this time a man is never afraid of
[1:30:23] anything
[1:30:23] he had no doubts to overcome he didn't
[1:30:26] have an evil thought to cast down he did
[1:30:32] this whole thing without a battle can
[1:30:37] you imagine that I mean he said to the
[1:30:40] mouths of him and he didn't have a
[1:30:41] battle wasn't a war in his mind it was a
[1:30:45] sign in his body
[1:30:47] there was an ache in his back there was
[1:30:50] nothing that reminded him of mortality
[1:30:55] hey man he prophesied that's what he was
[1:30:59] doing
[1:31:00] somebody help me preach now he
[1:31:02] prophesied he foretold what was going to
[1:31:05] happen he can I say it again he
[1:31:11] prophesied I want to get it he operated
[1:31:13] as a son of God so he foretold what was
[1:31:17] going to take place he said let this
[1:31:19] mountain be moved
[1:31:20] moved over there and it happened he
[1:31:22] prophesied that in happening but he did
[1:31:28] it without a mind battle without scars
[1:31:31] of his past without memories affection
[1:31:35] reasoning without science come along and
[1:31:38] say this is impossible for you to do
[1:31:40] this or religion to come along and say
[1:31:45] God doesn't heal our days of miracles
[1:31:49] our past God doesn't do those things
[1:31:53] anymore
[1:31:54] or that was only for the apostles of war
[1:32:00] there's no reminded him some other
[1:32:04] person you know comes along as though
[1:32:06] not on a wait a man don't try to take
[1:32:08] the prophets place be careful here dog
[1:32:12] don't move out of your position he knew
[1:32:14] what his position was he operated in
[1:32:17] that position to overcome no fear no
[1:32:23] doubt no not sit over comment we got
[1:32:26] this I'm a very prophesied and study you
[1:32:30] said he spoke the son of God yeah now
[1:32:36] brother branham told us in the
[1:32:39] fundamental foundation for faith and by
[1:32:41] the way it's a very difficult tape to
[1:32:44] listen to because the audio is very poor
[1:32:46] but it was one of my favorite sermons
[1:32:49] but he said man was made as a secondary
[1:32:53] god on the earth he was given the power
[1:32:56] to control all things all elements of
[1:32:59] the earth that was Adam Adam was given
[1:33:01] these great powers but then the power
[1:33:04] that he was given to make himself as
[1:33:06] where he failed Adam could speak to the
[1:33:09] winds and it would stop he could speak
[1:33:11] to the trees and they would obey him he
[1:33:14] could speak to light wildlife and it
[1:33:16] would obey him he can speak to the
[1:33:18] waters and for what it was everything
[1:33:21] obeyed Adam Adam never had to be sick he
[1:33:24] never had to die he never had a worry
[1:33:27] he'd never had
[1:33:29] he never had a fear he just climbed
[1:33:31] right up in the arms of the father just
[1:33:34] like a child and everything was his and
[1:33:37] whatever he asked why he just got it and
[1:33:40] everything obeyed him because he was
[1:33:43] God's child and the child is heir of all
[1:33:45] things
[1:33:46] that's how Adam operated but we know
[1:33:50] what happened God allowed the fall now
[1:33:54] he didn't make the fall but he made man
[1:33:57] where he could fall that he could make a
[1:33:59] choice this is because he was made in
[1:34:01] the image of God and in God's image you
[1:34:04] see if you would have been made like
[1:34:07] some of the Angels just say holy holy
[1:34:09] holy and that's all their job is is holy
[1:34:12] holy holy those angels perhaps never
[1:34:14] have a choice but you have a choice
[1:34:17] because you are made in the image of God
[1:34:19] and God didn't wants it now listen God
[1:34:23] didn't want some robot to serve Him
[1:34:25] holy holy holy holy God wanted men and
[1:34:29] women that would choose to worship Him
[1:34:34] their heart to say I love you Jesus hey
[1:34:41] mom I've said it before but to use their
[1:34:44] knowledge II again use the illustration
[1:34:46] you know it's kind of like if a boy had
[1:34:49] power over a girl you know that if you
[1:34:51] just had the power to Zephyr you know
[1:34:56] she don't like me so you don't love me
[1:34:58] but if I can just zap her I can make her
[1:35:05] let me and all of a sudden you zap that
[1:35:08] little girl and see going around I love
[1:35:12] you I love you I love you
[1:35:24] who wants a robot come on church
[1:35:32] who wants a robot who wants somebody did
[1:35:35] this is a mindless idiot following you
[1:35:38] around town saying what you wanted to
[1:35:40] say it would mean nothing
[1:35:44] it would have absolutely no meaning to
[1:35:48] you because you know it's the uniform
[1:35:52] power over to zapper and so she loves
[1:35:54] you and business mindlessly go along
[1:35:57] like an idiot or a robot said I love you
[1:35:59] I love me I love you I love you and you
[1:36:01] know if you ever let her loose
[1:36:04] she wouldn't love you she'd be right
[1:36:09] back in the same old condition are you
[1:36:12] with me my god didn't want you the robot
[1:36:17] he didn't want you going around saying I
[1:36:20] love you Jesus I love you Jesus I love
[1:36:22] you Jesus like a mindless idiot
[1:36:25] God wanted you to love him with all your
[1:36:27] heart with all your soul with all your
[1:36:30] being now then
[1:36:32] hey boy if you want to hurt to love you
[1:36:34] then you got a woo her hey man you got a
[1:36:40] woo her and this is what God did when
[1:36:44] you chose the wrong thing a life of sin
[1:36:51] and you kept choosing it god no no
[1:36:55] hallelujah path what he begin to woo you
[1:36:59] is what I'll do everything that I can I
[1:37:03] so love you
[1:37:05] [Music]
[1:37:05] [Applause]
[1:37:14] Oh for you I'll give my life for you
[1:37:18] take your purses I think your sin
[1:37:21] figure I'll take your future I put it
[1:37:25] all on me but your love
[1:37:34] hallelujah this is why that he said with
[1:37:38] Moses after he give them all those laws
[1:37:40] that sound and that sound not in that
[1:37:43] south-south nod and South and that's not
[1:37:46] not and after we gave all those laws
[1:37:48] because they want to know what can we do
[1:37:52] what is that we can do and then God said
[1:37:57] but what I want is not all your laws and
[1:38:03] you have to do this and you have to do
[1:38:05] that and have to do that I want you to
[1:38:07] love me all that a man would love me
[1:38:12] with all in hearts and with all his soul
[1:38:16] with everything that's within me so God
[1:38:20] allowed a fall
[1:38:23] now of course God knew the fall would
[1:38:27] take place before it happened he knew
[1:38:29] the moment that he created man and put
[1:38:32] him on this basis of choice that he
[1:38:36] would choose wrong he knew the deception
[1:38:41] would come but he didn't want that he
[1:38:45] didn't make that happen but before it
[1:38:48] ever happened before the sin ever took
[1:38:50] place he said I know they're going to do
[1:38:52] it so I'll be the savior I know they're
[1:38:58] gonna be sick so I'll be the healer I
[1:39:01] know they're gonna be in bondage so I'll
[1:39:04] be the deliverer so you see you know God
[1:39:09] allows men to fall and this beautiful
[1:39:11] picture that we have of a perfect eating
[1:39:14] no evil no thought no mortality no sin
[1:39:17] no death no sorrow it all gives way to a
[1:39:21] very marred picture and a broken life as
[1:39:28] Adam and Eve starts walking out crying
[1:39:30] hugging each other walking out of the
[1:39:34] garden why did we do this here's a
[1:39:39] bloody sheep skin flapping on their legs
[1:39:42] covering their nakedness
[1:39:46] God walk in the other direction with his
[1:39:48] back turned to hold man because of sin
[1:39:51] but God's love was so great that as he
[1:39:57] was walking away here and then commanded
[1:39:59] them to leave my leave this face of
[1:40:03] sonship leave this rice where you rule
[1:40:07] the supreme I can't let you rule there
[1:40:10] in your sin man get out of my garden go
[1:40:15] out the way and turns his back old man
[1:40:18] and begins to walk away but it all fell
[1:40:20] down to one thing
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:29] [Applause]
[1:40:36] [Applause]
[1:40:40] become a seed seed of the woman and I
[1:40:45] tell you what we gonna do
[1:40:53] Oh
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:41:07] you will tread on that
[1:41:18] you going
[1:41:28] I will be the seed of the woman that
[1:41:31] will come to redeem man from this
[1:41:36] decrepit condition
[1:41:42] hallelujah Nordic God feel like I could
[1:41:47] make a few laps around his building and
[1:41:49] speak in other tongues but you know
[1:41:56] through the fall man that lost
[1:41:59] conscience of the fact after loosing his
[1:42:03] relationship and friendship and
[1:42:05] fellowship with the father he lost that
[1:42:07] in his great all his great channels
[1:42:10] became clogged up and that fellowship
[1:42:14] between God and man was broken now
[1:42:19] what God what Adam was in God Christ has
[1:42:22] redeemed us back to that hey man I want
[1:42:26] to give you the good news we're on our
[1:42:27] road back hey man it starts with the
[1:42:31] soul it'll end with the body being
[1:42:34] redeemed fully redeemed now so you see a
[1:42:39] redeemer is to redeem on to redeem
[1:42:42] anything is to bring it back to its
[1:42:45] origin again and Adam the lost the very
[1:42:49] consciousness in other words he had
[1:42:54] lived in a perfect world before the fall
[1:42:56] but after the fall he lost consciousness
[1:42:58] awareness
[1:43:00] it was now hard for him they even
[1:43:02] believed he was there he had had amnesia
[1:43:11] he forgot he felt so far that he lost
[1:43:17] Dominion by giving up faith for Satan's
[1:43:20] wisdom and now he becomes himself a
[1:43:23] slave to sin and unbelief and that
[1:43:26] controls him
[1:43:28] the title deed to the earth and eternal
[1:43:31] life when Adam for
[1:43:34] you know satan's dirty hands couldn't
[1:43:37] take it
[1:43:37] God wasn't going to give it to him I
[1:43:41] might even though even though right now
[1:43:44] because of man's subjecting himself to
[1:43:47] Satan that Satan becomes the Prince of
[1:43:49] the power of the air
[1:43:50] that's not his position it doesn't
[1:43:54] belong to him now so the abstract title
[1:43:59] deeds eternal life goes back in the hand
[1:44:01] of the one who gave it which was
[1:44:03] Almighty God and it was waiting for
[1:44:06] redemption claims that brings it right
[1:44:12] down to our day do you believe that hey
[1:44:15] man you see what is it doing it's in the
[1:44:18] hands of God waiting for redemption
[1:44:19] claims he made a way Redemption he's
[1:44:23] made a way back and someday the Redeemer
[1:44:26] is to take it back now thinking that God
[1:44:32] became a man as he said I'll become the
[1:44:35] seed then we'll go with you hey man you
[1:44:41] remember that because this is where he
[1:44:43] said I'm gonna put enmity between thee
[1:44:45] and thy seed and the Serpent and his
[1:44:47] seed so we know the serpent had a seed
[1:44:52] the Bible said so remember I'm gonna put
[1:44:56] enmity between the two and this seed is
[1:44:59] going to be the seed that's going to
[1:45:01] come through a woman will bruise the
[1:45:04] head of the Serpent and in doing so
[1:45:07] you're the see because in doing so your
[1:45:12] heel or the seeds heel will be bruised
[1:45:15] in other words where he touches the
[1:45:17] earth in his humanity will be bruised
[1:45:23] for the sake of redemption amen
[1:45:27] so again in his in his treading on the
[1:45:31] serpent over sin he would be bruised he
[1:45:36] would be wounded for our transgression
[1:45:38] he would be bruised for our iniquity I
[1:45:41] mean the weapons we should have gone but
[1:45:43] come on him so that by his stripes we
[1:45:47] could be healed now think of it God
[1:45:52] becomes a man and and so yeah and and he
[1:45:58] continues you know at Calvary he begins
[1:46:02] his work of redemption by paying the
[1:46:04] price for man's sin I want to tell you
[1:46:08] the price is paid in full every one of
[1:46:13] you that have the Holy Ghost have a
[1:46:15] deposit of that what he did there
[1:46:19] all right now so again but where Christ
[1:46:23] is now claiming the book of title in
[1:46:26] order to give it back to man because man
[1:46:30] lost it man that God wants man to have
[1:46:33] it he wants you to have dominion and so
[1:46:36] he's given back to man poured out in the
[1:46:39] youth of faith can I say it this way the
[1:46:43] faith the consciousness of who you are
[1:46:46] in Christ now you know what you were as
[1:46:51] a sinner but what the devil want you to
[1:46:54] know is who you are in Christ and it's
[1:46:59] hard sometimes to fathom that you have
[1:47:02] that but God sent a prophet to wake up
[1:47:05] the consciousness and Here I am as a
[1:47:07] preacher standing here this morning
[1:47:10] saying you've got the power
[1:47:11] you are an overcomer and you are able
[1:47:16] hallelujah now when man became subject
[1:47:20] to sin and sorrow pain and death he
[1:47:23] became a puppet to everything the devil
[1:47:26] wanted him to do you all know that you
[1:47:30] everyone was his puppet so as I whatever
[1:47:33] string he pulled that's what you did
[1:47:36] that's right some of you still on that
[1:47:39] strength you need salvation hey man so
[1:47:44] you see he became a puppet now and only
[1:47:47] then when he became a puppet
[1:47:50] good was the spirit of cancer able to
[1:47:54] take a hold of him bring him to his
[1:47:56] crane only then could a demon feel his
[1:47:59] heart would plaque until it could
[1:48:01] beating why because unbelief gave Satan
[1:48:06] the power to prevail over man
[1:48:09] let's talk about unbelief for a man
[1:48:11] we're talking about faith we got to look
[1:48:14] at the being the counterpart or shall
[1:48:17] them to say the opposite side of the
[1:48:19] spectrum what the enemy has unbelief
[1:48:22] what comes to counter faith so
[1:48:26] unbeliever doubt can do a lot of things
[1:48:31] it can create an atmosphere in a meeting
[1:48:36] when everyone is staring with unbelief
[1:48:40] and whenever one body is looking and all
[1:48:43] them demons with her public power focus
[1:48:46] right on them and their unbelief
[1:48:47] unbelief is demon power I'm and so now
[1:48:52] if we think about that for a moment
[1:48:54] remember down at youth camp when we were
[1:48:56] dealing with some of them demon spirits
[1:48:58] someone we just had to pull out and in
[1:49:00] another room and man why because the
[1:49:03] enemy was congregating telling some of
[1:49:07] the young people I'll believe when they
[1:49:09] catch that Devil out I'll be a Christian
[1:49:12] if they can do it I'll tell you if they
[1:49:16] don't do it well I know this messaging
[1:49:18] to all these doubts oh did you see they
[1:49:23] they think they're big bunch of big
[1:49:25] shots that they got power to do they
[1:49:27] they're they can't do it oh poor soul
[1:49:31] he'll have to live with this demon all
[1:49:33] his life all of these stops now and the
[1:49:43] people are wondered do they have enough
[1:49:45] power are they able to conquer listen
[1:49:49] listen unbelief is the only thing that
[1:49:53] can keep you from the kingdom of God and
[1:49:56] the only thing that is saying the is
[1:49:58] unbelief I'm quoting from brother
[1:50:02] said he said brother branham nod
[1:50:03] quit drinking and I quit they're doing
[1:50:05] these things that my evil ways whoa well
[1:50:08] you did that for one purpose see the
[1:50:10] only thing that calls you to do that is
[1:50:11] because you become a believer then again
[1:50:15] he would say let me show you just on a
[1:50:17] word the first time that the never met
[1:50:19] Jesus Christ he doubted him that always
[1:50:22] is of the devil and that's where the for
[1:50:25] sin come there is no other sin but doubt
[1:50:28] unbelief is the original and only sin
[1:50:31] committing adultery is not a sin
[1:50:34] smokings not us and getting drunk
[1:50:36] another sin that is the attributes of
[1:50:38] unbelief Alleluia hey man now again we
[1:50:46] know those are attributes because you're
[1:50:48] an unbeliever you do those things now in
[1:50:51] the voice have gone in the last days let
[1:50:54] me share another sin is righteousness
[1:50:56] perverted a lie is a truth
[1:50:59] misrepresented adultery is an act that
[1:51:02] God ordained us to perverted all
[1:51:06] unbelief is a perversion of unbelief you
[1:51:10] have to deny the truth in order to take
[1:51:12] the perversion see straighten out these
[1:51:15] voices test them by the word see if it's
[1:51:17] the truth but look with me but in the
[1:51:19] phase we got today the best doctors we
[1:51:21] ever had and I want to say I thank God
[1:51:24] for the Advancement of science hey man I
[1:51:29] came to church today because of the
[1:51:31] advancement of science I rode in a car I
[1:51:34] thank God for what do they do in
[1:51:36] hospitals and doctors and whatever else
[1:51:39] the good that has done but it's off the
[1:51:42] tree of knowledge of good and evil but
[1:51:45] now we said we got the best hospitals we
[1:51:47] ever had we got the best drugs we ever
[1:51:50] practice with heavenly we got more
[1:51:53] sickness than we ever had haven't we
[1:51:55] because we got more on belief than we
[1:51:58] ever had
[1:51:59] haven't we and that's right you're
[1:52:02] exactly only God's the healer and we
[1:52:05] know that so faith is a channel those
[1:52:08] were in God works unbelief is the
[1:52:12] channel wherein Satan works so unbelief
[1:52:17] is the worst sin there he is and it's
[1:52:19] the only sinner he is and all the other
[1:52:21] sins are just an attribute said that
[1:52:23] unbelief now here's what the Bible said
[1:52:27] first John three and eight
[1:52:28] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[1:52:32] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[1:52:35] he was the first doubter of God's Word
[1:52:37] he did it in heaven sin began in heaven
[1:52:40] not on earth when Lucifer exalted his
[1:52:43] own thoughts and wisdom above the Word
[1:52:45] of God and made angels doubted somebody
[1:52:48] with me and man say he that committeth
[1:52:50] sin is of the devil for the devil
[1:52:52] sinneth from the beginning but for this
[1:52:54] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[1:52:57] here's the reason the son of God was
[1:52:59] revealed here's why the seed promised to
[1:53:03] the woman was given and revealed are you
[1:53:06] in me that he might somebody help me
[1:53:09] preach it destroy the works of the devil
[1:53:15] hallelujah hey man so this is what he
[1:53:18] came to do destroy the works of the
[1:53:20] devil in your lives in my life and
[1:53:25] redemption came up with me fully had
[1:53:27] until all the works of the devil
[1:53:30] have been totally destroyed and you're
[1:53:34] not redeemed until that demon that you
[1:53:37] were born with is dead in your life that
[1:53:41] old man of sin that sin nature hey man
[1:53:48] that's why as I said it's not hard to be
[1:53:50] born again it's hard for people that die
[1:53:53] the sin nature to that first nature they
[1:53:56] were born with now so they see the heart
[1:54:00] has to be cleansed before God can come
[1:54:03] down in the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:05] which is Christ coming down and dwell in
[1:54:07] the human heart it must be for us to be
[1:54:09] repented it must be baptized in water in
[1:54:12] his name to show who it belongs to
[1:54:14] that's what we baptize in the name of
[1:54:16] Jesus Christ because we're identifying
[1:54:19] with him who we belong to taking on his
[1:54:23] name
[1:54:23] I meant that it must be cleansed by the
[1:54:25] blood of Jesus and then the holy fire
[1:54:28] and Holy Ghost from God comes down and
[1:54:30] burns out the desire of sin and I know
[1:54:34] cuz it happened to me a man that where
[1:54:38] you come down you you hate what God
[1:54:40] hates and then you love what God loves
[1:54:44] a man so notice and therefore he that
[1:54:47] sins willfully after receiving the
[1:54:49] knowledge of truth the Bible said if he
[1:54:51] knows the truth and he says willfully he
[1:54:54] needs to sacrifice cuz they don't have a
[1:54:57] sacrifice if you have the true sacrifice
[1:54:59] there's no sin can be attributed to you
[1:55:05] so there's no way for him to sin he
[1:55:08] that's born of God cannot sin he does
[1:55:10] not sin
[1:55:10] there's no way for him to sin how can be
[1:55:12] a sinner to redeemed that there's a damn
[1:55:14] how could I be an upon seven I the
[1:55:16] pancha at the same time
[1:55:18] oh he redeemed us by his blood by your
[1:55:21] spirit he cleanse us and then he comes
[1:55:23] to dwell in us the church not the
[1:55:26] denomination Downton's a church not the
[1:55:29] building we're sitting in the church the
[1:55:32] body of Jesus Christ now when you see
[1:55:36] that Baptists are the Holy Ghost here's
[1:55:39] what I want you to get we've been
[1:55:40] preaching about it you have the same God
[1:55:44] dwelling in you that created the heavens
[1:55:48] and the earth
[1:55:49] [Applause]
[1:55:51] hallelujah amen and with garden now
[1:55:57] listen
[1:55:57] let me go back with sin I believe comes
[1:56:00] its attributes with God comes those
[1:56:04] attributes with God comes Authority with
[1:56:10] God comes power with God's Dominion God
[1:56:21] God comes inside of you when the Spirit
[1:56:24] comes to dwell in you and it's
[1:56:30] impossible to have God and not have his
[1:56:34] attributes it is impossible to have God
[1:56:43] that Christ in you and not have his
[1:56:46] attributes a man not like brother
[1:56:50] Branham was often tell us he said you
[1:56:52] know if the spirit of both be Tobin came
[1:56:54] in me I'd write music if the spirit of
[1:56:57] Dillinger came in me I'd kill people but
[1:57:00] a spirit of Christ comes in me I'm gonna
[1:57:02] do what Christ did
[1:57:04] hey ma'am so it's impossible to have God
[1:57:07] and not have his attributes and so
[1:57:11] therefore I'm trying to tell you human
[1:57:14] power is already in you overcoming power
[1:57:20] already is in you the power of
[1:57:23] transformation is on the inside this
[1:57:29] morning works without faith none of it
[1:57:40] now brother Branham would say in the
[1:57:43] message faith if you're sick and not a
[1:57:45] Christian become a Christian right now
[1:57:47] so that healing power will come in you
[1:57:49] by becoming a Christian and that will
[1:57:52] give you faith to ride above sin it'll
[1:57:54] give you faith and everything you need
[1:57:57] up in this journey is right in you now
[1:57:58] and the only thing you have to do is
[1:58:01] have faith in God that pushes that good
[1:58:03] things out of you which is by which is
[1:58:06] in you by the Holy Spirit so you see
[1:58:09] again your own resurrection is hitting
[1:58:14] you right now Romans 8:11 but if the
[1:58:18] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:58:20] the dead dwell in you he that raised
[1:58:26] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:58:27] make alive your mortal body by his
[1:58:30] spirit that dwelleth in you so by the
[1:58:33] Holy Ghost in you resurrection power
[1:58:35] lays in you I'm out brother branham
[1:58:39] would say in this message faith he said
[1:58:41] now each one of you have the power the
[1:58:43] same way because your sons and daughters
[1:58:45] of God and their very spirit that's in
[1:58:47] you this morning the Holy Spirit that's
[1:58:50] in you this morning that same only
[1:58:52] spirit will raise you up so you have the
[1:58:54] power to raise yourself back up and
[1:58:59] Manny would tell us the rapture is in us
[1:59:03] now
[1:59:06] hallelujah by having the Holy Ghost the
[1:59:09] rapture is in me that's why I say freeze
[1:59:12] I'm not afraid of missing the rapture I
[1:59:15] am the rapture
[1:59:17] [Applause]
[1:59:18] I'm not afraid if you bury me in a
[1:59:21] graveyard
[1:59:22] I'm not afraid that I'm gonna lay there
[1:59:24] forever and ever ever because
[1:59:26] resurrection power lays within me
[1:59:30] quickening power is already these old
[1:59:33] bones those he just scald he justified
[1:59:45] those he justified he thought glorified
[1:59:47] that's the scripture for that then in
[1:59:49] heaven today we're glorified in the
[1:59:51] presence of God not right now I'm just
[1:59:54] pushing out to it amen glory God's in
[1:59:58] his word you believe it every present
[2:00:01] water from the rock he said the power
[2:00:02] that raised us up is in us right now and
[2:00:05] now we are now in heavenly places we are
[2:00:11] now in the power of the Resurrection if
[2:00:15] there wasn't a law to that oh now listen
[2:00:18] if there wasn't a law to that sons and
[2:00:21] daughters of God would create them the
[2:00:23] world out here and go live a private
[2:00:24] life on it you have the power in you to
[2:00:27] do it if you got a shadow of the power
[2:00:30] of God because it's not no weak spots in
[2:00:33] God or big heavy spots in God that are
[2:00:36] limited but but the least touch of God
[2:00:39] is omnipotent so you have the power in
[2:00:42] you to do it if you got a shadow of the
[2:00:44] power of God in you you got the power of
[2:00:46] God God is omnipotent so you what I mean
[2:00:48] the power that's in you with me you
[2:00:50] could speak a world into existence and
[2:00:52] go live on it hallelujah there you are
[2:00:54] that's what's power that's in the church
[2:00:56] now but it's controlled by law and that
[2:01:02] law is not keeping a bunch of
[2:01:04] Commandments it is a law of faith jesus
[2:01:09] said all things are possible to them
[2:01:11] that believe if you can believe it
[2:01:13] whatever God believes you're sold to
[2:01:15] believe that's your
[2:01:16] and the place the souls of your vision
[2:01:19] set upon by faith God gives it to you
[2:01:21] a man ensures you possess it if you can
[2:01:24] find this key to this law of faith and
[2:01:27] opens it to you see what I mean that
[2:01:29] power is controlled if you're son of God
[2:01:31] and you are a daughter until you're a
[2:01:33] daughter of God that never leaves you
[2:01:37] it's with you all the time but your
[2:01:41] faith gets away from it but it's still
[2:01:44] there the deepest Valley you go through
[2:01:51] cannot make you lose your sonship the
[2:01:56] hardest trial given to humanity cannot
[2:02:00] make you be lost
[2:02:02] [Music]
[2:02:03] hallelujah are you there is nothing can
[2:02:07] you hear me there is nothing that can
[2:02:09] separate you from the love of God in
[2:02:11] Christ Jesus
[2:02:12] nothing hallelujah
[2:02:16] hey man but your faith gets away from
[2:02:19] now he said sin doesn't mean to go out
[2:02:22] and drink and carry on go yeah go yeah
[2:02:25] and just believe no more there you are
[2:02:27] you know I find the greatest trouble
[2:02:28] with the Pentecostal church today is
[2:02:31] positionally they don't know who they
[2:02:33] are your sons and daughters of God a lot
[2:02:37] of times you're looking for something
[2:02:38] great to come but you already got it man
[2:02:42] the greatest thing that can be given to
[2:02:44] you
[2:02:44] what is that God's own the Holy Spirit
[2:02:46] and now we are the sons of God not we
[2:02:49] will be we are now and now we are seated
[2:02:51] and together in heavenly places right
[2:02:54] now in Christ Jesus when faith like that
[2:02:57] gets into church the devil moves away
[2:02:59] from the church we must be seeing some
[2:03:03] faith like that movement a man some
[2:03:06] people recognize and I understanding
[2:03:09] their position listen he goes him to say
[2:03:12] Satan hasn't got any illegal rights over
[2:03:15] a Christian you might as well tell the
[2:03:19] devil is Lord he no have any legal
[2:03:22] rights over my lights
[2:03:26] come on he has no legal rights over my
[2:03:29] health over my body over my joy over my
[2:03:35] peace he has no legal rights to take
[2:03:39] anything away I met Jesus is the one
[2:03:43] gave it to me and then a devil big
[2:03:45] enough that can take it away
[2:03:53] unless I give it over to it now every
[2:04:00] time a man gets saved
[2:04:01] how many saved this morning raise your
[2:04:04] hands high you're saved all right when
[2:04:06] do when a man gets saved then God writes
[2:04:10] out a whole big bunch of checks hey man

[2:05:07] said when he says I give you the power
[2:05:09] over unclean spirits a man that's iets

[2:08:09] Brad change it change it David State
[2:08:23] [Applause]
[2:08:32] change
[2:08:33] [Applause]
[2:08:47] but the problem is the problem is were
[2:08:52] weaned on a special revelation that you
[2:08:54] call faith if I can just get you know
[2:08:59] faith as a revelation of the will of God
[2:09:01] well you're not waiting on that you've
[2:09:04] already got it if you just give me the
[2:09:10] faith
[2:09:11] I need a revelation in my healing so
[2:09:13] what do you need an angel come down from
[2:09:15] heaven smite you in the head hit you
[2:09:18] with the sword and say okay now now you
[2:09:21] know I'll give you this sign or I'll
[2:09:23] wait till you feel this goosebumps or
[2:09:25] some other vindication every one of you
[2:09:32] that are saved you raise your hands
[2:09:34] while ago and said you who are saying so
[2:09:37] how many I am of course we ask how many
[2:09:40] I'll not ask you again but when you
[2:09:42] receive that special there are when you
[2:09:44] receive that revelation of salvation
[2:09:46] that was a special revelation you have a
[2:09:52] personal revelation that you are saved
[2:09:56] [Music]
[2:09:57] amen and it was just like Peter when he
[2:10:01] got a revelation died to Christ the Son
[2:10:04] of the Living God he said now wait a
[2:10:07] minute placing blood didn't give this to
[2:10:09] you but my father which is in heaven he
[2:10:13] gave it to you and so therefore you have
[2:10:16] a special revelation a man that you are
[2:10:21] God's child you are his son or you're
[2:10:27] his daughter
[2:10:28] how many would agree with that this one
[2:10:30] I am his son or I'm his daughter
[2:10:34] hey man so I am saved hallelujah I am
[2:10:40] delivered I'm healed did hear the song I
[2:10:46] blame us
[2:10:47] a melon save us there's no shame on me
[2:10:52] [Applause]
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:54] hallelujah I am delivered amens I've
[2:10:58] already received my special revelation
[2:11:03] hey man my special revelation is I am
[2:11:07] redeemed Jesus died for me he gave me
[2:11:12] his Holy Spirit I am his blood wash but
[2:11:18] Bob son or daughter of the Living God
[2:11:22] that's who I am
[2:11:27] hallelujah but what is included in
[2:11:31] redemption now let's talk about this for
[2:11:34] a moment because we say we're redeemed
[2:11:36] but what is it we mean what is it we
[2:11:38] have what are the benefits
[2:11:40] you know he would say in and sums the
[2:11:44] middle chapter of the Bible and he would
[2:11:47] say um lets the Lord O my soul and
[2:11:49] forget not all his benefits you see
[2:11:54] there are benefits of redemption if you
[2:11:57] go with me and into Matthew Hayden verse
[2:11:59] 16 when evening was come that brought to
[2:12:02] him many that was possessed with devils
[2:12:04] and he cast out the spirits didn't
[2:12:13] bother hear that ain't said it yet but
[2:12:16] did you read it he cast out the spirits
[2:12:19] with his word
[2:12:21] having Adam control
[2:12:26] his word is that right he's felt and it
[2:12:30] happened when was the sweat of his brow
[2:12:32] and Jesus a second Adam he casts out
[2:12:34] spirits with his well guess what that
[2:12:40] means me and you ain't gonna have to
[2:12:42] extract him like a tooth man we're gonna
[2:12:47] use the word because God's words gonna
[2:12:50] become our words and when we speak his
[2:12:52] words it has power because the word will
[2:12:56] defeat the devil anyplace anywhere
[2:12:58] anytime that's why you gotta get in love
[2:13:01] with your Bible because it's God's love
[2:13:05] letter to you and it's your checkbook
[2:13:08] and you ain't wrote out enough checks
[2:13:12] yet hey man and he cast out spirits with
[2:13:19] his word and he healed all that was sick
[2:13:24] then it might be fulfilled which was
[2:13:27] spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying
[2:13:29] himself took our infirmities and bare
[2:13:32] our sickness now this comes from the
[2:13:37] from Isaiah 53 verse 4 and we're going
[2:13:40] to look at that for a moment because you
[2:13:44] know brother Joe is telling me of a
[2:13:46] friend he's a pastor friend and a great
[2:13:51] man nice very nice man he believes that
[2:13:54] God it can heal but not that he will
[2:13:57] heal because he does not believe that
[2:14:01] healing was paid for at Calvary now
[2:14:08] those are underprivileged children
[2:14:12] and man they're not living at they're
[2:14:14] living below their privilege but let's
[2:14:17] just read it of course the Bible said I
[2:14:19] want you to go back to Matthew 8:16 for
[2:14:22] a moment those that were possessed with
[2:14:24] devil he cast out the spirits he healed
[2:14:27] all that was sick that it might be
[2:14:29] fulfilled in other words this would be
[2:14:33] the fulfillment of what Jesus came to do
[2:14:37] this seed that would come to bruise the
[2:14:40] head of the serpent then it might be
[2:14:42] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
[2:14:46] prophet saying he took our firm ''tis
[2:14:48] and bare our sicknesses on your day
[2:14:51] there and again the denominational world
[2:14:53] says see it's for sin that he healed a
[2:14:57] son not from sickness but jesus said
[2:15:02] that he bear our sickness that he might
[2:15:07] fulfill a man and it wouldn't be fully
[2:15:11] fulfilled until Calvary on the cross
[2:15:14] that he would carry our sickness and
[2:15:18] bare our infirmities are you with me now
[2:15:22] let's go to Isaiah 53 and verse 4 I love
[2:15:26] to give the devil a black eye I mean
[2:15:29] surely he had borne our grease oh man
[2:15:34] that is from the word kohli in the greek
[2:15:37] coming in the Hebrews and that word
[2:15:40] means sickness so surely he had borne
[2:15:44] our sickness what and carried our
[2:15:48] sorrows and that is from the Hebrew word
[2:15:53] Maccabi which means pain both middle
[2:15:57] pain and physical pain yet we did esteem
[2:16:01] him stricken stricken and smitten of God
[2:16:07] and afflicted but he was wounded
[2:16:13] for our transgressions hallelujah
[2:16:18] and it was bruised that when we did
[2:16:20] things that we knew better than to do
[2:16:22] and we did it many how what didn't you
[2:16:26] he was bruised for our iniquity and the
[2:16:30] chastisement which means the weapons we
[2:16:33] should have got he took them for us
[2:16:37] they were taken upon him so we could
[2:16:40] have peace not shouting grounds right
[2:16:43] there and with His stripes we are healed
[2:16:48] now the denominational world means that
[2:16:51] mean they think that means say that in
[2:16:53] other words are our soul was saved but
[2:16:55] that's not what it means it comes from
[2:16:57] the word Arafah which means to heal to
[2:17:00] make helpful a man so by His stripes we
[2:17:05] were Bharata which is we are healed this
[2:17:08] is why he called himself Jehovah Rapha I
[2:17:12] will put none of these diseases upon
[2:17:15] thee which I brought upon the Egyptians
[2:17:17] for I am the lord that healeth thee I am
[2:17:23] Jehovah Rapha I am Jehovah the healer
[2:17:28] hallelujah so if he bore them then why

[2:21:07] hey math God wanted to be sure that you
[2:21:11] have the victory
[2:21:12] so he gave us his own spirit and every
[2:21:16] attribute of his spirit to dwell in us
[2:21:18] you have his spirit in what is yet an
[2:21:24] earthen vessel if you live with me and
[2:21:27] second Corinthians four and seven
[2:21:30] because you see then this is what Satan
[2:21:34] can't figure out because he know we got
[2:21:38] this body of ours by him perverting the
[2:21:42] word right hey man so because of that
[2:21:47] he's kinda he thinks he has us he has a
[2:21:51] sense of ownership but I wanted to show
[2:21:54] you this morning what the Bible said we
[2:21:58] have this treasure this Holy Spirit in
[2:22:03] earthen vessels that the excellency of
[2:22:07] the power may be of God and not of us so
[2:22:14] God wanted to show it wasn't Adam
[2:22:19] it was him men say let's have him fall
[2:22:24] and then he redeems us the sons of that
[2:22:28] to show to the devil it never was Adam
[2:22:31] it was me it was me it was my word that
[2:22:36] was ruling it was my truth that was for
[2:22:39] Baylin
[2:22:40] it was my faith I gave to him Adam did
[2:22:45] it all by me by my face what's now so he
[2:22:51] made this this treasure give we have
[2:22:55] this treasure in earthen vessels that
[2:22:57] the excellency of the power may be of
[2:22:59] God not of us so this treasure makes the
[2:23:04] excellency of the power to be of God it
[2:23:07] is not the vessel of Earth or this flash
[2:23:10] it's the treasure that is in us now
[2:23:17] so I am weak because of the earthen
[2:23:21] vessel and yet I'm strong because of the
[2:23:24] treasure
[2:23:26] I'm limited bound in a body of time and
[2:23:30] yet I have no limitations because I am

[2:24:20] vessel I have a treasure I have been
[2:24:29] recreated then did you give that I have
[2:24:34] been recreated and this time the spirit
[2:24:37] that I should have had at the beginning

[2:28:51] were wise scholars by human standards
[2:28:53] not many were you in positions of power
[2:28:56] not many of you were considered to be
[2:28:58] the elite when you answered God's call
[2:29:01] amen but verse 27 said but God has
[2:29:04] chosen the foolish things of the world
[2:29:06] to confound the wise and God has chosen
[2:29:08] the weak things of the world can find
[2:29:10] the things that are mighty so God chose
[2:29:15] you let me give you that translation
[2:29:41] again God chose those who the world's
[2:29:44] consume for your foolish to shame those
[2:29:46] who think their wise and God chose the
[2:29:49] puny and the powerless to shame the high
[2:29:53] and mighty amen verse 28 and base things
[2:29:59] of the world and the things which are
[2:30:01] despised hath God chosen yay then things
[2:30:05] which are not to bring to nought things
[2:30:07] that are in other words he chose the
[2:30:11] lowly the laughable the despised the
[2:30:15] outcasts all of this is in the world's
[2:30:18] eyes the nobodies so that he can take
[2:30:22] you and make you something that would
[2:30:25] shame the somebodies he chose what is
[2:30:30] regarded as insignificant to supersede
[2:30:33] what is regarded as prominent know what
[2:30:37] that know
[2:30:38] could glory in his presence so that
[2:30:43] there would be no place for pride for
[2:30:45] both stand in God's presence but of him
[2:30:48] are ye in Christ Jesus who is who of God
[2:30:53] is made unto us wisdom and righteousness

[2:31:02] us and he is our god-given wisdom a man
[2:31:05] our virtue our holiness and I redemption

[2:33:34] man that's what you were predestinated
[2:33:36] to be conformed to the image of his son
[2:33:38] the spirit of life once in G works in
[2:33:42] you according to the law of faith and
[2:33:45] faith is Allah all things are possible
[2:33:48] to them that believe a man it's a law
[2:33:52] faces of law that Jesus that God himself
[2:33:56] uses a man by faith God created the
[2:33:59] world the Bible said in Hebrews 11:3 but
[2:34:03] faith that we understand that the world
[2:34:06] was the world's was framed by the Word
[2:34:08] of God he created the molecules dadums
[2:34:12] all by faith he created the world on
[2:34:16] this this son but faith faith is a law
[2:34:20] by which he controls everything God
[2:34:23] could not have created anything without
[2:34:26] faith a man powers and attributes and
[2:34:30] authority was already there but there's
[2:34:33] nothing that says that God that was
[2:34:36] created or God without to add anything
[2:34:39] to him a man he says I'm the Lord and I
[2:34:42] changed not he said in me there's no
[2:34:45] variableness north's shadow returning he
[2:34:48] cannot change
[2:34:49] a man he cannot take away from himself
[2:34:52] it was already in him to be a healer a
[2:34:55] savior a redeemer of creator of father
[2:35:00] but all of it would have been useless
[2:35:02] without faith I'll tell you God does
[2:35:06] everything himself
[2:35:08] by faith a man faith had to be never
[2:35:12] before anything can be created he's
[2:35:15] being a creator had to work according to
[2:35:17] his own law of faith in order for there
[2:35:19] to be a creation there could be no lamb
[2:35:22] slain before the foundation world unless
[2:35:24] he had faith a man there would not be a
[2:35:27] people whose name was in the book of
[2:35:29] life unless he had faith a man a man
[2:35:36] jesus knew it was not his earthen vessel
[2:35:39] that was doing the work yet he was the
[2:35:44] Virgin born and without sin but even
[2:35:46] said he said in John 14 10 believe it's
[2:35:49] not that I'm in the father and the
[2:35:51] father me and the words I speaking to
[2:35:53] you I speak not I myself but the father
[2:35:56] dwelleth in me he doeth the what man so
[2:36:01] jesus knew he was not his roots and
[2:36:03] vessel you are looking at yours and
[2:36:05] vessel and you said I can't do this and
[2:36:09] Jesus could look at his own earthen
[2:36:11] vessel he said I cannot my own self I
[2:36:14] cannot do this
[2:36:19] [Applause]
[2:36:28] look at Jesus there and that gatherer
[2:36:32] with all them Devils would come there
[2:36:34] and look at it and look at me sighs how
[2:36:37] did you get in there
[2:36:38] I see more oh man the spies behind those
[2:36:51] eyes Jesus they would take and take
[2:37:02] dominion over legions not one legions
[2:37:07] millions of Devils at one time somebody
[2:37:11] help me preach why the fullness of the
[2:37:14] Godhead dwelt in him hello somebody
[2:37:20] amen but if you just got a little bit of
[2:37:23] God in you by the Holy Ghost there's
[2:37:27] enough power in there to make a world a
[2:37:29] man the disciples were given power to
[2:37:33] heal the sick cast out devils they met a
[2:37:37] they met a devil they couldn't cast out
[2:37:39] because Christ was only walking with him
[2:37:43] then he wasn't living in them and only
[2:37:46] when he came walking up did the devil
[2:37:49] have to leave are you with me but Jesus
[2:37:52] had faith and what he said would happen
[2:37:54] Jesus not only had power because he was
[2:37:57] the word he had faith with his power
[2:37:59] Jesus relied on no and he wants the word
[2:38:02] a man in other words he understood his
[2:38:05] origin he understood his birth what I'm
[2:38:10] trying to get you to do is understand
[2:38:12] your birth
[2:38:13] a man you can only have faith when you
[2:38:17] understand your origin and when you
[2:38:20] understand your birth that you are the
[2:38:23] word that your is offspring that you are
[2:38:26] the scripture made manifest or made
[2:38:29] flesh are you with me now we're born
[2:38:32] again
[2:38:32] Peter said not a corruptible seed but of
[2:38:34] the Word of God we have been born of the
[2:38:37] word so we are born of the logos
[2:38:41] hallelujah the locals gave birth to
[2:38:44] another logos the word gave birth to
[2:38:47] another word a man and every son of God
[2:38:52] our God is the thought of God Express
[2:38:54] which is the Word of God are you with me
[2:38:57] you are the word this is why would say
[2:38:59] in read revelation 19 you are the true
[2:39:02] sayings of God a man that we are the one
[2:39:04] called to the marriage supper the lamb
[2:39:06] the logos the true sayings and then
[2:39:10] you're a word bride I'm coming down to
[2:39:13] the end so hang on tight we're gonna
[2:39:15] come in for a fast landing now listen
[2:39:17] amendments you don't understand your
[2:39:20] position this is the problem today it's
[2:39:23] not a position you earned a man it's not
[2:39:27] a position or that you you work for it
[2:39:31] is position given to you by redemption
[2:39:35] a man and it was his own blood that was
[2:39:40] paid and I ask you what's it enough is
[2:39:44] it enough it's a lamb worthy is the lamb
[2:39:48] worthy is it sufficient now that
[2:39:54] therefore then because of you were born
[2:39:57] of him the old man but you understand
[2:40:04] this birth but you into righteousness
[2:40:09] you can speak that means you can
[2:40:13] prophesy not sons and daughters shall

[2:40:25] can these bones live prophesy Son of Man
[2:40:29] [Applause]
[2:40:33] speak the word to it as your own
[2:40:42] hallelujah Jesus he relied in knowing he
[2:40:46] wants the word I'm trying to get you to
[2:40:49] rely on your new birth now a man you
[2:40:52] have faith in God who made you the word
[2:40:56] come on church if you're born of God
[2:40:58] don't skip birth the dogs cats give
[2:41:01] birth to cats come on somebody but when
[2:41:04] God gives birth
[2:41:06] he gives birth to gods
[2:41:09] and now you are the sons of God you're
[2:41:12] the offspring of Almighty God by the new
[2:41:15] birth a man therefore you are given a
[2:41:19] position but do you understand your
[2:41:22] position Jesus took his position because
[2:41:27] of what the word said not because he
[2:41:31] felt goosebumps not because somebody ran
[2:41:34] the aisle not because somebody else
[2:41:36] profess to believe it Jesus looked in
[2:41:39] the word and he said it's written at me
[2:41:42] thou shall not leave his soul in hell he
[2:41:45] didn't say Jesus but Jesus says own name
[2:41:50] there that's I'm not leaving soul in
[2:41:54] Hell neither shall the Holy One see
[2:41:56] corruption you say Jesus use that word
[2:41:59] all that Noah did there's a Holy One in
[2:42:02] this they called the product price
[2:42:05] hallelujah amen and he will not leave us
[2:42:09] in this hell of the oldest eeeh and this
[2:42:12] evilly neither will he allow this body
[2:42:15] to be corrupted by Satan said Billy
[2:42:20] healed of three different Gavilan hell
[2:42:25] he'll bankrupt all of heaven to see that
[2:42:30] this bride makes it I'm talking about a
[2:42:33] mighty God today amen jesus knew whether
[2:42:37] he was old not transfiguration or
[2:42:39] whether he was in the wilderness a
[2:42:41] temptation or if he was on a boat about
[2:42:43] to be sunk or if he was standing before
[2:42:45] a million demons and a man jesus knew
[2:42:48] who he was he knew it because of what
[2:42:51] God said he said that they filled him
[2:42:54] with the Holy Ghost a man he said this
[2:42:56] day I have begotten you
[2:42:58] a man the Spirit of God came over him is
[2:43:01] that right and then said this is my
[2:43:03] beloved son and whom I please said well
[2:43:06] in you say brother Tim I wish I had that
[2:43:08] experience every Holy Ghost filled
[2:43:11] person has that experience I might have
[2:43:15] an open spirit that sins upon the son or
[2:43:18] daughter of God that is repeated you may
[2:43:23] not have seen the light you may not have
[2:43:26] heard the voice but you know something
[2:43:27] happened there was a down came down on

[2:43:35] creature in Christ Jesus you're not the
[2:43:37] same old man you were
[2:43:39] [Applause]
[2:43:43] now Jesus is now living not an albums
[2:43:51] body not in the second Adams body but
[2:44:04] Jesus has come down and took over the
[2:44:08] perverted body you got from your first
[2:44:11] birth that Satan got ahold of your soil
[2:44:17] and corrupted it and finding it and
[2:44:22] defiled it go back and look at him
[2:44:26] there he was from the hand that God
[2:44:29] created and now Satan comes to live and

[2:44:42] used to fellowship they used to speak in
[2:44:45] control atmosphere now becomes possessed
[2:44:50] by sin by Satan by the serpent and now
[2:44:56] he's defeated and now these hands that
[2:44:58] used to praise God hung down these feet
[2:45:02] that used to walk in his paths walking
[2:45:04] wrong paths his body becomes members of
[2:45:08] the Spirit that dwells in him but God
[2:45:14] pulled a fast one on the devil
[2:45:17] he said what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
[2:45:20] take bodies that used to serve sin mouse
[2:45:25] they used to speak loss they used to
[2:45:30] entertain every evil thought them speak
