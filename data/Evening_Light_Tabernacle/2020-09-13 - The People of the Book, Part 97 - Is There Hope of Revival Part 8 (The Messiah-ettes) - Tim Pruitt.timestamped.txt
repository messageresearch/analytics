[41:52] how wonder wonderful word of god we're
[41:54] going to be speaking on the messiahs
[41:56] this morning
[41:58] i trust that it'll be a blessing to you
[42:00] as we
[42:01] look into the word and i am i am going
[42:04] to
[42:05] um read two scriptures today
[42:10] and it's going to be one from acts
[42:12] chapter 10 verse 38
[42:15] and we have been reading how god
[42:18] anointed jesus
[42:19] of nazareth with the holy ghost and with
[42:21] power
[42:22] who went on about doing good and healing
[42:25] all that was oppressed of the devil for
[42:27] god was
[42:28] with him amen and then john 14
[42:32] 12 we will read it in the 13th
[42:35] verse john 14 12 verily verily i say
[42:39] unto you he that believeth on me the
[42:41] works that i do
[42:43] shall he do also in greater works than
[42:45] these shall he do
[42:47] because i go unto my father
[42:50] and whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[42:54] that will i do that the father may be
[42:56] glorified
[42:58] in the son amen god bless you
[43:01] you may be seated last week we spoke on
[43:05] the messiah and the messiahs and we were
[43:08] speaking along of
[43:10] christ being the anointed one and
[43:13] and as we were speaking that you know
[43:16] peter received that great
[43:18] revelation from god that said thou art
[43:21] the christ
[43:22] the son of the living god or you're the
[43:24] anointed one the christ
[43:26] that's what that means and um
[43:29] and so and that is what the church
[43:33] is built upon is that he is the christ
[43:37] the son of the living god and then he
[43:39] said but and i say unto you that
[43:41] thou art peter so you see as it
[43:44] turns that after the revelation
[43:47] of christ then he tells you
[43:51] who you are amen and this
[43:54] this is a whole thing that the church is
[43:56] built upon is really
[43:58] a true revelation of who jesus is
[44:02] amen that he's not no he's not some
[44:05] a second person of the godhead or some
[44:08] third person or
[44:09] he's not even a minor lord under lord he
[44:12] is the lord god almighty
[44:15] amen the lord jesus christ and any
[44:18] message
[44:19] any church any movement any religion
[44:22] must be
[44:23] built upon the revelation of the thought
[44:26] to christ
[44:27] thou art the anointed one
[44:31] and if the messiah if the anointing
[44:33] isn't there
[44:35] get away from it amen you say well
[44:38] while my group has got a superior
[44:40] revelation but
[44:42] if the anointing isn't there is just a
[44:44] dead form
[44:46] it cannot be a true message without the
[44:48] anointing you cannot
[44:50] be a true christian without the
[44:52] anointing
[44:54] any church without mark 16 an action
[44:57] cannot be the true church of god
[45:00] without his anointing the church is dead
[45:03] it is powerless it is a facade
[45:06] that has the outward appearance of being
[45:09] the bride of christ but
[45:11] inside is full of empty promises
[45:15] puts me in mind to these cover girls
[45:17] beautiful on the outside but
[45:19] do you ever think they want to be a
[45:20] mother do you think they want to be
[45:23] have a baby nursing on her stretch marks
[45:26] on that bewitching enchanting body
[45:29] to her to that kind of woman this is a
[45:31] disgrace
[45:33] but and as brother branham would say and
[45:36] we have echoed it so often think of it
[45:38] today a
[45:39] disgrace for her to have a child she
[45:41] can't be bothered with the baby nursing
[45:44] her it'll just
[45:44] form her when she's impregnated
[45:48] it'll just form her she won't look like
[45:50] she used to
[45:52] again and can you imagine they don't
[45:55] want him
[45:56] today and neither do they want his
[45:58] children
[46:00] and and and of course that's what
[46:03] brother branham told us
[46:04] uh in the invisible union he says
[46:07] neither does the modern church
[46:10] want any of these screaming shouting
[46:12] tongues speak in acts 2 38
[46:14] youngins around her hey man see yeah
[46:17] she don't want any of them whooping and
[46:19] crying and screaming
[46:20] amen hallelujah well a child like that
[46:24] would put her out of her denomination
[46:25] they had one like that in one of the
[46:27] churches why they throw her out right
[46:28] quick
[46:29] why are you letting such stuff as that
[46:31] go as this go along and
[46:33] and you think sometimes that is only
[46:35] describing
[46:37] maybe a denominational move but you
[46:40] you wouldn't you know you don't think
[46:42] they would do that
[46:43] no not in the message church but i just
[46:46] spoke to a brother this week you know
[46:47] who was kicked out of an assembly
[46:50] for believing the supernatural working
[46:52] of the spirit of god
[46:54] and desiring and longing to see a move
[46:56] of god in his
[46:57] in their midst you see as
[47:00] as it is you said she's impregnated with
[47:03] something
[47:04] because she's bringing forth members all
[47:05] the time but she don't want any of these
[47:07] screaming holler and blabbered acts 238
[47:10] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[47:12] are why it would embarrass her
[47:15] it would ruin her and her educated
[47:18] ethical scientific society that she
[47:20] belonged to here
[47:21] they would throw her out at the next
[47:23] council amen it's amazing
[47:26] it's amazing that now jesus with dirty
[47:29] feet
[47:29] is sitting in many messy churches today
[47:33] we don't want that kind of case here
[47:35] don't you
[47:36] dare treat my jesus that way
[47:39] amen you welcome him you invite him
[47:43] you wash his feet amen you put the
[47:46] the garment upon him you perform you you
[47:48] perfume him with oil
[47:50] and let the sweetness of it just fill
[47:53] with its aroma
[47:54] fill the place amen and you
[47:58] give him a service amen so she don't
[48:01] want to be pregnant with the word
[48:03] because
[48:03] that's the only kind the word can bring
[48:07] forth
[48:08] born of the spirit of god it has the
[48:10] spirit of god in it
[48:11] no intellectual church joined creed
[48:14] going bob-haired
[48:15] painted face there's no such a thing as
[48:17] that in it at all
[48:18] you don't find that in the word of god
[48:20] you find the old
[48:22] fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled
[48:26] child
[48:26] born of the spirit of god screaming and
[48:29] hollering and shouting and praising god
[48:32] is there any of them here today there
[48:35] ought to be those kind in this myth
[48:37] today
[48:38] amen old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost
[48:41] field born of the spirit of god
[48:44] screaming
[48:45] and hollering and shouting and praising
[48:47] god
[48:48] that's what ought to be in every message
[48:50] church that truly believes the word of
[48:52] god
[48:53] because that's the only kind the word
[48:55] can bring forth
[48:57] if the church brings forth the child of
[48:59] the second adam
[49:01] he acts like the second adam's way of
[49:03] acting like they did on the day of
[49:04] pentecost
[49:05] all of these things were said by your
[49:07] prophet
[49:08] amen but because the church refuses a
[49:12] spirit she is a barren church
[49:15] she may look like a sex queen she's
[49:17] beautiful on the outside
[49:19] but she has a womb in which the seed
[49:22] never comes to life
[49:23] because she destroys the anointing
[49:27] but the bride receives his life she
[49:30] wants his anointing and she
[49:33] she is bringing forth children of the
[49:35] anointing
[49:37] amen his bride is deity
[49:41] amen she's a messiah because it's the
[49:44] spirit of jesus
[49:46] that is in us that makes us sons of god
[49:49] you see the devil is trying to hide you
[49:52] back and tell you that you're some
[49:54] little
[49:55] downtrodden something but you're not
[49:58] you're sons and daughters of god
[50:00] and brother brandon said they did it
[50:02] isn't just in heaven it
[50:03] is on earth it's in his people amen in
[50:07] question answer 64 the word messiah
[50:09] means the anointed one
[50:11] now if you have the holy spirit then you
[50:14] become the anointed one
[50:18] how many's got the holy ghost you are
[50:20] anointed
[50:22] not only the anointed you are the
[50:24] anointed one
[50:26] no wonder we have turned a message
[50:29] though into a weak and powerless gospel
[50:31] when we question as i was speaking last
[50:34] sunday
[50:34] when we questioned the deity of jesus
[50:36] christ
[50:38] and when we don't recognize them the
[50:41] power that is in us
[50:43] and paul said if any man have not the
[50:45] spirit of christ
[50:47] amen he is none of his right
[50:50] now you know you can't have jesus in you
[50:53] because jesus is a man a corporal body
[50:56] sits on the throne of god but you can
[50:57] have his spirit in you
[50:59] amen so it is the spirit of jesus that
[51:02] is in us
[51:03] so if any man have not the spirit of
[51:05] christ he is
[51:06] none of his amen again
[51:10] and anyone who is his then
[51:13] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[51:16] into your hearts crying never father
[51:19] amen his
[51:20] the spirit of his son has been sent into
[51:24] you that's what the holy ghost is
[51:26] the spirit of jesus a mountain
[51:29] and when his spirit entered to you then
[51:31] it's like he says in galatians 4
[51:34] 7 lord no more a servant but a son and
[51:37] if a son
[51:38] an heir of god through christ
[51:42] john 1 16 says and others fullness have
[51:45] we received
[51:47] grace for grace amen
[51:50] grace upon grace god has given favor
[51:54] upon favor grace upon grace
[51:57] until he pours out his fullness
[52:01] and this is the age of where it's no
[52:04] longer the portion
[52:06] it's the age of his fullness
[52:09] are you with me and man we'll read some
[52:12] quotes from christ's mystery a little
[52:14] later about it but
[52:15] this is the day where the fullness of
[52:17] the godhead
[52:18] is in a body amen just as it was in
[52:22] christ now it's in his body upon the
[52:24] earth
[52:25] in the message perfect faith brother
[52:27] branham said this he
[52:28] he appeared to us in the same form that
[52:31] he appeared
[52:32] that he did to them in the old testament
[52:34] and in the same as he did in the new
[52:36] testament and
[52:37] his shame showed by the same word
[52:40] the same christ and i've declared to you
[52:44] that christ is the holy ghost
[52:48] the word christ means the anointed one
[52:52] just the person that's anointed that's
[52:53] that's the christ the anointed one how
[52:55] many knows that's true
[52:56] the anointed one that there would be a
[52:59] man that would be
[53:00] an anoint would be anointed anointed
[53:02] with what
[53:03] the bible said in acts 10 that jesus of
[53:06] nazareth was a man
[53:07] approved of god anointed with the holy
[53:10] ghost went about and done great works
[53:12] and things
[53:13] see that god manifested and proved that
[53:16] he was in that man and now
[53:19] we become anointed with that same spirit
[53:24] anointed messiahs messiahs of the last
[53:28] days
[53:29] to shine forth the resurrection of jesus
[53:32] christ
[53:32] to show he's not dead
[53:35] but in the form of the holy ghost he's
[53:38] in his people
[53:40] moving among his pride with a love
[53:42] affair to her
[53:44] pouring out into her himself
[53:48] amen and they are becoming one for the
[53:50] wedding supper
[53:52] and the same signs promised by the same
[53:55] god in the same word
[53:57] is making the same manifestation
[54:00] oh hallelujah and he adds he said
[54:02] there's nothing left for us to do but
[54:05] believe it
[54:07] amen and he said and to believe it is
[54:10] the substance
[54:11] and that creates a perfect faith
[54:15] and he said just think how numb we are
[54:18] just think of that just for a minute
[54:20] and i hear him in in desperations talk
[54:23] about it
[54:25] and he says oh church
[54:28] rise and shake yourselves
[54:32] and pinch your conscience and wake
[54:34] yourself up in this hour
[54:36] we must be desperate or perish
[54:40] i don't know if you've noticed or not
[54:41] but we have been we have moved into a
[54:43] very serious time
[54:45] amen there are things that are moving in
[54:49] our midst and
[54:50] things that are changing and our the
[54:53] whole environment is changing around us
[54:55] the whole
[54:56] the whole political arena the whole
[54:58] thought of
[54:59] of of peace and safety things are
[55:02] changing
[55:05] riots and looting in our streets anarchy
[55:09] trouble on every hand and not only that
[55:12] but
[55:12] you know we that's almost the rest of
[55:15] what is going on is almost
[55:16] downplayed by what is happening in our
[55:19] streets but
[55:20] there you have nations rising up flexing
[55:23] their
[55:24] their muscles during this time whether
[55:26] it's china or russia or north korea
[55:29] or or iran or all of them with threats
[55:33] to destroy us all
[55:37] do you realize where we're at amen so he
[55:41] says rise and shake yourself
[55:43] pitch your conscience wake yourself up
[55:45] in this hour
[55:47] he said there's coming forth something
[55:49] from the lord
[55:51] amen i know it is tough saith the lord
[55:54] there's coming forth something and we
[55:56] better get desperate
[55:58] it's between life and death and it'll
[56:00] pass through us
[56:02] and we won't see it and i don't know
[56:04] about you
[56:06] but i don't want to be in some slumber
[56:08] and stupor
[56:10] and miss it
[56:15] i want to see and know exactly what
[56:16] god's doing as i told you when this
[56:19] covet struck early in
[56:21] january february i said you you can see
[56:25] everybody's afraid of this death that's
[56:27] coming into the land and moving through
[56:29] the nations
[56:30] but there's somebody else at work
[56:33] you never see the enemy rise
[56:36] without you seeing a standard rise
[56:38] against it
[56:43] amen are you with me amen you never
[56:46] you never see even the the bottomless
[56:49] pit open
[56:50] without also seeing and that's in
[56:53] revelation 9 we're
[56:54] also seeing a mighty angel putting his
[56:57] foot on
[56:58] it
[57:01] come on placing his feet on the land in
[57:04] the sea
[57:06] are you with me amen you know as as he
[57:09] concludes the night
[57:10] chapter with all of the the evil the
[57:12] devil's rising up out of hell
[57:15] all the evil that is going on the sin
[57:17] and the trouble and the wickedness and
[57:20] and the idolatry as it ends and he and
[57:23] he's talking about and he says
[57:24] he says i see him the bottomless pit
[57:27] open and then the angel is given
[57:29] permission to open it
[57:32] and we conclude the ninth chapter and it
[57:34] opens with the tenth
[57:36] and it says and
[57:41] and there's a conjunction it ties
[57:44] to what was said before with this
[57:48] and i saw another
[57:52] mighty angel i wonder if you're seeing
[57:55] the mighty angel
[57:57] i wonder if you see there's an anointing
[58:00] come down
[58:01] i want you i wonder if you realize that
[58:03] there is somebody
[58:05] in this day of hour receiving that
[58:07] anointing
[58:08] just as the other are receiving the
[58:10] sodomite spirit
[58:11] and the idolatry that's going on in the
[58:14] lamb
[58:20] of course as i said jesus the man
[58:23] the corporal body is not here nor is he
[58:26] within us
[58:27] but the spirit of jesus the anointing
[58:31] is in us this anointing is not
[58:35] external it doesn't come and go
[58:38] it abides forever are you with me
[58:42] it is within us and we must arouse
[58:46] and stir up the gift of god that is
[58:49] within us
[58:51] is that right you know they here here
[58:54] again this is what he tells pete uh
[58:56] timothy he said
[58:57] you know we have not received the spirit
[58:59] of timidity
[59:01] you know we we have not received a
[59:03] spirit of fear
[59:05] of drawing back and shining away hiding
[59:08] in a corner
[59:11] there's no need to we're we're not
[59:14] children that are that are that are
[59:17] immature
[59:18] we're adopted sons we know who we
[59:22] are we have our position amen we
[59:25] we know we're robed with the holy ghost
[59:28] that there's a power within us
[59:30] somebody help me preach amen oh my
[59:34] there again he said arise and and stir
[59:37] up that gift to god
[59:39] that is within you that was there he
[59:41] tells timothy
[59:42] it was darren your grandmother lawyers
[59:45] and it was in your mother eunice
[59:47] but it's also in me you see it was there
[59:51] in the shouting methodists who fainted
[59:54] under the power of god where
[59:56] they actually kept water uh to to throw
[59:59] in their faces
[1:00:00] but that power sanctified them not the
[1:00:03] water
[1:00:04] remember the anointing amen brother
[1:00:07] bradley said they had meetings where
[1:00:09] they were kicked out
[1:00:11] and was called holy rollers you
[1:00:14] methodists was done that they fall in
[1:00:16] the water under the power of god
[1:00:18] they throw water in your face and fandom
[1:00:20] that's right and they jerked so hard
[1:00:22] under it
[1:00:22] till they they had the jerks
[1:00:26] and there was people who would jerk and
[1:00:29] shake
[1:00:29] under the power of god hallelujah
[1:00:33] you see it was there in your grandmother
[1:00:38] amen it was there in the past movements
[1:00:41] it was there on azusa street where they
[1:00:44] spoke in genuine tongues not a shake a
[1:00:47] jaw
[1:00:48] until you stammered something insensible
[1:00:50] but real tongues
[1:00:52] amen that healed the sick as the spirit
[1:00:55] was poured out
[1:00:57] amen amen that faith was there in the
[1:01:01] divine healing movements
[1:01:03] can't we say amen to that amen and i'm
[1:01:06] convinced
[1:01:07] that it's also in you
[1:01:10] hello and i'm convinced it's also in you
[1:01:15] i'm convinced it's also in you i'm
[1:01:18] convinced it's also in you
[1:01:22] come on it's a spirit of faith
[1:01:25] it's not a spirit of fear it's not a
[1:01:28] spirit of drawing back
[1:01:29] it's not a spirit of hiding in the
[1:01:31] corner it's a
[1:01:32] it's not a spirit of intent timidity
[1:01:36] amen i'm being shy and embarrassed about
[1:01:39] it
[1:01:39] it's a faith that is rising up
[1:01:43] it is there in the other moves but it's
[1:01:45] also there
[1:01:46] in you in fact it's not a lesser
[1:01:48] anointing it's a greater anointing
[1:01:51] lois couldn't preach eunice couldn't
[1:01:54] preach but timothy could
[1:01:57] it was even a greater anointing
[1:02:04] stir it up you got to start using it
[1:02:10] and the message adoption brother branham
[1:02:12] said
[1:02:13] he gave jesus christ and jesus gave it
[1:02:16] in his name with this
[1:02:17] assurance asked the father anything in
[1:02:19] my name and i'll do it
[1:02:22] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:02:24] sons of god to position the church
[1:02:27] as i said the book of ephesians the book
[1:02:29] of joshua and joshua placing the people
[1:02:31] where they belong

[1:13:22] the backside of the desert
[1:13:23] and he's forgot all about it but god
[1:13:25] hasn't forgotten
[1:13:27] and sometimes we as humans forget
[1:13:32] but god don't god gave a word for this
[1:13:36] generation and god don't forget
[1:13:39] i mean sometimes we as humans grow cold

[1:13:44] come on but god don't
[1:13:48] i have heard their christ and i have
[1:13:51] come down to deliver them
[1:13:54] i like those words this is why i'm here
[1:13:57] this is why the anointing comes for
[1:14:00] deliverance
[1:14:04] not just to make you run the aisle
[1:14:07] but for deliverance
[1:14:11] why christ speak brother adam talks
[1:14:13] about moses having met the burning bush
[1:14:16] that the word was vindicated exactly it
[1:14:18] was the word
[1:14:19] moses didn't have to worry what's this
[1:14:21] voice all about
[1:14:23] what is this being here and i want you
[1:14:25] to know god sent an angel to this
[1:14:27] generation
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:30] amen when god sent an angel to william
[1:14:33] branham he sent that angel to me
[1:14:37] is that right amen he sent it to me
[1:14:40] it was a message i'm sending you with a
[1:14:42] message
[1:14:44] of divine healing of deliverance
[1:14:49] amen that message never changed even
[1:14:51] when it came to mysteries
[1:14:53] that had had been hidden from the
[1:14:55] believers and and
[1:14:56] sealed away it didn't change i've come
[1:14:59] for
[1:15:00] deliverance to open the book
[1:15:03] to loose the seals can't you understand
[1:15:06] i've come down for a purpose i've come
[1:15:09] down for deliverance
[1:15:12] to reveal to you the mystery of your
[1:15:14] life
[1:15:15] your misunderstood ways amen
[1:15:19] why you can't fit in this world
[1:15:22] amen and why you got an attraction to
[1:15:25] the word
[1:15:26] i've come to tell you you were called
[1:15:28] before the foundational world
[1:15:30] before you were formed in your mother's
[1:15:32] womb i knew you
[1:15:33] and ordained you to be a messiah to this
[1:15:36] age
[1:15:45] god had said israel was so would so
[1:15:47] adjourn and be mistreated in a strange
[1:15:49] country
[1:15:51] until the iniquity of the amorites was
[1:15:53] filled
[1:15:56] remember those types very out very much
[1:15:58] the the last age
[1:16:00] because god said now you know
[1:16:04] sin has got to reach a certain height
[1:16:08] before i bring judgment
[1:16:16] and even with sodom he says i have come
[1:16:18] down to see
[1:16:20] if what i'm hearing is true
[1:16:23] now why why would god do that sometimes
[1:16:25] god speaks to man as a man
[1:16:28] so he said god already knew
[1:16:31] right but he comes right down he says
[1:16:33] i've come down
[1:16:35] i've come down and i'm investigating
[1:16:37] sodom

[1:16:54] anti-god
[1:16:55] with sentiments and i'm seeing america
[1:16:58] turn
[1:16:58] from a lamb to a dragon
[1:17:03] i'm watching it amen i see
[1:17:07] i see the beast rising

[1:17:44] until this bride
[1:17:45] goes up and when she goes up satan is
[1:17:48] cast
[1:17:49] down
[1:17:49] [Applause]
[1:17:53] and you're in a battle this morning you
[1:17:55] are in a battle
[1:17:56] of casting satan down
[1:18:00] but i read in the bible that he loses
[1:18:11] moses knew this intellectually the seed
[1:18:15] was born in him it was laying in his
[1:18:16] heart and he tried to intellectual
[1:18:18] experience with the word to
[1:18:20] try to deliver to israel because he knew
[1:18:23] he was born for that purpose
[1:18:26] he knew it was the time he knew the
[1:18:29] scripture said it already been 400 years
[1:18:33] and and and so he he knew all of that
[1:18:37] he knew things were laying in order
[1:18:41] but he needed the anointing
[1:18:44] and i'll tell you you know we we know
[1:18:47] that everything's
[1:18:48] laying in order but you're not gonna get
[1:18:51] through this without the anointing
[1:18:56] that's why we need the anointing more
[1:18:57] than ever
[1:19:00] your family needs to be anointed before
[1:19:03] they go out to school
[1:19:04] and hear all the anti-god evil things
[1:19:08] is being taught they need the anointing
[1:19:17] for our people go out to work we need
[1:19:20] the anointing upon them
[1:19:26] we need the anointing on our young men
[1:19:30] because satan has made women i'm quoting
[1:19:33] your prophet
[1:19:34] so beautiful too they're almost
[1:19:35] irresistible
[1:19:40] and there's a spirit you can say whether
[1:19:41] you want to or not there's a spirit of
[1:19:43] evil upon this
[1:19:44] land upon this country upon this world
[1:19:52] where the men are turned into beasts
[1:19:56] they're there's so many of them they
[1:19:58] can't arrest them all
[1:20:00] child trafficking worse than every child
[1:20:03] child
[1:20:06] beast
[1:20:10] because when men reject the seal of god
[1:20:13] they take the heart of the beast
[1:20:22] so brother brandon said we know we've
[1:20:24] lived the time out
[1:20:26] at the time of the rapture it is at hand
[1:20:30] and we're looking for a rapture in faith
[1:20:32] that can pull the church together
[1:20:34] and get some supernatural strength there
[1:20:36] to change these bodies that we live in
[1:20:39] when we see a god that can raise the
[1:20:41] dead
[1:20:43] off the floor out of the yard and bring
[1:20:45] him back to life again
[1:20:46] and present him before us and when we
[1:20:49] see god who can take cancer
[1:20:51] that's a to man to shadow and raise him
[1:20:53] up to a strong healthy man
[1:20:55] that ought to give rapture and faith to
[1:20:58] the people
[1:21:01] and then when that light flashes from
[1:21:03] the sky and the trumpet sounds
[1:21:05] the body of christ will be quickly
[1:21:07] gathered together
[1:21:09] and changed in a moment and then taken
[1:21:12] into the heavens
[1:21:15] yes there's got to be something like
[1:21:16] that happen
[1:21:20] oh my what you're seeing going on
[1:21:24] is exactly what your prophet preached
[1:21:27] old eagle is sterner nest
[1:21:33] he's letting things get uncomfortable
[1:21:36] he's fluttering over with his wings he's
[1:21:39] blowing out the loose feathers
[1:21:45] because there's a people getting ready
[1:21:46] to fly
[1:21:51] we are not called to be sitting ducks
[1:21:54] we are called to be flying eagles look
[1:21:58] at the anointing in the last day
[1:22:00] it's a flying eagle little children
[1:22:06] more about that later reminding you of
[1:22:09] this
[1:22:10] quote from the token i'm looking for a
[1:22:13] time of the break forth
[1:22:14] of the spirit of god in these last days
[1:22:18] that we're now living in for another
[1:22:20] surge of the holy spirit
[1:22:22] into the church for rapture and faith
[1:22:24] just before it comes
[1:22:26] and everything is sitting straight in
[1:22:28] order for that
[1:22:30] and three kinds of believers he said
[1:22:32] that's the reason i
[1:22:34] do believe that when the bride is called
[1:22:36] out and elected and
[1:22:37] said in the book of life there will come
[1:22:40] a sound from heaven that takes such a
[1:22:43] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:44] holy spirit into that bride that a taker
[1:22:47] from the earth
[1:22:48] in a rapturing grace
[1:22:52] the eagles are about ready to take their
[1:22:54] flight
[1:22:55] that's why the nest is being stripped
[1:23:00] you know the old eagle builds its nest
[1:23:03] out of thorns and thistles and
[1:23:06] weaves them in among the the old you
[1:23:09] know picking up twigs and branches and
[1:23:11] this and that
[1:23:12] and then he piles up his all his sticks
[1:23:15] and
[1:23:16] everything else but when he's about to
[1:23:18] lay her eggs
[1:23:20] she goes out there and gets some maybe
[1:23:23] some
[1:23:24] rabbit or lamb or whatever he can get
[1:23:27] get the softest fur put it out
[1:23:30] and lays it there so those little eagles
[1:23:35] that they have something that's soft and
[1:23:38] comfortable
[1:23:40] he makes it wonderful
[1:23:43] for his little hatchlings
[1:23:46] but when that little eagle gets gets up
[1:23:51] a little bit and begins to mature there
[1:23:54] comes another phase and it's
[1:23:57] nest leaving time
[1:24:01] and the mother knows that this eagle was
[1:24:04] not born
[1:24:05] to stay in a nest all its life
[1:24:08] it was meant to fly so you know what
[1:24:12] happens a mother goes and stirs over her
[1:24:14] nest
[1:24:15] and picks out all of the fleece and the
[1:24:18] and the rabbit fur and the down and
[1:24:20] everything else and throws it out
[1:24:23] and leaves a little eagle on the
[1:24:25] uncomfortable sticks and thorns and
[1:24:27] thistles
[1:24:28] and then they begin to say this ain't
[1:24:31] feeling like home anymore
[1:24:33] there's got to be a better place for me
[1:24:38] amen you know what happens they start
[1:24:40] getting ready to fly
[1:24:42] because that mother knows that that
[1:24:45] eagle can't stay in that nest
[1:24:47] and god knows you cannot just stay in a
[1:24:50] nest
[1:24:51] as immature babies but you're gonna have
[1:24:53] to fly
[1:24:55] in the heavenlies where all things are
[1:24:57] possible
[1:24:58] to them that believe and some of you
[1:25:02] this morning knows you've been taken on
[1:25:04] that flight and god
[1:25:06] has shown you wonderful things and all
[1:25:09] of a sudden you've been
[1:25:10] top you've been knocked off of the
[1:25:12] eagle's back
[1:25:13] and you're twisting and turning and
[1:25:15] whatever and you're screaming
[1:25:17] as to what's going on and what's
[1:25:18] happening and why is this happening
[1:25:21] and oh you know god why is it happening
[1:25:23] god said i'm trying to teach you to fly
[1:25:25] use those wings i gave you
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:34] don't worry he ain't gonna let you hit
[1:25:36] the ground
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:39] he's watching no just waiting to swoop
[1:25:42] down and catch you
[1:25:43] take you back up on the mountain and
[1:25:45] dump you off again
[1:25:51] how in the world are we going to learn
[1:25:52] to cast out devils if devils don't come
[1:25:55] and
[1:25:55] face us how in the world are we going to
[1:25:58] operate by of of casting out sickness
[1:26:02] if sickness doesn't come
[1:26:06] how can you have miracles unless
[1:26:08] calamities happen
[1:26:14] think it's not strange that these hard
[1:26:16] trials come on you
[1:26:19] they're done for a purpose i'm teaching
[1:26:22] you how to fly
[1:26:29] countdown brother branham would talk
[1:26:30] about this
[1:26:32] he says he said he's talking about the
[1:26:36] astronaut age
[1:26:38] he said i pray father they'll realize
[1:26:39] this isn't to condemn what they had is
[1:26:41] only trying to give them more
[1:26:42] rapture and grace that's what this
[1:26:45] message came it didn't come to take from
[1:26:46] you what you had he came to give you
[1:26:48] more
[1:26:50] amen rapture and grace for the hour will
[1:26:52] come when we'll have to have rapture
[1:26:55] power
[1:26:56] not only to heal the body but to change
[1:26:58] it in a moment
[1:26:59] in the twinkling of an eye christ will
[1:27:01] be so real unto their bodies
[1:27:04] till he can change it oh hallelujah
[1:27:07] you mean i can expect the greater
[1:27:09] reality of the holy ghost
[1:27:14] come on christ will be so
[1:27:17] real in their bodies
[1:27:21] your body ain't going to be changed from
[1:27:23] the outside in

[1:27:27] the inside out
[1:27:35] if you ain't got nothing on the inside
[1:27:36] there's no change for you
[1:27:43] christ will be so real in his body told
[1:27:45] their body still he can change it by his
[1:27:47] great death what he purchased

[1:29:30] pretending brother bradley is
[1:29:31] here praying over prayer cloths they're
[1:29:34] pretending that brother branham
[1:29:36] we're going to give you we're going to
[1:29:37] turn the service over to
[1:29:39] god's servants of prophet now pretending
[1:29:42] and they're also pretending they got the
[1:29:44] holy ghost
[1:29:46] because he ain't there and then they're
[1:29:48] pretending oh we got the seal of god no
[1:29:51] kobet's gonna get us and
[1:29:53] well what's that cough and what's that
[1:29:54] sneeze and what's that temperature and
[1:29:57] what's that
[1:29:59] what's that happening among you you're a
[1:30:02] false prophet
[1:30:07] now let me just tell you
[1:30:10] brother branham himself was subject to
[1:30:12] the flu when it came through
[1:30:16] amen he went around for the swine flu
[1:30:19] but he was around for
[1:30:20] what was it asian flu or hong kong flu
[1:30:23] or
[1:30:24] killed hundreds of thousands of people
[1:30:26] around the world
[1:30:27] and brother branham got it
[1:30:31] you see we're human
[1:30:34] pinch yourself and find out you're human
[1:30:38] you're real
[1:30:40] amen your body is subject to sickness
[1:30:44] the most spiritual ones of us but it's
[1:30:47] also
[1:30:47] subject to healing and deliverance and
[1:30:50] the power of god
[1:30:52] this ain't just a one-sided thing are
[1:30:55] you with me
[1:30:56] and he says he says again you know where
[1:30:59] he speaks in this
[1:31:01] he's talking about this body change that
[1:31:03] is coming because
[1:31:04] this is where it will crescendo
[1:31:07] now people listen
[1:31:12] the the the methodist movement ended
[1:31:15] with the dead
[1:31:17] sorry but it did this
[1:31:20] became a denomination the pentecostal
[1:31:24] movement ended with the dead
[1:31:30] sorry but it did you ain't gonna like
[1:31:33] this
[1:31:34] but the divine healing movement ended
[1:31:36] with a dud
[1:31:40] it did a dead thump
[1:31:44] everywhere no revival nowhere
[1:31:48] impersonations everywhere
[1:31:51] and it became cheap and carnal and
[1:31:53] everything else and the excitement was
[1:31:54] gone
[1:31:55] and the euphoria and then and even the
[1:31:58] anointing
[1:32:00] even the desire to pray
[1:32:04] and read it to you from the prophet
[1:32:06] that's the way it ended
[1:32:08] but that ain't the way this movement
[1:32:10] will end
[1:32:12] it's going to end in the change of the
[1:32:13] body in the meeting in the air
[1:32:16] let me read it the resurrection was set
[1:32:19] in first
[1:32:20] the resurrection of those that are
[1:32:22] asleep there will be awakening time
[1:32:24] and those that are asleep in the dust
[1:32:26] now not those that sleep in sin because
[1:32:28] they'll sleep right on
[1:32:29] they want to wait for another thousand
[1:32:31] years but those that are sleeping in the
[1:32:32] dust
[1:32:33] will be awakened first and these
[1:32:35] corruptable bodies will put on
[1:32:37] incorruption
[1:32:38] in the rapture and grace of the lord and
[1:32:40] then we'll all get together
[1:32:44] and when they begin together then we
[1:32:46] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:32:47] changed
[1:32:48] and then these mortal bodies will not
[1:32:51] see death but just
[1:32:52] all of a sudden there'll be like a sweep
[1:32:57] go over us and you're changed
[1:33:01] you're turned back like abraham was from
[1:33:03] an old man to a young man from an old
[1:33:05] woman to a young woman
[1:33:07] what's this sudden change and after a
[1:33:09] while
[1:33:10] you're traveling like a thought and you
[1:33:13] see those den that are already
[1:33:15] resurrected
[1:33:19] hallelujah amen we're not talking about
[1:33:22] a philip translation
[1:33:24] that gets picked up and set back over
[1:33:26] here on the earth again
[1:33:28] even though it did good come on amen but
[1:33:31] but no we're not talking about a philip
[1:33:33] translation we're talking about
[1:33:35] a rapture a real an enoch translation
[1:33:38] where you get so far with god you don't
[1:33:40] come back home
[1:33:42] with all the word the anointing just
[1:33:44] keeps getting greater and greater and
[1:33:46] greater not less and less and less
[1:33:49] are you with me it's enoch brother
[1:33:51] branham said no i may not have faith
[1:33:53] to make every word of it act but i
[1:33:55] certainly wouldn't stand in the way of
[1:33:56] anybody
[1:33:57] that did have that faith he had faith
[1:33:59] one day
[1:34:00] enough one day to take an afternoon
[1:34:02] stroll with god and just keep on walking
[1:34:05] and went up home without dying but now i
[1:34:08] think the church has got to come to that
[1:34:09] rapture in faith
[1:34:10] i may not have that faith just now but i
[1:34:13] wouldn't stand in the way of someone who
[1:34:15] did have that faith
[1:34:17] again he says and this is that was 64-65
[1:34:21] i'd certainly like to have faith like
[1:34:22] that
[1:34:23] i hope that we do get that faith someday
[1:34:25] as we
[1:34:26] grow on in to him
[1:34:33] of this anointing we have received
[1:34:37] grace for grace
[1:34:41] as the prophecy brother joe expressed it
[1:34:44] again
[1:34:44] wednesday night and brought it back to
[1:34:46] the forefront as a prophecy was given to
[1:34:48] me
[1:34:49] a series of victories
[1:34:58] amen a series of victories
[1:35:03] you know i personally we we had a we had

[1:38:08] grow let it begin to move
[1:38:11] and that's not just for even like
[1:38:12] tabernacles that's for around the world
[1:38:14] let your faith lose there's a series of
[1:38:17] victories on the way
[1:38:19] [Applause]
[1:38:23] it's a shame that message churches that
[1:38:26] we have
[1:38:26] moved away from faith
[1:38:30] and identified christ of all ages
[1:38:33] brother branham said by gift of god i
[1:38:36] want to identify i want jesus to
[1:38:38] identify himself to the word that i've
[1:38:40] just preached
[1:38:41] to show this is the hour the word is
[1:38:43] lotted to this
[1:38:44] hour that we pass the denominational
[1:38:46] ranks
[1:38:47] and we're fixing to go to the rapture
[1:38:49] just trying to get
[1:38:50] people faith to believe
[1:38:53] then he uses illustration like the
[1:38:56] pyramid on the back of your dollar bill
[1:38:58] you know how it moves up and then
[1:39:00] there's a capstone
[1:39:02] and he uses that he said that headstone
[1:39:04] will have to be so
[1:39:05] perfect like the rest of them until it
[1:39:08] would
[1:39:09] fit right straight into it
[1:39:12] the ministry of christ will be in his
[1:39:15] church
[1:39:15] just exactly like him in spirit when he
[1:39:18] comes to take the church to redeem the
[1:39:20] whole thing
[1:39:21] then goes up so again
[1:39:25] the church the minister of christ will
[1:39:27] be in his church
[1:39:29] remember we've got to fit him
[1:39:33] the capstone that's coming so there's
[1:39:35] got to be a ministry
[1:39:37] on earth in the bride that matches the
[1:39:40] christ that is coming
[1:39:42] so that the truth can be won
[1:39:46] it has to fit
[1:39:50] the bride is the anointed one this day
[1:39:51] she's not the less anointed she is the
[1:39:53] messiah
[1:39:55] for this day to be as bright she has to
[1:39:58] be anointed
[1:39:59] as he was anointed
[1:40:03] i hear brother branham saying it like
[1:40:04] this and what shall i do with jesus
[1:40:06] called christ
[1:40:07] the dynamics of this church will be a
[1:40:09] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:40:12] i'm stopping right there just to say i'm
[1:40:14] so ready for my refilling
[1:40:18] i'm so ready for this church to have a
[1:40:21] refilling
[1:40:22] i'm so ready for this bride to have a
[1:40:24] refilling
[1:40:25] around the world in every church a fire
[1:40:28] lit yes
[1:40:29] amen you don't have to come the evening
[1:40:31] like tabernacle together you got to get
[1:40:33] into christ to get it
[1:40:35] amen i'm so ready for it the dynamics of
[1:40:38] this church will be a
[1:40:39] refilling of the holy ghost there's a
[1:40:41] refilling promise for you
[1:40:45] how many he's got the holy ghost raise
[1:40:46] your hand amen there's a refilling
[1:40:49] promise for you
[1:40:50] and if you don't have it it's promised
[1:40:52] to for the promises to you and to your
[1:40:54] children to them that are thorough
[1:40:56] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:40:58] call and i know he's still calling
[1:41:00] because we're still here
[1:41:04] amen amen when that
[1:41:08] he said the dynamics of this church will
[1:41:10] be a refilling of the holy ghost that
[1:41:12] we've worked in a small
[1:41:13] measure while the headstone is coming
[1:41:16] down to unite with the body but
[1:41:18] when the head and the body unites
[1:41:20] together the full power of the holy
[1:41:22] ghost would raise her up just
[1:41:23] exactly like that even the dead that's
[1:41:26] dead in christ for hundreds of years
[1:41:28] will rise
[1:41:29] in the beauty of his holiness and take a
[1:41:32] flight
[1:41:32] to disguise the dynamics is
[1:41:36] the holy spirit now
[1:41:39] you see because of the multitudes
[1:41:42] of miracles and the pinpoint miraculous
[1:41:46] sign of the messiah being displayed
[1:41:50] in his ministry do you know some people
[1:41:52] actually
[1:41:53] thought that brother branham was the
[1:41:55] messiah
[1:41:57] they actually taught him god they
[1:42:00] thought him jesus christ
[1:42:04] amen you see the identification of a
[1:42:08] messiah anointed one
[1:42:10] is signs and wonders and they saw it so
[1:42:14] perfectly
[1:42:15] in brother branham they thought him
[1:42:18] to be jesus
[1:42:24] so that's awful brother timmy it's his
[1:42:26] antichrist really
[1:42:27] but really it's also has to be in john
[1:42:30] the baptist's ministry
[1:42:33] come on amen because they ask him are
[1:42:36] you the christ
[1:42:40] so it has to be in the forerunner's
[1:42:42] ministry for people to think
[1:42:44] william branham was the christ
[1:42:47] you see you remember when john when men
[1:42:50] came
[1:42:50] from john and said john sent us said are
[1:42:53] you him or shall we look for another
[1:42:56] remember we went over that scripture
[1:42:58] last year and and
[1:43:00] he didn't say anything he just cured
[1:43:02] many of their infirmities and plagues
[1:43:04] and evil spirits and
[1:43:05] to the blind he gave sight and then he
[1:43:08] said
[1:43:09] go your way and tell john what you saw
[1:43:12] amen how that the blind see the lame
[1:43:15] walk
[1:43:16] the lepers are clean the devs here the
[1:43:18] dead's raised
[1:43:19] and the poor to the poor the gospel is
[1:43:21] priests
[1:43:22] because that's the sign of the most of
[1:43:25] an anointed one
[1:43:33] that is the sign of the anointed one
[1:43:40] i don't want you to miss that oh yeah
[1:43:43] that was a sign of jesus
[1:43:44] yeah it was
[1:43:48] but that's also the sign of his bride
[1:43:58] you know some maybe gas this morning so
[1:44:00] you mean
[1:44:01] to tell me people actually thought that
[1:44:03] william branham was god
[1:44:04] well yeah and to believe that is
[1:44:06] antichrist of course we know that
[1:44:09] but before you criticize william branham
[1:44:11] for something
[1:44:12] he not just denied but he openly
[1:44:14] detested
[1:44:17] i want to ask you a question when was
[1:44:18] the time you lived so close to god
[1:44:21] it was so much like jesus somebody
[1:44:23] mistook you for jesus
[1:44:31] somebody had the audacity to ask him
[1:44:35] must have been going around must have
[1:44:36] been talked about must have been
[1:44:38] in the congregation must have been when
[1:44:40] people were talking
[1:44:42] so brother branham and then he he said
[1:44:45] let me let me see what this
[1:44:46] is he reads it over and he starts
[1:44:48] reading again
[1:44:49] brother branham is commonly believed by
[1:44:51] many that follow your message that you
[1:44:53] are the messiah
[1:44:54] of this day is that soul
[1:44:59] now remember last week we have
[1:45:02] message believers who don't even believe
[1:45:05] that jesus is god
[1:45:09] this week we're talking for a moment
[1:45:11] about those who believe william branham
[1:45:13] is god
[1:45:16] you see it goes back to the where peter
[1:45:19] was
[1:45:20] they're missing the revelation of a new
[1:45:23] birth
[1:45:26] amen that they know who the christ
[1:45:29] is are you with me
[1:45:33] and he says first place i'm not a
[1:45:35] messiah
[1:45:36] jesus is messiah it must seem messiah is
[1:45:39] jesus christ
[1:45:40] but we are messiahettes every one of us
[1:45:44] messiah messiah means anointed one
[1:45:48] and in him dwells the fullness of the
[1:45:50] godhead bodily
[1:45:51] in me and you and me just dwells part of
[1:45:54] his spirit
[1:45:55] the same as dwells in you he said jesus
[1:45:58] had god without portion
[1:46:05] i only have god by portion
[1:46:08] because on the day of pentecost
[1:46:10] everybody that was there and
[1:46:12] everyone that's been born of god got a
[1:46:13] lick of that pillar of fire
[1:46:15] a tongue of that fire a lick of that
[1:46:18] fire
[1:46:19] a flame of that fire
[1:46:24] because the holy spirit divided himself
[1:46:28] that all that he was in jesus now
[1:46:30] there's 120
[1:46:32] jesus my god the devil didn't know what
[1:46:36] to do with 120 jesus
[1:46:38] he thought he crucified him and he went
[1:46:40] back to heaven
[1:46:42] but now he doesn't know what to do with
[1:46:43] 120 jesus
[1:46:47] because now the spirit of god has
[1:46:48] divided itself
[1:46:50] and there's 120 and god ain't through
[1:46:52] because 3 000 are added
[1:46:55] when peter preaches amen because there's
[1:46:59] power in preaching he didn't play a tape
[1:47:01] he preached
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:03] somebody with me i mean he didn't
[1:47:06] idolize somebody preached the living
[1:47:08] christ
[1:47:09] and what he did 3 000 were added to the
[1:47:12] kingdom right then
[1:47:14] looks of fire 3 000 3120.
[1:47:25] he just kept dividing and satan said i
[1:47:28] don't know what i've done
[1:47:31] because i thought i got rid of jesus by
[1:47:33] crucifying him
[1:47:34] but now i have him now in a hundred and
[1:47:37] twenty bodies three thousand bodies
[1:47:38] three thousand one hundred and twenty
[1:47:40] body
[1:47:40] and it just keeps growing
[1:47:45] and now that jesus is in you
[1:47:50] and satan don't know what to do with you
[1:47:54] come on hallelujah because greater is he
[1:47:57] that is in you
[1:47:58] than he that's in the world
[1:47:59] [Applause]
[1:48:00] [Music]
[1:48:02] hallelujah i don't know about you but
[1:48:04] i'm having fun this morning
[1:48:06] amen because i can see it's christ in
[1:48:09] you
[1:48:09] the hope of glory
[1:48:14] it's not me that liveth paul said it's
[1:48:16] christ that liveth in me
[1:48:18] he'd do it the works jesus said
[1:48:22] see he said i've got a little gift to
[1:48:26] know little things and foresee things
[1:48:28] but that
[1:48:28] makes me just steal your brother i'm no
[1:48:31] messiah i'm not no messiah i'm your
[1:48:34] brother see just a shepherd to the flock
[1:48:36] and
[1:48:36] if i told you i was the messiah i'd be a
[1:48:39] liar see
[1:48:40] and i don't want to be a liar
[1:48:45] can you believe it like i said some
[1:48:47] people that if the devil couldn't get
[1:48:48] some to believe that jesus was not god
[1:48:50] then he got others believing that
[1:48:52] brother branham was god
[1:48:56] one side wants to take the deity away
[1:48:58] from jesus
[1:48:59] and the other was to give it to brother
[1:49:01] branham
[1:49:05] either way it was to strip the glory
[1:49:07] from the messiah
[1:49:11] understand what i'm saying amen now
[1:49:14] in question answers 3 64 brother branham
[1:49:17] said
[1:49:17] are you going to read the question
[1:49:19] brother branham could could jesus
[1:49:21] look like you or you be jesus or
[1:49:23] something like that
[1:49:25] he said one sense of the word that's
[1:49:27] exactly the truth in another sense of
[1:49:29] the word it is an antichrist
[1:49:32] that's the difference between right and
[1:49:34] wrong to make me the person of the lord
[1:49:36] jesus christ would be an antichrist
[1:49:38] for that person of the lord jesus is
[1:49:41] sitting at the right
[1:49:42] hand of the majesty on high and will
[1:49:44] come again in great power and glory
[1:49:47] but for his life that was in him being
[1:49:49] upon me and upon you who have them
[1:49:51] is exactly the truth and you become
[1:49:53] christ you remember my message of
[1:49:55] messiahs
[1:49:56] you are the word messiah means the
[1:49:58] anointed one
[1:50:00] and now you now you are if you have the
[1:50:02] holy spirit
[1:50:03] you become the anointed one
[1:50:06] do you have the holy ghost you're the
[1:50:09] anointed one
[1:50:10] do you have the holy ghost you're the
[1:50:12] anointed one
[1:50:13] do you have the holy ghost you're the
[1:50:15] anointed one
[1:50:18] are you with me amen if you have the
[1:50:20] holy ghost you become the anointed one
[1:50:22] that then there's all
[1:50:24] kinds of the anointed ones
[1:50:29] there's anointed ones and housewives
[1:50:32] there's anointed ones and mothers
[1:50:36] come on they lay hands upon their child
[1:50:39] rebuke the fever do it right now
[1:50:42] amen in your family in your home come on
[1:50:45] church
[1:50:45] there's anointed one you better there's
[1:50:47] all kinds of anointed ones there's jesus
[1:50:53] and many bodies
[1:50:59] amen and that body is not just an
[1:51:02] evening like tabernacle
[1:51:04] it spreads around the world
[1:51:08] that body can be found in elkton
[1:51:10] virginia
[1:51:11] in johnson city tennessee in cloverdale
[1:51:15] over in south africa down in the end
[1:51:19] hey you don't even have to belong to
[1:51:20] assembly to in order for it to to be in
[1:51:23] you
[1:51:24] got to belong to jesus somebody help me
[1:51:26] preach amen
[1:51:28] it's him it's him and the body and guess
[1:51:30] what it's not here
[1:51:31] in portion anymore you see what
[1:51:34] methodist only had a portion of him
[1:51:36] because he had a portion of the word
[1:51:38] which with a portion of the spirit that
[1:51:40] came with the word that was given
[1:51:42] a man a greater word came with pentecost
[1:51:44] they had a greater word and a greater
[1:51:46] portion
[1:51:48] amen come on bring it right on down
[1:51:50] right now in this age this time
[1:51:52] now it's not a portion anymore
[1:51:57] hallelujah now the fullness of the
[1:52:00] godhead
[1:52:02] bodily is now dwelling in a body
[1:52:08] you see david parsley had him and moses
[1:52:11] partially had him
[1:52:12] they did great works and did signs and
[1:52:14] wonders elijah had him in poison
[1:52:16] somebody helped me preach
[1:52:18] but when jesus came he was moses elijah
[1:52:20] he was jeremiah
[1:52:22] he was ezekiel he was the wisdom of
[1:52:24] solomon he was the psalms of david
[1:52:26] he was the all in all and the everything
[1:52:29] from a to z
[1:52:30] come on somebody and now jesus
[1:52:33] was the fullness of all of that in one
[1:52:37] body
[1:52:40] but now he didn't promise there would be
[1:52:43] another like that
[1:52:48] never again you see he was god's unique
[1:52:52] son he would put in him
[1:52:55] his fullness all of god
[1:53:00] jesus wasn't god by portion jesus was
[1:53:04] all of god that was in moses jeremiah
[1:53:07] ezekiel and all him that had it
[1:53:09] then now it was now all in him it's
[1:53:12] all in him it's all in him
[1:53:16] the fullness of the godhead is all in
[1:53:19] him
[1:53:20] and i'm not singing you to sleep
[1:53:28] it was in that body but on the day of
[1:53:30] pentecost he did something miraculous
[1:53:33] he poured out it was canosis he
[1:53:37] he he can chinos or poured out
[1:53:41] his spirit he he began to pour out
[1:53:45] his spirit into a body
[1:53:51] but in the last day he empties it
[1:53:56] until the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:53:59] dwells in a bride
[1:54:06] and of his fullness we have received
[1:54:10] grace for grace
[1:54:13] now he said now remember we're not the
[1:54:16] word but we are the word uh-huh you know
[1:54:18] you got it jesus was not god but he was
[1:54:20] god he was a man yet he was god he could
[1:54:22] cry
[1:54:22] yet he could raise the dead he could cry
[1:54:24] for a man being dead and raised him back
[1:54:26] up again he's jehovah jordan jehovah
[1:54:28] alpha
[1:54:28] jehovah manasses he's jehovah all
[1:54:30] completely he was jehovah
[1:54:32] and yet he was a man he owned the earth
[1:54:34] and made the earth and that not a place
[1:54:36] to lay his head he said the birds that i
[1:54:39] that i made has got nests i haven't got
[1:54:41] a place to lay my head the foxes i
[1:54:43] created got holes in the ground
[1:54:44] and i haven't even got one myself even
[1:54:46] to be buried in that's right he had to
[1:54:48] borrow somebody's grave to be buried
[1:54:50] in he created a womb that had that was
[1:54:52] he created a womb that was in a woman he
[1:54:54] had no womb to be born in he had to
[1:54:56] borrow a womb he created the earth he
[1:54:58] had not a place to be buried in
[1:54:59] he had to borrow a hole to be to be
[1:55:01] buried in
[1:55:02] with joseph of armithia they had to
[1:55:04] borrow a place yet he was god
[1:55:06] he proved he was god now you understand
[1:55:09] we are messiahs
[1:55:11] but not that jesus he is our father
[1:55:15] we're just anointed with his spirit
[1:55:17] and that's the reason his life that and
[1:55:19] that gets people if you just don't sit
[1:55:21] and think it through it gets people
[1:55:22] think
[1:55:22] well this guy would be the messiah sure
[1:55:25] he is
[1:55:27] he said this one over here could be they
[1:55:30] both
[1:55:30] are see well how can there be two of
[1:55:34] them there's thousands of them
[1:55:36] but you see his life was separated on
[1:55:38] the day of pentecost and when that
[1:55:40] pillar fire came down
[1:55:41] it separated like tongues and sat upon
[1:55:44] each of them
[1:55:44] god divided himself among his people
[1:55:47] because christ
[1:55:48] and the church in christ is one just
[1:55:51] like husband and wife are one
[1:55:54] and the messiah brother bradham said
[1:55:56] when god was made flesh
[1:55:58] and became messiah then we if we can
[1:56:01] yield ourselves to be anointed like he
[1:56:03] he was we become a messiah
[1:56:06] see brother branham's telling us it
[1:56:08] ain't just one you know they they got
[1:56:10] one guy
[1:56:11] over in south africa you know that they
[1:56:13] have made to be elohim they got another
[1:56:15] in
[1:56:15] england they're made to be the holy
[1:56:17] ghost
[1:56:22] you know they had a one that they buried
[1:56:25] that they
[1:56:25] they made to be michael the archangel
[1:56:31] yeah nonsense you know
[1:56:35] again you know they they you know
[1:56:38] because they were looking for a messiah
[1:56:43] in one man and that's not where the
[1:56:46] messiah is the messiah
[1:56:48] is in a multi-bodied people
[1:56:53] not just in tim pruitt
[1:56:58] amen oh he's the anointed one now oh no
[1:57:01] i'm not
[1:57:02] i am anointed but i'm not that anointed
[1:57:04] one
[1:57:06] amen there's one anointed one and that's
[1:57:08] jesus
[1:57:09] but he's anointed many in this last day
[1:57:13] to show forth his fairness
[1:57:20] and they are the standing light in this
[1:57:23] church age
[1:57:26] and we hadn't we hadn't gone out
[1:57:30] messiah means the anointed one means
[1:57:32] king then if the church is anointed by
[1:57:34] the messiah spirit
[1:57:35] it becomes a lesser but still a messiah
[1:57:38] because it's his light reflecting his
[1:57:40] power reflecting his glory reflecting
[1:57:43] his dominion
[1:57:45] god called us to become kings and
[1:57:46] priests like god
[1:57:49] he made you he made you as a god to be
[1:57:52] like
[1:57:53] adam to have dominion
[1:57:58] if i can leave you with anything that as
[1:58:01] a messiah
[1:58:02] or a messiah you were made to have
[1:58:07] dominion

[1:58:22] made to be
[1:58:27] one who has dominion amen
[1:58:34] you were not made to live in defeat
[1:58:38] you were not made to be defeated by any
[1:58:41] disease
[1:58:43] any problem any situation
[1:58:46] you are a master of all situations
[1:58:50] you say there's a storm brother to him
[1:58:52] you are the master of that storm
[1:58:54] speak to it you say there's a mountain
[1:58:58] in my way i can't get over around or
[1:59:00] through speak to it
[1:59:03] you say there is a there is something
[1:59:05] there
[1:59:06] that is not bearing fruit in my life
[1:59:08] speak to that thing
[1:59:11] you don't have to have it
[1:59:17] brother branham said in the
[1:59:20] easter seal now if he was the messiah
[1:59:23] might be the anointed one for that day
[1:59:25] to fulfill the word of god to be the
[1:59:27] redeemer and the anointed one
[1:59:28] and god raised up that body his bride is
[1:59:32] the anointed one for
[1:59:33] this day and is the rising of the sun
[1:59:37] he's alive forevermore the same
[1:59:39] yesterday today and forever
[1:59:40] hebrews 13 8 notice messiah
[1:59:43] the anointed one so is his bride the
[1:59:45] messiah
[1:59:46] the anointed one
[1:59:49] amen the choosing of the bride he said
[1:59:53] god's spirit is on his word
[1:59:55] the messianic the anointed word the
[1:59:57] bride must be the messiah
[1:59:59] the anointed word not just the word
[2:00:02] the anointed one
[2:00:06] people are calling the word word word
[2:00:08] word said it's the word and the word
[2:00:10] only well what's in the word
[2:00:14] there's healing in the word there's
[2:00:16] power in the word there's salvation in
[2:00:18] the word there's dynamics in the word
[2:00:20] it's always there in the word the word
[2:00:22] is a person not a book
[2:00:24] not a theology not a learning not that i
[2:00:27] can pass on
[2:00:28] is a person you receive and you get that
[2:00:30] word on the inside of you
[2:00:31] you got dunamis dynamite power on the
[2:00:34] inside of you
[2:00:39] and god made you to have dominion
[2:00:41] [Applause]
[2:00:42] because you're a messiah
[2:00:46] how often did brother branham say if i
[2:00:48] had the spirit of bethover in me i'd
[2:00:50] write music
[2:00:51] if i had the spirit of john dillinger
[2:00:53] and me i'd kill and rob
[2:00:55] but he said if i have the spirit of
[2:00:57] christ i'm going to do the works of
[2:00:58] christ
[2:01:00] [Applause]
[2:01:03] and paul said if you don't have the
[2:01:05] spirit of christ you're none of his
[2:01:12] before the fall adam was a man with
[2:01:14] dominion
[2:01:16] he operated in a realm of faith
[2:01:19] he had he had a body whereby he could
[2:01:22] contact the earth
[2:01:24] see taste smell filling here but he had
[2:01:27] an inward spirit that contacted
[2:01:29] the heavenly realm and he brought heaven
[2:01:31] down to earth
[2:01:33] what made eden the eden it was
[2:01:37] adam he kept everything in order
[2:01:45] i'm talking to some people right now
[2:01:48] who are the same messiahs
[2:01:51] that adam was in the beginning
[2:01:58] the messiah
[2:02:02] brother branham said if he gets back to
[2:02:04] god he's a messiah the little messiah
[2:02:06] if messiah means anointed one and you're
[2:02:09] anointed then what are you that's
[2:02:10] exactly right a messiah
[2:02:13] go wake jesus he would say this they
[2:02:16] should have known these disciples that
[2:02:17] he was the messiah and the word
[2:02:19] messiah means the anointed one he had
[2:02:22] all
[2:02:23] god in him god was in him jesus the son
[2:02:26] said i do nothing in myself but i when i
[2:02:28] see my father do it
[2:02:29] the father dwelleth in me see he too had
[2:02:33] a body
[2:02:34] that could die that could feel that
[2:02:36] could touch
[2:02:37] come on and even now
[2:02:41] he's got a body that can feel your
[2:02:44] infirmities
[2:02:47] because the bible said he could be
[2:02:49] touched
[2:02:52] you come and tell me about your troubles
[2:02:55] i'm
[2:02:55] touched by the feeling
[2:02:59] of your infirmity i'm touched
[2:03:06] i get reports every day from brother ron
[2:03:09] spencer and every day i'm touched
[2:03:14] but jesus is touched
[2:03:18] amen come on jesus is touched
[2:03:22] but he's really waiting for the jesus
[2:03:24] inside of you to get touched
[2:03:27] get awakened well you're just not
[2:03:30] feeling with sympathy for somebody
[2:03:33] come out now but where did you move in
[2:03:37] that dimension
[2:03:38] amen oh brother branham would often say
[2:03:41] yeah i've got to feel
[2:03:42] how they're feeling i've got to go in
[2:03:44] there i got to get
[2:03:46] into his spirit and feel how he's
[2:03:48] feeling
[2:03:52] because only when you love somebody
[2:03:56] only when you have feelings for somebody
[2:04:01] there's a spirit in you that has to be
[2:04:04] stirred
[2:04:05] awakened brought forth
[2:04:10] just brought to the forefront i know we
[2:04:13] don't
[2:04:13] like to think of it being asleep i i i
[2:04:16] mean
[2:04:16] brought to the forefront
[2:04:20] jesus was literally asleep in the boat
[2:04:23] but he had to be brought
[2:04:24] to the forefront i'm saying to the
[2:04:28] church today
[2:04:29] you know there's a jesus in this church
[2:04:31] but he's got to be brought to the
[2:04:33] forefront
[2:04:34] where this is more than a society of a
[2:04:36] church this is
[2:04:38] more than just membership this is more
[2:04:40] than just
[2:04:41] church attendance but jesus is brought
[2:04:44] to the forefront
[2:04:47] recognized and begins to operate in the
[2:04:50] spirit
[2:04:58] brother branham said
[2:05:02] with that messiah he was messiah by that
[2:05:05] with that anointing made him
[2:05:07] fully messiah my father dwells in me
[2:05:11] we with the same spirit was upon him not
[2:05:13] important but the same in quality
[2:05:16] with a portion upon us would make us
[2:05:19] like messiahs
[2:05:22] brother brandon said that portion is
[2:05:24] omnipotent
[2:05:26] it's got the power to speak a world and
[2:05:29] go live on it
[2:05:33] we know because it did we're living on
[2:05:36] the world he spoke
[2:05:38] into existence i'm talking about the one
[2:05:40] in you
[2:05:43] come on amen i'm talking about what you
[2:05:46] have been born of
[2:05:48] in the spirit who you are as a messiah
[2:05:54] and he says we with the same spirit upon
[2:05:56] him not important
[2:05:57] same in quality see same same everything
[2:06:01] he's omnipotent all powerful
[2:06:05] there's no big i always liked it there's
[2:06:08] a young preacher here and brother
[2:06:09] bradley would say
[2:06:10] there's no big spots in god no little
[2:06:13] weak spots in god
[2:06:14] the very little touch of god is
[2:06:16] omnipotent
[2:06:20] then i say let that god speak
[2:06:23] let that one act out of my life amen let
[2:06:26] that one move out i mean it was so real
[2:06:28] to peter he said seven gold i don't have
[2:06:30] but i got something
[2:06:32] in the name of jesus christ rise up and
[2:06:34] walk
[2:06:39] he says
[2:06:42] with that portion of bonus would make us
[2:06:45] like
[2:06:45] messiahs would be little sons of god
[2:06:48] adopted sons of god
[2:06:49] his holy spirit is sealed us in his body
[2:06:52] and we're as children
[2:06:54] there should be nothing bothers nothing
[2:06:56] worry us where he is
[2:06:58] if it ain't well we're false witnesses
[2:07:00] we've been testifying as something
[2:07:02] that's not even so i believe it i
[2:07:05] believe that right now we are the sons
[2:07:07] of god not we will be but right now and
[2:07:09] now we're seated together
[2:07:10] in heavenly places in christ
[2:07:15] i know you're getting tired
[2:07:20] but i want you to know we're at an end
[2:07:24] time
[2:07:31] and noah in his end time could look
[2:07:33] around and he could see the sons of cain
[2:07:37] and the wickedness that was going
[2:07:40] in the land because of the sons of cain
[2:07:45] and that's what you're seeing again the
[2:07:48] sons of cain
[2:07:52] see it didn't make it over the ark oh
[2:07:53] yes it did
[2:07:57] because the bible said they all married
[2:08:00] wives such as they chose
[2:08:03] and even right down to noah's sons
[2:08:06] maybe even know his wife
[2:08:13] but nevertheless even though we may not
[2:08:16] be able to see
[2:08:17] the physical aspects in the sense of
[2:08:19] features or this or that
[2:08:21] we can see a a bunch of people
[2:08:25] masses without life
[2:08:30] dead staring their face killers
[2:08:34] murders the spirit of the beast taken
[2:08:37] over
[2:08:39] they've given their mind to the beast
[2:08:52] you know just reading in california they
[2:08:55] you know they
[2:08:55] they just the gop that's the
[2:08:58] conservative bunch just
[2:08:59] just supported and nominated some some
[2:09:03] um
[2:09:04] rat you know it's a he's transgender
[2:09:07] and and and and um you know with it with
[2:09:10] long hair this
[2:09:12] multi rainbow colors and you know there
[2:09:15] and and and he says i'm an anarchist and
[2:09:18] i hate god and and i and
[2:09:21] and i hate the values of this country
[2:09:23] and they and they support him
[2:09:30] how can we do that without their minds
[2:09:32] turning
[2:09:34] their hearts on evil continually
[2:09:38] and we're look we're standing here and
[2:09:40] saying today we are
[2:09:41] people who have an ark and god
[2:09:44] told us to get in it
[2:09:48] and it's been built through the word and
[2:09:50] the only way out of here is through
[2:09:52] jesus christ
[2:09:53] he's the door and we see the
[2:09:56] supernatural happening
[2:09:58] and the people in that day they can look
[2:10:00] around and see the supernatural
[2:10:02] they can see animals coming in do you
[2:10:04] realize an eden condition
[2:10:06] all of a sudden started happening
[2:10:10] with lions and tigers and giraffes and
[2:10:14] rhinos gorillas and
[2:10:18] monkeys and deer and
[2:10:22] antelope all kinds
[2:10:27] under eden condition started coming
[2:10:30] in the anointing started coming on
[2:10:34] them and moved them into
[2:10:39] the ark
[2:10:42] no it didn't gather them there was an
[2:10:45] anointing gathered
[2:10:51] finally god said go in the ark
[2:10:56] the family got in the door shut
[2:11:00] you see noah was the anointed one
[2:11:04] of that day but how it flew in the face
[2:11:07] of everybody else
[2:11:09] you mean you're the only one that god's
[2:11:11] going to save you and jehovah is this
[2:11:13] kind of a mean of god
[2:11:15] he's such a mean god he's going to
[2:11:16] destroy everybody and kill little
[2:11:18] children
[2:11:18] and innocent women and people because
[2:11:20] they don't believe in your god
[2:11:26] and he sends a sign and a message
[2:11:31] and you in this last day are a sign and
[2:11:33] a message he said well it bothers me
[2:11:39] brother tim
[2:11:39] i mean you know we're stigma we walked
[2:11:41] down and yeah i
[2:11:43] i know i looked and i was in town the
[2:11:46] other day and i looked and i saw
[2:11:47] a lady and i said that looks like one of
[2:11:50] ours
[2:11:53] why is that
[2:11:57] because you're a sign
[2:12:00] your long hair is a sign you're obedient
[2:12:02] to god's word
[2:12:05] you put his word above styles what
[2:12:08] everybody else thinks
[2:12:10] what makes you look smart
[2:12:13] you put his word ahead you put his word
[2:12:17] ahead of makeup
[2:12:22] come on you don't have to be persuaded
[2:12:24] there's an anointing
[2:12:26] you don't have to have a preacher bully
[2:12:27] club you over the head to get you to do
[2:12:29] right there's an anointing
[2:12:31] you move right into the ark because
[2:12:34] you're anointed
[2:12:35] you move right in because the holy
[2:12:37] spirit is upon you
[2:12:40] and he has anointed you to preach and
[2:12:42] everywhere you're going you're preaching
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:47] come on hey man my wife you know
[2:12:50] when when we when we we were out among
[2:12:54] some people the other day out in
[2:12:55] in public and there she she's wearing
[2:12:58] her hat
[2:12:59] and she's wearing god bless them bill
[2:13:01] and johnny mayo sent us some beautiful
[2:13:03] little treasures and
[2:13:04] one of them there that we love so much
[2:13:07] is uh is a little face mask
[2:13:09] that says god god's miracle
[2:13:15] oh she could walk out with her hair
[2:13:18] looking like half of the other women
[2:13:21] that we saw
[2:13:24] she could fit right in with all of them
[2:13:27] but she put her hat on and covered her
[2:13:29] head and said god's miracle
[2:13:35] and i want you to know you're assigned
[2:13:37] to the world you are god's miracle
[2:13:41] because there's been a transformation
[2:13:43] take place in you
[2:13:45] and change you from death into life and
[2:13:47] made a messiah
[2:13:48] out of you where that you can go and
[2:13:50] display the power of jesus christ
[2:13:52] and you can give a warning to the rest
[2:13:54] of the world you better get in the ark
[2:13:56] jesus christ
[2:14:02] so brother tim he's not our type well he
[2:14:04] is a type of the foolish virgin but he's
[2:14:05] also a type of us
[2:14:08] because there's three layers of that ark
[2:14:13] and that wood was a certain wood
[2:14:16] it was a porous wood that had to be
[2:14:19] filled with the life of another tree
[2:14:23] and god cut down a tree at calvary
[2:14:25] somebody help me preach right now
[2:14:27] amen and emptied out the pitch of that
[2:14:29] life
[2:14:31] amen of that tree come on amen i made
[2:14:35] that pitch
[2:14:37] to put in poorest humanity because you
[2:14:40] were made to be filled
[2:14:42] with the spirit of god amen and you know
[2:14:45] what that will do
[2:14:45] it will mean it will impregnate you and
[2:14:49] make you so feel till you are
[2:14:52] you are actually safe from
[2:14:55] the judgment waters
[2:14:59] but not only did he do that but he did
[2:15:01] three stories of it
[2:15:03] justification and sanctification and
[2:15:05] baptism of the holy ghost and there's
[2:15:08] only one window out which you can see
[2:15:10] god and that's when you get the baptism
[2:15:12] of the holy ghost
[2:15:13] and that's when you can start looking up
[2:15:15] because this is where he made him
[2:15:17] i don't want you looking out here
[2:15:21] come on i want you looking up here
[2:15:26] and that's what god does he makes us
[2:15:29] righteous like himself
[2:15:32] and makes us his messiahs i would like
[2:15:36] to read the scripture and then we're
[2:15:37] going to close
[2:15:41] romans chapter 8 verse 29 we all know it
[2:15:52] for whom he did for no
[2:15:55] he also did determine their destiny
[2:16:03] for them he knew before
[2:16:06] before the foundational world he also
[2:16:09] determined
[2:16:10] their destiny
[2:16:13] he predestinated and to be con oh wait a
[2:16:16] minute
[2:16:17] what is our destiny to be conformed
[2:16:23] to what sports stars
[2:16:26] movie stars
[2:16:30] all these pop stars and
[2:16:34] rock stars and the more stars and the
[2:16:36] fallen stars
[2:16:39] whom he did for no he predestinated you
[2:16:42] he set your destiny to be conformed
[2:16:46] to the image of his son
[2:16:50] in other words he set your destiny to be
[2:16:52] like jesus
[2:16:54] amen to be filled with jesus from the
[2:16:57] inside out
[2:16:58] amen that why that he might
[2:17:02] be the firstborn
[2:17:06] among many brethren
[2:17:10] it's not gonna just be me i'm gonna have
[2:17:13] many brothers hallelujah
[2:17:16] i'm talking to you brothers of the
[2:17:18] messiah
[2:17:21] hallelujah sisters of the messiah
[2:17:24] amen morning stars maybe
[2:17:27] stars it can't be put out that can't
[2:17:30] fade away
[2:17:31] that's announcing there's a great
[2:17:33] messiah coming
[2:17:35] there's a day coming that's the daylight
[2:17:38] is coming and we are the morning stars
[2:17:40] announcing his coming
[2:17:41] [Applause]
[2:17:43] and you think we're going to fade away
[2:17:45] we had lost a bit of our glimmer
[2:17:47] we had lost a bit of our shout we are
[2:17:50] we shattered with him before the
[2:17:52] foundational world
[2:17:54] and we're right here in time doing what
[2:17:56] we did in eternity
[2:18:00] because why he wanted to be the
[2:18:03] firstborn i'm going to be the firstborn
[2:18:10] and to do this i'm going to be human
[2:18:13] and i'm going to take on a unique body
[2:18:16] because i can't come in sex-born body
[2:18:19] because then i would be
[2:18:20] under the condemnation of the devil
[2:18:24] i would be born like like like
[2:18:28] the serpent taught eve
[2:18:33] so i'm going to be born in a spoken word
[2:18:37] body
[2:18:39] just like the first man was
[2:18:43] and i'm going to form it in the earth
[2:18:48] in a womb
[2:18:52] and i'm going to add to it from the
[2:18:54] carrots
[2:18:55] and the cabbage and the vegetables i'm
[2:18:58] going to add to it
[2:19:00] cell upon cell
[2:19:03] and it's going to be a human body
[2:19:08] but then i'm going to fill it with my
[2:19:10] fullness
[2:19:13] so that the father dwells in me
[2:19:16] in other words the one who created the
[2:19:18] body dwells in the body he created
[2:19:21] it's not that it's not that hard to
[2:19:24] understand
[2:19:25] he was a father in that he conceived a
[2:19:29] son
[2:19:30] but that son he stepped into
[2:19:37] and there's not two of them there's only
[2:19:39] one
[2:19:41] and jesus the son couldn't be his own
[2:19:44] father
[2:19:45] but the father could be the son
[2:19:49] and so god stepped into it for the
[2:19:52] purpose of redemption
[2:19:54] to feel your pain to feel your sorrows
[2:19:58] to go through life as you do
[2:20:02] it's a body satan had no claim on
[2:20:07] hallelujah amen because why
[2:20:10] when he was born he was born as emmanuel
[2:20:14] it would be god with us he goes to river
[2:20:17] jordan
[2:20:17] he brings that body
[2:20:21] he brings that body
[2:20:26] to be filled with the spirit
[2:20:29] and that's what you got to do that's
[2:20:32] what we call repentance and being
[2:20:34] baptized
[2:20:35] is where you bring your body
[2:20:38] to be filled with his own spirit
[2:20:43] so it wouldn't be you trying to live the
[2:20:46] message
[2:20:46] no more and you find it so hard to do
[2:20:52] why do i have to do this and why do i
[2:20:54] have to do that it won't be hard
[2:20:57] if you get jesus in you because really
[2:21:01] only jesus can live the christian life
[2:21:07] and if you get jesus in you it's not
[2:21:09] hard anymore
[2:21:11] because why you do what jesus does
[2:21:14] you think like jesus thinks you act like
[2:21:17] jesus
[2:21:18] acts you believe like jesus believes
[2:21:24] amen
[2:21:26] oh that he might be the firstborn
[2:21:30] among many brethren i wasn't quite
[2:21:31] through with that
[2:21:34] moreover hey this ain't all of it
[2:21:38] whom he did predestinate
[2:21:46] he called you remember when he called
[2:21:49] you
[2:21:51] amen he don't leave them out there he
[2:21:52] calls them
[2:21:55] whom he did predestinate them he also
[2:21:57] called
[2:22:00] that in all of it and then that he
[2:22:02] called
[2:22:03] what'd he do he justified
[2:22:07] he declared them righteous he purged
[2:22:10] them by his blood
[2:22:12] and where he could not dwell in moses
[2:22:15] and elijah and all them but just anoint
[2:22:17] them
[2:22:17] somebody help me but he come in christ
[2:22:21] a spoken word body now then here by his
[2:22:24] blood
[2:22:25] he can redeemed so he could come in
[2:22:27] sexual born
[2:22:28] bodies and those sexual born bodies
[2:22:32] could be filled with deity
[2:22:36] that god oh hallelujah now make what the
[2:22:40] serpent did
[2:22:41] act way that god wants him to
[2:22:45] amen because every one of us was born in
[2:22:48] sin
[2:22:48] and shaped in iniquity and we came the
[2:22:51] way
[2:22:51] of the curse somebody help me preach but
[2:22:54] i want you to know
[2:22:55] that that body that satan entered into
[2:22:58] with adam
[2:22:59] when he yielded up the immortal spirit
[2:23:02] and took their immortality
[2:23:05] are you with me and now sin enters in
[2:23:08] him
[2:23:09] and now he does what satan
[2:23:13] wants
[2:23:17] his hands to what satan wants
[2:23:21] his eyes to seize what satan wants
[2:23:25] his feet goes where the serpent wants
[2:23:30] him
[2:23:33] and that's the condition you were born
[2:23:35] in
[2:23:37] by your first birth that's why your
[2:23:40] members the bible said your members you
[2:23:43] yielded your
[2:23:44] members to sin
[2:23:47] smoking drinking lying
[2:23:52] cursing vulgarity
[2:23:55] pornography sex sins
[2:23:58] every kind of horrible thing you
[2:24:01] did them we did them
[2:24:07] come on amen but god
[2:24:12] who is rich in mercy
[2:24:15] amen he called you he said come unto me
[2:24:19] there's a deposit in you i knew you
[2:24:22] before the foundation war before satan
[2:24:24] got to you
[2:24:25] i knew you before oh my before you ever
[2:24:28] did one sin
[2:24:29] you were mine come on come on
[2:24:32] then be called what did he do he
[2:24:34] justified
[2:24:35] what does justified me he made you as
[2:24:38] though you never did it
[2:24:39] your sins were washed away you stand
[2:24:42] there pure
[2:24:43] unadulterated the son or daughters of
[2:24:46] god
[2:24:48] justified and then he justified
[2:24:53] he also glorified
[2:24:58] we've already been seen in glorified
[2:25:00] bodies
[2:25:02] that's a great way to look at it he made
[2:25:05] us righteous like himself
[2:25:07] and them that he made righteous
[2:25:10] he made messiahettes because he cannot
[2:25:14] come into a being that satan still lives
[2:25:18] in
[2:25:23] are you with me that's why salvation
[2:25:27] is the casting out of satan
[2:25:31] that's why we believe in the miracle of
[2:25:33] salvation
[2:25:34] that's why i can believe in casting out
[2:25:36] any devil
[2:25:40] because it happened to me
[2:25:44] then he made righteous like himself then
[2:25:47] he made
[2:25:48] messiahs let me go back over there he
[2:25:51] could not
[2:25:52] come into bodies until he
[2:25:56] made a body he could come and dwell in
[2:26:00] stop and think when it came down to
[2:26:02] abraham what did he do he gathered up
[2:26:04] the elements
[2:26:05] and stepped into a body
[2:26:09] and appeared to abraham he called him
[2:26:10] lord he recognized him
[2:26:12] as lord come on it was god dwelling in
[2:26:15] the body
[2:26:16] he steps out the body vanishes and he
[2:26:18] vanishes
[2:26:20] he still goes the body went back to the
[2:26:22] elements
[2:26:25] why didn't why didn't he take a man uh
[2:26:29] let's say job lived in that time why
[2:26:30] didn't he take job and say
[2:26:32] okay i'm going to step into job and i'm
[2:26:35] going to perform the sign of the son of
[2:26:37] man and i'm
[2:26:38] he couldn't do it job his body
[2:26:42] wasn't redeemed
[2:26:49] and god couldn't dwell in that kind of
[2:26:52] vessel
[2:26:54] somebody helped me
[2:26:57] now then coming on down so he would have
[2:27:00] to make bodies for him to don't come in
[2:27:03] and appear and he would he'd do the same
[2:27:05] thing in in the fiery furnace and
[2:27:06] anywhere that he made himself tangible
[2:27:08] or visible
[2:27:11] somebody with me now now let's come on a
[2:27:13] little bit further on this
[2:27:15] now then but finally it comes to jesus
[2:27:18] and jesus will be god's unique his one
[2:27:22] and only son
[2:27:25] amen and god will create a body
[2:27:31] that he can come live in and at the
[2:27:34] river of jordan the fullness of the
[2:27:36] spirit of god comes and dwells
[2:27:38] in jesus christ and he says it's not me
[2:27:42] the human that does the work but my
[2:27:44] father that
[2:27:45] lives in me in me dwells
[2:27:49] the messiah and he does this work
[2:27:55] but then what happened he took his body
[2:27:59] and his body became the sacrifice for
[2:28:01] your sin
[2:28:03] the perpetuation to cleanse you
[2:28:06] to provide a blood that god would
[2:28:10] take and cleanse you so cleanse you till
[2:28:13] he could come and dwell in a sexual-born
[2:28:17] body
[2:28:20] hallelujah wipe all your past
[2:28:24] cleanse all your buy a greater blood
[2:28:27] than bulls and goats
[2:28:29] somebody help me amen this is what he
[2:28:31] would do he would do this when god now
[2:28:34] steps into sexual born bodies
[2:28:37] to make them a messiah
[2:28:40] men and women filled with the spirit men
[2:28:43] and women who have an evil past
[2:28:46] that the world knows oh that man oh that
[2:28:49] woman
[2:28:49] you know he comes and he says you did
[2:28:51] this you did not and god said
[2:28:54] they're not guilty i washed them
[2:28:58] i justified them i made them righteous
[2:29:01] and i'm dwelling in there and it's not
[2:29:03] the old man anymore
[2:29:04] it's christ now living in
[2:29:08] for them he did foreknow then he also
[2:29:11] did pre-destiny
[2:29:13] to be conformed to the image of his son
