country wherever you are God knows knows exactly your situation he's there to minister to your need today because he's God a man as his father talked to him just a moment Lord this song means so much to us he's one of the songs of victory for this hour that you've anointed for this time to let us know Lord that you are light in the time of darkness when it gets so dark we can't see our hand in front of our face and we know there is someone present who can turn on the light who will rapture the church we're are people Lord of a rapture age of adoption aids of a time of people that know their God and who will do exploits we're looking to you Lord today because you're the Almighty God you're the one that we trust in with all our hearts Lord we stand there Lord with all our hearts today believe in the word looking at the promise proclaiming it is the truth and it is our acre it is our anchor that holds within the veil Lord we pray in today now that you would bless us as we look in the world together at you and anoint us for this time and this purpose we believe that we are the anointed of this hour we believe the Bride of Christ is anointed to fulfill the New Testament even as you fulfilled the Old Testament in every type and never shadow to the scripture it is now being made manifest in this day in this hour in this time and we're asking for healing and deliverance for your children where else you know God the healing angel the Holy Spirit would just go through the land sweeping over every person every home Vince turn every place reassuring every life moving down into the ICU rooms and in the hospital Lourdes air or God in the in the little places where their families are gathered maybe their sickness there maybe the enemy has come in and tried to to put a death notice upon them but Lord may they know that today that there is an answer on the way that you are here appearing in our midst and you are the waymaker and you will do miracles for your healer I deliver our Savior my god her father her father you the source of our life today we position ourselves as a son of God we stand here with our shoulders squared back our head held high Lord the banner of the flag Oh God that is what we're sweeping and it's not a flag of surrender it is a flag of victory it is saying he is risen and because He is risen because he lives we live our self we're declaring the it is finished and the word is true and will stand upon that solid rock today as we look into your word blessing to our hearts we ask in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord today and wherever you're gathered today I hope that you have dedicated that for the house of the Lord for you where you're out just - I know I know it's um you know it's a little different but if you'll just get in the atmosphere of worship today and just to realize that the Lord is present with us little surprised that I would be here today and I want to thank brother Timothy for allowing me to minister today I don't say that really tongue-in-cheek I say that because he was prepared to speak and as I got up this morning I I just felt you know that I would just come and address you and speak to you today and especially to all our loved ones and friends everywhere around the world I want to thank you for your prayers as sister Karen continues to improve her eyesight is even better today her headaches are minimal and maybe that she can come home tomorrow if not today I'm still expecting a call from them two days as they just just come get her amen so we're just looking to the Lord for wonderful wonderful things that he is doing in her miss for those of you that don't know I guess it was Friday that I took sister Karen into the hospital they did a the cat scan because she was having some difficulties with with her eyesight they found that she's had another brain bleed in the same area that she had last time five years ago and you know that they can't explain why that it has happened they they just say is very rare for it to happen in the same place twice and so they call it idiopathic in that they don't know how to explain the phenomena that's going on I just call it an attack of the devil and so we know we are attacked by Satan but I know this when Joe heard all the news that he had received he fell on his face and worship God and I don't know what the devil's thinks what kind of response he's gonna get from us but he'll only get us to worship God amen because we will not we will not back down on a word of promise I want you to know as a church group I appreciate your prayers your love your support many texts the encouragement that we receive and my wife and I both appreciate that all the family I received from a brother from I think he's from South African and he wrote me a note and said I may just underscore that your ministry attracts a lot of trouble but man that attracts the Living God even lower and leaves us so encouraged so you know you know when you go to preaching faith and the promises of God and you start to proclaiming the truth of the word and that is for us today of course Satan he comes there and wants to attack and try to prove that wrong but I'll tell you it just attracts the Living God the even more a man and he causes us to have a more of a resolve a mountain and a moral reason to stand in the hour that we're at you know not pondered his statement and I found it very interesting that he said your ministry attracts a lot of trouble but because just yesterday brother Philip Roncalli um he asked me brother Tim what did you do to make the devil's a man and I said well I don't know for sure but if I knew I'd do it again a mountain so you know today as we say that the reason for it is because I know when the enemy comes in you know then like a flood the Spirit of God will raise up a standard against him you can't touch God's anointed this is a this is something that you must remember as the anointed of God because this is not just the preachers odious to preachers but it is to all of you touch not mine anointed do my prophets no harm but I rebuke Kings for their sake man and I know that Satan views itself as the god of this world but you know the Lord rebuke you Satan amen because you've touched God's anointed and that there was ever a time for faith you know I think it's now it's time to stand and believe you know the world around us today is is considering all the satanic attacks that has attacked all through the world they call it a virus but it's a demon that has gone through and then we hear of cancer attacks that are on the increase I've never heard of such a thing at such a time you know there there are attacks on the ministry that have been is you ever heard of brother Jewell who continues to recover today and the attack on brother Ron Spencer ingredients to them and their family who are listening in today and you know their little sister Shalom we have mentioned down in the Indian sister Cynthia Parker who's been 10 years without symptoms and now has reoccur and breast cancer the Massengale from their mom from there in Alabama who have pleaded with us to pray for them brother Nathan Bryant's mother minister there in in Jeffersonville area there that his mother's sister Dottie Bryant has has it just been found a cancer throughout and then brother Nathan bride's brother his brother Alan his mother-in-law - you know isn't this would be his mother and his mother-in-law also has has been stricken down with cancer and it's very very severe we hear of it happening you know where you know all over the country different ministers have wrote me on the behalf of their congregation and um but I want to remind the devil I want to remind the devil that cancer is one of the things that the angel of God specified nothing would stand before the believers prayer not even cancer and so we believe that today and we testify that it is the truth and we stand on that word of promise and I would like to turn to Hebrews 11 verse 1 and I would want to speak this morning on faith is the substance we're having just a little issues we have a storm here the other night and knocked out part of our equipment so some of some of our equipment is not working but that too will pass and Satan cannot stop us amen but the Word of God is true and we appreciate knowing that is is true Hebrews 11 and verse 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear verse 6 but without faith it is impossible for to please him well he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of the that diligently seek Him amen gonna let you be seated if you will let me look at Isaiah 53 and verse 1 I don't have it in my notes but we're also going to refer to in in Romans here in a moment but isaiah 53:1 said who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed I wanted to stop for a moment and remind you that the armor of the lord or the arm of power is revealed to those who believe his report so bear that in mind as we're preaching today that if you want to see the arm of the lord or the hand of god working on your behalf then it will be revealed upon believing his report all right and of course it goes on we won't read it but you know it says he was wounded for your transgressions bruised for your iniquities and by His stripes you were healed and so and so again knowing this scripture is true that is the report he has been wounded for your transgressions he has been taken the weapons you deserved he has paid in full the price for your Redemption so that with the stripes that he took you were healed now Romans 10 16 and we'll use the the second portion of that which Paul is quoting as is for Isaiah said Lord who hath believed our report and then he says verse 17 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God so now we see this is all emphatically connected that faith comes by believing the report we hear God's report we believe that report when we hear it that's how faith comes we know that God cannot lie now of course we're in a great time of battle this is the endtime plan as I have been speaking it's a time that Michael shall stand up on the behalf of the children of thy people and there will be a great resurrection this is spoke to the Jews it is also at that very time in Revelation chapter 12 that that Michael um you know comes and wars against Lucifer and his angels and brother branham tells us that it's at that point in Revelation 12 that the bride goes up so it is in a great time of great trouble it is at a time of great battle and it is a time it is a time of battle that you can expect Michael to stand up on your behalf and upon the bride's behalf I preached the last time I was here was Easter Sunday and I'm ministered and and and as I ministered then I was telling you again about it's Easter his resurrection time it is time of course for Michael to stand up it's time that the angels return and I want you to remember this as we look into this we have had the angel of God in this day appeared to a prophet of God commissioned him tell him him he was to be a forerunner for the coming word or a message that and and that message is Christ and brother branham actually says this in spoken word is original seed he said that that is John the Baptist pointed to Jesus Christ the Lamb said behold the lamb of God so would this messenger do the same by by pointing to you know the word born bride and and so God is here manifests himself in in his word in this day and hour and we're in a very great battle and so as we look at this never be afraid or never be never think rather that you're not gonna have a battle we are in a battle and we're gonna have a battle and this battle will continue until we step out of this dimension into that heavenly dimension from this mortal into immortality now when when brother Branham said when even as he had the very filling of God's word in her hand she could have took the word but he said instead of tarry him for the baptism of the Holy Ghost she's let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples and his tender keeping divine healing going when she ought to be now raising the dead and doing great miracles she's let Satan under his leadership of religious men take the Word of God and try to say is for another age and she's believed it and this has been happen and very subtly even in the message ranks because too often we are pointing back and you saying you know it was for another time it was when miracles were happening in science and that was only to vindicate the word and the word is more important than miracles let me tell you any time doctrine comes it must be accompanied by miracles Amen Jesus doctrine was different from that of the Pharisees and if we're gonna have anything different from that of denominationalism then we're gonna have to have a gospel that works and understand that you know Jesus doctrine was different in that Jesus doctrine um you know was was accompanied by signs and wonders and there was enough party that went with the word and and if this message does not have signs and wonders with it even today then it is just a worthless bunch of theology that will do nothing to change a life and so we don't want to turn it into a powerless group of people whose only weapon is argument give us a better argument than their ages before this is not a time for just having an argument we must have a life and some brother madam went on to say in this quote from God of this evil age that I was just reading he said when the Bible said the things that I do shall you do also jesus said go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature and we're still creatures and these signs will follow every one of them that believe and she denies every bit of it she denies all the supernatural and she swapped it for is intellectual conception of the Bible were priests and holy fathers and so-called we're bishops and archbishops and we're district respirators and gentle overseers and so forth has put their own interpretation there to it and God has left them sit there dead as 12 o'clock now you know I just want to say that we though are people of faith our hearts have been turned back to fake that was the purpose of the message it was to initiate the coming of the Lord Jesus and of course it would come in and there would be phases of that coming as it would come from word a message of them from that message to flesh in a bride of people and get that people ready or they are manifesting that word a mature elect lady and then finally materialized into the literal return of Jesus Christ where we will meet him in the air now and so because of this we are people of faith we've heard some wonderful sermons of faith and encouragement that has been preached here oblate we've heard sermons from brother Joe Adams on he's able to do exceeding abundantly according to the power that works within you remember he can only do it according to the power that works within you the Holy Ghost is gonna be in the church it's gotta be in you Amen we've heard from brother Timothy no grace a great encouragement that we we have heard Wednesday night was of course another masterpiece that we heard and we also heard brother Haran sermons from last Sunday of hold the line you know and and just let me say it was more than any history lesson it was a great word just for us to hold our position in this hour but you know we must be in the right position because no army no general no matter how great the army is can hold a position unless it's the right position and so you know we we can have all the professions of faith but faith must find a position it's not as something that's aimlessly wandering around and and floating from here to there but it must have a resting place it must have a firm foundation and its position it must have its position on the Word of God let me tell you feelings will cave symptoms would change minute by minute but God's Word never changes a man and so brother Branham talked about the great contest that we are going through and said you know I want to speak quickly upon the greatest contest that there is between the church and Satan this great strength of Satan and we want to speak of the great strength of God in his church now this great contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven Satan was kicked out into the earth then he become the enemy of good an enemy of God's people since then he's used all his strength and his strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires into his fires and he said we and we know who as the most power God does and God when he gave his people the best thing he could compat Satan with was his word and now because the word is God and who is stronger than God so the word is God and the word becomes our strength God in the church becomes its strength on to pull Satan to his own fires that he has made how many would like to pull Satan into his own fires and man that's a very the very noose that he has made for us to hang us on amen that Haman will be hung on in all his children hey man so you know the strength to pull Satan into his own fires you know again that there's got to be a strength in the church to cast Satan down from that heavenly position where he tries to hold the believers at because he doesn't belong in the heavens but he's there because of man's fall and so because of man's fall that Adam subjected his self to to Satan and so Satan become the Prince of the power of the air and there he stands there in the heavenly places as the accuser of the Brethren trying to keep us out of God's word of promise and our position as believers but you see this is where the battle begins it's a battle for heavenly places and and so we we have been told all right you don't gird yourself put on the helmet of salvation put your your killer shoes own as brother Timothy preached one time and you shield of faith and your sword and get ready to fight because you're gonna have to fight for your position to hold your position and brother Aaron was preaching hold the line hold that position when you know your position when you know your calling when you know where you've been placed then you hold right there you don't move when circumstances change would set them sane when your feelings change amen the Word of God never changes so you hold your position in that word I am a believer and I am believing not in my feelings not in my symptom I am believing in what the Word of God said [Applause] so again the whole deal is now Satan is trying to pull us in his fire but it's your job to hold your position pull him into his own fire the very fall from heaven that takes place in Revelation 12 because when he falls the bride goes up brother Branham tells us this third seal fourth seal second seal there's a number of places in the seals he says revelation 4:12 when the bride when the Satan has cast down the bride goes up so you see but what is he coming to the earth for he is coming to the earth to be played for the vials of judgment to be poured out unto him a man I mean he is coming to the earth for his kingdom to be destroyed hallelujah this is why he is falling he is falling so the wrath of God can be poured upon him while his pride has escaped the tribulation that is coming so you see it is the church God in the church becomes his strength to pull Satan into his own fires that he's made and to tuck those own and Jesus said in mark 16 and my name they shall cast out Devils and all two of them when it comes the Word of God the BIOS you know when it comes to the Word of God now listen closely when it comes to the Bible you become it seems sometimes really impersonal to us you know we we agree the Word of God is true how many believes that a man but it was written to someone else for example we read that the exploits of the faith of the patriarchs the Apostles and the prophets and we believe that every word spoken to them was as true as true as true can be and that was God dealing personally with them and we want God to speak personally to us and we longed out the same experience so that God can become personal to us and we would think it personal if God gave us the vision or we heard his voice and we believed that God was speaking directly and personal to us but now we're in most of time when we read the Bible we read it as if it's second-handed it is a wonderful and it's inspired a letter but it's written to somebody else in other words it was written to generation an age of nation or people or someone else it happened in another time in another place even we're very we're not careful we do the same thing with the message that God spoke to this generation and we apply it only to the Prophet how many times have I heard people scream out up it's his third bullet it was his third pull you know there's this is years and it's his and they don't realize that there Paul was he open and all those seals are revealing of the mysteries and it was a sword that was given in his to his hand but it was not for him alone it is for you and to your children I mind but now it's sometimes it seems like it is if God has spoken to a godly grandfather of ours and you know we we knew he worked walk circumspectly before God and and we readily accept that was God's Word to him God spoke to him and we would recount that and we would talk about it and talk reverently of it and believe it's to be the truth but it's not God's Word to us it's God's Word to him doc told my grandpa this God told my grandpa that you know and it's all true and what was said we agree it was good but it's sick and handed we relish in the truth that God spoke to our dear grandpa but it was his experience and there was God's Word and often this is how we read the Bible it's God's Word and we agree and we acknowledge that it is absolutely the truth we'll stand right here and say it's true from Genesis to Revelation is absolutely every word of God thus saith the Lord God spoke it and we give a mental assent to it that it is true but it's not personal it is a word that is spoken to someone else or to another generation a generation past we agree that the Bible is a revelation of that came from God like said we believe every word of it's the truth but when crisis comes it just don't work you know we simply are recognizing the truthfulness of what that marvelous book but we're not acting on it we're we recognizing God did that and we would my goodness women died for that yes sir I believe that but we're not acting on that because even though we're recognizing the truth of this marvelous word and how precious it is and God's hope and God revealed himself that God did this it was to them and on us now let me bring it down to you because there are many great wonderful grandfather's of this truth Abraham was Wonder it was one of them he was he was a wonderful grandfather of faith we call him the father of faith it's often referred to that we believe that God spoke to him and many believe that and man we enjoy reading about how God revealed himself to Abraham amen we enjoy recounting the stories which sometimes even react emotionally to it and yet it was God's Word Tabor him and we long for some revelation like Abraham had Sam dar was a person like most of us he dealt time after time with the pain of being robbed by intruders he agreed that God spoke to his forefathers he believed it with all his heart he was circumcised on the eighth day he was a full-fledged um israelite he was a person who had the Word of God that he could look back upon and day after day he waited and longed and prayed for God to speak to him as his boat to Abraham Isaac and Jacob oh god if you would just be to me God if you just revealed yourself to me and the Word of God to Abraham just younger it was true Shamgar believed it but it wasn't personal you know it was something spoken to Abraham for some guard it was a word of the past and was without life and was without power because it was the only secondhand a man he treated it with respect if he could have had a copy dummy in his tent or in his little Hut of his home he would have regarded that and held it close to his heart and believed it but it was a word of the it was a word for an age passed it was to Abraham but one day Shem Daria lized the word that was spoken Abraham was not only spoken a for him but to Abraham NEC and the word rang out to him and the word became personal he didn't see a vision he wasn't smitten on the head by an angel he didn't have a certain feeling hey ma'am a man all Oh what happened was is the word became personal to him and there was no longer Abraham's word alone but now he could see himself in it because he said unto Abraham and his seed thou shalt possess the case of thine enemy amen now that seed shall possess the gates of thine enemies he realized them that his seed of Abraham that the word was his personally and he did he went into action he didn't wait the moment he saw the word was not very BAM only but for him also and he took the position of being Abraham's seed now he always was Abraham seen but he had to take the position of being Abraham see and his by being Abraham's seed I am on the Covenant and because I am a covenant I with God I am the circumcised and a child of Abraham I have the right to the inheritance from him therefore that even me the case of my enemies I can possess it hallelujah Oh hallelujah if you can just take think of seeing in formalin he then took his ox code and he struck down 600 of his enemies why because the word the Bible became personal can I say to you the written word became personal it was no longer Abraham's word alone but now it was his word now this is what Joshua was dead he wasn't trying to take Moses place he wasn't Liz and standing there and say you know I'm and now I'm gonna take him Moses place I'm I'm now the great prophet he wasn't doing that he's just he you know let me just say today nobody can take the seventh angels place hey man we're but we should know the message wasn't for brother branham alone a man it is our message and we have been handed the king Seward a man we have been given a word a message and it's not for decoration but to use against the enemy now Galatians 3:29 let's look at this together if you will Galatians 3:29 and if you be Christ's then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so now if you are Christ having been born of Christ and man you belong to Jesus come on man you're tracing back your lineage right now you're looking right there then that means everything that was given to Abraham's seed is also given to you because if your Christ then you're Abraham's seed and you are heirs according to the promise the promise makes you an heir that means it makes the Word of God not grandpa's story but it makes God's Word your story it becomes your testimony it becomes God's Word to you so that means that the word spoken and given Abraham and his seed now belongs to us through Christ therefore any word that was given to the prophets and the apostles of old belong to us as the heirs of the promise ever word so now all of a sudden we've opened up a whole a whole book written personally you wanted something personal it is believers today you wanted something personal got such a message he has anointed you establish who he has called you he is for danger he has placed you for this hour and this time he gave you a message it is personal it must be personal so when he said these signs shall follow them that believe that's personal if he says the works that I do said you do also that's personal and this means that any word that is given to the apostles or prophets of old belong to us as the heirs of the promise and this means whether Jeremiah I say or Ezekiel or Matthew or mark or Luke or John or Paul or Peter whether it was a word that come to them and they spoke it it's as much mine as it was there for example we're going to read from the Bible speaking to Jeremiah and we think oh what a wonderful word it is jeremiah 29:10 but thus saith the lord that starting off pretty good ain't it we can we'll all agree now this is a word spoken by God it is the truth that after seventy years we accomplished that battlin I will visit you and perform my good words would you in causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think toward Jews said the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you and expect it in and then say you call upon me and you should go and pray to me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me and when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you said the Lord and I will bring you again and do the place where I caused you to be carried away captive how many would agree this is a wonderful word of God it is the word it is dust saith the Lord we agree that it is the truth a wonderful word from God but this word must be personal even though we mentally agree that it is a wonderful word we can look at it and we can say but it stays real they were down in Babylonian captivity they were down there and it was now seventy years God said I'll bring you out and now the time were you know was there and now you know it was all the this word that he was going to bring them back into their inheritance and back and their place and too often Christianity as a whole have put their finger on scriptures like that and they only have a historical significance there were great words of God and they were fulfilled and they move on and we look back well God give his word to them and and whatever and mentally agree we agree that it's a wonderful word god - indeed kept his word - the Israel and returned them back into their place in her homeland and yet for off to oven it's only history yet it's a wonderful history but it's of no real value until it becomes your word from God not just something that was only spoken to Israel now how can this happen then a word that has spoken to a generation past can be for me today house as possible it comes back recognizing if we are Christ then we are Abraham's seed and we are also heirs according to the promise so that when we read this scripture that we we position ourselves in Christ recognizing ourselves as seed his seed by the new birth a man and the and as the seed of Christ the word that was spoken to Abraham's natural seed applies now even more to you than it did to them now why is that why would it mean more look like to me the first application would mean the most it because the first application was only for shadow and typing and speaking of another generation to come to whom this work would be real to and so they're only acting out in type what is going to be done from when it moves from negative to positive hallelujah a man omame this would be a moment today of realization to you so suddenly it is quicken to you as a personal word from God a man that the word becomes something that is not only written to a generation of some thousands of years ago but a revelation of the wheel and the purpose of God to you a man what does he say I will visit you well I'll tell you if I were you this morning I get ready for visitation hallelujah Healing has been pronounced over you deliverance has been past but pronounced overview a rapture has been pronounced overview look to two women that came to brother branham's meeting and their and their David they were they were told you know what the problem was one had a quarter the other the other had a stomach issue and the end so they they they were told you know you know go eat your supper you know go go go your way you know goddess God has healed you now many times people look at that and they say well if he didn't happen immediately God didn't do it let me tell you it already happened before the vision the vision only was telling what Christ did at Calvary a man because way back then he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your iniquities all may this be a personal word to you today I mean this is not just a historical a recount of what happened to Jesus in is your lamb it is your sacrifice it is your provision it is your Redemption now he said I will perform I will visit you now these women they went home they felt no different things was no different but the word had been spoken a man the symptoms didn't get better in fact they got even worse but they kept testified but that man never knew me that was a that he told me what my condition was he told me what my name was and and where I lived and all these other things and I know it was the truth and then some would say what would say to them but you don't just give up on it you know it's a he you just got worked up on me and on it it's not gonna happen here you're even bringing a disgrace on the name of Christ and they stood right there firm and he said it was several weeks later said the angel of God was passing by the neighborhood and the woman got up in the morning and she she began to eat her her the leftover toasted and oatmeal from that her children she made for children and that would just burn her stomach but she you just kind of felt hungry and she just you know grab bits of Gladys healed me and I'm taking him at his word and she just began to eat and her best uh McNair burned st. more and it never burned she ain't more and never burned so he's got all excited when to running over to her neighbor's house and and she gives over there and she's up shaking the sheets and everywhere because the the Gorter tumor had left her body and she was healed and brother enzert what was it the angel of Claude was passing through the neighborhood I meant why because somebody refused to give up on the world of Claude hallelujah and the angel when he came by he found them still believing I want you today I want that to be your position oh where you're holding the line you're still believing the word of promise no matter what your symptoms look like no matter how what your feelings are you believe what God's Word said and you declaring it to be the truth hallelujah I'm not saying you won't have your bad feelings I'm not saying you won't have your symptoms I'm not saying you got to deny what the doctor says I'm saying you got to say what God's Word said so as a seed of Christ this word must become more personal to you you must look at it I will visit you I will perform my good word to you I will cause you to return to this place I love you I will visit you you return to this place now this place for you today may be good health a man or it could be the joy of your salvation or wherever you need to return come on amen for the church brother way of Branham said the place was Pentecost in the message desperation he said that it what caused him to return to this place he said back to Pentecost understand this is where the church has returned and God has said I will cause you to return back to Pentecost again not to Azusa Street back to the book of Acts back to the world in action again back to the holy ghosts in the Turks living in the church acted in the trucks mmm would faith believe in the word of promise that's the place we have been returned a man come on now I want you to get ready for your blessing I want you to get ready for the angel passing by because he's coming through the land the I do you know brother Jim cuz we're in the crisis imagine anytime there's a crazy live listen do you want miracles but you can't have miracles without a crisis I remember it's in the time of crisis that miracles happen and you may be in a crisis it's morning but stand there in your position as a son of God that the word is nigh me even in my mouth it's the word of faith that we preach hey man it is there for you to take confess and stand alone and hold the line it's the position now and as far as that let me just give you a word of encouragement your church might be like brother madam says to a dentist well o'clock but I want you to know we've got a word of promise today that it's not gonna remain that way maybe you're searching and revival but I'll tell you you can have a revival and you can be the revival when you realize the word if spoke personally to you if we just look at it for a moment that that I I will visit you I'm after your return from Babylon and then I will turn away your captivity let me let me just there at verse 10 for thus saith the Lord that after seventy years be accomplished that babblin I will visit you will our time isn't been 70 years down in Babylon it's been four seven Church ages hallelujah but after after the church Jesus is all over and Backlund has carried the church into captivity and there's been trouble and then people have forgot God and then faith is at a low ebb man it looks like it ain't gonna happen let me give you a word of promise after seven church jesus be accomplished that babel ender I will visit you and I want you to know God has misted this generation and he still here fisting his people he's still passing through the land looking for somebody with faith that will believe him I will visit you I will perform my good word towards you hallelujah you've asked for healing you're crying for healing you ask for your children your cry for your children and then you abandon your band of misery you've been in captivity you bet you've been haunted you've been trouble they'll never have strife has been there you've been carried away your your you're depressed you don't feel good or whatever it is let me tell you I will perform my good work toward you Oh God and I keep my word I watch over day and night I'll not leave a jumper cable to fall through the ground I'll keep every word of promise and we're at the end of the ages hallelujah Daniel began to read by books the search by in the books he began to look in the scriptures you know people are looking to see where the virus is then looking to see what brother branham said about plagues they're looking to see what brother famine said about trouble I'm not looking in the air to see what brother Bantam said about plants I'm escaping the tribulation I know it's a Feast of the trumpet it was it was answered and the question was answered will not go through that time hallelujah I'm not looking in the message to see and search out about virus and plagues and flu and other pandemics of the past that's not what I'm looking a message I'm looking for the appearing of the angel of the Lord a man I'm looking for his presence of him performing my good work toward you in causing you to return to this place to come back to Pentecost to come back to the original Word to come back to the power of God to come back to something more than mechanics with it I hear a prophet see you coming and he warns the devil Satan you be careful because there's are people on the on the rise there's an army on the rise there are people that are headed back to their promised land and they're not going the little ones are going the young ones are going hey man the husband their wives our children will have the Holy Spirit there I will visit you evening like get ready for the visitation [Applause] hallelujah yah he revealed itself Abraham and told about Sodom in the sins of it and the sodomites and the call out of the church said and the separation between the church and the bride and the revealing of the mysteries but this time he comes to give you strength this time he comes to perform his good word to you I will visit you and I will perform my good word toward you in causing you to return you say but I've been sick too long now you've not been sick too long you say my cases to heart no your cases into her this is the word of the Lord I will called you I will call my church to be neither barren or unfruitful I will tiles and Joachim a man which he was down in battling she couldn't sing the songs of victory the Somme said of those in Babylonian captivity I've hung my hive on a willow tree I can't sing to some design in a foreign land but we're not in a foreign land we have been returned back to the land of promise I don't know you take your heart down today off the willow tree sing the old songs at him and even say new songs because when the book was open the seals were all but are they saying a new song I will perform my good word toward you I will cause you according it again desperations brother branham reads this for his sermon desperation everybody's preaching everybody's crying but we got to get under the blood Oh were you know where is the time like Ezra was is a time of social distancing and everybody's in their little on their little homes and the token must be applied that we have this token it's going to keep us from any trouble but how many are looking at desperations as a brother branham did and in desperations he reads this scripture in this desperate hour he will return you back to this place where you left where the church left when you enter wondering as it was in the tent in the Indus in the ages like wandering in the wilderness for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord don't get nervous don't get afraid of this amen listen the thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end a man what is our expected in to return to the place to return to the world to return to the full promise then you will call on me and you some pray unto me and I will hearken to you let me tell you according to this word this morning God's listening like he never has if you look at the Seventh Seal when the Seventh Seal is up and breaking the silence what happened to prayers the incense is poured out upon the altar which are the prayers of the same and they are accepted before God this is not a time where God is not hearing prayers this is a time where God has now receiving those fares can I say things that have been on hold for a long time children that have been straying a long time a man those that have been sick a long time those have been discouraged a long time but you see it's no longer at the time of holding it back it's the time of answering Amen were the prayers of his coming and the fulfilling of his word and putting the bride back in her position so she can take a rapture is not here above us I'm gonna listen to you you got me here go ahead we've been one to say what prayers have you been praying and it ain't been answered what seems some end on hold for years and years it ain't on hold no more I feel the Holy Spirit's we man the prayers are be an answer then you shall call upon me and you some go and pray into me and I will hearken to you and ye shall seek me and find me when you search for me without your heart people will just let me rules and regulations and all of that I just want somebody to let me with all their heart when you see me when you make that and I want to say let us be a little reprieve let this be a little quite time to realize again it's not just about gathering together it's not about who has the biggest Church and the message it ain't about having the most members about having those who shout the most hey man no sir this is not what it's all about God is making you realize this there's got to be a people serve me love me search for me with all their heart your vote one kazar going like that most people will us much more 50 60 $70,000 just going like that others are you know and then some say well I was smart I dumped all of mine and I made a lot of money and if things don't change the real quickly your money gonna be worth a net I've been in Uganda where you took suitcases full of money to pay a nice hotel bill thousand dollar bills thousand dollar bills I don't know shillings whatever they call it you money don't your job don't like that all the comforts gone just like that you get happened in the instance what's God doing right now making you realize what is valuable making you realize what you need to be seeking for with all your heart and when yourself seek me and find me you shall seek me and find me I love those words you're gonna seek me but you're gonna find me it's not an empty search you're not gonna come up if you're handed a man you're gonna find him look and you see when you cell search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity the devils have you captured with cancer the Devils have you captured with with a brain bleed the Devils have you captured with bareness the devil have you captured with whatever kind of autoimmune disease that crops up in this agent we're finding about diseases we never heard of in our life amen but God said I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I've driven you saith the Lord and I will bring you into the place where I caused you to be carried away captive I'm gonna bring you back to the homeland I'm gonna bring you back to a personal word I'm gonna bring you back to a personal God now you see it's the word and like I said we agree it's the word but it's got to be that moment of realization to you and quicken that it's God's personal word to you you see again he said I know the thoughts that I think of you and they are at peace and not of evil to bring you to this expectancy and a returning to the place that you have longed for having been longing for a position to be back established in a certain place you ask all the time many of you do for a closer what would God what are you asking to be positioned in favor today this is not just a word to the Jewish people of 2000 or 2500 years ago it's as true to you today as it was to them in fact if it's possible it's even more true to you and I'm far because it were a shadow that foretold the reality that is revealed to you today I want you I want you today from this moment on start taking another look at the word it's more than Abraham's story and man it's more than Joshua stop in the Sun it's you stopping either to me it's you defeating your enemy it's you standing on the promise and when you read it read it personally he was speaking and I don't have the represent from mana and me but he will let us know God's angel is to lead and I want you to understand the angel of the Lord has not left us he just went before us amen because many are thinking the pillar fire is gone the angel of God has forgotten the angel of God has went before us hallelujah hey man he is the waymaker he's preparing the way he's ever-present one water from the rock hallelujah in your driest moment when it looks all stone he's the stone begins the water hallelujah when it looks like all your waters are bitter he is the tree that makes it sweet and when you're hungry and you don't know what were you know what were the provision is he's the one who reigns down manna a man the angel of God is there he is there to lead his children all the way we have not been abandoned we have not been forgotten but rather he has prepared and opened up the way he has opened up the way for your next victory a man he has opened up the way for you to be successful in this next battle but the battle you're in this is what he said to them and I want you to remember you are the one he's talking to this is God's Word personally do you and you shall serve the Lord your God and he will bless your bread in your water and I will take sickness away from you hallelujah a man no woman in your land will miscarry or be barren I will fulfill the number of your days and I will send my terror ahead of you and throw confusion in the heaven nation that you encounter and I will make all your enemies turn and run did you hear the word of the Lord this is God's Word to you I will make your enemy to turn and run don't you give up right now your enemies this home the beds of running [Music] Hallelujah don't you stop on that promise right now don't give up on it the enemy is just about the target run [Applause] hallelujah no woman shall be buried in your land and I will fulfill the numbers of your day and I'll my Tara ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation that you encounter the angel is here he said it's my battle he says it's my back I'm here I'm leading you I'm preparing the way I'm the waymaker I'm The Promise Keeper I'm the light in your darkness of your God and I change not and Jesus never fails hallelujah are you with me hey man listen listen let me try to get some of this and and as always I'm starting to run out of time but listen then let me tell you he's God and His Word are inseparable I meant God in His ways his word and his word is God this is God in print form this is the voice of God the imprint for and if I can get it is not just a voice to God to another generation it's God's voice to you it's your letter I've assured you I'm Debbie here and I did it there and I didn't hear and I did it there and I was only showing you what I'm doing now I rolled away the stone and there was a resurrected Christ then there's gonna be an anointed one in this last day also a resurrected people and the angel is said of the stone to make sure that nobody ever puts the stone back home because you're not gonna seal this bride away and sub denominational tomb and ISM a man in unbelief again no sir a woman of faith she's called the faith woman God's written word is no less than God himself I'm a captive aid this nor capitalize on this again but brother Branham says in the infallible Word of God he said you can't rest your faith as I say upon just anything you've got to have some basic fact and the reason I rest my faith upon this word is because I believe it to be the Word of God and then if it's God if it is the Word of God it is God himself in Word form hold up your Bible right now and I want you to say this is the Word of God and it is God himself in Word form it is just as powerful and has just as much life in it as when it wrote of his lips if it was 2,000 years ago or 10 million years ago his word still holds the stars in place though it was spoke in the beginning that said let there be and it's that word has held them and is just as powerful today as it was then it hasn't changed and that word today is still right over you it's just as powerful today as it was then he said and then if that is God himself and no man is any better than his word all right should declaration here that's something that I'll do now I'm no better than my word then that word is and the word is part of me it's my word and if this is God's wicked written word it can be no less than God himself because he's obligated to his word hey man now I you know we we're just gonna go from that because I and I'm gonna skip down because we're just running out of time now but I want to remind you when the angel of God came to Mary and spoke about the forerunner coming which was John who would be born of her cousin Elizabeth and he said you know he said here when he told her that said nothing for with God nothing shall be impossible so I want you to know there is a word attached to the message of the forerunner and that is with God nothing shall be impossible now with with Elizabeth she was past childbearing and man it was impossible as far as men was concerned and then with Israel she was a barren woman too to bring forth the Messiah and she look like what never happened a man we were looking out today and we see a church that has been barren looking for the coming of the Lord for 2,000 years for the promised son to appear but I want to remind you with God nothing shall be impossible and this is the word that is spoken when he sends a forerunner I'm gonna stablish you back on the word because with God nothing shall be impossible let me read another translation not one promise from God is empty of power for nothing is impossible with God let me read that again not one promise from God is simply a power that devil hey man we got a whole word we got a whole arsenal full hey man we've got every precious promise that makes us for takers of His divine nature hallelujah and not one promise of God is empty of power for nothing is impossible with God another version says for no word of God shall be void of power the amplified says for with God nothing is or ever shall be impossible again then another amplified version says the complete version said for with God nothing is ever impossible in no word from God shall be without power or impossible of fulfillment now God is honest come o a man God his honest guns will to keep his word amen the Bible said that he is not a man this is number 23 29 1923 19 numbers 23:19 God is not a man that he said laughs neither the son of man that he should repent but he has said shall he not do it or hath he spoken it and the salad not be made good so here again if God said it and man if he spoken it what'd he make it good cuz he's not a man then he has to repent he doesn't put it out and say oh well circumstances change so now it's not gonna happen when God says it it's gonna happen hey man he is not a man that he should lie when he says something it's going to happen hey man again it says in 1st Kings 8:56 there's not one word one word there's not failed one word of all his good promise somebody with me hey man there has not failed one word of all his good promise it says some sums one eighty eight eighty nine forever Oh Lord your word is settled in heaven brother Brandon would say we argue about it here but up there it's settled a man he says I will hasten my word to perform it and that word hasten means to watch over to look after to protect to stand behind a man in all his unlimited power God is standing behind his word to accomplish it do you believe that you must confess that there is no reason to doubt God hallelujah I want you to look at your circumstance right now and say I got reason to doubt that circumstance but I have no reason to doubt God not one word of his promise ever failed if that Bosworth said don't doubt God if you must doubt something doubt your doubts because they're unreliable but never doubt God or his word a man I think that's good instructions today DL moody said if there's any reason why is there any reason why you should not have faith in God has God ever broke one of his promises his I defy any infidel or unbeliever to place a finger on a single promise God ever made and failed to fulfill Satan is a liar I mean Jesus said so and I can open my Bible right now and show you out for 6,000 years Satan has lie to God's people circumstances always lied symptoms lied come on oh yeah Satan has lied but God has never lied the devil is denied God's promise and Hilda him you promise you anything but the devil had never kept any of his promises amen that's why we need to determine whatever Jesus told us to do as his followers we're gonna do it whatever he said we he would do we should expect him to do it cuz he never lies we should act upon his written word just as the prophets of God acted upon his spoken word in the Bible hey man we should do like the disciples did of our Lord if he said we could heal the sick we should expect the sick to be healed if he said we can cast out devils we should do it in his name and expect the devil to obey us we find that true hey man we remember you scam what was it over 10 domani demonstrations of the devil and everyone am I to bow to the name of Jesus Christ I want to say it's wonderful to have a gospel that works we every witnessed the restoring of the sight to the blind would God heal my wife and restore her sight and I'll just tell you he'll do it again [Applause] you say brother Jim then the healing didn't last we had a victory for five years a man what do you think it doesn't laughs we've had five years of victory and you know Israel without victory and being their promised land and they would have feet the Philistines and here few years later here they come back again and invade again can you say what that was in the victory no you can't say that wasn't a victory no that was a victory I met but now we are faced with another crisis and there's another victory hallelujah and we'll draw strength from this victory I've gotta do it again because nothing to our God he's the resurrection and the life who you were dead yet shall he live hallelujah we witness the healing of the crippled will little drew walked we witnessed the sick and diseased when brother Gary stinking laying there at the point of death demons been howling at him screaming at him distressing him who he went in there with a purpose why there's churches Milt it's a memorial that God heals it was built on the fact that God heals that day in that room God gave us a mandate it was some miracle after miracle after miracle of God's provision Alleluia so what if you never use it again what difference does that make he'll stand as a star testimony that God is a provider because I have you to know when the rapture takes place I hope it's mostly empty don't any of you show up here show up there when little judo goes be was healed when Mariah Pruett when Atlanta butts was healed and we can rejoice today in the truth of Jesus word all things are possible to them that believe they shall lay hands on the sick everywhere in the gospel in the book of Acts believers laid hands on the sick but you know what we've done this we in the message we have started putting too much and I even hear him today I heard a group of ministers and God bless them and brothers if you hear this I don't mean to criticize you I don't even know these brothers but they somebody sent me a link and they they said well you know you know what we need is not not the Holy Ghost we don't need that what we need is we need more teaching and I said more teaching we gotta have more mechanics what more teaching do we need we got 1100 tapes of teaching we made the illusions out of all the preachers when study didn't quoted it back and forth and back and forth and back and forth we've got the mechanics brother branham said it back there and he said we too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics Smith Wigglesworth David Dexter shared this quotation some of you may have read it already but there was once a boat in the mouth of the Amazon River the people on board thought they were still in the ocean they were dying of thirst and some of them were nearly mad they saw his shift and they asked him we just give us some water someone in the ship said just dip your bucket right over your in the mouth of the river hallelujah anyone ought to say there are a number of people today in the middle of the river of life but they're dying of thirst cuz they do not dip down and take from the river and dear friend you may up the word but you need an awakened spirit the word is not alive until it's moved upon by the Spirit of God in the right sense and it becomes spirit in life when it's touched by his hand alone so we need to say God awaken my spirit to the truth of the word where I dip into it and drink I have been starving for visitation I've sent your message got your whole Bible I will visit you I'll return you to this place a place where the written word becomes real where the written word becomes yours where it becomes personal are you with me amen you know again I you know it's time we dip down into the river of God's blessings and start drinking we're not out on the sea when I didn't babbling what about a trip to the that there we have returned to the land and that waters the rivers of milk and honey now as I try to bring this down to close I'm gonna I'm just going to bring it bring it down to you just for a moment when you as the sick learn to base your faith on the Word of God exclusively that's when you will have luck won the victory too many times people are waiting for a special moment a special prayer line a special touch a special treat and that's where their faith is laying and if it doesn't happen under that preacher they find of someone that maybe has a little more faith or it preaches a little more dynamic or somebody that has a few more miracles and hope that in his line they'll get it I want to go back and bring this to a close and will be out by 1:30 but you remember sister Lana's healing of cancer God quick in the scripture to me I didn't write her over a day I didn't I didn't write her very often really I just tried to give her a word of encouragement when I felt like it but God inspired the scripture to me one morning and I sent it to her with these words I said you're continually in our prayers daily in through the night yeah and that's true even this morning and for the last few mornings I've been up at 3:00 in the morning talking it over with him talking him about you your needs your situation you that are sick he said I would seek Him and I would find him and I said there's not a day that we neglect to pray for you so that your faith be lifted so that the healing names of the Holy Ghost can sweep over you with his healing touch responding to your faith we know faith is a gift of God that each of us possess it is his faith we are rising to the occasion with you and God is not on your side you are on his side and the battle is not ours it is the Lord's and IRA and ice in our second Chronicles 2015 and he said hearken ye all Judah you inhabitants of Jerusalem and thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by the reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods and this became a double witness my sister Mary Katharine mälar the same scripture to come to her home on that same day and sister Lana took that scripture that was written there great-great-great great-great great-grandfather Jehoshaphat a man that she will always say yeah it's true and that's right and yea God did that and God answered and God did and got that but that day it became personal the written word the written word became alive to her she began to accept that her as her own and said Lord if the battle is not mine but yours then you're gonna have to do something supernatural and she began to expect for something supernatural that day sitting right back there in the mezzanine as I preached on the revealing of sons over that February 18th 2008 I 18 I think I was preaching the Bible days are here again now listen what was it why would we preach it wise brother Timothy been preaching what he's preaching brilliant chill preach brother Aaron preach why are we preaching the way we're preaching because we're in a crisis and I'm not just talking about Cohen 19 we've been in a crisis before then I mean even in your home even in your family you may be in a crisis right now in that home I'm in a crisis so why not preach like I'm preaching because because in the crisis I'm looking for the angel I know the crisis is here don't tell me about the crisis and how bad the crisis and how impossible it look I'm looking there to see the angel I'm looking at there to see him I know the scripture make it alive I was preaching the Bible days are here again that we had a Bible Jesus doing Bible signs and Bible wonders and Bible works and that God was doing extreme things and I want to give you a word again this morning God is doing some extreme things [Music] shall i prophesy it God is doing extreme things right now I speak that in his name we began to worship God we made getting the same glory to his name what have I to dread what have I to fear leaning on the everlasting arms and as we did the word that was spoke to her went into action put it back second Chronicles 2015 thus saith the Lord to you the man who aren't ready to take thus saith the Lord to you this morning can it be something more than 10 your great-great-great great-great-great great-great-great great-grandfather a nice word spoke to him and and it worked back there can it not be personal to you today that saith the Lord have you ever seen that st. the Lord ever fail be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude don't be afraid and we begin to sing what if I could read what have I to fear I am blessed peace with my lord so near and women and hear these very words maybe she didn't think of them at the moment but this was her scripture that it come alive to her that God's gonna do something supernatural I'm Allan in that moment there in that very supernatural moment you know where she heard of Bible that works a Bible day a Bible God a Bible in action hey man oh she began to hear those three things now echoed in a song you know that that we're saying here don't be afraid be not afraid nor dismayed by the reason of the multitude of all the doctors reports by the multitude of your symptoms by how you feel today by the circumstances around you what have I to dread what have I have here I have blessed peace with my lord so near and it that she jumped up and put her faith into action hey man and she ran twice around that building you know you saw it a lot of people that son didn't know what it even meant can't believe it but there were people here that day that is just you know that just turned and went away after seeing it all happen and that's what Jesus said some will not believe that one raised from the dead but anyway nevertheless she took that as her own and it became quicken to her be not dismayed by the reason of this multitude and I want to say don't be afraid don't be dismayed at all what the doctor says oh how you're feeling today we've had a multitude of bad news she had a multitude of bad news she didn't have no good news she was getting weaker by the day thinner by the day come on but she had heard the battle is not yours but gods a man and she jumped up from there and acted on it and ran around this and when showing the devil I have nothing to fear I have nothing to dread and she proclaimed her healing right there a man right there is and she she did you remember I said you just see Miriam batts cuz her enemy is dead hallelujah why because when you begin to act upon the word you will have the word prophesied back to you hallelujah your enemy is dead do you know after she went back to her seat back there she still had the cough she still had weakness she still went under the doctor the next day for a scan and discovered her cancer was gone it was dead totally gone God had fought her battle mmm but did you know it took some time for her feelings to catch up with what with God's Word it took some time for her Street to catch up with God's Word come on it took some time it took some time for her symptoms to catch up with God's Word but the devil was gone remember when you realize God's Word is true and that he can't lie then it becomes through to you that nothing in the realm of feelin can ever separate you from the love of God and from the Word of God again I hear the skeptics say and I'm closed and bring your musicians you know remind me to quit I heard the skeptics and the critics say brother Tim this healing for sister Karen is not real because it didn't last well like I said thank you very much we've had five years of wonderful victory but it slide but it's just like telling me that God didn't deliver Israel from the Philistines you didn't win any war cause they've invaded again well let me tell you they're gonna get the same sauce again because we're not letting them take the land the battle is the Lord's the Word of God is against you Satan you've got to realise in your case where you're at this morning the Word of God is against the devil the Word of God is on your side go ahead and proclaim it the battle is not yours its the Lord's go go ahead and cry and proclaim it and put your faith on the Word of God because so you know that is that that again faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things not seen it's the realities it's the confidence the God's Word is true how do I know I'm healed I was prayed for and I don't feel no different how do I know I'm healed well because God said if we laid handle the sick they shall recover and God don't lie God said whatever we ask in his name um won't do it and he don't he don't go back on his promise he's not a man that he has to repent let me just tell you today take your position in the word in order to defeat the devil you got to start by position yourself I am a son of God and the devil has no right to this temple he has no right to my family he's no right to me I'm seed of Abraham and ever promised in this word is mine and I'm gonna claim it because every promise in the book is mine let your spirit be awakened this morning and dip into the water reached it and there is fresh it's not some salty seawater in some denominational variants the fresh water from the rock I - flowed right out and it's right there to you it's the River
