========================================

I saw your struggles. Fear had its grip on you. I saw the years of tears and prayers that were prayed for you. I saw the torment. Satan's blood put on you. But I watched I watched you break through. I watched you break free of those chains that held you bound. I saw God's mighty hand bring deliverance down in just one moment. Atonement changed, delivered, set free. I see what God's done for you. I've watched you break [Music] through. Oh, Satan trapped [Music] you in his dark web of sin. tried to put out the light that God had put with him. We serve a God who answers and didn't stop praying for you. There I watched I watched you break through. I watched you break free from those chains that held you bound. I saw God's mighty hand bring deliverance down. In just one moment, atonement, changed, delivered, set free. I see what God's done for you. I watched you break through in just one moment. Atonement, changed, delivered, set free. I see what God's done for [Music] you. I watched you break through. [Applause]
