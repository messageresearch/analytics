the house of the Lord amen looking forward Amen to what God has for us we here tonight the bus will be coming here in just a few moments to pick up the young people and take them up to Ohio and and uh been part of that that camp for the first three years and and I have to say the Lord has been very good in that camp and moved many times and many wonderful ways definitely going to miss being a part of it this year but amen God has other men that he's has ordained for the moment and he's still the same God and so we're looking for God to do even more and and touch our young people and bless them I pray they come back encouraged and amen filled with the Holy Ghost and amen and Revival and thaning thanking the Lord for all that he's done in their lives and I believe God's here to answer amen will be there to answer their needs according to his riches and glory amen how many loves the Lord tonight amen I was with brother Matt Morris and the church there this weekend and they send their greetings had a wonderful time with them but glad to be back home amen let's let's read in the scripture here behold there was a man in Jerusalem verse 25 whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed to him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ amen God bless you today you be seated amen I just want to speak on a thought for a few moments on Faith's expectations amen I I believe we ought to be expecting things from God Amen I I believe we ought to be living in a time of expectation that any moment any time any day amen our Lord will return and the dead in Christ shall arise and will be changed to be like him and his glorious body I'm looking forward to that time I I really am I I believe amen as you you young people are headed to a meeting I believe you ought to be under expectation amen and expecting the right things not just expecting you know to see a few friends and and to hang out for a little while and and be be at a a camp for a moment and play a little volleyball or basketball but to be expecting something from God and I believe if you are God will be there and meet you according to your expectations you know Moses uh we could go as we started this thought for moment Moses for a while he squandered around and and he you know waffled back and forth on whether he was the deliverer or not or whether he was really sin or not and then he tried on his own and we know the story as he would try on his own on he would kill an Egyptian but God wasn't wanting just one dead Egyptian he was wanting complete deliverance for his people and so he finds himself s out on the backside of a desert and we know what happened there is he came face to face with that Pillar of Fire that was in the bush a Amen brother Brown talks about how it took him to a place of expectation and in a place of a revelation in his heart who he really was as we read about Simeon Simeon had been revealed unto him there was a revelation there given by the holy ghost that he was not going to die till he seen the Lord's Christ and and when Moses met this same Pillar of Fire amen that he got this he got a revelation in his heart to go down to Egypt and to tell pharaoh to let God's peoples go and he became very Fearless he he knew exactly where he was standing and mean God said to him to go tell Pharaoh let him go and that's what he went and done and and you know and God told him that he would come to this mountain again and he would and and so he knew by faith that when he went there that Pharaoh's power would be lost he would not have power over him but in turn God would give him power over the Egyptians and that's exactly what happened and they were brought back to this same Mountain again and brother brand says we know where we're going to and this is we are at the end of The Journey God has promis there's a land beyond the river be Fearless Amen in your testimony if it's revealed to you you you become Fearless you don't care if the whole world what they say who says what you're Fearless he said when it's revealed to you that this is the truth coming from God you can be Fearless about it if if not you can't be but David another one you know he expressed to the whole Israelite Army amen that he had faith in his God and and here Goliath is making his Challenge and David wasn't a very big man or was it wouldn't be the pick you know to go out and fight him he wasn't the match or didn't really have the right weapon so to speak but he it didn't matter maybe maybe there were other people that were more qualified but David had been had been revealed to him that he was going to be king amen and so through that Revelation it gave him Faith to expect this Giant's going to fall amen and I I believe we can have that same expectation when it's revealed to us who we are that we're Sons and Daughters of the most high God then we also can have by Revelation have the same expectations that if we meet a giant and our path he will be just as Goliath amen amen what God will give us what we have need of In Our Moment of trial God will give us the healing we need God to give us the deliverance we need and he said see he said there he was standing upon the land that God had given Israel and there's this boasting uncircumcised Philistine out there he said we'll call him cancer tonight we'll call him whatever but David maybe no kind of match for him no weapon in his hand that would seem to work but he had this little piece of leather it was a goat skin and it been had been revealed to him that this giant was coming down but it was when it was revealed to him Revelation struck and he said the god that took me out of the paws of the bear and took me out of the paws of the lion how much more will he deliver me from an uncircumcised philistin amen he says his his brothers maybe were more than able to do it Saul was more than able to do it but it wasn't revealed to them but they believed it could be done they believed God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them that they could but it was revealed to David see that's a difference right there it's Absol when it's absolutely revealed to you that God's going to heal you you're going to get it amen you're going to get it I don't care what's wrong with you what's the odds against you it may be worse than David and Goliath but if it's revealed to you you are going to receive it notice when it's revealed David became Fearless he said today I'll cut your head off amen he began to speak words that a little boy don't normally speak to a giant but see David was not not depending upon his ability he wasn't depending upon his sling ability he was depending upon his God's ability and he knew the same God that watched over him with the lion watched over him with the bear is the same God had give him the victory over Goliath notice the the Giant on the other side didn't believe it it wasn't Revelation to him neither will the cancer he laughed am I a dog that you would send a kid out here to fight me am I nobody that you'll just send just send anybody to fight me I'll take my Spear and I'll I'll hold you up David and I'll let the birds eat from your flesh amen he had everything on his side seemed like all odds were against David but see that didn't Shake David at all because it had been revealed to him that this Giant's head was coming off amen it' been revealed to him that it was going to be over with and amen as David would let go of that Ro That Rock Amen if God would just speak to your heart tonight you're not going to be laying in that bed any longer you're not going to be sitting in that chair any longer you're going to be well amen you're not going to be in that situation any longer you're not going to be in that sin any longer you're going to be saved amen there wouldn't be anything change your mind about it if that Faith could fall into your heart and bring an expectation to bring it to pass amen until that happened he said every preacher in the world could pray unless it happens that God reveals it to you every preacher in the world can pray sure it would encourage you but the healing power is already in you it's already there amen it don't come from a preacher it comes by Revelation it comes by faith it's not by power not by might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord by Faith by Revelation amen David prove this was work some of them say you know I know you're just a naughty boy what are you doing you should be back up there tending the father's Sheep amen let let me he said but he said let me speak to Saul let me talk to somebody and he said well now son I admire your courage but you see you're nothing but a youth and this man's a Warrior from from his youth here no match for him and he said but I was tending my father's sheep see he was basing what he was about to do on a revelation on what God had done for him an experience amen he said oh brother he said see amen I have an experience he said it's the same if God has revealed to you that he's your healer and and he's your savior amen it's got to be revealed first come on if it's not revealed to you it doesn't matter how many times a preacher lays his hand on you it doesn't matter how many times words are spoken to you but until it's revealed to you Hallelujah this is what we want our young people to have their own personal revelation of Jesus Christ not what Mom and Dad's passed down amen this message is not a learned theology or a learned behavior this message is a revelation and it has to be a personal revelation amen Christ is not a a something that can be handed down generation after generation sure you can learn a bunch of rules and a bunch of regulations all kinds of stuff you can be taught amen but Christ wants to be a revelation to you he wants to be a revelation to your heart and to your life it ain't just about a preacher getting a revelation it's about you having your own personal relationship and revelation of Jesus Christ amen see if if it had he said he had something to base faith on it was on a revelation the same God that delivered me from the Pauls of a lion and a bear will deliver me from that uncircumcised philistin how do you know David I believe it it's been revealed to me he knew what he was talking about because he when the giant said I'm going to feed you to the birds he said I'm going to cut your head off amen he didn't back up when that giant begin to boast at him I mean the giant had been talking to everybody but it came time that the giant was talking to David but when he came down to David and said I'm going to feed you to the birds David didn't back up and said wait wait a minute what am I doing down here no he went forward he said today I'm going to take your head off amen this is what we need is somebody that are not back up when the Devil comes but to go forward amen say no it's been revealed to me I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God this is what God has called me for in this hour in this moment see Samson was caught off guard one day you know a thousand Philistines come up to him and he looked down the ground it wasn't nothing but a jawb but he picked up that old Jawbone dry as it can be and took out all of those Philistines beat him over the beat him over the head with an old dry draw bone of a mule and as far as he said as far as I know not a tooth ever fell out of it and then Philistines helmet maybe an inch thick cuz they beat each other with war clubs back in that day and he kept here's a man to you know to keep a man from beating in the head they wore these big old huge helmets but he took the Jawbone of that mu and beat down a thousand phis and the Jawbone never broke he just kept beating them like that as they come up and the rest of them took off for the Rocks amen he said see he said I want to tell you something work on that pulsation work on that spur the moment like Joshua did like Mary Magdalene did all of those just that moment when something is revealed to you grab a hold of it amen hold on to it that spur the moment yes it was revealed to him and he went to meet those thousands of Philistines he said now what do you think when those Philistines had look come in here that little shrimp you know brother Brown talks about it he said people want to draw him as some big muscular fell some big giant he said but he was just a shrimp little curly-headed mama's boy didn't look like he could do very much but after a thousand they changed their mind amen but it wasn't him anyhow it was a God that was behind him it was the Covenant the Revelation that would been given to him amen that gave him the ability to fight like that come on somebody we're also living under a covenant we are a covenant people amen that has been come to that's what gives us the ability when all Hell Comes against us we'll still stand when we lose on every side seem like we'll still fight cuz we're under a covenant sir boys they was looking at that boy ain't that ridiculous what's he doing what he was doing was expressing to those of Philistines what had been revealed to him by God hallelujah Oh my he grabbed a Jawbone and took off because that what he put in his hand he put that in his hand that's what he believed he could do and by doing so he was expressing to those Philistines what God put in his heart to do amen so you must have that same amen that same expression when you feel God move upon your heart move young people when you feel God tug move amen don't don't wait another service don't wait another moment don't don't put it off to the last service that's a lot of our expectations a lot of times as well Saturday night it's a prayer line listen you can have a good service the first service and the rest of them be great you can have the most amazing service the first service and get things with go right with God and everything else will be so wonderful to you Hallelujah but you ought to have that expectation God I'm looking for you on the first service I'm looking for you to move in my life immediately Lord I'm not looking for a day off quit letting the devil put you off in another day amen but this moment this time I'm going to receive something from God but expectations is based upon Faith you have to have faith before you can expect anything Faith come and faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God so that's where you must solemnly base your faith on is thus sayeth the Lord amen you must believe it it's God's word that's the only hope you can have that's the only substantial thing you can stand upon in this day is the word of God you can't stand on anybody else's word sure you there's good men in this world but good men can fail but God will never fail amen so you can stand upon his word he's infinite he won't make a mistake he's perfect therefore all of his promises are perfect as he is perfect Hallelujah do you know you're one of God's promises that means you're perfect tonight amen because God's per promises are perfect Amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word itself so therefore the Bible is the word of God it it is God himself placed upon paper for no man is any better than his word if we can't take a man's word it just can't have dealings with that man come on a man says he's going to pay you so much money and you he don't you can't have dealings with that man it's just the way it is I'm so you can't can't trust his word well I forgot amen if you got something you got a uh you got a something between between another you ought to take care of your word if you said you was going to do it do it amen but listen men will fail men will forget man men will get other things on their mind and other thoughts and they'll think about a lot of other things and forget all about you but God won't Hallelujah he won't forget about you he won't get other things on his mind he amen his mind is upon you tonight his mind is upon every young person here tonight his mind is upon every married person here tonight his mind is upon every one of his children tonight he won't forget you but here's Simeon as we read the Scripture it was promised by the Holy Spirit he would not see death until he seen the Lord's Christ he had a right to expect it because it had been revealed to him by the Holy Ghost so he had a right to have that kind of expectation amen if God has revealed to you something you have a right to expect it's going to come to pass it may take 25 years but if he said it you have the right to expect it amen Abraham he he was an old man you know when he was 75 years old and his wife 65 and the Lord spoke to him and revealed to him he was going to have a baby by Sarah his wife he was sterile she was Barren they'd been that way all their lives but yet God told him it was going to have have a child by Sarah so if God said it he had a right to expect it amen if God said he's going to have a bride without spot without wrinkle we have a right to expect that if God said You by his stripes I am healed I have a right to expect that if he said I'm the Lord God that heals all th diseases I have a right to expect that if he said the promises unto you and your children I have a right to expect that he said it but he asked him to separate himself to receive the promise this is where people get a problem they don't they want the promise but they don't want to separate themselves Abraham had brought a lot of baggage along with him his father-in-law and his his his nephew and all this stuff and it was causing him a lot of grief and a lot of Anguish and he's bringing them all right and the Lord said look you got to separate yourself if you want to receive this are we under the same Covenant as Abraham then don't be surprised if God is asking you to separate yourself separate yourself from those who are who have unbelief in their life separate your well they're they're my friends they're not your friends unless they're lifting you up towards Jesus Christ if they're tearing you down and bringing you down they are not your friends we take God at his word we have to separate oursel from all the things that are contr contrary to that word if we want to receive the promise you know you can't go to people and say how now how do you think I got my healing it ain't what they think it has nothing to do with it it's what you think it's up to you so he was asked to separate himself people get so worried about what other people think come on now young people especially how how do you think I look what do you think about it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks about it matters what he thinks about it amen they get so worried about it they can be accepted in in certain you know groups or this that and the other listen the main thing is the Bible says I've been made accepted in the Beloved that's all that matters amen I I don't it doesn't matter if I'm accepted by this one or that one or somebody else that matters not come on now it ain't about what somebody else thinks or what somebody else has or what somebody else expects what do you expect I want to ask you young people you're about to get on the bus and you're about to go 16 hours and and and and it ain't going to be real comfortable and it ain't going to be the most it'd be nice but it ain't going to be the most comfortable trip you ever been on but why are you going why are you going why why you putting the effort why' you pay the money why you going 16 hours through the night to go are you going just to have a good time or what are you going for what is your expectation are you expecting God to do something for you well if you are God will do what you're expecting him to do are you expecting to be filled with the Holy Ghost well then if you are expect to come back filled with the Holy Ghost are you expecting to be closer to God well if you are expect to come back closer to God it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks amen right we find out that the child didn't arrive until 25 years later but that didn't change Abraham's expectation but instead of growing weaker because it didn't happen the first month or didn't happen the next one or the next year he grew stronger his expectation was greater because it was revealed to him by faith wasn't revealed to him by feeling amen amen listen we we can't get the Holy Ghost by a feeling because your feelings eventually ain't going to be where they were when you're at Camp you get to camp and you you get you under expectations and the atmosphere and things are happening and people are jumping and shouting and car oh that's fine and wonderful I enjoy every bit of it but that's not our expectations our expectations is lives to be changed that when all the jumping and the shouting and the atmosphere is gone amen you're still walking with God 25 years you're still walking with God whatever time we got left up this Earth you're still work Walking with God it doesn't matter if you're in a valley on a hill amen going through a trial going through sickness you're still walking with God that is our expectation Sarah was one month older what be one month or one month further a year it be one year greater and the expectation because God always keeps his word it would be a it be a lot better for her to have a child at a listen this listen to this right here it would be a lot better for her to have a child at a hundred years old than it would be at 60 years old what it's a greater Miracle all the time so he never grew weak but he grew stronger now in our time we thought well it' been a lot better if it happened earlier and man she just had a CH but that ain't the way God works sometimes God's time is not our time the way he operates and the way he thinks his as the Bible say his thoughts are much higher than our thoughts because there's a lot of things I would think you know if I was God you know I would do it different but I'm not God some of you have the same thoughts well you know if I was if I if I could make this decision but it ain't us but he's seeing things different than what we can see things we have a limited sight we have limited thoughts we have limited abilities and yes some of ours is greater than others and somebody some people's got greater intellect than other people got but it's still I don't care if you got the greatest brain on the face of this Earth is still a limited brain and it's still nothing compared to what God has and the sight that he has is nothing or that we have is nothing compared to what he has he is seeing from a different place and can see the amen the beginning to the end we can only see one day to the next day we can only see the minute that's in front of our face or the second amen we can't see what's going to happen tomorrow or the next day a or even hour later things can change so quickly and we don't even see it coming but God sees it amen and so God plans for things he he's got things in his plans and and he's moving things and operating way that we can't comprehend but when we get to the other side and we have a body like his glorious body we'll be able to look back and say oh it all makes sense now I see why he did this why this happened this way sometimes it don't go the way we think but it goes the way God thinks so so if we're children of Abraham and we are the Bible said so we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed or HS according to the promise we're heirs because Abraham was given the promise now if we are heirs with Abraham then we are Abraham's children the same faith that Abraham had we must have ourselves the same a faith Abraham had we must have ourselves so when God makes a promise just know it's going to happen amen it can't do nothing else but happen can you imagine Abraham and Sarah 75 65 years old amen 201 15 20 years past men OFA and here here he lived with her since she was probably 16 17 years old no children but God Appears and told him what's going to happen you're going to have a child and Abraham expected that to happen because God said so but could you imagine them going down to the doctor and making arrangements with the doctor what would the doctor say man this old fell he done fell off his rocker something's wrong somewhere in his mental makeup every every listen to this every man or woman that takes God by faith and accepts his promises is considered by this world some kind of fanatic because the things of this world is so foolish to God what man calls great God calls foolish but Abraham believed first 28 days after her being passed 15 20 years past minut Paul how you feeling honey no different well praise God we're going to have a baby anyhow so much expectation in the house that maybe Sarah needed some booties and a little blanket and she was expecting something to happen he said and that's the reason it happened hello somebody that's the reason it happened year by year passed on Abraham got stronger giving praise to God and finally it happened why because he expected it to happen Hallelujah and here she was 90 years old and he was 100 what do you think about Abraham about to give up no sir we're going to have a baby we done got the co clothes made we got the bed ready we got everything how long you been how long you had them 25 years but God's going to send it anyhow see it's positive God said so and that settles it whatever God makes a decision he makes it for eternity now you know me and you can make a decision in five minutes have to go back and make another one because you was mistaken the first decision we make mistakes like that we pull the trigger sometime and we mess up and this that and the other but God being infinite he don't make mistakes if he makes a decision it's settled forever so if he made it a decision you're my son anybody seen that in the word where God told you you're one of his well if he told you that then it's settled forever amen you're my son see he can't come back and say I was wrong right glory amen somebody can choose you one day and un befriend you one day and unfriend you the next come on somebody we ain't got to go into Facebook and be every life friend you one day and unfriend you the next because of something but if God chose you before the foundation of the world he will not be wrong the devil can do what he wants to he can cover you up your sin he can cover you up with iniquity but if God chose you and I say he did you didn't get put here by accident you wasn't born into the family you're born in by accident but God pre-planned you before the foundation of the world and he's not changing his mind about you now if God makes a decision in the beginning if we believe his word he will make every promise come true then God still is the infinite God to his promise he cannot fail it must be that way you have to hit the spot if you take him at his word you will get there to the Fulfillment of the promise may take 25 years may take longer than what you want may take beyond what you even thought or how you thought it was going to be or how it was going to come to pass but if you'll just keep expecting believing God's go moving even when I don't see him he's working even when I don't know how it's going to happen or how all the parts are going to fall into place and the puzzle is going to come all together and it just seemed like one big mixed up W in a box right now and I don't know how it's going to take place but somehow God's got a plan you may have come come back to God and you feel like that you feel like your life is all muddled up and it's all messed up like a puzzle laying in a box and there's pieces laying everywhere but God has a plan he has a picture of you in his mind before the foundation of the world and the devil may have took that picture and shredded it all up but God knows how to put it back together he knows where every piece goes he knows every part of your life he knows how to put you back and to make you whole again he has a [Applause] plan some some people many ministers can say days of Miracles are passed even message ministers can say that I've heard them God doesn't heal people anymore but if God was ever called on the scene to to a sick man and healed him upon the basis of faith if another sick man comes to him he's got to do the same thing or he acted wrong the first time if you give one the holy ghost that obeyed him in the Bible exactly as he promised there in the book of Acts and he said the promises unto you and your children them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call if another man meets those same qualifications God is obligated by his word to fill him with the Holy Ghost because if he didn't he made a mistake and if God made a mistake he's a man and not God he's finite like we are but you see as Abraham's children we take God's promise and we hold on to it no matter what takes place we hold there just the same because God said so and it's finished it may not look like it's finished it may not look like it's done we sing the song all the time it's already done that is a statement of faith believe what God Said is going to be finished we may not see it with our eyes right now but by faith I see it already done by faith I see the promises already fulfilled by faith I see my children sitting in church by faith I see myself healed by faith I see myself saved it's got to be by faith Abraham believed that he believed God and took God his word and under expectations he waited 25 years with that expectation getting greater and greater and finally the baby was born because he was expecting it so where they get the term expected mother she's expecting to have a child we're expecting to have a body change we're expecting for prodal to come home we're exp we're expecting cancer to be defeated not hoping we're expecting by faith it's a revelation by God given to us by God that God has in his word and his word cannot fail therefore we are under expectation to see these things fulfilled I'm expecting young people to come back changed and different and delivered and set free and on fire for God can we not expect that even like Tabernacle we ain't sitting them up on a bus to just go have a good time we're sending up up there to receive the Holy Ghost and let me tell you something you ain't got to you ain't got to wait to get on a bus to get it you can get it tonight he's the same God tonight amen that can come according to how you expect him to come if you need Deliverance start expecting him to deliver you if you need salvation start expecting God's going to save me if you need God to put your marriage together start expecting God to do that we ain't sitting around twiddling our thumbs and just waiting no we're waiting under expectation expectation is actually a state of Readiness knowing that you're about to receive what you're looking for he said' but see God told him to separate himself from his all his Kindred he said God could never bless him till he obeyed fully and as long as his father hung and caused him trouble and lot caused trouble it wasn't until he separated himself and got away from all the unbelief and he shook away from all that then God came down and talked to him and something happened Hallelujah I was just going over some of the services there on YouTube of the last couple of camps and I remember watched the part brother Ben Ericson was leading service the first I think it was the first camp on Sunday morning he said he said I just thought I was going to just do a relaxed you know we had that long prayer line Saturday night so I thought we just have a relaxed uh relax song service and sing a few songs he said but said I had a real moment last night he just breaks up and all a sudden he just breaks forth of how God had delivered him and how God had set him free and begins to sing a song and the joy of God filled the building why because God came and changed his expectation God met him there at that moment and it changed everything listen God can meet you amen how many how many wants that how many wants a Moses moment to meet that Pillar of Fire how manyan wants that moment like even even David had to kill your Goliath and Samson had to grab something that seemed so insignificant and whoop down a thousand Philistines this is where we're at we're of the same race we're the same people so we should have the same expectation that's right he said and when we get all the little disbelieving Spirits away from us where we can really take God at his word and I don't care what so and so said or so and so does God made a promise and I'm going to stand right there on it then God will go to answering then God will go to answering remember he blessed him and he kept him so forth fed him led him from one place to another but he never fully blessed him and give the promise until he completely separated himself from every little thing of the world he let his nephew go down to Sodom he let the father his father his father-in-law or father died then God told him rise and look at the land and I'll give it to look East North West South think that I think that's the way if a church a people ever comes to a place where they completely separate themselves from the things of the world then you can look through every promise in the Bible it's all yours it's like a great big arcave by one Spirit were baptized into it some people just come down by the Holy Ghost baptism and say Well thank the Lord I got in thank the Lord I'm here that isn't it amen get up and go through all the land it all belongs to you that's the way when I come into Christ I want to look around I want to know how he saved me I don't know I want to know where he's taking me to that's the way it is with Christians today they fail to examine every promise that is there it is all yours but be expecting it healing is yours salvation is yours Joy is yours peace is yours amen every promise in the Bible is yours and when a man's filled with the Holy Spirit God gave him a checkbook amen with Jesus name wrote on the bottom of it fill it out don't be afraid to write it it out send it in he'll send down the Bountiful blessings upon you what he promised Moses again going back to him he's like Lord seemed like you forgot about it it's been 400 years but he comes into this Burning Bush and he hears a voice says I've heard their cries I've seen their afflictions I have come down to deliver them and I'm sending you Moses you go tell Pharaoh let my people go he has seen your suffering hello well nobody knows what I'm going through he has seen your suffering he has seen the doctor say I can't do no more and he'll come down in the form of the Holy Spirit to take over if you'll let him be expecting him to do that be expecting him to do that knowing that he promised to do it hold on to his word he said he would do it therefore be expecting it Simeon a man of great reputation old sage sitting there had a great reputation among the people he was an H honorable man you imagine an old man about 80 something years old going around saying well you know I'm not going to die until I see the Lord's Christ you can imagine some of the rabbis saying you know that poor little fell is just pitiful he can't even hardly stand up straight anymore he kind of talking out of his head what's he talking about he's going to see the Lord's Christ we've been looking for thousand 4,000 years for the Messiah and he's going to see him before he dies huh that's the way they look at us when they say we're going to have when we say we're going to have a body change when we say the Rapture is going to take place when we say the dead in Christ is going to rise when we say we're going to be those that are alive and remain they look at us like we're crazy amen that is where it was you know I mean goodness Sime and since Eden our people have look for the Messiah and here we are in Roman captivity you know it's been everything it's been it's closed we're we're in bondage we're not even a nation no more we're broke up and we we have no hope and here this old man with one foot in the grave and the other leaning leaning there getting close and yet he say he's going to see the Lord's Christ they say my that'll never happen that'll never happen this is what the devil wants to tell you that'll never happen you ain't going to get that that'll never happen you ain't going to receive that healing that'll never happen you ain't going to receive the Holy Ghost that'll never happen well I tell you do what God said for you to do and you will receive it if you meet it according to what what he has required God is required to answer [Applause] back Simeon knew it was going to happen some of them young rabbis yeah just leave him alone he's harmless he won't hurt nobody but he's just going around testifying he's going to see this and do that going to live to see the Messiah well s what why you reason what what makes you say such a thing when David looked for him and Elijah looked for him and Prophets of all we've looked through for and forever age and now days of Miracles are passed and everything's darkened out 400 years since we had a prophet Malachi was here you know and and you you're coming to say you're not going to die until you see the Messiah how you going for I had been it has been revealed to me by the Holy Ghost that's right this was his foundation it has been revealed to me by the Holy Ghost this must be your foundation your foundation cannot be your daddy or your mama or anything else or your foundation can't be some kind of medical reasonings or medical ideas or or psychology that cannot be your foundation your foundation has to be the Holy Ghost there's his foundation when the the Holy Spirit reveals it to you and it's according to the word there's nothing going to stop it that's hello somebody there's nothing going to stop it when it's revealed to you by the Holy Spirit and you look here and it's promised in the word now you can have all kind of ideas and say well the Lord spoke to me but if it ain't in the word it wasn't the Lord I found a lot of people can make God the biggest liar you get what I'm saying well the Lord told me this and the Lord told me this and the Lord told me this and the Lord never does what they say he's going to do somebody's lying and I got my Su suspicions who it really is cuz I know God doesn't lie if he says it's going to happen it's going to happen and if you have been in that situation where you said the Lord's going to do this and it ain't happen you need to repent say God I'm sorry for lying amen why because amen because why God ises not a liar what he says he will do people have been revealed for years that you know different years what night and this this year the Lord's coming the Lord spoke to me and this is the year and it goes by and it don't happen you think they repented no they come up with another year well the Lord said this is going to be this way and the Lord said that and it don't ever happen and it goes by and it didn't happen instead of repenting they come up with other ideas of what the Lord said if God made the promise though you got to stay there no matter what the circumstances areen if you say well I got cancer I got TB it that doesn't have nothing to do with it if God reveals to you you're going to be healed you stay there God keeps every promise he said you know there's Jonah in the belly of the well he said you talking about symptoms he had a lot of symptomss he had a real case of symptoms he was in the whale's belly with his hands and feet tied and down in the belly of that well and a bunch of vomit at the bottom of a stormy sea now he had a lot of symptoms but if you looked this way it was whale's belly he looked this way it was wh's belly vomit everywhere he said there's nobody here in that bad a shape I don't think but you know what he said they are nothing but ly vanities that's right amen I won't believe them what did he say once more will I look to your Holy Temple and pray cuz there had been a promise given If my people look to this Holy Temple and pray they'll hear from the Lord and so he had a promise and so he knew it' been on that dedication day that Solomon dedicated said Lord if th people be in trouble anywhere and look towards this Holy Temple they will hear from heaven and he knew God heard that man's prayer and he had faith in it and he was expecting God to move amen maybe the fish had taken down to the bottom of the bottom of the ocean but he was expecting God to do something because he had met every requirement come on somebody God had made the promise and he believe it and if Jonah under those circumstances could have a miracle work like that because God Amen from God because it was according to his word how much more could he do for you if he promised he's a Healer he's a deler deler he's a satisfier he's a joy Giver he's everything that you have need of and so much more he said how much more can you call any kind of disease a lying vanity I don't believe it sister Jeanie told me one day she said I want what I have addressed as defeated I don't even want to call it cancer I want to call it defeated cuz that's truly its name come on that'll cause you to look at something a lot different won't it cancer I don't know sugar diabet defeated back broken Calvary just a bluff has no abilities whatsoever ever unless God has allowed it to happen so and if God allows it then it's God's will but God also has a will and it's his word and his word said by his stripes I'm Healed so therefore I can look at what I have it's not and not call it by the name the devil or the doctor wants to give it cancer or this that and the other some some some name I'm not even concerned about that there's only one name for the devil come on one name for for the devil defeated one name for the devil defeated one name for the devil defeated amen if you look at your enemy as not some big giant but a defeated giant if you look at cancer not as some big thing but a defeated thing come on and it allow your expectation to build up and your faith to rise up that if it's defeated already then why do I have to fear it I don't have to fear something like that God has given me the victory over it God has given me peace in the middle of my battle that he's going to take care of me and I can have this expectation he will move he will touch he will heal what if it don't happen right now it'll happen after a while that's right if it don't happen today it'll happen tomorrow if it don't happen tomorrow it'll be next week whenever it's going to happen God knows cuz God says so there you are now you're getting down to where you have faith hello now you're getting down to where you have faith be expecting it what God said he would do God will do expectations whatever you expect is usually what you get if you don't expect anything out of a service you're not getting nothing out of a service if you expect to find fault you'll find it if you expect to find mistakes yep devil show you mistakes he said you heard about a lady that prayed for the mountain to be moved and got up the next morning looked out the window and said just as I expected still there that's the reason it's still there cuz that what that's what she was expecting for it to be this quote said you want to have an expectation all the way from the heart soul body and mind that God is going to give you an outpouring of the Holy Spirit I feel it it is near us and God is willing and ready to give it if you expect it that's what you shall receive maybe you didn't have no expectations getting on this bus but may God give you something tonight maybe it just Chang say Lord lift up my expectations maybe I ain't expecting enough cuz if I'm going to get what I expect I want to expect a lot cuz God's unlimited he's not just handing out little portions here and little portions there and little portions here and little portions there we get this idea that he's the only guy no he's unlimited so if you want I be under expectation that I'm going to get a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit how many young people want to expect that I'm going to get a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit now hold up a minute some of you ain't getting on the bus but that don't mean you can't lift your hands is that what you're expecting how how many just open it up to the whole floor how many is expecting to get a great outpour of the Holy Spirit how many's Desiring that how many's wanting that how many's longing for that how many's looking for that man if we'll come under that expectation sometimes you wonder you know when as a song leader you get up and from the word go man man the power of God's moving songs are going just right the specials are lining up just right and the power of God comes down and just moves and then you can come and sing the same songs and do all the same things or sing a different song doesn't matter what you do bang your head against the pull pit and people just sit there and look at you I found out I really believe it's expectations it's a spirit of expectation and it comes and it gets a hold of us and you might be just getting up on a Sunday morning and all of a sudden something starts moving on the inside of you man God's going to do something today I never forget just right out here in the dirt amen was pushing dirt brother Wayne said the Holy Spirit comeing upon him on the Dozer and said I'm going to do something significant tonight he said he just began to expect it he quit worrying about needing to study quit worrying about what he was going to preach and quit worrying about everything cuz God said I'm going to do something significant I said well I ain't never heard that kind of voice well you've read the word where he said I'll be there where two or three are gathered what if he's here he's here to do something significant he's here to move he's here to touch he's here to heal he's here to deliver he's here to fill with the Holy Ghost he he's here to save he he's here to bring you out out of the darkness of this life and into the light of the word he's here to move on your behalf why can't we have that expectation every service God's going to do something significant today we saw what God did we saw him give strength to a woman that had a brain bleed and couldn't hardly stand on her two on two feet be be led into a prayer line and God move on her on her life and she raised her hands for another two hours standing over there on the side of that old church and with their hands raised up in the air giving praise to God we saw a little boy come up being covered up with hundreds of warts and just a few moments all those warts were gone we saw expectations of a little 16y old girl what did those expectations bring what did it provide what what did it produce amen I want my brother back I I want him serving God and within a few minutes of her expectation here he come come on somebody God is going will move according to our expectation amen so we shouldn't worry about what's this and what's that and what's going on and get caught up in all the the ups and downs but just look at what God can do if he can heal today or if he healed yesterday he can heal today if he saved yesterday he can save today if he put families back together back then he can put families back together today if he brought prodical home then he can bring prodical home today if God is still the same yesterday today and forever so we can have the same expectation that God's going to move that God's going to touch hearts that God's going to change lives that God's going to set people on fire for his glory and for his honor and the Holy Ghost can be poured out Upon Our Lives let him fall in this service oh God expectations what it begins to do and I ain't got time to get all into it but it actually under expectations it actually changes the atmosphere if you're expecting a bad time you're probably going to have a bad time but if you're expecting something wonderful something good ever heard that song I just feel like something Good's about to happen I do too I just feel like something good is on his way how about let's have a bus trip on the way up there like we do on the way back that's let's change them expectations giving praise to God and Thanksgiving that God's allowed me to be called in this generation in these moments in these closing moments of time to be his son to be his daughter to be a young person in this message that can hold a banner high and wave it and give God praise no matter what listen you you churches are dying out in the world especially in the Baptist Realms and the denominational Realms they're dying the young people are gone I've been asked so many times what kind of programs do you use to have that many young people people come here and they come off from visiting or whatever and they look around like wow look y'all got a church full of young people and they blows their minds listen young people y'all are the life of this church if there's any future in this church is you amen cuz one day our lives will be played out if God tear I I yes I'm looking expecting for the coming of the Lord amen but if it continues on one day we'll we'll be moved off the scene and then you'll have to take it step into place and others will come up behind you and others will come and take the places that you're sitting now and you'll move into other places that you never thought was possible I never thought I would be in this I never thought I would be married I never thought I'd have children I never thought I'd have grandchildren and all of a sudden before you know it your whole life is gone yes right so you're a vital part of this church that's why we invest the money that we doing to you come on now let's just be real for a moment as we bring this down that's why we that's why we have the place out there for y'all to come together and to enjoy each other's company and be away from worldly influences and things and be able to come together and have Fellowship one with the other amen that's why we invest the time and the efforts that's why brother Aaron and brother Jackson and brother Matthew and their wives are getting on the bus with you amen because they're expecting amen God to move on your behalf amen it's vital amen it's vital that if we ain't just passing down a knowledge or passing down amen a learn Behavior or passing down something we can't pass you down the Holy Ghost you have to receive it on your own but if you'll go expecting you shall receive amen so don't don't look at it just another trip or just another time of a good time say God I need something this weekend I need to have a personal visitation with you I need to have a personal audience with you I need to have that Pillar of Fire experience in my own life that I can say like David said oh God Thou Art my God not just somebody else's not just somebody back there brother so and so wow good Christian brother sister so and so wow look at that but no God wants you to have that moment that personal moment with him be expecting it be looking for it on the first service from the word go be an anticipation God what do you have for me tonight those that'll be here Sunday well I don't know brother Timothy half the church is going to be going it doesn't matter has nothing but I was expecting God to move cuz his word word said he would listen if he can't trust you with three he can't trust you with 300 if you don't have the same attitude towards three people you you can't have the right attitudes toward 300 people and so here here here I was preaching and under this load to deliver something and the brother got up and he said you know I just went to the doctor and he said I thought all I didn't know what was about to happen but since I heard the word today I know God's in control of my situation and my faith is in him no matter what I go through and he turned from that moment of fear amen back to Faith again and he's still living today amen why because somebody decided I'm not going to look at the numbers I'm not going to look at the empty pews I'm going to look at what God said he would do where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be Hallelujah let's come neigh service with that same expectation doesn't matter if nobody else is on my Pew I'm going to have a good time anyhow doesn't matter if anybody else is around me it's praising

that you'll just move out the hindrances and things that would be in the way and where that the Holy Spirit then could flow totally free and could move them in Realms higher than what they've ever walked before Lord Jesus there's many dangers upon the highways and byways Lord but our trust is in you we just ask the angels of God will surround them and keep them be with the drivers Lord may they be alert through the night and be able to arrive safely tomorrow and bring him back home again safe Lord when the time to return but oh Jesus I pray father for every heart that you'll just prepare it
