by will you speak to me today will you deal with me and my need my situation just lift a hand to God and say Lord right here where I am just meet my need father we bless your name today and thank you for the privilege to serve in you what an opportunity that we have Lord to come bow before the throne of grace we can find help in our time that need Nord we need your father today we're asking for your Holy Spirit to just speak to us but you revealed yourself to us in a great way today manifest your glory in our midst heal the sick Lord wherever they are or God lifts up their butt down hearted give an open up there the eyes of the blind and set the captive free Lord o open up our eyes today to understand eNOS to the power that we're living in lord I pray O God as we have this little reprieve and this little wake-up call this little moment Lord will weaken as a song would say Selah pause and think on this but we just stopped for a moment and think of where we're at in time as it blends over into eternity and make our way Lord toward the promise of God that is given for this age and this time we ask it in the name of Jesus amen amen god bless you thank you brothers for your your company today and coming out here on this kind of a stormy day but it's Easter amen and we're here to honor the resurrection of our Lord Jesus I trust wherever you are that you are under the blessings of God and already as we have sung the great songs of Zion and hearing Adrianna's sing a moment ago you know daughters of Zion Abraham's sons hear the word of your father amen I hear your promise of love it's it's our hour it's our time to hear our promise and God is calling us to attention in this hour and I think it is a wonderful time that we're in I'm thankful for this time just forever everyone to make their call in an election sure to draw nigh to God as we procrastinate I'm prophecies being fulfilled this year things are very different due to the circumstances that are beyond our control as you know we're not having youth camp although we want to thank brother Michael Dexter and his team for the virtual youth camp that we had where we have everyday play back some of the services past and in case you were a part of that well today is the climax service of that so um his son it's not quite sunrise service but it is Easter morning and for 33 years now I've not had a for service at our church but here we are today and it's Easter and this is a resurrection kind of all of its own it's I guess sad been 33 years since I'm priest and Easter due to hosting the youths in Louisiana youth camp and this would have been our 34th camp I think and so but due to the situation's is going on worldwide that we're not able to have the youth camp this year but we still have it and we were blessed and the Holy Spirit moved in hearts that were hungry for God amen I'd like to turn to mark chapter 16 and verse 1 and as you're looking that for that scripture mark 16 verse 1 I think about this being that we started the youth camp in 1987 and I not had a an actual Easter service in our church since then and meant the the last one that we had was in her old wooden building way back there long before we built the the other one in 1990 dedicated in 1996 and so we never had an Easter service that I ministered in in those years and the in the other church after the old beldam that we met in so this would be the first Easter service we've had in the new church amen I welcome you to be a part of this today as we deserve the Word of God and and turning with me to March 16 verse 1 and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall away the stone from the door of the sepulchre and when they look they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed with a long garment and they were affrighted and he said unto them be not a frightened you seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified He is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee and there shall you see him as he said unto you and they went quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid and when Jesus was risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils god bless you gonna let you have your seats now but I will have several more Scripture readings that I would like to share this morning Joel chapter 2 and verse 21 I think this is very pertinent to this time and to this moment because he says fear not notice these were the same words that the angel said don't be a frightened fear not o öland be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things be not afraid he beast of the fields for the pastures of the wilderness do spring for the tree Bharath her fruit the victory and the vine to yield her strength be glad then he children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will come down cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat in the facts shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palma worm my great army which has sent among you and ye shall eat him plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt one Dursley with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and he said come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids and those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke and the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be delivered as the Lord has said and then the remnant who the Lord shall call and then if you'll give me one more scripture and that will be Luke 24 and in verse one notice we've read read one out of mark and now then spoke of Joel in the Old Testament we want to read and it Luke's account of course there is also Luke's Matthews and and John's account which we won't read this morning but let's just honest read this together Luke chapter 24 verse 1 now on the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre and they entered and found not the body of the Lord Jesus but it came to pass they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments and they were afraid and bowed their faces to the earth and they said they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead well wonderful words that we have read that this morning and as we go back to the thought of where we are in this day and time and and we want to just kind of bring it down to our our RJ and make this pertinent for this morning for a subject today I'm going to be speaking on it's Easter and I want to just capitalize upon where we are in time as we face eternity this quote stands out to me and the sermon I know my Redeemer liveth and this great darkness is swinging over the earth now and there's nothing but to declare that light is pressing its way down when death is hanging so close that it could be in an hour and one hour from now the world could meet its death if death is hanging that close what is what is doing it it's life life is coming the resurrection that Easter for all of God's children it is hanging low it is pressing the angels are coming down the Great Holy Spirit is moving in darkness is taking this last toll nothing for the light most certain be here in Christ will come and the glory and the hope of the ages a real resurrection for all believers and where we will share with him in his resurrection as we have shared with him in his suffering he that suffers with me will reign with me all them I'd be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas no I must fight if I must rain increasing my courage Lord said that's my prayer and I must not go alone as a coward I must not go around daily with my head hanging down as if something was terrible when I look at the world and all their darkness and their carrying on I must raise my head and walk with my head among the Eagles knowing this that I know him in the power of his resurrection because he lives we live also because he raised from the dead I shall raise also you shall rise also that's what Easter means to the believer and I think of that today what what does Easter mean and I want to think of that as we as we look and hear brother madam tell us in the Easter seal he says how can I deny that the Bible being the truth that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever and see in the hour that we're living in we need an Easter in the church resurrection we need a resurrection to power men and women to stand up out for that which is God's vindicated word so as I reflect back on the Easter's past and certainly we've had some wonderful times at camp and we had wonderful times in the old church when we rejoiced over Eastern and the great resurrection brother Branham in the last year of his life in the last minute and as he finished up his ministry he preached to Easter sermons and first you know he preached the Easter seal and if you two weeks later he preaches it is the rising of the Sun and in his reflections upon the seal and the end thinking of that myself the seal can be thought of in two ways the seal can mean to close or - shut up or the seal can mean Authority or to authenticate on and the show approval or our proof and so um you have one in that day two thousand years ago they were using a seal that were using a seal to seal up Christ in the tomb and the religious system of that day had asked Pilate secure the tomb put a seal upon it close it up make sure the body remains in the tomb and so again that is one meaning of it the other is where God putting the seal when God proves something and so he also authenticates with the seal a seal of his approval so the denominational world uses a seal to close up artist shut up word that God uses a seal when he seals something he seals it with his approval that's what he does when he feels you with the Holy Ghost is the seal of redemption where he puts us approval upon you he authenticates you and of course this is what Easter was doing was authenticating by the resurrection all the words of Jesus to be the truth and brother Branham would tell us in the true Easter seal he said the world is trying and will get worse all the time to seal Christ back in the tomb again they're trying to make him on a historical God on the one that walked and and back in those days give power to the disciples to heal the sick to cast out devils but what they do that as soon as they thought they got rid of them just like Cain did when he thought he got rid of Abel they sealed him in a tomb and they put him in there and today he says they're trying to keep Christ in a tomb but oh what an Easter morning done and Easter morning ruined all of their theology an Easter morning came for a purpose some 1900 years ago to a church and when it did it went through when the Easter morning came it ruined their theology that cannot keep him in a tomb or oppressed by he said you can put him in a Methodist to more Baptist to more a presbyterian to whatever you want to but he raced out of that tomb he is alive today said I had a Baptist tomb and you might had a Methodist tomb but one day Jesus rose from there from my historical God to a living present God alive forevermore man and so now he said for nineteen hundred years or maybe I could save fifteen or fourteen hundred years he said and I think he's referring to the days of Luke's are there he said where you know where the light of the dawn began to begin to dawn upon the earth of the Reformation and he says but but the seven fourteen or fifteen hundred years ago the churches has had him sealed away and he said but it's under pass and the last days saith god and there's nothing gonna stop it and I want to remind you today even now nothing is gonna stop the Word of God nothing is gonna stop the prophecies that have been spoke for this age to be fulfilled nothing time means nothing to God I just mean nothing to God a man no men's ideas mean nothing to God but I tell you his word will be fulfilled in the hour that it's meant for fulfillment and man the word has went forth there Sammy light in the evening time and he says I don't care how many seals that you trying to put over God will break every seal he broke the seal that it term he broke the seal of hell he broke the seal of death he broke the seal of the great and the elusive there forever more triumphant over death hell and the grave and tombs and every man-made thing to show he was glad and he cannot be sealed away from the people anymore let me tell you every devil there is cannot put him back in the tomb once he raised up nothing can hold him the grave couldn't be dug deep enough and man the stoner couldn't be couldn't be big enough no matter how many tons of me away it was way too big for those women as many of the words to move it around it it was it took a massive amount of effort once that it was sealed but let me tell you it could not be it could not be sealed good enough to hold Christ in the grave nothing could hold him he broke it every seal with that great Easter seal that she was sealed with a man the same seal he said that I wear you're gonna wear it also a man were he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also and greater than T shall you do for I go to my father how are you going to keep it down how you going to keep it sealed up and I'm just gonna say today you're not going to keep the message sealed up hey man this already broke free in there in the Garden of Eden when man said he was sealed out of the garden it was the tree of life was guarded there was no offering appropriated the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin this would be reflected even in the the large veil in the tabernacle when when it was hung there to seal the worshipper from the presence of the Shekinah glory but when the day of pinnacles come brother with Jesus time David Calvary and finish the work he didn't seal man out a man he sealed man inside with himself a man and now we're sealed up and shut up in the presence of the Shekinah glory hey man we got a seal the Bible said grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption and then it shows that sin has been paid for and God has accepted you and you've been sealed into Christ but the baptism of the Holy Ghost and sin is finished and they eat and eat Earls seal has been placed upon you and there's no devil in hell can break that seal a man now we are resurrected today that gives ourselves a resurrection no wonder we can have such joy that we have in victory over the things of God because we have been resurrected and when those he did foreknow he also called and those he called he justified and those he justified he hath glorified he that saw us and eternal past has already seen us in the eternal future and man what because here is only in time where it's past and his future but all that great eternal day he saw us there rejoicing and shouting in the great victory in Christ and here we are in time doing what we did in eternity and we are resurrected with him the Bible said and what does that word mean that we're raised with him were raised with him in the spiritual resurrection you know we're quicken it means that we're made alive that we ourselves have experienced that great resurrection and we who were once dead in sins and trespasses now we are alive and we can never die man we can never be sealed again away from his presence we the devil can no more ever get into us again we're sealed unto the day of redemption so what a difference God sealed is from the from the from the religious world seal God's Word and his seal seals you in with Christ authenticating you securing you putting a seal of approval upon you while the seal of the religious world wants to keep Christ and his anointing in his power and his life away from you keeping you and him just sealed and dead in the tomb but the Easter message is don't tell my disciples I have a risen from the dead hallelujah and you know brother Branham when he would describe this he would use a word essence he said the very essence of this resurrection I want to talk about that word just omit the word yes it means that nature of something that determines its character or the property of something without which it would not exist or be what it is so there there is an essence a property to this resurrection meaning meaning again is something without which it it would not exist or be what it is it makes it what it is that something that makes the resurrection what it is he said the essence of this resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that Jesus has risen from the dead hey man that's what we need I need just a little more sound up here alright now he's not dead but he's living and he lives here he is in us I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world a little wild the world will see me no more yet you will see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world you see now then same essence of the message that's the same essence of the message because it is a resurrection message want to get this this message is a resurrection message where it tells the sufferer the weary the downtrodden a man that you don't have to remain in a downtrodden weary suffering condition but you can rise and be healed delivered a man and ensures that we are the resurrection and the life and this is not a dead message but one of life and it's a message of the resurrection now without this property without this essence the message is worthless here with me tell me what what really would be the meaning of the message if Jesus had went to the tomb and not risen you see the resurrection was the essence of the message it made the message what it was without the resurrection the message would have been invalid man but I want you to know I know I want you to know even this message today without the resurrection life in it the message is worthless it is invalid it is meaningless but this message declares the healer the deliverer has conquered death and that we are the beneficiaries of his resurrection amen now in it is the rising of the Sun brother Branham uses this word again and he says now the very essence the properties of the message that was seared was that he is risen from the dead we are his benefit Aries we share the message that Resurrection with him and draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive and and he says that we cannot do it by word only and we cannot do it by tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to a man notice again the essence of the message he is risen from the dead and man this is what makes the message of value that he's not dead but that is a living he's alive that he's not in the tomb a man whether it's terms of manmade theology and my whether students of religion where is that old tune their tomb that was carved out as a cave and was and he was placed within it matters not and when the essence of the message is he's not dead he's alive and the essence of the entire message is he is he's alive and he's the same yesterday today and forever well what he did he is now what he was he still is he's he I am ever present present tense God now he cannot do it we cannot do it by word only I hear your ministers to say and today well what we need to do is you know it's not that not nothing over the Holy Ghost we need we need a teaching we already got two teaching without two thousand years of teaching without the intense teaching in the last I want to save 56 and fifty five years or so weary that intense teaching hey man maybe I could say 75 years we've got we've had intense teaching but what we need is not just word today we need the light for that word I mean we need to be able to declare he's not just to pluck he's not just to take a man it's not just about a religious system it's not about new buildings it's not about big gatherings it's about him and he's like we can't do it by word only in the Easter seal brother Brennan said Easter I have stepped it in my own heart as the greatest event of the year the greatest event of the year let me tell you friends because we're living in the easter of all Easter's we're living in the greatest event ever perhaps it's as I said the greatest event of all time and I wonder you're saying not only the event that happened 2,000 years ago not the celebration today where thousand J millions of preachers are talking about a past event but this lunar we're not talking about a past event man we are talking about a present event we are in another Easter it is another resurrection our a man it's Easter if I get kidding across the church I'm not talking about your calendar I'm not talking about the day set aside I'm talking about this day this hour this time we're living in it's Easter it's resurrection out it's rupturing time it's the last days it's the greatest event of all time happening right now and you're a part of it man you may be at this moment sad disillusioned you know confuse you know well he said he was a prophet and and he would do this and and time has went on and we thought this would be whoa what would deliver us in and where is this promise rapture and maybe you're all confused and wondering and pondering and sad and disheartened but I want to announce to you this morning again it's Easter oh man he's risen some are going the other way and disillusioned and on the way to Emmaus but I'll tell you ever see that God is going to find and you'll find you this morning no matter where you are perhaps for a moment let's take and go back in our thinking for a little bit you know before Jesus coming there have been great men there had been great mighty prophets like Moses Elijah there had been teaching priests like Ezra there had been Kings like David and Solomon and great leaders but finally that they arrived from mankind to be delivered from the tyranny of sin and the same is true I want to I want to just compare the two Easter's because as I've been saying we are in and Easter there was an Easter we are banana Easter we are now in Easter so let's let's compare that with today the same is true of today there have been great moves of God in the past there's been a loser and Wesley and finis and moody wiglesworth and buz Worthen and lower I'm on everybody maybe have their favorites of great men of God down to the ages that you could call their names but that must come at Easter where the chance moves and the power of the Resurrection like brother madam said of today he compared the bride with the church that's two cars and he said those that were shiny right off the assembly line filled with gas or the highest octane but one with her with it with only mechanics a great machine with no dynamics and the other with both dynamics and mechanics it's kind of like a bird takes two wings to fly hey man you got out the word and the spirit you gotta have the mechanics and the dynamics and by the way brother branham's said as far as the movement as far as where he was as far as the ages past we had put too much stress on the mechanics and I put nothing on the dynamics no wonder the church doesn't get off the ground spins around and around and around with this little one wing dance word one word we got the word with the word with the word bright with the word people and my wherewithal that's true but what good of it if the other wing isn't there spinning around and around the circle of malachite for Malecha for God sent a prophet revelation Tim seven the seven seals rope and we're in the seven set why is all your noise about unless the dynamics or their with the mechanics to make the church rise in faith rise in glory rise in power rise and resurrection faith him out and his brother Brandon would look back he says there have been churches churches Brides Brides churches brides bride but there's gotta come on hey man hallelujah there's gonna come a real bride now listen church he wasn't saying they've kind of come another message they've got to come another prophet he was saying there's gonna come a bride a man there's got to come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it and makes that Churchill live and moving the power of the resurrection missile until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs and now what good does it do to give her a facelift or putt or is this a simonized job which is a polishing job when when there's no dynamics to it no matter how much the mechanics proved to be right there's got to be a dynamics to make it work a man now before Jesus came there had been great man there had been a Moses a lawgiver on Elisha the restorer there were the songs of David the wisdom of Solomon the prophecies of the prophets but now came the word that they were all affected reflecting and it was all bottled up now in the man Christ Jesus if I could say it this way in paraphrasing this and the Easter seal he said before there had been prophets on the earth who had prophesied before him and they had healed the sick raised the dead done great signs that Jesus did remember Easter proved it it's sealed or authenticated the word forever for the true believer all gloom and doubt were shattered at that blissful morning a man who had been shut up as it was in a prison house even religious people before this day because it's in great religious moves and Moving's of the holy spirit and so forth but when a man died it just seemed to settle it you know man your Moses died and he just seemed you know well his law and all of that feeds us a great event in history wouldn't spirit of God had come down upon the mountain and through and carved it out in stone Joshua died and then the Israel went into doing whatever man thought was right in his own eyes but when Jesus came he said I have the power to lay my life down and I have the power to take it up again Moses couldn't say this man Joseph couldn't say this Jeremiah couldn't say this but Jesus said it and then he proved what he said and brother Brendan to me that was the seal of it when something is said and then it's turned around and prove them a man if that had not happened what Jesus would have just been a booster someone who made great claims but had nothing to back it up but I want you to know it wasn't just great claims that Jay on that Easter morning a man he had laid his life down and now was raising it up again and the days of Jesus you know were very supernatural times that parallel our time they were the closing of the Old Testament and an old coming and we're the closing of a new covenant how many believes that we're in the closing of the New Covenant though we're the last age and the final voice to the final age the days of Jesus was a very supernatural time where heaven was pouring out his message I want you to understand this is why even even um Peter could pull that prophecy right there that God was pouring out his spirit now heaven was pouring out his message an angel appears to Zechariah now even been thousands I almost hundreds at least of years since there had been a real visitation of the supernatural if you know between Malachi the last look in our Bible in the opening of New Testament it seems a very short distance because all that you do is just flip a page from Malachi to Matthew but in there lays hundreds of years and there you know all of a sudden actor along the winter time after long series of droughts of not hearing the voice of God that seeing an angel of God it seemed like God had forgot his promise but I want you to know God never forgets a promise and when he starts something into action it will continue there might be seasons like between Jesus twelve twelve years old and coming out at thirty years old there was seasons do we we don't see anything happening we don't see anything moving but it was moving anyway things was maturing moving in the place getting ready for the appearing of the forerunner and then would come the day the Messiah right behind him now here there at that moment in time suddenly appears to Sakurai a priest of the lineage of Levi and he's there and it's his course to go in and offer um the the sacrifice and and then they and the incense to be poured out and it's his job to to pour this out and and to to let the the prayers of the people who are under expectation from Messiah and they're crying Lord send your Messiah Lord send your Messiah Lord said that during Israel is expecting a child my Elizabeth you know she is also been longing for a child and she has been crying to God Jane after day months after months and now she's past days and maybe her prayers are less and maybe she's given up maybe it's hopeless now and maybe is her timer or with women is now ceased and has been for years and all of a sudden here an angel appears appears to to Zechariah and there you know the angel begins to give a message and since God is anointing and sending out of forerunner and he's going to prepare the way for the Messiah and the angel disappears and then and then they're visitations are due to Mary of Gabriel who comes to her and says you know you're a highly favored you're gonna bring forth the trial and his name shall be called Jesus and and the message comes and then the visitation comes and anointings hit Elizabeth and hits Mary and she gives a salutation and to Elizabeth and the prophecies come forth and Anna and Simeon as we all prophesy of what God is doing angels break through the dimensions to Shepherds and John comes on the scene as a forerunner announcing there's one of the mungyu and he's here he's here you know standing among you somewhere and there then a life like a dove then a voice comes out of heaven and then it annoys a man of carpenter a little carpenter's son and there he is baptized in the water and the dub feels him and he's led of the Spirit and anointed now and then he moves out into his ministry and at that time they work on say a decreasing of the messenger as he moves off the scene and his message is now in flash as Jesus begins to demonstrate God to the world are you with me and brother man would say and what is attraction on the mountain is about that I'm the Prophet turned and said behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world now what is the attraction and he said it's changed from the Prophet to his prophecy you see it was just continuing and unfolding of the same angelic visit are you with me romantic that moves there from the you know dare upon Zachariah moving upon Elizabeth moving upon Mary moving upon Simeon move it upon Anna moving on John moving down and comes now and the prophecy here it comes in Jesus Christ now these junctions are so hard for people you find people even over years later in acts 19 who had missed the junction there were disciples of John but they didn't know Jesus and his resurrection there were baptized and John but didn't know the one he pointed to you know I it's hard for me sometimes to to grasp how that men could stand there and see Jesus pointed out as the one who knew John said I bear witness I saw the Doug come on him and how how then you know would there still be disciples of John and baptize him with John and still carrying on and even a group of John's disciples some many years later who didn't know Jesus who didn't know his resurrection who didn't know the power of the Holy Ghost who didn't even know the correct water baptism didn't even recognize the one he was pointing to they had idolized the man Danah idolized his boldness they thought they were ready for the Messiah but they didn't know the Messiah had come was already crucem five rescinded and sit back his holy spirit of changed forms again by the time dozer Knights 19 caught up he'd already changed forms again he was no longer in the man of Galilee now he was in a multi-member body the Saint Jesus and the effects of the angel had just moved forward now into a church we hear him today still talking about the forerunner who brought the message there's still enamored infatuated to the point of enchantment about the forerunner and they've never ever seen the one he was pointing to this is true about Jesus even today men are enchanted with the man of gallery they are talking about the resurrection Easter sermons men priests everywhere he's not dead he's risen he's risen and they're talking about the resurrection but I wouldn't say fruit if Jesus had only risen and that had completed everything we would still be in our sins hallelujah that resurrection power had to come in the hearts of the church a man they had to be participants in the resurrection themselves not you seeing him come out of the tomb not just witnessing the angel but they themselves receive the eternal life on the inside that happened on that day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came like a like a mighty rushing wind and a pillar of whipping fire and the angel of the Lord the angel of his presence came down and ascended into Everhart you see they had to participate in the resurrection they had to become the resurrection also not just know that he rose from the dead that's knowledge not just to know that but to know they had risen with him and that's what Jesus pointed to remember Jesus he pointed him something he did not he did not point back to his cross or treason - he pointed ahead to the city of Jerusalem - and he said go and wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high until you yourself get this resurrection power on the inside of you until you become the Easter sea he was crucified by the church world crucified and put in a tomb on the third day he rose bringing with him the Old Testament Saints ascended into heaven with him then 50 days later his Holy Spirit comes on the day of Pentecost notice there in the upper room the resurrection happened again that's the quickening power struck 120 and they were filled with the Spirit of Jesus the Holy Ghost now God was in his church like I said before before he was there in in the in Jesus Christ we could even go beyond that we can see the angel of God moving in John the Baptist now we see it's here and it's smooth and it's not moving into Jesus Christ now it moves from Jesus right into the church now the same Jesus not another Jesus but the same Jesus is working through multiple body call the church and they were resurrected from death to life it was a spiritual resurrection the visions 2 and 5 Paul begins to teach this and expound and explain said even when we were dead and since we were dead just as dead as Jesus was in the tomb we were dead in sins and hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved well that's what quicken means made alive with together with Christ and it raised us up together and made us sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that was the church now unfortunately just as it happened with Israel receiving their Pentecost were the law came to them fifty days after and they would finally disintegrate into and a whoring group of people and become away and scattered even so the second Eve like the first Eve Satan got into the book of Acts Church in the time of waiting in the time of teryan now it changed this form like a seed planted and it changed this farming out of the seed comes life but it's now in a different form is not in seed form it's now in a little leaf it starts to push his way up through the soil roots began to go down and so the same thing would happen with the church but Satan would get a knee in the book of Acts Church come and saying we don't need this here shouting we don't need speakers and tongues what we need to do is sweetie word and we need to take that word and tweak it and tweak the gospel and they tweaked it until God was no longer one but three and they tweaked it until Jesus was no longer the intercessor but Mary and they tweaked it until the days of miracles were not present but and soon the experience of the real baptism of the Holy Ghost was lost from the church and the power was gone and the church plotted along and dead forms as they put Christ back in the tomb I like to did with the body of Christ a you don't chuck the body that had been mangled by Roman creeps and spiced it made it to smell good and dressed it and prepared it for death but then came the age of reformation with Luther and Wesley and then Azusa Street and the seasons were changing I want you to know Easter is always at a time when seasons are changing right now you hear the news that in Louisiana we're having storms that are coming across this area because it's like his winter is trying to make its last hoorah and push spring back we have the flowers and one where crops are being planted we have trees that are butting out and the pecans which is the last of the trees we had already now beginning to bud but then a war in the heavens us is trying to make its final stand and in those moments or tornadoes and storms and winds hail and rain and fierceness but no matter what attracts it can never put spring back it's coming out anyhow hallelujah because the Sun have setting into motion man and the rays of light and the days have got long and no matter what the clouds tried to do and the wind's tried to do it will never bring it back man it can never stop spraying from coming and I just want to tell your church no matter what kind of storms are out there no matter what kind of demons that we are facing no matter what kind of age and a ruthless and godless age that where is he can they can never ever put Christ and his bride back in the tomb they maintain never stopped these men because here we're at the changing of the season and it is the rising of the Sun and the light is signing a memo are we on Earth Day today a rise and shine for thy light has come and his glory it's been seen upon yet [Music] there is no way that they can ever stop it comes the age and Reformation with Luther Wesley Azusa Street season is changing suddenly a forerunner comes like John the Baptist this is not only testified on the Ohio River with brother Branham is preaching and and baptized in his 17th person and there the voice comes out of heaven saying this john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun his second was not only there but the Pentecostals they would prophesy the same thing over and again standing and the means never heard the prophecy before and we begin to prophesy the spirit fallen upon men and women and they prophesy and under the anointing as termed the balance and of course it would be after that happened in 1933 that an angel appears in 1946 and restoration begins now would you understand there have been times of reformation but this is not a Reformation this is a restoration a man the season was changing as a forerunner comes and an angel visit and restoration begins and sue not only is it John the Baptist were the Ministry of Elijah but also we begin to see the very Ministry of Christ is repeated again what was it not only was the tomb sealed revelation five shows a book that was sealed without its opening all is lost unless it's given back to man it's all for nothing Calvary is for nothing the resurrection is for nothing a man just as if Jesus just resurrected and appeared as disciples raised the dead of the ages but didn't send a resurrection and it changed for those waiting a Pentecost it'll been all for nothing would have meant nothing to us in the 120 or even us today notice the seventh seal was breaking it was open breaking the silence of his coming there was the revelation of it certainly that we received in this day but there was an actual time where that we are in that time of that seventh seal where that where the coming of the Lord is in manifestation and this coming wood began it would actually begin we can really really see it take form as a forerunner comes on the scene with signs and wonders and miracles things that are happening revelation 8:1 says when he opened the Seventh Seal that silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour and I saw that seven angels which stood before God and to them that were given seven trumpets notice there was a time that is represented by half-hour silence it's symbolic that there would be a time that something was silence that was kept back from the church that the church would go through these days can I say ages of science hey man where the mysteries of God would wait until the end time but finally another angel come man stood at the altar having a golden censer it was they given him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came up with the prayers of saints ascended up before God and the Angels hand and the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire the altar and cast into the earth notice what's happened in the heavenly realms now comes down to the earth and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and an earthquake and seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound now we can look right here in our day and know that incense has been mixed with the prayers on the altar and they have been received before God just like then the days of Zechariah there were many offerings of incense many days many years year after year after year but this day was different this day an angel stood down and he said God's heard your prayers the incense has reached God the prayers have come into his presence and now is the time to fulfill this promise I'm sending the forerunner hallelujah oh man the thing there that had wondered about all their lives now the silence is broken now it's no more silence things begin to happen things begin to materialize and take place and now comes the appearance of their angel and starts to John starts a chain of events like an explosion that never stops starts there were the angel coming to Zacharias moves on to Elizabeth they are to Mary and then Elizabeth and Elizabeth and on and on and on as they keep some move and expand and expanded until it brings them asylum to see until it Breezer the death the barrel the resurrection and brings the Holy Ghost right there on the day of Pentecost and this is what God is doing in this last day as the prayers of the saints that have prayed for this day and prayed for this hour let me tell you church we're no longer in the days of silence we're in the days of the boss remember God has sounded out his word and there have been thunders and lightnings and earthquakes and upheavals in the world and even we're experiencing right now but I just want you to know it's God breaking the silence as it moves from one phase to another now the same in our day the churches look for for the return of Jesus Christ he's been expected Elizabeth was expecting Israel was expecting a man and now his word was about to be fulfilled D and it comes with it begins initiates with the coming of an angel and and then and then of course today's same in our day that the thing the church has been looking for we have been under expectancy like Israel for 2,000 years seven Gentile Church ages hey man we've been looking for the return of Jesus Christ a man ever is coming for a mature church without spot or wrinkle hallelujah and before we can meet him in the air receive that promise sir the church has gotta be ready there's got to be a virgin spoke to that's gotta be I've been an easel appear to her and give her the greetings and say you're chosen to bring forth Christ back to this age and I want you to know through that's what this angel was sent to do it was to tell you you have been selected you have been chosen you have been ordained you have been called for this hour and there's great favor about your life because you are the aged the people the time to bring forth the promised son but to do that there has to be an angel here and I bring a message so therefore in 1946 the world is stunned by the claims of a little Kentucky preacher as they see it vindicated a syndicated sealed of vindicating by signs and wonders as an angel comes to humble men of God little did we know but that coming would be manifesting and we would see in the coming of that ministry we would see both the Ministry of Elijah as John the Baptist the forerunner and the Ministry of Christ all wrapped up in one messenger and vindicated by signs and wonders now what do I want to get a picture now remember there in the days of Jesus it would be it would be John and Jesus but I want you to know in this ministry meanest day it would be both ministries the Ministry of John a prophet and the Ministry of Christ wrapped up in one ministry as God promised that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound that mystery of God would be finished now and he said now as Moses was given two signs the angel as I said would appear in brother Branham at the age of 37 and there in an old cabin speaking to an angel here here this angel would appear he would walk light would shine walk headed a 200-pound like man standing with his arms folded no beard hair down his shoulder olive complexion and look there and brother Branham the same I've come to tell you about your misunderstood life in your mysterious ways don't fear I'm sent from the presence of God and he would be in explain to him and give him his commission and said as Moses was given to sign now why is Muslim because we're in the nether Exodus remember the first Easter reached is really Passover so the first Passover was in Egypt come on now your your next Passover which is of significance is now in in Jerusalem and there at the Passover the land the true Lamb of God is offered but I want you to know we're in another Easter a man without that Easter back yonder in the days of Moses Jesus would not have been possible there had to be a people that were expecting the Messiah there had to be laws that were given out of whom would come a virgin there had to be everything set in place for the Messiah to come somebody with me then that pie that Passover gave way another Passover now here we are in another Passover amen today is another Easter as I'm saying as I'm preaching it's his their church I'm out I'm here now in this time an angel comes and he gives two signs as he gave to Moses he said now you got to get the people to believe and these signs are going to be to get you people to believe and to get them out of Egypt into the Promised Land and so the sign would now be given and and the first was a sign in his hand as he would take the the the person by their Allah by their right hand and he would hold it with his left and it would show a sign in the hand as Moses would show the sign in the hand puts it in the bosom and out comes leprosy and put it back in and then it's healed and and so this would be the sign and he says but if they don't believe the first time that we'll believe the second side and the angel tells them and the second sign will be greater than the verse you'll stay humble and sincere it will come to pass you'll be able to tell about these and the very secrets of the heart and then the people will have to believe you a man this will initiate the gospel in power I want you to get these word this will initiate the gospel in power that will bring on the second coming of Christ a man an Angels visit initiate the second coming as an angel visit you know initiated the coming there to sakurai a-- now an angel comes in and initiate the coming with signs and wonders trying to get our hearts to believing a man come on Sarah before you can receive your brother your promised son you got start believing hey man you got to be turned from unbelief to faith come on you got to start believing your the people is coming through a man that the promise is yours and this coming of the angel assured us in to the coming of the Lord it had initiated showing us a Christ was back in the church doing the same things he did when he was here 2000 years ago this is what Jack lor are you know a friend of my family that we went to his church when I was a boy and visited there and was in brother Bibles meetings but he would write and he would say these words Bible days are here again here's a man that not only not only does he preach what we preach but he demonstrates what we preach he practices he's actually as I say happening what we've been preaching what was it God was showing us in crisis back in the church again after doing the same things that he did 2,000 years ago making those preachers declare Bible days are here again and that resurrection was and a resurrection was happening out of DOC dead denominationalism and signs and wonders were being done in the name of Jesus Christ and as Moses was given new signs of God had promised to give two signs that show that Jesus Christ was here present not a dead God not a ritualistic form but Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1946 it went out with the first sign in the hand and then then and the announcement of the angel of all the ministries that went out only William Branham could say I a gift that was ordained and administered to me by an angel only night after night was the pillar of fire present in his meetings night after night it would show he was present like I said you know some people actually saw it some people saw the form of an angel some saw the pillar of fire one thing they all had to say is nothing but the truth it never fails it always happens right amen what he says is always the truth and then there's not a margin of error in it that's what they all had to say but maybe but there were others like me I didn't see the angel I didn't see the light but I saw the effects I saw it as people were were changed by the presence of the angel and their height was discerned and they're there they're there they're very they're very facial expressions were things as they come into the presence of that angel and there was the announcement of the angel that and then the blind could see and the Deaf could hear and those were imprisoned were set free as crippled walked and deaf heard and cancers were delivered and I want to just make you remember God specifically made sure we understood that cancer is defeated that nothing can stand before our prayers when we believe that even cancer the first sign had been existence for nearly 3 years the blind could see that deaf heard cancers healed all kinds of inconceivable miracles would happen 19 on July 24th in 1949 in Regina Cesc Saskatchewan before 10,000 people at night a middle-aged woman stood before brother branham the pillar of fire was hanging over brother branham could see that melon light and said she noticed she was anxious and a bit nervous and now don't be nervous that's the presence of the Lord and suddenly as he was speaking to her trying to reassure her a vision broke and and she began moving further away from him he said I see becoming much younger than this oh you're it's like a now a classroom lights you and you're sitting at a school desk and oh there's a pin comes flying across the room and strikes you in the eye and you have been blind ever since in that eye and the woman began to scream out and says you know that was me I was not me I was that little girl I've been buying them in my eyes since a little child yes she settled down a minute because that jolted him out of the vision brother Branham suddenly was back in the world of the auditorium Darren stood for a moment and then the vision began again he said I see you again you're you're again much younger than you are now but older than what you were there I you you used to wear your hair and braids and he said I see the braids and the ribbons around the two braids all he says I see a yellow dog now comes running after you and you're scared and you're running and you're running up some steps and and then just as you get it on the porch an older woman looks like your mother opens up the door and you you run inside and she screams out I was me brother branham ah I haven't thought of that for years and again her exclamation brought him out of the vision and as he stood there for a moment looking back looking around looked down at her hand he was holding he says I see you now I see how to see a lady walking very slowly very slowly sister it's you you're struggling to climb some steps at a white house there's something wrong with your back I see you can't get up those steps and now let's see you lean over a flowerbed to your right and you're crying and you said if I can ever get to brother Brandon's meeting it'll all be over and at that at that moment the woman fainted on the platform but something uh sure standing by Carter and gently helped her to the floor and that moment brother Baxter runs to there are microphones at brother Branham this is the second side the aides have told you about God is visiting his people and and suddenly the woman they're laying on the platform sits up in there and gets up off her feet and then she her eye suddenly becomes open and she can see it and she runs up the platform dancing and shouting around he'll young man jumps up out of there out of the audience he hobbles up on crutches toward the platform and then and I should stop him and saying brother Brandon kindly says to him such a same boy you have to get back and get a prayer card and wait your turn and the boy the young man bag didn't just tell me what the new brother branham that's all I want you to tell me what to do and brother brain cell i I don't know what to tell you and his voice kind of trailed off suddenly he saw a bus with Regina beach beach prominently displayed over the front windshield he said you've come from Regina Beach this morning didn't you and you came by bus and I see a man or a woman telling you that you can't go you said it's your mother and your father he's the boy said that's right I see another man who who looks like your father loaning you some money enough to make the trips and yes that was my uncle now see you in a room looking out of a bay window he said that was my house my aunt's house brother Brandon what must I do said do you believe with all your heart he said yes I believe with all my heart Jesus Christ is here he said then drop your crutches and stand on your feet Jesus Christ has healed you down went to both crutches clattering on the floor and he took one step two three hands raised in air and he went shouting giving God praise and the crowd went to a frenzied craziness and and and you see it came to pass just like God said to Moses if it will come to pass if they don't believe the first sign a man though they will hire hearken to its voice that will believe the voice of the latter sign and I don't want to tell you search it was all done to get us to be to be able to recognize like we do with the windmills that the wind is blowing coach the tree is moving and because we saw time after time after time that God was moving in the church it showed us he's here he's here he's here he's present he's present are you with me and that now this was more than one of the nine spiritual gifts that any believer can have this wasn't a word of knowledge it was a sign to get the people to believe the message and it's the same sign that Jesus used to get the people to recognize his Messiahship it fits exactly the Ministry of Jesus Christ now notice it was the men three of john the baptists but now it's also the ministry of christ notice because it's exact ministry Jesus said in John 5:19 the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do which means Jesus saw its miracle before the fact and what not because to Almighty God the future in the past were just as clear as the present you remember in the Bible and Jesus needed to eat the Passover he sent Peter and John ahead and he said go go to the city you're gonna meet a man with a picture of water go follow him wherever he goes in you say to him good men of the house now the master says where is the guest chamber where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples and he'll show you a large upper room furnished and prepared there made ready for us saying they would happen when Philip brought his brother Nathanael to the master jesus said of him behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile Nathanael said them where did you know me what do you know about me my certainty show up before Philip called you onto the victory I sell you and these visions would give Jesus penetrating insight that he could see the past as easy as the future John what one declares that Jesus was the Word made flesh Hebrews four and twelve says for the word of God is quick and that means alive and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit and of the joints and tomorrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of heart and neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do Jesus met the woman at the well because the V made it necessary to go through Samaria he started out on a conversation with her he asked her for a drink he talked to her long enough to catch her spirit and then he said bring your husband and come here and she said why don't have a husband he said but you had five and the one you're living with is not your husband and astonished she says well well you know I perceive your prophet you know I know when the Messiah comes he's here which is a call to Christ he will tell us these things and and he is she he said I'm he and you see this was a sign of the Prophet you know we will the the minor parts of the story but maybe the whole story went perhaps Jesus even named the names of all the men that she had been with and why did she left him and are unworthy feelings that she had and all the abuse and the things that she'd went through because we'll only get a little snapshot of it but Jesus had told her enough that she knew a man that this was the Messiah that she recognized from the side side and Jesus said I am he now this was the sign of a prophet but this was also the sign of a messiah and Jen brother Branham was a prophet and the gift identified him as such are you with me Amen but he wasn't the Messiah they my mother shewed that the Messiah was present the word was present and a prophet had come to show the world that Christ indeed is alive and there's no two McMahon can hold him hallelujah if I look back at the tightness for a moment and the types and the shadows before us there was Abraham received promise after promise after promise as Israel hath received prophets and kings and prophets and great man water and man Abraham and recei promise after promise he was justified called out from the heathen sanctify taught how to build an altar and all for blood back to God he there received the Holy Ghost in tight under L said I entitled the Holy Ghost receives a new name no longer called Abram but Abraham and Manion then God comes down in the form of the man under the trees of memory and there the mysteries are revealed he tells him what will happen down in Sodom he tells him about the resurrection the the eastern that's promised to Sarah come on stay focus a man aids he tells him about all of these things that that are happening and says okay Sarah you're gonna happen Easter Sodom you're gonna have a burning what you're gonna be called out a map you be called out of the tribulation Abraham Sarah you won't even have a part in the tribulation hallelujah I'm out there the mysteries are revealed judgment is pronounced Sarah's heart is discerned and the message that the promised son comes to her let's look at it in Genesis 18 and 9 I don't think it even if it seemingly slows us down for a minute to read I think it's still pertinent to read the Word of God Genesis Aidan 18 and 9 and they said in him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly turn under the return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and we'll stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying that's why I'm waxed old shall I play and with my lord being old also and the Lord said I name of him were for did Sarah laugh saying I shall I of Shirdi bear a child which alone is there anything too hard for the Lord that's the question you got answer at that time at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son hey man I want you to hear the words that are pepp eternally are you with me now I might pay real close attention the angel had visited the angel was telling of the bringing a message Sarah you're gonna have a child Church you're going in the rapture a man Sarah's wondering how is this going to be we haven't had a move of God that would really give us rapture and faith all of these years amen now I'm old how can I ever have that kind of pleasure come on a man here she's here a condition of unbelief fearing it'll never happen it'll never happen oh it's just words or it's slow as the second coming of Christ all kinds of jokes are being made about it but now here appears an angel are you with me and an angel starts initiating the coming of the son hallelujah and he does it with a message remark now he's got to turn Sarah's heart so he discerns her heart he tells us what she's been thinking in the tent behind him right now notice it's the same thing it's the Messiah side discerning the thoughts it's showing the word is not present and the word now reveals the mystery of Sara the mystery of Sodom the mystery of lot hey man but I want to get something to that that is said twice in here let's go back in this and I want you to see this and he says in verse 10 and I will certainly return under the according to the time of life so now he promises the Sun he gives a promise but he promises they return now if you look down here I'm talking about the angel that the angel promises I'll return then he comes there and he says it's anything too hard for the Lord verse 14 at the time appointed I will return now when God says something twice that means like Jesus did say verily verily he is emphasizing he is making an oath he is making an irrevocable promise oh man now church I want you to understand we're here at the end time Sarah was having an Easter she was having a resurrection come on she was having a change it was a season of change it was a time of a birth of a child or you hear me an angel was announcing that he was coming hallelujah amen but now notice now let's bring it down to our time we're at a profit we are about an angel come we have had a message and it is said it is said you're going to bring for the child a man and we've been grappling with our unbelief who me how could we do it in this ages so what stage there is and lookie here Laodicea look at all what's going on look at the trouble in the laughs look at the problems everywhere it's an age of greater unbelief but God starts doing things to get us to believe in he sends signs and wonders he sends prophets come on he sends a an angel with the message to turn our hearts back to believe him again because we gotta get Sarah to believer before the promised son can come Alleluia now we've had all of that and let me tell you something friends we are in the time the appointed time of the Angels reappearing what you are seeing in the world today as you see demon powers moving you see the lens of storm shutting down the world you see things that are happening out there and the news is only telling you what death is doing but the instrument is not about death it's about life and the Easter message is saying if you see death then you know there's got to come to life and if you see Satan and his angels at work in these demons and sickness and affliction then you got to see the angel of mercy and grace and love and the angel of promise and Michael who is like Jehovah stack on the behalf of his people you're only seeing half for the picture because that's how the world can tell you is what they see but I'm not seeing death I'm seeing life I'm seeing them Easter I'm seeing we are in the moment in the time frame of the angels return notice Nelson I'll bring it down when he came that when the angel come he revealed the mysteries he told about Sodom there was a message down to Sodom come on man there was a message of a rapture given a hope that is created a faith that is given remember when the angel comes again it's not even recorded it's not a public shel hallelujah the world don't even know about it it is just a reappearance of the angel at the appointed time hallelujah a man I'm telling you we are in the moment of time of the returning of the angel not to bring more mysteries not to bring more teaching but to bring life and the body to closer dynamics even the calm because of the faith that is working up in Sarah's heart Sarah will come to you the important time and you will have an Easter you will have a restoration hour and a resurrection from that old dead form you've been here you've been dead all of these years but now I met life is in the body Alleluia I believe the signs and the healing and the rejoicing that we have been experienced our Easter signs when you go out and you listen in the morning I like to go out in the early morning sit on my porch and hear all the rejoicing of the birds and the singing that is going on and I look and I see the signs of healing to nature Oh trees that have been dead throughout the winter and if in a dormant stage is now pretty important new life a math hallelujah and I see signs of healing and rejoicing those are Easter science but I want to say the signs of healing and rejoicing that we are seeing among us our Easter signs it's a sign that the bride is receiving strength last night we watched a 2014 service at youth camp as we watched back in what was it to 13 and when and then I miss different ones I don't remember them all but anyway we've watched the different ones that have been ministered night after night and then we watched to 2014 service that they at the youth camp was at 14 or 16 16 service at youth camp and and look back and we see miracles hey man let me say Easter to us isn't Easter eggs and rabbits and ducks that adorn our ports like backslidden mother religious people of the world and man it's not a bunny tree full of Easter eggs it's not something fake it's not a myth let me tell you any story is not a myth it's not a bunny story it's not a hippity-hop of the bunny traps and you might think that's cute I don't think it's cute no more than putting your child in Santa Clauses lap I meant but the church's backslidden that have lost the power of God and the real meaning of Easter a man but in sir to us is an Easter eggs and bunny rabbits and little ducks and little chicks but you know like the backslidden religious people of the world today but let me tell you what Easter means Easter means let me tell you our signs of Easter let me tell you of a Mariah a man who wore a little white cap up onto the platform in that in that message last night and we watched her as she went for bringing her little bobby pins I mean what does that mean that is Sarah receiving strength because she judged him faithful who made the promise hallelujah our Easter side is that a Leticia is vanquished hallelujah ala piece is called and the glory of the Lord has returned to the church that's what Easter means to us it's not a dead form it's not a Creed it's not a new theology it's not a he's alive he's alive he's not a dead God he's a Living God hallelujah we watch sister Connie followed by sister Karen come up in that prayer line a man what Easter means to me a man is that what is the sign of Easter what is the sign that he's alive what is the seal what is it the identification man what is it then dication that the angel is present among us is that we're seeing signs of life - hallelujah we see such iconic them through that prayer line is somebody with me now a man sarcoidosis has filled her lungs and they're keeping her from being able to breathe mmm but she is living today the cause of Anissa remember calls that we have declared he's the same yesterday today and forever and the so has returned a man and the angel is present not with a new doctor not with a new teacher but with signs of life not some boiled egg that you boil and boil and boil until it's so hard boil there's no life in it colored up and decorated and offered as a sign of Easter that's a sign of death even your plastic egg that's a sign of death there's no life in them all these other things we're we're supporting youth oh it's cute it's not cute it's like a lie it's just like Santa Claus is alive hey man but let me tell you let me tell you about an Easter sign we got a sister Karen whose blood pressure today is still normal a man in menopause and the effects from it they caused a significant brain bleed is gone and she's healed today and the blindness from her eyes is gone why why is that Turk because it's Easter we got a we got a sister Lana though is healed of Hodgkin's lymphoma and then her hat that she raced around the building around around and that hat and she got that revelation of the quickening power took that little frail 97 pound woman there and picked her up and run her around this building like a knife Lily and go back the next day sealed by the glory of God was signs and proof that God is a death but he's a Living God hallelujah what is that why is that because it's Easter [Applause] amen I think of about a little tint meeting where that brother Ron Spencer's called back in to pray for a little girl in a wheelchair with limbs all deformed and crippled up and there as he prays for her the snap apart and come apartment a little girl walks for the glory of God why did that happen is he star today sister Lana's hair is back she don't have to be wearing a camp that's a sign of death she's wearing the glory that's a sign of life hey man we watched Esther last night come through the prayer line a mountain she sent us a picture of her shoes that night she had written on the bottom of her the soles of her shoes infertility and went through that prayer line she showed us a picture of her shoes today you cannot see a sign where she ever wrote infertility on the shoes it's gone not only is it's gone she's pregnant I meant out there there's something more than a chick or duck or a boiled egg or bunny tree a man that's life is in the body a man it's that Barren womb that we pray and why was it because an angel visited us right here in this church an angel visited us hallelujah because of the Angels visitation a word was released its Esther's time his Hester season and today she's showing a little bump of life that's never been seen in her before why because it's Easter we watch sister Jessica Martin come through and as a part of that vision she come through the prayer line brother Ron had waited until she got there she would be about the last one he prays for that day in that prayer line and he stops and says I have a word how the Lord for you your son is coming home brother Timothy and I would go to meeting little later in time I'm not sure exactly when but he feels the boy gives a testimony actually his wife gives a testimony both of them give a testimony of how that God saved them but anyway Caleb comes coming side and is invited to the meeting decides to come that night got ministers got brother Timothy brother Tim and and they come to the meeting and in that meeting a man he came home a man Wow an angel visited a message came saying it's Easter a man Caleb you don't have to live and sin any longer you yourself can have an Easter be resurrected from death into life are you with me hey man Oh mind you don't tell my thing after team that we could talk about today we're cops signs of life is a fondest pride I hear men minister sincere they can be trying their hardest to put the quotes together try to understand their miss applying things taking things brother Branham said before it was divided and given to the 144,000 in the church instead of the bride and said about the plagues and so on like that and they got it all misconstrued and they see we're brother Benson we need to move of the Holy Ghost and then they turn it around and say you see but it's a teaching and I say Church it's not a teaching the messenger came with the message and the teaching has been given the return of the angel does not bring teaching come on it brings life to Sarah amen it causes her a culmination of events that causes her to judge him faithful who had promised and I want you while you're sitting there quarantined in your own home think about these things right now a man that an angel has visited our generation to initiate to come in the Lord and that angel has not lost interest the angel is present hallelujah and I want to just say as we saw in the Mauro peninsular the angel still sits on the stone did you notice he rolled away the stone and he sat on the stone hey man what was that signify now back we'll ever take this stone and close up the tomb again sealing Christ away and I want you to know what's this message has been released it cannot ever go back it can only go into fulfillment a man held did his best to hold Jesus in the tomb the grave did his best to corruptive but it's Easter a man Easter proved he was not only the world but he was God and scepter dynamics in the word God is still God as I'm trying to bring this down to close today I want to say God is still God the sign of the Son of man showed us the Word was here in power that it was not just dead by theology but it was something that lived now the office of son of man prophet is not here but the Ministry of the son of man continues notice the angel said I will come again I will visit again I will come to you brother Branham says I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man and human flesh through the bog through the bride's body look where he's revealing Sethna through the bride's body now why why why not the bride's body you know we've been talking about the minister Christ being displayed and we talked about a prophet and eminent him demonstrate in the Ministry of Christ but let's go back in the day where Jesus what's that God prophet and his ministry was manifested in Christ right but I want you to know that they have Pentecost it was not another spirit somebody help me preach it was the same spirit that was in Jesus not another Jesus the same Jesus comes again in another form to cook to dwell in another body to work in another body and to finish the work in another body the same Jesus remember now is God in his people and what we saw was the Ministry of Christ the word brought to us to a prophet in a prophetic office is no longer happened in that way amen now it is being manifested in a broad body worldwide amen so indifferent the traditions of men as dead and the Holy Spirit is right among us now giving us life you see the angel vindicated this over and over again for us so we can be sure and see his resurrection sign and I want to say today the clouds may have obscured the said the Sun for a while my this morning when we went out it was a gloomy day the closer they as I backed out of my garage and backed out into it the day was so dark it was so dark we couldn't see the face of the Sun and the clouds may have obscured the face of the Sun for a while even the next day after the Angels visit maybe Sarah after hearing whatever maybe you don't even see a change in her but something's happening whether the day is now a good day or a bad day weather is robbers coming to drove off some of the sheep or didn't whether Sodom got worse and you hear miss burn and nothing changes she has received a message and there's something beginning to happen in her and it begins with her btv believe it not that this is for Hagar somebody else to fulfill but it's for me to fulfill and she begins to look about herself as the princess and she begins to dress like the princess because her name has been changed from Baron to princess and she begins to identify herself with the name she's called and now Abraham is calling her by the new name he's calling her princess hey princess will you bring me a cup of coffee this morning hey princess will you do this princess princess come sit by me for a minute and after a while she begins to hear princess princess princess and she begins to me I'm a prince oh man we've had message after message and I preached in this vid priests and the pulpit has preached and preached some priests without kind of minister you're the Bride of Christ you're the chosen of God you're the elect of God you're the people of God come on somebody and some of you hallelujah I hope I'm starting to believe it you're suddenly saying yeah mama that's me hallelujah I feel like a princess I may not may be old and wrinkled and not look like a princess but I'm still a princess cuz he said I'm a princess he changed my name and then she goes from there to where she starts believing and judging him faithful oh could I get you today to stop judging him faithful you're looking and you're worried about how faithful this Kovach 19 is going to be to kill all the old people in your hearing this news and that news and this problem and that would not and you think oh it's faithful its faithful hey they're gonna do it's gonna come on right now why don't you look away from that and look to the faithful one this morning and judge him faithful if God initiated this message with an angel and so time after time that he was concerned about the message and backing it up and he makes a promise to Sara I'm gonna make a reappearing and now we start seeing him start working what does that tell you it's Easter it's a resurrection hour it's the time for those that were dead and unbelief to start believing again it's the coming of the angel announces his risen early in the morning at the rising of the Sun that go into the tomb and that seals it and the roman seals are broken the keepers are his dead men and i want you to get it we've had it in our day were the Roman singles on the boat were broken folks baptism thoughts ideas folks that was teaching her they have been broken and the keepers they're dead every one of emerg dead man come on somebody there's no life in them and he said why are you seeking the living among the dead why are you looking up there for hope of revival revival isn't coming their revival is because he's risen if I could just get you to see he's not dead but he's alive and he's a healer he's a deliverer or his countenance like lightning his raiment white as snow rolls back to stone from the door and sat upon it no young man long clothed in a long white garment said don't be a frightened you seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified yeah they hung him on a Roman tree back then down to the ages they were hung him owned a Roman Catholic tree but he's risen he's not there the angels messages don't be afraid you seek Jesus who was crucified but he's risen he's not here you no longer have to expect a dead Apostles Creed come on you no longer have to to to look for a far more rich oh he's risen a man why Shiki the living among the dead he's not here but he's risen the angel sat upon his throne no one gonna steal Christ again I'll tell you you're not going to find him in dead forms word days of miracles are past this is the Easter message the Roman seals are broken at Jesus alien death forms religious system and you won't find the living among the dead he's not there he's risen now let me bring it down to close and I'm already what two hours into this yeah right up two hours let me bring it down to a close I want to bring you back to one of my devotions this week since this has been going on and as I was preparing my sermon this morning I was reminded of the time the only time that Easter was written in the Bible did you know Easter is only in there one time it was translated us because by the time King James translated the Bible into English language Easter which was actually the name of a moon God in the celebration of her birthday but by the time of King James translated the Bible into English the word Easter had become synonymous or interchangeable with the Passover and if you looked at the Greek word there it doesn't say Easter it says Passover and this was written in the book of Acts chapter 12 and the devil decided to persecute the church and killed James and had arrested Peter intended to bring him out for execution after Easter I men remembers that now look at our thing we have been going through Daniel 12 Michael stands up we've been over in Revelation in in Revelation 12 where Michael fights the dragon now then we're over here in Acts chapter 12 and Acts chapter 12 it's Easter and the devil has his plans amen now what starts out with big plans for the devil ends pretty dismal and man oh yeah he starts with big plans he kills James he arrests Peter he's going to kill him and you know he's gonna stop the church and he you know all of this plans that he has and it ends up with Herod dead eaten with worms and the Word of God is multiplied every man I want you to look that chapter begins bad but it ends good it is that starts with Satan's got a scheme against the church but God's got another plan that you don't even see when Satan's plans moving around now so it's Easter and then Herod when arrested Peter going to bring him out for execution after Easter demons are gloating ah this was a great victory hell has delighted in James's death now he'll has moved to plan the death of Peter Peter hold has held the keys to the church which he delivers to the church on the day of Pentecost it's really too late because the keys is to open it has been given but he has plans for Peter but God has other plans would you to understand the devil may have plans for your life he may have you there and you're under a threat of death you're going to be executed but God's got other plans hallelujah now in the middle of this there's the church the church hears of Peters arrest you need there like Peters like those that are in the ward with Kovac 19 you know you can't get to them I read a people who dropped their husband their son their loved one off at the hospital for them to be taken into isolation never to be seen again put on a machine and dead body taken to the morgue crying I couldn't get to him I couldn't say the last goodbyes well given the last hug say the last tour Peter was in law and in isolation quarantined but there's a part that the church has got to play and what this happens is this causes the church to start praying now if you just stop and remember you're not here to learn how to use yourself felt better you're not even here for new soon program where you can just kind of cue in on everybody what everybody's doing it and I'm a better platform for social media you're not here for fun and games you're here you're here at a time and you've been called to a time of prayer type of consecration a time set aside the devil is threatened now to shut us down shut the world down but the churches part is to start praying calling on God for deliverance we need your deliverance we need the return of the angel look we saw the angel happen in the Zechariah to Mary we saw them to the Shepherd's we saw them we saw them strengthen Jesus there and a Gethsemane we see we see the angel he's good at the age heaven it is backing it up heaven is working heaven is working behind the scenes strengthen it helping the church he's there he's there I help and John and strengthening him giving him a message he's there anointing Jesus now Jesus is filled with the spirit and now at the Mount of temptation he's strengthened by angels and there and there and it just cemani strengthened by angels and now the Holy Spirit comes as a pillar of fire and the fire divides itself in the heavenly Spirit of God and gellick portions of God feel to every person with the Spirit of God but now Peter needs an angel because he's in an impossible situation preachers can't help him the other apostles can't help him nobody can get him out and the church starts praying and God sends an angel well now we don't pray to angels nor do we worship them but we do ask God to send deliverance and the Bible said and the angel of his presence saved them at times situations can look so bleak circumstances of life made it look so impossible that the devil has an upper hand but the power of prayer changes a situation a man from something bad there's something good look where it starts bad is good he's in prison no one can help him he's beyond the help of his friends they can't reach him physically he's under kept under constant watch not only is he imprisoned by an iron bars but he's in the inner prison behind now there will have to be several gates to go through he is not only there in that but there are is a quadrant of soldiers that are watching him there are two that are watching there are two that he's chained to there with that there is four quarter quarter and nuns where's that are commissioned to guard him all night and they will change out during the shifts of the night so that ever few hours he gets a fresh demonic visitation trying to hold even prison maybe there that way this morning sitting I can never give something comes in a way after wave after wave the news of James is death Saint will take that whisper in his ears all night long of what's going to happen in the morning you know there isn't there seems to be no Court of Appeal there's nothing but certain death because herring is only thinking of his own popularity that he's found with the Jews by killing James ever devil ever demon is clean fully wrapping their hands together and waiting for the moment that this preacher would be dead just wait until after Easter after Easter we got plans for him just wait till after Easter suddenly in the darkness of the night there comes a whipping whirling fire as a light descending from the invisible realm of heavens dimension and comings into the visible realm of the room and out of the light steps an angel sound familiar danger commands for Peter to rise quickly he smites him on the side oh man oh my yeah we can just stop for a moment or may it be this morning to come to smile side of ever bright movement member a man and you have that awakening moment that the angel has returned that the angel is present we seem here is done this isn't that this isn't that don't forget in that service last night as it began out I've told about the visit to brother Ron's room where he was dying in the hospital I've told you of the supernatural visitation where God raised him up from a dead State hey man he had an Easter are you with me a man with anyone little drew across the platform in that very service if I'd told about drew and my wife and that Sheila and one little drew as a proof hey man that we were having a nice time hallelujah that was true in his prank little spring tight pajamas of red and bright flower walking across that platform and then proving that our God isn't dead but he's a living God and this is what happens when an angel sweeps through the world and a little eighteen month old boy gets off the middle of the floor by his self without pulling up on the bed and gets up and runs through the house because it's been seen in a vision and the Word of God can never be changed all of a sudden from the Angels touch the chains fall off peter dresses quickly puts on his sandals follows angel out of the gates of the prison amen the revolving doors like that of a of a great a great supermarket or Walmart or something just comes right open and there is big on gates swing open as this pushed my invisible hands and the angel takes him and leaves him standing in the street deliver you see that devil may have a slice and he may have set out to destroy you and perhaps he's already sent his demons out to surround you with fear and The Beginner's torment but the God of heaven lass and his plans Satan's plans were for after Easter because he's really limited and what he can do until after the resurrection come on but when the rapture takes place what's out hey man he's got you know he will come down in full force be here upon the earth but he can only do it after Easter so before Satan can come down come on and fulfill his plans there's an easter amen so watch out he's got plans for Peter after Easter but until then just secure him just keep him sealing away just keep him chained down with down with that belief with men's theology with quotes with with Bible verses that will tie him down using the very things that ought to free him to bind him up again come on but it's Easter and Easter is when the chains fall off Easter the night has come it's Easter and the Angels makes you decide and says get up hallelujah and the Angels have returned and the scenes is repeated in the bride coming understand friends before he comes as a groom the resurrection has to take place in the bride and she has to she has to receive her change notice it is the rising of the Sun he said for the bride 8 there is a resurrection out of darkness on the nationalism we'll be a message here's a message that the maturity of the world has turned back in its full power and being while waved over the people by the same signs and wonders said he did back there it's because I live you shall live also speaking to his wife because I live you shall live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power hallelujah let me read this quote and we're closed let the musicians come notice brother Brennan said the theology of Christian churches are dying it's failed God is taking you listen God has taken you to now to reveal himself again through his church the resurrected body of the Lord Jesus Christ resurrected out of Church anity resurrected out of a cold formal churches resurrected out of fanaticism God is bringing forth a bunch of bones and putting skin on it in the power the Holy Ghost that'll bring the gospel in this last day with signs and wonders to the world they'll teach the Bible they'll stand by it they'll live by it they'll not compromise it's right or left right they'll spend write them the word and move on and God will be with them daily confirming the word with signs and wonders following hallelujah all you morning stars rise in time won't you stand together with me right now hey man get up angel smiting you on the side get up get out of your doldrums awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead Christ shall give you light a man all the sunshiny the Sun of righteousness is risen with healing in his wings its restoration hour it's Easter the round speak to somebody Miriah amen say it H one of you around the
