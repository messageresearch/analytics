[10:14] grace
[10:15] how many thankful for his grace we all
[10:19] know what His grace is this morning
[10:22] I reach down for us we truly are should
[10:25] be a thankful people a man just looking
[10:29] at their prayer requests this morning we
[10:30] have a Sara Salinas from Tucson it
[10:37] requested prayer actually it's sending
[10:40] an offering and then asked for prayer
[10:43] asking for prayer for lupus she's not a
[10:47] Christian the Tim said he sent back and
[10:50] said you don't have to send an offering
[10:51] to get prayer but I believe God can save
[10:55] and God can heal he meant where would we
[10:58] be without from grace where would we be
[11:02] also we have sister Vicki Thomas asking
[11:05] for a friend of hers whose father has
[11:07] blood cancer that's been in remission
[11:09] but returned doctors are very concerned
[11:12] he's a Pentecostal preacher there in New
[11:15] York
[11:16] remember that needs it's Loretta asked
[11:18] him for prayer this morning also how
[11:21] many would have a need you want to make
[11:22] it known to the Lord today a man how
[11:25] many could just say Lord where would I
[11:27] be if it wasn't for your touch and your
[11:29] grace and our lives - brother Joe if
[11:31] he'd coming open our service and prayer
[11:34] let's just go to prayer together as
[11:36] believers officers wear the hair and
[11:38] makeup
[11:39] Aaron Oglesby is out this morning
[11:41] Minister don't want to remember him and
[11:43] sister Lydia that are gone
[11:51] she's got a takes in just a few minutes
[11:54] ago for my mother-in-law just in regards
[11:56] to her brother David said we want to
[11:59] thank the church for their prayers
[12:01] the Lord has performed miracle already
[12:03] the doctor said that the transplanted
[12:05] liver was such a perfect match that if
[12:09] it was ever had to be her body scan done
[12:11] they would look like the liver was born
[12:12] inside of his body and I also want to
[12:15] pray for a smooth recovery so she just
[12:17] says you'll continue to keep that need
[12:18] in prayer his brother Timothy said how
[12:20] many of you have a need this morning
[12:22] remember we have a promise he said I
[12:24] will restore so whatever your need is
[12:25] he's a guy that's here this morning he's
[12:28] present he's available
[12:29] can we just touch to him and his garment
[12:31] and believe that whatsoever things we
[12:33] desire when we pray what we ask to
[12:35] follow this morning in his name that
[12:38] he's gonna meet that need today
[12:39] and I was reading this morning were
[12:41] speaking about Elijah and he met the
[12:43] former prophets of Bell and he said let
[12:45] the God that answers by fire he restored
[12:49] an altar he restored the word for that
[12:51] generation and the God that answered by
[12:53] fire was the God that came down and
[12:54] licked up the offering
[12:55] so I believe he's the same God today if
[12:57] you got a need I would say to God let
[12:59] the God that answers by fire performed
[13:02] this need today father we just come into
[13:04] your presence this morning Lord we want
[13:05] to say thank you for your grace to us
[13:07] Lord we thank you for the mercies that
[13:09] you have bestowed upon us Lord as your
[13:11] word says that your mercies are new each
[13:13] and every day God we woke up this
[13:15] morning with new mercies Lord new grace
[13:18] father untapped resources this morning I
[13:21] just ask today father as we see the
[13:23] world dying all around us god but you
[13:26] said I'll have a bride without spot
[13:27] without wrinkle without blemish Lord
[13:29] she's not torn us by the hands of man
[13:31] but she's appeared virtuous sinless
[13:33] daughter of God and Lord we come today
[13:36] father and lonely want to tell you that
[13:38] we love you we just thank you for the
[13:40] opportunity to be in your presence this
[13:41] morning in order we just asked let the
[13:44] God that inches by a fire come by this
[13:46] way this morning Lord no doubt there's
[13:49] people here maybe questions in their
[13:50] mind Lord but we believe you're the
[13:52] dissolver of doubts this morning or
[13:54] there's young people here
[13:55] this morning that our wayward Lord
[13:57] drifting Olaf's Lord solemn sees but
[14:00] Lord we believed today that you can
[14:01] reach out to them and throw a lifeline
[14:03] follow this morning and bring them back
[14:05] home today for you gave us a promise in
[14:07] your word I will restore God restore

[43:03] here being in the service of the great
[43:06] king of glory and and we got a little
[43:09] something there that we want to make
[43:11] mention of course as you know our our
[43:14] annual meetings are coming up and we got
[43:17] lots of plans for that that will be
[43:19] coming up the second weekend of October
[43:22] starting on Wednesday through Sunday and
[43:24] six great services that I believe the
[43:27] Lord will really speak to hearts and
[43:30] lives amen and so we have that we have
[43:34] brother David mayor that will be coming
[43:36] in a little early to the meetings and
[43:39] and so actually we'll be speaking for us
[43:42] the Sunday before the meetings began he
[43:46] says he's from Switzerland France area
[43:49] and then I never know where he's from
[43:51] because you know he's he I think he
[43:56] lives in in and Switzerland has a church
[44:00] in France and and I usually meet him
[44:04] somewhere else you know so it's always
[44:06] it's always hard for me to tell exactly
[44:09] where he's from but he's from Europe a
[44:10] man and he speaks English
[44:13] so you'll enjoy him he'll be a blessing
[44:16] to you I believe that he's a real
[44:19] servant of the Lord and also I want to
[44:22] thank you for your prayers as we were
[44:25] just visited with brother Kelly
[44:28] Hildebrandt in their annual meeting but
[44:30] there on Spencer and I spoke debt
[44:32] together we just saw the Lord do some
[44:34] awesome things as he just spoke to the
[44:37] people revealed itself through the word
[44:40] and just broke down barriers and opened
[44:43] up understandings of God as God is still
[44:46] God I was just seeing God worked so
[44:49] greatly among that congregation in years
[44:52] past then and this year was no different
[44:55] as we seen the Holy Spirit move and we
[44:58] flew from there directly to Tulsa and
[45:02] went to brother Wendell Martin's and
[45:05] there they were having their church
[45:07] dedication and there the pews that we
[45:11] gave them look really nice there and the
[45:14] ceilin that I think brother Joseph
[45:17] helped them with god bless you for that
[45:19] brother Joseph that helped make this for
[45:21] this building I also carried it right on
[45:24] over there it looked just awesome and
[45:26] they they were just so happy so we we
[45:31] got to be with them in that celebration
[45:33] brother Andrew Glover but there Josh
[45:35] Bennett brother Jonathan Martin brother
[45:39] Shawn Martin brother Wayne Lawson
[45:41] ministered there in the church and then
[45:45] Sunday night that we had a flood and
[45:50] unfortunately they didn't quite get the
[45:53] gutter out where it needed to go and you
[45:56] know they didn't have the the Baxters
[45:58] and Mitchell's here and and everything
[46:01] to put all of that in a dream pipe and
[46:03] get it away from the building and so it
[46:06] they just put in new flowerbeds and it
[46:10] will all look just really really nice
[46:13] and they were just ready for the Sunday
[46:15] morning and here comes a gully washer
[46:17] and and feel their building about that
[46:20] deep with water and and but you know
[46:23] they were resident people and
[46:26] just grab their things and took it over
[46:27] to community center and we had Church
[46:29] and I just reminded them that morning I
[46:33] said well you know what it's it's really
[46:36] not about dedicating a building it's
[46:38] about dedicating the people and so this
[46:40] is more important than even dedicating a
[46:43] building is to have the people dedicated
[46:46] so we had a great time in the Lord also
[46:48] wanted to show you something that's real
[46:51] special you know the other day we did
[46:52] something and showed you what they've
[46:56] been working really really hard on and
[46:58] that was sister Alana but Sue's
[46:59] testimony and we're hearing back from
[47:01] all over the world literally people
[47:05] whose faith has been inspired and lifted
[47:08] up and and they're believing for their
[47:10] own healing and deliverance and and you
[47:14] know but these brothers brother Michael
[47:17] Dexter of course and and others have
[47:19] have worked on I don't know his whole

[49:45] mean we have many changes in life as
[49:48] years go by and times go by and today we
[49:51] have something very exciting we want to
[49:54] share with you about a young couple here
[49:56] in the church breast and brother Justin
[49:58] ware and sister Lillian petter solely
[50:01] have pledged to be married and they're
[50:04] going to consummate those wedding vows
[50:08] on January the 11th 2020 so we're going
[50:11] to invite them to come here right now as
[50:14] we welcome this new couple here that the
[50:17] Lord has joined together and we just
[50:19] thank God for their their lives and
[50:23] their testimony I think it's wonderful
[50:25] when we have young people in our church
[50:27] that fall in love with one another and
[50:29] get married and a man and put their
[50:32] roots down in that wonderful amen so we
[50:35] certainly appreciate Justin and Lillian
[50:38] and their testimony once wouldn't seem
[50:42] like no time ago the Lord reached out on
[50:45] a service when when Justin's sister
[50:49] asked for for her the salvation of her
[50:52] brother and we were in the prayer line
[50:54] we prayed and while we were praying God
[50:57] moved up on Justin's heart and bring him
[51:00] brought him to church in his pajamas
[51:03] down to the altar and he gave his heart
[51:06] to the Lord and he's never looked back
[51:09] hey man that's a miracle
[51:13] gods feel that mighty miracle working
[51:17] God stand over here just open here I
[51:19] want you to turn around here a man what
[51:22] a wonderful couple this is you know I'm
[51:26] Williams one of my my cousin's my
[51:30] cousin's granddaughters and so that
[51:34] makes a whole Justin here because so you
[51:37] know he's part of the family and so on
[51:40] now he has he's in double trouble he has
[51:43] to not only you know stand up you know
[51:45] for her as far as to me as a pastor but
[51:48] also as a relative so now you know we
[51:52] want to just ask the Lord's blessings
[51:54] upon them today father we want to thank
[51:57] you for this young couple that has
[51:59] pledged to be married and Lord as they
[52:04] enter into this time of engagement we
[52:07] treat this so seriously Lord because we
[52:11] believe that a promise that is made it
[52:14] should be binding and that it should be
[52:17] meaningful and so Lord they have prayed
[52:21] over this and they've talked with me
[52:23] about it and and and Lord now today
[52:27] they've come to announce to the church
[52:29] their decision that they have made and
[52:32] we're asking Lord for your blessings
[52:34] upon their lives that you would just
[52:38] follow them with that mercy and grace
[52:42] all the days of their life may the Holy
[52:45] Spirit Lord just continue to guide them
[52:48] the same one that would go to the bed
[52:51] and bring Justin to church and he'd
[52:53] surrenders heart to the Lord may that he
[52:56] always yield to that voice of the Lord
[53:00] and turn to you with all of his heart
[53:03] for guidance and leadership on the other
[53:05] hand we thank you for Lillian and her
[53:08] testimony and her love for you and Lord
[53:11] as we no doubt would would offer these
[53:15] little ones to you as young children now
[53:19] they're adults we're asking now that
[53:22] your blessings would go with them
[53:24] and that your spirit would follow
[53:28] everywhere they go and then lead them
[53:30] and give them that gentle nudge in every
[53:33] direction they should take for we ask it

[59:35] [Applause]
[59:42] these are long blessed be the name of
[59:47] the Lord let's turn to Exodus chapter 15
[59:51] and verse 26 we want to read from there
[59:55] this morning
[59:56] a man so good to be back with you again
[59:59] after being gone for some time we saw
[1:00:02] appreciate the brothers who had
[1:00:04] ministered while we were away and they
[1:00:08] just didn't want all some jobs so we
[1:00:10] appreciate the Lord for that
[1:00:12] amen Exodus chapter 15 verse 26 and said
[1:00:17] if thou wilt diligently hearken to the
[1:00:20] voice of the LORD thy God and do that
[1:00:23] which is right in his sight and will
[1:00:26] give ear to His commandments and keep
[1:00:29] all his tattoos I will put none of these
[1:00:32] diseases upon you which I have brought
[1:00:35] upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord
[1:00:39] that healeth thee amen god bless you can
[1:00:43] be seated we have been speaking on the
[1:00:46] people of the book have returned to the
[1:00:49] land of the book and today we're going
[1:00:51] to be speaking on the return to the land
[1:00:54] of healing and and of course we have
[1:00:58] returned to this land of promise and in
[1:01:01] this land there is healing that's truly
[1:01:05] a land that flows with milk and honey
[1:01:08] now of course the land that we have
[1:01:11] returned to is not the the land of of
[1:01:15] rocks and soil and rivers and streams
[1:01:18] that is over there in the Land of Israel
[1:01:22] today but our land use of the promised
[1:01:25] land of the Bible and we have been
[1:01:28] returned back to our homeland and I just
[1:01:32] want to say how dare how dare we not
[1:01:35] believe in healing
[1:01:37] when brother branham often said how can
[1:01:39] I get you to have faith for a rapture
[1:01:41] when you won't even believe for divine
[1:01:43] healing now we we know that's true I
[1:01:47] mean when you go to and thinking about
[1:01:48] this a you know that if we can't believe
[1:01:53] even for God to heal one thing in our
[1:01:55] body how can we believe her body change
[1:01:58] amen
[1:02:00] so we're gonna have to be a people who
[1:02:02] believe and believe God and take him at
[1:02:05] his word and accept his divine promises
[1:02:08] and yeah we know we have doctors and
[1:02:11] medicine and we thank God for all of
[1:02:13] them but that does not replace healing
[1:02:15] they can't heal only God is the healer
[1:02:19] and so because of that you know one
[1:02:22] thing that I feel like that we must do
[1:02:25] in preaching the full gospel we must
[1:02:28] preach about a goddess heals a God that
[1:02:31] delivers and and of course no matter
[1:02:35] what situations arise you know and one
[1:02:39] may get healed we know that the Satan
[1:02:41] will come and attack in another way and
[1:02:43] there's always gonna be needing for
[1:02:45] healing in the church and deliverance
[1:02:48] and sums 105 and verse 36 I want to
[1:02:52] remind you of the scripture that I spoke
[1:02:54] of some time ago on the in Passover word
[1:02:58] then he smote all the firstborn in their
[1:03:00] land the chief of all their strength and
[1:03:03] he brought them forth were also with
[1:03:06] silver and gold and there was not one
[1:03:09] feeble person among their tribes so this
[1:03:14] is what happened in that Exodus and so
[1:03:17] we are expecting the same thing in this
[1:03:21] Exodus a man that there not be one
[1:03:24] feeble one among us but we see God
[1:03:28] continually as a Lord God that healeth
[1:03:31] all diseases now we shared with the
[1:03:35] world Sunday September the 8th where
[1:03:39] just before I left the last sermon that
[1:03:41] I preached here was on that and we
[1:03:45] showed the testimony of sister lana
[1:03:47] butts that we just gave you another clip
[1:03:50] that is now translated into the Spanish
[1:03:52] language and I just thought I would just
[1:03:55] stop for a moment as I kind of reminisce
[1:03:59] during those times of as when reflected
[1:04:02] back upon that great healing that is now
[1:04:06] going across the world and people are
[1:04:09] taking encouragement from it and and as
[1:04:14] I as I thought about that you know not
[1:04:16] only was she healed that day but there
[1:04:19] was also another little couple from
[1:04:22] Africa South Africa that had written me
[1:04:24] and said that you know the brothers said
[1:04:27] I am a minister and I hadn't had a job
[1:04:30] in several years and we're in a
[1:04:33] desperate situation and and my wife is
[1:04:36] rectal cancer and and she's in the
[1:04:39] fourth stage of the Adhan and it just it
[1:04:42] just moved my heart you know there's
[1:04:45] something ought to do I know compassion
[1:04:48] maybe doing the will of God but
[1:04:50] compassion is also mercy heaven mercy
[1:04:53] and I believe in sobriety Christ we
[1:04:56] ought to be a people that that show
[1:04:58] mercy and that mercy sometimes may come
[1:05:02] by us calling on the name of the Lord so
[1:05:05] that there can be delivered in that name
[1:05:07] and so I took a prayer cloth that day to
[1:05:12] the pulpit and prayed over that at the
[1:05:15] end of the service and and sent that to
[1:05:18] South Africa we got a report back that
[1:05:21] the man said I got a job that's
[1:05:23] unbelievable he said has been waiting
[1:05:25] for me for several years and he said
[1:05:29] they've held it open for a couple of
[1:05:30] years until I came and he said God
[1:05:33] provided me an incredible job and he
[1:05:36] said my wife went back to the doctor and
[1:05:39] don't have a trace of the rectal cancer
[1:05:41] anymore
[1:05:47] so I just want to tell you you know I've
[1:05:50] heard reports from around the world of
[1:05:52] people with with the insulin-dependent
[1:05:55] type 1 diabetes who who was facing
[1:05:59] actually amputation and and was healed
[1:06:02] by the power of God right while they're
[1:06:05] just listening to a service so you think
[1:06:08] God still working and he'll respond to
[1:06:10] anywhere that he finds faith and that's
[1:06:13] what God is looking for now you know
[1:06:17] when we've come with sister Atlanta you
[1:06:20] know we I did not send her daily
[1:06:22] encouragement but just only as I was
[1:06:25] moved by the Holy Spirit her you know
[1:06:27] and and of course as you know that her
[1:06:30] healing was verified by the PET scan on
[1:06:33] February the 19th 2018 when she went to
[1:06:37] the doctor for her scan that was that
[1:06:40] was right after the February 18th
[1:06:42] service where that the Holy Spirit moved
[1:06:45] that was preaching on the revealing of
[1:06:47] sons and you remember what happened that
[1:06:51] day as I was preaching on God doing some
[1:06:54] extreme things to cause us to believe
[1:06:57] and and so as I ministered along that
[1:07:02] line and we come to the end of the
[1:07:04] service and and and we saw the Holy
[1:07:08] Spirit just moving and new he began to
[1:07:11] sing the song leaning on the everlasting
[1:07:13] arms which became the the name of her or
[1:07:16] her film and she jumped up from the
[1:07:21] mezzanine back to the air and ran around
[1:07:23] the building a couple of times there a
[1:07:26] woman that was very sick very weak had
[1:07:31] no energy you know couldn't hardly make
[1:07:33] it through the day sometimes she had
[1:07:36] taken for treatments that chemo which
[1:07:38] the doctors would later admit that he
[1:07:41] thought the treatments with killer as
[1:07:43] she was already so sick and underweight
[1:07:45] and fragile that the treatments
[1:07:48] themselves would kill her but um you
[1:07:51] know it was it was during the month of
[1:07:54] January this took place in February but
[1:07:56] in the month of January on the
[1:07:58] in January the 16th just about a month
[1:08:01] before we would have that service on the
[1:08:04] 18th of February IRA I just was in
[1:08:08] prayer that morning and the Holy Spirit
[1:08:10] just spoke to me to write her and I just
[1:08:14] wanted to kind of reminisce and show you
[1:08:17] some of that site and I in my and what I
[1:08:20] wrote her I said you're continually in
[1:08:22] our prayers
[1:08:23] daily and through the night and it's
[1:08:25] true you know through the night every
[1:08:28] time every waking moment I would just I
[1:08:30] would just awake and I just call her
[1:08:32] name and prayers of God you've got to
[1:08:35] move we need you on the scene and and I
[1:08:39] said there's not a day that we neglect
[1:08:41] to pray for you that your faith will be
[1:08:43] lifted so the healer names of the Holy
[1:08:45] Ghost can sweep over you with this
[1:08:47] healing touch responding to your faith
[1:08:50] and of course that was in reference to
[1:08:53] what happened with sister Karen when she
[1:08:55] was there in the bed unable to see out
[1:08:58] of her I lost her peripheral vision and
[1:09:01] and we can that went from a brain bleed
[1:09:05] and unable to hardly go to the bathroom
[1:09:09] by herself and laying there and
[1:09:11] reflecting upon her life in the
[1:09:14] condition and and feeling sorry for
[1:09:17] herself and Bethany comes in and puts a
[1:09:20] little Dru who had never walked at 18
[1:09:23] months old undeveloped hip you know they
[1:09:27] they he was not able to pull up or to
[1:09:33] walk around a piece of furniture well
[1:09:36] just stand and tottery
[1:09:37] hold on to the edge you know just a
[1:09:40] little but not able to really take steps
[1:09:42] and what never crawled and there that
[1:09:46] day as we as as we were there in the
[1:09:50] house and sister Karen laying in the bed
[1:09:53] and Bethany my daughter took the little
[1:09:55] baby true there 18 months old set him at
[1:09:59] the end of the bed went over to talk to
[1:10:02] her mama and about that time the Holy
[1:10:05] Spirit swept through the
[1:10:08] and took away her blindness and she
[1:10:12] began to see clearly and a praise went
[1:10:15] forth out of her lips and it swept all
[1:10:17] over the end of the bed and swept over a
[1:10:21] little drew that was layin are sitting
[1:10:23] there and he raised up out of the middle
[1:10:26] of the floor not grabbing on to the bed
[1:10:28] just raised up out of the middle of the
[1:10:30] floor and ran all over the house he may
[1:10:39] sweep over you this morning wherever you
[1:10:42] are even either here around the world if
[1:10:45] you're a part of his people God's
[1:10:47] concerned about you and your knee to a
[1:10:50] man and as I wrote her you know I said
[1:10:54] that so that your faith might be lifted
[1:10:57] so that the heel and Angel can sweep
[1:11:00] over you with this healing touch
[1:11:02] responded your faith I said we know that
[1:11:06] faith is a gift to God that each of us
[1:11:08] possess it is his faith and we are
[1:11:11] rising to the occasion with you God is
[1:11:14] not on your side you are on his side and
[1:11:19] I think sometimes that's what we forget
[1:11:21] we get to thinking you know um you know
[1:11:26] that that we you know that God is on our
[1:11:29] side and I need him to come by our side
[1:11:31] I want you to understand and man that's
[1:11:33] not really the way it is God is not on
[1:11:36] your side you are on his side he's the
[1:11:39] leader in this this is what he would
[1:11:41] tell Joshua when he was looking for a
[1:11:43] way into the city of Jericho and then
[1:11:47] God would say I'm you know we come there
[1:11:50] with his sword drawn the captain of the
[1:11:53] Lord's hosts and and he would declare he
[1:11:56] would declare to him I am the captain
[1:11:58] because Justin would say you know are
[1:12:01] you for us or against us and he would
[1:12:04] say nay
[1:12:05] neither Amen I I'm not on your side
[1:12:09] you're on my side
[1:12:11] and I want you to understand this
[1:12:13] morning it is God than his own and that
[1:12:17] is working on your behalf and you are on
[1:12:19] God's side but this is not your battle
[1:12:22] it's the Lord's battle whatever you're
[1:12:26] going through
[1:12:27] it's his battle now so I wrote her you
[1:12:32] know that's where raise the rice into
[1:12:34] occasion with you God is not on your
[1:12:37] side you were on his side the battle is
[1:12:41] not ours it's the Lord's second
[1:12:44] Chronicles 2015 and he said hearken ye
[1:12:48] all Judah and ye inhabitants of
[1:12:50] Jerusalem and not King Jehoshaphat just
[1:12:54] saith the Lord unto you be not afraid
[1:12:57] nor dismayed by reason of this great
[1:13:00] mustard multitude for the battle is not
[1:13:02] yours but gods now that's why I want you
[1:13:07] to start thinking about your battles
[1:13:09] you're going through and your healing
[1:13:12] may be on any round it may be on the
[1:13:15] physical realm it could be in the spirit
[1:13:17] or the emotional realm it may be in the
[1:13:21] soul round that is all healing and the
[1:13:25] battle is not yours but gods sister lana
[1:13:30] would respond back to me that day in the
[1:13:32] text and she said I believe that when I
[1:13:35] was given my diagnosis I told the Lord I
[1:13:37] was already so weak and tired and I felt
[1:13:40] like I could not face what was ahead of
[1:13:42] me and he reminded me that in my
[1:13:45] weakness he is strong and many times in
[1:13:49] this journey I've had something to come
[1:13:51] up that I just had to put on his
[1:13:52] shoulder because I could not do anything
[1:13:54] about it and it's such a relief to give
[1:13:58] it to him I think about the scripture he
[1:14:01] said cast all your cares upon him for he
[1:14:04] cares for you
[1:14:06] she continues said I know he's waiting
[1:14:09] and ready to do for me more than I could
[1:14:12] ask or think I am in expectation I only
[1:14:17] I know it only takes a moment and I'm
[1:14:20] praying that the channel will be open
[1:14:22] when
[1:14:22] it's my moment I've already seen him
[1:14:26] lovingly caring for me in this situation
[1:14:29] I know it's a simple matter to him to
[1:14:32] complete the work
[1:14:33] I feel like Caleb give me my Mountain so
[1:14:38] we're so encouraged when someone says
[1:14:40] they're praying and I know God hears
[1:14:43] ever one and it does not come back void
[1:14:45] and the hard times it comforts me
[1:14:48] greatly
[1:14:49] later that evening she would write me
[1:14:51] again and she would say sister Mary
[1:14:54] Catherine which is sister Mary Catherine
[1:14:57] Joyner here a godly little sister said
[1:15:00] send me a card and I received it today
[1:15:03] and it had the same scripture on it that
[1:15:06] you sent us this morning as David said
[1:15:09] out of the mouth of two or three
[1:15:11] witnesses you know when you're in the
[1:15:14] situation you got to look for every sign
[1:15:16] along the road and you got to recognize
[1:15:19] God in every situation and I responded
[1:15:23] back and I said okay this of course
[1:15:25] there's no coincidence
[1:15:26] this was predestinated and preordained
[1:15:29] as I was in prayer for you this morning
[1:15:32] and as I prayed for you this word came
[1:15:34] to me that I sent you of course
[1:15:37] I did not even know sister Mary
[1:15:39] Katherine would send your card but no
[1:15:41] doubt she too was moved by the Holy
[1:15:43] Ghost no doubt it was quickened to her
[1:15:45] that it said just the right thing let me
[1:15:50] tell you this is not even this morning
[1:15:53] by chance meeting you're not here by
[1:15:57] chance you're here because God wants you
[1:16:01] to know I'm the here whatever your
[1:16:05] situation is whatever the problem is in
[1:16:08] your family whatever it is whether it's
[1:16:10] a mind situation it doesn't matter if
[1:16:13] you were born with it no matter if it's
[1:16:16] in your genes this is a God who is a
[1:16:18] creator this is a God who knows exactly
[1:16:22] how to create cells you know to remove
[1:16:25] that cancer he would also have to create
[1:16:28] new sales so not only did he can remove
[1:16:31] the
[1:16:32] from the lungs just there in an answer
[1:16:35] but he also gave her a whole new set of
[1:16:38] lungs that would testify of the healing
[1:16:41] power of God Wow because God is a
[1:16:46] creator
[1:16:49] then you've been talking about missing
[1:16:51] limbs coming back and you've been
[1:16:53] talking about the power of the spoken
[1:16:55] word we are already seeing it begin to
[1:16:58] happen hey man we ought to be under
[1:17:04] expectations to see God move now I went
[1:17:13] on and told her because as I reflected
[1:17:17] on that on that verse I thought you know
[1:17:20] what are the odds what are the odds that
[1:17:23] sister Mary Katherine and I would sin
[1:17:26] the very same Scripture at the very same
[1:17:28] time and God would move it upon our
[1:17:30] hearts you know her her receiving that
[1:17:34] inspiration me receiving that
[1:17:35] inspiration it coming to her on the very
[1:17:38] day there to start causing her to
[1:17:42] believe for something greater than just
[1:17:45] a healing are you with me
[1:17:48] and I began to look at it then I
[1:17:50] realized as I looked I first looked at
[1:17:53] the King James Version has an even
[1:17:57] number of verses there's thirty one
[1:17:59] thousand one hundred and two so you know
[1:18:02] the chances of us getting it was here
[1:18:06] one out of thirty one thousand and two
[1:18:08] chances have sinned in the same verse
[1:18:11] and I said God sent you two witnesses
[1:18:15] today by giving you the same verse
[1:18:17] confirming that he indeed is the leader
[1:18:19] this battle against Satan for the battle
[1:18:22] is not yours but the Lord's and then you
[1:18:27] know as I went on to say realize and
[1:18:31] this was very significant that sister
[1:18:33] Mary Katherine and I would send you the
[1:18:35] same Scripture in the same day I looked
[1:18:37] at the number of verses that we have
[1:18:39] could have chosen from the number as I
[1:18:42] said was thirty one thousand one hundred
[1:18:44] two and all these pictures there are
[1:18:46] over 7,000 promises similar to the one
[1:18:50] that we sent so we picked the same one
[1:18:53] out of 7,000 the Holy Spirit did and so
[1:18:58] what are the odds one one out of
[1:19:00] thirty 1002 that's divine providence and
[1:19:04] i said while looking up the number of
[1:19:07] verses i found out another interesting
[1:19:10] fact the two middle verses of the King
[1:19:13] James Bible are the first two verses of
[1:19:16] Psalms 103 1 let's read it together
[1:19:19] because I want you to see what's in the
[1:19:21] center what is in the center of God's
[1:19:25] Word
[1:19:26] sons 103 1 bless the Lord O my soul I
[1:19:32] love it when inserts out glorifying God
[1:19:35] I had of anything a man any before
[1:19:39] anything happens we're already praising
[1:19:41] it bless the Lord O my soul and all that
[1:19:44] is within me bless His Holy Name bless
[1:19:47] the Lord O my soul and forget not all
[1:19:50] his benefits this is right here in the
[1:19:54] very center of the Word of God who
[1:19:59] forgiveth all thine iniquities amen and
[1:20:03] who healeth all thy diseases I want you
[1:20:07] to notice in Redemption there is both
[1:20:09] healing for the soul forgiven of the
[1:20:12] iniquities and healing of diseases come
[1:20:15] on now who redeemeth the life from
[1:20:18] destruction
[1:20:19] a man so that that mouth is renewed
[1:20:22] excuse me who redeemeth thy life from
[1:20:26] destruction who crowns you with
[1:20:28] loving-kindness and tender mercy who
[1:20:31] satisfies the mouth with good things so
[1:20:35] that thy youth is renewed like the
[1:20:38] Eagles the Lord executors righteousness
[1:20:42] and justice for all that are oppressed
[1:20:46] hallelujah his righteous justice went
[1:20:49] out and men condemned that devil
[1:20:52] declared him dead she went back to the
[1:20:54] doctor on the next day amen and there a
[1:20:58] complete clean free scan come on amen
[1:21:03] this is a scripture that's in the center
[1:21:05] of God's Word it's to be kept in the
[1:21:08] center of your focus as he leads you to
[1:21:10] meet raghava speak
[1:21:12] that'ss serious voice mr. Lana responded
[1:21:18] to this and and I just actually pondered
[1:21:22] on this and I'm just gonna quote her
[1:21:24] from the video that we just released how
[1:21:27] can the battle be his if I'm the one
[1:21:30] fighting it I'm the one down here
[1:21:32] fighting how can this battle be gods but
[1:21:35] I saw in the Old Testament that
[1:21:37] Israelites dealt in the physical realm
[1:21:40] things that we deal with in the spirits
[1:21:42] around and I thought how they had to
[1:21:45] call on God and say look what they've
[1:21:47] been saying about us God would say go to
[1:21:50] sleep I got this don't worry about it in
[1:21:52] the next morning they got up and their
[1:21:53] enemy was dead and she said she said God
[1:21:58] I believe if you're gonna fight my
[1:22:00] battle I believe you're gonna have to do
[1:22:02] something supernatural for me and for
[1:22:04] that moment own I didn't just believe
[1:22:06] for a healin I started believing for
[1:22:09] something over and above something
[1:22:12] miraculous
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:15] hallelujah oh man and I think that's a
[1:22:18] way where the church body we in unison
[1:22:21] ought to be even this morning we're
[1:22:23] looking for more than just a healing and
[1:22:26] a gradual thing to happen we can look
[1:22:29] for the miraculous to take place
[1:22:33] remember cuz that's God we serve
[1:22:36] it's who goes to extreme to do extreme
[1:22:39] things to get his people to start
[1:22:42] believin a man and that's what I preach
[1:22:47] on that morning February the 18th that
[1:22:51] God had gone to the extreme to get us to
[1:22:54] believe and then we had returned to
[1:22:56] Bible doctrine with Bible faith with and
[1:22:59] Bible days are here again I wanted to
[1:23:02] clear that again this morning
[1:23:04] don't you ever to forget it we are here
[1:23:08] in the brides revival come on my way we
[1:23:13] shouldn't have to be encouraged by the
[1:23:15] song leader to worship our God to come
[1:23:18] out of our doldrums a shake of Laodicea
[1:23:21] where's the private Christ that this is
[1:23:23] I revival we ought to be here putting
[1:23:27] everything we got into a worshipping
[1:23:29] with everything
[1:23:30] Jimmy prays forgetting life his benefits
[1:23:37] this is a day of adoption of sons the
[1:23:41] manifestation or exhibition of the sons
[1:23:44] of God when true sons born sons filled
[1:23:48] sons will speak and their words are
[1:23:51] backed hey man William Branham would say
[1:23:56] that more than this more than sixty
[1:23:58] years ago he says I believe we're on the
[1:24:01] border of it right now
[1:24:03] yes sir say to this mountain so let it
[1:24:06] be so we're on the border back there 60
[1:24:10] years ago I say where are we today we're
[1:24:13] advanced we can all see us advanced into
[1:24:16] the hour of darkness ma'am but shouldn't
[1:24:19] we also be advanced in the in the faith
[1:24:23] hey man and seeing God move as he said
[1:24:27] he would do come on I'm out of quartz in
[1:24:30] the last year of brother branham's
[1:24:32] ministry he would declare bad vision the
[1:24:35] bride in preview and he would see the
[1:24:38] religious world of America first he
[1:24:41] would see you know them them coming back
[1:24:44] and ungodly bunch that would come in to
[1:24:47] preview from Europe and then he and then
[1:24:50] then he would see you in a vision he saw
[1:24:52] and remember William branham's visions
[1:24:55] were were accurate they were I've every
[1:24:57] one of them in detail are you with me
[1:25:00] what I'm not one of them ever fell to
[1:25:03] the ground my names addresses where they
[1:25:07] come from and then what their situation
[1:25:09] was and their whether it whether or not
[1:25:12] they would be healed every kind of thing
[1:25:15] was was known I mean even sometimes
[1:25:18] standing there I'd say one two three
[1:25:20] four five different surgeries the man
[1:25:23] who did it is a tall man you know did
[1:25:26] too many odds
[1:25:27] what's the guess it was God going to
[1:25:31] extreme things to get you to believe so
[1:25:37] that you'd have confidence in the word a
[1:25:40] man so now it would have this vision of
[1:25:43] the preview of the church and he would
[1:25:45] see her can rising up of a Europe of
[1:25:47] filthy ungodly bunch in morally dress
[1:25:51] and then then he said now we'll see that
[1:25:54] the Church of America and he saw the
[1:25:57] Church of America coming up as a group
[1:26:00] of women and they were naked from the
[1:26:02] waist up and of course she's naked as
[1:26:05] spiritually as well right hey man you
[1:26:09] did you know here in recent days
[1:26:12] Colorado is doing five other states
[1:26:15] legalizing the right for women to go
[1:26:17] topless in public you didn't hear what I
[1:26:22] said did you you're still sleeping maybe
[1:26:26] it's just shocking yeah but now six
[1:26:30] states have joined together saying it's
[1:26:32] legal for women to go topless
[1:26:35] in public and brother branham already
[1:26:39] saw her religious america dancing to the
[1:26:45] tune of rock and roll holding some
[1:26:49] little something in front of like great
[1:26:51] newspaper with fringes in front of her
[1:26:53] butt naked from the waist up and he said
[1:26:55] you know when she passed by there was
[1:26:57] nothing and leo to see is prophesied to
[1:27:02] be this way
[1:27:03] naked wretched miserable blind and don't
[1:27:07] know it but you realize we're right here
[1:27:11] in the very fulfilling of Scripture look
[1:27:15] we we live in a democracy and I'll tell
[1:27:19] you as much as we love democracy and
[1:27:22] talk about our freedom and let me tell
[1:27:25] you it is no substitute for a righteous
[1:27:28] godly king like Jesus we'll be in the
[1:27:31] millennium ahead
[1:27:33] hey man but you see democracy is all
[1:27:39] sales in the Lanka so that now in the
[1:27:42] name of freedom and rights they have the
[1:27:45] freedom to go topless ah you say what
[1:27:49] brother team not just secular women
[1:27:51] brother Jim now they're just as
[1:27:53] religious as they can be and I'm winning
[1:27:56] when they're when they're with the gays
[1:27:58] went and done their prophets there their
[1:28:00] protests here some time ago and then
[1:28:03] they wouldn't went down there we're
[1:28:04] children of God too
[1:28:06] we're God's children too now listen you
[1:28:09] can't be God's child except you'd be
[1:28:11] born into his family and that takes a
[1:28:14] new birth come on now hey man soon you
[1:28:18] will we're not children of God just
[1:28:20] because we're Americans or we say we
[1:28:23] believe Christ it's a bad back we become
[1:28:26] the child of God but then wait further
[1:28:29] the more you know their their religious
[1:28:31] is religious can be and yet and yet
[1:28:34] they're you know they're demanding the
[1:28:36] rights well men men can one you know is
[1:28:39] not a sex symbol and they we go we want
[1:28:42] to be an equal with man we're we're
[1:28:44] gonna go out on the streets just like
[1:28:46] men furthermore they have the right to
[1:28:51] kill their unborn children divorce for
[1:28:54] Mary as often as that will fulfill in
[1:28:57] the days of Noah marriage and given in
[1:28:59] marriage and that of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:29:01] full-blown perversion we're living in
[1:29:04] the last days Jesus would tell us and
[1:29:08] give us these these very days of knowing
[1:29:11] the days of Sodom as examples of what it
[1:29:14] would be before the judgment strikes but
[1:29:18] notice in all of this he also solved the
[1:29:22] bride now the church he saw her naked
[1:29:24] dancing to the tune of rock and roll and
[1:29:27] then on the other hand now he sees the
[1:29:31] bride coming by a man and as he saw her
[1:29:35] coming to him to preview the second time
[1:29:38] because he first saw her as a bride a
[1:29:41] godly little group of women walking down
[1:29:45] and stepped with the gospel a man and
[1:29:49] then he then he sees again Europe and
[1:29:54] then America and then he comes back and
[1:29:56] it comes into peer preview the second
[1:29:58] time trying to get something here comes
[1:30:01] in preview the second time and it showed
[1:30:04] that the church that was in the
[1:30:07] beginning of the day of Pentecost will
[1:30:10] come again at the end time
[1:30:13] and this time she'll be in step with the
[1:30:16] word matching to the tune of onward
[1:30:19] Christian soldiers hallelujah I like it
[1:30:23] onward Christian soldiers not retreat
[1:30:29] not looking back not going back to
[1:30:32] another age not repeating the sins of
[1:30:35] the ages past but a people is going
[1:30:37] onward because when we leave this seven
[1:30:40] days we're going in a rapture onward
[1:30:43] onward in a rapture outward to a
[1:30:46] marriage supper I'll do millennium our
[1:30:50] new heavens and a new earth never
[1:30:56] backwards that's the reason the bride
[1:31:02] came in to preview the second time there
[1:31:05] has to be a church called out of the
[1:31:07] latter-day like there was in the first
[1:31:10] day just exactly the three has to come
[1:31:12] from its roots up to the bride tree like
[1:31:15] it did that time God's masterpiece again
[1:31:19] birth pains he would tell the vision
[1:31:21] again and he would say she is to be the
[1:31:24] same bride the same time build out of
[1:31:28] the same kind of material that she was
[1:31:31] in the first place now read Malachi
[1:31:33] fuller and see if would not to have a
[1:31:35] message in the last days that a turn the
[1:31:38] hearts and the children back to the
[1:31:40] father's back to the original
[1:31:42] Pentecostal message word by word and I
[1:31:46] love this little next citizen he says
[1:31:48] brothers we are here
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:31:52] hallelujah we're not waiting another age
[1:31:55] we don't have to wait even Brett another
[1:31:58] ministry to come remember we have
[1:32:01] received a message that turned our
[1:32:03] hearts back to the father's back to the
[1:32:06] original Pentecostal message word by
[1:32:09] word brothers we are here
[1:32:15] but I wonder today sometimes what kind
[1:32:18] of voice the church has been listening
[1:32:21] to
[1:32:22] can you imagine rejecting the true
[1:32:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost and accept it
[1:32:28] instead and easy believe ISM just
[1:32:32] accepting the creeds and doctrines of
[1:32:34] the message and people never know in his
[1:32:36] life the god of this evil age brother
[1:32:42] Branham this is one of this last sermons
[1:32:45] that he will preach to his home church
[1:32:47] and I just want to quote a few things
[1:32:50] from it he says you know it's like when
[1:32:55] he Satan came to Eve you know he comes
[1:32:58] they're questioning the Word of God
[1:33:00] why as long as you go to church and thou
[1:33:04] believe us the devil believes not make
[1:33:07] believe but he actually believes and
[1:33:09] he's not safe if thou believest can you
[1:33:13] imagine you're rejecting divine healing
[1:33:17] or you let me just say it to neglect it
[1:33:21] is to reject it the church has through
[1:33:29] neglect it
[1:33:31] preaching faith and preaching healing
[1:33:34] and preaching deliverance are you with
[1:33:38] me and to neglect it is to reject it so
[1:33:43] he said Satan tells the second Adams
[1:33:46] bride the same as he told the verse such
[1:33:49] as now divine heal and there's no such a
[1:33:51] thing we can prove that there's never
[1:33:54] been a case of it proved and that's what
[1:33:56] people want to say today in the face of
[1:33:59] everything that has happened ah it
[1:34:01] wasn't really so you see Satan's trying
[1:34:05] today to convince the church to fill her
[1:34:09] with unbelief why again if we can't
[1:34:13] believe for divine healing how are we
[1:34:15] going to ever believe for a complete
[1:34:17] change of the body and the resurrection
[1:34:19] of the Dead as brother Branham goes on
[1:34:23] to say he says
[1:34:25] you know a quoting what is being said
[1:34:29] there's no such thing as the baptism of
[1:34:31] the holy ghost from these days that was
[1:34:33] only for the Apostle it's past no such
[1:34:36] thing as prophets even not is not even
[1:34:38] known as miracles
[1:34:40] they're unscientific Malecha for that
[1:34:43] was for another a John 14:12 Jesus
[1:34:45] didn't mean that
[1:34:46] Luke 1730 that's just the myth it's
[1:34:50] misinterpreted wasn't in the original
[1:34:51] such tommyrot when God comes down in our
[1:34:55] myths and proves it when he says that
[1:34:58] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:35:01] and forever and he proves that so I
[1:35:03] don't care who says well not about it
[1:35:07] God interpreters of word he said he
[1:35:10] would do this in us last day there will
[1:35:12] be light in the evening time and there
[1:35:15] is light for the manifestation of the
[1:35:17] Son of God
[1:35:18] it's sad but she sure fell for it again
[1:35:21] Christ's bride fell for it and she took
[1:35:25] in the next and intellectual knowledge
[1:35:27] of some seminary preacher instead of
[1:35:30] believing the pure vindicated Word of
[1:35:32] God let me just say this seminary
[1:35:35] preacher that they may not actually been
[1:35:37] to college he may just have an education
[1:35:39] and a degree in the message so to speak
[1:35:42] and not know supernatural experience let
[1:35:45] me tell you you got to have a
[1:35:47] supernatural experience to preach this
[1:35:49] message and I'll just tell you
[1:35:52] furthermore if he don't come in and
[1:35:54] knowing it is this worthless worthless
[1:35:56] can be it ain't God's Word unless God
[1:35:59] anoints it so you see again nice
[1:36:03] announces cause the whole world except
[1:36:05] scientific leadership the educational
[1:36:08] program that good Satan has given to her
[1:36:10] under the name of a church the
[1:36:12] leadership of an education scientific
[1:36:15] program I'm picturing you the god of
[1:36:17] this world when she has Eve had the very
[1:36:21] filling of God's Word in her hand she
[1:36:24] could have taken God's Word but what sin
[1:36:27] did she do to that instead of tearing
[1:36:29] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:31] she let science prove to her that the
[1:36:33] Holy Ghost was only for the disciples
[1:36:36] instead of keeping divine healing going
[1:36:39] when she ought to be now is that body on
[1:36:43] board she ought to be now raising the
[1:36:46] dead doing great miracles she's let
[1:36:50] Satan under his leadership a religious
[1:36:52] man take the Word of God and try to say
[1:36:55] that that was for another age and she's
[1:36:59] believed it well you know another age
[1:37:02] well that was for the divine healing
[1:37:04] aids and and that was for Laodicea that
[1:37:07] was just to vindicate the word that was
[1:37:09] just to prove that God and vindicate
[1:37:10] that God was sending a prophet and so it
[1:37:13] did vindicated
[1:37:14] but it's more than vindication that God
[1:37:17] sent a prophet it was it was dedicating
[1:37:19] a message and if the message is preach
[1:37:22] again he'll also have the same
[1:37:25] vindication the signs follow those that
[1:37:29] believe and man Jesus said the things
[1:37:32] that I do so you do also he said the
[1:37:36] Bible said go into all the world preach
[1:37:37] the gospel to every creature these signs
[1:37:40] have followed them every one of them
[1:37:42] that believes he denies ever bidden she
[1:37:44] denies on the supernatural she swapped
[1:37:47] it for his intellectual conception of
[1:37:49] the Bible where theologians have put
[1:37:52] their own interpretation to it and God
[1:37:55] left them set their dead it's 12 o'clock
[1:37:59] midnight you see it's a time where
[1:38:05] there's a another seed has been planted
[1:38:08] to crowd out the true wheat this is what
[1:38:13] brother Branham said would talk about
[1:38:15] and see the discrepancy also in the last
[1:38:17] year of his ministry he talked about
[1:38:20] harvest time and he said there's been
[1:38:22] two seeds so the Son of Man has went
[1:38:26] forth
[1:38:26] that's Christ the word has went forth so
[1:38:28] in his seed the enemy has went forth so
[1:38:32] in his seed so to see the discrepancy
[1:38:36] contrary to the Word of God and and he
[1:38:40] says and then he goes to describe in
[1:38:43] this just discrepancy when a man stands
[1:38:45] and says he's a
[1:38:47] gospel preacher and sin since the days
[1:38:50] of miracles has passed that is cedar
[1:38:52] discrepancy when a man stands and says
[1:38:56] he's a minister pastor of a church
[1:38:58] somewhere and does not believe that
[1:39:00] Jesus Christ is the same in every detail
[1:39:03] except the physical body same yesterday
[1:39:06] today and forever
[1:39:07] that see the discrepancy when he says
[1:39:10] miracles and apostolic ages past that is
[1:39:14] see the discrepancy when they say
[1:39:16] there's no such thing as divine healing
[1:39:18] that is see the discrepancy and the
[1:39:21] world is full of it and it crowds out
[1:39:23] and chokes out the wheat so see the
[1:39:27] discrepancy now I want to talk just a
[1:39:30] moment I I'm gonna bring you back into
[1:39:32] some review which I can do not just
[1:39:36] cause I'm old but because I'm also the
[1:39:39] pastor here I want to just bring
[1:39:41] something back to your memory again
[1:39:43] because you know as I have studied long
[1:39:48] time for years and pondered and wondered
[1:39:53] how did the divine healing movement die
[1:39:58] God didn't change his attitude didn't
[1:40:04] change his word didn't change so what
[1:40:08] happened
[1:40:09] you know the divine healing died because
[1:40:12] of men's ego and kingdom building not
[1:40:17] because it God quit healing let's just
[1:40:21] get it straight God still heals God
[1:40:24] would send an angel to a man of God send
[1:40:26] him out with a gift to divine healer -
[1:40:28] and and even the Pentecostals would
[1:40:32] stand up in his meetings and prophesy
[1:40:34] not knowing that had been said on the
[1:40:36] river on the Ohio River in 1933 that as
[1:40:40] john the baptist was sent to forerun the
[1:40:42] first coming of christ here sit with a
[1:40:44] message to vote run his second coming
[1:40:46] and then the Pentecostals would do the
[1:40:48] same thing
[1:40:49] down here down in Houston Texas a man
[1:40:51] recall cowboy boots would speak in
[1:40:55] tongues and another man would jump up
[1:40:56] and interpret it and it would be the
[1:40:59] same thing that the man coming to the
[1:41:01] platform is as john the baptist was sent
[1:41:04] to forerun the first coming of christ he
[1:41:07] is sent to forerun the second coming
[1:41:08] then it would be honest Raider and Kalyn
[1:41:11] Kansas who is stand up and prophesied
[1:41:14] the very same thing his brother branham
[1:41:16] came to the poor but what I'm trying to
[1:41:17] tell you tell you is the Pentecostals
[1:41:20] knew they knew it was it was for running
[1:41:24] the second coming that God was doing
[1:41:27] some extreme things get a people ready
[1:41:30] for his coming to turn their hearts back
[1:41:33] to believing again
[1:41:37] now before then the majority of
[1:41:43] Christians didn't know that sickness was
[1:41:45] from the devil hello before then the
[1:41:50] majority of Christians believe that
[1:41:53] sickness was from God and they believed
[1:41:59] as many do yet today that God placed
[1:42:01] sickness upon people to discipline or
[1:42:04] refine them or to bring glory to himself
[1:42:06] by allowing sickness and suffering and
[1:42:10] that has been preached that lie has been
[1:42:13] preached over and over and over again
[1:42:16] until it's ingrained and so many people
[1:42:19] today that it's God's will for me to be
[1:42:21] sick how could i how can I be
[1:42:24] healed unless I know his will and here's
[1:42:32] the will of God saying over and over and
[1:42:35] over I'm the Lord God that healeth thee
[1:42:37] of all thy diseases and he can't change
[1:42:40] his mind
[1:42:42] so he can't change his will and then
[1:42:45] you're still wondering is it God's will
[1:42:47] you know that was a condition that the
[1:42:56] church world was in after seeing the
[1:42:59] miracles and the crowds and the
[1:43:00] potential for money and popularity there
[1:43:03] was many impersonators searched to the
[1:43:05] to the field now many of them maybe
[1:43:09] start out with sincere desires to help
[1:43:12] you helps people but they didn't stay
[1:43:15] with the pure goals and the purpose that
[1:43:18] William Branham had and this brought
[1:43:22] about an AIDS of impersonations has been
[1:43:25] prophesied in the Bible this has brought
[1:43:27] us to perilous times and we're going to
[1:43:31] look at it in the Bible and compare it
[1:43:33] with the first Exodus but look here in
[1:43:35] 2nd Timothy 3 and 1 notice always also
[1:43:38] that in the last days perilous times
[1:43:40] shall come
[1:43:42] now we're gonna see the condition men be
[1:43:44] lovers of their own selves that's
[1:43:46] Laodicean self lovers rich increase me
[1:43:51] good have need of nothing god i don't
[1:43:53] even need you lovers of them own selves
[1:43:57] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:44:02] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[1:44:07] without natural affection trucebreakers
[1:44:09] false accusers incontinent whether that
[1:44:14] means without sexual restraint fierce
[1:44:17] despisers of those that are good
[1:44:20] traitors heady highminded lovers of
[1:44:24] pleasures more than lovers of god having
[1:44:26] a form of godliness
[1:44:29] oh yeah religious churchgoers come on
[1:44:35] that believe Jesus I love Jesus having a
[1:44:39] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:44:41] thereof now what power we're talking
[1:44:45] about denying the power to live
[1:44:48] for coming life hey ma'am and he said
[1:44:52] from such turn away for this sort are
[1:44:56] they which will creep in the houses and
[1:44:58] lead captives silly women laden with
[1:45:01] sins let away with divers lust don't you
[1:45:04] know that women are today our prey of
[1:45:07] the devil going out into our society
[1:45:11] convincing them that of equality and
[1:45:14] freedom to go topless and public to kill
[1:45:17] their babies tor doing silly women laden
[1:45:21] with Sam's come on now and the same
[1:45:24] thing today you know goes right down
[1:45:26] silly women women who won't be subject
[1:45:29] to the word of God amen let away with
[1:45:33] divers lusts he said it would be in this
[1:45:35] deceitful age and we come right down to
[1:45:39] it it's not just women but it's the
[1:45:41] churches who are women also silly women
[1:45:45] laden with daggers lost we want a
[1:45:48] million more and 44 we we want more
[1:45:50] names we want more membership with and
[1:45:52] first thing you know that the trucks is
[1:45:54] a cage full of every unclean and hateful
[1:45:57] bird and every kind of evil spirit is
[1:46:00] sitting on the pews churches leading
[1:46:06] away with sins with divers lusts ever
[1:46:09] learning huh more why you you you could
[1:46:15] feel this whole church with religious
[1:46:18] literature today written by theologians
[1:46:21] of all kinds more books than ever come
[1:46:24] on ever learning never able to come to
[1:46:27] the knowledge of the truth then it comes
[1:46:29] down and says now as Jenison jamberries
[1:46:33] withstood Moses so do these also resist
[1:46:37] the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[1:46:41] concerning the faith but deysa
[1:46:43] proceeding further for their folly shall
[1:46:46] be made manifest shall be manifest unto
[1:46:48] all men as there's also where now notice
[1:46:52] he names them Janus and Jeffries not
[1:46:55] even written in the Old Testament but in
[1:46:57] the New Testament is written
[1:46:59] what their names are Janice and Jambres
[1:47:01] withstood Moses and we know what they
[1:47:04] did here comes Moses out with the sign
[1:47:07] any man and his sign was he had a staff
[1:47:11] in his hand and he would throw it down
[1:47:14] it would become a snake a Cobra right
[1:47:18] and then then the house as it was
[1:47:21] crawling crawling over he'd go over
[1:47:24] there pick it up and would come to the
[1:47:26] snake again he was showing the power
[1:47:29] that was in the message to bind
[1:47:33] Pharaoh's kingdom under the signing of
[1:47:38] Cobra hey man you know that the chief of
[1:47:41] demons and he had the power there and he
[1:47:44] walks into Pharaoh's court and said I've
[1:47:46] got the power to bind you loose you hey
[1:47:51] man but what happened a couple of
[1:47:54] midgets magicians come out Janice and
[1:47:57] Jen briefs they're gonna they're gonna
[1:47:59] imitate what he did to hardened the
[1:48:02] heart of Pharaoh to keep them in bondage
[1:48:05] now God has a desire for his people to
[1:48:08] be free free from organization free from
[1:48:11] men's ideas come on I've been free to
[1:48:14] serve him with all her heart that's what
[1:48:16] God wanted for Israel but there was
[1:48:18] certain men Jenison jamberries who was
[1:48:21] inspired to harden the hearts of a rotor
[1:48:24] to keep him from to cause him to not let
[1:48:28] the people go what to keep them in
[1:48:30] Egyptian bondage are you with me keep
[1:48:34] him if we would bring him today in the
[1:48:36] organization and denomination a man and
[1:48:39] band that Mike reasoned darkness rather
[1:48:42] than being free to serve the Living God
[1:48:45] hey man now you say how did they do it
[1:48:48] you said brother Tim they did that by
[1:48:50] Satan's power Satan can't create and
[1:48:53] Satan can heal is that right they were
[1:48:57] they were using that we're using God's
[1:49:00] power
[1:49:01] I meant to imitate Moses gift
[1:49:07] you see that's what people don't
[1:49:09] understand
[1:49:10] the Bible tells you that there will be
[1:49:12] anointed ones in the end time and they
[1:49:16] would have true anointing yet defaults
[1:49:18] seed so there are no any ones at the end
[1:49:23] time the Bible said the Bible said in
[1:49:27] Mathew 24:24
[1:49:29] that that that there would arise false
[1:49:32] Christ's plural in other words that
[1:49:36] would be many saying I'm anointed a man
[1:49:40] saying I am anointed but they're false
[1:49:42] and they're false prophets of course you
[1:49:46] talk about brother Branham being a
[1:49:47] Providence verse scripture they want to
[1:49:49] point you to this don't identify brother
[1:49:51] Branham this identifies the false
[1:49:54] prophets that are out there in the world
[1:49:56] today and men that are saying I'm
[1:49:59] anointed and even show great signs and
[1:50:02] wonders so that to do what if it were
[1:50:05] possible to deceive the elect but
[1:50:07] there's something about it the elect
[1:50:09] will not be deceived now so again janus
[1:50:18] janus means he vexed he was there two
[1:50:23] vets to vet C Israelites to vex Moses
[1:50:27] man he was there Janus meaning foamy
[1:50:31] healer voet my foamy healer in other
[1:50:36] words blowed up with a lot of air and
[1:50:40] these were the two Egyptian magicians
[1:50:42] who were in the presence of Pharaoh who
[1:50:45] imitated the miracles of Aaron and Moses
[1:50:48] and in order to destroy his influence
[1:50:50] with the King and it worked and the
[1:50:53] Bible tells you to work in the end time
[1:50:56] because in Revelation 13:8 said that all
[1:50:59] will worship the Beast and His image
[1:51:03] except those whose names are in the
[1:51:05] Lamb's Book of Life so you see it's
[1:51:09] gonna be a whole several deception in
[1:51:11] the last day when you think about a
[1:51:13] rapture it's not going to be billions of
[1:51:15] people going it's gonna be the
[1:51:18] Oh God going in a rapture yeah they'll
[1:51:22] be built there maybe billions by the
[1:51:24] time the resurrection but out of this
[1:51:26] age a handful in comparison are you with
[1:51:31] me
[1:51:32] this is a time of darkness upon the
[1:51:34] earth a time war impersonators abound
[1:51:39] Jenison jamberries who withstood Moses
[1:51:42] with their impersonations who are able
[1:51:44] to convince many not to get under the
[1:51:47] blood don't apply the token don't take a
[1:51:51] lamb you know some Jewish scholars say
[1:51:54] it was only one in fiber Israelites that
[1:51:56] left Egypt with Moses meaning that
[1:52:00] nearly 20% only 20% of the Israelites
[1:52:04] left Egypt and of course this was
[1:52:07] demoralize the others you think about
[1:52:10] how how its hurt you
[1:52:12] for so many of your friends and loved
[1:52:15] ones and and relatives too to be pulled
[1:52:18] away and I had to send some secular
[1:52:21] religion and lastest loss can be and of
[1:52:28] course this would cause many to go back
[1:52:31] to Egypt in their heart as they were
[1:52:33] there along the journey but let's just
[1:52:35] go back for a moment as I have said God
[1:52:39] was doing some extreme things in our
[1:52:41] generation an angel would come in 1946
[1:52:47] he would come there as brother branham
[1:52:50] was there in prayer about his
[1:52:52] misunderstood life because preachers
[1:52:55] were saying that it was a devil that was
[1:52:58] upon him and he kept hearing the voice
[1:53:00] of God speak and telling of situations
[1:53:03] and so on and his pastors and that's the
[1:53:05] devil man you better get away from that
[1:53:07] and he said I don't want to be a devil
[1:53:09] so there he when he felt it as the
[1:53:12] Spirit of God moved over on him he went
[1:53:15] into his cabin there near a cave and
[1:53:18] there he went into prayer and the angel
[1:53:22] Lord visited that night a little
[1:53:26] Kentucky preacher and it's heralded one
[1:53:29] of the greatest divine healing moves
[1:53:31] I'm going to say it's been the greatest
[1:53:33] divine healing movement ever God waited
[1:53:37] to this generation to do it to display
[1:53:40] before the Gentiles the same thing that
[1:53:44] he did when he walked the shores of
[1:53:46] Galilee to sell himself the same healer
[1:53:49] the same deliver the same Savior and
[1:53:53] then to get you to stop believing hey
[1:53:57] man it was two four run the second
[1:53:59] coming of Christ as I said to get you to
[1:54:01] start believing again to return us back
[1:54:04] to the faith anybody ought to know when
[1:54:07] we look at it I mean yeah look at we got
[1:54:09] 40,000 different denominations and every
[1:54:13] one of them call in the South to faith
[1:54:14] and yet there's only one Lord one faith
[1:54:17] one baptism one God one father of us all
[1:54:21] is that the Bible amen so how do we get
[1:54:24] 40,000 of one there's only one and they
[1:54:28] can't all be right so God would have to
[1:54:33] show us what is right the coming of the
[1:54:41] angel to brother Branham would start the
[1:54:46] divine healing movement which would
[1:54:48] inspire asleep in church and awaken
[1:54:50] their faith trying to help spread the
[1:54:55] word there were men that rose up to help
[1:54:57] brother Branham and you know while he's
[1:55:00] praying for the sick and and fasting and
[1:55:03] talking to the Lord and in having
[1:55:05] visions they would they would do the the
[1:55:08] groundwork and setting up meetings and
[1:55:11] purchasing a tent and you know doing
[1:55:14] things to help whatever they could and
[1:55:17] they organized so the voice of healing
[1:55:20] with a magazine with the same name and
[1:55:23] virtual is use exclusively to inform the
[1:55:27] public of brother Bradley's meetings
[1:55:28] that testimonies and miracles and so was
[1:55:32] to inform the people but you know
[1:55:34] brother Branham wanted nothing to do
[1:55:36] with with the money or the popularity
[1:55:39] derivative that was derived from the
[1:55:41] angelic visitation and from the result
[1:55:44] miracles so he allowed men like Gordon
[1:55:48] Lindsay Jack mower here from life
[1:55:49] Tabernacle in Shreveport to take over
[1:55:52] the day and make a little organization
[1:55:54] in a magazine because he was a man too
[1:55:58] sincere to dedicate it to God service to
[1:56:03] desire a big organization in the kingdom
[1:56:06] for himself and and then and just a
[1:56:09] little later on it you know just he said
[1:56:12] it's too much it's too much for me I I I
[1:56:15] got kid I don't believe in organization
[1:56:19] and and my this was organized just so
[1:56:22] tight I want to be free where God can
[1:56:24] lead me and he just would give up the
[1:56:26] voice of healing give up his magazine I
[1:56:29] don't want it I don't want the money I
[1:56:31] don't want nothing another battle all I
[1:56:33] want to do is help God's people let's
[1:56:37] say thank God for somebody that sincere
[1:56:39] a man so sincere that they would come
[1:56:42] and offer him a half a million dollars
[1:56:45] or more at a time to take and he would
[1:56:48] return it down said I don't want it
[1:56:53] listen he wasn't too simple or too
[1:56:55] illiterate or too naive to build the
[1:56:57] kingdom for himself but he wasn't that
[1:57:00] at all he was capable you know he could
[1:57:03] have surrounded himself with men and
[1:57:05] been a Multi multi multi-millionaire but
[1:57:10] he just wanted to introduce Jesus Christ
[1:57:12] to the world and show to the people that
[1:57:15] God still cares for his people I think
[1:57:19] that's what our message is gotta be
[1:57:21] about today and we really are preaching
[1:57:23] the message it ought to be a message God
[1:57:26] still cares about his people
[1:57:30] he's still concerned about the sick no
[1:57:34] matter what the situation is it would be
[1:57:37] a decade later 1955 that brother Branham
[1:57:40] would take a careful examination of his
[1:57:43] ministry and by this time the fields was
[1:57:47] crowded with competitors you know men
[1:57:51] who had run you know say been inspired
[1:57:54] that God would heal but now and it
[1:57:56] turned into who can have the biggest -
[1:57:58] that's the biggest ten who has the most
[1:58:00] subscribers to the magazine and it all
[1:58:03] began to be about preachers and the ego
[1:58:05] I'm trying to tell you why divine
[1:58:08] healing movement died he didn't die cuz
[1:58:11] God died he didn't die because God quit
[1:58:14] the healing business it is it didn't die
[1:58:17] just because it got Ben Decatur the
[1:58:19] messenger never and then quit quit quit
[1:58:21] doing that anymore no it's his word but
[1:58:28] yet the man with the angel who came to
[1:58:30] him and was the most gifted had no
[1:58:36] magazine no tent no ego just a sincere
[1:58:39] desire to help God's people on the other
[1:58:43] hand all Roberts who came to see what
[1:58:46] was going on and said would God hear my
[1:58:48] prayer brother Branham and he goes out
[1:58:50] and he builds a university named it
[1:58:52] after himself of are you and he joins
[1:58:55] the United Methodist Church because they
[1:58:56] offered more leniency and doctrine and
[1:58:59] moral issues and Pentecostal Holiness
[1:59:01] Church and so he positioned himself as a
[1:59:04] mainstream denomination to be more
[1:59:08] accepted and then you know you remember
[1:59:14] I told you and it's on the tapes 1955
[1:59:19] brother Branham will abruptly quit and
[1:59:21] go home because it was not enough money
[1:59:23] to cover the campaigns and he had
[1:59:26] promised god I'll never beg the people
[1:59:29] for money we take up an offering but
[1:59:31] I'll never beg him for money and and and
[1:59:34] there was the the men there was saying
[1:59:36] to let us let us beg the people you know
[1:59:39] for some money they'll give more
[1:59:41] he said no I promise God will pass the
[1:59:44] plate if that doesn't do it you know
[1:59:46] then and then way you know we we won't
[1:59:49] do anything I'll quit I'll go home we've
[1:59:52] got to pay the bill
[1:59:53] he was $15,000 in debt this is
[1:59:56] equivalent to about a hundred and thirty
[1:59:58] thousand dollars and our money today and
[2:00:03] during the Dern subsequent
[2:00:07] investigations it was found that his
[2:00:09] manager Gordon Lindsey of the the voice
[2:00:13] of healin was taken most of the money
[2:00:16] for his own use it says in wikipedia
[2:00:19] tells us that Lindsey made $80,000 to
[2:00:25] manage brother branham's campaigns what
[2:00:27] brother branham made the equivalent of
[2:00:29] sixty-two thousand dollars so you know
[2:00:33] again you know what ones making excuse
[2:00:37] me let me let me read this verbatim said
[2:00:40] brother Branham had the salary of seven
[2:00:42] thousand where Lindsay made eighty
[2:00:44] thousand to manage his campaigns in
[2:00:46] today's money brother Branham made a
[2:00:49] salary of sixty-two thousand while
[2:00:51] Lindsay pocketed seven hundred and fifty
[2:00:54] thousand for the year and all of this
[2:00:57] went to the voice a healing Foundation
[2:00:58] which he later changed her name to
[2:01:01] Lindsay's Christ for the nation in
[2:01:03] Dallas Texas built a Bible School you
[2:01:06] see it's just like Elijah
[2:01:08] you know when Elijah went here when the
[2:01:11] lights are refused the money from naming
[2:01:13] the leper you don't get haze' the
[2:01:15] servant took it in becoming a leper you
[2:01:19] know brother Brown didn't want the money
[2:01:20] well Lindsey did and he building kingdom
[2:01:22] with it and I'm an complete with a Bible
[2:01:26] School so you see it wasn't at all that
[2:01:29] God had failed to provide it was that
[2:01:33] men with their own greed and agendas was
[2:01:35] misusing the funds and again now the the
[2:01:39] field was crowded with impersonators
[2:01:42] telling the biggest tip the most
[2:01:44] miracles that the most on the television
[2:01:48] and television programs to exploit them
[2:01:51] and
[2:01:52] the man who had been visited by the
[2:01:54] angel with the real message was pushed
[2:01:59] aside by the masses he's the only one
[2:02:08] with a real gift
[2:02:11] only one met by an angel the others are
[2:02:15] running off of his reputation like I
[2:02:20] said I spoke to you about Jaco
[2:02:22] he came to see he was a simile God
[2:02:25] preacher he came to brother branham's
[2:02:27] meetings he was a skeptic he didn't he
[2:02:31] he just didn't believe all the reports
[2:02:32] that God was healing and doing what he
[2:02:35] was doing and he thought that was a sham
[2:02:37] so he went out there to to it to watch
[2:02:40] it and see and find out there was a sham
[2:02:42] for herself
[2:02:43] there was a man that was blind with no
[2:02:45] eyeballs brother Branham told him on the
[2:02:48] platform in three days it will be
[2:02:50] eyeballs form in your head and after
[2:02:52] that you'll see and brother Jack Jack
[2:02:56] Kui he scoffed said anybody could say
[2:02:59] that's and you know yeah I mean he's
[2:03:02] gonna disappear into the crowd and and
[2:03:04] and and go out we'll never know we'll
[2:03:07] never know whether or not they're ever
[2:03:08] eyeballs ever formed we'll never know
[2:03:10] this so he was a skeptic and he's
[2:03:13] sitting on the platform and his brother
[2:03:15] branham exited the platform he stopped
[2:03:17] by stopped and he touched jack on the
[2:03:19] knee and prayed softly and said jack
[2:03:21] he's already said that sir you're not
[2:03:23] sick you're just worn down from
[2:03:25] preaching meetings and don't be
[2:03:27] skeptical you were doubting whether this
[2:03:28] was of God I want to tell you this is of
[2:03:31] God and we're both fighting the same
[2:03:32] devil go and continue a revival for you
[2:03:35] were also called to pray for the sick
[2:03:39] Jack said he left a meeting that day he
[2:03:42] said on cloud nine you know he was gonna
[2:03:45] have a he's called to pray for the sick
[2:03:47] too but I he he come back on the third
[2:03:50] day to see if that man should back up
[2:03:53] who knew who was prayed forward no I
[2:03:55] boss said that he found him found him in
[2:03:59] the crowd there and he had found him
[2:04:00] that eyeballs had formed in his head
[2:04:02] and by evening the blind man was seeing
[2:04:05] and he's satting all over the place man
[2:04:09] because he said William Branham was
[2:04:11] raised up for dispensational purposes
[2:04:15] hey man no but then you know it would
[2:04:19] turn out to be who has the biggest ten
[2:04:21] who has the most subscribers who's the
[2:04:24] most popular on television
[2:04:26] you'd have oil Jagger's another man who
[2:04:28] would get inspired a similar God
[2:04:30] preacher inspired by the miracles and
[2:04:32] started our prior tribes humbly but
[2:04:35] seeing that he could be enriched with
[2:04:37] the crowds not having gifts or an
[2:04:39] angelic visitation he got he's got sort
[2:04:43] of promoting the sale of blood and oil
[2:04:46] and and that he sold for the purpose of
[2:04:50] healing and vitamins from the Dead Sea
[2:04:52] and baptizing people into eternal life
[2:04:54] claiming they would never die all kinds
[2:04:57] of fanaticism and the same thing that
[2:05:00] would happen the oral would turn and
[2:05:02] clean the power of God in his right hand
[2:05:05] and then turn off to a prosperity gospel
[2:05:07] you know planning the fee to see the
[2:05:10] faith in my ministry and send me money
[2:05:12] and God bless you and you know
[2:05:14] financially in return he joined the more
[2:05:18] liberal Methodists and song deny his
[2:05:20] Pentecostal roots you know here give
[2:05:23] this since their folly what's being made
[2:05:26] manifest and I'll tell you what is even
[2:05:30] going to be worse than that I mean when
[2:05:33] God takes this bride up and takes you in
[2:05:36] a rapture and the rest are left behind
[2:05:38] for the tribulation come that's when the
[2:05:41] folly of all of this other nonsense will
[2:05:45] be made manifest but I'll tell you what
[2:05:48] once you just stay true to the Word of
[2:05:50] God
[2:05:51] amen because God's gonna have a rapture
[2:05:54] for a church now I just want to cover
[2:05:57] some things and I'm trying to hurry but
[2:06:01] in 1955 brother Branham has a tenth
[2:06:03] vision he's shunned at third Pole I
[2:06:06] throw that which is third phase of his
[2:06:09] ministry three phases first he's shown
[2:06:12] the managers are mishandling there's
[2:06:14] money misusing the funds that their
[2:06:16] emphasis was of money saw them taking an
[2:06:19] offering but no altar call was given and
[2:06:21] brother Branham said when did they
[2:06:23] offering become more important in souls
[2:06:27] and they said well we dismissed the
[2:06:30] meeting we took the operon and and the
[2:06:33] end he said what you know they said so
[2:06:36] they've come again so whenever when will
[2:06:38] they be here
[2:06:39] well what time does the next service are
[2:06:41] anytime he said there won't be nobody
[2:06:43] here you the the campaigns are
[2:06:46] mismanaged you there won't be nobody
[2:06:48] here and one of them turned over to me
[2:06:51] and said well what in Christ left foot
[2:06:53] twelve when he told him the truth
[2:06:56] identifying what would happen if you
[2:06:59] stay with the truth the masses are gonna
[2:07:01] leave and this was a fall of the divine
[2:07:06] healing campaigns it became about money
[2:07:08] prestige popularity and you know and
[2:07:11] nobody nobody who wanted to attract
[2:07:15] crowds and the masses would preach the
[2:07:18] truth so now holiness is a priest
[2:07:22] righteousness isn't preached you know
[2:07:25] yes God's gonna bless him give me money
[2:07:27] and god bless you and here here it goes
[2:07:31] right on down a prosperity gospel
[2:07:33] believe anything you want to turns right
[2:07:36] out into the charismatic movement let me
[2:07:38] let me tell you friends God's gonna have
[2:07:40] a people who will walk with the word who
[2:07:43] believes a Bible faith of Bible doctrine
[2:07:46] a Bible truth who preached Bible
[2:07:49] holiness
[2:07:50] hi ma'am there are people who stand for
[2:07:53] God in this last day who will do
[2:07:55] exploits in trouble about the
[2:08:00] impersonators brother branham was
[2:08:02] seeking the Lord and he had this vision
[2:08:04] of the tenth vision the third poll were
[2:08:07] miracles were performed in a little room
[2:08:10] away from the eyes of the impersonators
[2:08:12] the third poll is to open the word to
[2:08:15] greater deliverance it was to open the
[2:08:18] seals does open the mysteries that close
[2:08:20] that he closed the promises of God to us
[2:08:23] in the tenth vision part of the third
[2:08:26] poll he he saw the working of miracles
[2:08:30] that couldn't be impersonated there were
[2:08:33] miracles and healings and delivers that
[2:08:36] were brought on by the word being
[2:08:39] released under the influence of the
[2:08:41] mighty angel now I want you to think of
[2:08:43] this for a moment because he would see
[2:08:46] out of the eyes of the impersonators he
[2:08:49] said this one will not be impersonated
[2:08:52] and he saw a piece of canvas and behind
[2:08:56] a piece of canvas in the tent was a was
[2:08:58] a was a little room about a 20 by 20 and
[2:09:02] he said that went through that little
[2:09:04] room and he said I watched him and there
[2:09:07] was a prayer line I've got a point for
[2:09:09] all of this there was a prayer line that
[2:09:12] went out around the building and down
[2:09:14] the street to come into this little room
[2:09:18] and he said I there the angel of God
[2:09:22] told me I will meet you in there and he
[2:09:26] said the things he told me in there I'll
[2:09:28] take it to my grave it will not be
[2:09:31] impersonated but I want you to get it he
[2:09:35] said I also saw that there was a prayer
[2:09:37] line that had been made our altar call
[2:09:39] rather that had been made and he said
[2:09:42] people were weeping and crying
[2:09:43] everywhere come into Christ and he said
[2:09:46] oh that looks better now won't you get
[2:09:49] something we preached about the opening
[2:09:52] of the word we preached about the seals
[2:09:54] being open we preached about the mighty
[2:09:57] angel that has revealed his word and the
[2:10:00] mysteries of God have been revealed
[2:10:02] don't we preach that but with that third
[2:10:05] pole comes an altar call are you with me
[2:10:10] you cannot be preaching the truth on
[2:10:13] this message and it don't bring people
[2:10:15] do announcer hey man and let me bring
[2:10:21] out the next point I want to bring up
[2:10:22] you cannot be preaching the third pull
[2:10:25] of this message don't have a prayer line
[2:10:28] [Applause]
[2:10:31] where miracles are happening you know
[2:10:35] today people want to claim that they're
[2:10:37] preaching the the third pull of brother
[2:10:39] branham's ministry and there's no
[2:10:41] miracles there's no sign there's no
[2:10:43] prayer line we don't even want a prayer
[2:10:44] line today we don't even pray for the
[2:10:46] sick you know you know God God you did
[2:10:50] that to vindicate a prophet same same
[2:10:52] hope Church of Christ spirit then
[2:10:54] followed there and then come up and said
[2:10:57] well that was in the days of Jesus and
[2:10:59] the possible God don't do that anymore I
[2:11:01] want you to know Jesus Christ is the
[2:11:03] same yesterday today and forever
[2:11:07] hallelujah have we really preach the
[2:11:10] message we will be bringing people to an
[2:11:12] altar took me Christ parsley and we will
[2:11:16] pray Braille up to a place where in a
[2:11:19] prayer line they can have deliverance
[2:11:26] and I I don't care how the compare line
[2:11:29] is conducted
[2:11:30] Amen I don't care which way it happens
[2:11:32] it matters not to me whether when we're
[2:11:36] preaching that someone gets healed and
[2:11:38] jumps out of their seat and runs around
[2:11:40] the building without hands being laid on
[2:11:45] them amen I think our whole church ought
[2:11:48] to be a prayer line hallelujah I think a
[2:11:51] whole church ought to be an altar I
[2:11:53] think it ought to be an atmosphere the
[2:11:56] Holy Ghost
[2:11:57] what songs were saving sinners with the
[2:11:59] later Christ that's a sick are healed
[2:12:02] the people are delivered
[2:12:08] brother branham would see it again just
[2:12:12] before preaching on the seven seals and
[2:12:15] he said a sword dropped into his hands
[2:12:18] and he said this is that third pull it's
[2:12:21] the Kings sword and I want you to know
[2:12:23] where God keeps his sword he don't keep
[2:12:26] it in a sheath God's sword is in his
[2:12:29] mouth and the sword the message God gave

[2:13:08] been vindicated

[2:16:14] everywhere those early believers went
[2:16:15] that were preaching the gospel the word

[2:17:33] bring this to a close this morning but
[2:17:36] in the Dyckman message brother Brennan
[2:17:38] said may there come forth a revival of
[2:17:40] the just how many how many years are
[2:17:43] just today the righteous and may may
[2:17:45] there come forth a revival of the
[2:17:47] righteous the just and a great power
[2:17:49] come among the church just before it's
[2:17:52] going and it's not how listen it's not
[2:17:56] hard to pray that because you promised
[2:18:00] it and we're looking Lord for that third
[2:18:02] pole that we know will do great things
[2:18:04] for us and I mixed and why Christ speak
[2:18:11] he would take Moses standing there
[2:18:14] having been commissioned and sin and
[2:18:17] rather than taking the word and use it
[2:18:20] he began to cry to God you know what
[2:18:24] must I do what must I do he said it's
[2:18:26] just like humans we get into a situation
[2:18:29] you know one day we're on the mountain
[2:18:31] glory to God look all our enemies dead
[2:18:34] we we left out of Egypt triumphantly
[2:18:37] then we get him down and we're back down
[2:18:39] in the doldrums Brotherhood victory was
[2:18:43] great there it's gonna be greater here
[2:18:46] come on God doesn't change his mind he
[2:18:49] said you're going through the promised
[2:18:51] land and I'm telling you God hasn't
[2:18:53] changed his mind either about his word
[2:18:55] there's going to be a people inherit the
[2:18:57] entire promise of God so I cried in me
[2:19:02] Moses why are you crying to me when I
[2:19:04] proved I'll be with you haven't I healed
[2:19:06] your sick haven't I told you that which
[2:19:09] had happened just exactly your posture
[2:19:12] can't do that mean he can't he's a man
[2:19:14] it's me the Lord
[2:19:18] he would say I'm the one that did this
[2:19:19] I'm the one that tells him these things
[2:19:21] to say it's not him it's my voice and
[2:19:24] I'm the one that raises up your dad when
[2:19:27] they drop down I'm the one that heals
[2:19:28] the sick
[2:19:29] I'm the one that foretells these things
[2:19:31] I'm the one that does the saving I'm the
[2:19:33] one to give the promise God give me
[2:19:37] courage to take that sword of the word
[2:19:39] that he put in my hand about
[2:19:41] thirty-three years ago and hold it and
[2:19:44] march forward to the third pole that's
[2:19:47] my prayer hallelujah he would preach the
[2:19:53] sermon called spirits of food and due
[2:19:55] season and he would tell us there's a
[2:19:58] food for a season in Asus perience of
[2:20:01] food and he said he gave the
[2:20:06] illustration there about if he's the
[2:20:13] same yesterday today and forever he run
[2:20:16] prayer lines he people come to him in
[2:20:19] great lines multitudes he touched them
[2:20:22] and blessed him come on people people
[2:20:26] are there today we don't need prayer
[2:20:28] lines we don't need laying hands on this
[2:20:30] thing sure I get it you can get it in
[2:20:32] your seat sure I get it but I'll also
[2:20:38] get it that the Bible said lay hands on
[2:20:40] the sick and they shall recover
[2:20:43] we believe in the four Gospels don't we
[2:20:45] yeah there are times out and depends on
[2:20:48] how the inspiration of the Lord comes
[2:20:50] times were the word he just spoke and it
[2:20:52] happens are you with me said the woman
[2:20:58] there came there that and that touched
[2:21:04] him Center any center but bloody she was
[2:21:06] gone her faith it made her whole so what
[2:21:09] did she do turnaround said well I don't
[2:21:11] know Lord I've had this a long time and
[2:21:14] that's what we do we get prayed for or
[2:21:16] we get a touch well you know I've had
[2:21:19] this a long time I've been waiting her
[2:21:21] this is serious now brother Tim you know
[2:21:24] if she had done that it wouldn't have
[2:21:26] happened
[2:21:27] you see that's an expression of
[2:21:29] out what have you told the symphonies
[2:21:33] and woman you know because this word
[2:21:36] that you said your daughter the devil is
[2:21:38] going out of her ass and what if she
[2:21:40] said when I Lord I wanted you to do it
[2:21:43] this way the devil would have still been
[2:21:44] in the girl but she expected to find her
[2:21:48] child the way he said she would find him
[2:21:51] are you with me
[2:21:53] hey man so he said now he told us now
[2:21:56] here again this is what he told the
[2:21:59] woman with the blood issue this is what
[2:22:00] he told us sirrah Phoenician woman by
[2:22:02] the way let me just get something
[2:22:04] straight
[2:22:04] he tells us here Phoenician woman who is
[2:22:09] crying after him since she's a Gentile
[2:22:11] and he says I'm sent to the lost sheep
[2:22:14] of the house of Israel and said is it
[2:22:17] right for me to take the children's
[2:22:19] bread and give it to dogs and of course
[2:22:23] the little woman that didn't change her
[2:22:26] didn't matter what God called her a man
[2:22:28] she just admitted the word was true and
[2:22:31] man and she just accepted it for herself
[2:22:33] but yeah even dogs get the crumbs that
[2:22:36] are under the master's table right but
[2:22:39] here's what I want you to get out of
[2:22:41] that whole saying is that he said is it
[2:22:44] right to give the children's bread
[2:22:48] divine healing so let's get it straight

[2:29:04] but I'm gonna tell you I'm not gonna be
[2:29:06] cheated of any of them you remember a
[2:29:11] man in the Bible by the name of Hezekiah
[2:29:13] and the Prophet told him your time is up
[2:29:16] amen you've come to your allotment of
[2:29:18] days and has the concert had given up
[2:29:21] and curling up and dying he set his face
[2:29:23] to the wall and he asked God for more
[2:29:24] time a man
[2:29:29] God said there's an appointed time and
[2:29:31] it was an appointed time but when a man
[2:29:33] turned to his God and says I need an
[2:29:41] extension of my life yeah I've got a
[2:29:44] sickness unto death but I don't have to
[2:29:47] die when I got a God like I got
[2:29:50] who is it either of all diseases
[2:29:55] hallelujah
[2:29:57] the Providence said thus saith the Lord
[2:30:00] set the house in order and thou shalt
[2:30:03] die not live now that's the words of a
[2:30:05] prophet and yet he turned his face to
[2:30:09] the wall and prayed unto the Lord and
[2:30:10] said I beseech you O Lord
[2:30:12] remember how I've walked before thee in
[2:30:14] truth and with a perfect heart and have
[2:30:16] done that which is good in thy sight and
[2:30:18] he wept sore and God's in His Prophet
[2:30:22] and turned him around to go back and
[2:30:24] tell him I heard his prayer and I'm
[2:30:26] extending his days hey man you remember
[2:30:33] the children of Israel they were faced
[2:30:35] with death at the time of their Exodus
[2:30:37] and there they were they were they were
[2:30:41] have a spiritual deliverance there from
[2:30:43] Egypt coming under the blood and as soon
[2:30:47] as they were accepted and become
[2:30:49] believers and children had accepted God
[2:30:51] then the enemy physical death took after
[2:30:55] him and so he had him cornered up right
[2:31:00] there on the desert side the Red Sea on
[2:31:02] one side mountain on another Pharaoh's
[2:31:04] army coming in pursuing with millions of
[2:31:07] soldiers coming in to march to overcome
[2:31:10] them now God had already shown them he
[2:31:16] could deliver him by the blood of the
[2:31:17] Lamb man but now he's going to show them
[2:31:21] physical Redemption see both for
[2:31:24] salvation and healing for the natural
[2:31:27] man and the spiritual man right so he
[2:31:31] saves him spiritually down in Egypt
[2:31:33] there from death come on he brings him
[2:31:35] right down and now he's going to bring
[2:31:37] in the physical deliverance and the
[2:31:39] Death Angel passed over knowing God had
[2:31:41] made a way of escape through the
[2:31:43] offering of the blood and they accept it
[2:31:45] now he's going to make a way of escape
[2:31:46] from physical death says like the
[2:31:50] believer as soon as he gets saved maybe
[2:31:52] a cancer has eaten him up or some
[2:31:55] disease God has redemption also through
[2:31:58] power the same that he has
[2:32:00] tension for the Soul he has redemption
[2:32:02] for the body they were saved they were
[2:32:06] sanctified they were under the blood but
[2:32:08] yet Pharaoh the enemy was going to

[2:32:11] wilderness this God showed his power of
[2:32:14] redemption for the body Redemption by
