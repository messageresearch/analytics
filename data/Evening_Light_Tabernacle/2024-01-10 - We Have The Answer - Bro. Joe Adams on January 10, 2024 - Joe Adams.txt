tonight Lord Lord as we just present this word to you God we ask you'll anoint it and you would break the bread of life to us we believe We Believe father in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'll look here in Matthew 3 and verse 13 amen we find here in Matthew 3 and verse 13 through verse 17 we find God testifying of his son so we're going to look at this tonight it says then cometh Jesus From Galilee to to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be bapt TI of thee comest thou to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went straight way out of the water and loow the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased God bless you you can have your seats tonight also want you to look over Matthew 4 this is immediately immediately following the baptism we find here in Matthew 4 then was Jesus let up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hunger and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread but he answered and he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God but that wasn't enough the devil came again he said then the devil takeen them into a holy city and he seted them on a pinnacle of the temple and he saith unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands shall bear thee up lest at any time thou shal Dash thy foot against the stone so we find here and I want to speak to you tonight if I could for just a little bit we have the answer sir how many of you have ever been questioned and you didn't have the answer makes you real feel real insecure doesn't it you feel really intimidated when somebody asked you a question that you should know but you don't have the answer but you know it's a different story when you have the answer it's a different story when somebody asked you a question or there's a problem that is presented to you and yet you have the answer you don't have to shy away in unbelief you don't have to shy away in fear you don't have to shy away in intimidation because why because you have the answer so it gives a sense of Pride it gives a sense of security it gives a sense of ownership when you have the answer and I want you to know tonight as we go into 2024 we as the bride of Christ we have the answer we have the answer to the sin question we had the answer to sickness we had the answer to cancer we had the answer to Broken homes we had the answer they sons and daughters of God going out in the world we have the answer tonight that's right we have the answer we don't have to to knock down with the devil God has given us the answer tonight so notice what we find here Satan Jesus wasn't tempted by some spirit of fear or some Spirit of depression or some other kind of little minion of the devil he was tempted by the Devil Himself cuz he find that in the scriptures there's prophecies concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Genesis 3 and ver1 15 says I'll put imy between thy seed and the woman between uh and it shall bruise thy head and it shall bruise his heel and then we find in Isaiah 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emanuel let's look at a few more Isaiah 9 and verse 6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders his name Shall be Called wonderful isn't he Wonderful Tonight counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father and he's still the Prince of Peace oh yeah we find here in Micah 5 and verse two but thou Bethlehem EP though thou be little among the the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in Israel whose goings forth had been from the old from Everlasting Hosea 11 and verse1 that he called my son out of Egypt and we're all familiar with Isaiah 53 who had believe our report and who to whom of the arm of the Lord is revealed he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he is no form of comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him and yet he was despised and rejected a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief verse four and he had borne our grief and he carried our sorrows and yet we did esteem him strick and spitten of God and he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was laid upon him and with his stripes we are healed the Bible says he was oppressed and yet he opened not his mouth all these scriptures foretelling of Jesus's coming and yet when he came Satan doubted And yet when he came to his own his own believed him not they doubted and brother Bon will tell us he says now Satan always comes with if and if he came with Jesus with the if question he comes to you in this hour with the if question he said he always comes with if that question mark always across the word if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread and notice Jesus he said Jesus never said I am the Son of God I rebuke the Satan he said it is written he said is it the father's word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God he says now in another place earnestly contending for the faith he says always Satan putting a question mark across the word of God if thou be if you be a Healer let him heal this one if it be this let it be that it's always that's the question mark and notice he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made of bread he had been fasting for 40 days and 40 nights and yet he come to Jesus at his weak point and he said if you are that promised Messiah if you are the one that's been prophesied to come if you are that seed that I've been looking for All Through the Ages if you're that one then command these stones to me made of bread you're sitting there you claim to be God and yet you're hungry yet you're whed out God had left you here by yourself if your God command the stones to me Made bread otherwise perform a miracle and then I'll believe you notice Satan trying to excite him in his mind to distrust his care of God that God placed him God ordained him God positioned him God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased see that wasn't Jesus making that declaration that was God the Father declaring that Jesus is his son in whom he is well pleased and brother Bron would tell us like this I believe that Jesus is the son of God I believe that in his body he was a man he was born of a woman just like I was but his blood was not a woman it was God and Jehovah God the low God who brewed over the Earth and brw First Man Out of the Dust of the earth overshadowed Mary and brewed over her to fulfill his word and created the blood cell that brought forth the son of the Living God he says in the message of total Deliverance Jesus was completely totally man he could cry like a man he could eat like a man he could be tired like a man he was completely totally man in his physical being but in his Spirit he was completely totally God sir oh that should give you confidence tonight Church to realize that we're completely totally man we're completely totally Daughters of God but yet inside of this Humanity we're completely totally God because why God once again came to Tabernacle our Humanity deity is no longer in heaven but it's in you that's sitting here tonight almighty God had come down once again and he's making a declaration that we have the answer it's no longer you contending with the Devil with your mere flesh but almighty God has come down to give you Faith to overcome to give you life to live above sin notice now what he says you see he was tempted in all manners like we are he was a man not an angel he was a man he had desires and temptations like we do the Bible said it did he was a man not an angel above Temptation he was a man completely man that God took a complete man to bring total deliverance and he filled him with his Spirit the Holy Ghost was in him without measure and he was tempted like we were sometimes you feel when you're tempted you feel like you're all alone don't you but he had already been through that Temptation notice he was tempted like we were he was completely God he proved it when he raised the Dead when he stopped nature The Roaring Seas the mighty winds when he spoke to the trees and so forth and they obeyed him he was God inside oh brother sister we can look past the veil of our Humanity tonight you will see God inside once again otherwise what was this message for otherwise what's the purpose of having the Holy Ghost if it's not God inside he was God without measure we're god with measure notice we're men and women but we're also Christians and he's our example let us completely deliver our lives into the hands of the Holy Ghost that we might be subjects of the kingdom of God brother B goes on to say that he was totally man and he was totally God see but he surrendered his natural Parts his physical parts his own own thinking his own doing his own cares and he says I only do that which pleases the father and no wonder Satan would come in question if thou be if thou be the Son of God how can you be the Son of God when you're totally completely man and how can you be totally completely man and yet claim to be God see the question but see Satan knew that he caused man to fall in the beginning and Satan knew that from that point never have a man ever been able to overcome his vices ever to live a life free from sin every man had its own share of weaknesses he came and he was every man was guilty of sin therefore Satan questioned how can you be the son Son of God and notice he's been looking down Through the Ages looking for this one looking for that seed that was going to bruise his head cuz he had a purpose he was going to stop that seed from coming he was going to destroy that seed before that seed destroyed him but when that seed came and manifested he didn't recognize the seed nor does he recognize the seed today the Bible say he came to his own and his own received him not Scholars great Scholars Pharisees and Sadducees they long for Jesus to come they look for the coming Messiah they anticipated it and when he came they thought he would come with a full Angel salute they thought he was going to come and he was going to liberate them from Roman oppression he was going to come and he was going to set the temple in order he was going to be a Pharisee or a sadducee he was going to be a great intellectual teacher and he was going to set everything in order but when he came all right but when he came when he came he didn't come the way they thought he should come he came born in a manger he came in a stable he came in a a supposed illegitimate birth but when he came he still came the Son of God but he was unrecognized and he was questioned and brother Brown would tell us that when he when he came and he was 45 days being tempted Satan Satan HD him at his weak point and Satan loves to hit you at your weak point notice he comes but he said it is written took him to the top of the Pinnacle and set him up there if you be the Son of God cast thyself down and you know he give his father's word charging you and he said it is written it is written every place that he faced a question he answered with it is written now why would God need to be tempted because he was totally man that's right and as man he had to overcome so that when we got down to the last Age We got down to the last people there was no more another message coming no more another age promise and God got down to the finality of the finality there would be a people once again they're not relying on their flesh they're not relying on how much word they know but they're relying on one thing that it is written it is written is just as almighty God defeated Satan in his Humanity there would be a people again in the end they would defeat the same devil the same Temptations the same trials the same tempter with the same word and it were produce the same effect and he's still God tonight he's still overcoming tonight and he's still tabernacling our flesh tonight but B will tell us he says now when you get the Holy Ghost he said the first thing the Devil comes right along with Temptations when you get the Holy Ghost not playing about it when you get it and we're going to dig into that here a little bit tonight he says when you claim your healing he said you watch The Devil come right along to back her up and say it's wrong he says that's the time to stand that's the time to stand when you claim your healing because why you don't testify what you see or feel you testify of what you believe yes sir he said Jesus come along when he was baptized and straightway went to the water and a voice spoke out this is my beloved Son and I believe he's gotten down to the leot dean Church age and I believe once again he's looked down and he's claimed this is my beloved Son this is my beloved daughter this is my church this is my bride this is my people why because they're not Li relying on the words of a man they're not relying on denominations they're not relying on somebody else but they're ly on the word of God and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that come down in this hour just like it did on the day of Pentecost it came down some may have spoke in tongues but one thing for sure they were changed when they walked out and that's the same power the same anointing the same effects of the Holy Ghost tonight some of you may speak in tongues some of you may speak may have a a vision some may whatever it may be but all of us if you receive the Holy Ghost it is no longer you and your Humanity but it's almighty God living himself out and he's changed your sin nature and now you have a desire for the things of God now you have a hunger for the word but if you're still hungering for video games and hungering for YouTube and Tick Tock and all this other stuff it declares that you ain't got what you expect to have I'm not saying it's wrong to look at that but when you're feeding on it non-stop something ain't right because the Holy Ghost come down and it changes your desires notice Satan had faced a lot of Great Men Through the Ages Noah was a righteous man but he was a drunk think about it Abraham was a great man but he lied Jacob seemed like everything fell in Jacob's lap because he was a Shyer a pathological deceased Eli he was an incapable Father David a man after God's Own Heart committed adultery and had a man murdered Moses Moses was a great man but Moses had a temper oh but what am I telling you why are you saying this brother Joe because I'm telling you that all these men had their share of weaknesses but when it came down to Jesus Oh and then when when when the enemy tempted Jesus he realized he was more than just a Noah he was more than just an Abraham he was more than just a Moses there was something different about this one and let me tell you when he comes against you in this hour oh I want the devil to know this ain't Moses that your messing with this ain't Noah that you're messing with this ain't Abraham that you're messing I'm a Son of God tonight I've been born of the spirit of God and Jesus Christ is on the inside I may not overcome you with my flesh but what's on the inside of me he greater and migher than you are he realized that it was more than Moses PA church he realized that Jesus was the answer that he was the answer to all the scriptures that prophesied of a messiah he was the answer that prophesied of your healing he was the answer to the scriptures that says by your his stripes we are healed notice but Satan doubted said this can't be the Son of God there's no way if he's the son of God then why would he allow this to happen well they took him there and they beat him and they whooped him and a man ripped his beard from his from his face and he said not a word and yet the devil doubted because why because he said how could this be God and he not crucify him how could this be God and he not bring some kind of punishment upon these men when they spit in his face and pull the be his beard from his face oh but church when death met Jesus death knew that he met something different brother Bama said I can hear it coming now you hear the bump bump bump along the Cobblestone Road and and and Satan's there doubting the entire time this can't be he he can't be nothing more than just a Prophet this ain't no way this is a Son of God if he was he wouldn't be allowing this and the be of death begin to buzz around and he begin to ask oh Satan you want me to sting him now he said yeah go down there I don't believe that's God I don't believe he's the son of God I don't believe he's the one that's been prophesied to come oh let me tell you when that be of death hook his Stinger to Jesus Christ he knew right there something was different he stung Noah and Noah went by the way of the grave and he could sting Abraham and Abraham went and he stung this one but when he stung Jesus Bo Hallelujah he lost his Stinger death lost his sting oh thou Son of God here he is again in the end time church that don't have no sting to us tonight we're more than a Mass for the enemy why because we got the same Lord Jesus oh when he anchored that sting of death inside him oh death knew its maker death knew that Jesus was the answer to every question oh he knew something was different and notice brother B would tell us he said that the Old Testament had their ages just like the New Testament Gentile has seven Church ages so did the Old Testament Believers had their ages and notice Jesus came at the end of the age he came as fulfillment of the Old Testament scriptures prophesying of a messiah and if that was the case brother B would tell us and it is the rising of the Sun the same word that spoke of a groom speaks of the Bride so what are you saying brother Joe I'm saying that God still replicates himself he's already said and we find here in John 1 and verse2 but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God notice that's not your distinction that's not your declaration you don't make yourself son I can't make you a son but almighty God made you a son to them that believed him them that received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God and we find in 1 John 3 and verse one behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us notice it's the father bestowing this title of son that we should be called that word called there means to Bear a name or a title to be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God and it do not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be just like him so Satan today comes and he questions your claim as a son and daughter of God that's right he questions The Authority for you to use the word of God God he questions the distinction that God put on you that this is my beloved Son notice the Bible tells us well brother Joe how do we become a Son of God we look in 1 Corinthians 12 and: 13 the Bible says for by one Spirit are we baptized into one body whether we be jew or Gentiles whether be Bond or free we all have been made to drink in one spirit so Satan questions your experience you that's been born again again how many of you got the Holy Ghost tonight Hallelujah Satan questions you on a daily basis whether you got it or not but God already spoke a word concerning your coming Genesis we find in Genesis 1:26 let us make man in our image after our likeness we find in Genesis 2 and verse 7 the Lord God made man of the Dust of the ground and he breathed in his nostril the breath of life and Man became a living Soul we find in Ephesians 5 and verse 27 that he wants to present him s a glorious Church notice not having a spot or wrink or any such thing but that is should be holy without blemish 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I am jealous over you with The Godly jealousy for I have exposed you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ then we find in Revelations 22 and verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come so there's a word concerning a bride there's a prophecy concerning a bride so if there's a prophecy concerning a bride then that bride must come forth but Satan is there doubting if thou be if thou be see everything that Christ was we are everything that he was we are he would tell us in John 15 and verse 5 I am the vine and you are the branches no notice he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit there's got to be fruit from our lives and I understand that we find people today ministers today they don't want the fruits of the Holy Spirit they don't they think it's all emotion but it's not all emotion it is fruit that's to come forth if you're feeding off or living off the natural Vine the genuine Vine and not some man-made Vine and we know we we've been through this over and over and over brother BR talked about the grafted in limbs they'll not bear oranges or the lemon will not bear or they'll bear lemons and and they'll bear graef fruit but that that Branch ever puts forth another Branch it's going to be like the original because it's going to be living off the the life of the vine and what am I telling you that today we're not grafted in Sons and Daughters of God we're born in Sons and Daughters of God we can't help but produce what's on the inside of us a sheep don't have to manufacture wool it's a sheep it produces wool and Sons and Daughters of God we don't have to manufacture signs we don't have to manufacture speaking in tongues that happens because we're sons of God because the almighty God's on the inside and his promise nine spiritual gifts should be in operation in every local assembly that's God's word that's through a prophet so we find brother B want tell us the true belie is drawing from the same Source drawing from the same Source but notice Galatians 4 and verse four we're going to kind of get into this and just for a little bit this evening when the fullness of time was come and brother Tim I'm borrowing some of this from our conversation that you've been sharing with the ministers so I'm goingon to go along those lines for a little bit tonight so I'm going to do a little plagiarism but you know what when you're a minister there's no plagiarism it's free territor it's like Wikipedia we just go add to and take away so I'm barring from brother Tim tonight so promise I won't do half a good a job as he does but that's all right just buckle up we're going to get there notice he says but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant some of you need to get that right there you're no more a servant some of you come in church with your head down that's servant mentality you're not a servant you're a son stick your head up pull your squ shoulders back and realize I'm a son I'm no longer a servant I'm not a servant to the devil you never belong to the devil you always belong to God he said redeem means to buy back it's to restore to the original owner God God by his death the shed Blood Bought back his own see he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice the word and they follow me he says you always were a sheep always were a sheep he said you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep some of y'all should shout hallelujah and amen you're not a dog you're not a pig you don't have to slop around in the things of the world you're a son and daughter of God no that he said that's impossible for he says you're not a you're never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that's impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind there is there's no change in a species we were we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh then there had to come a day that we would hear the voice are the word see the thoughts of God that's where we were before the foundation of the world and through the ministry of Malaki 4 God is restoring a people back to those thoughts because he's turning the hearts and lives of those people back to the faith of the fathers so he sent us a message to Quicken the seed that laid on the inside to and we find but Satan he may have covered that seed up he may have put a lot of dirt on it a lot of a lot of ground on a lot of sin a lot of habits you may have a lot of scars but there'd come a day one day you would hear that voice you hear Mama Eagle scream out you wasn't made there for that chicken yard you don't look the same you don't act the same your feathers are not the same your speech is not to say all it took was one day to recognize I heard that eagle scream and you realize you wasn't an Earthbound chicken but you was a son and daughter of God you always was an eagle Church why because eagle life was on the inside not chicken life Eagle life we got an eagle message and it's worth flying into the heavenlies and get out of these Earthbound conditions we've been in notice brother Brown would tell us in the the church ages he said now comes our triumphal our triumphal Capstone on the baptism with the Holy Ghost now we're speaking about we have the answer I want you to realize tonight that that answer lays in none other than the Holy Ghost it's the holy you have to know tonight church that you have it I'm not talking about playing games I'm not talking about just being Sanctified and coming up to the borderline and and everything looks toart but yet you still got these desires on the inside I'm talking about you got to know be on the shadow of a doubt that your life has been been been been baptized with the Holy Ghost he said now comes a triumphal Capstone on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and because you are Sons God sent forth his Spirit into the son into your heart's crying Abby father notice wherefore thou are no more a servant when God fills you with the Holy Ghost you're no more servant that servant mentality is gone and now you operate as a son your name on the check is just as good as the father's name on the check it's time time some of you start writing out some checks some of you need healing some of you need deliver some of you need God to move financially I say write the checkout tonight he's still God he's still on the throne he's still moving he's still making a way write that check out tonight if thou be a Son of God you'd write it out notice Jesus he said Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross and he accomplished Redemption restoring to the original owner by means of purchase or the paying of the price and thereby placed us as Sons as much as I love brother Tim he couldn't Place me in that position as much as you love your pastor he couldn't place you in that position as much as you love your favorite preacher is or even brother brandham he couldn't place you in that position your adoption is your placing and when you get the Holy Ghost that is God signifying I'm placing you as my son and now your name on the check is just as good as my name on the check write it out he says we were hell captive by the devil but we were Sons nonetheless and he says and hear this and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart whereby you cry father father God sent forth notice he sent forth his Spirit he sent you a message to do what turned that heart I didn't know I was a Son of God living out in the world I didn't know I was a Son of God doing the things that I did but deep down inside God planted a seed there and one day and for many of you all it took was one day one day you heard from your papa you heard that that wasn't what you are you never were that but you always was a Oh I what about it silence one day you recognize you didn't have to continue living in that dark life no God came across your path in a youth meeting and what did God do God completely changed your nature changed your desires change who you are why because you are a son of God notice now because you always were a son God sent a message to you yeah he sent the Holy Ghost to place you to adopt you as a son and as adopted Sons we are to manifest the attributes of the father that's right our lives are declaring that he is here yes you understand what I'm saying your life the fruits that your life Bears should if you have the Holy Ghost not a gonna say should it will declare that he is here because what he is we are right brother B what tell us like this is now it's right to bring him back exactly like he was was at the beginning his same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from Glory unto Glory unto glory and I ask you tonight if he's to manifest today where is he doing that the prophet is no longer on the scene but God is the Holy Ghost is he's still moving in lives he's still moving he's still coming out and baptizing people he's still the same holy ghost that fell at the day of Pentecost and he's still the Holy Ghost tonight oh Church see it's back in its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with signs notice with the same signs today now they don't want the signs we're immature right we don't want signs we don't want wonders we got the word well let me tell you the distinction that you have the Holy Ghost is that signs and wonders will follow he says with the same signs the same wonders the same baptism the same kind of people acting the same way with the same power acting the same way it's been a long minute that some of you stumbled out of here but he said it would act the same with the same way the same power he said the same Sensations is from Glory unto Glory so what is the baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost brother Joe he said it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ that's what the baptism is he said notice in another place the mark of the beast and I've been studying that message today I listened to it probably three times already today and two or three times earlier this week he says but if you've been Justified that's all good how many you been Justified man every hand in the house should be up he says if you've been Sanctified that's good he says but when you received the Holy Ghost it's a finished work see God has completed his Plan of Salvation and sealed it with the baptism of of the Holy Ghost see the Holy Ghost in every place in the Bible is a finished work and God completed his work and not only is the Holy Ghost God filling us or baptizing us into his body not only is it a finished work but the Holy Ghost is also a token so we're going to look at this just for a minute Exodus 12 and verse 12 Exodus 12:12 says I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will Smite their firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I'll pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt so God provided a lamb's death of blood as an an accept accepted substitute for the firstborn see the blood on the doorpost was a token it was a sign that something died in the inhabitants place is that okay tonight see the blood was a visual sign that a lamb had died let me just say like how brother bramwood said he said when they seen those black wings coming across of death and a little boy would say Dad are you sure the blood's on on the door are you sure that the blood's on the Lin and father will look out there he say yes son the blood is there what was it the blood the blood is the answer to the question tonight of the death angel and he's the answer tonight for your questions he's the answer for your fear he's the answer for your depression he's the answer for your oppression he's the answer for complexes and family strains he's the answer for sickness and he's the answer for this dying mortality one day brother and sister this old mortal flesh of our is going to shed its rope and we're going to step into a new body we're going to step in why because the blood is the answer oh when they was getting ready to leave Egypt it had to be blood and if we're getting ready to leave this Egypt it's got to be blood again blood's got to be on the doorpost of your heart you're not making it out without it the Holy Ghost seals you see it's not something that we have to guess at we have some that want to preach that you got to have you got get Justified and you get Sanctified and and then you get rest the the Holy Ghost and then you get adopted oh my goodness how many of you know that you got adopted but some of them preach it I mean they they preach it as to guess workor you got all three and now all of a sudden you got to get adopted well the Holy Ghost is your adoption God ain't going to put his stamp over approval on some unwarranted life he ain't going to put his stamp of approval on somebody still dabbling in sin still looking at things he shouldn't look at no sir God puts his stamp of approval on a consecrated sold out Justified Sanctified born again son and daughter of God that's what he's putting his stamp of approval on see it seals you to the day of your Redemption you don't get a sealing one day and all of a sudden you got to go down a few more weeks or months or years and hope and pray you get adopted it is your adoption the Holy Ghost is your adoption it is the answer to the question to sin's question that I don't have to sin anymore I don't have those desires anymore it's the answer notice brother Brown said I used to work for a railroad company he goes and before that car could be sealed the inspector would come around to see if that car was properly loaded you know he come in he'll shake it he'll climb on the inside he'll make sure all the contents are exactly where they should be and all tied down the way they should be because he said there was going to be a rough road ahead he had to make sure that the contents on the inside of that cart would make it there and when he shut the door and put his seal on it he was verifying that the contents I've done expected it everything on the inside of here is where it needs to be the life is where it should be and I put my approval on it and and he was declaring it's going to make it at Eternal destination and what am I telling you when God gives you the Holy Ghost when God gives you that answer he is telling you right now brother and S no matter how bad leoda gets no matter how sick you get no matter how tired you get you're going to make it oh hallelujah we're going to make it Oh Glory to God you don't have to worry about falling you don't have to worry about coming short you're going to make it we got the evidence we got the answer tonight the holy ghost in the heart of a Believer is the answer he said what's the Holy Ghost doing he goes and he inspects that's the reason you can't notice I want you to hear this he goes that's the reason you can't have these things like well I spoke in tongues and I shouted and I danc in the spirit he said that don't have one thing to do with it so some of you that shouted that's fine fine we want you to shout some of you that jumped and danced in the spirit that's fine we want you to continue that some of you that spoke in tongues keep speaking in tongues but that ain't it you got to make sure that the contents are sealed that's right you got to make sure that what's on the inside of you is past inspection it's a rough road ahead look around look at Fox News look at CNN news look what's going on all around us you got to be blind deaf and dumb to not realize we're at the End of the Age oh but we got a promise we got a promise brother e oh that the con the inspector's coming through even again tonight and what is he doing he's here tonight to put his stamp on a young person to put his approval on a young person tonight they say yes you have met the requirements you have met at the contents are where they need to be and I'm going to seal you with the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption so we have a positive token brother B say the holy spirit is our token therefore when you receive the Holy Ghost you pass from Death unto life he said that's all there is to it because life is in you you can no more perish he that's born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin for the seed of God Amen the seed of God remains in him and now he can he says and now he goes and how can he sin when a sinless God is in him think about it how can you sin when a sinless God is in you but Satan says how can a sinless God be in you when you're man how never never had there been a man outside of Christ was able to withstand my vices withstand my my Temptations I I could put those images in front of them they're going to fall every time but like Jesus God's declared I go I'm going to have one that's right I'm going to have somebody I'm G to have sons and daughters of God they're going to get down there it's going to be the worst age they going to be in the midst of Satan zeden but they're going to come out they're going to be in the midst of the worst age ever known to man sin depravity on every part but they're going to keep their head up they're going to keep looking to the word they're going to keep professing why cuz it ain't them it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me that's the answer tonight to the devil's question it ain't you doing it with your Humanity it ain't you doing it because you belong to even like Tabernacle it's not you doing because you say I believe God sent a prophet it ain't you because you believe William Brad it's because almighty God had come down and sealed you with the Holy Ghost there's the answer to the devil's question there's the answer to sin's question there's the answer to the sickness question there's the answer right there and we had the answer it's not a guessing game you don't have to worry about it will I be when will it happen if you got the Holy Ghost tonight you got the answer you can walk around with your head up yes you ain't got to be intimidated because you don't know the answer because you got it tonight some of you that's born again of the Holy Ghost now so does brother Brandon preached adoption to Spirit fill people think about it notice when he was was preaching he preached the Pentecostals that claim they were born again filled with the Holy Ghost and women were cutting their hair wearing makeup some starting to wear pants and trousers men telling dirty jokes smoking cigarettes Pentecostals men living two or three times with several different women some of them having kids outside of their their their spouse and yet they're claiming Born Again Holy Ghost fill people and that's why the prophet of God said you got you claim that but you got to go on to adoption otherwise what was he telling them he tell what you got didn't work only what you received was an a portion but I'm here to tell you there's more than a portion that's been given in this hour church God had come and visit us personally in this age it's got to be more than an isua Street with the restoration of gifts or we appreciate isua it has its place but don't tie your experience to an isua sensation don't tie your experience to a speaking in tongues or a dance or a shout you tie your experience to the word of God make sure that he has come on the inside and your Natures are now changed and your desires are changed notice now love how brother Tim put this he said within the isusa Full Gospel Movement people were abandoning every vestage in standard of Holiness and they refuse to take on his name see they're Miss misbehavior prevented them from being positioned in the body their misbehavior but your behavior your obedience permits you to receive that stamp of approval that seal of the Holy Ghost see it's a token that's why the token message is so important and notice when was the token given in the evening time so I'm going to say something with without this message you couldn't receive the Holy Ghost you could receive a portion so in Luther's day they received a portion of the Holy Ghost justification and when Wesley came they received another portion of the Holy Ghost in sanctification then in the early 1900s with the isua movement they received another portion the restoration of the gifts but Malachi 4 when Malachi 4 came that's when the hearts of the people begin to be turned back to the faith of the father so it would take a Malachi 4 Ministry to what bring the word of God back down to a people where it's no longer God in portion in justification and just sanctification or just gifts and shouting and dance but now in this hour through this message we once again have invited almighty God to come back and Tabernacle our Humanity oh Hallelujah church we got the answer and it ain't just some portion it's the full deal we got the answer tonight God once again is on display in this hour we have notice what he says in the token message we have a token in this day he says we've been given a token which is the anti-type of the type of the natural token he says we have been given the super natural Supreme token he didn't say isua received it he didn't say Luther received it he didn't say Wesley received it he said we received it come on some of you get the frown off your face and look at what he's telling you tonight you've received that Supreme Supernatural Supreme token never has there been an age to where the Holy Ghost can come back a people a bride that he can put his life in never notice see the previous ages only had them in portion and brother Brown would tell us he says now all that was foreshadowed had been given to this generation all that's been foreshadowed blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears for they hear what other Generations have longed for what Pentecostal they got so close but they couldn't carry over they got right up to the Border looked over and said you know what I'm not going to take on that name God said that's fine I'll have a people that will and that's why the message came and the messenger comes at the end of the age with a purpose to call out a people yes sir call out a people yes with an answer with an answer oh my oh you know let me just can I go just a little bit further notice now all that's been foreshadow has been portions of the spirit that's been but in this generation we got the fullness see it wasn't the fullness in Luther's day or Wesley's day or Zeus's day but through the message of Malachi 4 God had once again given this generation the token life see it's no longer God above us in the pillar of fire it's no longer God With Us in Christ walking with us but now it's God in us oh my oh man I think about that when I walk I knew the life I used to live and now I've been filled with the Holy Spirit and things I used to desire I don't desire no more and I trust every one of you been born again of the Holy Spirit can say the same thing the things I used to desire I don't desire no more the life I used to live I don't live anymore the things I used to do I don't do anymore why because why because you've been adopted because you've been placed because you've been sealed it's a finished work notice he would tell us that the our identification is to manifest the word of God he said these signs shall follow them that believe not just professors but identified believers they shall follow them that believe just absolutely impossible for it not to happen so these brothers that don't want the signs they don't want to be true father followers of Christ because he said it's just absolutely impossible for it not to happen the works that I do shall you do also that's the identification Jesus's identification was to manifest the word of God which he was and the church's identification today is to manifest the promised word of this day by The Same Spirit that manifested and Quicken the word then so those that are going in the Rapture how many you going in the rapture you can't have just a portion you got to have the fullness you can have you got to have more than just a confession of faith we appreciate that but you got to build on that confession and get Sanctified you got to get more than just Sanctified you got to be born again of the spirit of God brother B said you can be justified without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified without being being being the Holy Ghost filled he goes but you can never receive the Su but what first you got to go through all these channels notice a person can do all this and still not have the Holy Spirit see you can be justified without being Sanctified and Sanctified without having a holy ghost but when it comes to finish both justification and sanctification the Seal of the Lord Jesus Christ by the baptism is put on you so that's what we want church and the message is to bring back the word you believe that and Christ is the word so if the message is to bring back the word which is Christ and how could you be filled with the Holy Spirit in fullness prior to the message so it's more than just a baptism of Holy Ghost on the spirit realm that we want it's more than just an emotional response of rejoicing and shouting and if Aza movement and its predecessors like Luther and Wesley was the final quickening then why did we need the message why did we need the message to come because the message is bringing back Christ Christ not just in letter form not just in tape form but it's bringing back Christ in Bride form it's bringing back Christ in word form the word once again made flesh and dwelling Among Us your neighbor if you look at it look past that Veil that's the word made flesh and all their failures and all their flaws it's still the word made flesh for those who receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the answer it's the token it's the literal life it's the proof that you have died to self and to the things of the world and you had been sealed it's your identification that you are in fact a son and daughter of God it's the fact that the life of the father is living in you and brother Brown I'm I'm gonna close here in just a few minutes he said there's been churches churches and there have been Brides brides churches and Brides he said but there has to come one there's been claims put on as being the bride through many generations but they only had a portion and yet they had a claim but he said there has to come one that's both Dynamics and the mechanics preach the gospel is not just preaching it like I am right now with voice but he said to preach the gospel is to demonstrate the power of the word of God to make that word do what it says it will do to make that word perform what it says it would do that's what is bringing back or that's what the Holy Ghost is to do in this hour is to declare that the same word the same signs the same wers is among the same people professing the same life so the bride he said the he said and being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of to him I'm just going to skip over some things now so the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride see God forsaw the bride in the groom and Jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship oh Pentecost he said the Pentecostal experience today the coming of the Holy in the last days as promised is the abstract to the title deed come on somebody do you realize what that is how many of you got a deed to a car some of y'all ain't paid your car off that's okay but you get a deed to that car but you know what you got that D but it don't mean that there ain't a claim put on that D somebody may still have a lean on it but all let me tell you when you get an abstract to that de here what is this telling it's telling you everything that's ever been put on that title everything there's been a search all the way down through the resources and everything had been struck off and now you received an abstract title anything that Mama did grandpaa did whatever it may have done it don't matter it's been struck off and you received the abstract and the Holy Ghost is the abstract title it says you have passed from Death unto life you can't no more die than what God can die why you got an abstract and the Holy Ghost is the abstract church you've been accepted every thing struck off brother Tim it's gone ain't no depression ain't no anxiety ain't no fear ain't no complex ain't no family straight it struck off we got an abstract I said we got the abstract tonight we got the answer there ain't no claim on it Satan comes around buzzing tormenting you the prophet of God said you can wave your token wave your token before for what you telling them I don't belong to you I got a dabstract I got the token I got the answer I got the answer I got the answer we got the answer to cancer we got the answer to Broken homes we got the answer to Broken marriages we got the answer to prodal we got the answer tonight because God saw fit to give us an abstract to give you the token to give you a seal and it ain't something you got to guess about it's something you know it's something you know the abstract it means the debt has been settled no more question whether you're good enough or not we got an abstract no more question whether you're saved or not you got an abstract no more questions whether you can be healed or not you got an abstract you got the answer no more questions about being a son and daughter of God you know because you have an answer you have an abstract brother B said what's an abstract means it searched all the way back to the beginning oh I love that oh Hallelujah church let me bring this to a close musicians if you would come skip over a little bit here brother man said if you believe the message of the Bible and the present message of the day a Vindication of it the reason you're sitting here is because you were predestinated to sit here you wouldn't be here otherwise you would You' been on the street maybe a drunk brother Johnny we've been there been on the street drunk gambling partying womanizing but that ain't who we are now oh Satan tried to put a claim on you yeah for God Struck it off that's my son struck off Struck it off he don't even remember it brother Johnny it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness thank God he don't remember what we used to do thank God he don't remember what we used to be only thing God looks at he looks Through The Eyes of his word and he says that was a thought in my mind before the foundation of the world and what they're doing down there hey you know what I'm going to get them into an atmosphere where I can put my seal upon them I'm going to get them in the at for on a Wednesday night where they can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that I can give them an abstract title deed and I can reassure them everything down Through the Ages everything down through family strength every bit I've been struck off tonight by because I've given them the abstract title notice Satan comes if thou be a Son of God he'd been looking for your coming he purposed give me some preacher cores Andrew he been looking he got a focus I'm going to stop that seed if thou be if thou be if you're a real believer then you wouldn't do this if you're a real believer you wouldn't do this how in the world can you claim that you're a real believer when you're totally man how can you say God's on the inside when you're totally man and you got your flaws for Tony you got your failures you got your mistakes well if God's on the inside there ain't no way that that's living inside of that right there let me tell you what your Prophet says he said I'm talking about the headship of Christ notice now being personally identified by the original headship oh not the headship of Pentecost not the headship of Presbyterian not the headship of some denomination not the headship in Jeffersonville but the headship the original headship the head Jesus Christ coming down to the body oh hallelujah what he doing giving that body life giving that body life and that body is coming forth oh listen what the prophet said he says we had the answer to the devil's question amen glory we had the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and he paid the price and he's raising up the body oh I tell you don't get happy down here he's raising up the body oh see he says we got the devil's answer not me that liveth but Christ were living in me it's not my idea it's his power it's not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and it's here he says we we got the answer Christ has risen and he's paid the price of our Redemption what God in Christ manifested he gave that flesh that the blood that's in the blood might come into the life and the flesh be redeemed and he said listen now he said and that God in this redeem flesh could manifest his word for this day and it says just as he did in that day there's the answer that God in this redeemed flesh can manifest the same signs the same wonders the same word the same power as he did in that flesh Oh my he said Woo Glory think about it God in this redeemed flesh there's the answer my you don't like the answer do you it's the answer amen God in this redeemed flesh he said we have the answer to the devil's question we have Satan's answer God has Vindicated himself God proves himself to his promise in this day Hallelujah the headship is here amen Christ the Risen Lord he is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the answer to the question look what what what Jesus was 2,000 years ago the bride is tonight in 2024 and if got you tell we will be the same power the same anointing the same person that he was in 2025 2026 2027 until these bodies are changed why because it ain't us church it's God's question it's God's answer and you got it tonight God is once again in alive he's alive in men and women boys and girls he's alive in even light Tabernacle there's your question there's your answer Satan he's here among us tonight and not only evenight Tabernacle but he's there he's around the world he's with brother Timothy tonight
