[53:18] that he will do it today I before I read
[53:21] the scripture I just received this from
[53:25] brother Ron Spencer yesterday he shared
[53:27] this quote with me and brother Donnie
[53:29] Reagan and it explains why we do what we
[53:35] do and he brother brandham said this so
[53:38] what are you worrying about brother
[53:41] brandom why did you preach so hard when
[53:44] you're going to this oh I can't go home
[53:47] satisfied I I must mustn't go by myself
[53:52] these hands will be only mortal once and
[53:57] these lips will only be mortal once and
[54:02] you my brother and sister will only be
[54:06] mortal once and while the spirit inside
[54:10] of me though through tired flesh and
[54:14] weary hours cries to you it is only for
[54:18] one
[54:19] thing and that is to bring you into this
[54:22] Fellowship here not to bring you into
[54:25] the church but to bring you into Christ
[54:30] that in there you have a hope steadfast
[54:33] andure is anchored by an oath of God he
[54:38] confirmed it and run the Forerunner
[54:41] Yonder showing who he was and raised him
[54:43] up on the last on that that day there
[54:46] the resurrection and it proved that we
[54:49] who are in him will come forth in the
[54:51] resurrection and every man that comes
[54:56] through this Veil now justified in the
[54:59] sight of God God looks down and says I
[55:04] have glorified him already and set him
[55:07] Yonder in
[55:10] heaven amen God looks down and says I
[55:14] have glorified him already and set him
[55:17] Yonder in heaven that's what we want
[55:19] today is be in our position in Christ
[55:23] Jesus amen if we can get position there
[55:25] every devil is beneath our feet we're
[55:29] more than conquerors there amen Exodus
[55:32] 12: 21 thank you for all the wonderful
[55:36] music to today and the worship to the
[55:39] Lord and I know he was pleased and he
[55:42] draws near when we worship him he'll
[55:46] come and dwell in the Praises of his
[55:48] people Exodus 12 and verse 21 then Moses
[55:53] called for all the the Elders of Israel
[55:56] and said unto them draw out and take you
[55:58] a lamb according to your families and
[56:00] kill the
[56:01] Passover and you shall take a bunch of
[56:05] of hisp and and dip it in the blood that
[56:09] is in the Basin and strike the lentil
[56:12] and the two side post with the blood
[56:15] that is in the Basin and none of you
[56:17] shall go out of the door of his house
[56:21] until morning for the Lord will pass
[56:24] through to Smite the Egyptians and when
[56:27] he seeth the blood of on the lentil and
[56:30] on the two side posts the Lord will pass
[56:33] over the door and will not suffer the
[56:36] Destroyer to come into your houses to
[56:40] Smite you God bless you can be seated
[56:49] amen today I want to speak to you on the
[56:52] token applied and display amen last
[56:56] Sunday we was talking about the token on
[56:58] display and I want to cover that thought
[57:02] and subject a little more than what we
[57:05] what we carried it on Sunday you know
[57:08] there's just so much that it's it's such
[57:11] a vital important subject because
[57:14] without the token you can't go in the
[57:17] Rapture you may be saved from
[57:20] tribulation but you won't go to the
[57:23] Rapture and um as like brother brandom
[57:26] said in this quote that we just read you
[57:28] know is is that we don't want to go by
[57:32] ourselves you know and these hands will
[57:35] only be mortal once these lips will be
[57:38] mortal but once you will only be mortal
[57:41] but once so this is our only
[57:44] opportunity and so so he said through
[57:47] the tired flesh and weary hours and
[57:51] cries to you it's for one thing and that
[57:54] is to give give you to bring you into
[57:56] Christ that in there you are have a hope
[58:00] that is steadfast ured and anchored by
[58:03] the oath of God Amen to justify you in
[58:06] your in his sight and to place you into
[58:10] your position in Christ now you know
[58:14] then we have read from the book of
[58:16] Exodus and we also know we are in an
[58:19] exodus and brother randam would preach
[58:21] this sermon call it the highlight of his
[58:23] entire Ministry
[58:25] he would um he would tell us that of all
[58:28] of the sermons that had been leading up
[58:30] except for the opening of the seals that
[58:33] this was the the the Capstone to caping
[58:36] off of so many sermons and that is that
[58:39] you must have the token it is so of
[58:43] vital
[58:44] importance and and how how wonderful it
[58:48] is that we have this vital truth in this
[58:51] day and remembering this that the token
[58:54] could only be applied in the evening
[58:57] time so you know it was a closing out of
[59:00] time in the the time also of the the
[59:04] early um dispensation where the Jewish
[59:07] dispensation was was um being uh was
[59:12] being uh uh ceased and and going out and
[59:17] in that time God gave a token even even
[59:21] on the day of Pentecost we're talking
[59:23] about because as you know death was
[59:26] coming to Israel and to that whole form
[59:29] of religion and they would all die
[59:32] except God would have given a token and
[59:36] of course that token would be the
[59:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost now of go of
[59:41] course now we are in a day and hour
[59:44] where we are also now in another evening
[59:46] time and this is also where another
[59:49] generation is dying death has been
[59:52] pronounced over the last age and we see
[59:56] Poise to ride is the death is a rider
[1:00:00] Called Death as it will F fully changed
[1:00:04] to the pale horse rider as the bride
[1:00:07] leaves and so we're we're in that
[1:00:09] transition of time and it's a very very
[1:00:13] serious hour one of the most greatest
[1:00:17] hours there's ever been and and I I want
[1:00:20] you to remember as brother Brandon
[1:00:22] brings this message the token he tells
[1:00:24] say it it has to be applied in the
[1:00:28] evening time the evening time message he
[1:00:31] says is to apply the token so we have
[1:00:35] come to another evening time and now a
[1:00:39] closing out of the Gentile
[1:00:41] dispensation now the Passover began and
[1:00:44] it would be followed by a feast of seven
[1:00:48] days of unleavened bread and this the
[1:00:51] Feast of unleavened bread began with a
[1:00:53] holy day and it end with a holy day
[1:00:57] signifying the alpha is the Omega and
[1:01:00] that the last day will be like the first
[1:01:04] and the Feast of unleavened bread
[1:01:06] signifies a time of sincerity and truth
[1:01:10] and I I think this is very appropriate
[1:01:12] with us taking communion today you know
[1:01:16] again because we we want to come to
[1:01:19] Christ Our Passover with sincerity and
[1:01:22] truth and these and it and he goes on
[1:01:26] and we know that for seven full days no
[1:01:30] leav products remain in the home the an
[1:01:34] unleavened bread is eaten and God's
[1:01:38] churches had to do this now for 2,000
[1:01:43] years or seven Church ages and we are
[1:01:46] here you know at the very end of those
[1:01:50] of the Feast of unleavened bread as it
[1:01:52] were and um you know this symbolizes
[1:01:56] removing Sin from our lives and dining
[1:02:01] on Christ unadulterated truth which is
[1:02:05] the Passover now the instructions are to
[1:02:09] take a lamb without blemish and to keep
[1:02:13] it up H for for five days and and then
[1:02:17] it while you examine that lamb and and
[1:02:20] of course we we know this has been a
[1:02:23] part of other ages and in the reformers
[1:02:27] where they come to realize that it was
[1:02:29] Christ and his blood that was important
[1:02:33] and that we are justified by faith and
[1:02:37] so you know we had the keeping of the
[1:02:40] lamb and examining the lamb and many
[1:02:43] denominations are really good at this
[1:02:46] they they talk about the worthy lamb and
[1:02:49] how Christ is is our our true lamb and
[1:02:52] he was without blemish and his blood
[1:02:55] atones and and everything else about
[1:02:59] that but we are now in another day and
[1:03:02] another hour and that hour is not just
[1:03:06] about Calvary and what God did 2,000
[1:03:09] years ago but right now that the the
[1:03:12] token or the blood or the Life of Christ
[1:03:16] must be on display now we noticed in the
[1:03:21] verse 22 of what we just read that he
[1:03:24] said and ye shall take a bunch of heup
[1:03:28] or hup and and dip it in the blood that
[1:03:31] is in the Basin so here is careful
[1:03:34] instructions you're going to apply it
[1:03:37] with his now the token must be applied
[1:03:41] by hisp because you see hisp is a type
[1:03:45] of Faith so we we want to understand and
[1:03:49] realize the importance of faith in the
[1:03:54] whole
[1:03:55] process but I I want you to notice it is
[1:03:58] not just taking hisp and holding hsip in
[1:04:01] your hand neither is it just striking it
[1:04:04] with hup it must be dipped in the blood
[1:04:08] and the blood
[1:04:10] applied so it is not just faith alone
[1:04:14] but it also is it must have the blood
[1:04:18] applied and on display so without it all
[1:04:22] the believing isn't vain his up without
[1:04:26] the blood is not going to save you all
[1:04:30] right so notice it must be applied by
[1:04:32] his his is a type of Faith you must
[1:04:37] believe you see faith has it a vital
[1:04:40] part it he that comes to God Must
[1:04:42] Believe Hebrews uh 116 for without faith
[1:04:46] it is impossible to please him for he
[1:04:50] that cometh to God must believe so
[1:04:53] notice is the first thing coming to God
[1:04:55] you must
[1:05:00] believe unless that you have hisp you
[1:05:03] cannot apply the
[1:05:05] blood you've got to have faith it is
[1:05:08] applied with faith it's very vital and
[1:05:11] important but that's not all of it and
[1:05:14] here's here lays the problem today is a
[1:05:17] a lot of people are waving their hiss up
[1:05:19] and saiding I've had faith in the Lord
[1:05:22] but have never dipped into the Life of
[1:05:26] Christ and applied
[1:05:29] it so they have a profession of Faith
[1:05:32] holding their hsip up but hiss up
[1:05:35] without the blood is not going to save
[1:05:39] you now so he said he must believe that
[1:05:43] he is that's Hebrews 11:6 put that up
[1:05:46] and but fa without faith it's impossible
[1:05:48] to please him he that cometh to God must
[1:05:50] believe that he
[1:05:53] is not that he was not that he will be
[1:05:58] you're going to if you're going to get
[1:05:59] salvation you're going to have to have a
[1:06:01] present tense God you're going to have
[1:06:03] to bring him out of History to present
[1:06:05] tense if you're going to have healing in
[1:06:08] your body you got to do the same thing
[1:06:10] that's your salvation on your on your
[1:06:12] body realm to do that you have to
[1:06:14] believe that he is not that he was or
[1:06:18] will be but he is a present tense God
[1:06:22] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:06:25] diligently seek him so I know this
[1:06:27] already if I will seek Him
[1:06:29] diligently he's going to reward
[1:06:32] me if but the day I seek him with my
[1:06:35] whole
[1:06:37] heart that's the day I'll find
[1:06:40] him now that's the problem many times is
[1:06:44] is because people give up they pray a
[1:06:46] few minutes even brother brandham
[1:06:48] complained about that said people come
[1:06:50] down to altar pray 5 minutes and give up
[1:06:53] he said pressy
[1:06:54] persevere we heard it Wednesday night on
[1:06:57] you know the importance of perseverance
[1:07:00] you see again you must because God is a
[1:07:03] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:07:05] him God wants to give you the Holy
[1:07:09] Ghost he doesn't want to withhold it
[1:07:12] from nobody he wants everybody to get it
[1:07:16] it is the heart of God to save
[1:07:19] man God so loved the
[1:07:22] world come on
[1:07:24] amen it's his heart it's his
[1:07:28] desire amen if you can even just get
[1:07:31] this on the Physical Realm you'll just
[1:07:33] realize this morning God wants to heal
[1:07:36] you well God don't want to heal me
[1:07:38] brother Tim no God wants to heal you God
[1:07:41] wants to save you God wants to bless you
[1:07:45] God wants to prosper
[1:07:48] you and he will reward those that
[1:07:50] diligently seek him so so now John 3:16
[1:07:55] everybody knows this scripture for God
[1:07:58] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:08:01] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:08:04] him should not perish but have
[1:08:06] everlasting life for God sent not his
[1:08:10] world his son into the world to condemn
[1:08:12] the world but that the world through him
[1:08:14] might be saved so notice even God's
[1:08:17] purpose his purpose wasn't to
[1:08:20] condemn but to
[1:08:22] save this is the heart of God he's not
[1:08:26] wanting anybody to be lost you have to
[1:08:29] fight your way to
[1:08:31] Hell remember you remember if you take
[1:08:34] the mark of the beast it is because you
[1:08:36] rejected the Seal of God it's
[1:08:40] offered it's
[1:08:41] available and God wants you to have it
[1:08:44] he even he even Likens it to a father
[1:08:47] and a son and the son saying I'm hungry
[1:08:50] and he said well you know if you ask him
[1:08:52] for an egg would you give him a serpent
[1:08:55] if you g asked for bread you know would
[1:08:57] you give him something something bad a
[1:08:59] scorpion what if you offered you know
[1:09:02] would God do that or would your father
[1:09:04] do that he said no well he said how much
[1:09:06] more will the heavenly father give the
[1:09:09] Holy Ghost to them that ask
[1:09:13] him amen so it is not God holding
[1:09:17] anything back from
[1:09:19] you well God just won't give it to me
[1:09:22] you know you you see
[1:09:24] again that's not the issue he cannot
[1:09:26] give it to you as long as sin nature is
[1:09:29] still living in you there's got to be a
[1:09:31] death to the old man so you know based
[1:09:35] you know based on this uh you know as we
[1:09:39] look at this look Verse 18 He that
[1:09:42] believeth on him is not condemned that
[1:09:45] he believeth not is condemned already
[1:09:47] because he had not believed in the name
[1:09:50] of the only begotten Son of God so it
[1:09:53] there's a requirement of faith we must
[1:09:56] believe that's right now but you know to
[1:10:00] today many are encouraged to pray this
[1:10:03] simple prayer you know Lord Jesus I
[1:10:06] accept you as my Lord and Savior forgive
[1:10:08] me of my
[1:10:10] sins in jesus' name amen and then they
[1:10:14] then they say well we believe when you
[1:10:15] prayed this prayer you got born again
[1:10:18] well we don't that's
[1:10:22] right we don't
[1:10:25] am you see the Bible doesn't teach that
[1:10:28] and neither does the reveal truth of the
[1:10:31] message now listen Church there is a a
[1:10:34] lot a lot of misunderstanding about
[1:10:37] being born again and Satan did
[1:10:39] everything he could to to to confuse it
[1:10:43] to Cloud it so you know to to them early
[1:10:47] on you know before the Reformation even
[1:10:50] the Catholics proclaimed if you were
[1:10:53] born in to the church and you were
[1:10:54] baptized as an infant and born into a
[1:10:57] Catholic Family you were automatically
[1:11:00] born
[1:11:03] again so you see the whole thing got
[1:11:05] convoluted and Confused then Luther come
[1:11:08] along and he said well but the just
[1:11:11] shall live by faith so now born again
[1:11:13] takes on a new
[1:11:15] meaning that if we have faith in Jesus
[1:11:18] Christ well now we're born again then
[1:11:20] the Wesley comes along and he comes
[1:11:22] along and says
[1:11:24] but you got to be Sanctified you can't
[1:11:26] be born again and living this kind of
[1:11:27] life you you got to be born again you
[1:11:29] believed on the Lord but come on get
[1:11:31] Sanctified so to others it means
[1:11:33] Sanctified and and and and others it
[1:11:36] means speaking in
[1:11:38] tongues but listen brother bradam said
[1:11:41] in the message why we had to be Shepherd
[1:11:43] I know the terminologies of what born
[1:11:45] again is but let's what what happened in
[1:11:48] the Bible when they were born again
[1:11:50] Peter was a Believer the apostles were
[1:11:53] believer
[1:11:54] but they wasn't born again until after
[1:11:57] the Holy Ghost fell on them at
[1:12:02] Pentecost so let's just get a clear
[1:12:05] understanding that the the Bible teaches
[1:12:08] that the Holy Ghost has to come after
[1:12:13] believing amen after believing let's go
[1:12:16] to Romans 109 and we'll read this
[1:12:20] scripture that if Thou shalt confess
[1:12:22] with thy m M the Lord Jesus and Shall
[1:12:26] Believe in thy heart that God has raised
[1:12:29] him from the dead Thou shalt be saved
[1:12:31] now this this is a very fundamental
[1:12:34] starting of the faith that I was talking
[1:12:37] about and if you believe from the heart
[1:12:41] confess with thy mouth and believe in
[1:12:44] thy heart that God raised him from the
[1:12:47] dead you are going to be
[1:12:50] saved for with the heart the man believe
[1:12:53] believeth unto righteousness and with
[1:12:55] the mouth confession is made un
[1:12:57] salvation for the scripture said who
[1:13:00] believe whosoever believeth on him shall
[1:13:02] not be ashamed or
[1:13:06] disappointed now so so again it is very
[1:13:10] very important that confession I Lord
[1:13:13] I'm going to accept you as my savior
[1:13:15] forgive me of my sin and this is a very
[1:13:19] start it's the turning around you know
[1:13:22] you're you're headed this way and you're
[1:13:24] going toward toward the hell as it was
[1:13:27] and and repentance is turning around and
[1:13:29] going back this way going toward Heaven
[1:13:33] you've got to turn your back to sin and
[1:13:36] to
[1:13:38] unbelief amen you you've got to accept
[1:13:40] him and say Lord I need salvation I I'm
[1:13:44] a sinner I'm lost and I need a
[1:13:48] savior nobody can be saved until they
[1:13:51] first realize I'm lost I need God now
[1:13:55] Romans 4:3 for what said the scripture
[1:13:58] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[1:14:01] him for
[1:14:03] righteousness so notice Abraham believed
[1:14:06] God and his faith here was counted him
[1:14:09] as righteousness but after believing
[1:14:13] Abraham received the Seal of
[1:14:16] circumcision so what we are saying this
[1:14:19] after you believe after your repentance
[1:14:22] after your full surrenderance to God
[1:14:24] then God will give you the experience of
[1:14:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now he
[1:14:31] gave Abraham the Seal of circumcision as
[1:14:34] a witness it was a sign of the Covenant
[1:14:38] so like the token we're talking about
[1:14:40] sign of the Covenant and and so in fact
[1:14:44] he calls it a covenant this shall be the
[1:14:47] the or he calls it a token this shall be
[1:14:49] the token of the Covenant and there that
[1:14:51] is the cutting off of the
[1:14:54] flesh now so that is that is why Paul in
[1:14:58] Acts 19 said to those Baptist Brethren
[1:15:01] who had Apollos as their pastor and
[1:15:04] Believe In The Gospel as John had
[1:15:06] preached said John the Baptist said have
[1:15:09] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:15:11] believed you see they had believed they
[1:15:14] were they were not yet
[1:15:17] converted and for many
[1:15:20] Christians I want you to be careful here
[1:15:22] listen real close for many
[1:15:26] Christians Pentecost is an unneeded it's
[1:15:30] like an unneeded
[1:15:32] event seemingly a wasted effort it's it
[1:15:36] don't mean
[1:15:40] anything why receive the Holy Ghost
[1:15:42] since all you have to do is believe on
[1:15:44] Christ as a savior and confess in your
[1:15:45] mouth that he raised from the
[1:15:48] dead so for many
[1:15:51] Pentecost is is not even
[1:15:54] needed just believing on the Lord is all
[1:15:57] this
[1:15:58] necessary the experience of Pentecost is
[1:16:03] unmar a wasted
[1:16:05] effort now I want to just I want to lay
[1:16:09] some things down here for you because
[1:16:11] without
[1:16:12] Pentecost you cannot have the Holy
[1:16:17] Ghost you might have believed on the
[1:16:19] Lord but without
[1:16:21] Pentecost and and I'm talking got the
[1:16:23] experience of Pentecost the coming of
[1:16:26] the Holy Ghost you cannot go in the
[1:16:30] Rapture nobody will go in the Rapture
[1:16:32] without
[1:16:36] Pentecost
[1:16:38] now let's just look at this real
[1:16:40] carefully because even though Jesus died
[1:16:43] and rose again and Calvary was thorough
[1:16:47] and complete you still could not be born
[1:16:50] again until
[1:16:52] Pentecost
[1:16:53] that's right Jesus has shed his
[1:16:57] blood amen amen the lamb had been
[1:17:00] slain but until Pentecost you could not
[1:17:04] be born
[1:17:06] again nobody nobody could be born again
[1:17:11] until
[1:17:12] Pentecost and nobody today can be born
[1:17:16] again without
[1:17:18] Pentecost anyone without the Pentecostal
[1:17:21] Spirit experience
[1:17:23] that follows repentance and profession
[1:17:26] of faith is still
[1:17:30] unconverted even though you might have
[1:17:33] performed the correct right of baptism
[1:17:36] and use the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:38] Christ and went through all the works
[1:17:41] with without Pentecost you were not
[1:17:46] converted now remember the lamb let's go
[1:17:48] back for a moment let's think about the
[1:17:50] lamb in the Old Testament
[1:17:53] the worshipper sin would be transferred
[1:17:57] from the worshipper to the lamb and the
[1:18:00] lamb died in his
[1:18:02] place right now so the Old Testament I I
[1:18:08] I want to get this clear the old
[1:18:10] Covenant that's what a testament is
[1:18:12] Covenant the old
[1:18:14] Covenant had forgiveness of sins without
[1:18:20] Calvary that's right
[1:18:24] by the blood of an innocent
[1:18:27] lamb God accepted the substitutionary
[1:18:30] death of a lamb in the place of the
[1:18:34] death of the worshipper who deserved to
[1:18:36] die because of his
[1:18:38] sins now so the Old Testament had
[1:18:41] forgiveness of sin now here's what the
[1:18:44] old Covenant brought I I want to just
[1:18:46] cover it for a minute Leviticus 1711
[1:18:49] watch this for the life of the flesh is
[1:18:52] in the blood Leviticus 17:11 and I have
[1:18:55] given it for you on the altar to make an
[1:18:58] atonement for your souls for it is a
[1:19:00] blood that makes atonement by the
[1:19:04] life so if you see right here that the
[1:19:07] the Life is In the Flesh of the blood
[1:19:09] I've given it to you upon the altar to
[1:19:12] make an atonement for your souls for it
[1:19:15] is the blood that makes an
[1:19:17] atonement so they had an
[1:19:20] atonement even in the old Testament or
[1:19:24] the old
[1:19:26] Covenant but now let's see what it would
[1:19:28] do let's go to Leviticus 16 and3 for on
[1:19:32] that day shall the priest make an
[1:19:34] atonement for you to cleanse you that
[1:19:37] you may be clean from all your sins
[1:19:40] before the Lord look how wonderful this
[1:19:43] is forgiveness of
[1:19:46] sins an atonement for
[1:19:49] sin under the old
[1:19:51] Covenant Psalms 51 and7 said Purge me
[1:19:55] with hisp and I shall be clean wash me
[1:19:59] and I shall be whiter than
[1:20:02] snow so you see by the transferring of
[1:20:05] the sin from the worshiper on the lamb
[1:20:08] and the lamb ding in your place you were
[1:20:10] whiter than
[1:20:11] snow you were clean you were
[1:20:16] purged are you with me amen you were
[1:20:19] clean from all your sins this is what
[1:20:21] the Bible said and look not only that
[1:20:24] but Haba habaka 2 and4 says the just or
[1:20:28] the righteous shall live by faith oh
[1:20:32] they were living by faith in the Old
[1:20:36] Testament and they were declared
[1:20:38] righteous Abraham was Abraham believed
[1:20:41] the Lord and he counted to him as
[1:20:44] righteousness so there was faith in the
[1:20:47] Old
[1:20:48] Testament Faith under the old Covenant
[1:20:51] and the just the righteous live by faith
[1:20:54] and they were declared righteous because
[1:20:56] of their faith because they believed
[1:20:59] that when they laid their hands on the
[1:21:01] lamb and took his life that the God had
[1:21:05] received their sacrifice and now they
[1:21:08] were blameless before
[1:21:12] him so this is all old
[1:21:15] Covenant let's go to Isaiah 1:18 and he
[1:21:19] says come now and let us reason together
[1:21:22] s the Lord though your sins be
[1:21:26] Scarlet they shall be white as snow
[1:21:29] though they be red like Crimson they
[1:21:31] shall be like
[1:21:33] wool I you know this is offered under
[1:21:36] the old
[1:21:39] Covenant how thorough was it brother Tim
[1:21:41] all right Psalms 103:12 as far as the
[1:21:45] East is from the West so he removed our
[1:21:49] transgressions from us hallelujah
[1:21:54] this is what the blood of the Old
[1:21:57] Testament lamb would do for
[1:22:00] you without Jesus going to
[1:22:03] Calvary without him dying in your place
[1:22:07] the lamb you would bring a lamb without
[1:22:10] blemish and your sins would be forgiven
[1:22:13] you would be justified by faith you
[1:22:16] would be declared
[1:22:18] righteous that's what Justified means
[1:22:21] declared righteous
[1:22:23] let's look how th thoroughly this is
[1:22:25] Isaiah
[1:22:27] 44:22 I have blotted out as a thick
[1:22:29] Cloud thy
[1:22:32] transgressions and as a cloud thy sins
[1:22:36] return unto me for I have redeemed thee
[1:22:39] so he blotted out as a thick Cloud thy
[1:22:43] transgressions though your sins were
[1:22:46] many Micah 7:18 who is a god like unto
[1:22:52] thee that paronthi look there's a pardon
[1:22:55] from iniquity in the old Covenant and
[1:22:59] passes by the transgression of the
[1:23:02] remnant of his Heritage he retaineth not
[1:23:05] his anger forever because he delighteth
[1:23:07] in Mercy ain't that wonderful to know
[1:23:10] this God a God who Delights in Mercy and
[1:23:13] and there again that paronthi
[1:23:19] what about his memory what what what
[1:23:21] about that Isaiah
[1:23:24] 43:25 I yes I am he who blots out your
[1:23:28] transgressions for my own sake and
[1:23:30] remembers your sins no
[1:23:36] more this is so wonderful
[1:23:39] church this is this is what you receive
[1:23:42] by Believing on the Lord and accepting
[1:23:46] Christ as your savior pardon for
[1:23:48] everything you ever
[1:23:51] did though it was was like a thick
[1:23:53] Cloud God said I don't even remember it
[1:23:57] anymore amen you know some people just
[1:24:00] need a good revelation of
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:04] justification amen that by faith you
[1:24:07] know God has forgiven you of every sin
[1:24:12] every evil thought and though it was
[1:24:14] like a cloud and though though it's been
[1:24:16] a cloud following you all your life
[1:24:18] you're forgiven and he doesn't remember
[1:24:21] it so
[1:24:23] his history is
[1:24:26] finished but I want to tell you
[1:24:28] again before Calvary before the cross
[1:24:33] through the
[1:24:34] substitutionary death of the animal lamb
[1:24:38] the righteous the just live by faith
[1:24:42] Abraham was declared righteous because
[1:24:45] of his faith by Believing on the Lord it
[1:24:47] was imputed to him as righteousness
[1:24:49] through forgiveness of sin before the
[1:24:52] cross
[1:24:55] cross catch this before the cross before
[1:24:59] Jesus
[1:25:01] atonement they had mercies of
[1:25:07] healing
[1:25:08] hello don't hang up on me catch the
[1:25:12] significance of this God was Jehovah
[1:25:15] Rafa God performed Miracles under Moses
[1:25:19] under the blood of sheep and goats
[1:25:24] God performed spoken
[1:25:27] word created
[1:25:30] flies amen chains of dust into
[1:25:33] lice all all the great things that he
[1:25:36] did miraculous under the blood of bulls
[1:25:40] and goats you know brother Tim why is
[1:25:43] this even significant because brother
[1:25:44] brandom tells us over and again if you
[1:25:47] realize if that can be done under the
[1:25:50] blood of sheep and goats then what about
[1:25:53] the greater
[1:25:55] blood the blood of Jesus Christ if that
[1:25:59] could position you as sinless before
[1:26:03] God then what about the blood of Jesus
[1:26:07] which is a greater
[1:26:12] blood
[1:26:21] amen
[1:26:27] you brought a wonderful grandson to
[1:26:29] church this
[1:26:31] morning God bless you brother voice
[1:26:34] you're here this morning so glad to see
[1:26:42] you can you stand up with your little
[1:26:46] grandson brother
[1:26:49] Wiggins look at there how old is he
[1:26:53] 8 years
[1:26:56] old I had I I was a raiser of prized
[1:27:01] animals I had registered black
[1:27:05] angles I had registered Nubian goats
[1:27:07] they want a lot of
[1:27:12] trophies you love that
[1:27:17] grandson how many goats would you take
[1:27:20] for him
[1:27:25] I had registered Black Angus Top Line
[1:27:29] how many would you take for
[1:27:35] him you wouldn't swap him for all that
[1:27:38] you are you telling me that my beautiful
[1:27:42] wonderful registered animals would not
[1:27:45] equal the blood of your cown
[1:27:50] son well I tell you what
[1:27:53] all right mine were valuable animals but
[1:27:55] let's say I took every sheep
[1:27:58] goat
[1:28:00] calf ever cleaned animal offering and I
[1:28:05] would offer it for that
[1:28:07] one would you take
[1:28:11] it
[1:28:15] no you see all of the blood of every
[1:28:20] innocent animal no matter its value or
[1:28:23] its worth did cannot equal the value of
[1:28:27] that one
[1:28:31] boy but there's another
[1:28:33] blood that is a greater blood and it not
[1:28:37] only equals the value of that but every
[1:28:40] human being all the way from Adam all
[1:28:44] the way to the last one born his blood
[1:28:48] is of such
[1:28:50] worth that it a turn for
[1:28:55] everybody are you with me now that is
[1:28:57] the value of the blood of Jesus it's
[1:29:00] greater than all of the wealth of the
[1:29:03] whole
[1:29:04] world one soul brother brandom said is
[1:29:07] worth 10,000
[1:29:10] [Applause]
[1:29:12] worlds but his blood was not the blood
[1:29:16] of another
[1:29:17] man but it was the blood of
[1:29:20] God that's
[1:29:23] right
[1:29:25] now that's why this blood is so
[1:29:30] great it's so
[1:29:33] important yet before it was
[1:29:36] shed they had mercies of
[1:29:38] healing Miracles were performed before
[1:29:42] the
[1:29:43] cross the disciples received power to
[1:29:46] cast out Devils heal the sick do
[1:29:49] Miracles you see Miracles can be
[1:29:51] performed formed and a person not be be
[1:29:54] spirit filled not even born
[1:29:57] again the the Old Testament worshipper
[1:30:00] was not born
[1:30:02] again his sins were
[1:30:05] transferred unto the innocent lamb his
[1:30:08] sins was gone but he was not a new
[1:30:13] creature he was the same old sinner yeah
[1:30:17] now was he saved yes he was saved he was
[1:30:21] saved from sins forgiven yes but not
[1:30:24] born
[1:30:27] again yeah they had the spirit as an
[1:30:29] anointing that came and went it would
[1:30:31] not even dwell in them do you realize
[1:30:35] that it was not possible for somebody to
[1:30:38] be truly Spirit-filled as we experience
[1:30:40] it today before the coming of the Holy
[1:30:44] Ghost it was not possible before Calvary
[1:30:48] the blood of the innocent lamb of the
[1:30:50] Old Testament could not could not even
[1:30:54] though it would take away sin in the
[1:30:56] senses from removing it from the East is
[1:30:58] from the West all these scriptures that
[1:31:00] we went through yet the the life of that
[1:31:03] lamb could not come back and his
[1:31:06] innocency could not come back upon the
[1:31:10] worshipper so guess what happened when
[1:31:12] he got his sins
[1:31:14] forgiven he walked out there the same
[1:31:17] old sinner he was when he came
[1:31:20] inen right his same
[1:31:24] desires were
[1:31:26] there if he you know if he had murd
[1:31:29] desires sexual desires if he had the
[1:31:32] evil you know thievery desires whatever
[1:31:36] he went away with the same
[1:31:38] desires his life was not changed other
[1:31:42] than his past
[1:31:44] forgiven now that's where a lot of
[1:31:47] people will stand you know even at the
[1:31:49] Judgment that they received him as sick
[1:31:51] savior but didn't go on to receive his
[1:31:56] life now so you know but you know as I
[1:32:00] say in the Old Testament they had the
[1:32:03] spirit as an anointing and that Spirit
[1:32:05] would come and go it would come and go
[1:32:09] and that's way what it is with a lot of
[1:32:10] people they get the Holy Spirit on them
[1:32:12] and they'll shout and up and down the
[1:32:14] aisle and they go out and live a
[1:32:15] different life an evil
[1:32:18] life was that the real Holy Spirit could
[1:32:21] have been
[1:32:26] they could have they could brother
[1:32:27] brandham said you could speak in real
[1:32:29] genuine tongues and still be a
[1:32:33] devil moved on by the Holy Ghost you
[1:32:36] seen it I've seen it people moved and
[1:32:40] and and anointed and shout and
[1:32:43] everything else now but even on the in
[1:32:47] the Old Testament this is this is the
[1:32:49] way it was they had they had the spirit
[1:32:52] as an anointing that came and went but
[1:32:54] it couldn't dwell in
[1:32:57] them listen why is that because there
[1:33:00] was nothing under the old Covenant that
[1:33:03] could deal with sin
[1:33:06] nature and God's not going to live with
[1:33:09] there being two on your throne him and
[1:33:12] the devil cuz you were born with the
[1:33:15] devil right with the serpent nature
[1:33:19] inside of you that that's how you were
[1:33:22] born that's why I don't care how good
[1:33:24] you are as a messy kid how well you've
[1:33:26] been trained you know how how you've
[1:33:29] never done this I've never smoked in my
[1:33:31] life well I had either I never drank in
[1:33:33] my life well I haven't either but you
[1:33:35] know but you still need
[1:33:38] salvation you must be born
[1:33:41] again it doesn't matter you've been a
[1:33:44] you've been a better member of the
[1:33:46] church than the devil well I I doubt
[1:33:48] that he attends more than you do he in
[1:33:51] every
[1:33:55] service but let me just
[1:33:58] say in the old Covenant the Holy Spirit
[1:34:01] could not dwell in them now I I know
[1:34:03] some protest and let's just go through
[1:34:05] it so we don't leave any Stones
[1:34:08] unturn because we know John the Baptist
[1:34:11] it says he had this Holy Spirit from his
[1:34:13] mother's womb Luke 1:15 let's look at
[1:34:16] the scripture for he shall be great in
[1:34:18] the sight of the Lord and shall be
[1:34:20] neither drink neither wine nor strong
[1:34:23] drink but he shall be filled with the
[1:34:24] Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb
[1:34:28] let's go down to verse 41 and it came to
[1:34:30] pass that when Elizabeth heard the
[1:34:32] salutation of Mary the baby leaped in
[1:34:35] her womb and Elizabeth was filled with
[1:34:37] the Holy Ghost let's look down at verse
[1:34:39] 67 and his father Zacharias was filled
[1:34:42] with the Holy Ghost and
[1:34:45] prophesied now this was the anointing
[1:34:48] that it came down and they were filled
[1:34:50] in the sense of that they would filled
[1:34:52] in the sense to word they prophesied
[1:34:54] they
[1:34:55] rejoiced they but the Holy Spirit could
[1:34:59] not come and indwell man until the
[1:35:03] Supreme sacrifice Jesus Christ had given
[1:35:06] his
[1:35:07] life so so let's just look at this
[1:35:10] because the Holy Ghost cannot indwell an
[1:35:13] individual as long as sin nature is
[1:35:16] still there and the innocent life of the
[1:35:20] animal sacrificed could not come back on
[1:35:23] the
[1:35:24] worshipper so look let's go to John
[1:35:27] 7:37 let's just see this because
[1:35:30] scripture doesn't fight scripture we got
[1:35:32] to just lay it down right you know where
[1:35:34] you where you see it clearly in the last
[1:35:36] day that last great day of the feast
[1:35:39] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[1:35:42] thirst let him come to me and drink and
[1:35:45] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:35:47] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:35:50] rivers of Living Waters here's the
[1:35:53] evidence of the of the Holy Ghost living
[1:35:56] out of you it's a life dressing up out
[1:35:58] of you but this he spake of the spirit
[1:36:03] which they that believe on him should
[1:36:05] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:36:09] given because Jesus was not yet
[1:36:13] glorified so because that Jesus was not
[1:36:17] yet glorified and ascended into heaven
[1:36:19] and sent it back nobody could receive
[1:36:21] the spirit until the day of Pentecost
[1:36:25] now they could be anointed and they
[1:36:27] could they they could be like Moses
[1:36:30] anointed by the spirit of God and come
[1:36:33] right down and the spirit would come and
[1:36:35] it would go it would come and it would
[1:36:38] go it would depart from
[1:36:40] him it would leave him guess what he'd
[1:36:44] do when he it'd leave him he lose his
[1:36:46] temper and smite The Rock instead of
[1:36:48] speak to it glorify himself and be kept
[1:36:51] out the promised land guess what
[1:36:53] happened with
[1:36:55] Elijah he gets so
[1:36:58] anointed and the spirit comes upon him
[1:37:00] he walks right down there man he brings
[1:37:03] a showdown between Baal and and and and
[1:37:07] Jehovah and and let the god that answers
[1:37:10] by fire let him be God he turns the
[1:37:13] hearts of the children of Israel back to
[1:37:15] God again then what does he
[1:37:19] do he runs out of and to the Wilderness
[1:37:22] after killing 400 prophets and Jezebel
[1:37:25] says well I'll tell you what I'll hunt
[1:37:27] him down I'll kill him for what he's
[1:37:29] done and he goes
[1:37:32] running the spirit has left
[1:37:35] him he gets over there somewhere God
[1:37:38] didn't even tell him to go up to a cave
[1:37:41] somewhere and God said what are you
[1:37:44] doing here Elijah I didn't tell you to
[1:37:46] come here what are you doing
[1:37:50] here
[1:37:52] well you know but you see I'm running
[1:37:55] from my life because why Jezebel said
[1:37:58] she's going to kill me and I'm the only
[1:38:01] one and God said no I got 7,000 that has
[1:38:05] not bowed their knees to bail you know I
[1:38:07] I you're not the only one but
[1:38:09] nevertheless you're tired you're weary
[1:38:11] I'm going to take you home now go and
[1:38:13] anoint Elisha in your place and then he
[1:38:16] gives him some other instructions for
[1:38:18] his leaving but what I'm trying to tell
[1:38:20] you is the men would be so moved by the
[1:38:23] Holy
[1:38:25] Ghost but then it lifts and they go out
[1:38:28] and do things God didn't tell him to
[1:38:32] do
[1:38:34] now let's come back to the New Testament
[1:38:36] for a moment I want to establish
[1:38:38] something about Jesus
[1:38:41] Jesus was the first of a new
[1:38:47] race right his whole purpose was that he
[1:38:51] would have more Sons just like
[1:38:57] him
[1:38:59] now he would be born of a new race he
[1:39:03] would be born of the of the spoken word
[1:39:06] so he would be of the new creation he
[1:39:10] was not born by sexual birth but of the
[1:39:13] spoken word so we can say first of all
[1:39:16] he is the head of the
[1:39:19] race everything has to come from him
[1:39:22] he's the firstborn of every
[1:39:27] creature amen now so let's go to John 1
[1:39:31] 129 and let's see about this
[1:39:34] firstborn and let's see what happens to
[1:39:37] him now here he is he is born and he's a
[1:39:42] comes about 30 years old and here he
[1:39:45] comes in obedience to the word to come
[1:39:48] down to be baptized by the prophet
[1:39:51] Prophet
[1:39:52] John now in verse 29 the next day
[1:39:56] Jesus Jesus or John sees Jesus com to
[1:39:59] him and said Behold the Lamb of God that
[1:40:02] taketh away the sin of the world now
[1:40:05] isn't this strange language can you
[1:40:07] imagine this is almost blasphemy to
[1:40:10] Israel they have been told take a lamb
[1:40:12] without
[1:40:13] blemish but here's a
[1:40:18] man and he's pointing out but
[1:40:21] look here is the true
[1:40:25] lamb that was only typing it was only
[1:40:28] reflecting it would only work for a time
[1:40:30] but look behold look the
[1:40:37] lamb which cometh to do what take away
[1:40:40] the sin of the
[1:40:42] world and this is he of whom I said
[1:40:46] after me cometh the man that is
[1:40:47] preferred before me for he was before me
[1:40:51] and I knew him not but that he should be
[1:40:53] made manifest to Israel therefore I come
[1:40:56] baptizing with water and John bear
[1:41:00] record saying I saw the Spirit
[1:41:03] descending from heaven like a dove and
[1:41:06] it Abode on him that's right and I knew
[1:41:09] him not but he that sent me to baptize
[1:41:12] with water said the same said to me of
[1:41:15] whom Thou shalt see the spirit
[1:41:18] descending yes what's these words
[1:41:23] and
[1:41:25] remaining on him the same is he that
[1:41:29] baptizes with the Holy Ghost here's the
[1:41:31] only one that can give the spirit is the
[1:41:34] one right here that you see the spirit
[1:41:38] descending and remaining on notice it
[1:41:41] wasn't coming and
[1:41:44] going it wasn't lifted from him and come
[1:41:47] on immediately after that if if you read
[1:41:51] in the Bible John you know Luke 4:4
[1:41:53] Matthew 4:4 both of them to gives you
[1:41:55] the same the same story what up Jesus
[1:41:59] after his
[1:42:00] baptism he is led to the Wilderness to
[1:42:04] be tempted of the devil the other says
[1:42:06] he was driven of the spirit to be
[1:42:09] tempted of the devil so he was led and
[1:42:13] driven amen God brought him that listen
[1:42:16] God Was Not Afraid of this new birth
[1:42:21] he would allow him not to meet a little
[1:42:24] minor devil but Lucifer
[1:42:29] himself now you know you probably have
[1:42:31] met with tormentors in your life but you
[1:42:34] probably Lucifer probably hadn't been
[1:42:36] the one assigned to you one of his imps
[1:42:40] but coming to
[1:42:42] Jesus Lucifer
[1:42:45] himself comes to him there in a
[1:42:49] moment where he is
[1:42:52] tempted now here is Eve back over here
[1:42:55] in the garden and she's
[1:42:58] tempted of what
[1:43:00] eating and here Jesus is tempted of what
[1:43:05] eating and he said if you be now listen
[1:43:08] listen every time the spirit of God
[1:43:10] comes upon you you remember this when
[1:43:13] the Holy Ghost Comes The Devil will
[1:43:15] still tempt
[1:43:16] you you're not about
[1:43:19] temptation you will be tempted in all
[1:43:23] manners like he was so temptation is not
[1:43:27] sin it's yielding to temptation is sin
[1:43:31] and Jesus would meet the devil watch now
[1:43:35] and the devil would question his his
[1:43:39] birth
[1:43:41] experience are you with me he would
[1:43:44] question and said if you are the Son of
[1:43:46] God now God had declared by coming down
[1:43:49] now let me give you this clear every
[1:43:52] person that ever gets the Holy
[1:43:54] Ghost gets the same experience Jesus
[1:43:58] got now it may not be the River Jordan
[1:44:01] it may not be a prophet who said I saw
[1:44:03] the
[1:44:04] spirit so you know but the heaven opens
[1:44:08] and the Devil comes down and takes his
[1:44:11] Abode with you that's what happens to
[1:44:14] every person and it is God saying this
[1:44:17] is my son whom I I am pleased to dwell
[1:44:25] in so when the Holy Ghost comes it is
[1:44:28] God bearing
[1:44:30] witness that you believed and your sins
[1:44:34] are gone and that she identifies himself
[1:44:38] with you that you are his child this is
[1:44:41] the son I love my beloved Son the son I
[1:44:48] love every person that gets the holy GH
[1:44:50] ghost this happens to
[1:44:52] him like I said maybe somebody didn't
[1:44:55] see the dove maybe you didn't see the
[1:44:56] dove but this is what
[1:45:00] happens a prophet with a prophetic eye
[1:45:02] said I saw Heavens open and I saw it
[1:45:05] come down like a dove and here it came
[1:45:08] it was like a light and said this is my
[1:45:11] beloved Son I Heard a Voice saying this
[1:45:13] is my beloved Son so now a prophet may
[1:45:16] not be standing there and witnessing to
[1:45:19] you now listen when you got baptized
[1:45:21] there I tell you what happened you know
[1:45:23] and and the Holy Ghost came well Heaven
[1:45:26] opened and a Dove came down I saw it I
[1:45:28] heard it and this is what it said but
[1:45:31] friends that's what happened no matter
[1:45:35] what are you with me now and he says in
[1:45:40] verse
[1:45:41] 33 and I knew him not but he that sent
[1:45:44] me to baptized with water the same said
[1:45:46] unto me unto whom Thou shalt see the
[1:45:49] spirit descending and remaining on him
[1:45:51] the same as he which baptizes with the
[1:45:53] Holy Ghost and I saw and bear record
[1:45:57] that this is the Son of God I right
[1:46:01] here bear record this is God's
[1:46:06] Offspring and God will do the same thing
[1:46:09] to you he reveals himself to you you're
[1:46:11] my
[1:46:13] child and then you'll be led out and the
[1:46:16] devil will tempt you in every kind of
[1:46:19] manner
[1:46:21] come on it did with Jesus immediately
[1:46:24] listen Church imagine feeling the
[1:46:28] precious Holy Spirit Come and dwell in
[1:46:33] you and then have to face that
[1:46:39] ugly
[1:46:41] Spirit of devil
[1:46:45] oppression if you are a son of
[1:46:49] God
[1:46:51] if you really if you really are God's
[1:46:55] child prove it
[1:46:59] sir but remember Jesus didn't show off
[1:47:02] for the
[1:47:03] devil he didn't obey the devil you don't
[1:47:07] have to prove him nothing you just stay
[1:47:09] with what the word said I repented I was
[1:47:12] baptized he came down he changed my
[1:47:17] life and I don't care about his ugly
[1:47:19] breath and his bad feelings I ain't
[1:47:22] feeling like I felt there at the River
[1:47:24] Jordan but I I'm feeling this other ugly
[1:47:26] Spirit but my feelings have changed but
[1:47:29] God hasn't changed and his word hasn't
[1:47:32] changed therefore you stay with the
[1:47:36] word because full obedience to the word
[1:47:39] entitled you to the Token what does that
[1:47:42] mean it means I repented and I was
[1:47:44] baptized in his name though and true
[1:47:46] repentance and true baptism entitles you
[1:47:49] to the token
[1:47:51] so
[1:47:52] now let's just see if this is true let's
[1:47:55] go to John 14:16 watch what Jesus said I
[1:47:59] will pray the father and he shall give
[1:48:00] you another
[1:48:02] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:48:06] forever in other words he would come and
[1:48:08] dwell and he would never leave
[1:48:11] you even the spirit of Truth whom the
[1:48:14] world cannot receive because it seeth
[1:48:15] and not neither knoweth him but you know
[1:48:17] him for he dwelleth with you and shall
[1:48:21] be in you so notice as long as Jesus was
[1:48:24] there he the Holy Spirit could not come
[1:48:28] so he said I'm going to send another
[1:48:30] comforter and this comforter will be the
[1:48:32] Holy Ghost and he won't just walk with
[1:48:34] you like I've walked with you and you
[1:48:37] had comfort with me walking among you
[1:48:39] but
[1:48:40] now he will be in
[1:48:43] you isn't that glorious Church what a
[1:48:47] difference that makes oh yeah it'd be
[1:48:49] one wonderful it would be wonderful to
[1:48:52] have Jesus walking with
[1:48:54] us wouldn't it to have him walking
[1:48:58] handin hand with Jesus I'm walking with
[1:49:00] him every day I'm walking with him but
[1:49:03] how much greater is it for him to W to
[1:49:06] dwell in
[1:49:08] you come on because there were times
[1:49:11] that Jesus the disciples would be sent
[1:49:14] away in Jesus on a mountain somewhere
[1:49:16] and now here comes the
[1:49:19] devil
[1:49:21] yeah come on but not in this case you
[1:49:25] can never leave him he can never leave
[1:49:28] you you are sealed to the day of
[1:49:31] redemption that's the thing with this
[1:49:33] Covenant Church when the when the Christ
[1:49:36] who saves you now comes in you and he
[1:49:40] abides with you
[1:49:46] forever not when the first Temptation
[1:49:49] comes and says if thou
[1:49:51] be but I'll abide with you for in you
[1:49:55] forever now sealed to the day of
[1:49:58] redemption so born again is more than
[1:50:02] believing and receiveing pardon it's the
[1:50:04] life or the spirit of Christ the holy
[1:50:06] ghost coming to dwell in in you
[1:50:10] forever so you see there without
[1:50:13] Pentecost man remained forever the
[1:50:17] habitual sinner with sin
[1:50:21] nature and after slaughtering the lamb
[1:50:23] and transferring his sins the worshipper
[1:50:26] still remained a sinner with the same
[1:50:29] sinful
[1:50:30] desires to go into Rapture you must
[1:50:33] receive your own
[1:50:36] Pentecost just as Jesus received it at
[1:50:39] the River Jordan that was his
[1:50:44] Pentecost you understand where he was
[1:50:46] filled with the spirit and this is why
[1:50:50] the Christian Life can be so
[1:50:53] frustrating is because you cannot live
[1:50:56] it or be an overcomer without the Holy
[1:51:01] Ghost this is why you must diligently
[1:51:04] seek
[1:51:07] it you see the and it'll be frustrating
[1:51:11] to you it's like keeping the laws you
[1:51:13] know you offend in one point you're
[1:51:15] guilty of
[1:51:18] all
[1:51:21] now Jesus first Doctrine was you must be
[1:51:25] born again very first fundamental
[1:51:28] Doctrine you must be born again to be in
[1:51:31] this Covenant you got to have a new
[1:51:34] birth
[1:51:36] am there was forgiveness so there's
[1:51:39] salvation but God wanted more than that
[1:51:42] for you he wanted Sons birth of his own
[1:51:46] genus now Peter believed on the Lord but
[1:51:48] he wasn't converted
[1:51:51] let's go to Luke 22 and: 31 let's see
[1:51:53] how wonderful his belief was and the
[1:51:58] Lord said Simon
[1:52:01] Simon behold Satan has desired to have
[1:52:04] you that he may sift you his wheat but I
[1:52:07] have prayed for thee that thy faith fell
[1:52:09] not now he had
[1:52:10] faith and when you are converted now
[1:52:13] he's not converted though he has Faith
[1:52:16] strengthen thy Brethren and he said unto
[1:52:19] them Lord Lord I am ready to go with you
[1:52:22] both in prison and to death my faith is
[1:52:25] built up my faith is I'll tell you what
[1:52:27] brother I you know I can withstand the
[1:52:29] test and Jesus said
[1:52:32] listen you don't have the Holy
[1:52:35] Ghost you're not
[1:52:38] converted and I'll tell you what with
[1:52:40] all of this strong belief and
[1:52:43] affirmation I'll never I'll never I'll
[1:52:48] never
[1:52:50] he said Peter you'll deny me three times
[1:52:54] for the for the
[1:52:57] crows th will Thrice deny
[1:53:01] me that th even knows
[1:53:05] me so look at it this is why you know
[1:53:09] you can turn your new Leaf you can vow
[1:53:12] your vow you can say it's it's kind of
[1:53:16] like a marriage Pro you know deal you
[1:53:18] stand up there I'll be true to you I I
[1:53:21] until death do is pardon I'll be
[1:53:23] faithful I I I'll be with you in
[1:53:25] sickness and health you know and this
[1:53:27] all these vows you make only to be
[1:53:31] broken because really you're not going
[1:53:34] to be able to keep it without the power
[1:53:35] of the Holy
[1:53:39] Ghost so now again here here he was
[1:53:43] immediately goes and denies the
[1:53:46] Lord even though he has a strong faith
[1:53:49] in this strong acclamation and and
[1:53:53] confession I'll go with you even to
[1:53:56] prison and to death and there he stands
[1:53:59] there warming his hands
[1:54:01] and are you a galileon no I'm not
[1:54:05] galileon oh I believe you're one of his
[1:54:08] disciples no I'm not one of his
[1:54:11] disciples oh yes you are so he curses to
[1:54:14] prove he's
[1:54:18] not so now again we know what the the
[1:54:22] terminologies of what born again is but
[1:54:25] well just watch what happened in the
[1:54:26] Bible when they were born again Peter
[1:54:27] was a Believer the apostles were
[1:54:29] believer but they wern't born again till
[1:54:31] after the Holy Ghost came on them at
[1:54:33] Pentecost now they were wondering what
[1:54:35] happened Peter said you men of Israel be
[1:54:38] this known Jesus of Nazareth a man
[1:54:41] approved of God among you by S signs and
[1:54:44] miracles and wonders which God did by
[1:54:46] him who was he was forn to determine
[1:54:49] that um counsel you took Wicked hands
[1:54:52] and crucified who God has raised up and
[1:54:55] we're his Witnesses he shed forth for
[1:54:57] this that you do and see and hear now
[1:55:00] and it's according to scripture and they
[1:55:01] said men and Brethren what shall we do
[1:55:04] to be saved and Peter said
[1:55:08] repent so that's a very first thing
[1:55:11] repentance turning
[1:55:14] from now do you know we have the power
[1:55:20] to remit sins in this
[1:55:23] church the Catholic Church says uh you
[1:55:25] know whoever sins the pope remits is for
[1:55:28] forgiven you know whoever's retained is
[1:55:30] retained but you know we have the power
[1:55:33] but you know what that power comes by
[1:55:37] repentance baptism and receiving the
[1:55:40] gift of the Holy Ghost that is the power
[1:55:42] to remit sin that's right amen this is
[1:55:46] the authority that God gave us listen
[1:55:48] brother Bram and God God hiding himself
[1:55:50] in Simplicity we want you saved friends
[1:55:54] we want you filled remember you're saved
[1:55:57] of course but when you accept Christ
[1:55:59] you're saved but you're not converted
[1:56:01] until you receive the Holy Ghost now you
[1:56:04] know that that's right P Jesus told
[1:56:06] Peter the night of betrayal he was
[1:56:08] already saved he said now after you're
[1:56:10] converted strengthen your brethren
[1:56:12] that's right oh sure you you've accepted
[1:56:14] Christ as a savior but when you're
[1:56:16] converted is when you are really changed
[1:56:19] that's right and he wasn't changed yet
[1:56:21] he had cursed before the Lord and denied
[1:56:23] him and everything but after his
[1:56:25] conversion after thou converted um
[1:56:28] strengthen your brethren is that's right
[1:56:30] that's what the scripture says anyhow
[1:56:33] that makes it right Jesus told Peter
[1:56:35] that followed him and cast out Devils
[1:56:37] done Miracles and everything you're not
[1:56:39] converted yet but after you're converted
[1:56:41] then strengthen your brethren so let's
[1:56:43] just see how wonderful a confession that
[1:56:45] he has let's go to Matthew
[1:56:48] 16:13
[1:56:53] it's a great
[1:56:54] confession when Jesus came to the coast
[1:56:56] accessory of Philippi he asked the
[1:56:59] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[1:57:03] the son of man am and they said some say
[1:57:08] thou art John the Baptist some Elias and
[1:57:12] others jeremias one of the prophets and
[1:57:15] he said but who do you say I am and
[1:57:18] Simon Peter answered said Thou Art the
[1:57:21] Christ the son of the Living
[1:57:25] God now Jesus affirms it is a true
[1:57:30] Revelation for he said he answers said
[1:57:33] blessed art thou Simon B Jonah for flesh
[1:57:36] and blood is not revealed it unto thee
[1:57:39] but my Father which is in heaven so
[1:57:42] Peter had confess that Jesus was the
[1:57:45] Christ Peter had even been
[1:57:48] baptized right now listen
[1:57:52] now you say but we receive the Holy
[1:57:57] Ghost when we're we're born again when
[1:57:59] we believe but the Bible said the devil
[1:58:01] believes
[1:58:02] also and
[1:58:05] trembles you say well I live a good life
[1:58:08] well so had the
[1:58:10] apostles but they wasn't
[1:58:13] converted now so you see they had cast
[1:58:16] out Devils they had healed the sick they
[1:58:18] had preached the gospel
[1:58:19] and still were not converted this still
[1:58:22] happens over and over and over again
[1:58:24] today people who are never converted and
[1:58:28] yet they preach the gospel they even
[1:58:31] have miracles
[1:58:35] happen without
[1:58:38] Pentecost we have forgiveness of sins
[1:58:41] without the changing of our
[1:58:44] Natures to become a new
[1:58:47] creature and of course for that to
[1:58:50] happen there has to be a death of the
[1:58:51] old man now Pentecost is an experience
[1:58:55] that every person must
[1:58:58] have it's a pre it's a prerequisite for
[1:59:01] the Rapture it's a
[1:59:04] requirement so you know today we got
[1:59:06] this organization called Pentecost they
[1:59:09] are not you can't organize Pentecost
[1:59:12] right Pentecost is an
[1:59:15] experience we have methodists in here
[1:59:18] that got it we have we have Catholics in
[1:59:20] here that got it we have Baptists that
[1:59:23] got it we got Pentecostals here that got
[1:59:25] it Pentecost is experience and if you
[1:59:28] hadn't if you hadn't had it you can't go
[1:59:31] into
[1:59:32] Rapture it's impossible now brother Bram
[1:59:35] said and I'm going to read it in this
[1:59:37] entirely Pentecost is experience the
[1:59:39] methodists get it the Baptist get it all
[1:59:42] of them get it Pentecost is not
[1:59:44] organized it's an experience and if you
[1:59:47] haven't had the experience of Pentecost
[1:59:49] cost come receive it now remember if you
[1:59:51] believe me to be a servant his Prophet
[1:59:54] remember there is a genuine baptism of
[1:59:57] the Holy Ghost right in the midst of all
[2:00:00] the fanaticism there is a genuine Holy
[2:00:03] Ghost birth a genuine born of God you
[2:00:07] come believe it right
[2:00:09] now so brother Bram tells us if you
[2:00:12] haven't receive it get
[2:00:16] it now so so again it will it will make
[2:00:21] him manifest himself that he is here
[2:00:23] that and that the holy spirit that you
[2:00:26] receive as brother brandom said
[2:00:28] Pentecost is the only thing that is
[2:00:31] going to prove Christianity you can't
[2:00:35] prove it by science you can't prove it
[2:00:37] by nothing but by a Pentecostal
[2:00:40] experience you Baptist know that you
[2:00:42] Methodist Presbyterian whatever you are
[2:00:44] and you know it takes a Pentecostal
[2:00:47] experience to prove God and that's the
[2:00:49] each individual it doesn't prove the
[2:00:51] organization it proves the
[2:00:54] individual so Believing on the Lord and
[2:00:57] repentance from sin makes the promise to
[2:01:01] you as brother brandom tells us in
[2:01:03] question answers on the Holy Ghost Jesus
[2:01:06] in Luke
[2:01:07] 24:49 had commissioned the apostles
[2:01:10] after they been saved and Sanctified
[2:01:12] according to the word Justified
[2:01:13] Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:15] Sanctified in John 17:17 when Jesus said
[2:01:19] sanctify them Father through the truth
[2:01:20] Thy word is truth and he was the word
[2:01:23] now he gave them power to heal the sick
[2:01:25] cast out Devils raise the dead they came
[2:01:28] back rejoicing their names was on the
[2:01:30] Lamb's Book of Life you remember we went
[2:01:32] through that now but they wasn't yet
[2:01:33] converted Peter Jesus told Peter the
[2:01:36] night of his crucifixion after you had
[2:01:38] converted strengthen your brethren so
[2:01:41] they have been Justified and
[2:01:44] Sanctified are you with me yeah but now
[2:01:49] they must receive
[2:01:53] Pentecost now this is the same as
[2:01:57] Moses a prophet a miracle worker a
[2:02:02] lawgiver but a man upon whom the spirit
[2:02:05] ascended and
[2:02:07] descended but didn't
[2:02:09] stay didn't dwell in in one of those
[2:02:13] moments where his temper got out of
[2:02:15] control he sined by exalting himself
[2:02:18] kept him out of the Promised Land what
[2:02:20] was the matter with Moses he wasn't
[2:02:24] converted get this there wasn't a
[2:02:27] converted man in the Old
[2:02:29] Testament it's only at Pentecost you can
[2:02:32] be
[2:02:34] converted now there were great prophets
[2:02:37] in the Old Testament let's name a few
[2:02:39] Moses Elijah Jeremiah Ezekiel Isaiah and
[2:02:44] finally it
[2:02:45] reached the
[2:02:47] climax
[2:02:49] and ends with the greatest prophet of
[2:02:53] all John the
[2:02:55] Baptist he is the last prophet of the
[2:02:58] Old
[2:02:59] Testament because the Bible said the law
[2:03:02] and the prophets were until John John's
[2:03:05] the last one now watch let's go to
[2:03:08] Matthew 11 verse 11 and here's what
[2:03:11] Jesus said about him verily I say to you
[2:03:14] among them that are born of women there
[2:03:16] has not risen a greater than John the
[2:03:17] Baptist hey hey buddy he brought it
[2:03:21] right down to of all all
[2:03:25] humankind there's not been a man born
[2:03:28] among them that are born of women there
[2:03:30] has not been risen a greater than John
[2:03:32] the
[2:03:33] Baptist so here he is the greatest
[2:03:35] Prophet the greatest
[2:03:37] man Moses would be a lawgiver Moses
[2:03:41] would bring water from the rock Moses
[2:03:44] would would Smite the Egyptians with
[2:03:45] plagues Moses lives in Elijah what a
[2:03:49] great man of power but John the Baptist
[2:03:52] he doesn't even do Miracles but he's got
[2:03:55] a greater job he introduces the
[2:03:58] Messiah he says Behold the Lamb of God
[2:04:01] to take away this sin the world and he's
[2:04:03] the greatest of all of his Revelation is
[2:04:06] the
[2:04:08] greatest watch now
[2:04:12] notwithstanding
[2:04:16] notwithstanding am I reading this
[2:04:20] how many feels like the least in the
[2:04:24] Kingdom you feel like the
[2:04:28] least the least in the Kingdom of
[2:04:32] Heaven is greater than
[2:04:36] John with your Born Again experience you
[2:04:40] are greater than Moses greater than
[2:04:43] Elijah John was greater than them come
[2:04:45] on I just read it to you in the Bible
[2:04:49] amen you're greater than
[2:04:50] John you're greater than anybody any
[2:04:53] great prophet you're greater than
[2:04:57] David come on now greater is he that is
[2:05:00] in you than what David was you David did
[2:05:05] his exploits they did their exploits but
[2:05:07] greater is he that is in
[2:05:11] you amen than any of them in the Old
[2:05:14] Testament the least the smallest one
[2:05:20] amen the newborn child I'm talking about
[2:05:24] into the kingdom just born again newly
[2:05:27] born
[2:05:28] again you are greater than any of
[2:05:34] them with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:37] it sets you apart they were of the old
[2:05:39] creation you are of a new
[2:05:42] creation you are of a brand new
[2:05:47] species how Hallelujah listen when when
[2:05:50] they come out of the upper room the
[2:05:52] devil had never seen people like
[2:05:56] this other than Jesus Christ and he
[2:05:59] thought he had killed him and done away
[2:06:01] with him and he done went away back into
[2:06:03] heaven and he's gone but on the day of
[2:06:06] Pentecost Here Comes 120 just like him
[2:06:09] born of The Same
[2:06:12] Spirit Hallelujah and if Moses could
[2:06:15] cast him out under the blood of bulls
[2:06:18] and goost what can you do Under the
[2:06:20] blood of Jesus Christ the least in the
[2:06:23] Kingdom your prayers Shake hell your
[2:06:28] prayers Shake Heaven your prayers
[2:06:36] Prevail though you're the least in the
[2:06:38] Kingdom don't underestimate yourself you
[2:06:42] are the blood wash bloodb Sons and
[2:06:45] Daughters of the Living God fill with
[2:06:48] the Spirit it dwell deity God living in
[2:06:52] [Applause]
[2:06:55] you
[2:06:57] Hallelujah
[2:06:59] greater
[2:07:03] greater
[2:07:04] now until you receive the Holy Ghost
[2:07:08] you're believing unto eternal life but
[2:07:11] when the Holy Ghost comes in it is
[2:07:13] eternal life you can never perish you
[2:07:17] have passed from death un life now it's
[2:07:21] kind of like this you know brother
[2:07:23] Brandon would liken it in 59 and also 64
[2:07:27] in his question answers he would he
[2:07:29] would liken it to a conception in the
[2:07:34] womb you got a little baby born in the
[2:07:38] womb and when I say born I mean
[2:07:41] conceived it may be just a little tiny
[2:07:44] bit of
[2:07:45] Faith but it's a start that's right
[2:07:49] now this is what brother brandham told
[2:07:51] us in the 59 series of the Holy Ghost he
[2:07:54] said now you've got to protect the woman
[2:07:58] the
[2:08:00] church because she's pregnant with
[2:08:06] children all
[2:08:08] right and you what now he said Satan
[2:08:11] will attack the church to destroy those
[2:08:14] that are just conceived in the womb
[2:08:16] that's
[2:08:17] right
[2:08:20] this is what he does when he brings
[2:08:21] trouble in this
[2:08:22] church brings questions brings doubting
[2:08:26] you know accusations against the
[2:08:28] ministry accusations against the the the
[2:08:31] church and you know all this yeah that's
[2:08:35] Satan be careful what you're Anointed
[2:08:37] with is
[2:08:39] Satan because what he wants to do he
[2:08:41] said you have to protect the woman who's
[2:08:44] expected with child from the hard
[2:08:46] bruises of Satan that's right
[2:08:49] so when someone Falls away let's say
[2:08:52] supposedly a stalard
[2:08:54] Christian those that are truly born
[2:08:57] again it's not going to kill
[2:09:01] them who's it going to kill those little
[2:09:04] ones that that that are just conceived
[2:09:06] in the womb she'll
[2:09:09] miscarry who will it
[2:09:12] discourage you know who will you're
[2:09:14] bickering you're fighting you're fussing
[2:09:16] you're arguing you're you know you're
[2:09:17] you're feelings against who are you
[2:09:20] going to kill you're going to kill those
[2:09:22] young that are in the womb of the
[2:09:25] church and you're going to be
[2:09:29] responsible you know I I know there's
[2:09:31] some of you right here where I went up
[2:09:34] and and spoke at a church just before a
[2:09:36] major major split it was a become a very
[2:09:39] horrible thing but the spirits was
[2:09:41] already working and I stood there and I
[2:09:44] told them I said listen you know you're
[2:09:46] going to give an account to God for
[2:09:48] Every Soul every person every person
[2:09:51] that is wounded and hurt because the
[2:09:53] church will get hurt and it'll abort the
[2:09:55] baby you'll cause a miscarriage from
[2:09:58] this hard
[2:09:59] bruise and it'll be the young that are
[2:10:05] hurt now again you're because why you're
[2:10:09] begotten of the spirit brother Brandon
[2:10:12] said it's sanctification but never never
[2:10:15] born of the spirit until the Holy Ghost
[2:10:17] comes
[2:10:19] so uh let me just say until the Holy
[2:10:21] Ghost comes until the Breath of Life
[2:10:24] enters in you are still in danger of
[2:10:27] being
[2:10:32] aborted never come to
[2:10:35] life this is why it's so important to
[2:10:38] grow and come on all the way to a new
[2:10:41] birth and when I'm saying I'm talking
[2:10:43] about growing through sanctification I
[2:10:44] don't mean you evolved to get the Holy
[2:10:46] Ghost the Holy Ghost is a birth it's not
[2:10:48] an involvement uh you know an involving
[2:10:51] it's the it's a birth it's a life that
[2:10:54] comes into you now notice so you have
[2:10:57] the baby's got the life in the womb of
[2:11:00] the mother little muscles are quivering
[2:11:02] in his life but it's a different life
[2:11:05] than what breathes the Breath of Life
[2:11:07] when it breathes the breath of life into
[2:11:09] its nostrils then it becomes a living
[2:11:12] Soul so you see again sanctification is
[2:11:16] a cleansing it's a prep preparation of
[2:11:18] life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is
[2:11:21] life preparation is cleansing The Vessel
[2:11:25] and the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel
[2:11:27] sanctification mean cleanse and set
[2:11:30] aside for service the Holy Spirit puts
[2:11:33] it in service you are that vessel that
[2:11:36] God cleaned
[2:11:37] up now let's just go to Acts chapter 19
[2:11:41] and verse one let's just see some
[2:11:43] Believers here I just I'm going to nail
[2:11:45] down this part and then we'll have
[2:11:47] communion
[2:11:51] and it came to pass that while Apollos
[2:11:54] was at Corinth Paul having passed
[2:11:57] through the upper Coast came to Ephesus
[2:12:00] and finding certain disciples he said
[2:12:03] unto them have you received the Holy
[2:12:05] Ghost and everybody say
[2:12:08] since you
[2:12:13] believed now they were
[2:12:15] Believers but they hadn't even heard
[2:12:19] that there was a holy
[2:12:23] ghost I I really don't know how they
[2:12:26] were in the message and that was the
[2:12:28] message come on they had recognized John
[2:12:32] he was Elijah here was promised the
[2:12:36] Messiah and here somehow another they
[2:12:39] miss his death burial Resurrection
[2:12:42] Ascension and coming
[2:12:46] again I mean the very reason that John
[2:12:49] was sent to be a
[2:12:52] prophet was to identify the
[2:12:55] Messiah and they missed the whole
[2:12:58] message yet were Believers that God had
[2:13:02] sent a
[2:13:05] prophet isn't that
[2:13:08] amazing I mean you you say how could
[2:13:11] that be because you see the whole
[2:13:14] dispensation was being
[2:13:16] blinded as the eyes of the Jews were
[2:13:18] blinded and the and the Gentiles were
[2:13:20] coming in so there was great blindness a
[2:13:23] darkness in that age taking out the
[2:13:25] light now we're here over at the last
[2:13:28] day and people can recognize God sent
[2:13:31] Malachi 4 Luke
[2:13:34] 1730 God sent a prophet we got a message
[2:13:38] and
[2:13:42] Miss oh
[2:13:44] yeah
[2:13:46] right Miss highlight that's right of my
[2:13:50] entire
[2:13:52] Ministry what was the highlight of
[2:13:54] John's Ministry introducing the
[2:13:57] Messiah and here I am I'm introducing to
[2:14:01] you the Messiah the token the Holy Ghost
[2:14:04] it's come again in the evening time they
[2:14:06] haven't had it in the times past they've
[2:14:09] had the lamb kept up but now it's
[2:14:11] evening time and wrath is about to
[2:14:13] strike and you must have the token and
[2:14:15] I'm saying look the lamb
[2:14:19] take his blood and apply
[2:14:21] it and they miss it totally miss it why
[2:14:26] because in that kind of Darkness they
[2:14:28] even crucified their
[2:14:32] Messiah they got so
[2:14:35] confused that crucified the Lord Of
[2:14:40] Glory and Paul said had they had known
[2:14:44] it they would not have done
[2:14:46] it
[2:14:48] and leoa is going to be the same way
[2:14:51] listen brother bam tells us the closing
[2:14:54] out if you read the leoan age he will
[2:14:56] tell you I'm talking about as he
[2:14:58] preached it in the sermon the of the
[2:15:00] revelation of Jesus Christ series you
[2:15:02] take the leoan age brother bradam tells
[2:15:05] you the reason why that the Jewish
[2:15:09] dispensation um faded out and went out
[2:15:12] into darkness was because they made fun
[2:15:17] of P
[2:15:19] cost yes they mocked and they made fun
[2:15:23] of it and they blasphemed the Holy Ghost
[2:15:26] and when they did they were s in the
[2:15:28] outer Darkness into 2,000 years of
[2:15:34] tribulation well we don't have 2,000
[2:15:36] years of tribulation for the Gentiles
[2:15:38] there's three and a half years coming
[2:15:40] but this is exactly what's happening in
[2:15:42] this day and hour Pentecost is being
[2:15:45] rejected and when it's rejected and
[2:15:48] mocked and made fun of and ridiculed and
[2:15:51] denied guess what happens to tribulation
[2:15:53] you
[2:15:59] go brother brandom tells you in that
[2:16:03] sermon he said it's Jesus with dirty
[2:16:05] feet the unwelcomed Christ he comes
[2:16:08] right back around and he comes right
[2:16:10] back to the the he said you the the
[2:16:14] Olive Branch was cut off that the wild
[2:16:16] would be grafted in but now we come to
[2:16:19] the end of the Gentiles and now the
[2:16:21] Gentiles the wild branch is being cut
[2:16:24] off and the original Olive Branch the
[2:16:27] Jews being brought back
[2:16:29] in what
[2:16:31] happened they rejected
[2:16:35] Pentecost the
[2:16:41] token they made fun of those drunk in
[2:16:44] the
[2:16:45] spirit they mocked it and said it's some
[2:16:48] kind of new
[2:16:51] wine they rejected it cuz we have a
[2:16:58] lamb and our lamb we've been justified
[2:17:02] by
[2:17:03] Faith by believing let's go
[2:17:06] on so let's look at this they missed the
[2:17:10] whole point going back to Acts 19 and he
[2:17:13] said unto them unto them were you
[2:17:16] baptized well tell me about your works
[2:17:19] well we got baptized unto John it's
[2:17:24] baptism all right and so then he says
[2:17:28] but have you received the Holy Ghost
[2:17:29] since you believe look verse three now
[2:17:31] and he and he said well how are you
[2:17:34] baptized and then he said well John
[2:17:37] baptized with the baptism of
[2:17:39] repentance saying unto the people that
[2:17:42] they should believe on him who should
[2:17:43] come after him that is on Christ Jesus
[2:17:48] and when they heard this they were
[2:17:50] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:17:53] and when Paul laid his hands upon them
[2:17:55] the Holy Ghost came on them and they
[2:17:57] spake with tongues and
[2:18:00] prophesied so I want you to notice the
[2:18:03] Holy Ghost came and it was an experience
[2:18:05] now we don't care if you prophesy if you
[2:18:08] speak in tongues just so something
[2:18:10] happens your life has changed that's
[2:18:12] what we're looking for amen we're not
[2:18:14] looking for a certain evidence if it was
[2:18:16] then we'd have to both of these because
[2:18:18] they' spoken tongues and prophesied but
[2:18:21] anyway let's go on the Holy Ghost comes
[2:18:23] after believing Ephesians 1:13 in whom
[2:18:26] you also trust after you heard the word
[2:18:28] of
[2:18:29] Truth The Gospel of your
[2:18:32] salvation in whom also after you
[2:18:34] believed you were sealed with that Holy
[2:18:37] Spirit of Promise notice you were sealed
[2:18:41] with that Holy Spirit of promise when
[2:18:43] after you believed so it starts out with
[2:18:47] hiss up but it's got to be dipped into
[2:18:50] the blood and
[2:18:53] applied it's not enough just to have it
[2:18:56] in a bucket in your house it's got to be
[2:19:01] applied now let's go to Acts chapter 8
[2:19:04] and verse 5 I want to cover this real
[2:19:06] close what's this let's see about
[2:19:10] believing and and receiving the word
[2:19:13] because today it has been so commonly
[2:19:16] taught just believe the message you got
[2:19:18] the Holy Ghost if you if you believe it
[2:19:21] with all your heart you got the Holy
[2:19:22] Ghost you know because that's the real
[2:19:24] evidence you believe the message all
[2:19:27] right let's just see let's just see this
[2:19:30] Acts chapter 8 and verse 5 then Philip
[2:19:33] went down to the city of samarit Samaria
[2:19:37] and preached Christ unto
[2:19:39] them and the people with one Accord gave
[2:19:42] heed to those things which Philip spake
[2:19:44] hearing and seeing the Miracles that he
[2:19:46] did so they see the the Vindication they
[2:19:48] see Christ preached they see he's a
[2:19:50] living
[2:19:52] Christ and they give heed for unclean
[2:19:56] spirits crying out crying with a loud
[2:19:58] voice came out of many that were
[2:20:00] possessed with them and many taken with
[2:20:03] PES and that were lame were healed and
[2:20:05] there was great joy in that
[2:20:08] City and there was a certain man called
[2:20:11] Simon who Before Time in the same city
[2:20:14] used sorcery which the people of Samaria
[2:20:17] given out to himself was some great one
[2:20:19] to whom they all gave heed from the
[2:20:22] least to the greatest sayth this man is
[2:20:26] the great power of
[2:20:29] God what's next and to him they had
[2:20:32] regard because that of a long time he
[2:20:35] had Bewitched them was
[2:20:37] sorcery and when they had believed
[2:20:41] Philip now get this
[2:20:46] believed
[2:20:47] preaching the things concerning the
[2:20:49] kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[2:20:52] Christ they were baptized both men and
[2:20:54] women now this is as far as some of our
[2:20:58] missionaries are taking people that's
[2:21:00] right believing and baptized teaching
[2:21:03] the doctrine of the message serpy
[2:21:05] predestination you believe that oh yeah
[2:21:07] are we you know okay well now baptism in
[2:21:10] Jesus name okay get bapti and that's
[2:21:12] where they leave
[2:21:14] them right there
[2:21:18] watch this is where they had come
[2:21:20] Phillip had brought them this far with
[2:21:24] miracles signs wonders Vindication with
[2:21:27] the word he was preaching he had
[2:21:29] baptized him and look even here Simon
[2:21:32] himself believed
[2:21:34] also I'm just telling you what the Bible
[2:21:36] said Simon
[2:21:41] believed and he was
[2:21:44] baptized and he continued with Phillip
[2:21:46] wondered but holding the miracles signs
[2:21:48] that were done now when the apostles
[2:21:50] were which were at Jerusalem heard that
[2:21:53] Samaria had received the word of God I
[2:21:55] want you to get this they receiv
[2:21:56] received the
[2:21:59] word they had believed and were baptized
[2:22:03] believed baptized received the word
[2:22:07] sounds pretty good doesn't it sounds
[2:22:09] complete don't it what's now who when
[2:22:13] they they sent when that they heard that
[2:22:15] they received the word of God they sent
[2:22:16] to the Peter and John who when they were
[2:22:19] come down prayed for them that they
[2:22:21] might receive the Holy
[2:22:24] Ghost for as yet he was falling upon
[2:22:27] none of them even though they had
[2:22:30] believed and were
[2:22:33] baptized and had heard the
[2:22:37] word what he had fallen upon none of
[2:22:41] them only that they were baptized in the
[2:22:44] name of the Lord Jesus that's the that
[2:22:46] is is the status of many around the
[2:22:50] message today they've come that
[2:22:52] far then they laid their hands on them
[2:22:55] and they received the Holy
[2:22:59] Ghost and after that then Simon is
[2:23:03] called out as being a child of the
[2:23:06] devil come on even though he had
[2:23:08] believed and was baptized he's still a
[2:23:11] child of the
[2:23:13] devil amen he had not received the Holy
[2:23:17] Yoshi had really not ever even come to
[2:23:19] True
[2:23:20] repentance he wanted Miracles and signs
[2:23:23] and have that without an converted
[2:23:26] life and many will come to me in that
[2:23:29] day saying Lord Lord have we not done
[2:23:31] this in your name and he'll say to me to
[2:23:34] them depart from iniquity I never knew
[2:23:37] you you know we've had we have made this
[2:23:41] into a profession of faith I believe the
[2:23:44] message well brother if you believe the
[2:23:46] message message you got the Holy Ghost I
[2:23:49] I talked with a pastor here recently
[2:23:51] Pastor a large church over
[2:23:55] overseas and he and and he said brother
[2:23:58] Tim talk to this brother he's
[2:24:01] uh he's got marriage trouble and I can't
[2:24:03] I can't get to the root of his problem I
[2:24:06] can't help him seem like and I I keep
[2:24:08] telling him you know you need to grow up
[2:24:10] in Christ and you know you need
[2:24:14] to to to have some spiritual growth and
[2:24:19] he says but Tim you know he's uh been
[2:24:22] untrue to his marriage
[2:24:24] vow he's even done homosexual acts I
[2:24:28] said but brother I said you don't need
[2:24:31] me to talk to him you need to tell him
[2:24:34] he needs to be born again he needs the
[2:24:36] Holy
[2:24:37] Ghost that's what he needs and he says
[2:24:41] to me but brother Tim he has the Holy
[2:24:44] Ghost I said no he doesn't have the Holy
[2:24:46] he believes the message brother Tim and
[2:24:48] has been baptized I said he don't have
[2:24:50] the Holy
[2:24:53] Ghost if your nature isn't
[2:24:57] changed I don't care what your
[2:24:59] profession of faith is the Nature has to
[2:25:02] be
[2:25:03] changed you know again I've had
[2:25:06] conversations with prodal who wonder why
[2:25:08] don't it work for me they look at others
[2:25:11] as they see as a model Christian and
[2:25:14] long to have a Christian Life too but oh
[2:25:17] it's just not for me I believe the
[2:25:19] message brother Tim I believe everything
[2:25:21] you preach well believing is a good
[2:25:24] start but it's not
[2:25:26] enough listen the theme of ever
[2:25:29] Apostles was have you received the Holy
[2:25:32] Ghost since you believe that was the
[2:25:34] theme of the Bible that was the theme of
[2:25:35] the book of Acts you will receive power
[2:25:38] after the Holy Ghost has come on you
[2:25:41] they had power to cast out Devils before
[2:25:43] but this power was to live an overcoming
[2:25:46] life and cast out
[2:25:48] devils are you with me amen you see
[2:25:52] again there there is so many that come
[2:25:54] up to that part and they they say well
[2:25:58] have this uncertain sound brother bradam
[2:26:00] called it listen if you'll confess with
[2:26:02] your lips that Jesus is a Christ take
[2:26:04] him and take him you have received the
[2:26:06] Holy Ghost cuz the minute you believe
[2:26:08] that Jesus is a Christ you have the Holy
[2:26:10] Ghost that's an uncertain
[2:26:15] sound well why are people taking this
[2:26:18] uncertain sound because the devil is
[2:26:21] doing everything he
[2:26:24] can to keep you out of the new
[2:26:28] birth and he'll even let you go to a
[2:26:31] message
[2:26:33] Church he'll even let you believe the
[2:26:40] message as long as you don't get the
[2:26:45] token
[2:26:50] here's how brother Brandon felt about it
[2:26:52] he says applied Church don't fail don't
[2:26:55] don't don't don't let the sun set don't
[2:26:57] don't don't rest day or night don't take
[2:27:00] no chance it won't work children it
[2:27:02] won't work you must have the token you
[2:27:04] say yeah I believe yeah I go yeah I
[2:27:07] believe the message that's all right
[2:27:09] that's good but you must have the token
[2:27:11] you hear brandom Tabernacle you must
[2:27:14] have the token displayed without it all
[2:27:17] you're believing is in vain you'll live
[2:27:18] a good life you'll listen to what the
[2:27:20] word says you'll go to church you'll try
[2:27:22] to live right that's fine but that's not
[2:27:24] it when I see the blood that's the
[2:27:27] token Minister good man moral man
[2:27:31] whatever you are you know that God's
[2:27:32] taking cigarettes from you listen to
[2:27:34] this women you know he's taking shorts
[2:27:37] and short hair and everything from you
[2:27:39] you know he did that and then you turn
[2:27:41] around and do despite and count the
[2:27:42] blood of the Covenant as a holy Unholy
[2:27:45] Unholy thing who sent Sanctified and
[2:27:47] brought you this far like the spies that
[2:27:49] they come up right to the borderline and
[2:27:51] they looked over and said well I know
[2:27:52] it's there but the obstacle is too great
[2:27:54] we look like grasshoppers they perish in
[2:27:56] the wilderness borderline Believers
[2:28:00] don't just come this far say I believe
[2:28:03] the message you obey the messenger come
[2:28:06] into Christ so I believe every word you
[2:28:09] said every word said brother brandom
[2:28:11] that's good but that's just being able
[2:28:14] to
[2:28:14] read take the message taking your heart
[2:28:17] that you must have the token the very
[2:28:20] Life of Christ must be in you now I'm
[2:28:23] going to just read you some
[2:28:24] Snippets I'm just taking these phrases
[2:28:27] out because brother brandham this is all

[2:34:28] token you must you believe like brother
[2:34:30] bradam said in and he told about how
[2:34:33] that your birth is a paradox or a
[2:34:37] miracle every one of you with the Holy
[2:34:39] Ghost is a
[2:34:41] miracle amen and you see the
[2:34:46] why something happened to you for you to
[2:34:48] be a miracle and unless it happens you
[2:34:51] can't be a Christian it must be a
[2:34:53] paradox for you to become a Christian
[2:34:56] you know where God changes the spirit in
[2:34:58] the man gives him a new birth for out of
[2:35:00] that outside of that nothing works God
[2:35:04] Alone can do that it's a miracle that
[2:35:07] God can change a man's thinking his ways
[2:35:10] his life and change it from what what it
[2:35:12] was to what it can be when he makes it
[2:35:15] no notic this he gives an illustration I
[2:35:18] believe he illustrates what happened was
[2:35:20] called about a boy in his own church now
[2:35:23] here he's raised in the church he was
[2:35:26] going with a fine boy a fine girl I
[2:35:28] meant he was out of a fine
[2:35:32] family and there was an issue came with
[2:35:34] him and a girl
[2:35:37] that he just walked away and he did
[2:35:39] something wrong and he couldn't
[2:35:41] apologize like a gentleman
[2:35:43] should the mother and father called him
[2:35:46] said brother brandham we'd like to know
[2:35:48] know what's wrong with our
[2:35:51] boy and he says the boy was a Christian
[2:35:54] as far as a Believer he had repented and
[2:35:57] been baptized and had his position among
[2:36:01] Believers yet had not received the
[2:36:04] baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter how
[2:36:06] much he thought he had you thinking
[2:36:08] you're having and having is two
[2:36:10] different things you might try be able
[2:36:12] to try to say you have you might be able
[2:36:14] to show some evidence of some emotion
[2:36:16] but unless your life is vindicating what
[2:36:19] you're professing to have you still
[2:36:20] haven't got it no matter how much
[2:36:23] emotions how much you jump or run or
[2:36:25] sensation speaking in tongu shouting you
[2:36:28] or whatever you may lay upon it it's all
[2:36:30] right I believe in that too but unless
[2:36:32] your life copes with your testimony then
[2:36:35] you haven't got
[2:36:36] it you got to show manifest the fruits
[2:36:39] of the spirit so brother Bram goes to
[2:36:41] his his jeans and he says now you know
[2:36:45] natural
[2:36:46] you're born between a an
[2:36:48] Irishman and a German do this German
[2:36:52] family there's a strain in that family
[2:36:54] they can't say I'm sorry they can't
[2:36:56] repent they they will look at you and
[2:36:59] not even talk to you you know they they
[2:37:01] just stare at you you know you can try
[2:37:03] to talk to them on the other hand the
[2:37:06] father is an Irishman and there he's
[2:37:09] Moody and high tempered and high
[2:37:12] strong and his whole family is like that
[2:37:16] except for one other brother or one
[2:37:18] other person in the family and the
[2:37:21] mother and the father are both
[2:37:22] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:37:24] and they brought up this young man in
[2:37:26] the way of the
[2:37:28] Lord now he's about 18 years old and and
[2:37:31] a fine kid been a real model boy at home
[2:37:34] a model kid and and he and you know the
[2:37:39] the mother's family is
[2:37:42] she their family being of the German
[2:37:45] they they won't ask for forgiveness or
[2:37:47] ask for pardon and he says the other is
[2:37:50] high tempered and Moody and whatever and
[2:37:54] he said the genes of this mother and
[2:37:57] father of this boy no matter how much
[2:38:00] they are converted Still Remains In the
[2:38:04] Flesh that's been inner breed into this
[2:38:08] boy now get
[2:38:10] this you can take two Holy Ghost filled
[2:38:14] people and you still birth unconverted
[2:38:20] children and even though your life has
[2:38:23] been
[2:38:24] changed and her life has been changed
[2:38:27] those genetics come right on
[2:38:30] down within that unconverted
[2:38:35] heart are you with me now and he said
[2:38:38] now you look at your family on this side
[2:38:41] they're all drunks fighting shooting
[2:38:43] cutting and then you know
[2:38:46] and then mother look at your family
[2:38:48] there a bunch of people sit there won't
[2:38:50] speak very independent irreverent to
[2:38:53] religion you know one you know one one
[2:38:56] apologize can't repent so but not you
[2:39:00] you're one of of all your siblings
[2:39:03] you're sweet and kind and forgiven what
[2:39:05] does
[2:39:09] that what does
[2:39:11] it yet you're part of that family tree
[2:39:15] yet you you've had a paradox a
[2:39:18] miracle that breed out the genes and
[2:39:21] changed you into a new creature and you
[2:39:24] are no longer of the old creation but
[2:39:26] you're of a new creation you're a brand
[2:39:29] new
[2:39:31] species and guess what though that you
[2:39:34] inherited all of these bad traits amen
[2:39:38] now they're all cancelled out through
[2:39:40] the blood of Jesus Christ and now you
[2:39:43] have the nature of your father
[2:39:47] which is God's
[2:39:49] nature Hallelujah that's why you get
[2:39:52] overcome when your siblings could not
[2:39:55] overcome but yet you get overcome why
[2:39:58] because a
[2:39:59] miracle a
[2:40:01] paradx took place in you of the baptism
[2:40:04] of the Holy Ghost that bred out all the
[2:40:07] [Applause]
[2:40:08] C amen you got family members that can't
[2:40:11] believe they can't repent they would
[2:40:13] keep doing all of this they drink and
[2:40:15] they they dope and they ever adultere
[2:40:18] but you're different why a miracle took
[2:40:21] place a birth took place a miracle of a
[2:40:25] birth and you're a new creature a new
[2:40:27] species and they look at you and say why
[2:40:29] don't you like
[2:40:32] us and you can't be like them that's cuz
[2:40:36] you've been
[2:40:38] changed something made you tender and
[2:40:41] sweet it's not your it's not your Chans
[2:40:44] from your old your first birth is Christ
[2:40:47] that lives in you so you're no more what
[2:40:50] you are is Christ in
[2:40:53] you so the father raises up said but
[2:40:55] brother Brandon my son went to the
[2:41:00] altar he was baptized correctly in the
[2:41:03] name of Jesus Christ water baptism in
[2:41:05] the pool I know my son has come to
[2:41:08] Christ see he's done all the outward
[2:41:11] things I said that might be all right
[2:41:14] all the outward emotions motions he
[2:41:17] might be identified as a Believer with
[2:41:20] the Believers but until he's
[2:41:22] regenerated born again I'd advise that
[2:41:26] young man to never marry a woman because
[2:41:29] he'll make hell on Earth for her until
[2:41:33] that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of
[2:41:35] Christ comes
[2:41:36] in then it will be a paradox himself to
[2:41:39] take that very nature of a boy that's
[2:41:41] spread between father and mother and yet
[2:41:43] in his intellectuals he's doing trying
[2:41:45] his best to overcome it and he can't do
[2:41:48] it he will never overcome it Christ will
[2:41:50] have to overcome it and when he lets
[2:41:52] Christ in then he's already overcome
[2:41:55] then it'll be a perfect Paradox when a
[2:41:57] man is born of the spirit of
[2:42:01] God that's what we're looking for that's
[2:42:05] what you want that's what you want you
[2:42:07] want to apply the token the life of
[2:42:11] Jesus Christ and it take out and breathe
[2:42:14] out by the new birth give you a whole
[2:42:17] new
[2:42:18] genealogy now we don't look
[2:42:21] back to what our mother did and our
[2:42:24] father did and what our grandfather did
[2:42:26] I don't care you might have been
[2:42:28] illegitimate born your father never
[2:42:30] claims you or you never knew him it
[2:42:32] doesn't really matter what kind of birth
[2:42:34] situation you had amen you are now a new
[2:42:37] creature in Christ Jesus that has bred
[2:42:39] out all the call and you got an abstract
[2:42:42] all the way back to calary that your
[2:42:44] debt is paid in for and you are a son
[2:42:46] and daughter of God act more than a
[2:42:49] comfort through the blood of Jesus
[2:42:52] Christ let's stand together let the
[2:42:54] musicians come praise the
[2:42:57] Lord amen thank you
[2:43:02] Lord thank you Lord aren't you glad I'm
[2:43:07] so glad that God bred all the pr and
[2:43:10] Middleton out of
[2:43:12] me I'm so glad he took that old nature
[2:43:16] wash it in the sea of
[2:43:18] forgetfulness gave me a nature like
[2:43:22] his oh you say well I can't help but be
[2:43:25] that way that's right until you're born
[2:43:26] again you can't that's right and then
[2:43:28] once you're born again you can't help
[2:43:30] but be a
[2:43:32] Christian that's who you
[2:43:36] are why don't you just ask God this
[2:43:39] morning
[2:43:42] Lord I might have been born this or that
[2:43:46] I might be Italian or German or I might
[2:43:50] be African or Asian or whatever you
[2:43:55] are but
[2:43:59] Lord I
[2:44:01] know I would surrender the old di to yet
[2:44:06] and be born a
[2:44:07] new Let The Life of Christ live out in
[2:44:11] me I want to don't want just outward
[2:44:14] emotions I want to
[2:44:16] know that day you shall know that I'm in
[2:44:19] the father I in you and you in me you
[2:44:22] can
[2:44:23] know say Lord I I want that Blessed
[2:44:29] Assurance let the death angel pass
[2:44:31] father take these words
[2:44:34] today as we sing a couple of songs and
[2:44:37] then we'll go into communion and foot
[2:44:41] washing Lord I pray that you'll bless
[2:44:43] your people today
[2:44:46] they've sat as I've
[2:44:47] labored as I've tried to break it down
[2:44:50] as simply as I know
[2:44:54] how I know there will be some that sit
[2:44:57] here
[2:44:58] maybe they've been Christians a long
[2:45:00] time born again well I didn't even need
[2:45:02] a sermon like
[2:45:03] this but somebody had to listen to that
[2:45:07] while they got
[2:45:09] saved Lord the most important thing that
[2:45:13] we can do as a church is give birth
[2:45:16] to the word of
[2:45:17] God to see sons and go daughters born
[2:45:21] that should be our life our
[2:45:24] desire as a church to be impregnated
[2:45:27] with the life of God and bring forth
[2:45:29] children I ask you'll bless us today in
