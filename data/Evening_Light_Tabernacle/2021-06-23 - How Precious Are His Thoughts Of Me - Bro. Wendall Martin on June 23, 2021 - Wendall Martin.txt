hast beset me behind and before and lay thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain to it whither thou whether shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there if i take the wings of the morning and behold and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea if there even there thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if i shall say surely darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day and the darkness as the light are both alike unto thee i'd like to go on down to the 17th verse how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of

doctor's reports and and we see things and amen we we're seeing this you know the uh the critical race theories point of view of who you are and amen the democrats have their view of who you are and the republicans have a view of who you are and amen religion has a view of who you are the catholic church has a view of who you are amen but i i want to say tonight god's got an opinion of you too amen and god's word is greater than anything the scripture says let every man's word be a lie but let mine be the truth and the believer has got to stand upon the unadulterated word of god and say i believe what god says amen because it is god's thoughts can you say amen amen what what does god think of me tonight in the midst of all of the sickness and in the midst of of the insanity what is his thoughts of me amen when i'm sick and the doctor doesn't really have an answer i say god is still saying tonight by my stripes you were healed amen there's so much unbelief in the land but friend amen nothing has ever caught god off guard there is nothing in your situation there is nothing in this generation there is nothing in our politics that has caught god off guard god is still god god knows what's happening well praise the name of the lord amen god knew it was going it was coming and i i want to say if god permitted it then god can still fight her battles tonight amen i i i believe god is still working in the supernatural realm how many believes god is still working in the supernatural realm amen he's still working in the in in that realm where the impossible where amen where it seems like there's no hope where there seems like amen there's there's no way to get around the mountain but you're serving a god amen who is still able to do all things and he does all things good amen that's the kind of god that is among us i think sometimes there's too much fear among us there's too much amen too too many in in in our land you know amen fear but there i want to talk about it's right here in the church tonight it may be called too many times there's amen there's too many of us walking in fear and we're scared we don't know what tomorrow's going to hold we don't know amen what well you know what the next day is going to hold we're looking at situations in our life and if you ever come down of those heavenly rims into this earthly sphere you'll be defeated every time amen but brother we're not looking at at this here we're looking at what god thinks of us amen and if god's put your name in the lamb's book of life then there's got to be somebody here on the earth that is going to reflect what is in that book there's going to be somebody here on the earth that's going to stand as pillars of the truth as pillars of the faith who is going to stand for righteousness and truth in the midst of adversity can you say man amen today it seems like amen it's a cop out we we we we call it humility to to walk in defeat and amen we we call it humility well whatever the lord wants for me is you know you know he knows what i need and i i don't want to ask too much or i don't want to be too pushy i don't want to be too bossy amen you know some sometimes our prayers we're we're praying unbelief god if you would just please somehow come on the scene or if the angel could could just stop by and and you know what and give me a little crumb amen i want to tell you tonight there's got to be a people that'll stand upon thus saith the lord and claim their inheritance can you see man amen we live and we don't god's not calling us to live in unbelief well praise the lord god's not wanting you to say amen right there and unbelief god's now wanting you to a man to barely get by but god's given you a position that position is not an earthly position it's not whether you hey man or you know well if you're an executive it's not whether you're the mayor it's not whether you're the president of a company amen but what matters is your position in the heavens oh can you say amen amen when the when the disciples came back and they were rejoicing amen because they had cast out some devils amen jesus said don't rejoice in this but rejoice because you have a position before the father well praise the lord i say here tonight we've got a people that amen that are full of that has got a position in the heavenlies well can you say amen hallelujah

keep on standing well can you say man amen let the holy spirit place it in her heart amen there in the scripture there in psalms 119 and 105 it says thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path amen there in 119 and 11 thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sit against thee amen i'm not going to hear any other voices i'm going to keep the saith the lord hallelujah i'm talking to you here and even tonight tabernacle we're not listening to no other voices we are standing on thus saith the lord oh my that's what he that's what hetty wright was standing on amen that's what your elijah was standing on that's what your pastor's standing on that's what you're standing on it is thus saith the lord amen now brother branham says now the pentecostal has a lot of faith but don't know their position but the bride has been given a position amen won't you turn to your neighbor and say you've got a position hallelujah amen you're the queen of heaven well praise the lord you're the queen of heaven amen you're married to jesus christ hallelujah amen the apostle paul says here in ephesians 1 and 17 it says that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being light that you may know somebody say that you may know what is the hope of his calling what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe according to the working of his mighty power amen which he brought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places he went far above principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to his pride oh it's a position brother hallel can you say amen hallelujah i may be poor amen my daddy may be poor my grandpa may be poor amen but god has seen me and he has he has precious thoughts concerning me oh glory to god i said glory to god the opening of the book released faith to the bride amen the opening of the book why amen god it couldn't be in any other age now it can only be in this age amen to where the promises of god could come off of the pages and an elect could stand there with that powerful word another random says heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall never fall open the door of faith jesus went on the earth he he knew that that scripture pertained to him when he said destroy this body and i'll raise it up in three days the prophet has already said i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption neither will i leave my soul in hell he knew the scripture pertaining to him for he was the messiah he knew it and his unfailing faith put him in position to know that he was the perfect son of god and then he turns to you and he says and if your faith will put you in position to know that every divine promise of god's bible is for you just as sure as that pertain to him every promise pertains to you somebody say i'll take it your healing the salvation your freedom from sin your selfishness your your indifference your little turtle shell that you pull yourself into christ comes in to be lord and ruler and to set you free from those things did you notice he picked everything that would hold you down here on earth oh what's his thoughts his thoughts does not just amen for us to sit in a pew amen and hear and learn a few quotes amen but you know what god knew that this day was coming god knew the enemy was going to come in but he says i'm going to raise up a standard hallelujah when it's coming in the darkness when unbelief is the greatest i'm going to send a prophet with thus saith the lord he's going to open a book i'm going to raise up us well hallelujah i'm going to raise up a standard when cancer is that it's strongest there will be a people when the enemy is coming in like a flood there's going to be somebody can i hear a somebody is there going to be somebody that says god's thoughts to me are precious [Applause] how precious are your thoughts unto me if you knew me if you the great one knew me and if those thoughts are precious to you then those thoughts are precious to me oh hallelujah what can you say man i said the pride's identity has never been more clear than what it is today i said beyonce well y'all with me here tonight the unsealed book has taken the cover off of you and god has openly declared who you are you are not mrs pentecost you are not mrs baptist you are not mrs presbyterian you're not a sinner you're not a slave amen but you are the virtuous sinless blood of jesus christ she's all glorious the prophet says that the bride of christ is as pure as jesus christ himself is amen the prophet says another place her righteousness is his righteousness amen other place he says her attributes are his glorious attributes her identity is found in him there is no fault found in her her possession is with christ oh if he's reigning over all things then you're reigning over all things if he's if he has overcome so have you you say brother wendell i i've been a battle of my life amen i just want you to know he has overcome and so have you i'm fighting a cancer the doctor's given me up he has overcome and so have you ah come on now amen don't you sit there in those pews and just be happy to hear from brother tim amen while he's a preacher pull out that sword hallelujah i am a warrior can you say man [Applause] amen what is it your identity has been swallowed up by the word prophet says what she has what he has she is to manifest on the earth she has become a reflection of jesus christ now i know the devil's been fighting your pastor's wife your sister karen amen been fighting a battle a lot of you might think well man if my pastor was spiritual and his wife was spiritual there wouldn't be anything happening no it's just quite the contrary satan wants to take out good warriors hallelujah amen brother branham i mean was brother branham exempt from trial was he exempt was god easy on william branham but brother branham had a position not of a prophet i mean he was a prophet but he had a position as a son of god to stand toe to toe with the enemy what can you say man i mean there his wife had all amen their tumor are growing and are growing and growing amen doctor after doctor they prayed and they prayed and it didn't seem like it was heaven but you know what they were doing that was a prophet and his wife amen that had that sword out amen he wasn't just preaching a make-believe gospel amen brother branham had to live by the same gospel that he preached by what can you say math and so do the men of god when you've got a pastor and a pastor's wife that's got their swords out in the midst of adversity and they're saying god we'll be faithful hallelujah can you say man amen been staying within the last couple days and there is no gloom or defeat in that house amen it's a house a triumphant it's a house of god you have promise and we claim every promise [Applause] how precious how precious in those night seasons how precious in those times when all hell is breaking loose there's a comfort how precious because i've been lifted up i'm no longer living here oh you see me in this body and i'm looking at you but i don't live here i live in those heaven who can you say man oh yes amen oh the enemy's there the enemy's there and i cannot defeat the enemy with this flesh [Applause] but god's given me a new birth and he's given me an open book and there shall no weapon formed against me prosper hallelujah what can you say man you've got to see what god sees come on now turn to your neighbor and say you've got to start looking at what god's looking at amen come on when god says there's no fault found in you then there's no fault found in you well praise the lord brother random says from the beginning to the ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for god has spoken can you say man you see sarah had to identify herself with the promise she went a long time identifying herself with barrenness she went for years but that did not change the mind of god brother wendell it's awfully embarrassing i i've been waiting for a long time and i've been claiming what's embarrassing about that that's showing your true colors more than it's ever shown because faith is patient faith don't care how long it's going to take faith is not looking at a calendar or a watch faith looks at the word and the word is only in the eternals the word is not subject to time place and material the word is he amen in the eternals above time above amen all of the pain that you're going through and the word is what you're standing on in those heavenly places brother branham says knowing who he was without a shadow of doubt he knew he was the son of god he knew it for the word identified it amen the word of god identified who he was he said i if i do not the works of my father then then don't believe me if i don't do them works don't believe me but if i do the works if but but then if i do then believe the works for they are the manifested word uh promised oh if i could just wake you up to that a minute you see the word itself identified him who is now the prophet's trying to tell us something the word itself was identifying him for who he was are you with me he says he turned around and said the works that i do shall you do also a little while in the world sees me no more yet you shall because i'll be with you even in you take no thought of what you shall say amen for it is not you that speak it it's my father that dwelleth in you on down he says now the identification of a scripture christian these words said jesus these signs shall follow them that believe how many believers do we have in the building oh isn't it good to have him be a believer well come on how would you like to be out there in one of those nominal churches i'm having to prepare to take off to the streets and riot and all this kind of stuff to stand up for your rights our rights have already been won jesus won our rights we have a hallelujah all right he says now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words how can you call yourself a believer in an idea of this word you can't do it you're not a believer therefore signs can't follow because you just accept what you want to believe and then the rest of it well you don't believe it you've got to take the whole thing and believe it and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs shall follow them that believe whole could you compare a christian today with them christians long ago how their disciples walked in the spirit the power of the spirit moved by the holy ghost amen to do it just a prisoner as i preached the other night a prisoner to the word and the will of god wouldn't you like to see a church rise up like that it's going to it's going back it's got to come that was your chance that was your cue to jump the aisles and start shouting it's a promise to the believer oh what was the very first law of god faith faith god had to believe his own word faith could see it out there before it was there faith could speak it believe it and go rest amen knowing that it was coming faith wasn't making it come nor faith stood course because god's word had already spoken it what can you say man hallelujah oh glory i just want to i want to hit you hard here right now did you know that you're the very genetics of god hallelujah amen you're not a mixture of creed and dogma and and and denominations and teachings you are the germ seed word of god brother says when a baby is conceived in the womb of a mother when that one cell goes in there and another cell builds on top of that it's not one cell of a human the next of a dog and the next have a cat and the next if it's something else it's absolutely straightly human being and when a man is born of the spirit of god he don't inject anything into his life it's the unadulterated word of god vindicated for that hour he takes that full word of god he don't put no creeds nothing else to it it's purely unadulterated it is god's word made manifest among us now jesus said father keep them now he didn't say take the evil away he didn't say i'm going to keep them i'm going to take them out of this evil world he says father they're going out into the world but i've given them your word and as they use that word you're going to honor that word in their lives oh hallelujah yeah he could you know i'm a daddy and and i would love to shelter my boys bring them over and and keep them you know away from from from all of the hurts but you see what good would that be when they turn eighteen to eight sure ain't gonna stay at my house till they're 50 years old they won't put up with that so what am i going to do i'm going to equip my boys when they're young i'm going to start equipping them i'm going to start training well praise the lord you know why because they're fixing to go out in that real world out there and they're going to have to know how to work they're going to have to know how to treat a wife they're going to know how they've got to know how to do these kinds of things what can you say amen and god did not take us he did not save you and take you and keep you from the evil he didn't take you from the world matters of fact it's still in your community it's still in your job it's still at your school these things are there but there's one thing he has promised i've given them thy word [Applause] can you say amen only the allah can stand upon that unadulterated word of god i heard someone say the other day well after all we're all just whosoever wills and i had to differ how can the bride be a whosoever will you know there's no destiny in whosoever will hallelujah it's a wednesday night you're not expecting too much anyways yes it's the mercies of god to the whosoevers yes god meant it when he said it yes there's going to be many whosoever wills in in that in the kingdom of that but brother there's no faith in whosoever will there's no faith oh come on now that's why god had to send they say prophet in this day do i i'm not going to call you church so that you will understand what these seals are about i'm going to call you pride oh glory to god can you say amen you know whosoever will he may be there and he may not be there who swept there's going to be plenty given eternal life we'll praise the lord but the fact is he's not a gene seed of god hallelujah but i want to tell you right now there in acts 13 and 48 when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of god and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed as many as were ordained to eternal life that means somebody's got their names written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world there should be some shouting going on [Applause] [Music] can you say amen yes so you are the lord's masterpiece amen the bride is the very elect of god there's no whosoever's to it at all amen you were in god from old times he knew your name he knew your hair color he knew your personality god knew you the elect is the masterpiece that god has designed and created well praise the lord well that makes me want to shout brother adam puts it like this he says how did god make the earth he spoke it you see it he spake and the world come into existence this world this morning is the spoken word of god he believed his own word amen here it is he says watch it and if god and you're an offspring of him and god is in you he will believe his own word though it can't be seen felt taste or anything else he'll believe it for you see what i mean for god in you will believe his own word i said the believer refuses somebody say i refuse to accept anything except god's word you say amen amen the apostle paul says i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision brother branham looking at the at at the few there at the last me and you amen in that in that vision of the bride that was going up into the heavens and they began to look this way and begin to look that way but the prophet's voice came back and says get back in line keep that vision before you oh hallelujah brother ryan says they have but one thing to do they had the one thing to do that stay straight on the course not wander off over here and wander off over there but stay on the course the church has got but one thing to do stay on the course they have the pillar of fire that they had to keep them in the course amen by uh follow the pillar of fire that's what led them their objective they could see was the pillar of fire they seen it working through moses they know that he was the leader today we've got the word we follow the word and we see the word working in the believers we know it so that god working with us confirming the word with signs following stay with the word for the word produces the results now brother branham talks about the snake and the bird now the bird is one that is meant for the heavens and his wings are far more powerful than anything of of of earthbound creatures but the snake can lure a bird down from the sky hallelujah brother branham says he says i'm told a snake can catch the eye of the burden charm the bird with his enchantments and the snare of its eyes until such a way if that bird will give this the snake its attention for just a few moments the bird will flutter and completely become paralyzed and the snake will take the bird i can believe that because that i know of another serpent the devil that if he could ever catch the eye with his enchantments with your modern rock and roll and all of your faint angles of the world if he can ever catch you young lady or young man just long enough to get his charm in you you'll flutter but you can't get loose he will hold you until he swallows you up in sin the only way i'm told that the little bird can ever have have a chance is to get his eyes off of the serpent he cannot look at anything else because he stands staring but if he will take his eyes from the serpent and look upward and flutter his wings he will fly plum out of the reach of the snake oh come on now amen uh i'm going to turn fox news off for a little bit i'm going to turn cnn off for a little i'm going i'm going to tone the doctor down a little bit i have got one thing i'm looking at i'm not coming out of these heavenly places can you say man i'm destined for this great victory he says if you could ever got the charm of the world and the things of the world and unbelief charming in your heart tells you oh live modern shake your head tonight look up to the unseen the lord jesus and flutter your wings of prayer until you fly plum out of his reach out of his clutches if he could speak to you that divine healing is wrong shake your head from him quickly if he'll tell you the spiritual discernment is telepathy shake your head from him immediately and look up to the unseen can you say amen now i'm going to i'm going to start my descent hallelujah god cannot lie now the scripture says that god was going to send strong delusion to the to the laodicea church hallelujah strong delusion that they would believe a lie and be damned by that lie but yet he has looked to his church i i read a scripture earlier today and i i thought it was good they're in in in psalms 180 or psalms 89 and 33 he says nevertheless my loving kindness will i not utterly take from him nor suffer my faith my faithfulness to fail my lips will i not break or my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that has gone out of my lips once i have sworn by my holiness that i will not lie that i will not lie somebody say it with me that i will not lie unto david deception is in the land but the church still has an absolute amen well glory to god can you say amen hallelujah i was listening to this testimony last night about uh about the boy that that didn't have much of an ear and and he had and the lord healed him here in your congregation is he here tonight oh there he is wow my goodness good-looking fella right there and how the mama gave her heart to the lord had such a faith she just walks back there and she's going to pray for her son and he's going to get healed well praise the lord now how many how how long were you serving how long was this girl serving the lord before she prayed that prayer how long were you serving the lord before then get you no brownie points with god i mean that's pretty rain can't it couldn't even stay in church it comes against your heart the lord and then it just goes right straight back over there and starts believing the lord to heal her son and the lord honors that prayer oh some of us that's our problem we've been in church for 35 years and we have never missed a service and we've paid our tithes and we've done everything so perfectly and so god has got to unknow god only honors faith now i'm not putting aside all of your faithfulness but if you're depending on your faithfulness and not in faith in his word i told you all that time amen when this girl came up you know she was they were living on the streets and and they they came for your dedication service i had them to stand up but but you uh uh you know they they uh i mean they were as vile as val can be and and uh stephanie and joe they they were they were drug abusers uh the girl had been doing uh uh i forgot the heroine she they were heroin addicts for many many years she was an atheist they called and and um and and and they were living in florida and and they had heard about us and they said is there a way we can come and i didn't want them to come you know i mean hallelujah they were they were drug addicts and they were drug addicts a long time and matters of fact i knew i knew of the situation that she had been up she had been in in the hospital for a couple months with with her liver and they would not even give her a transplant because she was a or put her on the list for a transplant because she was a she she was a heroin addict and she would get in she'd go back out she'd get in she'd go back out then and so well here she comes uh i mean she never did serve the lord but she would she she would she would you know take the the 30-day step 60 day steps whatever and uh so you know here they come and and oh she was a potty mouth smoking cigarette and i mean they were as thin as thin could be their veins i mean they were just they they they were a mess amen and so um you know i was trying to find a place for them to stay and i i ended up letting them stay at our house they just slept on our living room there on the floor got him a little you know some bedding there and and and that's where they lived they stayed there in in in our in our home and uh and so uh you know she she said i'll never don't expect me to wear your skirts and don't you expect me to and i mean she was you know what i'm saying listen you put up with me and i'll put up with you hallelujah amen you enter my house don't be smoking in it and you're going to church with me and cover up so and so we uh we got that saddled up and so amen the lord began to deal with her she comes over and talks to me when i was working one day and she says she says sir i don't i don't even know what to say she said uh you know i i i what is god about and i began to tell him about the power of god tell her about the power of god long story short she gave her heart to the lord got baptized and i'm and i'm here to tell you that's been four years ago and they are they are pillars i mean what god's done for them is an incredible thing incredible incredible but she gave her heart to the lord and she still had a bad liver and and she she says now i don't i don't understand what we do about this or what what we do you say god's so powerful so she says so do i pray about this or do i what what do i do about this and so i said well you just tell the lord i i i want one healing and i i i'm needing a new liver and she says well that's easy enough so she leaves and apparently she goes and talks to the lord and and uh she doesn't mention anything else to me about it and so amen they go they they she she goes uh in a couple weeks and uh to to the doctor now this girl had been she can't even hardly eat lettuce i mean she couldn't eat nothing it was just it was so messed up and uh she went to the doctor they went in done that done the x-rays the mris and all of this and they came back and said your liver is brand new this girl was so raised on i mean her for her 14th birthday she was given a kilo of whatever drugs that was white boy she didn't even know who daniel and the lion's den was she had never been to church she's had abortion several times this girl but when she came in she accepted what i said we baptized her god filled her with a holy ghost she was immediately in a candidate to pick up a sword and start fighting the devil how precious how precious how precious are thy thoughts and to me let me see the way you see can somebody say how precious how precious are your thoughts [Applause] you didn't ask for this you could have never done this in your own and you'll never be able to do it on your own just believe what your father says about you can you say man you can be seated for just a minute i'm closing my mother y'all been praying with us for my mother and her platelets and they told her she had some kind of a blood disease and it would be incurable that there was no way that it was something she's going to live with medication and my mother is just a little little lady but she's a lady of faith i remember just before she moved to oklahoma a couple years ago she her her thyroid and the glands it swelled up so bad and it was would it would choke her a little bit and it would scare her and uh she had you know but it was it was it was a big thing and she just kept on claiming god's my healer went away we need to take you in no god's got this and so she had moved to pawnee and then and i came over to her house the here a while back and and she took the picture a picture of herself that they had taken just before she had left pawnee or arizona and she brought up she says do you notice anything different and and i i i said well different dress on you know she said look close and i looked and mama's that that big old swollen whatever was there on her uh thyroid was absolutely gone now mama was going to believe god and so it was whether her platelets her platelets are supposed to be around the 300 mark he man her blood platelets you can't live without platelets if you ain't got platelets your your water your blood's just like water yeah and she had her platelets were all the way down to a seven five a down to a five and she had she had blood she had bloody noses she had blood in her stools uh mom was mom was she it looked pretty pretty rough they were giving her medications trying to keep her alive every time they tried to give her something come back the next day the next week she was coming in once a week and then coming in and and they would be back down again so then she started having to come in three times a week and they were giving her all kinds of medications they were giving her infusions um uh blood blood transfusions and then iron infusions and giving her uh this that whatever all this other stuff is her medication every every shot she would get she had to get that once a week too on top of her oral medicine he met 25 000 per shot she was getting these things here she's once now she's and she went for like seven months and and and and there were times that my mother would she'd say wendell i i don't quite understand i've always believed god and i've been standing upon the promise of god and wendell is there any sin in my life is there i mean the devil's beating her up and i remember sitting down and just the holy spirit began to get begin to speak to her and i watched the watch how the enemy just just the shackles began to come off as the anointing of the lord was there for mama that day and and i told her i said you're fighting a battle mom you're fighting a battle this this is nothing this has nothing to do between you and god if there is something repent of it but if if if god's not bringing anything up before your heart then then quit worrying about it this is a battle keep the sword in your hand [Applause] she would just come and he would come and go come and go and and there was a lot of gloomy times for mama we had that youth camp and and uh brother brother joe and brother brother timothy was there brother andrew glover we all gathered around ministers all gathered around and prayed for mama she went back the next day monday that that uh that next the following monday that the meeting ended on a sunday we went back to the doctor on monday and her platelets were y'all ready for this up there close to 500 500 and something 000. and the doctor's sitting there going whoa whoa whoa supposed to be around the 300 000 and we're talking about five hundred thousand that it was that's where it was at so he said well now now let's not get too let's let's not get too happy here something's going on he said the medicine's finally working this is good this is good so let's take a little bit of this medicine out and come back and man it was still way up there he goes oh boy well let's spill before you know what he said we're just going to take you off of every one of those medications my mother just went back uh last week and her platelets are high and there is no medication her platelets are taking care of themselves was it a fight yes it's a fight but you've got to choose to believe the word of the lord god's word will win it must you're anointed for this hour it must satan's fighting our ministers satan's fighting these ministers wives pray for your pastor pray for your pastor's wife pray diligently for brother brother ron and even before it was brother ron i mean satan was attacking sister connie satan attacked sister connie and i mean listen we almost lost her sister joy jackson look at these women satan is fighting the women of these ministers but we ain't the kind that lay down we ain't the kind that's going to turn tell and run and say well maybe god didn't maybe god can't keep his word after all god keeps his promises well it was in that deal there when we took her back when we took mom back right after the right right after the meet at the youth meeting they found cancer found cancer in her stomach and it get it you know mom just said god healed me of these platelets god's gonna take care of these i promise you that i want you to know doctor says you're gonna have to cut part of that stomach out there's no if ands or butts about it you're gonna have to have chemo before or you may have to have chemo before but you're going to definitely have to have it afterwards i mean the doctors all of these doctors that all come into agreement this is where it's going to be my mom and i and i'm here to tell them my mom was saying no we ain't doing the surgery and i said we are going to do the surgery i mean you know in a moment now listen here we're going to go in there amen i i you're going to look funny with half your stomach gone but that was a joke amen but so it was the intestines boys i wasn't going to cut this part out there you know so she said no i i don't want to have it and i said to mama if this is what the doctor's recommending and if the lord doesn't heal you then we've got to do this she said oh the lord's going to heal me i just want you to know it's been two months ago three months ago two or three months ago that the doctors all they've done they've done another scan went in there with one of those ones there's only one of them in oklahoma that that knows how to do these kind of scans went back in there they came out and said there is no cancer there's no need for surgery there's no need for chemo there's no need for radiation all of those doctors had got together he says we've all got together it was it took him 40. he was 45 minutes late getting getting into the into the room with us and and that wasn't that's that's not like him he said i'm sorry but i had to go and visit with all of the i had to go visit with all of these other doctors i mean he had they had a team there and we've all come to the conclusion she is cancer free hallelujah do you believe god's a miracle-working god it don't matter how long it takes it doesn't matter hallelujah what does he think of me [Applause] i'm not saying that the battle don't get heavy i i'm not saying that you don't believe that you don't get bruised you i'm not saying that that you have to fight to keep a good spirit that you have to fight to keep your head what can you say man but i i just want to tell you god god's got a a bride on the earth that ain't going to turn tell and run amen can you say amen you know david and his men had went out warring and they came back from victory and when they came back they found ziggler burned and all of his 600 warriors all these none of these men all came in looking forward to seeing their families looking forward to seeing their wives and children receive the affection from them when they arrive their cities burn their wife and their children all the life's belongings are gone smoke still rising for the from the smolders and the scripture says that david's warriors turned on david and they were ready to stone david that's right come on and and what did what what you know sometimes we talk about the dedication of david's mighty men this this this was a this was a bad that was this was a bad deal going on in the church they have the stones in the hands the grief was so great they were ready to stone him to death but what did the scripture say david refused to come out of the heavenly places and that's what i admire about great generals who refuse to come out of those heavenly places when the battle gets strong and heavy that's when your pastor gets that's that's that's when the true colors begin to shine but that's that's that's the true colors is when a general and they're they're getting attacked and the enemy's hitting hard and you see a brother tim prutz standing up saying god is faithful and i'm not just going to say god's faithful i'm going to turn up my preaching on god is faithful when you when you see a ron spencer fighting every day for his life but he's standing there saying god is faithful [Applause] come on now when you see these men in the message if this thing was a fake and a frowny amen it would be exposed in these times where the supernatural has got to take place but brother this church knows too much we we know very much should i say that the supernatural is with this message [Applause] and david began to encourage himself in the lord what did he do he began to create another world i'm not going to look at this thing around me what can you say man hallelujah amen i want to just read a little bit to you but as a as as we get ready as i close there in first samuel 30 and one then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voices and wept until they could weep no more had no more power to weep david's two wives were taken captive captain amen sixth verse and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning and the because the soul of the people was grieved and every man of for his sons and for his daughters and david encouraged himself in the lord his god and david said and the ether the the priest uh himilla ex uh son i pray thee bring me the ephod and happy i third brought hither the ephod to dave and david inquired at the lord saying shall i pursue this troop shall i overtake him and he answered pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all but now there was only 400 who had the strength to go out and cover recover there were 200 that were weary they were tired and and the bible says that they were faint they said the 200 of old behind which were so faint that they could not go over the brook but the scripture says hallelujah the scripture says that when they were going after them are y'all still with me give me another five minutes they were gone after the enemy they're in samuel 30 and 11 and i'm just going to read it to you it's a good it's a good read and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to david and gave him bread and he did eat made him drink water and they gave him a piece of cake of fix now they found this man out on their way to to pursue after the enemy they gave him a figs cake of figs and cluster of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came to him again and he for he had eaten no bread or drunk any water three days and three nights and david said unto him to whom belongs thou and when's heart thou and he said i'm a young man of egypt servant i'm an amalekite my master left me three because three days ago i felt sick and he made him and we made an invasion of the south of the cherothites and the coast that belongs to judah and the south of caleb and we burned ziglag with fire and david said can you bring me to this company and he says swear unto me by god that thou will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and i'll bring thee down the enemy ain't getting the enemy yeah they ain't got no time for you they'll just kick you off to the side can you say amen 17th verse and david and they well the 16th verse and when it brought them down behold they were spread or abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing and because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines and out of the land of judah and david smote them from twilight even until the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them saved 400 young men which rolled upon camels and fled and david recovered all somebody say oh that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two wives and there was nothing lacking to them neither small or great neither sons nor daughters neither spoiled nor anything they had taken to them david recovered all and david took all the flocks and the herds and they drave them before the cut the other cattle this is david's spoil and david come to the 200 men which were so faint that they could not follow david whom they had made also to abide at the brook bazaar and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people that were with them and when david came near the people he saluted them hallelujah and he answered all you he and then answered all the wicked men and the men of belial and those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart then david then said david you shall not do so my brethren with that which the lord hath given us who have preserved us and delivered the company that came from us against us in our hand for who will hearken unto you in this manner but he as his part is that goeth to the battle so is his part that carrieth by the stuff and they shall part alike and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day now this was a time you say now what does this have to do with your message these were warriors that were tired and there might be somebody feeling like brother wendell i i i've been fighting a long battle i i i'm weary and i'm
