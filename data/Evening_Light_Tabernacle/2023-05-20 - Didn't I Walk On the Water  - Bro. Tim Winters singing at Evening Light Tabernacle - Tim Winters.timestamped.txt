[0:43] at how far you come
[0:47] and every time you've asked me
[0:50] didn't I deliver you
[0:54] why would you be thinking
[0:56] think that I wouldn't see you through
[0:59] Didn't I Walk On The Water I calm the
[1:05] rage and seams I spoke to the way in the
[1:11] house and I gave you peace didn't I run
[1:15] to your rescue didn't I
[1:19] [Music]
[1:27] leave all of Heaven There I died for you
[1:33] I searched until I found you and
[1:37] I'll do it all again
[1:42] now you're talking to the father
[1:46] as you kneel down on the floor
[1:50] Trials of this life Lord they've taken
[1:54] away my joy but then a voice so still
[1:58] and low
[2:00] said I moved on you before
[2:03] if only you'd surrender I would give you
[2:08] so much more Didn't I Walk on the waters
[2:13] I calm the Regency
[2:16] I spoke
[2:19] to the house
[2:23] [Music]
[2:29] [Music]
[2:36] didn't I leave all of Heaven
[2:40] there I died for your sins
[2:43] I searched until I found you and I'll do
[2:48] it all again
[2:52] I searched until I found you and I'll do
[2:57] it all again
[2:59] [Music]
[3:01] [Applause]
