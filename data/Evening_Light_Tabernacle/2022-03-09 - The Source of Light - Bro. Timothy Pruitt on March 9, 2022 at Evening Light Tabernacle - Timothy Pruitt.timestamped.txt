[47:09] than enough lord
[47:11] we commit this service to your hands
[47:12] everything to be said and done for your
[47:14] glory
[47:15] in jesus name
[47:17] amen
[47:20] amen turn to john first john 1 and verse
[47:22] 5
[47:24] amen read this scripture you can be
[47:26] seated
[47:33] first john 1 and verse 5.
[47:36] this then is the message
[47:38] which we have heard of him and declared
[47:41] unto you
[47:42] that god is light
[47:44] and in him
[47:45] is no darkness at all
[47:48] amen god bless you can be seated
[47:52] tonight i'd like to speak to you on the
[47:54] source
[47:55] of light
[47:56] the source of light source
[47:58] is a person placer thing this is a
[48:00] webster dictionary
[48:02] from which something comes from or can
[48:04] be obtained other words for source is
[48:07] origin
[48:08] birthplace
[48:10] arthurship wellspring pedigree root
[48:13] beginning
[48:14] origination or originator
[48:17] amen we find god in every one of those
[48:19] words
[48:21] amen that he is the origin of life
[48:24] he is the birthplace of life he authored
[48:27] it he's the wellspring
[48:28] amen he's the root he's the beginning
[48:31] he's the origination or the originator
[48:35] god is the source of light and all
[48:37] things exist by him we can read in
[48:40] romans 11 verse 36 it says for of him
[48:44] and through him and to him are all
[48:46] things to whom be glory forever a man or
[48:50] i'll read it in the amplified it says
[48:53] for from him all things originate
[48:56] and through him all things live and
[48:58] exist
[48:59] and to him are all things directed to
[49:03] him be glory and honor forever
[49:06] you know we all need sources in our
[49:08] lives that we can depend upon
[49:11] a source is a supplier of something that
[49:14] we cannot produce on our own
[49:17] for example you know in your home you
[49:19] want to be warm during the winter you
[49:20] need a source of heat
[49:22] the gas line coming into your house is
[49:25] one of your sources electric lines are
[49:27] another source
[49:28] but you know there's also financial
[49:30] sources and food sources and government
[49:33] sources and sources that are to make our
[49:36] lives easier or more enjoyable or more
[49:38] productive but those so as we have found
[49:41] out very recently and and very evidently
[49:44] that those sources are subject to
[49:46] shortages and interruptions and can be
[49:49] in a short supply
[49:51] but not so with god
[49:53] if god is our source he is never in
[49:56] short supply
[49:57] if god is our source he's the perfect
[49:59] and on-time source for everything that
[50:02] you have need of so as a source is
[50:05] something that provides something that
[50:07] you cannot provide on your own so we
[50:09] cannot provide on our own healing but he
[50:13] is our source of healing we cannot
[50:15] provide on our own salvation but he is
[50:17] our source of salvation we cannot
[50:20] provide on our own amen peace and
[50:23] happiness
[50:24] and men has tried it for years but amen
[50:26] he is the true source of peace and
[50:28] happiness he is the true source of joy
[50:32] and to receive from this source you have
[50:34] to be connected to the source
[50:37] amen jeremiah 17 and verse 7 again in
[50:40] the amplified says blessed is the man
[50:42] who believes and trusts in and relies in
[50:46] the lord and whose hope and confidence
[50:49] has has hope and confident expectation
[50:53] is the lord so if he had if he's if he's
[50:56] connected to him and he has hope in him
[50:58] and he trusts in him he says in verse 8
[51:01] for he will be nourished like a tree
[51:03] planted by the waters and spread out his
[51:06] roots by the river and will never fear
[51:08] the heat when it comes
[51:10] but its leaves will be green and moist
[51:13] and it will not be anxious and concerned
[51:15] in the year of drought neither shall it
[51:18] stop bearing fruit because why it is
[51:21] connected to the source so it doesn't
[51:23] matter the surroundings it doesn't it
[51:26] matters that you're connected to the
[51:27] source
[51:28] it does not matter that there's a severe
[51:31] heat or there's a drought of things in
[51:33] life but what matters is if you're
[51:35] connected to the source a man that is
[51:38] connected to the source will bear hit
[51:41] fruit no matter the drought no matter
[51:43] the heat no matter the trials no matter
[51:45] their tribulation no matter the trouble
[51:48] no matter the stress he will bear fruit
[51:50] why because he's connected to the source
[51:53] amen but if he's not connected to the
[51:55] source when trials come and the heat
[51:58] comes on he will rapidly dry up amen so
[52:01] you have to be connected to him but if
[52:04] you have a need of that you have a
[52:06] source for it so if you have a need of
[52:08] strength and you cannot produce the
[52:10] strength on your own there is a source
[52:12] of strength amen and he's not in short
[52:14] supply tonight amen there is a source of
[52:17] hope there is a source of love there and
[52:20] i'm not talking about a temporary thing
[52:22] i'm talking about an eternal thing amen
[52:24] there is a source of peace there is a
[52:27] source of provisions there is a source
[52:30] of healings there's a a source of
[52:32] deliverance but it you must be tapped
[52:35] into the source and be connected to the
[52:37] source or you will dry up
[52:40] amen you know we we can have
[52:42] light bulbs in here as we have maybe
[52:45] already spoke about these things and
[52:46] they can look like a light bulb they can
[52:48] they can be exactly you could have one
[52:51] you know there that what maybe not
[52:52] burning all of them are burning tonight
[52:54] except the one that's not in but amen
[52:56] the other end zone maybe there'd be one
[52:58] in your home that's not burning but it
[52:59] looks like a light bulb it has all the
[53:02] physical attributes of looking but but
[53:04] there's something wrong with it it's not
[53:06] giving light and so you go to checking
[53:08] it out and you'll find that
[53:10] sooner or later you'll find a break amen
[53:13] in the line from the source
[53:15] from the source of electricity and it
[53:17] may look like it he may it may have the
[53:19] attributes of it but if it says not
[53:22] connected to the source it'll never
[53:24] bring forth light i don't care how much
[53:26] you beg it i don't care how much you you
[53:28] look at it and plead with it hey man if
[53:31] you don't if it's a switch that needs to
[53:32] be flipped or if it's a wire that needs
[53:34] to be plugged in it has to be connected
[53:37] to the source or it will never give
[53:39] light
[53:41] amen this is what's wrong with a lot of
[53:43] christians they look like christians
[53:44] they have the attributes of christians
[53:46] they they may have the outward look down
[53:49] pat but amen they're not given the light
[53:51] of god's word god's word has never been
[53:54] made manifested in their lives and
[53:57] therefore the light is not shining as it
[54:00] should shine in their lives amen i want
[54:02] to look at a quote here because it's
[54:03] very wonderful brother branham talks
[54:05] about it he says you know you can have
[54:07] teeth and how many got teeth tonight i'm
[54:10] not going to ask how many got artificial
[54:11] teeth tonight but there's no doubt some
[54:13] in this building that's got an
[54:14] artificial tooth in their mouth or
[54:16] artificial teeth in their mouth amen and
[54:18] that artificial teeth it is not
[54:21] connected to the source of life no more
[54:23] amen you can have an arm that that gets
[54:26] cut off or a bad accident or something
[54:28] and you can get an artificial limb and
[54:30] it may work it may do things you may can
[54:32] put clothes over it you may can put a
[54:34] glove on the hand and it may look like
[54:36] it but it's not really connected to the
[54:38] source amen and he says see those teeth
[54:41] are just a substitute that arm is just a
[54:44] substitute and they will never come into
[54:47] the resurrection because they're not
[54:49] connected with you amen he says it's not
[54:53] connected with you it's perfectly all
[54:55] right but that's an artificial tooth
[54:57] that's an artificial arm nothing
[54:59] artificial will come up in the
[55:01] resurrection
[55:03] and he says neither will an artificial
[55:06] christian ever rise in the resurrection
[55:10] amen you're not connected with christ
[55:12] amen and maybe today you may have not an
[55:15] artificial arm but you might have
[55:17] artificial hair you might have
[55:18] artificial nails you might have
[55:20] artificial things upon you that you
[55:22] think makes you look more beautiful but
[55:24] nothing artificial is going to come up
[55:26] in the resurrection and if you continue
[55:29] to be artificial in your life neither
[55:31] will you come up in the resurrection but
[55:34] you must be connected to the source of
[55:37] life you must be connected to god
[55:39] himself and light coming out of your
[55:42] body and out of your life amen and be
[55:44] connected to him there to bring forth
[55:47] the life of almighty god amen so we see
[55:50] here amen you know you know but there
[55:53] has to be a a desire amen a light a
[55:56] pulsation a energizing force amen that
[56:00] is more than just a outward profession
[56:02] it's more than just talking about it
[56:05] it's more than just looking like it but
[56:07] there's something on the inside of you
[56:09] that that energizes you that that
[56:11] produces something amen you know but
[56:14] could you imagine as we go into this
[56:16] thought on light again the source of
[56:19] light could you imagine a man saying
[56:21] today i refuse to say there's anything
[56:24] such as a son
[56:25] i don't believe in the son
[56:27] amen could you imagine he runs down into
[56:29] his basement and shuts the doors and he
[56:32] sets back from the darkness and he says
[56:34] there's no such a thing as a sun it
[56:37] don't give light you know right away
[56:39] there's something mentally wrong with
[56:41] that man
[56:42] because you have witnessed there is a
[56:44] sun
[56:45] it's given light we witness it today
[56:47] amen once again it was a beautiful sight
[56:50] after a long rainy day amen the sun
[56:52] given this warmth and and the
[56:54] and the rays of that sun pushing down
[56:57] upon you amen you would look at that man
[56:59] and say you're crazy because i've
[57:01] witnessed it i i've seen it i felt it i
[57:04] i felt the warmth of its embraces in the
[57:07] morning i i felt the look as it would it
[57:10] so illuminate the world around me and
[57:13] the darkness would flee i know there's a
[57:15] sun because i've seen it i felt it i
[57:18] believe it i i know it's there it's no
[57:21] different than somebody that wants to
[57:22] come to you now and tell you that when
[57:24] you've experienced god for yourself that
[57:26] there's no god and they want to run off
[57:28] in a basement somewhere and act like
[57:30] there's no god and say there's no god
[57:33] but you have you can look at them and
[57:35] say you know what there's something
[57:36] mentally wrong with you there's
[57:38] something wrong on the inside of you
[57:40] because i know i have met him for myself
[57:43] i have felt his embrace i have felt the
[57:45] rays of his warmth around me i know
[57:48] there is a god and he has changed my
[57:51] life forever
[57:54] amen there's something wrong when he
[57:56] runs in the back basement and refuses to
[57:58] accept the benefits of god-given light
[58:05] and i can say this there's something
[58:07] wrong with people when the god-given
[58:09] light is preached and they won't accept
[58:11] the benefits of it
[58:14] they won't accept the life-changing
[58:16] benefits of the word of god and the
[58:19] light to dawn and push out the darkness
[58:22] in their life but they want to continue
[58:24] to live in that darkness
[58:25] you don't have to continue to live in
[58:27] darkness when there's light
[58:29] if you're living in darkness today is
[58:31] because you're mentally and stable
[58:35] you're spiritually unstable
[58:37] amen because right now there's there's
[58:39] if there's ever been never been
[58:42] i don't even know how to put this in
[58:43] words if there's never there's never
[58:45] been a more greater time amen to living
[58:49] life than the time that we're living in
[58:51] right now
[58:54] the dumbest excuse that can be given
[58:56] today is there is no light
[59:01] because the light has dawned amen he
[59:04] don't want the warm rays he rejects them
[59:07] he don't want the health-giving
[59:09] substance he rejects them he don't want
[59:11] his light to walk in it he would rather
[59:14] sit in darkness
[59:20] they don't want it
[59:22] they can be preached light can come
[59:23] forth and it can dawn it can illuminate
[59:26] people say i want it and run to an altar
[59:28] or grab a hold in their seats or
[59:30] wherever and others sit right beside
[59:32] them and refuse it and sit in darkness
[59:37] something spiritually wrong
[59:39] with that person there's something
[59:40] mentally wrong with that person that
[59:42] they refuse to accept the light of the
[59:44] sun there's something spiritually wrong
[59:46] with a man that'll run back to a creed
[59:48] or a dogma and refuse to see the bible
[59:51] light when it's shining right before
[59:53] them there's something wrong with them
[59:55] there's something that it goes back to
[59:57] the they go back to the creeds and the
[59:59] foreign and just shuts the door and says
[1:00:01] there's no such a thing as that days of
[1:00:03] miracles are passed divine healing
[1:00:05] there's no such a thing that was just
[1:00:07] for a possible apostle that man is
[1:00:10] spiritually crazy
[1:00:14] that's the prophet's words right there i
[1:00:15] i i'll refer to the prophet's authority
[1:00:18] that man is spiritually crazy there's
[1:00:21] something wrong with him he's pulled
[1:00:23] down the curtains and rejected the holy
[1:00:25] ghost
[1:00:29] amen because his word said if you abide
[1:00:31] in me and my words on you then the light
[1:00:34] shining upon this word ask what you will
[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:39] there's something wrong when they would
[1:00:41] reject god-given sources that god has
[1:00:44] given us to live by his word and they
[1:00:47] reject it
[1:00:49] amen you know
[1:00:52] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:00:54] every word not part of a word but every
[1:00:56] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:00:59] god and when a man will just refuse that
[1:01:02] there's something wrong with that person
[1:01:05] there's something wrong with his
[1:01:07] experience that he claims to love god
[1:01:10] but then refuses god
[1:01:13] hello somebody
[1:01:15] oh i love god i go to church but then
[1:01:16] you refuse his word when it comes to you
[1:01:19] amen and you continue on in your
[1:01:21] artificial christianity
[1:01:24] and that artificial christianity is not
[1:01:26] going to come up in the resurrection
[1:01:28] it's not going to listen
[1:01:30] anything you got on you right now that's
[1:01:32] artificial is not going to come up amen
[1:01:35] it's not going to take the body change
[1:01:38] our cars are not going into body change
[1:01:41] this building is not going in the body
[1:01:43] change your clothes is not going into
[1:01:45] body change
[1:01:47] come on somebody the things you put on
[1:01:49] your body and the all that is not going
[1:01:52] into body change
[1:01:54] it's artificial
[1:01:58] there's something wrong with that person
[1:02:02] you know you say well i tell you what if
[1:02:05] i could just see see somebody get healed
[1:02:07] then i'll believe
[1:02:08] well how many do you need to see get
[1:02:10] healed
[1:02:13] i'll tell you just like the fella talked
[1:02:14] to brother branham one day said i don't
[1:02:16] care if you bring 50 cancers and bring
[1:02:18] 50 doctors to testify i still wouldn't
[1:02:21] believe
[1:02:23] i don't care if you'd raise the dead
[1:02:24] right before me i still wouldn't believe
[1:02:27] there's something wrong with that person
[1:02:30] amen and yet the man was a minister
[1:02:33] supposed to be a minister but just
[1:02:35] because that organization didn't believe
[1:02:37] in the power of god don't
[1:02:39] don't don't believe that the word it
[1:02:42] meant just what it didn't believe that
[1:02:43] the word meant just what it said that
[1:02:45] man runs to this old basement oh musty
[1:02:48] dirty filthy basement of organization
[1:02:51] and refuses the warmth life-giving rays
[1:02:55] of the holy spirit
[1:02:57] jesus christ which is the same yesterday
[1:03:00] today and forever something's wrong with
[1:03:03] that person
[1:03:05] you would rather live in that musty
[1:03:07] darkness
[1:03:10] you would rather live with that
[1:03:12] cankeredness on your life and that
[1:03:14] bitterness on your life and that
[1:03:16] unforgiving spirit has nothing but musty
[1:03:19] stinking darkness
[1:03:21] but there's a light that can do away
[1:03:23] with the darkness
[1:03:25] there's a god that can wash you of that
[1:03:28] and cleanse you of that and raise you up
[1:03:30] whole again
[1:03:34] they want the mustiness they they're
[1:03:36] comfortable in that darkness
[1:03:38] something wrong with that person
[1:03:40] they can say i'm a christian they cannot
[1:03:42] miss a service but if they got
[1:03:44] bitterness in their heart to where they
[1:03:46] won't forgive somebody
[1:03:47] there's something wrong with that person
[1:03:50] not coming up in the right your
[1:03:52] bitterness is not going in the
[1:03:53] resurrection
[1:03:55] and if you've got it in you you ain't
[1:03:57] going either
[1:03:58] it's going to take perfect love
[1:04:00] it's going to take forgiveness and
[1:04:02] letting things go and saying god i'm not
[1:04:05] going with this stuff i'm not walking
[1:04:07] with it no more i lay it all aside hey
[1:04:10] man i loved how brother wendell
[1:04:11] illustrated the other day you know you
[1:04:13] want to poison somebody but yet you're
[1:04:15] drinking the poison
[1:04:16] amen is killing you day by day and your
[1:04:19] life is killing you
[1:04:22] your artificial christian life is
[1:04:24] killing you your artificial is about
[1:04:27] amen even even in your just your your
[1:04:30] home life and thing it is killing you
[1:04:36] would rather live
[1:04:37] in a musty darkness
[1:04:39] than the live in the light of god and
[1:04:41] the bible said when bible the bible says
[1:04:43] jesus christ is the same
[1:04:45] today yesterday today and forever the
[1:04:47] works that i do shall you do also even
[1:04:49] greater than this shall you do for i go
[1:04:51] to my father but men i look at that
[1:04:53] scripture and go right back to the
[1:04:55] basement said that it was only for the
[1:04:56] apostles or that was only for brother
[1:04:58] branham and they refused to see the
[1:05:01] light that's shining in this day
[1:05:03] this light was not just for 50 years ago
[1:05:06] this light is for dead today
[1:05:09] amen these works that i do shall ye do
[1:05:13] also and greater than this shall you too
[1:05:18] hallelujah
[1:05:20] but there's something wrong with that
[1:05:21] person that'll walk away from that
[1:05:23] something wrong with your experience
[1:05:26] when you say you love god
[1:05:28] and you refuse his word
[1:05:31] no matter what the church says in this
[1:05:33] condition and and things cannot be as
[1:05:35] god promised
[1:05:36] is because you won't even receive the
[1:05:38] word or walk in the light the bible said
[1:05:40] let us walk in the light as he is the
[1:05:43] light
[1:05:44] amen then the blood of jesus christ
[1:05:46] god's son cleanses us from all sin
[1:05:49] unbelief
[1:05:51] that if we're walking in god-given light
[1:05:53] of the hour then god takes that word
[1:05:56] that's given for the hour and vindicates
[1:05:58] it just like he did in genesis 1 3 when
[1:06:01] he said let there be light and light
[1:06:04] come forth that sun was the vindication
[1:06:07] of let there be light
[1:06:09] amen his word went forth and light
[1:06:12] followed it and cleared away the
[1:06:14] mustiness and the darkness and and the
[1:06:16] midst and it pushed darkness over into a
[1:06:19] quarter and lights begin to shine that's
[1:06:22] the way god does today he sends his word
[1:06:25] for the hour and the holy spirit comes
[1:06:27] and makes that word live
[1:06:30] that's why we got to have the
[1:06:32] manifestation of the spirit in our
[1:06:34] services because if you don't have him
[1:06:36] in your midst the word can never live
[1:06:41] hallelujah amen you say well i got the
[1:06:43] word but if you don't have the spirit of
[1:06:45] the word that word is dead creeds and
[1:06:47] dogmas
[1:06:52] that's the way god does today he sends
[1:06:54] the word for this hour and the holy
[1:06:56] spirit comes and makes that word live
[1:06:58] and the darkness goes on and the creeds
[1:07:01] in artificial ways and denominations
[1:07:04] but lightness begins to shine because
[1:07:07] it's the word of god being vindicated
[1:07:10] you know we find
[1:07:12] in the bible we could read about the
[1:07:14] wise men that came
[1:07:16] and they followed what brandon would
[1:07:18] call that light he'd call that light
[1:07:19] that hung there a god-given substance
[1:07:22] they followed the word of god to the
[1:07:24] light
[1:07:26] because it was the word that brought the
[1:07:28] light to light to life
[1:07:30] brought that to life he says how did how
[1:07:32] did they follow well they would kind of
[1:07:34] magize and we understand and then we
[1:07:37] find in balaam there was a word spoken
[1:07:39] by balaam the prophet that said a star
[1:07:42] would rise out of jacob yes all right a
[1:07:46] star would rise out of jacob and when
[1:07:48] these men saw the word of god said a
[1:07:51] star would rise out of jacob they
[1:07:54] followed that little god-given token to
[1:07:58] the source of eternal light
[1:08:02] they followed the
[1:08:04] manifested word there was a star that's
[1:08:07] going to rise out of jacob and one day
[1:08:09] that word had laid there for thousands
[1:08:11] of years and seemed to be dormant and
[1:08:13] people forgot it and might a matter of
[1:08:15] fact it was given by prophet balaam and
[1:08:17] we know who balaam was but it was still
[1:08:19] amen the true anointed word of god that
[1:08:21] came
[1:08:22] forth and he speaks it and out of him
[1:08:26] amen amen out of him speaks us where the
[1:08:29] stars gonna rise up and one day the word
[1:08:32] met the moment
[1:08:34] and at the moment the spirit of god
[1:08:37] picked up that word and a star rose up
[1:08:40] and there was a star hanging there and
[1:08:42] there's three men a way over however
[1:08:43] many way over there and they see the
[1:08:45] star rise up in the east and they say
[1:08:48] there's the word and there's a
[1:08:49] manifestation now let's follow the light
[1:08:52] to the eternal source
[1:08:55] hallelujah amen this is exactly what we
[1:08:58] have done in this day the seven angels
[1:09:00] came in this hour and it brought a
[1:09:02] message in this hour and it was a
[1:09:04] message for moments
[1:09:07] and that moment had arrived after it
[1:09:09] laid there for thousands of years but
[1:09:11] the moment is now time for the word to
[1:09:13] be vindicated and a star rose up
[1:09:17] and men that are spiritual are catching
[1:09:20] the moment and they're following that
[1:09:21] word to the eternal source of light
[1:09:26] hallelujah back to eternity again
[1:09:32] he said so they said they followed that
[1:09:35] little god-given token
[1:09:38] to the source of eternal light
[1:09:40] it was quite astounding when they got
[1:09:42] there the source of eternal life was a
[1:09:44] little little baby or a little child
[1:09:47] didn't look like maybe much
[1:09:49] but the star led them there
[1:09:52] looked very humble and it looked like ah
[1:09:54] he just can't be
[1:09:55] maybe to some
[1:09:57] but those men had seen the word being
[1:09:59] made manifest
[1:10:00] and they saw the star hanging over
[1:10:03] and they went to where the star pointed
[1:10:04] to
[1:10:05] amen it may look like what we have ain't
[1:10:07] much compared to other world systems
[1:10:10] may look like it's just a little humble
[1:10:12] thing but a star led us to this place a
[1:10:15] spiritual light led us to this place

[1:10:20] little something it's eternal life

[1:10:25] with everything that i have and i
[1:10:27] believe there's people in this building
[1:10:29] and say god i strip every artificial
[1:10:31] thing away from me i want to lay it all
[1:10:34] aside and if there'd be any darkness in
[1:10:36] me let your light shine on me

[1:12:22] because it's me amen beyond that at that
[1:12:25] place is when i'm gonna step out of this
[1:12:28] immortal body into immortality

[1:12:42] everything you can try to flood the
[1:12:44] waters you can try to burn the hills you

[1:12:49] way but this bride is going to go all
[1:12:52] the way to where he's at
[1:12:56] and we shall meet him
[1:13:02] we've seen a star
[1:13:04] and we've come to worship him
[1:13:08] they come into jerusalem denominational
[1:13:10] headquarters

[1:13:14] where is he
[1:13:15] born king of the jews they knew nothing
[1:13:17] about it they called on the word to find
[1:13:19] out

[1:13:22] leading them to the eternal light
[1:13:24] guide us
[1:13:25] to thy perfect light
[1:13:28] the word is what guides you to the light
[1:13:31] and the light is what makes the word
[1:13:33] vindicated
[1:13:37] it was an angel of god that would show
[1:13:38] as a light up on a hill
[1:13:41] to god's shepherds to eternal light
[1:13:44] it only comes by light
[1:13:48] that's why this message
[1:13:50] is so wonderful because it's been
[1:13:52] vindicated by a light
[1:13:55] to where even documented amen
[1:13:58] documentation has been done that this
[1:14:00] was not the flash of a camera
[1:14:06] it was a light that struck the lens
[1:14:10] life can only come by light the
[1:14:14] shepherds wanting to know they you know
[1:14:16] when the king is born they have seen and
[1:14:18] great carrying on when the king is born
[1:14:20] and here he was so secretly born and
[1:14:22] born in a stable manger horses were
[1:14:24] cattle horses even yet he was a king and
[1:14:27] the angels came down and sang the hymns
[1:14:29] to the shepherds in the light and the
[1:14:32] angels themselves were lights that
[1:14:34] showed with the word of god they had the
[1:14:36] word of god and they told him today in
[1:14:38] the city of david in bethlehem is born
[1:14:41] christ the savior and the angels had the
[1:14:44] word and the word came by light and the
[1:14:46] light was to guide them to where he was
[1:14:50] hallelujah
[1:14:52] oh my
[1:14:53] what i'm thankful for they didn't get
[1:14:55] halfway there and the light go out
[1:14:58] hallelujah amen those three wise men
[1:15:01] they didn't get halfway there or three
[1:15:03] quarters of the way there or just a mile
[1:15:05] away and the light went out when they
[1:15:07] got to him
[1:15:11] oh hallelujah we don't have to worry
[1:15:13] about what's him running out of a source
[1:15:16] he is a source of light light is beaming
[1:15:19] out of him and it's a light it comes i
[1:15:21] mean it's a call that comes a ringing
[1:15:23] over a restless way and it's calling me
[1:15:26] out of this world into another world
[1:15:29] it's calling me out of this dimension
[1:15:31] into another dimension is anybody else
[1:15:33] seeing the light is it calling you is it
[1:15:36] pulling you is there a lie that's
[1:15:38] drawing you and saying come on little
[1:15:40] children

[1:15:46] difficult it's going to be darkness
[1:15:48] around but in your place in your path
[1:15:51] there's gonna be light cause this light
[1:15:53] will never go out
[1:15:56] they ain't enough devils can blow it out

[1:16:18] we ain't hurting nobody
[1:16:23] i don't understand somebody that was so
[1:16:25] terrorized and so tormented by leaving
[1:16:27] the message they got to make videos
[1:16:30] and they got to make all these kind of
[1:16:31] accusations and come up with all these
[1:16:33] fabricated stories

[1:17:07] screams of your children
[1:17:10] and you're going to hear the screams of
[1:17:12] every person that you drawed off and you
[1:17:14] pulled away and you're going to hear
[1:17:16] them scream
[1:17:19] and you're going to see the darkness
[1:17:20] that you put in in their minds and the
[1:17:22] darkness and infiltrated your life and
[1:17:24] them spirits are going to be laughing at
[1:17:26] you and making part of you
[1:17:29] you think you're doing something making
[1:17:31] fun of us wait till that devil starts
[1:17:33] making fun of you
[1:17:35] i don't even know why i'm going that way
[1:17:36] but i'm going come on
[1:17:39] go have yourself a time
[1:17:42] well it all burns
[1:17:48] he was the word
[1:17:51] the word made light and became light
[1:17:54] the word in that generation he was the
[1:17:56] word light of that generation because
[1:17:57] the prophets of old had spoke of him
[1:18:00] and here he come
[1:18:01] and vindicated he was the light of god's
[1:18:03] spoken word
[1:18:05] and all the prophets had been fulfilled
[1:18:07] had said had been fulfilled in him and
[1:18:10] the prophets back here in the word just
[1:18:12] like god at the beginning let there be
[1:18:15] light
[1:18:16] a prophet comes and says a virgin shall
[1:18:18] conceive and bring forth the son they
[1:18:20] shall call his name emmanuel and it be
[1:18:22] god with us
[1:18:25] and they spoke it and the word went out
[1:18:28] and he was the light what was it what
[1:18:30] was he he was the fulfillment of the
[1:18:33] word which brought light
[1:18:38] god's word so it is today god's word has
[1:18:41] been fulfilled in the hour that we're
[1:18:43] living in that's the light it's god
[1:18:46] manifests himself he
[1:18:48] is the light of the world
[1:18:54] people think this is dark right now
[1:18:56] you wait till the light goes out
[1:19:06] you wait because there's no more
[1:19:10] bride no more mercy
[1:19:16] and they're sealing their lives away in
[1:19:18] their own blood
[1:19:25] darkness
[1:19:26] we ain't even seen darkness
[1:19:31] we could turn out every lightness
[1:19:32] building
[1:19:34] and each one of us hold a candle
[1:19:36] a little candle
[1:19:38] well brandon would talk about that he
[1:19:40] would talk about the darkness
[1:19:42] and he said every once in a while in
[1:19:43] that darkness you'll see a little light
[1:19:45] he said that's that's a christian
[1:19:48] we could have little candles
[1:19:50] burning and all these other lights
[1:19:52] turned out
[1:19:54] and it seemed pretty dark
[1:19:56] it would feel pretty dark
[1:19:59] then
[1:20:00] a few blows out
[1:20:02] and it gets darker
[1:20:04] as they cross on to the other side
[1:20:07] why is it getting darker
[1:20:09] because more lights are going out
[1:20:14] more devils are pushing into this realm
[1:20:17] and they're actually taking the the the
[1:20:20] space that was once occupied by light
[1:20:25] that's the only way darkness can come is
[1:20:27] because it has to be in the absence of
[1:20:29] light so at light has to leave for
[1:20:31] darkness to come in
[1:20:33] so when lights leave darkness comes in
[1:20:36] and darkness comes in and darkness wait
[1:20:39] to ever
[1:20:40] goes out
[1:20:44] then how dark is it going to be
[1:20:47] no wonder the scripture says they'll be
[1:20:49] weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[1:20:50] teeth
[1:20:55] one because they'll be remembering what
[1:20:57] a chance they had
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:01] two is they can't be they can't see no
[1:21:03] more where they're going
[1:21:05] and their imaginations begin to run wild
[1:21:08] when's your mind when does your
[1:21:09] imagination run the wildest
[1:21:12] in the dark
[1:21:14] amen at night
[1:21:16] when you'll have a bad dream
[1:21:18] amen in the darkness when you're walking
[1:21:20] down the road i was just the other day
[1:21:22] back in the trailer out on on the
[1:21:24] backside of our property and i'm gonna
[1:21:26] tell you right now i felt like i had
[1:21:27] eyes pushing right through me
[1:21:29] and i'm kind of my hair is raising up on
[1:21:31] the back of my neck
[1:21:32] and i'm looking around i thought if that
[1:21:34] peacock walks out
[1:21:42] your imagination starts going crazy in
[1:21:45] the dark
[1:21:46] amen you're reading revelations about
[1:21:48] imaginations and spirits coming out and
[1:21:50] like hair and teeth and all what is it
[1:21:53] it's cause it's dark
[1:22:02] when the prophet's inspired by the holy
[1:22:04] spirit said unto us a child is born unto
[1:22:06] us a son is given and his name shall be
[1:22:09] called counselor prince of peace mighty
[1:22:11] god everlasting father there it was the
[1:22:14] light began to push
[1:22:16] until the moment was time and it fell
[1:22:19] upon the word
[1:22:20] and the word was illuminated and it came
[1:22:23] forth amen when jesus was walking down
[1:22:25] the shoulders he would say if
[1:22:27] he would begin to speak amen the words
[1:22:30] you can destroy this temple but in three
[1:22:32] days i'll raise it up again why because
[1:22:35] there was a word spoken by david i'll
[1:22:37] not leave his soul in hell neither will
[1:22:39] i suffer my holy one to see corruption
[1:22:42] death was in darkness
[1:22:44] but he broke open the seals of death and
[1:22:47] he walked out of it and he brought light
[1:22:49] again
[1:22:51] he was the light amen amen on the day of
[1:22:54] pentecost that was the light that showed
[1:22:57] when the holy ghost had come when isaiah
[1:22:59] amen said precept upon precept isaiah
[1:23:02] the 28th chapter preceptor must be on
[1:23:04] precept lying upon lie hear a little
[1:23:06] there literally hold fast to that which
[1:23:08] is good for with stammering lips and
[1:23:10] with other tongues well i speak to this
[1:23:13] people
[1:23:14] amen
[1:23:15] why does people not quote that no more
[1:23:23] this is the rest this is a sabbath
[1:23:26] and all and then all of this they would
[1:23:28] just wag their heads and make fun and
[1:23:30] laugh
[1:23:32] but on the day of pentecost
[1:23:34] when the holy ghost fell upon those
[1:23:36] people
[1:23:37] light fell upon that word
[1:23:40] and they walked away
[1:23:43] under the impact of the holy spirit
[1:23:45] acting like drunk men and women
[1:23:48] they walked and the others these others
[1:23:49] in darkness walked away wagging their
[1:23:51] head and said these people are drunk
[1:23:54] full of new wine and so forth but it was
[1:23:56] absolutely the light the word had
[1:23:59] prophesied for the moment and the moment
[1:24:02] was now to be fulfilled and light struck
[1:24:05] the word
[1:24:07] amen so it is in every age the word made
[1:24:09] manifest come to life by the light of
[1:24:12] that age there's a word made manifest
[1:24:15] just in genesis just to the prophets
[1:24:17] just through jesus this through amen the
[1:24:20] days of pentecost through lutheran
[1:24:22] wesleyan and zuzia's tree all the way to
[1:24:25] our day it was the light striking the
[1:24:28] word
[1:24:31] and he hasn't run out of light
[1:24:35] it's still fulfilling prophecy
[1:24:39] don't get your eyes on what's going on
[1:24:41] out there that's nothing but the
[1:24:43] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:24:45] there's light striking the word
[1:24:50] don't get caught up in the must the
[1:24:52] musty smells and the darkness and yes we
[1:24:55] pray for our brothers and sisters over
[1:24:56] there amen but what is happening god's
[1:24:59] fulfilling his word
[1:25:02] this article the other day talked about
[1:25:04] ukrainian jews now going back to their
[1:25:06] homeland that's right
[1:25:10] ain't that amazing god said if you ain't
[1:25:12] going to move i'm going to send somebody
[1:25:14] over here to move you
[1:25:17] amen what is a fulfilling prophecy
[1:25:19] there's no doubt some of them that are
[1:25:21] in those 144 000 and they have to be in
[1:25:24] the land
[1:25:26] and i'm going to tell every way we're
[1:25:29] son or daughter of god if you don't move
[1:25:31] god will send somebody or something that
[1:25:34] will move you
[1:25:39] every prodigal there is a word on your
[1:25:42] trail
[1:25:44] surely mercy and goodness will follow
[1:25:47] them all the days of their life
[1:25:53] and then one day the word meets the
[1:25:55] moment and light shines upon them and
[1:25:58] they say hey there's better things in my
[1:26:00] father's house i'm leaving this pig slop
[1:26:03] i'm leaving this whole world and i'm
[1:26:04] going back to my father's house
[1:26:10] hallelujah if we can see that's about to
[1:26:13] happen because god and we can see it
[1:26:15] moving the jews back it's also got to
[1:26:17] move the bride into her position
[1:26:21] prodigal we can't leave without you
