[17:02] Hallelujah.
[17:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Ask brother Joe Adams
[17:07] if you open the service for us in
[17:09] prayer. I want to continue to remember
[17:11] to pray for brother Ben Coleman.
[17:14] sent a message earlier that they were
[17:15] going to be moving him to a rehab
[17:18] facility. Just still needs prayer as he
[17:21] recovers from that surgery and the
[17:24] nerves to recover, the pain to subside
[17:26] and and that he just have a total and
[17:28] complete healing in his body. Also want
[17:30] to remember to pray for brother Ron
[17:33] Spencer tonight just that the Lord would
[17:35] continue to move on his situation, touch
[17:38] him in a supernatural way and amen be
[17:41] with him. Also, we had a prayer request
[17:42] that was sent in from Sister Kathy
[17:46] Morgan. She asked that we'd remember her
[17:48] in prayer tonight with a lot of pain
[17:50] that she's having in her back,
[17:52] difficulty walking with that. Amen. If
[17:55] you have a need you wanted to lift to
[17:56] the Lord and ask him to come by your
[17:59] way. Amen. Whatever that need may be,
[18:02] you might say, "Lord, just set a fire in
[18:04] my soul tonight or come down and touch a
[18:06] loved one." Whatever it would be. Amen.
[18:09] I believe he's here to meet each one.
[18:10] Let's go to him together in prayer.
[18:15] Let's just take these knees to the Lord
[18:17] now.
[18:18] Father, Lord, we come humbly before your
[18:21] throne tonight to Lord, just to lift up
[18:25] our praise and adoration unto thee, oh
[18:28] God. Lord, we thank you first and
[18:30] foremost for all that you have done for
[18:32] us, Lord. Lord, as the scriptures would
[18:35] tell us that you first loved us, Lord,
[18:38] that's therefore we have a long ending
[18:40] in our hearts, Lord, to love you back.
[18:43] So thankful, Lord, that we were in your
[18:45] thoughts, in your mind, Lord, before the
[18:48] foundation of the world. And we are
[18:49] right now, Father, only displaying,
[18:52] Lord, those thoughts and attributes that
[18:54] you had of us. And Lord, you see our
[18:57] heart's desire is to just draw close to
[18:59] you tonight. Lord, in each and every
[19:01] day, every service, Lord, you have given
[19:04] us an opportunity to come in your
[19:06] presence, God. May it not be in vain
[19:08] tonight, oh God. But Lord, as we
[19:10] approach you, Lord, may we come with a
[19:12] an atmosphere, Lord, to worship you, to
[19:15] give thanks, oh God, to water that seed
[19:18] that's been planted with thanksgiving
[19:20] and praise, Lord. For Lord, if it had
[19:22] not been for you, then where would we be
[19:24] tonight, Lord, you had watched over that
[19:27] life. You watched over that seed that's
[19:29] been planted, Lord. You kept it from
[19:31] harm. You kept it from danger. And Lord,
[19:33] we are here tonight, Father, just to
[19:35] give our thanks back to you. God, I pray
[19:38] there'd be such an atmosphere of worship
[19:40] that'll be surrounded each and every one
[19:42] of us, Lord, as we combine together,
[19:44] Lord, with our licks of fire to create
[19:47] such an atmosphere, Lord, that'll usher
[19:49] in your presence. And Lord, tonight we
[19:51] want to pray for those that are in need.
[19:53] Lord, you see brother Ben, Lord, in the
[19:55] situation in his body with his back,
[19:57] Lord, retaining fluid. We just ask that
[20:00] you'd go to him even now, Lord, in that
[20:02] hospital room, as brother Mike said.
[20:04] Lord, you'd take all the the pain and
[20:07] discomfort away, God. All the swelling,
[20:09] God. May it subside tonight, Lord. And
[20:12] may you give our brother peace in his
[20:13] body. And Lord, calm the troubled waters
[20:16] that's come against him in his life.
[20:19] Father, we also pray tonight for Sister
[20:21] Kathy who's down on her back. Lord,
[20:23] touch her and God, just bring healing to
[20:26] that body and that daughter of God.
[20:28] Lord, we remember Brother Ron tonight as
[20:30] you see the need there. Lord, what a
[20:33] valiant servant he has been, Lord,
[20:35] through much adversity, God, battling
[20:37] cancer now four to five years. And Lord,
[20:40] you said if he would trust you that you
[20:42] would use him like never
[20:44] before. And Lord, certainly you're using
[20:46] him. But tonight, God, he's in need of a
[20:49] touch from you. And we ask that you'd go
[20:51] to your servant, Lord, our friend and
[20:53] our brother tonight and touch him in his
[20:55] body. And Lord, drive the sickness from
[20:58] him tonight, Lord. Not only him, Sister
[21:00] Donna Balor, they're suffering with
[21:02] cancer as well. May you move on that
[21:04] scene, God. And every hand that was
[21:06] uplifted to you tonight in the house of
[21:08] God, Lord, you you know the need
[21:11] represented by that uplifted hand. May
[21:13] you just touch that need and direct
[21:15] brother Timothy tonight, God, as he
[21:17] would, Lord, begin to break the bread of
[21:19] life and begin to preach under the
[21:21] anointing, God. May you just direct him
[21:23] to hearts and lives and situations in
[21:26] need. But we believe you're an ontime
[21:28] God. And Lord, we understand that you
[21:31] can move a man completely away from his
[21:33] notes just to deal with a heart. So we
[21:35] invite you tonight, God. Bless us in
[21:38] your presence. We pray in Jesus name.
[21:41] Amen.
[21:42] [Music]
[21:49] Amen. Amen. The brothers can take up the
[21:51] offering this
[21:53] evening. Lost or

[34:54] stronghold. Shine through the
[35:00] shadows. Oh, just praise his name again
[35:03] tonight. Give him a hand clap tonight.
[35:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Shine through
[35:09] the shadows
[35:11] tonight. Amen. Amen.
[35:14] [Applause]
[35:16] [Music]
[35:19] Amen.
[35:21] Hallelujah. Amen. Things happen when you
[35:23] speak the name of Jesus.
[35:26] Amen. We're thankful to serve a God like
[35:29] that that has a name so powerful, a name
[35:31] that is greater than any other name. At
[35:34] the mention of that name, every demon
[35:36] has to flee. Amen. We just want to go to
[35:41] him in prayer for a moment.
[35:43] Father, just ask once again that you
[35:46] would just speak to our hearts, meet us
[35:48] tonight according to your word. Father,
[35:51] we just give this service to you, Lord.
[35:54] Just as we've kind of had to fight to
[35:57] get here, but Lord, we're here. We're
[36:00] here to serve you and to be used of you,
[36:03] Father. We just submit ourselves to you
[36:06] for this moment in Jesus name.
[36:09] Amen. Amen. Psalms 127 verse one. Also,
[36:15] Philippians
[36:16] 4 19 if you would.
[36:23] like to speak to you on faith in God's
[36:26] provision. Amen. Provision is a an
[36:30] arrangement or a preparation
[36:32] beforehand as for the doing of something
[36:35] or the meeting of needs or the supplying
[36:37] of means. Something that's provided a
[36:41] measure or means for meeting a need. How
[36:45] many has a need tonight? Well, he's a
[36:47] God that can meet your need. Amen.
[36:50] Psalms 127 and verse one said, "Except
[36:53] the Lord build the house, they labor in
[36:56] vain that build it, except the Lord keep
[36:59] the city. The watchman waketh but in
[37:02] vain. It is in vain for you to rise up
[37:05] early to sit up late to eat the bread of
[37:08] sorrow. For so he giveth his beloved
[37:12] sleep."
[37:13] Philippians 4 and verse 19 said, "But my
[37:17] God shall supply all your need according
[37:21] to his riches and glory by Christ
[37:24] Jesus." Amen. Aren't you thankful you
[37:27] serve a God who can supply all your
[37:29] needs? Amen. We let you be seated.
[37:43] Just looking as we as we kind of break
[37:46] into this thought for a moment,
[37:47] something that's kind of been on my
[37:49] heart since last Wednesday is I would
[37:52] want to bring a portion of that as far
[37:54] as a quote back back to your
[37:56] remembrance. Something that struck me.
[37:58] You know, I was telling um brother this
[38:00] week, I said, "Sometimes you put things
[38:02] in your in your sermons or quotes or
[38:05] scriptures and and they're good and and
[38:07] they they do something for you is why
[38:08] you put them in there, but sometimes
[38:10] it's in the middle of the preaching and
[38:12] the anointing is taken over that you
[38:15] really see why you put it in there." A
[38:17] and so just looking at the scripture,
[38:20] except the Lord build the house, they
[38:23] labor in vain that build it. Except the
[38:25] Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh,
[38:28] but in vain. It is vain for you to rise
[38:31] up early, to sit up late, and to eat the
[38:34] bread of sorrows. I I just looking at
[38:37] that, of course, there's many
[38:38] scriptures, amen, that talks about
[38:40] getting up early and not being slothful
[38:43] and all of this. So this this scripture
[38:45] is not contradicting that, but actually
[38:48] if you look at it, he's speaking about
[38:50] it is vain for you to rise up early or
[38:52] sit up late and be worried about
[38:54] everything that's going on and you get
[38:56] up early worried or you stay up late
[38:58] worried or and you eat the bread of
[39:01] sorrow and the things of worry and fret
[39:04] and all of that things that brings that
[39:06] that brings with it. Amen. Amen. But you
[39:09] know, if you would realize that it is
[39:10] God that builds a house, no matter how
[39:13] much you labor, it is God that does it.
[39:15] No matter how much you watch, it is God
[39:18] that keeps you. Amen. It is God that
[39:20] watches over you. It's God that has
[39:22] arranged and made provision for every
[39:24] step of your life. Amen. When you get
[39:27] down into times that you don't know what
[39:28] you can do on your own or or you've
[39:31] tried this or you tried that and you
[39:33] watch many times God in those moments
[39:35] allow you to get there and then he'll
[39:37] come and he'll drop handfuls on purpose.
[39:40] Amen. He'll bring provisions in your
[39:42] time of need. And and I believe tonight
[39:44] he's got a provision for you that if you
[39:46] have a need here tonight that he he's
[39:48] here to meet that need. He's here to uh
[39:50] Amen. to come down and to minister to
[39:52] that need. And I I this is this is a
[39:55] quote that I want to bring back. Amen.
[39:57] The bride in the rapture will come
[39:59] forth. It was all pre-planned by God.
[40:01] All backed up from by God from the
[40:03] beginning. He knows every man, every
[40:06] place who would sit all about it. It's
[40:09] all pre-planned. God knew it would be
[40:11] here. He made it that way so that when
[40:14] we get there, he's already prepared a
[40:16] place for you. Amen. When we get there,
[40:19] it's all prepared. Amen. just like even
[40:22] this night is prepared. I love that that
[40:25] that God is so uh he's so uh he pays
[40:29] attention to details. Amen. He's he's
[40:31] interested in every little portion and
[40:33] everything to where not there won't be
[40:35] an empty place at his table or neither
[40:38] will there be some surprised guest, but
[40:40] he knows each and every one that's going
[40:42] to be there. He knows each and every one
[40:44] that's going to have a place at that
[40:46] table at the marriage supper of the
[40:48] lamb. And he has made a a preparation
[40:50] for that. And and he's gone to prepare a
[40:52] place. We can read that in John 14 and
[40:54] verse one. He said, "Let not your heart
[40:57] be troubled. You believe in God, believe
[40:59] also in me. In my father's house are
[41:02] many mansions. It will not so. I would
[41:04] have told you, but I go to prepare a
[41:07] place for you." Amen. I go to prepare. I
[41:10] go to make ready. I go to make the
[41:12] necessary preparations and to get
[41:15] everything ready. In other words, this
[41:17] is not a spur-of-the- moment event.
[41:20] Amen. This is not happen stance or con
[41:23] or coincidence. God is preparing a place
[41:27] for a prepared people. Amen. The prophet
[41:30] of God would speak about it in the
[41:31] Leoian church age. He said, "The throne
[41:33] room has been set up. The 12 foundations
[41:36] have been laid. The streets of gold have
[41:39] been paved. The ga gates of gigantic
[41:42] pearls are raised raised up and hinged
[41:45] like a pyramid. She stands so fair and
[41:48] glorious. The heavenly beings which who
[41:50] have prepared her watch breathlessly for
[41:53] she glistens and shines with a glory
[41:55] that is unearly. Every facet of her
[41:58] beauty tells the story of amazing grace
[42:01] and Jesus love. She is a city prepared
[42:05] for a prepared people. Amen. and she
[42:08] awaits only for her inhabitants. And as
[42:11] soon and soon they will throng her
[42:14] streets with joy. Hallelujah. I don't
[42:17] know about you, but I'm looking forward
[42:18] to that time. Amen. That God has put
[42:21] such thought and God has put such effort
[42:23] and God has put such of his own of his
[42:27] own mind into to prepare a place, amen,
[42:30] to take me out of this world that this
[42:32] earthly body be dissolved. I have a
[42:35] mansion that is waiting for me. I don't
[42:37] know about you, but I'm not interested
[42:39] in a mansion as far as how uh four
[42:42] stories or five Amen. 5,000 or 18,000
[42:45] square foot and all of this and gold
[42:48] door knobs and that that ain't the kind
[42:49] of mansion I'm looking for. But I am
[42:51] looking for a mansion that's about this
[42:53] tall and brown headed and brown eyes.
[42:56] Amen. And I'm looking for that mansion.
[42:58] And God has prepared us a place. Amen.
[43:02] But was as we heard Sunday, it's only
[43:05] going to be Amen. for a people that is
[43:07] prepared to go there.
[43:11] Amen. He said, you know, I don't believe
[43:13] that a person just happened to be here
[43:16] by chance.
[43:18] Come on now. I'm going to tell you right
[43:20] now, not one of you in this building is
[43:22] here by chance.
[43:24] You're not here, Amen. by by a whim or
[43:28] maybe you just, well, I I I wasn't going
[43:30] to go to church, but right at the last
[43:32] moment, it wasn't by chance.
[43:36] But God pulled on your heart and God
[43:38] brought you here and God has set you in
[43:41] a place. He said, "Think about it. When
[43:43] you come into the world, everything had
[43:45] been prepared for you." Amen. He said,
[43:48] "I don't want to hardly understand that
[43:50] how we could think a God that could
[43:52] prepare all these good things for us and
[43:54] we can't trust him in the middle of our
[43:56] trials. If he brought us into this chaos
[44:00] we're in now and he's prepared the good
[44:02] things of life for us here, how much
[44:04] more can we trust him to prepare things
[44:07] that are to come?
[44:12] Hallelujah. If God has prepared a place
[44:15] for you upon this earth and and he put
[44:18] something on the inside of you to draw
[44:20] you to him and he's brought you to a
[44:22] place Listen, you didn't come to you
[44:24] didn't come to this service by chance.
[44:26] You didn't come into this truth by
[44:28] chance. Amen. You didn't come to God by
[44:31] chance.
[44:33] It wasn't a lottery pick.
[44:36] It was not by chance. It was by the will
[44:39] and the word of Almighty God. God put
[44:43] you here. God placed you here. God done
[44:46] it. It ain't what man has done or what
[44:48] you have done. It's what God did.
[44:54] Hallelujah.
[44:56] So, if God's done this and God's brought
[44:58] you into this place and he's taken care
[45:00] of you and he's provided for you,
[45:03] listen, you may not have everything the
[45:04] world has to offer, but listen, that's
[45:06] nothing but temporary things anyhow.
[45:09] That's right. Sure, there's a lot of
[45:11] people with a lot more money and a lot
[45:13] of people with a lot more cars and a lot
[45:15] of people with a lot more land, but
[45:17] that's not what we're here for. We're
[45:19] seeking a city that has been built
[45:21] without hands. We're seeking a seeking a
[45:23] city that's not a a a city that'll one
[45:26] day he'll be here and the next day be
[45:28] gone, but we're seeking a place that has
[45:31] been spoke of and has been longed for
[45:33] and has been sought after and God has
[45:36] prepared it for you.
[45:41] He said, I I don't think you know that
[45:43] heaven is a place that my mother used to
[45:46] tell me about. Uh he said, "I believe
[45:48] the church has grown from that 100 years
[45:50] ago to think I think old-times used to
[45:52] think that every one of us died and we
[45:54] went to heaven and we had a harp and we
[45:57] sat on the clouds and we played a harp
[45:59] and they knew that there was a place
[46:00] called heaven." He said, "If that be so,
[46:02] all musicians would have it have it on
[46:04] us, you know, because they already know
[46:05] how to play. But that isn't that kind of
[46:07] place. It isn't playing harps at all."
[46:10] He said, "I don't believe the Bible
[46:11] teaches that." But that was a conception
[46:13] they had before the fullness of the word
[46:15] came into existence or the opening of
[46:17] the seven seals as promises in this age.
[46:20] Now we understand. He said, "I believe
[46:22] that heaven is a real place just the
[46:24] same as this is a real place."
[46:29] Come on, somebody. But how much more
[46:31] real is it?
[46:35] Amen. A place. Amen. Could you imagine
[46:37] living in such a wonderful place? Amen.
[46:40] but in this tore up, messed up body. But
[46:42] God knew that this body couldn't live
[46:44] there. So God went and prepared a body
[46:48] for you that you could also live there
[46:50] and you could have heaven on the inside
[46:53] of you and the eternal life moving and
[46:56] living inside of you. The place that
[46:58] you'll never grow old. You'll never be
[47:00] downhearted again. You'll never face
[47:03] anxiety or fear again. Amen. You'll
[47:06] never get up early or stay up late
[47:08] worrying and dreading and wondering.
[47:11] Amen. But God's going to give you a
[47:13] place without fear, without anxiety,
[47:16] without worry, without sickness.
[47:24] He said, I believe heaven's a place
[47:25] that's
[47:26] real. God started us on our spiritual
[47:29] grow growth in this place that we're in.
[47:31] And he said, "I believe that, but I
[47:33] believe that heaven is a place just as
[47:34] real as this. We won't sit up there for
[47:37] eternity and just sit on a cloud. We
[47:40] don't just strum our harp all from o
[47:42] from over here, you know, go over there.
[47:44] We're going to a real place where we're
[47:47] going to do things
[47:50] where we're going to live,
[47:53] where we're going to work, where we're
[47:54] going to enjoy, where we're going to
[47:56] live, we're going to have life, a real
[47:58] eternal life. We're going to a heaven, a
[48:01] paradise. Just like Adam and Eve worked
[48:03] and lived and eat and enjoyed the Garden
[48:05] of Eden before sin come in. We're on our
[48:08] way back there.
[48:11] Amen. That's right. Right back. The
[48:12] first Adam through sin took us out. But
[48:15] the second Adam through righteousness is
[48:18] bringing us back again. He's justified
[48:20] it and is bringing us back. He said, he
[48:23] said, "I know." He said, "You think
[48:24] sometimes that heaven is just that kind
[48:26] of place, but heaven is real. Just think
[48:28] of it." But think of it, he has went to
[48:30] prepare a place. He said, just like your
[48:33] earthly parents before you came here,
[48:35] before they even knew you were coming,
[48:38] they made ready for your coming,
[48:41] right? Amen. They they they they booted
[48:44] they knitted the booties. They I don't
[48:45] guess they do that no more. They bought
[48:47] Nike shoes, whatever they
[48:49] done. They they uh they put a crib up.
[48:52] They painted the walls whether it's
[48:54] going to be pink or blue or whatever.
[48:56] And they put it all just what was it?
[48:57] They were preparing for a a body. They
[49:00] were preparing for a little baby.
[49:03] So they were making preparations for it.
[49:06] And he said if those parents did that,
[49:08] if your earthly parent, Amen, made that
[49:10] kind of preparation for you to come up
[49:12] here on this earth, how much more is God
[49:15] making preparation for you to leave this
[49:18] place and to come home with him?
[49:23] Hallelujah. I I I just bear with my with
[49:26] me in my folly. But I believe God is
[49:28] looking. So, oh Lord, don't you think
[49:30] angels, he's going to like that right
[49:32] there and they're going to like that
[49:33] right there and they're going to like
[49:35] that right over there. Don't you think
[49:37] they're going to enjoy this? Wow. I
[49:39] can't hardly wait for me to receive my
[49:41] children. I can't hardly wait for them
[49:43] to come home to me. He is looking for
[49:45] you. And he's an anticipation for your
[49:48] coming
[49:52] making ready
[49:54] your earthly parents which were earthly
[49:56] parent only in type as a type of the
[49:57] heavenly parent. He said but he said in
[50:00] the scripture he said if you know to
[50:02] give good gifts to your children how
[50:03] much more does the heavenly father know
[50:05] how to give good give good gifts to his
[50:07] children. Jesus spoke these words they
[50:09] made ready for your coming. They made a
[50:11] little crib. They got some booties,
[50:15] Nikes, whatever little clothes and so
[50:18] forth. They made ready everything before
[50:20] you arrived. They prepared before you
[50:23] even took your first breath here on this
[50:25] earth.
[50:27] And Jesus has gone to make ready our
[50:30] coming there. Notice in my father's
[50:32] house is many
[50:35] mansions. It's many
[50:37] mansions. Hallelujah. He's got a He's a
[50:41] God of variety.
[50:43] He don't make just one cookie cutter
[50:45] mansion. And this is what we're all
[50:46] going to have to live in. Listen, he
[50:48] wants all of us in our own special way.
[50:51] Amen.
[50:54] Amen. Listen to you as a earthly parent.
[50:56] I gave birth to four children. Amen.
[50:58] Come from my lawyers and through the
[51:00] bedding ground of my wife. Amen. They're
[51:02] all four different. All right.
[51:06] There's two girls and two boys, but the
[51:08] two boys are different from each other.
[51:09] The two girls are different from each
[51:11] other. But I love them. Everyone,
[51:14] they're all special to me. I I I love
[51:17] their certain attributes they have and
[51:20] the certain characteristics that they
[51:21] have. Amen. But listen, God is even
[51:24] beyond all of that. God prepared you. He
[51:27] envisioned you in his mind before the
[51:29] foundation of the world. He actually got
[51:32] a glimpse. He got He got a picture of
[51:34] you before you ever went through a fall,
[51:36] before you ever made a mistake, before
[51:38] you ever got one scar. And he saw you in
[51:41] his mind. Yeah.
[51:45] Hallelujah. He didn't make us all
[51:47] Timothy Pruduit or Joe Adams or Aaron
[51:49] Hogens. He made us everyone different.
[51:54] All right.
[51:56] But he loves every one of us.
[52:00] Just as you love every one of your
[52:02] children.
[52:04] Come on now.
[52:06] So tell that devil he's a liar when he
[52:08] tries to tell you God don't love you.
[52:16] the world. He said, "Look," he said, he
[52:18] said, "I don't believe." So, maybe you
[52:21] didn't believe me. I'll read it. Okay. I
[52:24] don't believe when we get to heaven,
[52:26] just everybody will look just
[52:30] alike. Hallelujah.
[52:33] You know how boring it would be if we
[52:36] all looked alike right
[52:38] now? If I was literally preaching to 200
[52:41] Timothy
[52:48] Puits, do you know what? What? Pick Pick
[52:52] a better one then, brother. Okay. What
[52:53] if I was preaching the 200 Joe
[52:56] Adams? I'd be Oh, glory to God.
[53:02] Boring. Same
[53:04] amens, same response.
[53:11] Same way of praising God.
[53:14] Same way of responding to the word.
[53:16] Listen, God loves all of his family.
[53:21] So, he made every one of us different.
[53:24] Some of us may shout real loud. Some of
[53:26] us may cry real hard. Some of us may not
[53:29] be able to do nothing but just let it
[53:30] all soak into the inner soul, inner
[53:32] realms of our being. And we don't know
[53:34] how to even how to even express
[53:36] ourselves. God still loves you.
[53:41] Hallelujah. It doesn't matter what the
[53:43] devil tries to tell you. Amen. As long
[53:46] as when he comes through, you allow him
[53:49] to move how he wants to move. You allow
[53:51] him to come upon your heart and you
[53:54] fully surrender yourself to him. That's
[53:56] all that matters.
[54:02] He said, "Could you imagine?" And he
[54:04] said, "I don't believe all will be
[54:05] blondes or brunettes or all little bitty
[54:08] guys or all big
[54:13] guys, all giants." I believe that God is
[54:18] a God of variety.
[54:22] The world proves that he's got big
[54:24] mountains and little
[54:27] mountains. He's got plains. He's got
[54:30] deserts. He's got oceans. He's got land.
[54:33] He got a He made seasons, summer,
[54:35] winter, spring, and autumn. It shows
[54:37] he's a god of variety. He made us or you
[54:40] in a variety. Some men are real
[54:43] blusterous. Some are real dogmatic.
[54:46] Others are fine and others are kind.
[54:52] You see, it just f you find all
[54:55] different kinds of people in his
[54:58] kingdom.
[55:03] So what I'm trying to do is cut that
[55:04] complex off.
[55:07] Amen. Because you know the devil wants
[55:08] to come along and he wants to say,
[55:09] "Well, if you ain't doing it like this
[55:11] one's doing or if you ain't do listen.
[55:13] Oh, we all we're not wanting I can't say
[55:16] it enough. We ain't wanting a church
[55:18] full of just somebody just shouting
[55:21] just because that's what they, you know,
[55:23] just just because we're not trying to
[55:24] get anybody to that place." You
[55:26] understand what I'm saying? It ain't it
[55:27] ain't just a bunch of emotions.
[55:30] But what we want is when God moves,
[55:34] we want people that are able to release
[55:37] themselves and let God move in them how
[55:40] God moves in them.
[55:42] And if it's shouting, glory to God. If
[55:45] it's dancing, glory to God. If it's
[55:47] clapping the hands, glory to God. If
[55:48] it's raising a hand and tears coming
[55:50] down, amen, glory to God. Whatever it
[55:53] is. Amen. As long as you give a 100%.
[55:57] Amen. when he comes through and you say,
[55:59] "God, I want to be a receiving station
[56:02] for your presence."
[56:09] God's a God of
[56:11] variety. See, he says, you know, look at
[56:14] St. Peter and judge him by Andrew.
[56:16] Andrew, he said he was a prayer warrior.
[56:19] He stayed on his knees. Apostle Peter
[56:22] was a fire
[56:23] brand. Cut your ear off, you wouldn't
[56:25] care. Well, that was before the Holy
[56:28] Ghost. Paul was more scholarly
[56:31] like, notice, many
[56:34] mansions. Many kinds of mansions, like
[56:37] many kinds of hills, like many kinds of
[56:41] rivers. What would it be like if he went
[56:44] to go see the mountains? And you said,
[56:45] "What a beautiful mountain." And drove
[56:47] all the way over the country and is the
[56:48] same
[56:49] mountain. That'd get
[56:51] boring. Same river, same stream, looked
[56:54] exactly alike. He is a God of
[56:57] variety. Amen. He's a God of variety. He
[57:00] said, "Because the kindness of your
[57:02] heavenly fathers placed them." He said,
[57:04] "Because some men like mountains, some
[57:06] people like water, some people like
[57:08] deserts."
[57:11] Yep. There's some of them, too. Well, he
[57:13] knew your nature.
[57:15] He made it that way so you could enjoy
[57:18] it.
[57:21] Oh, glory to God. I think that's a
[57:24] wonderful father. Amen. Though he made
[57:26] it like this, I'm glad he made m He
[57:28] said, "I like mountains. I like that."
[57:29] Well, say, "Well, I can't stand all
[57:31] these mountains." Must be He must have
[57:33] emptied his mortar box out
[57:37] here. Brother James Wilson always told
[57:39] me that about about Missouri. He go up
[57:41] there in Missouri, a bunch of rocks. He
[57:42] said, "I believe that's where God put
[57:44] all the scraps when he was done." Right.
[57:52] God's got God got God got God got God
[57:53] got God got God got God got God got God
[57:53] got God got God got it all he he
[57:55] provided so if he knew there was going
[57:57] to be somebody that was here going to
[57:58] come on this earth that like
[58:00] mountains so he built a mountain and he
[58:03] knew there was somebody here that's
[58:04] going to like flat land so he built flat
[58:06] land and he knew there was some people
[58:08] that going to love deserts and and the
[58:10] cactus and things so he built a desert
[58:14] come on he was making preparations
[58:18] he was making provisions for what he
[58:20] knew knew his children was going to
[58:22] like. So why do you think that we're
[58:24] going to get over there and not like it
[58:26] over there?
[58:28] If we have enjoyed this earth and its
[58:30] fallen condition and we have enjoyed its
[58:32] beauty and we've enjoyed amen different
[58:34] parts and places of it, don't you know
[58:37] how much more we're going to enjoy it
[58:39] over there
[58:42] when heaven comes back here upon
[58:45] earth? And this earth is actually in the
[58:48] position and the place it was supposed
[58:50] to be before the fall. And we're going,
[58:52] you think we're not going to enjoy that?
[58:54] Of course, we're going to enjoy that.
[59:01] Well, then you say, "Well, I like the
[59:03] planes where I can see a long ways. I
[59:05] like them for about two
[59:08] days. All that wind." Brother Jeremy
[59:11] text me today asked me, "How's it
[59:12] doing?" So, I'm just going to bring him
[59:13] up. But Jeremy lives in Amarillo, Texas.
[59:17] Wind. It's all it is is wind. Just
[59:22] wind.
[59:23] Wind. Get up tomorrow be wind. Next day
[59:29] wind. Apparently he likes it. Lived
[59:32] there a long time. I like it about two
[59:33] or three days and I'm ready to get out
[59:35] of it. I like
[59:38] trees. I do. I listen. Understand me
[59:41] now. I I I don't I don't I don't look at
[59:43] Louisiana as one of the most beautiful
[59:45] places I ever been in the world. I'm
[59:47] here for one reason. It's this church.
[59:50] That's right. Come on now. Amen. But
[59:53] there's a lot of people that come to
[59:54] Louisiana and think this is the most
[59:56] beautiful place they ever
[59:57] saw. You know, cuz you know how it is.
[1:00:00] You start getting used to it and you
[1:00:02] start looking at the problems. You start
[1:00:03] looking at the issues and you start
[1:00:04] looking at this and the dirty the
[1:00:06] terrible roads and all whatever. you
[1:00:08] start all the stuff that is around and
[1:00:09] you start get negative and you start
[1:00:11] feeding on the negative and all you see
[1:00:13] is negative.
[1:00:15] You know, I actually went out to one of
[1:00:17] the most beautiful places I ever seen in
[1:00:19] the world was Flagstaff, Arizona and I
[1:00:21] wanted the Grand Canyon. I I I was just
[1:00:24] amazed. You know, I'd seen it as a
[1:00:25] little boy, but I got to go a couple of
[1:00:27] years ago and I was like,
[1:00:28] "Wow." You know, a man come up to me and
[1:00:31] said, "I'd like to live one." He lived
[1:00:33] there. He said, "I'd like to live one of
[1:00:34] these days in a beautiful
[1:00:38] place." So, I know a good place,
[1:00:43] Louisiana. Because all he could see was
[1:00:45] what he seen his whole life. And I don't
[1:00:47] know why I'm going here, but many times
[1:00:49] we get so caught up in what we can just
[1:00:51] see around us and the negativity of it.
[1:00:54] Listen, we ought to just enjoy. Amen.
[1:00:56] You grow where God has planted you.
[1:00:59] God will make a provision for you. He'll
[1:01:01] provide for you. He'll make a way where
[1:01:03] there seem to be no way.
[1:01:16] He said, 'Well, he said, 'Well, I like
[1:01:18] mountains. He said, 'Well, I like
[1:01:19] plains.' He said, 'Well, that's two
[1:01:20] different natures, both of us
[1:01:22] Christians, but the father knew that you
[1:01:24] would be here and prepared everything
[1:01:27] before you got here, so you could enjoy
[1:01:29] what you
[1:01:31] enjoy. Your first coming here, he had it
[1:01:34] ready for you when you got here. Isn't
[1:01:36] that marvelous? But remember, these are
[1:01:38] only temporary.
[1:01:41] These are temporary things that are
[1:01:42] around
[1:01:43] us, but they're expressing something
[1:01:46] that you see the tree that's struggling
[1:01:48] and trying to live. It means there's a
[1:01:50] tree somewhere that doesn't have to do
[1:01:52] that. He said, when you see a man
[1:01:55] struggling to live, somebody in a
[1:01:56] hospital or a sick bed or an AC accident
[1:01:59] struggling and the death rattles in
[1:02:01] their throat and pulling and crying,
[1:02:03] screaming for life, what does that mean?
[1:02:05] There's a place somewhere that there's a
[1:02:07] body that doesn't struggle and scream
[1:02:09] like that. Amen.
[1:02:11] It just doesn't do it. All these are
[1:02:13] temporary gifts, but they're only
[1:02:16] expressing that there is one that is
[1:02:18] eternal.
[1:02:22] This is a temporary earth as far as as
[1:02:25] what we're living on, but there's going
[1:02:27] to be an eternal.
[1:02:35] He said, "Remember the Bible said, "If
[1:02:37] this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling
[1:02:39] be dissolved, if it perish, we have
[1:02:42] another one that's already
[1:02:45] waiting." Already waiting. This is what
[1:02:48] he would tell the children of Israel as
[1:02:50] they would come out of the out of the
[1:02:52] land of Egypt and they would go into the
[1:02:54] promised land. He says, "Behold, I sent
[1:02:56] an angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:02:59] way, and to bring thee into the place
[1:03:01] which I have prepared." So, it wasn't a
[1:03:04] place of just, "Well, I think y'all just
[1:03:06] go yonder way." No, he had a prepared
[1:03:09] place. He had a goal in mind. He had a
[1:03:12] He had a It was a It was made ready. It
[1:03:14] was furnished. It was a a direction that
[1:03:17] was arranged. It was an order to what
[1:03:19] they were doing. It may not have looked
[1:03:20] like it. Of course, it didn't look like
[1:03:22] it to Pharaoh because they seem to
[1:03:23] wander in the wilderness. But God had a
[1:03:26] plan.
[1:03:27] And we know what his plan was. He wanted
[1:03:29] Pharaoh to look there and say, "Well,
[1:03:31] they're entangled in the wilderness.
[1:03:32] Let's go back and get our slaves." But
[1:03:34] all he was doing is just enticing
[1:03:36] Pharaoh out of his kingdom down into a
[1:03:38] real a down into an ocean to drown.
[1:03:43] Come on, somebody. Amen. What was it?
[1:03:45] God had prepared them a place. God had a
[1:03:49] prepared place for them. And just as God
[1:03:52] has prepared you a place,
[1:03:57] each one of them had their place already
[1:04:00] ordained of God in the promised
[1:04:05] land. Psalms 34:23 says, "The steps of a
[1:04:10] good man are ordered," or that's another
[1:04:12] word, saying, "prepared."
[1:04:14] They are prepared by the Lord and he
[1:04:17] delightth in his way. Though he fall, he
[1:04:19] shall not utterly cast down be cast
[1:04:21] down. For the Lord upholdeth him with
[1:04:23] his hand. I have been young and now I'm
[1:04:26] old. Yet I have not seen the righteous
[1:04:28] forsaken nor his seed begging bread. For
[1:04:32] God is ever merciful and lendeth, and
[1:04:34] his seed is blessed.
[1:04:37] How many is the seed of God? Then you're
[1:04:40] blessed. I don't care if you just got
[1:04:43] $50 in your bank account tonight. You
[1:04:45] are blessed.
[1:04:47] That's right.
[1:04:53] There was a lot of seeds that got
[1:04:56] sown. Some fell on rocky
[1:04:59] ground. Some fell on places that
[1:05:01] couldn't grow and stone and birds come
[1:05:04] and picked them up and carried them
[1:05:05] away.
[1:05:07] He said, "But those which are sown in
[1:05:08] good ground," Brother Brown would take
[1:05:10] that and he would say, "It is prepared
[1:05:12] ground."
[1:05:14] Good ground such as hear the word and
[1:05:16] receive it and bring forth fruit. Some
[1:05:18] 30fold, some 60, some 100. That's Mark 4
[1:05:22] and verse 20. The word of God is a seed
[1:05:24] and it must have a ground prepared
[1:05:27] beforehand. If you sowed seed, you know,
[1:05:29] and you just throwed it out on the
[1:05:30] ground, it's likely not to come up.
[1:05:34] How many ever tried to do a garden like
[1:05:35] that? Just walk out with some seeds and
[1:05:38] throw it out in the ground and see
[1:05:39] what's happening. No, you get your
[1:05:41] tiller out or whatever and you, you
[1:05:43] know, and you you make a you make a
[1:05:45] place or you build you a box and you you
[1:05:47] get the best soil you can find or
[1:05:49] whatever. What are you doing? You're
[1:05:50] preparing a place for seed to grow.
[1:05:54] Amen. This is what he did. He said he
[1:05:55] said, "So the ground has to be made
[1:05:57] ready first." So God in sovereign grace
[1:06:00] prepares the heart first.
[1:06:03] He makes provisions. He prepared you
[1:06:05] before the foundation of the world to
[1:06:08] receive him in this
[1:06:10] age. He forneew you by his fornowledge
[1:06:14] and ordained you to eternal life. He
[1:06:16] knew you. Therefore, he prepared you.
[1:06:21] Glory to God. That's the reason you
[1:06:23] staggered out of this and you staggered
[1:06:24] into what you have now. It was God
[1:06:27] leading you to the place where he had
[1:06:29] ordained you to be. And if this ground
[1:06:31] isn't prepared beforehand, it will not
[1:06:34] grow. That's the reason the seed of
[1:06:35] faith. When you're preaching faith, you
[1:06:37] see the discernment of the Lord. You see
[1:06:38] things taking place, the gifts of the
[1:06:40] Bible working. People work themselves.
[1:06:42] Oh, hallelujah. I believe it. Come up,
[1:06:44] find themselves disappointed. What was
[1:06:46] it? That ground has to be prepared. It's
[1:06:50] for ordained. It has to be prepared. And
[1:06:52] then you know when it strikes prepared
[1:06:55] ground. This is why we can't come to the
[1:06:58] house of God unprepared.
[1:07:00] All right.
[1:07:01] Come on.
[1:07:04] Hello, somebody.
[1:07:07] I'm on it right now. You wouldn't want
[1:07:08] the preacher to come here unprepared,
[1:07:10] would you?
[1:07:12] Amen. Ain't looked at nothing in 20
[1:07:15] days. Ain't or or since the last
[1:07:17] whatever. A ain't read his Bible. Ain't
[1:07:19] looked at nothing. Ain't ain't prayed.
[1:07:21] Ain't done nothing. Just come up here
[1:07:23] with a blank piece of paper and say,
[1:07:24] "Well, that's all I got tonight." How
[1:07:26] many would go home disappointed? Yeah.
[1:07:29] You done made all the sacrifice. You
[1:07:31] done drove miles. You done got dressed.
[1:07:33] You rushed home from work. And you get
[1:07:34] here and there's an unprepared preacher
[1:07:37] not ready to preach.
[1:07:40] Well, let's flip-flop that around. Amen.
[1:07:42] A preacher gives it all and he prays and
[1:07:44] he and he looks and he's searching for
[1:07:46] the mind of God. God's got a word and
[1:07:49] that word's a seed, but it has to fall
[1:07:52] upon prepared ground.
[1:07:57] Amen.
[1:07:59] This is why we can't come unprepared.
[1:08:02] It's why we got to come praying and
[1:08:03] believing and asking and seeking God and
[1:08:07] saying, "God, help Brother Timothy. Help
[1:08:08] Brother Tim. Help the brothers.
[1:08:09] Whoever's preaching, help. I need
[1:08:12] something.
[1:08:14] I need a a jolt of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:16] tonight. I I need a little fertilizer.
[1:08:20] My leaves are all wilty and they're kind
[1:08:23] of hanging down. I need a little
[1:08:25] something that'll pick me back up."
[1:08:27] Listen, I ain't got miracle grow for
[1:08:28] you, but I got a miracle for you. Yes,
[1:08:31] sir. Amen. There's a miracle of his word
[1:08:34] that if it'll be received in in the
[1:08:36] prepared place, in a prepared ground, it
[1:08:39] will bring forth.
[1:08:53] He
[1:08:54] says, "So, of course, you came to this
[1:08:56] earth. You were trapped into this sin by
[1:09:00] your first parents, Adam and Eve. You
[1:09:02] came as a sin by nature, sinner by
[1:09:05] nature. You didn't want to be, but then
[1:09:07] you heard the gospel and revelation
[1:09:11] struck because there was something on
[1:09:14] the inside of you,
[1:09:21] brother L. Do you know how many other
[1:09:23] people
[1:09:25] heard they heard about serpent seed
[1:09:29] and they thought, "Man, that's the
[1:09:30] craziest stuff I ever heard."
[1:09:34] That is that is out there. What have you
[1:09:37] been drinking? What have you been
[1:09:38] smoking?
[1:09:40] My church don't believe
[1:09:42] that. But brother Hail heard it.
[1:09:47] And he's like, "Tell me more."
[1:09:50] What was it? It was something that was
[1:09:52] placed on the inside of him. Others had
[1:09:55] heard it, heard it, turned it away for
[1:09:57] who knows how many times. Brother Joshua
[1:09:59] went he he had told about he told this
[1:10:01] one, he told that. They laughed at and
[1:10:02] they scorned. All of a sudden, there
[1:10:04] came a place that was prepared
[1:10:08] and a word was spoke. Said, you know, it
[1:10:10] wasn't an apple in the garden.
[1:10:13] What was it? And he begin to give it to
[1:10:15] him. What happened is something sparked
[1:10:17] him on the inside.
[1:10:20] Come on. You know what that was that
[1:10:22] sparked for you? It might not have been
[1:10:23] serpent seed. It might have been
[1:10:25] baptism. It might have been the godhead.
[1:10:27] It might have been a a myriad of thing.
[1:10:29] But whatever, you know what it was. when
[1:10:31] it struck your heart and you said that's
[1:10:33] nothing but the truth.
[1:10:38] What was it? It fell on prepared ground.
[1:10:47] He said other men might sit right beside
[1:10:49] you and say, "I don't believe that
[1:10:50] stuff. That's nonsense. I don't believe
[1:10:52] it." But something was on the inside of
[1:10:55] you
[1:10:57] like they did on the day of Pentecost.
[1:10:58] They laughed. said, "These man men are
[1:11:00] full of new wine." But it was a great
[1:11:02] thing to those it was happening to.
[1:11:06] Woo! I could shout right there.
[1:11:10] Hallelujah. They can make fun. They can
[1:11:12] they can be a critic. They can do
[1:11:14] whatever they want to. They can gossip.
[1:11:17] They can clip. They can do whatever they
[1:11:18] want to. But let me tell you, it's a
[1:11:20] great thing to those it's happening to.
[1:11:23] That's right. They can laugh and make
[1:11:25] fun of somebody. Amen. Dancing in the
[1:11:28] spirit. But it's a great day to that one
[1:11:30] that it's happening to. They can make
[1:11:32] fun of somebody is crying their eyeballs
[1:11:35] out, but it's a great day to that one
[1:11:37] that it's happening to.
[1:11:43] While others laughed, these were
[1:11:45] rejoicing. Yeah.
[1:11:48] God was revealing himself to them. It
[1:11:51] was a revelation to the individual,
[1:11:53] which is faith. Faith that's revealed.
[1:11:56] If it wasn't faith then it wouldn't even
[1:11:57] be there. It was faith. These seeds has
[1:11:59] to have a ground prepared first. All the
[1:12:02] therefore all he forneew he called. All
[1:12:05] he called he forneew he predestinated.
[1:12:07] If you want to read that's Romans 8:28
[1:12:09] and verse through verse 34. Ephesians 1
[1:12:11] verse uh 1-5. All he called. All he
[1:12:14] forneew he called. All he called he
[1:12:16] justified. All he justified. He's
[1:12:18] already glorified. There's nothing out
[1:12:20] of order. It's hidden exactly the way
[1:12:22] God's word said it was. We see this
[1:12:24] message being rejected today. Isn't that
[1:12:27] just what the scripture said it would
[1:12:28] do? Amen. They would reject it. They
[1:12:30] would throw it aside. But there's
[1:12:32] somebody that's a it's it's a real thing
[1:12:34] it's happening to. There's something
[1:12:37] that struck on the inside and light came
[1:12:40] down and it broke the darkness that was
[1:12:42] inside. And that seed has come forth to
[1:12:45] life.
[1:12:49] Just like that chicken in or that eagle
[1:12:51] in that chicken pin. That eagle wondered
[1:12:54] all his life, why in the world I just
[1:12:57] don't seem to fit in with all these
[1:12:58] chicken. He tried. He tried to drink
[1:13:01] like a
[1:13:03] chicken. Tried to eat like a
[1:13:06] chicken, tried to b like a chicken, cuss
[1:13:10] like a chicken, I
[1:13:12] guess. Tried all kinds of them.
[1:13:15] Something just wasn't right.
[1:13:17] But all of a sudden, one day out in that
[1:13:20] chicken yard, you heard something. It
[1:13:24] was from another dimension.
[1:13:28] How many remembers that eagle screaming
[1:13:29] at you? It's a word speaking to the
[1:13:32] word. Amen. The eagle screamed. Amen.
[1:13:36] Something on the inside resonated with
[1:13:38] that eagle. It didn't resonate with no
[1:13:40] chicken. All it did was make the chicken
[1:13:42] scatter and they ran for the roost and
[1:13:44] they ran for the bar. Well, this eagle
[1:13:46] standing out the middle of that chicken
[1:13:47] yard say, "What is that?"
[1:13:50] Wow, that looks like me up there.
[1:13:54] I knew I didn't have the same feathers
[1:13:55] as these chickens have. I listen, he
[1:13:58] didn't all of a sudden become an eagle.
[1:13:59] He was born an eagle.
[1:14:02] Come on, somebody. You just didn't all
[1:14:04] of a sudden become a son of God. You was
[1:14:06] a son of God before the foundation of
[1:14:08] the world. It was the devil that stole
[1:14:10] you out of the nest and he put you in a
[1:14:13] chicken yard. But God's grace and mercy,
[1:14:16] he made a provision to fly over where
[1:14:18] you was at and call you by name.
[1:14:22] And something on the inside responded.
[1:14:32] God made
[1:14:33] provisions. God is still making
[1:14:35] provisions.
[1:14:40] He
[1:14:45] says, he said, "What?" He me going me
[1:14:48] going
[1:14:49] down. God making
[1:14:52] provisions, providing for you in this
[1:14:54] day that you could
[1:14:58] hear. Going back to Psalms 20 127
[1:15:02] verse1, except the Lord build the house.
[1:15:06] Except the Lord keep the
[1:15:12] city, the watchman wakes up in vain,
[1:15:17] he's not going to be able to keep it on
[1:15:18] his own. It's going to take the Lord.
[1:15:22] You're not going to be able to make it
[1:15:23] on your own. It's going to take
[1:15:26] him. In other words, we can wake up with
[1:15:30] worry and fret and it'll not do you one
[1:15:33] bit of good.
[1:15:36] Well, what am I going to do about the
[1:15:37] bills, brother Timothy? What am I going
[1:15:39] to do about this? You're going to trust
[1:15:40] God.
[1:15:43] Sure, you're going to continue on and do
[1:15:45] what you can do as far as humanly, but
[1:15:47] don't don't get into that place to where
[1:15:48] you're worry and you can you know what
[1:15:50] that worry will do? It'll consume you to
[1:15:52] where you'll just sit down and give up
[1:15:54] and die.
[1:15:59] But it's God, the Lord builds a
[1:16:01] house. So all of our worry and all of
[1:16:04] our fret and all of that stuff. Amen. We
[1:16:06] got to trust that God is making a
[1:16:09] provision that God is providing. It is
[1:16:12] good. It has to be God that does the
[1:16:15] building and the keeping.
[1:16:18] Our worrying and our threatening about
[1:16:20] things allows pressure to build up and
[1:16:22] will do nothing but tear us down
[1:16:24] physically, tear us down emotionally,
[1:16:26] tear us down spiritually.
[1:16:30] Come on, somebody. No matter how hard
[1:16:32] you work, it is the Lord that has to
[1:16:34] build.
[1:16:37] I'm not telling you ain't got something
[1:16:38] to do. Amen. But no matter how hard you
[1:16:41] work, the Lord has to give the increase.
[1:16:44] Amen. No matter how hard you try to hold
[1:16:47] it together, it is the Lord that has to
[1:16:49] keep it. Yes.
[1:16:52] No matter if you rise up early, you sit
[1:16:54] up late or you're eating, you're eating
[1:16:55] a bread of sorrow and you're going from
[1:16:58] one thing to another, you need to stop
[1:17:00] all of that nonsense and just rest
[1:17:02] knowing that God is even working. When
[1:17:05] you don't see him working, he's building
[1:17:07] when you don't see him building. He's
[1:17:09] keeping when you don't see him keeping.
[1:17:11] He's in the middle of your storm. He's
[1:17:13] in the middle of your sickness. He's in
[1:17:15] the middle of your trial. He's in the
[1:17:17] middle of your struggle. He's in the
[1:17:19] middle of the things of life. When you
[1:17:21] think there's no way up, there ain't no
[1:17:23] way down. There ain't no way around it.
[1:17:25] God will open up a way and he'll make a
[1:17:28] way through it.
[1:17:31] Listen, that's not just that's just not
[1:17:33] here happy golucky preaching. That is
[1:17:36] the faith of almighty God that has been
[1:17:38] extended to you. The word is going
[1:17:41] forth. Is there a prepared ground to say
[1:17:43] yes Lord?
[1:17:46] I cast my worrying down. I cast my
[1:17:49] fretting down and I am going to trust
[1:17:51] you Lord. You making the
[1:17:56] provisions and when you can give it to
[1:17:59] him then you his beloved can
[1:18:05] rest. Cuz I want you to understand when
[1:18:07] you're in the middle of a trial does not
[1:18:10] change who you are.
[1:18:12] You're still his beloved.
[1:18:16] You've been made accepted in the
[1:18:20] beloved.
[1:18:21] Hallelujah. This is what it says in
[1:18:23] Proverbs 3 and verse 23. He says, "Then
[1:18:26] you will walk on your way of life
[1:18:28] securely and your foot will not
[1:18:33] stumble. When you lie down, you will not
[1:18:37] be afraid. When you lie down, your sleep
[1:18:41] will be sweet.
[1:18:46] Do not be afraid of sudden fear, nor of
[1:18:50] the storm of the wicked when it comes,
[1:18:52] because you are blameless.
[1:18:56] It's amplified. Cause you are blameless.
[1:19:00] For the Lord is your confidence and he
[1:19:04] is firm and strong and he will keep your
[1:19:07] foot from being caught in a trap.
[1:19:11] Hallelujah. In other words, he has made
[1:19:14] a way of escape.
[1:19:27] He has brought you to this place for a
[1:19:31] reason. He's brought you to this service
[1:19:34] for a reason.
[1:19:36] He's brought you
[1:19:37] here because he loves you
[1:19:42] and he's moving on your behalf even when
[1:19:45] you don't even see
[1:19:49] it. I I can remember many trials that
[1:19:52] I've been
[1:19:55] through with my children and think I
[1:19:58] think about
[1:19:59] Andrew being born with insufficient
[1:20:03] lungs lacking a substance there that he
[1:20:06] couldn't breathe. Watching their little
[1:20:08] body turn blue
[1:20:10] and his lips turn purple and all kind of
[1:20:14] fear strike me and watch them as they
[1:20:17] run down the hall with them. Of course,
[1:20:19] the devil wants to sit right there on
[1:20:21] your shoulder and say, "Well, must have
[1:20:23] really done something this time,
[1:20:25] boy. He really after you
[1:20:29] now. He wouldn't do that to you if he if
[1:20:32] you was his son. He wouldn't allow that
[1:20:34] to happen." All kinds of things started
[1:20:36] going through my mind. All kind of
[1:20:39] mistakes and failures and stuff that I
[1:20:41] had done started just like a gatling gun
[1:20:45] going.
[1:20:47] Anybody ever been there? Oh yeah.
[1:20:51] Well, if you'd have done this and this
[1:20:53] wouldn't have, you would have done this.
[1:20:54] And he he wants to try to keep you up at
[1:20:56] like late at night guessing what you
[1:20:58] could have done.
[1:21:01] Wake you up early thinking about what
[1:21:03] you could do.
[1:21:08] Here I am wondering what's what's the
[1:21:10] next step. And and I go in and they they
[1:21:14] begin to work on his little body. And
[1:21:15] I'm watching them. I'm just praying and
[1:21:17] I'm asking God to intervene and and
[1:21:20] they're pumping him. They're doing
[1:21:21] everything they can. They're putting
[1:21:22] oxygen in him and and they say the
[1:21:24] doctor saying, "Look, get get it. Get
[1:21:26] something." And she's screaming. He's
[1:21:27] not going to die on my
[1:21:31] watch. It didn't look like God was
[1:21:35] working. It looked actually the
[1:21:37] opposite. It looked like the devil was
[1:21:39] having a good time right now. My God was
[1:21:41] somewhere else. But even in the middle
[1:21:43] of the storm, he was still right there.
[1:21:47] I would go down to the Walmart the next
[1:21:49] day and my wife had had to have a
[1:21:51] C-section and I I I would go down there
[1:21:53] to go get some things. I was going to go
[1:21:54] see Andrew because they took him to
[1:21:55] another hospital over in Shreport
[1:21:57] because they couldn't he couldn't do
[1:21:58] nothing with him and mend didn't have
[1:22:00] the facility at the time. And here here
[1:22:02] he is being put in the NICU and all the
[1:22:05] all the things that's going on. And and
[1:22:06] I'm driving to Walmart to get something
[1:22:08] right quick for Sister Ruth or
[1:22:10] something. And I and I turn on the radio
[1:22:12] and there's a preacher come on there and
[1:22:13] he says and he just begin to read the
[1:22:15] scripture and he said Abraham believed
[1:22:17] in
[1:22:19] God. I said that's right. And I turned
[1:22:21] it
[1:22:22] off and I began to cry out to the Lord.
[1:22:25] I said to God, if Abraham believed you
[1:22:29] and he was way past childbearing and you
[1:22:31] gave him a
[1:22:33] son, then you told him to go slay him
[1:22:35] and he walks up there upon the altar and
[1:22:37] he puts him on an altar to sacrifice
[1:22:39] him, but you provided for him because he
[1:22:43] believed in you. And I said, I am also a
[1:22:46] son of Abraham.
[1:22:50] I said, I remember when Abraham done a
[1:22:52] lot of wrong. He he went to places he
[1:22:54] wasn't supposed to. God told him not to.
[1:22:56] He done things God told he lied. He done
[1:22:58] all kinds of things. But that was under
[1:23:00] the blood of bulls and goats.
[1:23:04] But there came a transfer and there
[1:23:06] became a new covenant. And it was no
[1:23:08] longer under the blood of bulls and
[1:23:09] goats. It was under the blood of a
[1:23:12] spotless lamb. And under the blood of
[1:23:14] that spotless lamb, God made a
[1:23:17] provision. Yes, sir. Oh, hallelujah. And
[1:23:20] in that provision, not one of Abraham's
[1:23:24] faults was ever mentioned. That's right.
[1:23:27] Matter of fact, it said he staggered not
[1:23:29] at the promises of God, but was strong
[1:23:31] in the faith. Oh, that ought to give
[1:23:33] somebody courage. You're not under the
[1:23:35] blood of bulls and goats. You're under
[1:23:37] the blood of the spotless lamb. You have
[1:23:40] not staggered. You will not fall. You
[1:23:43] will not go down. But he will keep
[1:23:47] you. Hallelujah. He will uphold you with
[1:23:50] his hand.
[1:23:57] I said, I don't know what's about to
[1:23:58] happen, but I know God's in moving.
[1:24:02] Tim would talk to me, my pastor, and he
[1:24:03] says, God's God will have a testimony.
[1:24:07] He wants you to have your own personal
[1:24:09] testimony because I was just entering
[1:24:11] into the ministry. And you know it's
[1:24:13] easy to tell other people's testimonies,
[1:24:16] but when God gives you one yourself,
[1:24:19] you can take that thing and you can wear
[1:24:21] that devil's high wear and wore his
[1:24:23] hideout for now 23 years.
[1:24:28] Whatever it is, how old are you,
[1:24:30] Andrew? 21
[1:24:34] years. We got 23. I'll wear his hide out
[1:24:36] for 23.
[1:24:39] Cuz that devil, he tried to wear me out.
[1:24:43] He tried to tear me down. I love turning
[1:24:46] it back on him. Amen. I went, went back
[1:24:48] to the hospital and I told sister Russ,
[1:24:50] I don't know what we're about to go
[1:24:51] through, but this is what has happened.
[1:24:53] We're not going to look at monitors.
[1:24:54] We're not going to look at wires. We're
[1:24:55] not going to look at nothing. We're
[1:24:57] going to look at the promise of almighty
[1:24:58] God. It is God that gave us that son,
[1:25:02] and it's God that's going to keep him.
[1:25:04] Amen. What's the use of me worrying
[1:25:06] about it? I can't do nothing anyhow. My
[1:25:09] hands are tied. But my God, he don't
[1:25:11] He's not He's not kept back by hospital
[1:25:14] walls. He's not kept back by Amen
[1:25:17] screens and things that's there. He's
[1:25:19] not looking at none of that. He's
[1:25:21] looking at his promise.
[1:25:29] Oh, it got
[1:25:30] worse. went from a ventilator to
[1:25:33] oscillator. Paralyzed his little
[1:25:36] body. Looked like a dead little baby
[1:25:39] laying there with just little chest
[1:25:40] bumping up and
[1:25:41] down. But we didn't look at that. We
[1:25:45] looked to the
[1:25:48] [Music]
[1:25:54] promise. That's what you got to do. Who
[1:25:58] was it? Was it Daddy Bosworth? The son
[1:25:59] was in the hospital. Was that actually
[1:26:01] him? He was in a hospital and that boy
[1:26:02] was going down. Brother Brandon went and
[1:26:04] prayed for him. Nothing changed on the
[1:26:06] monitor. Nothing changed anywhere. Old
[1:26:08] Daddy Bosworth, it changed with him,
[1:26:10] though
[1:26:12] cuz he was a prepared place.
[1:26:15] Oh, come on now. The word had come and
[1:26:17] been prayed over his little boy, and he
[1:26:19] done saw enough of God to know God
[1:26:21] wasn't going to turn him down. And so
[1:26:23] what he do? He said, "Look, oh, honey,
[1:26:24] ain't it so good? Our our boy is about
[1:26:26] to go home.
[1:26:29] Ain't it so wonderful? He's healed. And
[1:26:31] that little nurse said, "Oh, man. What
[1:26:32] you looking? Look at this. Is it going
[1:26:34] down? It's going down." He said, "Oh,
[1:26:35] I'm not looking at that. I'm looking at
[1:26:37] a promise cuz God made me a provision."
[1:26:43] Come on, somebody. If you'll start not
[1:26:45] looking at what your children are doing
[1:26:47] or what's going on in your family or
[1:26:49] what's around you, but you'll start
[1:26:51] looking at your provision. That's right.
[1:26:54] You'll start looking at your promise.
[1:26:56] What God has given you, God will
[1:26:59] perform.
[1:27:08] Matthew 25, the musicians can come.
[1:27:11] Verse 31 says, "When the Son of man
[1:27:13] shall come in his
[1:27:14] glory, and all the holy angels with him,
[1:27:18] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[1:27:20] glory, and before him shall be gathered
[1:27:23] all nations, and he shall separate them
[1:27:26] one from another, as a shepherd divideth
[1:27:29] his sheep from the goats. And he shall
[1:27:32] set the sheep on his right hand, and the
[1:27:34] goats on his left. And shall the king
[1:27:37] say unto them that are on his right
[1:27:40] hand, come you blessed of my father,
[1:27:43] inherit the kingdom prepared.
[1:27:47] Amen. Prepared for you when? From the
[1:27:52] foundation of the world.
[1:27:56] God's already made a provision.
[1:28:00] He's already made a provision. Do you
[1:28:03] got faith in his provisions?
[1:28:06] Oh, we'll have faith in stock
[1:28:07] markets. Good
[1:28:09] luck. We'll have faith in all kinds of
[1:28:12] things. Put our faith in a lot of
[1:28:15] doctors. Love doctors. Appreciate them
[1:28:17] for what they
[1:28:20] do. But it's time we put our faith in
[1:28:22] his provision. God provision.
[1:28:27] God's provided.
[1:28:39] God's provided. Quit looking at
[1:28:42] symptoms. Start looking at his
[1:28:45] provision. Have more faith in his
[1:28:47] provision than you do in the
[1:28:50] symptoms. All symptoms are real. I'm not
[1:28:52] trying to say they're
[1:28:54] not. They can be very real.
[1:28:58] that God's provision is more real, more
[1:29:02] powerful, more
[1:29:06] able. God bless you tonight. Let's bow
[1:29:08] our
[1:29:11] hearts. Want me to say, "Lord, I I want
[1:29:14] to have faith in your provision tonight,
[1:29:18] Lord. What you
[1:29:22] provided, what you've given me, you you
[1:29:26] prepared for me to be here. You made it
[1:29:28] my life to be a certain
[1:29:32] way. Oh, yeah. Sometimes it's hard. Ask
[1:29:36] Abraham, Sarah. It was hard. Ask Hannah.
[1:29:39] It was
[1:29:40] hard. Ask
[1:29:42] David. It was
[1:29:45] hard. Wasn't always kingdom authority
[1:29:47] with
[1:29:48] David. He had to go through a lot of
[1:29:50] things before he ever got there.
[1:29:55] And even when he was king, it was still
[1:29:58] hard. This earth is not made to be
[1:30:03] easy. But God has made a provision for
[1:30:06] every step of your
[1:30:09] way. Have faith in
[1:30:11] him. God will
[1:30:13] provide. If you need a job, God can
[1:30:16] provide that. If you need bills to be
[1:30:18] paid, hey, I know God can provide for
[1:30:20] that.
[1:30:22] Whatever you need, God's a provider. He
[1:30:25] is Jehovah
[1:30:27] Gyra. He's more than
[1:30:31] enough. He's more than enough. Father,
[1:30:35] you see the hands that were lifted all
[1:30:36] over this
[1:30:38] building. Help us, Lord. Sometimes it's
[1:30:41] so easy to look at negative things
[1:30:43] around
[1:30:44] us, negativity of
[1:30:47] life, to see all the hard times and all
[1:30:50] the bad times. But Lord, we even in this
[1:30:52] fallen world, we've enjoyed a lot of
[1:30:54] good
[1:30:55] times, a lot of wonderful
[1:30:58] times, Lord, where you provided and you
[1:31:00] made a way, you opened up a
[1:31:04] path, God, sometimes it seems so hard
[1:31:08] because it's just one thing after
[1:31:10] another. I I was just thinking the other
[1:31:11] day on a tractor how hard life can be.
[1:31:15] And seemed like one thing after another.
[1:31:17] And then I get a phone call a few
[1:31:20] moments later about my little grandson
[1:31:22] being sick. And he spends days in and
[1:31:25] out of the hospital. And yet today,
[1:31:28] Lord, you're his provider. And you made
[1:31:31] a way, Lord, that he could be
[1:31:33] healed. We're thankful for that,
[1:31:37] Lord. God, we get bad news a lot. We see
[1:31:40] a lot of bad things happen. There's a
[1:31:42] lot of bad things going on in this
[1:31:44] earth. Sometimes it gets so easy to get
[1:31:47] caught up in all of that. But at the
[1:31:49] same
[1:31:50] time, one of the most wonderful things
[1:31:52] that's ever happened in this this whole
[1:31:55] world's history is going on as we heard
[1:31:58] Sunday. A rapture that is taking
[1:32:01] place. Oh God, may we just be enraptured
[1:32:04] into your love and mercy and grace into
[1:32:07] your Holy Spirit in those heavenly
[1:32:09] places we heard about.
[1:32:12] Lord to take us from this place into
[1:32:14] another dimension to change these old
[1:32:17] bodies to go to a prepared
[1:32:20] mansion. Bless your people tonight.
[1:32:22] Bless every hand. You know the need
[1:32:24] represented behind that hand.
[1:32:26] God, God, may you meet it. I
[1:32:30] pray meet it according to thy riches and
[1:32:34] glory. Lord, may all their worrying and
[1:32:37] fret, may they just lay it
[1:32:39] down. Say, God, this is your city. This
[1:32:43] is your body. This is your
[1:32:48] life. It is you that keeps it. It is you
[1:32:52] that builds
[1:32:53] it. It is you that take care of it. It's
[1:32:56] you, Lord, that watches over with that
[1:32:58] allseeing eye, seeing everything that's
[1:33:01] going on. God bless each heart I pray.
[1:33:05] Strengthen us today Lord by your word.
[1:33:07] We pray in Jesus
[1:33:10] name.
[1:33:14] Amen. So many times I've
[1:33:18] questioned certain
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:23] circumstances things I could
[1:33:26] not
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:31] understand. Many times the
[1:33:35] trials and weakness blur my
[1:33:39] vision and my
[1:33:41] frustrations get
[1:33:48] so I am
[1:33:52] reminded I've never been
[1:33:56] foren never had to stand the
[1:34:05] As I look at all the
[1:34:08] victory, the spirit rises up in me. Oh,
[1:34:13] it's through the fire. My
[1:34:22] weaknesses. He never
[1:34:25] promised that the cross would not get
[1:34:28] heavy.
[1:34:30] and that you would not be hard
[1:34:34] to find.
[1:34:39] He'd never
[1:34:41] offer victories without fight.
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:54] Just remember when you're
[1:34:57] standing in the valley of
[1:35:01] decision and the
[1:35:04] adversary says give
[1:35:08] in
[1:35:12] just our Lord will show up
[1:35:17] and he will take you through the fire
[1:35:22] again.
[1:35:26] So many times of question,
[1:35:30] oh certain
[1:35:34] circumstances, things I could not
[1:35:37] understand.
[1:35:43] So many times in
[1:35:46] trials, weakness blurs my vision
[1:35:51] and my
[1:35:52] frustrations get so out of hand.
[1:35:59] Oh, I am
[1:36:02] reminded I've never been forsaken. Then
[1:36:06] I have never had to stand the test.
[1:36:12] I
[1:36:15] love all the
[1:36:18] victory. The spirit rises up in me. Oh,
[1:36:23] and it's through the fire. My weakness
[1:36:26] is made strong.
[1:36:32] He never
[1:36:34] promised that the cross would not get
[1:36:37] heavy. that the hill would not be hard
[1:36:43] to climb.
[1:36:48] He never
[1:36:50] offered a victory without fighting, but
[1:36:54] he said help would come in.
[1:37:03] Just remember when you're
[1:37:06] standing in the valley of decision
[1:37:11] and the
[1:37:12] adversary says give in
[1:37:18] just so
[1:37:21] long our Lord will show
[1:37:25] up and he will take you through the fire
[1:37:31] I know within
[1:37:33] myself say I know within myself that I
[1:37:39] would surely perish.
[1:37:42] Oh, but if I trust the hand of God, I
[1:37:46] know he'll shield the flames again.
[1:37:53] Oh,
[1:37:57] he never promised
[1:38:00] that the cross would not get heavy
[1:38:04] and the hill would not be hard to climb.
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:12] He never offered more victory without
[1:38:18] fighting. But he said help would always
[1:38:22] come in time.
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:27] Just remember when you're
[1:38:30] standing in the valley of decision
[1:38:35] and the
[1:38:36] adversary says give in.
[1:38:42] Just hold
[1:38:45] on. Our Lord will show up
[1:38:49] and he will take you to fire again.
[1:38:56] So just hold
[1:39:00] on. Our Lord will show up
[1:39:05] and he will take you through the
[1:39:09] fire
[1:39:11] [Music]
[1:39:15] again. and
[1:39:17] you made a
[1:39:23] way. When our backs were against the
[1:39:27] wall and it looked as if it was
[1:39:32] over,
[1:39:34] you made a way.
[1:39:40] And we're standing
[1:39:43] here only because you made say
[1:39:49] you made a
[1:39:55] way when our backs were against the
[1:39:59] wall and it looked as if it was over.
[1:40:05] you made a
[1:40:10] way. And we're standing
[1:40:14] here only
[1:40:16] because you
[1:40:18] made a
[1:40:21] way. And you move mountains.
[1:40:26] You cause the walls to fall with your
[1:40:33] power. Perform
[1:40:37] mirales. There is
[1:40:40] nothing that's
[1:40:45] impossible. And we're standing
[1:40:48] here only because you made.
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:55] You made a
[1:41:00] way when our backs were against the
[1:41:04] wall and it looked as if it was
[1:41:09] over.
[1:41:11] You made a
[1:41:16] way. And we're standing
[1:41:20] here only because you
[1:41:25] made

[1:41:33] When our backs were against the
[1:41:36] wall and it looked as if it was
[1:41:42] over, you made a
[1:41:48] way and we're standing
[1:41:52] here only because you may.

[1:42:05] mountains be
[1:42:07] shaking, I know I'm not
[1:42:12] forsaken. You are with me. Every step
[1:42:18] that Oh, I don't have to
