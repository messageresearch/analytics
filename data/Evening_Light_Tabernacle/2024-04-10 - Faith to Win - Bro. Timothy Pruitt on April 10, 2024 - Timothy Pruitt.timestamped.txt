[36:42] 14 amen verse
[36:48] 25
[36:56] amen
[36:58] so there went a great multitudes with
[37:00] him and he turned and said unto him unto
[37:03] them if any man come to me and hate not
[37:06] his father and mother and wife and
[37:08] children and Brethren and sister yay in
[37:12] his own life also he cannot be my
[37:15] disciple and whosoever does not bear his
[37:18] cross and come after me cannot be my
[37:21] disciple for which of you intending to
[37:24] build a tower Seth not down first and
[37:27] count the cost whether you have
[37:29] sufficient to finish it less happenly
[37:32] after you've laid the foundation and is
[37:34] not able to finish it and all that be
[37:37] behold begin to mock him saying this man
[37:40] be to build and was not able to finish
[37:44] or what king go to war make war against
[37:47] another king sth not down first and
[37:50] consult us whether he be able to with
[37:52] 10,000 to meet him that cometh against
[37:55] him with 20,000 or else while the other
[37:58] is yet a great way off he sendeth an
[38:01] ambassage and desireth conditions of
[38:04] Peace So likewise whosoever he be of you
[38:08] that forsaketh not all that he hath he
[38:10] cannot be my
[38:12] disciple amen we let you be
[38:16] seated this
[38:20] evening like to speak to you on faith to
[38:24] win amen I believe we are winners
[38:28] and I believe that's what we've been
[38:29] sitting here to do you know I I just
[38:31] reading this scripture Jesus speaking
[38:34] about a man who to intended to build a
[38:37] tower and Seth not down first and cth
[38:40] the cost whether he have sufficient to
[38:43] finish it l happily after he laid the
[38:45] foundation is not able to finish all
[38:48] that behold to be behold it began to
[38:50] mock him and you know a mind goes to
[38:52] that church that's been been sitting
[38:54] there on the side of the road there just
[38:56] going between men and C
[38:58] how many wonder how many has wondered
[38:59] why it's sitting in the condition that
[39:01] it's sitting unfinished and you know the
[39:04] scaffold's been put up and the Rocks
[39:07] been laid and the bricks been done
[39:09] different things but it's slowly rotten
[39:11] him back down because it was never
[39:13] finished and I I believe that he God
[39:17] would not say this about us if it didn't
[39:19] also pertain to him that he also has
[39:22] looking and made sure that he had enough
[39:24] Mercy had enough Grace had enough love
[39:27] love had enough Holy Spirit to finish
[39:30] the building that he started amen he's
[39:32] he's not going to uh put us under a
[39:35] certain law without him himself also
[39:38] abiding under the same law so therefore
[39:41] he's going to make sure that he has
[39:43] enough to finish and I'm thankful for
[39:45] that because we're living in the
[39:47] finished time and that's what we have
[39:49] been putting been put here for for it
[39:51] isn't but you know in this time that
[39:53] we're living in it's not really he that
[39:56] starts it's that
[39:58] finishes uh and it isn't he who starts a
[40:01] house or starts a building or or starts
[40:03] something but it's it's it's in the
[40:05] finishing of it that the glory is there
[40:08] uh you know and the only winner of the
[40:10] race that we're in is the one who
[40:12] finishes it's not the one who just cross
[40:15] that that starts a race but doesn't
[40:17] cross the line he may have started out
[40:19] and ran just as fast or faster than
[40:21] anybody else that could run or or seemed
[40:24] like to have more endurance but along
[40:25] somewhere he I fell away and he didn't
[40:28] finish therefore he did not win amen we
[40:31] we're here to cross the finish line amen
[40:34] that we're here to cross the finish line
[40:35] so it's not just about beginning it's
[40:38] about finishing to win I I know we know
[40:40] we live in the time you know of of of a
[40:43] lot of participation trophies you know
[40:45] you you you participate in something
[40:47] they do this with a lot of the little
[40:48] kids if they participate they all get a
[40:51] trophy well we're not all going to get a
[40:53] trophy unless we finish the race amen
[40:56] and you know athletes they they they
[40:58] train and they train and they run they
[41:00] lift weights they they beat their bodies
[41:03] into subjection they get up when their
[41:05] body don't want to they eat right when
[41:07] they don't want to they they have goals
[41:10] and that goal is to win they're and all
[41:12] they do all of that to fight for a
[41:14] corruptible Crown they fight for a a
[41:17] corruptible clown Crown maybe it's a a a
[41:20] thing of gold weight around their neck
[41:22] or or something else whatever it is but
[41:24] it's very temporary but they do so much
[41:26] and they put so much in it to get this
[41:29] how much more should we put into this
[41:31] race when we're not fighting for a
[41:33] corruptible crowd or fighting for an
[41:36] Incorruptible crowd amen we're fighting
[41:38] for eternal life and and I believe that
[41:41] God's going to have somebody in this age
[41:43] is going to finish that's going to
[41:45] Across the line and I I'm not just
[41:47] speaking about going across the line by
[41:49] go by by death but he's going to have
[41:51] somebody that's going to finish the word
[41:54] spoken about a body change amen that's
[41:56] going to cross that line that finish
[41:58] line that that line that he has placed
[42:00] there in his word you know there was a
[42:02] man I can't pronounce his name but he
[42:04] was from Tanzania he was a marathon one
[42:07] Runner you probably heard about him but
[42:09] he he had been training his whole life
[42:10] to run this Marathon there in Tanzania
[42:13] and it was actually held there in Mexico
[42:15] City in the 1968 Olympics and and he
[42:18] gets up there and he starts running this
[42:20] uh this race and now where he had
[42:22] trained the climate wasn't the same and
[42:24] he began to cramp up and have some
[42:26] issues and and along the way he fell
[42:28] down and badly wounded himself and and
[42:31] dislocated his knee joint and his
[42:33] shoulder hit the pavement and just
[42:35] really injured and hurt but he just
[42:37] continued to run and you know what he
[42:38] would he would actually would finish the
[42:40] race and he would finish last among 57
[42:44] others that had finished but there had
[42:45] been about 75 that had started and 57
[42:47] that had finished but you know here he
[42:49] finished and and 3 hours and 25 minutes
[42:52] and 27 seconds almost exactly an hour
[42:56] and 5 minutes behind the winter but by
[42:59] the time he came to the Finish Line his
[43:01] knee was bag bag bandaged and he was
[43:04] bleeding and there was only a few people
[43:06] left there in the stadium the sun was
[43:09] setting and you know and a you know
[43:11] television crew had heard about him and
[43:13] they come out to to to see about this
[43:16] one Runner that was going to finish and
[43:18] he finally crossed the finish line and
[43:20] such a cheer came from a very small
[43:22] crowd and and then he was interviewed
[43:24] later and he was asked why he continued
[43:27] running he said my he said these words
[43:29] he said my country did not send me here
[43:32] 5,000 miles to start a race they sent me
[43:35] here 5,000 miles to finish the
[43:38] race amen I believe that we have not put
[43:41] in this been put in this last age this
[43:44] last moments these last marks of time
[43:47] Amen to be ones who quit to be ones who
[43:49] give up to be ones who turn around but
[43:52] we have been sent here not to start the
[43:55] race we have been sent here to finish
[43:57] the race amen Jesus showed us while he
[44:00] was here what it was like to be a
[44:02] finisher he he finished what he was sent
[44:04] to do he was a winner and if we have the
[44:07] spirit of him the same one that finished
[44:10] his race and he sent back his Spirit we
[44:12] will also have the same desires we will
[44:15] also have the same drive we will also
[44:18] have the same thing in our life that we
[44:20] are here to do what God has sent us here
[44:22] to do we are going to fulfill the word
[44:26] that is spoken of us us amen I I brother
[44:29] brother Andrew SP uh Glover actually
[44:31] sent me this quote because he knew I'd
[44:32] been along these lines he sent it to me
[44:34] a few moments ago he said brother BR
[44:36] said when the word has been spoken for
[44:39] this certain generation there's going to
[44:41] be somebody rise on the scene that'll
[44:44] fulfill the word that is spoken because
[44:47] God spoke it and Jesus met every
[44:50] qualification that the word said
[44:52] Vindicated as Messiah exactly there is
[44:55] also words spoken in the Bible for this
[44:59] last days and those words have to come
[45:02] to
[45:03] life amen so as Jesus said I have come
[45:07] to fulfill amen he would say it he would
[45:10] say my meat is to do the will of him
[45:12] that sent me in other words what gives
[45:14] me strength for what I'm doing is I am
[45:17] fulfilling what was spoken of me that's
[45:20] the reason I can endure what I'm
[45:21] enduring that's the reason I can go
[45:23] through what I'm going through that's
[45:24] the reason why I can stand the
[45:26] temptation in the 40 days that's the
[45:28] reason I can stand all the mocking and
[45:30] the and the laughing and the making fun
[45:32] and calling names cuz I'm not I'm not
[45:35] looking at all of that I'm looking at
[45:37] what the word spoke about me and I'm
[45:39] here to fulfill the word spoken about me
[45:43] the mockers they are fulfilling the word
[45:45] spoke of them the critics they are fing
[45:47] fulfilling the word spoke of them but we
[45:49] are here to fulfill the word spoke about
[45:52] the last Runners the finishers of the
[45:55] race amen Jesus said when he would be
[45:57] there at the cross and we know what he
[45:59] had to get to through the garden he said
[46:01] not my will but thy will be done amen
[46:04] when Jesus therefore received the
[46:05] vinegar he said it is
[46:08] finished he had finished what he was
[46:10] sent to do amen you know why because it
[46:13] was words that spoke of him to do and to
[46:16] go through all that he went through he
[46:18] could not have done what he done if
[46:20] there not have been word spoke about
[46:23] that we could not do what we do unless
[46:25] there were words spoken about this
[46:28] generation about this time and and this
[46:31] moment that's why you can go through
[46:32] tremendous pressures and tremendous
[46:35] trials and come on the other side and
[46:37] still be walking towards the finish line
[46:40] or running towards the Finish Line why
[46:42] because there's word spoken about you
[46:44] and that word must be
[46:47] fulfilled amen we know the world that
[46:49] we're living in I I want us I want you
[46:51] to Have Courage the world that you're
[46:53] living in is an overcome world
[46:57] all right Jesus said this he said these
[46:59] things have I spoken to you that in me
[47:02] you might have peace in the world you
[47:04] shall have tribulation but be of good
[47:05] cheer I have overcome the world I have
[47:09] overcome the world that do mean to
[47:11] triumph over to have dominion over to
[47:14] completely overcome to
[47:17] finish amen he has overcome the world so
[47:19] if he has overcome the world all the
[47:22] things in the world are
[47:25] overcome amen if if he broke the back of
[47:28] Satan and Satan is nothing but a bluff
[47:31] then everything under Satan is nothing
[47:33] but a bluff amen he he has no power he
[47:35] has no Dominion he said he he he has won
[47:39] so you can also win that's Hallelujah
[47:42] you have the spirit of the of a winner
[47:45] on the inside of you not the spirit of a
[47:48] loser a spirit of a
[47:50] winner in this race of life it's not
[47:54] crossing the line first that determines
[47:56] your winner is making sure you cross the
[48:00] line is making sure sure you you know
[48:03] you're going to have hard times you're
[48:05] going to we're go we're going to go
[48:06] through difficulties even after being in
[48:09] the atmosphere of great meetings how how
[48:11] many's already went through trials and
[48:13] hardships and mind battles and things
[48:15] but you know we need to still yet make
[48:17] this determination I'm going to cross
[48:20] the finish
[48:23] line brother brand spoke about a boy
[48:26] that was
[48:28] by you know the swin bicycle was going
[48:29] to win that bicycle and there was a lot
[48:31] of other guys that was way more
[48:33] qualified than he was to win it they had
[48:35] done they could do things brother ER
[48:36] Baxter was telling him said he said I
[48:38] could go downtown and get my mother's
[48:40] groceries put them under my arms come
[48:42] down through the streets up around cars
[48:44] never touch my handlebars I could ride
[48:47] sit backwards on it ride just the same
[48:49] as I could ride forwards didn't make no
[48:51] difference to me neither neither neither
[48:54] nearly all of them were great Riders and
[48:57] they were sure they were going to win
[48:58] that swin bicycle but they had this one
[49:01] little fell didn't look like much he
[49:03] wasn't really a good Rider and they he
[49:06] ain't going to win he ain't got a chance
[49:09] but when they put them all on the track
[49:11] and started them out everyone fell off
[49:14] but this little
[49:16] boy he rode right out to the end got off
[49:19] and it received a new
[49:21] bicycle and all the other ones are like
[49:23] well tell me how you done that and boy
[49:25] he said boys I'm going to tell you where
[49:27] you made your mistake I thought it all
[49:29] out before I got on there he said he
[49:31] said you see you were all trying to keep
[49:33] on the keep the bicycle on the board cuz
[49:36] they took this about a one foot board
[49:37] and they had put it about 3ot in the air
[49:39] and they had to ride the plank you know
[49:41] and ride down through there and he said
[49:43] what your problem was you was looking
[49:44] around you looking at the how how far
[49:47] you had to fall or how close you was to
[49:49] the edge he said I didn't do that he
[49:51] said because that made all of you
[49:52] nervous you got the wiggling around you
[49:54] fell off and he said I've seen that's
[49:56] you made your mistake he said but I
[49:58] never look down there I look to the end
[50:02] yes sir and he said I look to the end
[50:04] and kept steady he said that's it watch
[50:07] to the end and keep
[50:11] steady keep steady keep moving on I you
[50:15] said I'd be discouraged tonight if I
[50:17] wasn't if it wasn't that I was watching
[50:19] to the end and I just keep steady
[50:22] because why I'm not looking at the
[50:24] failures around me I'm not looking at
[50:26] those that are falling off I'm not
[50:28] looking at the fall beside me I'm
[50:30] looking to Jesus the author and the
[50:33] finisher of my faith and just keep
[50:35] looking to the end that's where you're
[50:38] going to cross the

[56:15] our loved ones this is what we are
[56:17] training for this is what we're running
[56:19] for this is what we're fighting for on a
[56:21] Wednesday
[56:24] night 1 Corinthians 9:24 says know ye
[56:28] not that they which run in a race run
[56:30] all but one receiveth the prize so run
[56:33] that you may obtain the one who's going
[56:35] to receive it the one who crosses the
[56:37] Finish
[56:39] Line every man that striveth for the
[56:42] Mastery is tempered in all things but
[56:44] they that do it to obtain a corruptible
[56:46] Crown but we an Incorruptible I
[56:48] therefore so run not as uncertainly so
[56:51] fight as I not as one that beateth the
[56:53] air but I keep under my body and
[56:55] bringing it into into subjection least
[56:57] by any means that I have preached to
[56:58] others and myself should be a Castaway
[57:01] amen second Timothy 4:6 for I am now
[57:03] ready to be offered and the time of my
[57:05] departure is hand I have fought a good
[57:07] fight I have finished my course I have
[57:10] kept the faith henceforth there's laid
[57:12] up for me a crown of righteousness which
[57:14] the Lord the righteous judge shall give
[57:16] me at that day and not to me only but
[57:19] unto all of them also that love his
[57:25] appearing so I I got to reading about
[57:28] people who run races and people who are
[57:30] winners you know the way to first become
[57:33] a winner is to lose the loser
[57:42] mentality for for Israel for years they
[57:45] what they deal with slave mentality
[57:47] that's right well I'm just for nobody's
[57:51] Lord and they actually use the people
[57:54] use their loser mentality as humility
[57:57] no it's loser
[57:59] mentality amen get rid of it well what
[58:03] is some okay I'm glad you asked what's
[58:05] some loser mentality I help you out
[58:06] there blame others when you
[58:09] fall refuse to change when you're
[58:11] presented with the evidence and the
[58:13] truth that you're wrong don't learn from
[58:15] your mistakes have a my way or the
[58:17] highway
[58:20] attitude choosing and I stand up for
[58:23] truth and
[58:24] righteousness I fail there's nothing I
[58:26] can do failure is the end of the road
[58:29] for a
[58:30] loser but not for a winner we just heard
[58:33] about it he got up and he kept
[58:36] going so I got to looking at winners and
[58:39] losers and the difference and the
[58:41] difference of their mentality it was a
[58:43] coach that actually wrote this to his
[58:44] team and he said a winner is always
[58:46] ready to tackle something new a loser is
[58:50] prone to believe it can't be
[58:52] done a winner makes mistakes and says
[58:55] I'm wrong a loser makes mistakes and
[58:57] says it wasn't my fault and blame
[58:59] someone
[59:01] else a winner is challenged by problems
[59:04] but goes through it a loser never wants
[59:07] to face it and always goes around it but
[59:09] never gets by
[59:12] it always circling around the same thing
[59:15] a winner realizes there's no time like
[59:18] the present to get the job done a loser
[59:20] is prone to procrastinate with hopes
[59:23] that things will be better
[59:25] tomorrow
[59:27] yeah I know it's we we'll get past this
[59:29] in a
[59:30] minute a winner thinks positive acts
[59:34] positive lives
[59:37] positive a loser usually has a negative
[59:40] attitude and a negative approach to
[59:43] everything a winner says let's find out
[59:46] a loser says nobody
[59:51] knows a winner makes commitments a loser
[59:55] makes imp empty
[59:59] promises so that right there that
[1:00:01] statement right there tell you God's a
[1:00:03] winner
[1:00:06] sir amen God's a winner a winner says
[1:00:09] I'm good but I'm not as good as I should
[1:00:12] be a loser says I'm not as bad as a lot
[1:00:15] of other people
[1:00:20] are amen a winner lose learns from those
[1:00:24] who are superior a loser tries to tear
[1:00:27] down those who are
[1:00:32] superior
[1:00:35] amen
[1:00:40] hallelujah you know I I I just seen
[1:00:42] something earlier I was sent it to
[1:00:45] brother Andrew we was
[1:00:46] talking and it was just a saying says be
[1:00:50] careful who you let on your
[1:00:52] ship said because if they can't be the
[1:00:54] captain many times they want to sing
[1:00:56] it and that's the
[1:00:58] truth you better make sure it's Jesus
[1:01:01] you're letting on your
[1:01:03] ship amen a winner says I'm good but I'm
[1:01:07] not as good as I should be a loser said
[1:01:08] I'm not as bad as a lot of other people
[1:01:10] amen a winner Works harder than a loser
[1:01:12] and has more time a loser is always too
[1:01:15] busy to do what's
[1:01:20] necessary I'm not preaching at
[1:01:23] nobody I'm preaching to winners and
[1:01:25] losers
[1:01:26] losers amen I hope the more winners than
[1:01:29] we got
[1:01:30] losers a winner says he's sorry by
[1:01:33] making up for it a loser says I'm sorry
[1:01:35] but does the same thing the next
[1:01:38] time a winner knows what to fight for
[1:01:41] and what to compromise on a loser
[1:01:43] compromises on what he shouldn't and
[1:01:45] fights for what isn't worth fighting
[1:01:48] about a winner listens a loser just
[1:01:51] wants his turn to talk a winner feels
[1:01:54] responsible for more than his job a
[1:01:56] loser says I only work
[1:02:00] here Bo a lot to learn from winners and
[1:02:03] losers a winner says there ought to be a
[1:02:05] better way to do it a loser said this is
[1:02:07] the way it's always been
[1:02:09] done a winner works hard to achieve his
[1:02:12] goals a loser just gets by a winner is
[1:02:15] always part of the answer a loser is
[1:02:17] always part of the
[1:02:19] problem a winner always has a plan a
[1:02:22] loser always has an excuse a winner says
[1:02:25] let let me do it a loser said that's not
[1:02:27] my job a winner says sees an answer to
[1:02:30] every problem a loser sees a problem for
[1:02:33] every
[1:02:34] answer a winner says it may be difficult
[1:02:37] but it's possible a loser says it may be
[1:02:39] possible but it's too
[1:02:42] difficult oh winners have dreams losers
[1:02:44] have schemes winners say I must do
[1:02:47] something losers say something must be
[1:02:52] done winners are part of a team losers
[1:02:56] are apart from the
[1:03:00] team did you hear that maybe I'll read
[1:03:02] that one again winners are part of the
[1:03:04] team losers are aart from the
[1:03:10] team winners see gain losers see pain
[1:03:14] winners see possibilities losers see
[1:03:16] problems winners believe in winwin
[1:03:19] losers believe in them to win and
[1:03:21] somebody for them to win somebody has to
[1:03:23] lose winners see potential Los users see
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:28] past now this one right here took me
[1:03:30] just a minute to get but boy when it got
[1:03:33] so wo winners are like a thermostat
[1:03:38] losers are like a
[1:03:45] thermometer that that thermostat over
[1:03:47] there what does it do it controls the
[1:03:50] atmosphere so if they set it at 72 you
[1:03:53] better it better stay at 72 or
[1:03:55] something's wrong with the machine
[1:03:56] behind it but that thing is set there to
[1:03:58] set an atmosphere a thermometer does
[1:04:00] what it goes up and down with the
[1:04:03] atmosphere amen so I believe the
[1:04:05] children of God ought to be
[1:04:07] thermostats amen we ought to set
[1:04:10] atmospheres and and the atmosphere is
[1:04:12] not to be set low it's to be set High
[1:04:14] into the heavenlies because that's where
[1:04:16] we're called to be amen seated together
[1:04:18] with Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so
[1:04:21] we don't come as a thermometer to church
[1:04:23] and we're up and down with with us no
[1:04:25] we're set in the atmosphere that's right
[1:04:27] I come here to praise God I come here to
[1:04:30] worship God I come here to give him
[1:04:32] glory I come to give him praise got
[1:04:35] nothing to do with anybody
[1:04:44] else winers say do unto others as you'd
[1:04:48] have them do unto you losers say do it
[1:04:50] to others before they do it to
[1:04:54] you win choose what they say losers say
[1:04:58] what they
[1:05:02] choose and speak you know we know words
[1:05:05] have
[1:05:07] power and you
[1:05:10] know our and brother brand would teach
[1:05:13] this over and over and Bible teaches it
[1:05:15] about our
[1:05:16] confession that we must confess that he
[1:05:19] is the high priest that can be touched
[1:05:22] that our confession must be a positive
[1:05:25] confession
[1:05:26] he would say your mental attitude toward
[1:05:28] the promises of God will bring it to
[1:05:29] pass the right mental attitude so amen
[1:05:32] what is it it's producing an atmosphere
[1:05:36] change that you're not just sitting in
[1:05:38] your pity and sitting in the problems
[1:05:40] and sitting in all of this but you're
[1:05:42] getting
[1:05:43] up and you're setting the
[1:05:46] atmosphere I'm not going to be in a Pity
[1:05:49] atmosphere of pity I'm not going to be
[1:05:51] in an atmosphere of delusion I'm not
[1:05:53] going to be in an atmosphere of
[1:05:54] despondency I'm going to rise up above
[1:05:58] that so how do you do it you start
[1:06:00] speaking the word of
[1:06:04] God Amen and what does the word of God
[1:06:06] say in Philippians 4 I can do all
[1:06:10] things see first off you got to get the
[1:06:12] C out of your life I can't do this I
[1:06:15] can't be that that's the devil's
[1:06:17] language amen you can God's languages
[1:06:20] you can I can I will I do believe I can
[1:06:24] do all things John for says I am born of
[1:06:27] God and I have World overcoming Faith
[1:06:30] residing on the inside of
[1:06:33] me because it's the same Faith Jesus had
[1:06:36] and he overcame the world and he put the
[1:06:38] same spirit that was on the inside of
[1:06:41] his body inside of his bride and they
[1:06:43] can have that same
[1:06:45] Faith to rise up and overcome every
[1:06:48] devil in
[1:06:52] hell Colossians says I let the peace of
[1:06:55] God rule my heart and I refuse to worry
[1:06:59] about
[1:07:05] anything Proverbs 3 says TR TR I will
[1:07:09] trust in the Lord with all my heart and
[1:07:12] I will not lean into my own
[1:07:17] understanding Isaiah 54 says no weapon
[1:07:20] formed against me shall prosper every
[1:07:22] tongue formed against me shall be
[1:07:24] condemned
[1:07:27] Revelations 12:11 says I am an
[1:07:32] overcomer and I have overcame him by the
[1:07:34] blood of the lamb and the word of my
[1:07:38] testimony yes sir there he goes again
[1:07:41] your confession the word of your
[1:07:42] testimony Psalms 46 says God is my
[1:07:46] refuge and strength he is my well proven
[1:07:48] help in the time of trouble Romans 8
[1:07:50] says no in all these things we are more
[1:07:53] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:07:55] us first John 4 says greater is he that
[1:07:57] is in me than he that's in the world
[1:08:01] Amen because he has overcame the
[1:08:09] world you know the prophet of God in the
[1:08:12] Bible
[1:08:13] Elijah went to visit a king who was
[1:08:16] surrounded by
[1:08:17] enemy and he was going to give him a way
[1:08:20] of
[1:08:20] Escape so he says what do you got there

[1:08:47] ground and him and his loser mentality

[1:21:05] things and yesterday he used to do this
[1:21:06] and yesterday and yesterday but they
[1:21:08] won't bring him present tense which puts
[1:21:11] the fire back on the altar

[1:21:16] it's a fire that's got some heat to it
[1:21:18] and let me tell you if you touch it

[1:21:27] Fire well go try to touch a natural fire
[1:21:30] and tell me if you don't have some kind
[1:21:32] of sensation if you don't you're a dead

[1:21:46] little bit on the inside of you you can
[1:21:48] be acting like you're

[1:21:56] it something going to
[1:21:58] happen there going to be a scream there

[1:22:01] sensation tears running whatever it is
[1:22:04] something's going to
[1:22:09] happen we don't have a historical God we
[1:22:13] have the one that's the same yesterday
[1:22:14] today and
[1:22:17] forever and he ain't dependent on some
[1:22:21] denomination he's dependent upon his
[1:22:23] word well how can I join this church

[1:22:34] born to the that's the only way you can
[1:22:35] be part of the family be born of the
[1:22:40] family but he said the the arrow of
[1:22:43] Deliverance is filled with Mercy

[1:22:49] to do is pick it up and Strike It For
[1:22:51] the Glory of God every divine blessing
[1:22:54] that God promises Yours by faith if
[1:22:56] you'll receive it do you believe it I
[1:22:58] believe it's the light of God's word and
[1:23:00] God promised here he would do a certain
[1:23:02] thing and he does it every time he's
[1:23:05] taken at his
[1:23:08] word it's the light of God this word is
[1:23:10] a light you cannot put out the
[1:23:16] light I tell you I was really amazed we
[1:23:19] got to go up into Arkansas and see the
[1:23:22] eclipse few minutes that it took place
[1:23:25] there it was quite a quite a thing to
[1:23:27] witness but you had these special
[1:23:29] glasses cuz you you know you can't look
[1:23:30] at the sun you look at the sun your
[1:23:32] eyeballs are going to get put out but
[1:23:34] you put these special glasses on and you
[1:23:35] can look up at the Sun and you can see
[1:23:38] it you see it's burning you see the
[1:23:40] flares coming off of it and all of a
[1:23:42] sudden we started seeing the shadow move
[1:23:44] across it and you know it got down to
[1:23:46] just a little bitty sliver I'm talking
[1:23:49] about I thought oh man I can see that I
[1:23:51] can look
[1:23:52] now about put my eyes out just a little
[1:23:56] as small as
[1:23:57] sliver I mean just barely he peeking out
[1:24:01] around there and it's still you couldn't
[1:24:03] look at it and then the moon moved over
[1:24:05] in totality for the three minutes or
[1:24:07] whatever and it but it still didn't put
[1:24:09] out the
[1:24:11] light the light was still shining the
[1:24:14] light was still moving yes it was darker
[1:24:16] where we were sitting but there was
[1:24:18] still
[1:24:19] light it was completely blocked off but
[1:24:22] there was still light
[1:24:25] boy I couldn't help but think about our
[1:24:27] God who we have been given special
[1:24:29] anointing to be able to look into his
[1:24:31] presence and not be blinded by but we
[1:24:33] can see him in his glory see him in his
[1:24:36] power see him in his resurrection amen
[1:24:39] it doesn't take but just a little
[1:24:42] bit hallelujah amen in this service
[1:24:46] tonight it doesn't take but just a
[1:24:47] little bit of his glory to drop in and
[1:24:50] all worries will fade away all stress
[1:24:54] will move away and you won't want to
[1:24:55] leave his
[1:24:58] presence and the devil can block it out
[1:25:01] completely if he wants to but I'm here
[1:25:03] to put him on notice as that sun was
[1:25:05] still shining and it was completely
[1:25:07] blocked out you couldn't see any any
[1:25:09] physical part of it amen but you can see
[1:25:11] a little flare here or there but oh
[1:25:13] still light beaming all around that's
[1:25:16] right Hallelujah devil you can't put out
[1:25:19] this
[1:25:20] light you can try to block it you can
[1:25:22] try to cover it up you you can try to do
[1:25:25] whatever you want to but it's still
[1:25:26] going to shine it's still going to go
[1:25:29] forth cuz it's a
[1:25:33] winter ain't enough Devils to put it

[1:28:08] winners we are going to
[1:28:12] override what happens when you
[1:28:16] override it goes over the boundary
[1:28:19] set in the beginning so if if you have
[1:28:22] something there I was used this before
[1:28:25] but I was in brother dereck's shop one
[1:28:27] day and his bag sealer went
[1:28:30] out and it was we he was well guess I'm
[1:28:34] about to get another one well I got to
[1:28:36] looking at it sister Ruth was there we
[1:28:39] got to digging into it I had happen to
[1:28:41] have a vote meter and I got to look into
[1:28:42] this you know what had happened the
[1:28:45] emergency stop Button had went out as
[1:28:48] emergency stop button that if things get
[1:28:50] out of control you know he hit it and it
[1:28:52] shuts the machine off I said said do you
[1:28:54] need this emergency stop button he said
[1:28:56] no I said well we're going to override
[1:28:58] it I clipped the wires on it bypassed it
[1:29:01] machine started working again just
[1:29:03] perfectly why cuz I went past the
[1:29:05] boundaries it had set and see the devil
[1:29:09] wants to put boundaries upon your life
[1:29:12] he loves to have an emergency stop
[1:29:13] button in your life to where he can push
[1:29:15] it and you can only go so far you can
[1:29:17] only do so much if you get out of hand
[1:29:19] you know remember when you used to do
[1:29:22] this all right remember who you used to
[1:29:26] be but if you'll get the Holy
[1:29:29] Ghost you know what'll happen he'll go
[1:29:31] in there and he'll clip those
[1:29:34] wires and he'll wire them up correctly
[1:29:37] and they'll flow the power will flow
[1:29:39] correctly and it'll bypass his buttons
[1:29:41] it'll bypass what he can
[1:29:44] do I'm looking at a people that the
[1:29:47] devil has been bypassed in their life
[1:29:50] has been
[1:29:53] overrode some of you said you was going
[1:29:55] to be nothing but druggies and drunkers
[1:29:57] and out of the street prostitutes
[1:30:00] whatever he said you wasn't going to be
[1:30:01] nothing but a low down lousy sinner but
[1:30:04] the Holy Ghost came in the room and it
[1:30:06] changed the wiring and it went past what
[1:30:09] he had and his
[1:30:12] plans he thought he had a stop button on
[1:30:15] sister lant's life and he's going to
[1:30:17] push it and ended all but the Holy
[1:30:19] Spirit came in the room and he bypassed
[1:30:22] what he had done and he took it back
[1:30:24] back to what it should
[1:30:26] be come on somebody I'm talking about a
[1:30:30] people that has Faith to win Faith to
