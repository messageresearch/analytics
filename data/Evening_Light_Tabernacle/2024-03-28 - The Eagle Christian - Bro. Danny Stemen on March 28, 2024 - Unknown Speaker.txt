and every heart and you don't want to wait till the last service you want to make every service count we don't know how many more times we'll be able to meet together till we get to go to that eternal camp in the sky amen but we're going we're preparing we want to be ready to leave this world Amen I'm going to let you be seated for a minute as I just give you some greetings and some instructions and M is so good to see everybody again and have this privilege of serving the lord together this weekend we got some of the very best young people in the whole wide world Amen it's all because of Jesus am man and the good things that he does for us and I uh wanted just to tell you you know of course Camp doesn't come without its rules and so I have to have the be the one to make you know to to give the rules and let you know uh so that everybody can have a good time and uh you know rules are are good you know because it gives us a little order and we um know what our boundaries are and we can understand those those boundaries and we're safe within boundaries God gives us boundaries in his word and even in his word we're with these boundaries we are safe and so um you know we we of course um will be announcing time to go to your dorms um tonight after the service is complete and whatever so we will be announcing the times for you to go to your dorms the gator Patrol is in charge of that give me a little time to fellowship and and get a little something from maybe from the snack room or whatever and so uh we'll be sending you announcing those time sending you to your dorms we're going to ask you to go directly there when when you're told and also uh that you remain in the dorms until you're T told time to get up and uh you know as I said you're some of the best there is and I I want to say I I appreciate the wonderful camps that we've had in the past and and so many of them now that has passed along and not a not a not a problem not a an issue got a little tiny issue come up um I was told about that the camp asked me to tell you please don't be flushing the the um the the the napkins and the paper towels so please uh don't do that you know it's it's not funny stopping up the toilets so let's don't do that and uh let's have a good reputation here here as uh as good good people that love the Lord and and do unto others as we'd have them do unto us so I'm expecting you to do that and uh that there will not be any more of that happened and I also want to tell you you know your counselor came and gave up a maybe vacation time took off from work drove hours spent their money to come and be here and uh without them I can't have Camp you can imagine just a bunch of young people and there's no counselors here I I wouldn't be able to have Camp without them so don't give them a difficult time you know show yourself as Christian young people and and be uh polite and and uh you know kind they're going to be kind to you and show respect to you um and you also I want you to show respect back to them and I know you will I have that much confidence in you because you're just that kind of people so um we're going to have uh during the meeting it's going to be your meeting so there's going to be special songs and don't wait till the last service to say hey I got a special you know let's get it in and and uh if you want to have a special song We'll let brother Timothy know brother Michael Dexter he's uh there in the back and so U you you can see one of them are the gator Patrol um and um you just let let some of of us know that you have a special song If you have a prayer request just lay it on the pulpit here and we will we will uh pray for that and um we believe the Lord will just meet the needs of God's people also uh you know the campground is large as many acres and really really don't want you going out into the woods unsupervised so unless that we have organized um uh super supervised walks and and uh uh trips through the woods well we we'd like for you to kind of just stay up around in this area unless that we do that we do have as I tell you every year and and it is also spring so you know snakes are out we have all five of the um the major poisonous snakes here in Louisiana and uh you know as as I've explained um they they can be dangerous also um for you youngest guys that likes to go catch frogs in the pond those um are sewer ponds so don't play in the sewer um did you get it if you don't I'll explain that to you if you didn't get it some of you blondes may wait till tomorrow but anyway you know you know if you're um a registered camper here um of course you're staying off the grounds with your parents that's a whole different situation we do not allow uh young people to stay out and just take in motels around with in unsupervised situations but if you're here with your parents this doesn't apply to you but if you're a registered camper on the grounds we don't want you leave in the grounds without letting some of us know so you're to be here and be because we're responsible for you and we don't know who uncle so and so is that might be meeting and picking you up so you know we don't want none of that happening you're here your parents sent you here to be here on the campgrounds so do not leave the campgrounds without letting some of us know you know um we uh we believe that it's good for a man not to touch a woman especially if they're not married you know so we don't want you pairing off you know of course if you got to hold Sweetie Pie's hand just get a stick one of you on one one side of the stick and on the other and so get your stick you can walk around holding the stick unless you got a rock on her finger well that may be a little different you know every every church has its rules and pastors and this is acceptable and that's acceptable and it ain't acceptable but um you know here on Camp that's kind of what our rules are is um you know that um you know you just don't pair off and and and go out away from here and then holding hands with each other unless you have a rock on the finger so you know you kind of get the idea of what I want and uh we're going to have a good time and you know if we follow the rules well you don't get in any trouble and uh I don't want any trouble it don't make me happy and don't make Jesus happy and don't make your mom and dad happy and don't make you happy I want you to be happy so we'll have a good time together we're we're going to have a great camp and the Lord's going to do some mighty mighty things in this meeting

privilege Lord to speak to Children Of God may you anoint my lips anoint the ears of the he for we ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this evening it's certainly a privilege to be here and to be part of Youth Camp amen we want to thank brother Tim and amen for having us here it's been many years I don't know how long you've had the camp we was trying to figure out today but it's it's went on a long time I think it's safe to say most of you that are here were not here uh when it's started at all and uh but you're here now and it tells a couple things amen it tells that God is still moving still dealing with hearts and he also amen has has testimonies before you of people that are still here amen and so amen we we thank brother Tim and his family and his church has always been wonderful friends and we love them and and their fellowship and brother Ron we have a lot of memories and uh we'll go into those later but uh we just counted a privilege to be with you and as I said I know it's the first night and you're tired amen but you can help me and I can help you we can both get oursel out of the way believe God will speak to us you believe that you're turn in your Bibles to Isaiah 40 and verse 27 31 we're going to read there and then we're going to turn to Deuteronomy 32 but Isaiah 40 and verse 27 why sayest thou oh Jacob and speakest thou oh Israel my way is hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over from my God hast thou not known and hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth Feth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to the him them that have no might he increases strength even the you shall shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen I just also would like you to turn Deuteronomy 32:9 if you have it say amen amen for the Lord's portion is his people isin't that a wonderful statement amen God says you are what I want you are what I have chosen you are who I deal with now notice he owns the whole Earth but he says you're my portion Jacob is a lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling Wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle stirreth up her nest flutter over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beare him on her wings so the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him you may be seated the Lord bless the reading of his word I would like to title this this morning or this morning whatever time it is amen everybody obviously thinks it's over amen but uh I want to title this evening uh the eagle Christian the eagle Christian God Likens his children his Heritage unto Eagles we're familiar with how often brother Brandon would uh speak of this and I may bring some of those things up to you at some point but God Likens not only his Heritage to E eagles which is you he Likens himself to an eagle I had got interested here a while back and was studying on the nature and and the habits of eagles and some of what I found I I I want to bring to you I I will be speaking specifically about two classes of eagle that you might be familiar with and most likely when Moses was writing this he was referring to these eagles which was the golden eagle and the and the uh Imperial Eagle but brother bandam said that his first Bible was nature uh he said in nature you can see God expressing himself in the universe you could see it he mentioned the flowers he mentioned the seasons he mentioned the cycle of of of spring summer fall winter and then there's a resurrection again amen he he he said you can see God and that's where uh uh you can see him unfold himself and unfold his nature when we go back to the beginning and we see that in in Genesis 1 and two and so forth when he is bringing forth uh plant life and animal life and marine life amen the economy of God Amen provided a place for that life to come forth he provided an earth he provided he provided a ground he he provided he provided an atmosphere where that seed could come now there was something in that seed before it had ever got in that atmosphere and what was in that seed was the spoken word of God which made that seed an attribute of God before before it was ever in Earth it was in his mind and after it came from his mind it came out of his mouth the first light that was ever given amen the beginning was not the sunlight but it was the spoken word and the spoken word said let there be it didn't matter how long it was going to take amen you know if you're a parent here and youve prayed for your child the word of God has already said let there be it didn't matter how long it was going to take it had to happen because it did not start on Earth It Started From God praise the name of the Lord amen so he provided he provided a place for that seed to come forth amen and then he provided the atmosphere to reveal amen what was in that seed amen the atmosphere must be there first to reveal in order for Life to Come brother bam said when he when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it you see amen this is the first night there's a lot of different situations have walked into this room but I'm not preaching to what I see because God has designed the word amen to have a certain effect beyond the exterior and and you may not realize it but what you have inside of you tonight is stronger than what's on the outside now he said that God put that seed in there with the potentials that it would be what he said it would be he put that seed there with the potential of what it would be the only reason the seed would not come come forth and and show that potential is because it was never in the right place as long as it would stay in its right category it would be exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way cuz he made it that way and he made a channel that if it stays in his channel in his line of word it will bring forth exactly what his word said it would be it cannot move from there it's channeled exactly right so with everything in the trust in his own son that it' be that way God said it's all good I'll rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be oh my amen that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be notice what the prophet is saying not what you want to be but what he wants you to be now amen what expresses that seed is the anointing that comes upon it it takes the water of his word to express the seed that's in you all right amen the anointing water brings forth the seed and whatever that seed is it will be revealed praise the name of the Lord amen that's why I'm not preaching to cows tonight humans bring forth humans cows bring forth cows pigs bring forth pigs come on then there's something a little higher than a human amen that's a human with the spirit of God in him amen then you will reflect what that potential is on the inside of you Hallelujah hey I'm just like you tonight I'm I'm traveling too all right we're all getting here we're all getting here all right we find whatever that seed is it will be revealed we find that God would take His prophets and he would take them amen he wouldn't take them into the cities he would take them into the wild and and there he would teach them about his nature and what he wanted to be the Bible calls His prophets Eagles Eagles are uh prophets are eagles now amen he he would teach them we can see in John the Baptist and so forth that that he would teach them even the very Spirit of the things that they would face that would be in opposition of their message and God God would show them that amen when when John the Baptist came out of the Wilderness he'd been since a child he'd been out there when he comes out at the age of 30 and he begins to see these these Pharisees and this system that is confronting him and challenging him he called them amen snakes and he saw what they were like he had seen them before because God had already taught him he had given him discernment Amen to be able to see the spirit of the thing amen so we can see with Moses for instance how God met him and he taught him in the desert he first attracted his attention as an old man he attracted his attention by the burning bush and commissioned him to go back into Egypt and confront pharaoh to let my people go amen Moses was born A Gifted boy he already had the gift of faith in him the prophet said he was already there the equipment to be a deliverer was there amen all the teaching of his mother never brought that uh that that uh that out in him amen all the all all the wisdom of Egypt never brought it out in him it was when he failed it was when he became a failure it was when he forgot about Victory and thought it's no more God can't use me anymore amen when he become an old man it was then God attracted his attention you can do something this Mo this evening that Moses did not do is you can see God and be attracted by God at a young age and that God Amen can attract you by the pillar of fire in a bush and it caught him and it was there when he was caught amen that what was in him was quickened praise the name of the Lord amen all of his understanding of what God wanted to do all of his understanding of the promise to Abraham none of that quickened the seed that was in him it took God and God Alone to bring that out in him and I want to just say this it's going to take more than wisdom to bring out in you what God has placed there amen because what God places there takes God himself to bring that out amen and notice what God placed in him was not a toy it was not there for him to to just use it when he wanted to it was not a luxury what God placed in him was needful for The Exodus amen amen what God places in youen is needful for this hour brother bam said in Satan's eeden that the spirit of God is not something schooled into you it's something pred destinated into you I I want to I want to stop and ask you if you're awake I want I want to ask you could you believe that this moment is predestinated you say well I didn't really plan it well but I'm not talking about you're planning you you would find in Scripture that God hardly waited on your planning in fact he done it when you weren't ready he done it when you was at your worst amen amen he didn't he didn't have Abraham have Isaac when when Abraham could do it he waited till he couldn't do it he waited till he got to his end then he visited Sarah according to the time of life hey there's there's baren wombs in here amen there's there's people haven't Bor anything in their church for years but God said it's time now to bring to life what is inside of you it's time amen that your joy will come forth amen out of Sorrow it's not something schooled into you it's something God predestines into you this age is predestinated this hour is predestinated this message is predestinated the the messenger's predestinated but you're random you're just here by accident we don't know how you got in here amen I don't even know why you're here at camp and some of you looking at me like you don't know why you're here either you're the perfect candidate for God to do something with your experiences cannot be schooled or taught into you it's predestinated by God's hand and God's forn knowledge into you so it's Moses amen who pinned these words in Deuteronomy that he would liken the relationship between God and his people to that of eagles in Exodus 19 God told Moses said you have seen you have seen what I did to the Egyptians yeah I I I I saw I I saw what you did you absolutely took the the strongest most advanced power on Earth and destroyed them you saw what I did to the Egyptians you see what I do to sin you see what I do to Devils you see what i' done to task Masters you know you know it was me that done that you know no man could set you free from those things that I'm the one that done it you have seen what I have done he amen God I I saw what you did see this is Eagle talking to Eagle I I I saw I saw what you did he said how I bear you I carried you brother Joel you did not get here by yourself I carried you to this moment amen where is he trying to carry you I brought you to myself wow I did not just carry you out into a Wilderness to leave you there if you stay in the wilderness it's because you chose to stay there but I carry you to a place in order to bring you to myself thou therefore if you'll obey my voice and deed and keep my Covenant you'll be a peculiar treasure unto me above all my all people all Earth is mine I want you to notice there's the purpose there's the destiny is to bring you to him and the eagle is always a pro prophetic message it was a prophetic message Moses was the eagle it was his message of Deliverance it says it it has brought you to me that's your destiny it's your destiny to be like him brother brandham said that when any believer comes to God I want you to listen he becomes God's attribute of his word that's a high calling now if you were just coming to any church any nominal Church your High Calling may be to sit there where rip jeans try to look like the world be inclusive do whatever you can to to fit in and and welcome anything in but that's not your calling that's not your destiny your Destinies be higher than that your destiny is not to reflect a church it's to reflect God's word and that could mean that could mean God would train you all your life for one moment brother bam said he could train a man 50 years to use him for 5 minutes is that how is that what he said 50 for five something like that it was a long time whatever it was they'll check it out amen he he can train you a long time to use you because that moment is going to be more important to God and in his economy than your education than your career than anything else that moment will have eternal value you may not even understand it brother Gabe it'll be God he said he becomes God's attribute of his word he is used listen this is the eagle of our time he is used to manifest the word that's promised for the day blessed be the name of the Lord we find out that God was so merciful to Moses out there in that Dead Sea in the Red Sea rather that he said in Exodus I carried You On Eagle's Wings I brought you to myself I carry you on eagles's wings and I brought you to myself he said there was other men in the middle of the sea they were trying to impersonate they were trying to cross over but I carried You On Eagle's Wings don't think you crossed that Red Sea by yourself I could have done to the Red Sea what I did to the others but I dried it up for you I made the ground firm it was a door that nobody else could see but I saw it because I'm an eagle and eagle Have Eyes amen what was it amen God always Likens His prophets to Eagles and what was it Moses was his messenger they were following Moses and that was the Eagle's Wings they were carried on because he was packing God's message and the people followed that they were following God as they followed Moses with his message of Deliverance and the Bible said he they perish not with them who believe not why God is rich in Mercy so God In The Exodus is choosing to be identified in the eagle and the eagle is a special built bird he's built to fly higher than any other bird he's built to fly into the heavenlies other birds can't follow the eagle to the heights that he can fly to why the pressure is too great I say it again the pressure is too great yeah we've had a lot of birds that thought they were Eagles flapped out a long time ago amen but there's Eagles still going they're not [Applause] flapping amen pressure is too great for others but the Eagles build for it God God designed the eagle with a nature and equipment to be able to do certain things and calling his own children Eagles he's saying that there I have built you a certain way and I have built you to do certain things now God is not going to say something about his own amen that he's not going to bring them to that place I want to I want to I want to dwell on one aspect for a little bit that that you'll find very relatable did you do this tick talk you did I couldn't hear it back there you just sck talk okay good you didn't know but you know you know Eagles do that you know that yeah we're gonna find out you know how many how many's interested in courtship you married they still interesting course that's great amen anyway um great so an eagle stays in the nest till he's about one years old and then after that this was another sermon after that he's kicked out of the nest and and he begins to learn how to be by himself and to grow up and that takes about a period of about three years after about a period of about 3 years now he's about four years old he he starts becoming inter arrested in in the female and he does something strange um he began to chase her hey I know you're tired but only those old people can relate to that and and he will he will chase her in the game of tag that can actually take days days and at first the the female will show not one bit of interest in her in him not one but after days of being chased she'll go and and she'll get a stick yeah it was that one it proves that all these golden eagles have been to this camp and and she get a stick and she fly as high as eight or 10,000 ft she'll be way up there circling you know and if if that dude is still interested in her here fly up there with her and when she's way up there circling 10,000 feet should drop the stick and there goes you know the love bird and he will swoop down here catch the stick and she' you bring it back to her and she act uninterested it's too much like humans I mean 10,000 ft it's a long ways you know that's when the bell dings on the airplane that's a long ways James and and and then should go get another stick a little bigger a little heavier she won't go as high but she'll fly up and then she'll go a little faster and she'll drop the stick and there goes this boy and he swoops in thereof grabs a stick stick brings it back there her and she shows no interest she'll go get another stick a bigger one fly a little lower a little faster drop it again here you think what in the world she doing make me run all over the place look crazy I what in the world how did God liken that to you any of you ever chased anybody for days picked up things you thought they would be interested in all right well I'm not going where you think I am and then he drop it again and she'd he'd pick it up bring it to her and and finally the last test I guess see this is courtship she'll get a stick a l almost as big as her as heavy as her and she'll fly maybe 500 ft do a little swoop and drop it and if he gets that one she's interested Hallelujah you know why she's doing that I hope you're listening to me real close you wake up now I know you're tired and I hope you understand she's looking at this guy as if if he's going to be my mate she he better be able to catch what falls out of the nest you must know that you got a father all right come on now wake up on me you must know that you got a father no matter how high it is how far it is how fast it is he's going to catch you amen and keep you from falling I want you to know I got a father he will not let me utterly fall he will not let me be destroyed in this age but he has promised to the church I will catch you I I love what the I I love what brother bam said brother Ron when he was watching he said I watched him through my binoculars and he said I I saw I saw her up there when she kicked them out of the nest and then she was teaching them to fly said and they would fall and Tumble through the air he said but she could fly faster than they could [Applause] fall oh my I don't know if you know what I know but I have a God Amen who has come in this age who can fly faster than any Fallen condition he can swoop in to where you're at and catch you I have seen him I have seen him catch every condition come here a minute help me I need a mic I need something this thing falling off amen I need Timothy to catch this when this Falls amen you're not fast enough all right thank you I turned this off I turn is this on okay yes amen a husband that can catch you when you fall is a fit husband is't there something that in nature they'd base it upon falling making sure you can protect my kids amen right the Bible shows us clearly that the anointing God has sent to this last age is the anointing of the Flying Eagle it means if he's flying he's in action he's busy he's flying tonight he's flying through this room there's old dried up dead sticks about ready to hit the ground what he promised the church I'm able to keep you from falling I'm even able to present you spotless and faultless I am a fit mate for you because I am a provider see the church got to know can he provide for me can he feed me amen can he catch me can can he help me build a place amen that that the enemy can't come in do I have that kind of husband ton [Applause] tonight husband that can teach me how to be an eagle because that's what I am you're familiar with the message you're familiar with brother bandoms tell this story over and over and over is Eagle stirreth or Nest who is this MZ many other places in the church age book he talked about predestination the predestinated seed and he typed it amen to you being in a barnyard an eagle in a barnyard eating what was not meant for you you were eating it anyhow yeah you were pinned in eating eating what chickens at and that means if all only example I have is chickens I'm going to try to act like a chicken can you imagine an eagle trying to act like a chicken you imagine an eagle that screams trying to squawk like a chicken come on he didn't know nothing he he didn't know but it wasn't building him to be there but he was there because he was trapped into do it amen but the mother amen the parent knew that she had another one somewhere amen so she begin to fly she begin to look for him Hallelujah she flew over that Barnard and there after all these years this little one laying there saw this Shadow swoop over and looked up and looked right quick at the chicken looked back up and oh my this was something different the one on the ground didn't exactly know what that was but the one in the air knew what the one on the ground was and and when she screamed at him said he looked up you see that's the first Direction you got to begin to look tonight amen you got to know when the call of God is going forth is to redirect your attention from Earthly things to Heavenly things if you're going to be a Heavenly creature you can't be feeding on Earthly things and he directed his attention look up at me and he looked up and and she be to say you're not for that barnyard you were raised you you have something in you see he looked up there said well how do I get up there said just spread your wings and flap them you're going to come well I've never done that before it's cuz your chicken your chicken parent never taught you how to fly you know why I never taught you how to fly cuz they've never Flo but somebody who has can teach you how to fly and the one that knows how to fly knows that what is in you already amen will respond to the anointing that is coming [Applause] across you know brother Bram brother Bram talked about watching watching those Eagles and how they would oh brother Kobe and and he watched them in the nest how they would flutter over them tomorrow night we'll get into that a little bit more but it would flutter over them and then would scream at them and then then then she would blow up FL flap her wings as hard and and just blow on them and then scream at them it look odd brother said he would she was showing them amen how to listen to her voice the most important thing in this hour is for you to know the voice that called you and if you don't know it's God it's going to be taken from you but if you realize it's God that's speaking to you he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church amen she be to scream and they they looked at her and this great being screaming out maybe they were sick and she would scream said they'd fall on their back they'd say How Great Thou Art right oh you're You're such you're such a par you're such a mama oh you're great they begin to respond back to the voice what was she doing they hadn't even they didn't even know how to fly yet but they were learning how to listen to the voice that was talking to them let me tell you amen if you think it's just a man that called you in this hour you're going to fall you're going to walk away but if you realize it's a voice of God I don't care what weapon the enemy is going to throw at you amen it'll hold you in the hour of Temptation it'll hold told you when the enemy comes in like a flood he said I raise up a standard against it he said you mount up with wings as Eagles this is how brother bam said this is how the spirit operates towards you amen amen the anointing on this last age is the flying eagle I'm studying to the ages he promised that these he would send four anointings and those anointings would be there to combat the enemy the powers that Satan used against the church and God would send an anointing in that anointing would combat that power the first one was the lion the second was the ox the third was the man through the reformers and so forth but the last was a flying eagle brother B said they were there to protect the the the book of Acts and to keep the word and to perform it to watch over the word to watch that it is performed amen he he said often we think it'd be impossible to be a martyr to be to be in that time as a Marty how could I give my life he said but you want to think of it like this recall the faith that we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upheld all the martyrs and the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour if you would talk to those under the anointing of an ox for instance they would tell you I I couldn't do what I'd done but all I know that when I went into that hour there was something there that not only held me that satisfied me it was bigger than the the torture I was going through in fact I enjoyed that more than the torture in fact I was sorry when the torture ended that's direct testimony there was a man by the name of theodosis he was put on a stretching rack how many's been on a stretching rack it's not tonight he was put on a stretching rack and they pulled him and pulled him young man about 25 years old and they pulled him until everything the sockets were coming out and and he wouldn't recant he just sat there and and he and stood there whatever stretch there and and and he took it and the and Fox's book of Martin said with such fortitude that when they finally released him they asked him how could you stand the pain and the the rack the way you did he said all I can tell you is while I was on the rack a young man Stood Beside Me with a napkin and some water and he just kept brushing my brow and I was sorry to be let loose what was that the same kind of Faith amen the same kind of faith that hold you in your hour amen when the body could not take it anymore the same kind of the faith amen will lift you in that hour and it'll be one step at a time but you come through it and you'll be rejoicing in The Fellowship of his suffering more than the trial itself blessed be the name of the Lord that kind of faith that kind of anointing brother random said that in this last hour this message comes it's a flying eagle it's an eagle time it's revealed time it's the word of God made manifest time it's the word of God proved not the word of God debated the word of God proved God is proving his words listen the prophet said and you are one of his words he's proving that you are part of the word he is proving your destiny what where where can he start to prove it why not tonight why can he not start it this night on the night when everybody travels in and they're and they're tired and and they've heard the rules and they heard the sticks and all that kind of stuff but I hope you have a different idea of a stick now amen that God has watched over you to this moment to bring you here because he desires as an eagle to flutter over you amen you got to realize it's God that's done it for you it's God it's not your parents but what God did in them he can do in you amen you say well I am only here because my mom wants me here and my dad wants me I don't even want to be here I heard what brother Tim said some of you don't even want to be here I don't want to be here well you're here I got news for you your mind may not be here but your body is here and what you got in your body is what I'm talking to fact I can't even use your mind for a moment I want to talk to something that'll respond and then if that responds it may grab a hold of your mind man you begin to recognize hey we got too many testimonies of what God did hey I got some testimonies right there on the front row what God would do or the second row I can't recognize any row anymore amen that God would take atheists drug addicts amen liars and people didn't even know how to speak a Heavenly language didn't know what it was like to be a Christian change their desires clean them up from death into life put the Holy Ghost in them amen Church the eagle God wants to teach you what an eagle Christian is amen Robbie you were eating in a chicken yard you look like a chicken acted like a chicken CH whatever that is and talk like a chicken but yeah but you can help me be louder and and but then God swooped over showed him you were never what you thought you were God would show that you know when he's talking about an anointing on this age he's not he's not just trying toach you okay there's there's different anointings this is what it is now you know what it is okay go and do your thing he's showing you that I active I'm very active in this hour to hunt my own and to bring them to myself I will call a church meeting I'll call I'll plant a church I'll raise a church for 50 years in one place and I I'll let even unbelievers run the church I'll do whatever I got to do but I'll put it in an area where I know my seed is going to be and I'm going to use that church and I'm going to bring my seed across and and God is going to use that place it's going to bring you to life I'll do it all for you I want you know my relationship to you tonight is One Like an Eagle where I hover over you I've spread my wings I flutter over you you may not like my fluttering you may not like my hovering but my very presence is telling you something I am here Amen to catch you I put you where you're at for a reason let me tell you if you got a seed in you you got a seed in you there's nothing the devil can do outside of trying to choke out the life there he can't uproot the seed I just tell you it's all right to give a little little testimony I I can tell you as a little boy 5-year-old boy uh when my dad did not believe my mother did believe and I would go with my mom to her church and go with my dad to his church and dad would tell us do not believe what your mother believes she's in a cult how many's heard that before she's in a cult and and he would tell us these things as a 5-year-old child I would go with her to her meeting I'd go with him to his meeting so I'm I'm acquainted with both chicken coops and and and and places where eagles gather and you know as a little boy you're easily impressed to do one thing or the other but I can tell you what stands out to me more than anything is when God spoke to me amen my dad spoke to me my mom took me to her church but I remember amen when God spoke to me and when God be to deal with my heart as a little boy I remember when I was when I was baptized as nine I remember when he called me into the ministry at 17 at 17 years old and he spoke to my heart and said you're going to preach I was in prayer and he spoke to my heart you're going to preach and I I said no because that's what all good Christians do right no and you know what if God's talking to you he's going to use his word and he gave me he gave me a scripture acts 5 I believe it's 19 acts 5:19 I didn't know what it was it was around it was late at night I was praying you know if you want God to talk to you that's a good place to start Eagles pray and I was praying and and he gave me that scripture and I went and looked at it says and the angel of the Lord came to them by night and told them to go into the temple and and teach them the words of this life well then I knew that the voice that was talking to me was corresponding in the words cuz if this is an eagle voice it's going to come from here amen and it's going to Echo in your heart and have amen the same kind of response blessed be the name of the Lord that's what it that's what he has come to do he has come to anoint you to believe his word another part amen another part of the eagle anointing is to do what those other anointings did not do and that is to reveal who the enemy is and give him names it didn't do it under the lion didn't do do it under the ox didn't do it under the man but under the eagle anointing he could tell you the names of them riters he said amen amen he said he was his name is death amen he showed us his name he said when the enemy he said you should watch when he's he's getting ready to be exposed Satan hates to be exposed he hates to have his Secrets uncovered because if he can make it a secret and keep you confused you give up hope how many how many has has the devil told you you know go on and kill yourself go kill yourself or you're going to die you're not going to make it give up you're going to have to deal with depression the rest of your life give up you're have deal with hopelessness the rest of your life I want to tell you something the reason he's telling you that is because he can't do you're clapping at what I said but you ought to look at your enemy and tell them you can't do it amen if he was going to kill me brother Andrew if he was going to kill me brother Ron he would just kill me do you know a young man young lady anything he does to you he first has to ask permission I am not serving a devil with unlim I'm not fighting a devil rather with unlimited power I'm fighting somebody who God has put a guard upon you said you would win in this age you said you would overcome in this age you said You' be God in this age and there's some that believe you are you said you'd be worshiped as God you said you'd have your own throne but I said I'd have a church without spot without Rinko I said she would be a glorious church and you never take that away not do it you feel hopeless tonight it's not yours it's his hopelessness we have an enemy that cannot be saved but you can be saved we have an enemy that cannot be healed but you can be healed come on Church you got an enemy who cannot receive the Holy Ghost you can receive the Holy Ghost no wonder he hates you you get everything he can't get H he wants your life they lost their first estate James they can't get it back yet I'm speaking to all kinds of conditions in this room and the eagle said already said you're falling you're falling yeah you're falling well I'll catch you I promise I'll catch you if I don't catch you I'm not a good husband but I'll catch you you some of you looking real comfortable real comfortable we have we we don't want the enemy have anywhere to hide tonight Satan hates to be exposed he hates it this is Eagle time this is Eagle Vision how many's read the Book of Judges you know the Book of Judges is a book of Champions and in the Book of Judges God is saying what I'll do at the end you look the first judge who was the first judge he was from the L he was from the tribe of Judah his name was oau his name meant line of God right he was the first judge who was the last Judge Samson he was from the tribe of Dan which is under the banner of the eagle you had the line at the beginning you got the Eagle at the end his name means from uh like the sun I told you that tonight he talking about two Eagles the golden eagle and the Imperial Eagle the golden eagle is named that because of what his head looks like I love preaching to tired people you're going to get that in a week he's named a golden eagle because of what his head looks like you know bald eagle's not named a bald eagles because his feet you know that's why we're named after our head my identify my identify you ever hear that word you just did my identification is after my head hey buddy that's my identification who I had it's golden and the Imperial Eagle means from the Sun it must have been Samson like the sun and here God sets on the pages of a of a dark some of the darkest history of uh of Israel is the Book of Judges and in there he sets as the last judge a champion who's overcome at the end that's right he had testimony after testimony strength after strength victory after Victory he probably saw at the camp Time After Time everybody loves Samson to talk everybody loves Samson to sing they'd love that because man this dude was Victorious and everybody loves a Victorious server especially on the first night and there he is here here's this guy can you imagine he's getting up telling his testimony I I carried a gate up the hill could you imagine I mean this age is ate up with fitness places they got all kinds of things in there to write Joe to make you you work out not like that he carried it up the hill sit down he defeated the enemy with ridiculous weapons you imagine a testimony camp like that that get your attention tonight yeah I killed a thousand Philistines with the the Jawbone of a mule wellow that c your attention it wasn't with an AK-47 or an r115 or or you know a bomb or Dynamite it was with a bone you thought you were tough here's a guy that the enemy was scared to death of brother Braham said when he when he slew all those with with that Jawbone and and a thousand of them and then they're all hiding from him and he's walking around in front of the rock said anymore of you want any of this come on you guys want some of this bone you thought my God couldn't do anything did you oh no this is not a failed service I'm just using something dead right now amen I can defeat the enemy I can defeat the enemy with the most ridiculous things I don't need big things I don't need strong things I can take anything and defeat the enemy tonight you may think your little hand up and you saying Amen to the word is doing no good it may be even dried up and not looking like anything this is this this is not going to work this ain't going to work God says just swing it amen just swing it take what's at hand and defeat the Devil hey you know what you know what you know what Samson was doing he was making an Act of Faith amen Samson was never walking around when those the enemy was coming out he was not looking around saying now where is a bone I'm GNA find me a bone I'm going to whip the enemy God showed him a bone you don't even know what it takes but with God he'll show you what you don't think works it don't work it don't work I've tried this before it don't work I don't hear of anybody else using that bone to defeat an enemy anywhere in scripture anybody but it worked that day that's what an eagle anointing would do is show you things you didn't know would work will [Applause] work Hallelujah but even then even then he fell to the woman of the age and he gave his gift to the woman of the age he gave his secret what God had told him was precious he just threw it out there to her because he got tired of the press he didn't stay with what God had told him to do and he gave up his secret in her lap and when he done that and fell asleep don't fall asleep she called the enemy in and they shaved his hair he took away his message you thought you didn't need it you got so comfortable after all these years you didn't think you needed it but in her lap when it was shaved off she shook you says wake up Samson the enem is upon you and he got up and he didn't even know that the spirit of the Lord had left him you know you can get to a place where you don't even know if he's there or not when you fall asleep in the lap of the enemy oh and the enemy came in they had him now I'd seen you see some of you older ones you gave you gave testimonies here you were baptized you did all those things and where are you now failed testimony after failed testimony then they put his eyes out and made him work for them you think how sad it is look how sad it is when an eagle's wings have been clipped and he's grinding at the meal doing whatever the enemy tells him to do he's grinding at the meal people come and look at him and laugh and had a web page of Samson the failed experiment in the message and all this kind of stuff and you know and samon the path out of the message and you see kids the thing they didn't realize was they had not seen the cording ritual nobody was there it was just God and his people right them folks had this Eagle chained up up his eyes put out nothing like Eagle Vision don't even have it there promises lay in the word that Satan cannot get over that promise no matter how hard he tries Jesus said that this age would be so deceiving that if it were possible he said false prophets all this uh false Christ false anointed ones whatever he said they come he said it' be so deceiving that you would be deceived if it were Satan can't get over if it were possible he has tried to tear it down he's tried to take if it were POS if I can just take that possible away if I can take that possible away I'll get these kids I I'll get them I I got to have of them now I got them at the meal they're grinding look at them come on they're grinding their eyes are put out anything I says you can't even see you don't see the value of it you don't see what good is it what good is it you know they had clipped him they had cut him they had shaved him one thing that God will not let be taken from you is the the potential of that seed and the Bible has this one little verse in stuck in the middle of that tragedy and it says how be it they hairs of his head begin to grow back and Satan said well that's of little significance you know let it grow let it grow ain't there a song like that let it grow let it grow hope you don't know it and and and there's growing and it's growing and it's growing sorry brother Ron you know it don't you amen amen and it's growing and yours is coming out and it's growing and he reaches back there one day and he realizes that I feel that oh yeah and when he felt that he remembered something I'm just walking amen he remembered something he remembered that an angel had visited his house and an angel had said this boy will be a Nazarite from his birth yeah I have claimed you as my own I have claimed you as my own he's a Nazarite don't let his hair be touching again but I can't see I can't see my eyes have been put out I can't see but Eagle Vision is not natural vision you know Eagles have two eyelids you can put one eye out two eyes out whatever there's more there that the enemy can't put out when they LED this boy into the this man into the middle of their sporting Arena and he's LED there and they ignored that the hair had grown out but when he had failed it he began to remember that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I'm going to catch some of you blinded ones I'm going to catch some of you you bound at the [Music] post and the enemy is laughing what an age I mean they're all over the Internet laughing at you you're in a c it's no good let's make sport of them let's make sport of their profit let's make sport of them let's take away the value of what they got let's put a centerpiece up here and let's all look at him and see what a failure he's been and he's Chained and he's there and he's blinded but God called him before he hit the ground and when he picked him up he closed his ey well no he didn't close anything they were gone but he opened his spiritual eyes and brother brandom said he caught a vision of possibility that God could bring me back brother Tim why would god brother Ron Brother Andrew dth why would God choose a failed experiment to show what the Flying Eagle anointing is brother Derek because there's another scripture it says to the messenger of this age give them eyes s I'm talking to samsons in this room give them eyes sh that they may see what he saying you're blind but but I got a Sav that can give you a vision that all things are possible to them that believe I'll bring you back and I want to tell you this as I'm closing I'm going to
