[41:16] verse 31 and the house of israel called
[41:18] the name thereof manna
[41:20] and it was like coriander seed white and

[41:24] wafers made with honey and moses said
[41:28] this is the thing which the lord
[41:29] commandeth feel an armor of it
[41:31] to be kept for your generations that you
[41:34] may see the bread wherewith

[42:27] from heaven
[42:28] if any man eat of this bread he shall
[42:31] live forever
[42:32] and the bread that i will give is my

[42:44] same the living bread
[42:48] amen the living bread it's a bread of
[42:51] life
[42:52] it's a bread that sustains it's a bread
[42:54] that
[42:55] amen that heals and delivers you know i
[42:59] thought
[42:59] you could read the story and we didn't
[43:01] read all of it about the children of
[43:02] israel as they would
[43:04] come out of the land of egypt and and
[43:06] they would come across the red sea
[43:08] and you know and he's walking through a
[43:10] desert and in the desert
[43:12] there's not very much uh you know
[43:14] there's not a walmart or something that
[43:16] you can just walk into or
[43:17] gardens here and there fruit trees that
[43:20] you can pick from there's very
[43:22] very little to survive upon from from in
[43:24] a desert
[43:25] and they begin to cry out to the lord
[43:27] and their cries was not in the sense of
[43:29] asking but it was in the sense of
[43:32] complaining and they began to complain
[43:34] to the lord about having nothing to eat
[43:37] and they began to cry out and say you
[43:39] know we had low
[43:40] cloves and we had this and we had every
[43:42] kind of thing to eat in egypt
[43:44] why did you bring us out here to die and
[43:46] the lord was actually very wroth with
[43:48] him but
[43:49] in his grace and his mercy he would
[43:51] provide for them you know
[43:53] i believe if they would have just asked
[43:55] he would have provided
[43:57] you know they didn't have to complain
[43:58] they didn't have to shout they didn't
[43:59] have to scream they didn't have to
[44:01] say god what what you know do you care
[44:03] that we perished it wasn't about that
[44:06] all they had to do was ask and they
[44:08] would receive amen
[44:10] because he is the sustainer of life he
[44:13] is the creator of life amen
[44:15] nothing is too hard for the lord so it
[44:17] doesn't matter amen if you're in the
[44:18] desert or if you're in places that you
[44:20] can't
[44:21] get your own supplier and you can't
[44:22] supply your own needs
[44:24] he's more than enough for any situation
[44:27] amen and he would show this time for 40
[44:29] years
[44:29] as they would go down to the down to the
[44:32] wilderness and
[44:33] and he would rain down manna every every
[44:36] morning for them to eat he would
[44:38] show him every day i am the provider
[44:41] you don't have to get up one day and
[44:43] worry about it i'll provide for that day
[44:45] you don't have to
[44:46] get up the next day and worry about it i
[44:48] will provide for that day
[44:50] he was showing the attributes of himself
[44:52] as he would reign down this manna
[44:54] now brother branham would say it like
[44:56] this he said now moses he didn't have
[44:57] the ovens he didn't have the ability
[45:00] he couldn't do this they do this on his
[45:02] own amen it wasn't
[45:03] even it wasn't anything moses could
[45:05] provide he said but the creator
[45:07] every morning would drop this angel food
[45:10] down to them
[45:12] amen and he would he would provide for
[45:14] them and and i believe he's that same
[45:15] kind of god for us to see
[45:17] this evening i believe that no matter
[45:19] where we're at whether we may be in a
[45:20] desert or we may be wherever we may be
[45:23] we know that we cannot take care of
[45:25] ourselves we know that we're frail human
[45:27] beings and it's impossible
[45:29] as a human being to get up in the
[45:31] morning to realize what that day is
[45:33] going to hold you never know what a day
[45:34] is going to hold
[45:35] but you can you can have this confidence
[45:37] that he
[45:38] holds tomorrow that he is more than able
[45:41] for whatever situation or whatever i'm
[45:43] going through
[45:44] and he has the provisions for my needs
[45:47] he has the provisions for my health he
[45:49] has a
[45:50] he has the provisions that brother
[45:51] brandon would say there were so many
[45:53] vitamins packed in this manner as it
[45:55] would fall
[45:56] to where not even they wouldn't even get
[45:57] sick they wouldn't even
[45:59] you know their souls and their shoes
[46:01] wouldn't even wear out
[46:02] he said because god was providing every
[46:05] step of the way
[46:06] and i don't believe that god has come in
[46:08] this age that we've lived in
[46:10] and living in and god has done all the
[46:12] things that he's done and he's called
[46:14] out of a people
[46:15] out of a church and he's called a bride
[46:17] out of a church or he's called a people
[46:19] to himself as a
[46:20] people to his name amen to bring them to
[46:23] this place to say now you go ahead
[46:25] and you take care of yourself you go
[46:27] ahead and you see what you can do for
[46:29] yourself no
[46:30] he's still the same yesterday today and
[46:32] forever
[46:33] so he is supplying for our needs even
[46:35] when we can't see him provide
[46:37] he is coming on our behalf even we can't
[46:40] see him working on our behalf
[46:42] he is showing time after time after time
[46:45] he is the sustainer he is the need
[46:48] supplier
[46:49] he is the healer he is the deliverer
[46:51] he's everything that we ever would have
[46:53] need of
[46:54] amen between here and the rapture
[46:58] hallelujah there's not a day that
[46:59] surprises him there's not a day
[47:01] that he wakes up or comes and looks down
[47:04] here on earth and he said wow
[47:06] i didn't realize it was going to be that
[47:07] bad i i didn't realize it was going to
[47:09] be that tough you know
[47:10] maybe i don't have the answer no he has
[47:13] the answer for every day
[47:15] it does not matter how dark the day is
[47:17] it does might not matter how bad the day
[47:19] may seem
[47:20] it does not matter how sick you are it
[47:22] does not matter
[47:23] what what oppression is upon you he has
[47:26] the answer
[47:27] for every day amen he has a supply for
[47:30] every day
[47:31] amen i believe he is the word amen in
[47:34] our hour
[47:34] to give us sustaining strength you know
[47:37] brother branham would that be asked a
[47:38] question
[47:39] and i was what i thought this was very
[47:41] wonderful as we look at these things he
[47:43] he was asked the question what did jesus
[47:45] mean in saint john 21
[47:47] 15 and 17 when he asked peter if he
[47:50] loved him and told him to feed his
[47:52] lambs then he said feed my sheep he said
[47:54] see
[47:55] christ is the shepherd he was going away
[47:58] but he was going
[47:59] he was leaving the commission of his
[48:01] sheep in other words he was going to
[48:03] make sure
[48:04] his sheep was taken care of hallelujah
[48:07] which any shepherd feeds his flock he he
[48:10] takes care of him he makes sure
[48:12] that he supplies their needs he makes
[48:14] sure that there's something there
[48:16] for every situation and he was leaving
[48:18] the commission to his
[48:20] disciples to continue the work to
[48:22] continue to feed the flock
[48:24] to be the shepherd to feed the sheep
[48:26] amen he said see
[48:28] here this morning that's what i'm doing
[48:30] he says sheep
[48:31] will only grow as you give them sheep
[48:33] food
[48:34] he said if you fry up a big hamburger
[48:36] and you try to give it to a sheep
[48:38] he couldn't grow on that that's not
[48:40] sheep food
[48:41] if you try to grill a nice t-bone steak
[48:43] and fix it all up every good as it may
[48:45] be
[48:46] but try to give it to a sheep that's not
[48:48] sheep food
[48:49] he couldn't grow on that but when you're
[48:51] to feed the flock of god
[48:53] that shows that you don't feed them some
[48:55] man-made theology
[48:57] you don't feed them some man-made creeds
[48:59] or dogmas
[49:00] you feed them on the word of god
[49:03] amen feed them the word be a shepherd a
[49:06] true
[49:07] shepherd feed my sheep
[49:10] i want well you know a true shepherd can
[49:13] he does not try to feed
[49:14] the sheep his complexes or his fears or
[49:17] his unbelief but no he takes the word of
[49:20] god
[49:21] and he puts it out there for them to eat
[49:24] he
[49:24] studies he shows himself to be approved
[49:26] a workman that not needed to be ashamed
[49:28] and he goes to the word what is he
[49:31] coming through
[49:32] trying to find the food needed for the
[49:34] season
[49:35] trying to find the food needed for the
[49:37] moment because
[49:38] god has a food for the moment amen of
[49:42] strength giving food for the
[49:44] moment amen you know how it was when you
[49:46] was going through sicknesses
[49:48] something would be dropped into your
[49:49] heart amen a quote or a scripture
[49:52] amen it would give you such strength in
[49:54] the moment god has strength for the
[49:56] moment
[49:57] he has food for the moment he has the
[49:59] power for the moment
[50:01] he has the word for the moment
[50:04] this word is an up-to-date word it's not
[50:06] a word of yesterday
[50:08] although it had power yesterday it's not
[50:11] a word of tomorrow
[50:12] although it has power for tomorrow but
[50:14] this word
[50:15] is spiritual food in due season in this
[50:19] moment
[50:19] and this time when i have need of a god
[50:22] who are answered by
[50:24] fire he has a word for that moment
[50:28] when i have need of a god who can heal
[50:31] and perform the miraculous
[50:33] he has a word for that moment
[50:35] [Applause]
[50:37] hallelujah he said men's man shall not
[50:40] live by bread alone
[50:42] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[50:45] the mouth of god
[50:46] is that right he said if a man is to
[50:48] live and they are the flock of god the
[50:50] church of god
[50:52] then they can only thrive upon the word
[50:55] and manner of god and this is his manna

[51:19] hidden down through the ages and what
[51:21] was it the overcomer of luther
[51:23] received the hidden manner for their
[51:25] moment it was a moment where the just
[51:27] shall live by faith
[51:29] and they grabbed a hold of that manna
[51:30] and they withstood the
[51:32] catholic church hallelujah john wesley

[51:51] season

[52:04] his journey

[52:13] amen i'm going to become hidden and the
[52:16] world

[52:21] hallelujah amen he wouldn't say that in
[52:24] his word

[52:27] amen he wouldn't say
[52:28] the word won't see me but you will see
[52:31] me
[52:32] the world won't know me but you will
[52:34] know me the world won't understand but
[52:36] you'll understand
[52:37] the world won't be able to understand
[52:39] those strengths you've got to stand in

[54:19] they went out every morning and every
[54:23] day there was in the desert
[54:24] but god was still their sustainer every
[54:27] day was not a good day
[54:29] but that god was still their sustainer
[54:31] every moment wasn't a happy moment
[54:33] but god was still their sustainer
[54:38] hallelujah he says
[54:42] what about right now every day
[54:45] ought to be a fresh and new blessing a
[54:48] new something coming from god
[54:50] the hidden manna coming down from god
[54:53] out of heaven
[54:55] and he said we feast upon this manner

[55:15] that'll lift me up that'll push me
[55:17] forward that'll bring me another step
[55:21] amen when the devil thought well surely
[55:23] they had done gave up by now
[55:25] he's not realizing what we're feeding on
[55:27] we're not feeding on a temporary word
[55:30] we're not feeding on a temporary power
[55:32] we're feeding on the body word
[55:34] of the son of man the fresh man out of
[55:38] heaven
[55:39] is falling every day i
[55:42] encourage you start taking a bite
[55:47] this is what he told john in revelations
[55:49] 10 he said you come and take the book
[55:51] and you eat the book amen it's time we
[55:55] start eating the book
[55:56] eating the word of god amen eating what
[55:59] god has given us
[56:00] every day well you say well i got it on
[56:02] sunday and wednesday
[56:03] what about monday tuesday and thursday
[56:05] and friday and saturday
[56:11] he said that's what he meant by feeding
[56:14] my sheep
[56:20] he said i he said we may not ever get to
[56:22] the rest of the question because that's
[56:24] a good one for me
[56:25] i like that when i talk of christ be in
[56:28] the manner
[56:29] the food for the sheep
[56:32] feed them christ from his word
[56:35] take the word of christ exactly the way
[56:38] it's wrote here
[56:39] and give it to the sheep no matter what
[56:42] anybody else says all they need a
[56:43] hamburger
[56:44] don't believe that here's what they need
[56:46] right here this is
[56:47] it give them this this is sheep food
[56:50] this is what makes them grow the holy
[56:52] spirit
[56:53] this is his word this is his commission
[56:56] the word is a seed the seed
[56:58] brings forth a plant and the plant we
[57:00] begin to heat
[57:01] this is what brings forth the plant that
[57:03] the holy spirit thrives on
[57:04] in the church it feeds upon it feeds the
[57:07] church the holy spirit does
[57:09] rejoicing in the presence of god because
[57:11] that's what that's
[57:12] because that the people is believing his
[57:14] word and letting him work through them
[57:17] and giving them the very things that god
[57:19] promised them that they would do
[57:20] and god is seeing his church growing
[57:23] therefore the sheep's being fed
[57:25] and the holy spirit's being glorified
[57:28] that's
[57:28] it feed my sheep
[57:36] now we know that the story would be or
[57:39] the it would go is that they had to only
[57:41] they could only take
[57:42] as much it would supply them for that
[57:44] day because every morning they had to go
[57:47] gather a new
[57:48] manner they couldn't gather you know be
[57:50] build my way
[57:51] have a big bucket and go out and get
[57:53] them a week's worth and set it in their
[57:54] house or go get two days worth
[57:56] they can only get one day's worth amen
[57:59] because god wanted to show them
[58:01] i'm fresh every day it was showing an
[58:04] attribute of himself he's wanting to
[58:06] show that way we can look at that
[58:08] and we can say he's a fresh experience
[58:10] every day
[58:11] it ought to be we're falling in love
[58:13] with jesus more and more
[58:15] every day hallelujah
[58:19] amen see if he said we try to keep it
[58:21] over it's going to spoil
[58:23] he said that's what's the matter with a
[58:25] lot of people we keep it over i had an
[58:27] experience
[58:28] 20 years ago but that experience has got
[58:30] wiggle tales in it today
[58:33] what about right now
[58:36] well you say well i received the baptism
[58:38] the holy ghost and i got joy and peace
[58:40] and long suffering
[58:41] but what about now that experience back
[58:45] there is done gone
[58:46] what about a new one today each day
[58:50] they gather new manner and manna is the
[58:52] type of perfect type
[58:54] of the holy ghost coming from god to
[58:56] sustain you
[58:57] the sustainer to take them through the
[59:02] wilderness
[59:04] as a spirit is a sustainer for us
[59:07] to take us through our journey we're on
[59:10] our road to the promised land
[59:12] what promised land in my father's house
[59:14] is many mansions
[59:16] if it wasn't so i would have told you
[59:18] i've gone to prepare a place for you
[59:21] that's a manner right there amen that i
[59:24] can gather strength from
[59:25] that my god hasn't forgot about me amen
[59:28] my god is preparing for me
[59:30] he's got a table set for me he's got a
[59:32] plate set for me
[59:33] he's got food on the table he's ready
[59:42] we're fed daily by the holy gho
[59:45] daily daily daily
[59:48] somebody say daily we're fed daily by
[59:52] the holy spirit coming down from god out
[59:54] of heaven
[59:55] sweet to our souls like honey and the
[59:57] rock
[59:58] i have to have it every hour of my life
[1:00:01] or i die
[1:00:02] that's true it has to come to me or i
[1:00:04] can't live

[1:00:11] go through quite a bit of quotes so bear
[1:00:12] with me

[1:00:15] tambourine and went down the bank
[1:00:17] beating the tambourine all the daughters
[1:00:18] of israel following her
[1:00:20] dancing in the spirit moses put up his
[1:00:22] hands and singing the spirit

[1:00:26] and i ain't never seen anyone in my life
[1:00:27] that's right they sure was going down
[1:00:29] the banks rejoicing

[1:13:56] are in our possessions
[1:13:58] therefore prophesy and say thus saith
[1:14:00] the lord god
[1:14:01] because they have made you desolate and
[1:14:03] swallowed you up on every side that you
[1:14:05] might be a possession unto the residue
[1:14:07] of the heathen
[1:14:08] and you're taken up in the lips of the
[1:14:09] talkers and are in infamy of the people
[1:14:12] therefore ye mountains of israel hear
[1:14:14] the word of the lord god
[1:14:16] thus saith the lord god to the mountains
[1:14:18] and to the hills and to the rivers and
[1:14:19] to the valleys
[1:14:20] to the desolate wastes into the cities
[1:14:22] that are forsaken

[1:14:35] heathen
[1:14:35] against all which have appointed my land
[1:14:38] unto their possessions with the joy of
[1:14:40] all their hearts
[1:14:41] with the spiteful minds that cast it out
[1:14:43] for a prey
[1:14:44] prophesy their concern in the land of
[1:14:46] israel and say unto the mountains and to
[1:14:48] the hills
[1:14:49] and to the rivers and the valleys thus
[1:14:51] saith the lord god
[1:14:53] behold i've spoken in my jealousy and my
[1:14:55] fury
[1:14:56] because you born the shame of the
[1:14:57] heathen therefore saith the lord god
[1:15:00] i have lifted up my hands surely the
[1:15:02] heathen that are about you
[1:15:04] they shall bear their shame but ye o
[1:15:07] mountains of israel
[1:15:09] you shall shoot forth your branches and
[1:15:11] yield your fruit to a
[1:15:13] people of israel for they are at hand to
[1:15:16] come
[1:15:16] and behold i am for you

[1:15:27] the houses of israel
[1:15:29] even all of it and the cities shall be
[1:15:31] inhabited and the waste shall be builded
[1:15:33] and i'll multiply upon you men and
[1:15:35] beasts and they shall increase and bring
[1:15:38] forth fruit
[1:15:39] i will settle you after your old estate

[1:25:41] to have a
[1:25:42] have a rock they called it a mad stone
[1:25:46] and i looked this up because you know
[1:25:49] and heard about it my day
[1:25:51] but it's called it was a home remedy
[1:25:54] used for centuries to heal though that
[1:25:57] says not a common practice today
[1:26:01] a mad stone sometimes called a bazaar
[1:26:04] stone
[1:26:05] is used to lay on a bite or a wound
[1:26:09] and to draw the poison out it works by
[1:26:13] absorbing
[1:26:13] all the poison bit by bit
[1:26:18] curing the bites by detoxifying it
[1:26:21] completely
[1:26:24] he said when they would get bit by a mad
[1:26:26] dog they would have a mad stone
[1:26:28] and they would stick it and if it stuck
[1:26:31] to that
[1:26:32] and they left it there they got well if
[1:26:34] they didn't
[1:26:35] they died he said the worst mad dog i
[1:26:37] know of is the devil
[1:26:40] he said the only cure i know up for it
[1:26:42] is the rock of ages
[1:26:44] stick to it hold on to it and god will
[1:26:48] take care of it he said little boy here
[1:26:49] in the wheelchair you're blind sir
[1:26:51] you're laying on the cart
[1:26:52] holding god's unchanging hand the devil
[1:26:55] might have bit you
[1:26:56] but there's enough drawing power in the
[1:26:58] rock of ages cleft for me
[1:27:00] let me hide myself in thee the devil
[1:27:03] can't get you when you're hidden there
[1:27:05] stick with it hold on to it don't let it
[1:27:07] away from you
[1:27:08] no matter how many of the symptoms i'm
[1:27:10] staying right with it
[1:27:12] no matter how bad it gets i'm staying
[1:27:14] right with it
[1:27:16] stay there until the healing power has
[1:27:19] drawn
[1:27:20] all the disease away he
[1:27:23] will do it
[1:27:29] oh praise the name of the lord
[1:27:32] he said what happens the manner will
[1:27:34] begin to fall
[1:27:35] every morning he said they tried to keep
[1:27:38] some of it over he got wiggle tails in
[1:27:40] it
[1:27:41] he says what's the matter with a lot of
[1:27:42] pentecostal experience or depending on
[1:27:45] testifying on something
[1:27:46] that happened years ago them experience
[1:27:49] gets wiggletails
[1:27:51] why not get a fresh one
[1:27:54] hallelujah every day with jesus is
[1:27:56] sweeter than the day before
[1:27:59] this is a theme all the way down through

[1:28:16] our manna after we come to the blood
[1:28:18] been saved and cleansed from our sins

[1:28:39] spirit
[1:28:39] can have that same kind of holy ghost
[1:28:42] that they got on the day of pentecost
[1:28:43] not something that looked like it
[1:28:45] but the real thing same kind of holy
[1:28:48] spirit
[1:28:48] that falls back there falls now the same
[1:28:51] kind
[1:28:51] the real holy ghost brings forth the
[1:28:53] same kind of evidence
[1:28:54] the same proofs that they had back then
[1:28:56] comes with the same power
[1:28:58] the same holy ghost it's real just as
[1:29:00] real as it's ever been
[1:29:02] just the same holy spirit that fell back
[1:29:04] there on the day of pentecost
[1:29:07] oh he said friends let's look at it

[1:29:11] wafer it tasted like honey

[1:29:26] man that pay the price

[1:29:33] original
[1:29:35] like phil in the beginning like they had
[1:29:37] on the day of pentecost
[1:29:38] hallelujah the holy ghost is a real
[1:29:41] product
[1:29:42] you don't have to receive some duplicate
[1:29:44] or something wait till you get a taste
[1:29:46] of the original manna that fell on the
[1:29:47] day of pentecost
[1:29:48] there there was receive the holy ghost
[1:29:50] you know what's the matter with the
[1:29:51] church

[1:29:54] paul revival and the holy bible holy
[1:29:56] ghost taught in it again
[1:29:57] takes fire coming down from heaven
[1:30:01] wow but we have a right to the original
[1:30:06] jesus would again show this in matthew
[1:30:08] 14. actually all the gospels but i take
[1:30:10] this one
[1:30:11] matthew 14 and verse 15 said when it was
[1:30:14] evening
[1:30:15] his disciples came to him saying this is
[1:30:17] a desert place
[1:30:18] huh a desert place
[1:30:23] he's going to show them again i'm the
[1:30:25] lord of creation
[1:30:28] in a desert place they would discuss it
[1:30:32] times past ain't time for them to go get
[1:30:35] something
[1:30:37] we send a multitude that they may go in
[1:30:39] the villages and maybe confine
[1:30:40] themselves
[1:30:41] some vigils but jesus said unto them
[1:30:45] they need not depart depart give them to
[1:30:49] eat
[1:30:52] this is what he's telling his people
[1:30:53] again you don't have to depart
[1:30:56] i got something for you don't walk away
[1:31:00] brother wayne would preach it he said
[1:31:02] you're in position for a miracle
[1:31:05] he said don't get out of line
[1:31:08] stay in line until you receive your
[1:31:10] piece of bread
[1:31:13] they said on them well we're here i hear
[1:31:15] these five loaves and two fishes
[1:31:17] he said bring them hither to me and he
[1:31:19] commanded the multitude to sit down on
[1:31:21] the grass
[1:31:22] and he took the five loaves and two
[1:31:24] fishes looking up to heaven he blessed
[1:31:26] it and break
[1:31:28] and gave the loaves of his disciples and
[1:31:30] the disciples to the multitude
[1:31:33] and they did all we eat and were filled
[1:31:38] brother brandon would say this is also
[1:31:40] he would type it again to
[1:31:41] every ministry the ministries of the
[1:31:44] seven
[1:31:45] church age messengers they would receive
[1:31:48] and then they would give
[1:31:49] they'd receive and they would give what
[1:31:51] they received they gave
[1:31:54] amen and they did what
[1:31:57] all eight
[1:32:01] five thousand men beside
[1:32:04] women and children
[1:32:08] they did all eat five loaves of bread
[1:32:11] two fish
[1:32:16] but true
[1:32:19] he looked up to heaven and he blessed it
[1:32:22] and he break it he tore a piece off and
[1:32:25] he handed it
[1:32:26] tore a piece off and handed it tore a
[1:32:29] piece off
[1:32:30] and he handed it tore peace off
[1:32:33] not gonna run out of holy ghost not
[1:32:36] gonna run out of power
[1:32:37] not gonna run out of the ability to heal
[1:32:39] the sick not going to run out of the
[1:32:41] ability to call the prodigals home
[1:32:43] not going to run out of the sp
[1:32:47] showing himself he's got power enough
[1:32:49] for every person
[1:32:53] he wouldn't at all be saved but they got
[1:32:55] to take the bread
[1:32:58] there might have been somebody there
[1:32:59] that said i ain't eating that i don't
[1:33:01] know i don't i think that'd be pretty
[1:33:02] foolish
[1:33:03] but there may have been somebody like
[1:33:04] that so i'm tired i'm ready to go i'm
[1:33:07] hungry and they went tried to find they
[1:33:08] may have died just a few steps away i
[1:33:10] don't know
[1:33:11] but they just stayed in line he's
[1:33:14] tearing it off
[1:33:18] i heard i heard this brother wayne
[1:33:20] talking about staying in your position
[1:33:22] i ain't got out of position i've stayed
[1:33:26] right there
[1:33:27] because i know he's going to tear off a
[1:33:29] piece of bread
[1:33:32] because he's the lord of creation
[1:33:35] it does not matter how black it may seem
[1:33:37] how dark it may seem
[1:33:38] he has the ability to pull off bread and
[1:33:41] there'll be more bread
[1:33:44] pull off healing and there'll be more
[1:33:46] healing
[1:33:47] pull off deliverance and there'd be more
[1:33:49] deliverance
[1:33:51] pull off salvation and there'd be more
[1:33:53] salvation
[1:33:54] pull off the holy ghost and there'd be
[1:33:56] more holy ghost
[1:33:58] he's the lord of creation don't get out
[1:34:01] of line
[1:34:06] and after they had eaten they took up
[1:34:09] the fragments
[1:34:11] that remain 12 baskets full
[1:34:17] he was showing himself again as jehovah
[1:34:20] jireh
[1:34:22] more than enough not just enough
[1:34:25] but more than enough so it shows me that
[1:34:28] when he come down in this age
[1:34:31] he's not running out he hasn't come to
[1:34:35] my moment when i need him and he don't
[1:34:36] have enough
[1:34:37] virtue in him to write i can receive
[1:34:39] what i have need of
[1:34:41] he's here to tear off another piece of
[1:34:44] bread
[1:34:46] brother and would say you want an
[1:34:47] amazing he would tear that off
[1:34:49] he said it went past the growing stage
[1:34:52] the planning the growing the harvesting
[1:34:56] the sifting the baking the
[1:35:00] kneading the baking the ovens went past
[1:35:03] all of that
[1:35:05] there's another piece there's another
[1:35:08] piece
[1:35:11] you know there was some men that were
[1:35:12] walking on the road to emmaus
[1:35:16] that was discouraged not realizing that
[1:35:20] same prophecy be fulfilled
[1:35:22] not realizing the greatest thing that
[1:35:24] ever happened in human history it just
[1:35:26] happened
[1:35:28] he rose from the dead
[1:35:31] and they're walking along and they're
[1:35:33] talking about their sorrows and their
[1:35:34] troubles and they're sad
[1:35:36] and while they're looking around and
[1:35:37] thinking how bad it is and it's so dark
[1:35:39] disciples don't know what to do nobody
[1:35:41] knows what to do
[1:35:42] out of the bushes steps somebody and he
[1:35:45] starts walking with them
[1:35:47] and he's walking and he's talking
[1:35:52] he starts saying he said why why are you
[1:35:54] sad
[1:35:55] why why is your countenance falling
[1:36:01] why are you downhearted what's wrong
[1:36:04] well you must be you must not be from
[1:36:06] around here
[1:36:08] you you must you must not know what's
[1:36:10] been going on and
[1:36:11] don't you know that our our master was
[1:36:14] crucified and
[1:36:15] they laid him in a tomb and he's been
[1:36:16] dead now now there's stories going his
[1:36:19] body's disappeared and we don't know
[1:36:20] what's happening
[1:36:22] and he began to break bread he began to
[1:36:26] tear off scriptures
[1:36:27] and hand it to him and show them this
[1:36:29] promise and this promise
[1:36:30] and what god did all the way draw the
[1:36:32] way from genesis all the way down
[1:36:35] showing them who he was
[1:36:39] and they get to the place where they're
[1:36:40] going and they go to turn in and
[1:36:42] the scripture says he makes as if he's
[1:36:45] going to go on
[1:36:47] and they restrained him he said no
[1:36:50] come in come fellowship with us
[1:36:54] what you've been telling me has been
[1:36:55] encouraging i want more of it lord
[1:36:58] i desire more from me father i i i don't
[1:37:02] want just
[1:37:02] that just what i had i want more is
[1:37:05] there anybody here tonight that's
[1:37:06] wanting to restrain him just a bit and
[1:37:08] say
[1:37:09] lord i need a fresh experience i need
[1:37:12] more of you father i
[1:37:13] i've had i've had moves of the holy
[1:37:15] ghost and i've had you touch my life but
[1:37:17] i want more
[1:37:20] all you got to do is restrain him ask
[1:37:23] him say father come by my way right now
[1:37:25] speak to me and he comes down he walks
[1:37:28] into the
[1:37:29] room and brother branham said they sat
[1:37:31] down they ordered some bread and some
[1:37:32] vittles and things and
[1:37:34] said he's sitting there and he said he
[1:37:35] reached and he done something
[1:37:37] familiar now i've been
[1:37:40] pondering on this i've been looking at
[1:37:42] this because
[1:37:43] you know i i personally don't believe it
[1:37:45] was just a certain way he held the bread
[1:37:50] i believe that when he tore it off
[1:37:54] another piece appeared
[1:37:58] showing who he is wouldn't matter how a
[1:38:01] man holds a piece of bread
[1:38:03] but it matters if a man tears off a
[1:38:05] piece and another piece appears
[1:38:08] that matters and he would take it
[1:38:11] and the scripture said when they saw him
[1:38:13] do that
[1:38:14] their eyes are open there he is
[1:38:22] i say he's about to do something
[1:38:23] familiar
[1:38:29] tear off a piece of bread and another
[1:38:32] one appear
[1:38:33] showing he's the same yesterday today
[1:38:35] and forever
