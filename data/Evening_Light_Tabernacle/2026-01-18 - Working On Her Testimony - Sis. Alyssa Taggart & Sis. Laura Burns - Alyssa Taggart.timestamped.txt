[0:17] The [music] preacher listened [singing]
[0:19] closely
[0:21] to the broken mother's heart
[0:25] as she talked about [singing and music]
[0:27] her daughter gone astray.
[0:32] [music]
[0:34] Feeling so ashamed, [singing]
[0:37] [music] she wants to take the blame
[0:41] as she wonders [singing and music] where
[0:43] she made her mistake.

[0:51] his blood at home knows the way to
[0:56] Calvary.
[0:58] And [singing and music] the word says
[0:59] that she won't run for
[1:02] [music and singing] long.

[1:10] in [music] God's higher ways
[1:14] and know that [singing] until

[1:21] She's working [singing] on her
[1:22] testimony.
[1:25] [music] Though the way they chose is
[1:28] [singing] lonely.
[1:30] know that there's a victory [singing]
[1:33] down the road. [music]

[2:25] but it's hard to leave it there [music]
[2:28] and walk away. [singing]
