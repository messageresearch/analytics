[0:17] The preacher listened closely
[0:21] to the broken mother's heart
[0:25] as she talked about her daughter gone
[0:29] astray.
[0:34] Feeling so ashamed,
[0:38] she wants to take the blame
[0:41] as she wonders where she made her
[0:46] mistake.
[0:50] But the preacher sent his blood at home
[0:54] knows the way to Calvary.
[0:58] And the word says that she won't run for
[1:03] long.
[1:06] So let's keep believing
[1:10] in God's higher ways
[1:14] and know that until
[1:18] she is back where she belongs. She's
[1:21] working on her testimony.
[1:26] Though the way they chose is lonely.
[1:30] know that there's a victory down the
[1:34] road.
[1:38] Someday she'll share her story
[1:42] and help somebody else to make it home.
[1:50] So don't worry,
[1:53] she's working on her testimony.
[2:02] This could be your story.
[2:06] You're praying, "Lord, how long?
[2:10] What will it take for my child to be
[2:14] saved?"
[2:18] You know God has a plan.
[2:22] You've placed it in his hands,
[2:25] but it's hard to leave it there and walk
[2:30] away.
[2:33] There's a promise to your children.
[2:38] The same one he's given you
[2:41] that together you will spend eternity.
[2:49] No failure is final
[2:53] when God extends his grace.
[2:57] But until they just speak and with all
[3:02] your heart believe they're working on
[3:05] their testimony
[3:08] though the way they chose this lonely
[3:13] know that there's a victory down the
[3:17] road.
[3:20] Someday they'll share their story
[3:24] and help somebody else to make it home.
[3:32] Don't worry
[3:35] cuz working on their testimony
[3:40] though the way they show is lonely.
[3:44] Know that there's a victory down the
[3:48] road.
[3:51] Someday they'll share their story
[3:55] and help somebody else to make it home.
[4:03] So don't worry,
