we face the fears and anxieties lord what this year holds lord we're just gonna turn our eyes to you tonight father and we're going to look to the hills which cometh our strength and our help and we're going to ask lord that you just be the same god that you were in 2020 you'll be that same god in 2021 lord that you'd continue to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think father and we just ask tonight lord that you'll have preeminence in our service lord you'll anoint the ears of the here the lips of the speaker tonight we all can do our part to get out of the way and allow the gift to move lord we just commit this service to you tonight lord we thank you for the opportunity we thank you lord for this church we thank you for the people and the ministry that we have surrounded here lord lord it goes beyond the four walls of this building father this is a universal worldwide ministry lord and we we're partakers of that tonight each of us have a part to play and lord we want to do our part tonight and we just asked lord you just come by and move moving every heart moving every life those on the stream lord move there as well father we just committed a service to you now lord in jesus name amen if you have your bibles tonight we'll have you turn to hebrews 12. we're going to look here in verse 1 and verse 2. hebrews 12 verse 1 and verse 2 and i want to speak to you tonight so i want to pick back up on god does impossible math remember when we spoke about god does impossible math the very first time we want to think about the math problem as being a problem and a lot of times we don't have the necessary answer because some of the problems can be so difficult but i want to subtitle this tonight when it looks impossible look to jesus and live so when it looks impossible too impossible for you it's never too impossible for him so we're going to look here tonight in hebrews 12 it says wherefore seeing we we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and sin of unbelief which so do easily beset us and let us run with patience that word patience there is hooper monet means steadfast endurance let us run the race with patience that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god you can have your seats this evening now we find that we're here this is the second service of our new year we can certainly say that there's probably a lot of anxieties that we're all facing what's going to happen in the political system here in on january 22nd or sometime around there or you know what's taking place in georgia today as far as the election there so we found that there's so much that we don't know and there's so much that we've already come through and if if we take our focus and our attention as believers and that's all that we put our focus on and that's what we always put our attention on that i'm afraid we're going to miss the visitation of the lord i'm afraid that if that's all we can see and yes you know it looks impossible how we're going to get out of this you know will there be a republican in the party and all these different things but i want us tonight to not think about who's going to be in the white house or who's going to be in the political systems or anything of that nature or if there's going to be another pandemic and you know the covet is already uh mutated and it's it's spreading even faster and stronger and it's got worse side effects and more people are dying starting out we don't want to consume ourselves with fears and anxieties of the world i want you to take your eyes off of those things tonight and i want us to put our eyes back on jesus so we finally the prophet of god will tell us in the message the end time he says you always talk about how bad the world is and we can surely say man that seems like the talk of the town right he says how wicked the world is he said this true but look how great the church is getting all the time so astounding letting your attention and your focus go to how bad the world's getting won't you turn it on the devil and say devil it's getting bad out there but look how powerful this church is getting look how powerful the bride is getting more and more he said when the world's getting wickeder and wickeder and wickeder their church is getting more powerful and powerful all the time the church that you tonight is getting more powerful and powerful all the time then he says in redemption by power he says you're always pointing how wicked the world is getting but you fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time say she's rising up standing on the field oh she's a little flock but brother god is with her and she's gonna try them just as certain as christ rose from the dead amen god's church shall never fail you hear that this evening god's church shall never fail so when you face the enemy tomorrow morning and he's coming he's lying about you and he's telling this on you and he's in your face ridiculing you about this and beating you down about this you let him know god's church will never fail he says she's going to triumph just as certain as christ rose from the dead amen god's church shall never fail the gates of hell shall not prophet against it it showed that they would be against it but they cannot prevail their church is going to triumph through the blood of jesus christ with the victory march he goes i'm positive of this one thing that god will have a church without spot wrinkle or blemish oh aren't you thankful god sent us a messenger tell us what we got to look forward to you know there's so many out there right now they're looking at what's going on in america and they're judging the world by what's taking place and the american political system has become a worldwide embarrassment and everybody understands the end time is at hand but the prophet of god said end time people must meet end time conditions i say bring it on lord because we're ready and the endtime people has been given a promise of an end time rapture but the bible tells us we are to run this race this conflict this contest that we're in with endurance with with steadfast face looking unto jesus not looking at the race not looking at the contest not looking at the problem not looking at political systems not looking at rise or cobra 19 or whatever else but looking unto jesus and in the message his wonders to perform brother branham will begin to speak about mary and joseph and how that that only that could only happen at a certain time in history it could not happen in any other time here he was joseph a godly a real son of god and he was told to take mary or he was going to take mary to be his wife but he found out that she was already pregnant beforehand and he was mindful to put her away but brother brown said the supernatural came to him and told him joseph don't fear to put her away that thing that's inside of her that's conceited is conceit of the holy ghost and and so it began to work on joseph and he said in those days he said if there would have been a king other than king hare that he said he would call him that uh cold-hearted king he said that murder heartless bloodthirsty if there have been another king on the throne it would have never taken place and think about this church and we all know about world war ii and we know about the nazi and the nazi campaign against the jews but that had to take place in a particular moment in time to get god's and laundered people back in their homeland and we find the things that are taking place today it's at an appointed time god has put his right man on the throne to do what to usher in not the satanic kingdom but to usher in the kingdom of god where this bride takes a rapture god is bringing us all together and if we sit spiritual dumb well we don't we can't look beyond the trial or we can't look beyond what's going on and we can't look beyond what the chaos that that america is coming into let me tell you church this is what it's supposed to be it has to be this and in that time if there would have never been a hair that would have never been a taxation mary and joseph would have never went to bethlehem but they had to go to bethlehem because it had to fulfill scripture so every precept of god's eternal word has to happen according to the time schedule and we're right on time because he's right on time the thing is take your eyes off what you're looking at around you and put your eyes back on the promise the world's getting wicked brother joe absolutely but look at the bride look at the bride look at the manifestation of the supernatural that's being performed in and through the body oh let me tell you probably god will say he says look know this if god is leading the way what difference does it make god will protect you to your destination oh did you hear that little church god will protect you to your destination he says there's no dangers when you're walking with the lord he goes i would believe easily that there was a host of ten thousand angels walking there around that little man and that donkey she was just as safe as she could be speaking about about uh mary there she was just as safe as she could be that may have been robbers all down the street and here he was had a pregnant wife on the donkey leading them down to bethlehem he wasn't concerned about the robbers he wasn't concerned about what he was going to face when he got to bethlehem he knew one thing he said we got to go and be taxed and so when he do he obeyed the word and when you obey the word you do you don't have to have one fear because god will protect you to your destination so i ask you tonight what difference does 2021 make what difference if there is another virus what difference is there more rise or civil unrest what does it matter to the body of christ god is going to protect us into the destination that's one thing i realized a couple years ago when i when i went over to monroe and tried to buy a phone from my daughter and that man held a knife up to my throat god his hand was upon my life and as i looked to my son i said it shows you that god that the satan can't do anything to you but whether god allows it to happen and the god that we serve is greater than the enemy that threatens us each and every day but the bible will tell us we're compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses i can just see him standing over the eternal banister the grandstands looking over that banister cheering us on keep pushing keep running keep moving forward and i say like paul we need to lay us out every weight of sin every weight of unbelief everything that's driving our attention and grabbing our minds and making us doubt the promise and laying aside and run this race tonight let's look at 2021 without redetermination we're going to serve god we're going to live for god we're going to persevere we're going to press on no matter what we face in this life god is for us so who can be against us need to lay aside all the weights of complexes all right get quiet it's okay we all have them but lay them aside lay aside your grudges tonight lay aside your past regrets or your failures lay aside the weights of your fears lay aside depression pornography anxiety lay it all aside tonight and let's put our eyes back on jesus turn your eyes from the disappointments that you faced in the heartaches that you had in 2020 and let's look at 2021 and let's just focus our eyes tonight on him on his promise on the god that does the impossible this message becomes so real to me because there's things in life that we face that we need a god as brother john said the other day with skin on it we need a god that's bigger than our trials we need a god that's bigger than our impossibilities we need a god to come by and reassure us that he's greater and he's bigger and that all things are possible if you can only believe tonight the word here look means to turn the eyes away from other things and fix them on something so turn your eyes away from all these other things tonight and let's fix them on jesus let's turn our eyes away from politics and turn our eyes away from medical science because man they're so confused with this cover 19 it took them nine months to figure it out and they still don't have everything figured out they're constantly changing their their point of view of this one and that one and this and that 14 days 10 days seven days wear a mask don't wear a mask it helps it doesn't help we're just so confused but if our minds and our attention are put back on him we don't care we can go and kiss covet in the mouth and never get it because why because our eyes are focused on him now i'm not telling you to do that but i'm just telling you we could we need to put our eyes back on the supernatural see brother you talk a lot about supernatural you're an emotional kind of guy i'm sorry i am i don't believe in being a boring church i mean if i want to go to a boring church i go to a morgue and i don't like going to morgues i've never been there but i don't have a fancy to look at dead people and nor do i think i need to waste my time coming to church on a wednesday or sunday and thus just coming to a debt service i think we should enjoy serving god i think we should be expecting god to move i think every service we should come with an expectation will this be my service will this be my moment will this be my hour will this be my turn where god comes down in the supernatural and touches me see we need to look put our eyes on the supernatural i know there's others that don't want to believe in the supernatural that's fine don't let them believe they can believe what they want to believe but for me and my house we're going to believe that god does them miraculous we're going to believe in that and brother bannon was saved but brother god always listen now for those that don't believe in the supernatural this is the message escape hither come quickly 1958 he says brother god always vindicates himself by being in the camp with supernatural signs and wonders god always makes himself known he's supernatural and he cannot be anything or work any other way but through supernatural well we don't believe in altar calls and you don't believe in god we don't believe in divine healing you don't believe in god we don't believe in the movement of the spirit where you don't believe in god we don't believe in speaking in tongues well you don't believe in god because god is supernatural and that word supernatural means it goes beyond the existence of the visible i'm gonna tell you we've seen a lot of supernatural take place and even like tabernacle there's a lot of things that god came by to let you know he's on the he's on the uh on the on the on on the well i can't even speak can i but he's on the scene that's what i was looking for god's on the scene tonight he's on the scene for your need many times we look at our neighbors and well my neighbor got blessed and we get all down and out my my neighbor god bless let me tell you when your neighbor gets blessed that should make you happy you say why brother joe because they'll let you know god's on time god's in the service and you may be next oh if he hit your neighbor what about you he's right there god is supernatural we should expect a supernatural in the message of the token the prophet of god will say i'm looking for a time to break forth of the spirit of god in these last days that we're living that we're now living in for another surge of the holy spirit now notice the healing revival is over it's ended but the problem of god was looking back toward it i'm looking for another surge of that the manifestations of signs and wonders he says now i'm looking for another surge of the holy spirit into the church for a rapturing faith just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order for that and i believe that we're now at the time that the word should have preeminence i believe that the time is to lay aside all our creeds and our thoughts and come back to the word so he's on an expectation for a surge of the holy ghost he's not expecting god to drop down in every service and everybody jump up and speak in tongues and run around the church but what he's in what he's expecting is for signs and wonders to surge in and move upon the people and it'll no longer be a one-man ministry where one man has all the power and it seems like it's all coming through that one man but the bible says that we shall do the greater works and he's saying sirs we shall see jesus not jesus justin a prophet but jesus and his bride signs and wonders following the supernatural because the body of christ believes the word of god excuse me for getting a little excited but see he was expecting for another surge of signs and wonders the miraculous being performed i think he'd be happy with even like tabernacle of what's been produced here oh cancer is being defeated parkinson's disease being defeated blind eyes being healed brain bleeds stopped oh let me read you let me read a couple testimonies from my last time i was out in arizona if y'all don't mind me sharing this with you said sunday night i was feeling very sick and i went out i went out of the service this is from brother aaron gara's daughter i sat in the chapel but i ended up missing a good portion of the sermon as brother joe spoke on the pool of bethesda i prayed about how my own lack of faith and desire to be healed from gluten issues and i pray that the lord will start the work and toward the end of the service i went downstairs and i waited in the back brother joe had come to the back and he greeted me and he he stayed standing in the back and i was still feeling pretty bad and i thought to to ask him to pray for me or the thought to asking to pray for me kept coming i didn't want to disturb him but it kept coming and he's right here just asked and i finally did and i told him that i just didn't have faith to believe and i was feeling that it was insignificant and i could just deal with it you know that's what the devil wants you to believe you just can deal with it don't worry you don't have to come up you don't you can just deal with it just deal with your own issue you don't have to have nobody lay hands on you or anything like that and pray for you and she says he told me that i didn't have to he said he told me that i didn't have to ask that if i believed that that he would have faith for me as brother madam said that he and i said yes and so he began to pray and in his prayer he said that he said that us standing in the back together was not a coincidence that it was inspire and it inspired my faith and i realized that the pressure and the pain was gone and i began to rejoice praising and thanking god for what he had done and what he was doing it's now been close to two weeks with me eating wheat almost daily i felt very sick the following saturday but rebuked it and ate it again and again and it left me and i'm completely healed and i'm daily thanking and praising lord he said and she ends it with this and should i add it's been eight years that i've struggled with gluten issues but in one moment's time in the presence of the supernatural then there was another brother brother ed dougal in the same service came up he says i i've had a severe hip and back pain for over 40 years due to a football injury i could hardly walk or bend over to put my shoes on and my socks i felt the presence of the lord nudging me to go through the prayer line but i resisted because i felt that god could heal me where i am that's a lot of us in it and that's okay god can't heal you where you are but there's sometimes you need a god with skin on it he was after several moments i felt the lord nudge me again to go through the prayer line and i came up and i was in lots of pain and after praying i walked back to my seat still in pain but i came back to the evening service and the pain had subsided a lot sunday night i slept for the first time in a long time without pain and i got a good night's sleep i worked all day monday without any pain at all god has completely healed me and now i'm pain-free after 40 years supernatural signs and wonders following the believer sir as we will see jesus we will see jesus manifesting an even like tabernacle and i'm looking at jesus right here tonight those that can believe for the supernatural those that can believe from the prodigals those that can believe for their healing those that can believe no matter what impossibility you face take your eyes off the impossible and put your eyes on jesus tonight well abraham says now i believe that we're now at the time that the word should have preeminence that word there means superiority and if the word is going to have preeminence that means that we got to have the letter and the spirit married together the two got to be unified together and if this the word is to have superiority then it must manifest and produce exactly what it says and it's going to take your faith to put that word in action tonight it's going to take your faith for the 10 winners it's going to take your faith brother daryl brother ron sister erica it's going to take your faith to put that word in action he's a god that heals we've seen it time and time again and i want you to know it's not just for the apostles it's not just for the disciples it's for you it's for this church it's for your family it's for your your home whatever it is god is ready to do it tonight if you can believe so i ask you in 2021 what are you looking for and what are you looking to are you looking to everything that's going on that cnn and fox news and everything is just throwing at you and throwing at you and throwing at you are we looking to the word of god are we looking to this year could be the year that we actually truly see the coming of the lord because our human minds can't fathom how can it go much further so i asked you what are you looking if you look to jesus you're looking to the author in the finish of our faith you're looking to the one that's the giver of life you're looking to the one he's the waymaker and i believe he's made a way for many of us tonight he's a miracle worker and he's performed a many a miracle and even like tabernacle he just performed one for you guys the other night see that's the god that we serve see when you look to jesus you look to the supernatural but here is the thing church tonight you got to recognize no matter how small or how insignificant the supernatural is or appears to be you got to recognize that to be him we turn our bibles tonight to first kings 18 ch verse 41. so first kings 18 and verse 41 so we have to be able to recognize jesus when he appears in his supernatural element and we find here in in first kings 18 and 41 it says elijah said to ahab get up or get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain i like how god does it you know they've been in the three and a half year drought they were tired of it but god had come down and told this prophet there's a sound of abundance of rain you go tell king ahab to get up to drink to eat cause it's about to come a storm and we think we've had a lot of rain in louisiana in which we have but we ain't had rain like they got rain and he says now so ahab went up and to eat and to drink and elijah went up to the top of mount carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and he put his face between his knees what was he doing he was looking unto jesus he began to pray begin to seek god and he said to his servant he says go up now look toward the sea and he went up and he looked and he said there is nothing you know how many times have we gone up how many times we've come to a service looking for god and there was nothing come on church how many times we come with an expectation and we left disappointed and there was nothing but what did elijah tell him he said go back up there again hazel you go seven times and on the seventh time he says i see a cloud rising out of the sea it's a small of a man's hand and the prophet of god said that's the sound of abundance of rain and if you could just recognize all church let me tell you if you can recognize when a little sister begins to call out to god in a service that's the sound of the abundance of rain god is passing by or when our sister begins to speak in tongues and call out oh that's the sound of abundance of rain god is moving in the church in the supernatural realm but you got to recognize it you got to recognize that's that's of god could you just think let's think of how unbelievable look at that little hand huh wing it had rain in a year three and a half years it's so hot and there is a cloud that's all you can produce is a cloud that big you gotta do better than that that's how unbelief but elijah had faith because god had already told them there's a sound coming there's a sound coming into the church it's the surge of the supernatural there's going to be more of what we've seen there's going to be more of what we've been witnessing in this tower it's not just going to be here and even like tabernacle there's going to be testimonies around the world because why because that little cloud became a massive thunderstorm let me tell you that's all that elijah needed to know what that little cloud can rain down upon a nation and let me tell you church tonight all it takes is one little child of god with faith to believe it'll rain down the presence of god in a church service and it'll impact your family from many generations if you can just take god in his word tonight and put your eyes on him elijah he was looking for something to come to bring help to the people and god told them if they would repent something would happen and he was looking and he sent his servant up go up and look something is going to happen three and a half years no rain no cloud not even do fallen but he said go look you come to service sunday and didn't get anything go look you come tonight and it appears maybe you're not getting anything go look you come on sunday morning come looking if you don't get it on sunday come to the next wednesday service looking looking with your eyes i want to see jesus i'm going to see jesus there's a sound of abundance of rain let me tell you the problem of god will say listen tell you what let us do he says let's do like elijah let's get the things right let's get back to god then elijah put his head down and he prayed and he said god he cried out god sent rain and i said that should be our prayer tonight god send the supernatural rain down of your words tonight give us eyes that can see give us ears that can hear give us hearts that can receive and give us the spirit to rejoice in your presence tonight let us not be some old crap down nobody don't want to worship god or worry about what somebody's going to think about lord let us be free to serve you tonight let us be free to worship you you deserve our worship you deserve our praise god don't let me be hell oh god don't let me be held responsible for sending you in the corner and not making you welcome tonight notice now elijah said i hear the sound of abundance of rain go tell ahab to gird up his loin and go go to jezreel because there's a great rain coming but unbelief would say huh if that's all you can see and take it back if that's all church is you can have it if it's all cells and no anchors you can have it it ain't all cells and no anchors this word has got an anchor that can hold you in your time of your worst storm here to hold you like a hell brother gary you may be here tonight just bumping against the ground bum bum bum but you let that bump grab hold one time that's all it takes all unbelief want to tell you well there's no god out there and there's no supernatural and god doesn't do miracles anymore but let me tell you you get on the back side of the desert one time and you meet god and god becomes personal to you there ain't enough devils in hell can explain away god from you then because you've tasted and you've seen and you've rejoiced and you witnessed and you accepted the supernatural and it's changed your life unbelief would have picked that up and throwed it away well that's all you can send me for what did elijah do at the very first wheel turn he said i hear the sound of abundance of rain no cloud no bigger than that that would do how's that going to water a nation why if it's god if it's if it's the clouds it's so hot in them skies he goes down would have been vaporized the vapor would have went away like that but as soon as elijah saw the first time the first little teeny movie said i hear the sound sometimes church i just want you to clue in when we hear like sister atlanta does at times not every service but there's times she grins to call out to god that's the first little move a lot of times that's the first little move we think well that's just her and that's just who she is no that's not her and that's who she is she's not that kind of person but what is that that's a sign to this church that god is here and god is moving and somebody doesn't care what you think about it because they're hearing the sound of abundance of rain and if you would stand where she's standing and where she stood several years ago faith with a a disease that was threatened to take her life let me tell you she rejoices in that sound because she knows and she's testified that there's a god on the scene that's bigger than cancer oh let me tell you if god can take care of cancer for her and deliver her within two months what can that same supernatural god do for you tonight he can save the lost loved ones he can heal the sick body he can deliver from the torment spirit because why all you got to do is recognize the supernatural in whatever element he decides to come notice now brother ram said that elijah was looking for the supernatural he was looking for he came expecting god to move a lot of times i think we come just to come but let's come in 2021 with an expectation for god to move for lebron i mean excuse me brother tim's been preaching on sincerity let us come with an expectation to be sincere at home to pray and to to pray for the services to pray for the ministry to pray well for what god is doing and what god wants to do in this church in your home in your life so we find here that cloud was all that elijah needed and this service may be all that you need tonight to recognize that there's a sound of abundance there's a sound of abundance oh he says we're looking for the coming of the lord we look at the holy ghost following the last days we look at signs and wonders we watch what's taking place don't you see he goes what are you looking at that's exactly what god said would take place he said let faith grab it you see everything that's going on around us that's exactly what god said would take place let faith grab hold of it if the world is getting in their position shouldn't we also get in ours shouldn't we also be under a great expectation that god is about to do exactly what he said he would do he says watch elijah when he escaped notice now we look here in first kings 18 and 46 said the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and he ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel now ahab had a chariot he got on his chair and he ran down well before uh elijah cut off a mount carmel but we found that the spirit of the lord was so strong upon elijah's life that he girded himself and he ran before the horse and before the chariot of ahab and he began to run into the city get them get the rainbows ready for i hear the sound of abundance of rain what are you saying brother joe i'm hearing you tonight church if you just hear the sounds tonight get the rain barrels ready prepare for your miracle believe for the empire get ready to see god pour it out upon the church tonight i hear the sounds of dry bones rattling i hear the sound brother johnny send you in tissue and bones becoming back together in a mighty army being formed i hear the sound of those old those old chains that held you down falling to the ground i hear the chains of prodigals coming home i hear the chains i hear the bride speaking under the inspiration of the holy ghost i hear the sound of impossibilities fading into realities oh it'll sound tonight i heard the sound of people rising up in faith believing that you don't face an impossibility because all things are possible for them that believe but we find if we're not careful they'll try to explain the supernatural away from you they'll try to steal it away from you we find peter when he went to dorcas and he put everybody else out and he went in and prayed with her and he grabbed her by her hand and raised her up see unbelief was safe she was just in a coma and see when you explain the problem of god will say when you explain the supernatural out of the bible you're explaining away the very god that you worship when you explain the supernatural out of the bible you explain away the very god that you claim to worship and then the message of satan's eden for the brahman is referenced in satan he said now satan or he's he says he would exalt himself above the most high he would extend above the clouds and the stars and he would sit there like god and be above the most high and brother bam will say he has succeeded in carrying out his threats he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by what by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of the word to that age satan says i'm going to do this and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do this and preachers have allowed him to explain away the supernatural but there's preachers tonight that refuse to allow him to explain away the supernatural there's preachers in this message that don't believe in the movement of the spirit they don't believe in a prayer line they don't believe in an altar call they don't believe in tongues they don't believe in young people getting on the anointing and running around they make a a a folly about that or ridicule us and say these things they don't believe in the discernment of the spirit anymore they want to put all that on one man if you put all that on one man then you deny the word of god because job gave a promise that i will pour out my spirit and i believe today we're living in that time but the problem is that the people allow the enemy to explain away the power or the value of the word for that age miracles they say that there's days and miracles has passed god don't move like he did in the 40s and 50s that was only for brother branham and they make concessions in this concession in that concession but don't you ever church don't ever let anyone explain the value of this word away from you we need a god that's able to move we need a god that's not limited by your unbelief we need a god that's able to show up when you don't even want them to we need a god that will do a seating abundantly above all that you can even ask or think we need that god here tonight they want to explain and brother brown would say look we've got intellectual giants in the world today that can almost blame everything away you go talk to some some theologian he can explain it all away from you or some intellectual guy some infidel they can explain it all away from you they they can put it all together but if you ever get on the back side of that desert and meet god one time let me tell you a young person you can drift through life only so long you've got to have that encounter you can only play church for so long you can only be a good christian for so long but if you ever get back on the backside of that desert and meet him in that burning bush because it has exactly what you have made up you want victory over pornography get on the back side of the desert you want victory over complexes and family strains being passed down get on the back side of the desert look for a supernatural god look for god is able to break those family ties and break those family curses off your life look unto jesus the author and the finisher of your faith brother brown say where there's a supernatural god there's going to be supernatural things happening because he's supernatural see satan wants you to back up he don't want us to believe for the impossible he wants you to settle for a sofa religion that's what he wanted for moses you just go so far but i think god had a moses on the on the scene at that time says we're not going so far this is where we're going we're going all the way we're leaving and matter of fact moses we're not going to leave a child behind we're not going to leave our family behind we're not going to leave grandma behind we're not going to leave grandpa behind we're not going to leave a hoof behind i mean where's that kind of people tonight say we're leaving this world we're not going to leave our young people behind we're not going to leave a son behind we're not going to leave our daughters behind we're not going to leave the old people behind we're going all the way we're going to take that rapture because god's promised it for us [Applause] but satan wants you to just go so go so far you don't have to believe in healing just settle for medication we got more people on antidepressants today i talked to a young black guy yesterday about a tree job he said man i'm so i i'm on medication for anxiety and all this i said well there's a better physician out there for you than that he said where i said jesus i said man he'll take that anxiety away from me he goes you mean i said you don't have to live on medicine all your life no there's a great physician but see that's the lie of the enemy you have to live on medication you have to live with your pain you have to live with this or you have to cope with this satan don't want you to be delivered he wants you to cope with your enemy or cope with your demons you don't have to cope church we got a promise land in the word if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and we look we've been we've been anointed and we've been given the authority to cast satan out i mean there's no reason that a child of god should sit bound in a service not when there's a supernatural god present with an anointed ministry to do exactly what the word said has to cast satan out see he doesn't want you to believe for the holy ghost you can just be a good christian just sit on a pew be good go to college if that's what you want to do get smart leave your life and just be an okay person but let me tell you when the rapture comes being an okay person ain't gonna cut it anybody know who kirk cameron is he's that movie star that did the left behind series you'll be showing up with him because you can be left behind because god's taking pure bread christians those that were determined i'm not going to settle for a halfway christian life i'm not going to settle just coming to church and wasting my time and everybody else's time see satan don't want you to believe in the miraculous but god wants you to satan don't want you to believe in the supernatural but god wants you to satan don't want you to believe in in miracles but god wants you to let me tell you we sing that song we shall see miracles do you believe that even like tabernacle we're gonna see giants fall we've seen giants fall we've seen john's ball what about your john tonight what about what you're facing like what about your miracle tonight it's not so much just for sister atlanta or sister karen but what about you tonight and if god can do it for them what can god do for me what can god do in my family what can god do if your family may be another another another philip roncalli for so long but all of a sudden he come out of amnesia all of a sudden he come out of amnesia all of a sudden they come out of amnesia and they recognize i've seen this before i've seen this before this is not my home this is not who i want to be now i've seen this before and god began to move for the vic same god that moved on you can move on your son oh yeah don't let we're not limiting god tonight my same god didn't move oh i'm saying he's here tonight if you can just recognize it may be only the size of a five foot six preacher but you can look beyond that bill and recognize he's here and he's here with one focus tonight to this to declare to you he's supernatural and he's ready to embark on your cause whatever your situation whatever your need god is here god is present and god wants you to believe for the impossible but you can't believe for when you got your minds gumming down entertainment and got your mind gumming down video games and got your mind gumming down all the politics of the world we got to put our eyes back on jesus so i start wrapping this down i'm bringing this to a close tonight i know i'm a little bit early but i'm going to go about another 20 minutes lord will it maybe we find here and brother branham preaches in his ministry explained our ministry explained 1950. i want to bring this out because i want to there's a point there's a purpose and a point that i'm going to make on this he said and brother branham is in this this at the end of a service and he begins to go into visions and see people and he says i looked down there was a man on a stretcher laying there i laying here and i looked just above him standing in the midst of the air i seen a fellow worker a fellow working he was a rigger and he was trying to tie a double ship shank on something and not to raise and i looked and i seen the man and i kept watching and i looked to see there and he laid the same man on the cot and i looked back again and that had come before me again and i seen the man fall and i said sir you're a rigger aren't you he said yes sir and i began about so long ago i forgot how long it was you fell and they taken to the hospital and a tall dark headed man with glasses was was your doctor that's right he says your wife is a blond-headed lady you got two small children that's right i said you've been paralyzed and you're back now for three four five years or more he said that's exactly right and he said well i don't understand how do you know that and he said what must i do he said sir i don't know and i started to turn and i looked again and i seen the man and just like same size wearing a brown suit walking right above just above the people's heads going down through the building saying praise the lord praise the lord and i said sir jesus christ healed you stand on your feet notice he says paralyzed from his waist down up he got out and down through the building he went praising the lord notice he didn't wait for the service to be over no the supernatural was there the supernatural begin to discern his heart discern his life and he said stand on your feet and the paralyzed man raised himself up and went down through there praising the lord and he turned brother and said i turned and i looked and i seen a lady sitting in a wheelchair and i seen a woman standing near her a little baby in her arms with the blue blanket and little white fringe hanging around and i turned and looked at the patient again coming this way to me and i looked back and i seen it again seeing if it was a vision was still there and i looked and i seen the lady holding the baby and then it vanished away and the lady was sitting with her hands like this and she was crying i said young lady wasn't you born a she said yes sir i seen a vision of your mother holding in little basket little a little white fringe around it and i just looked like that and it was just standing there right over here set your mother been about 25 years and he calls for the mother to come stand by and said and she said what must i do am i healed and brother baby said i don't know he says sister only thing i can do is tell you what i've seen it's gone from me i can't say nothing but what it tells me to say and he turned from her and i took a look he turned from her and began to deal with another another patient and i took her by the hand and it seemed strange there was a vibration coming of deafness and i said you hear me she said yes sir i said well it's deaf she said i'm deaf in one ear notice how precise god is said i knew it was a deaf spirit i couldn't tell how much she said yes sir i've been deaf in my ears for many years and i said you believe that jesus will heal you if i can ask him she said yes with all my heart i believe it i bowed my head to pray for the girl and when i did i raised up and i took hold of her hand and the vibration wouldn't stop and i started to pray for the girl again and it did not leave her he says then i looked at the girl and i said well that's strange i asked jesus again to heal her and it just held right on well there's something wrong i looked at her like that and i just looked at the girl she was probably about five foot two or three inches tall and i seen the girl right back across the stage that way it went right across the stage and i seen a little girl 14 years old standing there she had long flats hanging down her back little checkered ribbons and i said when you were 14 you were long plastic and she said yes sir i said when you was 14 years old you took the wrong road on a road that's wrong she's you had a baby by a man that was before you were married she said yes sir that's right i said and i said you married the man but you didn't love him that's right you left him that's right then you got with a religious cult and they had to me they had you marry another man that's right you didn't love him and you left him that's right you're married to another man that's it and this she goes and he said you was once a christian and you've gone back and you backslidden on god she said that's right and she staggered like that and was going to fall back to the floor and when she did she screamed and god forgave her and gave her hearing back to her and she received the baptism the holy ghost standing on a platform like that standing there just all at once notice then he turns back to the patient that was in the wheelchair or the and he says i seen the little girl sitting in the chair just as plain as i'm looking at the gentleman here rise up out of the chair only she was dressed different than she was sitting here and she went walking down through the aisle and it looked like she was just waving her hands and saying thank god thank god and i washed it till it faded out and i looked at the little girl and i said sister jesus the son of god has heard your prayers and he's healed you stand on your feet and that girl hadn't walked since she was eight years old and up she got out of the wheelchair and she and there she stood and there she went through the building glorifying god and they moved the wheelchair back and the glory of god swept over the building everywhere and the people began to rise and throw their crutches and their canes and walking he said what is it this is the point i want to make what is it he says that doesn't heal the people to tell you what's wrong with you but here's what it does friends it brings the realization of the supernatural god working in our midst oh one revelation or one discernment after the next discernment one supernatural divine intervention after the next it doesn't heal you to tell you what's wrong with you but what it does to it brings a realization that there is a supernatural god working in our myth so why do we tell you service after service that there is a god that can defeat cancer there is a god that can defeat brain fleas there is a god that can restore hair on a little girl's head is to bring the realization that a supernatural god is visited even like tabernacle and if he can do it for them he can do it for you he can meet your need tonight if you can believe if you'll put your eyes back on jesus oh it's the realization that god is supernatural and he wants his people to believe in the supernatural he's not a dead god he's a living god brother ron he's a living god and what he did for sister atlanta prepare for your miracle sister erica prepare i hear the sound of abundance of rain i hear the sound of the enemies chains falling but see church we gotta say like mary be it unto me you may not be able to figure it all out but that doesn't matter be it unto me and once you recognize the supernatural god and that he cares for you and that you're his child there's not enough devils in hell can make you back up off the promise but you got to realize you don't belong to the enemy you never had you never will you belong to god and because who you are and your position in the body there ain't a devil in hell it should torment you we should be tormenting satan think about if we flip the script on him tonight some of you coming here dragging in because you've been tormented all week and we're only at hump day come on how many is that true don't raise your hands everybody be raising their hands standing up having a rejoicing fit but no we come sometimes on a wednesday i came dragging and i told brother tim said it's been a rough day at the office and we have those days but what if we come with an expectation on the 6th of january 2021 that i'm going to meet god not that i'm going to meet god but god is going to meet me this is my service this is my need some of you been praying for your children for a long time this is my service i'm taking my eyes off the condition i'm taking my eyes off of what i've been looking at i'm taking my eyes off of them going further and further and further in their life getting more wasted and more sorry and more degraded the whole time i'm going to put my eyes back on the promise god i gave them to you on the cradle roll now i'm asking that you move right now here tonight there's not enough devils in hell can defeat you and get you to back up once you recognize a supernatural god is for you tonight we could go on and on but let me just skip down and start bringing this to a close notice when lathros was in the grave martha she met jesus she didn't berate him for not showing up on time she went out to him and fell down and said even now lord whatever you ask god though my brother's dead though his body's embalmed though he's in a tomb and though he stinketh whatever you ask god right now god is able she took her eyes off the problem she took her eyes off the tune she took her eyes off the situation because she recognized she was in the presence of the only one that could speak life so no matter how far that loved one of yours has gone they're never too far gone by what the voice of god can't call them back lathers come forth notice a man that had been dead four days you know martha may have thought well he's finally going to come and preach his funeral he didn't have no expectations of preaching a funeral he said your brother's going to rise because i am the resurrection and the life and if we can have that same faith for our loved ones even now lord even tonight lord whatever you ask god god to do it so the impossibilities church and possibilities are made real when we take god at his word and possibilities fade out when we put our focus on god i preach in 2020 the first service don't lose your vision thinking 2020 was going to be a great year i think we all lost our vision in regards to what 2020 was worth but we never lost our vision of jesus and i come back tonight once again the first of the years they put your eyes back on him take your eyes off all the chaos around us but brandon would say it like this he said god wants you to do the miraculous i don't feel like it brother joe that's beside the point he wants you to do it anyway well it's not my nature well you can either change your nature and take his nature or what god wants you to do the miraculous he wants you to believe the miraculous and by accepting it by faith you prove what you believe he is god wants you to take his word for it he speaks it and god has has said it all heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away as i close on these last two quotes or last two stories here we all are familiar with the story of the man who had a son who was dying with black diphtheria the brotherhood said the young man was unconscious for two days and he went round and round with the doctor before the doctor finally allowed him to dress them up like a you know kind of like they do today you got to put on all this ppe protect your personal protective equipment to go into the room to see a covered patient i mean you look like you come out of a sci-fi movie and so we find the same story here but we get down and brother brown said the nurse she she kind of made a comment you know how some nurses are not tori of course or david or some of the nurses we have here but she said you know your son is dying you know you get someone a little smart that little nurse don't have no conscience of god you know he's dying probably said yeah she did that for my per my benefit he said well he may be but we believe a god that heals you know it's kind of that reminds me and i put myself in this scene because when i went to the doctor when sister karen's at the er and he showed me her scan he said she can live five minutes or five more years but she won't have a quality of life and something just flew out of me right i said we're going to believe god's going to do the impossible then and i ask you church did he did he is he still doing it tonight every day she gets stronger better her hair is growing back longer every day god's still doing the supernatural so we find brother brown says now i just kind of turned she just kind of turned her little painted lips up looked sideways i said let us pray and uh and brother brown his prayer is the lord who made heavens on earth you said whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and it is also written if you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and not doubt in your heart but believe that what you say shall come to pass you shall have whatsoever you say that is your word and that's what we're doing lord and i say i lay hands upon this boy and i condemn that death in the name of jesus christ raised up the whole father raised up he wiped his tears from underneath his glasses and he took the mother by his arms and he said mother just think in the glorious he's going to live now notice the father didn't put his attention in his eyes on his son who was dying but he put his attention on the promise the boy's just as far gone just barely breathing and the wife said oh and that wonderful fred isn't it wonderful he's gonna live now notice their confession was in harmony with one another our son is going to live he's going to make it through this and that little nurse the little nurse just looked up she didn't know what it was all about she said you do understand that the best doctors we got in this country has said that that child will be dead within the next five hours that's just like the devil in it i want to come rain on your parade but devil i hear the sound of abundance of rain i said i hear the sound of abundance of rain she said that cardiogram she said it went all the way down and never in medical history when it ever dropped does it ever come back again that old father walked over there put his arms around that little nurse he said honey i feel sorry for you that's my kind of man i feel sorry for you you're looking at this chart this machine because that's all you're trained to look at she's and he said yeah you're looking at the machine but i'm looking at a divine promise and he says and that's what god made and the prophet god said and it depends on what you're looking at i'm gonna tell you tonight church nurses and doctors they're trained to look at mris and cts and blood pressures and cat scans and all those things but the bride of christ she is trained to look at the supernatural she is trained to expect god to move in the service she's been trained she's got over 40 years in the ministry of the supernatural seeing the movement of the spirit recognizing the small hand of god when it shows up oh yeah it's their business to understand medical science it's our business to keep our focus on the promised word it's our responsibility to look to the word of god and believe for the impossible last quote i promise there in south africa reason there was a man who never had a pair of shoes on his feet he was born to missionary parents and he had the foreign feet club feet that's where his feet were were twisted in he come walking up through there but he was holding a meeting and clubbing his feet along and he had a shoe box under his arm had a shoe box under his arm someone said to him what you got in there he says i got a pair of shoes oh what do you expect to do with them you know how little smart elect devil is what you expect to do with them you're going to give them to your father he said no i'm going to wear these and the prophet of god said before the service was over listen to me church many times we want to wait for the service to be over or many times we want to wait till our favorite preacher comes or we want to wait till sunday we wait to the end of the service where it's climatic he didn't wait to the end of service he came in there they don't even say that he got in the prayer line all this said he had that shoe box in his under his arm and he came clubbing through that and clubbing through that but he had faith that the god he served was gonna do something for him and he said i saw the crippled healed i saw the blind eyes being open he said if god can do that for them surely god can do it for me and what can he do for you tonight even like tabernacle he'd heal sister atlanta he put hair back in a little girl's head he's he saved uh sister kevin from brain please what can god do for you tonight what's under your arm what's under your arm maybe your shoe box is a son maybe your shoe box is a husband maybe a shoe box is you he said i seen god open the blinded eyes i seen god heal the crippled feet and i knew if he can do that for them he won't turn me down and if god can do that for him what can god do for the church tonight what can he do for the bride what can he do for us tonight in this service as we begin to close musicians please make your way back what can god do tonight what can god do in 2021 in your home in your life on your job in this church or in your church what can god do he won't turn you down he won't turn you down until you get that tonight he will not turn you down you've been asking for god to give you a baby he won't turn you down what's in your shoe box did you bring it to church tonight did you bring it to church tonight sister atlanta brought a shoebox sat in the back row one time put a mask on before copen was cool she brought a shoebox though god's healed cancer before and i got in here i got in here i have a healed body sat in the surface and we all know the story round and around she went she didn't wait till the service was over though it happened to be at the end of a service but if god can do that for sister atlanta if god can do that for sister karen if god can put heal brother david dexter's eyes on brother ej's eyes surely he won't turn you down surely if god can do what he did for brother philip surely he won't turn your child down the prophet of god said the son of god can go a long way before he recognizes he's a son and he may get scars on brother philip but there's a realization he won't turn me down so take your eyes tonight off the impossible take your eyes tonight and let's fix them on jesus for the tim you gotta need in your body he's a healer high blood pressure doesn't have to rob you of health of sleep he's a living god he's supernatural and i want to declare to you tonight he's here i want you to just play something softly please he's here [Music] as i was in arizona there was a prayer line we had a prayer line i began to pray for different ones and brother aaron garrett's sister came up for his sister-in-law in the prayer line waiting for her turn to be prayed for and she said she felt something just keep coming up inside of brushing up against her and she looked to think somebody's just bumping against her but the spirit of god was just moving back and forth down that aisle moving back and forth down that aisle moving upon different hearts upon different lives for that dougal 40 years living with pain delivered brother aaron's daughter eight years dealing with gluten issues delivered his sister-in-law i can't he actually just text me the other day and telling me exactly what the lord did for her it's countless church and that's not to brag on brother joe that had nothing to do with brother joe just being a willing vessel to be used of god but it's the people's faith to operate the gift and the prophet of god said if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before their prayer not even cancer so whatever your need is tonight we serve a living god and nothing is impossible nothing is impossible that young man looked at his crippled feet you know he probably got tired of looking down seeing his deformed feet and no doubt the enemy probably said you know what you'll never walk look at you you'll never walk straight he took his eyes off his feet and he saw the realization of the supernatural he said if god can do that for that one if he can do it for that one if he can do it for that one oh he's not going to turn me down and he ran and ran and ran and ran i wonder if we can let god move here tonight what could he do for you what could he do for you tonight [Music] all things are possible if you can believe let us just bow our heads for a brief minute father we thank you lord tonight and lord i know many times as i preach lord i get beyond myself or just the excitement and the emotion of your word i thank you lord and i just learned to operate in the gift you've given and i just trust tonight father trust tonight in your supernatural element lord that you're still a god who was able to discern and move and elevate faith and bring the people into the realm of the supernatural that we can realize that that there's a living god in our midst he's not a god of history but what he'd done in the past he's he can do the same today we're asking lord as you open up blinded eyes do that again tonight you he'll feet do that again tonight you saved from cancer and and cursed cancer and drove it out of a sister atlanta's body we ask that you'll do that again tonight lord you see brother ron he's in a great need father fighting this demon of cancer for many months now but god we're asking the same god that moved on behalf of sister atlanta we ask that you'd move on behalf of brother ron tonight sister erica tonight lord says just cynthia tonight father may you move in the power of your word father and may their faith be elevated and if god can do that for her he won't turn them down so lord we're just asking and we're not only asking but we're believing father because you commissioned us to believe and believers stand on the word of god heavens and earth will pass away but your word never fail so as we stand here tonight at the closing of the service father many many may be here tonight sickness may have ravaged their body but the word would tell us there's a commission that we can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover lord if there's a tormenting spirit may be tormenting the believer there's a commission to the body of christ tonight that we can cast that demon away father we don't have to live in torment we don't have to live in despair and anxiety and worry and fear we're your children lord and we're going to look to the impossible tonight we're going to look beyond the impossible and we're going to look to a god that's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think father i pray that the word now will just settle in the heart of the believer lord you'll anchor their faith father in the rock of ages god as we face 2021 may we face it with a greater determination lord realizing that we've been highly favored and it's time for us to be more sincere and a greater expectation to witness to move another spirit lord my hands are raised tonight father to make that decree to you tonight many times we let things get in the way father maybe not sinful things but pleasures of this life lord and i ask that lord we have a greater commitment tonight to you to your word let our eyes be able to see that still small or hear that still small voice in our eyes see that small cloud rise up from the surface so you begin to move on this heart and that heart and recognize that god is here so we just commit this service to you now lord i just pray your blessings be upon each and every one of us father we love you we thank you for the opportunity we thank you for this church for the ministry you've given us lord that we can we can find shelter under the arms of this message lord we thank you now in jesus name if you've got a need tonight and you would like prayer he's here maybe the devil's lied to you maybe the devil's lied to you and told you there's no hope you've gone too far maybe healing's not for you deliverance is not for you god is here tonight god is here tonight you got a need in your body you got a need in your life i want you to know you can get up and you can come down this aisle tonight and the same supernatural god that was
