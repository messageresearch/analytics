he your God this morning that always always reminds me of Elijah one of my favorite characters in The Bible his name it my God is Jehovah he's God he's Lord over every situation over every problem over every sickness he's God Amen he's my God but you know one thing about him that he said I'm not just just be your God and but he said I'm going to call you my children so you know we even have a greater relationship than just an object of worship because we have a father amen and he owns us he says you're mine he recognizes you identifies himself with you he wants to identify himself with you today amen let's just pray father it's in the name of Jesus that we come that is the most wonderful name that could be put on human lips today or anytime ever since the name was revealed the name of God is savior the god of the New Covenant The God Who washes away our sins and gives us of his own life us into the family I pray your blessings upon us today and that you would anoint us with your spirit Lord and as we look into you Lord may you speak to us there are many many needs Lord in the body of Christ and we just pray Lord that you'll minister to every need those that are watching listening in some of them Lord are would love to be here in the service today but are shut in and can't I pray you'll go to their room where they're at Lord oh God some of them are not even in this state but another but Lord they can't go to church or up in age and and they can't travel but Lord you know they need some of them are here right here in the state some of our Assembly not able to come you know their need father and I just pray you'll minister to them as only you can send forth your holy Spirit Lord we're so glad that you can be here and there at the same time because you're omnipresent Lord that you can be with us even in us to the end of the world so I pray Lord that you'll just come down in the room wherever your people have gathered in this room today where we have gathered may your Holy Spirit have preeminence speak to hearts and lives reveal yourself we pray in Jesus name asking Lord that you would bless the word as we would read it Lord bless the word as we hear it and Lord may it be applied to our hearts in Jesus name amen amen God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord today amen good to seeing you brother Craig already on the screen back there and and have all your family here so we just happy that you're able to be with us God bless you is't it good to be a Christian I don't know what I would do if I wasn't a Christian amen life would be certainly miserable and uh we we I I tell you we we need Jesus we need Jesus amen must be something going on real special at U brother Mark sister Michelle's house this week so got grandparents in we want you to feel so welcome today each one of you that is assembled with us may God bless you in a very special way and speak to you as only he can he wants to reveal himself to you and I know that he will do it amen because you're his children and he cares about you and knows about your need and able to minister to you in a very special personal way and I pray that he will do it today I before I read the scripture I just received this from brother Ron Spencer yesterday he shared this quote with me and brother Donnie Reagan and it explains why we do what we do and he brother brandham said this so what are you worrying about brother brandom why did you preach so hard when you're going to this oh I can't go home satisfied I I must mustn't go by myself these hands will be only mortal once and these lips will only be mortal once and you my brother and sister will only be mortal once and while the spirit inside of me though through tired flesh and weary hours cries to you it is only for one thing and that is to bring you into this Fellowship here not to bring you into the church but to bring you into Christ that in there you have a hope steadfast andure is anchored by an oath of God he confirmed it and run the Forerunner Yonder showing who he was and raised him up on the last on that that day there the resurrection and it proved that we who are in him will come forth in the resurrection and every man that comes through this Veil now justified in the sight of God God looks down and says I have glorified him already and set him Yonder in heaven amen God looks down and says I have glorified him already and set him Yonder in heaven that's what we want today is be in our position in Christ Jesus amen if we can get position there every devil is beneath our feet we're more than conquerors there amen Exodus 12: 21 thank you for all the wonderful music to today and the worship to the Lord and I know he was pleased and he draws near when we worship him he'll come and dwell in the Praises of his people Exodus 12 and verse 21 then Moses called for all the the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and you shall take a bunch of of hisp and and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lentil and the two side post with the blood that is in the Basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning for the Lord will pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood of on the lentil and on the two side posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come into your houses to Smite you God bless you can be seated amen today I want to speak to you on the token applied and display amen last Sunday we was talking about the token on display and I want to cover that thought and subject a little more than what we what we carried it on Sunday you know there's just so much that it's it's such a vital important subject because without the token you can't go in the Rapture you may be saved from tribulation but you won't go to the Rapture and um as like brother brandom said in this quote that we just read you know is is that we don't want to go by ourselves you know and these hands will only be mortal once these lips will be mortal but once you will only be mortal but once so this is our only opportunity and so so he said through the tired flesh and weary hours and cries to you it's for one thing and that is to give give you to bring you into Christ that in there you are have a hope that is steadfast ured and anchored by the oath of God Amen to justify you in your in his sight and to place you into your position in Christ now you know then we have read from the book of Exodus and we also know we are in an exodus and brother randam would preach this sermon call it the highlight of his entire Ministry he would um he would tell us that of all of the sermons that had been leading up except for the opening of the seals that this was the the the Capstone to caping off of so many sermons and that is that you must have the token it is so of vital importance and and how how wonderful it is that we have this vital truth in this day and remembering this that the token could only be applied in the evening time so you know it was a closing out of time in the the time also of the the early um dispensation where the Jewish dispensation was was um being uh was being uh uh ceased and and going out and in that time God gave a token even even on the day of Pentecost we're talking about because as you know death was coming to Israel and to that whole form of religion and they would all die except God would have given a token and of course that token would be the baptism of the Holy Ghost now of go of course now we are in a day and hour where we are also now in another evening time and this is also where another generation is dying death has been pronounced over the last age and we see Poise to ride is the death is a rider Called Death as it will F fully changed to the pale horse rider as the bride leaves and so we're we're in that transition of time and it's a very very serious hour one of the most greatest hours there's ever been and and I I want you to remember as brother Brandon brings this message the token he tells say it it has to be applied in the evening time the evening time message he says is to apply the token so we have come to another evening time and now a closing out of the Gentile dispensation now the Passover began and it would be followed by a feast of seven days of unleavened bread and this the Feast of unleavened bread began with a holy day and it end with a holy day signifying the alpha is the Omega and that the last day will be like the first and the Feast of unleavened bread signifies a time of sincerity and truth and I I think this is very appropriate with us taking communion today you know again because we we want to come to Christ Our Passover with sincerity and truth and these and it and he goes on and we know that for seven full days no leav products remain in the home the an unleavened bread is eaten and God's churches had to do this now for 2,000 years or seven Church ages and we are here you know at the very end of those of the Feast of unleavened bread as it were and um you know this symbolizes removing Sin from our lives and dining on Christ unadulterated truth which is the Passover now the instructions are to take a lamb without blemish and to keep it up H for for five days and and then it while you examine that lamb and and of course we we know this has been a part of other ages and in the reformers where they come to realize that it was Christ and his blood that was important and that we are justified by faith and so you know we had the keeping of the lamb and examining the lamb and many denominations are really good at this they they talk about the worthy lamb and how Christ is is our our true lamb and he was without blemish and his blood atones and and everything else about that but we are now in another day and another hour and that hour is not just about Calvary and what God did 2,000 years ago but right now that the the token or the blood or the Life of Christ must be on display now we noticed in the verse 22 of what we just read that he said and ye shall take a bunch of heup or hup and and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin so here is careful instructions you're going to apply it with his now the token must be applied by hisp because you see hisp is a type of Faith so we we want to understand and realize the importance of faith in the whole process but I I want you to notice it is not just taking hisp and holding hsip in your hand neither is it just striking it with hup it must be dipped in the blood and the blood applied so it is not just faith alone but it also is it must have the blood applied and on display so without it all the believing isn't vain his up without the blood is not going to save you all right so notice it must be applied by his his is a type of Faith you must believe you see faith has it a vital part it he that comes to God Must Believe Hebrews uh 116 for without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe so notice is the first thing coming to God you must believe unless that you have hisp you cannot apply the blood you've got to have faith it is applied with faith it's very vital and important but that's not all of it and here's here lays the problem today is a a lot of people are waving their hiss up and saiding I've had faith in the Lord but have never dipped into the Life of Christ and applied it so they have a profession of Faith holding their hsip up but hiss up without the blood is not going to save you now so he said he must believe that he is that's Hebrews 11:6 put that up and but fa without faith it's impossible to please him he that cometh to God must believe that he is not that he was not that he will be you're going to if you're going to get salvation you're going to have to have a present tense God you're going to have to bring him out of History to present tense if you're going to have healing in your body you got to do the same thing that's your salvation on your on your body realm to do that you have to believe that he is not that he was or will be but he is a present tense God and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so I know this already if I will seek Him diligently he's going to reward me if but the day I seek him with my whole heart that's the day I'll find him now that's the problem many times is is because people give up they pray a few minutes even brother brandham complained about that said people come down to altar pray 5 minutes and give up he said pressy persevere we heard it Wednesday night on you know the importance of perseverance you see again you must because God is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him God wants to give you the Holy Ghost he doesn't want to withhold it from nobody he wants everybody to get it it is the heart of God to save man God so loved the world come on amen it's his heart it's his desire amen if you can even just get this on the Physical Realm you'll just realize this morning God wants to heal you well God don't want to heal me brother Tim no God wants to heal you God wants to save you God wants to bless you God wants to prosper you and he will reward those that diligently seek him so so now John 3:16 everybody knows this scripture for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his world his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved so notice even God's purpose his purpose wasn't to condemn but to save this is the heart of God he's not wanting anybody to be lost you have to fight your way to Hell remember you remember if you take the mark of the beast it is because you rejected the Seal of God it's offered it's available and God wants you to have it he even he even Likens it to a father and a son and the son saying I'm hungry and he said well you know if you ask him for an egg would you give him a serpent if you g asked for bread you know would you give him something something bad a scorpion what if you offered you know would God do that or would your father do that he said no well he said how much more will the heavenly father give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him amen so it is not God holding anything back from you well God just won't give it to me you know you you see again that's not the issue he cannot give it to you as long as sin nature is still living in you there's got to be a death to the old man so you know based you know based on this uh you know as we look at this look Verse 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned that he believeth not is condemned already because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God so it there's a requirement of faith we must believe that's right now but you know to today many are encouraged to pray this simple prayer you know Lord Jesus I accept you as my Lord and Savior forgive me of my sins in jesus' name amen and then they then they say well we believe when you prayed this prayer you got born again well we don't that's right we don't am you see the Bible doesn't teach that and neither does the reveal truth of the message now listen Church there is a a lot a lot of misunderstanding about being born again and Satan did everything he could to to to confuse it to Cloud it so you know to to them early on you know before the Reformation even the Catholics proclaimed if you were born in to the church and you were baptized as an infant and born into a Catholic Family you were automatically born again so you see the whole thing got convoluted and Confused then Luther come along and he said well but the just shall live by faith so now born again takes on a new meaning that if we have faith in Jesus Christ well now we're born again then the Wesley comes along and he comes along and says but you got to be Sanctified you can't be born again and living this kind of life you you got to be born again you believed on the Lord but come on get Sanctified so to others it means Sanctified and and and and others it means speaking in tongues but listen brother bradam said in the message why we had to be Shepherd I know the terminologies of what born again is but let's what what happened in the Bible when they were born again Peter was a Believer the apostles were believer but they wasn't born again until after the Holy Ghost fell on them at Pentecost so let's just get a clear understanding that the the Bible teaches that the Holy Ghost has to come after believing amen after believing let's go to Romans 109 and we'll read this scripture that if Thou shalt confess with thy m M the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thy heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved now this this is a very fundamental starting of the faith that I was talking about and if you believe from the heart confess with thy mouth and believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead you are going to be saved for with the heart the man believe believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made un salvation for the scripture said who believe whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed or disappointed now so so again it is very very important that confession I Lord I'm going to accept you as my savior forgive me of my sin and this is a very start it's the turning around you know you're you're headed this way and you're going toward toward the hell as it was and and repentance is turning around and going back this way going toward Heaven you've got to turn your back to sin and to unbelief amen you you've got to accept him and say Lord I need salvation I I'm a sinner I'm lost and I need a savior nobody can be saved until they first realize I'm lost I need God now Romans 4:3 for what said the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted him for righteousness so notice Abraham believed God and his faith here was counted him as righteousness but after believing Abraham received the Seal of circumcision so what we are saying this after you believe after your repentance after your full surrenderance to God then God will give you the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost now he gave Abraham the Seal of circumcision as a witness it was a sign of the Covenant so like the token we're talking about sign of the Covenant and and so in fact he calls it a covenant this shall be the the or he calls it a token this shall be the token of the Covenant and there that is the cutting off of the flesh now so that is that is why Paul in Acts 19 said to those Baptist Brethren who had Apollos as their pastor and Believe In The Gospel as John had preached said John the Baptist said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed you see they had believed they were they were not yet converted and for many Christians I want you to be careful here listen real close for many Christians Pentecost is an unneeded it's like an unneeded event seemingly a wasted effort it's it don't mean anything why receive the Holy Ghost since all you have to do is believe on Christ as a savior and confess in your mouth that he raised from the dead so for many Pentecost is is not even needed just believing on the Lord is all this necessary the experience of Pentecost is unmar a wasted effort now I want to just I want to lay some things down here for you because without Pentecost you cannot have the Holy Ghost you might have believed on the Lord but without Pentecost and and I'm talking got the experience of Pentecost the coming of the Holy Ghost you cannot go in the Rapture nobody will go in the Rapture without Pentecost now let's just look at this real carefully because even though Jesus died and rose again and Calvary was thorough and complete you still could not be born again until Pentecost that's right Jesus has shed his blood amen amen the lamb had been slain but until Pentecost you could not be born again nobody nobody could be born again until Pentecost and nobody today can be born again without Pentecost anyone without the Pentecostal Spirit experience that follows repentance and profession of faith is still unconverted even though you might have performed the correct right of baptism and use the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and went through all the works with without Pentecost you were not converted now remember the lamb let's go back for a moment let's think about the lamb in the Old Testament the worshipper sin would be transferred from the worshipper to the lamb and the lamb died in his place right now so the Old Testament I I I want to get this clear the old Covenant that's what a testament is Covenant the old Covenant had forgiveness of sins without Calvary that's right by the blood of an innocent lamb God accepted the substitutionary death of a lamb in the place of the death of the worshipper who deserved to die because of his sins now so the Old Testament had forgiveness of sin now here's what the old Covenant brought I I want to just cover it for a minute Leviticus 1711 watch this for the life of the flesh is in the blood Leviticus 17:11 and I have given it for you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is a blood that makes atonement by the life so if you see right here that the the Life is In the Flesh of the blood I've given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that makes an atonement so they had an atonement even in the old Testament or the old Covenant but now let's see what it would do let's go to Leviticus 16 and3 for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you that you may be clean from all your sins before the Lord look how wonderful this is forgiveness of sins an atonement for sin under the old Covenant Psalms 51 and7 said Purge me with hisp and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow so you see by the transferring of the sin from the worshiper on the lamb and the lamb ding in your place you were whiter than snow you were clean you were purged are you with me amen you were clean from all your sins this is what the Bible said and look not only that but Haba habaka 2 and4 says the just or the righteous shall live by faith oh they were living by faith in the Old Testament and they were declared righteous Abraham was Abraham believed the Lord and he counted to him as righteousness so there was faith in the Old Testament Faith under the old Covenant and the just the righteous live by faith and they were declared righteous because of their faith because they believed that when they laid their hands on the lamb and took his life that the God had received their sacrifice and now they were blameless before him so this is all old Covenant let's go to Isaiah 1:18 and he says come now and let us reason together s the Lord though your sins be Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be like wool I you know this is offered under the old Covenant how thorough was it brother Tim all right Psalms 103:12 as far as the East is from the West so he removed our transgressions from us hallelujah this is what the blood of the Old Testament lamb would do for you without Jesus going to Calvary without him dying in your place the lamb you would bring a lamb without blemish and your sins would be forgiven you would be justified by faith you would be declared righteous that's what Justified means declared righteous let's look how th thoroughly this is Isaiah 44:22 I have blotted out as a thick Cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for I have redeemed thee so he blotted out as a thick Cloud thy transgressions though your sins were many Micah 7:18 who is a god like unto thee that paronthi look there's a pardon from iniquity in the old Covenant and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his Heritage he retaineth not his anger forever because he delighteth in Mercy ain't that wonderful to know this God a God who Delights in Mercy and and there again that paronthi what about his memory what what what about that Isaiah 43:25 I yes I am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake and remembers your sins no more this is so wonderful church this is this is what you receive by Believing on the Lord and accepting Christ as your savior pardon for everything you ever did though it was was like a thick Cloud God said I don't even remember it anymore amen you know some people just need a good revelation of [Applause] justification amen that by faith you know God has forgiven you of every sin every evil thought and though it was like a cloud and though though it's been a cloud following you all your life you're forgiven and he doesn't remember it so his history is finished but I want to tell you again before Calvary before the cross through the substitutionary death of the animal lamb the righteous the just live by faith Abraham was declared righteous because of his faith by Believing on the Lord it was imputed to him as righteousness through forgiveness of sin before the cross cross catch this before the cross before Jesus atonement they had mercies of healing hello don't hang up on me catch the significance of this God was Jehovah Rafa God performed Miracles under Moses under the blood of sheep and goats God performed spoken word created flies amen chains of dust into lice all all the great things that he did miraculous under the blood of bulls and goats you know brother Tim why is this even significant because brother brandom tells us over and again if you realize if that can be done under the blood of sheep and goats then what about the greater blood the blood of Jesus Christ if that could position you as sinless before God then what about the blood of Jesus which is a greater blood amen you brought a wonderful grandson to church this morning God bless you brother voice you're here this morning so glad to see you can you stand up with your little grandson brother Wiggins look at there how old is he 8 years old I had I I was a raiser of prized animals I had registered black angles I had registered Nubian goats they want a lot of trophies you love that grandson how many goats would you take for him I had registered Black Angus Top Line how many would you take for him you wouldn't swap him for all that you are you telling me that my beautiful wonderful registered animals would not equal the blood of your cown son well I tell you what all right mine were valuable animals but let's say I took every sheep goat calf ever cleaned animal offering and I would offer it for that one would you take it no you see all of the blood of every innocent animal no matter its value or its worth did cannot equal the value of that one boy but there's another blood that is a greater blood and it not only equals the value of that but every human being all the way from Adam all the way to the last one born his blood is of such worth that it a turn for everybody are you with me now that is the value of the blood of Jesus it's greater than all of the wealth of the whole world one soul brother brandom said is worth 10,000 [Applause] worlds but his blood was not the blood of another man but it was the blood of God that's right now that's why this blood is so great it's so important yet before it was shed they had mercies of healing Miracles were performed before the cross the disciples received power to cast out Devils heal the sick do Miracles you see Miracles can be performed formed and a person not be be spirit filled not even born again the the Old Testament worshipper was not born again his sins were transferred unto the innocent lamb his sins was gone but he was not a new creature he was the same old sinner yeah now was he saved yes he was saved he was saved from sins forgiven yes but not born again yeah they had the spirit as an anointing that came and went it would not even dwell in them do you realize that it was not possible for somebody to be truly Spirit-filled as we experience it today before the coming of the Holy Ghost it was not possible before Calvary the blood of the innocent lamb of the Old Testament could not could not even though it would take away sin in the senses from removing it from the East is from the West all these scriptures that we went through yet the the life of that lamb could not come back and his innocency could not come back upon the worshipper so guess what happened when he got his sins forgiven he walked out there the same old sinner he was when he came inen right his same desires were there if he you know if he had murd desires sexual desires if he had the evil you know thievery desires whatever he went away with the same desires his life was not changed other than his past forgiven now that's where a lot of people will stand you know even at the Judgment that they received him as sick savior but didn't go on to receive his life now so you know but you know as I say in the Old Testament they had the spirit as an anointing and that Spirit would come and go it would come and go and that's way what it is with a lot of people they get the Holy Spirit on them and they'll shout and up and down the aisle and they go out and live a different life an evil life was that the real Holy Spirit could have been they could have they could brother brandham said you could speak in real genuine tongues and still be a devil moved on by the Holy Ghost you seen it I've seen it people moved and and and anointed and shout and everything else now but even on the in the Old Testament this is this is the way it was they had they had the spirit as an anointing that came and went but it couldn't dwell in them listen why is that because there was nothing under the old Covenant that could deal with sin nature and God's not going to live with there being two on your throne him and the devil cuz you were born with the devil right with the serpent nature inside of you that that's how you were born that's why I don't care how good you are as a messy kid how well you've been trained you know how how you've never done this I've never smoked in my life well I had either I never drank in my life well I haven't either but you know but you still need salvation you must be born again it doesn't matter you've been a you've been a better member of the church than the devil well I I doubt that he attends more than you do he in every service but let me just say in the old Covenant the Holy Spirit could not dwell in them now I I know some protest and let's just go through it so we don't leave any Stones unturn because we know John the Baptist it says he had this Holy Spirit from his mother's womb Luke 1:15 let's look at the scripture for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall be neither drink neither wine nor strong drink but he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb let's go down to verse 41 and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary the baby leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost let's look down at verse 67 and his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied now this was the anointing that it came down and they were filled in the sense of that they would filled in the sense to word they prophesied they rejoiced they but the Holy Spirit could not come and indwell man until the Supreme sacrifice Jesus Christ had given his life so so let's just look at this because the Holy Ghost cannot indwell an individual as long as sin nature is still there and the innocent life of the animal sacrificed could not come back on the worshipper so look let's go to John 7:37 let's just see this because scripture doesn't fight scripture we got to just lay it down right you know where you where you see it clearly in the last day that last great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come to me and drink and he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters here's the evidence of the of the Holy Ghost living out of you it's a life dressing up out of you but this he spake of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified so because that Jesus was not yet glorified and ascended into heaven and sent it back nobody could receive the spirit until the day of Pentecost now they could be anointed and they could they they could be like Moses anointed by the spirit of God and come right down and the spirit would come and it would go it would come and it would go it would depart from him it would leave him guess what he'd do when he it'd leave him he lose his temper and smite The Rock instead of speak to it glorify himself and be kept out the promised land guess what happened with Elijah he gets so anointed and the spirit comes upon him he walks right down there man he brings a showdown between Baal and and and and Jehovah and and let the god that answers by fire let him be God he turns the hearts of the children of Israel back to God again then what does he do he runs out of and to the Wilderness after killing 400 prophets and Jezebel says well I'll tell you what I'll hunt him down I'll kill him for what he's done and he goes running the spirit has left him he gets over there somewhere God didn't even tell him to go up to a cave somewhere and God said what are you doing here Elijah I didn't tell you to come here what are you doing here well you know but you see I'm running from my life because why Jezebel said she's going to kill me and I'm the only one and God said no I got 7,000 that has not bowed their knees to bail you know I I you're not the only one but nevertheless you're tired you're weary I'm going to take you home now go and anoint Elisha in your place and then he gives him some other instructions for his leaving but what I'm trying to tell you is the men would be so moved by the Holy Ghost but then it lifts and they go out and do things God didn't tell him to do now let's come back to the New Testament for a moment I want to establish something about Jesus Jesus was the first of a new race right his whole purpose was that he would have more Sons just like him now he would be born of a new race he would be born of the of the spoken word so he would be of the new creation he was not born by sexual birth but of the spoken word so we can say first of all he is the head of the race everything has to come from him he's the firstborn of every creature amen now so let's go to John 1 129 and let's see about this firstborn and let's see what happens to him now here he is he is born and he's a comes about 30 years old and here he comes in obedience to the word to come down to be baptized by the prophet Prophet John now in verse 29 the next day Jesus Jesus or John sees Jesus com to him and said Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world now isn't this strange language can you imagine this is almost blasphemy to Israel they have been told take a lamb without blemish but here's a man and he's pointing out but look here is the true lamb that was only typing it was only reflecting it would only work for a time but look behold look the lamb which cometh to do what take away the sin of the world and this is he of whom I said after me cometh the man that is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore I come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it Abode on him that's right and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water said the same said to me of whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending yes what's these words and remaining on him the same is he that baptizes with the Holy Ghost here's the only one that can give the spirit is the one right here that you see the spirit descending and remaining on notice it wasn't coming and going it wasn't lifted from him and come on immediately after that if if you read in the Bible John you know Luke 4:4 Matthew 4:4 both of them to gives you the same the same story what up Jesus after his baptism he is led to the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil the other says he was driven of the spirit to be tempted of the devil so he was led and driven amen God brought him that listen God Was Not Afraid of this new birth he would allow him not to meet a little minor devil but Lucifer himself now you know you probably have met with tormentors in your life but you probably Lucifer probably hadn't been the one assigned to you one of his imps but coming to Jesus Lucifer himself comes to him there in a moment where he is tempted now here is Eve back over here in the garden and she's tempted of what eating and here Jesus is tempted of what eating and he said if you be now listen listen every time the spirit of God comes upon you you remember this when the Holy Ghost Comes The Devil will still tempt you you're not about temptation you will be tempted in all manners like he was so temptation is not sin it's yielding to temptation is sin and Jesus would meet the devil watch now and the devil would question his his birth experience are you with me he would question and said if you are the Son of God now God had declared by coming down now let me give you this clear every person that ever gets the Holy Ghost gets the same experience Jesus got now it may not be the River Jordan it may not be a prophet who said I saw the spirit so you know but the heaven opens and the Devil comes down and takes his Abode with you that's what happens to every person and it is God saying this is my son whom I I am pleased to dwell in so when the Holy Ghost comes it is God bearing witness that you believed and your sins are gone and that she identifies himself with you that you are his child this is the son I love my beloved Son the son I love every person that gets the holy GH ghost this happens to him like I said maybe somebody didn't see the dove maybe you didn't see the dove but this is what happens a prophet with a prophetic eye said I saw Heavens open and I saw it come down like a dove and here it came it was like a light and said this is my beloved Son I Heard a Voice saying this is my beloved Son so now a prophet may not be standing there and witnessing to you now listen when you got baptized there I tell you what happened you know and and the Holy Ghost came well Heaven opened and a Dove came down I saw it I heard it and this is what it said but friends that's what happened no matter what are you with me now and he says in verse 33 and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptized with water the same said unto me unto whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost and I saw and bear record that this is the Son of God I right here bear record this is God's Offspring and God will do the same thing to you he reveals himself to you you're my child and then you'll be led out and the devil will tempt you in every kind of manner come on it did with Jesus immediately listen Church imagine feeling the precious Holy Spirit Come and dwell in you and then have to face that ugly Spirit of devil oppression if you are a son of God if you really if you really are God's child prove it sir but remember Jesus didn't show off for the devil he didn't obey the devil you don't have to prove him nothing you just stay with what the word said I repented I was baptized he came down he changed my life and I don't care about his ugly breath and his bad feelings I ain't feeling like I felt there at the River Jordan but I I'm feeling this other ugly Spirit but my feelings have changed but God hasn't changed and his word hasn't changed therefore you stay with the word because full obedience to the word entitled you to the Token what does that mean it means I repented and I was baptized in his name though and true repentance and true baptism entitles you to the token so now let's just see if this is true let's go to John 14:16 watch what Jesus said I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever in other words he would come and dwell and he would never leave you even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth and not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so notice as long as Jesus was there he the Holy Spirit could not come so he said I'm going to send another comforter and this comforter will be the Holy Ghost and he won't just walk with you like I've walked with you and you had comfort with me walking among you but now he will be in you isn't that glorious Church what a difference that makes oh yeah it'd be one wonderful it would be wonderful to have Jesus walking with us wouldn't it to have him walking handin hand with Jesus I'm walking with him every day I'm walking with him but how much greater is it for him to W to dwell in you come on because there were times that Jesus the disciples would be sent away in Jesus on a mountain somewhere and now here comes the devil yeah come on but not in this case you can never leave him he can never leave you you are sealed to the day of redemption that's the thing with this Covenant Church when the when the Christ who saves you now comes in you and he abides with you forever not when the first Temptation comes and says if thou be but I'll abide with you for in you forever now sealed to the day of redemption so born again is more than believing and receiveing pardon it's the life or the spirit of Christ the holy ghost coming to dwell in in you forever so you see there without Pentecost man remained forever the habitual sinner with sin nature and after slaughtering the lamb and transferring his sins the worshipper still remained a sinner with the same sinful desires to go into Rapture you must receive your own Pentecost just as Jesus received it at the River Jordan that was his Pentecost you understand where he was filled with the spirit and this is why the Christian Life can be so frustrating is because you cannot live it or be an overcomer without the Holy Ghost this is why you must diligently seek it you see the and it'll be frustrating to you it's like keeping the laws you know you offend in one point you're guilty of all now Jesus first Doctrine was you must be born again very first fundamental Doctrine you must be born again to be in this Covenant you got to have a new birth am there was forgiveness so there's salvation but God wanted more than that for you he wanted Sons birth of his own genus now Peter believed on the Lord but he wasn't converted let's go to Luke 22 and: 31 let's see how wonderful his belief was and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you his wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fell not now he had faith and when you are converted now he's not converted though he has Faith strengthen thy Brethren and he said unto them Lord Lord I am ready to go with you both in prison and to death my faith is built up my faith is I'll tell you what brother I you know I can withstand the test and Jesus said listen you don't have the Holy Ghost you're not converted and I'll tell you what with all of this strong belief and affirmation I'll never I'll never I'll never he said Peter you'll deny me three times for the for the crows th will Thrice deny me that th even knows me so look at it this is why you know you can turn your new Leaf you can vow your vow you can say it's it's kind of like a marriage Pro you know deal you stand up there I'll be true to you I I until death do is pardon I'll be faithful I I I'll be with you in sickness and health you know and this all these vows you make only to be broken because really you're not going to be able to keep it without the power of the Holy Ghost so now again here here he was immediately goes and denies the Lord even though he has a strong faith in this strong acclamation and and confession I'll go with you even to prison and to death and there he stands there warming his hands and are you a galileon no I'm not galileon oh I believe you're one of his disciples no I'm not one of his disciples oh yes you are so he curses to prove he's not so now again we know what the the terminologies of what born again is but well just watch what happened in the Bible when they were born again Peter was a Believer the apostles were believer but they wern't born again till after the Holy Ghost came on them at Pentecost now they were wondering what happened Peter said you men of Israel be this known Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by S signs and miracles and wonders which God did by him who was he was forn to determine that um counsel you took Wicked hands and crucified who God has raised up and we're his Witnesses he shed forth for this that you do and see and hear now and it's according to scripture and they said men and Brethren what shall we do to be saved and Peter said repent so that's a very first thing repentance turning from now do you know we have the power to remit sins in this church the Catholic Church says uh you know whoever sins the pope remits is for forgiven you know whoever's retained is retained but you know we have the power but you know what that power comes by repentance baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost that is the power to remit sin that's right amen this is the authority that God gave us listen brother Bram and God God hiding himself in Simplicity we want you saved friends we want you filled remember you're saved of course but when you accept Christ you're saved but you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost now you know that that's right P Jesus told Peter the night of betrayal he was already saved he said now after you're converted strengthen your brethren that's right oh sure you you've accepted Christ as a savior but when you're converted is when you are really changed that's right and he wasn't changed yet he had cursed before the Lord and denied him and everything but after his conversion after thou converted um strengthen your brethren is that's right that's what the scripture says anyhow that makes it right Jesus told Peter that followed him and cast out Devils done Miracles and everything you're not converted yet but after you're converted then strengthen your brethren so let's just see how wonderful a confession that he has let's go to Matthew 16:13 it's a great confession when Jesus came to the coast accessory of Philippi he asked the disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others jeremias one of the prophets and he said but who do you say I am and Simon Peter answered said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God now Jesus affirms it is a true Revelation for he said he answers said blessed art thou Simon B Jonah for flesh and blood is not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven so Peter had confess that Jesus was the Christ Peter had even been baptized right now listen now you say but we receive the Holy Ghost when we're we're born again when we believe but the Bible said the devil believes also and trembles you say well I live a good life well so had the apostles but they wasn't converted now so you see they had cast out Devils they had healed the sick they had preached the gospel and still were not converted this still happens over and over and over again today people who are never converted and yet they preach the gospel they even have miracles happen without Pentecost we have forgiveness of sins without the changing of our Natures to become a new creature and of course for that to happen there has to be a death of the old man now Pentecost is an experience that every person must have it's a pre it's a prerequisite for the Rapture it's a requirement so you know today we got this organization called Pentecost they are not you can't organize Pentecost right Pentecost is an experience we have methodists in here that got it we have we have Catholics in here that got it we have Baptists that got it we got Pentecostals here that got it Pentecost is experience and if you hadn't if you hadn't had it you can't go into Rapture it's impossible now brother Bram said and I'm going to read it in this entirely Pentecost is experience the methodists get it the Baptist get it all of them get it Pentecost is not organized it's an experience and if you haven't had the experience of Pentecost cost come receive it now remember if you believe me to be a servant his Prophet remember there is a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost right in the midst of all the fanaticism there is a genuine Holy Ghost birth a genuine born of God you come believe it right now so brother Bram tells us if you haven't receive it get it now so so again it will it will make him manifest himself that he is here that and that the holy spirit that you receive as brother brandom said Pentecost is the only thing that is going to prove Christianity you can't prove it by science you can't prove it by nothing but by a Pentecostal experience you Baptist know that you Methodist Presbyterian whatever you are and you know it takes a Pentecostal experience to prove God and that's the each individual it doesn't prove the organization it proves the individual so Believing on the Lord and repentance from sin makes the promise to you as brother brandom tells us in question answers on the Holy Ghost Jesus in Luke 24:49 had commissioned the apostles after they been saved and Sanctified according to the word Justified Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ Sanctified in John 17:17 when Jesus said sanctify them Father through the truth Thy word is truth and he was the word now he gave them power to heal the sick cast out Devils raise the dead they came back rejoicing their names was on the Lamb's Book of Life you remember we went through that now but they wasn't yet converted Peter Jesus told Peter the night of his crucifixion after you had converted strengthen your brethren so they have been Justified and Sanctified are you with me yeah but now they must receive Pentecost now this is the same as Moses a prophet a miracle worker a lawgiver but a man upon whom the spirit ascended and descended but didn't stay didn't dwell in in one of those moments where his temper got out of control he sined by exalting himself kept him out of the Promised Land what was the matter with Moses he wasn't converted get this there wasn't a converted man in the Old Testament it's only at Pentecost you can be converted now there were great prophets in the Old Testament let's name a few Moses Elijah Jeremiah Ezekiel Isaiah and finally it reached the climax and ends with the greatest prophet of all John the Baptist he is the last prophet of the Old Testament because the Bible said the law and the prophets were until John John's the last one now watch let's go to Matthew 11 verse 11 and here's what Jesus said about him verily I say to you among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist hey hey buddy he brought it right down to of all all humankind there's not been a man born among them that are born of women there has not been risen a greater than John the Baptist so here he is the greatest Prophet the greatest man Moses would be a lawgiver Moses would bring water from the rock Moses would would Smite the Egyptians with plagues Moses lives in Elijah what a great man of power but John the Baptist he doesn't even do Miracles but he's got a greater job he introduces the Messiah he says Behold the Lamb of God to take away this sin the world and he's the greatest of all of his Revelation is the greatest watch now notwithstanding notwithstanding am I reading this how many feels like the least in the Kingdom you feel like the least the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than John with your Born Again experience you are greater than Moses greater than Elijah John was greater than them come on I just read it to you in the Bible amen you're greater than John you're greater than anybody any great prophet you're greater than David come on now greater is he that is in you than what David was you David did his exploits they did their exploits but greater is he that is in you amen than any of them in the Old Testament the least the smallest one amen the newborn child I'm talking about into the kingdom just born again newly born again you are greater than any of them with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it sets you apart they were of the old creation you are of a new creation you are of a brand new species how Hallelujah listen when when they come out of the upper room the devil had never seen people like this other than Jesus Christ and he thought he had killed him and done away with him and he done went away back into heaven and he's gone but on the day of Pentecost Here Comes 120 just like him born of The Same Spirit Hallelujah and if Moses could cast him out under the blood of bulls and goost what can you do Under the blood of Jesus Christ the least in the Kingdom your prayers Shake hell your prayers Shake Heaven your prayers Prevail though you're the least in the Kingdom don't underestimate yourself you are the blood wash bloodb Sons and Daughters of the Living God fill with the Spirit it dwell deity God living in [Applause] you Hallelujah greater greater now until you receive the Holy Ghost you're believing unto eternal life but when the Holy Ghost comes in it is eternal life you can never perish you have passed from death un life now it's kind of like this you know brother Brandon would liken it in 59 and also 64 in his question answers he would he would liken it to a conception in the womb you got a little baby born in the womb and when I say born I mean conceived it may be just a little tiny bit of Faith but it's a start that's right now this is what brother brandham told us in the 59 series of the Holy Ghost he said now you've got to protect the woman the church because she's pregnant with children all right and you what now he said Satan will attack the church to destroy those that are just conceived in the womb that's right this is what he does when he brings trouble in this church brings questions brings doubting you know accusations against the ministry accusations against the the the church and you know all this yeah that's Satan be careful what you're Anointed with is Satan because what he wants to do he said you have to protect the woman who's expected with child from the hard bruises of Satan that's right so when someone Falls away let's say supposedly a stalard Christian those that are truly born again it's not going to kill them who's it going to kill those little ones that that that are just conceived in the womb she'll miscarry who will it discourage you know who will you're bickering you're fighting you're fussing you're arguing you're you know you're you're feelings against who are you going to kill you're going to kill those young that are in the womb of the church and you're going to be responsible you know I I know there's some of you right here where I went up and and spoke at a church just before a major major split it was a become a very horrible thing but the spirits was already working and I stood there and I told them I said listen you know you're going to give an account to God for Every Soul every person every person that is wounded and hurt because the church will get hurt and it'll abort the baby you'll cause a miscarriage from this hard bruise and it'll be the young that are hurt now again you're because why you're begotten of the spirit brother Brandon said it's sanctification but never never born of the spirit until the Holy Ghost comes so uh let me just say until the Holy Ghost comes until the Breath of Life enters in you are still in danger of being aborted never come to life this is why it's so important to grow and come on all the way to a new birth and when I'm saying I'm talking about growing through sanctification I don't mean you evolved to get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a birth it's not an involvement uh you know an involving it's the it's a birth it's a life that comes into you now notice so you have the baby's got the life in the womb of the mother little muscles are quivering in his life but it's a different life than what breathes the Breath of Life when it breathes the breath of life into its nostrils then it becomes a living Soul so you see again sanctification is a cleansing it's a prep preparation of life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is life preparation is cleansing The Vessel and the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel sanctification mean cleanse and set aside for service the Holy Spirit puts it in service you are that vessel that God cleaned up now let's just go to Acts chapter 19 and verse one let's just see some Believers here I just I'm going to nail down this part and then we'll have communion and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost and everybody say since you believed now they were Believers but they hadn't even heard that there was a holy ghost I I really don't know how they were in the message and that was the message come on they had recognized John he was Elijah here was promised the Messiah and here somehow another they miss his death burial Resurrection Ascension and coming again I mean the very reason that John was sent to be a prophet was to identify the Messiah and they missed the whole message yet were Believers that God had sent a prophet isn't that amazing I mean you you say how could that be because you see the whole dispensation was being blinded as the eyes of the Jews were blinded and the and the Gentiles were coming in so there was great blindness a darkness in that age taking out the light now we're here over at the last day and people can recognize God sent Malachi 4 Luke 1730 God sent a prophet we got a message and Miss oh yeah right Miss highlight that's right of my entire Ministry what was the highlight of John's Ministry introducing the Messiah and here I am I'm introducing to you the Messiah the token the Holy Ghost it's come again in the evening time they haven't had it in the times past they've had the lamb kept up but now it's evening time and wrath is about to strike and you must have the token and I'm saying look the lamb take his blood and apply it and they miss it totally miss it why because in that kind of Darkness they even crucified their Messiah they got so confused that crucified the Lord Of Glory and Paul said had they had known it they would not have done it and leoa is going to be the same way listen brother bam tells us the closing out if you read the leoan age he will tell you I'm talking about as he preached it in the sermon the of the revelation of Jesus Christ series you take the leoan age brother bradam tells you the reason why that the Jewish dispensation um faded out and went out into darkness was because they made fun of P cost yes they mocked and they made fun of it and they blasphemed the Holy Ghost and when they did they were s in the outer Darkness into 2,000 years of tribulation well we don't have 2,000 years of tribulation for the Gentiles there's three and a half years coming but this is exactly what's happening in this day and hour Pentecost is being rejected and when it's rejected and mocked and made fun of and ridiculed and denied guess what happens to tribulation you go brother brandom tells you in that sermon he said it's Jesus with dirty feet the unwelcomed Christ he comes right back around and he comes right back to the the he said you the the Olive Branch was cut off that the wild would be grafted in but now we come to the end of the Gentiles and now the Gentiles the wild branch is being cut off and the original Olive Branch the Jews being brought back in what happened they rejected Pentecost the token they made fun of those drunk in the spirit they mocked it and said it's some kind of new wine they rejected it cuz we have a lamb and our lamb we've been justified by Faith by believing let's go on so let's look at this they missed the whole point going back to Acts 19 and he said unto them unto them were you baptized well tell me about your works well we got baptized unto John it's baptism all right and so then he says but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe look verse three now and he and he said well how are you baptized and then he said well John baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him who should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied so I want you to notice the Holy Ghost came and it was an experience now we don't care if you prophesy if you speak in tongues just so something happens your life has changed that's what we're looking for amen we're not looking for a certain evidence if it was then we'd have to both of these because they' spoken tongues and prophesied but anyway let's go on the Holy Ghost comes after believing Ephesians 1:13 in whom you also trust after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise notice you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise when after you believed so it starts out with hiss up but it's got to be dipped into the blood and applied it's not enough just to have it in a bucket in your house it's got to be applied now let's go to Acts chapter 8 and verse 5 I want to cover this real close what's this let's see about believing and and receiving the word because today it has been so commonly taught just believe the message you got the Holy Ghost if you if you believe it with all your heart you got the Holy Ghost you know because that's the real evidence you believe the message all right let's just see let's just see this Acts chapter 8 and verse 5 then Philip went down to the city of samarit Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord gave heed to those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles that he did so they see the the Vindication they see Christ preached they see he's a living Christ and they give heed for unclean spirits crying out crying with a loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with PES and that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that City and there was a certain man called Simon who Before Time in the same city used sorcery which the people of Samaria given out to himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest sayth this man is the great power of God what's next and to him they had regard because that of a long time he had Bewitched them was sorcery and when they had believed Philip now get this believed preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women now this is as far as some of our missionaries are taking people that's right believing and baptized teaching the doctrine of the message serpy predestination you believe that oh yeah are we you know okay well now baptism in Jesus name okay get bapti and that's where they leave them right there watch this is where they had come Phillip had brought them this far with miracles signs wonders Vindication with the word he was preaching he had baptized him and look even here Simon himself believed also I'm just telling you what the Bible said Simon believed and he was baptized and he continued with Phillip wondered but holding the miracles signs that were done now when the apostles were which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God I want you to get this they receiv received the word they had believed and were baptized believed baptized received the word sounds pretty good doesn't it sounds complete don't it what's now who when they they sent when that they heard that they received the word of God they sent to the Peter and John who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was falling upon none of them even though they had believed and were baptized and had heard the word what he had fallen upon none of them only that they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus that's the that is is the status of many around the message today they've come that far then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost and after that then Simon is called out as being a child of the devil come on even though he had believed and was baptized he's still a child of the devil amen he had not received the Holy Yoshi had really not ever even come to True repentance he wanted Miracles and signs and have that without an converted life and many will come to me in that day saying Lord Lord have we not done this in your name and he'll say to me to them depart from iniquity I never knew you you know we've had we have made this into a profession of faith I believe the message well brother if you believe the message message you got the Holy Ghost I I talked with a pastor here recently Pastor a large church over overseas and he and and he said brother Tim talk to this brother he's uh he's got marriage trouble and I can't I can't get to the root of his problem I can't help him seem like and I I keep telling him you know you need to grow up in Christ and you know you need to to to have some spiritual growth and he says but Tim you know he's uh been untrue to his marriage vow he's even done homosexual acts I said but brother I said you don't need me to talk to him you need to tell him he needs to be born again he needs the Holy Ghost that's what he needs and he says to me but brother Tim he has the Holy Ghost I said no he doesn't have the Holy he believes the message brother Tim and has been baptized I said he don't have the Holy Ghost if your nature isn't changed I don't care what your profession of faith is the Nature has to be changed you know again I've had conversations with prodal who wonder why don't it work for me they look at others as they see as a model Christian and long to have a Christian Life too but oh it's just not for me I believe the message brother Tim I believe everything you preach well believing is a good start but it's not enough listen the theme of ever Apostles was have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that was the theme of the Bible that was the theme of the book of Acts you will receive power after the Holy Ghost has come on you they had power to cast out Devils before but this power was to live an overcoming life and cast out devils are you with me amen you see again there there is so many that come up to that part and they they say well have this uncertain sound brother bradam called it listen if you'll confess with your lips that Jesus is a Christ take him and take him you have received the Holy Ghost cuz the minute you believe that Jesus is a Christ you have the Holy Ghost that's an uncertain sound well why are people taking this uncertain sound because the devil is doing everything he can to keep you out of the new birth and he'll even let you go to a message Church he'll even let you believe the message as long as you don't get the token here's how brother Brandon felt about it he says applied Church don't fail don't don't don't don't let the sun set don't don't don't rest day or night don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have the token you say yeah I believe yeah I go yeah I believe the message that's all right that's good but you must have the token you hear brandom Tabernacle you must have the token displayed without it all you're believing is in vain you'll live a good life you'll listen to what the word says you'll go to church you'll try to live right that's fine but that's not it when I see the blood that's the token Minister good man moral man whatever you are you know that God's taking cigarettes from you listen to this women you know he's taking shorts and short hair and everything from you you know he did that and then you turn around and do despite and count the blood of the Covenant as a holy Unholy Unholy thing who sent Sanctified and brought you this far like the spies that they come up right to the borderline and they looked over and said well I know it's there but the obstacle is too great we look like grasshoppers they perish in the wilderness borderline Believers don't just come this far say I believe the message you obey the messenger come into Christ so I believe every word you said every word said brother brandom that's good but that's just being able to read take the message taking your heart that you must have the token the very Life of Christ must be in you now I'm going to just read you some Snippets I'm just taking these phrases out because brother brandham this is all from the token he shows the need of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost because listen to me good people good people are going to miss the rapture stop a minute you've seen good people that were deacons starart Christians preachers good people Liv the good life and come up and reach a point and Fall Away I don't want to get at the gate and say you don't have the token I don't want you to miss it that's why I will go over this and come through it with you I don't want you to miss it I want you to be there Heaven Was Made For You Hell was not made for you now listen these are Snippets good people are going to miss a Rapture because of a lack of a supernatural so listen though you've done these things watch I'm just going to I went through the token message and just pulled out these Snips not our membership in churches stop right there the devil don't care you belong to even and light Tabernacle that's right you are not safe from the death death angel will come right in here walk right down the horse rider death will come right in here right ride right into this church and pull you out that's that's right so not our membership in churches though you were baptized you know God took cigarettes from you women you know he's taking shorts and short hair and everything from you show me where I ever stole anything or was ever in the court of law I've never been a bad person show me where I ever committed adultery I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice that's how much I believe it give all my goods to feed the poor so I pay my tithe I I I you know I I do all all these Works watch this not our understanding of the Bible not how much you know about the Bible though you join no matter how much you can explain the Bible you might be a Bible student I'm still quoting you might say I'm a Believer you might you might say you say I'm a scholar I do this that or the other he don't care how much a scholar you are the devil is one too no matter you may have preached the gospel you might have cast out Devils you might have spoke with tongues you might have shouted danced in the spirit I have faith to move mountains and so forth and speak in tongues like men and angels many times you've jumped up and down speak in tongues dance in spirit you might feel good jump up and down you say I was a good person brother Brandon Others May testify I don't care what anybody else says you can't beat that man I never seen him do anything wrong in my life that don't have that don't have that to do with God there One requirement that alone you might be Sanctified being good in other words no matter how good the person was might have been a Bible student might be any kind of good church member might be a good person might be a denominational head might be the hierarchy of Rome doesn't matter what you are how good you are how many churches you join how many good things you've done Bible student student good person church member doesn't mean a thing maybe your father's a preacher maybe your mother's a saint well my son is a preacher your mother say I have got the best boy or the best girl I tell you they're the sweetest thing they've been filled with the spirit and such love their obedience I've never seen such what about you mama my mother is the sweetest thing I know if she dies she's going to heaven cuz she's really got the token brother bradam but what about you sis not her membership in churches not our understanding of the Bible not how much you know about the Bible though you're baptized and you've done all these things like that that still ain't the token the Holy Ghost remember the Covenant blood is not recognized without the token you say well I've been Sanctified from things that's not the token it's the spirit that is the token the spirit of Christ on you that is the identification so now you know I just went through I mean brother Brandon would labor this over and over see it isn't your goodness it isn't a church membership it it isn't um I've quit smoking I quit drinking I I I I I treat the neighbor right now I those are all good right and important and yes I believe a Christian will exhibit that I believe they'll even be a good church member they'll go to church they'll pay their tith they'll do a like all of these things but you must have the token you must you believe like brother bradam said in and he told about how that your birth is a paradox or a miracle every one of you with the Holy Ghost is a miracle amen and you see the why something happened to you for you to be a miracle and unless it happens you can't be a Christian it must be a paradox for you to become a Christian you know where God changes the spirit in the man gives him a new birth for out of that outside of that nothing works God Alone can do that it's a miracle that God can change a man's thinking his ways his life and change it from what what it was to what it can be when he makes it no notic this he gives an illustration I believe he illustrates what happened was called about a boy in his own church now here he's raised in the church he was going with a fine boy a fine girl I meant he was out of a fine family and there was an issue came with him and a girl that he just walked away and he did something wrong and he couldn't apologize like a gentleman should the mother and father called him said brother brandham we'd like to know know what's wrong with our boy and he says the boy was a Christian as far as a Believer he had repented and been baptized and had his position among Believers yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter how much he thought he had you thinking you're having and having is two different things you might try be able to try to say you have you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how much emotions how much you jump or run or sensation speaking in tongu shouting you or whatever you may lay upon it it's all right I believe in that too but unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it you got to show manifest the fruits of the spirit so brother Bram goes to his his jeans and he says now you know natural you're born between a an Irishman and a German do this German family there's a strain in that family they can't say I'm sorry they can't repent they they will look at you and not even talk to you you know they they just stare at you you know you can try to talk to them on the other hand the father is an Irishman and there he's Moody and high tempered and high strong and his whole family is like that except for one other brother or one other person in the family and the mother and the father are both Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and they brought up this young man in the way of the Lord now he's about 18 years old and and a fine kid been a real model boy at home a model kid and and he and you know the the mother's family is she their family being of the German they they won't ask for forgiveness or ask for pardon and he says the other is high tempered and Moody and whatever and he said the genes of this mother and father of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains In the Flesh that's been inner breed into this boy now get this you can take two Holy Ghost filled people and you still birth unconverted children and even though your life has been changed and her life has been changed those genetics come right on down within that unconverted heart are you with me now and he said now you look at your family on this side they're all drunks fighting shooting cutting and then you know and then mother look at your family there a bunch of people sit there won't speak very independent irreverent to religion you know one you know one one apologize can't repent so but not you you're one of of all your siblings you're sweet and kind and forgiven what does that what does it yet you're part of that family tree yet you you've had a paradox a miracle that breed out the genes and changed you into a new creature and you are no longer of the old creation but you're of a new creation you're a brand new species and guess what though that you inherited all of these bad traits amen now they're all cancelled out through the blood of Jesus Christ and now you have the nature of your father which is God's nature Hallelujah that's why you get overcome when your siblings could not overcome but yet you get overcome why because a miracle a paradx took place in you of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that bred out all the [Applause] C amen you got family members that can't believe they can't repent they would keep doing all of this they drink and they they dope and they ever adultere but you're different why a miracle took place a birth took place a miracle of a birth and you're a new creature a new species and they look at you and say why don't you like us and you can't be like them that's cuz you've been changed something made you tender and sweet it's not your it's not your Chans from your old your first birth is Christ that lives in you so you're no more what you are is Christ in you so the father raises up said but brother Brandon my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ water baptism in the pool I know my son has come to Christ see he's done all the outward things I said that might be all right all the outward emotions motions he might be identified as a Believer with the Believers but until he's regenerated born again I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman because he'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in then it will be a paradox himself to take that very nature of a boy that's spread between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's doing trying his best to overcome it and he can't do it he will never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it and when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect Paradox when a man is born of the spirit of God that's what we're looking for that's what you want that's what you want you want to apply the token the life of Jesus Christ and it take out and breathe out by the new birth give you a whole new genealogy now we don't look back to what our mother did and our father did and what our grandfather did I don't care you might have been illegitimate born your father never claims you or you never knew him it doesn't really matter what kind of birth situation you had amen you are now a new creature in Christ Jesus that has bred out all the call and you got an abstract all the way back to calary that your debt is paid in for and you are a son and daughter of God act more than a comfort through the blood of Jesus Christ let's stand together let the musicians come praise the Lord amen thank you Lord thank you Lord aren't you glad I'm so glad that God bred all the pr and Middleton out of me I'm so glad he took that old nature wash it in the sea of forgetfulness gave me a nature like his oh you say well I can't help but be that way that's right until you're born again you can't that's right and then once you're born again you can't help but be a Christian that's who you are why don't you just ask God this morning Lord I might have been born this or that I might be Italian or German or I might be African or Asian or whatever you are but Lord I know I would surrender the old di to yet and be born a new Let The Life of Christ live out in me I want to don't want just outward emotions I want to know that day you shall know that I'm in the father I in you and you in me you can know say Lord I I want that Blessed Assurance let the death angel pass father take these words today as we sing a couple of songs and then we'll go into communion and foot washing Lord I pray that you'll bless your people today they've sat as I've labored as I've tried to break it down as simply as I know how I know there will be some that sit here maybe they've been Christians a long time born again well I didn't even need a sermon like this but somebody had to listen to that while they got saved Lord the most important thing that we can do as a church is give birth to the word of God to see sons and go daughters born that should be our life our desire as a church to be impregnated with the life of God and bring forth children I ask you'll bless us today in your presence now in Jesus name amen search me oh God [Music] today try oh sa my I [Music] pr see there some
