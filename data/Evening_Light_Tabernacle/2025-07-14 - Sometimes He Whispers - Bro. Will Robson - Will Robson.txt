========================================

[Music] It's been one of those days that drives me to my knees. There's more questions than answers. And all of the things I can't figure out leave me with more tears and laughter. I don't know how he's going to move, but I know he knows what I need. Sometimes he's water to the thirsty, sometimes his fire. Oh, consuming. And sometimes his voice is louder than thunder. Sometimes sometimes he whispers. [Music] [Applause] [Music] So I'll be listening while waiting on him. I'll choose to trust and believe. The same one who spoke the world into place is the same one who speaks peace to me. I don't know how he's going to move, but I know he knows what I need. Sometimes he's water to the thirsty. Sometimes he's fire. Oh, consume me. Sometimes his voice is louder than thunder. Sometimes sometimes he whispers. Sometimes he's water to the thirsty. Sometimes he's fire. Oh, consume me. Sometimes his voice is louder than thunder. Sometimes sometimes he whispers [Music] and sometimes sometimes he whisperers [Music] [Applause]
