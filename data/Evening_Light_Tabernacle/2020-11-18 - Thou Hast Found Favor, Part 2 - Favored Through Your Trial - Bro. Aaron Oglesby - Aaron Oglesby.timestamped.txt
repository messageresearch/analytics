[30:31] preeminence lord
[30:33] lord that you would shut my mouth where
[30:34] need be and allow me to speak freely
[30:36] what it is you'd have spoken
[30:38] but we turn our attention to you now
[30:40] lord and ask you to come and ask you to
[30:42] move
[30:43] for truly that's why we have gathered we
[30:45] ask these things in your precious name
[30:47] jesus name amen amen
[30:50] if you would turn in your bibles with me
[30:52] to luke the first chapter
[30:55] and the 26th verse
[30:59] and then when we're done there we're
[31:00] also going to look over in ruth
[31:02] the second chapter
[31:07] amen
[31:14] luke 1 and 26.
[31:20] it says in the in the sixth month the
[31:23] angel gabriel was sent from god
[31:25] unto a city of galilee named nazareth to
[31:27] a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[31:29] was joseph
[31:31] of the house of david and the virgin's
[31:33] name was mary
[31:34] and the angel came in unto her and said
[31:36] hell thou art highly favored
[31:39] the lord is with thee blessed art thou
[31:43] among women we'll look over it now and
[31:46] to ruth the second chapter and we'll
[31:49] start at the 10th verse
[31:53] it says then she fell on her face and
[31:56] bowed herself to the ground and said
[31:57] unto him why have i found grace in thine
[31:59] eyes
[32:00] that thou should take knowledge of me
[32:02] seeing i am a stranger
[32:04] and boaz answered and said unto her it
[32:06] hath been fully
[32:07] showed me all that thou hast done unto
[32:09] thy mother-in-law
[32:10] since the death of thine husband and how
[32:13] that has
[32:14] left thy father and thy mother and the
[32:16] land of thy nativity
[32:18] and art come unto a people which thou
[32:21] knewest not
[32:22] heretofore the lord recompense thy work
[32:26] and a full reward be given thee of the
[32:28] lord
[32:29] the lord god of israel under whose wings
[32:31] thou art come
[32:32] to trust may god add his blessings now
[32:35] you may
[32:35] have your seats
[32:44] tonight we're going to speak on thou
[32:47] hast
[32:48] found favor and with the subtitle being
[32:52] favored through your trials
[32:55] favored through your trials the last
[32:58] time we spoke
[33:00] we spoke on thou hast found favor and
[33:02] we're going to continue that tonight
[33:04] going into
[33:05] favored through your trials and last
[33:07] time when we spoke
[33:08] we saw that mary was visited by an angel
[33:11] with a message
[33:13] and as we know that message came to her
[33:15] and told her that she was going to have
[33:17] a son
[33:18] that the holy ghost would overshadow her
[33:20] and that she was going to bring forth
[33:22] jesus the savior and in the delivering
[33:24] of that message the angel
[33:26] tells mary on two different occasions in
[33:29] their conversation the angel tells her
[33:31] on two different occasions that she has
[33:33] found favor
[33:35] in luke 1 28 it says held art highly
[33:37] favored the lord is with thee
[33:39] blessed art thou among women and then in
[33:42] luke 1 and 30 it says and the angel said
[33:44] unto her
[33:45] fear not mary for thou hast found favor
[33:48] with god and i believe in this day that
[33:50] we're a people that has received
[33:52] this same message i believe that we've
[33:55] heard an angel messenger come and say
[33:57] fear not little bride
[33:58] thou has found favor despite what you
[34:01] see and what's going on around you
[34:03] there's a message that has come to you
[34:05] to tell you that you are in god's favor
[34:07] and this is to put your mind at ease
[34:09] this is to give you peace to understand
[34:11] that his grace and his favor is upon
[34:13] your life and if we'll look to that and
[34:15] look at every situation that we go
[34:17] through
[34:18] and recognize that even in this trial
[34:21] even
[34:21] in this situation i'm still in god's
[34:24] favor his favor and grace are upon us
[34:27] it'll help us to see things through a
[34:28] whole different viewpoint
[34:29] and look at it in a different way many
[34:32] times it's so difficult for us to make
[34:34] sense when the scripture says that all
[34:36] things work together for good and you
[34:38] struggle with that
[34:39] and notice it doesn't say all things are
[34:40] good it says that they'll work together
[34:43] for good and a lot of times the reason
[34:45] we do struggle with that so often is
[34:47] many times we look at things through
[34:48] materially
[34:49] to our flesh how is this helping me and
[34:52] yet many times god looks at blessings
[34:54] and god looks at good through a
[34:55] spiritual standpoint
[34:57] regardless of how difficult this is on
[34:58] your flesh regardless of how difficult
[35:00] this is on your everyday life
[35:02] in the end in eternity which is what
[35:04] matters
[35:05] this is working out for your good and so
[35:08] that's where we have to come to and
[35:09] realize that that we
[35:11] are favored one thing that stood out to
[35:13] me as i studied about mary along the way
[35:16] is is the emphasis that brother branham
[35:18] put on her thinking
[35:20] he put a great emphasis on her thinking
[35:22] and what she was dwelling on and how her
[35:25] thoughts were on the word
[35:26] how her thoughts were on a living god
[35:29] there were a million other things going
[35:31] on in the world at that time that she
[35:32] could have
[35:33] easily been thinking about as she walked
[35:35] along that day
[35:36] her people had become cold and formal
[35:39] and they had
[35:39] they had become a people of tradition
[35:41] they had become lukewarm and
[35:43] and the world politically was in an
[35:45] upheaval there was all these things that
[35:47] she could have put her mind on turmoil
[35:48] and rebellions in the land
[35:50] she could have been thinking about her
[35:51] upcoming wedding
[35:53] that would have been something that
[35:54] would have been very normal for her to
[35:56] be thinking about the upcoming wedding
[35:58] and maybe how are we going to afford
[36:00] this this ceremony that i've always had
[36:02] or maybe the stress of joseph's job and
[36:04] joseph's work and
[36:06] and the things that have been going on
[36:07] there at the carpenty carpentry shop and
[36:10] and how are we going to get all this
[36:11] stuff between now and then and
[36:13] and and there's so much stress and
[36:15] there's this everything's coming up and
[36:16] i'm trying to plan a wedding and this is
[36:18] going on and there's stress
[36:19] and there's uncertainty and yet we find
[36:21] her walking down a path
[36:23] with her mind stayed on jesus
[36:26] we find her walking down a path thinking
[36:28] about his goodness
[36:29] we find her thinking about his love and
[36:31] what a wonderful god he is and that's
[36:33] where her mind is
[36:34] she's thinking about the scroll that her
[36:36] and joseph had read together
[36:38] and because of this brother branham will
[36:40] tell us that's why she receives a
[36:42] visitation
[36:43] church let's get our mind back on him
[36:46] tonight
[36:46] there's been a lot of turmoil in the
[36:48] land in the last few months and even
[36:50] longer than that and with with the cove
[36:52] and the things we've talked about so
[36:53] many times
[36:54] but in this moment let's stop let's
[36:56] recognize where we've been where our
[36:58] focus has been and let's get our mind
[37:00] back on jesus tonight may it be that
[37:03] even tonight when you walk out you can
[37:04] say
[37:05] my mind has stayed on jesus and when i
[37:07] wake up in the morning my mind has
[37:08] stayed on jesus
[37:09] and look things are going to come
[37:11] throughout the day trials are going to
[37:12] come you're going to get hit in the face
[37:14] things are going to stress you out
[37:16] that's part of life but in that moment
[37:17] say god my mind
[37:19] is stayed on you i'm gonna keep my mind
[37:22] stayed on you and on your goodness
[37:25] get your mind back on his goodness
[37:26] tonight back to thinking on eternal
[37:28] things
[37:29] and less about the temporal things that
[37:31] surround us
[37:33] in other words let's prepare ourselves
[37:35] for a visitation
[37:37] let's prepare for a visitation your life
[37:40] may be an absolute turmoil right now
[37:43] you may have had the worst day you've
[37:45] ever had this may have been the worst
[37:47] week you've ever had this may be the
[37:49] worst month you've ever had it may be
[37:50] the absolute
[37:51] worst year of your life and yet i'm
[37:54] telling you prepare for a visitation
[37:57] prepare your hearts prepare your home
[37:59] for a visitation because
[38:01] it only takes one moment in that
[38:02] visitation to
[38:04] change it all that situation you're
[38:06] dealing with and the things you're going
[38:07] through one moment
[38:08] one visitation one second with that
[38:10] presence and it can change
[38:12] everything that you're facing we're
[38:14] gonna keep that in mind tonight
[38:17] one moment one moment
[38:20] listen one moment and let me tell you
[38:23] the devil may tell you that yours
[38:25] isn't coming listen you have a moment
[38:27] you
[38:28] have a moment and that moment is on the
[38:30] way you are rapidly approaching that
[38:32] moment with every second that ticks off
[38:33] the clock
[38:34] every minute that ticks off the clock
[38:35] you are approaching your moment where
[38:38] the angel is going to step on the scene
[38:39] for your need
[38:40] step on the scene for your home for your
[38:42] children for your sickness
[38:43] your moment is coming and you have to
[38:46] have your mind
[38:47] stayed on him so when the moment arrives
[38:49] you recognize the moment
[38:51] don't miss your moment don't miss your
[38:53] moment don't let the moment pass you by
[38:56] don't let the moment be something that's
[38:58] already gone and you say
[38:59] where is it where is it abraham was in
[39:01] the tent door
[39:02] he was in the tent door looking and
[39:05] that's why he had the visitation
[39:07] don't miss your moment because it's
[39:08] coming your moment
[39:10] is on the way you won't miss your moment
[39:14] if your mind has stayed on him
[39:18] brother branham says if you want the
[39:20] honor of an angel visiting your home
[39:24] have a home ready for him to visit
[39:28] ready and under the blood of the lamb
[39:32] the angels of the lord come to such
[39:34] places
[39:36] and the angels come to such people
[39:38] people looking to him
[39:40] people thinking on him people prepared
[39:43] for a visitation be that kind of people
[39:46] tonight
[39:49] so we know mary found favor with god and
[39:52] because of this favor
[39:53] she received a blessing the angel would
[39:55] say blessed art thou
[39:58] among women and she receives the honor
[40:00] and the privilege that she's going to
[40:02] bring forth
[40:03] our lord jesus christ it was a great
[40:06] honor as a matter of fact i would say
[40:07] that i could stand up here and try my
[40:09] best and i would never
[40:10] be able to put into words the magnitude
[40:12] of this honor that was bestowed upon her
[40:14] we could never really truly explain what
[40:16] what an honor this is
[40:18] and that she has found this favor with
[40:20] god but what we don't usually talk about
[40:22] is the struggle that would come along
[40:24] with this favor
[40:28] the lifetime of being shunned
[40:31] the lifetime of ridicule the doubt and
[40:34] the speculation that would follow her
[40:36] every day for the rest of her life
[40:39] she was an unwed mother not only
[40:43] unwed but if you take it a step further
[40:44] and think about unwed and
[40:46] joseph's not even the father of the
[40:48] child
[40:51] in her humanity in that moment
[40:55] we've all been there when you get news
[40:57] or something happens and it's amazing
[40:59] how many things you can think about just
[41:00] in a couple seconds
[41:03] all the things and the situations and
[41:04] you can play out all these things just
[41:06] in a moment
[41:06] in her humanity she had to know
[41:10] in her humanity she had to know i'm
[41:12] going to be pregnant
[41:14] what are people going to say how are
[41:17] people going to treat me
[41:19] i'm going to be an outcast the rest of
[41:21] my life i'm going to be called all
[41:23] manner of names
[41:24] they're going to try to stone me
[41:28] what's joseph going to say
[41:31] think about all the thoughts that must
[41:33] be running through her mind think about
[41:34] all the fears
[41:35] think about satan being there whispering
[41:38] think about the doubt trying to creep in
[41:40] and in all of that the fear the threat
[41:42] of death all the things
[41:43] i'm fisting to give up my entire life
[41:45] i'm fisting to be tormented i'm going to
[41:46] be an outcast no one will socialize with
[41:48] me for the rest of my life
[41:50] be it unto me in the moment when she
[41:53] weighs it out when she weighs the favor
[41:55] of god
[41:56] with the trials and the hardships that
[41:58] are going to come with it her response
[42:00] is that
[42:01] be it unto me she looked at it and she
[42:04] put enough
[42:05] value on god's favor she valued it
[42:07] enough that it didn't matter what came
[42:09] with it in the negative
[42:10] it didn't matter the trials that would
[42:12] come it didn't matter what a tax would
[42:14] come
[42:14] when she put it in the balance and she
[42:16] weighed it she said i want that favor
[42:19] i want that blessing be it unto me lord
[42:22] and tonight i say lord no matter what we
[42:24] go through whatever we have the world
[42:26] may say you're laying this aside and
[42:27] you're missing out on that and you may
[42:29] be called holy roller in old-fashioned
[42:31] whatever be it unto me lord i'll take
[42:34] whatever comes my way as long as i know
[42:36] i'm in your favor as long as i know i
[42:39] have you standing with me by my side
[42:41] be it unto me
[42:46] she deemed his favor greater than the
[42:49] struggle she knew she would face
[42:52] she deemed it greater than any hardship
[42:55] greater than any trial
[42:58] greater church his favor is greater than
[43:01] anything you can name tonight
[43:03] anything you can imagine anything you
[43:05] can hope for god i want
[43:06] your favor it is a greater
[43:10] once visited by the angel once she had
[43:12] received her message she knew
[43:13] no matter what i faced today i'm favored
[43:17] no matter what happens tomorrow i'm
[43:20] favored
[43:21] it was that favor that from that point
[43:23] on would define her life
[43:25] the life of struggle did not define mary
[43:28] the life of struggle is not what defined
[43:31] her and once you have received his favor
[43:33] that is what defines you listen you are
[43:37] not
[43:37] that health problem you were not that
[43:40] depression
[43:41] you were not that anxiety cancer does
[43:43] not define you
[43:45] those suicidal thoughts you've been
[43:46] having that does not define you that's
[43:48] not
[43:49] who you are you have been favored by the
[43:52] lord jesus christ
[43:53] that's who you are that's what he called
[43:55] you he called you bride
[43:57] you are his favored bride the other
[44:00] stuff doesn't define you cast it aside
[44:02] and look on them
[44:03] i will not i will not be made be known
[44:06] as cancer or depression or anxiety
[44:08] i'm going to walk in his favor that is
[44:12] what defines me
[44:14] that is who you are
[44:19] we can't allow satan to elevate the
[44:21] trial or the struggle that we're in
[44:24] to the point to where it outweighs in
[44:27] our own mind the favor that god has
[44:28] given us
[44:31] all that mary would go through watching
[44:34] her son be tortured
[44:37] watching him die the labels that were
[44:39] put upon her
[44:40] well there's his mother that's the
[44:42] mother of the one up on the cross
[44:44] you know about her right you know you
[44:46] know what happened with her right you've
[44:48] heard
[44:48] those crazy stories none of this
[44:51] changed the favor that was given her
[44:55] she knew that she had received a
[44:56] visitation
[44:58] she knew she'd received a visitation
[45:00] here and here's where we're at tonight
[45:01] here's where i want to preach
[45:03] is that your circumstances your trials
[45:08] your hardships whether they be a day's
[45:10] worth
[45:11] whether they be a week's worth whether
[45:13] they be a month's worth
[45:15] a year's worth and and in some cases
[45:18] a lifetime's worth no matter what they
[45:22] are does not change the fact that an
[45:25] angel came to tell you
[45:27] thou has found favor with god
[45:32] none of that changes that thou has found
[45:34] favor with god
[45:37] the satan wants to come and worm his way
[45:39] in and we know that satan is the master
[45:41] of mind games
[45:43] he's the master of torment and he loves
[45:46] to bring doubt he loves to bring fear
[45:48] and he loves to bring worry and anxiety
[45:50] and he loves to attach them to you when
[45:52] you're already low
[45:55] he loves to come when you're already
[45:57] weak when you're already going through a
[45:59] trial when
[46:00] when you are in the fight of your life
[46:03] that's one thing as christians sometimes
[46:05] we need to recognize
[46:06] is we need to be empathetic
[46:10] towards other people's trials because
[46:12] what may be so
[46:13] terrible to me brother joe may look at
[46:15] and go
[46:16] that's got you down or i may see what
[46:20] brother joe's going through and i'm like
[46:22] they don't seem like that big of a deal
[46:26] but i'm not the one in the arena
[46:27] fighting the fight that he's fighting
[46:30] you're not the one in the arena fighting
[46:32] the fight that i'm fighting
[46:34] and so you have to understand that what
[46:36] may seem so simple what may you know
[46:38] well they're going through some anxiety
[46:39] what's the big deal to them it may be
[46:41] the very fight of their life
[46:44] it may be the point in their life where
[46:46] they're at a tipping point
[46:47] god i need you god you have to move in
[46:50] my life god i'm struggling i need you
[46:52] and we as christians need to get behind
[46:53] those people
[46:54] and get behind and realize they are in a
[46:56] fight we are all
[46:58] in a fight and just because i may not
[47:00] understand your trial
[47:01] i understand the god that can bring your
[47:03] trial to an end
[47:05] and i understand that i need to be on my
[47:07] knees crying out for god's people
[47:08] because they are under attack satan is
[47:10] on the rampage and he's trying
[47:11] every little thing listen he studies you
[47:13] in that thing that doesn't seem like a
[47:15] big deal to me he understands that it's
[47:16] a big deal to you
[47:17] and that's where he attacks you because
[47:19] he knows your weakness
[47:21] and as a church body let's come together
[47:23] and pray one for another because every
[47:24] single one of us are in the fight for
[47:26] our lives
[47:27] every single one of us are in a fight
[47:29] we're at the end time and he's pouring
[47:31] everything he's got against you but i'm
[47:33] telling you we're not gonna lose
[47:34] we're gonna overcome we're gonna be
[47:36] victorious because we have found
[47:38] favor with almighty god
[47:42] in these moments the enemy's going to
[47:44] come he's going to begin to torment
[47:46] try to make you question and doubt and
[47:48] most of the time what you find with the
[47:49] devil is he's not going to make you
[47:51] question and doubt god
[47:52] although he will do that but most of the
[47:54] time that's not where he comes
[47:56] most of the time he wants you to
[47:57] question and doubt yourself
[47:59] he wants to come and bring attention to
[48:01] to you and get you
[48:03] to dwelling on you
[48:06] and if he can have you dwelling on you
[48:09] then he's got you dwelling on your worst
[48:11] enemy
[48:13] he's got you dwelling on the one that
[48:15] gives you the most problems
[48:17] he wants to have you thinking about
[48:19] having you think your own thoughts
[48:21] and he wants you thinking on your
[48:22] failures your weaknesses your
[48:24] unworthiness he wants you dwelling on
[48:27] your past
[48:29] and the thing with this is a lot of
[48:30] times he don't even have to do all the
[48:32] digging because we like to dig it up
[48:33] ourselves
[48:34] oh you know what a failure i mean you
[48:36] know how i messed up here and you know
[48:37] how i messed up there
[48:38] no no there's a blood there's a bleach
[48:41] that wiped all that away
[48:43] and and it was put in the in the sea of
[48:45] god's forgetfulness and satan's not
[48:46] allowed to go and get those things it's
[48:48] us sometimes that bring it up
[48:50] it's us that bring up our own doubt it's
[48:51] us that lays our own past
[48:53] trust in the bleach of his blood trust
[48:55] that the work is finished
[48:57] look to your sacrifice and trust that
[48:59] the sacrifice was sufficient that it's
[49:01] finished that those things are in the
[49:02] past and don't allow satan
[49:04] to beat you around a stump over your
[49:06] past at least you have a future
[49:09] at least you have an eternity that
[49:10] you're going to his past is no better
[49:13] than your past it's probably much worse
[49:15] but at least
[49:16] you have a future he has no future in
[49:18] his future he is defeated in his future
[49:21] he is destroyed
[49:22] in my future i will be dancing on the
[49:24] streets of gold
[49:25] while he is in hell in torment paying
[49:28] for the sins
[49:29] that he accused me of that is my future
[49:35] do not do satan's job for him
[49:39] do not give satan a voice let your
[49:42] testimony be
[49:43] i am redeemed i am bought with the price
[49:47] i'm justified i'm sanctified i'm filled
[49:49] with the spirit i am an overcomer
[49:52] say what the word says about you
[49:58] we were taught by a prophet that our
[49:59] mental attitude plays such an important
[50:01] role
[50:05] the thoughts that you dwell on the words
[50:07] you say
[50:09] and just as we know that the right
[50:10] mental attitude towards any promise of
[50:11] god will bring it to pass the wrong
[50:13] mental attitude towards the promise of
[50:15] god
[50:15] will hinder that promise from being
[50:18] brought to pass
[50:20] brother branham says you have to move
[50:21] your thinking get away from reason
[50:24] and move your thoughts from your own way
[50:26] of thinking to what
[50:27] god thinks let the mind that was in
[50:30] christ jesus be in you
[50:32] and then when you begin to think his
[50:33] thoughts you'll begin to live his life
[50:37] listen to that now when you begin to
[50:39] think his thoughts
[50:41] you'll begin to live his life and do the
[50:44] things that he did
[50:47] he says always rely upon him never use
[50:49] your own mind
[50:51] take his thoughts let his thoughts be
[50:53] your thoughts
[50:54] take them into your carnal mind and
[50:56] repeat them over and say oh god take all
[50:58] my doubt away
[51:00] let my thoughts be your thoughts and you
[51:02] sick people do that as we're speaking
[51:05] just take away cast away thoughts of
[51:07] sickness
[51:08] take god's healing thought let them
[51:11] become
[51:11] your thoughts think upon these things
[51:14] the bible said if there be any praise
[51:16] if there be any virtue think on
[51:20] these things so even in the midst
[51:24] of your trial when you're under attack
[51:27] mind body soul
[51:31] every single place that he's attacking
[51:33] he's coming
[51:34] you're under attack think about yourself
[51:37] the way god thinks about you
[51:41] brother timothy's been preaching on
[51:42] casting down imagination
[51:44] cast down those thoughts that come about
[51:46] come against you and let this mind be in
[51:48] you
[51:48] i know the thoughts that i think of you
[51:51] thoughts of good and not of evil in his
[51:54] mind there are no evil thoughts towards
[51:56] you
[51:57] so many times it's what god's judging me
[51:58] i know the thoughts that i think of you
[52:01] his thoughts say i'm healed his thoughts
[52:04] say i'm saved his thoughts say i'm
[52:06] delivered his thoughts say i'm gonna
[52:08] make it his thoughts say
[52:09] i never did it in the first place those
[52:12] are his thoughts
[52:13] that's where we must dwell that's where
[52:15] we must live in his thoughts
[52:17] his thoughts say i am favored
[52:21] in church his thoughts are eternal
[52:23] thoughts they cannot change
[52:27] brother brown says and the only thing
[52:28] you have to do to know he is here is get
[52:31] yourself out of the way see
[52:33] as long as you're in the way then god
[52:34] cannot do nothing for you
[52:38] when you think your thoughts then god's
[52:41] thoughts
[52:41] don't have a chance
[52:45] but if you'll quit thinking your
[52:46] thoughts and think his thoughts
[52:48] my thoughts is not your thoughts he said
[52:51] if there be any praise if there be any
[52:53] virtue
[52:54] think on these things because see this
[52:57] is where
[52:58] the devil would get us when the trial
[53:02] starts
[53:03] when the trouble starts when
[53:05] everything's going against you and it
[53:06] seems like the whole world is falling
[53:08] apart
[53:09] he comes and he whispers this is all
[53:12] your fault
[53:15] you've done something wrong
[53:20] and we begin to question ourselves we
[53:22] begin to examine ourselves now get this
[53:25] we begin to examine ourselves through
[53:27] the filter of the accuser
[53:30] instead of through the word we begin to
[53:33] look at ourselves through the filter of
[53:35] the accuser
[53:36] instead of through the word and through
[53:38] that filter you are a failure
[53:42] through the filter of the accuser we are
[53:44] all failures
[53:45] through that filter we see everything
[53:46] that we've ever done wrong and we begin
[53:48] to wonder
[53:50] am i still in his favor have i sinned
[53:54] is god angry with me does god even love
[53:56] me
[53:58] is god punishing me god have i
[54:01] lost your favor
[54:09] i hate the devil
[54:12] i hate him and just
[54:15] forgive me as i let him know i hate him
[54:18] he's a liar
[54:19] he's a thief he's a murderer he's a
[54:21] vulture he's a snake
[54:23] he's lots of other things that i wish i
[54:24] had words to describe him with listen to
[54:26] me
[54:26] you have not lost favor god
[54:30] loves you satan is a liar he died for
[54:33] you he gave his life for you he sent
[54:34] back the holy spirit for you
[54:36] he sent a message for you and he's going
[54:38] to send you a body change
[54:39] he's going to rapture you he's going to
[54:41] take you home because you
[54:42] have found favor satan is defeated he's
[54:45] a liar and he can't
[54:47] hold you here you're going home you're
[54:49] going in a rapture
[54:50] you have not sinned you have not lost
[54:52] favor you have been forgiven
[54:54] you are filled with the spirit you're
[54:56] his bride he's poured it out upon you
[54:58] and satan is a liar the current trials
[55:02] you are going through are not
[55:04] your fault i'm going to say it again it
[55:07] is
[55:08] not your fault
[55:11] listen to the prophet of god he said job
[55:13] went through trials
[55:14] and the tests his children taken
[55:16] everything else taken
[55:18] the church members came accused him of
[55:19] being a secret sinner
[55:21] they tried to say everything against him
[55:23] but he wouldn't listen to any of it
[55:25] he knew he had met god's requirements
[55:28] he knew that there's no seed of satan
[55:30] trying to tempt him
[55:31] he knowed it was the devil and as long
[55:33] as satan can make him believe
[55:35] now listen as long as satan can make him
[55:38] believe that his sickness
[55:40] was his god doing it he had job whipped
[55:43] but when job once struck that revelation
[55:46] that it was not
[55:47] god he was only going through this trial
[55:49] to make him something
[55:51] it wasn't god doing it it was satan
[55:54] doing it it's not you it's not god
[55:58] it is satan it is your enemy putting you
[56:01] through
[56:02] this it is your enemy bringing this
[56:04] attack
[56:06] it's him trying to get you doubting
[56:07] god's favor
[56:09] oh satan how a liar you are brother
[56:11] branham would say
[56:13] he is lying to you tonight he worms his
[56:16] way in
[56:16] and begins to cause complexes in our
[56:18] mind makes you think less of yourself
[56:20] and digs down deep into your past and
[56:22] into your life and brings suicidal
[56:24] thoughts and brings anxieties and
[56:25] depressions
[56:27] church tonight god's bringing some
[56:28] different thoughts to you
[56:30] cast aside those thoughts you are
[56:32] redeemed you are loved you are
[56:35] beautifully and wonderfully made
[56:36] it is not your fault the trial that
[56:39] you're going through tonight
[56:41] you've been forgiven whatever sin
[56:43] whatever lie whatever thing he's holding
[56:45] over your head he
[56:46] is going to suffer the payment for those
[56:49] sins
[56:50] he's going to pay for it not you you've
[56:52] been bought with the price you've been
[56:53] redeemed the blood has paid for that
[56:55] you never did it in the first place
[57:00] you have not lost favor
[57:07] you're having trials
[57:11] that's a part of life
[57:15] it says when you see something going
[57:16] wrong for a fellow
[57:18] that don't mean that he's being whipped
[57:20] by god
[57:22] it might not even be that he's out of
[57:24] the will of god
[57:26] he knows in his heart whether he's
[57:27] listening to the trumpet or not
[57:30] and we're not saying i'm not trying to
[57:32] say or or
[57:33] make it sound like that god never will
[57:35] use your circumstances to get your
[57:36] attention sometimes
[57:39] we're not saying that god doesn't allow
[57:41] things to come sometimes to draw you
[57:42] closer to him
[57:45] but satan uses these things to make you
[57:47] assume that you are guilty of some type
[57:49] of sin
[57:51] okay and his purpose is to keep you from
[57:53] operating
[57:54] in the full authority and favor that god
[57:57] has provided for you
[57:59] to keep you living below your privileges
[58:01] because when you feel like you're out of
[58:03] the favor of god
[58:04] then you feel like you're not on
[58:05] speaking terms with god
[58:07] because you're not in favor with him and
[58:09] you feel like you're not on speaking
[58:10] terms so you're afraid to approach the
[58:12] king for your need
[58:14] and that's why he tries to keep this
[58:16] over your head but once you realize that
[58:17] you're favored
[58:18] and that you can have an audience with
[58:20] the king and that you
[58:21] are on speaking terms listen once mary
[58:24] realized
[58:25] that she was the virgin from the book of
[58:27] isaiah
[58:28] then all the trials and anything that
[58:30] anybody said didn't matter to her
[58:32] anymore
[58:33] once she found her place in that book
[58:34] and realized that's me
[58:36] that's me i'm that virgin and once you
[58:40] realize that you're that bride without
[58:42] spot or without wrinkle that it speaks
[58:44] of in the scripture
[58:45] then what does it matter what trials you
[58:47] must face what does it matter what
[58:49] somebody
[58:50] would say that's me that's me right
[58:52] there
[58:53] and if i can see myself there that i can
[58:55] see myself in a rapture i can see myself
[58:57] overcoming i can see myself in eternity
[59:00] that's me
[59:08] man has struggled job said that man is
[59:12] born of a woman a few days and full of
[59:14] trouble
[59:17] and yet they are not the reflection of
[59:19] your standing with god
[59:23] he says the cloudy skies and storms of
[59:25] life are no sign
[59:26] of god's disapproval the cloudy skies
[59:30] and storms of life are no sign
[59:32] of god's disapproval neither are bright
[59:35] skies and still waters signs of his love
[59:37] and approval
[59:39] his approval on any of us is only in the
[59:41] beloved
[59:43] his love is elective which he had for us
[59:46] before the foundation of the world
[59:47] does he love us ah yes but how shall we
[59:51] know
[59:52] we shall know because he said so
[59:56] and he manifested that he loved us and
[59:58] he brought us to himself and he gave
[1:00:00] us us of his spirit placing us as sons
[1:00:04] and how shall i prove my love to him
[1:00:07] by believing what he said and by
[1:00:09] conducting myself with joy
[1:00:11] amidst the trials that he in his wisdom
[1:00:15] allows to come to pass how do i prove my
[1:00:18] love to him
[1:00:21] by acting in joy in the trials that he
[1:00:25] and his wisdom
[1:00:26] has allowed to come to pass
[1:00:31] look if you think that the trials that
[1:00:33] you're going through or because of your
[1:00:34] failures
[1:00:35] because of your shortcomings or your
[1:00:37] inadequacies
[1:00:39] or perhaps maybe even some sin i'd like
[1:00:42] you to listen to the description
[1:00:44] of a man in the scripture if we can look
[1:00:46] at job one and one
[1:00:51] if i just read the first verse of job
[1:00:54] i'd say man i'd like to be that man
[1:00:58] if that's where you stopped
[1:01:02] job 1 1 says there was a man
[1:01:05] in the land of us whose name was job
[1:01:09] and that man was perfect
[1:01:13] wow
[1:01:16] perfect what a description
[1:01:19] what a description of a man even written
[1:01:22] under
[1:01:22] under the law you know this isn't even a
[1:01:26] situation where we're looking at it in
[1:01:27] the new testament like where it talks
[1:01:29] about abraham and says he's staggering
[1:01:30] this is right there in the old he's
[1:01:32] perfect
[1:01:35] he is perfect and upright and one that
[1:01:38] feared god
[1:01:39] and eschewed evil what a man
[1:01:43] i i i dare say it's not easy to get this
[1:01:46] testimony written about you
[1:01:49] this is no small achievement let's go
[1:01:52] down to verse 8 it says and the lord
[1:01:54] said unto satan hast thou considered my
[1:01:56] servant job
[1:01:57] this is god himself speaking that there
[1:01:59] is none like him in the earth a
[1:02:01] perfect and upright man
[1:02:05] one that feareth god and skeweth evil
[1:02:07] now notice why job is about to go
[1:02:09] through everything he's about to go
[1:02:10] through notice why the tests are coming
[1:02:12] is it because of his failures because
[1:02:14] apparently he hadn't
[1:02:18] none
[1:02:20] is it because he has sinned
[1:02:23] as we go on satan here it actually
[1:02:25] actually shows his nature
[1:02:28] and it's a nature that you see reflected
[1:02:30] many times in humanity
[1:02:32] and he says in verse 9 then satan
[1:02:34] answered the lord and said doth job fear
[1:02:36] god for naught
[1:02:37] has not thou made a hedge about him and
[1:02:39] about his house and about all that he
[1:02:41] hath on every side
[1:02:42] thou has blessed the work of his hands
[1:02:44] and his substance
[1:02:45] is increased in the land so satan is
[1:02:48] actually accusing job of only fearing
[1:02:50] god because of material blessings
[1:02:53] and what it is is that's satan's own
[1:02:56] nature
[1:02:57] speaking out he would only be
[1:02:59] subservient to god as long as he
[1:03:00] received a reward he thought he should
[1:03:02] receive
[1:03:03] as long as he received the position he
[1:03:04] thought he should receive and the
[1:03:06] honor he thought he was so he's speaking
[1:03:08] of job the way he thinks himself
[1:03:09] job's only doing this because of the
[1:03:10] blessings you've given him and no doubt
[1:03:12] he's encountered this
[1:03:14] many times in many different people ever
[1:03:16] since the fall had taken place
[1:03:17] and so he just assumes job is just like
[1:03:20] all those other people and i'm telling
[1:03:21] you
[1:03:22] satan has probably encountered that same
[1:03:23] attitude in different churches and
[1:03:25] different denominations down through the
[1:03:27] ages as he come with this temptation
[1:03:28] in this trial and they fell away when
[1:03:30] the material blessings fell off or when
[1:03:32] things got harder where things got
[1:03:33] difficult and he's looking at this
[1:03:35] church
[1:03:35] and he's looking at this bride and he's
[1:03:36] saying no doubt they will fall the exact
[1:03:39] same way that these other did
[1:03:40] but i'm telling you there's a there's a
[1:03:42] church here that's like job
[1:03:43] that says no matter what happens no
[1:03:46] matter what comes my way
[1:03:47] i'm gonna serve him because i know my
[1:03:50] redeemer lives
[1:03:52] i know what he's done for me i've seen
[1:03:54] the change in my life
[1:03:55] i know and it doesn't matter what trials
[1:03:57] it doesn't matter what i'm stripped of
[1:03:59] or what's taken from me
[1:04:00] i know my redeemer lives he may come
[1:04:03] against us thinking we're going to fall
[1:04:04] like everybody else but this one will
[1:04:06] stand
[1:04:07] this one will stand the test of time
[1:04:09] this one will go home in a rapture
[1:04:15] he accuses him of serving god for the
[1:04:18] material blessings
[1:04:20] verse 14 we're going to go through this
[1:04:24] and i'm going to skip some as we go just
[1:04:26] to get the point it says then there came
[1:04:28] a messenger unto job and said the oxen
[1:04:30] were plowing and the ass is feeding
[1:04:31] beside them
[1:04:33] and the sabians fell upon them and took
[1:04:35] them away
[1:04:36] they have slain the servants with the
[1:04:38] edge of the sword verse 16
[1:04:40] while he was yet speaking there came
[1:04:42] also another and said the fire of god
[1:04:44] has fallen from the heavens and hath
[1:04:45] burned up the sheep and the servants
[1:04:47] verse 17 while he was yet speaking there
[1:04:50] came also another and said the chaldeans
[1:04:52] fell upon the camels and have carried
[1:04:53] them away and slain the servants
[1:04:56] and while he was yet speaking
[1:04:59] guys this is just
[1:05:03] while he was yet speaking there came
[1:05:04] also another and said thy sons and thy
[1:05:06] daughters
[1:05:07] were eating and drinking wine in the
[1:05:09] oldest brother's house behold there came
[1:05:11] a great win from the wilderness smoked
[1:05:12] the four corners of the house it fell
[1:05:14] upon the young men
[1:05:16] and they are dead
[1:05:20] now notice here
[1:05:24] there's a key in the scripture to how
[1:05:27] you overcome
[1:05:28] when you're in the deepest darkest
[1:05:31] trials of your life
[1:05:33] first of all we've established that job
[1:05:34] is not going through this because of any
[1:05:36] shortcoming or any sin
[1:05:38] hear that for yourself you're not going
[1:05:41] through the trials of life that you're
[1:05:42] going through because of anything you've
[1:05:43] done wrong
[1:05:45] but here is a key that job that's
[1:05:47] written in the scriptures how you
[1:05:49] overcome and how you rise above when
[1:05:50] these things come upon you when
[1:05:51] everything is dark
[1:05:53] and everything is against you verse 20.
[1:05:56] then job arose
[1:05:57] rent his mantle shaved his head fell
[1:06:00] down upon the ground
[1:06:02] and blamed god
[1:06:06] fell down upon the ground and said i
[1:06:07] know i've done wrong
[1:06:10] fell down upon the ground and said i've
[1:06:13] sinned
[1:06:15] it's all my fault fell down upon the
[1:06:18] ground and fell into a deep state of
[1:06:19] depression so that everybody could see
[1:06:21] how awful his day had been and how awful
[1:06:23] his life was
[1:06:24] and began roaming to and fro looking for
[1:06:26] people to feel sorry for him
[1:06:32] i dare say that there's never been
[1:06:35] another day
[1:06:36] like the day job experience to one
[1:06:38] person
[1:06:40] and he fell upon the ground and
[1:06:44] worshipped
[1:06:48] that guy set the standard really high
[1:06:54] really high because it's so easy to get
[1:06:56] down
[1:06:57] but the minute you get down is the
[1:07:00] minute that he hits your ear
[1:07:02] and begins to talk but let me tell you
[1:07:03] what when you're walking through this
[1:07:05] world in the midst of chaos and you're
[1:07:06] praising god
[1:07:07] and your mind is on god and you're
[1:07:09] worshiping god and you're thanking god
[1:07:11] despite what happened at work yesterday
[1:07:13] and despite what you know you're gonna
[1:07:14] face tomorrow but you're thanking god
[1:07:16] anyway
[1:07:16] and you're worshiping god anyway you
[1:07:18] give the devil no foothold
[1:07:20] you give the devil no place to even come
[1:07:22] in and attack you don't even let him see
[1:07:24] for a moment and the devil's sitting
[1:07:25] there going i thrown everything at this
[1:07:27] man i
[1:07:28] put everything on him i put and he won't
[1:07:30] crack no matter what i put on those
[1:07:32] people and even like tabernacle there's
[1:07:34] a shout and there's a praise
[1:07:35] and there's a worship that comes out of
[1:07:37] their life and i can't
[1:07:38] stop them i can't make them crack
[1:07:41] because in the midst of it all
[1:07:42] they worship the king of kings in the
[1:07:45] midst of it all their life
[1:07:46] is a praise and there is the key
[1:07:50] there is a key right there to getting
[1:07:52] through your trials and through your
[1:07:53] hardships
[1:07:54] and job says naked i came out of my
[1:07:56] mother's womb and naked
[1:07:57] shall i return thither the lord gave and
[1:08:00] the lord hath taken away
[1:08:01] blessed be the name of the lord in
[1:08:04] all of this job sin not nor charged god
[1:08:08] foolishly and this wasn't even the end
[1:08:10] of the testing
[1:08:12] this is the first chapter
[1:08:15] that's chapter one
[1:08:19] brother brown says but all at once all
[1:08:22] the people got against him
[1:08:23] yeah everybody turned him down then the
[1:08:25] cyclones come killed his children
[1:08:27] killed all of his animals everything he
[1:08:29] had was gone
[1:08:30] then comes some of his then comes some
[1:08:33] of his
[1:08:34] very best maybe the deacons of his
[1:08:35] church see come to give him comfort
[1:08:38] and they were accusing him now job you
[1:08:40] know a man that was favored with god
[1:08:42] like you
[1:08:43] and all this happened to him there has
[1:08:45] got to be something wrong
[1:08:47] you've done something wrong
[1:08:50] job said i'm satisfied that i never my
[1:08:54] heart is clean before god
[1:08:56] i've made my sacrifice there you are
[1:08:59] then stand on it if you met god's
[1:09:02] requirements you stay
[1:09:04] right there don't you move
[1:09:08] church the sacrifice has been made the
[1:09:10] atonement has been made
[1:09:12] stand on it and don't you move
[1:09:15] no matter what the enemy says no matter
[1:09:17] what come stand
[1:09:18] right there stand right there at calvary
[1:09:21] where the blood was shed for your sin
[1:09:23] for your mistakes for your past stand
[1:09:25] right there
[1:09:26] and don't you move tonight don't accept
[1:09:29] anything that the devil would put upon
[1:09:30] you because you
[1:09:31] are justified you are sanctified you're
[1:09:34] bought with the price tonight
[1:09:38] you can say exactly like job said i know
[1:09:41] my redeemer lives
[1:09:45] but why is it because he doesn't want
[1:09:47] you to recognize the favor you have
[1:09:50] because he knows that if you operate in
[1:09:52] that favor you are absolutely
[1:09:54] unstoppable
[1:09:55] he knows that when you operate there he
[1:09:57] he can't stop you when you come to the
[1:09:59] revelation of who you are
[1:10:00] so he tries to cover you up and he tries
[1:10:02] to cover you up and he tries to bury you
[1:10:04] and i like that little saying i saw the
[1:10:06] other day said satan must not know i was
[1:10:08] a seed or else he wouldn't have buried
[1:10:09] me
[1:10:10] he must not have realized that all you
[1:10:12] is going to do is come on right on up
[1:10:13] through that and sprout out anyway
[1:10:15] because he can't put enough on you
[1:10:17] he can't bury you deep enough there's a
[1:10:19] son calling there's a deep calling to
[1:10:21] the deep and it doesn't matter what he's
[1:10:22] put on you and your life
[1:10:24] you are a seed and you will come up
[1:10:26] through that
[1:10:27] you will break through you will overcome
[1:10:29] because that seed
[1:10:30] has been germinated by a message that
[1:10:32] said you
[1:10:33] are highly favored it's germinated that
[1:10:36] seed
[1:10:36] something has awakened on the inside of
[1:10:38] you and all this stuff's on top of you
[1:10:40] but it won't stop you
[1:10:41] because the sun's drawing you the sun's
[1:10:43] drawing you and you're going to come
[1:10:45] forth
[1:10:46] and you are going to be beautiful just
[1:10:47] like he said you'd be without spot
[1:10:49] and without wrinkle
[1:10:55] he wants you to fail to operate
[1:10:58] and grasp the favor that god has
[1:11:00] bestowed upon you
[1:11:04] this goes back to the quote he knows
[1:11:07] that if the people get the true
[1:11:08] revelation of the true church
[1:11:10] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:11:12] that she can do the greater works
[1:11:14] and she will be an invincible army
[1:11:17] so everything he does is to keep you
[1:11:19] from that revelation
[1:11:22] because when you operate in the
[1:11:23] revelation of who you are
[1:11:25] that you are the very queen of heaven
[1:11:27] that you are
[1:11:28] bone of his bone that you are flesh of
[1:11:31] his flesh you are absolutely unstoppable
[1:11:32] you are that invincible army that he
[1:11:34] spoke of there in that quote
[1:11:37] never doubt god's favor in your life
[1:11:41] based on earthly circumstances
[1:11:44] circumstances do not change favor
[1:11:47] job did not lose favor
[1:11:52] listen if you have repented
[1:11:55] you are forgiven of every sin
[1:11:59] and every wrong you ever committed
[1:12:03] stand right there
[1:12:06] stand right there you you
[1:12:10] are forgiven
[1:12:15] now listen on the other hand if you
[1:12:17] truly need to repent of something
[1:12:20] then repent and move on
[1:12:23] repent and move on it's that simple we
[1:12:27] over complicate it so much
[1:12:28] we make it so difficult just repent and
[1:12:31] move on don't stay there and wallow in
[1:12:32] the mistake
[1:12:33] don't put yourself through some
[1:12:35] purgatory of your own creating
[1:12:38] repent move on brother bradham would say
[1:12:42] may the grace of god the power of the
[1:12:44] holy ghost if there's any evil in our
[1:12:46] hearts
[1:12:46] any evil in our hearts lord reveal it to
[1:12:50] us first
[1:12:51] and we'll make it right and then we know
[1:12:53] we have favor with god
[1:12:55] that seems so easy so simple we're going
[1:12:58] to repent we're going to make it right
[1:12:59] and then we know
[1:13:01] then we know that we have favor with god
[1:13:04] we have peace with god we get what we
[1:13:07] ask for because we have no condemnation
[1:13:11] granted lord in jesus name i pray
[1:13:14] amen it's over the thing you've been
[1:13:17] dealing with and the thing that's been
[1:13:18] tormenting you and the thing that's been
[1:13:20] fighting you it's over
[1:13:22] move on from it walk away from it
[1:13:25] walk towards that well body walk towards
[1:13:28] that deliverance
[1:13:29] walk towards that peace in your home
[1:13:31] walk towards that peace in your own mind
[1:13:33] walk away from the anxiety walk away
[1:13:35] from the sin that has been hindering you
[1:13:37] or what satan has been trying to put on
[1:13:39] you walk away from it repent
[1:13:41] and move on tonight because every single
[1:13:43] time you have a trial or every time you
[1:13:45] have trouble you
[1:13:46] can't go back to your mistakes and say
[1:13:47] well this is why this is why
[1:13:49] why why why why and you're bringing them
[1:13:51] up and you're bringing them up walk away
[1:13:53] from them
[1:13:53] quit going back to them every single
[1:13:55] time you're going through let me tell
[1:13:56] you why you're going through this
[1:13:58] you're going through this because god
[1:14:00] knows you're going to make it out
[1:14:02] you're going through this because god
[1:14:04] knows you will
[1:14:05] overcome it that's why you're going
[1:14:08] through it
[1:14:09] the prophet of god says right here now
[1:14:11] remember when god has counted you worthy
[1:14:16] same reason job went through it you've
[1:14:19] been counted
[1:14:20] worthy is why you're facing this trial
[1:14:23] you have been counted worthy is why
[1:14:25] you're facing this test
[1:14:27] god has counted you worthy when you have
[1:14:29] a test now don't
[1:14:30] fail this don't fail to get this when
[1:14:33] you have a trial or a test
[1:14:35] it shows the grace of god has found
[1:14:38] you have found favor with god
[1:14:43] and the devil's been telling me this
[1:14:44] whole time i was going through this
[1:14:45] trial because i was out of favor with
[1:14:47] god
[1:14:48] a prophet says you're going through this
[1:14:50] trial because you found
[1:14:51] favor with god amen it's very true
[1:14:55] his thoughts are not our thoughts
[1:14:58] it's very true because us as humans
[1:15:01] would never think that or say that
[1:15:04] but a prophet of god says you're going
[1:15:05] through this because you have found
[1:15:06] favor with god
[1:15:07] and god believes that you will stand the
[1:15:10] test
[1:15:10] you remember he did the same thing with
[1:15:12] job satan said oh yes i've seen job down
[1:15:15] there
[1:15:15] said he's god god said he's a perfect
[1:15:18] sermon there's none in
[1:15:19] a perfect servant there's none in the
[1:15:21] earth like him there's nobody like job
[1:15:23] he's a perfect
[1:15:24] man now my he's my pride and joy satan
[1:15:27] said oh sure he gets
[1:15:28] everything he asked for said let me have
[1:15:30] him once said i'll make him curse you to
[1:15:32] your face
[1:15:33] said i'll just make him curse you god
[1:15:35] said he's in your hands but don't you
[1:15:37] take his life see
[1:15:38] god had confidence in job amen
[1:15:42] when it looks like everything has gone
[1:15:44] wrong
[1:15:45] god is giving you a trial he's got
[1:15:48] confidence in you
[1:15:50] he don't have to baby you around you're
[1:15:52] not a hotbed plant
[1:15:53] a hybrid you're a real christian
[1:15:57] the devil's been telling you you're not
[1:15:58] a real christian while you're going
[1:16:00] through this brother brown says you're
[1:16:01] going through it
[1:16:02] because you're a real christian because
[1:16:04] god's got confidence that you're going
[1:16:06] to overcome
[1:16:07] he's given you a test see to see what
[1:16:09] you'll do about it amen
[1:16:11] no wonder peter said these fiery trials
[1:16:13] why count it's joy
[1:16:14] it's more precious to you than gold and
[1:16:17] many times we hum-haul
[1:16:18] oh well if i just well that will that's
[1:16:21] something god gave you
[1:16:23] he said well that's something god give
[1:16:25] you to overcome
[1:16:26] he knows you'll do it he's put his trust
[1:16:30] in you he's put
[1:16:34] his trust in you i'd like each and every
[1:16:37] one of us right now to remind the devil
[1:16:39] and let him know from your own lips
[1:16:41] god has confidence that i'm going to
[1:16:44] defeat you
[1:16:45] god has confidence in me you've been
[1:16:47] trying to tell me i'm a nobody you've
[1:16:49] been trying to tell me i'm no good and i
[1:16:51] can't make it i'd like to tell you that
[1:16:52] the king of kings
[1:16:53] and the lord of lords has looked down on
[1:16:55] me and said i've got confidence in you
[1:16:57] i believe you'll overcome laodicea i
[1:17:00] believe you'll make it through
[1:17:01] i know you're going to overcome you have
[1:17:03] my favor
[1:17:05] i've got confidence in you satan he
[1:17:08] has confidence in me
[1:17:11] he has confidence that i'm going to
[1:17:13] overcome him i've been
[1:17:15] hand picked for the trial that i'm in
[1:17:17] the middle of
[1:17:18] handpicked by god satan came in
[1:17:22] whispered satan came i'd like to tell
[1:17:23] him you thought that this trial was
[1:17:24] going to destroy me
[1:17:26] you thought this depression was going to
[1:17:27] destroy me you thought this sickness was
[1:17:29] going to destroy
[1:17:30] me you thought this stuff was going to
[1:17:31] bring me down and all it's done
[1:17:33] is brought jesus on the scene from my
[1:17:35] case all it's done is brought me closer
[1:17:37] to my lord and savior
[1:17:38] and because of that satan you are in big
[1:17:41] trouble
[1:17:42] you're in big trouble because now jesus
[1:17:44] is on the scene it was the waves that
[1:17:45] was trying to sink the boat that jesus
[1:17:47] came walking on
[1:17:48] and when he got there the devil didn't
[1:17:50] stand a chance he's walking on the ways
[1:17:52] of your life tonight
[1:17:54] he's walking on the waves coming to your
[1:17:56] boat in your trial and that trial that
[1:17:58] satan sent to destroy you
[1:18:00] is bringing jesus closer and he's coming
[1:18:03] right now to your pew
[1:18:04] to your situation to your trial because
[1:18:07] you're going to be victorious
[1:18:14] the thing is
[1:18:19] when it's all said and done i'm going to
[1:18:21] be stronger
[1:18:24] closer to god and blessed more than i
[1:18:26] ever was before the trial even started
[1:18:30] that's in the scripture i see it right
[1:18:33] there in job
[1:18:35] job 42 and 10. and the lord turned the
[1:18:39] captivity of job
[1:18:40] when he prayed for his friends also the
[1:18:42] lord gave job
[1:18:44] twice as much as he had before so the
[1:18:47] lord blessed the latter end of job
[1:18:49] more than his beginning for he had 14
[1:18:52] 000
[1:18:52] sheep six thousand camels and a thousand
[1:18:55] yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses
[1:18:58] he had also seven sons
[1:19:01] and three daughters
[1:19:04] job knew what it was to go through hard
[1:19:06] times
[1:19:08] and yet in the hard times he found
[1:19:11] that he was favored
[1:19:18] what favor are we seeking
[1:19:23] what is it that we're putting first
[1:19:25] place
[1:19:28] what is it that keeps drawing us back
[1:19:29] when he's right there with his favor
[1:19:31] trying to give it to us trying to offer
[1:19:33] it to us
[1:19:35] now we won't be able to get into this
[1:19:37] tonight but even though we have found
[1:19:39] favors bestowed upon our life he still
[1:19:41] desires that we seek his favor daily
[1:19:44] he still desires that we look for his
[1:19:46] favor in every situation that we seek
[1:19:48] his favor and we seek his will
[1:19:53] hard times come
[1:19:57] usually unexpected
[1:20:01] and when they do what you're going to
[1:20:02] find out church is that the only way
[1:20:04] you're going to make it through those
[1:20:05] hard times is if you're 100
[1:20:06] sold out if you've given everything you
[1:20:10] have and you're sold out
[1:20:12] you can make it through the trial we
[1:20:15] find in the scriptures that hard times
[1:20:16] came for naomi and ruth
[1:20:20] and ruth makes a decision i'm going to
[1:20:23] sell out
[1:20:25] i'm going to go all the way notice when
[1:20:28] they get there and things aren't just
[1:20:30] perfect and things aren't rosy and you
[1:20:31] know she comes to this
[1:20:33] this new land after her husband had died
[1:20:35] and her brother-in-law had died and her
[1:20:37] father-in-law had died and everything
[1:20:39] had turned against them and
[1:20:41] and she and she tells naomi i'm going to
[1:20:42] go with you
[1:20:45] and she gets to this new land and a lot
[1:20:46] of times when people make moves or they
[1:20:48] go places or there's a change in season
[1:20:50] you hope when you get there things are
[1:20:51] better
[1:20:52] you go there expecting things to turn
[1:20:54] many times in the middle of a trial
[1:20:57] you think you're just about to turn the
[1:20:58] corner and you do
[1:21:00] you turn the corner and you realize
[1:21:02] there's more of this ahead of me than
[1:21:04] there is behind me
[1:21:05] maybe i went around the wrong curve
[1:21:08] and we get our hopes dashed because we
[1:21:10] thought that was the end
[1:21:12] we thought that was the answer i thought
[1:21:13] for sure that was it this time
[1:21:15] i thought for sure it was over with
[1:21:18] ruth and naomi get she comes back with
[1:21:21] naomi
[1:21:22] and things are no better as a matter of
[1:21:24] fact things are
[1:21:25] not good at all
[1:21:29] to the point that they're gleaning for
[1:21:31] food now
[1:21:32] if you do a little bit of research you
[1:21:34] find out this is what the poor
[1:21:36] beggars did if you're gleaning for food
[1:21:40] it's because you're starving
[1:21:43] you don't have your own so you're
[1:21:45] relying upon the goodness of others to
[1:21:47] allow you to get their scraps
[1:21:51] things aren't good for and yet notice
[1:21:54] that she doesn't run back
[1:21:57] as soon as times get tough remember
[1:22:00] she's gleaning she has no other source
[1:22:02] of food she's on the very verge of
[1:22:03] starvation
[1:22:04] and she doesn't look back to moab and go
[1:22:06] i know if i go back there i could be
[1:22:07] welcomed back to my father's home and he
[1:22:09] would take care of me
[1:22:10] i know if i go back to moab i'll have a
[1:22:13] better life
[1:22:13] and the food was better and i had plenty
[1:22:15] to eat notice she's actually just the
[1:22:17] opposite of what the children of israel
[1:22:18] did
[1:22:19] the children of israel the minute the
[1:22:21] trials hit they're like well we can go
[1:22:22] back to egypt
[1:22:23] but she's different she's made of
[1:22:25] different stuff
[1:22:26] when the trial hits it's not i'm going
[1:22:28] back it's i've made my decision
[1:22:31] and i'm going to stand right here no
[1:22:32] matter what it takes i'm going to stand
[1:22:34] right here and fight this battle
[1:22:36] your god will be my god your god
[1:22:39] will be my god and i'm going to stand
[1:22:42] right here and that's what we've been
[1:22:43] trying to tell you tonight stand right
[1:22:45] there
[1:22:46] stand right there and she doesn't look
[1:22:47] back to mobad moab but she says i left
[1:22:50] everything behind it doesn't matter how
[1:22:53] hard life gets i'm going to stay right
[1:22:55] here in this land church
[1:22:56] you've been returned to the land you're
[1:22:58] in a good land
[1:22:59] and sometimes things get hard sometimes
[1:23:01] things get tough stay in the land
[1:23:04] stay in the land that's where you're
[1:23:05] going to be blessed that's the only
[1:23:07] place you can be blessed
[1:23:10] ruth says it doesn't matter if i have to
[1:23:11] glean to survive
[1:23:13] it doesn't matter i'm willing to do it
[1:23:15] so be it i'd rather glean
[1:23:16] here i'd rather struggle here i'd rather
[1:23:19] have hard
[1:23:20] times here than ever go back to what i
[1:23:22] came from
[1:23:23] church that's got to be our attitude i
[1:23:25] will not go back
[1:23:26] it matters not how hard it gets i'll
[1:23:28] glean here i'll struggle here
[1:23:30] i'll fight right here if needs be i'll
[1:23:33] die here but i
[1:23:34] will not go back i have sold out
[1:23:39] your god will be my god listen that's
[1:23:41] the attitude
[1:23:43] that's the attitude that will find favor
[1:23:45] with the kinsmen
[1:23:48] a sold out attitude that's the attitude
[1:23:51] that finds favor with the chemism
[1:23:52] this is where you find favor in your
[1:23:55] situation
[1:23:56] you sell out you don't turn back
[1:23:59] you stay with the word brother branham
[1:24:01] says the reason the church lost favor
[1:24:03] with god is they straight away from the
[1:24:04] word
[1:24:06] stay with the word and the lord of the
[1:24:08] harvest
[1:24:09] takes notice when you stay there and you
[1:24:13] stand there he takes notice listen ruth
[1:24:15] chapter 2 verse 8.
[1:24:18] then said boaz under ruth hearst thou
[1:24:20] not my daughter
[1:24:22] go not to glean in another field neither
[1:24:24] go from hence
[1:24:26] but abide here fast by my maidens let
[1:24:29] thine irons be on
[1:24:30] eyes be on the field that they do reap
[1:24:32] go thou after them
[1:24:33] have i not charge the young men that
[1:24:35] they shall not touch thee and when thou
[1:24:37] art a thirst go into the vessels and
[1:24:39] drink
[1:24:39] of that which the young men have drawn
[1:24:42] then she fell down on her face and bowed
[1:24:43] herself to the ground and said unto him
[1:24:45] why have i found grace in thine eyes
[1:24:48] that thou should
[1:24:49] take knowledge of me seeing i am a
[1:24:51] stranger
[1:24:52] he noticed that she had sold out
[1:24:56] listen in verse 11. and boaz answered
[1:24:58] and said unto her it hath fully been
[1:25:00] showed me
[1:25:01] all that thou hast done unto thy
[1:25:02] mother-in-law since the death of thy
[1:25:04] husband
[1:25:05] how thou has left thy father and thy
[1:25:07] mother
[1:25:08] in the land of thy nativity and our come
[1:25:10] unto a people
[1:25:12] which thou knewest not heretofore
[1:25:15] now notice what ruth seeks at this point
[1:25:17] she's already been given permission to
[1:25:18] glean
[1:25:20] she's been given permission to glean she
[1:25:23] has permission to go around and find the
[1:25:24] scraps
[1:25:26] but listen to what she seeks she
[1:25:29] recognizes the importance
[1:25:31] of his favor verse 13.
[1:25:34] then she said let me find
[1:25:38] favor in thy sight my lord
[1:25:41] for that thou hast comforted me and for
[1:25:43] thou has spoken friendly unto thy
[1:25:45] handmaid
[1:25:45] though i be not light unto one of thy
[1:25:47] handmaidens
[1:25:49] the prophet of god says and did you
[1:25:50] notice naomi returned in barley season
[1:25:52] just exactly at the right time when they
[1:25:54] were gathering barley and boaz was her
[1:25:56] kinsmen
[1:25:57] and he was harvesting his great fields
[1:25:59] the lord of the harvest
[1:26:01] and ruth the young gleaner went out into
[1:26:03] the field to glean a type of the gentile
[1:26:05] church gleaning
[1:26:06] picking up just what they could the
[1:26:08] gleaners going ahead
[1:26:09] oh they say you all haven't got the
[1:26:11] pentecostal blessing oh yeah
[1:26:13] we're gleaning all right look at the
[1:26:15] lord of the harvest when he looked down
[1:26:17] and seen the little woman ready to glean

[1:56:00] that one moment oh i remember that one
[1:56:03] moment
[1:56:06] when my wife was blind peripheral vision
[1:56:10] gone laying in a bed
[1:56:14] being helped to the bouncing back and
[1:56:16] forth
[1:56:17] with a brain bleed a little grandson
[1:56:21] sat down at the end of the bed
[1:56:24] crippled never was able to walk
[1:56:28] 18 months old couldn't get up
[1:56:31] couldn't stand by himself
[1:56:35] or able to get up off the floor by
[1:56:37] himself
[1:56:40] one moment one moment that's all it took
[1:56:45] and one moment it changed forever
[1:56:49] eyesight came back a baby walked
[1:56:53] didn't walk he ran all over the house
[1:56:57] one moment one moment in his presence
[1:57:01] can change you forever
[1:57:04] oh i tell you you need to be looking for
[1:57:06] that moment
[1:57:07] you need to be expected for that moment
[1:57:10] you ought to be living for that moment
[1:57:12] remember when the angel will come by
[1:57:14] your way
[1:57:16] but you made him welcome you've been
[1:57:18] talking about him you've been praying
[1:57:19] you've been
[1:57:20] reading the word of god you've been
[1:57:22] listening to the tapes you've been under
[1:57:23] expectation
[1:57:24] and in that moment he comes just that
[1:57:27] one moment
[1:57:29] he changes things forever
[1:57:33] one moment a beggar in a field
[1:57:36] the next moment the owner of the field

[1:58:30] the things for job he could say your
[1:58:33] touch

[1:58:46] is
[1:58:50] [Music]
[1:58:53] had that never happened to job
[1:58:57] he would never have the revelation when
[1:59:00] the clouds roll back
[1:59:01] and the sun is coming through and say i
[1:59:04] know my redeemer lives
[1:59:07] and then the last day he'll stand
[1:59:10] and i'll know him i'll see him for
[1:59:12] myself and not another
[1:59:15] it was that those trials that brought
[1:59:18] him to that great revelation
[1:59:20] and it's these things in life that
[1:59:22] brings us to places
[1:59:25] but we receive that one touch from god

[1:59:33] touch
