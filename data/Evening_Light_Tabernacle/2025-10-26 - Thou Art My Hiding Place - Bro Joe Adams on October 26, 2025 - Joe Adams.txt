Father, that's our desire today, Lord, is just to have you come, Lord, not only for that meeting in the air, but come in this service today. Father, may you come and minister to hearts and to [music] lives, Lord. Lord, as brother Johnny prayed, Father, asking [music] for the presence of the Lord to draw nigh to each and every individual. Lord, you know exactly precisely what we have need of this morning. And Lord, as we had heard, this is a predestinated moment. You knew who who all would be in attendance today, Lord. [music] Those that would be on the stream, those that would be present. And father, we just inviting you to come. Come Jesus. Come. Come today, God, and fight our battles. Come today, God, and Lord, relinquish us from the fears that we faced [music] and anxieties, Lord, the trials of this life. God, come and bring peace that surpasses, Lord, all understanding. God, come today, Lord, and move as only you can. as the great creator of heavens and earth. God, we ask to and we invite you, God, to come and just speak mightily, speak boldly, speak precisely, God. Lord, do the work of a surgeon this morning, Father, and just begin to go down the aisles of our heart today, Father, and minister, Lord. We invite you, God, and we commit [music] this service to you now, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. Well, we bring greetings to you this morning. Great to be home. We were just in Los Angeles last weekend. We did a wedding there. Uh first wedding I've ever done, brother Mike. And it was a Hispanic wedding and the brother there was a pastor in West Cavina and he had asked me about a year ago. He said, "When I get married, I want you to do my wedding." And I'm going to tell you, it was an experience of a lifetime. We had a wonderful time. And you know, they do things different, different culture, but we had a wonderful time. and the brother and his wife now are happily married and he's a very intense brother kind of like brother Tim just word word just always focused on on study and everything but he had a smile on his face I said but it's the best day of your life and it was and we got him happily married and then we we my wife and I flew down to Gulf Shores for a few days of vacation we drove in yesterday so we're here to be in service with you this morning and trust that the Lord to speak to us I want to speak to you this morning know, thou art my hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to look at this here. And you know, the kids kind of made a comment this morning that, you know, never no matter who's preaching on Sunday, the service is always kind of lean kind of tend to go long. So, we're just going to try to follow the Lord's leadership today. And I'm not going to cut it short just to cut it short because I'm short, but we're going to we're going to follow the leadership of the Lord this morning and just trust by God's grace he'll speak to us. Here we find here in Psalms 32 and verse one. We're going to read the entire chapter of Psalms 32 and just trust we'll hear from the Lord this morning. It says, "Blessed is he whose transgressions is forgiven and whose sins is covered." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputed not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no gal. &gt;&gt; When I kept silence, my bones waxed. cold through my roaring all the day long. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me. My moisture is turned into draw of summer. I acknowledged my sin unto thee. My iniquity have not I hid. I said, I will confess my transgression unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Sah, for this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found. Surely in the floods of great waters they shall not over they shall not come nigh unto him. Verse seven, for thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Say I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go. And I will guide thee with my eye. Be you not as a horse or as a mule which has no understanding, whose mouth be held with a bit and a and a bridal, lest they come near unto thee. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked. But he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous, and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. We just want to make everyone welcome. I believe we have a a visitor here with us this morning. I want to make you welcome. May God bless you today in the presence of the Lord. But we want to look here. As I said, we're going to kind of take this thought for a little while this morning on thou art my hiding place. And David, as we find David was a man that was well acquainted with difficulties. We look here in verse four and the Bible tells us for day and night that the Lord's hand was heavy upon David. And that word heavy there means affliction. So David knew what it he knew what it felt like, brother Johnny, to go through difficulties and afflictions of life. And he was a man that was well acquainted with hiding, whether he was hiding from Saul, whether he was hiding from the Philistines, or whether he was hiding from his own son Abselon. And we find in the scriptures in 1st Samuel 18 and vers 11. You don't have to turn there, but here we find him hiding from Saul's spear. And then we go into 1st Samuel 9 and 18. He's hiding at Naoth and Rama when they were sent to capture him. When Saul sent men to capture him, then he was hiding with Jonathan. They're in the field there. And then at N with the priest in Gath among the Philistines where he pretended madness before Akish. He hid in the cave of Adullum. He hid in the wilderness in the strongholds of Judah. He hid in the cave of Engeti. He hid in the wilderness of Zip. He hid with the Philistines and Ziglag. And he ran and he fled to Jerusalem when Abselon was rebelling against him. So David knew what it felt like to be on the run. He knew WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO TO TO HIDE AND TO BE IN FEAR OF HIS LIFE. BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND AND I WANT YOU TO NOTICE when we look here IN EVERYWHERE DAVID FOUND HIMSELF. NO MATTER WHAT THE PERSECUTIONS WERE, NO MATTER WHAT THE DIFFICULTIES WERE OF his his life, HE WHETHER HE WAS HIDING IN THE STRONGHOLDS of Judah or the plains of Engeti or you know no matter where it was, DAVID NEVER GAVE CREDIT TO THOSE PLACES FOR HIS PROTECTION. BUT DAVID COMPLETELY GAVE ALL THE HONOR AND ALL THE GLORY. HE SAID THAT THOU ART MY HIDING PLACE. SO NO MATTER WHERE DAVID FOUND HIMSELF, NO MATTER WHAT TIME AND SEASONS OF LIFE HE WALKED THROUGH, DAVID DIDN'T GIVE CREDIT TO, YOU KNOW, HIS OWN HUMAN ABILITIES TO OUTSMART THIS ONE AND OUTRUN THAT ONE, BUT HE GAVE ALL CREDIT TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AND DAVID KNEW THAT AS LONG AS GOD WAS HIS PROTECTION, AS LONG AS GOD WAS HIS HIDING PLACE, THEN HE COULD BE AT REST. NO MATTER WHAT THE DIFFICULTIES OF LIFE THAT HE ENDURED, HE WOULD BE AT REST. AND HE would have peace. &gt;&gt; AND I BELIEVE THAT'S A LESSON FOR ALL OF US THIS MORNING BECAUSE WE LIKE DAVID HAVE VERY VARYING TRIALS AND DIFFICULTIES THAT WE GO THROUGH. WE GO THROUGH SEASONS of life. &gt;&gt; Some of us there's springtimes. &gt;&gt; Then there's summers where the heat of persecution is on. THEN THERE'S A FALL WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING JUST DIES OUT AND YOU DON'T FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. YOU DON'T FEEL THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THEN YOU DRIFT OFF INTO A WINTER WHERE EVERYTHING'S COLD. But there's a springtime. &gt;&gt; There's a springtime COMING FOR ALL OF US as believers. AND AND WE FIND BUT DAVID SAYS THAT THE LORD IS MY HIDING PLACE. THOU ART MY HIDING PLACE. AND THIS WORD HIDING PLACE MEANS A A SECRET PLACE. IT'S A A SHELTER. IT'S A PLACE OF PROTECTION. &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE ALSO SAYS NOW, "THOU SHALT PRESERVE ME from trouble." You know, many times we think when we give our heart to the Lord, brother L. I remember when I first became a Christian, I'm thinking, man, I'm going to I'm going to walk with the Lord. I did this and I gave my heart to God and you know, bless God, I got something to do. I'm turning away from my wicked WAYS AND I'M THINKING, MAN, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE GREAT. I'M GOING IT'S GOING TO BE A FLOWERY BETTER EASE. BOY, was I disappointed. &gt;&gt; I WAS SHOCKED BEYOND BELIEF. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MESSAGE. I didn't know ANYTHING ABOUT A PROPHET. I WAS JUST WALKING AMONGST DENOMINATIONAL BELIEVERS AND I BELIEVE God had that for me for a season AND TIME. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WAS DUMBFOUNDED WHEN I REALIZED THAT NOW I THOUGHT I HAD HARD TIMES. NOW I REALLY HAD HARD TIMES &gt;&gt; CUZ NOW I'M TRYING TO SERVE GOD. NOW I'M CONVICTED OVER EVERYTHING I DO. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; BUT WE FINALLY THE LORD SAYS DAVID SAYING TO THE LORD, "THOU SHALT PRESERVE ME. &gt;&gt; THOU SHALT PRESERVE ME FROM TROUBLE." NOTICE, NOT FROM HAVING TROUBLE, BUT FROM BEING SWALLOWED UP IN TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; NO, WE ALL HAVE TROUBLE. BUT GOD SAYS, "I WILL BE A [screaming] REFUGE. I WILL BE A HIDING PLACE. I WILL BE A STRONG TOWER. I WILL BE THAT DEFENSE CITY FOR YOU. WHEN YOU HAVE ME, YOU HAVE IT ALL." &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; The Bible will tell us in PSALMS 34:19 THAT MANY ARE THE afflictions &gt;&gt; of the righteous. Now, how many of you've been afflicted? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. I want to show our hands. &gt;&gt; Oh, a little bit better than that, Shanica. [laughter] &gt;&gt; There we go. Yeah, leave it up there. &gt;&gt; BUT MANY ARE THE AFFLICTIONS [snorts] OF THE RIGHTEOUS. AND THAT WORD AFFLICTIONS MEANS BAD, &gt;&gt; DISAGREEABLE, MALIGNANT, CANCEROUS, UNPLEASANT, GIVING OF PAIN, UNHAPPINESS, MISERY, DISPLEASING. MANY ARE THE AFFLICTIONS OF THE RIGHTEOUS, BUT &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. BUT THE LORD, &gt;&gt; THE LORD DELIVERTH THEM OUT OF THEM ALL. THERE'S NOT ONE AFFLICTION. THERE'S NOT ONE TRIAL THAT YOU GO THROUGH. BUT WHAT THE LORD DOESN'T REACH DOWN HIS HAND AND LIFT YOU OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; CAN I TELL YOU THERE'S A NEW DAY COMING? CAN I TELL YOU THAT SORROW ONLY LASTS FOR A MOMENT, BUT JOY COMETH IN THE MORNING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD'S MIGHTY HAND REACHES DOWN AND LIFTS YOU UP OUT OF AFFLICTION, BRINGS YOU THROUGH THAT TRIAL, BRINGS YOU THROUGH THAT TRIBULATION. &gt;&gt; We don't find in the scriptures that the believer is overtaken by his afflictions. &gt;&gt; But the righteous have a promise. &gt;&gt; And that's what David could rely on. You know, David without the Holy Ghost could completely, solely, fully rely on God &gt;&gt; and say, "God, no matter where I find myself, no matter what season of life I'm in, no matter if it's sickness, if it's sorrow, IF MY CHILDREN ARE WAVERING, NO MATTER WHAT, &gt;&gt; thou art my hiding place." &gt;&gt; See, AND WE AS CHRISTIANS, WE HAVE good days &gt;&gt; and we have bad days. There's times we're on a mountaintop. &gt;&gt; Boy, we love the mountain tops, don't we? &gt;&gt; But then there's times we're in a valley of decision. &gt;&gt; But you know, it's in the valley is where the Christian begins to blossom and bloom and bud out. &gt;&gt; It's in the valley where the things that God placed inside of you begin to come forth. But we enjoy those mountain tops. And you know, maybe we take for granted the valleys. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We take for granted, you know, when things become to be developed. And we're going to kind of look at this. And I I'm not going to focus the entire service on valleys and trials and afflictions. We're going to turn a corner here, but just stay with me for a little bit this morning. BUT WE FIND HERE WE'RE NOT IMMUNE from adversities. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT IMMUNE FROM TRIALS AND HARDSHIPS OF THIS LIFE. BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND OUR SAFETY DOES NOT RELY ON OUR HUMAN ABILITIES. You know, IT SEEMS LIKE MANY TIMES WHEN THINGS AREN'T GOING OUR WAY, WE WANT TO HIJACK THE PEN FROM GOD, AS WE HEARD A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND WE WANT TO START WRITING OUR OWN STORY. &gt;&gt; OH, CHURCH, LEAVE THE PEN IN THE ARTHUR'S HAND. &gt;&gt; He knows the END FROM THE BEGINNING. HE KNOWS WHERE TO TAKE YOU. HE KNOWS HOW TO BRING THINGS IN TO YOU TO COME THROUGH TO DEVELOP YOU CUZ HE HAS IN MIND EXACTLY WHAT each of us here today will BE LIKE. BUT WE FIND OUR SAFETY DOESN'T REST IN PSYCHOLOGY. IT DOESN'T REST IN OUR OWN HUMAN ABILITIES. IT DOESN'T REST IN HOW INTELLIGENT WE ARE. IT DOESN'T REST IN ANY MAN-MADE SYSTEMS OR TRADITIONS. OUR SAFETY AND OUR PROTECTION RESTS SOLELY in the unfailing word of God. &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS TO BE this has to be your hiding place. WHEN THINGS AREN'T GOING YOUR WAY, YOU come back to this word. Yes. &gt;&gt; You come back and you find the promise that lays in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Brother would tell us now, they that overcome shall inherit all things. They that overcome. &gt;&gt; He goes, YOU HAVE POWER TO DO IT, BUT YOU MUST BE WILLING TO LAY IT DOWN. YOU SEE, GOD COULD NOT PUSH YOU THROUGH A LITTLE PIPE. PULL US OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN SAY, "OH, BLESSED IS HE THAT OVERCOMETH." HE SAYS, "YOU HAD NOTHING TO OVERCOME. HE JUST PUSHED YOU THROUGH. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION FOR YOURSELF AND I GOT TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR MYSELF. AND IN DOING THAT, WE SHOW OUR FAITH AND OUR RESPECTS to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand Satan Satan is only limited to what he can do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You realize that he could not drown Noah in the flood until God's purpose for Noah's life was finished. &gt;&gt; He could not burn up the Hebrew children until the purpose of God had been finished. He could not kill Job WITH BALLS AND THE TROUBLES THAT HE WENT THROUGH until God's purpose for his life HAD BEEN FINISHED. HE COULD NOT TAKE DANIEL and throw him in a den of lions and and HAVE THE LIONS TO DESTROY HIS LIFE UNTIL GOD'S PURPOSE FOR DANIEL HAS BEEN FINISHED. Neither could he TAKE UH TO ABRAHAM DIE OF OLD AGE UNTIL THAT PROMISED SON, THE PURPOSE THAT GOD HAD FOR ABRAHAM HAD BEEN FINISHED. AND BROTHER B WILL TELL US AND NEITHER CAN IT TAKE YOU &gt;&gt; NOR CAN IT TAKE ME UNTIL THE PURPOSE OF GOD OUR LIFE IS FINISHED. SO WE GATHER FROM THERE A CONSOLATION. OTHERWISE THIS WORD IS OUR HIDING PLACE. NO MATTER WHAT BEFALLS US NO MATTER WHAT WE GO THROUGH NO MATTER WHAT SEASON OF LIFE. AS LONG AS WE HAVE HIM AS A HIDING PLACE, THERE'S NOTHING THAT THE DEVIL CAN DO THAT CAN DESTROY YOU UNTIL GOD'S PURPOSE FOR YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN FINISHED. &gt;&gt; What a peace we can have. &gt;&gt; What a comfort we can have. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean it's going to be easy. &gt;&gt; But we can find peace. &gt;&gt; You know, THERE'S A SAYING, HARD TIMES create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men and weak men create hard times. &gt;&gt; See, it suggests that hardships build character and strength. And a lot of times when everything is going smooth, life is great, we don't recognize God the way we should. &gt;&gt; We don't pray the way we should. We don't read our Bibles the way we should. We don't listen to sermons the way we should. We don't feed the way we should. Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN WE'RE PROSPERING FINANCIALLY AND THE KIDS ARE HEALTHY AND THERE'S NO TROUBLES, WE'RE enjoying great times, that's when it creates soft Christians. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Oh, everything's smooth. Everything's great at the Adams house. &gt;&gt; Man, everybody looking in from the outside. Armchair quarterback. I WISH I WAS IN ADAMS. OH, but you don't understand what goes on in the Adam's home. &gt;&gt; Nor do we understand what goes on in your home. &gt;&gt; The things that you're going through. &gt;&gt; OH, IT APPEARS that everything's great and everything is great. All right, WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT CLAIMER DISCLAIMER OUT THERE. EVERYTHING'S GREAT. But notice notice when things are great, we don't really consecrate our lives the way we should. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You know, we leave we leave it all for the preachers. &gt;&gt; We leave it all for the deacons and all for the church officials or for mom and dad or for, you know, others in the church to pull the load to say amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WE FIND WHEN WE'RE FACING DIFFICULTIES IN THE HOME, we're struggling in this life and we seem TO FALLEN ON FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS, WE BEGIN TO PRAY MORE. &gt;&gt; WE BEGIN TO SEEK GOD MORE. WE BEGIN TO LISTEN MORE CUZ WHY? WE'RE LISTENING FOR THAT STILL SMALL VOICE TO BRING US THROUGH THAT TRIAL. SO YOU FIND THE DIFFICULTIES IN LIFE, THE HARDSHIPS THAT WE GO THROUGH BUILD STRONG CHRISTIANS. That's right. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever wonder why does troubles come? &gt;&gt; WHY DOES TROUBLES COME? BROTHER M SAYS GOD HARNESSES TROUBLE, PUTS BITS IN ITS mouth and makes it obey him. AND THOSE TROUBLES, HEAR THIS NOW. THOSE TROUBLES BRING YOU into a closer fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Some of you been wondering, why am I in this valley? Why am I in this trial? God's just trying to draw close to you. &gt;&gt; HE GO THERE'S, HE GOES, THERE HAD BEEN NO RAINBOW until the flood came. BUT AFTER NOAH WAS PRESSED IN THAT CONDITION THAT HE WAS IN TO FLOAT 40 DAYS AND NIGHTS IN A STORM AND A LITTLE ARC PITCHING UP AND DOWN IN THE WATER, IT WAS AFTER THE FLOOD WAS OVER THAT HE SAW THE RAINBOW FOR THE FIRST TIME. A COVENANT. &gt;&gt; SEE, A COVENANT OF HOPE, A COVENANT OF PROMISE. IT WAS AFTER HE WENT THROUGH THE TRIBULATION, THEN HE saw the promise. AND WE FIND WE ASK FOR COMFORT AND PEACE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU'VE ASKED FOR, "OH, JO LORD, JUST GIVE ME YOUR COMFORT. GIVE ME YOUR PEACE, GOD." AND GOD GIVES YOU THE BEST THAT HE CAN GIVE US. AND HE GIVES YOU TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS. HE GOES, "THAT'S WAY BETTER THAN COMFORT AND PEACE." OUR COMFORT IS JUST BEYOND the river. &gt;&gt; Oh, but when the truth is come out of, notice when they come out of Egypt there. God has a path for each of our lives. &gt;&gt; God knows where what he's doing, church. And you know, brother B will tell us in God's way that's been made for us. He said, "When the children of Israel come out of the land OF EGYPT, THEY FOLLOW GOD'S PATH. HE LED UP TO the Red Sea." &gt;&gt; You know, some of you would be like, "Uh-uh, Moses, this is wrong. You must not be anointed. &gt;&gt; You must not be called." CUZ IF YOU WAS CALLED, YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN BRING us here. &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe not all of you, &gt;&gt; but some of you find that little reason to complain and argue and backbite. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not when you say amen, brother L. [laughter] Love you, buddy. BUT NOTICE WHERE GOD'S PATH LEADS. SO GOD'S INFINITE GOD. HE KNOWS THE END FROM the beginning. He knows HOW LONG THEY WERE IN EGYPT. AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO TO TAKE THEM OUT. AND HERE HE SENDS HIM A PROPHET. NOTICE A PROPHET, A VINDICATED VOICE, AND LED THEM OUT AND BROUGHT THEM RIGHT TO THE RED SEA. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS GOD'S PATH, NOT AROUND THE SEA, NOT OVER THE SEA. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S PATH LED THROUGH THE SEA. &gt;&gt; And notice WHEN THEY CAME THROUGH THE SEA, GOD KEPT LEADING AND HE LED THEM TO BITTER WATERS, THE LANDS OF MARA. HE LED THEM THERE. SAYS, "WELL, GOD, IF GOD'S SO GREAT AND GOD'S SO WONDERFUL AND THIS CHRISTIAN LIFE IS IS SO SO ONE TO BE SOUGHT AFTER AND YOU KNOW, BEING A BELIEVER IS GREAT THING, THEN WHY ARE THERE RED SEAS? WHY ARE THERE BITTER WATERS?" BECAUSE GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; GOD'S PATH MAY LEAD YOU RIGHT TO CANCER. &gt;&gt; And maybe we find ourselves saying, "But God, I'm a child of God. I'm a believer. Why me? Why now? &gt;&gt; But if you have a hiding place, &gt;&gt; you don't think about the why me &gt;&gt; and the why now. &gt;&gt; See, just keep trusting God. &gt;&gt; Just keep following the pillar of fire. God knows how to lead. &gt;&gt; See, he's proven that not even cancer will stand before the believer's prayer. And we got several cancer survivors right here in this congregation this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, it was a red sea. It was a bitter water. But you made it. &gt;&gt; You made it. See, just remember, it's after the tribulation. It's after the trial that we see the promise. &gt;&gt; See, he has a hiding place for the believer. Brother man would tell us he says then he went right up to the wilderness into the spring of Mara the bitter water. Isn't it strange that God will lead his children through bitter waters but them all goes along the road but when he WAS THERE THE REMEDY FOR THE bitter waters was standing on the bank and Moses cut down a tree and throwed it into the bitter water and it turned sweet again. And maybe that's where you're at this morning. &gt;&gt; Maybe you've COME TO A RED Sea and you don't see any way to cross. Maybe you've come to bitter waters and you question yourself, why? Why red seas? Why all the difficulty? If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck. &gt;&gt; Man, see, things are not going as you had hoped. You're dealing with sickness, maybe an unfavorable doctor's report. You falling on hard times, struggling to stay one step ahead of your bills. But can I tell you the thing that you're needing for the bitter waters is just on the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is there waiting for somebody to take them and put them into their bitter waters &gt;&gt; for [snorts] them to turn sweet again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother tells me, he goes, "Now that's the way God leads his children GOD'S PATH. GOD'S PROVIDE a way. If the children of ISRAEL WOULD HAVE TRIED TO BYPASS AND GO AROUND down this way, they would have got IN TROUBLE. SEE, THEY HAD TO FOLLOW THE CLOUD OF PILL OF FIRE. THEY had to follow the pillar of fire that led them. THEY FOLLOWED THAT. AND IF he goes, "And if the CHURCH TONIGHT WILL ONLY FOLLOW THE PILLAR OF FIRE, THE HOLY SPIRIT, YOU'LL MAKE CANAAN as sure as anything." &gt;&gt; And that's our goal church is to MAKE CANAAN. BUT WE FIND TODAY many are following a man. &gt;&gt; They listen to a headquarters to give them marching orders, certain time to play a tape or to do this or to do that. Many are following the system of a man. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You know, they they attached theirel to a gift &gt;&gt; and they seek after signs and wonders versus seeking after the giver of the gift. &gt;&gt; See, God sent us the pillar of fire in this day to lead us to the promised land. And when Moses went off the scene, God had a Joshua prepared. &gt;&gt; And he TOLD JOSHUA, "AS I was with Moses, so shall I be with you." Just because Moses went off the scene did not mean God went off the scene. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And just because a prophet goes off the scene doesn't mean the spirit of God is off the scene. He's still here. He's still present. &gt;&gt; SO WE FIND HERE GOD HAD A JOSHUA PRAYER TO TAKE the people into the land. IT WASN'T ABOUT THE MAN, BUT IT WAS ABOUT the leading of the Holy Spirit church. AND I'M GRATEFUL AND I'LL SAY THIS. I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR FAITHFUL men who has stood FOR THE MESSAGE. MEN WHO HAVE GALLERY PROCLAIMED THE TRUTH OF THE MESSAGE. MEN THAT HAS BLAZED A TRAIL FOR US TODAY TO BE ABLE TO PREACH THE INFALLIBLE TRUTHS OF THE MESSAGE. BUT OUR SAFETY DOESN'T REST IN WHO OUR PASTOR IS. OUR SAFETY DOESN'T REST IN WHAT CHURCH WE ATTEND. OUR SAFETY REST IN THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S ANOINTED FOR THIS HOUR TO TRANSFORM A PEOPLE TO TAKE YOU OUT AND TO TAKE YOU IN TO THE LAND THAT'S BLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. &gt;&gt; SO DON'T GET YOUR EYES FOCUSED ON SOME SOME IDEA OR SOME MAN OR SOME PERSONALITY. PUT YOUR FOCUS ON THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said, "NOW LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR. LET THE HE GOES, I WANT TO LET THIS CLEARLY BE MAKE THIS KNOWN. I AM NOT THAT PERSON. I AM THE SERVANT TO THAT PERSON." &gt;&gt; You say, "Bro, why do you bring these things out? We know better." That's that's not a problem here at Even Like Tabernacle. You're exactly right. But it's a problem other places. &gt;&gt; Trust me, I go to California enough. THERE'S PROBLEMS AND WE FIND LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS. I'M A SERVANT TO THAT PERSON AND YOU ARE TOO IF YOU'RE ABRAHAM'S SEED. THEN HE GOES INTO THE THE church age and CHURCH A HE GOES I WANT TO MAKE ONE MORE COMPARISON BETWEEN A LEODYIAN prophet messenger AND JOHN THE PROPHET MESSENGER WHO PRECEDED JESUS FIRST COMING. HE SAID THE PEOPLE IN JOHN'S DAY MISTOOK HIM FOR THE MESSIAH. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THEN HE SAYS, "NOW THIS LAST DAY PROPHET MESSENGER WILL HAVE SUCH POWER BEFORE THE LORD THAT THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO MISTAKE HIM FOR THE LORD JESUS." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE A SPIRIT, LISTEN, there will BE A SPIRIT IN THE WORLD AT THE END TIME THAT WILL SEDUCE SOME AND MAKE them believe this. &gt;&gt; SO YOU WONDER HOW CAN THEY believe such nonsense? Because there's a spirit in the world. that seduces them to believe this. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham keeps going. HE SAYS, "BUT DON'T you believe it? He is not Jesus Christ. He is not the son of God. HE IS ONE of the brethren, a prophet, a messenger, a servant of God. He needs NO GREATER HONOR BESTOWED UPON HIM THAN THAT WHICH JOHN RECEIVED WHEN HE was the VOICE THAT CRIED, "I AM NOT HE, BUT he is coming after me." Amen. &gt;&gt; AND FOR MANY, BROTHER BRANDHAM HAS become their absolute. &gt;&gt; He and he alone is their place of safety. He is their hiding place. &gt;&gt; Many believe that if YOU BELIEVE GOD SENT A PROPHET AND YOU got the Holy Ghost, you're going to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; Others are baptizing IN HIS NAME, PRAYING his name, even some to believe him to be Christ Branom. &gt;&gt; But notice he said there would be a spirit in the land. So can I tell you church this morning that William Brandham is not our hiding place and I mean that with all reverence and respect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The name William Brandom, the man William Brandom, the person William Brandham is not our hiding place. &gt;&gt; But our hiding place is in the one he pointed us to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; SEE, BROTHER BRANDHAM NEVER POINTED TO HIMSELF. RATHER, HE ALWAYS POINTED the believer to Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not the person. I'm only the servant of that person. &gt;&gt; And that should make us each and everyone here today and on the live stream. That should make us thankful for a balanced ministry. &gt;&gt; One that can rightly divide the word. one that can rightly place the messenger and his message &gt;&gt; and you &gt;&gt; can rightly place us where we need to be. &gt;&gt; BUT MANY TIMES WHEN WE'RE GOING through difficulties, we think that our burdens, nobody else, oh my, nobody else has my burdens, man. Man, if everybody knew what I was going through, everybody be they'd be throwing palm trees down, palm branches. Here he comes. Man, I can't believe he's here. Look what he's been through. AND THAT'S HOW WE FEEL SOMETIMES. THAT'S HOW THE DEVIL WILL ROB YOU OF VICTORY TO MAKE YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; NOTICE I HE GOES, "BROTHER MAN SAYS, I MIGHT INJECT THIS HERE. WE THINK OUR BURDENS ARE SO HEAVY SOMETIMES THAT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE it in the world." &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW THAT ALL THESE things are good for you? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. None of us like to hear that, do we? &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me that's good? God must have a sick sense of humor. &gt;&gt; BUT LISTEN, THEY ALL ARE TO MOLD YOU AND TO MAKE YOU. &gt;&gt; And some of US ARE JUST SLOW LEARNERS. &gt;&gt; We just keep going and going and going and going through the trial and seem like we we get a little we're out of it and all of a sudden we're right BACK IN IT. LOOK, WISE UP, PASS THE TEST. YEAH, &gt;&gt; I remember when I first came to the message and they told me, you know, I heard brother Bam say, "You're going to keep going through that until you pass the test." I'm like, "Man, I am a miserable wretch. I am failing this test over and over and over." And I got rebuked after rebuke after rebuke after rebuke after rebuke. BUT EVENTUALLY, YOU WISE UP, BROTHER DEREK, AND YOU LEARN TO PASS THE TEST. YOU LEARN TO TRUST GOD. YOU LEARN TO DIE OUT TO SELF AND SELF-WILL AND FOLLOW THE LORD AND HIS LEADING. BUT WE FIND GOD BRINGS YOU THROUGH THESE THINGS TO MOLD YOU AND TO MAKE YOU. AND HE SAYS PROPHETS AND SAGES, THEY WERE MOLDED ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE DESERT IN THE HOT BLAZING SUN THROUGH TRIBULATIONS AND TRIALS AND PERSECUTIONS. &gt;&gt; AND THESE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TODAY, THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENED TO US THAT HASN'T happened to OTHER CHRISTIANS. &gt;&gt; WHEN'S THE LAST TIME SOME OF YOU WERE THROWN INTO A DEN OF LINES? &gt;&gt; WHEN'S THE LAST TIME SOME OF YOU WERE PUT IN A COLISEUM? OH, BUT IT'S HAPPENED TO YOUR BROTHERS. IT'S HAPPENED TO YOUR SISTERS. AND YOU THINK, "OH, I'VE JUST I'M FINANCIALLY UNFIT. MY WORLD'S FALLING APART. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A TOMORROW." That's how the devil makes us feel. &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER BAM SAYS HE KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES to mold you. &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO MOLD YOU. Some of it sickness for some of us. Some of us financial, some of us are children, some of us it's just life in general. &gt;&gt; BUT SEE, GOD KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO MOLD YOU. HE KNOWS WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL THAT HE'S GOING TO USE. &gt;&gt; SEE, the backside of the desert sometimes is WHERE GOD MOLDS RIGHTEOUS MEN AND THE SAGES AND PROPHETS. THAT'S WHERE MEN ARE BEAT OUT. MEN ARE BEAT OUT IN THE WORD &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY GOT ALL KIND OF CREED AND STUFF IN THEM. LET THEM come to the word and God beats it right UP AND MOLDS IT RIGHT THIS RIGHT INTO THIS. IT'S A GREAT SYMPHONY. Listen how a prophet begins to use the word here. IT'S A GREAT SYMPHONY WITH of his word. &gt;&gt; See a symphony as we all know is a large scale musical composition typically of an orchestra and it's divided in to several movements. It term the term symphony here originated from the Greek word here and it means to sound together. SO, THERE'S SEVERAL of us here this morning, and maybe this group has the high hats, the symbols, and this group has the lows, and this group has something else, cuz I'm not a orchestra guy, and this GROUP HAS SOMETHING ELSE. BUT WE'RE ALL MUST [screaming] SOUND TOGETHER TO HAVE CHURCH, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THEN WE RECOGNIZE IN A A SYMPHONY, THERE'S TIMES IN THE THE THE TELLING OF THE STORY BECAUSE THE CONDUCTOR TELLS THE STORY THROUGH SONG. THEN THERE'S DRAMA. The low base is hitting and everybody's on the edge of their seat. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Then there's THE HIGH EVERYTHING GETS HIGH PITCHED EXCITEMENT AND ZEAL AND EVERYTHING. THEN THERE'S OTHER THINGS ARE BEING PLAYED OUT. SEE, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT GOD KNOWS HOW TO CHANGE JUST THE RHYTHM OF THE MUSIC. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, THERE'S TIMES IN OUR LIFE THAT WE HAVE DRAMATIC SEASONS AND THE MUSIC CHANGES BECAUSE MAYBE WE'RE GOING ONE WAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE GOING. SO GOD ALLOWS [screaming] THE BASE TO TREMBLE AND THE THINGS TO GET ROUGH AND THE LIFE TO GET HARD AND DIFFICULT. WHY? BUT CHANGE THE RHYTHM OF THE MUSIC TO BRING YOU IN SYNC WITH THE ORCHESTRA AGAIN. &gt;&gt; God knows how to change the rhythm. &gt;&gt; He's the conductor of our lives. Maybe you're, "Oh, well, I'm going to do it my way. &gt;&gt; You and Frank Sinatra don't agree together. [panting] We're going to do it my way." God knows how to pull the rug out from underneath you, Frank. &gt;&gt; And so, you'll do it his way. &gt;&gt; And you realize the rhythm of the music changes. But it all must be played together. &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why we come to a service &gt;&gt; because some of us are in those low times &gt;&gt; and some of you are in those high times. &gt;&gt; And it takes those that are in those high times to help bring those in that low time back up &gt;&gt; to realize WE'VE BEEN THERE. WE'VE COME THROUGH THE LOW TIMES. NOW WE'RE ON THE HIGH SOUNDS OF THE RHYTHM of the conductor. &gt;&gt; If we made it, you can make it, too. &gt;&gt; BUT I LIKE HOW THE PROPHET WOULD BEGIN TO USE THAT. HE KNOWS WHEN THE RHYTHM OF IT HAS to change. &gt;&gt; See, it's his story. &gt;&gt; He's only telling it through your lives. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He will allow sickness to come &gt;&gt; to get you back in sync. &gt;&gt; He will allow financial hardships to come to get you back in sync. &gt;&gt; He will allow your kids to go astray &gt;&gt; to bring you back in sync. &gt;&gt; He knows the rhythm of the music. Only thing he asks of us &gt;&gt; is when he's when you need to respond. Maybe it's only for one second. &gt;&gt; Maybe you only have one moment in the entire program, but when it comes your moment, make sure you're ready. &gt;&gt; Make sure that you're ready. &gt;&gt; He says, "Many are the afflictions of THE RIGHTEOUS, BUT GOD DELIVERTH HIM OUT OF THEM ALL. GOD HAS moved through history with the rhythm of the promise of his word in each age in the same rhythm making his word. He says that's how God moved down THROUGH HISTORY FROM ALL THE WAY FROM GENESIS TO REVELATION. He moved through HISTORY WITH THE WORD. THAT'S RIGHT. THE RHYTHM OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT vindicating his word to the elect. &gt;&gt; Remember, he's never been able to touch the outside church. It's only the elected. &gt;&gt; Only the elected. And you look at some people and you ask, "How in the world are they gonna make it?" &gt;&gt; Don't act like you ain't never thought that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How in the world is they going to make it, &gt;&gt; man? Look what they have done. They have destroyed that family. They have ruined their testimony. How in the world? But God knows. &gt;&gt; God knows. He's the one standing behind here. &gt;&gt; He knows &gt;&gt; how to bring it out. &gt;&gt; There's those that are here this morning. &gt;&gt; Many of us would have gave up on a long time. Actually, some of us probably did give up, &gt;&gt; but you're here &gt;&gt; because God is still conducting &gt;&gt; the music. God is still can. He's trying to show you you have a hiding place. It's not out there in the world. It's not out there in systems of man. &gt;&gt; But notice, I love how brother Rama said it wasn't until the Hebrew children were forced to go into the fiery furnace. One of their most outstanding trials that the son of man appeared on the scene. &gt;&gt; Well, do you want the son of man? &gt;&gt; Then you got to welcome the trial. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's no son of man without the trial. &gt;&gt; Then he goes in, he says, notice, he says, Daniel, he had purpose in his HEART THAT HE WOULD NOT DEFILE HIMSELF WITH THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. AND HE was forced TO A TRIAL. NOTICE, HE KNEW THAT THE LAW WAS levied against him. He didn't run to Virginia. He didn't find another pastor to sit under. No, he just simply went home, brother Derek, and he bowed on his knees and he prayed three times a day as was his custom. &gt;&gt; He continued they uh Daniel had a hiding place, a refuge. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He didn't care what they did. He knew what the consequences of that trial was. BUT WE FIND when he was thrown into the trial that the angel of the Lord came in and stood between him and the lions. SO IT WAS AFTER THE TEST. IT'S AFTER THE TRIAL DOES THE ANGEL OF THE Lord appear. THEN WE GO INTO ABRAHAM AND WE know the story of Abraham. He was on the back side of the desert. He gave Lot the CHOICE OF THE BEST LAND. AND HERE Abraham is he's he's been holding on to a promise for years. HE'S OUT THERE ON THE BEARING GROUND. Drought has come and know what? He's got a nagging wife over here and nothing seems to be going his way. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Everything seems to be falling apart. But Abraham kept believing. BUT NOTICE IT WAS AFTER THE TRIAL WAS OVER THAT HE SPOKE FACE TO FACE WITH ELOHIM. &gt;&gt; He didn't speak TO SOME LITTLE ANGEL. HE DIDN'T SPEAK TO SOMEBODY ELSE. HE WASN'T JUST SPEAKING TO SOME MAN. HE SPOKE HE SPOKE FACE TO FACE WITH ELOHIM. SEE, IT WAS AFTER THE TRIAL. IT WAS AFTER HE ENDURED, AFTER HE WENT THROUGH THE TROUBLES, AFTER THE DROUGHT, AFTER THE BEARING LAND, AFTER ALL THIS DID HE FINALLY SEE GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And we find there's a pattern. Don't look at your trial. Don't focus on your tribulation, but look for the promise after the trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. Look for the one that's supposed to appear after the tribulation. See, look for the promise that's just beyond the valley. See, it's after the trial, after you overcome that the Lord draws nigh and he becomes that fourth man in the furnace. It's after the test that the angel of the Lord appears. It's after the test that you can talk face to face with Elohim. It was after the battle that Melzdc appeared to Abraham &gt;&gt; after after after. But each in these situations, those three Hebrew boys, they had a hiding place. Without the Holy Ghost, they had an experience. Daniel had a hiding place. Without the Holy Ghost, he had an experience. Abraham listening to a voice and yet he held on for 25 years. &gt;&gt; But I love how David would tell us here, "Thou art my hiding place." And this gives illusion to the cities of refuge that we find in numbers 35 and:9 says the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you come over Jordan into this land of Canaan then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you that the slayer may flee thither which kleth any person's unawares and they notice and they shall be unto you cities of refuge from the avenger that the man's slayer die not until the till stand before the congregation in judgment. So in THE OLD TESTAMENT WHEN A MAN HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG NOW IT WAS TOOTH FOR TOOTH AND EYE FOR EYE BUT WE FIND IF HE' DONE SOMETHING WRONG AND AND HE didn't mean to do it he murdered a man IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE HAD A PLACE OF ESCAPE HE HAD A A REFUGE A CITY THAT HE COULD RUN TO AND AS LONG AS HE GOT THERE BEFORE THE PERSECUTORS OR THE PURSUERS GOT TO HIM HE WAS PROTECTED AND THE PERS THE THE PURSUERS COULDN'T COME INTO that city &gt;&gt; and brother B would tell us like this he says NOW BUT IF HE GOT THERE. AND IF HE DID THE CRIME NOT WILLINGLY, HE COULD PLEAD HIS CASE AND SHOW THAT HE WAS SORRY THAT HE DID IT, HE COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE CITY OF REFUGE AND THE pursuers could not enter into that city. He was safe. What a feeling it must have been to know that you did something that was wrong. &gt;&gt; To know that you did something that was wrong. But there was a place where you could that you could go and have no worry no more. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Go into that place and are safe. And if a man willingly did it, then he couldn't come in. But see, he goes, I like to give it a type. If a man had done wrong and he he really wants he HE WAS REALLY SORRY FOR THAT HE SINNED AND THERE WAS A PLACE OF REFUGE. And he goes, "AND IF HE JUST DON'T CARE, then there's no place for him &gt;&gt; cuz he won't accept it. He's done mean. He wanted to and no chance for him. That's the same as it is today. But if HE HAD DONE WRONG, he must want a place of refuge. &gt;&gt; He must want a place of refuge. &gt;&gt; He must recognize he needs a place of safety. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram says that's a very good type of the church and the people. A man has got to want a place of refuge. &gt;&gt; You got to feel your need of it. But if you think you want to fight your own battles, &gt;&gt; oh, come on now. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna do it my way. &gt;&gt; I'm my own person. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll do it my way. But if YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLES, LISTEN WHAT HE SAYS NOW. YOU WANT TO FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLES, HE GOES, GO AHEAD, BUT YOU'LL surely be caught by the pursuers. &gt;&gt; But someday it's going to find you. But if you want a place, HE SAID, "THEN WHEN A MAN WANTS A PLACE AND HE FOUND A PLACE, HE MUST BE WILLING TO STAY THERE. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GO OUT NO MORE. YOU STAY THERE. YOU'RE SAFE WHILE YOU'RE THERE." HE GOES, "OH, WHAT A RELIEF IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO FIND THAT PLACE. AS SOON AS YOU ENTER INTO THE GATES, THE GATES CLOSE BEHIND YOU AND YOU'LL BE SATISFIED." HE MUST WANT TO STAY THERE. NO COMPLAINING. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Well, if I was the pastor, &gt;&gt; I would do it this way. If I was this and if I was a deacon, I'll tell you what I would do. I would do. But you ain't the deacon and know are you the pastor. &gt;&gt; He start complaining and complaining and complaining. Well, if I was if I WAS OVER THE SOUND, I take that big old bass out of here cuz that thing just makes me go crazy. &gt;&gt; I would turn the music down. I'd do this and I do this and I I I [laughter] I &gt;&gt; Oh, ARE YOU IN A PLACE OF SAFETY? Come on. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT PLACE, THERE'S NO COMPLAINING. &gt;&gt; Got to be careful here, right? Cuz we all have feelings. &gt;&gt; And I don't mean to be stepping on anybody's toes and their feelings. &gt;&gt; But look what we got. &gt;&gt; Look what we have. &gt;&gt; Go to some of the places I go. &gt;&gt; God bless them. They doing everything they can to provide an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And we have A WONDERFUL PRESENCE, A WONDERFUL BUILDING, GREAT INSTRUMENTS, AND GREAT MUSICIANS AND GREAT PEOPLE TO WORK THESE MUSICIANS. AND SOME OF US CAN FIND NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT COMPLAIN. &gt;&gt; You are in a city under a wonderful ministry. Well, the presence of God flows service after service. &gt;&gt; But you must recognize you want to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying even like tabernacles you're hiding place. So, let me go ahead and clear the air on that. &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to bring a tight to you. &gt;&gt; You should be thankful, grateful, appreciative &gt;&gt; for the facility that we have, the ministry that we have. Not just ministry of preaching, BUT THE MINISTRY OF SONGS AND singers and musicians and everything. THE MINISTRY OF YOURSELF BEING THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful group of people that we get to fellowship with and rub shoulders with and encourage one another day in and day out. &gt;&gt; BUT NO COMPLAINING. WALK AROUND SAY, "WHY? Why did I ever come here? I cannot believe it. I moved all the way from so and so and so and so why did I do it? I got to do this and they want me TO DO THIS AND WE NEVER DID THIS in my other church &gt;&gt; tight this morning. Loosen up. &gt;&gt; WE NEVER HAD TO DO THIS. I'VE BEEN IN THE MESSAGE 50 YEARS. &gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T DO IT LIKE THAT when I was young. Well, I mean, come on. The ministry's evolved. &gt;&gt; The ministry's grown. &gt;&gt; The ministry's changed. &gt;&gt; So, you're telling me you didn't change? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You telling me you didn't evolve? &gt;&gt; Telling me YOU DIDN'T GROW. &gt;&gt; OH, I GOT TO GO. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS PASS THAT PLATE. I MEAN, MAN, THEY PASS THAT PLATE AND PASS THAT PLATE and they'll sit there and stare at you. &gt;&gt; Just for the record, we had Vinmo today. &gt;&gt; So, y'all don't be casting judgment on those people ain't putting nothing in the plate. There's Vinmo, there's Zel, there's Cash App. He gets his ties. Don't be looking and judging people. I just want to clear the air on that one. BUT WE COMPLAIN. LOOK CHURCH, WE HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. GOD HAS PROVIDED everything we have need of. &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE IN ALL OF LOUISIANA. &gt;&gt; LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH IN THIS STATE. IT'S AN UGLY STATE. IT'S A WRETCHED STATE. BUT WE GOT THE WORD. WE GOT A MINISTRY. WE GOT A PEOPLE. WE GOT A HIDING PLACE. [applause] OH, I'M TELLING YOU, WE SHOULD BE THE MOST HAPPY PEOPLE. THERE'S NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "Oh," he goes, "When I when I came into that hiding place, it's like heaven to me." &gt;&gt; Just remember, how about you reflect back? It do us good if you can think back that far. Some of you reflect back on it when you surrendered your life to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the reality of Jesus Christ became more than just a name on a Bible or a book &gt;&gt; or name that was in print or a story that you heard growing up in Sunday school, but it became a life. &gt;&gt; I can tell you I never never never forget about the night I gave my heart to the Lord. the greatest moment of my life. I've been through some hard times just like some of you. But you know, it's during those hard times you have to learn to worship God anyway. &gt;&gt; It's during those hard times. It's not easy. Go ahead. I'm going to go ahead and say it's not easy to worship when you're in a trial. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, the rewards &gt;&gt; for worshiping during a trial are outstanding. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul and Silas in a trial, thrown into a prison. All they were doing was preaching the message, preaching the gospel, DECLARING YOURSELF. BUT THEY didn't get behind there, BROTHER SAY, "OH, WHY? WHY ME, GOD? WHY'D YOU THROW ME IN PRISON? WHAT IS EVERYBODY GOING TO THINK ABOUT ME?" NO, THEY JUST BEGIN TO WORSHIP THE LORD IN THEIR TRIAL. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENED? THEIR WORSHIP CREATED AN EARTHQUAKE BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO RESOUND IN HEAVEN. AND GOD SHOOK THE PRISON CELL AND CAUSED EVERYONE TO WALK OUT AND BE FREE. LET ME TELL YOU, IF YOU CAN WORSHIP GOD TODAY IN THIS SERVICE, IN YOUR TRIAL, THROUGH YOUR TRIBULATION, ALL HELL WILL BE SHOOK TODAY. [applause] I SAY, HOUSE OF HELL, GIVE WAY TO THE NAME OF JESUS. GOD HAS GOT WORSHIPPERS HERE. [cheering] THEY'RE WORSHIPING THROUGH THEIR TRIAL. THEY HAVE A HIDING PLACE, AND IT'S THE NAME OF THE LORD. HE'S A place of safety, a place of rest. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "I'm inside of a tower and I have no desires to even look out." &gt;&gt; When I gave my heart to God, and I know I tell this, but you know what? It's my story. &gt;&gt; I can't tell your story. &gt;&gt; I can tell mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; I may be able to give a testimony of your story, but I [sighs and gasps] know mine. &gt;&gt; I've never in 26 years of serving God in this message has never had a desire to go back to a bottle. &gt;&gt; Never had a desire to go back to a party. &gt;&gt; Never had a desire to go back to a bar. &gt;&gt; Never. Never. Never. Why? Cuz I found a hiding place. &gt;&gt; I'm at home. I'm at rest. I don't have to seek anything else. &gt;&gt; My joys are full. &gt;&gt; We were just in Los Angeles last week and Brother Johnny, Brother Johnny Suarez asked me, he says, "Brother Joe, are you are you worried to be in California? Are you afraid to be here? You are in LA." I SAID, "BRO, THAT'S how we talk to each other." Bro, you know, it's short for brother. It's slang. Really? homie. No, I'm kidding. I said, BRO, I SAID, MY LIFE is hitting God through Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't care if this place sinks before IT GOES UNDER. I'M GOING UP. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. I GOT A HIDING PLACE. AND JESUS CHRIST IS MY HIDING PLACE. LET THE EARTHQUAKE COME. LET CALIFORNIA GO UNDER. I'M GOING [screaming] UP. WHY? BECAUSE I GOT A HIDING PLACE. I'M NOT AFRAID OF WHAT COMES. I'M NOT AFRAID OF WHAT SATAN CAN DO. I FOUND A REFUGE IN JESUS CHRIST. [applause] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE SICK THIS MORNING, it's in the tower. There's healing. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER JOE, I'M WEARY. HE SAID, "CAST ALL YOUR CARES UPON ME, FOR I careth for you." &gt;&gt; It's all in the tower. He said, "Death itself don't even worry you when you're in the Lord." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Woo. I know some of you getting old. &gt;&gt; You're worried about it. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. &gt;&gt; One step out of this land. &gt;&gt; A new body. &gt;&gt; No more gray hair, Brother Tom. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Hair. [laughter] WOO. I MUST BE ON the other side. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to be 5'6. Please God, let me be 6 foot. I've been praying for six foot since I was in sixth grade. But I've been this tall that entire time. I look like a giant, Brother Derek, to the peeweees. But all of a sudden, we got the ninth grade. Whoop! &gt;&gt; I'm looking up. &gt;&gt; But notice, your last breath here is your first breath there. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Death doesn't worry the believer &gt;&gt; because you have a hiding place. &gt;&gt; Go back to Psalms 32 and verse 7. We're going to I like how David says this. Thou art my &gt;&gt; my I know you love me. We said I pray you do but it can't be thou art brother Joe's hiding place. &gt;&gt; It can't be that you're brother Tims or brother Timothy's or brother Aaron's but thou art mine. &gt;&gt; See David here was making it personal. Thou art my hiding place and thou shalt preserve me &gt;&gt; from trouble. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. SO DAVID HERE IS PUTTING PERSONAL CLAIMS ON God &gt;&gt; and church when he becomes yours and not your parents. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When he becomes yours and not the preachers, when he becomes yours and not the churches. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. No matter what you go through in life, you can smile. It may you can b grin and bear it, but you're going to get through it. Why? Because you have a hiding place. &gt;&gt; And remember, that's a word of safety, of rest, of peace. We find here the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 7 that we have this treasure in earthn vessels &gt;&gt; that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. For we are troubled on every side yet not distressed. &gt;&gt; We are perplexed BUT NOT IN DESPAIR, PERSECUTED BUT NOT FORSAKEN, CAST DOWN BUT NOT DESTROYED. AND SO WE'RE TROUBLED, CHURCH. IT DOESN'T MEAN EVERYTHING'S GOING TO GO SMOOTH FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean that everything IS GOING TO BE GREAT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS IN THIS LIFE. BUT WHAT IT DOES MEAN, THOUGH YOU'RE TROUBLED ON EVERY SIDE, WE HAVE A PLACE OF REST. WE HAVE A SAFETY. WE'RE NOT DISTRESSED. THOUGH WE WERE PERPLEXED AND WE DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN, WE'LL NOT BE IN DESPAIR. THOUGH WE'RE PERSECUTED BY THE ENEMY, WE ARE NOT FORSAKEN BY GOD. AND THOUGH WE'VE BEEN CAST DOWN AND PUSHED ASIDE, WE ARE NOT DESTROYED. WE ARE STILL SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here. Psalms 121:7 said, "The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil, and he shall preserve thy soul." The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and ever more. at home or abroad, in the house, in the field, by the way, on the land or on the ocean, in their native COUNTRY, AND IN REMOTE LANDS, ON THE EARTH OR IN THE GRAVE. LOOK, he shall preserve you &gt;&gt; going out, coming in forever more. &gt;&gt; Then our favorite scripture, one of our favorite Psalms 27 and verse one. &gt;&gt; We're going to turn a corner and try to have you out of here. When that hand hits six, everybody's like, "Oh, good Lord, boy." Maybe sooner. &gt;&gt; Psalms 27:1, "The Lord is my light." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That word there is illumination. Joy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my joy. Some of y'all need to say that. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light. &gt;&gt; He's my joy. I know some of you going through some hard time, but the Lord &gt;&gt; is my light. &gt;&gt; He's my joy and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? &gt;&gt; The Lord is the strength. That means a place, a safety, protection, refuge, stronghold of my life. In whom shall I be afraid? &gt;&gt; Notice how David is taking this now. It's the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thou art my hiding place. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up or consume, devour, to slay my flesh, they stumbled &gt;&gt; and fell. &gt;&gt; Though a host should encamp against me." And that word host there, I had to look it up because I want to know. It's not A SINGLE NUMBER, BUT IT REPRESENTS A LARGE UNCOUNTABLE MULTITUDE. IT IT'S A TERM THAT EMPHASIZES A VAST OVERWHELMING number beyond human comprehension. &gt;&gt; SO THOUGH A HOE SHALL ENCAMP AGAINST ME, my heart shall not fear. &gt;&gt; THOUGH WAR SHALL RISE AGAINST ME, in this will I be competent. one thing, church. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you don't need to be worried about a bunch of other little bitty things, little things on this side. What kind of car you're going to drive, who you're going to marry, what kind of house you're going to live in, what kind of job you're going to have, what kind of clothes you're going to wear. But one thing have I desired of the Lord, and that will I seek after that I &gt;&gt; make it personal, &gt;&gt; that I if there's only one believer going to be in Louisiana, I'm moving to Louisiana to be that believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice what HE SAYS HERE. ONE THING I'VE DESIRED, THE LORD, THAT WILL I SEEK AFTER THAT I MAY DWELL IN IT, TO MARRY, TO ABIDE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, TO BEHOLD THE BEAUTY OF THE LORD, AND TO INQUIRE IN HIS TEMPLE. FOR IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE, &gt;&gt; OH, THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME LIKE THIS TIME. THERE'S NEVER BEEN TROUBLE LIKE THE DAY THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. BUT HE GAVE A PROMISE TO US. IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE, HE SHALL HIDE ME &gt;&gt; IN HIS PAVILION. IN THE SECRET OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE ME. And he shall set me upon a rock. &gt;&gt; So let's break into this if we can and just kind of dissect it. In the time or the period or the seasons of trouble. Trouble being bad, disagreeable, malignant, unpleasant, evil, giving up pain, unhappy, and misery. So he's telling you in those times because we all go through those seasons &gt;&gt; in those times he will hide me. &gt;&gt; He will cover me over. &gt;&gt; Notice he will hide me in his pavilion. That word pavilion means dwelling. It means chamber. It's reference to the bed chamber. This is not the kitchen. This is not the living room. But it's in the bet chamber that he's going to hide you for an intimate relationship with his spouse. HE'S GOING TO HIDE YOU IN HIS PAVILION in the secret of his tabernacle, of his secret place. Not everybody's aware of it. Not everybody's welcomed in. It's only for an elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Then he will he shall set me upon a rock." What is a rock, brother Johnny? A revelation. &gt;&gt; A revelation. &gt;&gt; And when you get the revelation of the new birth, &gt;&gt; there ain't nothing going to keep you from a rapture. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would take this scripture, this passage, and he would preach the rapture message. See, because he was trying to get to believer to realize that the new birth is not just jumping. It's not just shouting. It's not just goosebumps. It's not just screaming, but he's going to set you on a rock. And no matter what you endure in this life, as long as you have that revelation that you've been born again by the spirit of God, no matter what, there's only one thing you desire, and that's to be in his presence. &gt;&gt; See, the true revelation of Jesus Christ, not he says, notice, nothing will keep you from the rapture. What a hiding place there is. No fear when the host comes against you. No fretting when war rises against you. But one thing that you desire and that you will seek after is a hiding place. &gt;&gt; And if you're abiding in Christ and Christ is abiding in you, then there's nothing that can harm you. You are protected. You have a place of safety. And can I tell you this message is the believer's hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message. And notice he says here in the rapture message, therefore the message caused the bride together. So what a hiding place to be married to the virtuous son of God that you've never sinned in the first place. And the first place was in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; God saw you. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Saw you perfect. &gt;&gt; Saw you coming through difficulties. Saw you coming through valleys. And he says the rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride. &gt;&gt; See, if there's not a rapture, friends, then where are we? What are we going to? What age are we living in? What promise do we have? There's going to be a rapture. The Bible says that there will be and it will only be for the elected, the elected lady, the bride in this day that's poured out of the church. Now, we're going to turn a corner here and start moving this down to a where I really want to get to. See, they marched out of Egypt on the strength and the testimony of a prophet. When Israel left Egypt, they went on the testimony of Moses, &gt;&gt; a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; They were following the pillar of fire because he was sent. And God proved that he was with Moses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But they didn't enter into the land &gt;&gt; under Moses's ministry. &gt;&gt; Now, follow me. this evening says as Moses called a nation out of a nation. He said the Holy Spirit is calling a bride out of a church or church out of a church members from every denomination making up the bride. THE BRIDE COMING OUT CALLED HE SAYS THAT'S THE ONE THE BRIDE rather is the one that's going to be in the rapture. THAT ALONE NOTHING BUT THE BRIDE THE ELECTED ONES FORNOWN OF GOD FROM THE BEGINNING. THE FATHER IS SPIRITUAL GENIUS. SO IF HE'S CALLING A BRIDE OUT OF A CHURCH THEN HE HAS to take this bride somewhere. or he's TAKEN US. HE CALLS YOU OUT TO BRING YOU IN. HE CALLED ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT TO BRING THEM INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN. AND HE CALLS A BRIDE OUT OF DARK DENOMINATIONALISM TO BRING THEM INTO THE OPENING OF THE WORD. THAT IS THEIR HIDING PLACE. &gt;&gt; In Colossians 3 and:3, for you are dead and your life is hidden Christ in God. He goes, so notice now we're not called out of traditions of man to go back in traditions of man. That's right. But we're called out of denominationalism &gt;&gt; to go into the promised land for the believer, &gt;&gt; which is the opening of the word, which is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said there's three stages of the journey. Don't forget now they're following Moses's ministry. &gt;&gt; I want y'all to hold to that. &gt;&gt; They had a vindicated prophet. They left on the testimony of Moses. And there's three there's three stages of the journey. They left Egypt under justification believe in the word. They separated themselves from the Egyptians and COME OUT. THEY CROSSED THE RED SEA AND THEY KILLED THE THINGS BEHIND THEM WHICH WAS SANCTIFICATION THROUGH THE BLOOD THAT KILLS ALL HUMAN DESIRES OF EVIL. Second stage of the journey. BUT THE STIR STAGE OF THE JOURNEY IS WHEN THEY CROSSED JORDAN INTO THE PROMISED LAND WHERE THEIR INHERITANCE LAY. SEE THEIR THEIR INHERITANCE NEVER LAID IN EGYPT THOUGH GOD blessed them in Egypt. So, can I tell you this evening, don't be content with just coming out and leaving Egypt &gt;&gt; with just living a justified life and a justified state. Don't be content with just crossing the Red Sea and seeing all the task masters destroyed and living a sanctified life. There is a third stage of the journey. &gt;&gt; There is a third stage of the journey &gt;&gt; and that is a land of promise to every end time believer. And the paradox, brother Bam would tell us and now in a vision I might say this and I mention it once and I was going to cut the tape but believe that I'll leave it on here. says, "It was about 3:00 in the morning, I suppose, and I got up and I looked where in front of me and as I was coming down to Jordan, I looked down, I was standing on the map of Palestine, and I was coming down to Jordan. And it SEEMED LIKE I COULD hear the song, I'm going down to Jordan, someone was singing it. And as I drew near the river, I looked back and I seen which way I had come. AND I WAS TWOTHIRDS OF THE WAY TO JORDAN. AND I LOOKED ACROSS JORDAN AND I SAID, "OH, THE PRAISE GOD. JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE IS WHERE ALL THE PROMISES LAY. Every promise lays in the promised land." So here they come out on a vindicated voice and they stop twothirds of the journey. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And the third pull, church, is the opening of the word, &gt;&gt; the revealing of the mysteries. He says no more, there's no more higher order than to reveal the word than prophets, but the only way a prophet can be vindicated is by the word. So the third pool is not just speaking things into existence. &gt;&gt; Their third pull is the opening of the word. It's what's let me ask you what's more important speaking squirrels are to into existence or revealing the mysteries of God because it's the revelation of these seven mysterious mysteries that actually turn the heart of the believer back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; See the revealing of the word is the most important thing that a believer can have and that we as ministers can do is to reveal the word is to reveal who Christ is. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we find here in Deuteronomy 2 and verse one, then we turned and we took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me and I compassed and we compassed Mount Zir many days and the Lord spake unto me saying, "You have compassed this mountain long enough. He's taken us to a hiding place. &gt;&gt; Egypt wasn't it. The mountain wasn't it. &gt;&gt; The desert wasn't it. Red Sea wasn't it. Jordan, as great as it was, it that's not it. HE SAYS, "YOU'VE COMPASS THIS MOUNTAIN LONG ENOUGH. Turn you northward. Otherwise, turn to Canaan. Turn to the land that I promised you." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, notice Israel twothirds of their journey following Moses's message. A vindicated voice, a vindicated prophet. They come out, they cross the Red Sea, but they yet to enter into the third stage of the journey. They became content with just going to church. They were content with just believing God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; We believe the message. I'm saying these things very direct for a purpose &gt;&gt; because it's got to be more &gt;&gt; than just God sending a prophet &gt;&gt; and it's got to be more for some of you than just I believe a message &gt;&gt; church. There is a third stage of the journey &gt;&gt; that we must enter into &gt;&gt; and that is your hiding place. &gt;&gt; Going around the mountain preaching the same doctrines of repentance, preaching God sent a prophet, preaching, oh, there's a there's a message in the land, preaching all these things. And it's all it's done is just preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching. And all we've done is gone around the mountain. By this time, we should be in the promised land. &gt;&gt; We're 60 years past the dying of a prophet. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me we're only twothirds of the journey there. &gt;&gt; Some of us, some of us, that's where we are. But I'm trying to tell you, there's more to this life. There's more to this message than just William Brandom &gt;&gt; than just a prophet. &gt;&gt; Though we need a prophet. &gt;&gt; Please understand. I'm not saying we don't. Without a prophet, we don't enter into that land. Without that vindicated voice, we don't know where to go. &gt;&gt; But I'm trying to tell you, they went out on the testimony of a God sent prophet &gt;&gt; and they hung up, Brother Derek, &gt;&gt; in the wilderness &gt;&gt; going round and round. Yes. &gt;&gt; Fighting anxieties, struggling with fears, &gt;&gt; battling depression, battling church, going through one camp meeting to the next camp meeting. Highs and lows of the message. &gt;&gt; Came to Kadesh Barnea, three days journey from the promised land. Was able to look over and see, woo, man, evening light, man. Ron Spencer, oh my, Donnie Reagan, all look at that. Wayne Lawson, they got stuff going on in their churches. &gt;&gt; They were three days journey from the promised land, &gt;&gt; but the old fighters kept fighting. &gt;&gt; Oh, this this is good. And all we've done is gone around and around. We don't need the the supernatural. We don't need the signs and wonders. We got the revealed word of God. Then why aren't you in the land? &gt;&gt; That's where he's leading us is into that promised land. &gt;&gt; And once you're inside that promised land, &gt;&gt; oh my [sighs] joy unspeakable and full of glory. You know, brother Mike, they can look over and maybe they would tell the testimonies of how man it took two to bring the grapes back. My they they would tell the testimonies of you know sporadically there may be the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in a service and you know then it'd be missing for months. &gt;&gt; They can look over they were three days journey they could see &gt;&gt; but they really couldn't partake of it. Oh, it would come and it would go. It would come and it would go. It would come and it would go. But they wasn't there to abide in it. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's wanting. A people that would abide in Christ. &gt;&gt; And that Christ would abide in a people. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were three days journey and here 38 years they were on the outskirts. Just looking in looking in on the outskirts of the promised land just preaching God sent a prophet just preaching. We believe a message. &gt;&gt; But see God's desire was to positionally placed them in the land. That's right. &gt;&gt; To adopt them as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; For 38 years, they lacked the desire for the supernatural because it was ridiculed. It was made fun of. It was blasphemed and they let what the old warriors had to say about it keep them out of it. But I want you to understand the promise was still true. Amen. &gt;&gt; The promise still remained. &gt;&gt; And God is taking a people in Leodysa, taking them out of a Leodysian atmosphere, raising them up into a bride atmosphere so they can realize they're not part of Leodysia. They're not going to be lukewarm, laxidasical, but they're going to be on fire with the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we keep going, and I'm going to bring this down here shortly. I'll give you my word on that. See, God promised the Holy Spirit to every believer. So, he promised that land to every believer. And brother Bam says he wants to give it to you tonight more than you even want to receive it. &gt;&gt; And I wonder where some of us are. We struggle service after service. And we struggle in between services thinking is it for me? Can I be different? Can I receive it? Can I tell you it is for you &gt;&gt; that he wants to give it to you even more than you want to receive it. &gt;&gt; See Kadesh Barnea means a time of decision. And you got to make a decision today in this service. There's a hiding place. &gt;&gt; There's a place of rest, a place of refuge, a place of safety. And it's in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are you just going to keep going around the mountain &gt;&gt; circling the same old things, same old habits, same old fears, same old defeats, same old struggles. Oh, but I believe God's in a profit, but you're just going around and around and around and around. So, you got to make a decision. And I say, let's take the land today. musicians, won't you come? &gt;&gt; Let's take the land, church. &gt;&gt; He says, I go to prepare a place for you. If it wasn't so, I would have told you. &gt;&gt; Not only is he got a land prepared, a place prepared. He's got a He's got it all ready. Well, the Ellie said he's got the wedding garment prepared. He's got the ring prepared. He's got the banquet prepared. He's got the house prepared. Everything that you have need of, he's already prepared it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's just waiting for somebody that'll take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Somebody says, "Thou art my hiding place." &gt;&gt; I'm not running to psychology. I'm not running to, you know, this one or that one or this habit or that thing there. But the Lord is my hiding place, my place of rest. And in a time of trouble, in a time of wickedness, we realize today, church, that there's wars and rumors of war. There's Russia fighting a war with Ukraine. There's Hamas fighting a war with Israel. Then there's shouts of peace, peace in the Middle East. Our great president, fearless Trump going over there signing peace deals, trying to negotiate and barter, negotiate, using his his political power to bring peace in the Middle East. Where are we at? &gt;&gt; They're building bomb shelters &gt;&gt; thinking they're going to they're going to outlast. They're building bomb shelters, brother Derek, to stay here versus to leave. Don't you build a bomb shelter in your mind &gt;&gt; thinking I'm going to live so close. I'm going to study the message. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. Just get into the hiding place. &gt;&gt; Just receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Just consecrate your life to God. He says, "Oh, they're building THEY'RE BUILDING THESE GREAT BIG BOMB SHELTERS AND YOU KNOW WHEN THEM BOMBS HIT, IT'LL BLOW a hole 150 50 MILES WIDE and so many feet deep." HE SAID, "IT'LL CRUSH EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY." HE SAYS, "WE HAVE ONE BOMB SHELTER [music] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT MADE WITH STEEL. IT'S NOT MADE BY MAN'S HANDS, BUT IT'S UNDER THE FEATHER OF HIS WINGS." THAT'S THE BELIEVER'S TRUE HIDING PLACE. AND GOD SENT US A MESSAGE IN THIS HOUR TO BRING YOU THERE, TO SHELTER YOU, AND TO PROTECT US. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And I can say like David said, God, [music] thou &gt;&gt; and thou alone &gt;&gt; are my hiding place. &gt;&gt; Let us just stand. I want you to bow your heads this morning. Thou and thou alone are my hiding place. Maybe you're here and you've gone through [music] trials and situations, but can you say like David, though the Lord's [music] hand was heavy upon me, thou art my hiding place, thou shalt preserve me from all evil, and songs of praise shall indwell develop me. If that's you this morning, just lift your hand to God with every head bowed, every eye closed. Lord, I want you this morning. [music] I don't want to just hear about a vindicated voice. I don't want to just go through the motions of church [music] and church antity and doing what we supposed to do as believers. But God, I really want an experience. I want to I want to find peace. I want to find rest in that land. I don't want to look out and say what I got to give up. I want to die this morning, Lord, to the things of the world. [music] Father, you see every hand that's lifted this morning. [music] You see every young person's hand raised, Father, every old alike. Lord, you know the struggles that they face. of God, right here in this moment, in this atmosphere. I believe you [music] can draw nigh, Lord. It's after the trial, after the tribulation that the presence of the Lord draws near. And we receive the promise, the fourth man, the angel of the Lord, Elohim [music] speaking to us. Melzdc after the battle. Father, how we thank you for this message. But Lord, may we not just rest [music] on God sending a voice. How may we follow that voice into that land to the fullness of the word of God, the opening of the word. Father, I pray you'll continue to bless us and pour out your [music] spirit, God, on Evening Light Tabernacle, Lord, and churches around the world that are standing faithful and gallant and true to the message. They're not [music] interjecting their own ideas, Lord, but they're staying faithful to the to the word of God. Preaching what a prophet pro [music] what he preached, Lord. God, help us to get ourselves out of the way and help us to reconsecrate and to consecrate our lives, Lord, with the greatest sincerity and truth that we can rightly divide the word and speak things of life. Lord, I thank you for our church. I thank you for the believers here, Lord. each and every one. I thank you Lord what they consist Father how we come together Lord week in and week out we have fellowship one with another Father and as iron sharpen his iron so does we sharpen one another Father I pray you'll sharpen your people today God I pray you'll just Lord draw them into that place that secret chamber God the things of the world is sealed out and you're [music] sealed in all the cares, all the struggles, all the difficulties. God, I worship you through it all. Father, forgive us where we've failed you. Forgive us where we have come short. [music] God, our desire is to make it all the way. Not just twothirds of the journey, but into the hiding place. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Are you? There's a crowd. [singing] There's [music] a worry deep inside. There's a longing [singing] [music] only you can sis [music] in your [music and singing] presence. I have sw. I have labor.
