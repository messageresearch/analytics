this morning friends okay what's your face what you're dealing with don't you fear he's right here with us just like he said he would be amen what a wonderful savior that we have this morning we greet you in the name of the lord jesus and count it's such an honor to be with you today and such a beautiful church first time we've got to see it it was just it's beautiful i'm just so happy for you thankful for each one that came out thankful to have my wife with me most of all we're thankful that the lord jesus is here with us this morning if you have your bibles turn with us to the book of mark and while you're turning out we want to thank our precious brother tim for allowing us to come and i know a great man of god has stood here behind this pulpit and i certainly feel like the least of them but i certainly appreciate him allowing me to come and express what the lord has put on my heart i trust to be a blessing to you this morning we want to read from mark chapter 4 starting at verse 35. the bible says this and the same day when the eve was come he said unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and they were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on the pillar and they awake him and said unto him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that ye have no faith and they feared excellence said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him what manner of man is this he's my lord let us bow our heads i want to speak to you for a few minutes this morning on he's in the ship heavenly father we are so glad in our hearts to call you father and we thank you lord for your mercy and for your grace that has been given to us for the bible says while we were yet sinners christ died for us and lord we counted such an honor to gather here today with your children lord and father we surrender every thought dear god and every attitude lord and anything there god that would hinder us from receiving from you today we surrender it to you lord we asked dear god that you would take the preeminence of this service god that you would anoint the people's faith that they could rise up and receive that which you've already given them lord for father every redemptive blessing was secured for us that day at calvary and we thank you lord father we ask you today dear god that you'd be mindful of the needs of our folks at home lord those that are suffering today dear god may your spirit move upon each one father and lord before the sun was set today lord may they be healthy and well for thou art god lord we bring our precious sister karen before you today lord ask and dear god that you would do what would be seemingly impossible but father you specialize in those kind of things lord and we look to you today lord that you would move upon these needs and father those that would hear god whether their need would be great in someone's eyes or whether it would be small in someone else's eyes father god may you move forever need in the building lord that when we leave this service today may we say did not our hearts burn within us as he walked and talked with us along the way blessed brother to him lord bless the ministers the officers of the church dear god father we pray may signs and wonders be wrought at the hands of the believers for this is the hour of the manifestation of the sons of god upon the earth lord and i pray god let the light shine forth god from this community that they may know that thou art the same yesterday today and forever that it's not a logan dear god it's not a sign lord but it is a reality dear god you manifested in your people fulfilling the promise of your word that you've made in this last day granted father as we surrender these things into your hands for your glory for we ask it in jesus name and the bride says god bless you saints you may be seated this morning i'd like to call your attention back to verse 40 where the bible says this and he said unto them why are ye so fearful and how is it that you have no faith and i was just thinking about this scripture it reminded me of something that the prophet of god said when he was speaking on fear and faith and the prophet said he said now i thought tonight that i would talk on faith for a little while and just build up on christian faith for i find out that one of the greatest hindrances of the church has got today is that they're scared to death and he said what are you scared about that's what i'm wondering if you're only if you're if you'll just only realize who you are if you'll just only realize who you are you don't know who you are you don't know who that is that's sitting next to you you say oh that's my neighbor i know him all right but he's a son of god see that's right adopted by jesus christ into the family and that's a daughter of god sitting next to you and who are you if you're a christian if you're a believer then you're a son and daughter of god then what are you scared about there's no need of being scared so as long as the devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then as long as he can keep you scared that's all he wants to do so then we realize we haven't come to this understanding that amnesia of not knowing who you are feeds fear as long as the devil can keep you confused as long as the devil one day you think you're brian and the next day you're not sure as long as he can keep you confused that you don't know who you are he's got you exactly where he wants you amen but you see so when we understand that amnesia feeds fear but realizing who you are produces faith for brother brethren said jesus had perfect faith because he knew who he was in the word and the word of god will never fail you emotional fail and sensational fail but the word of god will never fail you amen perfect love cast out all fear and love and faith is the same thing the prophet said love perfect love cast out all fear which gives faith then you say what are you saying i'm saying this let us come this morning with this revelation of who we are we are not a cult we are not a denomination we are not an organization we are his body on the earth amen we are the body of jesus christ on the earth today if we can ever come to that realization that he's just changed his mask you know we've been wearing these masks and i was in a store the other day and the the guy that came in he must have been a local and i was standing there and he walked in with this mask on and the the lady behind the cash register she said what john you've changed your mask when she said that i'm not shouting past dictatorships because don't you see my brother my sister that's all he's done in this hour the god that was in jesus he's just changed his mass gay man that same god is now in the hearts of his people fulfilling this ministry for this day amen let us come with this revelation of who we are and let our faith in who we are in him cast out all fear amen oh hallelujah that we open our scripture we find that jesus is telling his disciples to get into the boat and let us pass over to the other side so where you think they're going they're going to the other side you know why because he said so amen now the reason they're making this journey across this water is because that on the other side of the lake or the sea is the gallerians on the other side is gadara and there is a man who's living among the tombs we know him as the maniac of gadara and he was crying out for help he was voting deliverance so jesus got into the ship and he crossed the stormy sea that night for the call of one needy soul [Applause] notice it wasn't the mayor that called him it wasn't the president of the country that called him it was a maniac oh hallelujah let me tell you god will appear before any honest heart no matter how insignificant it may seem to be my he got into the ship and he crossed the stormy sea for the sake of one needy soul orphanage don't you say well brother now if we had 600 here we could call him on the sea if we had a thousand year we could call him on the scene but i'm here to tell you we don't need 500 we don't need 50 we don't need 12. we just need one sincere heart [Applause] somebody that'll look beyond the storm somebody that'll look beyond the waves and call him on the scene amen [Applause] jesus crossed the sea all the way over into gadara to give mercy to one man thank you buddy oh god let that be me this morning no one else would be me lord he's the same jesus tonight he'll come from glory for one needy soul setting in a humble church this morning the same one he'll every time come to where he's wanted but he never comes to where he's doubted you so you believe god heals oh yeah everybody yeah we believe god heals you believe god will heal you it's a big difference but you see when you fix that little bit of doubt it makes it a hybrid faith and hybrid faith produces nothing amen don't doubt just believe he'll never show up to where there's doubt but he will come to where someone wants him to come the matter of fact the prophet said he wants to come to you he'll send a man to preach the gospel he'll send a man to sing a song to create an atmosphere because he's wanting to come to you amen he'll come this morning to every brother and says he'll come every time he's wanted but he never comes to where he's doubting then i say let's lay aside every doubt lay aside every fear and believing there's nothing oh my there's nothing that's able to stop him from coming when you call upon him there is nothing that'll stop him from coming to you the wind couldn't stop him the waves couldn't stop him the storm couldn't stop him the sea couldn't stop him the devils could not stop him from coming to abraham there is nothing that can stop him from coming to you when you call on him amen you see my brother my sister it wasn't the man's voice that got jesus attention he was on the other side of the lake he never heard his voice it's not how loud we scream it's not our that's not what gets his attention what gets god's attention faith amen amen your faith can stop him it wasn't the man's voice that caught brought jesus across the sea it was his faith like the little boy that was in the shopping mall they said brother branham i'm lost as lost can be i'm like a coin and a sand pile lost but the prophet said you don't have to stay that way son there is someone standing present now who can find you the minute you want to be found and the little boy said i'm ready are you ready this morning oh hallelujah don't doubt him just believe him this morning if you're doubting him just remember he'll never be at your door but if you love him and you want him he'll come to you any time you call for him he's ready to come verse one standing present this morning who can find you the moment you want to be found i don't care where you're living i don't care what you've done come on somebody i don't care what sickness you're facing i don't care what the doctor said there's someone right now who can find you the minute you want to be found you just have to call on his name when we call on the name of jesus amen with someone standing president who can heal you the moment you want to be healed who can deliver you the moment you want to be delivered someday some happy day i say today not sunday don't put it off to tomorrow he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble amen so the fine this meeting is coming to a close and he tells his disciples let's get into the boat let's go to the other side you see he's feeling the pull of the maniac's need so he gets into the ship and jesus is with them and they begin to cross over the seed now jesus being the word he knew all things so he knew the maniac was on the other side he knew he would deal with that in the morning he knew the storm was coming he knew the devils would try to drown them he knew the pig farmers would reject him and ask him to leave he knew all of that he already knew that but he never looked at the barriers he looked at the victory hallelujah you know what a horse race when they line them up there at the gate you know they back the horses in and they put that gate across them you know what they call that gate they call it the barrier but the barrier is only the evidence that there's a victory line just ahead don't you see my brother my sister when the devil tries to hinder you when he tries to hold you back that's the evidence god's got something for you amen don't see the barrier see the victory hallelujah hallelujah he spoke let us pass over to the other side and that was his word and the bible says his word will not return unto him void but it will accomplish that which it was set to do he knew the waves were coming he knew the storm was brewing he knew the winds would pick up but he also knew his word would carry them through so he finds him a place to sleep and lays down now who would find a place to sleep on a boat when a hurricane category 5 is coming someone who knows the power of his word he knew the storm was coming but he wasn't worried he wasn't nervous because he knew the storm did not control him but he would control the star neighborhood let me tell you something brother my sister we're not wandering down here lost we have a predetermined destiny we come from somewhere we're going back to somewhere hallelujah [Applause] amen he would know the storm would not control him but he would control the story you see it seems like every time we try to do something for the lord every time we try to help someone or try to draw closer to god to walk and obedience to his word it's them times that snags comes hindrances comes storms begin to rage but you see god never told us to go back god equipped us as an army we are the army of the lord and he's equipped us but i want you to notice there's not one piece of armor on our backs because we are never to turn back we're going forward we are moving forward and as long as we're in the will of god there is nothing that will stop our progress amen jesus says let's go over to the other side he had a job to do tired and weary he lays down to rest knowing he's in the will of the father moving forward across the sea to the maniac of gadara the disciples here they go moving across this lake the sea they notice here they go they were in the message of the hour jesus was with them they were having a revival they were in a testimony service all the things they seen him do all the blinded eyes and all the leprosy all the things they saw they were testifying by god what a move we're in where his disciples were moving with him this journey it should be sweet it should be smooth sailing no worries no bumps we're his disciples we're moving with him we're message people we're message followers sounds good but jesus never promised that he never said we wouldn't have trials he never said we wouldn't suffer he never said we wouldn't be laughed at or made fun of him he never promised a smooth sailing he never said there wouldn't be storms he never said that but he did say i will never leave you no when i forsake you then no matter what i face in life i do not face it alone he is with me he will never leave me nor will he forsake me well hallelujah and as they were going across the sea the storm began to blow away now peter being a seasoned fisherman no doubt he thought i've got this i don't need prayer i don't need faith i've got ability i'm a fisherman i'm a seasoned boat worker i guess that's the wrong term but you know what i mean boatman thank you buddy i've got this boys no worry oh i've seen storms like this before this ain't nothing oh my and he began to try to manipulate the boat and all his ability as a semen but you see what peter fell to realize this just wasn't a storm this was a storm maybe the greatest storm of his life maybe the darkest time of his come on somebody maybe the darkest time of his life and let me say this may be the darkest time of your life right now but that's always when jesus shows up hallelujah he always comes at the darkest hour it was the darkest hour that the woman with the blood as you ever seen the doctor said they couldn't help her she'd spend all of her money 12 years of bleeding it was her darkest hour then jesus came on the scene it was the darkest hour journalist ever saw his daughter laying dead but it was at that darkest hour that jesus showed up he said oh brother now that's peter that's the woman with the blood issue this is me well let me tell you brother sister if this is your darkest hour if i was you i'd be getting ready for my visitation it ain't no time to doubt it's time to believe it's time to rise it's time to stand it's time to make us stand the devil don't give up hallelujah [Applause] jesus was crossing the sea the prophet said the devil knew he was on the road to a great victory the devil do it hey you preached a message on that didn't you the devil knows the devil knows he just lies to you the devil knows god's a healer he knows god's a deliverer but he'll tell you he won't deliver you he's lying to you well better how you know the devil's lying to me when he speaks it's pretty good indication he was on the road to a great victory for god and he tried to drown him that night and caused the storm to come up and ten thousand devils of the sea who knew there was that many ten thousand devils of the sea swore that drowned him that night he was tired laying in the stern of a boat tired because you see it was deity in humanity never let your humanity take the preeminence over the deity that's in you oh hallelujah brother how could i be a son of god how could i be a daughter of god and have all these troubles and have all these trials don't look at the humanity look at what's in you remember what he did for you the great storm began to rise and as the sails were torn and the oars began to break and they tossed around like a bottle stopper the prophet of god said choppy water maybe 20 foot waves where was jesus it looks like if he really cared he'd have been up there with him if he really cared he had it right there on peter's shoulder now peter hang on buddy i'm with you it's gonna be all right if you really care why wasn't he up there with peter why wasn't he at the at the stern if he really cared he would have told them the storm was coming he knew it was coming he knew when it would hit the very moment it would hit but where was he in the back of the boat no at the end from the beginning he knew what was going to happen the prophet said don't miss this he knew it was going to happen the prophet said i doubt very much that he was even asleep he knew it was going to happen then why didn't he stop it we're his people he loves us he was god god is infinite so he knew what was going to happen he knew when it was going to happen and it only happened to test our faith didn't he say so later a real child in testing time with this they do not walk by sight two children of god walks by faith you could never walk my side and walk by faith at the same time you must deny one in order to receive the other but i say to you don't look at the circumstances don't look at the wind don't look at the storm look to the one who made the promise amen a real child of god in testing time they do not walk by sight their physical eyes are closed to the things around them the only walk by faith of the lord jesus looking to his word and believing that he'll keep every promise of his word exactly the way he said he would do it testing time trials sometimes god lets afflictions hit his people to test their faith he was testing a saint not rebuking a sinner well i must be doing something bad over for satan to be attacking me for this to be happening to my family no don't let the devil lie to you it's not rebuking a sinner it's testing a saint god does that to test he lets afflictions hit us and trials comes a big trial sometimes great waves great storms great win why to show you just how great he is listen to me friends we don't deny we have real tears real fear real sorrow real feelings because we're human real pain real trials real feeling real hurt real tears real sorrow but a real god who's bigger my god's bigger than all my trials he's bigger than all my chest maybe that's why you're sick tonight the prophet said maybe that's why there's a law in your revival god's going to see what you're going to do about it everybody can worship god when everybody's running the aisles but who can stand and believe him when everything seems like it's going wrong and yet it doesn't move your faith oh god let me be that kind of a warrior sometimes the giant is so big people were vetting on it if they was betting on the david david and goliath fight who would have vegas bet on where would they put their money on the giant goliath was a giant david was a boy goliath was a champion warrior he had trophies david was a shepherd goliath had a sword david had a slingshot goliath was dressed in armor david was dressed in sheepskin who won why god was with david amen [Applause] don't look at the giant look at who's with you amen trouble sets in the storm was so great the wind the rain the lightning they were so busy fighting for their lives they forgot that the very one that said let us go to the other side the very creator was in the boat with them the very thing the very one who created the wind who created the rain was in the boat with them he should have known he knew all things they should have knew that he knew what was going to happen they should have remembered he has it all in control why was he letting it happen when he got into the ship why did he just go lay down he knew it was going to happen why the prophet said he was only testing their faith do you believe what i tell you ain't that something jesus never asked for our money he never asked for our ability he never asked for our education all he ever asked us to do was just believe do you believe what i tell you finally when the waves had them beat down and the wind was so strong and they were going to sink it looked like everything was crashing in it wasn't getting better it was getting worse what are we going to do what are we going to do no their fear and all their anguish the greatest storm of their life 10 000 demons tried to drown them finally he realized wait a minute wait a minute where's jesus he's in the boat with us then the answer to the storm was in the boat with them awake the master hallelujah the answer wasn't in gadara the answer wasn't on the shore of the other country the answer was in the boat with them well he rebukes the storm the winds see obeys him that was a great calm and he turned to them said why was you so fearful where is your faith did not i say we're going to the other side did not he say we're going in a rapture did not he say i'll send you elijah the prophet did not he say there would be a fivefold ministry for the perfecting of the saints has not he kept every promise he's made us that same god who said that i'm your healer i'm your deliverer that saint god said you are going in our actions amen amen who are you so fearful was not i with you the whole time you know there is among the cherokee it's called the rite of passage when a boy reaches the age of 12 his father takes him to a secret place sets him on a rock or on a stump and the father will take a blindfold and blindfold the boy's eyes and he ties his hands and he ties his feet but he ties them loose so that the boy wants to get out he can it's his choice and he sets him on a stump or he sets him on a rock and the boy must sit there all night long if he gets up he fails the test if he moves the blindfold he fails to test he must sit there all night long but if he sets there and he's faithful to the test at the rising of the sun when the rays of the sun strikes the boy's face he can come out of the ties because remember they're loose he can come out of the ties take off the blindfold and he's a man it's called the right of passage so the father takes the boy sets him on a stump or a rock blindfolds him ties his hands ties and feet the boy sits there oh it's fine you know about 10 10 30 11 o'clock the wind starts blowing the leaves you get that little scared feeling when it's dark outside you ain't got a flashlight i used to take my girls camping you know out in the backyard i tell the sheryl i say leave the door unlocked we'll be in about 11 o'clock first time the coyote yelps we'll be coming in the sounds of the night but he must sit there the rustle of the leagues what is it is it a bear is it a coyote is it a shawnee looking for a scalp he don't know he's blindfolded so he must sit there all night the sounds of the force the wind the rustle of the leaves but at the dawning of a new day if he's been faithful to the test and the light strikes him he takes off the blindfold he comes out of the ties he takes off the blindfold and it's only then that he realizes sitting behind him was his daddy he was there he was there he was there he was there the whole time he never left him well don't worry about the darkness of laodicea don't worry about the rustle of the leaves of clogan don't worry about the fearmongers don't worry about the politics he's with us [Applause] if he calmed the storm he can calm your storm if you calm their storm by being in the ship with them he can calm your storm by being in the ship with you the answer to the storm was in the ship with them and the answer to your storm is in the ship with you this morning the same jesus he's just changed ships he's just changed mask the same jesus making him the same yesterday today and forever brother bosworth said one day billy you know what fellowship is it's all i think so brother bob's worth but tell me what is it he said fellowship is two phallus in one ship two fellows and one ship so that's quite a bit of us this afternoon he says in the old ship of zion two fellows in the same ship as we travel on the sea of life let us remember that the bible says many of the affliction of the righteous but the lord delivereth them out of them how many oh well that's pretty good brother you got any scripture before besides that yeah i do glad you asked second timothy 3 11. persecution and afflictions which came unto me at antioch and income in leicester what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me his disciples sometimes get in physical trouble that they can't remedy such a sickness a cancer so forth that the doctors can't they don't know what to do about it but just remember who is in the ship he's got it all in control he's got it all in control he put that reassurance way down in my [Music] soul oh my if you allow me just to tell it one more time i promised the lord i would i promised the lord if he'd raised my daughter up i'd try my best to let the world know what he did for her the doctors told me there's no hope for her told me her brain was damaged so bad she had blood on her brain told her she'd never speak again she'd never swallow again she'd never walk again she'd never see again she'd never talk again if she even lived she'd just blame nothing she'd be nothing but a vegetable just laying in the bed that's what they told me that the doctors i worked with me and my wife both we worked in surgery we knew these doctors that was what they was telling us but one afternoon on the day of the funeral we wouldn't bury cheryl's daddy and cheryl's sister and i was sitting there in the weight room and a warm feeling come over me and a voice spoke to me and said your daughter shall live hallelujah it don't matter what the doctor says it don't matter what the ct scan says it don't matter what the mri said it does not matter the master spoke amen when god speaks when god speaks everything else shuts up the lion hath roared who will believe the report of the lord who will believe the report of the lord i will believe the report of the lord man when i went back to work you know what they told me he said we thought you lost your mind you started talking about her walking again and talking again and seeing again we was worried about you we thought you lost your mind i said i did i lost my mind i got the mind of christ hallelujah his report says i am healed his report says i am sealed [Applause] hallelujah amen you don't know what to do but remember who is in the ship don't look at the storm look at the one who's driving the ship amen that the father sent me he says even so send i you as the father sent me so send i you the father that sinning went with him and was in him and the christ that sends the man goes with him and is in him jesus christ in his church his branches energized bringing forth the same fruit he brought forth when he was here on the earth he's come to the church in the last days he's come in the fullness of the light of the sun not a partial light not an eclipse but the full light of the sun the prophet of god said your hands it's his hands when you're energized from the life of the vine your eyes is his eyes your lips is his lips your hands is his head when you're energized from the life of the vine i was in nicaragua a few years ago for the glory of god about that night it was just to me to have a prayer line there's so many so we thought we just have one mass prayer for the people and i told the people i said just lay hands on one another stage about four foot off the ground was up on the stage about 600 people just as far back as you can see where people about halfway back on the end was a sister and i told the saints of god i said just lay hands on one another and bow your head and we'll have one mass prayer and just as i got ready to pray something spoke to my heart she said go lay your hands on her and i jumped off the platform and i went down by that time you know i hadn't started praying so people you know how we are they was picking out one eye to see why i hadn't started

said can i speak to you i said yes ma'am i don't speak spanish through an interpreter brother danny torreira's interpreted for me she said tonight when you told the people lay hands on one another she said nobody laid hands on me she said i thought what's wrong with me that nobody would want to pray for me she said i thought don't nobody care for me she said i begin to cry she comes to brother daryl i just wanted somebody to lay their hands on me and she said i was praying and said i got to cry and i said lord why won't nobody lay their hands on me and she said a voice spoke to me and said i'll lay my hand on you he said that voice no sinner spoke brother now then you put your hand in my hand now am i jesus of course not but he used my hands like you use your heads he wants to use your hands your lips your eyes it's christ in you the hope of all glory hallelujah do you love him then he's in the ship this morning amen the prophet said you're still the the you're still in the ship
