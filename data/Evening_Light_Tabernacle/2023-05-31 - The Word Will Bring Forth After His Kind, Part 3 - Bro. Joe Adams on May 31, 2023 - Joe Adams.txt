just Commit This Time To You Lord in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles you can turn to Genesis we're going to look pick back up our series and tonight we're going to do the word will bring forth after his Kind part three uh there's going to be some repetition here a few things we'll go back over but you know what the best way to learn is to go over and over and over and over so I'm not going to bore you with it all but it's gonna we're gonna we're just working on the teaching gift all right so tonight we're just going to look back over this and some things we're going to get into that we kind of touched on in the last couple services but we'll dive a little bit deeper in some of these different parts here but we just bring greetings from Brother Joseph we were just there in Murfreesboro Tennessee for their annual uh Memorial Day youth banquet and their services that weekend and we had a tremendous time the Lord dealt with a certain individual a certain little lady that he put on my heart before we got there and as we just kind of kept going from service to service to service to service you can just see God move God move God move and God move and I'll just give you a brief testimony as you're you're standing just briefly but she come in she's kind of a worldly girl raising a Christian home but she had these long fingernails on all painted up things of that nature and uh so that was Friday night and I spoke on missed opportunities and the Lord just dealt with her she came to the altar come again Saturday night she had the long fingernails on but there was no paint on them this time and the makeup on her face a little got a little bit lighter not much uh and I spoke on the second night I spoke on you have a purpose and God just really ministered to her because she had she had done some things and felt like she had gone too far and so anyway the next morning Sunday morning I spoke on uh it's not the end of the story well she come in Sunday morning she didn't have the fingernails on makeup was off her face Sunday night she got baptized re-baptized so if it was just for one it's worth it all so God gets the glory for that and uh we had a wonderful time there's a lot of young people there's other stories there there's another 18 year old boy that we just kind of they told me I kind of walked down his life and just came right behind and you know some issues in the home and Lord just kind of dealt with it so you know when we go we go as an extension of you all so we're going to be leaving as soon as we get done tonight we're going to be getting the RV and heading to Flagstaff Arizona so I'd covet your prayers we'll be speaking with brother Samuel Browning there brother Dale Smith his annual meetings there so if you would remember us in prayer we appreciate it continue to remember brother Tim and Timothy as they're traveling in tonight I believe or maybe tomorrow and brother Aaron and sister Lydia are on their way to Virginia so God's got a great work here so it's not it's not just us that are going you're going with us so keep us in prayer so we're going to look here in Genesis 1 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created heed them and God blessed him remember last time we spoke about that word blessed air means god stepped back and he adored his creation he praised it what a wonderful creation that he has gotten and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth God bless you you can have your seats also turned to Ephesians 1 if you would tonight we're going to look here in Ephesians 1 and we're going to also look in Romans 9 as we start building our platform for our service tonight let me start my timer brother Dale Smith told me he said cut it short get on the road and come this way I said hey buddy I heard that brother Aaron stepped into some of our time so we just keep digging into everybody's time we're going there's no more time to get and I dare you I promise you I'm not going to cut into brother Tim's time tonight so we've got to worry about that what we find here in Ephesians 1 Paul says an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints that which are in Ephesus into the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be unto you in peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according now this is the word or this scripture here is what I want us to clue in on tonight because we're going to kind of come back to this off and on throughout this sermon tonight but according he as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so we can take verse 4 and we can go back to Genesis 1 26 and we can find let us make man in our image in our likeness and let them have dominion and then we come back here in Ephesians 4 Paul telling us according as he has chosen Us in him so we find also in John 1 you don't have to turn there but in the beginning was the word the word was with God and no Word was God and in verse 14 that word that logos was made flesh so here in when we were chosen in him we were chosen in that thought because God knew what he was going to do in his whole entire creation so we find here that according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Romans 9 and verse 11. for the children being not yet born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but at him that call us so here we find there's a key phrase here that the purpose of God according to election so the purpose of God we find that purpose again in Genesis 1 26. God's purpose was to have a creation God's purpose was to make Man In His Image God's purpose was to bring forth Offspring was to bring forth spoken word children so we find that there let's keep going now when he says and and it was said unto her that the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved and he's all have I hated now we're going to look here in the uh you have to excuse me I'm come home sick from the meetings this past weekend but there's nobody else to preach and so it follows my lot so you know just pray for my voice but I'm just going to take it slow tonight uh the Lord knows what he's doing but we find here in the exposition of seven Church Angels brother bam says now we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election and I'm going to dive into that word election here in just a little bit so we can kind of get an understanding if I don't make it all the way through tonight with this well we'll have other opportunities but it was it was but the man says it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride so I want you to make this we're going to take it slow tonight but I want you to key in on this this is from the church age book and this is where everything is summarized throughout the entire message and we come here and we find it was it was purposed in him Genesis 1 26 you go back there and you find this is the reason what was God's intention and we're going to look at that here again but we find it was purposed in him it was God's purpose to bring forth to people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him not chosen in a denomination not chosen in a church building not chosen in your favorite preacher not chosen in mom and dad and whatever else but chosen in him so we find in him is Jesus and so we go back to the beginning and we find where it all originated brother bam says now she was foreknown and beloved there's a lot of times you don't feel beloved is it you feel worthless the devil's been in your ear kicking you and you know and telling you this down the other but he says you she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never understand this church she can never come into condemnation why can she never come into condemnation because she was chosen in him so no matter what you're going through in life no matter what you face especially you young people as you mature and you go through different seasons and different times of your life and the Devil comes with this complex and this idea and this depression and this anxiety and this fear and this complex and all these different things I want you to know tonight that you are chosen in him and therefore there is now no condemnation now that doesn't give you a free pass to go live any ungodly life that you want but it means if you are chosen in him then you would make the choice to serve him to surrender your heart to him and to allow him to be the king of the of your heart and so therefore you are not going to come into condemnation never come into condemnations she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her Romans 4 verse 8. blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels notice what he says here her name each of her members was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so your name was put there before the foundation of the world so God already decreed that you're going to be okay because you were chosen in him there ain't enough devils in hell can erase that name let me just tell you this tonight if you're a child of God no matter what mistakes you make it will not remove your name from that book no matter how many times you fall no matter how many times you make mistakes you're going to get back up and you're going to keep on because your name has already been put there and though you may not feel like you fit the mode though you may you make mistakes and it seems you have had good days and bad days you're going to eventually come to life and you're going to match the word that God's already decreed for you to come to so we find here now listen to what brother Brown says in things that are to be he says Jesus was the fullness of the godhead manifest and how many can agree with that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the Earth and was manifested in the flesh you were in him okay you were in him because he was the word and in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word was made flesh therefore you walk with him so let's change our thinking for a little bit tonight you know we come in here and we think man we've had a bad day we didn't walk through the Molly Groves we've done this we've done that but here we find the prophet of God said you walk with him you were in him you was on the earth you suffer with him you died with him you bury with him and you are risen with him and notice and you're sitting right now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he goes oh that means so much nowadays that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ so no matter what you're going through in the darkness the Dark Cloud that comes over you in your night seasons and Satan's coming down upon you come back to this quote come back to this reality that you were chosen in him you therefore you walked with him when he walked ashores of Galilee when he suffered you suffered when he went to hell you went to hell but when he rose again you Rose again what does that tell you that Satan can't keep you down because you're predestinated to rise because he's already risen on your behalf he says now we can't live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism now how many of you come from a denomination Baptist Presbyterian Methodist MEC or whatever y'all little initials y'all put behind your own churches what is it there it is see she got up we've got all these we got all these denominations everywhere we come from I come from man I Church hopped all over the place until I finally landed where I needed to be so we find here but we cannot live brother L on denominationalism we must live by the word because a bride is part of the bridegroom all right like any wife is part of her husband now this ain't a wife just kicking and screaming and going contrary to her husband but any wife is part of her husband notice Eve come from Adam and so this bride comes from chosen in him she comes from him therefore she possesses the same traits qualities attributes that he possesses so we find here the bride because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour don't be too excited about the manifestation of the hour Mercy man so what is this word brought the manifestation of the hour so why don't we act like we act because it's the manifestation of the hour why are we so excited brother Mike because it's the manifestation of the hour why do we got joy in my soul because it's the manifestation of the hour we can sing that song you don't know like I know what he's done for me because why because it's the manifestation of the hour look some people they people can't get excited because they don't know who they are but we know who we are we've been quickened by the word and therefore we find ourselves in the mirror of the word and recognize we are the manifestation of the hour where it's not just on a prophet it's not just on Jesus Christ but it's Jesus had a he had a purpose in his mind before the foundation and that was to have a wife that was to have a family that was a produced Offspring and I'm looking at the manifestation of the hour that should excite you so no matter what you're going through how bad life gets you're the manifestation of the hour you are the revealed word made known in this hour he said the bride not a Creed our denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God see not displaying your own attributes but displaying the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in the hour that we're now living so in John 6 37 we find that all that their father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I shall in no wise cast out praise the Lord come on somebody all that the father has given to me I will no wise cast out somebody should just I mean say a little amen come on and no man can come accept notice now no man can come accept the father draweth oh let's put these two together and recognize that all that the father hath given me shall come and no man can come but what the father draws him so what is he doing he ain't drawing unseed he's drawing those that came from him and he's drawn them back to him I say oh praise God Lord that just gives me hope tonight to know that I am that seed and you will not cast me out no matter how low I get no matter what I go through on this side of Eternity God I am seen him because I am see I'm going to produce the word for this hour I will be the manifestation of the hour come on bride put a smile on your face little bride you got something to be excited about this is not everybody's message but it's your message I mean John 1 and verse 12 but as many as receipts so here's the key many as received him so you got to receive the Revelation you've got to receive the word you got to receive him received him gave he the power to become the sons of God oh man greatest Revelation you'll ever get in your life is to realize you're a son and just like brother Tim said the other day when he speaks of sons he's speaking of you ladies as well as Global as a form of humanity so and we find here that he has given us the power the ability the desire to become sons of God to become offspring of God nothing that you had to do to deserve it to earn it to work it to Merit it it was in God because you were chosen in him so he gave us the power to become sons of God even to them that believed on his name which were born now notice not a blood so can't be mama can't be Daddy can't be preacher Deacon whoever else you want to put there nor of the will of Flesh not of your own power your own might nor the will of man but of God this is beautiful Church Ephesians 1 and verse 5. notice again according as he has chosen chosen in him before the foundation of the world and brother Brown says now Jesus Christ is choosing his bride I kind of picked up on this this weekend I was Crossing Lines trying to speak to the young people and I got into talking about a girl a man choosing his wife and you know and says here no he noticed it he says Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just as same as men choose their Brides today aren't you thankful we don't have arranged marriages praise the Lord come on somebody you husbands and now I need to shout come over there thank you there ain't many options in Mississippi we could have got really messed up buddy for you think about it he's choosing his bride the same way that that we choose our bride today notice he says now the bride today doesn't simply decide she's going to take a certain man for a husband so sister be nice yeah I better be almost gonna walk on yeah man this is so good I have to do it I'm not gonna do it I want to so bad there's wisdom here right let's move on see the bride today doesn't simply decide she's going to take a certain man see it's the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride see notice he's looking for something that's inside of him and I told the story and I'll tell it over and over until the day I die but when I first came to church here and I saw this we got we have some pretty young sisters at the time I'm not saying they're ugly now but I mean they're they're pretty I mean they were pretty then but I was young then take a drink of water take another drink but as I came in and you know my focus was the word and I just wanted to hear this is where I felt like the Lord was leaving me but you gather around the young people and I would watch my wife now which was Sister Jessica Scholl at the time and I was watched how she catered to people and they entertained her mom and dad and her sister would entertain young people and other people at her house and she served here and just was always busy just you know just playing character and here's the thing is I didn't know that character laid in me but I knew what I saw I liked and I I knew that that's what I was attracted to it was a bonus that she has a very pretty face I'm very thankful for that but it was her character it was her character because she has a christ-like character and so Jesus is not looking just for a pretty face but he's looking for a christ-like character because remember now she's from him now what if Adam would have rejected Eve but she he couldn't reject it because Eve came from him and nor can our Adam Christ reject us because we come from him so he looked here and brother tells us now in John 15 16 because you can go back to the I believe it's the Samaritan Church agent this is where I'm pulling from he says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you so as much as sister Jessica chased me I chose her she'll get me for that later but that's okay I got another 45 minutes behind the pulpit we'll be all right but see you have not chosen me and young ladies it's not you that chooses the mate the male he chooses you you simply say I do and that's what we simply say to him yes Lord I do I accept you I accept your leadership I accept your headship I accept you as my Lord to to rule over and to take care of me and to watch over me and protect me and guide me in my journey on this side I do I believe that's where we got to find you find so many marriages today and I don't know how I'm here but there's none of my notes but you got marriages today that are all scrupled up because we've got a we got a blending of rolls and we got a blending of boundaries here and God is saying he's already defined it right here and we understand that you are from the mail and it's it's not you choosing the mail but it's the male choosing you and you're simply saying I'm willing to come under the leadership I'm willing to come on her subjection to this and allow this individual this man to assume responsibility for my care and that's what he wants us to do is to come underneath his headship in his leadership and allow him to have responsibility over our lives all right so we find here now you have not chosen me but I've chosen you now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself so we go to Romans 9 and verse 11 notice that the purpose of God according to election now I love this part if you if you search the messages anywhere get this piece of it out frame it put it on your computer put it on your refrigerator but he said you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride somebody that's near to him that's a match to him and that purpose was in was in himself and being internal was to Creed before the foundation of the world now before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God God's an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him he was there and he was only potentially God and he was only known as the eternal spirit but right there and then the bride you was already in his mind praise God come on work with me tonight you were right there in his mind in his thoughts oh what a glorious thing to realize no matter what you're facing no matter the discouragements the lows of your life to realize right there you was in his mind and he said she was she was existing in the thoughts and what about the thoughts of God they are Eternal so no matter what you're going through it's only temporary you are Eternal you're going to outlast that trial you're going to outlast that situation you're going to outlast that environment you're going to outlast that that circumstance you're going to outlast that sickness because why because you are Eternal and it's only temporary foreign notice a true Christian how many is true Christian here tonight I should have everybody's hands some of y'all are paraplegics don't have hands all right Mike thank you I got it a true Christian will not look at such beauty queens and course girls and sex Queens he'll look for Christian character so look what he's looking for young boys this is what you're to look for in a mate in a future to create your home that environment is to not look for a pretty face not to look for chorus girls or sex Queens he'll look for a Christian character so those images that you're looking at on the computer that's not Christian character that ain't gonna be a mama that ain't gonna be a wife that's not going to be a homemaker that's going to be a home breaker gonna wreck your heart break your heart and break your home break your home and leave you with kids or you know have kids and all of a sudden you're nowhere to be found and the kids are nowhere and she's run off and your whole life's a mess and the kids are the ones that struggle so we find out he says you can't have all those he goes you can't have all things you might be or there might be one girl that's real pretty thank you Jessica and there's another girl maybe she's well you know her stature looks better than this one and brother Brandon does a real polite job of doing this he didn't say she was ugly and once pretty and one's ugly he had a real diplomatic political way of saying this he says now maybe she's a uh her stature looks better than this one and you might have to sacrifice one for the other but if she's not the statue of a lady or of a woman I don't care whether she's pretty or not you better look at her character whether she's pretty or not so if he's telling us that this is how we should Define our future mate because this is what God is looking for he's looking for the very same thing notice he speaks this through a prophet so that we can understand what God is looking for he's looking for character not how big you are how tall you are how much you've read your Bible how much you listen to quotes or the message and all that all your oh I did this and I did this and I did this it ain't about that he's looking for your character he says now it is becoming if a Christian would choose a wife that he ought to choose a genuine Born Again woman so notice we have a lot of young couples today you know they infatuated with each other and heart goes Peter Pat Petey Pat Pitty Pat how many of y'all remember that bro Jackson better raise your hand you're the only one brother David I mean brother brother Derek you should have raised your hand he but that's right there we go right there a perfect young couple oh we know I I remember how it was man butterflies in my stomach brother Mike you laugh man like just that glimmer of that eye on that little smile just set your heart a flame but we find here I say that to say this that we have to we have to to think Beyond just those things and realize that you're looking for somebody who's born again look at how pretty they are how intelligent they are how nice they are and yet we got couples who are dating and courting and their lives are a mess they don't they're not walking with the Lord they just have a facade of Christianity and they're just going through it and then you find out they they get married or they date and then because they're not where they need to be they make mistakes in their courtship and they're dating and all of a sudden there's a lot of things there and then you know hey you leave somebody tainted or you get married and you have a hard start because you didn't make the the Lord the preeminence of your life much less your marriage life and so young boys notice and young girls make sure you find somebody that has a genuine born-again experience look tall dark and handsome dude you ain't got the Holy Ghost bye I mean for real but daddy he's so handsome I don't care handsome handsome nothing we gotta protect our women we gotta protect our daughters brotherhail hey thankfully there ain't no been no suitors coming to my door yet because they know I'm rough and tough for the hell I'll get them to what for how to and when to do it we got to protect them and so I tell my girls I tell my son and we should tell all of our kids and we do make sure you find someone if you're going to continue a relationship and your heart becomes to get I don't know why I'm here but we are here tonight and this has got nothing to do with the word bringing forth but it's going to bring forth anyway so we find that if your life and if you're into a relationship and your heart with God is not where it needs to be it will never be where it needs to be with that spouse or that mate it'll never be there and so you got to make sure that that's right first okay because otherwise you're gonna have broken hearts broken lives broken marriages broken homes a lot of broken things not to say that God can't put the pieces back together but why allow the shattered glass why do why would we allow that when we can just focus on him in our youth While We're Young focus on it make him the preeminence of our life say Buster you may be tall dark and handsome but you ain't your life just ain't matching up no let's put this on pause and wait the best decision you'll ever make is put that thing on pause and wait and say I want to see some maturity I want to see because why because you're looking for character young ladies you're looking for characters somebody that can lead you somebody that can financially provide for you oh he may be all good looking oh bum's gonna be on the street because he can't hold down a job or work shy or something I want to get married I want to get married you got a job nope but you want to get I want to get married you studying nope you ain't studying nope you got any Investments no you got any properties no but you want to get married you ain't got nothing going for you the preacher said he was asked that question and this young man was asking all those questions he said I need you to pray that I want to get married he said Lord deliver our young sisters from this work shy no good for nothing bum I say Lord deliver ours I mean hey you ain't got to go off to college but make something of yourself get something that you can make a good living a decent living and provide for your home my this is off the word tonight I mean not off the word but off my notes tonight it's not off the word I promise you it ain't off the word this is good family 101 business but I mean just think about it not everybody has to have a college degree a master's degree a PhD lld you know we've taken that education slant that brother Bram talked about education education education he was referring to education as far as from a theological standpoint he understood that you got that you know it's okay to go get an accounting degree and make something and make a living or get this kind of degree or a Nursing degree or whatever kind of degree that you have to make a living you know but it's that theological degree that pulls people further away from God and or you know whatever these other degrees psychology and different things and they pull people away from God and they don't pull them to God but you know this school is not bad if you have the right mindset and motive with it because you're going to have to make it in life and so that's free to whoever wants to receive that but we find choose a genuine born-again woman regardless of what she looks like and young ladies you choose a born-again young man regardless of what he looks like I'll look for her okay how does he treat mama how's how does he treat Daddy or she he or she them we ain't using pronouns are we he and she when using them and they so how do they treat their their parents because that's how they're going to treat you all right how do they treat their friends because how they're going to treat you and your friends so you need to be looking at these things Okay can they can they get up in the morning at a decent hour are they laying there till 10 11 12 o'clock because they just stayed up all night gaming or reading or Facebooking or Instagram and our Snapchatting or tick talking or whatever so can they can they make something of themselves so you got to be looking at these things and so I'm looking at them like okay well this young man he's 18 19 years old he stays home all day long nah that's a flag you staying home you're 18 19 you're not in school anymore you eat Mama's food and Daddy's food and he's putting clothes on your back and casting your car and and you ain't got no job and you ain't going to school you sure ain't got no properties and no Investments so choose somebody that can make a life you know to somebody that can make a life make you a home boys and girls make you a home choose character because that's what God is choosing he's choosing character and that character is going to come forth through only through his bride okay it's not going to come through a denomination it's not going to come through the Badness or the Methodist or any of these other churches it's only going to come through his bride because his bride was chosen in him so therefore we are the only ones or the bride is the only ones are the only ones that can produce the character of Christ which is what he's looking for so we find now brother Brown says now God in Genesis 1 he said let there be light and there was light and he said it could have been 800 or thousands of years later before light ever came but Light Came so when he says let us make man in our image we're still in the seventh Church age and still seeds are coming to life because it's a decreed season a decreed time and that clock just keeps on ticking doesn't it so every seed will come forth in its time at the right time so don't rush it you know some of your brow beating your kids just commit them to God you say we're brother Joe that's easy your kids are in church well yeah but that's a lot of work went into that we're not promised we're just like anybody else you got to commit them to God it's a lot of prayer that goes on in the Adam's household and you know and there's a lot of give and take and compromise and no one wins of what battles to fight but keep that keep that that uh that home pure and and that that pure you don't compromise on the word with bringing things into your home you make sure you're at home is pure but we find now that every seed is going to come forth in its time if that is son or that daughter is a seed Gene of God they will come forth all right and there's no reason you should think that there won't all right so let me put that in there you like well brother Joe what do you mean if no I'm telling you you believe for your kid you believe for that child you believe for them brother Tony think about your daughter Lauren all these years and now I'm hearing stories about her you know you know gave her heart to the Lord and it's on fire for the things of God and yet that seed wasn't planted in a message Church all its life it was around it got an environment but at the right time at the right season the word came across the word in the word that was in her the seed that was in her heard the word and it came to itself and so that should encourage all of us and we look back and we think about the seeds that were planted look at Moses and Jeremiah and John the Baptist they all came in their decreed season and so are we coming in our decree season you couldn't come in the six age you came in this age because God needed somebody that was going to rise above all that laodicea I had to offer and Rise through all this muck and Murray and and mercury and or not Mercury Murray whatever and just the uh transgender and homosexual movement LBGTQ and just all this generation that we're in today he's got young people that love the word they stay with the word because there's a seed on the inside that will not let you go out of it and partake of that so notice he says now he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from it so in the Christ the mystery of God revealed he said back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and he was going to achieve Genesis 1 26. he was going to have a family he was going to bring forth seed and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed now notice what he says here first there wasn't a Moon Star at a molecule anything he was God but he wasn't exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there wasn't unto worship him but in his great mind he he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love but how could he be loved that there was nobody to love him so he created man in His image to love him notice now he also says in him was to be a father but how could he be a father when he had no offspring to father to call him Papa God to love him in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior how could he save if there was nobody to be lost and him was to be a Healer how could he have the attributes of being healer if there was nobody to get sick if his his offspring would not get sick and his offspring would not be lost and therefore these attributes that he had in him they had to come forth and brothers says all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God and so when God was thinking about his family was thinking about everything that he was going to do you were right there imagine if you could just go back in the mind of God and see it play out wouldn't that just be an awesome thought just go back you know how you can go back to black and white in those videos back in the long time ago when Charlie Chapman and it was just you look at it and everything just kind of speeds up and but you think you're going back in history there's some nostalgicness to it so I'm going somewhere Delaney don't worry so as our sense nostalgic when you're going back and reaching into those old archives of movies you're like wow that's neat but think about if you can go all the way back to the mind of God and see God in his thinking he's going to role play this and he's going to do this and he's going to do this he wants to be a savior he wants to be a Healer he knows he's going to have an offspring he's going to do this and the whole time you're there you're right there in his thoughts he chose you in him right there and then when all this before he blew the Stars solar system off his hands you were in his thinking and that's why you're here tonight it's not a mistake that you're here it's not a mistake that you're born into a family that believes the message it's not a mistake you know that you forsook the things of the world it's because you were a thought in the back part of God's mind and notice now let's go to the election this election and I'm not getting very far tonight am I I could bar from brother Tim but I dare I better not I'll just stop here shortly Lake uh election let's go here Romans 9 verse 11. for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand now we've already solidified and we'll go a little bit further here with that the purpose of God was Genesis 1 26 to bring forth of his kind uh this word election means the act of God's Free Will by which before the foundation of the world he decreed His blessings to certain persons the act of picking out now I know I use this analogy a lot but I was a little short fat kid that was cute but I was short and fat you know you ever seen the little little pug dog all the little roles don't look at me like that Philip I don't you need I don't need you looking at me like that thinking I'm all cute so you got all these little rows that was me I was a little fat cute kid right but I remember lining up dodgeball I'm going somewhere dodgeball I was the last one picked short fat short fat people ain't quick it's kind of like a counting method last one first out that's the lifo method okay just for y'all counting nerds so I'm the last one to get picked I'm the first one to get out because that dodgeball is coming and you know what a little short fat joke just don't move quick enough but you know thankfully God don't choose US based on our abilities God doesn't choose US based on our skill set he doesn't choose US based on the lack of our skills he doesn't choose US based on how fit or unfit we are how intelligent or unintelligent we are how socially awkward because some of us are socially awkward or unawkward we are God doesn't choose US based on those things he doesn't look at man the way we look at man see God chooses US based on election not man's election not Mama's election preachers Daddy's election but God's election so we find that this election was done before the foundation of the world not when you gave your heart to the Lord it was already predetermined he was already chosen in God but before the foundation of the world now notice now God deposited in your heart when you were chosen in God God deposited right there a desire in your heart to serve him and he put his decreed blessings on your life so I say that to say this when you tried to run when you tried to run you could only run so far because elections said that's enough come on somebody I know this may not be just a fiery message tonight but think about your election when you tried to run brother Philip you could only run so far but all of a sudden election allows you to see a water tower that broke that Amnesia off your life and you came to yourself and now look at you see election says your mind election says goodness and mercy is on your Trail no matter how far you go when you tried to quit when you tried to walk away election kept you election when let you walk away because you don't belong to yourself you belong to God notice when you're seeing coverage your life and it appeared that you wouldn't that you were never going to be able to serve God you would never stop your drinking and stop your smoking and stop all those ungodly things and committed all those ungodly acts elections said that you will not continue another day doing those things do you understand what I'm telling you it's not you quit those things election came to you and you recognize I am a seed and therefore those things started falling off of your life and you couldn't do them anymore because elections said it's over I'll say praise God because I'm a witness I understand when I gave my heart to the Lord the very next morning my language changed election said you're not going to talk like that anymore you're not going to walk like that anymore you're not going to act like that anymore you're not going to drink like that anymore you're not going to go to parties like that anymore it was not my election it was God's choosing I wasn't in the message yet but yet the message was already in me because why because I was chosen in God and so are you through election I sell praise God today and because we are the elected seeds of God's Sons and Daughters we have a purpose to fulfill and it ain't to fill your own worldly desires but it is to fulfill let us make man in our image and let them come forth let them be fruitful let them replenish let them multiply so notice his election is based on his foreknowledge of you so last time I spoke I think I I spoke about we were talking about election and foreknowledge and predestination but I want you to think because you were in the mind of God and we're all free moral ages how many of your free moral agencies so you have a right to choose right but if you were already chosen in him guess what you're going to choose come on somebody I'm trying to get you excited if you was already chosen in him you can't help but to choose to serve God because he's already decreed through election that you will serve him therefore it's not your choice that predestinates you it's his choosing in Ephesians 1 4 because he decreed that I'm going to have a Genesis 1 26 and because of that you are already coming forth and he's already predetermined your future hey I was just happy happy myself man think about it no matter what I'm facing on this side of Eternity God's already decree God already knows no matter if I get sick no matter if I meant to brink of death no matter if the thoughts are coming in my mind God's already decreed me I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God there ain't enough demons in Hell there ain't enough things on this Earth that can break that power because my God has already put his word on it oh church I can't help you can't help why I say why tonight did you choose to serve God because God chose you notice here in Romans 8 and we'll start bringing this down here shortly I get into this and I start having fun but I dread it before again because I'm I'm not really a teacher but I'm just enjoying myself so much notice Roman 8 28 and we know how many knows this that all things work together to the good of them love God why is that think about why does all things work together to the gift of them that love Lord because you were chosen in him so he's going to make everything work towards your good you mean this heartache yep the worst pain I ever felt in my life God use it for my good the worst pain I ever went through at the brink of suicide the worst thing I ever faced in life he used it to get me where I'm at today he used it to get you where you are today because you wasn't the person you were today you wasn't that person five six years ago so God knows exactly what to allow his seed to go through to break that shell off so that life can come out so all things work together for the good and then the love God to them that are called and that word called there means divinely selected and appointed Hallelujah divinely selected and appointed according to his purpose not your purpose but it's his purpose there again we're going back to Genesis 1 what is that purpose to be a son and daughter of God for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so let's look at the last state of this individual this word glorified so we find those that He divinely selected and appointed so where was that at that was it that was in the back part of his mind before you was a thought in a glimmer or a winking Mom and Daddy's eye way long before that before there was a any kind of Earth any kind of solar system way back there divinely selected what did he do he justified you he called you he justified you therefore he pronounced you just and righteous no sin on my bride no marks on my bride Nothing's Gonna Mar my bride she's perfect within and without but notice in those that he justified he also glorified and that word glorify means to praise now God is coming back here in Ephesians we saw God in Genesis 1 when he blessed his creation he stepped back and he adored what he created then we come in here and we find in Romans not Ephesians but Romans here Romans 8 and verse 30 that he's also he's also glorified it means he's stepping back and he's magnifying her and he's celebrating her and he's given honor to her and he's he makes her glorious and he clothes her with Splendor and he renders it excellent to render illustrious think about it those that He predestinated those that He divinely selected those that he made righteous are made just those he's stepping back and he's like now this is my bride glorious within and without a rage not in her splendor but in his Splendor because it's his character that's flowing out through her so we find we have nothing to fear church we don't have anything to fear nothing to worry about because we have been divinely appointed divinely selected and we've been made righteous not by our own will but by the will of God and to be fine here in John 15 and verse 16. and let me get to a place where I can yeah we'll get to right there and then we'll stop for the night so we find here John 15 and 16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and when you go to bed tonight just think man I'm chosen of God you know a lot of times we get it mixed up because I used to think man I gave my heart to Lord I made my choice you know that's that Baptist terminal I made my choice what choice did you make served Lord no no man seeketh after God no not one but we find here you have not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you now this choosing means to pick out of all the people that he could have chose he chose you are chosen of God you're elected of God you're called to God you're anointed of God even when you make mistakes and you miserably fail you're chosen even when you don't feel like you're loved you're chosen notice even when it doesn't appear that he's nowhere around in your prayer life just doesn't flourish and it doesn't seem to get through Pastor roof you're still chosen see when you don't see God feel God hear God you're still chosen those are just circumstances it doesn't hinder God you're still chosen when he seems distant and far you're still chosen even in your UPS and your Downs in those night Seasons lonely moments it feels like you don't have a friend in the world you're still chosen if you don't get anything out of this message tonight I want you to get your chosen and we ain't talking about the TV series we're talking about eternally chosen in him before the foundation of the world you think about all this and brother bam goes he says God saw your character God saw your nature God saw all your ups and downs God saw everything notice he said he loved you he loved you before there was a world he knows your nature brother l he knowed your weaknesses young boys he knows your weaknesses he knows your habits see he knows all about you what he was going to be and what he was going to do and he looked all over this great universe and he says I Choose You my why because you were already chosen in him musicians come back see nothing that we had to do to earn his choosing we were already into Eternal thoughts of God and what did he do he slipped on your finger the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace and you said I do and when you accepted you received him gave he the power to become sons of God you always was a son and we'll get into that next time Lord willing if I had another hour I would go into it but I got a long road trip and you guys have been preached to for a long time last weekend and the weekend before so we're gonna we're gonna go easy but I want you to understand tonight you're chosen in him and you can't be unchosen God don't choose you one minute to unchoose you the next how many of you ever played that little flower petal game she loves me she loves me not she loves me she loves when I used to do that little fat boy had to do something try to find a girlfriend she loves me like that girl don't love me she looked at me much less loved me she looked at me she looked at me now that's one more like it she hate me she hate me not but God doesn't do that with us God chose you and he will not unchoose you you are elected predetermined to be there predestinated God knew you and everything that he has done has been for us because what is the bride the manifestation of this hour the manifestation you little bride are the manifestation of this hour you are the manifestation of eleven hundred plus sermons you are the manifestation not Jeffersonville not vgr voice of God Recordings but you are the manifestation God's coming for a bride a thought that he has and those thoughts they're glorious they're eternal so no matter what you're going through today just if you will just Place something brother Mike I'm gonna let you have it here in just a second so he chose you and he ordained you and that word ordained means he established your setting he established you he established your life to bring forth fruit young people he allowed you to be birthed into the family that would believe this message some of you maybe you didn't have that opportunity to be birthed in it but yet it come across your path brother James self different ones here brother Johnny for the EJ wow you weren't born into the message but there was a seed that was planted the message was always in you so I went 20-something years some of you went longer some of you didn't go so long but all of a sudden the word the word came across the word the seed but yet God ordained it the entire time because we were chosen to him notice he placed you in a position you are special to occupy that seat I promise you Elvis Presley will give his Fleet of Cadillacs back to sit right there tonight Marilyn Monroe would give away all her Fame all her makeup all her popularity all her money to be able to hear a message like this tonight she would give everything to Noah I'm chosen in him and it ain't temporal it's eternal and you are chosen in him in this word will continue to bring forth of his kind brother Mike God
