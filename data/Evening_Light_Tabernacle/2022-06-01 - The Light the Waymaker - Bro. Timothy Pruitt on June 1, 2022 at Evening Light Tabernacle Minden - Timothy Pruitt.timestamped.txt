[37:05] our mouths and our hearts and our ears

[39:02] you're going to do
[39:04] we ask these things in jesus name
[39:07] amen
[39:09] amen
[39:11] amen you can turn to psalms chapter 119
[39:15] and 105
[39:17] and also isaiah 43
[39:20] and verse 16.
[39:28] says
[39:30] thy word is a lamp
[39:32] unto my feet
[39:34] and the light unto my path
[39:37] amen his word is
[39:39] not our feelings not our ideas not what
[39:42] we think or what we believe it's his
[39:44] word
[39:45] is the light amen also isaiah 43 and
[39:48] verse 16 says thus saith the lord
[39:52] which maketh away
[39:54] in the sea
[39:55] and a path
[39:56] in the mighty waters
[39:58] amen we'll let you be seated
[40:04] last time i was
[40:05] in this place i spoke on the light has
[40:07] brought you to where you are and tonight
[40:11] i would like to speak to you on the
[40:12] light
[40:13] the waymaker
[40:15] amen the light the waymaker
[40:18] you know uh
[40:19] brother branham would say in this
[40:21] sumerian church age he says cloudy skies
[40:24] and storms of life
[40:26] are no signs of god's disapproval
[40:29] neither are bright skies and still
[40:31] waters
[40:32] signs of his love and approval
[40:35] his approval of any of us is only in the
[40:38] beloved
[40:40] his love is elective which he had before
[40:42] us before the foundation of the world
[40:44] does he love us oh yes
[40:47] but how shall we know we shall know
[40:49] because he said so
[40:52] amen and manifested that he did love us
[40:55] for he brought us to himself and gave us
[40:58] of his spirit placing us as sons and how
[41:01] shall i prove my love to him by
[41:04] believing what he said
[41:06] and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[41:09] the trials that he and his wisdom allows
[41:13] to come to pass
[41:15] amen so where we find his approval in
[41:17] our life you know many people are
[41:19] looking are desiring the will of god and
[41:22] and you know they're wanting to know if
[41:24] it's his will to do many things in their
[41:26] lives and that's a wonderful thing is to
[41:28] be in the will of god we always want to
[41:30] be in the will of god but the will of
[41:32] god is not our notions or our feelings
[41:35] or what we think or or what we we think
[41:38] think is right the will of god is his
[41:40] word
[41:41] and and if you're not in his word and
[41:44] what you're doing is not in his word
[41:45] well then it's not in the will of god
[41:47] amen but god has has a will and he has a
[41:50] way and he has a place that you can go
[41:53] to and you can pull from and and you can
[41:55] lean on and i'm thankful that we have
[41:57] this word in our this hour that we're
[41:59] living and and i'm thankful that we're
[42:01] not dealing with just a halfway truth or
[42:04] our halfway open book or maybe looking
[42:06] at a few scriptures but today we can say
[42:08] the book has been open and therefore we
[42:11] can see his will for the time that we're
[42:13] living in and we can see the things that
[42:16] amen that are going on daily amen is his
[42:19] will you know no matter how much we fuss
[42:21] about it and and want to uh get upset
[42:23] about it where we're at today the
[42:25] climate that we're in the political
[42:27] climate that we're in all the things
[42:29] around us has to be his will or it
[42:32] couldn't be coming to pass amen this is
[42:34] because it's in the word because this
[42:36] world has got to get an atmosphere for a
[42:40] burning it's got to get in a place a
[42:42] climate to burn amen because it's there
[42:45] in the word amen as this world would
[42:47] burn with fire amen so we know that when
[42:50] you go through things in life that does
[42:52] as we've read there's this gives us such
[42:54] courage to know maybe tonight you're in
[42:56] a great trial and you're going to see
[42:58] cloudy skies all around and and storms
[43:00] that are all around but that's not
[43:02] necessarily meaning god's disapproving
[43:05] your life amen but or maybe tonight you
[43:07] came and has been blue sky skies for a
[43:09] month or whatever has been going on
[43:11] that's not necessarily his signs of his
[43:14] love but where you want to find
[43:16] what his will is or who he is is in his
[43:19] word and we and we believe it because he
[43:22] said so he said he loved us he said he's
[43:26] he's made a way he says that he can do
[43:28] these things he said he's the same
[43:31] yesterday today and forever so it's all
[43:33] in his word and that's where we go to
[43:35] amen so when we get into trial when we
[43:38] get in a situation in our lives we can
[43:40] still have joy in the moment we can
[43:42] still have peace in the moment we can
[43:44] still have amen things in our lives can
[43:47] still be a solid a rock to stand on
[43:50] because we're not standing upon our
[43:52] feelings
[43:53] because you know our feelings will
[43:54] deceive us amen amen in good times our
[43:57] feelings are many times good and we're
[43:59] on the top of the clouds and
[44:01] everything's fine and hunky dory and we
[44:03] get in a cloudy moment and we get all
[44:05] worried and all fretted if we was we if
[44:07] we were if our foundation was upon our
[44:10] feelings where would we be why it'd be
[44:12] different one day to another one moment
[44:14] to another one minute to another it
[44:16] would be different but thank god his
[44:18] word never changes and this is where he
[44:21] says we have to place our confidence is
[44:24] not in our thinking not who we are not
[44:26] what we we think is right but in his
[44:28] word amen and when we go through the
[44:31] trials we can lean upon his word we know
[44:33] in his word it says there has no
[44:35] temptation taken you such is common to
[44:38] man but god is faithful
[44:42] hallelujah who will not suffer you to be
[44:45] tempted above that you're able but will
[44:48] with the temptation make a way of escape
[44:52] amen that ye may be able to bear it amen
[44:55] i'm thankful for that scripture tonight
[44:58] that when i get in the middle of a trial
[44:59] i know it's not too much because god is
[45:02] faithful amen god is faithful he's
[45:04] faithful at all times amen you know we
[45:06] see his faithfulness when we re we
[45:08] witness healing and we witness a miracle
[45:11] and we say well god is faithful god is
[45:13] faithful every day of your life it
[45:16] doesn't matter if you're in the cloudy
[45:17] times in the dark times and bitter times
[45:20] and hard moments of your life god is
[45:23] faithful and god will not allow you to
[45:26] be tempted or to bear more than you're
[45:29] able but he will make a way of escape it
[45:31] might be right at the last moment it
[45:34] might be when you seem like you can't
[45:35] take another step but his word says he's
[45:38] going to make a way
[45:40] he's going to make a way of escape now
[45:42] you know in in the past there's always
[45:44] there's a right way and a wrong way you
[45:47] know and so when we make choices we can
[45:49] look at it it can be your way it can be
[45:52] my way and when we do that it's the
[45:54] wrong way
[45:56] come on now god's way is always the
[45:59] right way
[46:01] ain't no ifs ands or buts his way is
[46:03] always the right way it might not be the
[46:05] way we would like it might not be our
[46:07] favorite choice as far as what we can
[46:09] see and many times his way leads to some
[46:12] dark places and things you don't know
[46:14] how it's going to work work out but
[46:16] god's way is always the right way no
[46:19] matter how unright it seems to us no
[46:22] matter how hopeless god's ways are true
[46:25] they're past understanding god's working
[46:27] in mysterious ways his wonders to before
[46:31] but god will bring you to the place that
[46:33] he has ordained you if you will walk his
[46:36] way and it's not an easy way as we heard
[46:39] sunday it's a hard way it's a hard
[46:41] choice that you have to make sometimes
[46:43] in your life you don't know amen what's
[46:45] going to happen how it's all going to
[46:46] work out but if god has put something
[46:49] inside of you and it matches his word
[46:52] amen then you are on the right path
[46:55] and it will lead to the right
[46:56] destination but there's two ways a man
[46:59] can go and that's his way or god's way
[47:02] that's the right way or the wrong way
[47:05] our way is always the wrong way god's
[47:07] way is always the right way
[47:10] and you can't be in your own way and in
[47:12] god's way at the same time
[47:15] it's two opposite directions amen but
[47:17] god has a way he has a provided way you
[47:21] know in the garden of eden as we as we
[47:23] get into this amen god made a man so
[47:26] brother brown would call it that he
[47:27] didn't have to shift for nothing or he
[47:29] didn't have to work he didn't have to he
[47:31] didn't have to work by his hands and
[47:33] toil in the fields and he could just
[47:35] speak the word and it would take place
[47:37] he could speak things into existence he
[47:40] had the power of the spoken word
[47:42] and he had that what a what a place to
[47:44] be but he said see man is always trying
[47:47] to tamper with what god has done
[47:50] he's always wanted to try to maybe find
[47:52] a better way and we find that that we're
[47:55] not going to get into all of the details
[47:56] but we find man false what does he do he
[47:59] doesn't wait for god to make him a
[48:01] religion he makes his own religion
[48:04] that's when the first religious spirit
[48:06] entered in and he began to make his own
[48:08] way and he began to try to build his own
[48:10] uh his own covering and out of fig
[48:13] leaves and do everything how he had to
[48:15] do it how he wanted to do it see he's
[48:17] always trying to make himself something
[48:20] instead of waiting on god he said but
[48:23] god had made him one and we find out
[48:26] that when his religion wouldn't work god
[48:28] came down in the garden in the cool of
[48:30] the evening amen the light came and made
[48:33] a way
[48:35] amen it made a way it killed a lamb and
[48:37] it brought a provided way of sacrifice
[48:40] that that man could come to god again
[48:43] amen the light made a way when fig
[48:45] leaves couldn't make a way man's creeds
[48:48] couldn't make a way man's ideas couldn't
[48:50] make a way the light made a way
[48:54] amen there's been many people that's
[48:56] come down into the world road and they
[48:58] realized their little shallow religion
[49:00] and things that they thought were right
[49:02] and things they kept amen as their own
[49:04] little personal things they found out it
[49:07] didn't work no more amen nothing short
[49:10] of being born again will ever work
[49:14] amen there's no man-made thing in this
[49:16] day that's going to keep us alive
[49:18] [Music]
[49:20] this world's headed towards nuclear
[49:22] destruction it's prophesied in the bible
[49:25] it's not something i'm saying it's
[49:27] something that's been prophesied
[49:28] hundreds and even thousands years ago
[49:31] but it's laying there and it shall come
[49:33] to pass and we see it day after day more
[49:36] and more is being talked about it more
[49:38] and more is being pushed more and more
[49:40] is going out there and they're training
[49:42] now they're putting it back out and
[49:43] they're showing their missiles and
[49:44] they're they're showing everything that
[49:46] they got
[49:48] amen you know
[49:50] russia comes out and they do a parade
[49:52] amen next thing you know the abc news
[49:54] flies a woman out on a helicopter and
[49:56] she goes drops off on a submarine out
[49:58] there in the middle of the ocean and
[50:00] they show her all the nuclear warheads
[50:02] they got
[50:03] this world is going towards destruction
[50:06] and there's nothing manmade that's going
[50:09] to get you out of it
[50:11] it couldn't get adam and eve out of it
[50:13] in the beginning and nothing man-made
[50:15] will get you out of it now the only
[50:18] thing that will get you out of here is
[50:20] being born by the same light of god that
[50:23] fell on the day of pentecost a 120
[50:26] people in the upper room and they came
[50:28] out amen is drunk men and moved by the
[50:31] spirit of god you will have to have that
[50:33] same light to live and live throughout
[50:37] eternity there's nothing no other way
[50:39] you can't make it no other way
[50:41] you can try you can read your bible you
[50:43] can quote the quotes you can live the
[50:45] perfect lives you can do whatever you
[50:47] want to but unless you have been born
[50:49] again by the spirit of god you don't
[50:52] have a way out of here
[50:56] amen
[50:57] but you know you have to die to be born
[51:00] again but then you move on to cain he
[51:02] tried to make his own way
[51:05] you know he had some apples and some
[51:06] pears and peaches and some pumpkins and
[51:09] things he laid up on the altar and said
[51:11] wow here's a good place i built an altar
[51:13] i have a church i've been a good church
[51:14] member i go to church every day i built
[51:17] it i put a sacrifice now i'm going to
[51:19] kneel and play now lord i want you to
[51:21] receive me but god refused him
[51:24] what was it was the same old religious
[51:26] spirit lives right now today just as
[51:29] religious as it can be but knows no more
[51:31] about god than anything else he said you
[51:34] know that's the truth religious spirits
[51:38] religious spirits the bible said those
[51:40] two spirits would be so close
[51:44] but it would deceive the very elect
[51:47] if it was possible
[51:50] and the only reason why it ain't
[51:52] possible because he put it there
[51:57] and says it's not possible
[52:00] amen but my light will shine greater
[52:04] my light will shine brighter my light
[52:06] will give them a path to walk down
[52:09] my my light not their feelings not their
[52:12] thoughts but my
[52:16] light we find out that judas iscariot
[52:20] went out and rejoiced he preached the
[52:22] gospel
[52:23] came back hollering shouting having a
[52:25] big time with the rest of the disciples
[52:28] he baptized he cast out devils he done
[52:31] it all
[52:34] saint matthew the 10th chapter says that
[52:36] and he followed the disciples right
[52:37] along yet the incarnated devil
[52:41] and come right along and jesus was the
[52:43] incarnated god cain and abel judas and
[52:46] jesus
[52:48] amen the right and the wrong way but he
[52:50] came up to his time at pentecost and he
[52:53] showed his true colors
[52:55] he said when you go to talking about
[52:57] being born again receiving the baptism
[52:59] the holy ghost nine times out of ten
[53:01] them spirits will begin to show their
[53:03] colors and say well that's just a bunch
[53:05] of fanaticism i just leave it that's the
[53:07] wrong way brother that's god's provided
[53:10] way for every man woman boy and child
[53:13] today
[53:18] god has always made a provided way
[53:20] he's under obligation to make a way
[53:23] so if he says you have to have the holy
[53:25] ghost he has to have a make a way that
[53:27] you can receive the holy ghost
[53:29] if he says in his word he's a healer
[53:32] then he has to make a way amen that you
[53:34] can be healed
[53:36] hallelujah if he says in his word he's a
[53:38] deliverer he has to make a way for you
[53:41] to be able to be delivered or otherwise
[53:43] amen his word is it just comes from void
[53:45] and no it has no power to it amen but he
[53:48] will watch over his word and he will
[53:51] bring it to pass
[53:53] and he will make a pathway where there
[53:55] seems to be no way he'll open doors
[53:57] he'll do whatever he'll get you in the
[53:59] right atmosphere you know i think about
[54:01] how even little seeds put in the ground
[54:04] and he had put he'd put in his word
[54:06] every seed shall multiply and and so
[54:08] that he had to make a way for that to
[54:10] happen or his word would fall short amen
[54:13] so he puts the seed in the ground and he
[54:15] puts the right out soil there he puts
[54:17] the right atmosphere the sun begins to
[54:19] shine the waters fall upon it what is it
[54:22] it's making a way for that seed to come
[54:24] up
[54:26] amen so his word will not fall forth
[54:29] listen every time you see a blade of
[54:31] grass come out of the ground that's
[54:33] god's word being fulfilled
[54:36] amen when you see the the things of
[54:39] nature taking place that is god's word
[54:42] being fulfilled and i think about that
[54:44] if he had promises in his word amen of
[54:47] the laodicean believers and he promised
[54:50] there were seeds laying down there he
[54:52] would have to make a way for them to
[54:54] come up he would have to create the
[54:56] right atmosphere he would have to have
[54:58] the right minerals and the right dirt
[55:00] and the right things amen so that word
[55:03] could be fulfilled
[55:05] and so that seed and laodicea and all
[55:07] down to the dark ages every church age
[55:10] had a promise
[55:12] to him that overcometh
[55:15] to him that overcometh so that for him
[55:18] to say that he had to make a way for
[55:20] someone to overcome
[55:24] this age will not be without an
[55:27] overcomer
[55:29] there will be a people that overcomes
[55:31] why his word says there will be
[55:37] god always makes a provided way god's
[55:39] under obligation
[55:41] he's tied himself to his word
[55:44] he's a waymaker
[55:46] but man goes to messing with nature and
[55:48] they cut down the timbers and they do
[55:50] this and they do that
[55:51] and it causes issues in nature
[55:54] and they want to call it acts of god
[55:58] it was actually acts of men
[56:01] you know i was just some time ago we me
[56:04] and brother tim got to visit the area
[56:06] again just a few weeks ago they're in
[56:09] banff but me and my wife was up there
[56:11] for a 15th anniversary
[56:13] and uh we was on a boat on a lake
[56:16] and on one side the lake was this forest
[56:19] that had been burnt and there was trees
[56:21] laying down and but you could see the
[56:22] young growth coming out and on this side
[56:24] on the other side of the lake was this
[56:26] beautiful hundred and year or thousand
[56:28] who knows how oh just uh uh virgin
[56:31] timber standing there and the great
[56:33] beauty and his great things and and the
[56:35] man says you know he said this is
[56:37] amazing he said as we go down this lake
[56:39] he said i want to point out something he
[56:40] said how where do you think there's life
[56:44] he said where do you think there's life
[56:46] and people were pointing over these
[56:47] beautiful trees and and said there's got
[56:49] to be life he said actually he said 95
[56:52] to 97
[56:54] of the bears and the deer and the life
[56:56] are over there where it's been burnt
[56:59] and it's been he said because that is
[57:01] how nature does it replenishes itself by
[57:03] fire and fire comes down by lightning or
[57:06] or something takes place to cause it to
[57:08] ignite it and it burns down to a valley
[57:10] he said the reason why this side hasn't
[57:12] burned he said because men watch over it
[57:15] and they put every fire they can out he
[57:17] said because right up the end of that is
[57:19] a man-made village called banff and if
[57:21] that hill burns bounce gonna burn
[57:24] he said but the live the life is over
[57:27] there where the fire had burns
[57:32] man i might have me a shout and spit
[57:34] spell right there on that boat i said
[57:35] i'm going to trump this thing over if
[57:37] y'all ain't careful because i can see
[57:39] amen people that have built pines they
[57:41] places and they've got amen they look
[57:43] like fine trees and they look like this
[57:45] amen but they have not allowed the
[57:47] spirit of god the waymaker to come into
[57:50] their church
[57:51] they mean to burn out the old creeds and
[57:53] the old dolphins and all the things and
[57:55] over here there's life popping
[57:57] [Applause]
[57:58] amen there's life and it's giving birth
[58:00] and things are taking place meanwhile
[58:02] amen people are worried about their
[58:04] structures and they're worried about
[58:06] their things that they have built and
[58:07] they're worried about their own kingdoms
[58:09] being burnt down i want the waymaker
[58:13] i want him to come and do what he has to
[58:16] do so life can come to the body
[58:22] but you interfere with nature
[58:25] and floods begin to happen
[58:28] and they build up dams
[58:30] you know they remember that tim just
[58:32] spent a time on a was a was a river at
[58:35] one time now they've dammed it up in
[58:36] about three different places
[58:38] 100 mile lakes
[58:40] places that when he was out on the boat
[58:42] the guy says you actually have had the
[58:44] right sonar equipment you can see
[58:45] villages that they actually uh drive
[58:48] put underwater
[58:50] under there when they when they flooded
[58:52] this and some places in this lake are
[58:54] over a thousand foot deep
[58:57] he said but the problem is this year
[58:59] we've had a lot of rain this year we've
[59:02] had a lot of snow and just he said up on
[59:04] the mountains about 30 to 40 foot of
[59:06] snow he said i've actually been up there
[59:08] he said they got these little gps things
[59:10] i'm on my my snowmobile or on my skis
[59:13] whatever he said i'll mark he said it
[59:15] looks like that tree's about that little
[59:17] tree coming out of the snow about that
[59:18] tall he said i'll mark it with my gps
[59:21] and i'll go back a little later when the
[59:22] snow is melted and that thing i was
[59:24] actually up that tree about 40 to 50
[59:26] foot
[59:28] i said us boys in the south don't know
[59:30] anything about that
[59:31] thank god he said but the problem is we
[59:34] put these dams here and he said the
[59:36] melt's about to happen and now all the
[59:38] rain that we've had he said flooding is
[59:40] about to take place
[59:41] amen what is the insurance going to call
[59:43] it an act of god no it was the act of
[59:46] men
[59:47] amen messing with nature messing with
[59:50] the creation of god amen and you know i
[59:52] see how god
[59:54] has built his church and he's built it
[59:56] in a certain way he wants it a certain
[59:58] way but men come and they put dams there
[1:00:01] they put their own ideas there they
[1:00:03] build camps there amen that's not what
[1:00:05] god wants he wants the water to fro
[1:00:08] freely amen not damn it up not try to
[1:00:11] hold it back but let the spirit of god
[1:00:13] the waymaker find his way down through
[1:00:15] every crevice down through every part if
[1:00:17] he wants to take a right turn let him
[1:00:19] take a right turn he is the leader
[1:00:22] he is the god i think about the children
[1:00:24] of israel they came out of egypt no
[1:00:26] wonder they got a little confused they
[1:00:28] know the red sea was right over there
[1:00:30] pharaoh knew the red sea was right over
[1:00:32] there but god said i'm gonna go this way
[1:00:34] and i'm gonna go that way and i'm gonna
[1:00:36] go this way because i want pharaoh to
[1:00:38] say hey they're lost
[1:00:40] they're entangled in the wilderness he
[1:00:42] said i'm gonna do this i want you to
[1:00:45] walk with me and moses i want you to
[1:00:47] walk with me children of israel because
[1:00:49] i'm setting a trap for your enemy
[1:00:52] i'm setting a trap so i can have my full
[1:00:56] amen my full
[1:00:58] of victory over pharaoh and his army
[1:01:01] listen laodicea has been built in a
[1:01:04] certain way god has went certain paths
[1:01:06] listen we didn't think we'd go this far
[1:01:08] for 50 or 60 years past the prophet but
[1:01:11] we are still following the light
[1:01:14] and the light is setting satan up
[1:01:19] hallelujah he's the waymaker he's making
[1:01:22] a way for you but he's making a
[1:01:24] destruction for your enemy amen he's
[1:01:27] going to bring them to their death yes
[1:01:33] my god
[1:01:34] i'm i don't know about you but i'm
[1:01:36] getting excited
[1:01:39] amen because i'm seeing a little
[1:01:40] glimmering glistening and going on over
[1:01:43] there
[1:01:44] what's that i see over there i smell
[1:01:47] water
[1:01:49] we've been in this wilderness we've been
[1:01:50] walking out of egypt we've come out of
[1:01:52] egypt a long time ago but here we are
[1:01:54] and it's time to cross over
[1:01:58] it's time to move over into another
[1:02:00] place and god's been making the way the
[1:02:02] whole time the light led them though you
[1:02:05] read in the scripture the pillar of fire
[1:02:07] led them out of egypt it led them
[1:02:10] through the wilderness it led them to
[1:02:11] the red sea it led them through the red
[1:02:14] sea it led them tomorrow they meant to
[1:02:16] bitter waters it led them to a place
[1:02:19] that had nothing to drink nothing to eat
[1:02:21] but it led them to a rock and led them
[1:02:23] to quail and led them to oasis it led
[1:02:26] them and led them and led them and led
[1:02:29] them they complained they fussed they
[1:02:30] made they said well we got a better way
[1:02:32] we got a shortcut hey there they but
[1:02:34] they had to follow the light if they was
[1:02:36] ever going to make it to the promised
[1:02:38] land
[1:02:41] and they were joshua and caleb were
[1:02:44] still there as they got ready to go over
[1:02:46] the jordan oh my
[1:02:49] 40 years ago we could have had it 40
[1:02:51] years we was here but here we are again
[1:02:53] and i'm ready to mush to push across i'm
[1:02:56] ready to go to the other side and joshua
[1:03:00] goes over there to try to search it out
[1:03:02] and what happened a light began to form
[1:03:06] i would say it was an amber light
[1:03:08] it began to come down and move in those
[1:03:10] trees and out of that light stepped a
[1:03:12] man it was about six foot tall olive
[1:03:15] compact complexion with a sword in his
[1:03:17] hand
[1:03:21] the light had led him to this moment and
[1:03:24] led him to this place had led him right
[1:03:27] here where he was
[1:03:36] you know it's pretty amazing you preach
[1:03:38] something one night next day you get up
[1:03:41] and you live it
[1:03:43] quite amazing
[1:03:45] last wednesday our priest the priest on
[1:03:46] the light has brought you to where you
[1:03:48] are
[1:03:49] me and brother tim get on the plane the
[1:03:50] next morning we fly to atlanta we got
[1:03:52] about five hours in atlanta
[1:03:54] so we thought well we're going to the
[1:03:56] delta lounge there it's a little quieter
[1:03:58] we can hook our computers up and
[1:04:00] fellowship and study whatever
[1:04:03] we get off the plane i asked the guy
[1:04:05] where our gate was he said well you're
[1:04:06] in second here and you're in d said you
[1:04:09] got to go down the other end of the d i
[1:04:10] said okay i said where's the lounge he
[1:04:12] said well there's one right across here
[1:04:13] or you can go down there's one down by
[1:04:14] your gate
[1:04:16] i said well we've been on the plane
[1:04:17] remember tim decided to walk we walked
[1:04:19] down to the one that was by our gate to
[1:04:21] go out walk in
[1:04:23] we thought that that we could get him
[1:04:25] for free
[1:04:26] we found out we had to pay a little
[1:04:27] money
[1:04:29] and so we discuss it like i i don't know
[1:04:31] if i want to give that and so we walk
[1:04:33] out and we go up go back and say well
[1:04:35] let's go back to the main center of the
[1:04:36] place and find something to eat well by
[1:04:38] the time we got there we said well by
[1:04:39] the time you eat and i eat that's half
[1:04:41] the cost by the time we get a coffee
[1:04:43] later and this that and the other we
[1:04:44] might as well just go into the lounge so
[1:04:46] we go back to the original gate that we
[1:04:48] flew out of
[1:04:50] and we go in and we paid our i think it
[1:04:52] was like 39 bucks a person we walk in
[1:04:54] and i walk around the corner and i'm
[1:04:56] looking for a seat for both of us and
[1:04:57] i'm i'm eyeballing where's the good seat
[1:04:59] and i look back and brother tim's not
[1:05:01] behind me and i i look at him he's
[1:05:04] talking to somebody
[1:05:06] i look he waves me over and i go over
[1:05:08] there to where he was at and look around
[1:05:10] the corner at this little desk there's
[1:05:12] berry coffee sitting there
[1:05:14] the light had led me to where we are
[1:05:17] i thought i was just thinking
[1:05:20] how many times you get up that way
[1:05:21] sometimes you thought well i'm just
[1:05:23] thinking i'm just thinking i'm going to
[1:05:24] do this i'm thinking i'm going to do
[1:05:25] this and meanwhile the light is actually
[1:05:28] leading you
[1:05:29] pulsations are taking place and you're
[1:05:31] moving this way and that way and there
[1:05:33] you are all of a sudden you're standing
[1:05:35] you realize wow if we'd have went down
[1:05:36] there and we'd sat there for five hours
[1:05:38] and we'd never saw him until he got on
[1:05:40] the same plane with us and went the same
[1:05:42] place we were going
[1:05:44] and sat in the seat right behind me
[1:05:47] the light had led us to where we were
[1:05:50] amen god orchestrating things amen you
[1:05:52] can look it in nature you can see it in
[1:05:54] ducks ducks amen are down down into
[1:05:56] south louisiana it gets a little hot and
[1:05:59] muggy and they start heading towards the
[1:06:00] north and they get up in the north and
[1:06:02] they they have their hatchlings i've
[1:06:04] been up there in alaska and it'd be
[1:06:05] thousands on thousands of tops
[1:06:08] just unbelievable almost turned to sky
[1:06:09] black up there in the in the summertime
[1:06:12] as they're they're nesting and they're
[1:06:13] they're having their babies and things
[1:06:15] that and then and they're quacking and
[1:06:17] it's just thousands unbelievable but all
[1:06:20] of a sudden a little snowflake will
[1:06:21] begin to fall and a little temperature
[1:06:23] begin to change and all of a sudden out
[1:06:25] in the middle of that lake a duck will
[1:06:26] start quacking and all of a sudden the
[1:06:28] rest of those ducks will get after them
[1:06:30] and start quacking with them and they'll
[1:06:31] lift up off that pond and they'll begin
[1:06:34] to head back to south and down to
[1:06:36] louisiana and arkansas down to some rice
[1:06:38] field down in the sun down for the
[1:06:40] winter and i thought my ain't that
[1:06:42] amazing that in a dumb duck god could
[1:06:45] put such an intelligence inside of them
[1:06:47] that when the the seasons start changing
[1:06:49] things start happening it's time to
[1:06:51] start getting ready to get out of here
[1:06:54] and i thought if god could put that in a
[1:06:55] duck how much more can he put that in a
[1:06:58] human being when they see seasons
[1:07:00] they're changing times are changing amen
[1:07:02] the world's changing this ain't no place
[1:07:04] fit to live in anymore amen is that what
[1:07:07] is it it starts happening inside of us
[1:07:10] and there's a call coming to another
[1:07:12] land
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:14] and it won't be long as we gather
[1:07:16] together we'll lift up all this place
[1:07:19] and go into eternity
[1:07:22] back where we belong
[1:07:25] but what did that does that the light
[1:07:28] he's the waymaker listen the reason
[1:07:30] you're here tonight god made a way
[1:07:33] the reason you was able to rise above
[1:07:35] the muck pile of the world and the sins
[1:07:37] of this world god made a way the reason
[1:07:40] you didn't take your life at a young age
[1:07:42] or take your life even this week god
[1:07:45] made a way
[1:07:47] the reason you're able to do the things
[1:07:49] that you do and even live the life that
[1:07:51] you live god has made a way
[1:08:01] seems like christians ought to have duck
[1:08:03] sense at least
[1:08:05] it's time to get out of
[1:08:08] here the handwriting's on the wall
[1:08:15] you want to call it male adjust the
[1:08:17] instinct no that's god's provided way
[1:08:21] god give them that way
[1:08:22] to lead them
[1:08:25] but the same god that gave a duck
[1:08:27] the ability to do that is the same god
[1:08:29] that gave men the holy ghost
[1:08:32] makes a way of escape
[1:08:35] and if they reject it and wants his own
[1:08:37] way
[1:08:40] god always sends mercy than judgment
[1:08:45] god always has made a provided way
[1:08:47] sometimes
[1:08:48] it don't lead through pleasant things
[1:08:52] sometimes it goes through hardships
[1:08:56] but it's god's provided way
[1:08:59] god makes it anyhow
[1:09:03] hardships
[1:09:05] the three hebrew children
[1:09:08] very special story to me
[1:09:12] god made a way
[1:09:14] but it was through a fire
[1:09:19] how hard was that
[1:09:21] that wasn't just your easy choice of do
[1:09:23] you want rice krispies or cheerios in
[1:09:25] the morning
[1:09:27] or do you want an egg omelet
[1:09:29] no so you want to bow or you want to
[1:09:31] burn
[1:09:35] it wasn't the choice between a ford and
[1:09:37] a chevrolet
[1:09:39] or what house you would live in or or
[1:09:41] what day you'll leave a certain place no
[1:09:43] it was you're going to bow or you're
[1:09:44] going to burn
[1:09:46] that's a hard choice to make
[1:09:48] and they begin to listen to the threats
[1:09:50] and things and they say well you know
[1:09:52] you can do whatever you want to o king
[1:09:54] you can you can heat it up as hot as you
[1:09:56] want it you can play your music as loud
[1:09:58] as you want it you can do what he would
[1:10:00] want to you can make all your threats
[1:10:02] but as for us we're not bowing to your
[1:10:05] idol
[1:10:06] why would they not bow to the idol
[1:10:08] because it was in the word
[1:10:11] they knew it was god's will for them not
[1:10:13] to bow
[1:10:15] he said you shall have no other god
[1:10:17] before me no don't bow to a craving
[1:10:19] image he had all kinds of things in his
[1:10:21] word and they knew that was in his word
[1:10:26] and so they come to this moment and you
[1:10:28] know i said god give us some more
[1:10:30] shadrach meshach and abednego's
[1:10:33] amen that won't bow the world he is and
[1:10:35] won't bow to dress thing of the world
[1:10:38] won't bow to the hairstyles of the world
[1:10:40] won't bow to the nonsense of the world
[1:10:44] but are willing to go through the fire
[1:10:49] you know people wants the eternity they
[1:10:51] want the
[1:10:52] blessings they want the life and they
[1:10:54] want that but they don't want to pay the
[1:10:56] price
[1:11:03] brother branham would say it like this
[1:11:04] he said we don't have to knuckle down to
[1:11:06] the world
[1:11:09] god has made us free by the holy spirit
[1:11:13] well we can say that king said well you
[1:11:15] know in the morning
[1:11:16] we're going to heat it up
[1:11:18] everybody that don't bow they're going
[1:11:20] to be thrown in the fiery furnace
[1:11:22] they went and prayed
[1:11:24] next day the sound come to battle before
[1:11:26] the image
[1:11:28] and they turn their back to it
[1:11:31] that's my kind of boys
[1:11:33] king says boys did you really do that
[1:11:35] yep we did that
[1:11:37] so we're going to heat it up seven times
[1:11:39] hotter than ever was
[1:11:41] and here they had a gang plank you know
[1:11:43] going out into the fire and they began
[1:11:46] to bind their hands and take them down
[1:11:47] to this place and they look more and
[1:11:50] more and more and more and more hopeless
[1:11:57] it got hotter
[1:11:58] it didn't get easier
[1:12:02] we want it easy that's our way
[1:12:05] we like the easy ways
[1:12:07] we like the easy
[1:12:09] you know
[1:12:11] path that
[1:12:12] it's all puffy phillip pillows and
[1:12:15] and
[1:12:17] marshmallows and stuff
[1:12:19] so if we happen to fall we don't skin
[1:12:21] our knees
[1:12:23] i don't know why we're going all the way
[1:12:25] we're just going
[1:12:27] we like that
[1:12:30] especially laodicea
[1:12:32] the softest age there ever been
[1:12:35] we're the some of the softest people
[1:12:36] there's ever been and we love it soft
[1:12:40] gas prices are going up what am i going
[1:12:42] to do
[1:12:46] bicycle
[1:12:47] i don't know what we're going to have to
[1:12:48] do all i know is he's going to make a
[1:12:51] way
[1:12:54] food prices are going up what am i going
[1:12:56] to do i don't know what we're going to
[1:12:58] have to do all i know is he's going to
[1:12:59] make a way
[1:13:02] you don't think he can create food sure
[1:13:04] he can
[1:13:06] he's done it before and he'll do it
[1:13:08] again
[1:13:10] you say when he do that well i tell you
[1:13:12] when he done it was when a man
[1:13:13] challenged the governments of his day
[1:13:15] and said you know what you have sinned
[1:13:17] you've done wrong ahab and and jezebel
[1:13:20] you've done wrong you've made a mockery
[1:13:23] out of god it'll not rain for three and
[1:13:25] a half years and he turns around and
[1:13:27] walks out and it seemed like wow that
[1:13:29] was an amazing service but then he
[1:13:31] starts going through the try he's in the
[1:13:33] same place
[1:13:35] he ain't sitting somewhere else and
[1:13:37] enjoying the plushness and green grass
[1:13:40] no it's drying up around him too
[1:13:43] but god takes him to a place that has a
[1:13:45] little brook flowing and he sends some
[1:13:48] ravens
[1:13:49] down with some little sandwiches
[1:13:53] hello somebody he knew where elijah was
[1:13:56] he knew where to send him and he knew
[1:13:57] how to equip somebody to get some food
[1:13:59] to him
[1:14:01] and when all that dried up he said get
[1:14:04] up and go down to a little place i got a
[1:14:06] little widow woman that's going to take
[1:14:08] care of you
[1:14:11] god knows how to lead his children he
[1:14:14] knows where to lead you to the next meal
[1:14:16] he knows where to lead you to the next
[1:14:18] dollar whatever you have need of the
[1:14:20] light will lead you
[1:14:25] and it goes down there to that place and
[1:14:27] here she is this little woman's out
[1:14:29] there
[1:14:30] getting her last couple of sticks
[1:14:31] together gonna scrape the last bit out
[1:14:34] of her barrel and pour the last little
[1:14:36] bit out of her old jug and make her one
[1:14:38] last little cake and eat it and die
[1:14:43] she was in the same place it wasn't an
[1:14:45] easy place but the light all of a sudden
[1:14:47] began to shine upon her house
[1:14:50] man i want to be that kind of place
[1:14:52] that the light began to shine upon a
[1:14:54] house amen here the prophet of god comes
[1:14:57] down and says hey will you make me a
[1:14:59] cake
[1:15:02] you make me a cake and you make me you
[1:15:04] you give me a drink
[1:15:08] well what do you mean make you want i
[1:15:10] got a child in here and i got myself to
[1:15:13] fend for we got one last little bit to
[1:15:15] give and this is all we got and we're
[1:15:17] gonna eat it and we're gonna die
[1:15:19] but something began to stir on the
[1:15:21] inside of her
[1:15:22] something began to take place and
[1:15:24] brother adam said it like this he said
[1:15:25] she got her two sticks and she put them
[1:15:28] together and she lit the fire in the
[1:15:30] middle he said that represented the
[1:15:31] cross and she took that meal and that oh
[1:15:34] oh my and she put it all together and
[1:15:37] she put it on that fire and she baked
[1:15:39] her one last cake and she got her one
[1:15:41] last drink and she came and gave it to
[1:15:43] the prophet of god that was an ultimate
[1:15:46] sacrifice
[1:15:48] because now she had nothing
[1:15:55] but the light had other ideas
[1:15:59] and the prophet of god said because you
[1:16:01] have done this
[1:16:03] because you have done this your oil will
[1:16:06] not go dry nor your barrel it will not
[1:16:09] go to it will not be empty until the day
[1:16:12] it rains
[1:16:15] and she would go every day to make
[1:16:18] herself another cake and it didn't have
[1:16:20] nothing in there the day before and she
[1:16:22] would look in and there's some more down
[1:16:24] there
[1:16:25] dig it up and put it and make another
[1:16:27] cake next time she was hungry she'd go
[1:16:30] back knowing she had scraped up the last
[1:16:32] bit was there and she'd reach down and
[1:16:34] just get her another pile full and bring
[1:16:37] it over what was it no matter what day
[1:16:39] she was in it was showing he's the same
[1:16:42] yesterday today and forever he's got
[1:16:44] enough he's more than enough and i tell
[1:16:47] you church of the living god when you
[1:16:49] don't see him working he'll still be
[1:16:51] working
[1:16:53] she didn't know it but over in that mill
[1:16:56] barrel while she was asleep while she
[1:16:58] was at rest the angels of god was
[1:17:01] granted some more meal
[1:17:04] while she was over there the angels of
[1:17:06] god were scoping out some more olive oil
[1:17:09] it was pouring back in her vessel listen
[1:17:11] i tell you what you ought to do it's not
[1:17:13] worried about which way the world's
[1:17:15] going you need to rest in your promises
[1:17:18] rest in them every day and while you're
[1:17:21] resting the angels are working while
[1:17:23] you're resting he's moving on the shed
[1:17:26] while you're resting he's still showing
[1:17:28] he's jehovah jaira
[1:17:33] this light will make a way
[1:17:40] it came down to the last step
[1:17:45] i'm sure that was singing
[1:17:47] it's over
[1:17:51] it's been a wonderful life
[1:17:54] but it was so good to live for him
[1:17:58] and they step off
[1:18:01] throw it into the fire
[1:18:04] meanwhile
[1:18:05] what they didn't know was
[1:18:07] was a conversation was going on in
[1:18:09] heaven
[1:18:11] angels were watching
[1:18:15] the angels in camp
[1:18:17] about those that fear him
[1:18:20] they're on guard
[1:18:22] they know when cancer strikes your body
[1:18:26] you don't have to tell him he already
[1:18:28] knows

[1:19:02] destroy them all

[1:19:08] killed what was a hundred and something
[1:19:10] thousand

[1:19:43] and it takes off those priestly robes
[1:19:46] lays them down
[1:19:48] those royal robes that lays them down
[1:19:51] upon his throne he steps down
[1:19:53] brother branham said he grabbed the east
[1:19:55] wind and the west wind and a zigzag of
[1:19:57] lightning and into the fire he went
[1:20:04] and while they're falling into that
[1:20:05] place all of a sudden they find
[1:20:08] themselves on their feet
[1:20:10] in the middle of a fire
[1:20:12] in the middle of what is very terrifying
[1:20:17] this wasn't your normal little backyard
[1:20:19] pit
[1:20:20] fire

[1:20:23] the men that was even bringing them to
[1:20:25] the fire they couldn't stand the heat
[1:20:29] amen they couldn't stand it and it threw
[1:20:31] them off
[1:20:32] did you see what happened god again was
[1:20:35] leading his enemies to a trap
[1:20:40] they thought they was going to throw
[1:20:42] them to their destruction and it was
[1:20:43] their own destruction
[1:20:46] and here they come and they find amen
[1:20:48] the one that looked like the son of god
[1:20:50] was walking in the fire with him and
[1:20:52] they're in the fire fellowshipping with
[1:20:54] him they're in the fire talking about
[1:20:56] him they're in the fire talking with him
[1:20:58] and they realize their bands have been
[1:21:00] burnt off
[1:21:02] and they come out of there without even
[1:21:04] the smell of smoke on them

[1:21:09] take you through a fire that's burning

[1:21:14] a little fire in here and burn it for
[1:21:16] five minutes how much smoke would be all
[1:21:18] over everything and they come out of
[1:21:20] there without even a smell of it and it
[1:21:22] was all gone

[1:22:36] so i told this up there it may have said
[1:22:38] it here already i don't know but i want
[1:22:39] to say it again

[1:22:45] brother ron's you remember the story my
[1:22:47] ipad started playing
[1:22:49] i started brother brown started talking
[1:22:51] about a hymn
[1:22:52] it was down from his glory every living
[1:22:54] story i didn't pick it all didn't put
[1:22:56] all the pieces together right away but i
[1:22:58] knew i had been preaching on the god
[1:23:00] that answers and i knew he had answered
[1:23:03] when i realized what it was i thought
[1:23:05] well you know what

[1:23:08] of smoke it's over

[1:23:17] go back in the hospitals i'm landing she
[1:23:20] goes back in the hospital she never
[1:23:21] comes out
[1:23:24] and i watched her go from one battle to
[1:23:26] another
[1:23:27] down down down until she left this world
[1:23:31] you don't think the whisper come to me
[1:23:34] like you made all that up
[1:23:38] you made every bit of that up you know
[1:23:39] you did
[1:23:42] i knew that wasn't right
[1:23:44] because i knew i didn't do that
[1:23:48] one day i was thinking about it
[1:23:50] and it was just rolling through my mind
[1:23:52] how it all took place and i'm thinking
[1:23:54] about it like lord why did all that
[1:23:56] happen and then her die
[1:23:58] the lord spoke to me
[1:24:00] and he says i didn't do that for her i
[1:24:04] did that for you
[1:24:09] he said because i wanted you to know
[1:24:11] when you you was about to step in a fire
[1:24:14] but i was going to be with you
[1:24:22] take that devil
[1:24:26] i've been through a fire our family's
[1:24:28] been through a fire this church has been
[1:24:29] through a fire
[1:24:31] we lost somebody we really loved but
[1:24:33] every step of the way he's been with us
[1:24:37] every moment even in our tears and our
[1:24:38] moments of agony and moments of of
[1:24:41] wondering how all this is going to be
[1:24:43] he's been with us
[1:24:45] he's never left us
[1:24:47] he's always sent a comforting word he's
[1:24:49] always done something right on time
[1:24:51] showing time after time after time
[1:24:53] you've been in the fire but i've been
[1:24:55] with you
[1:24:57] do you know how much confidence that
[1:24:58] gives you to know you're not alone in
[1:25:01] the middle of your trial to know you
[1:25:02] know you're in a fire and things are
[1:25:04] going all around you and it seems to be
[1:25:06] crumbling on every side woods popping
[1:25:08] sparks are flying heat's rising but he's
[1:25:11] still with me
[1:25:14] hallelujah and i want to tell you this
[1:25:16] church tonight he's not just with me
[1:25:19] he's with you also
[1:25:22] he's with you in your moments of despair
[1:25:25] he's with you in your moments when you
[1:25:26] don't know which way to turn don't worry
[1:25:29] there'll be a light to guide you to the
[1:25:31] next step to the next place to the next
[1:25:33] way whichever turn you need to take
[1:25:35] he'll be there for you
[1:25:38] he's been there forever saint throughout
[1:25:40] the ages and why would you think you
[1:25:42] would be an exception
[1:25:45] you're not an exception
[1:25:50] there's a provided way
[1:25:52] for men and women that's through jesus
[1:25:54] christ
[1:25:55] who died at calvary
[1:25:58] though his blood
[1:25:59] through his blood we have remission of
[1:26:01] sins
[1:26:02] and can receive the baptism of the holy
[1:26:04] ghost
[1:26:05] the approval of god that he's accepted
[1:26:08] us
[1:26:09] into his son christ jesus
[1:26:11] safely and secure
[1:26:14] god has a way
[1:26:16] and it's the only way
[1:26:19] it ain't the methodist way the baptist
[1:26:21] way the presbyterian way the pentecostal
[1:26:23] way and even the message way
[1:26:27] it's christ's way
[1:26:29] but i want to say this very clearly
[1:26:31] though the message
[1:26:32] in its in his purest form
[1:26:35] is christ
[1:26:40] just as he was through all the other
[1:26:41] ages
[1:26:43] just as he was with wesley and luther
[1:26:45] and everything else but when men start
[1:26:47] to build their dams
[1:26:49] and they start to stop they start
[1:26:51] stopping fires
[1:26:53] they start control burning
[1:26:55] only burn where they want it to burn
[1:26:58] and move where they want it to move and
[1:27:00] how they want it to move
[1:27:02] that ain't christ that's right
[1:27:06] but he is god's way
[1:27:09] he's god's provided sacrifice he's
[1:27:10] jehovah raphae he's jehovah jireh he's
[1:27:13] an over manassas
[1:27:16] when abraham offered up isaac he called
[1:27:18] that place jehovah jiber the lord will
[1:27:20] provide himself a sacrifice god made a
[1:27:23] way of escape
[1:27:25] he did it
[1:27:27] he'll do it through every time we can
[1:27:29] see him as he come down down to the
[1:27:31] moments of of history
[1:27:34] 2 000 years ago it seemed like a nation
[1:27:36] was tumbling the world was tumbling into
[1:27:38] despair and all of a sudden a light came
[1:27:41] on the street
[1:27:42] and there was a little virgin walking
[1:27:44] down the street
[1:27:46] and she's been pondering in her heart to
[1:27:48] things that had been taught
[1:27:50] of a prophecy that had been taken had
[1:27:52] been given
[1:27:53] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:27:55] a son
[1:27:56] and as she's thinking on these things a
[1:27:59] light begins to show itself
[1:28:01] and out of the light a man about six
[1:28:03] foot tall an olives
[1:28:05] complexion with his arms folded
[1:28:08] says
[1:28:09] mary
[1:28:11] the hand's maiden of the lord
[1:28:15] highly favored
[1:28:17] talking about me
[1:28:20] what have i done to be so favored
[1:28:22] we ain't done anything
[1:28:25] but he said we were
[1:28:29] that's all that matters
[1:28:31] you wonder why why did i get so highly
[1:28:33] favored that i could hear the truth of
[1:28:35] this hour and to believe it
[1:28:39] i'll just hear it but to believe it
[1:28:41] and the life of god to come down how did
[1:28:44] i get so highly favored was that because
[1:28:46] i was in a certain family or a certain
[1:28:48] place or certain no
[1:28:50] you're highly favored because he said
[1:28:52] you are
[1:28:56] you're chosen because he said you are
[1:29:00] you're his because he said you are
[1:29:04] and here she is walking down the road he
[1:29:06] begins to speak these things and
[1:29:07] something began to well upon her she
[1:29:10] couldn't understand it she couldn't put
[1:29:11] it all together she didn't have it all
[1:29:12] figured out but she just said be it unto
[1:29:14] me
[1:29:16] according to what you've said i will
[1:29:18] accept it
[1:29:19] i will believe what you said god wants a
[1:29:22] people that'll believe just what he said
[1:29:25] if it's in his word believe it
[1:29:27] if it's for healing believe it if it's
[1:29:29] for deliverance believe it if whatever
[1:29:31] it's in his word you hold on to it
[1:29:36] it doesn't matter how dark it gets
[1:29:38] hold on to it
[1:29:41] yes
[1:29:46] he's a wavemaker
[1:29:48] we can find him there in the bible as he
[1:29:50] would come begin into his ministry and
[1:29:52] we know the story of his friend lazarus
[1:29:55] and he goes on like he's moving away
[1:29:57] from them and she's getting sicker until
[1:29:59] he dies and now he's four dead days dead
[1:30:02] and it seems like an impossible
[1:30:04] situation
[1:30:06] seems like there's no hope anymore
[1:30:10] and he turns back towards them and
[1:30:12] begins to walk for them and and martha
[1:30:15] hears that he's coming
[1:30:17] and she begins to run
[1:30:19] toward jesus
[1:30:21] he said why did she run towards him
[1:30:23] because she knew he was god's provided
[1:30:26] way
[1:30:27] he said that's always what you got to do
[1:30:30] when you've got sorrow in your home go
[1:30:32] meet jesus
[1:30:35] when you got sickness in your home go
[1:30:37] meet jesus you got heartaches in your
[1:30:39] home go meet jesus if you got a need of
[1:30:42] anything go get go meet him he's got the
[1:30:45] remedy for everything he's got the cure
[1:30:48] for everything and she ran to meet him
[1:30:51] and fell down at his feet
[1:30:55] why
[1:30:57] because she had read a story
[1:30:59] of a shunamai woman
[1:31:03] that had lost her son
[1:31:05] and there was no hope
[1:31:07] it was a promise given to her and she
[1:31:10] lost it and there seemed to be no hope
[1:31:13] and what did she do she didn't wallow in
[1:31:15] her misery she saddled her donkey and
[1:31:17] she got on her way to go see the prophet
[1:31:20] and she goes up and she finds him as
[1:31:22] he's walking towards her and she goes
[1:31:23] towards him and he says is it well with
[1:31:25] t and she said all is well
[1:31:28] all is well and she tells him what's
[1:31:30] taking place as he goes back to her
[1:31:32] place and raises the promised son back
[1:31:34] up again why because she believed the
[1:31:37] words that he had spoken and this martha
[1:31:40] had read those words
[1:31:42] she had read it and she knew if he did
[1:31:44] it then he can do it now
[1:31:49] he knew she knew that he had the power
[1:31:51] of the resurrection
[1:31:53] she knew that he was god's provided way
[1:31:56] for the moment
[1:31:58] when it seemed impossible and it seemed
[1:32:00] like there was no hope and it seemed
[1:32:02] like his nose is sunk there and it's
[1:32:04] dirty and smelly in there and he's just
[1:32:07] gone
[1:32:10] if you'd have been here
[1:32:12] he would not have died
[1:32:14] but even now lord
[1:32:19] what you s what you ask
[1:32:21] it shall be done
[1:32:24] even now lord why because she knew he
[1:32:26] was god's provided way
[1:32:28] she knew he was the waymaker when there
[1:32:31] even seemed to be no way
[1:32:35] he said i can see him
[1:32:37] i don't know how brother tim has brought
[1:32:38] this out it just clarified it for me
[1:32:42] as he stood there and he wept
[1:32:45] knowing that he was about to bring him
[1:32:46] from
[1:32:48] a beautiful place
[1:32:50] back to this so filthy life again
[1:32:53] he knew where lazarus was
[1:32:57] but he knew he had to do it
[1:32:59] to prove who he was
[1:33:03] but he weeps about it
[1:33:05] knowing that lazarus is going to have to
[1:33:08] go through a lot more things again and
[1:33:10] even death again
[1:33:13] and losses again and failures again and
[1:33:16] problems again situations again and he's
[1:33:19] over in a perfect place
[1:33:23] it's what gave me such comfort even with
[1:33:25] my mom
[1:33:27] because i knew her body was wasn't there
[1:33:29] to hold her no more
[1:33:32] and she left this place in a broken body
[1:33:35] and i got to reading about brother
[1:33:37] branham going past the curtain of time
[1:33:40] and here he's got his head hands behind
[1:33:42] his head he says
[1:33:43] he's thinking about the other side and
[1:33:45] he's starts hearing this song what was
[1:33:47] that song i thought he started hearing a
[1:33:49] song
[1:33:50] i'm homesick and blue
[1:33:53] want to see jesus
[1:33:55] he said well would you like to go over
[1:33:57] there and he said yeah
[1:34:00] yeah
[1:34:02] would you like to take a look yeah
[1:34:05] and he museum feels himself moving out
[1:34:07] of this body
[1:34:08] and all of a sudden he's running his
[1:34:10] fingers through that bluegrass
[1:34:12] and he's walking down and all of a
[1:34:14] sudden he sees thousands upon thousands
[1:34:16] of running towards him screaming oh my
[1:34:18] precious brother
[1:34:20] we know the conversation and all that
[1:34:22] took place and he said all of a sudden
[1:34:24] he felt his body going back
[1:34:26] he felt himself going back and he turned
[1:34:28] and he says do i have to go back to that
[1:34:33] here he is laying beside a woman he
[1:34:35] loves children in the other room and a
[1:34:37] body is about 50 years old
[1:34:40] pretty pretty still pretty healthy and
[1:34:42] active do i have to go there
[1:34:45] do i have to go back they don't want to
[1:34:48] come back here
[1:34:51] to pick up these old bodies again
[1:34:54] they only want to come here
[1:34:56] for the resurrection
[1:35:00] and god is making a way of escape
[1:35:03] and the trap in this hour that we're
[1:35:05] living in it seems to be closing and
[1:35:08] closing and closing how we going to get
[1:35:11] out here how is all this going to work
[1:35:13] out how is it going to be what's going
[1:35:15] to take place i don't know
[1:35:18] but i do know
[1:35:20] that one day before that trap closes
[1:35:23] i'm going to be snatched out of here
[1:35:28] and i'm not going to be the only one
[1:35:33] i know god's got a body all over this
[1:35:35] world it's going to change
[1:35:38] and god's going to make a way of escape
[1:35:40] what a way
[1:35:42] think about that i mean it's wonderful
[1:35:44] to read about the red sea and what he
[1:35:46] did there and the goliath and what he
[1:35:48] did there all down to the books of the
[1:35:51] bible and even what he did when he
[1:35:52] walked here on the shores of galilee and
[1:35:54] the woman with the blood issue the way
[1:35:56] of escape gyrus in the way of escape i
[1:35:58] mean how many we could go through time
[1:35:59] after time after time but we're about to
[1:36:02] come to our turn
[1:36:06] what a way of escape this is going to be
[1:36:11] your body might be riddled with cancer
[1:36:14] it might be riddled with sugar diabetes
[1:36:16] or blood high blood pressure but all of
[1:36:18] a sudden it's gonna escape
