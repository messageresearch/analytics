[39:25] amen we'll let you be seated
[39:29] speak to you for a
[39:30] moment uh just like to say it's good to
[39:33] be home been a minute um uh been away
[39:37] been living out a suitcase actually for
[39:39] about a month and a half and I'm sick of
[39:41] it but uh we're glad to be um be back to
[39:45] the house of the Lord with our brothers
[39:47] and sisters here in evening light
[39:49] Tabernacle I do you know of course come
[39:51] home in a new phase of Life uh we let
[39:53] you be dismissed uh a Pap all and uh you
[39:58] know we left right after the meetings to
[40:00] go and and to welcome a new life into
[40:02] the world I wasn't really expecting to
[40:04] leave before or so soon but actually had
[40:08] plans to uh stay and take care of things
[40:11] at home after the meeting and then fly
[40:13] back to Florida but things begin to
[40:15] change very rapidly with Adriana and the
[40:18] situation there so it looked like that
[40:20] she would actually um give birth before
[40:23] I left so we decided to join sister Ruth
[40:25] and Katie and they're still there uh
[40:28] soaking up the grand the little grandson
[40:31] hugs and everything probably listening
[40:33] to me right now smiling about it but
[40:35] that's okay I'll have my turn again but
[40:38] you know I have decided it's kind of
[40:40] weird to be the same age as old
[40:42] people that's um that's really odd but
[40:47] uh you know we decided to join them and
[40:49] be there and the Lord would see fit that
[40:50] he would be born before we left but you
[40:53] know we actually have been working quite
[40:55] a bit while gone minist at brother
[40:57] Danny's Church you know they've been
[41:00] going through a lot as a church they've
[41:01] had two major hurricanes that hit their
[41:04] area and floodings and wind damage and
[41:07] things they also had a tragic death of a
[41:09] young man in the church so we did
[41:12] everything we could to Tred to encourage
[41:14] them and and to help them while we were
[41:16] there and ministered for them and then
[41:18] would leave and meet brother Tim in
[41:20] Atlanta and we had some wonderful
[41:21] meetings there with Brother David mayor
[41:23] and he he of course sends his greetings
[41:26] back it's a it's a big meeting there in
[41:28] Europe and we're glad to be a part of
[41:30] that but then was able to get back to
[41:32] Florida and then you know dedicate
[41:34] Bennett to the Lord Jesus and it was
[41:37] very special to me is my first baby
[41:39] dedication to ever do and for that to be
[41:41] your first grandchild that means a lot
[41:43] and we're very thankful for that
[41:45] opportunity and thank brother Danny for
[41:47] that opportunity so sister Ruth and I
[41:50] are very happy to welcome a new life
[41:52] into the world and and we're very happy
[41:54] for Ben and Adriana as they enter into
[41:56] this new phase of life and and uh you
[42:01] know he's a keeper and we're going to
[42:02] keep him but uh you know also a lot of
[42:05] things have happened in this last few
[42:07] days you know the elections that have
[42:08] taken place some people may ask you are
[42:11] you shocked uh you think this country
[42:13] now will turn around that we got a real
[42:15] president no it's not going to turn
[42:18] around has been indicted for rejecting
[42:21] Christ uh well I thought surely this
[42:24] would be the one the woman that's seen
[42:25] in the vision well very well was you
[42:29] know people's expectations of how
[42:31] prophecies are fulfilled most of the
[42:32] time don't happen like they thought it
[42:35] would you know you can ask those 2,000
[42:38] years ago about the prophecy Prophecies
[42:40] of Isaiah and behold a virgin shall
[42:43] conceive and it happened and they missed
[42:46] it but there was an elect group that saw
[42:48] it amen that seen it and so but many
[42:51] times prophecies are fulfilled and the
[42:53] masses miss it because it didn't come
[42:56] how they thought it should have or how
[42:58] it would be and you know if I have
[43:01] anything to say about this election and
[43:03] what's happening in our country all I
[43:05] can say about it is stay ready to
[43:08] go stay ready to go this ain't the time
[43:11] to relax and say well it's going to be
[43:13] okay now no you better make sure you're
[43:15] calling an election sure oh I know if
[43:18] Cala would have got into the White House
[43:20] it' been the churches have been filled
[43:21] up I done seen people comment you know
[43:24] about it well if she gets in that surely
[43:26] means Christ is is returning well it
[43:28] matters not if she gets in or not Christ
[43:30] is
[43:31] returning but you know uh this the way
[43:34] it happens so if it ain't today it'll be
[43:36] tomorrow if it ain't this week it'll be
[43:38] next week if it ain't this month it'll
[43:40] be next month if it ain't this year
[43:41] it'll be next year whatever we need to
[43:44] stay ready to go amen so we thank the
[43:47] Lord for all that he's done in our lives
[43:49] and again very happy to be back amen
[43:52] with you today and so with that we'll
[43:55] just turn to Psalm 103 if you wouldn't
[43:57] stand together for a moment and uh just
[44:01] some things that been on my heart as uh
[44:04] as we of course got the news of sister
[44:06] Donna and and even I don't know if much
[44:09] has been said but sister Elizabeth is
[44:11] going through some testing and things
[44:14] doctors with a lot of questions there
[44:16] and so we're just looking to the Lord
[44:17] for that and so I I I begin to think
[44:20] about amen things and I just want to go
[44:23] to the scriptures here in Psalms 103 and
[44:25] verse one it says bless the Lord oh my
[44:27] soul and all that is within me bless His
[44:30] holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and
[44:33] forget not all his benefits who
[44:36] forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[44:38] Health all thy diseases who redeemeth
[44:41] thy life from destruction who crowneth
[44:44] thee with loving kindness and Tender
[44:46] Mercies who satisfies thy mouth with
[44:48] good things so that thy youth is renewed
[44:51] like eagles also 1 Peter 2 and verse 21
[44:54] says for even here unto are you called
[44:57] because Christ also suffered for us
[45:00] leaving us an example that we should F
[45:02] that you should follow his
[45:04] steps who did no sin neither was G found
[45:07] in his mouth who when he was reviled
[45:10] reviled not again but when he suffered
[45:12] he threatened not but committed himself
[45:14] to him that judges righteously who has
[45:18] own his own self be bear our sins in his
[45:21] own body on the tree that we being dead
[45:25] in sins shall live unto righteousness by
[45:28] whose Stripes ye were healed amen ye
[45:33] were healed God bless you can be this
[45:35] you can be
[45:41] seated I I just been thinking about
[45:45] diseases and I thought about the one
[45:47] disease that the angel of the Lord
[45:49] mentioned was cancer and I want to speak
[45:53] on faith over cancer because seems to be
[45:56] very prevalent in our time that we're
[45:58] living in I know that there's probably
[46:01] everyone in here could either say you
[46:02] know somebody who had cancer or maybe
[46:05] had cancer yourself or or somebody even
[46:07] your family but you know I I I take
[46:10] great courage and what Peter said he
[46:12] said by whose Stripes ye were healed
[46:16] amen not not that you will be healed but
[46:19] you were healed that is already done and
[46:21] I I was looking at this word cancer it's
[46:24] a disease caused by an uncontrolled
[46:27] division of abnormal cells in in a part
[46:30] of the body or it's a practice or
[46:33] phenomenon perceived to be evil or
[46:36] destructive and hard to contain or
[46:39] eradicate and I I was looking at
[46:41] different things you know brother Bram
[46:43] said about cancer and cancer is is a ton
[46:45] of quotes you can go through and uh
[46:48] there's speaking about healing of cancer
[46:50] and then what cancer is and I just was
[46:52] going through them through the last week
[46:54] or so and he says you know what is a
[46:57] tumor what is a cancer it's the
[46:59] multiplication of cells that come from a
[47:02] little backsliding cell now I as I
[47:05] Minister this we got the natural but we
[47:07] also have the spiritual amen there's
[47:10] there's cancers of the body natural but
[47:12] there's also cancers of the Soul
[47:14] spiritually amen a cancer becomes from a
[47:17] bruise a bruised cell usually when it
[47:19] comes from a cell that is bruised all
[47:21] mashed up or in other words that cell is
[47:24] backsliding and something happens in
[47:26] there that fails to get the function of
[47:29] the blood to it right and though there's
[47:31] Satan the author of death which God is
[47:33] the author of Life Satan the altar of
[47:35] death puts a demon in there called
[47:38] cancer now cancer is not its name that's
[47:41] the name Medical Science gave it but
[47:43] cancer that's not his name that's his
[47:46] name is a demon amen the word cancer
[47:49] comes from crab it means legs and things
[47:51] that runs out all these other disease
[47:53] are given medical terms but that little
[47:55] cancer comes in there first it's a
[47:58] spirit then it gets into a backsliding
[48:00] cell or bruised cell or a cell that is
[48:03] not operating right he said I'd like to
[48:05] preach the gospel now for a few minutes
[48:07] if I had time that's what hap that's
[48:09] what can happen in a church when you get
[48:12] someone failing to operate in the church
[48:14] Someone failing pulling off getting
[48:16] indifferent that's a cancer in the
[48:18] church it's a devil in that person
[48:21] that's right that causes the whole
[48:22] church to be sick over the best thing to
[48:25] do is to have a spiritual operation he
[48:27] said but this little cell becomes
[48:29] backsliding and that cancer comes in and
[48:32] that cancer lays there first as a spirit
[48:34] then it forms a teeny cell around it on
[48:36] its own and then that cell becomes
[48:38] another cell until it forms its own life
[48:41] and we know how what is happening amen
[48:43] it begins to sap so much blood till
[48:46] somebody begins to feel sick what is it
[48:49] it's a poison it's death it runs into
[48:51] every little fiber of the body down to
[48:53] the tissue stretching his legs out
[48:56] weeding root around this and around that
[48:58] going down the doctor comes along opens
[49:00] up nothing can be done men the best of
[49:03] their knowledge are saying everything he
[49:04] knows there it is sew the patient back
[49:06] up it's finished there's nothing you can
[49:08] be done you can take that person all
[49:10] apart you can't find it at all there it
[49:12] is a patient hopelessly helplessly and
[49:16] gone then as far as the doctor is
[49:20] concerned amen as far as the doctors is
[49:24] concerned but as far as God is concern
[49:26] concern there's nothing that cancer is
[49:29] nothing more than a
[49:31] toothache amen with God there's no such
[49:33] a thing as an incurable disease you know
[49:36] when when we hear the word cancer what
[49:38] comes with it fear comes with it because
[49:41] a toothache is not normally going to
[49:42] take your life amen but cancer has that
[49:45] fear that is attached because your life
[49:47] is attached to that he said but God can
[49:50] heal cancer the same as he can heal a
[49:53] toothache or anything now I think it's a
[49:56] one I think it's amazing that he named
[49:58] cancer and and we know cancer is like a
[50:00] Goliath it's it's a great enemy to the
[50:03] people Amen in the world but when he
[50:06] names that he don't necessarily name
[50:08] everything under it because we know amen
[50:11] when when the giant is named everything
[50:14] under it is also named in other words if
[50:16] he's showing he has power over the
[50:18] greatest then of course he has power
[50:20] over everything else amen so God is
[50:23] showing us very clearly in this age I
[50:26] know who the giant is and I'm calling
[50:28] him out by name amen cancer is no bad
[50:31] thing for God to heal he can make it
[50:34] well can he do you believe you will all
[50:35] right amen we receive it in the name of
[50:37] the Lord Jesus there's no difference
[50:40] with Christ he's no respector of person
[50:43] young or old cancer or toothache it
[50:46] matters not to him if he's Lord over the
[50:49] matter that's right and I'm here to say
[50:51] he is Lord over the matter he's Lord
[50:54] over your life he's Lord over your
[50:56] you're coming in and you're going out
[50:58] he's the one who puts the date on it
[51:00] there's nothing the devil can do about
[51:02] it amen it's all in God's hands so he's
[51:04] truly Lord over the matter so surely we
[51:07] can trust him no matter what the word is
[51:09] given us what name is given us amen he
[51:12] said Remember the Five Loaves and the
[51:14] 5,000 or how many baskets was took up
[51:17] and in other words like this you seen
[51:19] God provide and do a miracle then can't
[51:22] he do a miracle again yes sir can he do
[51:26] A Mir again in other words like this if
[51:28] he saved you from the life of sin can he
[51:31] not also heal your
[51:33] body if he took that cancer out of your
[51:37] spirit and out of your soul that was
[51:39] there trying to eat the amen amen what
[51:41] was even worse and cancer upon the
[51:43] natural body is the cancer on the soul
[51:46] and if God took care of that in your
[51:48] life some of you was ate up with the
[51:50] cancer of drugs or cancer of alcohol or
[51:53] cancer of smoking or the cancer of
[51:55] whatever amen but God God did an
[51:57] operation on you and he took that out of
[51:59] your life well if that God can do that
[52:01] for you spiritually surely he can also
[52:03] do it for you naturally amen but he
[52:06] wants somebody that'll believe amen do
[52:08] you remember when you was a sinner and
[52:10] he lifted your soul in faith to believe
[52:13] can he likewise do something great for
[52:15] you again yes sir amen hallelujah amen
[52:19] TR trumps thinks he's got to make make
[52:21] America great again can God make you
[52:24] great again can God do something great
[52:26] for you again can't he do a miracle or
[52:29] anything else for you amen he said
[52:31] usually when you take a person in a
[52:33] wheelchair and they think well I'm
[52:35] hopeless no you're not no more harder
[52:37] for God to heal you then than to stop a
[52:40] toothache he's God infinite he's in
[52:43] control amen just put a little faith
[52:45] there and it'll go to work he say
[52:47] exactly Jesus passed by a tree it was no
[52:50] figs he said no man eateth from you from
[52:52] thee ever again and went on they didn't
[52:55] see no difference but down beneath the
[52:57] ground that started dying and within 24
[53:00] hours when they passed by again it
[53:02] withered and that's the same thing that
[53:05] takes place when a cancer is there and
[53:08] God's spirit curses that thing he said
[53:11] you might go back to the doctrine it
[53:13] looks the same but way down deep it's
[53:17] dying way down deep in you if you
[53:20] accepted Christ as your healer maybe you
[53:22] can only move a finger or you only feel
[53:25] this but God is the job believe what you
[53:29] say shall come to pass and it shall be
[53:31] done if that isn't true then God isn't
[53:36] true amen you know as I said in this day
[53:40] God made sure we knew that cancer was
[53:43] under his
[53:45] Dominion you know brother bam talks
[53:47] about it the angel that called it by
[53:49] name not even
[53:51] cancer not even
[53:53] cancer you know is it was getting along
[53:56] towards 3:00 in the morning he said and
[53:59] I was praying I said God I'll stay right
[54:02] here till I die I'm a minister I don't
[54:05] don't let me be a deceiver you know he's
[54:07] searching why am I seeing these Visions
[54:09] you know the story and and he said if
[54:11] I'm wrong come down and stop it shut it
[54:13] off oh God have mercy he said I cried
[54:15] till my eyes were about swollen shut and
[54:18] I said God I'm sincere I don't know what
[54:20] to do if I I don't want to fail you and
[54:23] he said while I was in prayer all at
[54:24] once I seen a light flickering
[54:27] and I looked I said well somebody's
[54:29] coming with a flashlight can't be a car
[54:30] way back in these woods and I looked and
[54:32] it was spreading out on the floor
[54:34] getting bigger and bigger and I and I
[54:36] looked there and as it spread out and
[54:38] the light got bigger and bigger and
[54:40] turned around I heard something going
[54:42] and brother Brandon illr walking and
[54:44] he's begin to hear footsteps and I
[54:45] looked across the board and I seen under
[54:48] the light was coming down a man's foot
[54:50] and a white robe imagine how I must have
[54:52] felt I said oh my I looked like that and
[54:55] I it walked close closer and when it
[54:57] come into the full light it was a man
[54:59] with his arms folded and he weighed
[55:01] about 200 lb kind of dark complexed
[55:04] Mexican complexion or so you know like a
[55:06] Spanish some sort of dark complexion
[55:08] smooth face no beard had dark hair down
[55:11] his shoulders had a white robe on and
[55:13] his characters you can just talk about
[55:15] it one of it was so Meek it looked again
[55:17] if he had speak the world would turn
[55:21] over amen there must have been a lot of
[55:24] power in that in that in that moment
[55:26] there am me the world would turn over
[55:28] and he walked right up to me just as
[55:30] smooth as he could and I was biting my
[55:32] fingers until it felt like it was about
[55:34] to bleed and I was trying to figure out
[55:36] if this is real or not and I I just
[55:38] couldn't move and and imagine the way
[55:40] out in the wilderness like that by
[55:41] yourself and it's
[55:43] dark and all of a sudden this is what
[55:45] you're see and he said he spoke to me
[55:49] and he saido not
[55:52] fear that's
[55:54] incredible his first words were do not
[55:59] fear yeah and when he said that I knew
[56:03] it was the same voice that I had been
[56:06] hearing since I was a little boy yes sir
[56:10] same voice that was in the Whirlwind the
[56:12] same one that showed me the vision I'd
[56:14] heard him talk before he said it wasn't
[56:17] a imagination it was an audible voice
[56:20] just as you hear mine and a man just as
[56:23] real as I'm standing here I could have
[56:25] shook hands if him raised his hand out
[56:27] he he could have I could have patted him
[56:29] on the side he was just as natural as
[56:31] anyone else and he looked at me and he
[56:33] says do not
[56:35] fear for I am sent from the presence of
[56:39] almighty God to tell you of your
[56:42] peculiar birth and and life that has
[56:44] been IND has been to indicate that you
[56:47] have to take a gift of Divine Healing to
[56:49] the people of the world and if you'll be
[56:52] sincere when you pray and get people to
[56:55] believe you nothing shall stand before
[56:58] your prayer not even
[57:03] cancer incredible here here he is
[57:06] standing here in this darkness and a
[57:08] light comes and a man steps out and it
[57:10] begins to speak to him I've been sent
[57:12] from the presence of almighty God do not
[57:15] ever forget this message is accompanied
[57:18] by an Angel that's right this Angel is
[57:22] still Among Us he's still here he's
[57:25] still moving he's still orchestrating
[57:28] and he's speaking to you tonight do not
[57:30] fear that's
[57:35] right see God did not intend for you to
[57:38] be sick direct
[57:41] quote God didn't intend for you to be
[57:44] sick God Made You in his likeness he
[57:48] wants you to be
[57:53] well that shouting grounds right there
[57:57] cuz the devil wants to tell you well
[57:58] you're going through this cuz you did
[58:00] something wrong or you did this no God
[58:02] wants you to be well amen he has done
[58:06] everything he can to keep you well yeah
[58:10] he has got his word there he's got a fa
[58:13] allowed Faith to be built in this hour
[58:16] why to he knows sickness is coming he
[58:19] knows diseases are here so he's made a
[58:21] way he's made an
[58:23] atonement he just needs somebody to
[58:25] believe
[58:27] sure Satan's against you therefore the
[58:30] cancer he starts or a tumor whatever it
[58:32] is a germ he begins to multiply like a
[58:34] tumor becomes malignant so forth It's a
[58:36] body just like you're of a body it has a
[58:38] spirit just like you are a spirit only
[58:40] it has no soul but it has a life like
[58:43] you have a life therefore in you in your
[58:45] flesh there's two lives one are you and
[58:48] the other is another being multiplying
[58:51] growing a body just like you grow a body
[58:53] well then what does it do that what is
[58:55] that that is a
[58:57] devil I love how how it just makes it
[59:01] very plain what we're dealing with it
[59:03] ain't it it ain't cancer it ain't high
[59:06] blood pressure it ain't this that it's
[59:09] demons amen as brother Brandon was say
[59:12] it I may go I don't I may still have it
[59:13] here I don't know but it would say Jesus
[59:15] never walked up and said well you know
[59:18] thou thou
[59:20] py or thou this or thou blindness or he
[59:24] didn't he said thou spirit come out of
[59:27] them amen he knew what was behind them
[59:30] see this thing is there and it's a germ
[59:32] of Life by the devil and he's trying to
[59:34] destroy your life and he eats up your
[59:37] bloodstream in different ways as he
[59:39] works upon you therefore I know that
[59:41] they are devils Jesus called them devils
[59:44] and that's what what he says the truth
[59:46] they are the devil a devil's a Tormentor
[59:48] he's here to tear up your body to eat
[59:50] you up to destroy you to shorten your
[59:53] three-core and 10 if he can if he can
[59:57] there you go if he can but Divine
[1:00:01] Healing amen is here for you yes sir
[1:00:04] amen the word of God is still the same
[1:00:07] yesterday today and
[1:00:10] forever listen if it's ever time that we
[1:00:13] should believe it ought to be right now
[1:00:16] well you say well we got better science
[1:00:17] than we ever had we got better doctors
[1:00:19] than we ever have and we got just as
[1:00:21] much death as we ever had
[1:00:26] if not
[1:00:27] more he said you know Divine Healing he
[1:00:30] talks about this Divine Healing died out
[1:00:32] for a while here a few years ago it just
[1:00:34] let down it happens through the age of
[1:00:37] History it's let down so often and
[1:00:40] during that time cancer broke
[1:00:43] out wow cancer broke out sicknesses in
[1:00:47] the church 80% of the people are sick
[1:00:50] Medical Science he said I salute them
[1:00:52] they do great things they make medicine
[1:00:54] to sell I I said to sell all right it's
[1:00:56] all right for those who want to take it
[1:00:58] it's all right but look in the phase we
[1:01:00] got today the best doctors we had we got
[1:01:03] the best hospitals we've ever had the
[1:01:05] best drugs we've ever practiced with but
[1:01:07] we got more sickness than we ever had
[1:01:09] because we got more unbelief than we
[1:01:12] ever
[1:01:13] had that's exactly right only God Is A
[1:01:16] Healer did you ever notice right in the
[1:01:18] days when they got all these fine drugs
[1:01:20] and operations and surgeons and so forth
[1:01:22] constantly they're building more
[1:01:24] infirmities for the incurable is that
[1:01:26] right there's there's never was nothing
[1:01:28] like that ever come before Master Jesus
[1:01:30] but he would more than a match for it
[1:01:32] there's no incurable to
[1:01:35] him I thought I'd get a little bit more
[1:01:37] louder amen there's no incurable to him
[1:01:41] all things are
[1:01:43] possible nothing too incurable for him
[1:01:46] and when people begin to cry out God do
[1:01:48] this do that for us send us deliver
[1:01:50] thousands of his people dying yearly
[1:01:53] cancer and so forth but then God hears
[1:01:55] the cry
[1:01:56] don't you think it's just as possible
[1:01:58] for God to send down Deliverance for
[1:02:00] sick people as he did for people that
[1:02:02] was in bondage and EV Egypt he's just as
[1:02:05] kind-hearted to your cry why he listen
[1:02:08] to their
[1:02:09] cry Hallelujah come on somebody he
[1:02:12] promised in the last days he would have
[1:02:15] a church that these signs would follow
[1:02:18] them they don't think that that they
[1:02:20] well they don't think that these are the
[1:02:21] last days it is isn't the time now for
[1:02:24] these things to happen yes it is here
[1:02:27] we've got it it's here and you will see
[1:02:30] it oh
[1:02:33] yeah
[1:02:38] Hallelujah but Divine Healing is let
[1:02:40] down promises are let
[1:02:42] go well we got the word well yeah in the
[1:02:44] word there's
[1:02:47] healing there's
[1:02:49] deliverances it's time to
[1:02:53] believe you know he would saying
[1:02:54] overcome he says says overcome means to
[1:02:57] recognize the devil in every one of his
[1:02:59] tricks a lot of people try to say
[1:03:01] there's no devil it's just the thought
[1:03:04] don't you believe that there is a real
[1:03:07] devil he's just as real as you are
[1:03:09] anybody a real devil you might you must
[1:03:12] recognize him to be real you must know
[1:03:14] he's a
[1:03:16] devil and I thought this was something
[1:03:18] that you know didn't occur to me when it
[1:03:20] all happened but our youth camp when
[1:03:22] those demons showed up my son Andrew
[1:03:25] said you know the devil's really stupid
[1:03:27] he said cuz he showed himself to us
[1:03:29] young people and he said we saw him yeah
[1:03:33] and he said for me to see a real devil
[1:03:36] tells me there's a real
[1:03:41] God amen amen and and and and so the
[1:03:45] devil is there he's a real devil he's
[1:03:47] against you Amen to try to overcome you
[1:03:51] but the god that's in you is
[1:03:53] greater amen and mightier than he is
[1:03:56] that's the one that's in you is already
[1:03:59] overcome that devil and by his grace
[1:04:02] you're more than a match for
[1:04:05] him whatever you're dealing with tonight
[1:04:08] if God be for you who can be against you
[1:04:11] you're more than a match for him by his
[1:04:15] grace that's real overcoming when you
[1:04:17] recognize you look back and say well I'm
[1:04:19] doing this and I'm oh no no no you're
[1:04:21] not doing anything you're defeated them
[1:04:22] but there's no condemnation of them that
[1:04:24] in Christ Jesus that walk walk not after
[1:04:26] the flesh but after the spirit then you
[1:04:28] realize that you've overcome by him and
[1:04:30] you know that this is a devil you can't
[1:04:33] say well I I got a sickness and I don't
[1:04:35] believe it's a sickness oh yeah it's a
[1:04:38] sickness it's a sickness yeah it's a
[1:04:42] cancer yes there's no there's no faith
[1:04:45] there's faith is not denying that there
[1:04:48] ain't a real devil that's right amen it
[1:04:51] is a cancer but remember this greater is
[1:04:55] is he that is in
[1:04:57] you than he that is in that
[1:05:01] cancer amen you must realize that the
[1:05:03] Holy Spirit that's in you has already
[1:05:06] overcome this thing and he that is in
[1:05:09] you and you can now overcome by him
[1:05:13] that's right that's exactly the way the
[1:05:16] scriptures are written the Bible plainly
[1:05:19] states they're
[1:05:20] demons the blind people look at the
[1:05:22] woman the daughter of Israel she was all
[1:05:24] bound over and bent
[1:05:26] and he said which one of you you know
[1:05:29] having a mule wouldn't loose it you know
[1:05:30] when how much more is this daughter of
[1:05:33] Israel who' been bound by this
[1:05:35] devil stooped over and perhaps maybe
[1:05:38] arthritis maybe that's what the medical
[1:05:40] doctors would call it arthritis that's a
[1:05:43] medical name but Jesus said it was a
[1:05:46] devil amen today Cancer is a medical
[1:05:49] name they called it cancer but Jesus
[1:05:51] would have called it a devil amen of
[1:05:54] course if anyone with a common school
[1:05:56] education knows a devil means Tormentor
[1:05:58] you got a Tormentor in your soul see
[1:06:01] your pastor you got a Tormentor in your
[1:06:03] body he said that's what I'm here for
[1:06:05] epilepsy that's the name the Medical
[1:06:07] Science has given a man brought to an
[1:06:09] epileptic to Jesus he said my son has a
[1:06:13] devil and often times he takes him and
[1:06:15] throws him in the fire amen he says what
[1:06:17] is it the devil does that and Jesus cast
[1:06:20] out the spirit and said come out of
[1:06:24] him the boy had the hardest fit I guess
[1:06:26] he ever had fell on the floor fren on
[1:06:29] the ground amen but they thought he was
[1:06:31] dead and he said he's not dead and he
[1:06:33] took him up the devil throw him like
[1:06:34] that in a tantrum before he left him
[1:06:36] tore many times it happens today if if a
[1:06:39] Christian now when they come and the
[1:06:41] demons been cast from them they'll go
[1:06:44] worse right away and they'll say oh I
[1:06:47] failed to get
[1:06:49] healed he said now you believe what's
[1:06:52] told you faith comes by hearing hearing
[1:06:54] of the word of God and God here with his
[1:06:56] gift confirming his word with signs
[1:06:58] follow and see what I mean one of the
[1:06:59] most marvelous things I could think of
[1:07:01] right now in this little instance just
[1:07:03] before coming he said back in the first
[1:07:05] part of my Ministry I don't know what
[1:07:07] these ministers here tell other things
[1:07:09] but he said he begins to tell testimony
[1:07:11] I love
[1:07:11] testimonies and he said about the third
[1:07:13] meeting I've had my wife had come down
[1:07:16] and she was a little backwards you know
[1:07:18] worse than my mother and you know she
[1:07:19] was bashful and I told her I want to
[1:07:21] introduce her and she was afraid to come
[1:07:23] and and he said she was just bashful and
[1:07:25] backward a little country girl she came
[1:07:27] to the Mee and come down the street
[1:07:28] we've been having at the Tabernacle 3 or
[1:07:30] 400 maybe thousand more people a big
[1:07:32] night but this time there were thousands
[1:07:34] more there and another night there had
[1:07:36] been people healed and miss miss Hade
[1:07:38] wardr a cancer had dropped off a man's
[1:07:41] neck rolled across my foot you remember
[1:07:43] me telling that and he said and he goes
[1:07:45] on and he begins to tell about all the
[1:07:47] different cancers that had taken place
[1:07:49] and derer discernments at a tell he said
[1:07:51] I've May seen a man one night with one
[1:07:53] of these on the side of his nose and it
[1:07:55] looked like a great seed Ward about like
[1:07:57] that and on the end of it inside real
[1:07:59] bloody and red and while I was praying
[1:08:02] for him the cancer left and no one seen
[1:08:04] where it went his F face was now smooth
[1:08:08] and in the meeting I seen a woman come
[1:08:09] over with a handkerchief over her face
[1:08:11] and there she was and I began to pray
[1:08:13] and I thought my lady why is the this
[1:08:17] vibration is cancer and she moved a
[1:08:19] handker down her nose was eaten off and
[1:08:21] the young woman about 38 years old said

[1:08:26] the best doctors done gone too far and
[1:08:28] he said but he said but do you believe
[1:08:30] and she said with all my heart he said
[1:08:32] will you take my word for what I say she
[1:08:34] said I will I said let us pray and the
[1:08:36] vibration stopped I said sister there's

[1:09:40] meanwhile God is doing miraculous
[1:09:44] things and the devil you know gets to be
[1:09:46] this spooky thing that we fear so much
[1:09:49] and the then the angel of the Lord saido
[1:09:51] not
[1:09:53] fear for I have been sent from the
[1:09:55] presence of almighty God Amen and not

[1:10:08] prostate cancer after the church prayed
[1:10:10] with him the numbers begin to drop even
[1:10:12] before they did radiation and through
[1:10:14] this through his radiation and prayer he
[1:10:17] is now cancer
[1:10:20] free amen years ago he said I had a
[1:10:22] sister named May Brown in our church in
[1:10:24] brandville her testimony was that she
[1:10:26] was healed of skin cancer when I prayed
[1:10:29] for her she was 90 at her at that time
[1:10:31] precious sister who was also called out

[1:10:44] with all your heart Jesus made you
[1:10:47] well amen but it wasn't just in brother
[1:10:49] bram's day but a few years later there
[1:10:52] was another man standing there with a
[1:10:54] word of faith and begin to pray over her
[1:10:56] and skin cancer left
[1:11:00] her and brother Daryl Ward sent me these
[1:11:03] he said a sister in Kentucky had a tumor
[1:11:06] on her breast she was in service at the
[1:11:08] preaching of the word stood up and began
[1:11:10] to praise the Lord she went to the
[1:11:12] bathroom and begin to check herself and
[1:11:14] the tumor was
[1:11:15] gone amen a sister in Arizona was
[1:11:18] sitting in the service with a tumor on
[1:11:19] her chest and during the preaching of
[1:11:21] the word she began to praise the Lord
[1:11:23] and the tumor disappeared and she went
[1:11:25] back and home took her blouse off and it
[1:11:27] was all
[1:11:29] gone a brother was in byc Youth Camp
[1:11:32] with a tumor in his ear he came up for
[1:11:34] prayer with the children we had a mass
[1:11:37] prayer he went to bed and when he woke
[1:11:39] up the tumor was
[1:11:42] gone a sister came up in prayer with a
[1:11:44] tumor on ear and he sent me a a picture
[1:11:46] of this one I wish I had it here but
[1:11:48] it's actually a big growth you can see
[1:11:50] it right there on the back of here and 4
[1:11:52] days later it fell off on the floor in
[1:11:54] her
[1:11:56] house this ain't just back in brother
[1:11:58] bram's day it's also in our
[1:12:02] day amen a brother in our church was
[1:12:04] diagnosed with nonalcoholic therosis of
[1:12:07] the liver doctors gave him up he was
[1:12:09] sitting on the platform and I went by
[1:12:11] him and I felt led to pray for him he's
[1:12:13] alive today that's
[1:12:18] right Jeremy Shriner says many years ago
[1:12:21] we had a sister with leukemia she
[1:12:23] desired to be healed and believe for and
[1:12:25] she prayed to be healed as she went
[1:12:27] through the communion line and while she
[1:12:29] was taking it she was completely healed
[1:12:31] and lived to an old
[1:12:33] age said my uncle who's passed away on
[1:12:36] many years ago on now but had a brain
[1:12:38] tumor he said he was scheduled for
[1:12:40] surgery for it to be taken out many
[1:12:42] prayers went up and a vision came over
[1:12:45] by the to the pastor of his healing and
[1:12:47] they asked him to do it ask them to do a
[1:12:49] brain scan again before the surgery and
[1:12:52] the doctors found no tumor the lord gave
[1:12:54] the family many more years ago and since
[1:12:57] he's been taken
[1:13:00] home incredible testimonies he said my
[1:13:03] dad has had sto stage four renal cancer
[1:13:06] and we were told you don't come back
[1:13:08] from that very often but we believe with
[1:13:10] the help from the Lord in prayers of the
[1:13:12] Saints and God using doctors he's still
[1:13:14] with us today
[1:13:17] amen amen God is moving even now he's
[1:13:22] showing us not even
[1:13:23] cancer not not even cancer Amen brother
[1:13:27] Ben beard sends a testimony brother Bill
[1:13:29] McCulla in his church he said I was 67
[1:13:32] years old my urologist discovered
[1:13:34] prostate cancer I've been he' been
[1:13:37] taking different medicines for many
[1:13:38] years but it actually cuts the PCA
[1:13:41] reading by half and after a biopsy he
[1:13:43] told me that they' found cancer but it
[1:13:45] wouldn't kill you I told him I said well
[1:13:47] I know it won't cuz God said he would
[1:13:48] heal me and I thought God knew this
[1:13:51] about this before the foundation of the
[1:13:53] world therefore he provided the healing
[1:13:55] before it was very ever created in my
[1:13:58] body that's right he said this is around
[1:14:01] February March I kept claiming and
[1:14:03] testifying my healing he said I saw the
[1:14:05] doctor in April to decide on treatment
[1:14:07] because brother Bram told us to use
[1:14:09] doctors they ordered the radioactive
[1:14:11] seeds and did this in June three months
[1:14:13] later I had my first PSA test and it
[1:14:16] came back 07 and cancer free 6 months
[1:14:20] later 05 and cancer free and the
[1:14:23] prostate is continually shrinking next
[1:14:26] appointment is in one year I'm still
[1:14:28] praising God for my
[1:14:30] healing amen that's what we got to do we
[1:14:33] got to praise
[1:14:35] him why not praise him he's in control
[1:14:38] that's right just because the doctor
[1:14:40] said cancer does not mean God lost
[1:14:43] control just because a doctor said any
[1:14:45] kind of disease that does not mean God's
[1:14:48] lost control he's still in control
[1:14:51] brother Andrew Spencer of course gives a
[1:14:53] testimony of of his dad's eyes how
[1:14:57] many's heard that
[1:14:59] testimony Miracle Man looking to have
[1:15:02] one eye taken out
[1:15:04] and another one they starting treatment
[1:15:07] on and could you imagine the the Mind
[1:15:10] battles the spirit of fear that would
[1:15:12] try to set in and the reality that would
[1:15:16] try to
[1:15:17] come but that wasn't the reality that
[1:15:22] happened the reality is God's A Healer
[1:15:25] yes that's the true reality and between
[1:15:28] one doctor and another doctor it was
[1:15:32] gone that's
[1:15:34] right in our
[1:15:36] day in Our Moment Mark Spencer brother
[1:15:40] Mark was diagnosed with colon cancer had
[1:15:42] to take hard rounds of chemo and skin
[1:15:45] completely come off his feet till the
[1:15:47] skin completely come off his feet but

[1:15:51] healed of cancer Harold shiffley my
[1:15:54] uncle was Di diagnosed with colon cancer
[1:15:56] he prayed to the Lord for healing and if
[1:15:58] God would heal him he would testify to
[1:16:00] anyone that would listen and he is able
[1:16:02] to testify by the grace of God I am
[1:16:05] healed of
[1:16:06] cancer he said my teeny which is his
[1:16:09] grandma was healed of breast cancer
[1:16:11] while taking communion one night God's A
[1:16:15] Healer doesn't matter the disease not
[1:16:18] even
[1:16:20] cancer why choose cancer choose Faith
[1:16:24] yeah that's right
[1:16:28] Amen brother Jason Jackson wrote this
[1:16:31] say sister Sheila mccomus was healed

[1:18:43] place up there when brother Ron was was
[1:18:46] ministering Brother Kelly's
[1:18:48] father-in-law had prostate cancer and
[1:18:51] God healed him supernaturally doctors
[1:18:53] said later they could see
[1:18:55] where it was but it was no longer
[1:19:01] there another brother in his church
[1:19:03] supernaturally healed of bladder cancer
[1:19:06] you reckon the devil's getting tired of
[1:19:08] this it's all right I got some more
[1:19:11] brother Andrew Glover said a brother in
[1:19:13] South Carolina was passing blood real
[1:19:15] bad for some time he finally went to the
[1:19:17] ER one night and they told him he had
[1:19:19] cancer his family reached out to me and
[1:19:22] I drove down to see him to pray for him
[1:19:24] and after we prayed he got real sick all
[1:19:26] of a sudden and went into the bathroom
[1:19:29] he's getting ready to have another test
[1:19:30] and when he went for that test they come
[1:19:32] back and said we don't know what
[1:19:33] happened the Cancer's
[1:19:35] gone
[1:19:37] amen hallelujah sounds like brother
[1:19:40] bradam days it is cuz it's the same
[1:19:44] God and he's the same yesterday today
[1:19:47] and
[1:19:50] forever brother Matt Morris said there's
[1:19:53] a young girl in his Church Destiny she
[1:19:56] had tumor as a 12-year-old girl and had
[1:19:58] surgery to have to have it removed they
[1:20:00] removed that 8 PB tumor however shortly
[1:20:04] after her mom started coming to our
[1:20:05] church on her next visit they found that
[1:20:07] a return she was diagnosed
[1:20:11] with help me growing teratoma syndrome
[1:20:15] GTS it's a rare condition that occurs
[1:20:17] when a benign tumor grows after
[1:20:19] chemotherapy for a uh some other tumor
[1:20:27] devil her mom was prophesied against St
[1:20:30] against stating that the cause of the
[1:20:32] return was because she came to our
[1:20:33] church and they removed what they could
[1:20:35] and was told he would always come
[1:20:39] back however I love this after prayer
[1:20:43] she's never had chemo and no sign of
[1:20:45] return her last visit was told no need
[1:20:48] to come back because it's not there no
[1:20:51] longer and no sign of his returning the
[1:20:53] doctor said she had bad cells and that
[1:20:56] it would always produce
[1:20:59] cancer listen to Bad cells that it would
[1:21:02] always produce cancer the worst part is
[1:21:04] because they told her that she lived in
[1:21:06] fear in periods of depression for many
[1:21:08] years I always get cancer because I have
[1:21:11] bad cells I always get sick again
[1:21:13] because I have bad cells she had to
[1:21:16] overcome that fear even after two
[1:21:17] surgeries but the Lord came down and
[1:21:20] delivered her of the fear and delivered
[1:21:22] her of the disease
[1:21:29] I got to thinking about that amen we
[1:21:32] also came into this world with bad
[1:21:34] cells cancer in our body and eating up
[1:21:37] spiritually and we'll always do this and
[1:21:40] get up always in to come back but God
[1:21:42] came down on the S that's right and
[1:21:45] supernaturally done operation in our
[1:21:47] lives and we ain't got to worry about it
[1:21:49] no more they ain't no going back that's
[1:21:52] right they ain't no wor everybody
[1:21:55] regrowing why because God is God and he
[1:21:58] don't
[1:22:01] change he's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:06] forever yes
[1:22:08] sir he said and there's arm he say he
[1:22:11] would put his hand in another person's
[1:22:13] hand he said it's just like waves he
[1:22:15] said why does it do that he said because
[1:22:16] the cancer gets excited the life of that
[1:22:19] cancer the life of that germ there is
[1:22:21] excited that spirit that's a spirit
[1:22:26] stands
[1:22:28] there let me go
[1:22:31] back yeah that he said that's a spirit
[1:22:34] listen to this he said it gets excited
[1:22:35] because that's a spirit he said why is
[1:22:37] it getting excited because near here you
[1:22:40] and I stand something that'll make it
[1:22:47] leave by your
[1:22:53] faith key that was given there by your
[1:22:56] faith he said now I'm going to pray for
[1:22:58] you because you know you got cancer
[1:22:59] you've been very nervous and upset I'm
[1:23:01] not reading your mind but you know what
[1:23:02] I'm talking about don't you I don't even
[1:23:04] have to say it but now what I'm trying
[1:23:06] to do is get this to leave and I'm going
[1:23:08] to pray and I'm going to have the
[1:23:09] audience bow their heads I want you to
[1:23:11] watch my hand if it goes away you're
[1:23:13] healed there'll be three witnesses that
[1:23:15] right if it stays you still got cancer
[1:23:17] now remember I can't make it
[1:23:20] go that's the reason I ask you to watch
[1:23:23] you're the you're the one that's got
[1:23:24] cancer if it goes out there'll be a
[1:23:26] cancer in large and if this now if this
[1:23:29] if your faith is all now your faith is
[1:23:32] all that can make it go that's right now
[1:23:36] I want you to believe while I pray and I
[1:23:38] want you to watch my hand and see it
[1:23:40] moves away and then if it drops down the
[1:23:43] swelling leaves the vibration there goes
[1:23:45] is normal then in this hand you're
[1:23:47] healed if it doesn't you're not you'll
[1:23:49] see as he goes on and said but it's your
[1:23:51] faith from here on out your faith but
[1:23:56] see sight and time is God's worst enemy
[1:23:59] in Divine Healing sight and
[1:24:02] time said I doubt whether many people
[1:24:05] here get it because after a while you
[1:24:07] begin to feel find the people coming
[1:24:09] back and saying well I had my healing
[1:24:11] brother Brenham for two or three days
[1:24:13] but it it kind of left me I think it's
[1:24:16] because they don't sit in the don't set
[1:24:18] the meeting right and people don't
[1:24:20] understand he said men that come to the
[1:24:22] platform be totally blind C and Cancers
[1:24:25] or something over their eyes read this
[1:24:27] Bible after being prayed for walk down
[1:24:28] in three or 4 days be just as blind they
[1:24:30] were in the first place what happened
[1:24:32] anybody knows when a life has gone out
[1:24:34] of any flesh it shrinks for a while is
[1:24:36] that right you kill a deer cow it'll
[1:24:39] shrink like after it's dead it begins to
[1:24:41] shrink when a human dies first thing
[1:24:43] what happens it begins to shrink every
[1:24:46] every flesh shrinks and when this life
[1:24:48] goes out of a cell it begins to move
[1:24:50] down and Shrink it'll do that for about
[1:24:53] 72 hours then it'll start swelling and
[1:24:56] he said a little dog get run over there
[1:24:58] on the road you let him lay in the sun
[1:25:00] three days watch it'll swell it'll be a
[1:25:02] bigger dog than it ever was why it had
[1:25:04] died he said but the life begins to
[1:25:06] leave it and but it begins to swell and
[1:25:08] he saids the same thing takes place when
[1:25:10] a demon is cast out of a sick person the
[1:25:13] first few days or I feel wonderful but
[1:25:16] then again they begin to say I'm sicker
[1:25:17] than I ever was I lost my healing and
[1:25:20] just as sure as Faith took it out
[1:25:23] unbelief bring brings it right back
[1:25:25] again
[1:25:27] that's as Faith kills it unbelief
[1:25:29] resurrects
[1:25:32] it that's why a man said Lord help my
[1:25:36] unbelief Jesus said when the unclean
[1:25:38] Spirit gone out of man he walks in dry
[1:25:40] plac and returns back with seven other
[1:25:42] Devils the good man of the house isn't
[1:25:44] standing there to protect that door he
[1:25:45] come right back in the good man of your
[1:25:48] house is your
[1:25:50] faith it says stay away stay away now
[1:25:53] you watch a patient that's healed
[1:25:55] ordinarily unless it's an outstanding
[1:25:57] Mir Miracle or something when Divine
[1:25:58] Healing takes place one thing and the
[1:26:01] Miracle another thing but ordinary run
[1:26:04] of Divine Healing when the unclean
[1:26:05] spirits cast out a cancer devil when it
[1:26:08] leaves a person will take something so
[1:26:10] you can see more visual I say a cataract
[1:26:12] you know it's a blind person and stand
[1:26:14] there a few minutes why it shrinks and
[1:26:17] you're telling them to come back and
[1:26:18] give them a testimony oh my I can see
[1:26:20] what's the matter life is gone the body
[1:26:22] of the Cataract sinking but after few
[1:26:25] days things begin to sell uh I'm losing
[1:26:28] my sight again what's happening oh he
[1:26:30] just worked us up bunch of ho roads just
[1:26:32] got worked up we need something that'll
[1:26:35] last
[1:26:38] yeah he said if you believe me and if
[1:26:42] you believe
[1:26:43] that you'll go right back to being blind
[1:26:49] again but if you'll hold on and say no
[1:26:53] Lord I believe yes sir amen then what
[1:26:57] happens the body swells for so long it
[1:26:59] covers that sight again the cancer in
[1:27:01] the body will swell you become hurting
[1:27:03] and aching again you'll get horribly
[1:27:05] sick terribly sick the big growth of
[1:27:06] dead flesh and you lay in there dead you
[1:27:08] go back to the doctor say oh that's
[1:27:10] nonsense there's cancer laying right
[1:27:11] there I can see it sure you can see it
[1:27:14] but it's
[1:27:16] death Hallelujah he said what happens
[1:27:19] the bloodstream has to purify the body
[1:27:22] and every time the heart pumps don't you
[1:27:23] love going to Dr Jesus and the blood
[1:27:26] around the body and it picks up the
[1:27:28] infection and that'll make you sick for
[1:27:30] a little bit and if you had a chunk of
[1:27:32] meat hanging somewhere as long as a
[1:27:33] snake or something big Around Your
[1:27:35] Finger hanging there and it was dead
[1:27:37] that dead meat begin to be rot and of
[1:27:39] course your blood steam stream becomes
[1:27:41] pumps through there pure but it begins
[1:27:43] to get infected by all these things
[1:27:45] because life has gone from that devil he
[1:27:48] has to
[1:27:50] leave but people's not instructed they
[1:27:52] go away they give up and the same devil
[1:27:55] standing right there to take over
[1:27:58] again same thing with salvation and
[1:28:03] deliverance people get delivered of
[1:28:05] something and the first thing you know
[1:28:07] the first thing comes up and they feel
[1:28:09] that Temptation if they'll just stay
[1:28:11] right there in their Deliverance that
[1:28:12] devil can't come back
[1:28:15] right no
[1:28:19] no so don't you disbelieve stay right
[1:28:22] with it mean it with all your heart no
[1:28:23] sir I'll not be moved no matter how sick
[1:28:26] I get has nothing to do with it the
[1:28:28] first thing you know it'll start
[1:28:29] clearing up again everything will be all
[1:28:31] right then the operation of the doctor
[1:28:33] would have taken you the same growth
[1:28:35] land and now has no life in it you say
[1:28:37] life in it brother brand will it take my
[1:28:39] life no sir the life is a separate life
[1:28:41] from yours it just showed you that
[1:28:43] you're a life and become a being a life
[1:28:45] become a being you're of God it's of the
[1:28:48] devil but it is now
[1:28:52] dead hold hold on to the word hold on to
[1:28:55] your faith no matter that's why your
[1:28:57] symptoms can deceive you right well I
[1:29:00] feel worse and the whole time you're
[1:29:04] healed well I I don't feel no better and
[1:29:07] the whole time you're
[1:29:09] delivered amen we got to stay on the
[1:29:12] word just like Abraham Abraham you got a
[1:29:14] baby not yet but it doesn't matter he
[1:29:17] said I
[1:29:18] would what difference does it make if I
[1:29:21] feel feel it see it that doesn't have
[1:29:23] nothing to do with with he said I would
[1:29:25] right are you healed no that has nothing
[1:29:28] that doesn't matter if I feel healed
[1:29:30] look healed look deliver that has
[1:29:32] nothing to do with it his word said I
[1:29:36] was amen that's where you got to be
[1:29:38] doesn't matter years pass 10 years
[1:29:40] doesn't matter don't don't instead of
[1:29:42] Abraham getting weaker he got stronger
[1:29:45] he knew it going to be more of a miracle
[1:29:46] all the time because he believed God and
[1:29:49] he staggered not at the promises through
[1:29:51] unbelief he said we're going to have it
[1:29:53] and one morning that womb of Sarah be to
[1:29:56] swell and little Isaac was born why
[1:29:59] because Abraham believed his
[1:30:04] God but it's not by feelings it's not by
[1:30:07] sight we don't walk by feelings we walk
[1:30:09] we don't walk by our sight we walk by
[1:30:12] faith whatever things you ask when you
[1:30:16] pray believe and you shall receive it
[1:30:18] God said so it's got to
[1:30:20] be amen he said you see those little
[1:30:24] white things running there that's the
[1:30:27] life of that
[1:30:28] cancer it's only scared because it knows
[1:30:33] it's going to have to leave if your
[1:30:36] faith will
[1:30:42] believe never thought about cancer being
[1:30:44] scared of
[1:30:46] you but we've been scared of cancer it's
[1:30:50] time we start
[1:30:51] believing just believe
[1:30:54] sure I understand some have died with
[1:30:56] cancer and you say well what about their
[1:30:59] faith you know all things are in God's
[1:31:02] timing but they died in faith that's
[1:31:05] right sister Erica she died with cancer
[1:31:07] brother Timothy what about her she died
[1:31:09] in
[1:31:11] faith I would rather die in faith than
[1:31:14] die in
[1:31:19] unbelief amen her faith took her there
[1:31:23] that's right it was God it was God's
[1:31:24] timing that's all you can say to that
[1:31:27] but many times mean we allow things to
[1:31:30] come upon us and we allow it to take
[1:31:32] place because of our unbelief when it
[1:31:34] really wasn't God's
[1:31:36] timing we allowed oursel to go there
[1:31:40] because of our
[1:31:42] unbelief we allowed ourselves to lay
[1:31:44] there in that sin or that unbelief amen
[1:31:47] why because we didn't believe his word
[1:31:50] that's right
[1:31:54] he said' I might just stop here and give
[1:31:56] you just a little tip anybody want a tip
[1:32:00] all right sometimes you may be sitting
[1:32:02] out there with a cancer or sitting with
[1:32:03] some disease and you think why me being
[1:32:06] a Christian would I be in this way why
[1:32:10] would I be sitting like this if I'm a
[1:32:15] Christian sometimes God lets things get
[1:32:18] so dark that you can't see up around or
[1:32:21] anywhere else and then he comes and
[1:32:24] makes a way through for you that you can
[1:32:26] say this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:32:31] in my
[1:32:35] life what he promised to do he has done
[1:32:39] in
[1:32:41] me cuz greater is he that's in you than
[1:32:44] he that's in the
[1:32:45] wheelchair greater is he that's in you
[1:32:48] than that stretcher greater is he that's
[1:32:49] in you that's in that cancer greater is
[1:32:52] he that's in you that's in the
[1:32:53] affliction greater is he that's anything
[1:32:55] there is that the devil has to put on
[1:32:57] you greater is he that's in you than he
[1:33:00] that's in the
[1:33:02] world this is word he said where's the
[1:33:05] Goliath who's the Goliath brother Bram
[1:33:07] that cancer that's eating you up that's
[1:33:08] right that tumor that's hanging on you
[1:33:10] that's right them cataracts that
[1:33:11] crippled arm anything looks at it and
[1:33:13] says it can't be done the devil says you
[1:33:15] might as well quit believing you might
[1:33:17] as well just settle down cuz you'll
[1:33:18] never no more get well than anything
[1:33:21] your doctor said so all the rest of them
[1:33:23] said so you can't get well but C the
[1:33:25] same Christ that made you stop your
[1:33:27] drink and smoking lying stealing and
[1:33:30] saved your
[1:33:32] life it's the same one who saved you
[1:33:36] from sin and the devil's grave if God
[1:33:38] can do that for you he can also heal
[1:33:41] your
[1:33:42] body sure he's a Goliath but don't take
[1:33:45] his boast yes sir amen don't listen to
[1:33:49] him stand in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:51] and challenge him to a snow a showdown
[1:33:53] Hallelujah he said I feel religious
[1:33:55] positionally in Christ if the believer
[1:33:57] knows his position he'll have it God's
[1:34:00] great spirit is here and His Holy Ghost
[1:34:02] is ready to fall on anybody that'll
[1:34:05] believe it Hallelujah do you believe it
[1:34:08] God promised it God will do it you're in
[1:34:10] Christ God Goliath may be bragging
[1:34:12] Goliath says you see you was here last
[1:34:15] night you didn't get healed you feel
[1:34:16] worse today who is that uncircumcised
[1:34:19] devil who is that devil that has no
[1:34:21] relationship with God at all who is that
[1:34:23] that devil that stands with nothing but
[1:34:25] a defeated thing behind him his master
[1:34:28] Was Defeated at Calvary he our our Lord
[1:34:31] our conqueror he is nothing but a BL we
[1:34:34] won't believe him no matter what he says
[1:34:37] that's
[1:34:38] right down with him Jesus Christ robbed
