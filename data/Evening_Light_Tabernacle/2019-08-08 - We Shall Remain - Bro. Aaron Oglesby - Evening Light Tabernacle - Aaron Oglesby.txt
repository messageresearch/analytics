morning how can we [Music] hope is in the King of Kings is in the Lord this morning oh how can we not stand how can we not press home you know Satan has plans for you Satan's always had plans you know sometimes Satan execute those plans but what Satan can't control is the outcome Satan can't control the outcome he put something on you and he thinks he's got you and the Bible says all things work together for good but I'm going through something all things work together for good in your life I'm telling you he can't control the outcome the only way Satan wins is if you quit the only way he wins is if you give up because if you stand and you put your shoulder to the wheel he'll stand for you our God will stand for you and you will be victorious but you got a press on you got to take another step it's not time to quit we're right here at the end take another step church I want to sing that song brother Andrew sing this with us in Jesus name we press on [Music] as your Valley deep

heads - Oh Heavenly Father as they sang that song my hope how it will DUP within me Lord what I hope we have to pay oh what a place we can put our trust in a god that has never failed and will never fail we're asking you now to come and just take complete control of this service take complete control of my lips Lord I surrender myself to you Lord father you know those that have gathered here this morning you know the battles Lord God and what we're asking for strength today depressing though we're asking you to lift us up into heavenly places Lord God lifts our faith to places we can grab ahold look out of all the promises of God know that we can find that solid rock to take our stand upon this morn and say I will not be moved lord have your way I pray Lord Jesus know what I I pray for our pastor this morning as he prepares to take the pulpit lord I pray your bless that service there at that camp Lord we love you Lord Jesus and we thank you Jesus what a wonderful atmosphere here this morning thank y'all very much you'll be turning to the book of Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 11 been up late the last few nights for some reason haven't been able to sleep I've been seeing three and four o'clock every morning but the good thing about that is I've been able to watch brother Tim and Timothy services there in Canada and they have been so powerful so amazing how I watched as the Holy Spirit has just moved through that place and witnessed people just crying out to God and worshiping God and brother Tom ray got up and said I see people here crying out to God and worshiping God that I've never seen moved before and that just thrilled my heart because I'll know as we get closer and closer and closer they're still seed out there they may not have moved yet but they will move they're still seed out there they may not have taken a step yet but they will take a step we believe that with all our heart we're thankful that the Lord's using the men of God and just pray for them as they're out pray for brother Craig as he's still out we want to read here in the scripture Ephesians 6 verse 11 we'll read down through verse 14 it says put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day I believe we're in that evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having a breastplate of righteousness I also want to look in 1st Thessalonians 4 in verse 14 1st Thessalonians 4 in verse 14 these are some very familiar scriptures that were reading this morning and we're going to bring a very simple thought to you this morning my heart my desire you know as I prayed I want what the Lord wants I want to say what he wants but what just kept one up within me is that I want us to be encouraged in the Lord today I want us to be encouraged in where we stand I want us to know that our foothold is sure that our God cannot fail and if you're in him you cannot fail 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 14 for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord amen may God and His blessings to the reading of the word you may have your seats what a wonderful promise we read here in the scripture that we are going to be caught up together with them and the clouds to meet the Lord I believe that's all that's what we're all living for today I believe that's the reason that we press on today I believe that's the reason that we get up each and every day and take another step we're looking for that fulfillment of that promise we're looking for the new body and the body change and that sweep to come in and come across our our body we're looking for that day when when we brush in our teeth maybe and we look up in the mirror and standing there with this as one of our loved ones gone on before what a day that'll be what a day when somebody walks past and you and you recognize them and you go was that was that who I think it was and then you'll feel that sweep begin to come across your body that's the day I believe that we're all living for I believe that we're right here at the rapture of the church I believe that we're that that the shout has gone forth I believe that it's lamp trimming time I believe it's exodus time I believe we're right here in the past so / and and it's so important as we've heard preached over and over again to make sure you're under the blood make sure that your life is ready and I know today that preaching to a congregation like this that there's people here in all walks of life there we're all in different stages of our walk with the Lord but I'm going to preach to you this morning not as if you're a beginner not as if you're backslidden not as if you've way on down the road but we're preaching to all of us as though we're seed of Abraham bottom line it doesn't matter where you at we're seed of Abraham and what you need to do today is just take another step and claim your promise and say I'm seed of Abraham that's who I am it's not about I was saved last week or I'm struggling or I'm up and down I'm telling you today your seed of Abraham and Satan hates that revelation in your heart he doesn't ever want you to come to the point that you realized I am gods I belong to God because once you get that first step and you recognize that then there's no power in hell that can keep you from obtaining the promises that he has for you because you begin to recognize it's mine it's always been mine it belongs to me because I am seed of Abraham and that's who we are today and that's how we're going to approach this but as I said I believe this shout is gone forth and we're right here on the cusp of the coming of the Lord but it's at this time not that we get close to the coming of the Lord and things begin to get easy that's not how this is going to work as we get here right to the coming of the Lord that's when the battle is going to rage harder than it's ever raised before okay but I'm telling you today that no matter how the battle rages no matter what happens we shall remain and that's what we're going to preach on today that's our that's our topic we're gonna preach on we shall remain Satan's Kingdom has reached its zenith the height of the tree of knowledge of good and evil has has come to full maturity it's more evil than it's ever been in the world all around us but we are not to be dismayed by the power of Satan's Kingdom because we are specifically called to tear satan's kingdom down we are not to be dismayed by the maturity of the tree of knowledge of good and evil because I'm telling you at the same time there's another tree that has reached maturity the tree of life been revealed to us in a way has never been revealed before it's reached full maturity you can see the entire picture the the broad tree has been restored back let the cankerworm and the Caterpillar and all those had eaten it's been restored back so it's not just the tree of knowledge of good and evil that has reached its full potential but there's a broad tree that's reached its full potential there's a broad tree that's going forth in the power and the glory of her mate the Lord Jesus Christ we're not worried about the evil in the world we're not caught off guard by how bad things are we expect those things those things are reaching their height those things are reaching their maturity but the bride of Jesus Christ is also reaching her height she's also reaching her maturity where she recognizes the power that she has to operate in the Lord Jesus Christ we're not to be worried by the evil because we have a promise that when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will raise a standard up against it we're told here in Ephesians 2 put on the whole armour of God to round ourselves with the Word of God to make it a cloak that wraps around us so that we're able to stand against the wiles of the devil what are wild wild our cunning arts deceit craft and trickery look he doesn't usually just show up and say I'm the devil and here's what I'm here to do to you he's very cunning he's full of tricks he's full of this seat - were many times were caught up in a snare were caught up in a trap and it's not - we're days or weeks or months into it which here we go oh the devil laid a trap oh I see we're on this step because we didn't recognize it because we stepped into a situation of deceit we stepped into a situation of trickery because that's how he works it's the wiles of the enemy now it's not always the devil that gets us in bad situations a lot of times it's that other d-word decisions decisions that we make and things that we do without going to the Lord and prayer without taking things to him we just think well things are going good hey that looks good oh yeah let me just take that job or just let me do this or let me move here and let me do that and we end up in a world of trouble because we make decisions without seeking the leadership of the Lord so it says put on the whole armour of God that you can with style.the withstand the cunning hearts withstand the deceit withstand the craft withstand the trickery so that the scripture here does identifies our enemy as the devil that's who our enemy is today listen it's not flesh and blood all right no matter what your situation is today you need to remember something your enemy is not flesh and blood your enemy is not your brother your enemy is not your sister it doesn't matter if it's your brother or sister that has made you mad that is not your enemy your enemy is not your husband today your enemy is not your wife your enemy is the devil and if we can get our focus back on that and get our guns and get our arrows and get our weapons and our Barb's and our hurtful things turned away from flesh and blood and point them back to who our enemy is the devil we might be getting somewhere but it's hard to press forward and it's hard to take another step it's hard to grow in the Lord when the enemy is there and we're fighting each other our enemy is not our brother our enemy is the devil our enemy our principalities and powers and rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness in high places that's who our enemy is and he is a formidable foe the scripture goes on to foreshadow the difficulty of the coming battle when it says having done all to stand now they didn't say you know when you get through standing it's gonna it says having done all that means you're going to have to do everything in your power to stand that means you're going to have to give it everything you've got that means when it seems like you've been forsaken when nobody's standing with you when you don't have any streets left in your body Oh having done everything you know to do to stand it says and therefore when you've given everything when you've sold out when you've given every single effort you can give see this isn't a halfway battle Church this isn't a halfway battle that win this isn't play-fighting this is all or nothing this is everything or nothing the enemy is not coming at you halfway you can't stand and face the enemy halfway he's not coming at you with little little bitty jabs and little bitty things and just seeing if this will bother you a little bit or that'll bother you a little bit that's not how he's coming he's coming at you I went through deceit and trickery and when he gets you where he wants he's coming with the full assault he's coming to destroy you he's not coming to play games and you can't play games with him it's all or nothing haven't done all to stand haven't done all to stand everything within your power Jesus said that the gates of Hell will not prevail against his church brother Brandon would look at this and say this is foreshadowing showing that the gates of hell would be against it the gates of hell won't that shows that the gates of hell will be against it what what bring it down just a step further it's not just the gates of hell or against the church it's not just the gates of Hell there gets to a world-wide body a group of people known as the bride of Jesus Christ the gates of hell or against you the gates of hell or against you as an individual your individual wall your a relationship with the Lord your relationship with your brothers and sisters your family relationship your a relationship with your children he's against you in every aspect of your life that you can think of he wants to destroy it the gates of hell or against you what does this mean the gates of hell is not speaking of some iron gates or some big you know dark black iron gates that enters into the gates and those gates of hailer against you it's not even talking about a doorway or an entrance into hell the greek word underlined our English translation for gates is pool a and gates here is actually a good translation for the word pool a however in Strong's Greek concordance and in the Greek lexicon of new tests it indicates that Poulet in antiquity was used to indicate authority and power the word typically refers to an exit that people go through so here in this sense it means all the authority and power that proceeds out of hell so what is against you every demon power every power of Darkness every single thing that the devil can conjure up everything that can come forth out of Hell is against you and yet it tells you it doesn't tell you now when you see this coming you better duck and run because that's a lot of power when you see this coming you better duck and run because I'm not sure you can withstand it it says having done all to stand you stand there for I've been done all to stand Satan you've hit me a bunch of times I'm worn out I'm beat down but in Jesus name I press on I will stand therefore regardless of the attack of the enemy I don't care how dark it is this one left that ones ridicule and this one's talking about the message in making videos by Allah but I'm going to stand right here and then I will stand some more when I've done all to stand this is an all-in battle this is all or nothing life or death heaven or hell everything is on the line and the gates of hell are after you this morning what do i do what do I do brother Aaron the gates of Hell are after me how do I stand you got to put on the whole armour of God that's the only way you're going to be able to stand it's the only way brother Brendan would say and as the battle rages you become a real target look when you weren't in the battle you weren't a target there wasn't anybody shooting at you there weren't any fiery darts being thrown your way you weren't in the battle but brother Brown says now when you're in the battle you become a real target so there's only one thing to do you got to put on the whole armor of faith stand true to God stand true I want us to think about that all day we will stand true no matter what I will be found standing true if there's a theme today if we will remain it's that we will stand true we will remain true no matter what doctrines come what doctors go we will stand true upon the unadulterated Word of God you must stand true to God and march forward that's all God's army does not retreat Church we cannot retreat if you retreat you're just going to get shot in the back and you're going to end up dead anyway alright if I die let it be known that I died facing the enemy if I went down let it be known that I went down standing up no matter what you nettle no I stood there it doesn't matter I will remain it doesn't matter if I go by the way of the grave they will say he remained in his day he stood the test of time he was true to the word I will face the enemy at all cost never turn your back upon the enemy God's army does not retreat it goes on many of them drop off to the side and start this that or the other but the army of God marches forward we're going right on and on he says all we have a word for us at this time it's hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God use every weapon he has given us he says use every gift that our disposal with the people that don't believe in the gifts I don't know what they're gonna do with that he said use every gift at our disposal God gave those gifts for it reason he doesn't do anything without a purpose use the gifts at our disposal don't be afraid to operate a gift if it's in your life as a matter of fact you'll be held responsible for not using the gift if he gave you that and you don't use it use every gift at our disposal he says use every weapon use every gift and look ahead with joy because we're going to be crowned by him who is king of kings and Lord of lords that's enough for me to go on with joy knowing at the end of this at the end of the battle at the end of the fight at the end of the hardships I'm gonna be crowned by him who is king of kings and Lord of lords I'm telling you it'll be worth it all I'm telling you whatever your struggle is today will be nothing it will not be remembered you won't even care that day when he says well done my good and faithful servant that's reason enough to stand that's reason enough to go forward and joy and having done all to stand stand even in lights hibernacula when you feel defeated stand when you feel beat down stand when you feel like you've given everything you have to give stand when you feel like you can't go on stand if you'll do this you have a promise the gates of Hell will not prevail against you the gates of hell we sum that up that's anything and everything the devil can throw at you so you can take your story which I'm sure is an awful one I don't say that to to minimize what you're going through my goodness human trials are tough the battles we go through are tough they're hard and sometimes they get us beat down but I'm telling you that that battled that trial that you're going through that fits right in there in the gates of hell that's where it come from and I'm telling you it shall not prevail against you lift your head up this morning seed of Abraham lift your head up your Redemption draweth nigh lift your head up and march on lift your head up and take another step the gates of hell shall not prevail against you [Applause] be all in half of the armors not going to save you look you can be a pretty good Christian you can put on a lot of the things the word tells you to put on and you can die in battle because half of the armor will not save you half way fighting is not going to defeat the enemy a half way life and Laodicea is not going to overcome half way in anything in this Christian walk is a backslidden lukewarm cold informal life and it's not going to take you in a rapture matter of fact it's not even going to allow you to keep holding on as times get tougher and as the squeeze gets tighter and twice tighter as the as the spirits press in harder and harder if you're not sold out if you haven't given everything you will fall away but I'm talking to seed of Abraham this morning I'm talking to men and women who will remain I'm talking to men and women that on that day they can say I stood true if surrender is an option in your heart you will eventually take it understand that if surrender is an option in your heart you will eventually take it you must be determined I will not give up I will not back down I will remain and thinking of this was surrender being an option y'all know I enjoy history and reading things in history and my mind goes back to the start of the Texas Revolution and the Battle of the Alamo and most of you know the story well it's something that many of us are taught in history books are told stories of how that Colonel Travis they're realizing that their days were numbered and that defeat was almost sure how he drew a line in the sand and he asked all the men there who would join him who would come across that line who was willing to stay and fight even though the odds look so terrible and what I love about the story is if you actually listen to the speech that Travis gave that they record as what he supposedly said after he drew the line in the sand was it doesn't matter if any of you cross this line I'll hold no hard wheel against you but understand it doesn't matter what you do I'm staying it doesn't matter if I have to face this entire Mexican army by myself I'm staying and he told them that no matter is not what happens retreat is not an option in my heart and if we can get that out of two down in our heart this morning look if daddy doesn't go I'm going if mama doesn't go I'm going if my brother don't go I'm going if my sister don't go I'm going but let me tell you I'm gonna fight for you the whole time I'm gonna try to bring you along with me but at the end of the day you got a crew look across that line yourself at the end of the day you got to make the decision because if it's in your heart to surrender if it's in your heart to retreat then when you're surrounded and the battles not going the way you thought it would go you will turn and run but when it's not an option when you put the line in the sand you say I will stand right here and when I've done all to stand I'm going to keep standing then when the fiery darts of the enemy come when you stand for Jesus Christ he will stand for you you will be victorious but you got to stand through the moments that look bleak you got to stand through the moments that look dark Travis had already made up his mind I don't care if y'all go I don't care if y'all stay I'm staying it's the kind of determination that we as the Bride of Christ must have before this in late February 1836 Travis wrote a letter I love this this letter you actually see it if you ever visit the Alamo there's a plaque there with this letter it's just considered a great moving letter that he wrote it's now considered a great piece of history just days before the final stand of the Alamo he says to the people of Texas and all Americans in the world fellow citizens and compatriots I am besieged can you say that this morning I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man we have sustained bombardment we have sustained cannon fire we have sustained sickness we have the sustained depression there's been all kind of things come against us but I'm just letting y'all know out there we're still standing I'm just letting y'all know out there we hadn't give up I'm just letting you know that we're still in here fighting he says the enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion otherwise the garrison are to be put to the sword if the fort is taken Satan says you better surrender you better give up right now look quit now and I'll let you live that's a lie Satan cane tall for life Satan can't offer anything but death and that's the thing those men inside the Alamo knew that even surrender meant certain death so look surrender is not an option because even surrender brings that the only option is to stand and have victory victory is the only option for the Bride of Christ you won't like stand and fight you want to turn a life stand and fight you want your healing stand and fight your retreat is not an option he says the garrison are to be put to the sword if the fort is taken I have answered the demand with a cannon shot whoo I like it surrender boom take that for an answer you think we're going to surrender this morning devil boom but lower the boom moaning this morning he's got you surrounded he says here's your chance you can surrender I say I will not surrender I will be a part of the alive and remain I won't back down boom fire boom cannon add in this morning of faith many know I'm still standing I'm still standing Oh answer the devil this morning he says I've answered with the cannon-shot and our flag still weighs proudly from the walls I shall never surrender or retreat I'll say the banner of Jesus Christ still weighs proudly from these balls we shall not surrender nor shall we ever retreat Oh glory our flag stay away from these walls oh we're surrounded by thousands 200 million do you surrender flag still waves proudly from these walls give the devil an answer he don't expect this morning then I call on you in the name of Liberty of patriotism and everything dear to the American character to come to our aid with all dispatch the enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand and four or five days if this call is neglected now understand he was under no grand illusion that they were about to be saved this man stood with this courage all these men knowing they would not be saved think about that knowing that when they just have to cross that line they had just a few breaths left they had a few days left and they were willing to do it for a little old building out in the middle of the desert because it was about honor is about principle it was about what they believed was their god-given rights listen we ain't waiting on reinforcements to show up they're here this morning we're not waiting on somebody to come and bail us out last minute this Adams race was bailed out 2,000 years ago Adams race the price was paid 2,000 years ago we're not waiting on reinforcements we're surrounded by reinforcements how do we not have the courage to stand when others stood in the face of death when others stood with no greater reward than to die certain death he says if this call is neglected I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country victory or death who had to stir something up within me I'm telling you victory or death victory or death he says PS the Lord is on our side [Music] there's more to the story the Lord is on our son he's here today he's in this building now you've been beat down in sinners and surrounded and attacked all week the devil says surrender surrender surrender yes the Lord is on our side hallelujah hallelujah you can't fall you can't lose you can't back up the Lord is on your side and if God be for us who can be against us hallelujah listen we know how that story ended they fought courageously for 13 days but in the end they all died with that letter began to circulate actually before the Alamo fell the letter began to circulate they said it went to New Orleans it quickly went up towards New York through DC into Boston all those places and it so began to rally the hearts of people begin to rally the hearts towards this place called Texas that most people had never been it would never go but they said it was just too far away for them to get there in time but they say the majority of Sam Houston's army that would defeat Santa Anna just weeks later at the Battle of San Jacinto was made up of people who had read that letter whose hearts were stirred and they said if they can do that if they can do that I'll go fight with people like that I'll go fight what does it do to people around you when you stand in the midst of a battle what's it done for this church when people go through the deepest darkest times when cancer strikes and you see somebody square their shoulders back and say I won't surrender I won't back down it begins to wail up something within you on the inside you begin to want to draw your sword and say I'll fight with somebody like that I'll stand with people like the people that even in like tabernacle I'll stand no matter what the situation they were fighting for nothing more than a state for a piece of land we're fighting for the souls of men and women fighting for eternal life I'll stand with people like that what to do when you see somebody stand in the face of a John what happened when David killed Goliath you raised that hand the children of Israel got fired up they drew their swords and Men who the day before were cowards hiding in their tent they charged the battlefield they charged the enemy they chased the Philistines you stand against your glass stand against your enemy and say I won't back down and watch your rally the troops stand there for a Travis wrote to all the Americans in the world what he said to all Americans in the world I ain't talking to Americans well I am but I'm calling upon the believers of this endtime message all over the world no matter where you may be take your stand upon this message it's worth standing for it's worth fighting for it's worth dying for it is the absolute truth it has changed my life the Lord Jesus Christ has saved my soul he has healed my body he has delivered me he has delivered you it's worth standing for it's worth my fighting for message believers around the world I call on you to stand today in the face of evil stand today in the face of ridicule stand today in the face of those that won't cross the line with you but cross the line and say here I will stand here I will fight I will not back down but I will remain I will remain hallelujah let that be my testimony one day he remained in the face of battle he remained she remained he stood she stood hallelujah my jacket won't fit under that pulpit like those other guys sorry glory to God they did it for Texas what greater calls them the cause of Christ who cares what the cost is though it costs me my life I'll stand for the cause of Christ though it cost me my life I'll fight for my children though it cost me my life I will fight for my marriage though it costs me my life I will fight for everything God has given me listen let me tell you something Christians do not quit Christian's do not give up they will do whatever it takes to keep fighting but this looks like it's gonna be years of fighting okay the Lord's on your side he will strengthen you he will give you the courage he will give you what you need to make it through those years of fighting what greater causing the cause of Christ I'm telling you it's time for some people in this church I don't mean this negatively I mean this genuinely for all of us we're at the moment - if some of us need a line in the sand moment what am I gonna do am I gonna stand and go all out or am I gonna be halfway am i gonna stand and go out or am I going to continue to be one that sees all the problems and faults within the church am I gonna stand and go all out listen I guarantee you I guarantee you that those 189 men and the Alamo didn't all love one another it was some rough people inside those walls but when it came down to it a bunch of men who were rough tumble frontiersman and I don't know maybe some of them knew Jesus I don't know but I guarantee you they didn't all love one another and they said I'll die with you I'll fight with you I'll stand with you for Texas and all we got to do is lay aside some of our bitterness and lay aside some of our dislike lay aside some of our problem and fault-finding so we can stand for the cause of Christ I say shame on us if we can't shame on us if we can quit playing the part of the accuser and quit seeing everything through the eyes of the accuser and finding fault in everybody the problem is people usually start seeing faults and everybody else to keep from addressing the majority of faults within them selves how do you know that because I've done it I'll always be real with you cuz I've done it when I find myself focused on what's wrong with everybody else and what's the reason everything is everybody else's problem I realize I'm not where I need to be with God I realize I need to get down on my knees because when Peter was looking at Jesus he didn't see the waves they were there listen let's be honest your problems were there my problems are there but if my eyes are on Jesus if they're on things of above if I'm busy fighting the enemy I don't got time to worry about what your problem is because your problem really ain't hindering me anyway my problems hinder me my flesh hinder me if those men can lay it aside and say I'll fight for Texas I think we can lay things aside so I'll fight for the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll lay aside my problems my issues the way I've used situations my own thinking about how things ought to be and who this and who that and why is that person getting to singing in church why do you care get your eyes back on Jesus and let's march forward that was free it's time for a line in the sand listen there's a promise given 1st Thessalonians 4:17 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and listen to brother Branham hear he says you're always pointing out how wicked the world's getting but you fail to see how powerful the church is at getting at the same time she's rising up standing over the field oh she's a little flock but brother God's with her that settles it right there we could dismiss and go home and say this week's gonna be awesome God's with me God is with me he said God's with her and she's going now listen these words there's no question she's going to triumph just as certain as Christ rose from the dead amen God's church shall never fail the gates of hell shall not prevail against it it showed they'd be against it but they cannot prevail the church is going to triumph through the blood of Jesus Christ to the victory march I'm positive this one thing God will have a church tonight without spot wrinkle or blemish amen I'm so happy about them I'm so happy about that today God will have a church that's not up for debate that's not up for question you are seed of Abraham you're a part of that church let's quit going well if this happens and if I get that you're a part of that church he's talking to you today let's throw the doubts away let's throw our little complexes away let's throw I'm not good enough away look that I'm not good enough usually just an excuse to not enter all the way in throw it aside step on in you're good enough you're bought with the price through the blood of Jesus Christ sanctified justified he filled you with the Holy Ghost he's talking about you just deal with it just accept it and say I'm going to accept it I will triumph I will overcome I will remain he's talking about me this morning but you must be determined to remain the scripture doesn't just mean that everyone's still breathing and left alive is going to be caught up to meet the Lord everybody who's alive and remain every single day has got oxygen and still here is going in a rapture that's not what it means we could look at the word alive there physically or spiritually but we're going to focus today on those who remain to remain means many things it can mean unused it can mean leftover it can mean stay behind and we don't want to be any of those I don't want to be unused I don't want to be leftover and I definitely don't want to stay behind I read something that just blew my mind when I was studying for this service and I don't take it as the gospel but a lot of times I'll read different Jewish historians and histories and traditions and things and by some estimates certain Jewish historians write that only to out of every five Israelites left Egypt that the others chose to stay think about that that the others remained that's not the kind of remain we're talking about this morning I'm not telling you that you need to remain where you are I'm telling you you need to remain on the journey which means you're moving you're pressing your standing true you are remaining that's what we're talking about today the other synonyms for the word remain is to endure to last to abide to go on to carry on to persist to stand to hold out and to prevail we must be alive and standing you must be alive and standing for truth to go in the rapture you must be alive and enduring to go in the rapture you must be alive and prevailing you must remain our battle vs Satan we know is not a new battle and I want to take a minute and just go down through history for a moment down through the ages down through the church ages and I'll try to go as quick as I possibly can but our battle versus Satan is not a new battle and it's not even a battle that began on earth we know that this battle began in heaven when Satan began to exalt his own will over the will of God it's a battle of wills God has a will that will always be fulfilled one way or the other Satan has a will God has plans Satan has plans and it's a battle of wills and plans and what can what's going to come to pass Satan had a will that was separate from God's will and he began to desire glory and he began to desire honor that belongs only to our guitar God and he kind of became impressed with himself I mean he was a big deal in heaven he was beautiful he was in charge of a lot of things and he kind of became impressed with himself so remember that the next time you started to think too highly of yourself where that kind of thinking comes from the next time you stand a little bit too long in the mirror I'm just saying some of us don't have that problem I sprint past mirrors as fast as I can which isn't very fast but I I don't like to be in a mirror too long but remember that if you start to think too highly of yourself that that's where that sin originated that pride began to build up in Satan's heart that he was he was more beautiful that he was more powerful that he deserved honor and he deserved glory and so that's where the sin began and and there's over time this sin would come down to earth and these battles would become human battles Satan began to glory in himself and we know that God hasn't cast out and brother Brandon would say in the greatest battle fault the great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then battles from angels become human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation now this is what Satan's plans and Satan's will is so we talked that he had won here it is Satan come to destroy God's creation when God had created it for his self he Satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose is to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and it began in us and it has been raging ever since so Satan's cast down and we know that according to Scripture he comes into the Garden of Eden even the scripture replaced him there in Ezekiel 28 13 it says thou has been in Eden the garden of God every precious stone was not covering the sardius topaz the diamond the barrel the Onyx the Jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of that tablets and of that pipes was prepared in thee in the day that that was created so he comes down into the Garden of Eden and wants his desire how do I get back how do I get back into a position of power I've lost it all I have nothing now how do I get back in how do I destroy God's creation how do I assert my authority over his creation how do I destroy his sons and daughters and he wants to destroy God's plan anger is built up in him and all he can think of is destroy destroy he wants his own kingdom he wants his own children and right off the bat it looks as though he was successful see that's what we said at the very beginning of the services Satan has plans and many times he executes those plans seemingly to perfection there are times you can look back and go Satan put this trap for me and I walked right into it and he executed that plan to perfection but he can't dictate the results he has plans but he can't dictate the results because God's plans and God's will will always come to pass brother Branham said through mercy God will change everything to make his will come to pass so the perfect will of God may have been is going to go just like this and end up where I wanted it but because Satan executed a plan and the permissive will of God then makes things do this but it still ends up right where he won't in his will is going to come to pass no matter what so right off the bat it looks as if Satan has been successful it looks like I all has been lost and Eve falls to the whispers of the enemy and it seems like it's over just when things were starting it seems like it's all over and it seems like Satan has accomplished his goal and he's become the Prince of the power of the air and and man has forfeited all that God gave him the book has now gone back into the hand of the original owner sickness death and dying now has reign over the whole earth but we learn a very important lesson early on in the story right off the bat what we learn is we serve a determined God we serve a God who is so termen when this happened he didn't give up on his plan we serve a god who's so determined that no matter what the devil has done to you he is not giving up on you this morning listen the devil thinks he's beat you down and put you in a mud hole and gods never gonna find you there God knows right where you're at this morning he has not given up on you he has not given up on you because you are seed of Abraham he has not given up on you because he paid the price for you he paid redemptions price he went to Calvary for you it doesn't matter this morning the stain of sin that it's upon your life it doesn't matter how far you feel like you've gone it doesn't matter what the devil is whispering in your ear right now know this God has not given up on you he is not giving up on this bride he is not giving up on you as an individual he is not giving up on your children neither should you give up on your children neither should you give up on your Christian walk neither should you let your weapon down and give up I'm telling you today God has not given up on you and God never gives up on his plans look Adam and Eve had just sold the world into sin and slavery I don't know what you've done but you didn't do that I don't know what you're guilty of today but you didn't do what they did and God didn't just cast them out and kick them out and say stay out I can't stand it you've ruined everything there's no hope for you you're gonna go in hell it's what you deserve I've made this perfect Eden for you but see that's what Satan wants you to think what happens when you stumble and you fall and he begins whispering in your head trying to make you think it's God see I gave you this perfect message and you couldn't live it and I gave you this and I've sent on this and you can't stand what's wrong with you you're no good you've crossed the line you're never gonna be safe that's not God that's not how God speaks to his children that's not how God speaks to Abraham said yes he will correct you but he'll tell you get back up my son get back up my daughter because I've made a way yeah that's not what I intended for you but it's okay get back up repent of it keep walking I've made a way that's how God operates so no matter what you've done you haven't done anything near as bad what Adam and Eve had done Adam and Eve but just given satan access back into and into the heavenly realms back to their seat of authority and look what our God says brother Brown says look at that now I see his shoulder stooping around his big body here comes an old bloody sheepskin running down those big manly legs tears is dripping off his cheeks padding on the top of Eva's head as she leans over on his bosom little Eve crying the tears padding down is mixed with blood running down her bosom what's the matter something's happened they can cry now they're mortal now they're dying now there you are I see God say depart out of my presence but he couldn't stand it I can see Adam start walking away and as he did I can hear something going what's this old bloody sheep skins better Brown's doing this flopping against his legs as he was going out I can see God who covers all space and time who has no beginning or ending I can see it all bottled down like a funnel coming down like this and one four little letter word l.o.v.e he couldn't see his children depart from him now why he had made the Covenant conditional with Adam but now he makes it unconditional said I will put enmity between the woman's seed and he would bruise the Serpent's head and so forth and he promised a savior right after the fall right after the great sin that cast us all into sin and slavery of Satan and he doesn't cast them down you haven't gone too far this morning you haven't done too much this morning a grace of God won't forgive won't repair won't fix won't lift you up to where he wants you to be he says but then when I see when poor little Eve looked over in the face of Adam and knowed that she had caused the fall of the human race she threw her arms are on Adam who was not deceived and listen I can hear them as they start going out come come bloody sheepskins beating against them their legs God the whole universe I can see it begin to come down like a funnel into the four-letter word l.o.v.e he just couldn't see them he loved them so well - he couldn't see them go and he said he put in between between her seed and the surf seed in that same clumping of them sheep skins that bloody beating again Stephen Adam as they went out of the Garden of Eden then the same blood of the Sun beat against his legs as he went to Calvary under with our sins upon him and the blood beating from his body carrying up yonder into Calvary Church he was determined that his plan wouldn't fail he was determined that you wouldn't fail when all seemed lost when darkness was all around when there was no way out sick succeed he said I will give my life for Aaron Oglesby I will not give up on him I will give my life for Joe Adams I will not give up on him I'll give my life for Sherman Thomas I won't give up on him I will give my life for whosoever will I will not give up on them this morning he is not giving up on you because his plan and his will will remain he says our God is a determined God God is determined when God makes up his mind to do anything it has to be that's a short quote but it's powerful when God makes up his mind to do anything it has to be so what are we worried about what are we worried about it has to be I'll have a church without spot or wrinkle it has to be Satan's full of lies and fears that he loves to put on people and one of the biggest ones that he loves to spout is that one you've gone too far you've gone too far and he'll tell you that you've crossed the line and he'll tell you that there's no help for you and God listen it's a liar he wouldn't even be telling you that God never talks to people that way listen if you had gone too far you would have zero desire for God you would not be here this morning or listening to this service if you'd gone too far you would have no desire forgotten to be honest with you sometimes that can't even be the perfect predictor because I'm telling you most days I bet Legion didn't have a desire for God but all it took was one moment listen your loved one hadn't gone as far as Legion went you haven't gone as far as Legion went all it takes is one moment of him or her going god I need you one moment and he'll cross seas for that soul one moment and he'll cross seas for you you haven't gone that far your daughter your loved one hasn't gone as far as Mary Magdalene went they haven't reached the depths of sin that Mary Magdalene went but she hadn't gone to for one moment in his presence and everything changed one moment his but you don't know the sin they're in you don't know the lifestyle they're living you don't understand I know how Mary Magdalene lived and I know that he made her the very first living witness when he rose from the tomb she was the witness that came out said he's alive he's alive and I'm telling you your young person your loved one one day they may come home and say he's alive mama he's alive he made it real to me he's alive in my heart he can make your loved one a living witness that he's risen from the tombs it doesn't matter how far they go they have not crossed the line you have not crossed the line there's grace for you still brother Branham says Satan cannot keep revelation down when the spirit wants to give it that's good right there he cannot keep revelation down when the spirit wants to get listen darkness upon darkness upon darkness upon darkness can't keep the light of God's word from shining when it's time when it's time to shine that light or pierce every darkness it'll cut through every doubt every fear and unbelief listen darkness upon darkness upon darkness can't keep your promise from coming to pass when it's time you're holding on to something just keep holding on if it's God's will and I believe it is he will not withhold any good thing from you you just keep holding on when it's time darkness upon darkness upon darkness cannot hinder it from going forth light shining in darkness and darkness don't know what to do with it darkness can't stop light it's not [Music] we serve a determined God he wants to determine people we realize of course that it's only through our trust and faith in him that we're able to remain I understand that I understand that it's all through him I understand that it's all his promises I understand it's all his strength when we're weak he is strong I understand that but there's a part that you got to play there's a certain grip that he expects out of his people there's a certain determination a certain resolve he expects you to have a backbone because he'll move on the scene for you when you've done all to stand okay when you don't stand he has no opportunity to move but when you've done all to stand when you've showed your backbone you've shown your resolve then he will move on the scene for you every time and I'm telling you today whether you realize it or not every single one of you have that grit every single one of you have that resolve every single one of you have that backbone it takes longer to show up in some people than others it took many years for it showed up in my own life all right once again I know what I'm talking about there's times you don't realize you have it there's times you don't know what's within you there's many times Shamgar let him take all his crops because he didn't know what was within him but on the day that the revelation struck on the day that had dropped down within his heart that I am a seed of Abraham remember your seed of Abraham when it struck down in his heart that I am a part of the covenant people and you're a part of the covenant people then the odds didn't matter the amount of devils didn't matter the sickness didn't matter none of that mattered because he had a promise that he had a covenant and now there was something that welled up within him that he didn't even know was there and today you may not even know the courage that you had you may not even know the backbone you had but it's there it's there I believe that for you even if you can't believe it right now I believe it's there sometimes this old flesh gets in the way and sometimes it takes longer to show up but that predestinated seed deep down on the inside of you it's the real you and it won't let you quit you feel like you have no courage but for some reason you can't ever quit you feel like that you can't do anything right but for some reason you can't ever quit it won't ever let you give up it won't ever let you even though this flesh wants to and you're like I'm tired I can't go on your mind as a grin yep that's right you're tired you can't I don't know if I can go on and yet you get up and you go on you get up and you take another step you get up and you keep pressing on you get up and you remain because there's something inside of you it's a predestinated seed gene of God that will not let you quit it will not let you fall it will not let you fail you will remain till the end you can't help it I'm glad it's not relying on me I'd have probably quit a long time ago but I can't help it something keeps holding me something keeps dragging me along something keeps building up on the inside of me that says that's true that's true keep walking keep fighting that's true there's victory just ahead if there's a rapture just ahead but I don't know keep going keep fighting it's pushing me and it's welling up on the inside I can't help it something deep down says keep walking keep fighting and that's what we've seen in the elect down through the ages someone there's someone go real quick now and skip over but Satan's always tried to destroy the seed of God in every age and the seed just kept moving on see just kept moving on it remained through every circumstance in Noah's time Satan made it so evil that God said I'm gonna destroy a man who I created for it repents me that I've even made them you think it's bad in this day and that day one man remained one and against all odds against every ridicule he stood he remained right there with his ark right there with his message this is truth he was outnumbered he was scoffed at he remained the plan of God will always continue despite Satan's efforts look we could point to many that stood through tough times and remained true despite all the devil through Adam David stood in the face of a John Daniel stood in a strange land all alone stood in the face of the lion's den' threat of death he remained true separated from all the other believers even into the lives then he went the three Hebrew children stood even under penalty of death they would not bow to an they wouldn't bow to an image even though that image was made in the image of a prophet they weren't gonna stand and bow to an image of a prophet they weren't gonna worship a prophet it didn't matter how holy he was and how how wonderful God had used the man and how respected he was they were to have no other Idol no other God before their God and they weren't going to bow before the image of a prophet and then I say the same goes for people today we serve one true Living God and we're not going to bow before any idol regardless of what that idol may be brother Branham says the time came for Shadrach Meshach and Abednego just show their colors show their face so they turned their back to the image they said our God is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace but nevertheless we will not bow down to the image there it was it was time the season was there so the time came that when he was going to throw them into the fiery furnace burn that religion out of them that's what the devil tries to do all the time burn you up on something make you sicker when you're prayed for make you think you've lost your experience some of you that's had a new experience with God you hadn't lost your experience you did get exactly what you said you got that's the devil lyin to you some of you that's been walking with God all these years and he's telling you all of a sudden you don't have the Holy Ghost that's the devil lyin to you you keep walking you keep trusting you do not back off the promise God gave you do not back off your testimony if you said you were healed you're healed you stand there you said the Lord filled me with the spirit you're the one who knows the devil don't know you were there you were there when it happened you remember how your life changed don't let him talk you out of anything he tries to burn us out on things he tries to make you think you've lost your experience he's lying to you the time comes when you have to stand on God's Word and stand alone that comes for every one of us there will come a time when you must stand alone and maybe it's just you and the devil standing there because when it comes time for those battles you have to know that you know that you know when the hour gets dark brother Gary that anchor holds dawning when you have to stand alone the anchor will hold I promise you the anchor is held down through the ages it held all the way down it held for no it held for Daniel and held for the three Hebrew children it held for Shamgar and it'll hold for you today he said there's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself between your feelings and your faith that time is tonight I believe that as time that we separate our feelings from our faith the Word says so that settles it that's the end of it his word will be fulfilled on and on it goes time after time we see it when everyone else quits the seat of God presses on when everything seems to be against you and the odds are stacked against God's children when it's the darkest hour there's always someone who says I will remain God will always have his hand a person he can put his hand on God will always have a testimony upon the earth God's plan will always march forward and it doesn't matter what Satan does somebody's going to end or somebody's going to persevere the elect of God will always stand against the power of darkness but in the end Satan doesn't give up he never gives up and we come on down through history and time after time Satan feels like he was so close to overthrowing God's program so close he was right there oh I thought I had oh oh I thought I had him he's always right there right on the edge but our gods always one step ahead of him our gods always one step ahead of our God knows the end from the beginning that dumb old devil ain't figured out yet that wait this God knows what I'm about to do wait a minute this God knows exactly the turn I'm fitting to make he knows and so he keeps his hand upon your life even though you don't see that turn coming God knows that turns coming God keeps his hand upon unit Satan looked like he had it all defeated so close to causing everything to cave-in only to have somebody stand in his face I'm proud to be one that's standing in his face and his own even standing for righteousness but we come down to a crucial time about two thousand years ago when it seemed like mankind could not go on when it seemed like Satan finally had the world in total and complete disarray and I love these quotes right here now Adams race was all in bondage there they were without hope without God without chance without mercy without anything that could help them the great enemies of the lower region of the loss had them shut up in darkness there was not a way out there was no one could help nothing could be done it looked like a total complete loss that is worse than the situation you're in Adams race was backed into a corner where the law and the judgments and the prophets and everything that had been sent had failed nothing could be done human race was doomed the great armies of hell was marching on will trained and in their ranks every man to his place they backed Adams children into a corner where they could go no further they sent the law they couldn't keep it they sent judgments they wouldn't listen to it they plunged right on they sent prophets and they stoned them nothing could be done but in glory one day the most precious thing of heaven stepped out before the angels of God and said this day I will give my life for the sons of Adam this day I will do something that will break the ranks of the enemy I'm so glad that than when there was no hope for me he said this day I'll step up for you this day I'll break the hold of the enemy upon your life this day I'm gonna step forward this day I'll give my life and it says I can just see him go to the door Satan walked to the door and said so you finally got here did you yes I'm here I thought I had you when I killed Abel I was sure I had you when I threw Daniel in the lion's den when I behead it John I thought I had you when you was on the cross I thought I had you but finally you've arrived this is clearly a case of him not realizing what he was getting this was clearly a case of him not realizing what he was in for because this idiot celebrating the fact that his kingdoms just been destroyed he's celebrating the fact that he's taking the greatest whoopin anybody has ever taken in the history of the world he is celebrating the fact that he just brought the one down that's going to loose every sinner he'll every sickness deliver the bound set you free he's celebrating it he's going I'm glad you're here look that's what I'm glad he was there too I'm glad he showed up for me so I don't have to go there he showed up for me and he showed up for you and he said yes I've arrived and I've arrived with one purpose you have put fear and chills on the people long enough I've come down to take over that's right Satan said oh but I've got a right Adam sinned Jesus said but my blood still wet on the cross and it paid for that sin yes sir I come down to take over give me the keys of death and he'll he grabbed the keys from death and he'll said give me those keys I like this part he says he reached over and grabbed Satan by the neck whew how many times I'd like to do that he said he reached over and grabbed Satan by the neck threw him on the ground put his foot on his throat and he said you fooled people long enough get back in there where you belong he says I'm the boss now my Bloods been shed up there on the cross you can't keep them here any longer there will be people who believe in me you can't bind them with sickness you can't bind them with fear they will believe hallelujah oh what a conqueror we serve the one that we fear the one that brings trembling the one that brings dread in the night he just grabbed him by the neck fooling that put his foot there said I'm the boss now how about you do that this morning reach out and grab ahold of that fear grab ahold of that depression grab ahold of that anxiety whatever is tormenting you grab it throw it down put your foot there and say I'm the boss now because he shed his blood on Calvary for me he gives you that right God's purpose will be fulfilled every time see Satan's got plans sometimes we're not very good how's the dumb one and God has plans Satan has will God has will God's will will be fulfilled every single time but what am i preaching to you today listen Satan's plans for you don't matter the lies that he's whispering in your ear they don't matter he says you're gonna give up he says you're not gonna make it he says you're not gonna make it in he says I'm gonna take your life he says you're not even saved listen he don't get a vote [Music] I'm not sure how well versed y'all are on civics but this is not a democracy this is a monarchy which is ruled by a king and the King makes the decision and the King says you're sealed the King says you're saved the King says I have forgiven you the King says I have healed you the key says you can go free the King says you don't have to be in bondage anymore Satan doesn't get a vote about your life there's only one vote there's only one voice there's only one that matters and he says you're free this morning he says you're victorious this morning he says you're an overcomer this morning and he's the only one that matters it's the only voice that matters passed down the lies of Satan cast down those lies his vote doesn't count it's voter fraud it's voter fraud it doesn't count this is a monarchy and our King says you're saved and you will remain blessed be the name of the Lord you will stand true you are going to overcome because every time Satan tries to put something on you our God is right there to give us the strength we need to overcome it listen his plans mean nothing when the Lord has other plans Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat there's his plans but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not oh man how wholesome he prayed for it for Peter I wish he had prayed for me he did he prayed for you even in several places in scripture Luke 22 excuse me John 17 I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine well he was talking about the disciples okay I'll give you that verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word he has prayed for you Satan has desired to sift you as wheat but my God has prayed for you and I'm telling you Jesus didn't pray a prayer that wasn't going to be answered if he prayed a prayer I guarantee you you can count on it he has prayed for you you will stand you will remain because you belong to him Satan has been thwarted at every single turn they don't give up and here we are in his Eden and once again he's being thwarted by the bride of Jesus Christ he's being thwarted by little ladies saying I'm gonna press on he's being thwarted by somebody when Satan says I will destroy you says your words don't matter to me well you're sick your words don't matter to me you're gonna take this depression I will not take that depression because we stand and we remain see what Satan says hold zero wait let me show you in the scriptures Isaiah seven and five because Syria Ephraim and the son of Romania have taken evil counsel against them they've taken evil counsel against it let us go up against Judah and vex it try to make them be vexed and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it even the son of Tibia thus saith the Lord God it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass all these plans they made to go up in vex Judah and they get all these people together and we're gonna do this and we're gonna take evil counsel thus saith the Lord God it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass Satan said you're not going to make it he's going to destroy you your children go to hell I'm gonna bring you down to an early grave thus saith the Lord it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass Satan's whispering lies and telling you all these things it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass because I'm speaking to a people tonight this morning that shall remain from the very day of Pentecost Satan began his attacks destroying trying to destroy the Church of God I'm going to skip all these but what I had was quote after quote from each church age showing where the false vine would stand up against the true vine and try to destroy it and every time it would get so close it would get so close to there's only a sliver of light there's only a few left remaining and and early on in the church we see grievious wolves come in among the church because Satan has his plans false doctrines began being preached different trinity doctrines false baptism hierarchies set up to rule over the people and in each age you see that the deeds of the Nicolaitans and things down through the Ephesian and as and pergamon all the way down and each one and yet the seed would always remain true brother Brent says with so many dishonouring God turning him into three gods and changing his precious name to titles one would wonder if the signs and wonders that attend such a great name would still be visited amongst the people indeed those signs were modely and warned we manifested though certainly not in the false-9 there were men like Martin man who stood true were greatly used and God bore witness both by signs and wonders and gifts of the Holy Ghost that that name was still as effective as it always has been and ever will be when the Saints honor him through the word and through faith he says the name of Jesus is just as effective as it's always been regardless today of your circumstance if you're willing to stand the name of Jesus is still effective when you're willing to remain the name of Jesus is still effective if you're willing to honor the name of Jesus and stand for truth God and the Spirit of God will move in your life the Spirit of God will move in our church if you're willing to stand for what Malachi 4 was sent to do Malachi 4 was sent to turn our hearts back to the original Pentecostal fathers there's many people today that are fighting against going back to that and they don't want to see those things move they don't want to see the spirit move they don't want to see the signs they don't want to see to see the wonders but if you're willing to stand for it you'll see those things move in our church and in your home individually and in your own in your own personal life and when our heart has turned back to the original Pentecost so so why then don't some see the moving of the Spirit why don't some believe in the moving of the Spirit because they haven't remained with what the word said about it they go to church they're religious but they haven't remained Judas remained until it was time to go to Pentecost and then he remained where he was he couldn't remain on the journey all the way up to Pentecost and listen while brother Branham had identifies the Judas spirit and that spirit of Judas will come right up and believe the Lord Jesus Christ like Jesus said the Devils believe in tremble he'll come right up and teach sanctification just as pure a holy life as it can be the Judas spirit will live just as pure and holy life as can be that's a shocking statement but listen but when it comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit he'll deny it and show his true colors every time brother Brennan said there's that spirit there's that spirit of Judas you have to remain with the word in every aspect I'm not saying every single person in this church has to run around the church shout and jump and speak in tongues we're not all wired that way we're not all gifted that way that's not what we're preaching we're not preaching emotionalism what we are preaching is a willingness to let God move how he sees fit a willingness to say God if that's how you want to move I by no means I'm going to get in the way I by no means I'm gonna try to put the brakes on I'm not going to be a spiritual fire extinguisher and sit there and try to quench everything going on in the church I want to remain true to what your word says and the word says those gifts will be amongst believers so lord I believe there amongst our congregation and when you want to use them Lord I'm ready to see you use them Lord if there's a gift in me that I'm not using Lord I want to use it lord I want to be willing and and malleable to do whatever it is you want to do that's what we're preaching a willingness to allow God to move and if we've learned anything God's will is going to be done regardless so you don't want to stand on the tracks when the train's coming because it's going to happen one way or the other and you want to be on the train not getting run over by the train make sure you're on the right side like brother Branham said when those people were dancing in his church and he said I thought they're gonna make my church into a tavern and he was going to say something but then he didn't and he said because what if they're right the Prophet said what if they're right and we need to take that approach sometimes when we criticize because if you are criticizing and they are right you're not criticizing them you're criticizing the moving of the holy spirit and the word speaks very bluntly indirectly about the punishment for that so hold your peace and hold your tongue when something maybe you don't understand because maybe they're right we move on so what about now we've talked about down through the ages we've talked about how the three Hebrew children stood how Daniel stood how Jesus came right at the moment of darkness but what about now Satan's Eden what about you down through every age Satan has waged a war and in every age someone has stood and every age despite the odds someone stood when it looked hopeless someone stood people would give their lives people will be burned at the stake people would stand no matter what nothing can move them off their testimony and because of that those people will be there I know we're talking about today those who are alive and remain but there are many of people that have gone by the way of the grade and they remained they remain true and because of that they're going to be there and their reward will be just as great brother Branham says what difference does it make if I'm living here or if I'm buried out yonder for if I'm already for I am already paid the penalty of death I'll be there before any man that's living that's right I say this 2nd Thessalonians 5th chapter I say this to you in the commandment of the Lord we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not hinder or prevent those that are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first so what difference does it make if I died in the time of Noah if I died in the time of Abraham if I died in the time of the Apostles or if I died two weeks ago or if I died right now what difference would it make I'll be there in a moment in a twinkling of an eye so even those that go by the way of the grave we know those testimonies of the people even within our own church that have gone and we can look at and say they remained they remain true they stood strong and we know they're going to be there and they're gonna be the ones that we even see before our bodies are changed but now those people have stood those people have remained and now it's our turn now it's our turn to stand and our battle is not going to be a flowery bed of ease no like I said early on that we've reached the height of Satan's Kingdom and I know the odds don't look good when we look around we see 200 million demons released from the river Euphrates we see the most evil age ever upon the face of the earth but the word said he was coming back for someone who is alive and remain so someone is going to remain in this evil day and as we've seen down through the ages it doesn't really matter how evil it is and it doesn't matter how dark the night when God is determined to do something it's going to happen so someone is going to over come to him that overcometh will I grant that means somebody's going to overcome somebody will remain because that's who he's coming back for and it's going to be those that are the seed of Abraham it's those that have been quickened to life and I'm preaching to you this morning because I believe that's who you are he said I'm gonna have a church without spotted wrinkle and he said that church would remain and I'm telling you tonight God's Word will be fulfilled that's not something to debate that's not something to argue about that's a fact Satan has tried from the beginning to stop the fulfillment of God's Word and from what I can tell it never really seems to work out well for him all right look at Israel over there if you want to talk about odds how do they stand there there's no reason for Israel to exist there's no reason logically for them to exist they have endured hardship like no other nation they have been endured Holocaust they have endured hatred they have endured attacks they are surrounded literally on every side that by people that want them to die and yet they remain because they're God's people and yet they remain because it's God's plan they remain because it's God's will and that's the exact same thing that goes for you today why are you even here against all odds here you stand in Laodicea against all odds when you're surrounded by 200 million demons why are they even still standing why are they even still here how is it even possible because you're God's people and it's God's will for you to be here it's God's plan that you would stand and nothing can come against that it's God's plan and if it's God's plan if God's on our side then nothing is going to deter that plan then odds don't matter numbers don't matter I will remain you I'm talking to you now against all odds stand here today and overcome her because it's God's plan look I'm preaching to a bunch of Caleb's today people that have stood and an enduring hardships you've stood when everybody else fell away and died in the wilderness you stood through trials and tribulations you stood through tests that many of us maybe could never even imagine we wouldn't even want to go through some of the things you've gone through you may not want to go some of the things that we've gone through we've all gone through so much but we're kaleb's at the end of the day here we stand through it all I still remain through it all I'm still sharpening my sword through it all I'm still saying give me my Mountain through it all I'm still saying give me my children through it all I'm still saying give me my healing through it all I'm still saying give me my new body give me my rapture give me my victory because I'm a caleb there's something within me that will not back down there's something within me that won't quit there's something within me that sisterís remained just remain keep pressing home then why do we listen to the devil's whisperers I'm going to ask that as we begin to bring this down why do we listen to the devil's whisper we've seen down through the ages he's Thornton he's Thornton he's Thornton in your life how many times have you seen it he's been thwarted he's been thwarted he tried to destroy you he's been through it he tried to do this he's been thwarted and in situations right now where it seems like he's executing a plan to perfection let me remind you he does not dictate the outcome let me remind you that that battle is not over and just because it looks right now that he's in control of the situation he does not control the outcome it will turn out for your good it will turn out for God's plan so why do we listen to his whisper you you've seen the anchor hold down through the ages you've seen it hold in your life look if we based it off of odd you say these odds aren't good if we based it off we wouldn't even be here to begin with is not about odds it's about if God be for us who can be against us you shouldn't be here and yet you are and to me I believe within my heart that it absolutely torments the devil that we're still here I think it absolutely drives him crazy that he can't make you fall but I'm telling you today that Satan's temptation is not stronger than God's election Satan's temptation is not stronger than God's election Satan's Eden will not overcome God's predestination I believe that predestinated seed will overcome the flesh every single time your flesh may be rising up and that's where Satan's attacking that's what he's pointing at but his temptation cannot overcome God's election and because of that you're going to remain but Satan continues to war and I call him the Whisperer he's always whispering in here here he's always whispering and there's a battle raging at all times there's been a battle raging in some of your minds even during this service raging for the minds of men there's depression and anxiety and fear listen he tells you you're not going to make it look he's been telling you some of you he's been telling you that you're going to quit and that you're not going to make it for the last 30 years and yet he's been telling you you're going to give up he's been telling you you're going to quit when are we going to quit giving credence to what he says because what his plans are for you don't matter Satan is 2019 and here I stand it's 2019 and I ain't going anywhere it's 2019 it's evil everywhere but I have a God who stands beside me and I will remain I will not quit I will not back down I meant overcomer I'm a seed of Abraham it's 2019 Here I am we gotta quit list he's been telling you for years you're not going to keep pressing on here we are still pressing the battle still pushing forward one of the things he loves to tell people you're not a very strong Christian how many as you ve ever told that he said you don't have very strong faith you're not a very strong Christian you don't have very then explain to me how in the middle of Satan's Eden you're still standing explain to me how you're still here you are picked handpicked by God for the closing laughs of the final race not only are you strong you are the strongest not only are you strong but you are an overcomer you are a devil defeater you let me give you a little bit of truth this morning let's give the devil a boon real quick you are a strong Christian you do have strong faith you are an overcomer you are going to go on a rapture this is your message it is for you he can't he is so tormented by the fact that they won't quit why won't they just quit I can't quit there's something within me that says I will remain until the coming of the Lord I just don't matter you remind him you know a lot of times we don't even know what fear is listen here's what furious here's one of the definitions a feeling of anxiety concerning the outcome of something a feeling of anxiety concerning the outcome of something so when the devil tries to bring three rat fear on you you tell him no no no I don't have to accept that because I know the outcome of this I read the story my ban I turned to the back of the book I looked ahead I hate to ruin this for you and I know you were coming to try to scare me and tell me that I wasn't gonna make it but let me tell you something when sickness is gone I will remain when the devil is gone I will remain when fear is gone I will remain throughout eternity I'm gonna remain when everyone in your demons are burning in the lake of fire I will remain down through eternity in the halls of glory I will remain you will remain because you are cold to it you are predestinated to it he says but you're going to follow my key field brother branham said this sieve is predestinated not to fall you can't fall you can't fail you're going to remain and when Satan's gone when his lies are gone when is deceit is gone glory to God ah will remain I'm gonna stand when I've done all the stand I'm gonna stand there for I'm gonna press the battle when all others around me may quit when all others may fall away when others laugh and others skull I'm gonna remain when the rapture comes when the last Trump sounds I'm gonna remain we shall remain because I'm predestinated to it listen you can't fail some of y'all didn't believe me you can't fail listen to your profit so Pentecostal people do you see that that's you these others can't believe in that they have nothing in them to believe with but the trouble of it is you've got it and don't know it if the devil if you can get he can hide it from you and not let you know you've got it and he's got you licked but if you can get Jesus is in the church tonight by the Holy Ghost doing and acting and performing the same things he did when he was here on earth you've received it have you received it we've received it you've got the Covenant it's written to you swore by God you can't fail that makes the devil mad sure does when you realize who you are don't fear about the child sister God has made it so don't fear about the baby sister don't do that just say God I now accept it it's my property I'm a believer I'll fill out this check today in Jesus name I accept it that's all then you can't fit now let the devil try to whisper to you now let the devil come try to tell you you're not going to make it when the Word of God says you can't help but make it you can't fail you can't help but be there and our God said he'll be with us even in us to the end of the world I'm telling you tonight all guns and Hill are trained against you but you can't fail this is Satan's Eden but you can't fail it's the most evil time ever but you can't fail oh he loves to talk to you when you're down he loves to talk to you when he thinks he's got you back in a corner he loves to talk to you when when he's seen you struggling in the night he loves to talk to you when he sees you go through a little cold spell we all struggle we all have moments and that's when he loves to come talk to you he loves to talk to you when he sees you pull back your worship a little bit in church oh he's watching so how they hadn't worshiped in three or four services they hadn't oh they're gone now they start to whisper he starts whispering to you in the night and he comes with you to church and he sits right there on your shoulder says this ain't talking about you he's talking look at those people they're shouting their rejoice and they're having a good time talking about them but you're not gonna make it you're not good enough and he loves to whisper and he loves to say there's no help for you in God there's no help for you but something whispers deep down in your soul says but Thou O Lord or a shield for me you're the glory and the lifter of my head and the devil sitting over there on your shoulder having a good time not realizing that something's starting to well up on the inside of you something's starting to well up he don't realize he's no more into an ambush and he's sitting there thinking he's having a good time you're not gonna make it there's no help for you and God but Thou O Lord are a shield for me the glory and the lifter of my head and he's sitting there and I say we catch the devil off guard a little bit this morning in a day that he thinks not I say we begin to worship the Lord and we begin to praise the Lord and we say Lord you're the lifter of my head Lord lift up my head from my sorrows lift up my head from looking at the trouble and you begin to praise and you begin to worship and you begin to lift up the king of kings and the Lord of lords and you begin to say thank you Lord that I'm still standing in 2019 thank you Lord that I can't fail thank you for saving me thank you for healing me thank you for giving me the baptism of the Holy Ghost and as you begin to praise the Spirit of God begins to move and it begins to lift up your head and you're no longer seeing your failures and your faults but you lift up your head and you say I will remain I will stand I will press on because he's been so good to me he's done so much for me how can I not stand for him he's the glory and the lifter of your head let the Spirit of God begin to move in your life begin to praise him in a moment when the devil thinks not in a moment when he thinks he's got you bound down and beat down just let your voice come out and say thank you Jesus thank you lord I Love You Lord Jesus you are my god you are my defender you are my shield and what's the Spirit of God begin to lift your head he's the glory in the lifter of my you say well I'm appraising when I see the walls fall I'm appraising when the chains come off that's not scriptural Joshua praised him then the walls fell Paul and Silas began to praise and then the chains fell off you want to have some freedom you want to have some joy Oh God set me free God set me free got him if you want freedom you start praising the Lord if you want freedom you start praising the Lord and calling out to God and when you praise him then the walls will fall then the chains will come off you have a part to play I'm bringing this to a close I'm skipping to the end Church in the evil time if you stand for him he will stand for you when no retreat is an option when your attitude is victory or death then he'll stand for you let us not forget who we serve we serve a God of War I do believe he's the God of peace within our souls and he brings us that peace but when your enemy in camps about you he is a God of War I believe in Hebrews 13:8 I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever and if we believe that let's look at Exodus 15 and 2 I can see the children of Israel standing at the Red Sea knowing that not all of them had came out some of them we're still in Egypt I can hear the whispers Satan was whispering in their heart I've told you you should have stayed they got all them garlic pots and they're eating real good and you about to dine this the ocean you stupid while you following this guy anyway and he's got the stick he's got stick I mean look at you good decision good call you decide to leave all that and here you are and now you're gonna die dummy I know you laugh but sometimes the devil tells you some funny stuff he says some stuff to me before that I was like really do you for real right now I was dumb and then sometimes he tells you things that makes you think and he's sitting there whispering to him you're gonna die look at the odds look at Pharaoh's army there's nowhere for you to go sometimes we feel that way but in the time of trouble he will hide you in his pavilion at the very last moment he's gonna snatch us out of here and he's gonna take us in a rapture the odds don't matter we serve a God of War Exodus 15 - they're backed up against the Red Sea there's nowhere to go and according to the enemy they're about to die the Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my god and I will prepare him a habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name no matter the situation you're in this morning hold on to this Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts has he cast into the sea his chosen captains are also drowned in the Red Sea the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone that right hand O Lord has become glorious in power my right hand O Lord have dashed in pieces the enemy and in the greatness of mine excellency thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee now sin is forth my wrath which consumed them as stubble and with the blast of thine nostrils the waters were gathered together in the flood stood upright as a heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will divide this ball my lust shall be satisfied upon them I will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them let's look once again his plans don't matter his plans for your life mean nothing these are his plans here's what he's going to do to you he's going to pursue he's going to overtake his hand shall destroy you but thou dis blow with I wind the sea covered them they sank as led in the muddy waters who is like under the old Lord among the gods who is like the glorious in holiness fearful and praises doing wonders now stretches out that right hand the earth swallowed them thou and thy mercies had led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou has guided them and not strengthened to the holy habitation the people shall fear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold of the inhabitants of Palestina then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed and the mighty men of Moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the habitants of Canaan shall melt away fear and dread shall fall upon them in the greatness of that arm shall they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over Oh Lord till the people pass over which thou has purchased until we go in a rapture he's going to hold it back until we leave here the people that he has purchased thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of mine inheritance in the place o Lord which thou has made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary O Lord which thy hands have established the Lord shall reign forever and ever that's my god that's who I serve the enemy said I will destroy them and they sink to the bottom of the ocean like lid and he says and I will keep them at bay until I take you over and establish you in the mountain of your inheritance Church we shall remain we shall not be moved like a tree planted by the water we're going to stand there we're going to be strong and no matter what comes we shall remain and done with my notes I want to close with this little story musicians you can come I had to skip a lot because well I'm slow sorry they pick on me and call me long-winded and I guess when I was I was thinking about the star-spangled banner and I was studying and and I was thinking about Fort McHenry and Francis Scott Key and you know Francis Scott Key had went out to a British ship to try to negotiate the release of his friend who had been taken prisoner and actually his tactics work and the British agreed to release them but because they had knowledge of the impending attack they wouldn't release him until the battle was over they said you're gonna have to stay here and they actually let him return to their own ship but under watchful eye of the British ship and Francis Scott Key their PIN words that became very famous to us we know it as the star-spangled banner but he would write later on he said it seemed as though Mother Earth had opened and was vomiting shot and shell in a sheet of fire and brimstone sounds like the day we live in all hell had opened up fire and brimstone it was a it was a marvelous and yet terrifying sight as he sit there and watch he would write but when darkness arrived he can only see red erupting in the night given the scale of the attack he was certain the British would win and the hours pass slowly but in the clearing smoke of dawn's early light Church I know different things excite different people but when I was reading this and this thought was coming to me how to run away I was thinking about all the saints down through time in the grandstands looking over the banister and I was thinking about down through the church ages every now and then there'd be a flash of light where the brown described it even as a roman candle there'd be a flash of light and they would say they're still there they're still there they're still standing and it'd go dark oh they're still there they're still a people remaining they're still the people standing for truth did you see that did you see that Martin's age they're still standing and then a prophet would come on the scene and Laodicea light did you see that that was the biggest burst of light we've ever seen oh my that was glorious [Music] but now here we are 42 years into the hour of darkness 42 years passed 1977 42 years passed the time were it was so dark the prophet of God couldn't see past and they're looking are they still there are they still holding on there's got to be somebody there's got to be somebody down there so dark it's so dark Oh but in dawn's early light on that bright morning when the victory in the flag waves high from the walls we didn't surrender we didn't give in we stood in the darkness night we stood we shall remain we won't give in on that brightened clown this morning they're gonna see you they're gonna see you Oh God let me remain this morning let me stay true against all odds let me stay true another scarf and turn away I want to remain blessed be the name of the Lord I will remain thank you Lord Jesus how we love you Lord Jesus how we thank you Lord for the Spirit of God that's giving us the strength to hold on to remain in this last day so we will not back up Lord today the line in the sand driven drawn by the Holy Spirit we see it clearly and we choose to step over and say we shall remain how we love you how we thank you Lord God for all that you've done for us we commit it all into your hands and we thank you Lord God that by your power by your light we shall [Music] amazing love [Music] wastewaters it's wrath of you lighter the whole gave His life so high to turn I said unworthy that you should die for me [Music] he said my child don't you burn me for your dad and you are blue you play for paid the price and you are sure
