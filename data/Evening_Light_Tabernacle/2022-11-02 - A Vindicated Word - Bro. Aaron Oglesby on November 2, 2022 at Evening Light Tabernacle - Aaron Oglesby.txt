the list goes on and on because you are infinite you know all Lord I'm asking tonight that you'll just take control of this vessel or that you'll speak to your people Lord that they would be encouraged Lord to face another day to fight on Lord Lord because I know that we're nearing the very end we're at the finish line and yet Lord it seems at that moment when the attack is greatest so Lord increase our courage Lord increase our courage that we can fight Lord and cross that line and take that Rapture that the ages have longed to see we ask you now to take control of this service Lord take control of this vessel May every heart Lord be blessed in your presence may they receive your word Lord as it was given I pray in Jesus name amen and amen if you have your Bibles with you tonight I'd like to get straight into the word by looking at John 5 and 36. John 5 and verse 36. we're going to read several places we're going to read but it'll all be here in the Book of John so we shouldn't have a problem getting to it quickly we're going to read this this one verse it says but I have greater witness than that of John for The Works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father had sent me we're going to look over into John 17. and verse 4. what he's saying there is is that John has bore witness of me but even greater than that the works that I'm doing vindicate what I say to be true he says I have glorified thee on Earth I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do and then one more reading where I look at John 14 and 11. John 14 and 11. we're going to read verse 11 and verse 12. it says believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also in Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto the father amen I pray the Lord will bless his word tonight as you have your seats I believe that every one of us here tonight as Believers of this end time message understand the importance of vindication as it relates to what we believe even more so than most in the religious world because we believe in a message that most people do not believe we believe something that others would consider different or it's a very small percentage of people who believe like we do and yet we can stand very firm tonight we can stand unashamed we don't have to back up any at all we don't have to be ashamed of the messenger because no matter what other people feel about him no matter what other people feel about this message no matter what people's opinions are the Lord went to Great Lengths to vindicate this message and the messenger so you can stand in confidence tonight you don't have to be ashamed to talk about it you don't have to be ashamed of witness of it because it was Vindicated it was done out in the open it was it was Time After Time After Time the Lord came down and said this is the truth as it has been said many times even as brother Tim has ministered here this message was over the indicated he went above and beyond to make sure there would be no question there was no question that God was in it there was no question that God had sanctioned it there was no question that this message was the truth because night after night we saw the pillar of fire come down and be on display night after night the angel of the Lord came behind that message and gave it a resounding amen all right he came down and and he put his name with it we know as human beings sometimes we don't want to go sign for something if if we can't trust it we don't want to put our name on something that we can't trust and yet Time After Time God would come down and say I'll put my name on this I'll stand behind this what's being said here is the truth and and we know that God will not come and back up or stand behind a lie or a half-truth and vindicate that he's not going to come stand with something that's not 100 percent true but when God comes down down and God begins to do signs and God begins to do wonders amongst his people even to the displaying of the Messiah sign even into the Discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart when he comes down behind a message and he does those things you can rest your very soul on that message as a matter of fact you better rest your soul on that message because when God comes down and vindicates it that's a message that's going to take you out of here that's a message that you can put your family in that's a message that you can hang your soul on tonight because God came down and said this message is the truth amen he came and he Vindicated it over and over it's it's a message of the Exodus it's a message that will take you from this Earth and that's how God has has done things from the very beginning even with Abel he came down and he Vindicated Abel he Vindicated that what he did was right and it's how God operates he always vindicates and backs up his word he will always do and that's what I'm going to speak to you tonight for a little bit about is a Vindicated word what we believe and what we preach is a Vindicated word because God always vindicates his word he always vindicates his moves and he always vindicates his people and the word vindicate here means to establish and to substantiate to be proven correct to clear from blame guilt or suspicion to justify listen God never leaves it up to his people to figure out well is God doing something here here is is this a move of God I'm not sure this could be this might be but he always comes behind his work to vindicate it and make sure that his people are without question this is the work of God and he didn't get all the way down here to the greatest move of God that the world's ever seen to the Rapture time to lay out a sea when things are evil and Lead things up in the air and leave things to where you had to discern well maybe it's true maybe it's not but he came down in power each and every day and he Vindicated it where you have no question you have no doubt time after time after a Time Beyond doubt this word has been Vindicated one thing I want us to understand as we go forward that God vindicates in in different ways he vindicates with signs he vindicates with wonders and he also vindicates with fulfillment and fulfillment is the greatest Vindication that there is listen Abraham there were many vindications in Abraham's life that he was following God that he had done the right thing by by leaving her and and seeking a city who's whose Builder and maker was God there were many vindications there were great visitations that Vindicated what God was doing through him but the ultimate Vindication of Allah that was the Fulfillment of the promised son that was the ultimate Vindication of his journey that the promised son Isaac had finally arrived because fulfillment is the ultimate Vindication there there have been and there will be more vindications of this message that that God is with us and that this word is the truth but one morning there's going to be the ultimate Vindication one of these mornings all the doubters can take their doubts and keep them all the Skeptics can take their arguments and keep them because one of these days the greatest Vindication that this message is true that's going to come a sweep across your body your loved ones are gonna appear you talk about a Vindication you talk about a justification you talk about removing all doubt when Mama walks in when Daddy walks in you won't have a question then you will be Vindicated this word will be Vindicated when the long-awaited promised son Jesus returns the change of our bodies our loved ones face to face listen I love every sign I love every wonder I love every vindication I want more of that I want those in our daily walk to know that this is God's hand this is God moving amongst us but they're only pointing to the great Vindication they're only pointed to the to the Vindication that every Christian that has stood down through time has stood for the Rapture of the church for everyone that's ever held on this will be Vindication for those who forsook family for those that firstook friends this will be the ultimate vindication I can't wait to we feel that sweet come across our body what a Vindication that's going to be but God doesn't leave us guessing along the way as we're heading towards that he doesn't leave us guessing he vindicates and he proves his word so that we can believe and be in the attitude and and the atmosphere to receive he he vindicates what he's doing so that you won't miss it okay Moses met the burning bush and and but he knew within himself these people know me and he knows they're not going to believe him he knows they're going to have a hard time he knows that they're going to doubt it in Chapter 3 of Exodus the Lord lays it all out to Moses he said here's what's going to happen and you're going to go down and you're going to deliver them and here's exactly what you're going to say to those people and Moses is like no they ain't gonna believe this you don't understand these people know me they know my past they know who I was they know my failures they're not going to accept it when I come save the Lord spoke to me and I am the deliverer Exodus 4 1 and Moses answer and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken under my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee now I'm going to go off for just a second sometimes we deal with the same thing whenever we have an experience with the Lord there's many times as Sinners that we meet God and we tell all our friends and they say no you're the same old guy no you're the same old person but why what I want to say to you is just let the life that he lives out of you vindicate your claim you don't got to prove nothing to them you don't got to convince them just let your life speak loud enough that they that it vindicates what you say happen happen there's been a change I met the burning bush I'm not the same person I once was and Moses is going back as a different person because brother Branham would say the burning bush had exactly what Moses lacked and so the Lord gives him two signs he gives him the rod and he gives him the sign in the hand and then he tells them and if they still won't believe this then he tells him about how he'll be able to turn the very water of the Nile into blood and what is it that he's declaring to Moses by giving him this in other words if my word is not enough if they won't trust you I'm going to give you this sign then I'm going to give you this sign and if that still isn't enough it's going to come to pass that I'm going to give you another sign what's he saying to him I'm not going to let my people miss it I'm not going to let them miss it this is the message of the Exodus and I'm not going to let it fail I know it's going to be hard to believe I know there's a lot of doubt in the land I know this is an age of unbelief I know you've been in bondage a long time but I'm gonna get the attention of my people I'm gonna do whatever it takes but I'm not gonna let him miss it I'm gonna make sure they believe I'm gonna make sure they're delivered I'm going to make sure they go the promised land I'm not going to leave one behind oh that's exactly what he had to do for Sarah she was sitting there the time was approaching fulfillment was at hand but God was determined I'm not gonna let her miss it she's the one she hasn't caught it yet she doesn't have the faith yet but I'm not gonna let her miss it she's the one that's going to bring forth the promised son she's the one that's part of the promise she is the one I gotta make sure she's on board and he's looking down tonight and he says she's the one she's the one she's going to bring forth the Rapture she's going to bring forth the promised son and I'm not gonna let her miss it I'll do whatever it takes I'll shake hell i'll bankrupt heaven but he's not gonna let you miss it tonight he'll vindicate whatever he has to vindicate he'll move on you again oh but he's moved once he's moved twice he's moved three times he won't let you miss it Hallelujah he's a determined God he's going to make sure you're on board I'll come down myself and turn her heart to believing don't give up on those that hadn't seen it yet don't give up on the ones you've been waiting on don't give up on yourself wherever you find yourself at tonight he isn't giving up on you he isn't giving up on you let that sink down in your heart tonight whatever you're going through whatever your struggle is how many times you failed he is not giving up on you he's not going to let you miss it he's not going to leave you behind you are the one going in the Rapture you are the Overcomers of laodicea you are the ones and he's going to do whatever it takes to get you on board he vindicates Moses but not just with the two signs but time after time on the journey you see the power of the spoken word there as he speaks flies and speaks frogs you see him call the plagues open in the Red Sea water comes forth from The Rock he vindicates Moses on the entire Journey all the way through the wilderness because there isn't just supposed to be Vindication of the power of God and the taking out it's not just going to be vindicating the power of God in the loosing in the setting free from the denominations what good is the setting free if we're going to come out not just like we did there and live just like we did there and have the same power or lack thereof that they did there but all the way to the end all the way to the journey all the way through laodicea all the way through the Wilderness he's still going to vindicate the pillar of fire is still going to be there the power to heal still going to be there the power to save still going to be there he's going to vindicate his power all the way to the promised land listen God didn't just vindicate the message in 1963. God wasn't just with the message in 1965 but the same power that came to vindicate the message is now vindicating itself in the bride today it's still the word it's still the message and it's still Vindicated amongst his people not just then but now tonight Wednesday night and evening like Tabernacle he still vindicates his word the same Miracles the same power the same Pillar of Fire that was there is the same Pillar of Fire that's here tonight vindicating this message this word is the truth foreign the pillar of fire was with them all the way in providing for them in the wilderness that didn't eliminate the trials that didn't eliminate the hardships but the continued Works Vindicated that God was with them every step of the way brother Brown says now the people begin to murmur they fell we don't want to murmur what is the works that Jesus did he said my Works declare me my Works prove who I am my Works vindicate me when God sent Moses The Works Vindicated him when God sent Elijah The Works Vindicated him when God anoints a man his Works vindicate him when God sent the holy ghost in the last day The Works Vindicated listen he didn't bring us out here to leave us all along and go let's see if y'all can make it I know I pulled you out of bondage but now let's just see you're on your own the pillar of fire is going back when it's not going to lead you anymore it's not going to provide for you anymore but the pillar of fire is still amongst us it's still moving in our midst the Manna still Falls The Living Water still flows you can still have your portion of it tonight it's not a past thing Vindication isn't just for the past Vindication is to show you that you can have it Vindication is so that you know he did it once he'll do it again he did it again and now he'll do it again if he did it again he'll do it again he will do it for you tonight and for your needs the Holy Ghost still moves the Holy Ghost still does the miraculous to vindicate what that he is in our midst you know when we get to a place that the signs and the Wonders and the miraculous stop happening we need to worry because where he is his works are made manifest where he is you will see a manifestation of the spirit where the spirit is you will find the fruits of the spirit you will find the works that I do shall you do also so if those Works aren't manifest we need to get very very concerned it is something that we should seek wholeheartedly Lord what is it Lord is it me Lord is it my home I want my home ready I want my home prepared I want you to be able to move in this church Lord don't let me be the hindrance don't let me be the one stopping it Lord search me o God search my attitude search me in the service search me with your word Lord I just want to be right I want you to move I want you to vindicate once more Lord that you're with us that you're amongst us that I'm not alone vindicate yourself to me Lord brother Brown says the Full Gospel preachers may be uneducated they may be illiterate but they got sense enough to know what God is when he comes in their midst they let him have his way and signs and wonders accompany that Ministry hallelujah it's the truth God always always now listen God always vindicates his church by signs and wonders it's always been the sign of God a shout of it in the camp of the king the king is in the camp today as a bunch of people he said the shout of the king is always in the camp and the king is in the camp today as a bunch of people that once again as we spoke last Wednesday puts the responsibility for the works that I do shall you do also squarely on you it puts a responsibility on us and a desire there should be a hunger for us to fulfill exactly what the word said we were going to fulfill he says you'll not say the days of Miracles has passed and no such a thing as Divine Healing with the spirit of the Living God who wrote the Bible in you you can't do it he will vindicate himself then when you see such things going on you'll not criticize that you'll glorify God because the very spirit that wrote them and it's performing them will bear witness of them that's the spirit of the Church of the Living God the Living God living in the Living Church oh my goodness I want to be a living church today I want the Living God flowing through a living church and a living people with signs and wonders following that's who I want to be he said that's the Vindication of the Living God it's the Living God living there and producing what he's always produced sometimes people think well you're looking to something way out there and wake no we're just pointing to the Bible saying that's what he's always done this is how he's always operated this is who he's always been and I'm not going to tell him to change I just want to be a vessel that says Lord operate the way you've always operated move the way you've always moved just let me get out of the way thank you God's word will never return unto him void the things that he promised will come to pass no matter the opposition but he's got to have someone willing he's got to have someone who's a vessel that will allow him to operate because you're always going to have the doubters you're always going to have the Skeptics you're always going to have those that point out every little flaw well it's been this many years and brother Branham said this and it hasn't happened brother Branham said that and it hasn't happened time element people not operating in an eternal Realm if it's said and it's the word of God time doesn't matter well that hadn't happened yet that's why I'm thankful for vindication once Vindicated once something is Vindicated then I no longer have to question it I no longer have to doubt it once proven true that I have no reason to doubt what is being spoken I'm not putting time limits on God that's exactly what happened in Elijah's day people begin to doubt whether or not Elisha was actually a true Prophet they began to criticize even though they had seen God move in his ministry even though he had been Vindicated as a prophet they said well you know Elisha was false Elisha was false he couldn't have been called of God but because he said he would do double the Miracles he said he was supposed to have a double portion but he's one short Elisha came up one short and they began to criticize oh yeah now he was one short he couldn't have been called of God you know listen I know that all things before we count them as true must be proven it must be Vindicated by God in order to be accepted I understand that but the Vindication that comes in a Ministry is to give you faith for what lies ahead in the Unseen in other words if it's true if it's true if it's true if it's true if it's true if it's true if it's truth and then there's something that hadn't happened yet all of this gives you the faith you need to hold on for that if he's been a Healer been a Healer been a Healer been a Healer been a Healer been a Healer been a Healer and I'm still sick I can hold on for that if you say prodigal after protocol after protocol after protocol after protocol and I still got a prodigal I can hold on for that you hear what I'm saying if I got a need he's been a need supplier and he's supplied for this one supplied for this was applied for this it's the population I can hold on tonight because it gives me the faith the Vindication tells me it's going to happen I can hold on tonight the Miracles already done should have let them know that the other one was going to happen what God's already done should let us know that he's going to finish the work he's going to take us out of here his word has been Vindicated but instead the doubters begin to criticize that's what doubters do it's what critical Spirits do they're critical they criticize Elisha was one short I knew he was false but there was a word that had declared you will have a double portion and not even death could stop that word from being fulfilled not even death could stop that word from being Vindicated oh he was one short and he passes away but we know the story one day there's a battle that's been being fought and Raiders were coming into the land and when these soldiers one of their buddies had gotten killed and so they're trying to tote him along he's dead and they're trying to keep him from falling into the hands of the enemy but it's slowing them all down you know sometimes if we just quit trying to carry everybody along and try to fix every single person's problems and we'll just put them somewhere where there's some quickening power and just put him in those hands got to take care of it way better than you ever could quit trying to carry him through everything quit trying to fix every problem and just put them in the hands of the one that's got quickening power tonight so they're trying to carry him and it's dragging them down and pretty soon they're all going to get caught by the enemy I'm just being real I don't know I'd probably be like I don't know Joe he did anyway ah he ain't gonna be mad at us hell no if we don't put him somewhere we all gonna be dead and so they found this cave you know and in their hearts really what they don't want is the body of their brother to fall into the hands of the enemy and they find this cave and they say this would be good enough this is good enough oh they've been saying Elisha was one short Elisa was one short oh he didn't vindicate he done died he can't fulfill it now and they threw him in there but there was still quickening power on those bones it was the quickening power it's going to bring those bones up in a resurrection but it was on there and they throw him in there and they took off running and all of a sudden out of nowhere he passed them up says come on boys come on listen if we could get some quickening power on some of these dead Bones tonight if we could get some pregnant power on some of these dead Bones tonight you might run like we ain't never seen you run you might work somebody we ain't never seen you worship you might pass some of us something that gave up on you just get some quick and power it'll give you a jump it'll give you a shout it'll give you a praise it'll vindicate the word get some quick and Empower on your bones Hallelujah he came right on pastor why'd y'all leave me there thanks though thanks though you get some quick and empowered to change things even in death God Vindicated he ain't gonna let one word fall to the ground you worried about a loved one you worried about a financial situation this man was dead it was past hope but when it's past hope that's when quickening power can take over a situation that's when my God can begin to move Hallelujah it don't matter how long it's been it doesn't matter how dark it gets but there it's dark it's loud to see it is my family's falling apart things are difficult foreign I just ran eight yards and I'm out of breath I need some quickening power quick it doesn't matter how dark it gets we're standing on Vindicated word we are standing on Vindicated promises that's a place that that anchor can take hold and you won't be shook you won't be rattled because we're on a Vindicated word of Vindicated message we have nothing to fear this message was Vindicated this word is Vindicated listen the Saints in the Dark Ages went down to death with no fear based solely on the fact that in the scripture they saw Jesus had Resurrected and they knew there is a resurrection I can go down without fear I can face this because it Vindicated there has been no other age that has received a message as Vindicated as this age we're without excuse if they could go down to death with that we can face anything in this day we can face anything he know we know that this word will defeat Satan any place at any time you can stand there and face it sickness I can face it death I can face it financial trouble I can face it backslidden family I can face it I can face anything because we have a Vindicated word with Vindicated promises and it was Vindicated around the world over and over and over again the Israelites had no reason to fear anymore once met Moses's message had been Vindicated once Moses demonstrated that he had been with God and that God was with him once that became Vindicated there was no need for them to worry anymore the lord loves it whenever we take his Vindication and we trust in that Vindication in order to go forward he would tell them over and over and get frustrated with him in the Old Testament because they forgot because they forgot because they forgot that he had Vindicated and he had Vindicated and he had Vindicated and they forgot and they forgot wherever you're at today do not forget that this word is Vindicated that this Prophet was Vindicated that this message was Vindicated that our God has been Vindicated that he is true and he is faithful it is Vindicated there's no reason to back up there's no reason to be to be fearful when Moses got there to the Red Sea God expected him to know how to respond because of the previous vindications he expected him to know how to handle himself don't fear he said you've seen what I've done you know what I promise now expect me to do it again expect me to do it again expect him to move for you tonight expect him to do the miraculous tonight expect him to go beyond what you could even expect expect it tonight he says you spoke flies you spoke frogs now speak a pathway come on now whatever you're facing he spoke in your life before he's moved like that before in your life just expecting to speak a pathway tonight expect him to open that situation up expect him to move in ways you can't even imagine expect it tonight because of what he is Vindication because of what he has Vindicated we have to operate as a people who have witnessed the Vindication of the Lord he did it once he's going to do it again he saved others he's going to save mine he's moved for others he's going to move from me he's healed others he's going to heal me he acted like that in the book of Acts he's going to act like that again now he's Vindicated himself we've seen his Vindication and we desire more of it it's not just a past thing because brother Branham says that's how he vindicates his church so it must be present and amongst us now Vindication of the word is more than just Vindication of the word past it's more than that but it lets us know that if Satan couldn't stop him then he can't stop you now if he couldn't stop The Exodus then he can't stop the Exodus now if he couldn't keep Lazarus in a tomb he can't keep your loved ones in a tomb if he couldn't stop it then he can't stop it now what are you saying I'm saying we're going to make it we're gonna overcome we're gonna Rapture he can't stop it he's never been able to stop it that's Vindicated that's word that's truth he can't stop us now Hallelujah brother Brown says now notice a man can be ever so fundamental in his Doctrine he can be ever so sincere in his heart he says I hope this sinks deep but unless God confirms it it's no good God vindicates God has always from back at the beginning from Abel Plum on to the end over here in Revelation you'll find out that God vindicates his church with signs and wonders as the Believers he says and today the churches you preach that Doctrine they take the confirmation is a man that goes to church now listen these are all wonderful things this describes a lot of people in a lot of churches a man that goes to church he's good quiet religious type Pays His tithes supporter of the church believes in the church brother that's no sign at all no sign that's the world's sign he says but God's sign is what he said it was amen well what's that sign what was I say if that's not it it's not what's that sign these signs shall follow them that belief Mark 16. they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover Joel Joel says that I'm gonna pour out my spirit upon All Flesh they shall speak in new tongues those are the signs that he said the world says just be a believer just pay your tithes just make sure you come to church and he says that's no sign at all but a Vindication of a real believer is that the signs that I do the works that I do shall you do also he says that's the Vindication of the Living Church that's how he vindicates his church and that's why we can't be passive about these things that's why we preach it so hard that's why we're always hitting on it because when those vindications are absent you have to ask why this is a Vindicated word it's supposed to brother Brown says over and over and over again it will vindicate itself why and even worse and even greater indictment is when they aren't there and they're not wanted when they're not there they reject the Vindication of his presence and therefore they are rejecting the pillar of Fire go back and listen to the tape and when the pillar of fire was present listen to the things that happen and now if you don't want those things you are directly saying we don't want that brother Branham says it's a rejection of the Holy Ghost listen because I can hear this now I know we're not to seek after science I know that 100 that's totally backwards that's opposite Wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign but it's very clear that the signs should follow you say well we are believers that's where we rest our our soul was anchored in the word 100 percent then where's the works because these signs shall follow shall that's unquestionable they have to be there we know that Jesus came to the Earth and I'm gonna go through this quickly as I try to get to a certain point Jesus came to the Earth and in so doing he Vindicated or fulfilled the entire Old Testament every type every story every scripture and we've already said that fulfillment is the ultimate Vindication he fulfilled Genesis 3 15 the bruising of the Serpent's head his birth Vindicated Isaiah 7 14. he Vindicated Psalms 22 and 1. my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me pierced his hands poured his garments he was Emmanuel he did not see corruption we could go on and on and on the list is forever of the things that he fulfilled because he fulfilled it all but there are very specific things that you can point to and and he goes about casting out Devils Healing The Sick opening the blind eyes and we see here in John 10 22 it says and it was at Jerusalem the Feast of the dedication and it was winter and Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch then came the Jews round about him and said unto him how long does thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly they answered their own question because they doubt how long are we going to keep doubting you he could have easily said I don't know how long are you going to keep doubting but he says tell us plainly Jesus answered said I told you and you believed not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me Jesus tells them even if you don't believe what I'm saying The Works vindicate Who I Am The Works vindicate what I'm telling you to be the truth the signs Vindicated the miraculous vindicates it the Wonders Vindicated and how can we then say we don't need those things if we're bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she is him the signs will vindicate it The Works will vindicate it even if the world doesn't believe what we're saying believe us for the work's sake because the miraculous will vindicate it brother Branham says when the Holy Ghost itself here to Bear record of this hour Jesus said so he's the same yesterday today and forever how dare any man to wipe that out of there The Works that I do shall you do also John 14 12 these signs shall follow them that believe that is the Assurance now listen because I've heard this not said like this how about that that is the Assurance when we see a group of people sitting together and those signs manifesting themselves that's the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that's property of God the Assurance when we see a group of people sitting together and those signs manifesting themselves that's the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that's the property of God I'd like to know what year Easter seal 1965. he says God wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word when the church explains it away and says it's for some other day how can God who wants to fulfill his word and perform his word amongst the people and the people deny that he does it yet they go through all the rituals here's what happened God wants to perform by the Holy Ghost and vindicate his word and the church wants to perform he said the church wants to perform they have to deny the Holy Ghost he says when the Lord's wanting to move he's wanting to perform but they want to perform in their ritual no this is how we sing we sing this many songs oh but the spirit's moving no it's time for the preacher to come out but the spirit's moving yeah but it's almost 115 and we're normally shutting down about now oh but the spirit's move and then it's two o'clock and we've seen longer in the second song service than we did in the first song service but the spirit's moving but the church wants to perform the church wants the ritual of we believe the message and they deny the Holy Ghost he wants to perform by the Holy Ghost to vindicate his word in this hour and yet the church wants to perform their rituals you say what I believe the message well if you do then the life of the message will be found in you the life of the message will be preached the Dynamics of the message will be preached you can't pick and choose what part of the message you want to preach to fit your narrative or what it is you want to believe because God will always vindicate his word by the power of the Holy Ghost with the demonstrations of the Holy Ghost you must have it in order for it to be Vindicated you must have the Dynamics backing up the mechanics brother Brown says God Is Right his word is Right others are not right he said that's right as long as they can stay with the word but when you leave the word then you leave God because God is watching over his word to vindicate it he's got to make it real he's got to make it act he says that's why you people are hungering for a Revival it's time for these things to be here if you ever believe me to know what I'm talking about you accept that that's a powerful statement oh is this from the seals no no he says that's why you people are hungering for a Revival it's time for these things to be here if you ever believe me to know what I'm talking about you accept that the hour is here now that's why we preach healing that's why we preach Deliverance that's why we can accept tones and interpretation that's why we can dance in the spirit that's why we can worship freely he said the time is now these things are to be here now and these things vindicate that you are the property of God [Music] he's vindicating now it's in his word and he watches over his word to vindicate it but it can't vindicate itself If you deny it how can you know he can Vindicated in others but he can't vindicate it in you if you deny it to be the truth he can't vindicate it in your church if you won't let it operate we believe the word yes and we must preach the whole word if we want to see that word Vindicated well we haven't seen vindications has it been preached when we don't have the moving of the spirit has it been preached well we agree with those things we just don't ever see it here there's a big difference between agreeing and supporting and fostering God will not identify with a place or a people where the word is pushed out and the power of it is not allowed to operate these are strong words but these are coming from the message of the hour will we believe the word that's exactly what I'm trying to get you to do just stay with the word and let the word live it's not a dead word it's a Living Word let it do what the word says it will do well you're trying to manifest I'm not trying to manufacture nothing as a matter of fact I don't want anything that is manufactured I don't want nothing that is worked up I don't want nothing that is pure 100 emotion with with no Spirit moving and I don't want those things what I'm saying is preach the word and then let the word vindicate itself preach the word and let the word do what the word said it will do let the word do what the word said it will do the word said you can rejoice and dance and the word said you can shout the word said there'll be tongues the word says they'll be healing the word says there'll be a shout of the king and the camp we believe the word then believe that let that be Vindicated amongst you to prove that you believe the word today stop hindering it Let it Loose as I was driving out to Amarillo last week I began to notice something we don't have in Louisiana big giant wind turbines we don't have those here you wanna know why there's stuff in the way there's stuff that hinders the moving of the Wind but out there there's nothing in the way it's they can put those things up and the wind just blows and they take that wind and they harness the power of it and they put it to use oh come on now it's time we tear down some of the things in the way we tear down some of the hindrances and we let the wind begin to start blowing and when it starts blowing you can harness the power you can move in the spirit you can put that power to use the sick will be healed the bound will be delivered there's too much stuff in the way there's too many trees and too many ideas and too many critical Spirits lay it down and let the wind blow harness the power of the Holy Ghost and put it to use to put every devil to fight tonight cut down all the hindrances let the Holy Spirit begin to move God sent a message in this day and as we have said it was Vindicated brother Brown says if I was dying right here in this building right now and over this next few minutes I just want this to encourage us something we can anchor to when the wind blows he said if this would be my last service my testimony is true the church knows it Millions many millions of people around the world and how they searched and tried and agnostics and unbelievers and Science and laws and everything else has went through it everywhere and tried to tear it apart and every time God comes right back and vindicates it in power and then the scientific World went in to find it and God pictured it Yonder showed it to him and there they are tonight and stands as a memorial to ring out as long as there is a Christian civilization there it is Yonder now in Washington D.C foreign the world has attacked it backsliders have attacked it anti-message Spirits have attacked it and yet Vindicated Vindicated I look around the very condition of the world vindicates this message almost more than anything else I look around and go yep he was right he was right he was right he was right he was right so guess what that Vindication lets me know it's going to be right it's going to be right it's going to be right going to be right going to be right going to be right it's going to keep being right until one morning the final Vindication strikes it's not going to fail it's never failed it's not going to start now it's going to continue to be right and continue to vindicate itself and yet through all these attacks I look at it and I I can't imagine anything more Vindicated than this message over and over brother Brown would stand and say if I told you the truth let him come confirm it time after time he would ask audiences of thousands if anybody knows of anything I've ever said wrong and you got to understand these were people that did not like him that did not support him that would have loved the opportunity to call him out and you listen and all you hear is crickets come on up oh but let that generation start to pass off the scene the ones who knew better than to challenge him let all the witnesses be gone then suddenly well this didn't happen and that didn't happen what's funny because the people that were with him never testified to that they never said it didn't happen as a matter of fact I was on a website the other day it was some type of Pentecostal website and and they were interviewing different ones um Aaron Baxter and several other brothers that you would recognize their name if I could recall them and they were ones who were saying that brother Branham got off at the end and that's why they had separated in their association with him and then this is years after brother Brown was gone so there was no fear of hurting his feelings and they would ask him they would say so what about all the other stuff all the discernments and the healings and the Miracles they say oh no no no every one of those was real so you never saw it fail never one time these are people saying oh yeah yeah we don't agree with him but never one time did it ever for what about in personal car rides what about things he told you personally never one time you can rest your anchor you can anchor down on this message it's Vindicated it never failed Time After Time brother Brown says now look where the drama sets the Bible is going to be found to be truth or error I'm going to be found a false prophet or telling you the truth if I tell the truth God will vindicate the truth if I tell a lie God will show that it's a lie but his word can't lie that's the reason I'm sure I'm positive I'm telling you the word of the lord it's God's promise now believe let's see what he will say thousands of Miracles thousands of discernments Visions phenomenal things death healed blind healed mind restored dead raised Vindicated authenticated whatever word you want to come up with all doubt removed all suspicion removed doctor statements but the person says what a moment what a moment see God the word is the truth and the word is going to be found either I'm a false witness of the word or I've told the truth God will vindicate that word is the truth that's right God will have nothing to do with a lie you know that how can people look at the Vindication and deny the message night after night he would speak and bring forth the message and declare it was true and then God would come down right after he spoke with signs and wonders vindicating he would come down and have his picture taken there would be Angels come down in a cloud there would be a king's sword come down in the Sabino Canyon wait wait brother Aaron wait a minute now these things aren't facts these things that you're mentioning now they're questionable not to me they're not questionable because let's reiterate this one time if it was Vindicated it was Vindicated it was Vindicated that he was a truth teller a truth teller a true teller a truth teller then I can rest on this right here I can also see the fruits that It produced I can also see God coming in behind it and vindicating it with signs and wonders and movements of the spirit so I don't have to question these things aren't questionable to me because the message was Vindicated and the messenger was Vindicated and God said amen every single time he preached standing in the Gap 1963. I'd recommend every one of you listen to it brother Brown tells in great detail of the cloud and the experience with the angels he tells of the king's sword in Sabina Canyon he tells of the dream with his brother-in-law Fletcher and how the Lord tells him if he carries out his plans he's going to be a bum and that's where he saw those men in the restaurant and Billy says Danny that looks like you you and Fletcher all this is in the same sermon that's where the Lord speaks to him and tells him you forgot the feeling of the people you forgot that I called what I called you to and then he tells about the Seven Peaks and the angel asking him how many letters are in his name b-r-a-n-h-a-m and then there's three outstanding Peaks and he says it's the first pull the second pool in the third pool there's a lot going on in this message there's a lot of amazing outstanding things that we hold to be true being told right here in this message he tells all these things and then at the very end of the service literally as he says let's bow our heads brother Wade Falls dead of a heart attack he just laid out all these things and brother Wade Falls dead of a heart attack now to a skeptic that might be like well see death right there in the middle of it death right there in the middle you listen oh it's just the opposite you talk about vindication you talk about God coming to back up everything that was just said the Lord knew how amazing these stories were he knew how difficult it would be for some people to believe he knew there would be questions he knew this sounds amazing outstanding almost I've never heard anything like this there's Peaks and your names in the Peaks and there's three mountains and it's these pools and and then he tells you're going to be a bum like your brother-in-law and then a sword came in your what imagine what it sounded like to people hearing this for the first time imagine how to tell us that's just common knowledge that's things we know and things we believe and trust him because it's Vindicated but brother Wade Falls dead right there in the service and this is the end of it right here and you hear it on tape it's outstanding what's really outstanding is to hear the calm that brother Branham deals with the situation with but he says let us pray brother and then it says a sister in the congregation cries out someone fainted just a minute sit still everybody see says brother brown leaves the pulpit goes down into the congregation heavenly father let thy mercy and goodness be with brother way in the name of Jesus Christ may he come back give him back lord and give him strength and health and he says so help me his heart starts beating again be still everybody and just pray Lord Jesus let that goodness and mercy be with brother away in the name of Jesus Christ it's over as I stand here on this altar where funerals has been preached where I stand here where hundreds of people has prayed through to Christ I reached out his eyes were set his post was gone and no more than I called the name of Jesus Christ and his post started coming back again praise the Lord praise the Lord as a minister of the cross I say that in the name of Jesus Christ isn't he wonderful The Giver of Life the creator of heavens and earth in that moment said I'll back this up I'll back this word up I'll stand behind this Prophet this message is true this message is truth a man dies and he comes down and he restores life why so you can anchor your soul that God back this message up he won't back up a lie but he backed this up and he Vindicated it he brought a man back to life he raises him from the dead why it's the Exodus message and he's not gonna let you miss it but he's going to vindicate it and Vindicated and Vindicated service after service until the prophet leaves no until we leave it's going to be Vindicated on Wednesday and Sunday and Wednesday and Monday at home and Tuesday at home in every situation you face he will vindicate his word is the truth foreign the people has to believe we're going to start bringing this down now we can't leave anyone behind and God's going to Great extremes to get all that are his and it caught your attention and you knew that this was more than a man you knew this was God and in that word quick into that seed in your heart it became alive he wouldn't let you miss it why did it Quicken something because there was something in you to Quicken there was something there back to John 10 and 25 Jesus answered them said I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe not because you were not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me John 12 36 while you have light believe in the light that ye may be Children of the light these things spake Jesus and departed and hid himself from them but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him there was nothing in them to be quickened by the Vindication of the word it didn't matter how much they saw they would explain it away it didn't matter how much they saw they had an answer brother Branham says the Dynamics if it comes upon water it'll just splutter days of Miracles past oh I believe the Bible but there ain't no but when he hits that 1000 octane away she goes you see how my the Dynamics strike that but if it strikes a chicken it won't do no good but when it strikes the eagle he moves out amen because the Dynamics with the mechanics see what I mean if he's a true Eagle now he will understand what are you saying I'm saying that true seed responds a certain way to Dynamics true seed operates a certain way when the spirit begins to move the chicken says but the true Eagle begins to feel something stirring he begins to feel something going and there's a little excitement because oh excitement that's emotional then I get emotional because I began to get a little excited I say oh that's my father that's moving oh I recognize that win that's the same wind that came the day I was filled with the Holy Ghost oh I recognize that when he begins to move and it begins to stir and it hits that thousand octane seed on the inside of me and when it hits me it says off she goes because there's something in you to Quicken there's something that responds to that that's the Deep calling out to the Deep you say no that's emotion brother Brian I'm saying when I was running around and around and around that tree he said that was the Deep calling unto the deep I believe there's a deep on the inside of a people today that sees a Vindicated word and it tells them you're going to overcome you're gonna make it you're gonna Rapture and something swells up inside of them it hits that thousand Octane and off they go they can't stand still they're not a chicken it's indicated that's me that's me that's who I am that call my name hallelujah it's a Vindication of who you are it's the Vindicated word hallelujah and it's vindicating that it's the last day so you are the last day bride Hallelujah you can all stand to your feet with us Church the Miracles are important the victories the signs they're important to change lives they're important because without them none of what we claim is the truth none well we don't believe in signs and none of what you claim to believe is true if those things aren't there because without that there's no life anyone can claim a message anyone can came to claim to be bride and they do but there's going to be one Vindicated there's going to be one that he comes down and moves in their midst one that does the works that he said she would do brother Brown says now the scripture says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he did not claim to be a Healer he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works he did not claim to be a great person but what he did claim to be he was well I liked that that's a powerful statement what he did claim to be he was Let each one of us take that for ourselves don't claim to be something you're not be honest be real be what you claim to be he that he was that he claimed to be and God will vindicate every man that speaks the truth God will prove it to be so man can say anything that doesn't make it so but when God speaks that makes it so and he said he did just as the father showed him and the scripture said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13 8 then Jesus Christ if he's the same today as he was yesterday he still does the same works today that he did yesterday if he doesn't if he isn't if he doesn't he isn't Jesus Christ and his claims are not so so think about when you're saying that we don't have that and he don't do that brother Branham says then he's not even Jesus Christ his claims are not so but tonight I've seen Vindication after Vindication after Vindication after Vindication after Vindication so I may be standing here at the Red Sea but I've just seen him call plagues I've just seen him save Souls I've just seen him heal I've just seen him deliver oh I'm standing at the worst thing the doctor could have ever told me that I'm about to speak a pathway right through it there's no hope for my family I'm about to speak a pathway right through it mine will never be restored I'm going to speak a pathway right through it how can you say it with confidence because he has over Vindicated this message he has Vindicated a Time After Time After Time and listen to me he Vindicated the Old Testament prophets he Vindicated Jesus Christ he Vindicated William Branham and the time is now that he's going to vindicate the Bride of Jesus Christ she is who she says she is and one of these mornings when we go it's going to be the greatest indication we were telling you the truth we are what we say we are and he will vindicate it one of these ones I can't wait I love these vindications but one of these mornings total Vindication total Victory Justified we are who we say we are the Vindicated word he'll vindicate it to you tonight Church in your need in your situation he's here to vindicate it to you can you bow your heads with me father Lord I speak these words to even like Tabernacle Lord not to condemn anyone or anybody who doesn't see it exactly this way Lord because you're going to get the attention of your people maybe some at one time and some at another but Lord I believe with all my heart as I read the message in the scriptures that there must be life there and evidence of a living God to vindicate that you're in our midst because where you are your works are present where you are your works are manifested where you are demons are cast out where you are there's overcoming lives where you are there's Victory where you are the shout of the king is in the camp and the prophet of God said and today the king is here in many bodies don't let us operate as that King let us all pray there's one that's bone of your bone flesh of your flesh Lord I didn't get to it tonight but your Prophet says over and over again that we are here to vindicate the word that our life will vindicate that what you said was the truth that you're alive that you are the same if who is going to show the world that you're the same yesterday today and forever if we don't Lord Lord if we're not operating in that fullness help us tonight father if we're not there if we don't see it open our eyes Lord Lord you've done so much that if you never do another thing oh we couldn't complain but I'm asking you tonight Lord vindicate yourself once more move once again because I know your heart she's the one that's going to bring forth the promised son
