========================================

[Music] I know you're tired. I know you're weak. And all of that fighting's got you down on your knees. You're desperate for change. You're desperate to know if there's a light still alive. Child, lift up your eyes. For your help draws nigh. I lift up your eyes. It'll be all right. Every tear you've cried. Let the sunlight dry. Every tear you've cried. It'll be all right. If you still have breath in your lungs. If you still have breath in your lungs, you're not [Music] done. I'll be your strength. I'll be your song. And I'll be the solid rock that you can't stand on. I'm with you always. I'm never alone cuz I'm right by your side. Just lift up your eyes. For your help draws nine. Just lift up your eyes. It'll be all right. Every tear you cry. Let the sunlight dry. Every tear you cry. It'll be all right. If you still have breath in your lungs. If you still have breath in your lungs. If you still have breath in your lungs. If you still have breath in your lungs. If you still have breath in your lungs. If you still have breath in your lungs, you're not alone. Oh child, lift up your eyes. For your help draws nigh. Child, lift up your eyes. It'll be all right. Every tear you cry. Let the sunlight dry. Every tear you cry. It'll be all right. If you still have breath in your lungs. If you still have breath in your lungs. If you still have breath in your lungs. If you still have breath in your lungs. You're not done. [Music] [Applause]
