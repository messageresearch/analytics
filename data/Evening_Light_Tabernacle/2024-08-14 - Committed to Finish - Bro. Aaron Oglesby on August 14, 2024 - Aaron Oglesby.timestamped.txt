[35:22] Lord those that just weren't able to
[35:24] make it tonight I just pray you'll touch
[35:25] them Lord and those that have have made
[35:27] the effort and pushed through and
[35:29] gathered with us tonight I pray that
[35:30] you'll touch their bodies as well and
[35:32] just Lord touch each one of us in spirit
[35:34] Lord Lift us up to a higher Place father
[35:36] that we can see you more clearly Lord in
[35:38] in this hour of Darkness Lord we commit
[35:41] ourselves to you Lord I Lord I I I know
[35:44] you gave me this thought and I just pray
[35:45] that you'll just help me Lord as cloudy
[35:47] as my mind is Lord to just step aside
[35:49] and allow you to speak father and Lord
[35:51] may it come across clearly to the people
[35:53] tonight what you've laid on My Heart
[35:55] Lord but I know that'll take you to do
[35:56] that Lord so we just committed into your
[35:58] hands now and ask you to speak tonight
[36:01] father bless your word as we read it in
[36:03] Jesus name we pray amen amen if if you
[36:07] have your Bibles we'd like to turn to
[36:10] the Book of Revelation chapter
[36:12] 10 the seventh verse and we're just
[36:14] going to read one verse there and and
[36:16] let you have your
[36:18] seats amen ain't God good to us amen he
[36:21] sure is revelation 10 and verse 7 it
[36:26] says but in the days of the voice of the
[36:28] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[36:31] sound the mystery of God should be
[36:33] finished as he hath declared to his
[36:36] servants the prophets amen I pray the
[36:39] Lord will add a blessing to the reading
[36:41] of the word as you take your seats
[36:43] tonight
[36:46] amen wonderful you know I I read here in
[36:49] this spot because I I believe that that
[36:51] the voice of the seventh angel that we
[36:53] read about there in Revelation has
[36:56] sounded and and I believe that it that
[36:58] it was the end time message and you know
[37:01] if you just if you just take a moment
[37:03] and look around at the condition of of
[37:05] the world that we're living in and and
[37:08] then you compare it to the scriptures I
[37:10] believe that it'll declare to you that
[37:12] we are living in the end times amen and
[37:15] and and I believe that this message that
[37:17] came in this day was a finishing message
[37:19] I believe it finished the restoration of
[37:21] the word it it it finished the Mysteries
[37:24] as it said there and it anointed a
[37:26] people to finish fin the final lapse of
[37:29] time you know there's been others that
[37:30] have run down down through the years and
[37:33] the ages but it comes our turn now to
[37:35] run the final lapse of time and and as
[37:38] we look into the word tonight The Cry of
[37:40] my heart is that it's time for a greater
[37:43] commitment it's time for a greater
[37:45] sincerity and and a deeper commitment to
[37:48] the things of God it's it's time for
[37:50] total commitment it's time for us as a
[37:52] people to be Allin because you know as
[37:55] we look around Satan has had 6,000 years
[37:57] to to turn this world into a world of
[38:00] evil he's had 6,000 years to mold it and
[38:03] brother brandham would say that God's
[38:06] Eden was established in righteousness he
[38:09] said but Satan's Eden is established in
[38:12] sin so I I I I don't think it takes a
[38:15] great Revelation to look around and see
[38:17] that that statement is the truth that
[38:19] we're living in a world that is totally
[38:21] established on sin man's mind is on evil
[38:25] continually there's there's sin and all
[38:27] levels of government there's there's sin
[38:29] and Corruption and and everything that
[38:32] goes on around us each and every day
[38:34] it's a it's a scientific Eden that
[38:37] denies the very existence of God it's an
[38:39] Eden that feeds from and it worships
[38:42] from the Tree of knowledge that in this
[38:44] day has reached its height that has
[38:46] reached its total maturity and and in
[38:48] this environment you must be totally
[38:52] committed to what you believe you must
[38:54] be fully sold out to what you believe
[38:57] because the the currents of the age are
[38:58] so strong that if you're not anchored if
[39:01] you're not totally committed then it's
[39:04] impossible for you to not be swept away
[39:06] you have to be sold out because if
[39:08] you're halfway in you're eventually
[39:10] going to be all the way
[39:12] out that that goes for just about
[39:14] anything you do in life but especially
[39:16] in our Christian walk if if you're only
[39:19] halfway in it won't be long until you're
[39:21] all the way out because there in
[39:24] Revelation as we read you've read it
[39:26] before where it described as a a smoke
[39:29] that comes up from the bottomless pit
[39:31] and we've talked about it before but
[39:33] smoke has a way of getting into
[39:35] everything smoke has has a way of of
[39:38] tainting everything of getting into
[39:40] every place that isn't sealed so tonight
[39:44] if there's parts of you that isn't
[39:45] sealed if there's parts of you that's
[39:47] uncovered or exposed the the smoke of
[39:49] the age the the currents of the age the
[39:52] thinking of the day it's going to get
[39:54] into those parts of your life you've got
[39:56] to make sure that every bit of it is
[39:58] sealed and every bit of it is committed
[40:00] to the Lord and and what's happened is
[40:02] is this smoke has got into people's
[40:04] minds and it's got into the thinking of
[40:07] humanity where people can't think
[40:09] clearly anymore that people's minds are
[40:11] completely and totally insane it doesn't
[40:14] take long in a conversation or it it
[40:17] doesn't take long listening to the news
[40:19] or or reading some politics or just look
[40:22] at some of the headlines that you see
[40:24] each and every day the things that our
[40:26] politicians stand up and say the things
[40:29] that they do the causes that they choose
[40:31] to fight
[40:33] for and the way people view different
[40:35] situations and we look at it and we say
[40:38] these people are
[40:39] nuts this world has lost its mind this
[40:42] world is gone totally insane and yet as
[40:45] we look at it and we're so quick to
[40:47] judge it and yet if it wasn't for the
[40:49] grace of God if it wasn't for the
[40:52] influence of God if it wasn't for the
[40:54] hand of God's on our lives then we could
[40:58] have lost the ability to think clearly
[41:00] as well we wouldn't be any different
[41:02] from the rest of the world if it wasn't
[41:04] for his influence on our minds giving us
[41:07] Clarity giving us truth and allowing us
[41:09] to stay free from that amen because it's
[41:13] permeated everything in our in our
[41:15] society I just saw a headline yesterday
[41:18] about about Delta Airlines you know it's
[41:20] a a a company established right here in
[41:24] Louisiana you know in the South where
[41:26] sometimes you tend to think maybe they
[41:28] still have values and what it says they
[41:30] will no longer say ladies and gentlemen
[41:33] when they get on a
[41:34] flight they're no longer going to say
[41:37] that because it's not right to gender
[41:38] people that
[41:40] way the whole world has gone completely
[41:44] insane and and you pay attention and
[41:47] watch when people fall away from the
[41:49] faith and and people leave the the the
[41:52] church and watch how their thinking
[41:54] begins to change the further they get
[41:56] away from the the influence of the word
[41:59] when they get out from underneath the
[42:00] influence of Godly Parents or out from
[42:02] underneath the influence of of a of a
[42:05] Godly church and and and soon they'll
[42:08] begin to view sin in a different way and
[42:10] they'll be even begin to support sin
[42:14] unashamedly and and you sit there and
[42:16] you say well well brother Aaron I would
[42:17] never do that and that's because you
[42:20] haven't given over to that mind that's
[42:22] because you have the mind of Christ
[42:24] that's because you're under the
[42:25] influence of the Holy ghost and because
[42:28] of that you can thank God tonight that I
[42:30] still have my sanity I can still look at
[42:33] things and not look at it in a totally
[42:35] crazy way and not recognize they don't
[42:38] even recognize they've been given over
[42:40] to a repeate mind and I'm telling you
[42:42] it's a time that you got to be sold out
[42:44] to truth you can't compromise even a
[42:47] little bit you can't let that smoke come
[42:49] and get into the cracks of your mind
[42:51] into the cracks of your thinking you got
[42:53] to make sure it's sealed up tonight
[42:58] I say once again this is a time that you
[43:01] must be totally sold out and committed
[43:04] to Christ and in Daniel 1 and8 we know
[43:07] that Daniel had been carried away in the
[43:10] Exile and it says in Daniel 1 and8 but
[43:13] Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[43:16] would not defile himself with the
[43:18] portion of the king's meat nor with the
[43:21] wine which he drank therefore he
[43:23] requested of the prince of the Unix that
[43:26] he might not defile
[43:28] himself now Daniel found himself kind of
[43:31] in a similar situation to what we find
[43:33] ourselves in he found himself in a pagan
[43:36] country and he found himself surrounded
[43:38] by Evil by Traditions that were against
[43:41] his Traditions by ways of thinking that
[43:44] were contrary to the way he was taught
[43:46] to think and by a culture that hated him
[43:49] in everything that he stood for there
[43:51] was a power there that wanted to break
[43:53] him and mold him into their image and
[43:57] make no mistake about it not not just
[43:59] young people but old people alike That's
[44:01] what Satan wants to do in this day he's
[44:03] molding people into His Image he's
[44:07] molding people into his eeden to place
[44:09] in his eating that fit in his eating but
[44:12] I'm proud today to say I don't fit in in
[44:14] Satan's eating I refuse to be molded by
[44:17] Satan's thinking I I refuse to be molded
[44:20] I want to stand out in this
[44:22] day I want to be committed to God in
[44:25] this day and Daniel is someone that we
[44:28] can all relate to because we find
[44:30] ourselves today in a foreign land
[44:33] pilgrims and strangers where Society is
[44:36] against everything you stand
[44:38] for society is against everything that
[44:41] you believe in and there's a banquet of
[44:44] ungodliness that's set out before you
[44:46] each and every day and you're told to
[44:48] eat this is what we feed on here this is
[44:52] what we feed on here eat this this is
[44:54] what you're going to eat and Daniel
[44:55] purpose in his heart I'm not going to
[44:57] feed on that I'm not going to eat from
[45:00] that table he said it it doesn't matter
[45:02] how different I am it doesn't matter
[45:04] what trial that I am it doesn't matter
[45:07] how much power is offered to me I will
[45:10] not let the influence of the world come
[45:12] in and sway the way I think sway the way
[45:15] that I live I'm not going to feed on
[45:17] their
[45:18] junk I'm not going to eat from that
[45:21] table I'm not going to feed on their
[45:22] ideas Daniel desired a different diet
[45:26] amen believe there's a people here
[45:28] tonight that desires a different diet
[45:30] than what's being laid out on the tables
[45:32] of the world
[45:33] today Daniel desired a different diet
[45:37] you know Daniel didn't say well I can
[45:39] have a little bit of
[45:40] this and I can have a little bit of that
[45:43] as as long as it's in
[45:46] moderation no Daniel said I will not
[45:49] defile
[45:50] myself I will not partake of this in any
[45:53] way and you know those around him that
[45:56] were supposed to be molding Daniel to to
[45:59] serve that Kingdom said but but but
[46:01] you're going to starve you you've got to
[46:02] eat
[46:03] this you've got to eat this what's wrong
[46:06] with this food it's Pleasant to the eyes
[46:10] it tastes good everybody else has eaten
[46:12] it everybody else is feeding on this and
[46:15] you need to experience these
[46:19] things you need to be well
[46:21] rounded young people you need to see
[46:23] what it's like in the real
[46:25] world your kids the're they're going to
[46:28] be weird if you don't let them taste a
[46:30] little
[46:31] bit well listen I I I if being weird
[46:35] means they're different from what I'm
[46:36] seeing out there then I'll sign my kids
[46:38] up for being weird if it means they're
[46:40] going to be different from the purple
[46:42] hairs with 47 Pearsons and 27
[46:45] Relationships by the time they get
[46:46] married and marriage after marriage and
[46:48] divorce and this and that not knowing
[46:50] what gender they are sign me up tonight
[46:53] for being weird that's where I want to
[46:55] sign the line tonight I'll just be
[46:59] weird but he says you got to eat some of
[47:02] this but I say like Daniel said compare
[47:06] us to all those that are eating from
[47:08] this king's
[47:09] table compare us tonight from those that
[47:12] that are that are eating that diet take
[47:14] a look at our young people take a look
[47:16] at our homes take a look at our lives
[47:19] and compare and they say well how can
[47:22] this be why why they came to Daniel and
[47:24] said how can this be he said because I'm
[47:27] eating a different King's diet my king
[47:30] listen we're eating a different diet
[47:31] from the world well how are your homes
[47:33] like this and how are your young people
[47:35] like this and how do they serve God
[47:37] because they're eating from a different
[47:39] King's diet tonight they're not feeding
[47:42] from the junk of the world so they come
[47:44] out different and we thank God for that
[47:48] difference
[47:49] amen and God honored
[47:52] Daniel and Shadrach Meshach and he
[47:55] honored them for their commit to not
[47:57] defile themselves and I say once again
[48:00] to you tonight it's time for a
[48:02] commitment it's time for us to purpose
[48:04] in our hearts because God has brought a
[48:07] people right up to to the crossing over
[48:10] right up to the wrapping up of all
[48:12] things and in order for us to finish we
[48:16] must be
[48:17] committed that's what I'm speaking to
[48:19] you tonight on is committed to
[48:21] finish committed to finish because as we
[48:25] said others have run their race and and
[48:27] and they've brought it right up to this
[48:28] point but somebody's got to bring it
[48:31] home somebody has to run the final laps
[48:34] and God has tasked us God has given us
[48:38] the honor and he has tasked us with
[48:40] being the Overcomers of Satan's Eden of
[48:43] running the race in the middle of all
[48:45] the doubt of running the race in spite
[48:48] of all the fears of of running the race
[48:50] despite of the ridicule and despite of
[48:52] the mocking of running the race when
[48:54] you're hurting too bad to go on of
[48:57] running the race whenever you want to
[48:59] quit running the race when it feels like
[49:01] you're the only one still
[49:03] running he said you're the ones I picked
[49:06] to run this race you're the ones that's
[49:08] going to take the final
[49:09] lap you know I I just this week I saw an
[49:13] interview with this great athlete and
[49:16] and and he said what
[49:17] separates people that are gifted he said
[49:21] you have one category of athletes he
[49:23] said they're all gifted he said what
[49:25] separates those from
[49:27] good ones and great ones he said is the
[49:31] great ones train when they don't want
[49:34] to he said they get out of bed when they
[49:37] don't want to they eat right when they
[49:39] don't want to they go the extra mile
[49:42] when they don't want to and I heard that
[49:45] and I said the Overcomer keeps going
[49:47] when they don't feel like it the
[49:49] Overcomer keeps going when they don't
[49:51] understand the Overcomer keeps going
[49:53] when they've been offended in the church
[49:55] they they keep going when they've been
[49:57] hurt they keep going whenever others
[50:00] quit that's who we are we're going to
[50:02] keep going no matter how many Falls away
[50:05] we're to keep going when we don't
[50:07] understand what's going on around us we
[50:08] can't quit because we're committed to
[50:11] finish the
[50:12] race and that's exactly what it's going
[50:14] to take is
[50:17] commitment and it's a shame to say but
[50:20] this is an age that knows very little
[50:22] about
[50:24] commitment it's an age what to put it
[50:27] quite bluntly we're living in the age of
[50:30] quitters when something isn't easy they
[50:35] quit when something doesn't cater to
[50:37] them they quit if marriage is difficult
[50:40] they quit Church upset you quit people
[50:44] have offended us quit path gets hard so
[50:48] we
[50:49] quit but we got to get to the place
[50:52] where there's no quit left in
[50:54] us we got to get to the place where
[50:56] there's no quit left in us because you
[50:58] are going to be presented with
[51:01] opportunities to
[51:02] quit you are going to be presented with
[51:05] easier paths and easier ways and this
[51:08] way it would be easier on you and this
[51:09] way seems like it' be easier on the
[51:11] family and this way it be an easier
[51:13] career and and this way looks easier and
[51:15] that way looks easier and I'm going to
[51:16] tell you don't take the easier path
[51:19] don't take the way that looks easier to
[51:21] your flesh but be somebody says I can't
[51:23] quit I won't quit I'm committed to this
[51:26] message I'm committed to God I'm
[51:28] committed to finishing I'm committed to
[51:30] see this thing
[51:32] through don't take the easy way what was
[51:36] brother brandham told he says because
[51:38] thou H has chosen the Narrow Path the
[51:40] harder way thou H has walked of your own
[51:43] choosing thou Hast picked the correct
[51:45] and precise decision and it is my way
[51:50] what are we saying tonight we got to
[51:52] sell out and commit to his way not to
[51:55] our way or not to the easy way but to
[51:57] his way Psalms 37
[52:02] and5 says commit thy way unto the Lord
[52:06] trust also in him and he shall bring it
[52:09] to pass and he shall bring forth thy
[52:11] righteousness as the light in thy
[52:13] judgment as the noon day brother
[52:17] brandham uses this scripture and him and
[52:19] he deals with it with with committing
[52:21] your way unto the
[52:23] Lord and what he says is that God can't
[52:26] move for you in any situation until you
[52:30] let go of
[52:32] it until you completely committed to God
[52:36] you want an overcoming life you want a
[52:39] Victorious life but you're still holding
[52:42] on to your wants and to your desires and
[52:44] the things that make you happy and the
[52:45] things that bring pleasure to you it
[52:46] doesn't work that way that's not how it
[52:49] works it's going to be the harder way
[52:52] it's going to be the more difficult that
[52:53] way you've got to commit everything to
[52:56] him
[52:57] and as human beings we don't like to
[52:58] give up
[53:00] control you know some people they just
[53:03] they can't not try to fix
[53:07] everything they just have to try to fix
[53:09] it no matter how many times they mess it
[53:10] up I'm gonna fix it this
[53:13] time and they have to learn to let
[53:16] go we have to learn to commit we have to
[53:19] learn to get out of the way and say God
[53:21] I'm just going to pray about it and put
[53:22] it in your hands and quit trying to do
[53:24] everything that I think's going to work
[53:27] brother Brown says we're always wanting
[53:29] God to run errands for us or do
[53:32] something for us but when we're willing
[53:34] to say thy will be done commit ourselves
[53:38] to him commit our ways to him all that
[53:41] we are commit it to him that's when God
[53:44] will move when you're willing to let him
[53:47] work on you and not you work on
[53:52] himo not you work on him but God why
[53:55] didn't you do it God I thought God it
[53:58] would have been so much better
[53:59] if L see we're trying to work on God but
[54:03] he says when you're willing to let God
[54:05] work on
[54:07] you and you know it seems like in
[54:10] life we commit to so many things other
[54:14] than the things of
[54:16] God and I believe in being committed in
[54:19] all things I I I spoke to the youth
[54:21] there at the Ohio camp 21 and older
[54:24] about being committed in all things and
[54:26] no matter what you do I think you should
[54:28] be committed in it if you're a friend be
[54:30] a committed friend if you go to church
[54:33] at evening like Tabernacle be
[54:35] committed if you're a husband be
[54:37] committed if you're a wife be committed
[54:39] if you're working somewhere be committed
[54:40] be committed in all
[54:42] things and I believe that I believe we
[54:44] should be committed at work I believe
[54:47] you should be committed at
[54:49] school I started to say people but can't
[54:53] be a hypocrite I've been a sports fan
[54:55] people are totally committed to a
[54:57] certain team and you know what that team
[55:00] will let you down Time After Time After
[55:04] Time After Time and you'll still be
[55:06] committed to
[55:08] them think about it McDonald's will get
[55:11] your order wrong a thousand times but
[55:13] you'll still go
[55:16] back but let something go wrong one time
[55:18] at church and you're
[55:22] done think about it can we get our
[55:25] church commitment to the level of our
[55:27] McDonald's
[55:30] commitment to where we can at least give
[55:32] people more opportunities and forgive
[55:34] people and we forgive them for messing
[55:36] up our drink order all the time that to
[55:39] be a small thing in McDonald's sometimes
[55:41] it ain't even the right order but it's
[55:44] okay we eat it again and again
[55:48] why be committed and here's the thing
[55:51] back to what I was saying I believe in
[55:52] being committed in all
[55:54] things I I I believe in that but the
[55:57] level of commitment to other things many
[56:00] time exceeds our commitment to the
[56:02] things of God we'll give other things
[56:05] chance after chance we'll give other
[56:07] people chance after chance we'll give
[56:09] jobs chance after
[56:12] chance but let us get burned one time at
[56:15] church or burned two times or burned
[56:18] three times whatever it may be what is
[56:20] your level of commitment to the things
[56:23] of God and to the word of God and to the
[56:25] house of god let's let that surpass our
[56:29] level of commitment to other things and
[56:32] so what I'm asking us to do tonight is
[56:34] check our level of
[56:36] commitment and I want us to go beyond
[56:38] church I'm not talking about right now
[56:40] committed to El I'm talking about your
[56:42] commitment to God your commitment to
[56:45] your relationship with him your
[56:47] commitment to this message that he gave
[56:49] in this last day let's check our
[56:52] priorities and dig down deep for for a
[56:54] greater sincerity and for a deeper
[56:56] commitment whatever we have tonight
[56:59] let's give it to him let's commit it to
[57:02] him and sell out to him see what it is
[57:05] is the devil and God both try to get us
[57:08] to sell
[57:10] out the devil and God both try to get us
[57:13] to sell out and it's in two different
[57:15] ways God wants you to sell out all that
[57:18] you are to him to give all that you are
[57:21] to him even the parts that you find
[57:24] insignificant you a lot of times we
[57:27] don't withhold things from God because
[57:29] we're we because we're afraid to let
[57:31] them go sometimes we're we're
[57:32] embarrassed of what we have to give we
[57:35] don't think it's much we don't think God
[57:38] can do much with it and so so we hold it
[57:40] back and we withhold it but brother
[57:42] Brown says if you're honest and sincere
[57:45] God can appear to you yet in a dream he
[57:48] said it goes to show that anything you
[57:50] have whether it's your mind whether you
[57:53] can
[57:54] whistle right
[57:56] sing testify or whatever you can do if
[58:00] your whole being is committed to God God
[58:03] can use it if you'll just let him do
[58:07] it don't think it's it's insignificant
[58:11] see because we don't commit to God just
[58:13] so we can make it to heaven we don't
[58:16] commit to God just so we can uh make it
[58:18] over we commit to God so that he can use
[58:20] us while we're
[58:22] here so that we can be used in the hand
[58:25] of God while we're here because he will
[58:28] use anything that you give him even when
[58:31] others think it's not very
[58:33] much and I think about the story of of
[58:36] the young boy that had the the Five
[58:38] Loaves and the two
[58:40] fishes and and he was going off and
[58:42] brother Bram said he skipped school that
[58:43] day and he was playing
[58:45] hookie and he was going off and he
[58:47] happened to see uh Jesus teaching and he
[58:50] he drew close and listened for a little
[58:52] bit and anyway when the people got
[58:54] hungry they were searching for for food
[58:57] food and you know this part stood out to
[59:00] me in John 6
[59:02] and8 and it says one of his disciples
[59:05] Andrew Simon Peter's brother saith unto
[59:09] him there is a lad here which hath five
[59:13] barley Loaves and two small fishes now
[59:17] hang on just a minute that's the gift
[59:19] the guy the boy had that's what he had
[59:21] to offer and maybe it's what you have to
[59:24] offer tonight
[59:26] and maybe this is how others feel about
[59:29] it but what are they amongst so
[59:32] many think of how discouraging that must
[59:35] have been for the little boy I want to
[59:37] give it to him but I even heard his
[59:39] disciples say what is this going to
[59:41] do what what is that gift in a church of
[59:46] 200 who's going to notice me doing
[59:49] that how is that going to be a help to
[59:52] anybody it's a little nothing gift your
[59:55] gift may be that you love people and
[59:58] that you make people feel
[1:00:01] loved well watch that that's huge we
[1:00:04] live in a world of people dying for love
[1:00:07] dying for affection your gift may be
[1:00:10] that you know how to cook and say you
[1:00:12] take people a meal every now and then
[1:00:14] when they're whatever it is it may not
[1:00:16] seem like much but I'm saying commit it
[1:00:18] to God committed into his hand and and
[1:00:22] and the disciple says but what are they
[1:00:25] among so many he doesn't see value in
[1:00:29] it brother what could my gift be in a in
[1:00:32] a service like this I'm just so
[1:00:34] insignificant that what I can do is so
[1:00:37] meaningless I I even heard one of the
[1:00:40] disciples let's bring it right on down I
[1:00:42] even heard one of the deacons say what
[1:00:44] good would that gift
[1:00:47] be I can't throw deacons under the bus I
[1:00:50] heard one of the preachers there
[1:00:52] say what good would that gift be
[1:00:58] think about it it doesn't matter what
[1:01:00] anybody else thinks about your gift it
[1:01:04] doesn't matter what anybody thinks about
[1:01:05] your significance he thinks you're very
[1:01:08] significant and he's saying commit it to
[1:01:10] me give it to me what would I can do
[1:01:13] with it I can I can bless the whole
[1:01:15] kingdom of God with it I can dare
[1:01:16] Satan's kingdom down with it I can bring
[1:01:19] joy in somebody's life with it I can
[1:01:21] brighten somebody's day with it just
[1:01:23] give me the gift that you have
[1:01:26] and I love verse
[1:01:29] 11 and it says and Jesus Took the
[1:01:35] loaves that's all that matters right
[1:01:37] there he'll take what you have to offer
[1:01:40] tonight whatever it is if you'll just
[1:01:42] come and put it in his hands and Jesus
[1:01:45] Took the loaves quit dismissing what
[1:01:47] you've got and just give it to him he
[1:01:49] ain't going to turn you down he's going
[1:01:50] to take the loaves he's going to take
[1:01:52] whatever you have to offer he wants you
[1:01:54] tonight he wants all of you tonight the
[1:01:57] parts you think are insignificant the
[1:01:59] parts you don't like he wants them
[1:02:01] tonight he wants you to be committed to
[1:02:04] him tonight whatever condition you're in
[1:02:06] tonight whatever you have to offer
[1:02:08] tonight just say Jesus can have it Jesus
[1:02:11] can have it my life's in shambles but
[1:02:13] Jesus can have it I don't got much to
[1:02:15] offer tonight but Jesus can have it
[1:02:17] whatever I've got I'm just going to give
[1:02:19] it to Jesus tonight I'm going to commit
[1:02:22] It All to Jesus
[1:02:27] before we move on there's some people
[1:02:29] that's got real big gifts they don't
[1:02:30] want to give to
[1:02:31] Jesus I started to go but I
[1:02:35] couldn't if you got gifts in your life
[1:02:38] surrender them to him and let him use
[1:02:42] your gifts because it ain't about you
[1:02:46] well I don't like being in front of
[1:02:47] people I don't like listen don't get me
[1:02:49] starred on what I like and don't like
[1:02:50] cuz here I
[1:02:54] am it ain't about what what you like it
[1:02:57] ain't about well I don't think I don't
[1:02:58] if you got a gift and you know you got a
[1:03:00] gift and it blesses people use your gift
[1:03:03] that God's given you give everything
[1:03:05] you've got to him brother Brown says
[1:03:08] here's what it teaches us that God can
[1:03:10] use every faculty of our being if it's
[1:03:13] committed surrendered to him he can use
[1:03:15] our mind our dreams our subconscious our
[1:03:18] first conscious our tongue our songs our
[1:03:20] eyes everything that we have can be used
[1:03:23] of God if it's committed to God see
[1:03:25] everything that you are committed to God
[1:03:28] he'll use every outlet and every part of
[1:03:31] you he'll use it no matter what it is
[1:03:34] he'll use it if it's Sanctified to his
[1:03:36] purpose and calling he'll use it we just
[1:03:41] got to be more committed to him
[1:03:43] tonight but see the devil wants you to
[1:03:45] sell out in another
[1:03:48] way the devil wants you to be a
[1:03:52] sellout and there's a difference a
[1:03:54] sellout is a person who compromises
[1:03:57] their personal values Integrity Talent
[1:04:01] OR gifts for money or personal
[1:04:04] advancement or an easier path to success
[1:04:08] to make a deal that compromises
[1:04:11] loyalty a
[1:04:13] traitor he wants you to be a sellout
[1:04:17] with what God has given you in this day
[1:04:20] he wants you to take the easier path
[1:04:22] that's a
[1:04:24] sellout he wants you to compromise on
[1:04:27] what the prophet meant when he said this
[1:04:29] that's a
[1:04:30] sellout he wants you to back off the
[1:04:33] promises of God a little bit and say
[1:04:34] well you know it don't have to be that
[1:04:36] way God don't move the way he used to
[1:04:38] move that's a
[1:04:41] sellout Satan is looking for people to
[1:04:44] compromise on the word he's looking for
[1:04:47] people to lay down their rights and walk
[1:04:49] away he's looking for those that that
[1:04:52] that give up on some of the standards
[1:04:54] just a little bit to Over the Bar just a
[1:04:56] little bit for an easier path so maybe
[1:04:59] we won't be so odd maybe we won't stand
[1:05:02] out so much that's a
[1:05:05] sellout and Satan's looking for these
[1:05:08] people he's looking for balam's who was
[1:05:10] gifted he's looking for Esau's who who
[1:05:13] who had the birthright he's looking for
[1:05:16] the 10 spies that that came out under a
[1:05:19] prophet but then they said it was too
[1:05:21] difficult to take the land they said
[1:05:23] maybe we should back off our
[1:05:25] expectations a little bit man maybe the
[1:05:27] New Birth really won't keep
[1:05:30] you God don't do what he used to do he's
[1:05:34] wanting you to sell out your Birthright
[1:05:37] tonight prophet of God says and how many
[1:05:39] tonight how many people has sold out
[1:05:42] their Birthright to the things of the
[1:05:44] world and got away from God stay with
[1:05:48] the
[1:05:49] word he said those spies that that went
[1:05:52] over to spy the land came and they even
[1:05:54] eat the grape that Joshua and Caleb
[1:05:56] brought back and yet what did they do
[1:05:59] they sold out their birth
[1:06:03] rights and you know sometimes it's in
[1:06:06] the message and and we quote it a lot
[1:06:07] and talk about a lot about Elvis Presley
[1:06:11] and how he was gifted and came up in the
[1:06:13] Pentecostal ranks and how he sold out
[1:06:15] for money and sold out for riches and
[1:06:17] sold out for Cadillacs and and we like
[1:06:20] to point to him and use him as an
[1:06:22] example but I'd like to say there's a
[1:06:24] lot of people today that sell out for a
[1:06:26] whole lot
[1:06:28] less than one he sold out
[1:06:31] for people that are willing to sell out
[1:06:34] just to keep a little bit of
[1:06:36] Peace willing to sell out so they'll fit
[1:06:38] in a little bit better at work or fit in
[1:06:40] a little bit better at
[1:06:42] school right willing to sett out so
[1:06:45] they're they're not embarrassed to say
[1:06:47] that I believe God sent a
[1:06:50] prophet and what do you get in return
[1:06:53] except for selling your Birthright
[1:06:56] except for losing your
[1:06:59] Birthright but I believe with all my
[1:07:01] heart that God's got a people on the
[1:07:03] Earth tonight that is purposed in their
[1:07:04] hearts that it doesn't matter what I
[1:07:06] have to stand against what what Hell
[1:07:08] Comes against me it doesn't matter what
[1:07:10] evil is all around me and who turns
[1:07:12] their back on me I will not back up I
[1:07:15] will not give in but I am committed to
[1:07:17] finish I'm committed to stay with this
[1:07:19] message I'm committed to the baptism of
[1:07:21] the Holy Ghost I'm committed to the word
[1:07:23] of God I'm committed to everything that
[1:07:26] God has given us in this day I'm
[1:07:28] committed to seeing this thing all the
[1:07:30] way through I'm not going to take
[1:07:33] nothing for what God's called me to be
[1:07:35] I'm not going to take nothing for the
[1:07:36] experience of the new birth I'm not
[1:07:38] going to take nothing for seeing our
[1:07:39] young people born again I'm not going to
[1:07:42] take nothing for the Rapture and the
[1:07:43] body change I'm not going to stop short
[1:07:46] I'm going to finish this thing out to
[1:07:48] the end I won't sell my Birthright for
[1:07:51] anything I won't take anything short of
[1:07:55] what God has already promised me that's
[1:07:58] the attitude of his bride tonight I'm
[1:08:00] not going to take nothing short of going
[1:08:03] all the way back to the original faith
[1:08:05] that was once delivered to the
[1:08:06] Saints I'm not going to go halfway back
[1:08:09] and then say we don't get the Holy Ghost
[1:08:11] like we used
[1:08:12] to I'm not going to go some other way
[1:08:15] back and say the Holy Ghost won't keep
[1:08:16] us like it used to I'm not going to stop
[1:08:20] short but I'm going to go all the way
[1:08:22] back brother Brown says today we have
[1:08:24] little sensation and little isms that
[1:08:27] breaks us up and separates little
[1:08:30] evidences and little everything else
[1:08:32] that separates us he says it shows that
[1:08:35] we've never come to that place where
[1:08:36] we're completely sold out to almighty
[1:08:38] God and stand on the pillar of his
[1:08:41] Eternal Word and say I now claim the
[1:08:44] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:08:46] Saints not from your lips but from your
[1:08:49] heart not an intellectual conception but
[1:08:52] a born again experience that makes you a
[1:08:55] change creature that's the faith that
[1:08:57] was once delivered to the
[1:09:00] Saints not willing to give up anything
[1:09:03] that God's given us not willing to sell
[1:09:05] out a little thing but committed to
[1:09:06] finish in this age because the currents
[1:09:09] of the world blow and the the currents
[1:09:11] of unbelief blow and and Satan tries to
[1:09:14] wear at us over time and when he begins
[1:09:17] to get you worn down and where he feels
[1:09:19] like you're eroded a little bit that's
[1:09:21] when he comes and begins to offer
[1:09:23] compromises
[1:09:25] he begins to offer you
[1:09:28] opportunities but but because of the
[1:09:30] truth now now listen to me as we go
[1:09:32] through this for a little bit because of
[1:09:34] the truth and because of the light that
[1:09:37] has been granted to
[1:09:39] us because of that God expects us to be
[1:09:42] able to
[1:09:44] stand because of what he's done in this
[1:09:47] day because he's gone to Great Links and
[1:09:50] and done extreme things in order for us
[1:09:52] to recognize his presence that the whole
[1:09:55] world word is restored that the seals
[1:09:56] are open because he's given us that he
[1:10:00] expects us to
[1:10:01] overcome he expects us to be to be able
[1:10:04] to stand and and because he expects us
[1:10:08] to be committed to what he has given to
[1:10:11] us in this world today and a lot of you
[1:10:14] will will know what I'm talking about
[1:10:16] that there's a lot of good
[1:10:18] people there's a lot of good Christian
[1:10:21] people a lot of people who claim
[1:10:23] Christianity and and and I look at them
[1:10:25] and I see people who live a good
[1:10:29] life and they have a testimony that they
[1:10:32] hold with what truth that they
[1:10:36] have they live what they have to the
[1:10:40] fullest and they have a testimony with
[1:10:43] what light they have and the Bible tells
[1:10:44] us that they're going to be granted life
[1:10:47] for that testimony that they
[1:10:49] held so so follow me as we go
[1:10:52] there but you've been given great
[1:10:57] light you've been given a great message
[1:10:59] it's the message of restoration it's the
[1:11:01] message of Malachi 4 and and all the
[1:11:04] truths have been restored and according
[1:11:06] to Revelation 10 all the Mysteries have
[1:11:08] been finished you are the
[1:11:11] recipient of all
[1:11:14] that in other words he committed the
[1:11:17] message into your
[1:11:20] hands he came and gave it to you
[1:11:25] all of that has been given to you you
[1:11:29] know the truth of the church ages you
[1:11:31] know the truth of baptism you know the
[1:11:33] truth of the serpent sea you know the
[1:11:34] truth of godhead the seals are open to
[1:11:36] you he he committed all that into your
[1:11:39] hands what a commitment that he's given
[1:11:42] to
[1:11:44] us and because of that what a commitment
[1:11:47] he requires from
[1:11:50] us we don't have the excuse tonight of I
[1:11:54] didn't know
[1:11:57] we don't have the excuse of ignorance
[1:11:59] tonight we don't get by on we did the
[1:12:02] best we could with what we had because
[1:12:05] you have
[1:12:07] everything there's nothing withheld from
[1:12:09] you he could give you nothing greater he
[1:12:12] gave you the best thing he could give
[1:12:14] you now he expects you to overcome with
[1:12:17] it he committed this message to us and
[1:12:20] now he expects us to be committed to
[1:12:23] it Luke 1248 and I want to go through a
[1:12:26] few scriptures here and maybe this will
[1:12:28] be slow for a minute and that's okay but
[1:12:30] I want us to understand what God expects
[1:12:32] from us he expects a committed
[1:12:34] people a a people who are all in Luke
[1:12:38] 12:48 says but he that knew not and did
[1:12:43] commit things worthy of Stripes notice
[1:12:46] they didn't know better but they broke a
[1:12:49] law they didn't know better but they did
[1:12:51] something worthy of a beating
[1:12:55] he says shall be beaten with few Stripes
[1:13:00] notice the ignorance is actually taken
[1:13:02] into
[1:13:03] account they're not going to get a full
[1:13:05] beating they didn't know
[1:13:08] better they're going to be beaten with
[1:13:10] few stripes and then he goes on to say
[1:13:12] For unto whomsoever much is given of him
[1:13:16] shall much be required and to whom men
[1:13:18] have committed much of him they will ask
[1:13:23] the
[1:13:24] more so notice there's still some
[1:13:26] punishment they don't get off scottf
[1:13:28] free for their ignorance but it's
[1:13:31] lightened you'll find this in numbers 15
[1:13:34] and 29 if we can go there this is where
[1:13:37] this comes from in the Old Testament
[1:13:38] numbers 1529 it says you shall have one
[1:13:43] law for him that sinth through ignorance
[1:13:46] in other words he's going to have a
[1:13:47] totally different
[1:13:48] law for him that sinth
[1:13:52] ignorantly both for him that is born
[1:13:54] among the children of Israel and for the
[1:13:57] stranger that sojourneth among them
[1:13:59] notice ignorance excuses
[1:14:02] part but not the
[1:14:05] whole there's still punishment it's just
[1:14:07] not as severe so so so there will be
[1:14:10] punishment but it's going to be lighter
[1:14:12] that there's how I there's somewhat of
[1:14:14] an excuse there for him that there's
[1:14:17] somewhat of I just didn't know even the
[1:14:20] Jews in their crucifixion of Jesus you
[1:14:22] find that in their defense ignorance is
[1:14:25] mentioned look in Acts 3:17 with me acts
[1:14:30] 3:17 it says and now Brethren I want
[1:14:33] that through ignorance you did it as did
[1:14:37] also your rulers look in 1 Corinthians 2
[1:14:41] and8 which none of the princes of this
[1:14:44] world
[1:14:46] knew for had they known it they would
[1:14:48] not crucified the Lord Of Glory their
[1:14:52] ignorance is cited for a reason for
[1:14:55] their shortcoming their ignorance is
[1:14:57] cited for a reason for them messing up
[1:15:00] in Luke 23 Jesus even pleads their
[1:15:03] ignorance when he says father forgive
[1:15:05] them why because they know not what
[1:15:08] they're
[1:15:11] doing Jesus even pleads the case of
[1:15:15] ignorance but look at those who
[1:15:18] know and choose not to do what's right
[1:15:21] we're going to go back to numbers 15 and
[1:15:23] 30 we read 152 29 but now in 15:30 it
[1:15:27] says but the soul that doeth ought
[1:15:31] presumptuously he knew
[1:15:34] better whether he be born in the land or
[1:15:37] a stranger the same reproacheth the Lord
[1:15:40] and that Soul shall be cut off from
[1:15:43] among his
[1:15:45] people even in like Tabernacle we're not
[1:15:48] going to get by on I didn't
[1:15:51] know we're not going to get by on it
[1:15:54] wasn't revealed to us it wasn't give to
[1:15:56] given to us we're not going to be able
[1:15:58] to get by on being halfway in and
[1:16:00] halfway out look others may may may get
[1:16:03] the punishment of tribulation and then
[1:16:05] be granted life and maybe they have a
[1:16:07] defense of ignorance they stood the best
[1:16:10] they could with with what they had but
[1:16:12] to Those whom this message has been
[1:16:15] committed to those who the seals have
[1:16:17] been open and who the Mysteries have
[1:16:19] been finished what Jesus say For unto
[1:16:22] whosoever much is given of him shall
[1:16:24] much be required and to whom men have
[1:16:26] committed much of him they will ask the
[1:16:30] more even in like Tabernacle we have to
[1:16:32] be committed to the truth we have to be
[1:16:35] all in and committed to truth because
[1:16:37] truth has been committed to us so what
[1:16:40] do we got to be found doing in this day
[1:16:42] is defending the truth standing for the
[1:16:44] truth Walking In Truth living the truth
[1:16:47] not giving up even a little bit not not
[1:16:50] compromising even a little bit cuz you
[1:16:52] won't be able to say I didn't know it's
[1:16:55] been given to you it's been committed to
[1:16:56] you it's been placed in your hands now I
[1:16:58] ask you what are you going to do with
[1:17:02] it there in Revelations 2 when Jesus is
[1:17:06] talking about that church
[1:17:08] age he addresses those from the Ephesian
[1:17:10] age and notice Revelation 2 and
[1:17:12] 2 it matters to him that we defend the
[1:17:16] truth it matters to him that we stand
[1:17:19] for truth it matters to him that we call
[1:17:22] those out that are liars
[1:17:25] he says I Know Thy works and thy labor
[1:17:28] and thy patience and how thou cast not
[1:17:30] bear them which are evil thou Hast tried
[1:17:33] them which say they are Apostles and are
[1:17:34] not and has found them
[1:17:36] liars and has borne and has patience and
[1:17:40] for my name's sake hath labored and HTH
[1:17:43] not fainted what's he saying here he's
[1:17:46] saying you've been Defenders of the
[1:17:48] truth you've stood for truth when others
[1:17:50] would slander it you you've stood for
[1:17:52] truth when others would compromise you
[1:17:54] wouldn't back down even though the age
[1:17:56] began to drift you stood for truth he
[1:17:59] has tried them which say they are
[1:18:01] Apostles and have found them Liars
[1:18:02] brother Brandon points to verse two if
[1:18:04] you go back to verse two and he says he
[1:18:06] says that the work the labor and
[1:18:08] patience here in verse two were from
[1:18:11] guarding the sacred word which had been
[1:18:13] committed to them how they kept away the
[1:18:16] adversaries he says what a credit they
[1:18:19] were to Paul notice God noticed that
[1:18:23] they were committed to truth he noticed
[1:18:25] that they wouldn't back off and he he
[1:18:27] puts it in his Holy Scripture he noticed
[1:18:29] that they protected it he noticed that
[1:18:31] they guarded it and I want to tell you
[1:18:33] in the in the currents of this world and
[1:18:35] the in the movements and shaking in the
[1:18:37] world that's going around us you got to
[1:18:39] protect truth you've got to guard truth
[1:18:41] with your whole heart because if you let
[1:18:43] your mind lean that way even a little
[1:18:45] it'll begin to get Warped and you won't
[1:18:47] know what truth
[1:18:49] is you've got to guard the truth that's
[1:18:51] God's given you hold fast that which
[1:18:54] thou
[1:18:55] pass be committed to finish the race
[1:18:59] it's a message that's been committed to
[1:19:01] us and I'm going to say it again we must
[1:19:03] be committed to it committed to it
[1:19:05] against adversaries committed to it
[1:19:08] against liars and against all the
[1:19:10] currents of society that would come in
[1:19:12] and try to erode it and I say tonight
[1:19:14] evening like Tabernacle don't waver from
[1:19:16] the truth of this word don't water it
[1:19:19] down but say what the prophet said say
[1:19:21] it how the prophet said it take all of
[1:19:23] it take the parts that hurt and take it
[1:19:25] take the parts that feel good and take
[1:19:27] it take all of it and stand for it and
[1:19:31] protect it and be committed to all of it
[1:19:33] because we cannot claim
[1:19:36] ignorance he placed the truth in your
[1:19:41] hands now what will you do with this
[1:19:44] Jesus called
[1:19:46] Christ and now look I don't
[1:19:48] want I don't know how this came across I
[1:19:50] don't want it to come across as a
[1:19:52] negative thing I don't want it to come
[1:19:54] across is a scary thing this is a
[1:19:56] glorious thing why does he expect you to
[1:19:59] overcome why does he know that you're
[1:20:01] going to overcome but why because he
[1:20:03] knows he gave you exactly what you
[1:20:05] needed to overcome he gave you the word
[1:20:08] he says this will do it this will
[1:20:09] overcome the evil day just commit to it
[1:20:12] and you'll make it just commit to it and
[1:20:14] you'll overcome just commit to the word
[1:20:17] this is what I'm giving you to be
[1:20:19] victorious with he expects you to win
[1:20:22] the battle he expects you to overcome
[1:20:25] the age because he's given you exactly
[1:20:27] what you have need of to overcome the
[1:20:29] age
[1:20:31] with you know brother bandam talks about
[1:20:33] it he says countries are always trying
[1:20:35] to arm their soldiers with the newest
[1:20:37] and the greatest and the best and this
[1:20:40] country gets a new technology so this
[1:20:42] country has to go and try to come up
[1:20:44] with another
[1:20:45] one and this country gets new armor
[1:20:48] piercing bullets so they have to come up
[1:20:49] with new armor to counteract it and it's
[1:20:52] constant
[1:20:53] advancement armies Advance equipment
[1:20:56] Advance athletes are constantly
[1:20:58] advancing because of new and modern
[1:21:01] training but see God is infinite and he
[1:21:04] can't never have a better thought than
[1:21:06] the first thought so he gave us the best
[1:21:08] to begin with when he gave you his word
[1:21:10] he gave you the best to begin with when
[1:21:12] he said by my stripes you're healed he
[1:21:14] gave you the best to begin with when he
[1:21:16] said repent and be baptized you'll be
[1:21:17] filled with the Holy Ghost he gave you
[1:21:19] the best to begin with when he said
[1:21:21] you'll be there and your Offspring will
[1:21:22] be there with you he gave you the best
[1:21:24] to begin with just hold on to the best
[1:21:27] hold on to the weapon he gave you fight
[1:21:29] with that weapon and you shall
[1:21:32] overcome
[1:21:33] hallelujah it's the best it's the best
[1:21:36] thing that he could give you it's the
[1:21:39] word of God and he knows that if you're
[1:21:41] committed to it it'll still conquer
[1:21:43] demons he knows that if you're committed
[1:21:45] to it it'll still overcome the age he
[1:21:48] knows that if you're committed to it
[1:21:49] it'll still conquer the devil any place
[1:21:51] anywhere anytime under any circumstance

[1:29:55] if you're really a Son of God if you
[1:29:59] really got what you claimed to have
[1:30:02] gotten he brings constant questions even
[1:30:05] questions about what you believe if this

[1:30:11] days if it really matters how we
[1:30:15] dress listen brother brand he said now

[1:30:50] doubt we live in a world of
[1:30:52] skepticism we live in a world of Doubt

[1:31:04] thoughts but brother Aon I have bad
[1:31:06] thoughts man get in
[1:31:10] line well brother Aaron I doubt
[1:31:12] sometimes get in
[1:31:14] line I'm like the man that was speaking
[1:31:16] to Jesus Lord I believe help thou my
[1:31:20] unbelief we still have those battles we
[1:31:22] still have those doubts and you're going
[1:31:24] to continue cuz he's trying to teach you
[1:31:26] to
[1:31:27] doubt but I love the story that that
[1:31:29] brother Bram
[1:31:30] tells about driving his daughter to
[1:31:33] school and he's in the car and he's got
[1:31:34] the radio
[1:31:35] playing and he's listening to the radio
[1:31:37] and as he's listening he says they have
[1:31:39] some scientists on there and they're
[1:31:41] explaining how the world came to be and
[1:31:43] with some chemicals coming together and
[1:31:45] a few explosions and some sunlight hit
[1:31:47] this germ and because of that everything
[1:31:49] came into existence and and he says he
[1:31:52] got sick of listening to it and he
[1:31:54] turned it off he said he dropped his
[1:31:56] daughter off at school and he started to
[1:31:58] turn it back on he thought no there'll
[1:31:59] probably still be that same mess so he
[1:32:02] didn't turn it
[1:32:03] on he said but then Satan started
[1:32:06] talking to me and started saying to him
[1:32:08] you know Jesus was just a man like any
[1:32:11] other man maybe like a Billy Graham and
[1:32:14] a few people gathered around him and
[1:32:17] believed him for a while but now he's
[1:32:19] dead and gone and that's all of it can
[1:32:23] you IM imagine talking to the prophet of
[1:32:26] God like this a man who had witnessed
[1:32:28] what he had witnessed and seen what he
[1:32:30] had seen and experienced all that he
[1:32:33] experienced and the Devil comes and says
[1:32:34] Jesus ain't even real he was just a
[1:32:39] man and I love what brother brandham
[1:32:42] says let's take a little example from
[1:32:44] this he says I thought how a liar you
[1:32:49] are and then I turned just as I was
[1:32:52] crossing Graham Street and I said Satan
[1:32:55] you that's been talking to my conscience
[1:32:57] I'd like to ask you a few things who was
[1:33:00] it that the Hebrew Prophet spoke of that
[1:33:02] would come who was the anointed Messiah
[1:33:05] what was upon those men who foresaw him
[1:33:07] and told his life thousands of years
[1:33:09] before he got here who was it that
[1:33:11] foretold it just to the letter and when
[1:33:13] he come they said he was numbered with
[1:33:15] the transgressors and he was and he was
[1:33:17] wounded for our transgressions and he
[1:33:19] was and he made his grave with the rich
[1:33:21] but he would rise up on the third day
[1:33:23] and he did and then he promised the Holy
[1:33:25] Ghost and I've got it so you just might
[1:33:27] as well get away from it because it's
[1:33:30] written in the word and every word is
[1:33:32] true then he left just because I give
[1:33:34] him the word that doesn't he can't stand
[1:33:38] the
[1:33:39] word he can't stand the word listen to
[1:33:42] me you've been getting knocked down with
[1:33:44] doubt you've been getting bombarded with
[1:33:46] questions just pour the word on him like
[1:33:48] a doctor pours antibiotics on on top of
[1:33:51] a sickness just pour it on him till he's
[1:33:53] got to leave
[1:33:54] just keep pouring it on him and pouring
[1:33:56] it on him just like Jesus in the
[1:33:58] wilderness it is written it is written
[1:34:01] it is written because Satan can't stand
[1:34:03] the word it is written behold I send
[1:34:05] unto you Elijah the prophet it is
[1:34:08] written to him that overcometh it is
[1:34:10] written by his stripes you were healed
[1:34:12] it is written we shall not all sleep for
[1:34:15] every question he comes to it is written
[1:34:18] I say we start punching back some we
[1:34:20] start throwing the word back at him who
[1:34:23] is it that was to have their hearts
[1:34:24] turned back who is it that it speaks of
[1:34:26] to him that overcometh who is it that
[1:34:28] was seen in the eternals shouting the
[1:34:30] victory who is it that's been called out
[1:34:32] who is it that's been healed by his
[1:34:34] stripes who is it that's been delivered
[1:34:36] who is it that's still standing in
[1:34:37] Satan's edting who is it that's going to
[1:34:39] finish the race who is it that he's
[1:34:41] coming back for it's me it's me it's his
[1:34:45] bride and I'm standing in Satan's eating
[1:34:48] who is it devil it's me I know it's true
[1:34:52] because I see it fulfilled in my
[1:34:55] life who is it that's overcoming your
[1:34:58] Eden
[1:35:00] Hallelujah yes he's going to punch you
[1:35:03] but it's time we punch back it's time we
[1:35:06] give him the
[1:35:07] word hallelujah he's given us everything
[1:35:09] we have need of to finish this course
[1:35:12] hold fast tonight use every weapon
[1:35:16] persevere get up be
[1:35:20] committed commit your everything to him
[1:35:24] and when you do when you cast all your
[1:35:27] cares on him and I love this and I'm
[1:35:30] going to close with this then he takes
[1:35:35] responsibility for
[1:35:37] you prophet of God says he alone has the
[1:35:40] use of that key for he alone opens and
[1:35:43] shuts and no man has that right but
[1:35:46] Jesus himself isn't that right but where
[1:35:49] is the key it's on his
[1:35:51] shoulder but what does shoulder have to
[1:35:54] do with it read Isaiah 9 and6 and the
[1:35:57] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:36:00] but what does this mean the answer is
[1:36:02] this the phrase government upon his
[1:36:05] shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony
[1:36:07] of the East when the bride has been
[1:36:09] committed to the groom she takes off her
[1:36:13] veil and places it over on the groom's
[1:36:15] shoulder signifying that not only is she
[1:36:17] under his Dominion that she has
[1:36:19] transferred her rights to him that he is
[1:36:22] the head but also that he Bears the
[1:36:25] responsibility and the care that he and
[1:36:27] he alone no one else no other man no
[1:36:30] other power has any right and
[1:36:32] responsibility he says and that beloved
[1:36:35] is the Key of David God being Sovereign
[1:36:37] he fornew by a Divine decree exactly who
[1:36:40] would be in his bride he chose her she
[1:36:42] did not choose him he called her she did
[1:36:45] not come on her own he died for her he
[1:36:48] washed her in his own blood he paid the
[1:36:50] price for her she belongs to him and to
[1:36:52] him alone and this is my favorite line
[1:36:54] in the whole thing she is wholly
[1:36:56] committed to him and he accepts the
[1:37:00] obligation I say commit to him tonight
[1:37:03] but brother Aaron my life's in shambles
[1:37:04] he accepts the obligation brother Aaron
[1:37:07] I'm struggling he accepts the obligation
[1:37:09] I don't know if I can make it he has
[1:37:11] accepted the obligation to make sure you
[1:37:13] make it my home falling apart he accepts
[1:37:16] the obligation he's going to see you
[1:37:18] through he's responsible for you oh and
[1:37:21] now he deals with the debt collectors he
[1:37:23] deals with the one coming after you he
[1:37:25] deals with the one that says you can't
[1:37:27] go in you can't make it you sin too much
[1:37:30] he says no no you're going to have to
[1:37:31] talk to me I've accepted the obligation
[1:37:34] my blood paid the price my Holy Spirit
[1:37:36] was sent back I've accepted the
[1:37:38] obligation because they have committed
[1:37:40] themselves holy unto me blessed be the
[1:37:43] name of the Lord he accepts your
[1:37:45] obligation tonight he's going to take
[1:37:47] care of every one of your needs
[1:37:50] Hallelujah he has accepted the
[1:37:54] obligation oh blessed be the name of the
[1:37:56] Lord you stand to your feet with us
[1:37:58] tonight musicians if you'll
[1:38:01] come can you throw your cares on his
[1:38:04] shoulder tonight he's going to accept
[1:38:06] the
[1:38:07] obligation cast all your cares over on
[1:38:10] him commit it all to him and allow him
[1:38:13] to accept the
[1:38:15] obligation he says oh if we could only
[1:38:17] learn to be a trusted servant of God
[1:38:20] like that that we could commit things to
[1:38:23] God
[1:38:24] he says it's the most powerful thing
[1:38:26] that I know of is a
[1:38:28] committal commit thy ways unto the Lord
[1:38:34] yes listen Devil's been battling you
[1:38:38] telling you you ain't going to make it

[1:39:02] that you've gone too far the very fact
[1:39:03] that you're here the very fact that you
[1:39:06] have a hunger in your heart the very
[1:39:08] fact that you desire God shows that
[1:39:10] there's God for you it shows that there
[1:39:13] that there's more for you that salvation
[1:39:15] is for you that that the Holy Ghost is
