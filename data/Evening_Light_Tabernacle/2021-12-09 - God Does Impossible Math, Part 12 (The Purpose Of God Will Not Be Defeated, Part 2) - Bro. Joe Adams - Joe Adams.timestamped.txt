[36:39] from the word of god and we just asked

[36:51] minister to speak the words of life lord
[36:54] and not only that but loose the ears of
[36:56] the hero to receive father we thank you
[36:58] for this opportunity tonight lord and
[37:00] lord we don't want to draw any credit to
[37:02] ourself but we want to give you all the
[37:04] honor and the glory and the praise and
[37:06] we pray lord you'll just be the speaker
[37:08] tonight
[37:09] move now father those here locally those
[37:11] on the stream god made your holy spirit
[37:14] just go out to them and minister to
[37:15] their knees tonight for we ask these
[37:17] things now in jesus name
[37:19] amen and
[37:20] amen
[37:22] if you have your bibles tonight we're
[37:23] going to turn to psalms 34 and as you're
[37:26] turning there just want to say we're
[37:27] glad to have brother tim brother timothy
[37:29] and their families home
[37:32] now come on we can do better than that
[37:34] we're glad to have our pastor and our
[37:35] assistant passing their families home
[37:38] amen i've sure enjoyed the word of god
[37:40] this past sunday brother aaron did an
[37:41] outstanding job and
[37:43] just so thankful we got a wonderful
[37:45] ministry here
[37:47] uh you know when
[37:49] when the first string and the second
[37:50] string are out being used
[37:53] god's able to still feed his flock and
[37:55] we're so thankful that we can be a part
[37:57] of that and we sit under a great
[37:58] ministry and great leadership
[38:01] and we sit under the holy spirit
[38:02] tutelage and we thank the lord for that
[38:04] but we look here in psalms 34 and verse
[38:06] 19
[38:07] and the bible was tell us that many of
[38:09] the afflictions of the righteous
[38:12] but the lord delivereth
[38:14] him out of them all
[38:16] you can have your seats this evening and
[38:18] i want to speak to you once again on god
[38:19] does impossible math uh i hope you're
[38:22] not tired of hearing that obviously you
[38:24] can't be
[38:25] um
[38:26] we want to we want to look at god's
[38:28] purpose will not be defeated
[38:31] part two so and i want to kind of focus
[38:33] maybe a little bit you'll hear me
[38:35] chime in here on unbroken we spoke last
[38:37] time on god's purpose not being defeated
[38:40] but i want to kind of draw an emphasis
[38:41] this week on you know god's purpose will
[38:44] not be defeated but his people will not
[38:46] be broken
[38:48] god's purpose will not be defeated but
[38:51] his people will not be broken you will
[38:53] remain unbroken by whatever this life
[38:56] can throw at you and we find here that
[38:58] the bible says many are the afflictions
[39:01] of the righteous and that word
[39:02] affliction there means bad times it
[39:05] means disagreeable times malignant times
[39:09] unpleasant pain
[39:11] unhappiness misery displeasing now how
[39:14] many of us can testify that we have
[39:16] faced those times in our life
[39:19] we have faced those times of affliction
[39:21] when things were not going our way and
[39:23] in times of difficulty and it seems like
[39:25] every day you woke up was a bad day but
[39:28] we also find the scripture would tell us
[39:30] but the lord delivereth him out of them
[39:33] all so no matter what you're facing in
[39:35] this life no matter what the journey
[39:38] that you're on and no matter what the
[39:40] difficulties that you're enduring right
[39:42] now god is going to deliver you from
[39:44] your present condition
[39:46] where you're at right now is not an
[39:48] eternal condition it's not only it's not
[39:50] your earthly condition that you got to
[39:52] stay in this situation for an indefinite
[39:54] period of time but god will deliver you
[39:57] from that as we heard last week that god
[40:00] let job be purged so he can bless job
[40:03] and i believe god has got a people on
[40:04] the earth that he's going to allow them
[40:06] to be put to the test to prove to the
[40:08] devil that this bar will not fall like
[40:11] that first bride fell
[40:14] so no matter who you are
[40:16] no matter how good of a christian you
[40:18] are
[40:20] we all have afflictions
[40:23] we all go through trials
[40:26] even the ranking center has good days
[40:28] and bad days
[40:30] i remember when i was out in the world i
[40:31] had good days i had bad days
[40:34] and no different for us being a believer
[40:36] we have good days we have bad days none
[40:37] of us
[40:39] are free from the pressures and
[40:40] hardships of this life
[40:42] satan does not care who you are
[40:44] he does not care who you are
[40:46] but we find we have a promise as a
[40:49] believer though that god's going to
[40:50] deliver out of them all
[40:52] brother branham would tell us in the
[40:53] message the un uh be certain of god he
[40:55] said this body
[40:57] that we dwell in perishes regardless of
[40:59] how it's taken care of
[41:02] but it's the soul that's in man it's a
[41:04] condition of the spirit that moves into
[41:06] the presence of a living god that we
[41:08] take this body some of us we take our
[41:11] bodies every day and we take it to the
[41:12] gym
[41:13] and we put it through rigorous work and
[41:16] we we're lifting weights we're pumping
[41:18] iron we're trying to max out and man
[41:20] we're doing all these things and we're
[41:21] trying to define and sculpt our muscles
[41:24] come on some of you young brothers
[41:27] we do this but at the end of the day
[41:29] when your life is over you're gonna
[41:31] perish
[41:33] your body is going to perish this body
[41:35] is going to appear and some of you maybe
[41:37] you don't feed it
[41:38] uh the weights but maybe your feeding it
[41:40] herbs and vitamins and all these other
[41:42] things you got a healthy diet that
[41:44] you're on and yet the body still gets
[41:46] sick
[41:48] it's still going to perish
[41:50] but it's the soul that's received the
[41:52] spirit of god that will never perish
[41:55] so no matter what happens to this
[41:56] outward man here it's the inward man
[41:59] that we're concerned about this out
[42:01] where man's going to face difficulties
[42:03] this outward man is going you're going
[42:04] to wake up and there's going to be days
[42:06] that this body that you dwell in is
[42:08] going to embarrass you it's because
[42:10] every day is going to be a day that it
[42:12] gets more crippled and more uh more more
[42:15] ached in pains and different things of
[42:16] that nature but it's the soul of man
[42:19] that's been occupied by the baptism of
[42:21] the holy ghost that'll take a man from
[42:23] the this earthly realm that we're living
[42:26] in now and bring you up into a heavenly
[42:28] atmosphere it's where this body will
[42:30] never die
[42:31] and that's what we're longing for that's
[42:33] what we're looking for but the prophet
[42:35] of god said you got to be certain of god
[42:38] when you're in your hard times when
[42:40] you're in your difficult stages of life
[42:42] when you're cleaning out sewer
[42:44] pits
[42:45] things of that nature and it's all
[42:46] backed up for 300 feet you got to
[42:48] believe in god that and be certain that
[42:51] he is that god brought you to that trial
[42:54] god brought you to that mess and not
[42:55] only did he bring you to it but god is
[42:57] going to bring you through it and you're
[42:59] going to be a better christian when you
[43:01] get to the other side
[43:05] he says
[43:06] when we've done what we know is right
[43:08] when you've met his requirements when
[43:10] you've confessed
[43:12] and made right and done restitutions and
[43:15] laid it before god
[43:16] i don't care how silent he is he's still
[43:20] god
[43:21] now how many you've ever been in that
[43:22] trial and you prayed and prayed and
[43:24] prayed and it seems like god remains
[43:26] silent
[43:29] god just doesn't answer
[43:31] god i mean come on i'm your servant i'm
[43:33] your son i'm your daughter i go to
[43:35] church i serve you i get up i have my
[43:37] devotion my quiet time and yet it seems
[43:40] like god is a 100 million miles away and
[43:43] he's silent
[43:45] that's when you got to be certain that
[43:48] he's god
[43:50] that's when you got to know that it's
[43:51] not based on what you do but it's based
[43:54] on who he is and what he says he will do
[43:58] he says you've done your works now he
[44:00] wants to see your faith by your works
[44:04] he wants to see what you will do
[44:07] if you've been anointed and prayed for
[44:09] god's waiting to see
[44:10] what you'll believe about it not run up
[44:12] next sunday and run the next day until
[44:14] the next healer comes through the city
[44:17] he's waiting to see your reaction on
[44:19] your faith not walk back the next day
[44:21] and say well i feel so bad
[44:25] you know you come up for prayer and
[44:27] things don't get any better
[44:29] come the next service and first thing
[44:31] you want to do the you come up for
[44:32] prayer and you come up for prayer and
[44:34] you come up for prayer god is ready to
[44:36] test your faith
[44:39] believe on the first prayer that he's
[44:40] god and he heard you
[44:43] you don't have to keep making trips to
[44:44] the altar to get prayed for just trust
[44:46] god and that's what the prophet of god
[44:48] is saying here you ain't got to wait
[44:49] till their favorite preacher comes or or
[44:51] the next healer comes in no believe god
[44:54] be certain that he's god believe his
[44:56] promise if they lay hands on the sick
[44:58] they shall recover
[45:01] that's the word of god it's an eternal
[45:03] work and it has promises if you can just
[45:06] have the faith or latch hold to it god
[45:08] will not fail you
[45:12] he says you've been prayed for
[45:14] well i feel so bad i don't guess i got
[45:16] healed he says you're not fit for the
[45:18] prayer line in the first place you're
[45:20] not right you're not ready yet you don't
[45:22] believe that he's god
[45:25] first thing you do i walk away and i
[45:26] want to quit
[45:28] nobody understands me
[45:30] they don't understand my plight they
[45:31] don't understand what i'm going through
[45:33] if they just knew what i was going
[45:35] through
[45:38] maybe they would
[45:39] it doesn't really matter
[45:41] this is not the time to quit
[45:44] this is not the time to walk away this
[45:46] is not the hour to give up this is the
[45:49] time to hold the line
[45:53] this is a time to fight harder than
[45:55] you've ever fought in your life because
[45:57] we're about to break through and enter
[46:00] into the heavenlies
[46:02] this world can't go much further church
[46:04] i don't know if you've been paying
[46:05] attention to what's going on all around
[46:07] us and i'm not here to talk about
[46:09] politics but for crying out loud this
[46:11] ain't the place for the believer to
[46:13] remain in nor do we want to stay here
[46:16] but we find the conditions are getting
[46:18] just right so that the people will cry
[46:20] for a savior they'll cry out for a
[46:22] deliver lord deliver us from this egypt
[46:25] that we're in we don't want to stay here
[46:27] another minute god
[46:29] but come and take us
[46:31] he says when you openly confess that god
[46:34] is the same god in your life applied in
[46:36] his hands to be lord i am the clay the
[46:38] outdoor potter then ask what you will
[46:41] faith will never move it'll stand right
[46:44] there those circumstances seem to fall
[46:46] from right and left but that faith never
[46:50] moves because you're certain that he's
[46:52] god
[46:55] and if he's god he keeps his promise he
[46:58] can't make a promise and break it if
[46:59] he's god he's got to keep his promise
[47:05] i think we have had in this hour
[47:08] a perfect example that's been laid
[47:10] before all of us
[47:11] i know we we go to it often but i think
[47:14] we have to because
[47:15] he was given a commission or he was
[47:17] given a promise
[47:19] if you will trust me
[47:20] with your life
[47:22] i will use you like never before
[47:28] how many could god ask you that question
[47:31] and every sunday you stand behind the
[47:33] pulpit
[47:34] and you preach with such passion such
[47:36] power such anointing
[47:39] such a glow across your face not down in
[47:42] the dumps
[47:43] not in the molly grubs
[47:45] not woe is me but you're preaching a
[47:48] people up building their fate up that
[47:50] god is a rewarder of them that
[47:53] diligently seek him
[47:56] and he there he is in the condition i
[47:58] listen to sunday's service and brother
[47:59] brown was just going on about the ordeal
[48:01] that he had on thursday at the the
[48:03] doctor's office it was one of the worst
[48:05] ordeals he's ever faced and he left and
[48:07] i hope he doesn't mind but he left the
[48:09] hospital crying like a baby just got in
[48:11] the car and began to bawl to sister
[48:13] connie and yet stood there on sunday
[48:15] morning and you would never know what
[48:17] kind of week he had because why he was
[48:20] certain who god was when god gave him a
[48:23] promise ron spencer if you will trust me
[48:25] with your life i will use you like never
[48:28] before and i believe that even like
[48:30] tabernacle and the bride around the
[48:32] world can testify they have seen the
[48:35] hand of god move this man and use this
[48:38] man under such a special anointing for
[48:40] what to declare to you church no matter
[48:43] how bad it gets god is still god
[48:46] and nothing that the devil will do will
[48:48] defeat god's purpose and the bride of
[48:51] christ will not be broken
[48:54] she will not be broken no matter what
[48:56] test she goes through how severe cancer
[48:59] is
[49:01] she's unbreakable
[49:05] she's unbroken and she will remain
[49:07] unbroken
[49:09] by the effects of laodicea
[49:12] he says oh how satan likes to throw that
[49:14] at you
[49:15] why you're no better than you were when
[49:17] you were anointed how many's ever told
[49:19] you that slipped in on monday morning
[49:22] because you were still feeling the
[49:24] the difficulties of life
[49:27] you woke up and seems like nothing
[49:29] changed
[49:31] well you're no better off than when you
[49:32] were when they prayed for you when they
[49:33] anointed you you're no better off when
[49:35] those preachers pray for you them
[49:37] preachers ain't right in the first place
[49:41] you know i'm satan to tell you that
[49:43] young man come on
[49:44] you get to know brother joe you know his
[49:47] good side is bad side
[49:50] don't amen that
[49:52] but you begin to realize that we're all
[49:55] human
[49:56] and we all have human tendencies
[50:00] there's no cherubims here tonight
[50:03] some of you look like cherokees but we
[50:04] know the truth
[50:06] but we find he
[50:08] and the devil would try to put that over
[50:09] well well i've seen him at like this so
[50:11] i guess his prayer doesn't work and
[50:13] those preachers not right to begin with
[50:15] the brother the prophet of god will tell
[50:16] us it doesn't matter about that preacher
[50:19] it's your faith in the living god what
[50:22] mounts
[50:23] see it's your faith to believe that god
[50:25] gave the promise god's obligated to the
[50:27] promise
[50:28] see it's not what the preacher is it's
[50:30] what god is the preacher never made the
[50:32] promise god made the promise it's not up
[50:34] to the preacher it's up to god and your
[50:37] faith to believe what he says
[50:41] and for ron spencer he said if you trust
[50:43] me with your life i will use you like
[50:46] never before look when he had his first
[50:48] chemo treatment he didn't give up he
[50:50] didn't walk away though he may have felt
[50:52] that way but he stands in the test he's
[50:54] holding the line what is he declaring
[50:56] he's declared to the body that this
[50:59] message works church
[51:00] it'll keep you in your bad times it'll
[51:02] keep you in your breaking point but you
[51:04] can't be held by broken chains
[51:08] you won't be held because god is holding
[51:11] you already
[51:13] the bible will tell us in romans 4 16
[51:16] speaking about abraham and we ended last
[51:18] wednesday on abraham and sarah we'll
[51:20] pick back up there just for a minute i'm
[51:21] not going to go in to great detail like
[51:23] we did last time but therefore it is a
[51:25] faith that it might be by grace
[51:28] and this is uh four in verse 16 to the
[51:31] end that the promise might be sure
[51:33] to all the seed that includes
[51:37] you
[51:39] not to that only which is of the law but
[51:42] that also which is of the faith of
[51:44] abraham who is the father of us all
[51:47] as it is written
[51:49] i have made thee a father of many
[51:50] nations
[51:52] before him whom he believed even god who
[51:54] quickeneth the dead noticed now in
[51:56] abraham speaking of
[51:58] he calleth those things
[52:00] that were not
[52:02] as though they were you know how hard
[52:04] that is
[52:06] do you understand how difficult it is to
[52:09] call those things that is not
[52:11] as though they are
[52:13] when you get up and your body is
[52:14] ravishing in pain to claim that you're
[52:17] healed
[52:18] my father-in-law jerry show me you
[52:20] remember brother jerry every day he woke
[52:22] up and every time he was around him the
[52:24] man fought for every breath to breathe
[52:27] and yet every minute every of every day
[52:30] he said thank you lord for healing me
[52:34] that was his confession
[52:36] he never confessed to waywardness he
[52:38] never not waveredness but he never
[52:40] confessed the results that he was
[52:41] feeling in his body and in his life his
[52:44] dying breath he still trusted god
[52:48] because he was certain that the one that
[52:50] did a work in his life will hold him
[52:53] in his final moments
[52:55] and abraham here he was
[52:58] he called those things that were not as
[53:00] though they were against hope he
[53:02] believed in hope
[53:04] he'll do what's good to believe a little
[53:06] bit tonight
[53:08] maybe the trials that you're going
[53:09] through you can believe that he's god
[53:10] and be certain that he is god then it
[53:12] may make the the cares and the worries
[53:15] and all the the things that you're going
[53:17] through maybe just be so trivial and
[53:19] just
[53:20] dissipate away
[53:22] for he was against hope he believed in
[53:24] hope that he might become the father of
[53:26] many nations according to that which was
[53:28] spoken
[53:29] so shall thy seed be
[53:31] and in verse 19 and being not weak in
[53:34] faith
[53:37] he considered not
[53:39] the deadness of his own body here he was
[53:41] 75 years old already five years past the
[53:45] allotted time and yet god gave him a
[53:47] promise at 75 abraham you're going to
[53:50] have a son not only are you going to
[53:52] have a son i'm going to make you the
[53:53] father of nations this man only didn't
[53:57] look down and his knees hurt his back
[53:59] hurt
[54:00] he had prostate troubles i mean he had
[54:03] all kind of difficulty he was 75 years
[54:06] old but he trusted god or it looked
[54:09] unreasonable it looked foolish but god
[54:11] gave the promise and god doesn't care
[54:13] about your age god doesn't care about
[54:15] your condition god's determined do you
[54:18] serve me will you believe me i'll give
[54:20] you the promise will you trust me with
[54:22] your life i'll use you little bride like
[54:24] never before
[54:26] i'll declare the laodicea i'll have a
[54:29] young person that'll rise above
[54:31] pornography and arise above video games
[54:34] and worthless living they'll rise above
[54:36] the cares of this life
[54:40] being not weak in faith being not tossed
[54:43] about by every little wind
[54:47] every little difficulty
[54:50] every little trial
[54:53] now i'm not making light of your trial
[54:55] i'm just making big who our god is
[54:58] because i believe we face difficult
[55:00] moments
[55:00] we all
[55:02] have been there and if we're not there
[55:04] we're going to be there
[55:06] but see abraham had a lot of things
[55:08] working against him
[55:11] his age was working against him
[55:13] the frailness of his body was working
[55:16] against him
[55:17] the deadness of sarah's womb was working
[55:20] against him
[55:21] sarah's unbelief
[55:23] not able to see herself in the promise
[55:25] was working against him
[55:27] yet the bible says he staggered
[55:30] not
[55:32] he looked away from his body brother
[55:34] aaron
[55:35] doctors can't figure it out what's going
[55:37] on he looked away from it and he looked
[55:39] to the promise
[55:42] he looked away from the nagging wife
[55:45] couldn't see herself in the promise he
[55:47] looked away from that said god no matter
[55:49] what i believe you said i'm going to
[55:51] have a son
[55:52] and you said it's going to come by sarah
[55:56] he staggered not at the promises of god
[55:58] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[56:01] giving glory to god
[56:03] and maybe you're here tonight and you
[56:05] know yours are a lot of things that
[56:06] you're facing
[56:08] maybe the doctor's report is against you
[56:11] maybe your health is working against you
[56:12] maybe your age is working against you
[56:14] maybe unbelief and doubts are working
[56:16] against you maybe the thoughts of your
[56:17] past and past failures
[56:20] are working against you
[56:22] maybe it's reasoning and nervousness
[56:24] they're working against you
[56:26] but instead of looking at all these
[56:27] things that are working against you how
[56:29] about look at who's working for you and
[56:32] if god be for you little bride then
[56:34] nothing could be against you oh brother
[56:36] joe you don't understand i don't have to
[56:38] understand i got a great big god that
[56:40] understands i got a great big guy that
[56:42] knows the blueprint of my life and he
[56:44] knows he's brought me here but that
[56:46] ain't my final resting place god is
[56:48] gonna bring me into a heavenly
[56:50] atmosphere god is gonna bring this body
[56:52] let me be frail and he's gonna
[56:54] come one day and change it back to a
[56:57] young man
[56:58] that's the promise of god
[57:02] the bible will say that abraham was
[57:04] fully persuaded
[57:06] that
[57:07] what he had promised he was able to
[57:09] perform
[57:11] oh he's the same god today brother hell
[57:13] he's still able to perform
[57:16] and therefore was imputed to him for
[57:18] righteousness now it was not written for
[57:21] his sake alone that it was imputed to
[57:23] him but for us also
[57:26] you're included in the promise
[57:30] with abraham
[57:31] with sarah
[57:33] no matter what you're facing
[57:35] no matter what you're going through
[57:37] you got to be fully persuaded
[57:40] fully persuaded
[57:42] god thank you i know what i used to be
[57:45] i know what i used to do i know the life
[57:48] i used to live and i can tell you satan
[57:51] didn't transform that life into this
[57:54] life
[57:55] so it can only tell me and declare to me
[57:57] hey god you that started this work it
[57:59] was your handiwork and we're the
[58:01] craftsmanship of your hand and we know
[58:04] that if you started it you're gonna
[58:05] bring it all the way into the perfection
[58:10] that you had in your thoughts in your
[58:11] mind and that's where we're headed
[58:13] problem will say faith is ridiculous to
[58:16] everybody but god and the one that has
[58:18] it
[58:20] faith is ridiculous they don't see what
[58:23] you see they can't see what you see
[58:25] because you look past what the eye can
[58:27] see you you you feel past what the body
[58:30] feels and you look you look to the
[58:32] promise you look to the one that gave
[58:34] the promise
[58:37] oh the believer that receives it it
[58:39] isn't ridiculous to him because why
[58:41] because by it's the substance of things
[58:43] hoped for the evidence of things that
[58:45] you can't see taste smell fill and hear
[58:48] but he knows it's there it's not
[58:50] ridiculous to him because why it's just
[58:52] as good as done
[58:55] god said it
[58:56] i believe it
[58:58] and that settles it
[59:00] i don't have to debate with the devil
[59:01] about it i don't have to argue god's
[59:03] point god said it i believe it that
[59:05] settles it the case is closed dismissed
[59:08] so you might as well back off devil
[59:12] but see he knows
[59:14] that god told it talking about the
[59:16] believer that has faith and god said it
[59:18] and that's enough for him
[59:20] so when you're facing
[59:22] what may seem an impossibility
[59:26] you know that you know that you know
[59:27] that you know
[59:29] that god still does impossible math
[59:35] let me tell you there's no teacher
[59:36] that's going to come behind him and
[59:38] correct his mathematics
[59:41] he's got the answer
[59:43] and the prophet of god will come and
[59:44] tell us we had the answer
[59:46] to the devil's question
[59:48] he's constantly questioning you putting
[59:50] you through the test to see who you are
[59:52] we have the answer the headship has come
[59:56] oh come on church
[59:58] we find here he goes i like to see
[1:00:01] somebody to take their unbelief and stop
[1:00:03] the sun
[1:00:06] anybody want to try that tonight
[1:00:07] take your unbelief and stop the sun he
[1:00:10] said by faith
[1:00:11] joshua did
[1:00:14] see but your unbelief will get you
[1:00:16] nowhere and we find in hebrews 11 and
[1:00:18] verse 11 through faith also sarah
[1:00:21] received strength to conceive
[1:00:23] and was delivered of a child when she
[1:00:24] was past the age because she judged him
[1:00:26] faithful who had made the promise
[1:00:30] by faith through faith so faith
[1:00:33] is the anchor point church
[1:00:36] you got to look past what you see
[1:00:38] what you smell what you feel
[1:00:41] what you think
[1:00:42] and you got to have faith
[1:00:44] faith is what ties you to god
[1:00:48] and sarah she couldn't see herself in
[1:00:51] the promise
[1:00:52] but through faith
[1:00:53] she received strength when she judged
[1:00:56] declared considered
[1:00:59] him
[1:01:00] faithful that word judge there means to
[1:01:02] be the ruler means to have authority
[1:01:05] over to be the chief
[1:01:07] leading as respects of influence
[1:01:09] controlling in counsel so when she
[1:01:12] recognized that god had control of the
[1:01:15] situation
[1:01:17] she then received strength to bring
[1:01:19] forth the promise
[1:01:21] and when you can ever catch the
[1:01:23] revelation that god is in control of
[1:01:26] your life
[1:01:27] every detail every
[1:01:30] aspect he's the control and influence of
[1:01:33] your life and though you may be in the
[1:01:36] worst difficult moment it's not by
[1:01:38] mistake
[1:01:40] god has brought you there for a purpose
[1:01:45] and when you judge him faithful the
[1:01:47] blessings will follow
[1:01:50] see it wasn't until sarah judged him
[1:01:53] faithful considered him as the leader
[1:01:56] that she was able to conceive and bring
[1:01:58] forth the promise
[1:01:59] it wasn't until she declared him to be
[1:02:01] the chief to have victory over the
[1:02:03] circumstances of her old age and her
[1:02:06] body her paps dried up her womb dried up
[1:02:09] dead
[1:02:10] not able to give life but yet when she
[1:02:13] looked past
[1:02:14] her body and passed the situation and
[1:02:17] she judged who he was and who gave the
[1:02:20] promise
[1:02:21] that's when she could receive the body
[1:02:23] change and when we look past everything
[1:02:26] that's going on around us and we look to
[1:02:28] the one that promised a bridal rapture
[1:02:31] and we look past our frailness and our
[1:02:32] humanity and our disappointments and
[1:02:34] difficulties then we too
[1:02:37] will be made young again
[1:02:40] think about it 25 years sleepless nights
[1:02:42] long
[1:02:43] days wrestling with doubts and unbelief
[1:02:47] will i ever bring this baby
[1:02:49] cannot ever see yourself in it daily
[1:02:51] fighting with depression anxieties
[1:02:54] satan doing all that he can to hinder
[1:02:56] the plan of god
[1:02:58] satan doing all that he can to break her
[1:03:01] and break her will to get her to turn
[1:03:03] around and walk away
[1:03:06] yet
[1:03:08] satan didn't have enough
[1:03:11] see he was relentless in his assault on
[1:03:13] sarah and her mind to keep her from
[1:03:14] seeing herself in the promise
[1:03:16] his purpose was not to break her
[1:03:19] or his purpose was to break her and it
[1:03:20] was also the purpose to block the
[1:03:22] blessing of god and so she had hardships
[1:03:24] so she had her testing though she had
[1:03:26] our trials though she had her
[1:03:27] difficulties but when she recognized
[1:03:29] that she was a part of the promise
[1:03:31] there was nothing that could stop that
[1:03:34] child to come and when you little bride
[1:03:36] recognize that you're tied to this
[1:03:38] promise there's nothing can stop you no
[1:03:41] matter what you're facing no matter what
[1:03:44] you're going through when you recognize
[1:03:46] that everything that he did he did it
[1:03:49] with you and mine and not only did he do
[1:03:51] it with you and mine but he called you
[1:03:53] his bride he says i no longer call you a
[1:03:56] church i call your bride let me tell you
[1:03:58] that's what he's declared of you tonight
[1:04:00] you may see yourself in your sickness or
[1:04:02] you may see the frailness of your
[1:04:04] humanity and maybe you see your
[1:04:05] disappointments but he sees his bride
[1:04:08] being manifested on this earth through
[1:04:10] your mishaps
[1:04:12] he's called you no matter what he needs
[1:04:14] ordained you in this hour to rise above
[1:04:17] it all
[1:04:18] oh we're not gonna fall church we're not
[1:04:20] gonna go down like the first bride went
[1:04:22] down we're going up in a body change
[1:04:24] we've been seen in a vision
[1:04:30] think about sarah
[1:04:32] here elohim comes and visits them in the
[1:04:34] tent and she laughs at them and the
[1:04:36] prophet of god said abraham he had
[1:04:38] failures but he couldn't take the church
[1:04:40] and he can't he can't kill the elected
[1:04:43] therefore he can't kill you because
[1:04:45] you're a part of him
[1:04:49] and if he can't kill you because you're
[1:04:51] a part of him what do you think the
[1:04:53] devil why do we give him clout
[1:04:55] why are we worried about what he can do
[1:04:58] if god himself will not destroy us
[1:05:01] because our union with him
[1:05:04] he's not going to let the devil get away
[1:05:06] with
[1:05:07] his assaults on his bride
[1:05:09] think about what the prophet of god will
[1:05:11] tell us in the message the revelation of
[1:05:13] jesus christ and he's speaking about
[1:05:15] satan and he says now he knows that if
[1:05:17] the people get the true revelation
[1:05:20] of the true church otherwise you catch
[1:05:23] the revelation that you're included in
[1:05:24] this promise
[1:05:25] you're the one that's going to receive a
[1:05:27] body change you're the one that's going
[1:05:28] to manifest the word for this hour when
[1:05:30] you can see the true church and what she
[1:05:33] is and what she stands for and that she
[1:05:36] can do the greater work she will be an
[1:05:39] invincible army
[1:05:43] not broken
[1:05:44] not defeated
[1:05:48] invincible we have had a vindicated
[1:05:51] prophet coming this hour
[1:05:53] brought us rapture and faith through a
[1:05:56] message of grace
[1:05:57] tied up to loose sins revealed the seals
[1:06:00] that was on the back of the book and
[1:06:01] here he's telling you what the devil
[1:06:03] knows about you
[1:06:06] he's declaring to you what the devil
[1:06:08] knows about you that some of you sarah
[1:06:12] can't see yourself in the promise yet
[1:06:17] but he knows
[1:06:18] what's laying on the inside
[1:06:21] oh and what did he say
[1:06:23] he says now oh i love this and she can
[1:06:27] catch that true revelation
[1:06:29] and discern and withstand that
[1:06:31] antichrist spirit satan will be
[1:06:34] powerless before her
[1:06:37] there's nothing can break you
[1:06:40] there's no ordeal can break you there's
[1:06:43] no cancer can break you there's no loss
[1:06:45] of loved ones can break you there is
[1:06:47] nothing that can break you because you
[1:06:50] are an invincible army
[1:06:52] undefeatable
[1:06:55] but you got to catch the revelation that
[1:06:57] i'm tied to the promise
[1:07:00] god is not complete without you
[1:07:04] and everything that he has done
[1:07:07] every message that he has sent every
[1:07:09] word that's ever been preached by
[1:07:10] anointed man of god is for that account
[1:07:14] so that you can see yourself in the
[1:07:16] promise
[1:07:18] oh church
[1:07:20] you are that invincible army that's what
[1:07:23] you are that's not what you will be it's
[1:07:24] what you are now now we are the sons of
[1:07:26] god
[1:07:30] now he says he couldn't take sarah on
[1:07:32] account of abraham and he can't take the
[1:07:34] church on account of christ
[1:07:37] see in all
[1:07:39] of the mistakes it's still his church
[1:07:41] that's right he can't take it because
[1:07:43] he'd take christ and she's a part of
[1:07:45] christ she becomes flesh of his flesh
[1:07:47] bone of his bone all of our ins and outs
[1:07:50] unbeliefs and so forth and scruples as
[1:07:52] long as she's into that body her ups and
[1:07:55] downs
[1:07:56] the grace of god still holds her
[1:07:59] i say thank you lord
[1:08:01] thank you though my soul be converted
[1:08:04] this frail body has its ups and its
[1:08:06] downs it has its good days and bad days
[1:08:10] but nevertheless god still holds it
[1:08:14] see god had a mystery in his mind before
[1:08:16] the foundation of the world and we find
[1:08:18] that i know we touched on some of this
[1:08:19] last week but we're going to touch it on
[1:08:21] and just keep going forward here but he
[1:08:23] said god had a secret a mystery in his
[1:08:25] mind and he says that it's it was a kept
[1:08:27] secret nobody knows nothing about it
[1:08:29] even the angels didn't understand it and
[1:08:31] he said that's the one thing that he
[1:08:33] hasn't revealed yet of how he will come
[1:08:36] and when he will come
[1:08:38] that's the mystery
[1:08:41] and we find the colossians even the
[1:08:42] mystery which had been hid from the ages
[1:08:44] and from generations but now has made
[1:08:45] manifest in his saints
[1:08:48] here can you tie this mystery
[1:08:50] this great secret that he had to whom
[1:08:52] god will make known what is the riches
[1:08:54] of his glory of the mystery among the
[1:08:56] gentiles which is christ in you
[1:08:59] the hope of glory so the mystery of his
[1:09:02] coming is his coming in bride form
[1:09:06] through your failures he's here
[1:09:08] through your disappointments he's
[1:09:10] manifesting himself
[1:09:13] through your sickness and fairness of
[1:09:15] your body
[1:09:16] he's manifesting himself a living god
[1:09:20] christ's a mystery and the prophet of
[1:09:22] god will say that christ had a threefold
[1:09:25] purpose
[1:09:26] and the first thing he wanted he wanted
[1:09:27] to reveal himself to a people
[1:09:30] he wanted to express himself completely
[1:09:32] god in christ then second to have
[1:09:34] preeminence by this in his church which
[1:09:38] is his body the bride until he could
[1:09:40] have preeminence to express himself
[1:09:43] through them god's desire is to express
[1:09:46] himself through your life
[1:09:53] and he thought it not robbery to be
[1:09:56] equal with god
[1:09:58] then why do we consider it robbery to be
[1:10:00] equal with him
[1:10:02] he's wanting to express himself
[1:10:05] through the old through the young
[1:10:07] to the middle age to the adolescent god
[1:10:09] expressing himself
[1:10:11] that was his threefold purpose that's
[1:10:14] why he allowed the fall because he
[1:10:16] wanted to be a savior a redeemer he
[1:10:18] wanted to express himself
[1:10:20] in a way then he wanted to restore the
[1:10:22] kingdom to its rightly position that
[1:10:24] failed by sinning by the first adam back
[1:10:27] to where he walked in the cool of the
[1:10:28] evening with the people and he talked
[1:10:30] with them in fellowship with them god is
[1:10:32] taking us back to that place
[1:10:36] see you have been made for a purpose and
[1:10:38] that's to express
[1:10:40] or to allow god to express himself
[1:10:43] in the form of humanity christ's secret
[1:10:46] mystery was his coming in his earthly
[1:10:49] bride so you're here tonight and maybe
[1:10:51] you think well i'm just a mistake
[1:10:53] mom and dad told me i was a mistake
[1:10:57] you're not a mistake
[1:11:00] you may make mistakes but you're not a
[1:11:02] mistake
[1:11:05] you may fumble but you're not a failure
[1:11:09] you're not some joe blow off the street
[1:11:12] just wandering through life just barely
[1:11:14] getting by god has called you
[1:11:17] you're not somebody just happened to
[1:11:19] hear a message no
[1:11:21] you ordained predestinated to hear this
[1:11:23] message
[1:11:25] you are the elect of god called chosen
[1:11:28] anointed and the prophet of god will say
[1:11:30] you are the very heart purpose of god
[1:11:34] you are the heart
[1:11:36] purpose
[1:11:37] of god now how many of you brothers here
[1:11:39] really love your wives
[1:11:42] you really love your wife man the first
[1:11:45] time you laid eyes only your heart
[1:11:46] skipped several beats
[1:11:52] think about god
[1:11:54] you're the heart
[1:11:56] purpose of god
[1:11:59] not only did his heart skip a beat
[1:12:01] but he left all the glory
[1:12:04] that he would come
[1:12:06] to redeem
[1:12:08] his purpose
[1:12:10] man what a god
[1:12:12] what a savior
[1:12:14] you know some of you brothers you may
[1:12:16] take a bullet for your wife some of you
[1:12:17] you may not
[1:12:19] i don't know i don't know what kind of
[1:12:21] wife you're living with but
[1:12:23] move on brother aaron said exactly but
[1:12:25] god was willing to strike his hands out
[1:12:28] god was willing to spend three days in
[1:12:30] hell
[1:12:32] god was willing to declare himself to
[1:12:34] victor and rose again on the third day
[1:12:36] for you
[1:12:37] because you mean that much to god that
[1:12:40] he wasn't going to allow his purpose to
[1:12:42] be defeated he wasn't going to allow his
[1:12:44] brides to get to the last age and be
[1:12:46] broken by anything that the devil could
[1:12:48] do he was determined that he was going
[1:12:50] to raise her up he was determined that
[1:12:52] he was going to have a bride without
[1:12:54] spots without wrinkle without blemish
[1:12:57] though she may have human failure she is
[1:12:59] perfect because he's perfect and she's
[1:13:02] tied to him
[1:13:04] oh what a god we serve what a god we
[1:13:07] have in this hour oh church you may feel
[1:13:09] like giving up don't give up hold the
[1:13:12] line
[1:13:13] he's coming he's there he's here to lift
[1:13:16] you up
[1:13:22] if you can only realize
[1:13:25] who you are
[1:13:26] that's what i've been preaching to you
[1:13:28] this service so far in last week is to
[1:13:30] get you to connect yourself to the
[1:13:33] promise
[1:13:34] you can connect yourself to the promise
[1:13:36] he'll look away from the awful effects
[1:13:38] of this life this life ain't getting any
[1:13:40] better
[1:13:42] i mean come on
[1:13:44] your trial is different than my miles
[1:13:45] different than yours some of us get
[1:13:47] sicker than others but nevertheless god
[1:13:49] remains faithful
[1:13:52] faithful
[1:13:53] you can trust him when you can't trust
[1:13:55] anyone else
[1:13:57] you can believe that his word is the
[1:13:59] absolute when you can't believe mama or
[1:14:01] daddy
[1:14:03] because he will never disappoint you
[1:14:07] but you know god
[1:14:09] will allow us to go through some very
[1:14:12] difficult times
[1:14:13] what we find in ephesians 1 and verse 4
[1:14:16] he says
[1:14:17] according as he has chosen us before the
[1:14:20] foundation of the world we have been
[1:14:22] chosen
[1:14:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:27] see he says jesus christ is choosing his
[1:14:29] bride just the same as men choose their
[1:14:32] brides today the bride today does not
[1:14:35] simply decide she's going to take a
[1:14:37] certain man for her husband
[1:14:39] now i know how i got little girls i got
[1:14:41] young girls in my my home and you just
[1:14:43] hear all kind of scuttle
[1:14:45] oh he's a cutie pie
[1:14:48] uh-huh
[1:14:49] yeah that boy from north carolina or
[1:14:52] that boy from this church that boy from
[1:14:54] that church oh he's good looking
[1:14:57] then they start planning a marriage i'm
[1:14:58] like really
[1:15:00] really you already got the wedding dress
[1:15:03] picked out you already walked down now
[1:15:04] he's saying i do huh you don't pick him
[1:15:07] out for yourself
[1:15:08] that's not how it works
[1:15:13] no it's the man
[1:15:15] who's seeking
[1:15:17] character
[1:15:19] he's seeking something that's gonna
[1:15:20] display his heart
[1:15:23] display his affections display
[1:15:26] who he really is
[1:15:28] he looks for character
[1:15:30] he doesn't look for beauty beauty is
[1:15:32] going to fade
[1:15:34] but character is going to last forever
[1:15:36] it'll remain and so he's looking for
[1:15:38] that and when he finds that that's when
[1:15:41] he goes and he begins to have
[1:15:42] relationship with and talk to and feel
[1:15:44] the friendship and all these things and
[1:15:47] then in time it becomes a union
[1:15:50] and that's what christ is doing here
[1:15:51] he's choosing his bride his bride is not
[1:15:54] choosing him
[1:15:55] we have been chosen
[1:15:57] because you reflect something that he
[1:15:59] sees in himself
[1:16:02] each of you here though we're different
[1:16:04] from one another there's something
[1:16:05] special about you that's a reflection of
[1:16:08] his intimate being
[1:16:11] you're declaring who he is on earth
[1:16:14] so he's chosen you and let me just go
[1:16:16] ahead and put you on notice tonight and
[1:16:18] put the devil on notice everything that
[1:16:20] the devil has done to you god is not
[1:16:22] going to let him get away with it
[1:16:26] don't you think for one minute that god
[1:16:28] hasn't taken notice of what the devil
[1:16:29] has done to you
[1:16:31] the bible will tell us in second
[1:16:32] thessalonians 1-6 seeing it is a
[1:16:35] righteous thing with god to recompense
[1:16:37] tribulation to them that trouble you i
[1:16:40] say god pour it out
[1:16:44] well i want to be sweet to the devil no
[1:16:47] you don't
[1:16:49] punch him for jesus
[1:16:51] as
[1:16:52] my cousin philip would say
[1:16:54] i'll punch you for jesus
[1:16:56] i'll punch you for jesus and for joe
[1:16:59] but he says in exodus 23
[1:17:01] 23 22 but if thou shall indeed obey his
[1:17:05] voice and do all that i speak then i
[1:17:07] will be an adversary or an enemy unto
[1:17:09] thy enemies and an adversary to that
[1:17:12] adversaries god is ready to take up arms
[1:17:15] for his wife
[1:17:17] god is not going to let the devil get by
[1:17:19] with anything that he has done to you
[1:17:21] you think you're going to pray you can't
[1:17:23] be broken church because god is not
[1:17:25] going to allow his bride to break you
[1:17:28] may be in you may feel like giving up
[1:17:30] you might feel like throwing in the
[1:17:31] towel but god has deposited something on
[1:17:34] the inside there's something inside of
[1:17:35] you you can't be broken you're
[1:17:37] unbreakable in this hour because why
[1:17:39] there has been a seed planted on the
[1:17:41] inside of you and that seed has got to
[1:17:43] manifest the very heart thoughts of god
[1:17:48] before you took your first breath you
[1:17:50] existed with god before you committed
[1:17:53] your first sin you com you existed with
[1:17:55] god for you ever got sick you existed
[1:17:58] with god
[1:18:01] and the thoughts of god are eternal
[1:18:05] you can't die no more than god can die
[1:18:10] see god took a picture and i talked
[1:18:12] about this last week and i'm going to
[1:18:13] try to hurry here
[1:18:15] he said in this life is the negative
[1:18:18] where does the negative get developed
[1:18:22] in a dark room
[1:18:24] very limited light
[1:18:26] dark room has to go through a couple
[1:18:29] different solutions
[1:18:30] i've done photography i took a
[1:18:32] photography course we had to develop
[1:18:34] prints
[1:18:35] you develop them in a dark room you put
[1:18:36] them in a solution
[1:18:38] that solution is acid some kind of acid
[1:18:42] but it brings certain things out of that
[1:18:43] picture otherwise it'd just stay there
[1:18:45] as a blank
[1:18:46] piece of paper and so that's why you go
[1:18:48] through trials
[1:18:50] it's your dark room
[1:18:52] but this negative is only declaring
[1:18:54] there's a positive
[1:18:58] he says now this ain't the real thing
[1:19:00] this is only a foreshadow of the real
[1:19:02] thing that is to come i don't care what
[1:19:04] you would do with it they cannot destroy
[1:19:07] that profile that picture is in god's
[1:19:09] great gallery of affair it cannot
[1:19:11] destroy it's in heaven you could burn it
[1:19:13] up you can feed it to lies do anything
[1:19:15] you want to to it it'll come forth again
[1:19:18] just as sure as two twos is four just as
[1:19:21] sure as god spoken it will come forth so
[1:19:23] no matter what you are
[1:19:28] we are chosen of god
[1:19:31] eternal with god
[1:19:34] and his love is elective love
[1:19:37] before either one were formed or born
[1:19:41] esau i hated
[1:19:42] but jacob little shyster i loved him
[1:19:46] why would he love a shyster
[1:19:49] because he loved you
[1:19:52] because he loved you
[1:19:56] and in revelations 3 and 19 the bible
[1:19:58] would tell us as many as i love i rebuke
[1:20:00] and i chasten be zealous therefore and
[1:20:03] repent and he's brother brown will tell
[1:20:04] us in the labels he and church has as
[1:20:06] many as i love i rebuke and chase him to
[1:20:08] rebuke us to reprove to reprove is to
[1:20:10] expose with the view of correction
[1:20:12] chasten does not mean it's punished it
[1:20:15] does its discipline because of subject
[1:20:18] subject's amendment is in the mind so he
[1:20:20] says it's not
[1:20:21] as a form of god's punishing you but god
[1:20:24] has chosen you and because god has
[1:20:26] chosen you and he loves you he's going
[1:20:27] to allow you to be developed
[1:20:31] because he's got a masterpiece in his
[1:20:32] mind
[1:20:34] and you're going to fit that masterpiece
[1:20:37] through all the trials through all the
[1:20:39] sufferings you're going to fit that
[1:20:41] masterpiece well brother joe it seems
[1:20:43] like every time i walk outside the
[1:20:44] clouds are shining or the clouds are
[1:20:46] gloomy and the rain's popping and it
[1:20:48] seems like this thing what was me what
[1:20:50] was me what was me but the sun is still
[1:20:52] up there
[1:20:53] ever fly in a plane and you just bust
[1:20:55] through with dark clouds and man it's
[1:20:57] just glorious
[1:20:59] says all you gotta do is push the clouds
[1:21:01] back
[1:21:02] push the clouds back because the sun is
[1:21:04] still shining the clouds may hide the
[1:21:06] sun but they can't keep you from the sun
[1:21:09] he's still there
[1:21:11] let me bring this home down here see
[1:21:13] god's got confidence in us
[1:21:15] he had confidence in abraham he had
[1:21:18] confidence in jacob he had confidence in
[1:21:20] moses
[1:21:21] he had confidence in job
[1:21:23] he had confidence in martin he had
[1:21:25] confidence in wesley
[1:21:28] he had confidence in brother branham
[1:21:31] and he's got confidence in you
[1:21:34] because they without us cannot be made
[1:21:37] perfect
[1:21:40] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:21:43] romans 8 and verse 35
[1:21:47] who shall separate us
[1:21:49] let's just stop right there for a minute
[1:21:51] give me one excuse give me one example
[1:21:54] of what can separate us from the love of
[1:21:56] christ
[1:21:58] what can break our fellowship
[1:22:04] come on you've had a bad day right
[1:22:06] but does that break your fellowship
[1:22:09] does it stop god's love for you
[1:22:12] abraham sinned told a lie
[1:22:16] but on the other side of the book
[1:22:18] there never was anything spoken about
[1:22:20] abraham's lie
[1:22:24] there's nothing can break us
[1:22:26] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:22:28] christ shall tribulation
[1:22:32] shall distress
[1:22:34] persecution
[1:22:35] famine nakedness peril sword
[1:22:38] he says nay as it is written
[1:22:40] we were killed all the day long we were
[1:22:42] counted as sheep for the slaughter but
[1:22:43] in all things we are more than
[1:22:45] conquerors
[1:22:48] you
[1:22:48] in the frontness of your humanity are
[1:22:51] more than a conqueror you're more than a
[1:22:53] match to anything that the devil will
[1:22:54] throw at you tonight
[1:22:57] and he says i'm fully persuaded or i am
[1:22:59] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:23:01] nor angels no principalities nor powers
[1:23:03] no things present nor things to come nor
[1:23:05] height nor death nor any other creature
[1:23:08] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:23:10] love of god which is in christ jesus our
[1:23:13] lord
[1:23:14] and he says now and i know my redeemer
[1:23:15] liveth he says now we want to draw this
[1:23:18] first into our mind there is not one
[1:23:20] thing that can destroy us into the
[1:23:23] purpose of he who created us has been
[1:23:25] fulfilled
[1:23:26] death can't take you until god is done
[1:23:29] with you
[1:23:31] don't fear covet
[1:23:33] don't fear cancer
[1:23:35] don't fear any of these things
[1:23:37] don't fear death
[1:23:40] because it's only a pawn in the hand of
[1:23:42] god
[1:23:45] one breath
[1:23:47] out of this dimension is your first in
[1:23:49] that one
[1:23:51] we have nothing to fear nothing can
[1:23:53] separate us
[1:23:54] you're here because god made you for a
[1:23:56] purpose
[1:23:58] god made you for purpose no matter how
[1:24:00] little you are how big you are how
[1:24:02] important you are maybe how unimportant
[1:24:04] you are you are here for a purpose and
[1:24:07] nobody can take your place
[1:24:10] nobody
[1:24:12] you need
[1:24:13] your brother you need your sister this
[1:24:16] church needs you
[1:24:18] and you need this church
[1:24:20] this ministry needs you and you need
[1:24:23] this ministry
[1:24:25] we
[1:24:26] cannot be substituted
[1:24:29] we're here for a purpose
[1:24:31] god brought you
[1:24:32] to this church for a purpose
[1:24:36] and nothing
[1:24:38] god's purpose can never
[1:24:40] be
[1:24:41] defeated
[1:24:43] he says what god has imagined in his
[1:24:46] mind what god has purposed in his heart
[1:24:48] to bring to pass there is no demon there
[1:24:50] is no power there is nothing can ever
[1:24:53] separate god's great immortal internal
[1:24:56] plan
[1:24:57] it must be as god has said
[1:25:02] and he told matthew or he told peter
[1:25:05] here in the book of matthew the gates of
[1:25:07] hell will batter against it but they
[1:25:09] shall not prevail
[1:25:11] there was a war in heaven michael and
[1:25:13] his angels fought
[1:25:14] but
[1:25:15] michael and his angels prevailed
[1:25:18] satan did not prevail over god and over
[1:25:20] god's purpose and neither will he
[1:25:22] prevail over god's purpose for this hour
[1:25:26] let me bring this down to a close
[1:25:28] tonight i want the musicians to start
[1:25:29] making their way back
[1:25:31] see there's something in our heart
[1:25:33] tonight
[1:25:34] that speaks of a land beyond the river
[1:25:37] this
[1:25:39] place that we live in this world that we
[1:25:41] are currently living in
[1:25:43] i hope you don't find it as a place of
[1:25:44] refuge
[1:25:47] my
[1:25:48] every day is a disappointment
[1:25:50] every day you want to punch your
[1:25:51] computer screen
[1:25:52] you read the news and fox news and cnn
[1:25:55] news and fake news and what you don't
[1:25:57] know was news is news and everybody's
[1:25:59] saying the same thing you don't know
[1:26:01] what to believe
[1:26:03] that's why he gave us the good news
[1:26:06] that's why he sent us a message that's
[1:26:08] when he sent us a prophet
[1:26:11] and that prophet came to declare that
[1:26:13] god's going to have a bride
[1:26:16] and nothing is going to defeat that
[1:26:18] purpose
[1:26:19] nothing is going to stop what god has
[1:26:22] imagined in his mind he is going to
[1:26:24] bring it to pass
[1:26:25] god has deposited something you may go
[1:26:27] through trials you may go through your
[1:26:28] testing times you may have hardships but
[1:26:31] god has confidence in you
[1:26:34] think about this when you don't have
[1:26:36] confidence in yourself
[1:26:39] god has confidence in you
[1:26:42] there was a time that i almost wanted to
[1:26:44] commit suicide actually probably tried i
[1:26:46] don't know still think about that night
[1:26:49] was the night i gave my heart to the
[1:26:50] lord
[1:26:52] i didn't have confidence that i'd make
[1:26:54] it through the night but god did
[1:26:56] because because god saw this moment
[1:27:01] i couldn't see this moment i didn't know
[1:27:03] there'd be a ministry i didn't know
[1:27:04] there would be you people that i would
[1:27:05] be rubbing shoulders with 20 years later
[1:27:09] but god saw it
[1:27:10] and god had a purpose
[1:27:12] and though satan tried to break me
[1:27:14] i'm unbroken
[1:27:17] and satan may try to break you and maybe
[1:27:19] he has tried to break you
[1:27:22] but you're unbroken i'm going to end
[1:27:23] with two testimonies tonight
[1:27:28] many of you may have heard of corey ten
[1:27:30] boone
[1:27:32] i loved the world war ii i loved the
[1:27:34] history of it i i soak up novel after
[1:27:36] novel book after book i just what i've
[1:27:38] been doing
[1:27:39] i've read the story the life story corey
[1:27:41] ten boone and here her and her father
[1:27:43] and her sister were thrown into a jail
[1:27:46] they were actually arrested on february
[1:27:48] the 28th 1944
[1:27:50] because they hid the jews in their home
[1:27:54] and they had a
[1:27:56] nazi informant that told toed arm and
[1:27:58] they came and they they threw corey ten
[1:28:00] boone in solitary confinement for three
[1:28:02] months
[1:28:03] because she was sick and i didn't want
[1:28:04] her to expose anybody else could you
[1:28:06] imagine
[1:28:08] being in solitary confinement in a
[1:28:10] little dark room for three months by
[1:28:12] yourself
[1:28:14] satan was trying to break her
[1:28:17] the nazis was trying to break her
[1:28:19] generally people that are left in that
[1:28:21] situation go insane
[1:28:24] they lose their mind
[1:28:27] because there's something in us
[1:28:30] my wife is going to smile here to want
[1:28:32] to fellowship with somebody else
[1:28:34] because we're god creatures
[1:28:36] and god wants to fellowship with his
[1:28:37] offspring
[1:28:39] so there's something inside of us to
[1:28:40] draw us but to be in that situation for
[1:28:43] three months
[1:28:44] said the little ants would come out and
[1:28:46] eat her food and she would play with the
[1:28:48] ants
[1:28:50] mice would run in every now and then and
[1:28:52] she would play with the mice
[1:28:54] that was her former keeping herself sane
[1:28:57] they transferred her from this jail and
[1:28:59] they put her in the concentration camp
[1:29:01] it was a ravens brook concentration camp
[1:29:02] it was a work cramp for women and there
[1:29:04] she had to do hard labor
[1:29:07] maybe beat and punch and things of that
[1:29:09] nature she smuggled a little bible in
[1:29:12] with her
[1:29:14] and you would think my why was she in
[1:29:16] this she was a believer for what she
[1:29:19] knew in that day she was a staunch
[1:29:20] christian
[1:29:21] godly lady feared god
[1:29:24] they had bible studies in their home her
[1:29:26] dad was a great patriarch there in in
[1:29:29] dutch
[1:29:30] and wherever they were from
[1:29:33] and yet
[1:29:34] god saw fit to take this little precious
[1:29:36] sister and place her in this awful
[1:29:39] environment
[1:29:41] a labor camp because she was doing
[1:29:44] something for god
[1:29:45] hiding his elected people protecting
[1:29:48] them
[1:29:49] helping them escape to freedom to life
[1:29:52] why would god turn his back on her
[1:29:55] and throw her in a concentration camp
[1:29:57] and beat her
[1:29:59] allow her to be beaten
[1:30:01] allow her to be broken
[1:30:04] but in that cell
[1:30:06] in that concentration camp
[1:30:09] her and her sister
[1:30:10] every evening after a long hard day's
[1:30:12] work they would have bible studies
[1:30:16] and they would begin to go through the
[1:30:17] scriptures and begin to have bible
[1:30:19] studies and they led over 70 women to
[1:30:22] the lord
[1:30:24] in that
[1:30:24] concentration camp
[1:30:26] what the devil saw fit to do evil
[1:30:30] god used it for his
[1:30:32] good
[1:30:34] we find before
[1:30:36] she was released her sister betsy who
[1:30:38] got very sick had a dream and in this
[1:30:40] dream
[1:30:41] she said that her
[1:30:44] and cory were going to be released
[1:30:45] before christmas of 1944
[1:30:48] well her health deteriorated and on
[1:30:50] december 16th she passed away but before
[1:30:53] she passed away she told corey she said
[1:30:55] there is no pit too deep
[1:30:58] that god is not deep or
[1:31:01] i want you to remember that evening
[1:31:03] light
[1:31:04] there's no trial
[1:31:06] too hard
[1:31:08] there's no pit too deep but that god is
[1:31:11] not deeper steel
[1:31:13] you may be at the lowest of lows but
[1:31:15] god's hand can reach down
[1:31:18] and pick you up
[1:31:22] it was said that 12 days later
[1:31:24] she was released
[1:31:27] she was released 12 days later and they
[1:31:29] determined that it was a clerical era
[1:31:33] and just a week after her departure
[1:31:36] all the women in her age group
[1:31:39] were sent to death
[1:31:42] god doesn't make mistakes
[1:31:46] god placed her there
[1:31:48] for a purpose
[1:31:50] he had seeds
[1:31:52] from all walks of life
[1:31:55] that were thrown in that concentration
[1:31:56] camp to break them
[1:32:00] and yet that's where they found who god
[1:32:02] was
[1:32:03] your trial satan may be using it to try
[1:32:06] to break you tonight
[1:32:07] but you can't be broken
[1:32:09] there's another story can i go just five
[1:32:11] more minutes another story louis
[1:32:13] zamborini
[1:32:14] a great athlete
[1:32:16] he was an olympian started running when
[1:32:18] he was in high school
[1:32:20] because he was a derelict he was a
[1:32:21] delinquent he found running as an escape
[1:32:24] he
[1:32:26] was able to run the 5 000 meter race in
[1:32:28] 1936 in the berlin olympics he finished
[1:32:31] eighth as a 19 year old kid running
[1:32:33] against trained athletes
[1:32:35] he had no formal training he was a high
[1:32:37] school track star
[1:32:39] at 19 years old he's running he met
[1:32:41] hitler he met this one he met that one
[1:32:43] and he had the fastest lap that's
[1:32:46] recorded in olympic history on his last
[1:32:48] lap
[1:32:50] and yet he
[1:32:51] entered the air force and he became a
[1:32:53] lieutenant he served as a bombardier and
[1:32:55] the b-24 liberators in the pacific war
[1:32:59] and they were on a rescue mission and
[1:33:01] his plane went down
[1:33:03] he and two other crewmates
[1:33:06] survived the crash
[1:33:08] they lived on a raft
[1:33:10] to wrath for 47
[1:33:13] days
[1:33:15] now none of you have gone without food
[1:33:17] for 47 days
[1:33:19] none of you have endured the blistering
[1:33:21] heat nothing to block it they didn't
[1:33:23] have umbrellas
[1:33:25] they dealt with heat they dealt with uh
[1:33:28] not having food the rations they they
[1:33:30] went through their rations pretty
[1:33:31] quickly because they didn't have much
[1:33:33] they spent several weeks braving
[1:33:35] blistering heat hunger dehydration
[1:33:37] circling packs of of sharks they had
[1:33:39] japanese a japanese bomber coming
[1:33:41] straight their rafts and put bullet
[1:33:44] holes in them
[1:33:45] and on day 33 one of the men died
[1:33:49] they floated for 7 47 days until they
[1:33:51] floated to the marshall islands and they
[1:33:54] landed on one island that they actually
[1:33:56] named it the execution island because
[1:33:57] very few allied captors ever were
[1:33:59] released
[1:34:01] to cut to freedom
[1:34:03] and on this island they were beat
[1:34:07] they endured experimental medical
[1:34:09] treatment they injected them with
[1:34:11] medication different whatever stuff
[1:34:14] and they were had to tell what the
[1:34:15] effects what they were going through as
[1:34:17] that medicine went through their body
[1:34:19] on three or four different occasions
[1:34:22] and they didn't die
[1:34:24] threw them back into a little cell for
[1:34:25] six weeks
[1:34:27] they endured this kind of treatment
[1:34:29] until they were finally taken to turk
[1:34:32] there they would go to a
[1:34:34] pow camp
[1:34:35] there was a general there a corporal by
[1:34:37] the name of they called him bird you can
[1:34:39] look this up
[1:34:41] because he knew who louis zamborini was
[1:34:43] that he was an olympic
[1:34:45] runner and he was a fame kind of famous
[1:34:47] because he was the youngest they
[1:34:48] expected him to beat the four minute
[1:34:49] mile he promo zamorini with clubs belts
[1:34:53] fists he beat him on a regular basis and
[1:34:55] threatened to kill him
[1:34:57] and one time he was told to hold a board
[1:34:59] a log something kind of like a railroad
[1:35:01] tie above his head
[1:35:03] and if he was to drop it he'd shoot him
[1:35:05] on the spot
[1:35:07] he held it for 37 minutes
[1:35:11] his arms went numb
[1:35:13] he blanked out all he knew
[1:35:15] was that his hands were out
[1:35:18] until finally
[1:35:20] he was told to let it go on another
[1:35:21] occasion
[1:35:23] he received 220 punches in the face by
[1:35:26] every person in the camp because the
[1:35:29] bird wanted every prisoner to hit him
[1:35:32] and strike him in the face

[1:37:06] something drew louis zamborini out of
[1:37:08] his seat
[1:37:10] and he come down that sawdust trail
[1:37:12] gave his heart to god
[1:37:14] the man lived to he was 90 something
[1:37:16] years old i think at this point he was
[1:37:18] 30.
[1:37:19] he lived 60 something years for god
[1:37:23] went around the world declaring what god
[1:37:26] had done for him
[1:37:28] and won a many a soul for god
[1:37:31] oh it looked
[1:37:32] like he was going to break
[1:37:36] but god used his captivity
[1:37:38] god used his ordeal
[1:37:42] because god had a purpose
[1:37:44] and god
[1:37:46] had a
[1:37:46] plan when what about your life
[1:37:50] god has a purpose
[1:37:52] god has a plan and when you feel that
[1:37:55] you're at your breaking point i want you
[1:37:56] to know one thing you can't be broken
[1:38:00] you can't be held by broken chains
[1:38:02] either
[1:38:03] so
[1:38:04] if you're feeling overwhelmed tonight
[1:38:07] you don't understand the why behind your
[1:38:09] life the trial that you're going through
[1:38:12] maybe you feel like the lord's forsaken
[1:38:14] you you feel abandoned
[1:38:16] god has a purpose for your trial
[1:38:21] god has a purpose
[1:38:24] i can't tell you how many times
[1:38:26] in the wee hours of the morning i get up
[1:38:28] and have my devotion and i say god why
[1:38:31] when
[1:38:32] is it ever going to end
[1:38:35] because we're human
[1:38:37] what did i do to deserve this
[1:38:41] and if i could hear that audible voice i
[1:38:43] believe he would say if you just trust
[1:38:45] me
[1:38:46] if you just trust me
[1:38:48] i'll use you like never before
[1:38:52] i'll use a young boy
[1:38:54] a young girl
[1:38:56] a mama a daddy a grandmother a
[1:38:59] grandfather i'll use you like never
[1:39:02] before
[1:39:05] while satan is meant for evil god's
[1:39:07] declaring it for his

[1:39:13] i want to read that here this evening
[1:39:15] i'm closing with this right here
[1:39:20] several of us
[1:39:22] felt led to break free in the spirit
[1:39:23] yesterday this was concerning sunday
[1:39:26] service but we held back needless to say
[1:39:29] that led to a major conviction
[1:39:31] and knowing that we greed the spirit of
[1:39:33] god
[1:39:34] and with that conviction even pressing
[1:39:36] heavenly today on our hearts
[1:39:39] this is the strongest desperation that
[1:39:41] some of us have ever felt this is your
[1:39:43] young people
[1:39:45] mama
[1:39:47] daddy grandmother grandfather i want you
[1:39:49] to listen to this text
[1:39:52] this is our this is our church this is
[1:39:54] our offspring this is our youth
[1:39:56] this is what god is doing in our midst
[1:39:59] this ain't some fairy tale somewhere
[1:40:00] else this is god moving into even like
[1:40:02] tabernacle
[1:40:03] this is god moving into service
[1:40:06] tonight with that conviction even
[1:40:09] pressing heavenly today on our hearts
[1:40:10] this is the strongest desperation some
[1:40:12] of us has ever felt we're coming to
[1:40:14] service wednesday night with a whole new
[1:40:16] outlook
[1:40:17] i pray we come every day with a new
[1:40:19] outlook
[1:40:21] we're coming with a purpose to cut
[1:40:23] satan's head off you know what it's
[1:40:24] about time
[1:40:27] you come with that kind of mindset
[1:40:28] you'll stop taking the blows of the
[1:40:30] devil you'll start giving the blows
[1:40:33] we won't be stopped or hold back no
[1:40:36] matter who sees or what is said our
[1:40:38] praise will not be
[1:40:41] hindered
[1:40:43] you know i spoke wednesday and i believe
[1:40:45] brother aaron may have touched on a
[1:40:46] little bit on sunday
[1:40:48] have sometimes a spirit to come moving
[1:40:50] by and we sit there and we don't allow
[1:40:52] ourselves to yield to it
[1:40:54] he'll keep on moving
[1:40:57] he's going to find somebody's going to
[1:40:58] yield to himself
[1:41:00] that's going to give him due benevolence
[1:41:02] we won't be stopped we won't be held
[1:41:04] back no matter who sees or what is said
[1:41:06] our praise will not be hindered we're
[1:41:08] coming to slay the enemy and stand for
[1:41:11] the truth that god deserves complete
[1:41:13] surrender each and every day of our
[1:41:15] lives
[1:41:17] this young person goes on to say these
[1:41:18] words hit me after service and i was
[1:41:20] shaking very hard and i felt like i
[1:41:22] couldn't breathe writing this out
[1:41:24] i felt for months either in spirit
[1:41:26] leaning in the building around me and
[1:41:28] i'm not sure if it was tongues or
[1:41:29] prophecy but this hit me so hard that i
[1:41:31] felt i heat all over my body my chest
[1:41:33] was on fire
[1:41:35] and the words
[1:41:36] i'm limitless kept repeating to me and i
[1:41:39] grabbed my phone and i typed this
[1:41:42] i want y'all to hear this
[1:41:44] i'm limitless
[1:41:46] talking about god
[1:41:48] god speaking to you telling you he's
[1:41:50] limitless
[1:41:52] you have not because you asked not
[1:41:54] i'm limitless limitless
[1:41:57] you cannot contain me in a building or
[1:41:59] think that i cannot move when you leave
[1:42:02] this place
[1:42:04] it was said that i believe it was
[1:42:06] one night this week the holy spirit fell
[1:42:08] in two separate vehicles simultaneously
[1:42:12] at the same time
[1:42:14] not just at evening light tavern or not
[1:42:16] just the four walls of this church he
[1:42:18] could be moving down the street andrew
[1:42:20] tushner and the presence of god coming
[1:42:22] in in the wee hours of the morning had
[1:42:24] to pull over and stop and just throw
[1:42:27] your hands up and praise god
[1:42:30] we've been there
[1:42:32] never forget that night
[1:42:34] and some of you young people had that
[1:42:35] occurrence this past week you'll never
[1:42:38] forget it
[1:42:41] you'll not he says now this person goes
[1:42:43] on to say my hand is in the midst of
[1:42:45] this and what i am doing cannot
[1:42:48] be
[1:42:49] stopped
[1:42:51] you will not stop believing you will not
[1:42:53] stop claiming every promise you will not
[1:42:56] stop pushing for worship i am god and i
[1:42:58] do not change nothing about today or the
[1:43:01] fear or the negativity changes what i do
[1:43:04] and everything that you have been called
[1:43:06] for there is no end to what i am doing
[1:43:11] there is no end
[1:43:12] to you
[1:43:14] you can't be broken
[1:43:17] his purpose will not be defeated i am
[1:43:19] eternal do not box me in this building
[1:43:23] or moving how you expect me to move
[1:43:25] i have not lost today i have not lost
[1:43:28] ever
[1:43:29] and neither
[1:43:31] will
[1:43:32] you
[1:43:36] neither
[1:43:37] will
[1:43:38] you
[1:43:39] maybe you're here tonight and you're
[1:43:41] going through a difficult trial
[1:43:43] i want you to know
[1:43:45] you've not lost
[1:43:49] don't you just bow your hairs i feel a
[1:43:50] sweet presence here just now
[1:43:52] i know i'm kind of going a little
[1:43:54] lengthy and i apologize in advance for
[1:43:55] that but i believe he's here
[1:43:58] i believe this is a time that we can
[1:43:59] yield ourselves to him and to his
[1:44:01] presence
[1:44:02] maybe life has thrown you a curveball i
[1:44:05] handed you
[1:44:06] as they would say a bag of lemons
[1:44:09] what do you do with the lemons
[1:44:11] you throw them out because you don't
[1:44:12] like lemons
[1:44:14] under you take them
[1:44:16] add a little bit of sugar to it and make
[1:44:17] you some lemonade and have a refreshing
[1:44:19] cool drink
[1:44:20] choice is yours tonight
[1:44:24] oh i i understand that the difficulties
[1:44:27] of this life is tough
[1:44:30] but i want you to know you're unbroken
[1:44:34] satan can't break you
[1:44:36] he couldn't break louise zamborini he
[1:44:38] came he couldn't break corey ten boone
[1:44:40] he couldn't break moses
[1:44:44] he couldn't break william branham
[1:44:46] when he tried to commit suicide
[1:44:48] he couldn't break them
[1:44:50] because god has a purpose
[1:44:52] and god has a purpose for each of you
[1:44:53] that's here tonight
[1:44:56] last week god had a special visitation
[1:44:58] to one of our brothers
[1:45:03] i believe god has a very special
[1:45:05] visitation to some of you here tonight
[1:45:08] this is a time to allow yourself to know
[1:45:10] god like never before
[1:45:12] quit asking god why why am i here why am
[1:45:15] i in this mess why why is it so hard
[1:45:19] now's the time to praise god
[1:45:23] praise god when you don't feel like
[1:45:25] praising them praise him when it's so
[1:45:27] dark outside praise him when it seems
[1:45:30] like everything's against you
[1:45:31] that door may be closed praise god in
[1:45:33] the hallway until it opens up this is a
[1:45:36] time that we praise god he don't he
[1:45:37] didn't say just praise me in the good
[1:45:39] times
[1:45:40] he didn't say just praise me on your
[1:45:42] mountaintops you gotta learn to praise
[1:45:44] god in the valley praise god when it
[1:45:46] gets so tough thank god when you don't
[1:45:49] know what to do thank god that that he's
[1:45:51] in control of your life and there's
[1:45:53] nothing that the enemy can do that can
[1:45:55] destroy you because why because you're a
[1:45:58] child of god you're an offspring of god
[1:46:00] there's not a cancer great enough
[1:46:02] there's not a sickness strong enough
[1:46:04] there's not a depression that's that's
[1:46:06] able to take you the night because why
[1:46:08] because god is holding you in the palms
[1:46:10] of his hand
[1:46:13] and he's here to assure you tonight
[1:46:17] that there is
[1:46:19] nothing
[1:46:20] that will stop you
[1:46:23] father
[1:46:25] thank you lord tonight for your words of
[1:46:27] promise
[1:46:29] we know the service may have been a
[1:46:31] little bit different lord we just
[1:46:32] yielded ourselves to your spirit to
[1:46:34] deliver the way that you've
[1:46:36] have given it to us but father i believe
[1:46:38] firmly in that word i for one lord
[1:46:40] needed to hear these things tonight
[1:46:43] it seems like life sends us
[1:46:46] down a spiraling
[1:46:49] spiraling road and seems like there's no
[1:46:50] end to
[1:46:52] some some of the trials and difficulties
[1:46:54] and sicknesses that we face and maybe
[1:46:56] the doctors don't have answers and this
[1:46:58] one doesn't have answers but god you do
[1:47:00] the impossible math
[1:47:02] you had the answer
[1:47:04] and i believe you are the answer tonight
[1:47:06] lord you're the answer to every heart
[1:47:09] here locally to every heart out there on
[1:47:11] the stream those that would archive the
[1:47:13] service
[1:47:14] you have the answer
[1:47:16] satan
[1:47:17] be careful
[1:47:21] you're picking on god's bride
[1:47:24] you're picking on the anointed the elect
[1:47:26] of god and god it's a righteous thing
[1:47:29] with god to recompense tribulation
[1:47:32] god i'm asking tonight that you begin to
[1:47:34] pour out tribulation on the enemy
[1:47:36] who's attacked your body attacked your
[1:47:38] bride attacked our young people attacked

[1:47:48] through the anointing of your spirit
[1:47:50] that you begin to pour out tribulation

[1:47:55] adversary to our adversary build us up
[1:47:58] into a heavenly atmosphere god
