desire so father we just come and we yield ourselves to you tonight and we pray that Lord you would just be the voice behind the voice Lord you would be the one that would Lord just interpret what the ears are hearing tonight father may it settle in each of our hearts and our souls tonight God may you come tonight in a special way Lord may you minister in a special way in a special Avenue father and just anchor this word tonight in our hearts Lord we love you and we're so thankful thank you the Lord for a place that we can we can come and God we can unpack our burdens tonight and we can have church we can hear from the Throne of heaven so we invite you now Lord speak to us first in Jesus name if you have your Bibles tonight we'll have you look here in Matthew 11 verse 25. Matthew 11 verse 25 and trust you've had a great week this week so far some of you had wonderful I will tell you that I have been in a personal trial this week we replace a transmission in the Yukon me and brother J.R my air has gone out three times this week and just just got it fixed at 4 30 this evening before coming to church so God's good and so we just give him the glory my wife said well you passed a test I said well praise God it's always good when you pass the test right if you want to look here though and I want to speak to you just for a little bit this evening on Stand Fast in the Liberty Stand Fast in the Liberty Matthew 11 verse 25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved a son and he to whomever the son will reveal him come unto me don't notice now the invitation here in in verse 20 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light God bless you can have your seats tonight so we find here in in this portion of scripture we're not going to actually use this for our title but this is just part of the foundation we find there's an imitation that's being given from Jesus and he's telling us come unto me all that are that are weary and heavy laden are labor and under heavy burden and I will give you rest well you can cease from your own works and he's telling us no he takes this word here yoke and this yoke is a crossbar or a band and it's generally used in reference to slavery to Troublesome laws that are imposed on one and he's telling them he says now you've had a yoke of Pharisee Traditions placed on you you've had a yoke of denominational views placed on you but he's telling them come unto me and take my yoke upon you take my yoke from my my yoke is is lowly and hard and it's it's a yoke that is easy and it's a burden that is life notice it's not a strenuous joke though it looks like it may be slavery to some yet it's not slavery to us it's our Liberty and we find here in second Corinthians 3 and verse 17. 3 and verse 17 says it says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and that word Liberty is a state of being free from society from oppressive restrictions imposed on others notice it's the it's a state of being free from oppressive restrictions that somebody has placed on top of you they give you parameters you can't go beyond this you can't do Beyond this you can only go so far you can't go beyond that but I want you to know the Bible says where the spirit of the Lord is there are no parameters There Are No Boundaries there's liberty there are no restrictions there are no limits he's a limitless God and he's telling his people where I am there are no limitations where I am there are no restrictions where I am is freedom notice freedom from oppressive restrictions imposed by man freedom from the law and its bondage Freedom From Slavery of sin and the power and its guilt and its pollution freedom from traditions of man that's been passed down from generation to generation to generation see we're not bound by some man's idea of worship we're not bound by some man's ID or interpretation of the word or even the interpretation of the message we're not bound by denominational restrictions that some man want to place on us their interpretation of it and then try to bind you of it God is a limitless god notice when Pharaoh when Moses went before pharaoh and said let my people go we're going out we're going to a land that's flown with milk and honey Pharaoh said fine you can only go so far he put restrictions on God's people but Moses didn't stand for the restrictions Moses said we're not going only so far we're going all the way and matter of fact we ain't going to empty-handed we're going to spoil our neighbors we're going to spoil our friends we're going to take our young people we're going to take the old people we're going to take the good of the land matter of fact we're not leaving a hoof behind but we're going all the way out why because we they were called to Freedom they were called to Liberty and I want you to know brother sister we have been called to that same Liberty in this hour but you find man again his tries to put restrictions on others tries to hold him in bondage so notice we're not bound by the limits that man want to place on God see man today even try to place limits on God well God doesn't do that anymore that was only for the 50s or the 60s or that was only for brother Branham or that was only for this group or that group notice God tells us that all things are possible to them that'll believe see all things are possible those that refuse to be bound by the limits of man those that refuse to allow man to put the boundaries out there say you can only go so far you have to act this way in church you can't shout you can't scream you can't you can't sing you can't do this you can't worship you can't praise you got to stay there and just nod your little head man's trying to put restrictions on God and God's people but I want you to know the Bible says for you to stand fast in your Liberty the brother man will tell us in the message the mark of the beast he said the Jubilee time has come that we are free do you believe that tonight come on punch your neighbor a little bit let's get to let's have church it's all right notice he says now and the trumpet is the gospel the good news the trumpet was the Gospel then the good news you're no longer bound you're no longer have to live in sin you can go home and be free you don't owe any debts at all the whole Emancipation Proclamation is done signed for you are free so notice where the spirit of the Lord is not there is no Freedom whether the spirit of the Lord is not it's a dead Church whether a spirit alone is not they're held by man's ideas man's interpretations there's no anointing to anoint the word whether the spirit of the Lord is not there's traditions and legalistic ideas and man-made doctrines and man-made creatures they don't have the freedom of the spirit of God to move within the church and deal with hearts and lives Galatians 5 and verse 1. this is where we're drawing our context tonight notice he says Galatians 5 this is Paul speaking Stand Fast therefore in thee not a liberty but it's D Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage for Brethren you have been called you have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another see Paul tells a Believer brother you have been called to this Liberty to thee Liberty God doesn't have a whole bunch of different Liberties and this one here and this one here he just has Liberty and he said you have been called to the Liberty where if Christ has made you free and those it was a freedom from Jewish rights and Jewish Customs it was a freedom from Pharisee traditions and ideas of man and he's telling us that you too have been called unto this Liberty notice freedom from denominational ideas freedom from man's ideologies freedom from sin the penalty of sin freedom from the desires of sin and sin nature and not only have we been called from but we have been called to I'm here to tell you we have been called out of Egypt and we've been called to the promised land we've been called from bondage we've been called to Liberty and notice you are free tonight even like Tabernacle those on the stream you are free to worship God as the spirit of God leads we're not imposing any sanctions on you tonight we're not imposing any restrictions on you tonight you know Church order you know how you should behave in the house of God you know when the spirit hits you know to be free as it moves notice now you are free Church to move as the spirit of God leads you to move some of you may Shout some of you may cry you may sit there in tears just run down your face some of you may jump out of your aisle and dance but however the spirit of God leads there's freedom in the house of God to do just that oh well tell me in the way that they call heresy so do I worship my God and I want you to know the way that the world is calling heresy the way that some of the message churches are calling heresy is the way that we're going to worship because we've been called to be free we're free to Worship in that Avenue we're freed to worship as a Holy Roller ain't my nature try it one time maybe you didn't know you would like it notice the way that they want to call emotionalism you're free to worship in the way that they claim is Pentecostal you're free to worship there are no restrictions there's no limits there's no boundaries there's freedom but you find today man is trying to strip you of your liberties well we don't do that no more God don't do that no more well when did God die and they Place him in his Stead now the word Remains the Same God's word Remains the Same and Paul is telling us he knew what was going on in that day with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the burden that they were trying to place on this new this this new way of worshiping this new way of life beloved God in bondage but I want you to know my brother and sister God has set you free and I'm telling you stand fast in your Liberty I'm not trying to impose you tonight that I want you to jump and shout and then act like a Wallflower no I'm saying God is giving you freedom God is giving you Liberty God is giving you the opportunity to worship as you choose and don't let man impose his restrictions on you tonight Paul's saying Stand Fast otherwise stand firm persevere be persistent that word persevere means to continue in a course of action even in in the face of difficulty you know sometimes it's not easy being free people look at you a little funny come on Church oh or maybe you jumped up and you danced all around the church and the devil gets right on your shoulder you know how stupid you look oh come on you know how silly you looked knowing that you battling this and you're battling that but yet you danced anyway see Satan trying to impose restrictions on you now we find here it means to be persistent it's to continue firmly or obstinately in the opinion or the course of action in spite of difficulties to stand fast in spite of difficulties be awesome let me young people there's ever a time to be opposite is now be obstinate against the devil trying to steal your joy trying to steal your peace trying to steal your happiness trying to steal your thoughts in your mind trying to come over and hold you Bound by your past and make you or make you be defined by who you used to be and not what God's called you to be I want you to know you ain't got to go from one camp meeting to the next count mean to the next count me and go from one high to the next high to the lake now God has called you into a place of Freedom where you can ride from one camp meeting and you can encourage another and another you ain't got to go don't all of a sudden get a shot in the arm like some spiritual junkie no God has called you into a freedom God has called you to a place of worship where you can remain consistent with the things of God he's called you from and he's called you too from bondage to Liberty he said well brother Joe you just don't understand what I'm going through it seems like all hell let's turn loose on me well praise God wake up we're all in the same battle tells us and I know some of these quotes we read a pretty good bit but I want you to understand the reason why we keep rehearsing some of these quotes is to reassure you and it's to encourage you don't give up we're all fighting the same adversary we're all in the same battle though it may be a little bit different but you say oh hell is against me and the prophet of God will tell us when all hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose also so quit getting your eyes on what hell is doing and get so fixated on what hell is doing and start expecting what God is about to do because God has called you to a place of Liberty start expecting God you see the hell I'm in I'm ready to see the heaven come down because he said notice he said when the enemy comes in like a flood he would raise up a standard to match the opposing enemy he'll raise up an anointing he'll raise her you'll come into a church service church and you may not get anything or think you're going to get anything from it but it's the service you need it's the time that you need it's the personal encounter that you need and God begins to begin to rehearse your conversation and begin to come back and begin to tell you things what was he doing he's reassuring you I'm raising that standard I've seen you in your dark moments I've seen you in your night Seasons I've seen you in your low points but I'm here to tell you I'm with you I'm with you you're free you don't have to be held by that bondage don't listen to the LIE of the enemy he's trying to bring you back down notice what we find today the believer is under constant attack hell is trying to keep you in its grip some of you have already came back from Ohio camp and Satan's already tried to get you back in its grip what is hell trying to do is trying to keep you from walking out as we heard a few weeks ago trying to keep you from walking out trying to strip you of your freedom he doesn't want you to be free to live free to worship free and even act free he wants to control you control every desire he wants to bring you to a sinner's grave in a devil's hell to make his hell your final resting place but I'm here to tell you God's called us for something greater God's called us for something greater program says now in the message the Queen of Sheba but you know when you start to meet God the devil is going to throw everything in your way wake up somebody when you go to try to meet God and that was going to throw everything in your way that he can to throw in your way that's his duty to do it he's going to hinder you in every way that he can but if you're determined God Will Make A Way I said oh blessed be the name of I'm determined tonight I'm not just living it for Mama I'm not just living this for Daddy I'm not just here because a preacher is my favorite preacher I'm here because I'm determined I'm going all the way I've been called out to me according to your word we're free people tonight Church Stand Fast in that Liberty you say well well brother Joe no it ain't no well brother Joe this and well brother Joe that is no God has called you to a place of Liberty it's not one day you're free the next day you're in bondage it's not one day you're saved the next day you're you're a sinner it's not one day that you're free the next day you're in bondage it's your free get it you're free see the truth is we find in John 8. and the servant about it this is John 8 verse 35. the servant about it not in the house forever but the son abideth forever and that the son therefore shall make or set at Liberty or liberate you you are free you are free indeed so if the son has done it how many years the son has made free then you're free indeed no questions asked we're not up for debate it's not there's a scripture it's black and white put that in the devil's face and tell them I've been made free I've been liberated from my past I've been liberated from the change that used to hold me you can't hold me any longer you can't keep me in your grip any longer I've been made free by the blood of Jesus because the son of almighty God has liberated me from my past and the passions of sin and the desires of a sinful nature notice brother Brown tells us in the message kinsman redeemer a man that's done something wrong so he is his master of Sodom into slavery actually unto death and he's in the market and he's a slave but a man comes along a worthy man that's able to do it and he finds this man and he finds Grace in his sight he redeems him he says that that takes him from the slave market takes him out of himself notice and that slave once redeemed can never be sold in the market again can never be sold again he's marked and if he was a thought if he was thought enough of one time to be redeemed no one notice now no one can never sell him again for a Slave he says thanks be to God that when a man has come to Christ had been redeemed by the precious blood the devil can never make you a slave again come on church that's shouting grounds I'm here to tell you I don't know what you come in packing Burns tonight but you're not a slave any longer you've been redeemed and you can know Hallelujah you can never be sold again as a slave you've been liberated you've been set free you don't have to hold anything to your past and to those mistakes the mighty redeemers come down and he sent you in Liberty tonight you ain't got to look over your shoulder worry about you're going to go back and see it what about what you're going to lose the Holy Ghost you're gonna lose your death you're going to lose your joy you can't lose it because you can't be held as a slave man and again you've been made free by the blood you've been made free by the anointing of the hour he is loose too he has liberated you take my yoke my burden is easy and my burn is light notice see as Christ has made us free and it's a gift we fight here in Ephesians 2 and verse 8 the Bible says for it is by grace that you are saved through faith and that is not of yourselves it is a gift of God so your freedom is a gift your bondage is a curse but your freedom is a gift and the Bible says the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus so notice When we struggle to free ourselves how many you've ever struggled man you tried within your own human ability you tried and tried guess what you did you made it worse the Bible says don't entangle yourselves again and when you try to free yourself you're just entangling yourself worse and worse that situation would have been done a long time ago if you just let go and let God notice When we struggle to free ourselves we just become more entangled again with a yoke of bondage you can't free yourself from sinful desire you young people here you can't free yourselves from the spirit of pornography of this age it takes something bigger than you something greater than you it takes a living God notice we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and yet we try to do these things in them in post I'm not going to do that and we come legalistic in our views look having a legalistic Viewpoint is only making matters worse because now it's based on works and not on Grace but we find see it's going to take something better than our own intellect it's going to take something better than man's ability something stronger to to free us from the bondage of sin it would take a lamb of God who would be slain before the foundation of the world let me tell you that that lamb has ever been bled on your behalf you're free you're free to worship any way you choose the Bible tells us in Romans 5 verse 19 for as by one man Disobedience many were made Sinners so about one man's Disobedience many many of you were once Sinners oh but church he says but by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous I'm here to tell you it took that one it ain't a whole bunch of men a whole bunch of favorite preachers a whole bunch of Camp means it took one man that'd be willing to take your place and that you would take he would take your sin that you could take his races and what did he do he liberated us he freed us from our passions our pride our iniquities if we go back to Galatians 4 and verse 30. Galatians 4 and verse 30 and I'm picking up in Galatians 4 because you actually to get to Galatians 5 1 you got to come back here it says nevertheless what's saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the bond moment shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman verse 31 so then brethren we are not children of the bond moment but of the free come on we're not children of denominational systems Bound by man's ideas and Creeds and doctrines and and everything else no but we are free Galatians 5 and verse 1 and he says now Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty notice the Liberty you're not bound any longer you're not held under that bondwoman religion any longer but no now you're free wherewith Christ has made you free and be not entangled again notice a warning don't be entangled again you have been called unto Liberty therefore don't use Liberty as an occasion to the flesh don't make Grace disgrace so it's the Christian's Birthright to think to feel and to act like a free man did you hear that it's the Christians the believer's birthright to act to feel and to to to act and to feel like a free man and to think like a free man you ain't got to have slave mentality no we shall now or not allow ourselves to become slaves again and typically slavery but starts here before it starts here it's what you think in your mind well I guess I'm not saved and all of a sudden now you're putting yourself in front of every dirty television program or reading every dirty book everything love story that ain't fit to be read because right here notice we've done the study on the battle of the mind but we find now we are to be firm unyielding in maintaining the great principles of our Christian faith see our true Liberty you find people today they're running out oh I'm I'm leaving the message I'm free first thing the ladies do is cut their hair and yet you're free a Bible completely tells us how a lady's hair should be they put on past the Bible completely tells us and the men do this that and the other in the Bible we have this is not brother branham's idea this is God's idea this is God's interpretation of the word and yet now they're free and so they run out on it and they thinking they're free they run head long and the first thing you know the girls they cut their hair then they start wearing their makeup then they start putting on the pants and before too long they keep on keep going on and on and they question the message then they're getting to question God then before too long they're not even in church they are completely as Gnostic or they're atheists it's a slippery slope Church because they've used their freedom and enslaved their self again with the enticements of the world see true Liberty is our freedom from the tyranny of trying to earn your way to heaven trying to earn your way to heaven I got to do this and I got to do that you ain't got to do nothing but believe by faith take God at his word see Freedom Stand Fast means that means we have something to do so Stand Fast means it's going to take some effort brother Mike I mean you got to stand Resolute when all the attacks coming from family from friends from work from school from this from that and the other and then for once you've got to stand fast in your freedom realize God and God Alone set me in this place I'm not wavering I'm not moving I'm going to be Resolute I'm going to be obstinate in the face of difficulty I know some of us have a hard time being after that don't we um look at all the smiles on the faces but we find how many of you ever heard of Dwight Moody most of us have Dwight Moody he Illustrated a point of quote an old former slave a former slave woman at this in the South following a Civil War and being that she was a former slave she was confused about her status now I know we have black people here and I'm not I'm not referencing this in any derogatory sense but this is Dwight Moody and this is in the histories he said and he's quoting this this former slave she says now now as I free or been I not when I go to my old Master he says I ain't free and when I go to my own people they say I is and I don't know whether I'm fear is I'm not a lot of you stand in that same place I come to church and the preacher tells me I'm free but when I go back out there they say I'm not my old Taskmaster that old thought that old depression out on anxiety that old pornography spirit that oh this spirit and that lustful Spirit tells me that I'm not free and she goes on she says now some people told me that Abraham Lincoln signed the the proclamation but Master says he didn't he didn't have a right to and that's the same thing that that old Taskmaster does to you he tells you he don't have a right to sign that you're still under my bondage you're still under my grip you're still under my restrictions but I want you to know you have been signed sealed and delivered the Emancipation Proclamation has been signed in your behalf you are free tonight I want you to know it I'm going to preach Freedom I'm going to live Freedom I'm going to declare that you're free you're not held any longer by the chains of Darkness I say it in the face of the enemy House of hell you give way to the name of Jesus you can't hold God's leg you can't keep him found any longer they have been made free tonight Satan wants to tell you you got to be a slate of my passion say to my pride say to my depression and anxieties and bitterness and grudges family strains and complexes unforgiving Spirits gossiping bike biting but I want you to know you're free tonight keto had to be bound by those things you are free the Emancipation Proclamation has been signed what do you mean brother Joe let me

the Nashville I'm free the emancipator the great emancipator sign my pardon House of hell you can't hold me notice when you go back and look at that they were being held by Church of Christ mentality they were all twisted up in their minds and their thoughts oh and the prophet of God now the Lord told him he said free the people he looked at his arms a little skinny arms he got I ain't got no muscles can't break those bars look at those big bars big denominational bars Bears holding people behind it year after year day after day generation after generation has been held behind there and the people said brother Ben you have been misunderstood and you misunderstood the people but the Lord said I want you to free the people what did he do he sent you a message God sent you a message to do what to liberate you from the house of hell he looked at the bars humanly speaking he couldn't do it and let me tell you I'm looking at the bars tonight humanly speaking I can't do it but I'm praying in the name of the Lord that he'll send that word he'll send the winner the Holy Ghost and speak oh in the name of Jesus House of hell you give way tonight and he said all of a sudden the bar started creaking and the bar started popping and everybody went out free no longer held in bondage no longer held in sins passed no longer held by denomination on it you are free tonight God sent you a message and it liberated you so Stand Fast in that freedom Stand Fast in that Liberty the house of hell can't hold you notice the whole emancipation of proclamation is done signed and you are free say that Calvary the emancipation of Proclamation was signed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and everything that Satan ever did to you he was stripped of every Power he had at Calvary oh some of you come dragging in because Satan's been lying on you Satan been accused I'm here to tell you he's been stripped oh come on man what's it going to get to excite that nerve on the inside let me tell you if I was held in the and the door Chief facility over here something I didn't do and they held me against my will they impose their sanctions on me I'd be a little upset man I'll be ready to call me a lawyer somebody needs to call up lawyer Jesus you held against your own will you are falsely accused but uh let me tell you when they try me and they realize you were convicted wrong you were convicted and justly I'm Gonna Let You Go let me tell you when I come walking out I'm dancing I'm shout out praising God you held me here against my will I'm running out here I ain't dragging out I will put there by by some man's idea some man's interpretation but I'll walk it out on my own designs why because I got a reason to be free I never done it in the first place and I'm going to tell you tonight evening light you've never done it in the first place in the first place you was in the very thoughts of God notice now when I hear that Jesus broke the bands of death he broke the bonds of bondage from me he signed the emancipation of proclamation with his own blood he went to death at Calvary for me I want today to crucify all the Flesh and live a new for him and take what he gives me and fight as best as I can this great rank Army of God until Jesus comes oh Church put your whole heart behind this this is not some hot man's idea the Bible tells us in second Thessalonians 2 and verse 3 let no man deceive you let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first that the man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition notice deceive here is to believe something that is not true typically in order to gain some personal advantage so deception is a yoke that men place on another to hold control over their life you know the Jewish teachers they counted 613 Commandments that is a Jew you had to memorize now how many can remember our 613 Commandments or nobody not only did they had to memorize them but they couldn't break them either they had to abide by them you want to talk about a law you want to talk about a restriction you want to talk about a bondage and men today will take this very message this very message that God sent you to liberate you and hold you in bondage to it you don't believe it the way I believe it you got to get my sermons if you plan on being in a rapture nobody I didn't see your name tacked in this word anywhere notice what they're doing many legalistic man a legalistic preacher they want to put a message yoke on you you find today that they want to force Holiness and legislate righteousness can't force holiness you can't legislate righteousness it comes from a holy God living on the inside some of these men are so afraid of a little bit of wildfire a little bit of fanaticisms and I may get with our young people and some of our old people some of them that are really free they're not afraid to be free and they want to criticize them because they're freedom because they're they're no longer in bondage you know in order to be able to dance in the spirit to shout in the spirit you got to First free your mind from this right here what is somebody going to think about me if you can ever get your mind to get free worrying about what your neighbor thinks what your brother thinks what your husband thinks or what your wife thinks buddy I'm gonna tell you you'll have a time in the Holy Ghost you are your greatest enemy if you can ever free your mind I just want to say try it one time try it one time I don't do it all the time but I tell you what when I do it I have a good time I may well and flail and shout and scream and it don't slobber and spit hey just get away it's coming I want to enjoy my time in his presence if I went to the Juke Joint I enjoyed my time brother Jeff oh yeah some of us we remember those moments in the Juke Joint the music going man that certain song starts going oh oh you just don't all of a sudden man you just bouncing from my I mean whoa you probably never been there praise God but I'm gonna tell you why that's my you'll be sitting there just minding your own business officer and that song oh yeah boom you're on the Dance Floor oh yeah come on get down all that and then we get to the house of God and the words coming I'm not talking about music I'm talking about the word being priest and that word begins to start something and it begins to break the chains off your life it begins to tell you who you are because take where you come from and where you're going and you tell me I gotta sit there and I like ain't nothing happening I heard where the my brother Tim said the other day he said you can't be touched by the Holy Ghost and not get emotional I say oh blessed be the name of the lord I Love to Worship and I respond to it because I am free and I don't plan on standing there in my freedom in my Liberty you can take your Church of Christ attitude right on up out of here for me and my church me and my family we're going to enjoy the presence of God well I don't think you got to do that in church fine you're welcome to leave I told you we're not putting any restrictions on you you're free to worship as he leads just stand fast in your Liberty Don't Be Afraid notice so the purpose of God sending us this message was to liberate you from man's hold man's ideas why do we have so many denominations because they all got a different View why do we have so many facets of the message that we know of right here we got all these different facets of because of man's idea the prophet brought one message and God brought one message through his prophet and that one message the Liberty wherein Christ through the message has made us free because he is the message he is the word that is our freedom it's not our bondage notice now they want to claim that you got to listen to them if you plan on making a rapture how many of you listen to somebody besides brother Tim well maybe a handful of you you may make it but if you don't listen to anybody but brother Tim we're all going to hell because they claimed you got to listen to my sermons or you're not going to make a rapture you got me and today that are inviting brother Brandon to take to service I mean we're going to turn the service over now to brother Branham come on Church we've got into Catholicism spirituality spiritualism we're going to set handkerchiefs in front of the tape recorder and play a certain portion of the tape when brother Branham prays over the handkerchiefs and say it now come get your handkerchief that brother Brandon prayed for did you get your hanky come on church that's bondage that's not Freedom that's not Liberty that's man holding something over another group of men oh it's deception that's not what God ordained it's a yoke of bondage but God sent us a message through a Vindicated Prophet to liberates us to liberate us to free us so we find now intellectual understanding will never deliver the people we're not looking for reformation we're not looking to have special classes how to teach our young boys how to live above sin overcome pornography we don't need classes no no no no what we need to do is get back to preaching the gospel get back to preaching the baptism of fire preaching the Holy Ghost preaching born born into born by the spirit and dead to yourself and dead to your own ideas dead to your own Passions that's what we need we need to get away from all this psychology because when you bring psychology into it church it's bondage psychology ain't gonna deliver the people when you deprive the church from a genuine Pentecostal experience that's bondage when you deny the people access to prayer lines that's bondage when you deny young people an altar call that's bondage when you say you gotta you know when the preachers you know you got sometimes in some Churches you got message preachers they can get all excited they can run and Shout kind of like what I'm doing up here but they put the restrictions on you you can't do that because you know what I'm confident in the spirit that I know that's anointing me but I'm not sure what's anointing you therefore we don't have any emotionalism in the church that's bondage that's nicolaitism that's bondage hold control over the people but what a God of God sent us a message of Liberty so that man has no control over you and you say well you find out what they're doing today and I know this is maybe going to turn real quick and I'm going to try to hurry up because I we're getting close to time but you find that you know we get a little bit emotional I'm sorry I'm a lot emotional I just you know hey if you've been where I've been you'd act the way I act but you find today that they want to they want to entangle the people now that you said you can't have any emotion in church I don't know what in the world I would how I would preach if the church was dead thank God some of you are alive tonight think about it they want to make you feel condemned for shouting they want to make you condemned for enjoying your Liberty and we find here that in Exodus 28 and verse 33 Lauren if you'd put that up there notice beneath upon the hymn of it thou shall make pomegranates of blue and a purple and of scarlet round about the hymn thereof bells of gold between them round about a golden Bell and a pomegranate Exodus 28 verse 34 now let me slow down Exodus 28 verse 34. a golden Bell and a pomegranate a golden belt and a pomegranate upon the Hem of the robe about verse 35 and thou shall be upon Aaron to minister and this or his sound shall be heard when he goeth into the holy place before the Lord and when he cometh out that he died not notice what the prophet of God says about this in an earnestly contended for the faith that was once delivered because I know you think we're an awful noisy bunch and some of you probably thinking that right here tonight man you're an awful nosy preacher well you're all over the place he said but I can prove to you that if there ain't no noisy then there ain't no God there if there ain't no noisy then there ain't no God there listen in the Old Testament when Aaron Anointed with the rose of Sharon when he had the anointing oil that run down his beard to the hymns of a skirt he had taken a sacrifice he went into the holiest of holies and when he went behind that curtain across His Garment he had a pomegranate and a bell a pomegranate and a bear and they hid together and when he walked he played holy holy holy unto the Lord that's the anointed Church of God moving into the holy place and if your life ain't crying holy holy holy unto the Lord your dead Church your life has got to be making some noise you saying brother John means I got a shout I'm not saying you got a shot I'm saying your life has got to shout I'm saying your experiences got a shout it's got to be crying out that there's something on the inside I'm not some dead somebody but I've been made alive through the blood of Jesus in my life whether I'm on the Mountaintop is crying holy holy unto the Lord if I'm in the Valley of Despair my life is still crying holy holy into the Lord if I had to put a brand new transmission in my wife's Yukon I'm still crying holy holy holy unto the Lord if I got to go three days without any AC my life oh Hallelujah is crying holy holy unto the Lord why because there's a life on the inside I thought some dead person or not some Dead reper face somebody we are children of God we've been made alive through the blood and if there ain't no noisy there ain't no God there that's not my interpretation that's your prophet so if you don't like it take it up with him you say he's Vindicated bam take it swallow it digest it meditate on it dwell on it let that same life that inspired that quote come inside of you all of a sudden you've run you'll realize there's a pomegranate whoa there's a bell oh Hallelujah that dinging man your feet get a little bit loose make a little noise hands get free for the surface is over your hands are clapping some of you ain't trapped in a long time them hands start clapping some of your feet ain't moving a long time hey let me tell you you ain't got spiritual God get up and start moving them feet enjoy what God has done for you you're liberated Your Life is Crying holy holy unto the Lord he said look at here brother the reason they did that was the only way they could tell that he was alive they listen to hear if there's any noise they listen they came man hair is about to go in he's going to offer a sacrifice they only had to go one time a year they tied a rope to him and he when he walked in there was noise but he walked in bearing your burden bearing your sacrifice go before your God go before the holy of holies oh my and if he wasn't accepted and that man died they would take that rope and they'd drag him out of there and you still had to pack those same Burns that he went in with because you wasn't free oh but if there was noise on the inside and there was some music being made in the presence of the holy of a holist and his life was crying out and when he made that offering when he sacrificed in it he put that lamb on that offering for you and for me and from our sins and that life came back and cried holy holy unto the Lord he didn't have to be drug out he walked out what am I telling you tonight you ain't got to be drunk out of this church you can walk out different you can walk out free God has made you to be free notice if there was no noise and he was dead and that's he said that's what's today the church that's born again going into the wholeness of holies Anointed with God's pomegranate in the mail Hallelujah yes sir you know they're alive well I hope you're listening tonight to hear some noise hope you came with that purpose to hear some noise I'm not talking about just me up here shouting and screaming and certain ones responding to the word I'm talking about the spirit of God speaking to you and you know that he's alive and he's personal and he's dealing intimately with you see if your life isn't sounding forth holy holy holy unto the Lord You're Dead because I let everything that has breath praise ye the Lord you say well bro Joe I can't say Amen well maybe you need to get a pomegranate and a belt tied around your ankles change the position come in with a different mindset come in with an expectation that I'm not going to let the noise bother me you remember I told y'all when I first came to church here man y'all was a bunch of nosy racket Russ I come out of the Baptist Church I'm like you know what we used to we're used to doing this we didn't Clap Hands you didn't definitely didn't say amen and shout and scream and all that stuff that was nonsense you didn't do that in the First Baptist Church no sir not in Greenville Mississippi no I came over here first time all this people bopping up and down I'm like what in the world have I gotten myself into I can't hear the preacher everybody's shouting everybody's screaming hands are going up I can't see what he looks like everything's in the way but all of a sudden I find myself you know I kept coming some drugged me back wow there was a seed on the inside what am I telling you I was once I was critical of all that record I was critical of all that noise oh but let me tell you when I changed shoes one time and I tied up pomegranate and a bell and got the Holy Ghost one time let me tell you brother it changed the situation it changed my mentality it changed the way I walked it changed the way I talked it changed the way I danced it changed the way I come to church I come from a mic with an expectation to hear some noise to hear somebody you know the anointing of the Holy Ghost and begin to shout hallelujah I was once burned but now I see I was once bound but now I'm free oh Hallelujah oh my God I could preach I should have saved this for Sunday oh but we fine notice what he says now oh he goes I can tell him he goes I tell you the only way you know that there's any life in the church when a little noise gets started somewhere Oh Sister scream out don't laugh man when I hear that yeah Faith muscles begin to come up oh cause what I know he's here I know whatsoever things that we asked in that time in that presence when that anointing drops down we can have whatsoever we ask for because why it's no longer the man but it's almighty God the pillar of fire dropping down into a church service and the noise begin to ring out people get to respond not to the man not to the voice not to the vessel but they responded to the spirit of God he said well the Bible says got to a place when you go to churches it's either so cold and formal and dry to the spiritual thermometer will hit 50 Below Zero May that never be tacked on even like Tabernacle the people just notice what he says now people just they just set like a ward on a pickle just as sour and in different and puckered up that's the best pucker and I can do for you Faith just sit sour puckered up you know what you don't want to preach to that kind of person you know what I do my best to look away I I I'm just being honest it's hard to preach to some puckered up bump on a pickle man a man done study gave up his time prayed to God will lead him and guide them and speak to him and minister to heart's life and you got somebody out there just I'll Puck it up and half asleep no we got to come with an expectation to hear hear the noise because everywhere that Jesus went it was noisy let me tell you may have come to a from a church and it ain't got no noise but let me tell you you didn't come to this church and expecting any no noise here because we're noisy bunch of people because why we end up being shook by the power of the Holy Ghost we have met the almighty God we have been set free the same angel that came down on the day of Pentecost is the same one that's here today and he's breaking bars and he's losing their teeth and he said captivity Captain that's my God that's my this word that's who we are we have been called to a place of freedom you don't have to like it but you gotta love it there's a difference here you know I like cheesecake I think y'all know that any kind I can get let's go ahead and put that out there on notice man I've done some heavy preaching that's all bro I got y'all stay tuned in part two in a minute I don't know where I was at I was my train of thought cheesecake oh hi in the world could I lose that you know there's turtle cheesecake there's New York cheesecake there's strawberry cheesecake blueberry cheesecake there's the fluffy kind of Cheesecake you know there's all kind there's cook there's all kinds of Cheesecake I'm a cheesecake connoisseur you know what you may not like cheesecake but if they put it in front of us you ain't gotta eat it I'll eat your portion and I like what brother Brown said I like cherry pie my brother humpy he likes apple pie let me tell you we look we ain't gotta agree together and I gotta eat what he likes but as long as we're eating pie that's all that matters and if you get to the seeds spit the seed out what am I telling you Church we're in the house of God we've been freed by the blood of Jesus we've been covered with the anointing of authenticatedness you may not like what's being preached but you just gotta spit it out anyway and say God give it to me I want what you have for me I don't want to sit here all dead and crusty and it's different and cold and formal and drop nor let me feel the squares of the spirit moving through me Lord let me fill your spirit one more time I don't want to be indifferent I want to be on fire for the things of God let me hurry this up and I know here we go I'm going to end it right here no I'm not I lied to you in the pulpit you say all right brother Joe I don't want to get in the flesh how many you ever said that oh don't show your hand all right I'm coming to the house acting like that I don't want to get in the flesh but you know what you got up this morning in the flesh some of you first thing you did was took that flesh to the sink and brushed those nasty teeth in the flesh then you were fortunate and thankful we thank you that you put clothes on that flesh then you went to the kitchen table and you put food in that flesh you know about five o'clock six o'clock you decided to put that same flesh that you don't brush his teeth put clothes on and fed it you didn't put that flesh inside your vehicle and you drove that flesh to the house of God you went through all that trouble all In the Flesh now you tell me you want to quit when you get to the house of God because you don't want to get enough light Now's the Time to Get In the Flesh and give the Holy Spirit something to anoint no I'm here I may act like a fool I may act like a drunk man a man like I'm only but I'm gonna put everything I got behind the service behind the spirit behind the preach another gospel I'm gonna give God something to anoint give him something to anoint but I said I've seen jumping spells Joy spells but nobody was hurt and we come to church and we don't want to we don't want to enjoy nothing we don't want to enjoy our Liberty somebody jump up you want to criticize because they got a little bit of wildfire you can't get worn by a painted fire but you know what you can get some heat from a wildfire maybe that Wildfire comes dancing by you and you least expect it and all of a sudden that same Wildfire jumps off on you your cold critical self and all of a sudden you out there in the middle of the aisle now like brother man I'm dancing in the spirit turn my house into it or my my church into a Tavern critical but he said what if they're right and I'm wrong I replay that all the time what if they're right and I'm wrong oh church let us not be let's not be held responsible for for quenching the spirit and I'm not saying we all got to act like a bunch of hooligans I'm not saying that at all I'm saying there's a freedom to worship because he that the sun is made free is free indeed no bars no chains notice he says I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people that they were free from the world the things of the world and the joy of the Lord filled the congregation they stood and they screamed and they cried and they shouted to the top of their voice just so you know this is 19th and 64. after the opening of the seals the prophet of God still preached and he still believed in emotional religion notice they shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of God I never did see anything disorderly they was always right in order because they had recognized that their name had been written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the great prophet Shepherd had brought them the messes and they were delivered no matter what the other ecclesiastical realm said about it they knew what had happened just as them Shepherds did back there and they knowed what took place and those that shout those that jumped those that screamed those that cry those that allow the spirit of God to move upon them you know what took place all Church let me bring this down musicians go ahead and make your way back my brother said I was preaching there was a woman crying she was holding up her hands and crying and praising God and the Holy Spirit was there the woman was filled with the Holy Ghost how can a magnet draw anything unless it's magnetized to it correct he goes there was a man who belonged to another church he was a friend of mine standing there outside he said Billy I was enjoying your sermon until that woman raised up and started crying said how in the world could you preach and her acting like that listen to his response I said that's the only time I can preach oh church and that's the only time that I can't preach I want to see you shouting oh why why you want to see me shout because I know that the inside of that life is overcoming power and I know that the house that all hails against you but when you shout what are you telling hell to give way you can't hold me I'm walking out notice he says now he says that's the only time I can preach and when I see the power of God has caught away the church call the way the message he said it just made Shivers run over my back I said if you ever if you'd ever be fortunate to get to heaven you would freeze to death huh because they're crying and shouting and praising God day and night Angels flying back and forth crying holy holy holy unto the Lord and let me tell you right now brother he says you're living in the cry quietest World you'll ever live in if you go to hell there's weeping and wailing and National teeth if you go to heaven there's hallelujahs and Praises of God day and night all the times all in eternity this is the quietest place that you will ever live so if you plan on being in heaven I got any Heaven takers tonight and you better practice getting noisy you better practice your Praises you better start practicing your hallelujahs you better start practicing some praise our God because that's what's going to be heard over there it ain't gonna be your belly grubs and your ups and downs and your disappointments in life and everybody's against you and Wows and Wows and not in heaven oh say if we come to the house of God tonight we might as well start here we might as well start tonight we might as well start expecting Lord you said if there ain't no noise there there ain't no God there I'm not trying to work the people up but God I know where you are if sends a response to the people their hearts begin to be churned and that begins to be an electricity pulling them up into an atmosphere and only you can create father and we're here tonight Lord to let you know and declare to this evil generation and we're declared to the house of hell we're not going back to bondage we're staying free we've been liberated by the hands of God we've been liberated by the blood of Jesus we are free people and we're standing tonight in that Liberty we're standing as young people in our Liberty we're extending as mothers in our Liberty we're extended as fathers and Leaders with our Liberty we're not going back to hell we're not going back to bonus we're not going back to cold formal religion we are here to serve a living God oh Church let me bring this home program says now if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter God we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God bring them back if he's Afflicted you made you sick we have a right before God to enforce the laws of God by his rights we are healed bring him back turn him loose you're taking them out yonder of death we claim him bring him back now that's the enforcement restore back to the Natural condition a man sick a baby sick a woman sixty they're out there now out of their natural condition but they have a right to enforce the claim not our claim it's our claim because God has given to us by his rights we are healed let me tell you and the prophet of God said on the day of Pentecost what the church received was her inalienable rights that means that rights that can't be Stripped Away rights are not going to be transferred right so we're not giving up I'm telling you if I was away she received then it's the same race that we got today we got the right to worship we got the right to praise God we got the right for our healing we got the right for our sons and daughters the prodigals to come over we got it right God is looking for somebody to enforce the claim it's your inalienable rights we're not giving them up safe you can't have them you can't take them we have a right to the full word we got a right to speaking in tongues we got a right to prayer line we got a right to our Ultra costs we got a right to lay hands on a seat we got a right to cast out Devils we have a right today Church and let me just tell you it ain't all on the preachers you got it right force a claim on Satan give it back all Church [Music] at our camp I'm coming to a close Saturday night after the prayer line one o'clock in the morning some of those minutes was in the back brother Donnie come under the anointing and speaking to speak in tongues and prophesy and he spoke to brother Ron first he says now I've not forgotten you stand in the Pullman and preach you are my son I've seen you in your suffering you will come to the fullness of your healing then he goes back into tongues again and he comes back out and he interprets into the other brothers I have noticed I have waited for this time for so long to show you my Majesty God has been waiting to reveal himself in a people to show his majesty preach the gospel I will be with you
