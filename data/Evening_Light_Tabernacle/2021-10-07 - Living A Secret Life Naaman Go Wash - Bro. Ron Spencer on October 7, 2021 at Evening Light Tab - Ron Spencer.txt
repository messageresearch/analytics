years ago where are we at now amen we should be right into the very presence where things are happening he said we see it but we want to see more of it we want it in such a flow it'll be a help to us and us flow out to others amen so may god stir up that faith in our hearts tonight now in order for there to be healing delivered salvation it's got to be preached amen faith comes by hearing the word of god so we are here tonight to hear god's word let it produce a faith in our hearts but then release that faith and see that faith go to work on the behalf of god's children amen it's the hour and the time for the dynamics to come to the mechanics when brother branham left us he left us a car that would run down the road to healing to delivers to salvation to miracles everything we needed well we've had a few quacks that's wanna you know mess with the mechanics a little bit and adjust this and adjust that and you know until finally got too many cars that won't run but i want you to know the message god sent us amen you just pull it down into gear it was left running the prophet didn't turn it off we ain't got to crank it up just pull it down into gear and go right down to whatever needs

through the apostle paul he paul admonished husbands said show your wife do benevolence show her the love that is due her and that means that he has given responsibility for the care for the for the building up for the helping of the hurts for the comfort to love his wife now god couldn't tell us to the apostle paul men love your wives show them do benevolence and then god not do the same for you

i ask you that you had anoint the gift in our lives to speak the word of life we heard it last night and lord it it's like a ballistic missile that knows exactly where to find its target now lord jesus you've sent us on a mission tonight and i ask you that you would just allow myself to get out of the way that you would give us a temporary resurrection to speak through our hearts bless brother tim and and all the ministry team here lord come and minister to them [Music] touch his body even now lord strengthen him father and we just thank you for it in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen god bless you you will turn with me in your scriptures to luke chapter 4 and verse 23 this evening i'd like to speak to you this afternoon on living a secret life living a secret life sometimes we sermons come on our hearts and they're there for weeks and we think that we'd like to go a different direction but we have a boss that knows exactly what the need of in this building is and though this be simple i believe he'll get right to our point this afternoon luke chapter 4 and verse 23 and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself and whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country but i tell you of a truth that many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land but un but un unto none of them was elias sent save the serapha a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in israel in the time of elias the prophet and none of them was clean cleansed saved naaman the syrian second kings chapter 5 and verse 1. now naaman the captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man and with his master and honorable because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria incredible words right there even also a mighty man in valor but he was a leper you may be seated we're struggling and even hearing today of people that are passing from covid it's a fearful thing it's a terrifying thing when it comes into your home not too bad when it was in china but now it's here it always it's always personal when it gets to your house it's a very dreadful thing but it's literally nothing compared to leprosy leprosy was one of the most dreaded diseases that there was in the land leprosy was a disease to which it was a flesh-eating disease bones would deteriorate literally limbs would fall off rot stink and it would pass from one to another to to have leprosy would send you in exile to a to even a different island or a different country it would definitely separate you from your family and you would have to openly scream unclean unclean and it was a very difficult disease nobody had an answer for it many in the land had leprosy so it would be a horrible thing when it visited your home and become a part of your family it would it would cause many many great separations we find a man here that we begin to speak about even jesus talks of him this man was an incredibly great man he was a man that was used by god to fulfill actual prophecy to which the which they would go and and deliver syria this man was a not a foot soldier but he was the captain of the host he would be one of the highest officers in any king's castle or any inner circle he would be one of the men that would set at the most important tables he would be there to where that they would converse back and forward of the safety of the nation of of putting military men in certain spots he would be a man of great importance incredible importance but even in the mind of god this would be a man that god would use to fulfill elijah's prophecy even of ahab being perish so this man would would have great importance in the mind of god it would be unfathomable for a man in this position to tell his friends i have leprosy he will live a very secret life leprosy writes his own flesh i'm fine with this anyway yeah okay always enjoyed lollipops when i was a little boy if i get to the center of this one tonight we've done something [Applause] were we at this man had to keep this a secret leprosy is much like sin you didn't think i was gonna stay four or five thousand years ago did you leprosy's much like a sin it will cause you to live a secret life even in the message without the seal of the holy ghost on your life you're a target of the devil to bring in habits and situations in the home things on your phone things on your ipad things on your computer little habits that consume you and an enemy that comes along with it that is always there and maybe even allow you to go to church but he always reminds you now you know in the public eye naaman would wear his armor and he would look the part no doubt on the under that armor he would wrap himself with such a wrap until the smell wouldn't get out and he would wrap himself to where that the ooze wouldn't come out can you imagine how uncomfortable it was that he would wear such an attire and live such a and he knew but he couldn't let his even closest friends know i want you to follow his closest friends could not know or he would be exiled thinking i'll lose it all i'll lose it all if anybody else knows i lose my standing i lose my position he enjoyed where he was at speaking with king speaking with generals speaking with great and listen when he walked down the street he was a celebrity he would what we would call a national hero but he had a secret champion of champions but he had a secret day after day he would go home you know and then and his home the secret was known and he would take his armor off lay his armor down and he would begin to unwrap today with new oozes and knew breaking out cleaning up the stink his family would know but they dare because they didn't want to lose their standing either did not dare tell the secret that was consumed in this home and they would watch him and how he would suffer but yet everybody was propping up everybody was propping up the law hmm now remember he couldn't tell it was a secret but at home he could relax and at home he was in his atmosphere when he was at battle and he and he went into israel they would they would gather treasures to bring home an interesting thing was that he brought a girl a young woman to help his wife in the home and he brought her there and he brought her to his home to be a slave brother branham reminds us that though we are aliens from another country we are to conduct ourself in a certain way [Applause] now now let me just let me just let this be a real basis tonight let me just say this to you naaman was not the most powerful person in the home naaman though he be a the captain of the host a general of generals a national hero sitting at the most inner circle of all of the camp of the highest order of all the land in his own home he wasn't the most powerful person there it wasn't his wife it was that slave girl because she believed a message and that message was a message of deliverance it was a message that had power to it it was a message that there's a power of a god in our land we have a prophet and though she be not in her own home not with her own family not with her own friends though she be a slave she conducted herself as a believer regardless of her conditions you may be under all kind of circumstances in your life and think that your world is completely upside down and there's nobody with you to support you god's always with you god's always got your pots now this girl would watch naaman naaman was the individual that took her captive naaman was the one that had brought her to this place no doubt this house was a much nicer house than she lived in but it wasn't home no doubt he treated her good but it wasn't her family no doubt there were many friends and other workers that were in the home but they wasn't her friends but this little girl operating in this room she had power to get him delivered but would she sometimes we become slaves to different things and things come into our lives will we allow it to cause dominion over our home over our life will we allow it to take us out of church will we allow it to separate us from fellowship with god or will we operate in our god-given rights [Applause] regardless of the conditions she must have power to forgive him she must have power to forgive him for taking her captive she must realize that it is her purpose in life to get that man that has fulfilled the prophecy of the word of god to get that man deliverance [Applause] willy believer will he trust her now let's just think about it just for a little bit first of all naaman's got to come to a spot in his life to where he would do anything to get rid of this send a lay in your life and become your slave master and it'll lay there in war with you until you get sick and tired of being enslaved come on church let me just say this to you i struggle and i war with cancer but it does not have dominion over me i do not worship the disease that is fighting for my life you do not have to worship the disease that is trying to destroy you because god is greater than every disease that there is maybe little habits that creep into your life and you think nobody knows situations tempa maybe the dna pool pulled a lot of things down in your life and there's jealousies in your family and in your home listen they stink [Applause] you go to church with people and you don't want them to know but your family knows little habits that you have in your life you know your family knows you would love to be rid of those things [Applause] and you got an enemy in your ear constantly you know sometimes sin has to the point to little convince a man he's it's doing right and he he finds himself in one situation after another situation and then he finds that i can't go back or what if people find me out i lose my standing i'll lose my situation i'm preaching to you [Applause] i'll be exiled from the church i'll be gone they put me off on an island but don't realize if they could really get to the altar where god wants them to get they could get cleansed of that thing and it won't be their enemy no more but it'll be a reminder of a war that they pass fault and it's over with how many warriors that we have sitting throughout the building tonight and you have fought through different things in your life the power of forgiveness to forgive yourself [Applause] the power over condemnation doubt promises i'll never go back to that pornographic site again promises no doubt to never take a sip of that again not let lust rule in my life temper you just go ahead and put whatever there you let the discerning of the word just come to where you're at now let me just say this to you in a sermon like this this is not to down you this is lift you up don't let the devil whisper in your ear now that preacher's after you i'm here to help you i'm here to bring you deliverance you don't have to stay there i'm like a little girl we've got a prophet in the land we got an angel that's among us we've got a perfect message that'll come to deliver you no doubt there was a many a day even at war in that hot suit only dreaming that i could get rid of this dreaming haunted at night itching oozing stinking rotting checking am i sealed up good enough to go out in public sitting in a room and many others around him and checking himself to make sure that nobody else smells the stink am i coming home no doubt he cried tears he had fulfilled prophecies is there any deliverance for me no doubt there was times that he thought well you know i'll just give it up i'm gonna i gotta go to the doctor to get some help but if that doctor would tell i could find some medicine that would help me i'd give it all this little girl overcome her bitterness she overcome her captivities and she realized who she was that's who you are she realized who she was she decided now today i know he could kill me but i got to talk to him i got to have a conversation with him somewhere in that conversation i've got to convey that i don't hate him but i love him maybe brother branham would do that standing in the prayer line put his foot up the side of a man or measure to see if his suit would fit their suit and was trying to find compassion for them and no doubt there was many things that he told people that didn't make them happy but it brought them deliverance [Applause] when nathan talked to david it wasn't a judgment of law but it was grace to him let me just say this message is grace to us it set us free it's not law to us it's love to to jesus christ it's more than brother branham it's more than your favorite preacher it's god himself that is here in the room to bring you personal deliverance [Applause] this this little girl begins to speak to him now naaman yes name and i i know you've got leprosy but name i know where there's some help for you i know where there's some help for you i i know you you don't have no help here but where i come from there's a prophet over there jesus even reminds us no other leper had ever been healed but this little girl's revelation was beyond the impossible it had never happened before but her testimony was if you can get to the prophet i want to say this to you if you can get to jesus if you can make your way to where jesus is at he'll heal you he'll deliver you maybe she was even afraid to look in his eyes if you could get to him no he first of all had to catch the revelation for himself i gotta go now let me just say they were enemies those two nations were so naaman does what a lot of people do i'm going to work it out for myself to where i can get to it because i work i walk in certain circles i'm going to use my circle so it won't look so bad now i want you to understand now he's got to convince a king don't throw me away i have leprosy it's an incredible deliverance for you when you admit [Applause] because who he was allowed him enough grace will you send a letter to the king of israel that i want to come see the prophet that i would get deliverance the king of israel becomes wrath he looks at it as a fight this is a man that has come and destroyed our kingdom he don't look at him as a man that has become a national hero and fulfill the prophecy he looks at this man as he is going to insurrect a fight he's going to bring leprosy to my kingdom because under the influence of a lot of powerful people they bring sin into your life [Applause] because sin is kind of transferable you just entertain a spirit a little while and before long you got it [Applause] you just entertained the wrong thing in your home a little while and before long something else is ruling your home the king has to make a decision and i'm going to let this man come and bring leprosy to my kingdom you can imagine his situation you can imagine the difficulty of what it would be like to have to make a decision come on the prophet hears about it he sends word let him come on let him come on well naaman being who he is and as powerful he is as rich as he is thinks he can buy it god don't need your money [Applause] it doesn't bother about what your last name is naaman loads up all of the animals and they begin to make a journey you know no doubt he had great expectations when he got to the prophet's house he was used to lining and dining with some of the greatest he was used to being the red carpet treatment but getting a new birth is you got to be ready to go to a pigpen you got to be willing to die out to yourself you got to be willing to die out to everything and lay it down and say tonight i'll never go back ever again naaman comes to this position he and all of his servants that were with him his men that were carrying his arm and all of these things you can imagine the parade that comes to the prophet's house and the prophet didn't even go out to see [Applause] i can imagine i can imagine like a lot of people well the pastor didn't even call me back he didn't even cannot shake my hand he didn't even give me a great dinner here he sent his servant out he just sent one of the boys out to give me a message don't he know who i am don't he know who my last name is let me just say naaman was still stinking as bad as it ever stunk and being who he was did not impress the prophet of god none whatsoever being a captain didn't impress elijah being set in a greater inner circle did not impress us but he had prayed [Applause] he had got ready and he had an answer this message has the answer that you need you don't have to go to 42 different preachers to try to figure out what you need in your life well i didn't get the answer i'm looking for here so i'm going there i'm going there i'm going to listen moving will never change your problem you've got to die out to yourself you gotta die you gotta die to your problem it'll only get worse if you just keep it up but so many times we want our way and her own stubborn will david had the same problem with his brothers david was going to be the king but his brothers were taller handsome better warriors they made fun of him they intimidated him but i don't read anywhere where any of those went and fought goliath [Applause] so they had a family secret they was jealous of one another [Applause] come on church so many times we can't recognize the pastor because he's our younger brother we can't recognize so and so in their great gift cause we're older we've got more ability but god's using them you see you got a family secret and what you need to do is go to the prophet's word and get washed [Applause] and the servant came out and told him said go to jordan and go dip in jordan seven times jordan was muddy jordan was nasty jordan stock and being he was a warrior and knew the country well he picked two different bodies of water that would suit him better that'd be wonderful instructions but i'll go dip here i'll go to that church [Applause] i'll go to that place that preacher ain't hard that preacher let me get by but if you go there you'll still stink if you go where you want to go you'll still be rotten if you choose your own religion you will still stink and have to go into exile but if you go to the word where the word tells you to go you see to get a miracle you got a wash so many times we want deep mysteries when we really haven't got a bath we want to understand all the deep seals we want to understand all the great things that put it together but really we don't have a birth and when we get crossed up all the sudden under pressure we expose our leprosy and so many times we bypass the new birth kind of like satan making an offer to jesus i'll give you the kingdom of the world i'll give you everyone and jesus says this is written it is written it is written many times we know the truth but we want to work our own will listen it's in everybody's dna to want an easier way brother branham didn't mind being a prophet if he could be a trapper because he loved the woods and he loved hunting he hated the pressure he actually even made up in his mind i'm going to go up into canada i'm going to maybe buy a little store i'm going to i'm going to be a guide up there and when god speaks to me i'll come down and i'll preach that saith the lord he wrestled with his own human will don't tell me you don't wrestle with your own human will [Applause] i wrestle because of this sermon's got to be delivered but i learned a long time ago are you with me now that the one that is keeping the cancer away he's after you [Applause] and listen he's got the prescription to take care of you [Applause] our world is battling over inoculations some force some against will it work won't it work is there going to be side effects don't get cold now we're wrestling with it it's i want the best shot i want this i i i want that i don't want this i i i got to have this wow i get the right spot there didn't i it's the same thing with the word it has an inoculation that goes with it and we've got 40 some thousand denominations that think they got the right shot but i want to tell you i'm a from a citizen of another kingdom and god sent us a prophet it's not even negotiable it don't matter to me that you don't want it now let me tell you how it worked on me i didn't get a fever the next morning i didn't get the shakes i didn't get hives i didn't get a headache but i was an addict the night before oh you thought i was talking about coping but i was an addict the night before but when i got the inoculation you see i walked into church like maybe some of you walked into church tonight and i was stinking i was i was under a suit but i was stinking i was afraid because i was a preacher's son i was afraid that others would smell me but i hadn't been in church in a long time but it didn't matter that my name was spencer i had leprosy [Applause] naaman looked at his soldiers and he said can you believe this i've got the king convinced that i can come to the prophet and i finally got here and he tells me to go to jordan how can i being who i am go to jordan the scriptures bears out that those men had more revelation than naaman did the man gave you an inoculation and told you you could be well why don't you just do what he said well brother but brother ron i'm afraid i'll slobber and i'm afraid i'll cry listen maybe your children will watch you daddy and mama walk to an altar and finally get rid of your leprosy then that leprosy won't rule your home no more i pray in this meeting tonight that there'll be a refilling of the holy ghost in people's lives where they be recharged by the dynamics of the holy ghost should not be ashamed of the new birth [Applause] we should not be ashamed to worship [Applause] we should not be ashamed of the prophet of this hour we should not be ashamed of the fivefold ministry that god has sent us in this day to cleanse the church to wash you and keep you clean [Applause] whether you know it or not god has anointed the greatest ministry in the world to come and preach to you not what you want to hear but what you need to hear forgive me anybody can push play when they know what's on that tape won't bother what's in here sometimes the longest walk you will ever make is not on a treadmill it's to an altar [Applause] listen it don't matter how long you've been in church you need to be [Applause] washed we're not careful i don't want to offend nobody here because i'm getting in this group sometimes in nursing homes they have to beg the patients to take a bath i knew you'd get quiet and i've had too many in the church that told me he said brother ron i just took a bath last week i haven't done anything but i feel like that sometimes in church just come take a bath just come take a bath it'll make you feel better [Applause] [Music] it'll clean your hair up gotta give you a perfume to make you smell better he'll sweeten your spirit to where you can get along at home care won't be hard to do but you need to get a bath [Applause] donnie they may give you another service i imagine as he stood there looking at jordan well this is what he said this is what he said it'll take care of my music it's going to take care of my movies it's going to take care of all that nonsense in my life if i could see myself on the other end of this miracle i'm going to have skin like a baby but on the way in he could smell itself he walks down in that muddy stinking water and he remembers those little girls words you can be healed and it's been a long journey to get here but i'm here i don't know how many miles you took you to get here but you're here you may as well dip i don't know who i'm preaching to but i'm i'm well aware that i'm preaching to somebody here tonight don't go home the same way don't go home the same way don't don't go home stinking don't go home terrified somebody else is going to find you out go home a complete different person see those spots on my arms see the spots on my arms it's where cancer is eating the pigments out of my skin and doctors say i'm going to turn white like michael jackson turned white but what you doing i got you i got y'all rich of mine right there but what they don't realize is the cancer is going to leave it's on its way out i've never showed an audience that but let me just say this to you tonight won't you look at your arms why don't you look at your life and say tonight's the night for me to go wash and as you're dipping watch it loose just keep watching just be dipping just be mipping just keep dipping brother ron but i've tried it before dip again i went home and failed dick again just keep dipping [Music] [Applause] and one day the inoculation will take a hope in your life and you'll never go back ever again in your life her head's about just a moment maybe you're living a secret life and you know that you know that you know it doesn't matter to me who's standing beside of you what your family name is you need you know you need to wash because what's going on in you stinks nobody looking around with your hand be up yes ma'am you're handing me up thank you your hands up thank you
