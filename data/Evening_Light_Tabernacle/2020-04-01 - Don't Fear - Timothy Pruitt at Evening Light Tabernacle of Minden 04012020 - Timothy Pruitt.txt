can return back together and order worship you and to give you glory and give you praise that you deserve father for true that we love you Lord and we thank you for all that you've done all that you're doing Lord we just we just praise you thank you in Jesus name we ask these things hey man let's turn to John chapter 14 hey man John chapter 14 and verse 1 I'm gonna be going through quite a bit of Scripture so you don't have to keep up with me tonight John chapter 14 and verse 1 it says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also oh what a wonderful time that'll be and whether I go you know and the way you know also on down to verse 25 he says these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father was sinned in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I'll leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you but let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid Amen we can let you be seated and I just like to speak on this on don't fear don't fear I was looking at these words of trouble and afraid to in this scripture reading in this trouble means to agitate or to cause an inward commotion to take away the calmness of mind or to disturb your equanimity to disquiet to make Restless to stir up to trouble to strike one spirit with fear and dread to render one anxious or distressed to perplex the mind of one by suggesting scruples or doubt and also afraid to be not afraid he says also to be timid or fearful now we know fear at one time it was a time that fear did not exist it was a time that the word fear did not exist it was not in the vocabulary manner and the thoughts of man and I believe we're going back to a time where that fear once again won't exist but we're in a time that's in the world that whether it's a good time or having a good time or a bad time fear exists and certain things in certain realms and in certain degrees there's always been fear since the time has started now here on the earth and time has been kept here on the earth and there's very many different kind of fears there's there's very many different degrees of fear and but it's a spirit that comes in and tries to attach to a maybe a hurt or are some events or something that took place in a person's life and and a spirit tries to attach therein to cause them to be afraid and to be some something to be almost incapacitated by the fear or the incapable of even moving or incapable of operating in a normal way because of fear now there's many different recorded fears many different and we'll go through these very quickly because Muammar very humorous but they've been recorded and actually treated as a fear that people have have to have to cover having their lives and and it go there's there's fear of darkness there's fear of heights there's fear of flying there's fear of pain there's fear of open spaces there's fear of needles and pointed objects there's fear of riding in a car there's fear of men there's fear of choking there's fear of flowers there's my goodness there's fear of people or society there's fear of being touched there's fear of peanut butter there's fear of spiders there's fear of numbers there's fear of thunder and lightning there's fear of disorder and untied enos there's fear of imperfection there's fear of failure there's fear of human-like figures can you imagine that there's fear of being alone there's fear of bacteria there's fear of gravity there's fear of stairs or steep slopes there's fear of amphibians or fear of books there's fear of plants there's fear of ungodliness yeah there is fear of being ridiculous or ridicule there's fear of mirrors for your snow there's fear of colors there's fear of clocks there's fear of time there's fear of confined spaces there's fear of clowns there's fear of computers there's fear of dog let's just down those numbers that to see in the alphabetical order and on down to fear at home there's fear of cats there's fear of insects there's fear of teenagers there's fear of horses there's fear of marriage there's fear of knees there's there's fear of speaking in public there's fear of women I'm sure there's fear of men there's fear of touch there's fear son there's fear of blood so Satan has found all kind of ways to attach himself to whatever kind of fear that is out there what I mean there's and there's no doubt of fear of up you they a fear of organs a fear of P and a fear of all there's all kinds of fear and Satan is there to try to anoint those things and it calls you to become incapacitate or to a place of in mobile or on the abundant ability to think properly or to operate properly and so properly so he's always trying to attack with fear and and Brandon would speak of fear many times and he would he would go down through the things that he said the worst thing the worst thing that devil can put upon you is fear and and and I like I said we going down to will V and through Z there's fear beautiful women there's fear of germs there's fear of witches there's fear of strangers and there's fear of animals there's all kinds of fear that have been labeled or I've been treated there's actually one in here I don't know how somebody gets treated for this because it's a fear of doctors but anyway there's all kinds of fears but the worst thing the devil can put on you is fear and then it's time that we're living in and especially when we get along and we're in our a long time right now and our social distancing as they put it new words that we're learning in this age that we're living in he comes in those times and it really attacks our mind he he tries to suggest things and it seems like then in the time that we're living in sicknesses everywhere coronaviruses everywhere cancer is everywhere every kind of spirit that our darkness is everywhere but don't forget the promises of God are still the same don't forget that as healing is still here there's this there's still just as much healing if not more taking place now than there ever was a man just because all you here's the bad news don't mean there's not good news there is good news because God is still on the throne he's still moving in hearts of his men as well brothers and sisters of his children he's still moving in ways that seems unfathomable and unbelievable he's still Duero worker he's still annoyed maker it don't matter what he's what things are saying or what's going on around us he is still God and if he's still God he's got the answer for every one of these fears that they can list a man and so I believe tonight that no matter what takes place he is our refuge and when we come to him we can let off the pressure hey man where the round speaks about that and letting off the pressure you know we can quit worrying about it you know you can worry about well if I die what's gonna happen what what does it matter you're not living no more as far as here on the earth but Amen Satan wants you to get fearful about that or what happened to my wife or what happened to the husband or what happened to the children just come to Jesus Christ and let off the pressure a man I'm asking you tonight they just let off the pressure just let it all go for a moment forget about the newscast forget about what's going on around us for a moment and just remember Jesus Christ it's still here among us Amen didn't turn us down just a little bit up here he's still among us he he's still moving he's still healing he's still delivering amen we may not be a we may not be in here in the testimonies as we have been or or seeing it happen as we have been and it seems like on every side there's more bad news than there's ever been there's more things going on than there's ever been a minister just seems so much worse in our minds and Satan is trying to attach himself to thoughts to doubts to is it to bring you to a place where you can't find calmness you can't find a place amen but there is a place and that's Jesus Christ there is a place that you can stand on and that is his word amen you know no matter if somebody you know would give you money our million dollars it was still built up a pressure how am I going to hold this what am I going to do to this what a you know you could join a church and there's still be pressures am i right am I wrong this one says it's right that one says it's wrong everything's building up pressure but if you ever come to Jesus Christ you can let off the pressure because when you get there everything just settles down hallelujah it's God's provided place of safety what God said the name of the Lord is a strong tower amen and that towers not run out of River Street that towers not crumbling that towers not defeated it's still standing today as it was and the righteous can run into it and be saved in the time of sickness when the doctor says there is nothing I can do about it don't build pressure of let off the pressure he says call your pastor ask him to pray for you the prayer of faith shall save the sick let off the pressure he is our refuge hallelujah while you're in this he is our refuge why are you going through the storm he is a refuge what you're having sickness in your home he is a refuge he's still a healer and sickness don't build up pressure let off pressure because in sickness healing can come hallelujah amen let him come and move in your heart you say well I wonder but don't wonder about it just let off the pressure commit your case to God and go on as if it was all over with don't build off pressure well I'm so worried don't do that let off the pressure in the City of Refuge that could take a break they could let it all go they could forget about it here in this city of refuge he has taken your worry he has taken your cares because he cares for you hallelujah it's wonderful to be reminded in the time that we're living in we have a God who cares for us we have a blood that has been shed in that blood has not lost one ounce of power but it still can cure ever disease it still can game and move in ways and ways and we can't understand and don't know so don't worry about your cares that's his business hallelujah he's in the business of worrying for you he's taking your worries he's taking your stress he's taking it all any man you know Abraham what if he would have gotten this moment of distress and begin to worry and begin to fret how's this gonna be how's this all going to come to pass how how in the world am I gonna become what he said I was the father the father of Nations the father many Howard and in your on his mind begin to get all would be getting to get all stirred up until it once once you get in that place or in that position you lose confidence in what God said he meant don't ever lose confidence in what he said because he said if I were if it were not so I would have told you so he said right that I wouldn't lie I can't tell you no I cannot tell you nothing but the truth so I go don't let your heart be trouble I'm going to prepare a place for you if it were not so I would have told you a man he said now I've told you this in my while I'm here but there's coming another one there's coming a comforter the Holy Ghost and he's gonna lead you he's gonna guide you amen listen just because the coronaviruses here don't mean the Holy Spirit has lost his ability to guide us he's still guiding us he's still moving he's still in their homes he's still in the houses amen he's still moving on our behalf saying man he's still in our times of need and her time to struggle he hasn't lost his abilities hallelujah I don't care how dark it is he'll still make her way through it I don't care how impossible it seems he'll still make her way through it he will not leave us or loses he will take us all the way so Abraham had confidence so that's what the devil is trying to do in your moments in these moments of crisis he's trying to make you worry and then worry and he's trying to anoint that to where you lose confidence and what the Holy Spirit is doing and when we're not to lose confidence in this time we were to hold on him and just keep on holding on Abraham was ninety and nine years old and all the time he never wavered he believed God's Word he called those things that were not as though they were cuz God said so he believed that baby would come and he held onto the promise what a man I want to be that kind of man Abraham who against hope Sarah's wound was dead he was sterile his body was dead the Bible said it was and his body was as good as dead and Sarah's womb was dead she was now nearly 40 years past menopause amen but still abraham believed that she would have a baby because God said so hallelujah I don't care how long we go in this I don't care how long time goes home God said there's gonna be a rapture God said there's going to be a body change God said there's going to be a people who are alive and remain God said there's going to be an overcomer in this haze God said this it doesn't matter what goes on or how dead it seems or how impossible it see God said so and he wouldn't have said it if it wasn't so hallelujah and so we got to hold on to it no matter what the creeds cover it up word but the word laid there it still had to come to pass that word was laying right there and Abraham's heart no matter how many says the days of this was gone and the days of that is gone as long as the word is laying there it's creative it's a German ties word God is the word and the life of God is in the word notice that now when the word drops into the life of God something takes place it has to come to pass hallelujah and I want to tell the devil he's too late there's already a people here on this earth that the Word of God has dropped into their hearts it's too late amen something's going to take place and when he appeared to him in the name of Almighty God God has seven contact a compound redemptive names and we know that but he came in el shaddai el shaddai el shaddai in hebrew that el means a strong one as we've been speaking on the Lord is a man of war he's not a weak man of war he's a strong man of war I've seen him coming to many battles and I've never seen him lose I've seen him come against every kind of sickness I've seen him come against every kind of depression I've seen him come in the middle of a Haman just somebody who says we testified I mean me it testified to me and I didn't really even remember it at the moment but testify to me being in North Carolina and he came up for prayer had leukemia in God healed him hey man listen God still the healer God still the deliverer hey man is the strong one this Holy Ghost is a strong one he's stronger than any disease he's stronger than any problem you're facing he's stronger than any temptation he is a strong one and he'll shadow so - had means breast or like a woman's breast it's me that shadow singular should I squirrel amen what a sweet consolation - an old man a hundred years old holding the Word of God in his heart to hear the voice of God say I'm El Shaddai I'm the breast of God you just come to me and I will give you strength I will give you strength to fulfill the promise you can't do it Abraham but I got the power for you to do it you keep producing but I got the power that are producing come on little bride we can't produce a body changing our whole abilities we can't produce healing in all abilities but you come to the promise and you latch on to it that promise will produce what it said it would do hallelujah what did what does a mother do with her little child when he's sick and Fred him she picks him up and she brings him to her go to her bosom and he nurses the mothers strength right into his own body amen not only is he satisfied he's quite and maybe he was fearful maybe it was a fear that came over and where am I gonna get my next meal I'm tired I'm hungry they meant something beginning us disturb him and he's disturbed and he's tore up and he's worried but all of a sudden his hands from above reach them and they pick him up and they bring him close to him maybe it's just in these moments that God is trying to just bring you close to him get you all along for a moment to realize our strength does not depend on numbers our strength does not depend on the building our strength does not depend on only on a structure somewhere on the highway our strength is dependent upon this word of God that's where we draw our strength from a man maybe in this moment he can bring you into his arms and lift you out of your worries and your frettin and your fearing and your complex and then all the things that's going on and bring you to a moment he begins to nurse and his baby draw strength from his mother into his body he's rejuvenating himself oh my I don't know a man I don't believe that we're gonna be getting weaker from these things not if you've been attached to the right thing a man if you've been attached to the wrong things and been feeding on the wrong things you're gonna get weaker and you're gonna get weaker and you're gonna get weaker but if you've been feeding upon this word you're not gonna do nothing to get stronger stronger is Abraham day-by-day amen feeding upon El Shaddai I feast upon the promises of God his mind no doubt he had my own battles I'm not saying unite will have my own battles but what do you do you bring every thought captive to the Word of God you bring it right back to the words they know that ain't the word that's the thought somewhere else that's some other idea of got picked up somewhere else you bring it right back to the word and when you do that day by day you'll grow stronger and stronger and stronger hey man well I'm believing that when we come out of this thing if it's God's will we come out of this thing and it clears out or the rapture I don't realize provider actually prefer the rapture take place but if we go or if we come back to this side I'm not looking for a weaker Church I'm looking for a stronger church amen I pray that you've been seeing growing stronger Amen not your faith is not getting weaker if it's getting weaker you need to adjust your diet amen if you're finding yourself more tore up and more distressed more worried and more fretting you need to just let your feeding on and start feeding upon this word of God and let this be what you're guilty of being home hey man maybe some of your iPad's and your iPhone's or whatever phone devices that has been notifying you of your 9 and 10 hours a day need to be adjusted and have more hours a day and this word right here any man what an experience they meant to the seed of Abraham he's still almighty God he's still else Shia and we can take a hold of he promise that he made in the Bible and his seed seed his children if you're sick take a hold of the breasts of the promise of the word that says by His stripes I'm healed it satisfies you and you start drawing strength from it and you start taking one step one day two steps the next day amen until you go into a well party even let yourself onto the promises of God hallelujah it satisfies we're drawing constantly it's our strength from the strong one hallelujah L the strong one the eternal one drawing his life through the promise what a feeling it gives to a person laying upon the bosom of el-shaddai believing knowing that were nursing the power of Christ from his promise into us when El Shaddai I leaned and leaned Abraham on his bosom twenty-five years before the old man seventy-five years old his wife sixty-five but he never left it he walked right on through the strange land among strange people who knew not God but he constantly gave testimony and was strong in the faith giving praise to God because he knew who he was drawing from what a consolation for the believer to separate himself from all unbelief all ungodly Creed's all ungodly doctrines and look straight to Christ and take the word and hold on to that word until you see it manifested no matter how long you gotta wait stay there God promised it he led you to it hold on stay there don't take it back stay right there you're sure of it you're staying there you're not wavering you're not turning loose Amen you're gonna hold on until it happens hallelujah hell should I he said I'm ill should I abra ham I'm the strong one you're an old man you're on it years old your strength is leaving you but I am your strength your hope is leaving you but I am your hope your suffering tonight is that maybe you're suffering with cancer whatever it is you can't see what your strength come from is that can't you see where your strength come from not from a surgeon's knife but from God's Word I am your portion I am your strength you draw from me not disregarding the surgeon he does his part that's up to him but God is the healer no surgeon no doctor no medicine every here is no sir they haven't got one yet medicine yet that a hill not even a doctor wouldn't any doctors should tell you that they got AIDS but God is a healer great cinema God is a healer we might get a cat gash in our hand but God has to heal it they haven't got nothing that will build the tissue if they could they could build a man but God is the healer you can set a bone but God is a healer I am the Lord God that heals all your diseases and you can't make God's words lie whoo hallelujah it'll come right back to the truth every time when Abraham got this word and said I'm El Shaddai I'm your strength giver your wife her womb was done dried up she's 40 years past menopause your body as good as dead but don't forget Who I am how should i he just he just brought him Ishmael you know but he said that's not him he'll be a he'll be a great man he'll forget many princes but the one that I made the promise with is between you and Sarah that said Abraham felt real good he said I want to tell you something Abraham I'm going to change your name and he changed it from Abram to Abraham from Sarah - Sarah changed their name something took place Honolua had a name change also he said I no longer call you Church I call you bride a man if something's going to take place he could not give them a child as long as her name remained but here he came to God coming on the scene fulfilling his word right in the moment amen I'm the breast of God draw your strength from me don't even let it go I say in these moments this ain't the time to let go this is time to grab a hold this is a time to hold harder than you ever held this is the time to look straight in to the promises and as my brother saying quit looking at the waters quit listening to the wind look at the Word of God and live hallelujah he's still the breasts of God new an Old Testament just draw your strength from it everything you have need of a baby he's helpless he pulls a strength from his mother that's the only way you can get it that's all the way a believer can get strength is to pull it from the Word of God so if you find yourself weak tonight adjust what you're drawing from hey man not only is the little baby here represented when it's sick it's fretting the mother can bring her to herself and begin to draw strength from her that's the way with a real child of God no matter what the skeptic says or whatever it believes if you truly believe Jesus can't lie you're satisfied that it's revealed to you you've got a promise there's nothing going to stop it on this rock I'll build my church is revealed where the truth while you're waiting resting and faith take God's promise I believe you Lord you promised to give me the baptism of the Holy Spirit hallelujah listen he didn't just promise it in the church he didn't give know why'd they give no regulation as far as I know where it had to be even being your prayer closing be in your homes he can be here it can be anywhere as long as you can humble yourself he said I will give it to you so if you ain't gotta ask and believe he's still given the Holy Ghost he's still moving among his people hallelujah real faith rest upon the solid rock of the promise of God's Word I found this today when fear knocks on your door send faith to answer it sin faith answer any man Isis struck me today huh too many times we go timidly to the door when fear comes knocking and coming in fear and we accept it no you send faith to the door you send faith to the door in faith to kick figure out because fear don't belong where faith is hallelujah Amen maybe you need to say Lord increase my faith any man reman the way that happens and start feeding on the right things hallelujah I can't stress it enough if you find yourself weak and you find yourself down and distressed and word it means you've been feeding on the wrong thing because he's the strong one when you feed from this you don't get weak hallelujah when you feed from this you don't go down and you don't just despair going to despair and despondency know you begin to rise up to claim the promises of God real faith holds on so where did we find their strength in the old New Testament in the
