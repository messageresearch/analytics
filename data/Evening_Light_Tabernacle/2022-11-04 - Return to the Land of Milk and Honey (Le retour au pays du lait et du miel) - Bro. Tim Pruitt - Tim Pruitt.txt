prayers that you prayed for us you're in some very difficulties but we're here today by the grace I want to thank you for may it may Lord may we not just bring our own ideas but may we just speak the words never need will you just Supply them on your peace those around the world I'm listening in at this time not able to gather at this place but because you said that travel would vastly increase that our voice and our image can now be in many places around the world and today we are in speaking in many many different places where your children have assembled together I pray that you'll minister to them foreign this morning if you have found your place we'll start with Zechariah 4 and 1. and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and said unto me what sea is thou and I said I have looked and behold the Candlestick all of gold with a bowl up on the top of it and his seven lamps they're on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof watches Chandelier and two olive trees buy it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other up on the left side thereof is so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me no it's not thou what these be and I said no my Lord is answered and spoken to me saying this is the word the Lord unto zeruba both saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts episodes before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen God bless you can be seated in zechariah's day the Jews would return him back to their homelands they had spent 70 years of Babylonian captivity and they have the task of rebuilding the torn walls of Jerusalem and restoring the temples so it was a time of restoration now there's a great parallel between the natural seed the nation of Israel and the Royal seed the bride of Christ and what God has done for the natural seeds in re-establishing them in their land he is doing the same for the Royal scene and neither can be blessed outside of their land even today because the nation of Israel to come and get 24 000 Jews and bring them back to the promises and nearly 200 000 planning to make their Aliyah yeah what is it it's God Gathering back the last few questions so they can receive their two prophets who will bring them back to their true atonement now brother Branham tells us in Feast of the trumpets their ministry will be the ministry of Elias and Moses calling Israel out of the Jewish Traditions just as the seventh angel called The Bride out of the and remember Moses and Elijah's to call Israel out of the old atonement of lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifices to the Real Living Sacrifice the words and the seventh Angels message and the trumpet exactly the same message is to call the people the bride out of Pentecostal and World traditions the word Christ impersonated in his word among us may flesh us so in zachariah's day the Jews had returned to their land and they were getting ready for the headstones and to do this there was a visitation of the Angels who said that though there are mountains of impossibilities these mountains would be removed but it wouldn't be by man's Minds so The Headstone the finishing Stones would come by and be brought by a message shouting Grace Grace amazing abundant grace [Music] Islam we have barely tapped into what God has foreign amen [Music] the people of the book The purpose you leave has returned to the land of the Bible and Israel after 2 000 years it was now a nation celebrated nearly now nearly 75 years a man's lifetime now at the time of her struggle to become a nation the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and they it established the Jews as the people of the books and if they were the people of them then they were people of the land to the land amen amen amen so you see there were debates questions actually ever lived there and the the scriptures found in the Dead Sea scroll it is the Jews proved to the title to the land on the news it was proof that the Jews were there before the Romans and the scriptures that had been held in obscurity what brought us to life but for them they had no proof in a broken proof but when the Dead Sea Scrolls and now they were promised or they were returning to the land as was promised by the books now don't forget what God did with his words but a Shepherd from Kentucky that threw a rock of Rapids amen bringing neglected and forgotten truth um they lied that light had never shown but they opened up that's only found in the Bible men now these scriptures are not only for the Jewish people they are our scriptures you see the Jews were brought out of the Nations we were brought out of the denomination amen amen Ezekiel 28 25 you see the prophecy is concerning us and the nation of Israel coming back to their Promised Land thus saith the Lord when I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered well it is Mercy and shall be Sanctified in them then shall they dwell in their lives that I have given unto myself amen amen they shall know I am the Lord his father says in Ezekiel 36. they actually describe promise coming of the Holy ghosts justifications amen Hallelujah it's like honey in the Rockets amen blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah turn into Ezekiel 37 11. and then he said unto me son of man [Music] these bombs of the whole house Israel behold they say yes Hallelujah [Music] amen they're going to be gathered house [Music] amen Amos would prophesy in Amos 14. and I will bring again the Captivity of my people and they shall build the way cities and they shall be no more people out of their lives [Music] amen I'm bringing you here and you're not going to be pulling because now this is yours we have seen the return of Israel the Romans claim the holy land their solution was first the Jews from their land the problem and they broke down the temple wall people away and dispersed them all throughout Europe and so then the Romans claimed that land for their kings then some 1500 years ago the Turks wanted the lion and the Arabs resisted the return of the Jews it is they claimed the promised land for theirselves and even Britain wanted as a part of the British Empire and they did everything [Music] wanted to have a place of Their Own and so this is what they desired that the phenomena of the wandering jew the female Roots anywhere in the world they wanted their own place Hitler's final Solutions systematic annihilation of six million Jews the Jews were people nobody wanted they didn't fit in anywhere and after the war yeah there were still thousands yes Millions the medium and the medium of ref foreign though all the people of the earth be gathered against us began to return back to their ancient homelands and yet they're the British who still controlled the land we're turning them away they wouldn't even let their ships come in and the people that we know as a Palestinians they rushed him from all other Arab Nations to keep the Jews from it but the Jews were going there because God said that's good I will restore says you see that was a prophecy and the Dead Sea Scrolls amen the word the Lord nice in your day in this message why National foreign persecution amen this was a bride also you know he was not wanted among them I don't want these odd looking invert by the decisions are people who believe in predestinence who can't believe that in that eating an apple was the original series are people that that refused to believe in the midst in the midst of a talking snake and a magician and that the sea Davis the people that reject the Trinity of God that's not even in the Bible but people that are one God I believe in people hey man we're a bunch of misfites to the place where we belong and it flows amen amen amen amen the Jews we will never have another Holocaust never again will they sit possibly by Blues are taken back to some denominations amen hallelujah amen like before September the 11th noon September there in the United States that was it that's your name the the Airlines were taught to be passively please don't resistance it might be inconvenient but there'd be a lot less loss of life and they they became so fast I'm the only with a few box knives took over the plane without resistance and let them fly those planes into the Twin Towers it'll never happen again it'll never happen again a few men and women after 9 11. thanks it is foreign amen amen amen hallelujah amen we are people who have recovered and after seven churches and the church began firmly rooted in the land of the Bible the correct Bible doctrines amen but then come to fall in a way and as an Ephesian Church lost her first love Believers were dispersed among the denominations and I've been out of their Homeland for thousands of years but in this day there was a call came out come out of here so same as the Midnight Cry The Virgins of Matthew 25 yeah hallelujah amen today in this third accident God has sent us a prophet to deliver the children of Israel amen hallelujah amen that's the message it said the cancers diabetes amen we are here in the land haven't returned to the gospel we return to the god of the Bible [Music] [Music] yeah I win the called at the Olympics that's not our hero their heroes are men who can kill a giant with the stones fire can't burn that fire can't bite a man who through faithlessness men like in the Joshua there were other ages where we just walked around the walls and silence no we've seen the silence and the land is open too and to us as Believers it is open for the Believers every resource and amen amen sorry I didn't know it'd be this complicated to take off my coat they're gonna be my best Mountain we've seen the silence broken and the land is the Believers and it's open to us every resource and this has granted us untapped resource that Justice Israel had to conquer the land of it before them after seeing the walls of Jericho they opened it's only the beginning and the rest of the land before us oh people today are looking for the third pole and a quick short work what just how long is this quick short word three and a half years will it be seven years well brother Branham told us exactly how long ago it's not a year it's not a month it's an age he said this layout of cnasis of the quick work do you realize you are in the quick one yeah amen it's not just coming it's always been here amen or the third phase was as he said in the anointed once at the end time the First full healing now second Paul prophesies and the Mysteries revealed there's no more higher order to reveal them he's on the way the prophet can be Vindicated and remember the third poem to reveal the hidden things all you say foreign thank you but for the most part it's been untapped measures it still lays there is untapped resources listen to what brothers well I was told in Danny Henry's prophecy and because he didn't go what's the denomination because that has chosen the narrative the harder way of what I produce thou has walked of thine ownership as he said in other words but I stayed with the words thou has picked the correct and precise decisions and this is my way and because of this momentous decision oh the decision a huge portion of Heaven you see because he would not go with denominations God entrusted him with a huge portion of Heaven now he explains Heaven is not portioned off to different portions to us is the Kingdom of Heaven that's within us yes he said that and he said Heaven is the Kingdom of Heaven that's within us what is it his portions this greater portion of Heaven would be the mysteries of God would be given to him would be taken off the bus to give us entrance to open up every promise so he said glorious decision now please yes is that which will give me and make to come to pass the tremendous was given amen might as well wake up to it this is the third phase the president was advised you have been seen in the vision Hallelujah I don't care if some of you are out of steps amen but because you are broken you will hear the prophets a man [Music] that opened up the seven seas only said two and thus opened up the entire world it was all based now the third pole was based on description Mark 11 23. that speaks of untapped research that is given to the church it reveals on Mark 11 22. right yeah I always wondered about the scriptures he said I actually wondered well since that was given before the atonement [Music] it wasn't in fact then after the atonement but he said sitting there God began to show him Mark 11 23. for verily I say unto you [Music] if you need a devil foreign God's you foreign [Applause] [Music] innovation of her faces that were found in the early Church of the same holy spirit that worked in the church the people who are now sometimes hallelujah amen we have received the sealsely soup that opened up the land of the Bible well let's go into the full inheritance with this it's like Joshua conquering Jericho must be first conquered up but once the walls are down the land is much more to be conquered there are things that are laying right before that are waiting for you to take yeah that you have not obtained they are laying there so what was it waiting for you to go but steps amen amen amen student advancing you know and see what God promised we lose somebody else we look forward we have um Jesus said whatsoever you say to this mountain don't doubt in your heart no conditions man [Applause] will a spirit-born Spirit-filled man in faith on his some niggerless piece takes that word into his heart he replaces and upon his lips ah that is the same as deities [Music] amen when Paul brought the word when he possessed the land he said the word came in power as well so don't the word actually demonstrated the word preached actually demonstrated itself manifested like a flame and cutting sword like a surgeon's knife it cut out diseases everywhere those early Believers went preaching the gospel and God the sick Devils were casting they spoke in newtons that word that word is don't give up shoes operating under a commission under the blood of Bones God's people begin to torment torments saying time after time let my people I'm out amen it's not a time to let the devil Trump all over amen no sir no man we are devil defeaters it's the same as it was today well you know some devils are stubborn and Pharaoh got stubborn but the more stubborn he became the more determined God he said I will have his from my firstborn to serve me is The Voice amen now you're not standing under the blood of bullets [Music] [Music] what position are you in do we have get a song what is our atonement aren't we the sinless pure virginity amen say let her be frog it wasn't a frog in the country our time they were ten foot deep it was God the Creator hiding himself can be used to put a man in position to speak the created word of God why would you stumble at the police Jesus Christ [Music] amen amen oh Hallelujah and he said it builds a bridge across this castle that takes man connection to the presence and makes him a son amen a Son of God Amen God taken a humble Center cleansing him by his blood dropping that confessed sin into that Clorox of the blood of his son and putting his own life into that place then if we have the genuine bastards what's wrong with us when the type when Elijah dropped the road for Elijah he's got a double portion Jesus said the words and he asked again what's wrong season he's asking what's wrong well yeah the Pentecostals were too busy too happy building accounts outside of the promised land for me and we're just satisfied with Justice right it is man God's asking the same questions what's wrong with the church where are we standing this is not another denominational movement not just another denomination where you joined up and socialize and you pick out your pews this is a day when the people who know their God will do actions amen amen in the first exercise the people of the book used abuse are you with me why because God's word it said to the Seed of Abraham that they would return to the land of Abraham and nothing could stop and Pharaoh resisted so God used the voice of a man to plant the devil for mentally flew until he had to let them go the people of the book open the Red Sea and it stood in heaps yes hey man amen anything that got in their way I'm trying to tell you if there's something between you give us to keep the bride of Christ man in that day the people of the book is going to leave stop the Sun and defeated five Kings and put their feet upon their necks right is that right tiffly amen the people of the books don't you leave them stop the sun hell made the day a little longer till we can kill all ourselves in me you say oh brother Tim let's have it all ended that's not what Joshua said let the day last a little yeah I want to see death defeated I want to see that in Christ who Joshua says you know those five Kings and you put in that cave bring them out I want you to put your feet I want all the Elders of Israel to come put their feet you see God wants you to have your own personality it's not just the prophets and God wants you to put it oh man Hallelujah man every example second example of the Bible it shows a resource if you limit God limited you you can limit Christ and if you limit the church today if you limit the church he said that is God is known by simple things God in you and he brings you a Son of God changes your nature amen [Music] he said the devil's trying to hide you back and tell you that you're some little trouble you're not your sons let me assure you God has not left the Earth and God has not abandoned this dude if he never leave the Earth God has always been here [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] amen We are continuing from where the first church fell now you see they were predestined if you go in the ground and be planted come up but we have been predestined foreign hallelujah amen I'm talking about the church people do they please sure we'll still have people who died but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the church paid in denominational systems to go in the garden so in the message the token said a woman and her husband so does the Bride In Christ become the ministry of the Bride the minister of the Rebus and the ministry of Christ amen amen now so the ministry of Christ and the ministry so go back and look what Christ did Christopher and you know what you can because they're saying Christ amen are you with me amen now he said he said his flesh which is his body been laying there dead for years gradually begin to come the reformation and now she's standing oh I wish I had time that's in the land foreign [Music] I mean I believe this pictures don't limit your faith to some limited get out here on some other kind of face yourself and your God faith is just know exactly how to use it and it'll be all right you can put it right to work you're not waiting on face it's already in you amen my brother Brandon would use different things we would talk about a little tiny fish in the ocean it's like you trying to exhaust God's love could you imagine a little fish afraid and saying wait a minute I better think about it I better drink of this water spiritually I might run out of water you know a little fish about that question about that big in the middle of the Earth and he said that could easily be could easily be done more easier then you could ask too much so he's telling us we're like a little fish in the ocean of God's spirit and we're surrounded I said where amen [Music] amen yeah Hallelujah man amen amen now that's what he was saying you're not going to excite God's power his Mercy he said it's like a little mouse you know that was stored up seven years worth yeah a little bitty Mouse these great big towers storage billions because I might run out and he said that's the way the creep people act as Christians we get up every morning oh God bless my family today foreign when you receive man [Music] [Music] man you're not gonna miss the ride you are the second Olympic Hallelujah so you drink more than your portions you see Jesus you say come to me all the ends of the Earth but the devil don't care how much you come as long as you don't drink some of you have made real efforts to be here and these words but it's not going to do you anything unless you dream and you're gonna have to drink then you're allotted portions amen hallelujah amen amen you can't be afraid to let your faith loose don't let some critical Spirits the music is tired too loud he's not my favorite Christianity he Don't Preach down my line of things you know some critical something come on put all that aside we got an inexhaustible amen amen well I'll tell you it's a bit too much Sunday or Saturday morning Saturday Sunday morning I tell you we got untapped that God has got laid up for the church give the man the woman in the kingdom of God to sustain you I'm warning you don't fill up quickly Hallelujah [Music] [Music] the position one that Satan cannot stop amen amen amen Church doesn't need to cower down and hide from the Devils oh we're powerless maybe some something let's just hide behind our fears one day when we are adopted we have the power nonsense no said you know now we are the same no some new defensive Euros currency Powers hey man we are positioned to some positions foreign son [Applause] that's what happened on the day of business Hallelujah brother Branham said you see the reaction over here just like it did when it was over here now it's on Earth in the flesh of the adopted sense of God bring in the church together for the Son of God to come and get them any booze oh oh brother if only brother Brandon was here I'm just looking for that Prophet to come back I want him to come back there's going to be a resurrection man sister Karen will arise all of these brothers that we and sisters amen I'm looking for brother amen with the dead in Christ he will rise but I want you to know we do not need the physical presence to be the sons of God we do not need to wait on him you have power remember he said as I leave this city your spirit will not leave it'll stay here until it brings back together so he said when I leave the city it will not leave until the god comes down amen so you see that's what he did he comes he is here on Earth amen he has come into physical bodies and it is the same in every detail except he's not in the man of Galilee Alex amen if [Music] foreign Hallelujah men amen strong meat belonging to them that are full age God's bringing the people into your hour are the manifestations of the sons of God this is what we're talking about this is the third person amen and this is what God is doing men we're in the time of restitution amen amen so therefore everything that heaven holds belongs to us you think that huge portion of Heaven says he was given to him to give to you amen come on Charlie please when Moses went up and got the temples they were written by the fingers but they wasn't for Moses [Music] Moses received as a representative Moses the Lord see and the word of the Lord it is our land don't say it's for Moses don't say only Joshua men it's your life it's your book say don't leave amen when John went and took the book it wasn't for jobs they'll surprise you have kept it down when it upset others are you with me when you kept swallowing it but now friends he's coming back out amen that is a prophet [Music] hallelujah amen I'm trying to close now we got close here in just a few minutes but I want to hit just a few more questions you see the flag of redemption landed on any promise it speaks that this is our possession and that what Jesus Paid for us but now an eternity amen when uh when someone conquers the land they plan a flag upon amen and I'm trying to tell you plant the flag I'll never promise of God Amen put that flag over your children it was one night in one of our services there was a young girl she came up in the prayer line and she wanted her brother said my brother's living in the world you know he's and drugs and alcohol got a worldly girlfriend our family is divided and she wanted her brother back there in that prayer line she waved the flag of her down she expected on that promise me the Holy Spirit the sentence please woke up that Wayward brothers and he got him out of bed and he drove to the church that's been six years ago this is my process man I was in Jerusalem where this message came from actually I was in Jerusalem on the gold Dome of the mosque we heard the story we're in The Six Day War when Israel took possession of the Temple Mount composition and for the first time in 2000 years the Jews this Reef had access to the temples now this is where the Solomon's Temple says this is where they say that Abraham Allah you see this was their language but they was not able to go there even though they possess the other promises but now
