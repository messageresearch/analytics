start let's see if we can fix there we go hey man let's go to prayer Heavenly Father Lord once again we gathered on a Friday evening to look into your word Lord and just we asked that you would come now and that you would open it to us and that you would reveal it to us and Lord that it wouldn't just be a lesson but that Lord you would open it to our hearts or that you would reveal it Lord to these young people Lord that you would reveal it to each one of us in a deeper in a greater way father Lord that we can see the word for our day Lord the word for our hour Lord and we can be changed from glory to glory Lord as we read your word now I pray that you'll just take complete control and that you'll Speak Lord in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen and if you'll remain standing with me we're going to go ahead and and read our scripture which would correspond here with the the church age that we're studying the smyrnian age and I love this uh graphic that brother Michael found on online earlier and put it up to go along with our study and so we're going to read about the smyrnian age here and it is Revelation 2 and it's verses 8 through 11. it says and unto the angel of the Church of Smyrna right these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy works and tribulations and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and you shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death amen I pray the Lord is Blessing as you have your seats this evening and what we're covering tonight we we've made it to we're going to be finishing up the second uh Church age which is the Smart age of smyrnia and we're on the second part of that and just a quick review as we kind of settle in and look at some of the things we spoke about last time um brother Branham said that using our god-given rule of choosing the messenger for each Age We unhesitatingly declare that irenius was exalted by the Lord to that position and and what he's talking about and we've talked about this each and every time is is a pattern that the Lord showed him and he said that the messenger would be the one who's whose Ministry closest resembled that of the first church age messenger Paul and so using that pattern he looks and he's led to the Holy Spirit and he declares that the messenger to this age was ireneous and and we learned and talked about that the age lasted from 170 A.D to 312 A.D and during this time it wasn't an easy time to be a Christian that the population of Smyrna was mostly against Christianity it was an age of great persecution and great bitterness and we learned that the word Smyrna means bitter and we ended last time talking about that the 10 years of tribulation that they suffered and how they were faithful unto death and that they received a crown of life whenever they uh for for staying faithful and we talked about how all of this persecution was actually done in the name of religion the the false Vine came in and began to get stronger and they began to claim that they were the true and they said that those of the True Vine were actually Heretics and Fanatics and that they must be purged out of the church thus leading to to Great persecution in prison and torture and and even death and as we finished up last time this was one of the last things that we read and this quote really stood out to me even in the days following our study because many of them did seal their testimony with their life but brother Branham says they died in the faith like Antipas the faithful martyr they held not their lives dear unto death often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and the martyrs the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour blessed be God forever so so young people the exact same faith that you use every single day is the exact same faith that they use to stand in the Coliseum that they use to hold their testimony When lines were released upon them or when Gladiators or or whatever was done to them is the exact same faith and what I want you to focus on is it will produce the exact same victory in your life as it produced in their life if that Faith was enough and that Grace was enough for the hour that they stood in that faith in that Grace will be perfect and enough for the hour that you stand in that that's what it's saying when it says the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour in other words in the hour that you live whatever it is that you face in your hour of Temptation his grace is sufficient and your hour of sickness his grace is sufficient in your hour of trial and tribulation whatever it is you facing in 2023 the Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour will be there for you amen amen so we began reading this time at the reward for overcoming and so most of our Focus tonight will come out of Revelations 2 and 11 and it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death now to establish right off the bat exactly what is the second death we're going to look at Revelations 20 and 14. so it says you're not going to be hurt of the second death he that overcometh how many hears Overcomers tonight so it says you're not going to be heard of the second death what is the second death and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death all right so we established that right that is for for us if we want to simplify and talk about in terms of Heaven and Hell going to hell would be the second death okay but it's telling you right off the bat that you're not gonna be hurt of the second death what I want you to notice here in verse 11 is that once again he is speaking to all the ages okay because he says unto thee churches so he's not being specific to one church or one age this message goes unto all the ages he's speaking to all the ages here and he gives a message of comfort and he says to those that overcome the second death will not hurt them no brother Branham goes from this right here and he and right in this moment he begins to teach on no eternal hell he begins to teach on how that we don't believe that hell can be Eternal and he says right here very strongly he says but I stand here on the authority of the word of God and deny that the believer goes to it that the unbeliever excuse me that the unbeliever goes to an eternal hell and burns there eternally in the first place hell or the Lake of Fire or whatever you want to call it is not Eternal how can it be if it had a beginning now many times I think when we talk about eternity we think from now until time never stopping but eternity also means never had a beginning so if hell had a beginning if it was created it also must have an end all things that have a beginning also have an end so as we look into this no eternal hell I want to read Matthew 25 and 41. it says then shall he say also unto them on the left he's talking about they've been divided under the left hand and unto the right hand some are going to go into eternal life but he says to them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into Everlasting fire and what's the next word somebody it's okay y'all don't be scared tonight thank you prepared for the devil and his angels the key word here is prepared because if it was prepared then it wasn't without beginning Eternal is without beginning or end if it has a preparation or a beginning it must have an ending so so hell might last a really really really really really really long time it might be millions of years I don't know I don't plan on finding out and it might be long times but it is not Eternal it can't be it can't be Eternal because it was created and therefore it is a part of time if it was created as a part of time but one day time is going to end and only that which has eternal life can continue on think about it now only that which has eternal life can continue on so if it was created in time like hell when time ends hell must end also now a lot of people get hung up right here on the word Everlasting fire Everlasting that means that means Eternal no Everlasting does not mean that the word Everlasting means from the ages to the ages and in different places when it's used Everlasting has different meanings attached to it in other places it means to the vanishing point so it does not mean Eternal and brother Branham spends time on this um speaking about no eternal hell so let's talk about eternal for just a second Eternal brother Brown says when it applies to God it means to be without beginning or end and ever enduring and never ceasing so look at first John 5 and 11 it says and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son now we're laying this down pretty heavy because it serves both purposes not only to show that there is no eternal hell but also we want to also get rid of the idea of well if things that are created must come to an end what about me I had a beginning I had a creation we want to do away with that because we're going to find that you possess Eternal qualities that there are qualities about you placed in you that God placed there that are Eternal and we have to get out of this mind frame of why I was born in 1980 or whatever year you were born yes that's when this flesh became manifested here on the Earth but that's not my beginning because I did not have a beginning amen he says this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son so only sons of God can have eternal life only sons of God can have eternal life brother Brandon says now if a sinner is going to go to hell and then suffer the same as you are going to heaven and enjoy heaven then he has to have the same kind of life you have in other words he says Eternal he's getting down to it he says eternal life isn't a matter of geographic location it isn't you get eternal life but you get rewards and you're happy and you get eternal life but you're in fire burning the the entire time because in order to burn eternally you would have to have eternal life and so brother Branham is making this very clear that the sinner can't have eternal life because the only place to get eternal life is in the Sun the only place to get it is through Jesus Through the blood that was shed for for his children Sinners do not have that eternal life brother Branham says eternal life is God the Lord Jesus Christ and I want to tell you tonight the only way you're going to make it there is with that life the only way you're going to live eternally is to completely surrender your life to the Lord Jesus this life is in his son you won't find eternal life in your own well-doing you won't find eternal life in your works you won't find eternal life anywhere but in surrendering your heart to the Lord Jesus and saying Lord take all of me take all of me because that's the only way you're going to live eternally and the only place anyone will ever live eternally is in heaven no one will live eternally in Hell amen that's what he's saying the redeemed don't have to fear hell they don't have to fear the second death because they are Overcomers the second death will never hurt the Overcomers he says and they will never come into condemnation he's talking about you they will never be in that Lake of Fire they would they they can never be lost for he will lose none of them not one of the redeemed will be anywhere except where Jesus is hallelujah I'm not going to be anywhere except where Jesus is and I love because he begins to break it down and who it is that came and died for you who was it that came and shed his blood for you he was Jehovah he was the creator he was God Almighty and he says oh how striking it is now think about it a lot of you have watched the the episodes of The Chosen and and you love the the humanity part that you see and how relatable that they make Jesus and I've actually enjoyed that because brother Branham does the exact same thing he says how striking it is Jehovah born crying over a manure pile Jehovah born in a manger of straw it was Jehovah that came and paid the price for your sins it was the the Creator that came and said they will never taste of the second death they will never go down into hell whether it's one year five years ten years or a million years I don't care what it is Jehovah came Jehovah died for you Jehovah shed his blood for you it was the blood of almighty God that came to make sure my children will never taste of the second death my children will never go down into hell I'm gonna go down and I'm going to pay the price for them to make sure you would never experience the torment of Hell to make sure that you could be healed to make sure that you could be delivered tonight from whatever it is that's coming against you to make sure that you could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jehovah did that almighty God did that and he came down and he took on flesh to do that for you he says then we think we have a right to be proud holding up our noses criticizing and acting as though we were somebody think about it no matter how well you were raised no matter how well you have it no matter how well you've accomplished the most accomplished the most Almighty the most awesome the most wonderful the most Sublime being that ever was lowered himself and humbled himself and came and was born over a manure power he says here's your real sign this is the right one Jehovah playing as a boy Jehovah working in a carpenter shop Jehovah washing the feet of fishermen Jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow spit on his face mocked and said it not Jehovah despised and rejected hanged naked upon a cross while the Hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross Jehovah dying if this doesn't do something to you something's wrong with you Jehovah dying Jehovah praying nothing happening then Jehovah died that is the sign for all men now that is the sign who did it who did it for you I didn't God did it for you God himself came and did it he humbled himself for you he humbled himself that you can be saved and we want to lick it up our nose and act like we're something or somebody how about we humble ourselves and be patient with others how about we humble ourselves and have Grace for others how about we lay down ourselves and and step aside from who we think we are and how good we are and realize we got to have Grace for others who may be struggling listen he left heaven for your struggles he left Heaven because he knew you couldn't do it and he came down and took on flesh and he went through all of that for you but I've got good news for you he didn't stay dead he didn't stay in a tomb but he wanted more for you than just than just the price to be paid he wanted to make it to where you could live an overcoming life he wanted to make it to where the very spirit that lived on the inside of him could come back and live on the inside of you they put him in a tomb but he didn't stay there but he rose back up and what was the point of the Resurrection the point of the Resurrection to show I have conquered death and hell and the grave and then he ascended what was the point of that that he could send back his holy spirit to live in your life that you could have eternal life brother Branham says Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended on high then Jehovah returned to indwell his church Jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire Jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and Empower his people once more Jehovah came and this time to stay in his people and again Jehovah heals the sick raises the dead manifest himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation Jehovah came back and he gave you himself that you could overcome sin that you could overcome the world that you could overcome the devil he gave you the holy ghost that God again could be manifested in the flesh in his body on the earth and call it his bride think about it he was manifested in the flesh once in Jesus but he wanted to be manifested in the flesh The Same Spirit once again manifested to where people could see it touch it and how's he going to do it once again in a body called The Bride he says yes Jehovah came to manifest In the Flesh and manifest through flesh Jehovah came God in us the the hope of glory yes Jesus came and shed his blood and set the captive free he came and redeemed his lost sheep he gave them eternal life and they shall never perish he won't lose one of them but raised them up at the last day Hallelujah the second death cannot hurt them it has no power over them hell is the second death it will have an end but you will not it will hurt many but it will never hurt you why is that because we are a part of him hopefully we can drive that home tonight that we are a part of him and because of that you will live eternally the only thing that is eternal is God and so in order to live eternally you must be a part of God those cast into the Lake of Fire are not a part of him so how could they ever live eternally how could they live eternally even in punishment even if it was for the sake of punishment for rejecting what the Lord did for them they would still have to have eternal life on the inside they would have to have the very life of God on the inside and brother Branham makes it very clear that is not possible but regardless of how long hell is or how long hell isn't I'm just glad that the second dead hath no power over me and that the second death have no power over you because we've been bought with the very blood of God the very blood of god Jehovah the Creator came and took on flesh and shed that blood for you so that when time stops you're going to keep right on going when time stops you're going to March right on into eternity and be living forevermore not in torture not in torment but in the glories that he has prepared for you amen amen the Holy Spirit in every age once again it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches there is not one Church age where this verse isn't mentioned every time it's mentioned he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches now it's obvious that he's not talking about literal ears okay it's not he's not talking about literally hearing the way that you're hearing me tonight that's not what he what he's talking about because we all have ears and physically we can all hear so what is it that he's saying here what is it that he's speaking of when he says he that hath an ear let him hear I want to go through some different scriptures here to highlight our point and to make this very clear to all of us what it means to hear and what he's talking about Matthew 13 13. therefore speak out to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiahs which saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing in their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I shall should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear he says they hear me but they don't hear me they see me but they're not seeing me so once again it's obvious that we're not talking about just naturally but then he comes back and he says but you hear no he's not talking about this he's talking about the other kind of hearing you're understanding what the spirit is saying John 8 42 Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I am proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh Allah he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it notice why do you not understand my speech because you cannot hear my words it's in these scriptures that it becomes clear that no man within his own power can hear God no man within himself no matter how hard he tries can hear God it is an ability given by God we found this in Matthew 16 17 and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven why was Simon barjona able to understand because he tried real hard because he thought about it real long and hard no but because his father in Heaven hath revealed it to him so it is God that gives the revelation of what the spirit is saying in each age he that hath an ear he who hath understanding he who the spirit has been that God has revealed it to him and you sit there and say well well this is hard then then who can who can understand who can hear who is it that God is giving this spiritual Revelation to ears to hear Brother Branham says it is one special group that receives the Revelation for each age one listen I want you to understand something tonight you're special you are a special group it is one special group that receives the Revelation for each age that group is of God because the group that cannot hear is not of God we just read that scripture he says you're of your father the devil because you can't understand and hear what I'm saying the group that can and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives the Revelation thereof is that group described in First Corinthians 2 6-16 they are the ones who have the spirit of God they are the ones that are born of God they are baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit they are baptized with the Holy Ghost listen before we go any further we ought to thank God that we have ears to hear we ought to thank God today that we are part of the group that has been chosen and called and elected to receive this message and not just have it cross our path but not only just have it just hear it but really be able to hear it really be able to recognize who we are and where we are and whose we are and where we're standing because you have ears to hear listen there are many that hear it with these ears there are many that hear it but it's never refilled to them they just can't see it they just can't understand it they just can't accept it but you can you can receive it you can accept it because you have ears to hear tonight Hallelujah but what does that think about what that says about who you are think about what that says about whose you are tonight not not just hear and say well I accept it that that's good but someone who truly hears it and how do you know if someone truly hears it because they will take it and they will allow it to begin affecting their lives you will see them living by living according to it and you will see their life begin to change because of it they have heard brother Branham says and to every age we hear the same truth it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches but only a Spirit-filled man can hear the Revelation for that age why do you think you hear it said over and over and over again that it's got to be more than a head knowledge because if it's only a head knowledge or it's only that something that's been learned then you're only hearing it with these ears that's what a head knowledge is you've heard it you see it well that makes sense okay that makes sense and you you can stack this with this and point it you're just hearing it but when you were born again with the Holy Spirit and he can actually reveal it to your soul to where it becomes deeper and more and anchored down than that from up here and it drops down to here brother Branham says only a Spirit-filled man can hear the Revelation for that age that's why you can sit there for years and years and years and I've I was there in that place in rebellion and not understanding this and not understanding that and why do we have to do this and why do we have to do this and why this and why that and then get filled with the Holy Ghost and all your wives go away all the things that used to hang me up why can't I do this and why isn't this wrong all of a sudden those questions don't matter anymore it doesn't even matter if I can answer those questions those questions are gone because the Revelation that this is the truth can now be struck down on the inside of my heart and even if I don't understand something I can say Lord I know it's the truth now you can lead me and guide me and let me hear exactly what it is you're trying to say there's a huge difference between someone who just knows about it and somebody whose ears have been opened by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen brother Branham says now when God is silent we had better be silent but where he has spoken we had better speak to and say what he has already said he told us the evidence now I want to listen y'all to listen close as we get into some things here the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we would have an inside have the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived it I want to read that again because I missed a part so the teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation in other words you can't receive all the truth if the spirit isn't on the inside of you and so this is how you have to measure your experience we're going to go into this for a minute because there's different ways and and you you hear it preached here all the time the Dynamics and the Dynamics and we believe that absolutely but brother Brown I'm saying here that those who are filled with the Holy Ghost Hear the word receive the word and live it so how do we measure or how do we uh what is the Plumb line for our experience well brother Aaron I ran and I shouted and I felt the Holy Ghost when it fell on me brother Aaron I spoke in tongues and it was a supernatural event I felt a shiver come over me as I began speaking in tongues that's not it the sign of the indwelling is they heard it they received it and they lived it he says in every age and I love this part he adds in and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for a True Believer I say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and told it to them the spirit inside of them takes what they hear on Sunday takes what they hear on Wednesday takes what they read in their own bedroom it takes it and teaches it to them it is an inside teacher it teaches it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it the key here is and lived it not just the parks they liked not just the doctrines they like but all of it that includes the Dynamics that includes the movement of the spirit that includes deliverances and healings and tongues and prayer lines but it also includes the doctrines the standards the sacrifices that come along with it it includes all of that all of that the people who are truly filled with the Holy Ghost will want to see all of that they will hear it They will receive it and they will live it and they won't try to explain it away because they can truly hear what the spirit is saying to each age let's deal for a moment here because this isn't really understood even today amongst many to receive the Holy Spirit what does this mean now the Pentecostals believed and brother Branham talks about this that people receive the Holy Spirit after being born again and that it would manifest in the speaking of tongues and he talked about how when he would call for those filled with the spirit to come down and pray for those at the altar those you know that needed the the Holy Spirit he said they would come down and he says and I'm you know wanting them to be born again he says the Pentecostals would come down thinking they were already born again but needed the Holy Spirit so they began praying with them that they would speak in tongues or some other manifestation of the holy spirit because they were born again but now they needed to have the Holy Spirit come upon them okay and this this isn't wrong I mean this isn't right excuse me this is wrong this is wrong all right but to be born again and to be Spirit-filled are the same thing you can't separate those two and this is what causes a lot of issues and and misunderstanding things even when it comes to adoption what is the new birth what is the Holy Spirit what is to be born again is to receive the Holy Ghost before the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are not born again brother Branham teaches that clearly it's more than just believing and confessing I'm talking about being born again it's more than just believing and confessing although you must do that you must do that that's an important step you must believe you must confess you must be baptized those things are all important steps but you don't receive the Holy Ghost just by Believing on the Lord that's not how it works here's a quote brother Branham says you receive him since you believed Acts 19 2 and 6 he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed so yes you do receive the Holy Ghost after you believe my point is when you believe that's not being born again you believe and then you receive the holy ghost or the new birth or you are born again okay it is something that comes later but it's not you're born again and then you receive the new birth because that don't even make sense born again and then receive the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit the New Birth the Holy Ghost that's all the same thing okay brother Brown says I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again read it carefully which is to be baptized in the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same so what he says here is that's exactly what took place at Pentecost so what he's saying is the hundred and twenty were not born again until the day of Pentecost that's when they truly received eternal life think about what he had said to Peter when you're converted you jump on a guy that's giving up everything and following you don't understand I've given up everything and I follow Jesus okay but you need to be converted you need the Holy Ghost you need to be born again brother Branham says now here is my point and listen close too many of our modernists and even our fundamentalists so-called believe unto salvation at a certain specific time which in many cases is called making a decision and that has been called receiving Christ or being born again now to receive Christ is to receive his Spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen these folks believe that's wonderful but they stop there they're not born again they've stopped there yes they still need the Holy Ghost to come after they believe that's because they need the new birth all they've done so far is believed unto salvation he says but they stop there you receive the Holy Ghost after you believe it has always been that way and it always will be amen he says here Pentecost was the pattern of New Birth he says it is the spirit that gives life in power and that came at Pentecost he says these directions came as a direct answer from Peter relative to what had actually happened at Pentecost what came to pass was that God according to Joel was pouring out the promised Holy Spirit upon All Flesh he was not poured out before that time or given before that time he was not poured out before Pentecost he was not given before Pentecost this was it but this was to come from now on by repenting and being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then God was Duty bound to fill the ones who came Peter or any of the Apostles never said you must be born again and then filled with the spirit that's not how it works but I love what he said from that point on he's Duty bound young people if you need the Holy Ghost he's Duty bound that if you'll follow the same prescription if you'll repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if you've done those things and it hasn't come to pass there's something wrong with your repentance because if you were baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and you haven't gotten filled with the spirit yet the only place there can be a problem is in the repent part there is something wrong with your repentance you're holding on to something you're not giving up something that's the only place where there can be a problem is in the repentance because he says he's obligated to still give it to you exactly the way he gave it to them then the new birth is the Holy Ghost before that like I said you're only believing unto salvation let's move on here now this first quote is something we're still dealing with the same thing it's an interesting quote I'm gonna read it and then we'll go into it what is it that caused this misunderstanding he's talking about people thinking they're born again and needing the holy ghost or what is the new birth and this and this is a very interesting quote and it gets thrown around a lot when it comes to the moving of the spirit and the Supernatural and and what kind of experience we're supposed to have what is it that calls this misunderstanding the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not the word away with experience and they'll stop there but read it away with experience as your measuring line there is only one Plumb line only one rod and that is the word the key here is as your measuring line away with experience as your measuring line and like I said people will use this quote many times to explain away the experience of the new birth but let's use it properly let's place it in its proper place in other words you can jump and you can shout you can speak in tongues you can see the pillar of fire you can be slain in the spirit but that isn't how you know you got it he's saying take that experience and use the word as your measuring line because there's lots of people who have spoken tongues who have danced who have shouted who have ran who've had experiences and I would never take that from them but then their life doesn't live up to the word and if they're basing it off experience well yes I got it look what happened look at my experience and we'll say but what about your life what about measuring it up to the word that's the Plumb line is there a standard of Holiness are the fruits of the spirit there are you living in overcoming life that's how you know you got it but it's not to do away with the experience is to do away with the experience as your measuring stick because so many would live like the world and then point to a tongue that's what brother Brandon was dealing with well I've got the Holy Ghost I spoke in tongues but living like the devil and he was saying quit pointing to the experience point to the word look into the mirror of the word and does it match up is your life matching what the word says and that's what this quote is for use the word this very next quote is in the exact same paragraph I didn't even change paragraphs he says the people believe and then stop you don't receive the Holy Ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the Holy Ghost do you see it that is what's wrong with our fundamentalist they have no power for they stop short of Pentecost so you can't say he's against experience when in the very next sentence he's saying you've got to go to Pentecost you've got to have what they had at Pentecost you can't stop short of the Pentecostal experience but you better compare it to the word you better use the word as your measuring stick and I want it known that's what we believe at evening like Tabernacle we believe that yes the word is the Plumb line the word is our measuring stick that is the word but the word tells me what happened at Pentecost the word shows me what happened when Moses met the burning bush the word tells me that there were the signs that I do shall you do also that is the word so that is the measuring stick take the same quote and apply it to your church because according to the word all these gifts and Supernatural things should be operating in every local body use the word because the very same thing that people use to say word word word to douse on the supernatural actually confirms that the supernatural must be present that we must have experience we must have the moving of the spirit we must have healings and we must have gifts and we must have going we must have the power or the authority to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that is the word that is our Plumb line and that's what we measure everything by is the word amen so I believe the same thing don't stop short until you have had the experience of the new birth and then let the word be your measuring then let the word be your Plumb line as brother Branham would say there God's choosing a lot of this part was very encouraged to me encouraging to me sometimes we wonder why why are are we his why me why am I his why why do I hear what the spirit is saying when there's so many others out there why is it that they can't hear why why do I have eternal life and not this one what makes me so special and we have to realize that just as a man chooses his bride in the natural so does God choose his bride it's God that does the choosing and here's a few scriptures that would illustrate that John 6 37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me so it's his choosing he has chosen the ones that he's given it didn't say all will come to me it's the ones that the father hath given me verse 44 no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him it's him doing the choosing it's him doing the calling it's him doing the drawing Ephesians 1 and 4 according as he had chosen us wait wait but no I chose God I went down to the Altar and he had chosen us he chose you according as he had chosen Us in him now this is the key and we're going to be getting in on this a lot here as we go forward in him is a key phrase in him before the foundation of the world so where were you before the foundation of the world in him that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children how can you not come to the full adoption when you were already predestinated to do it by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will why did he choose you because he wanted to it was the good pleasure of his will it gave him good pleasure to do it brother Brown says Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their bride today and I don't know about you but this really excites me because if it was me doing the choose and I could fail if it was me that was doing all this I could mess up but if he chose me then he can't unchoose me if he called your name he didn't call your name to let you go if he loved me then he loves me today if he said I was going to make it he's not going to let me fail because it was him that chose me if he said I was part of his bride there's no backing up there's no backing up there's nothing can mess that up now we may have troubles and tribulations and things that stumble us along the way but if he loved you and he called you and he chose you you're gonna be there he can't unchoose you he can't change your mind it don't matter it can't change his mind it don't matter what the devil says to you it don't matter what angle it comes from God loves you as we heard Wednesday night he cares for you if he ever cared he still cares if he ever chose you you're still chosen you're gonna make it you're gonna be there because he chose you you didn't choose him amen God's choosing he says it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride John 15 16 ye have not chosen me I have chosen you he says this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself Ephesians 1 and 9 and in Romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose now think about this for a minute the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing what's all this about you you think he's going to let you fail you think he's going to let it come to him his word return unto him void all of this everything his heart purpose was that he would have a bride and he called you and he chose you and he's not going to let his heart purpose fail you're gonna make it you're gonna be there amen he says his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world what is this telling you what is it that this is that this is saying before he created anything before there was even any any Stardust the bride you was already in his mind you were already there and that's where you get your Eternal qualities from how am I Eternal because you were in God before the foundation of the world as a thought which means you are a part of God which means you didn't have a beginning which means you won't have an ending you are an eternal attribute of God hell has a beginning so hell has an end but you never had a beginning and so you will never have an end you were with God before it started you'll be with God after it all ends and through the eternities you will be there because you were with him then amen you never had a beginning you were in the Eternal never-changing thoughts of almighty God and now you are a thought expressed what he thought is now here in flesh once again you are an expressed thought of almighty God what's that mean you have been made manifest in this day you can think about it you can think about building a house but it's just a thought until you build it and then your thoughts are expressed there it is there's what I had in my mind and he looks down in this day at a bride standing on the earth and he says there it is there's what I had in my mind and sometimes we don't think we're very much but I tell you there you are the expressed image of what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world cast down all those complexes of I'm nothing cast down all that I'm never going to be good enough cast down how am I going to make it I say how can you fail how can you not make it you're gonna be there because you are the very thoughts that was in the mind of God and his thoughts are not going to fail his thoughts are not going to return them to him void they are Eternal so what he thought must have eternal life amen you're manifested in this day he says he has never had a new thought about anything that is incredible if he loved you he loves you if he saw you there you're going to be there if he saw you healed you're healed saw you saved you're saved he's never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are e eternal Moses Jeremiah John Peter William Branham you I don't deserve to be listed with a yes you do they were thoughts of God expressed and now you are a thought of God expressed they were thoughts of God manifested and now you are a thought of God manifested brother Brown says now it says that he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that I say thank you Lord I don't want to get away from him I'm thankful that I have an eternal quality about me amen you are just this kind of blows my mind even to say it but you're just as Eternal as God is eternal you're just as Eternal as God is eternal you didn't become a son or daughter of God when you came down to the altar you didn't become a son or daughter of God when you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you always were a son or daughter of God you've always been a child of God what's that mean that means the devil never did on you the devil never did have a claim on you the devil never did have a chance to keep you from making it all those nights of Torment if you're not going to Rapture you're not gonna make it he was just trying to convince you with that because he can't stop the elect seed of God from manifesting what God thought they would be if he thought you'd Rapture you're gonna Rapture he's never had a claim on you he's never had a right to you you always have been a son or daughter of almighty God you never were an outcast you never were a failure come on somebody because he tells you that I know he does sure we've all fallen short like I tell people well I've fallen short and I don't measure up I say get in line because you just described every one of us you're not special I hope that didn't feed into your complex okay but some people want to be special by by Downing themselves so much and I'm this and I'm not no you're not you're just like a human like the rest of us but you're going to make it because you're an expressed thought of almighty God quit putting yourself down quit listening to the devil the word of God says you were there and that you will be there he says and that is exactly what we have been saying these we're talking about you who are the Royal seed or the elect of God are they predestinated foreknown of God and we're in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed so when William Branham came forth he became expressed okay when each messenger from each age came forth they became expressed when ireneas came forth he became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride see we call the people who are his and and all the Believers we call it the body of Christ why why is that why do we say it's the body because she was predestinated in him came from the same source as him and it's just as Eternal with him and now this body is manifesting him on the earth in a many-membered body called The Bride so when we say that we are the body of the lord we mean it literally it is his expressed image once it was Jesus was the expressed image now this is the body that he is expressed in upon the Earth this is how people see him this is how the gospel is spread this is how the sick are healed this is how demons are cast out this is the body that he is using in order to manifest himself in this age it's through you it's through the bride body of our Lord Jesus what's that mean the Eternal logos God was manifested in the Sun so when Jesus dwelt the fullness of the godhead in a body okay so the father was manifested in flesh and being so he gained the title of son why was Jesus the son because the father was manifested in that flesh body do we understand that and so that gave him the title of son when the father manifested himself in a body he was called the son and when he manifest his thoughts today in flesh in a body then we also gain the same title we are Sons the exact same way Jesus says the exact same way you're a son because the father is manifested in your flesh that makes me a son that makes you a daughter the difference being and there is a difference is that all of God was in Jesus all of God was in that one body he was the fullness and we have him in measure in other words we have him in portion Jesus could walk around and he was God I walk around and God is in me do you understand what I'm saying because I have a portion I have a portion of him in me and that's why here's the thing though let's stop for a minute but if we add up all the portions if you add up all the portions of the Bride around then you gain the same fullness that was in Jesus but it's just separated into many different individuals says so we being Eternal in his thoughts in our turn and time those thoughts became manifested in the flesh and just like Jesus we are sons of God and like I said while ago because we're talking about portions of God a portion here and here and here and here and all the way around and then portions all the way around that's why we call it a body because it's the body that God has manifested in on the earth she is born of his bone she is flesh of his flesh she is his body that's very literal what it's saying here when we say we're the body of Christ we mean it is not terminology he says we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn think about that oh I I I I I got the new birth and so I'm elect no you were elect so you got the new birth because we were seed in other words let me put it like this because we were in his thoughts because we were Eternal because we never had a beginning is the reason we could be quickened because in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken there's no life of God in them that's why this message can cross their path and it can Flash in front of them and it doesn't Quicken nothing as a matter of fact they could care less because there's nothing there for it to Quicken but when it comes across the path of a sea Gene of God all of a sudden whoo there's something in there calling me there's something in there speaking to me why because that's their father speaking to them they recognize that voice and they say mama that's me that's me right there they recognize themselves and there's a deep that begins calling to the deep and there's that seed begins to come to life amen I love how it says in our time manifesting the very very Eternal thoughts of God down in each age they would manifest his eternal thoughts and now it's your turn now it's your turn to manifest the thoughts of God for the layout of cnh when he said I will have a bride without spot or wrinkle somebody's got to manifest that when he said that there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a body change there's going to be a marriage supper somebody's going to step into it and manifest that and that's what you have been called to do to manifest the very thoughts of God another way to illustrate this to show that you were always gods and always with God as we talk about redeemed we say I'm redeemed you know I'm redeemed thank God I'm redeemed but what does this mean when it says what is redemption redeem means to buy back redeemings to restore to the original owner so the only way God could redeem you is if God had you first the only way you can ever be redeemed is if you already belong to him he says God by his death the shed Blood Bought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice the word and they follow me you always were a sheep you always worship but see there's the battle and I know each one of you face it because I faced it and I know this is how he attacks people the devil can't make you non-seed but he can try to keep you from recognizing that your seed he can try to keep you from recognizing who you are and he tries to convince you that you're not seed but eventually there comes a time when the voice of the father connects to the soul of the child and it connects to that seed and we become very very aware that that's my father talking to me when you read the message when you hear the message when it's preached you recognize that it's truth because no matter what the devil says that begins to connect and it begins to pull and you recognize that's who I am that's my home he's talking about and sometimes you almost get this strange feeling of of what's the word I'm looking for when you think you've been there before Deja Vu thank you not trying to spiritualize Deja Vu but every now and then when you hear about the Heavenly home and you hear about this and you hear about that and before the attorney and you almost get this strange feeling of just for a second you can almost see it just for a second you feel it just for a second you and the holy spirit moves to the place and just for a second like I was there and I want to tell you it's because you were it's because you've been there you've been with him you've been in the eternities and so it pulls you back it draws you back because that's the only place that this eternal see Gene of God will ever have peace will ever have comfort is when it's restored once you'll never have peace here you're not from here you'll never have peace and time you're not a time being this flesh is this flesh is a time being but that seed gene on the inside of you is not a time being and it longs to go back where it came from you begin to realize I was an eagle all along I never was what the devil told me I was brother Branham says a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he's a son look that's why you don't give up on people when they're out there in drugs and they don't even believe and they don't this and then brother Branham says they can go a long time before they recognize because I said that's the battle the devil tries to keep you from recognizing who you are recognizing you're a son and he says you can go a long time before you recognize that you're a son and you begin to believe what they're telling you by they I mean the Devils you begin to believe maybe I am a chicken and You Begin eating on chicken things and doing I almost said chicken wings because it rhymed and doing chicken things and eating chicken things and living like chickens but you can't stay that way forever because you never were a chicken eventually the voice of the one searching for you is gonna he may cry out service after service after service but because you're an eagle you know how it is you've been there you've been there before when all of a sudden you recognize he's talking to me he's talking to me my father's talking and what it is is that eagle flying over that cage and for some of you it may not even be a cage of being lost some of you it may be a cage of sickness it may be a cage of depression it may be a cage of anxiety but that eagle can fly over saying you don't got to stay there pop Eagles here today and he's bringing a deliverance and something begins to connect maybe you hadn't gone all the way maybe you haven't been filled with the Holy Ghost maybe you haven't surrendered and you're starting to wonder am I an eagle or am I a chicken but tonight he's flying over and he's saying you is always an eagle you was always with me and maybe there's a fear inside of you like I don't know I don't if I try to fly what if I fail what if I mess up listen don't worry about it just set your wings one time just begin to Flap one time you were made for this but I've never flown before that's okay that's okay you were made to fly just set your wings one time because he's calling you tonight and he's saying you never were a chicken but you were always with me you've always been with me you are Eternal as I am Eternal and he's called calling you tonight because you're a c Gene of almighty God don't be afraid to respond to the call don't be afraid to fail so many people never try because they're afraid to fail you can't fail you can't fall because you belong to him and he's not going to let you fail adopted and placed and brother Branham Only Just Hits this for a second in this chapter and so we're going to be brief here what is the adoption and what is the placing brother Bradham says there it is Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross and accomplished Redemption bought you back restoring to original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and thereby placed us if you're bought with the price you're placed either that or I can't read that right thereby placed us as Sons he did not make us Sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as Sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh he could not recognize us as sons in other words you couldn't be adopted and placed as long as you were living in sin you couldn't be adopted in place while the devil held you captive okay but you were always a son you were a son all along even though he had to get Negative reports and say your son ain't living right your son ain't doing this your son is he couldn't place you because you were living in sin you were living in flesh okay you couldn't do those things and although you were a captive you were still a son but because you were a son God sent forth his Spirit into your heart whereby you cry Abba Father and being born again which we've covered what the new birth is being filled with the Holy Ghost filled with his spirit filled with his life eternal life you were no more a servant but a son and if a son then you are in heir to all things when am I placed when he puts the robe of the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your life he has accepted your life and he says this is listen Jesus there at the River Jordan what did he say this is my beloved Son he recognized him right there he filled him with the spirit right there and recognized brother branham's clear he didn't make us Sons we were already his sons but he placed as his sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his sons but when you come to the New Birth then he can recognize you and he can place you and adopt you as his sons in other words it's his way of you always were a son but now he can openly Proclaim it this is my son this is one that I have trust in this is listen if adoption's somewhere off in the future then how can we say we have checkbook Authority because the bride has checkbook Authority but as a son you don't get that until you're adopted and placed you don't have the authority of the father until you're adopted in place so if we haven't been adopted we don't have checkbook Authority but under the new birth you have received your adoption hearing the word for the age and we're about to bring this down to a close it says if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age now listen he's putting it very closely with if you're a seed you will accept the message he says now we have been constantly saying now he's going to come back to the evidence of the Holy Ghost that the true evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives this is why brother Tim has made it very clear we're not word rejecters okay because they want to point back to Azusa Pentecost and say well that's just Pentecostal when they say that that's what they're referencing they're not referencing the book of Acts they're referencing the Azusa Street movement of the early 1900s but they were word rejecters they received the gifts but when the word came they said no we don't want that we don't want the ministry of Malachi 4 we just want the gifts brother Brown is making it very clear the true evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is the believer for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives let's make it clear again what we believe here you must receive the word it is the measuring line it is the measuring stick I want to drive this home we believe that with all of our heart that the revealed word of the hour must be accepted it must be accepted we're not built solely on Dynamics because to do that would be just as bad as being solely built on mechanics we believe in the Dynamics and we believe in the mechanics we must receive and believe the message of the hour but just as everything isn't based on experience everything also isn't based on saying I believe the message there's a lot of people that say I believe the message that don't live it that don't ever have an experience that don't never have the power they don't have those things although you must believe the message you must accept the word of the hour but there must be a balance in that what does it say here it says in every single age Bar None it says the very same thing in opening and closing the message to each age so as we've read and we'll continue to read the opening and closing to every age is exactly the same it'll say something like this unto thee messenger of and then it'll name whatever church it's writing a letter to or whatever in your church age it'll say these things saith he and then it'll go into it he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches brother man says notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age in other words what's this mean he's not saying unto the four angels that I'm sending to Leia to see you or unto the four angels that I'm sending to Ephesus he says unto thee Angel there is one Messenger to each age he says only one person relative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church it goes like this Jesus speaks to the messenger the messenger speaks to the church now in so doing it's the true church and the false Church the false Church also will be held responsible for everything that the messenger brought they don't get let off the hook brother Brown says here I've already read that let me let me skip down here and this this goes back to why we say that you must when we've been saying this you must accept the word for our age because in every Church age God speaks to an angel he addresses One messenger he speaks to the church by way of that messenger and so let's just bring it down like this if God is speaking to us by way of the messenger and we reject that message we are directly rejecting what God is saying to us okay it is a direct rejection of what God is saying to us so so if you're going to hear from God in this age or any age it's going to be from a messenger it's gonna be through a message that's how God speaks he directs it there every age to the angel right to the messenger right it's very direct and they're the ones so so when brother Branham says that the evidence of the holy spirit in your life is receiving the word for your age this is where he's getting it from because you can't say you have God in your heart and then reject the very thing that he's saying to you so if you have the Holy Spirit you will receive the message for the day you can't have say that you have the one who wrote the word and spoke the word in your life and then reject the word that he sends on your path listen it's not going to be the only fruit well I believe the message you've got of course there's going to be other fruits of course there's going to be Supernatural of course there's there's going to be experiences and those other things but you will accept the message you will believe the word for your day you will accept the word hearing the word for the for the age and what we're talking about is one messenger and it's a pattern that was set by Paul brother Brown says in every age we have exactly the same pattern we've talked a lot about patterns that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught and like I said we talked about patterns and we see that that Paul was the messenger in his day because we actually see him have confrontations with other Apostles where it is established that Paul alone had the full Revelation for that day and it is imperative brother Branham says that we stay with the messenger and say what he said and in the spirit of how he said it he says they add here or take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the Revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God Paul warned them to say what he said even as Peter did likewise and something he says he says let me read this next quote and I'll come back to it he says oh how important it is to hear the voice of God by way of his Messengers and then say what was has been given to say to the churches and I think it's very important that not only do we say it but we say it in the same spirit and that's one thing I found early in my Ministry I didn't do this I would search and I would find a quote maybe that went along with or as I studied and I would put that in my sermon and use it or whatever and I would always say it exactly word for word what brother Branham said but then one time just in conversation I was asking brother Danny steaming some questions here and there and he said it's always very important before you use a quote to listen to the quote he said because sometimes we'll take that quote and we're reading it and we're fireballing brother Brown I'm said and the way you say it completely changes what's being said he said it may be brother Branham saying a prayer because you can say lots of things and your tone matters and the spirit of the way you say it matters and so it's very important as as ministers or even you in your own study if you find a quote that just really stands out just click on it and play it see how it was delivered see the spirit of it see the tone of it see see the context of it don't just cut that out but read the paragraph before in the paragraph after let it be placed in the spirit in which it was given and we come to our last slide of the night the last thing that he says at the end of every age he that hath an ear he says if you are a Christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age if you are a true seed if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by every word that precedes out of the mouth of God churches we leave here tonight I leave with rejoicing and Thanksgiving in my heart knowing that I have an ear to hear I'm thankful that I have an ear I'm thankful that I am Eternal I'm thankful that he sent a prophet and revealed to us that that before the world even existed you already were when the world ends you will be because you are an eternal seed Gene of God that's why hell can't be Eternal it had a beginning but that's why you can be Eternal is you never did have a beginning young people check your experience by the word live by the word don't don't listen don't think of the word or the message or even the things that Prophet brought as old-fashioned or out of date it's the message for this hour this isn't the message of Ephesus that we believe and follow this isn't the message of Smyrna or pergamism this is the message for laodicea he sent a prophet telling you this is up to date this is what God thinks now so we have to cast down this this human thinking I I used to get so tickled with middle schoolers and I see it even sometimes with my own kids but how quick things come and go like something could be cool a week ago and then one of your friends says it like seven days later it's like oh my goodness you that was so last week that was so four hours ago and things just all of a sudden become uncool because somebody decided it was have you ever thought about that the things that we think is cool and great is because somebody decided it was why do you think they're called influencers they influence what you think that's the whole point of it they don't even hide what they're trying to do and it used to is this big thing oh you got to be careful those commercials they'll influence you and now they're out there going hey I'm trying to influence you go do this this is awesome you will be cool if you do it and we just everything listen that's not how God is God doesn't change if he said it yesterday it's awesome yesterday and it's awesome today and it'll be awesome tomorrow if he loved you yesterday he loves you today and he'll love you tomorrow and you're going to make it because he said that you were part of him that you were called and it didn't change it didn't become uncool this message isn't Uncle it's the word that's going to take you in a rapture so cast down that thinking of of this is old-fashioned or this is outdated and I love what he says right here if you're true seed you will esteem his word above your necessary meat so you won't read something and go oh man why can't we do that oh man I don't understand why I'm not allowed to oh man why is that wrong you'll read his word and go if that's his word that's what I want to be if that's his word it don't matter if I don't that's how I'm going to live because your seed of God and he's coming back for people who are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh how can a member of his body not agree with him you are his body you must be in agreeance you must esteem his word it's not outdated it's what God spoke for this age and I end with this scripture we've already read it though it says and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have been closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand what their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them but praise God tonight he's opened your ears he sent a prophet in this day and because you are his your ears are open to receive can you stand together with me in this Bower heads father I just thank you so much

you that our ears have been opened Lord thank you that when the devil speaks we can cast down his lies and cast down his reasoning because we know we're going to be there we know we've heard the Eagles scream Lord when that eagle flew over the chicken coop and screamed out the other chickens didn't pay no attention to it because that's what they were but the Eagles hear it and they look up and they recognize that's for me and Lord I just want the young people to recognize tonight that if they've been hearing the Eagles scream and they've been recognized as pool upon their life it's just letting them know that that's who they are and that's what they are and it's what they've always been and always will be father thank you for your presence here tonight thank you Lord God for
