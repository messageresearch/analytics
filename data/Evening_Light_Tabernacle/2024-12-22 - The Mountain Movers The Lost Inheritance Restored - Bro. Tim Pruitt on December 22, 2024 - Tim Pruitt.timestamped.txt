[47:51] right upon us where the world is set
[47:55] aside from
[47:57] um from Pagan actually pagan origins way
[48:00] back when a day that um they would
[48:04] celebrate the Su God's birthday and and
[48:08] um you know Constantine made it where
[48:10] that Christians would worship and and
[48:13] celebrate the the Lord's birthday on on
[48:16] the 25th and it's about that same time
[48:19] of year and we know it's not the Lord's
[48:22] birthday Thanksgiving isn't the day that
[48:25] they that they killed turkeys and ate
[48:27] him and had Thanksgiving and Christmas
[48:30] not the day Jesus was born we wasn't
[48:32] told to to to set set aside any day to
[48:35] honor his birth but nevertheless the
[48:38] world has done this and we as Christians
[48:42] uh Shining Light in the time of Darkness
[48:44] we hold forth the fact that God did send
[48:48] the gift into the world and because of
[48:51] that we do not celebrate as they do with
[48:54] drunken ories and given gifts that would
[48:56] dishonor him but we honor him by
[49:00] worshiping him even as we share with
[49:02] others expressions of love in the form
[49:05] of gifts and and and other ways
[49:08] greetings um you know we do that so you
[49:12] know it's it's so what we do as
[49:14] Christians is trying to shine forth the
[49:16] Light of Christ we know we're not coming
[49:19] with you know Santa Clauses and and
[49:21] whatever because that has nothing to do
[49:23] with it we're coming together with just
[49:26] one one thing in mind we are Christians
[49:30] and we love the Lord and we want to
[49:32] honor him may your life always honor him
[49:35] in everything we do amen we'll turn to
[49:38] Zechariah 4 and verse 6 brother Josiah
[49:42] is singing about this morning we'll read
[49:44] this a couple of verses and then I will
[49:46] go to Revelation chap 5 and we will read
[49:50] from verse one if you will Zechariah 4
[49:54] and 6 then he answered spake to me
[49:57] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[50:00] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[50:03] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[50:06] of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain
[50:10] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[50:12] plain and he shall bring forth the
[50:14] headstones thereof with shoutings crying
[50:18] Grace Grace unto it then Revelation 5
[50:23] and verse 1 a scripture that is so so
[50:27] relevant to us in the day that we're
[50:29] living as God has has shown the light of
[50:32] of the of his glorious gospel upon it
[50:36] Revelation 5 and verse one and I saw in
[50:40] the right hand of him that sat on the
[50:41] throne a book written within and on the
[50:43] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[50:47] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[50:49] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[50:52] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[50:55] no man in heaven nor in Earth neither
[50:58] under the Earth was able to open the
[51:01] book neither to look there on and I wept
[51:04] much because no man was found worthy to
[51:07] open and to read the book neither to
[51:10] look there on and one of the elders said
[51:14] unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the
[51:17] tribe of Judah the root of David hath
[51:19] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[51:22] the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld in
[51:25] loow in the midst of the throne and of
[51:27] the four beast and in the midst of the
[51:29] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[51:32] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[51:34] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[51:37] into all the Earth and he came and took
[51:40] the book out of the right hand of him
[51:42] that sat upon the throne and when he had
[51:46] taken the book The Four beast and four
[51:48] and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[51:51] having every one of them Harps and
[51:53] golden vials full of odors which are the
[51:56] prayer of the Saints and they sung a new
[51:59] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[52:02] book and to open the seals thereof for
[52:05] thou was slain and H has redeemed us to
[52:08] God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[52:11] and tongue and people and nation and has
[52:13] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[52:16] and we shall reign on the earth and I
[52:19] beheld and I heard the voice of many
[52:22] angels round about the throne and the
[52:24] Beast and the elders and the numbers of
[52:26] of them was 10,000 times 10, thousands
[52:30] and thousands of thousands saying with a
[52:32] loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was
[52:35] slain to receive power and riches and
[52:38] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[52:41] and blessings and every creature which
[52:44] is in heaven and on the earth and under
[52:46] the Earth and such as are in the sea all
[52:49] that are in there in that are in them
[52:53] heard I say in blessing and honor and
[52:56] Glory G and power be unto him that sth
[52:59] upon the throne and to the lamb forever
[53:01] and ever and the four Beast said amen
[53:04] and the 4 and2 Elders fell down and
[53:07] worshiped him that liveth forever and
[53:10] ever God bless you can be
[53:16] seated today we're speaking on the Lost
[53:20] inheritance
[53:22] restored and I think of this God's great
[53:25] plan of Redemption how marvelous it is
[53:30] and there just something about this book
[53:33] that was held in the hands of God and
[53:36] this
[53:37] book is not so much a physical thing in
[53:40] the heavens but it's a it's symbolic
[53:45] representing every believer every child
[53:48] of
[53:49] God and there were names that were
[53:52] written in it and Revelation 178 said
[53:55] that these were WR written there before
[53:58] the foundation of the world and it is a
[54:02] book of life and man had lost the title
[54:05] to life because of the sin and
[54:08] Disobedience to God's word we know our
[54:10] first parents Adam and Eve were
[54:13] commanded then that they would have to
[54:15] leave the garden because of sin you see
[54:19] Eden was an extension of Heaven it was
[54:22] Heaven on Earth and sin just cannot
[54:25] abide in heaven and here here is The
[54:28] Impossible Mountain as we're speaking on
[54:30] the mountain movers you know here's the
[54:33] impossible mountain in man's way he
[54:36] could not go up to heaven he was barred
[54:39] out he was banned now from God's
[54:42] presence now you see before the world
[54:45] began before the first word came out of
[54:48] God that would begin
[54:51] creation way back in the eternals God
[54:54] dwelt alone and
[54:57] thoughts and he thought of a family I I
[55:00] as he made his great plans and and sat
[55:04] there as I sometimes Express him as the
[55:07] lonely God sitting alone and by himself
[55:11] there was no light even though he was
[55:13] light yet you know here again there it
[55:17] was all it was just in a place of
[55:20] seemingly
[55:22] nothingless you see before the world
[55:25] began before the the first words he sits
[55:28] there alone with his thought and he's
[55:30] thinking he's thinking of
[55:33] you amen he's thinking of a family that
[55:37] he wouldn't dwell Alone by himself
[55:42] forever and so he desired a
[55:46] counterpart because he wanted of of of
[55:50] wonderful family and every one of his
[55:53] children would of course come from him
[55:57] himself there would not be from somebody
[56:00] else that he would adopt and somebody
[56:03] some stranger's child or some Devil's
[56:05] Child but they would be his own himself
[56:09] and they would be an expression of
[56:12] himself there would be in fact an
[56:14] extension of
[56:16] himself and the Bible tells us this that
[56:19] in Ephesians 4:1 and4 that he chose us
[56:22] in him before the foundation of the
[56:26] world
[56:26] World think about that so there in his
[56:30] great wisdom in his great thinking he he
[56:34] even prepared for them a kingdom that
[56:38] they would inherit and
[56:40] enjoy amen for Matthew 25 and verse 34
[56:44] that he he said that he would say Come
[56:46] Ye blessed of my father inherit the
[56:49] Kingdom prepared for you from the
[56:53] foundation of the world
[56:56] so he prepared a kingdom for you before
[57:01] the world began amen not only that he
[57:05] prepared a body it was all in his great
[57:08] thinking now it had not yet become
[57:11] physical or tangible but he prepared for
[57:13] you a body a body that would be perfect
[57:17] a body without sin without a blemish
[57:20] amen a body that you would dwell in and
[57:23] and he he prepared this he prepared in
[57:26] his great
[57:28] thinking but now in order to do all of
[57:32] that that he wanted to do the eternal
[57:35] spirit you know was who was not yet a
[57:38] father nor yet was he a son and he began
[57:42] to change forms and began to bring
[57:46] forth something we will say an extension
[57:49] of
[57:50] himself and being that a spirit and God
[57:54] is invisible the Bible tells you this
[57:57] that God is invisible and intangible and
[58:01] not only that but God is a spirit and
[58:05] this spirit is invisible and in that
[58:07] form
[58:09] intangible and so he began to move
[58:12] towards his great plan of coming flesh I
[58:16] want to I you know I I want sons and I
[58:19] want daughters I want a family and I
[58:23] want to dwell with them they'll I'll be
[58:26] their God and they'll be my people I'll
[58:29] be their father and they'll be my
[58:32] children and so he began to he began to
[58:36] move toward his great plan of becoming
[58:39] flesh and he become and he move from
[58:43] Spirit into a theophonic
[58:46] form that could appear and disappear uh
[58:50] of theophonic theophany is a visible
[58:53] manifestation of God to humankind so the
[58:56] and so this form called we call
[58:59] theophany would be known in the Greek as
[59:02] logos and in and and we call it the word
[59:07] so again you know here he would move
[59:11] from Spirit to word and so and to put it
[59:15] in terms where mankind could sort of
[59:19] wrap his mind around it and try to
[59:23] comprehend this great God whose being is
[59:27] so great we cannot even begin to imagine
[59:32] or even describe his
[59:35] greatness and so he but yet human terms
[59:39] would be used to describe these events
[59:42] and the those terms are Father and
[59:46] Son now the eternal spirit become a
[59:49] father in the sense that life came from
[59:52] him but it was an extension of his own
[59:55] self
[59:56] it was his own self as he was unfolding
[1:00:01] his great plan and moving toward
[1:00:04] becoming flesh and so we use the human
[1:00:07] term of son to describe that which came
[1:00:10] from him a son again is an expression
[1:00:14] put in terms that we could sort of kind
[1:00:17] of comprehend God and describe now how
[1:00:21] God is changing forms and yet it is not
[1:00:25] another person of God nor is another
[1:00:28] spirit of God but it is the same eternal
[1:00:32] spirit now in another form as brother
[1:00:36] Brandon was told when he met in that
[1:00:38] great rainbow uh colors that come out as
[1:00:42] the spirit of God was expressing himself
[1:00:44] there in Sportsman Hollow and the spirit
[1:00:47] of the Lord came in and said Jesus of
[1:00:50] the New Testament is the Jehovah of the
[1:00:53] old he only changed his mind ask from
[1:00:57] Spirit to man and after eons of Eternity
[1:01:02] where God as the eternal spirit dwell
[1:01:06] alone in Silence with his thoughts he
[1:01:09] spoke and when he spoke he released the
[1:01:14] word now before it was only attributes
[1:01:17] within him it was only genes of himself
[1:01:21] it was only thoughts that that that that
[1:01:24] he had but these thoughts thoughts were
[1:01:27] Eternal amen and and so now he releases
[1:01:31] it and it becomes the word for the for
[1:01:34] the first time God
[1:01:37] spoke and when God spoke you know there
[1:01:41] and you know from him came the
[1:01:47] word and so to begin creation God to in
[1:01:53] order to bring anything into being God
[1:01:56] released from him the
[1:01:58] word and God spoke so we can say as John
[1:02:03] would you know he doesn't talk about the
[1:02:06] births of Jesus being on this wise and
[1:02:08] with his mother Mary da d da that's not
[1:02:11] what he says he goes all the way back in
[1:02:14] the
[1:02:15] eternals and he traces the very
[1:02:18] beginning of Jesus Christ and he says in
[1:02:22] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:02:26] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:02:31] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:02:33] and all things were made by him and
[1:02:36] without him was not anything made that
[1:02:39] was
[1:02:41] made because it would be by the
[1:02:45] word amen by the word that God would
[1:02:50] frame the Earth Hebrews 112 says that he
[1:02:55] through him he made the
[1:02:58] universe that through him the earth was
[1:03:01] formed it is said of him in 1
[1:03:04] Corinthians 8 and6 if you bring that up
[1:03:07] Katie that it speaks of him that there
[1:03:09] is but there is one Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:13] through whom all things came and through
[1:03:15] whom we exist so as we read it here but
[1:03:19] to us and this is the way it is with us
[1:03:22] this morning to us there is but one God
[1:03:27] the Father the
[1:03:30] source amen The Source the Father the
[1:03:35] source right of whom are all things and
[1:03:38] we in him and there's one Lord amen one
[1:03:42] Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things
[1:03:47] and we by
[1:03:50] him so another translation would say it
[1:03:52] this for like this yet for us there is
[1:03:55] is but one God the father from whom all
[1:03:58] things came and for whom we exist and
[1:04:01] there is but one Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:05] through whom all things came and through
[1:04:08] whom we
[1:04:09] exist so according to the Bible the word
[1:04:12] that became flesh in Jesus Christ
[1:04:17] became I that became flesh in Jesus
[1:04:20] Christ created the world he created he
[1:04:24] was started in the small small things
[1:04:26] and like an evolution bringing up plant
[1:04:29] life and animal life and then the man
[1:04:32] which would be the very image of God God
[1:04:35] made Man In His Image he was his he was
[1:04:39] Body Spirit and soul now when he made
[1:04:42] man he made him different from the
[1:04:45] animal life for the animal has no
[1:04:49] soul amen but you see the soul is a we
[1:04:54] could call it a choice chamber
[1:04:56] it's where decisions are made and it was
[1:05:00] made there for God to reside within
[1:05:04] man because he wanted a body through
[1:05:08] which he would operate on the earth amen
[1:05:11] but he wanted that body that human being
[1:05:14] to be
[1:05:17] willing to allow him to do
[1:05:20] that amen so you see there would God
[1:05:24] would operate through that man and he
[1:05:27] would multiply and he would bring forth
[1:05:30] God's
[1:05:32] family Adam came by the way of the
[1:05:35] spoken word a created spirit and a body
[1:05:38] formed by God Adam came from the direct
[1:05:42] from the hand of God created as a spirit
[1:05:47] God created his very human spirit in
[1:05:49] Genesis 1 and then and then God create
[1:05:53] formed a body and put a spirit put that
[1:05:55] spirit in
[1:05:57] it and that was not God's spirit but a
[1:06:01] human spirit because man had a soul and
[1:06:05] that Soul was put there for a purpose it
[1:06:10] was where that God would come and dwell
[1:06:13] within
[1:06:14] man because this is what God wanted he
[1:06:18] he wanted to be in his
[1:06:21] creation and a part of his creation and
[1:06:25] this was God's design and purpose not to
[1:06:29] be an external God but to be an internal
[1:06:33] God for he says in 2 Corinthians 6:16
[1:06:38] you are the Temple of the Living God as
[1:06:42] God said I will dwell in them and walk
[1:06:45] in them and I will be their God and they
[1:06:48] will be my people so this is God's plan
[1:06:53] this is what God want you say does God
[1:06:56] want of me this morning for you to be
[1:06:59] his
[1:07:00] Temple amen but it has to be a holy
[1:07:03] Temple it cannot be a defiled Temple it
[1:07:07] must be a purged
[1:07:08] Temple a body prepared by God to dwell
[1:07:14] in so before God could come and live in
[1:07:19] Adam's Temple you see Adam sold himself
[1:07:25] and when when he did he sold all his
[1:07:27] offspring to sin and to sin's Nature's
[1:07:31] Rule and he lost
[1:07:34] Heaven he lost the kingdom he lost his
[1:07:39] sunship and when you see Adam chose or
[1:07:43] when Eve fell to the Temptation Of The
[1:07:45] Serpent he chose for his serpent uh for
[1:07:49] his children rather to come through sex
[1:07:52] desire as animals and the instead of
[1:07:55] God's way of the spoken
[1:07:58] word then every man woman boy and girl
[1:08:03] that is ever born were born in sin
[1:08:06] shaping in iniquity came in here
[1:08:09] speaking lies with sin nature ruling
[1:08:12] their
[1:08:13] lives this would be the condition of
[1:08:16] every sexual born man or
[1:08:19] woman because every sexual birth
[1:08:23] produces Mortals that will
[1:08:26] die and only a New Birth by the spoken
[1:08:31] word produces
[1:08:35] Immortals so thus instead of men being
[1:08:39] born now as sons of God and Daughters of
[1:08:41] God they were his enemy sons and
[1:08:46] daughters and his possession to dwell
[1:08:49] in think of that now Satan could not
[1:08:54] create
[1:08:56] so he
[1:08:58] perverted and this perverted form now of
[1:09:02] where that we come in Mortal life to die
[1:09:06] Satan now is the author of that
[1:09:11] death so he's the source
[1:09:15] yeah and so all of us come born in sin
[1:09:20] shap in
[1:09:23] iniquity and his brother Brandon would
[1:09:25] take
[1:09:26] three or four scriptures and put them
[1:09:27] together come to this world speaking
[1:09:32] lies thus the serpent called the devil
[1:09:36] Tabernacles every man woman boy and girl
[1:09:40] from their first moment of
[1:09:44] breath for we were all born like this
[1:09:49] Ephesians
[1:09:50] 4:18 having the understanding
[1:09:53] darkened being alienated from the life
[1:09:56] of God through the ignorance that is in
[1:10:00] them because of the blindness of their
[1:10:02] heart who be in past feeling have given
[1:10:05] themselves over to unto lasciviousness
[1:10:07] to work all uncleanliness and
[1:10:10] greediness and as Colossians 1:22 says
[1:10:14] and you that were sometimes alienated
[1:10:18] and enemies in your mind by Wicked works
[1:10:25] every one of us come in here needing a
[1:10:29] savior every one of us come here needing
[1:10:33] Redemption but he says in Ephesians 2
[1:10:36] and
[1:10:37] you hath he
[1:10:39] quickened hath he made of Life who were
[1:10:42] dead in sins and
[1:10:45] trespasses where in time pass you walked
[1:10:48] according to the court of this world
[1:10:50] according to the prince of the power of
[1:10:52] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:10:54] the children children of Disobedience we
[1:10:57] also had that spirit in
[1:10:59] US amen among whom we also had our
[1:11:02] manner of life our conversation in times
[1:11:05] past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling
[1:11:08] the desires of the Flesh and of the mind
[1:11:10] and were by Nature the children of Wrath
[1:11:14] like everybody
[1:11:17] else oh
[1:11:20] my this is the
[1:11:23] Dilemma we were born
[1:11:27] wrong we came here with the wrong
[1:11:30] birth and because of it it burn B birth
[1:11:33] us into death into sin into sorrow and
[1:11:37] all that sin
[1:11:40] brings you talk about a mountain it's
[1:11:43] the
[1:11:45] mountain and it's immovable by
[1:11:48] man all the theology will not move it
[1:11:51] all the psychology will not remove it
[1:11:53] the only thing that can remove Pro it is
[1:11:55] not by man's might nor by his power
[1:11:59] but the spirit of God there's the only
[1:12:03] thing that will move that
[1:12:04] mountain let's look at the next verse
[1:12:06] Katie look at this here but you see here
[1:12:11] it looked all Bleak for a moment
[1:12:15] but but
[1:12:17] God oh my here's something enters into
[1:12:21] the equation here we were in this
[1:12:24] decrepit sinful condition but
[1:12:28] God Amen who is rich in
[1:12:31] Mercy amen for his great love where if
[1:12:35] he loved us amen next verse now amen
[1:12:39] even when we were dead in sins he have
[1:12:43] made us alive together with Christ for
[1:12:47] by
[1:12:48] Grace you are
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:51] saved beautiful amen
[1:12:55] but let me tell
[1:12:56] you let's get it straight originally you
[1:13:01] did not belong to the
[1:13:06] devil Hallelujah in fact he didn't just
[1:13:10] go to seek and save everybody he went to
[1:13:13] seek and save that which were
[1:13:17] lost and because you were his before the
[1:13:21] world
[1:13:22] began he could leave you in a lost
[1:13:25] condition but he come to seek and
[1:13:28] save that which was
[1:13:33] lost he came looking for
[1:13:37] you because I cannot be complete without
[1:13:41] my
[1:13:42] family I'll never have the celebration I
[1:13:45] want there cannot be a marriage supper
[1:13:48] There cannot be heaven without
[1:13:51] you heaven without you will not be
[1:13:54] heaven
[1:13:55] I want my
[1:13:59] people reconciled to
[1:14:02] me they were lost but they needed a
[1:14:07] savior now he knew when he created Adam
[1:14:12] when he put when he put him here he knew
[1:14:16] he put him here with a wheel and a
[1:14:19] choice
[1:14:21] amen had he done it let's say I don't
[1:14:24] know this has a fact but it seems that
[1:14:28] some of the Angels perhaps some of the
[1:14:30] seraphim their only job is just to you
[1:14:34] know wave their wings and say holy holy
[1:14:37] holy to the
[1:14:39] Lord perhaps they were created that way
[1:14:43] and that's all that they can ever
[1:14:45] do but you know God wanted more than
[1:14:49] just something that was
[1:14:53] robotic that was just
[1:14:56] programmed God wanted somebody that
[1:14:59] would willingly choose
[1:15:02] him amen that would accept him that
[1:15:06] would want him that would love him
[1:15:10] back he didn't want to just put love
[1:15:13] upon something and they had no ability
[1:15:15] to love
[1:15:17] back so he gave them
[1:15:20] choices and he put in them a soul a
[1:15:24] choice change
[1:15:25] Amber put within him something
[1:15:29] self-will it's a choice and he knew he
[1:15:34] knew when he did this he knew in his
[1:15:38] great thinking that man would choose the
[1:15:41] wrong and sell himself over to the
[1:15:47] devil so he plann ahead of time to
[1:15:52] redeem
[1:15:53] them amen
[1:15:55] you see he knew they would
[1:15:59] fall and he and he said I I'll make them
[1:16:02] this way and yet they will they will
[1:16:05] have choices not have a choice they will
[1:16:07] have to have there there will have to be
[1:16:10] something that is brought to them where
[1:16:13] where they have to choose between
[1:16:15] knowledge which has evil in it or
[1:16:21] life and I know what they'll
[1:16:23] do they'll choose the
[1:16:32] wrong but he says I know what I'll
[1:16:35] do now this is all in his
[1:16:38] thinking and I wanted you to understand
[1:16:41] this was not a reaction to man's
[1:16:44] sin this was God's plan all the
[1:16:47] time but he couldn't come along and make
[1:16:50] you fall and then then say okay now I
[1:16:53] can show myself a savor and healer and
[1:16:55] deliverer and so make you fall and say
[1:16:58] okay now I'll Pat you up now teach you
[1:17:00] see I'm the big God he'd let you make
[1:17:02] the wrong
[1:17:10] decisions and this was not as I said a
[1:17:14] reaction to man's sin it was a God's
[1:17:17] plan all the time let me read it from
[1:17:18] verse Peter 1:18 for you as you know we
[1:17:22] were not redeemed with corruptible
[1:17:25] things as silver and gold from your vain
[1:17:28] conversation received by tradition from
[1:17:32] your fathers now bear in mind
[1:17:34] conversation always there means your
[1:17:36] manner of life that so let me read it
[1:17:39] this way you are not as you know you
[1:17:40] were not redeemed with corruptible
[1:17:42] things of silver and gold like you were
[1:17:45] you know when you served idols and and
[1:17:48] and worshiped other gods and youve
[1:17:50] received by tradition from your fathers
[1:17:52] but you were bought with the precious
[1:17:56] blood of Christ as a lamb without
[1:17:59] blemish and without spot who verely was
[1:18:04] foreordained from the found before the
[1:18:07] foundation of the world but manifested
[1:18:10] in these last times for
[1:18:12] you so he says here this was for
[1:18:15] ordained of
[1:18:17] God to be the Redeemer yeah and in he in
[1:18:22] Revelation 13 and8 he speak speaks of
[1:18:25] the lamb
[1:18:26] slain from the foundation of the
[1:18:31] world so long before Calvary long before
[1:18:36] the time on the earth there was there
[1:18:39] was God in his great plan and he was the
[1:18:43] lamb slain in his great thinking already
[1:18:48] producing the remedy so let me ask you
[1:18:50] this morning who is first sin or the
[1:18:54] savior
[1:18:57] before sin ever
[1:18:59] came amen the antidote for sin was
[1:19:02] already
[1:19:04] provided it was already in his great
[1:19:07] thinking in his great plan oh yeah I
[1:19:11] know I know they'll choose the wrong
[1:19:13] thing but I'll tell you what I'm going
[1:19:16] to woo them I'm going to chase after
[1:19:18] them my Mercy will overtake them and I
[1:19:21] will call on them time on time again and
[1:19:24] woo them till they just fall in love
[1:19:27] with
[1:19:28] me because that's what I want I want
[1:19:32] somebody to love me as he said to
[1:19:35] Moses I'm not wanting laws I'm not want
[1:19:38] dos and don't I don't want a bunch of
[1:19:40] legalism what I really want is somebody
[1:19:44] to love me with all their heart with all
[1:19:46] their soul with all their
[1:19:48] being that's what I want
[1:19:55] this one who come from the foundation of
[1:19:59] the
[1:20:00] world was to be become the lamb slain he
[1:20:04] was the
[1:20:06] word the eternal spirit so John will
[1:20:11] carry this story on and say the word was
[1:20:16] made flesh and dwelt among
[1:20:19] us and we beheld his glory the glory is
[1:20:22] the only begotten of the father full of
[1:20:25] grace and
[1:20:28] truth and this is what this is what John
[1:20:32] the Apostle said this is what I'm
[1:20:35] seeing I I am seeing the word that was
[1:20:39] in the beginning has now come flesh
[1:20:43] among
[1:20:44] us and we beheld his glory this the
[1:20:48] glory as the only begotten of the father
[1:20:51] full of grace and truth and John bear
[1:20:53] witness of him and cried and said this
[1:20:56] was he of whom I spake that he that
[1:20:58] cometh after me is preferred before me
[1:21:01] for he was before
[1:21:04] me the word the logos that went forth
[1:21:09] out of God he needed a body to do his
[1:21:14] will a body which his will would be done
[1:21:18] on
[1:21:20] Earth it wasn't the death of bulls and
[1:21:23] goats that God
[1:21:25] wanted he wanted a
[1:21:27] body in which his will would be
[1:21:30] perfectly done and so you see there was
[1:21:33] nobody that could do his
[1:21:36] will you know as as the I think it's the
[1:21:40] book of Hebrews it says it's touching
[1:21:42] the law it's concerning the law to just
[1:21:45] offend in one point you're guilty of all
[1:21:49] the rest of
[1:21:51] it so you see you see no matter you
[1:21:54] might have kept this perfectly and done
[1:21:56] that perfectly but just to find one
[1:21:59] little
[1:22:00] flaw you might as well offended in all
[1:22:03] the
[1:22:04] rest because you're guilty you stand
[1:22:08] guilty before
[1:22:10] God so now man was
[1:22:13] worthy so the God who formed Adam Out of
[1:22:18] the Dust of the
[1:22:21] earth through a created blood cell
[1:22:27] formed a body in the dust of Mary's
[1:22:31] Earth and wrapped dust around the blood
[1:22:34] cell that he had
[1:22:36] created and
[1:22:38] Jesus became the prepared body oh yeah
[1:22:43] that the will of God could be done
[1:22:46] completely
[1:22:49] in and thus even bear the sins of men
[1:22:54] many a perfect lamb without blemish no
[1:23:03] fault so Hebrews 10
[1:23:06] and5 says wherefore when he comes into
[1:23:09] the world he said sacrifice and offering
[1:23:12] thou wouldest not I'm not wanting
[1:23:15] endless bulls and goats and little
[1:23:19] little um little Cales and Lambs to be
[1:23:22] slaughtered that's not what I want want
[1:23:25] but a
[1:23:26] body what I want is a body that has been
[1:23:31] prepared for me to dwell
[1:23:34] in really now that's what he wants of
[1:23:37] you but he couldn't get that
[1:23:41] yet
[1:23:42] hello amen he couldn't get that yet
[1:23:46] because none of us could be prepared yet
[1:23:48] for the Holy Spirit was not yet given
[1:23:51] and the blood was not shed yet to purge
[1:23:54] us
[1:23:55] right come on so he says in burnt
[1:23:59] offerings and sacrifices for sin thou
[1:24:02] Hast no pleasure then it said I lo I
[1:24:06] come in the volume of the book is
[1:24:07] written so let me read it again lo I
[1:24:10] come to do thy will oh
[1:24:13] God now this was a very purpose of Jesus
[1:24:17] coming was to fulfill the will of
[1:24:22] God to be the perfect
[1:24:25] man to be the worthy
[1:24:29] lamb so he
[1:24:31] says above when he said sacrifice and
[1:24:34] offering and burn offerings and
[1:24:35] offerings of sin thou would is not
[1:24:37] neither Hast th pleasure and and then he
[1:24:40] explained it which were offered by the
[1:24:42] law then he said lo I come to do thy
[1:24:45] will oh God he taketh away the verse the
[1:24:48] law that he may establish the
[1:24:51] second amen by which will we are
[1:24:54] Sanctified through the offering of the
[1:24:56] blood of Jesus Christ once and for all
[1:25:00] amen so
[1:25:02] now let's look for a moment and let's go
[1:25:06] back in time and let's
[1:25:09] remember Adam didn't do God's
[1:25:15] will let's look at a mighty prophets
[1:25:19] Moses
[1:25:21] Moses oh he would he would be almost
[1:25:25] perfect in so many respects that he
[1:25:28] would his life would reflect Christ in
[1:25:31] as much he said I raise up a prophet
[1:25:33] like unto
[1:25:35] Moses but Moses when it come down in a
[1:25:39] moment in a moment in a fit of rage and
[1:25:43] anger amen he took and he smoked the
[1:25:47] rock instead of speaking The Rock
[1:25:50] therefore glorified
[1:25:52] himself and so Moses didn't do the will
[1:25:56] of God and it kept him out of the
[1:25:58] promised
[1:25:59] land Elijah didn't he would run from the
[1:26:04] face of Jezebel and go places God didn't
[1:26:07] tell him to
[1:26:09] go amen until God would find him and say
[1:26:12] what are you doing here
[1:26:14] Elijah I didn't send you here why are
[1:26:17] you here well he said you know I was
[1:26:21] afraid and you know I I I got in this
[1:26:24] Melancholy situation after the Spirit
[1:26:26] came down upon me and and the power of
[1:26:29] God helped me to kill those 400 priest
[1:26:32] of bail or whatever or whoever it was
[1:26:34] there you know and I I destroyed all of
[1:26:37] them and I ran before ahab's chariots
[1:26:40] and and and led him into the City by the
[1:26:43] power of God and then I heard Jezebel
[1:26:46] was after
[1:26:49] me and God said okay it's all right
[1:26:53] you're tired weary come on home I got a
[1:26:56] chariot ride for
[1:27:00] you but you see man
[1:27:06] couldn't great prophets couldn't our
[1:27:09] first father Adam couldn't do God's will
[1:27:14] we were all born with the same problem
[1:27:18] in
[1:27:21] sin shapen in a
[1:27:26] iniquity looks pretty bad it looks very
[1:27:29] Bleak but here the word comes again and
[1:27:33] says but I'm going to reveal part of my
[1:27:35] plan so in in Isaiah 7:14 he said
[1:27:38] therefore the Lord shall give you a sign
[1:27:42] Behold a virgin shall
[1:27:44] conceive and bear a son and they shall
[1:27:48] call his name
[1:27:51] Emmanuel and that word Emmanuel lit
[1:27:54] means god with
[1:27:56] us hallelujah amen it it would be God
[1:28:01] himself with
[1:28:04] us in a
[1:28:06] child a child would be born a son would
[1:28:09] be given and the rule the rule of
[1:28:13] government would be upon his
[1:28:16] shoulder
[1:28:18] amen and would be a virgin conceiving
[1:28:22] she wouldn't been born of sex ual birth
[1:28:25] like all the rest of
[1:28:27] us he would come in a different way he
[1:28:31] would come by the spoken word you know
[1:28:33] in your second birth you're born by the
[1:28:35] spoken word you said oh brother Tim I
[1:28:38] wish I was hady right's child you know
[1:28:40] where they were born of of the of the
[1:28:42] spoken word let me tell you all of
[1:28:45] us are that are born again are born of
[1:28:49] the spoken word amen you know Peter said
[1:28:53] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:28:57] but of the word of God that liveth and
[1:28:59] abideth forever so you who are born
[1:29:03] again this morning are spoken word
[1:29:06] seed Hallelujah original
[1:29:12] seed so Isaiah would further expound us
[1:29:19] and he would say in Isaiah 9 and6 For
[1:29:22] unto us a child is born
[1:29:25] and as a son is given the government
[1:29:27] shall be upon his shoulders and this is
[1:29:30] what he will be called he will be called
[1:29:34] wonderful he will be called
[1:29:37] counselor he will be called Mighty God
[1:29:42] he will be called Everlasting father he
[1:29:45] will be called Prince of
[1:29:48] Peace these will all be descriptive
[1:29:52] names of this God
[1:29:56] and Matthew Chapter
[1:29:58] 1:18 says now the birth of Jesus Christ
[1:30:02] was on this wise when as his mother Mary
[1:30:05] was spoused to Joseph before they came
[1:30:09] together she was found with child of the
[1:30:13] Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost notice it didn't say God the
[1:30:19] Father it said the Holy Ghost the spirit
[1:30:22] gave birth to a son
[1:30:24] and that's why he's
[1:30:28] father notice she was found with child
[1:30:31] of the Holy Ghost then then Joseph her
[1:30:34] husband being a just man not willing to
[1:30:36] make her a public example was minded to
[1:30:38] put her away privately and while he
[1:30:40] thought on these things behold the angel
[1:30:42] of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream
[1:30:45] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[1:30:49] to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[1:30:53] which is seed in her is
[1:30:57] of the Holy
[1:31:00] Ghost amen now so the eternal spirit
[1:31:06] that we talked about who dwelt alone and
[1:31:08] by himself he needed a body in which to
[1:31:13] accomplish his work because he's the
[1:31:16] invisible God as a spirit and God is a
[1:31:21] spirit and he is the invisible God he's
[1:31:25] untable he's Untouchable he's unseeable
[1:31:28] he's not he's not you know we cannot
[1:31:31] know him by any kind of physical
[1:31:35] contact and God wanted to become one of
[1:31:40] us he wanted to dwell with his
[1:31:44] family so as Hebrews said he needed a
[1:31:49] body to do his
[1:31:52] will and and so his will of course would
[1:31:56] be the lamb slain before the
[1:31:58] foundational world to get us out of the
[1:32:00] decrepit condition that Adam his soul is
[1:32:03] into because we wasn't made for
[1:32:07] sin we were made for heaven we were made
[1:32:11] for heaven to be on earth we were made
[1:32:14] to dwell eternally and we were not made
[1:32:17] to be
[1:32:18] Mortals and even you today are crying
[1:32:22] out for
[1:32:25] mortality everything within us
[1:32:27] chres I want to be
[1:32:30] free free from the chains of
[1:32:33] death that works in my
[1:32:37] members the eternal spirit needed a body
[1:32:40] to dwell in to accomplish his
[1:32:43] work now I want you to get this Jesus
[1:32:48] now is
[1:32:49] created he the body is formed
[1:32:54] in the womb of
[1:32:55] Mary and Jesus I want you to get this
[1:32:59] clear he never preaches a
[1:33:02] sermon he never heals a sick he never
[1:33:06] performs one
[1:33:07] Miracle until he's filled with the
[1:33:13] spirit but because though he was
[1:33:18] formed though he was formed there in the
[1:33:21] womb of Mary and came by this spoken
[1:33:24] he's right back on the basis of Adam in
[1:33:27] the sense that he has a choice to
[1:33:33] make and he can continue walking as a
[1:33:37] man on the earth and have an Earthly
[1:33:39] family and procreate like everybody else
[1:33:43] or he can forfeit the the whole realm of
[1:33:47] sexuality in order to bring forth
[1:33:49] children like un to the father
[1:33:56] so he never preaches a
[1:33:58] sermon until he's filled with the
[1:34:01] spirit he never performs a miracle until
[1:34:06] he's filled with the
[1:34:07] spirit we see he was conceived of the
[1:34:10] spirit and it was for the spirit to
[1:34:13] indwell as I have been saying John 4:24
[1:34:16] says God is a
[1:34:18] spirit and the spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:34:21] fathered a body
[1:34:24] amen Luke 1 and verse 35 and the angel
[1:34:28] said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come
[1:34:32] upon thee and the power of the highest
[1:34:34] shall overshadow thee therefore that
[1:34:36] Holy thing which shall be born of thee
[1:34:39] shall be called The Son of
[1:34:43] God God created the egg and God created
[1:34:48] The Germ and then taken that United
[1:34:51] embryo of the spoken word he by the
[1:34:54] overshadowing of the Holy Spirit placed
[1:34:57] it in a virgin
[1:35:00] womb and Jesus would be the first
[1:35:04] born without sexual
[1:35:08] birth he would be in this the head of a
[1:35:12] new
[1:35:16] race so that's what happened for
[1:35:19] Redemption the Holy Ghost Came Upon Mary
[1:35:21] and she b a son and she called
[1:35:25] Jesus which means Jehovah
[1:35:29] savior Jehovah now this same Jehovah
[1:35:33] that was in the Old Testament would
[1:35:35] become Jesus in the new and but now he
[1:35:39] would come in the capacity of Savior
[1:35:41] here would be his
[1:35:44] purpose the Creator himself I want you
[1:35:47] to get that the creator of all things of
[1:35:51] whom nothing was made but what he made
[1:35:53] it the Creator himself came down and
[1:35:56] became a sacrifice for our
[1:35:58] sins his blood was the blood of God for
[1:36:03] God created the blood cell amen and that
[1:36:07] blood that was shed uh was shed and the
[1:36:10] spirit left him as he died in agony and
[1:36:12] then that same life the Holy Spirit came
[1:36:16] back to dwell the repentant Sinner and
[1:36:19] set him
[1:36:20] free amen that sinner didn't didn't have
[1:36:23] to come back year after year after year
[1:36:25] and sacrifice after sacrifice for now
[1:36:27] there was no
[1:36:28] need amen by one sacrifice once and for
[1:36:33] all has he been set free from the
[1:36:35] Dominion of sin and has received the
[1:36:38] Life of Christ where he reigns in
[1:36:40] victory over sin the World the Flesh and
[1:36:43] the
[1:36:44] devil
[1:36:46] Hallelujah God did it
[1:36:49] all he did it all amen he cried out out
[1:36:53] to a world C World in sin I said I'll
[1:36:57] give you a sign a virgin shall be with
[1:37:00] child a virgin shall conceive and bring
[1:37:03] forth the son and this will be your sign
[1:37:06] it'll be an everlasting sign what she
[1:37:09] brings forth will be nothing less than
[1:37:12] God With
[1:37:14] Us the same God who created the same God
[1:37:18] that walked with the prophets the same
[1:37:21] God that was over Israel in the pillar
[1:37:23] of our that same God would become
[1:37:26] flesh and become God With Us God came
[1:37:31] down in a blood cell not through a man
[1:37:34] but by the Holy Ghost and in that virgin
[1:37:36] womb a tabernacle for the purpose of
[1:37:39] death was built now notice what I said a
[1:37:42] tabernacle for the purpose of
[1:37:45] death because God said I would be the
[1:37:48] lamb slain and he can't do this as God
[1:37:53] so he has to make a
[1:37:55] body and that body has to be willing
[1:37:58] that man has to be
[1:38:00] willing to go do everything all the way
[1:38:03] to
[1:38:05] death leave his beloved disciples leave
[1:38:08] the chance of romance leave the chance
[1:38:11] of of a married life leave the chance of
[1:38:14] having physical
[1:38:15] children but in his death he would see
[1:38:19] his seed and be glorified
[1:38:23] Hallelujah because that's what he said
[1:38:26] in Isaiah 53 said he will see his
[1:38:31] seed amen through his death through his
[1:38:34] dying he would bring forth other
[1:38:37] children that God could dwell
[1:38:42] in I want you to know your purpose you
[1:38:45] say what is my purpose in life brother
[1:38:47] him it is for God to walk and God to
[1:38:50] talk in for you to give your body as a
[1:38:54] Living Sacrifice unto God holy and
[1:38:56] acceptable unto
[1:38:59] him and that seed of the woman came in
[1:39:01] order that he could be bruised to bring
[1:39:03] us salvation the Holy Ghost Came Upon
[1:39:06] Mary and he created within her the womb
[1:39:09] the cell that would multiply and become
[1:39:12] the body of our Lord and that cell would
[1:39:16] multiply and if I could say it this way
[1:39:19] not only that you see the Earth had been
[1:39:22] cursed when when Adam's Body was made it
[1:39:25] was not made of cursed Earth but when
[1:39:28] Adam sin the king of the Earth and the
[1:39:30] Earth was cursed with
[1:39:33] it you know not only out here out of
[1:39:36] vegetation comes thorns and thistles but
[1:39:38] out of the out the Earth of your soil
[1:39:40] comes thorns and
[1:39:45] thistles these creepers will come upon
[1:39:47] on you till you go back into the
[1:39:52] earth now we want you to think of
[1:39:54] this God created in the
[1:39:58] womb a cell that would multiply and he
[1:40:02] wrapped now the Earth's not redeemed the
[1:40:05] Earth's Fallen the Earth's under a
[1:40:08] curse so he wraps cursed Earth around
[1:40:14] it flesh that is
[1:40:18] Mortal amen I want you to think Adam
[1:40:21] came and he had a body and there was no
[1:40:24] mortality in it but here the here Jesus
[1:40:27] comes he's got a body and it has
[1:40:29] mortality in it he can die for the
[1:40:32] purpose of man he can suffer for the
[1:40:35] purpose of man he can be wounded for the
[1:40:37] purpose of man he can bear your
[1:40:39] infirmity and feel your
[1:40:42] sickness and experience what you
[1:40:44] experience and be tempted in every
[1:40:46] manner like you're temp
[1:40:48] it and yet do the will of God
[1:40:59] yes when the Holy G ghost Came Upon Mary
[1:41:03] he created her in a womb that would a
[1:41:05] cell now that would
[1:41:08] multiply and from the food the things
[1:41:10] that Mary ate Here Comes things in a
[1:41:13] body forms around
[1:41:15] now and that cell was
[1:41:19] created and this it was the beginning of
[1:41:21] the creation of God that's who Jesus is
[1:41:24] that Holy One was filled with Holy Blood
[1:41:27] even the blood of God that Tabernacle
[1:41:28] came to birth he grew to may be a man he
[1:41:31] went to the Jordan and there that
[1:41:34] sacrifice was was washed of John in the
[1:41:37] river called Jordan I want you to know
[1:41:40] here he comes obedient as a lamb
[1:41:43] surrendering to the will of the father
[1:41:45] now this was not just done in order to
[1:41:48] be fed all the rest of his days he would
[1:41:51] be doing one thing I have come to do thy
[1:41:55] will oh
[1:41:56] God which is actually what every newborn
[1:42:01] child of God is here
[1:42:07] far now when that acceptable sacrifice
[1:42:11] row out of the water God came and
[1:42:13] indwell him filling him with the spirit
[1:42:16] without measure and when he died and
[1:42:17] shed his blood the perfect life of God
[1:42:20] was liberated to come back upon us the
[1:42:23] The Sinner who would accept Christ as a
[1:42:26] savior think about how striking that is
[1:42:29] I know there's many Christmas messages
[1:42:31] that are being preached across the world
[1:42:33] but I would just say this morning this
[1:42:36] is my Christmas message Jehova born

[1:43:33] power there's nothing in this sign that
[1:43:35] you want or think suitable but it's an
[1:43:37] everlasting sign it's a greatest sign of
[1:43:39] all

[1:43:46] mocked set it not spit upon despised
[1:43:52] rejected hanging naked on a cross while
