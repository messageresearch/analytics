[23:43] on his behalf
[23:44] hold on the ones battling Lord tonight
[23:47] with cancer
[23:48] Lord Jesus our trust is in you but our
[23:52] trust is in the atonement Lord where you
[23:56] not only delivered our souls but you
[23:58] paid a price for our bodies we lay claim
[24:01] to that to that tonight Lord Lord for
[24:04] each one who's suffering though now we
[24:06] turn our attention to you into your word
[24:08] we ask you now Lord Jesus or that you'll
[24:11] give me clarity of thought
[24:13] or do you seen as I've struggled through
[24:15] this Lord Lord how to word it how to go
[24:18] about it Lord I doesn't know how you
[24:19] gave it to me and I pray orders help me
[24:21] now to get out of the way or just help
[24:24] me to move and let your people Lord God
[24:27] hear from you I ask these things Lord
[24:30] and I ask you to or just take these lips
[24:32] and shuttle Lord God where you wouldn't
[24:34] have me to speak and open them Lord in
[24:36] every place Lord that you would have the
[24:38] people to hear granted now I pray father
[24:41] in Jesus precious name
[24:45] amen isn't God good to us isn't his
[24:48] presence wonderful hoping your Bibles
[24:52] with me now if you will to two Psalms
[24:54] chapter 4 and the fifth verse we're
[24:58] gonna read from three different places
[24:59] but they're all pretty short readings
[25:02] where I'm starting Psalms 4 then we'll
[25:04] go to proverbs 3 tonight I only speak to
[25:14] youth in his hands we're speaking on in
[25:19] his hands Psalms chapter 4 and verse 5
[25:24] it says offer the sacrifices of
[25:26] righteousness and put your trust in the
[25:28] Lord there be many that say who will
[25:32] show us any good nor to lift them up the
[25:35] light of thy countenance upon us thou
[25:38] has put gladness in my heart more than
[25:40] in the time that that their corn and
[25:43] their wine increased I will both lay me
[25:45] down in peace and sleep for thou Lord
[25:49] only make us me dwell in safety the
[25:53] focus there in verse 5 was all for the
[25:56] sacrifice of righteousness and put your
[25:58] trust in the Lord
[26:00] proverbs 3 and verse 1 says my son
[26:05] forgetting up my law but let thine heart
[26:07] keep my Commandments for length of days
[26:10] and long life and peace shall they add
[26:12] to thee let not mercy and truth for
[26:15] safety bind them about thy neck write
[26:17] them upon the tablet of thine heart so
[26:20] shalt thou find favor and good
[26:21] understanding in the sight of God and
[26:23] man trust in the Lord with all thine
[26:26] heart and lean not unto thine own
[26:28] understanding in all thy ways
[26:30] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[26:33] path and then finally we're gonna look
[26:36] in John chapter 14 and verse 1 John
[26:40] chapter 14 and verse 1 it says let not
[26:43] your heart be troubled if ever there was
[26:47] a time we needed to hear that this is
[26:48] the time let not your heart be troubled
[26:51] you believe in God believe also in me in
[26:54] my father's house are many mansions
[26:57] if it were not so I would have told you
[26:59] I go to prepare a place for you and if I
[27:02] go and prepare a place for you I will
[27:04] come again and receive you unto myself
[27:06] that where I am there you ye may be also
[27:11] god bless you you may have your seats
[27:14] pray God at His blessing now to the
[27:17] reading of the word I want to read a
[27:18] quote from from the prophet of God right
[27:21] here and he says help us dear God to
[27:23] buckle up tight tonight examine the post
[27:26] and the lintel to see if the blood is
[27:27] there then walk forward to challenge
[27:29] every enemy knowing that our great chief
[27:31] captain the one that met Joshua after
[27:34] crossing the river said I'm the captain
[27:36] of the host of the Lord
[27:37] Oh God Joshua trembled he knew that you
[27:40] were leading and we know tonight the
[27:43] morning star is over us banners are
[27:45] gleaming the color streaming and were
[27:47] bound to win if we trust in him who will
[27:51] not fail us and that's what I want to
[27:53] look at tonight is we're bound to win if
[27:56] we will trust in him who will not fail
[27:59] us listen we're going to go into it more
[28:01] as we go but there's many voices in the
[28:03] land and there's many people and many
[28:04] things prayin for your attention and
[28:06] prayin for your affection and trying to
[28:08] get your eyes on them but I'm telling
[28:10] you there's only one place tonight that
[28:12] you can put your trust there is only one
[28:15] place where you can put your soul where
[28:16] you can put your family and that's in
[28:18] the hands of Almighty God there is a
[28:22] constant theme throughout the scripture
[28:24] and we're going to see some of it
[28:25] tonight as we go that God watches over
[28:28] and cares for and delivers those that
[28:32] will trust in him God wants people to
[28:34] trust in him and he wants you to trust
[28:36] into him with your whole heart not just
[28:38] for small things not just for this or
[28:40] that but he wants you to trust in him
[28:41] for every one of your needs he wants you
[28:44] to trust in him for your family and he
[28:45] wants you to be willing to trust him
[28:47] with your very life if need be he wants
[28:50] to be the very center when you get into
[28:53] trouble and when things aren't going
[28:54] your way he doesn't want you to stop and
[28:56] try to figure out how am I going to get
[28:57] through this he doesn't want you by your
[28:59] own hands to try to work through it he
[29:01] wants you to come to him and say Lord
[29:02] Jesus I'm giving this situation to you
[29:06] putting it in your hands and I'm gonna
[29:07] allow you to work in my life and that's
[29:09] one of the biggest things that we do to
[29:11] hinder God is we get in the way by
[29:13] trying to fix everything ourselves we
[29:15] get in the way by trying to work
[29:16] everything out ourselves
[29:18] and I'm telling you I don't know about
[29:19] you but my record of fixing things and
[29:21] making things okay is not very good I'm
[29:23] like oh four four hundred and eighty
[29:25] seven thousand six hundred and forty two
[29:26] I'm bad at it but I've learned that if
[29:28] I'll get out the way and I'll allow God
[29:30] to work he passed a thousand he's never
[29:32] messed up he's never not fixed the
[29:34] situation he's never not pulled me from
[29:36] the pit that I was in because our God
[29:38] can't fail and therefore I can put my
[29:40] trust in him and I want to be one that
[29:44] always trusts in him I want to do that
[29:47] and yet it's a constant battle many
[29:49] times we say god I trust in you and we
[29:52] say we trust and yet our actions would
[29:54] indicate in the moment in the situation
[29:57] that we do not we hurt brother Timothy
[30:00] not too long ago deal with with
[30:01] committal and and Trust and committal go
[30:05] hand in hand when you trust God then
[30:08] you're willing to commit any situation
[30:10] or any problem into his hand and
[30:12] inability to commit things to God shows
[30:16] a lack of trust and how God's going to
[30:18] work those things out and we show a lack
[30:20] of trust and attract and a lack of
[30:23] committal by always taking things back
[30:25] out of his hands that we said we were
[30:27] committing to him God but I thought you
[30:29] were going to do this and God I asked
[30:30] you to do this and he's in the middle of
[30:32] working it out and we're running up
[30:33] snatching it from and thinking we know
[30:35] better thinking we know the timing of
[30:37] God the problem is that our God is not a
[30:40] time being like we are he is an eternal
[30:42] being however even though he is not a
[30:44] time being he is a God of perfect timing
[30:47] because he understands that we're time
[30:50] beings and we have certain needs and
[30:51] he's never going to show up late he's
[30:53] going to show up right on time if you
[30:55] will stand back and allow him to work
[30:58] but we show a lack of trust when we take
[31:00] it out of his hands and we would try to
[31:02] make all things right on our own or all
[31:05] wrongs right as it were when we try to
[31:07] fix everything about our family
[31:09] ourselves when we try to fix all of our
[31:11] problems ourselves instead of just
[31:13] giving it to God brother Branham would
[31:17] say it like this he would tell you to
[31:18] just let loose
[31:19] he says just let loose and let him do it
[31:23] and just commit it to him the greatest
[31:26] weapon that I know of a Christian today
[31:28] is a committal to God
[31:30] when you can't do nothing about it just
[31:33] commit it to him and God will take care
[31:36] of it just commit it to him he's never
[31:39] failed he's never once come up short
[31:41] he's provided for every need we've ever
[31:43] had from the beginning of time since you
[31:45] were born on this earth he's never
[31:47] failed you he's never left you alone
[31:49] he's not going to leave you in this
[31:50] situation
[31:51] here if you'll just put it in his hands
[31:53] tonight now don't take this tonight to
[31:56] mean that we don't believe in knocking
[31:58] and keep on knocking that's not what
[32:01] we're saying for surely we do believe in
[32:03] knocking and continuing to not but
[32:05] remember there's a major difference
[32:06] between constantly reminding God of your
[32:09] problems instead of reminding him of his
[32:11] promises there's a major difference
[32:13] there we want you to knock and we want
[32:15] you to keep on knocking that's the very
[32:17] essence of comital is that you bring it
[32:19] to God and you lay it at his feet but
[32:21] while we're knocking and while we're
[32:23] there bringing before the Lord we should
[32:25] do it in a way that shows him we trust
[32:27] in him we should do it in a way that
[32:29] shows him that we believe his promises
[32:31] are true and that we believe he's moving
[32:34] on our behalf how do you do this by
[32:36] reminding him of his promises not
[32:38] reminding him of your problems
[32:40] in other words if it you're there
[32:42] praying for the salvation of your
[32:43] children come there and begin to claim
[32:46] the promise as if it's already happened
[32:48] come before the throne saying Lord I
[32:50] committed my children to you and I'm
[32:52] just here today once again to thank you
[32:53] for their salvation I'm here once again
[32:56] to thank you that they're coming back
[32:57] I'm here today Lord once again to thank
[32:59] you for my healing that you said I could
[33:01] have not oh god they're worse off today
[33:03] than they've ever been lord I thought
[33:05] you said you were going to heal and
[33:06] that's not necessarily the kind of
[33:08] knockin we want to do we want to knock
[33:10] and say thank you Jesus your word says
[33:12] they're coming back your word says I'm
[33:14] healed
[33:14] thank you Jesus I'm here to tell you
[33:16] once again that I'm so thankful you're
[33:18] my father I'm so thankful I have all
[33:20] these promises that I'm here to lay
[33:22] claim to all that's mine and that's how
[33:25] we want to knock and that's how we want
[33:26] to be on his hands at all time and you
[33:30] say but you don't understand those
[33:32] circles
[33:32] Sansa's but you said you trusted in God
[33:35] and that's the balance that we have to
[33:39] come to we have to come to the point
[33:41] where we trust him no matter what it is
[33:43] that we're seeing this isn't to tell you
[33:46] to do nothing well I guess God is going
[33:48] to take care of this no just the
[33:50] opposite this is telling you to seek God
[33:53] and absolutely everything you do to seek
[33:56] him with all your heart and commit it to
[33:58] him your whole heart your whole life
[34:00] every decision everything you do lay it
[34:02] at his feet and commit it to him before
[34:04] you do anything seek Him in every
[34:07] decision tonight his hands is the safest
[34:12] place you can put anything his hands is
[34:16] the safest place you can put anything no
[34:19] I know that life can be hard life can be
[34:22] hard harder on some than it is on others
[34:24] some people sometimes it seems like draw
[34:28] a harder a lot as it were and go down a
[34:29] harder road than other people and many
[34:32] times there are many burdens that you
[34:34] may even go through in private that
[34:35] other people may never even know
[34:37] anything about and the burden many times
[34:40] can become so heavy and that weight can
[34:43] become so difficult and you have nobody
[34:45] you feel like you can share it with
[34:47] because you're trying to be strong you
[34:49] you have this many times we have this
[34:51] mentality that as a Christian we're not
[34:53] allowed to show when we're going through
[34:55] hard times we're not allowed to talk to
[34:57] people about or let people know that
[34:59] we're having a battle listen I'm more
[35:01] worried about you if you're not having a
[35:02] battle it's okay to share things with
[35:05] your brothers and sister it's okay to
[35:06] ask for a helping hand it's okay to ask
[35:08] for a prayer it's okay these things are
[35:10] okay but let me tell you even more than
[35:12] that what's the best thing you can do is
[35:14] you can take that burden you can come
[35:15] lay it down at the foot of Jesus he is a
[35:18] friend that sticketh closer than a
[35:19] brother and he's never gonna leave you
[35:21] and he's never gonna forsake you but
[35:23] this weight can become so difficult and
[35:25] the trials can seem so ever overwhelming
[35:28] and many of you may be in that situation
[35:31] even tonight and many people may not
[35:33] even know about it you may find yourself
[35:35] in the midst of the hardest trial of
[35:36] your life and God is asking you tonight
[35:39] will you trust me
[35:41] will you trust me in this situation
[35:44] you're going through will you give me
[35:46] all of it
[35:47] Trust is a great matter of importance to
[35:50] God and yet Trust to us cannot just
[35:53] become a cliche thing so many times
[35:56] we'll just trust the Lord it's one of
[35:58] those statements we say and we say it
[36:00] with good intentions and we say it when
[36:02] we're trying to encourage someone we may
[36:04] throw it around when somebody's in a
[36:05] trial we'll just trust the Lord he knows
[36:07] best just just trust in the Lord and you
[36:09] know all things are gonna work out and
[36:11] we sometimes say it to people when
[36:13] they're anxious or maybe when we're
[36:15] battling fear whether it be fear of the
[36:16] future or fear of tragedy or fear of how
[36:19] I'm gonna pay my bills whatever these
[36:20] fears or anxieties may be just trust the
[36:22] Lord and everything's gonna be okay and
[36:24] although I believe that with all my
[36:25] heart we can't allow it just to become a
[36:27] cliche thing that we just say and not
[36:29] actually even understand what true trust
[36:32] in the Lord is what does it mean to
[36:35] truly trust in God to trust him like
[36:38] Jobe did to where you can say though he
[36:42] slay me yet I'll trust him though he
[36:47] slayed me know if you look at that and
[36:51] you put it into a human mind there's no
[36:53] worse circumstance than being slain
[36:56] that's the end of the road it's over
[36:59] that's the worst possible outcome he
[37:01] could have got from whatever he was
[37:03] asking and he says and yet I'll trust
[37:05] him now how can you get to the point
[37:08] that you can trust in that way to where
[37:10] the one you're asking for help the one
[37:12] you're asking to move the one that
[37:13] you're needing to intercede slays you
[37:16] instead and you say but I trust you
[37:18] still that's the place of trust that we
[37:21] have to get ourselves to though he slay
[37:23] me yet I will trust him listen Jobe
[37:26] suffered greatly and I imagine that he
[37:28] was very deeply hurt by all the things
[37:30] he went through even his friends turned
[37:32] against him even to the point that they
[37:34] tried to come and comfort him and he
[37:36] told him y'all are terrible at this
[37:37] to put it in our English language he
[37:40] said y'all are the worst comforters ever
[37:42] he said y'all done a terrible job
[37:45] alright so he was deeply hurt not only
[37:47] by what went on around him but even his
[37:49] friends coming to and they came to
[37:50] accuse and they came
[37:52] do things they in no way comforted him
[37:54] or lifting him up and I'm sure he was
[37:56] confused by all that had befallen him
[37:58] because he had done all he knew to do to
[38:00] serve God he had known all he he had
[38:03] done all he knew to do he had offered
[38:04] the sacrifices he had prayed he had
[38:06] lived a righteous life to the point that
[38:08] God took note of it so I'm sure he was
[38:11] hurt and not understanding but Jobe was
[38:13] convinced of the wisdom of God even in
[38:17] the midst of great pain and confusion he
[38:20] says in joke 9 and for he is wise and
[38:22] heart and mighty in strength in joke
[38:26] 1213 he says with whom is wisdom and
[38:30] strength he have counsel and
[38:33] understanding job isn't thinking about
[38:35] what he feels in this moment he isn't
[38:37] thinking about what's going on around
[38:39] him in this moment instead Jobe realizes
[38:41] that I must remember the character of
[38:44] God I must remember the character of God
[38:47] who God is and why he can be trusted in
[38:51] this situation God doesn't do anything
[38:53] and in his will that isn't both wise and
[38:56] also loving he doesn't do anything in
[38:59] his will and that he sovereign you have
[39:01] to understand that we don't trust God
[39:03] simply because somebody told us to trust
[39:05] God we trust God because he's God I can
[39:09] put my trust in God tonight because he
[39:11] is God alone it doesn't matter what
[39:13] circumstance I am whether it's a good
[39:15] time or a bad time tonight I'm here to
[39:17] tell you he is God over the situation
[39:19] you're in so we don't trust God because
[39:24] someone tells us - we trust our God
[39:26] because He is God
[39:27] our God is holy tonight our God is
[39:30] awesome tonight our God is righteous
[39:32] tonight he is sovereign and he is wise
[39:34] and because of that not only is he
[39:36] sovereign and wise but he's infinitely
[39:39] loving so if he knows all and he's
[39:41] infinitely loving towards me then I can
[39:44] trust in whatever decision he makes
[39:46] towards me is the right decision
[39:48] whatever situation I see surrounding me
[39:50] I know it's okay I can trust him because
[39:53] he has wisdom and he loves me from the
[39:55] depths of his very heart and I can trust
[39:58] that he does all things and works all
[40:00] things according to my good because of
[40:02] the character of God
[40:06] for us humans though trust can be a
[40:08] battle we as humans are guided by our
[40:12] five senses and because of what we see
[40:16] and what we feel it's often times hard
[40:18] to trust but it wasn't always so in the
[40:23] garden there was no fear and there was
[40:25] no doubt before the fall none of these
[40:27] things ever existed and so they operated
[40:30] from a heavenly realm there there was no
[40:31] sin there had never alive ever been told
[40:34] so in that place in that condition trust
[40:37] came naturally Trust was just what you
[40:40] did they trusted one another they
[40:42] trusted God that the elements that came
[40:44] to to make up the things that we would
[40:47] call distrust or our inability to
[40:50] completely trust someone didn't exist
[40:52] yet because there was no lies and things
[40:55] of that in the garden Adam and Eve
[40:56] operated as it were with the mind of God
[40:59] it was a perfect harmony with how he
[41:02] foresaw his creation and it was good but
[41:06] very early all we're gonna see a choice
[41:08] presented to Eve who are you gonna trust
[41:11] that's actually the question that's
[41:14] presented to Eve that's the choice that
[41:17] she has to make Who am I going to trust
[41:21] Genesis 2:17 but of the tree of the
[41:24] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[41:26] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[41:28] eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
[41:31] this is the Word of God there is no
[41:34] debate he wasn't unclear about it there
[41:36] was no gray area you shall not eat of
[41:39] this tree or you're gonna die Genesis 3
[41:42] and 3 she repeats the Word of God but of
[41:45] the fruit of the tree which is the midst
[41:47] of God let me start over which is in the
[41:49] midst of the garden God has said ye
[41:52] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[41:54] touch it lest ye die she quotes the word
[41:57] to the serpent if she would have stopped
[42:00] right there if she would have anchored
[42:03] right there we wouldn't be in the
[42:05] condition we're dealing with today the
[42:08] world wouldn't be in the condition that
[42:09] it's in today because at this point
[42:11] she's still fortified behind the word at
[42:13] this point that still her testimony at
[42:16] this point she is
[42:17] no wrong but now she's given an option
[42:21] verse 4 and the serpent said unto the
[42:24] woman ye shall not surely die what we
[42:29] see with even the garden now is a
[42:31] struggle that mankind has struggled with
[42:33] from that very day trust who do I trust
[42:39] Who am I gonna listen to which way am I
[42:42] going to go now I can't speak for Eve
[42:45] although I feel like her testimony would
[42:47] be very similar to ours in that has God
[42:51] ever given you reason not to trust him
[42:53] has God ever done anything that caused
[42:56] us to not believe what he says is true
[42:59] but how as many times has this world
[43:01] lied to you how many times has the devil
[43:03] drugged you through the mud and beat you
[43:05] down and beat you around the stump and
[43:06] brought sickness and death and fear and
[43:08] anxiety when it comes down to it for me
[43:11] I can't speak for what you're going to
[43:12] say but I'm telling you tonight I know
[43:13] and whom I'm gonna trust I know who and
[43:16] whom I'm going to believe I know there's
[43:18] only one that offers salvation I know
[43:19] there's only one that offers healing I
[43:21] know there was only one that gave His
[43:23] life to redeem me and to save me from my
[43:25] sins and that's the Lord Jesus Christ so
[43:28] I'm going to put my trust there and if
[43:30] Eve had done the same thing and just
[43:32] walked away she'd have been okay what
[43:35] the serpent presented to Eve was another
[43:37] option what the serpent presented to Eve
[43:40] was another voice he presented to her
[43:42] another way and if she had just stayed
[43:45] right there with the word if she would
[43:46] have just trusted in him she had no
[43:49] reason to doubt Church she had never had
[43:52] a reason to doubt and neither do you
[43:54] have reason to doubt tonight there may
[43:56] be thousands of voices in the land
[43:58] calling for your attention but I'm
[44:00] telling you there's only one true voice
[44:01] there's only one vindicated voice
[44:03] there's only one Word of God and it is
[44:06] always true and it will always be
[44:08] fulfilled in your life if you'll put
[44:10] your trust in it there's only one truth
[44:12] there's only one vindicated voice and
[44:15] we're following it in this day why was
[44:18] there even a question Eve why were you
[44:22] even listening to the serpent talked to
[44:24] you Eve why were you even entertaining
[44:28] these thoughts
[44:30] why don't we even listen to the voices
[44:32] of the world today Eve why are our
[44:37] conversations even on the things going
[44:39] on out there why are we focused on the
[44:42] circumstances all around us
[44:43] why do we allow things that would cause
[44:46] distrust in the word to even come into
[44:48] our thinking why do we even entertain
[44:49] those things cast down imagination to
[44:52] night turn away from those things
[44:54] tonight those things those voices
[44:57] they're all voices but none of them are
[44:58] truth you say well this sounds good and
[45:00] that sounds good well what the serpent
[45:02] told Eve sounded good because it was
[45:03] only one word changed it was mostly
[45:06] truth and he twisted one little word and
[45:08] I'm telling you tonight that the voice
[45:10] is out there tonight all the news and
[45:12] all the things going on in the world
[45:13] they're not there to lift you up they're
[45:15] not there to give you truth but they're
[45:16] there to bring confusion and give you
[45:18] options and give you other voices as to
[45:20] where you have to make a choice what am
[45:21] I going to believe Who am I going to
[45:24] trust just tune those voices out tonight
[45:26] and turn to the one true Living God the
[45:28] only one that you can trust in and go
[45:30] towards him tonight as hard as you can
[45:32] go
[45:35] Eve's decision to put her trust in what
[45:38] the serpent told her versus what the
[45:40] word said broke the trust that had once
[45:45] been so easy the trust between humans
[45:49] because she broke the covenant there
[45:51] between her and her husband and the
[45:53] trust between God and man not that God
[45:55] had given man any reason not to trust
[45:57] him truly not for surely it was man that
[46:00] had gone astray and not God but now
[46:02] because of this man's gonna operate
[46:04] underneath a sin nature and underneath
[46:08] that sin nature it's in the nature of
[46:10] man's flesh to be inquisitive it's in
[46:13] the nature of man's flesh to be
[46:15] skeptical it's in our nature to ask why
[46:19] to look for answers ourselves and try to
[46:22] figure things out to want to fix things
[46:24] that's just in our human nature and many
[46:28] of these traits are the very things
[46:29] that's actually driven man to the top of
[46:32] the tree of knowledge of good and evil a
[46:34] lot of these traits has is actually what
[46:36] has allowed man to accomplish so many
[46:38] things in this world and yet the
[46:41] exact same traits and these exact same
[46:43] characteristics can be very detrimental
[46:46] whenever you're trying to draw not not a
[46:48] god so this is questioning and this
[46:51] asking why and looking for answers
[46:53] although it benefited man here on the
[46:55] earth and their quest for knowledge and
[46:57] their quest for advancement in their
[46:59] quest for medicine and different things
[47:00] when it comes to a Christian and
[47:02] somebody drawing out of God and trying
[47:04] to get close to God these very
[47:05] characteristics actually can hinder you
[47:08] as a human being because they go against
[47:12] trust they're the opposite of trust and
[47:16] sure man has reached great heights here
[47:18] on the earth man has done some pretty
[47:20] amazing things now there's times you
[47:22] look around and you want to know how
[47:23] because we seem so stupid some of the
[47:29] things we do just as the human race you
[47:32] say we're pretty stupid and yet then you
[47:36] look around and you see these things
[47:38] that they've accomplished these Heights
[47:40] that they've reached and these
[47:42] achievements in medicine and and science
[47:44] and Rockets and travel and they've
[47:46] reached many many heights along these
[47:48] things and they've done it through the
[47:51] tree of knowledge they've done it
[47:53] through their mind they've done it
[47:54] through questioning and looking that's
[47:56] how they've done it but in this day
[47:57] there's a people called to go higher
[47:59] than men have ever gone before there's a
[48:01] people called to go beyond this
[48:03] atmosphere they have astronauts and
[48:05] things and they go to the moon we're
[48:06] going well beyond the moon there's a
[48:08] people called to leave this very
[48:09] dimension and go into the heavens and
[48:11] they're not going to do it with man's
[48:13] ability they're going to do it by being
[48:15] able to operate in the heavenly round
[48:17] that Adam what's lost but wants to
[48:19] restore it back by Jesus Christ they're
[48:21] going to do it through faith and they're
[48:22] going to do it by trusting in the Word
[48:24] of God we're going to go so far beyond
[48:27] anything any scientists or any doctors
[48:29] ever come up with it would blow their
[48:31] minds for them to know that things that
[48:33] you know as brother Tim is preach you
[48:35] have a greater knowledge than any
[48:37] earthly knowledge that has ever been
[48:38] here on the earth and it's bestowed by
[48:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ into your
[48:42] hearts into your lives and you have to
[48:44] let go and trust in
[48:52] and yet because of the fall our flesh
[48:57] wars against us our flesh wants to doubt
[49:01] our flesh wants to fear and our flesh
[49:05] wants to question why why that's the
[49:10] battle of the flesh and yet what you
[49:13] must do is take dominion over the flesh
[49:15] and do one of the greatest things that
[49:18] you will ever do as a Christian and that
[49:21] is to trust brother Branham would say so
[49:24] I trust in the Lord amen
[49:26] whatever it is all things work together
[49:29] for good you can you can't lose when you
[49:32] become a Christian you just can't lose
[49:34] just trust in him in whatever the way
[49:38] goes just keep yourselves set - his
[49:40] spirit he will guide you into the
[49:42] harbour it's all it'll all be alright
[49:46] there was some folks that came to him
[49:49] during questions and answers' and wrote
[49:50] a question to him they were trying to
[49:51] sell a house and they told him that we
[49:54] fasted and prayed and fasted and prayed
[49:56] and yet we've got no results we've done
[49:59] this and they said have we done
[50:00] something wrong and here's his answer to
[50:03] them they said have we done something
[50:05] wrong and he says if you're a Christian
[50:07] and trust in the Lord because you surely
[50:10] are or you wouldn't be fasting and
[50:11] praying see so I just commit it to the
[50:14] Lord say now Lord when your time for us
[50:17] to sell it you'll send a buyer that's it
[50:20] committed to the Lord take your hands
[50:22] off of it and go ahead he says and
[50:25] that's the way it is anything as long as
[50:27] you're going to do it if someone talks
[50:29] about you and you talk back about them
[50:32] now listen God can't fight your battle
[50:36] you're fighting it yourself see just let
[50:39] loose and let him do it just commit it
[50:42] to him the greatest weapon that I know
[50:44] of a Christian today is a committal to
[50:47] God when you can't do nothing about it
[50:49] just committed to him and God will take
[50:53] care of it listen he wants to fight your
[50:56] battles for you tonight Church he
[50:58] wants to go to war for you he wants to
[51:00] defeat the enemy for you he wants to
[51:03] take control but brother Brown says here
[51:04] he can't fight your battle as long as
[51:07] you're trying to fight it for yourself
[51:09] you have to step back that's the hardest
[51:12] thing for us to do as humans is to step
[51:14] back to take our hands off and go okay
[51:16] god I'm going to trust you I'm going to
[51:18] allow you to do this for me and sit back
[51:20] and watch him go but I'm telling you
[51:22] it's the easier way to go if you ever
[51:25] want see my God in battle if you ever
[51:27] want see my God going against the enemy
[51:30] you'll love to stand back and say he
[51:32] fights my battles for me he's very
[51:34] impressive when he goes to war he's
[51:36] never once lost the battle brother Brown
[51:38] says he wants to take your battles for
[51:40] you but you must let him do it without
[51:46] trust a relationship will not last Trust
[51:51] is the foundation for any relationship
[51:53] without it the relationship will be
[51:56] shaky and it will eventually fail many
[52:00] times faith and Trust are used
[52:02] interchangeably and yesterday they do
[52:04] work together and they are very similar
[52:06] and matter-of-fact when you when you
[52:08] look at their definitions they're very
[52:10] very close together and yet they're not
[52:13] exactly the same thing to trust is to
[52:18] allow one to have control authority or
[52:23] responsibility over yourself to allow
[52:26] them to have control Authority and
[52:29] responsibility over yourself or over
[52:32] something faith is believing that he can
[52:35] and will move in your situation but
[52:38] Trust is handing him the reins and
[52:40] allowing him to do it
[52:42] Trust is taking your hands off faith is
[52:45] believing he's going to move and this is
[52:47] done and he's already done it but Trust
[52:50] is when he moves totally different from
[52:52] what you anticipated or believed for but
[52:55] you can readily accept the outcome
[52:57] because he is mindful all-knowing and he
[53:00] has more wisdom than I can comprehend
[53:02] Trust is even when it seems your faith
[53:05] came up short or God didn't answer the
[53:08] way that you thought
[53:10] would you say Lord I trust you
[53:13] Lord I had faith for the miracle and I
[53:16] believed in my heart yet God moved in a
[53:18] different way and I trust him because he
[53:21] knows what is best brother Brown says
[53:24] God watches over his word he watches
[53:27] over his people he wants to find
[53:29] somebody that will believe him and put
[53:32] trust in him so God makes it very clear
[53:35] throughout the scripture that he wants a
[53:37] people who will trust in him that when
[53:41] things are at their worst and our things
[53:43] are at their worst and things are at
[53:44] their darkest that your confidence never
[53:46] wavers the question of why doesn't come
[53:49] into your mind the the crying oh God
[53:51] what are you gonna do in those
[53:53] situations he wants to respond to you
[53:55] the same way he spoke to Moses and says
[53:57] why cry to me speak
[53:59] he had told Moses at the very beginning
[54:02] you're going to bring the people here to
[54:04] worship on this mountain and all Moses
[54:07] had to do was trust in those words right
[54:09] there and there had never been anything
[54:11] along the way that would hinder his
[54:12] faith along the journey because God
[54:14] already said you're coming to the other
[54:16] side of the Red Sea you're going to
[54:18] leave Egypt you're going across you're
[54:19] coming back right here and he's already
[54:21] told you you're going to go into rapture
[54:24] he's already told you that you're going
[54:25] to make it he's all you've already been
[54:27] seen on the other side by a prophet who
[54:29] went beyond the curtain of time so I may
[54:31] go through something today I may go
[54:33] through something tomorrow
[54:34] I'm a struggle next week but I'm telling
[54:36] you my trust is in the Lord because I
[54:39] know that I'm gonna make it I know I'm
[54:41] going to be there I know nothing's going
[54:43] to stop me so I can put my trust in the
[54:46] Lord tonight thank you Jesus when you're
[54:52] in those situations and your trust is in
[54:55] God then we don't see the need within
[55:00] ourselves to intervene we can keep our
[55:02] hands off and allow God to continue
[55:04] moving we don't see the need to look for
[55:07] other voices or look for other solutions
[55:10] when it seems like there's no way out he
[55:12] is our way out he wants people who when
[55:16] the enemy comes in like a flood and
[55:17] death is at the door they can leave it
[55:20] in his hands and walk in
[55:22] Pease that's one way you can check and
[55:25] see where you're at when your trust with
[55:27] God is when everything is going on when
[55:29] it seems like there's no answer when it
[55:30] seems like death is at the door is your
[55:33] heart at peace is your heart at peace in
[55:37] trusting God that God however you choose
[55:39] to move I trust in you my heart is at
[55:43] peace in this situation and he wants
[55:45] people to be that way and I want to tell
[55:47] you tonight that you have a God that is
[55:50] worth trusting in you have a God who is
[55:53] that you can believe in you have a God
[55:55] who you can give your burdens to you
[55:57] have a God that you can put your
[55:58] complete faith in your complete trust
[56:00] then he has a track record of 100% he
[56:04] has never once fail and I say that he's
[56:06] worthy of our trust I say that he's done
[56:08] more than enough to earn our trust I say
[56:11] that at this point if we do not trust in
[56:13] him it's a slap in his face because he's
[56:15] done so much he's poured out so much
[56:17] even this generation he's come time and
[56:20] time and time again to show you that my
[56:22] word is true I'll back up what I say if
[56:24] I say I healed and I'm a healer when I
[56:27] say I deliver then I'll deliver he has
[56:29] never once left us here ashamed holding
[56:32] the bag as it were but he's always come
[56:34] through for us he always will come
[56:35] through for us and you can trust in this
[56:38] God tonight Oh church he's worthy of our
[56:43] trust he's worthy of our praise he's
[56:46] never once done anything that would
[56:47] cause us to doubt he's never once done
[56:50] anything that would cause us to wonder
[56:51] if he's going to show up on time so in
[56:54] the midst of pandemics you can trust God
[56:56] in the midst of riots and unrest going
[56:59] on in the world today you can trust God
[57:01] in the midst of hatred but between
[57:03] brothers and this man against that man
[57:05] this nation and that nation you can
[57:07] trust God you can trust God no matter
[57:10] what's going on in the midst of the
[57:12] chaos that the enemy promotes you can
[57:14] trust God in the midst of your sickness
[57:18] you can trust God in the midst of your
[57:22] trial no matter what God is God tonight
[57:29] Church what a time that we're living in
[57:31] what a time it is that we're living
[57:33] never has there been more voices upon
[57:35] the earth never has the circumstances
[57:38] seemed as dire as they seem right now
[57:41] never has the manifestation of evil been
[57:43] so obvious all around us and never has
[57:47] has people giving up their trust and
[57:49] allowed their love to grow cold as they
[57:52] have in this age people have allowed
[57:55] their trust in their love to grow cold
[57:57] and it's because as it says in Matthew
[57:59] 24:12 and because iniquity shall abound
[58:02] the love of many shall wax cold in other
[58:06] words it was so evil around them and
[58:08] there was so much wickedness around them
[58:09] they allowed their circumstances and the
[58:11] evil around them to make them begin to
[58:13] wonder is it real is it true how can
[58:18] this be why would God allow these things
[58:21] to happen look at all this going on in
[58:23] the world and because the iniquity was
[58:25] all around them their love for the truth
[58:27] began to wax cold their eyes got on the
[58:30] iniquity and off of the fact that God
[58:33] had never done one thing to cause them
[58:36] not to love him had never done one thing
[58:38] to cause them not to trust in him and
[58:40] unfortunately you find that even amongst
[58:42] message believers today because they're
[58:47] being shaken by world events not
[58:51] recognizing that the very thing that
[58:53] shaking them is the fulfillment of his
[58:55] word
[58:57] think of that the very thing that's
[59:00] shaking them that should be giving them
[59:02] courage it's shaking them and it's the
[59:05] fulfillment of his word because his word
[59:08] has never failed it and the hour that we
[59:09] are living in is the word of God come to
[59:12] pass think about that for just a minute
[59:15] the hour that you're living in right now
[59:17] is the word of God come to pass it
[59:19] should literally that then you're seeing
[59:21] that is shaken so many people should
[59:23] literally make you believe more now than
[59:25] you've ever believed before in your life
[59:27] it should make you more of a believer
[59:30] every time you see the Word of God come
[59:32] to pass this hour is the word of God
[59:34] coming to pass the evil the nation
[59:36] against nation the love
[59:38] self the hatred of one's fellow man it's
[59:41] exactly what we were told was going to
[59:43] be here it's exactly what we've been
[59:45] expecting all alone and yet people are
[59:47] just marvel my can you believe this is
[59:49] happening it isn't well have you ever
[59:52] read your bottle this is yes I believe
[59:55] this is happening it's what we've known
[59:57] was going to happen all alone this is
[59:59] the fulfillment of God's Word is it not
[1:00:01] shaking you know it's causing me to push
[1:00:03] in more than ever
[1:00:04] it's causing me to believe more than
[1:00:06] ever it's God showing me once again if I
[1:00:08] said it it's going to happen he's
[1:00:10] showing me once again he's trustworthy
[1:00:12] this is his word being fulfilled in our
[1:00:15] very miss giving you the opportunity to
[1:00:17] get ready he's coming soon and he's
[1:00:20] telling you behold I come quickly
[1:00:22] he's giving you opportunity and
[1:00:25] shouldn't be shaken you you should be
[1:00:26] thankful thank you Jesus thank you Lord
[1:00:29] your word coming to pass right before my
[1:00:31] very eyes
[1:00:32] [Applause]
[1:00:37] second Timothy 3:1 this know also that
[1:00:40] in the last day perilous times shall
[1:00:42] come check we're there Daniel 12:1 and
[1:00:49] there shall be a time of trouble such as
[1:00:52] never was since there was a nation even
[1:00:54] to that same time check where two for
[1:00:58] two and there's many more we can go on
[1:01:01] that all the Scriptures you read about
[1:01:03] the end time you're seeing it fulfilled
[1:01:05] around you every single day this is the
[1:01:10] time to trust more than ever to press in
[1:01:13] more than ever these things only
[1:01:15] vindicate his word all the more this
[1:01:19] isn't something that should ever make
[1:01:21] you doubt he told us these things were
[1:01:22] coming and the many times the problem is
[1:01:24] is we're not spiritual about things we
[1:01:26] look at everything through these
[1:01:27] physical eyes but there is a spiritual
[1:01:30] aspect to all the unrest in our world it
[1:01:33] goes much deeper than nation against
[1:01:35] nation and race against race is much
[1:01:37] deeper than that but there are spiritual
[1:01:39] powers at war with themselves to set
[1:01:42] themselves up for power in Satan's
[1:01:44] Kingdom when it's fully manifested these
[1:01:47] anointings flow onto the people and they
[1:01:49] are manifest
[1:01:50] in the physical world but the things
[1:01:52] you've seen you look at and you go
[1:01:53] that's crazy that makes no sense it's
[1:01:54] because those people are under an
[1:01:56] anointing from a spirit that you cannot
[1:01:58] see from a demonic power that's moving
[1:02:00] in this realm and the only thing that
[1:02:04] when you look at this you see you have
[1:02:06] to recognize that the full manifestation
[1:02:09] of Satan incarnate is just behind that
[1:02:11] it's not far away when you see his
[1:02:14] anointing begin to dictate governments
[1:02:16] and you see the things that begin to
[1:02:17] pass and the way they're talking and the
[1:02:18] way people are treating you know that
[1:02:20] that man of sin that is about to be made
[1:02:23] manifest very soon in this realm and
[1:02:25] we're blessed to be able to see with
[1:02:28] eyes that let us know that that's what's
[1:02:29] going home and the only thing holding
[1:02:32] back these powers from a fool and
[1:02:34] complete takeover of the world a full
[1:02:36] outpouring of the plagues in a fool
[1:02:39] ruling of pure satanic chaos is that you
[1:02:43] and I are still here the only thing
[1:02:45] holding those plagues back is that the
[1:02:47] spirit is not fully lifted off of the
[1:02:49] earth yet but it's still here but I'm
[1:02:51] telling you it is lifting it is lifting
[1:02:54] and it won't be loaned and I'm going to
[1:02:55] lift with it
[1:02:56] and once I go they can do what they want
[1:02:58] with this whole world I'm not worrying
[1:03:00] about it because one day I'm coming back
[1:03:02] to it and when I do we'll walk out on
[1:03:04] the ashes of the wicked but that's the
[1:03:06] only thing holding it back right now he
[1:03:08] that letteth will let until he be taken
[1:03:11] out of the way but those spirits are
[1:03:13] pushing in and they're pushing in and
[1:03:15] they're pushing in and the bride of
[1:03:17] Jesus Christ being here on this earth
[1:03:18] you are the only thing holding it back
[1:03:21] well how can you stand there and not be
[1:03:23] afraid because I can trust in him I can
[1:03:26] trust that when he leaves I'm going with
[1:03:28] him he won't leave me here he's taking
[1:03:30] me to the place he said I go to prepare
[1:03:32] a place for you and Lord I trust you I
[1:03:35] believe you I know it's waiting on me
[1:03:38] and I'm coming to see it soon don't I
[1:03:40] trust in you tonight we must be able to
[1:03:48] recognize the spirits operating behind
[1:03:50] the movements in our world and be
[1:03:56] careful what we identify ourselves with
[1:03:58] as Christians
[1:04:00] so quick to swallow down everything the
[1:04:02] media tells us or what the people on
[1:04:05] social media are posting we're so quick
[1:04:08] to pick a side listen I've got one side
[1:04:12] I'm on the side with Jesus Christ I'm on
[1:04:15] the side that wants to see Souls saved
[1:04:16] I'm on the side that wants to see Souls
[1:04:18] delivery I don't have time to pick a
[1:04:20] side between this and Democrat and
[1:04:23] Republican and black and white and those
[1:04:25] things listen there's coming a day when
[1:04:26] we're gonna put our arms around one
[1:04:28] another and we will truly be brothers
[1:04:30] were already brothers here but in that
[1:04:31] Kingdom oh that's gonna be the end of
[1:04:33] strife in that kingdom I won't have to
[1:04:35] pick a side and that Kingdom I won't put
[1:04:37] be put down for my beliefs because we're
[1:04:39] all gonna believe the same thing we're
[1:04:41] going to know that we trusted in the
[1:04:42] king of kings and the Lord of lords will
[1:04:44] walk hand in hand and all this junk
[1:04:46] we're dealing with now will be left
[1:04:47] behind be careful about picking sides
[1:04:49] and getting caught up in and we all do
[1:04:51] sure because there's there's parts of us
[1:04:53] because we were raised here there's
[1:04:55] parts of us that look at our country and
[1:04:56] we're thankful that we were raised in a
[1:04:57] Christian nation we're thankful for the
[1:04:59] opportunities afforded to us by living
[1:05:01] in America and many times we have a love
[1:05:04] of the ideals of what America was
[1:05:05] supposed to be but let me tell you she
[1:05:07] never reached those ideals let me tell
[1:05:10] you she never got there and even as far
[1:05:12] back as when brother Branham was here he
[1:05:14] said she's a million miles away from a
[1:05:15] Christian nation you can look it up
[1:05:17] there's a quote he says I don't even
[1:05:18] pray for her he said why would I when
[1:05:21] she will not repent
[1:05:22] I don't even pray for her why would I
[1:05:26] when she won't repent so listen my
[1:05:28] allegiance is not to the United States
[1:05:29] of America although I'll say again I'm
[1:05:31] very thankful that God allowed me to be
[1:05:33] born in a place with religious freedoms
[1:05:34] and many other freedoms that are being
[1:05:36] stripped away every single day I'm
[1:05:38] thankful for that but today my attention
[1:05:40] has turned to the other Kingdom to the
[1:05:42] other place to the place I'm really from
[1:05:44] in the place I know that I'm going
[1:05:46] because I have a trust in the word of
[1:05:48] Almighty God and hopefully that's your
[1:05:50] kingdom and your kingdom and your
[1:05:51] kingdom - and we will spend eternity
[1:05:54] there if you trust in him so quick to
[1:05:58] pick a side post our opinion about
[1:06:00] things not even recognizing it's all
[1:06:04] being controlled by unseen powers
[1:06:07] spirits operating and it really isn't
[1:06:09] even behind the scenes anymore
[1:06:11] if you'll know the truth absolute
[1:06:13] insanity that seems to be the
[1:06:15] controlling the thinking of minutes not
[1:06:17] even like they're trying to hide it
[1:06:18] anymore it's obvious that God has turned
[1:06:20] them over to a reprobate mind because
[1:06:22] they had no love for the truth and
[1:06:24] they've been turned over to rev a day
[1:06:25] but listen don't even hear those voices
[1:06:27] don't give ear to them sometimes we sit
[1:06:29] there on this - and that's just this and
[1:06:31] that's so listen you listen to a certain
[1:06:33] voice long enough I don't care how crazy
[1:06:34] you think it is you listen to voices
[1:06:36] long enough and those voices begin to
[1:06:38] sound normal alright you began to become
[1:06:40] accustomed to it you begin to come
[1:06:42] climate eyes - those voices don't listen
[1:06:44] to them and don't give them a place in
[1:06:46] your life the world Iran is absolutely
[1:06:49] insane don't hear the voices and do not
[1:06:53] associate yourself with the unrest look
[1:06:57] I can't understand that people are the
[1:06:58] people that are supposed to be believers
[1:07:01] that are so anxious to fix this world
[1:07:08] people who talk about all the prayers
[1:07:10] they're praying that that God will heal
[1:07:11] our nation and fix this world
[1:07:14] why aren't you praying for the Lord
[1:07:16] Jesus to come back quickly why is that
[1:07:19] not the focus of your prayers Lord I
[1:07:22] want you to move in this nation and then
[1:07:24] fix this nation here sure go ahead and
[1:07:26] pray for safety I pray for safety pray
[1:07:28] for grace and pray for mercy while we're
[1:07:30] here but I'm not going to pray for
[1:07:32] things to get better I can't do it I
[1:07:36] would be praying against prophecy I
[1:07:39] would be praying against the very word
[1:07:41] of God if I was going to pray for things
[1:07:44] to get better I would be praying for a
[1:07:46] delay in the return of the Lord and what
[1:07:49] would be my calls for warning to delay
[1:07:52] the return of the Lord why would you
[1:07:55] want to stay here any longer unless you
[1:07:57] knew the return of the Lord would catch
[1:07:58] you in a condition that you aren't ready
[1:08:00] to go and if you're in that condition
[1:08:03] tonight then your prayer should be even
[1:08:05] so Lord Jesus come quickly come Lord
[1:08:08] Jesus to take us home take me out of
[1:08:10] this pest house take me out of this
[1:08:12] filthy world take me away from this
[1:08:14] place I don't belong here
[1:08:15] that's how we've got to be praying is
[1:08:20] this not the time we've waited for are
[1:08:27] these things not all the more reason to
[1:08:29] trust him I sometimes wonder what life
[1:08:35] people are living for I talk to brother
[1:08:38] David one time not long ago I said you
[1:08:39] just can't there's nothing to live for
[1:08:41] in this life anymore there's no future
[1:08:44] here there's nothing to live for if
[1:08:47] we're still here when my kids grow up I
[1:08:49] that's the worst possible thing I can
[1:08:51] think about that we would still be here
[1:08:54] you better be living for that life you
[1:08:56] better be living for the life that's
[1:08:58] eternal you better be living for the one
[1:09:00] that's perfect and without him we're all
[1:09:01] wrongs will be made right that's the
[1:09:03] life you have to be living for tonight
[1:09:05] there's no hope in this life there's no
[1:09:07] future in this life pray to leave this
[1:09:10] world not to stay here why are you
[1:09:13] praying for things to get better here
[1:09:15] that's something that somebody would
[1:09:16] pray who's planning to stay I'm not
[1:09:20] planning to stay here he said I go to
[1:09:22] prepare a place for you I guarantee you
[1:09:25] it's better than the place I'm in now so
[1:09:27] I'm good lord a few let's go ahead and
[1:09:29] come on down tonight and take us to that
[1:09:31] place come quickly come quickly you
[1:09:33] don't got to worry about fixing this
[1:09:35] mess it's a mess anyway just take your
[1:09:37] bride home we're ready to go and we're
[1:09:39] trusting in you tonight Lord Jesus I see
[1:09:45] the conditions that are that are
[1:09:46] described Lord in your word as the
[1:09:48] endtime and lord I I don't want to
[1:09:52] change those conditions that I can have
[1:09:54] a better tomorrow here I want to leave
[1:09:59] sometimes I wonder if we trust when God
[1:10:03] said I go to prepare a place for you do
[1:10:05] you trust that a prophet really went
[1:10:06] beyond the curtain of time do we trust
[1:10:09] that there really is a next life because
[1:10:11] if we do we wouldn't be so readily ready
[1:10:14] to pray to stay in this life and I'm not
[1:10:17] talking about someone on their deathbed
[1:10:19] you know what I'm talking I'm talking
[1:10:20] about the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:22] taking us home in a rapture all these
[1:10:26] voices are trying to cloud out the one
[1:10:27] voice you can trust because Satan is the
[1:10:30] author of chaos and confusion this is
[1:10:33] why you hear all the time I just I just
[1:10:35] don't know what to believe that's the
[1:10:37] purpose of Satan's propaganda to make it
[1:10:40] tour you just don't know what to believe
[1:10:42] what's truth what's not truth there's so
[1:10:43] much this there's so much that this news
[1:10:45] says that that news says this and it's
[1:10:47] all a conglomeration of Lies none of
[1:10:49] it's the truth we've already established
[1:10:51] there is but one truth in it and there's
[1:10:53] his job to make you wonder it's his job
[1:10:55] to make you fear and make you doubt and
[1:10:57] that's the condition that we see our
[1:10:59] world in today confused and upside-down
[1:11:02] they call good evil and they call evil
[1:11:05] good
[1:11:05] they vilify those that would protect us
[1:11:08] and they lift up those who would oppose
[1:11:10] them in our nation right now there are
[1:11:13] serious debates going on to dismantle
[1:11:16] the police departments of our nation
[1:11:18] there are serious debates being voted on
[1:11:22] in cities across this country about
[1:11:24] doing away with the rule of law we have
[1:11:28] a society that wants lawlessness and yet
[1:11:35] God is a God of order you see as Satan's
[1:11:39] influence comes more and more the
[1:11:40] lawlessness comes more because it's in
[1:11:42] direct contrast to what God is a God of
[1:11:45] order it struck me so much I was amazed
[1:11:48] as I looked into at Thessalonians and I
[1:11:50] was reading Paul's writings concerning
[1:11:52] the endtime and he says in 2nd
[1:11:54] Thessalonians 2 and 2 he says that you
[1:11:56] be not soon shaken in mind or be
[1:11:58] troubled neither by spirit nor by word
[1:12:00] nor by letter as from us as that day of
[1:12:03] Christ is at hand let no man deceive you
[1:12:05] by any means for that day shall not come
[1:12:08] except there come a falling away first
[1:12:10] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:12:13] of perdition it goes on to say in verse
[1:12:16] 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:12:18] already work only he who now letteth
[1:12:20] will let until he be taken out of the
[1:12:23] way and I found in several of the old
[1:12:25] Greek manuscripts that the word there
[1:12:28] for sin where it speaks of man of sin
[1:12:30] was translated differently and I'm not
[1:12:34] even going to try to pronounce the Greek
[1:12:35] word but I could tell it was different
[1:12:37] than that word said they make the same
[1:12:41] so I began to look and throughout the
[1:12:43] different translations of the Bible and
[1:12:46] what I found was that many of the
[1:12:48] translations used the other Greek word
[1:12:51] that wasn't the same and it reads like
[1:12:55] this I'll start in verse 3 and you can
[1:12:58] follow along if you like but it's gonna
[1:13:00] be a different translation this is the
[1:13:01] NIV it said don't let anyone deceive you
[1:13:04] in any way for that day will not come
[1:13:06] until the rebellion occurs and the man
[1:13:10] of lawlessness is revealed the man
[1:13:13] doomed to destruction he will oppose and
[1:13:16] will exalt himself over everything that
[1:13:19] is called God or his worship so these
[1:13:21] sets himself up in God's temple
[1:13:23] proclaiming himself to be God verse 7
[1:13:26] for the secret power of lawlessness is
[1:13:30] already at work but the one who now
[1:13:33] holds it back will continue to do so
[1:13:35] till he is taken out of the way and then
[1:13:38] the lawless one will be revealed how
[1:13:42] obvious is it that this is the time that
[1:13:45] we're living in now how obvious is it
[1:13:47] that Satan is the author of chaos and
[1:13:49] the author of lawlessness and the author
[1:13:51] of confusion lawlessness confusion chaos
[1:13:55] but there is a truth there is an order
[1:13:59] there is a God who you can trust in
[1:14:01] tonight when all else seems confusion
[1:14:03] when all else is lawless there is still
[1:14:05] a God on the throne there is still one
[1:14:07] you can put your trust in and you don't
[1:14:09] have to fear all this nonsense going on
[1:14:11] around you there is one who said that in
[1:14:14] the time of trouble he will hide us away
[1:14:17] listen don't let the darkness and the
[1:14:19] lawlessness all around you cause your
[1:14:20] love
[1:14:21] to wax cold like those in Matthew did
[1:14:23] don't let them make and begin to get
[1:14:25] your eyes caught up on the iniquity and
[1:14:27] caught up on the lawlessness that's
[1:14:28] going around but press into God tonight
[1:14:31] more than ever hears the voice of the
[1:14:33] bridegroom tonight it's the only voice
[1:14:35] that matters in this age is the only
[1:14:37] voice that has never lied to you
[1:14:39] that is never deceived you that has
[1:14:41] never failed and it's the only voice
[1:14:43] that has never lets you down don't be
[1:14:45] dismayed when you see these things going
[1:14:47] on around us don't be dismayed when you
[1:14:50] see these things coming to pass these
[1:14:52] are the things that let you know his
[1:14:54] word is the truth because he's foretold
[1:14:57] of these things these make me trust God
[1:14:59] more than ever these make me look at his
[1:15:02] word and go it's absolutely the truth
[1:15:04] everything he foretold is now upon us
[1:15:07] listen you want to trust God more feed
[1:15:10] on his word more you want to trust God
[1:15:12] more talk to him more you want to trust
[1:15:15] God more feet less on the millions of
[1:15:17] voices out there that are constantly
[1:15:19] running their mouth trying to get your
[1:15:20] here put your trust and your feeding
[1:15:22] right here in the Word of God these
[1:15:25] things around me don't shake me these
[1:15:27] things around me don't dismay me brother
[1:15:29] Johnny these are things we knew was
[1:15:30] coming all alone we saw it coming all
[1:15:33] alone because his word told us that it
[1:15:35] wasn't because we trust in his word then
[1:15:37] we can stand fast in this time we can
[1:15:39] stand fast in the darkness we don't have
[1:15:42] to worry and we don't have to fear you
[1:15:44] say these things make you happy no no I
[1:15:46] don't embrace the sin and lawlessness
[1:15:49] that's going on but I embrace where I'm
[1:15:51] at in time I embrace where I'm at in the
[1:15:55] Word of God and what I see being
[1:15:56] fulfilled I embrace that these things
[1:15:58] must be I don't like what I see but
[1:16:02] there's something inside of me that
[1:16:04] rejoices seeing these things because I
[1:16:06] know the fulfillment of these things
[1:16:08] brings on the fulfillment of the next
[1:16:11] thing the fulfillment of these things
[1:16:14] brings on the fulfillment of the next
[1:16:16] thing and when I see these things I know
[1:16:18] we're almost home when I see these
[1:16:21] things going on around me I know it
[1:16:23] won't be long now I know it's just over
[1:16:25] the corner over in the next here
[1:16:27] I look and I see victory I know we're
[1:16:29] almost there I know we're about to break
[1:16:31] through because these things are going
[1:16:33] around me something inside of me is
[1:16:34] getting excited something inside of me
[1:16:36] is longing for a home more than ever
[1:16:38] before something inside of me says come
[1:16:40] Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus Luke 21:25
[1:16:43] says and there shall be signs in the Sun
[1:16:45] and in the moon and in the Stars and
[1:16:47] upon the earth distress of Nations with
[1:16:49] perplexity and the sea and the waves
[1:16:51] roaring men's heart failing for fear and
[1:16:54] for looking after those things which are
[1:16:56] coming on the earth for the powers of
[1:16:58] heaven shall be shaken and then shall
[1:17:00] they see the Son of man coming in a
[1:17:02] cloud with power and great glory and
[1:17:04] when these things begin to come to pass
[1:17:06] then look up and lift up your heads for
[1:17:10] your Redemption draweth nah that's why
[1:17:13] these things excite me that's why I can
[1:17:15] stand firm in the midst of chaos because
[1:17:17] I know the fulfillment of this brings on
[1:17:19] the fulfillment of that brother Branham
[1:17:24] said brothers the time has come we're in
[1:17:27] the last day we're in the Atomic Age the
[1:17:30] time has come that they got a weapon
[1:17:32] that can shake this world from its orbit
[1:17:34] in five minutes time into the Sun and
[1:17:36] cause a total annihilation they couldn't
[1:17:39] have done that before but the time has
[1:17:41] come amen the time has come where
[1:17:43] there's a following away the Bible said
[1:17:45] it's if there come a falling away the
[1:17:47] man of sin won't reveal himself the
[1:17:49] Pentecostal church is living in the
[1:17:51] final of all times the time has come the
[1:17:54] time has come for the signs to follow
[1:17:56] the believers and I believe that we're
[1:17:58] at the end time we're in the latter rain
[1:18:00] we're at the time when the men will be
[1:18:02] heady and high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:18:04] more than lovers of God trucebreakers
[1:18:06] false accusers incontinent despisers of
[1:18:09] those that are good heady and
[1:18:11] high-minded but time has come when
[1:18:13] they're teaching doctrines of devils
[1:18:14] perverting the Bible's teaching in
[1:18:16] theories and theologies to draw groups
[1:18:19] of people away to them the time has come
[1:18:22] that God will gather his church together
[1:18:23] through through under one great big
[1:18:26] banner of the Lord Jesus Christ and pour
[1:18:28] out his powers among them great signs
[1:18:30] and wonders will take place the time has
[1:18:33] come the time has come for the
[1:18:34] Pentecostal church to make
[1:18:37] the time has come to circumcise the
[1:18:39] church and call out this foolishness the
[1:18:41] time has come to go back to the old
[1:18:43] landmarks the time has come for the
[1:18:45] outpouring the time has come for the
[1:18:47] gathering of the people the time has
[1:18:49] come for Jesus to come the time will be
[1:18:51] here soon
[1:18:52] to give out the rewards brother be
[1:18:54] careful that your crown isn't set on
[1:18:56] someone else's head that tom has come
[1:18:58] we're at the end time if we're ever
[1:19:00] going to do anything brethren we're
[1:19:02] going to have to do it now that time is
[1:19:05] at hand Church the time has come the
[1:19:08] time has come to stand the time has come
[1:19:11] to trust the time has come to overcome
[1:19:13] that time has come for the sons to
[1:19:15] follow them that believe the prophets
[1:19:17] said the time has come
[1:19:20] someone's going to walk in that all
[1:19:30] throughout his word he went to great
[1:19:34] lengths to show that he can be trusted
[1:19:37] in the worst situations there's so many
[1:19:42] scriptures I picked out probably too
[1:19:45] many of them I won't read them all but
[1:19:48] it's all throughout the word may whom
[1:19:50] 1:7 the Lord is good a stronghold in the
[1:19:54] day of trouble and he knoweth them that
[1:19:57] trust in him Isaiah 57 13 when thou
[1:20:02] Christ let that companies deliver thee
[1:20:04] but the wind shall carry them all the
[1:20:07] way vanities shall take them but he that
[1:20:09] putteth his trust in me shall possess
[1:20:11] the land and shall inherit my holy
[1:20:14] mountain Psalms 18 and 30 as for God his
[1:20:18] way is perfect the word of the Lord is
[1:20:20] tried he is a buckler to all those who
[1:20:23] trust in him Psalms 32 and 10 many
[1:20:31] sorrows shall be to the wicked but he
[1:20:33] that trusteth in the Lord mercy shall
[1:20:35] come pass him about Psalms 34 21 evil
[1:20:39] shall slay the wicked and they that hate
[1:20:41] the righteous shall be desolate the Lord
[1:20:43] redeemed the soul of his service and
[1:20:45] none of them that trust
[1:20:47] in him shall be desolate Psalm 34:8 o
[1:20:50] taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:20:53] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[1:20:56] some 44 for thou art my King O God
[1:21:00] command deliverances for Jacob through
[1:21:03] thee what we pushed down our enemies
[1:21:05] through thy name when we tread them
[1:21:07] under that rise up against us for I will
[1:21:09] not trust in my boat neither shall my
[1:21:11] sword save me but thou has saved us from
[1:21:14] our enemies and has put them to shame
[1:21:17] that hated us in God we boast all the
[1:21:20] day long and praise thy name forever
[1:21:22] Sayla something jumped out about that to
[1:21:25] me in verse 7 he says but thou has saved
[1:21:28] us from our enemies and then you go down
[1:21:31] to verse 8 and it says in God we boast
[1:21:34] all the day long David says I'm going to
[1:21:38] testify all day long about what God has
[1:21:41] done for me he says I'm going to testify
[1:21:44] all day look and somebody's got a
[1:21:45] problem with you giving testimonies
[1:21:47] about what God has done for you that's
[1:21:49] okay the Bible says you can testify all
[1:21:52] day long about what you guys know if you
[1:21:55] don't let anybody shut you down or shut
[1:21:57] you up if God's done something for you
[1:21:58] tell it if God's moved in your family
[1:22:01] telling if God's healed you tell it
[1:22:03] proclaim the name of the Lord Jesus and
[1:22:05] boast on him all day long
[1:22:09] sums 118 and 8 it is better to trust in
[1:22:12] the Lord than to put confidence in man
[1:22:14] it is better to trust in the Lord than
[1:22:17] to put confidence in Princes princes
[1:22:20] proverbs 30 and 5 every word of God is
[1:22:24] pure he is a shield unto them that put
[1:22:27] their trust in him say how much did I
[1:22:32] trust him were there how much listen to
[1:22:36] brother Brown if tonight I preached and
[1:22:40] a thousand people got converted or let's
[1:22:43] say a thousand people had died with the
[1:22:46] inspiration of God fifty years ago and
[1:22:48] they rose up tonight and I was dying and
[1:22:52] they said brother Branham don't trust it
[1:22:55] it's false get away from it trust
[1:22:58] something else I'd still say let me
[1:23:01] now believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:03] first something happened in my life if I
[1:23:08] pray tonight for the healing of a
[1:23:10] thousand people and in the morning all
[1:23:12] thousand of them was dead
[1:23:13] tomorrow night I'd be praying for the
[1:23:15] sick just the same with never more moved
[1:23:18] my faith because of this it isn't what
[1:23:21] my results is it isn't it's what God
[1:23:24] Word teaches what makes it true that's
[1:23:27] right God said so that sowed it maybe
[1:23:29] the people didn't have faith maybe it
[1:23:31] was Fault in me
[1:23:32] but it's no fault in God God is truth
[1:23:36] always always truth so we bring it back
[1:23:41] around and I ask you can you trust him
[1:23:44] that much tonight can you put it all in
[1:23:48] his hands tonight there's no safer place
[1:23:51] than in his hands his hands are
[1:23:54] ever-present his hands have a track
[1:23:58] record worthy of trust he has promised
[1:24:02] to deliver them that trust in him he has
[1:24:05] done more than enough to earn our trust
[1:24:09] but you say brother and what can he do
[1:24:11] with my life it's so broken put it in
[1:24:16] his hands what can he do with my
[1:24:19] situation you don't understand I'm so
[1:24:21] ruined put it in his hands what can he
[1:24:26] do for my children they're so far out

[1:24:33] bad I've been hurt by people brother
[1:24:34] Aaron put them in his hands let go of
[1:24:38] the wrongs that have been done to you
[1:24:40] put it in his hands tonight time after
[1:24:43] time the scripture shows his lives that
[1:24:46] look ruined time after time the
[1:24:48] scriptures show us lives that seem lost
[1:24:51] and they become restored and made hold
[1:24:53] in his hands the maniac of Gadara
[1:24:57] I'm sure his wife had given up and I'm
[1:25:00] just thinking in my own mind I can see
[1:25:03] her just bowing her head one day and
[1:25:04] saying God there's nothing I can do
[1:25:09] everybody's come they've even laid hands
[1:25:11] on him they've even tried to chain him
[1:25:13] they've tried to drag
[1:25:14] men with their bare hands the wrong
[1:25:16] hands had been dealing with him but that
[1:25:19] night she bowed her head and she said
[1:25:20] God I put him in your hands and one
[1:25:25] moment in the hands of God one moment in
[1:25:28] that presence changed everything what
[1:25:31] about Mary Magdalene who had so
[1:25:35] oftentimes found herself in the wrong
[1:25:37] hands she was a person who lived an evil
[1:25:40] life and yet she came and put herself
[1:25:44] before the King of Kings in later life
[1:25:46] in his hands
[1:25:47] one moment different about the thief on
[1:25:51] the cross I guarantee you you are not in
[1:25:54] a position worse off than him the very
[1:25:57] moment of death I see his parents
[1:26:02] kneeling down to pray failures in their
[1:26:07] mind he's gonna die and go to a sinners
[1:26:10] hell that's the last they knew they knew
[1:26:15] nothing of his repentance they are gonna
[1:26:18] be shocked on that day when their son's
[1:26:22] there think about that what are we Union
[1:26:28] how'd it happen
[1:26:30] they knelt down and say God we're sorry
[1:26:33] have mercy we put our son into your
[1:26:35] hands they're having no idea that little
[1:26:40] prayer in a moment's time have mercy on
[1:26:43] me remember me today when you come into
[1:26:46] your kingdom when you get it in the
[1:26:48] right hands it's amazing what can happen
[1:26:51] when you put things in his hands it's
[1:26:53] amazing that things that can happen
[1:26:56] maybe you've never allowed yourself to
[1:26:58] be put in his hands all your running all
[1:27:01] your tryin all your fears all your
[1:27:03] failures
[1:27:04] all your wanderings in just one moment
[1:27:08] if you'll put yourself in his hands
[1:27:10] tonight just one moment and trust in him
[1:27:14] you say I struggle to trust that that I
[1:27:17] can be forgiven the sacrifice is enough
[1:27:21] the blood has washed away all your sins
[1:27:24] if you'll just put yourself in his hands
[1:27:26] tonight and trust
[1:27:28] can you trust him tonight when he says
[1:27:30] all that the father have given me shall
[1:27:32] come to me and him that cometh to me I
[1:27:34] will in no wise cast out can you trust
[1:27:37] that he's telling you the truth when he
[1:27:38] offers you that come Island no wise cast
[1:27:42] you out we see situations that seem
[1:27:45] hopeless to man become miracles in his
[1:27:48] hand
[1:27:49] John six five when Jesus lifted up his
[1:27:52] eyes and saw a great company coming to
[1:27:53] him he saith unto Philip whence shall we
[1:27:56] buy bread that these may eat I love this
[1:27:59] next verse he said this to prove him for
[1:28:02] he himself knew what he would do
[1:28:04] oh he already knew what he was about to
[1:28:06] do he knew the miracle Philips answered
[1:28:09] him and said two hundred pennyworth of
[1:28:11] bread is not sufficient for them that
[1:28:13] every one of them should take a little
[1:28:14] one of his disciples Andrew simon Peters
[1:28:17] brother saith unto Him there's a lad
[1:28:19] here which had five barley loaves and
[1:28:21] two small fishes but what are they among
[1:28:24] so many in the lads hands they were
[1:28:27] nothing but when they were placed into
[1:28:31] the Masters hand the one who created the
[1:28:34] barley that made the bread the one who
[1:28:37] created the fish that swam in the sea
[1:28:39] you see he had made those fish he hadn't
[1:28:42] he had created that barley and put it in
[1:28:43] his hands and he begins to break it off
[1:28:45] he begins to break it off I believe
[1:28:47] brother Brown said it was cooked not
[1:28:50] just fish it was cooked fish he began to
[1:28:53] break it off because in his hands what
[1:28:55] seems impossible to you situation you
[1:28:57] can't fathom there's no way out of this
[1:28:59] there's no way these people are going to
[1:29:01] be fed there's no way my bills are going
[1:29:03] to get paid there's no way my children
[1:29:05] are coming back
[1:29:05] I can't recover from the sickness have
[1:29:07] you put it in his hands yet have you put
[1:29:10] it there and watched him and allowed him
[1:29:12] to go to work allowed him to move in
[1:29:15] your situation there's no safer place

[1:29:21] hands and how they not formed the
[1:29:22] mountains have they not formed you from

[1:29:30] your burdens do they not lift your cares
[1:29:33] do they not carry our sorrows has his
[1:29:36] hands not touched you
[1:29:38] cuz his hands not heel Jude has his
[1:29:42] hands not delivered you has his hands
[1:29:46] not stretched wide and been nailed to a
[1:29:47] tree for you and offered you forgiveness

[1:30:21] right I've worked my whole life and I'm
[1:30:24] just not getting anywhere you sound like
[1:30:28] Peter in Luke 5:1 it says and it came to
[1:30:33] pass that as the people pressed upon to
[1:30:35] hear the word of God he stood by the
[1:30:37] lake of Guinness or written and saw two
[1:30:41] ships standing by the lake but the
[1:30:42] fishermen were gone out of them and
[1:30:44] we're washing their nets and he entered
[1:30:46] into one of the ships which was Simons
[1:30:48] and prayed him that he would thrust out
[1:30:50] a little from the land and he sat down
[1:30:52] and taught the people out of the ship
[1:30:54] now when he had left speaking he said
[1:30:57] unto Simon launch out into the deep and
[1:30:59] let down your nets for a draught let
[1:31:02] down your nets for a catch is what he
[1:31:04] says there and Simon answered and said
[1:31:07] unto Him master we've told all night and
[1:31:12] we've taken nothing Jesus I've told my
[1:31:16] whole life and I've come to nothing
[1:31:18] I haven't been successful in anything
[1:31:21] I've tried over and over again I've
[1:31:24] prayed and I've tried and I've done
[1:31:26] nothing Peter saying Lord I'm a
[1:31:31] fisherman I know what I'm doing I fished
[1:31:36] all night there's no fish here Lord I've
[1:31:39] been in the message my whole life I've
