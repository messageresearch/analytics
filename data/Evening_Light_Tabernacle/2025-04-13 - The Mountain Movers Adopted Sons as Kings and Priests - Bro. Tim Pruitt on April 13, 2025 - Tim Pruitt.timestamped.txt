[25:51] need more. Lord, I just pray that my
[25:53] heart would receive it gladly. And Lord,
[25:55] may we not just be hearers, but may we
[25:57] apply it to our lives today, Father.

[51:14] just want to worship you today. We want
[51:17] to lift up the mighty name of Jesus. Oh
[51:20] God, we want to express our love to you.

[51:35] greatly to be praised. We love you

[52:09] Bless your children that have gathered
[52:12] here today, Lord. those across the world
[52:15] that have gathered with us. Oh God,
[52:17] those in their little homes or wherever
[52:20] they are, maybe some sick, unable to
[52:24] come, situations in their lives. Lord, I
[52:28] I pray God that you'll bring healing and
[52:30] deliverance. Lord, I I pray that you
[52:33] just today in a special way go by the
[52:37] different ones that are not able to be
[52:39] here, Lord. Oh God, go to the Peak
[52:42] family and go over there to the Stani
[52:45] family and go over there to the Hollis
[52:48] family and Lord, anybody else, Father,
[52:51] that's out there that ain't able to come
[52:54] to the house of God and those God that
[52:57] are in
[52:58] situations, broken
[53:01] situations, terrible situations where
[53:04] they have no place to
[53:05] worship, Lord, no place they can really
[53:08] call home. I pray that you would just
[53:12] meet their needs today. You'd speak to
[53:14] their hearts, Lord. Your bride around
[53:17] the world, Lord, meet the needs of your
[53:20] people. May today the son of
[53:22] righteousness rise with healing in his
[53:25] wings. Spread forth those mighty wings,
[53:29] oh God. And when he does, every demon
[53:32] flees and Satan's powers are broken and
[53:35] chains fall off. Oh God, because of the
[53:40] triumph of the blood of Christ, I pray
[53:43] in the name of Jesus, meet the needs of
[53:45] your children gathered here this
[53:46] morning. May we enter into this place in
[53:50] a very, very special
[53:52] atmosphere where great things happen to
[53:55] them that believe in Jesus' name.
[53:59] Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. God

[54:03] you. Wow. Isn't it wonderful to be here

[54:15] you, I I think he's wonderful. I know he
[54:18] is. And I believe his people are
[54:20] wonderful. Amen. It's great to be

[54:33] life, well, I'll tell you, you know,
[54:36] it's great that you can recognize it
[54:38] because the Bible said, "They that
[54:40] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[54:42] shall be filled." So, we're just looking
[54:44] for him to fill us up today. We got we
[54:48] got spring camp coming right up on us,

[55:24] want to thank this church for your many
[55:27] years of service and sacrifice to the
[55:29] Lord and given for that meeting. And um
[55:33] we just pray that God will to use use
[55:36] this camp for his glory. So if you'll
[55:40] turn with me this morning to Hebrews
[55:42] chapter 5, I want to read from the fifth
[55:45] verse. If you'll look there with me and
[55:48] we're keeping our theme there of who art
[55:51] thou oh great mountain thou shalt become
[55:54] a plain and the headstone shalt be
[55:57] brought forth with shoutings crying
[55:59] grace grace unto it and today we're
[56:03] going to be speaking about adopted sons
[56:06] as kings and priest amen so Hebrews
[56:11] chapter 5 verse 5 so also Christ glorif
[56:16] glorified him, not himself, to me made
[56:19] an high priest, but he that said unto
[56:23] him, Thou art my son, today have I
[56:27] begotten thee, as he also said also in
[56:31] another place, thou art a priest forever
[56:34] after the order of
[56:37] Melzdc, who in the days of his flesh,
[56:40] when he'd offered up prayers and
[56:42] supplications with strong crying and
[56:45] tears, unto him that was able to save
[56:48] him from death and was heard in that he
[56:52] feared. And though he were a son, yet
[56:55] learned he obedience by the things which
[56:58] he suffered. And being made perfect, he
[57:02] became the author of eternal salvation
[57:05] unto all them that obey him, called of
[57:08] God and high priest after the order of
[57:12] Melzdc. Amen. I'm going to let you be
[57:14] seated, but I would do want you to turn
[57:16] for another scripture reference over to
[57:20] uh Revelation 5 and and uh verse one. We
[57:25] will read from there. Revelation 5 and
[57:28] verse one. And I saw in the right hand
[57:32] of him that sat on the throne a book
[57:34] written within and on the backside
[57:36] sealed with seven seals. And I saw a
[57:39] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[57:41] voice, "Who is worthy to open the book,
[57:43] and to loose the seals thereof? And no
[57:46] man in heaven, nor in earth, neither
[57:49] under the earth was able to open the
[57:51] book, neither to look thereon." And I
[57:53] wept much, because no man was found
[57:55] worthy to open, and to read the book,
[57:57] neither to look thereon. And one of the
[58:00] elders said unto me, "Weep not. Behold,
[58:02] the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root
[58:05] of David, hath prevailed to open the
[58:07] book, and to loose the seven seals
[58:09] thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[58:12] midst of the throne, and of the four
[58:13] beasts, in the midst of the elders to
[58:15] the Lamb, as it had been slain, heaven,
[58:18] seven horns, and seven eyes, which are
[58:21] the seven spirits of God, sent forth
[58:24] into all the earth. And he came and took
[58:27] the book out of the right hand of him
[58:30] that sat upon the throne. And when he
[58:32] had taken the book, the four beasts and
[58:34] four and 20 elders fell down before the
[58:37] lamb, having every one of them harps and
[58:39] golden vials full of odors, which are
[58:43] the prayers of the saints. And they sung
[58:47] a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
[58:50] take the book, and to open the seals
[58:52] thereof. For thou was slain, and hast
[58:54] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[58:57] every kindred and tongue and people and
[58:59] nation, and has made us unto our God,
[59:02] kings and priests, and we shall reign
[59:06] over the earth or on the earth. Amen.
[59:09] God bless you.
[59:11] You know as we are looking at this
[59:14] passage of scripture today this about
[59:18] Melzdc from the book of Hebrews where
[59:21] Paul was saying that Jesus did not
[59:24] glorify himself to make himself a priest
[59:27] but God placed him in the priesthood in
[59:31] the order of
[59:32] Melzdc. And then you see in Revelation
[59:36] chapter 5
[59:38] um this lamb and of course this lamb was
[59:42] representing or symbolizing Christ which
[59:45] is the great kinsman redeemer and so
[59:49] you're seeing Jesus in the priest king
[59:53] office of
[59:55] Melzdc and you can see why it was
[59:57] important for us to know in this last
[1:00:00] day because of the opening of the seven
[1:00:02] seals
[1:00:03] revealing who is this
[1:00:06] Melzdc so that we could see his
[1:00:09] continued work as king priest as brother
[1:00:13] Brandham would conclude even that
[1:00:16] service and said I want to still show
[1:00:18] you he's still the high priest that can
[1:00:20] be touched by the feelings of your
[1:00:23] infirmities and and he began to call
[1:00:25] people out of the audience and and
[1:00:27] minister to them and he said see what
[1:00:30] happened is you touched the high priest.
[1:00:33] So, he's still the high priest that can
[1:00:35] be touched. He's still the mediator that
[1:00:38] can be touched with the feelings of our
[1:00:41] infirmities. And so, in this passage of
[1:00:44] Revelation 5, which we've been through
[1:00:47] many times, but oh, it's so um revalent
[1:00:51] to us in this day. There was a call that
[1:00:54] was for a worthy man, but it just
[1:00:57] couldn't be just any man. It would be a
[1:01:00] have to be a man called in the order of
[1:01:04] Melzdc who was both priest and king. And
[1:01:10] now in the structure of the Old
[1:01:12] Testament, let's just look at that
[1:01:15] briefly that as God dealt with Israel,
[1:01:17] the priesthood was one of the tribe of
[1:01:21] Levi. You see, no one could just decide,
[1:01:24] I'm going to be a priest. Even if he was
[1:01:27] a Hebrew and a bonafideed seed of
[1:01:30] Abraham, only an Israelite of the tribe
[1:01:34] of Levi could be a priest. And and so
[1:01:39] you you'll find in the passage of 2
[1:01:42] Coronicles chapter 26, there was a king
[1:01:45] who was of the lineage of David. And he
[1:01:48] was um actually had been a very godly
[1:01:51] king and a successful king and powerful.
[1:01:55] But when he became strong h you know
[1:01:58] what brought about his demise was pride
[1:02:01] led to his downfall. And he entered in
[1:02:04] the temple of the Lord to burn incense
[1:02:07] on the altar. And that was something
[1:02:10] that was strictly reserved for the
[1:02:13] priests, the sons of Aaron. Not just
[1:02:16] anybody could do this. But he thought
[1:02:18] him being a priest or I'm sorry being a
[1:02:22] king that he could should be able to
[1:02:24] also do the priesthood work because he
[1:02:27] began to with pride lift up in his heart
[1:02:30] and and thought he himself would just
[1:02:33] march right into the temple and do this
[1:02:35] this job. And there was Azeriah the
[1:02:39] priest and there were 80 other
[1:02:41] courageous priests that confronted him
[1:02:43] and tried to stop him. But Uzziah became
[1:02:46] angry and at that moment uh leprosy
[1:02:50] broke out on his forehead and he had to
[1:02:53] live in isolation till the day he died.
[1:02:57] Now this is a vivid reminder of the
[1:03:00] danger of stepping outside of God's
[1:03:03] divine order. You see and and especially
[1:03:07] in worship and in priestly functions.
[1:03:10] but a a priest in the order of
[1:03:12] Melzdc. Of course, they he could be a
[1:03:16] priest and a king. If you remember um
[1:03:20] the first time that Melzdc is mentioned
[1:03:22] after the battle uh where Abraham went
[1:03:25] and and rescued his nephew Lot and and
[1:03:28] and the and and whipped the five kings
[1:03:32] of that day of I think it was Chetelamir
[1:03:35] and different others that had fought
[1:03:37] that he fought and he rescued Lot his
[1:03:40] brother. It was that time that he was
[1:03:43] met by Melzdc who was the king of Salem
[1:03:47] and the priest of the most high God. So
[1:03:49] you see in this in in the lineage of
[1:03:54] Melzdc. It was he could be priest and
[1:03:57] king because this was really not an
[1:04:00] earthly man. This was God in theophonyic
[1:04:04] form coming down revealing himself to
[1:04:07] Abraham. Now, so and of course God in in
[1:04:12] the Melchazdc office, he could be priest
[1:04:15] and king. But in the Aeronic priesthood,
[1:04:19] they were not to be kings because it was
[1:04:21] to come from the line from the lineage
[1:04:24] of Judah. And then on the other hand
[1:04:26] though that you know the priest or the
[1:04:30] had to come of Aaron's lineage because
[1:04:33] it was of the tribe of Levi that the
[1:04:35] priesthood was called and you could not
[1:04:38] mix the two offices. But you see in the
[1:04:41] lineage of Melzdc they could be both
[1:04:44] priest and king. Now, when John looks
[1:04:49] and and he he's hearing this voice
[1:04:51] saying uh when he's crying and weeping
[1:04:54] because no man was found worthy to take
[1:04:58] the book and to loose the seals and to
[1:05:01] redeem man because that was what it was
[1:05:03] representing. The book represented the
[1:05:05] human race and the earth and all that
[1:05:08] belongs to them. And and so no man was
[1:05:12] found worthy. And so there was a call
[1:05:15] had been made of who is that worthy man
[1:05:18] that can do that? And no one was found.
[1:05:21] And so when he steps forth here, he
[1:05:24] hears the voice saying um the lion of
[1:05:28] the tribe of Judah.
[1:05:30] He hath prevailed. So we know first of
[1:05:33] all he is of the tribe of Judah. He's
[1:05:36] the lion. He is the king. Right? So now,
[1:05:40] but on the other hand, when John looked
[1:05:42] to see this lion, he saw instead a lamb.
[1:05:48] You see, and the lamb represented the
[1:05:52] priesthood and the intercessory work
[1:05:54] which he continues. If you read the book
[1:05:57] of revelation even all the way um you
[1:06:01] know through the tribulation if you read
[1:06:04] re you know revelation chapter 7 you
[1:06:07] will also see he continues the lamb
[1:06:10] leads those to the fountains of river of
[1:06:13] living water even at the white throne
[1:06:16] judgment. So you see it goes all the way
[1:06:19] that he continues his great mediator
[1:06:22] work. People want to say today, "Oh,
[1:06:24] well, because the seals are open."
[1:06:27] Remember, they're not open, but by
[1:06:30] symbol form to John, revelation form to
[1:06:32] us, and then there will be a literal
[1:06:35] taking of the book when the bride is
[1:06:37] raptured. So, you know, but he will
[1:06:40] continue in his work as an intercessor,
[1:06:45] as a high priest. you will see him as
[1:06:48] the lamb, you know, leading the um
[1:06:51] Israel, the
[1:06:53] 144,000 and and they're they're
[1:06:56] worshiping the lamb on Mount Si. So, you
[1:07:00] see even in the tribulation, he is still
[1:07:02] lamb. You will see him also doing the
[1:07:05] work of kinsmen um which is in this in
[1:07:10] the tribulation will be the kinsman
[1:07:13] avenger and he will
[1:07:15] avenge all of the wicked deeds that
[1:07:18] Satan and his kingdom has done to the
[1:07:20] children of God and the great and
[1:07:23] her daughters will be judged and even
[1:07:25] Satan will be bound at the end of the
[1:07:28] thousand years and he does this as
[1:07:31] kinsman redeemer.
[1:07:33] And this is his work as priesthood as
[1:07:37] lamb as he continues right on even in
[1:07:41] the tribulation with the wrath of the
[1:07:45] lamb. Amen. The wrath of the lamb being
[1:07:48] poured out upon the earth at the seven
[1:07:51] vials are poured out uh in during the
[1:07:54] tribulation. So you know his
[1:07:56] intercessory works until on the even on
[1:08:00] the other side of the millennium at the
[1:08:02] great white throne judgment where the
[1:08:04] sheep are div are divided from the
[1:08:07] goats. So there will be some that he
[1:08:09] will say enter into life. What is that
[1:08:13] intercessory? So even even now the
[1:08:16] intercessory power the blood is what we
[1:08:20] overcome Satan by. For as the bride
[1:08:24] ascends, Satan is cast down. And the
[1:08:28] Bible said, "And they overcame him by
[1:08:31] the blood of the lamb." So the blood is
[1:08:34] still
[1:08:36] effective for for every one of us all
[1:08:39] the way to the rapture. We need the
[1:08:42] blood. And so they overcame him by the
[1:08:45] blood of the lamb because of on account
[1:08:47] of and by the virtue of it having been
[1:08:50] shed. Had that blood not been shed,
[1:08:53] Satan's accusation would have been
[1:08:57] unanswerable. As as it is, that blood
[1:09:00] today meets every charge that Satan can
[1:09:04] make against us. And as long as we are
[1:09:07] in this fleshly body, you need the
[1:09:10] intercession of the blood of the
[1:09:12] intercessory lamb. Amen. Now, so John
[1:09:16] will hear the the the that the lion of
[1:09:19] the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open
[1:09:22] the book. But when he turns to look, he
[1:09:26] said, "I beheld and lo in the midst of
[1:09:29] the throne and of the four beasts. And
[1:09:31] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[1:09:34] as it had been slain, having seven horns
[1:09:38] representing the seven true Jesus, seven
[1:09:40] eyes of which the which are the seven
[1:09:44] spirits of God sent forth to all the
[1:09:46] earth that would anoint seven messengers
[1:09:48] for seven ages. And when John looked on
[1:09:51] him, it's important to see this that he
[1:09:54] did not see him as a king and
[1:09:57] approaching him as a king before a
[1:10:00] throne of judgment, but he saw a lamb, a
[1:10:04] mediator, an intercessor, and he had
[1:10:07] been slain, punished, and judged as the
[1:10:12] one who had taken his punishment. You
[1:10:15] see, no wonder they could all cry out,
[1:10:18] "He has redeemed us to God by thy blood
[1:10:22] out of every kindred and tongue and
[1:10:24] people and nation, and has made us unto
[1:10:28] our God, kings and priests, and we shall
[1:10:33] reign on the earth." Notice we have been
[1:10:36] we are called to be priests with him.
[1:10:41] Amen. Of course, not in the order of
[1:10:43] Aaron. We could we would have to be an
[1:10:45] Israelite in the tribe of Levi to do
[1:10:48] that. But in the order of
[1:10:50] Melzdc who was both priest and king,
[1:10:55] Revelation 1 and verse 6 says, "And he
[1:10:59] had made us kings and priests unto God
[1:11:03] and his father, and to him be glory and
[1:11:08] dominion forever and ever." Amen.
[1:11:12] Amen. He hath made us. Oh, brother
[1:11:16] Brandon would actually talk about this
[1:11:18] in the church age book. I'm not going to
[1:11:20] read it, but I'm just going to speak
[1:11:23] about it for a minute. He said, "Did you
[1:11:25] catch that? He hath made us. Not man,
[1:11:30] not religion, not your works, not your
[1:11:33] effort." Amen. God did it. Salvation is
[1:11:37] not something you earned. It is the gift
[1:11:41] of God. It is something that heaven
[1:11:44] declared over us. Salvation is of is of
[1:11:47] the Lord. It's not a patchup job. It's a
[1:11:50] complete transformation. He didn't just
[1:11:53] forgive you. He redefined you. Amen. He
[1:11:57] gave you a new identity. He made you
[1:12:00] something that this world cannot
[1:12:02] understand. He made you a new creation.
[1:12:06] Amen. He redeemed us with his blood. He
[1:12:09] bought us with a purpose. And that
[1:12:12] purpose is not to blend in with Babylon,
[1:12:15] but to reign and to minister as kings
[1:12:18] and priests unto our God. That's what
[1:12:22] we've been called
[1:12:23] for. In Romans 5:1 17, it says, "They
[1:12:28] which receive abundance of grace and of
[1:12:31] the gift of righteousness shall reign,
[1:12:34] watch these words, reign in life by one,
[1:12:38] Jesus Christ." Did you notice the word
[1:12:44] rain? Do you realize we're not waiting
[1:12:47] for a crown someday?
[1:12:50] We're wearing spiritual crowns right
[1:12:52] now.
[1:12:54] Come on. You should know that.
[1:12:56] Because in Revelation 4:10, the the
[1:12:58] bride of the old and the new represented
[1:13:00] by 12 uh the the Old Testament, which is
[1:13:04] the the 12 patriarchs, and then the 12
[1:13:07] apostles apostles there. The so the
[1:13:10] bride of the Old and the New Testament
[1:13:12] are represented there. And the four and
[1:13:14] 20 elders fought down before him that
[1:13:16] sat on the throne, and they worshiped
[1:13:19] him that liveth forever and ever. and
[1:13:21] they cast their crowns
[1:13:24] before the throne. So you see the bride
[1:13:28] has a crown. We are presently crowned as
[1:13:34] king. We are not going to be kings. We
[1:13:38] are already kings. Crowned kings. What
[1:13:43] that means? We are positioned with a in
[1:13:46] power and authority and we're crowned
[1:13:50] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. We shall
[1:13:54] reign in life. The Bible said we shall
[1:13:57] reign in life. Reign over sin, over
[1:14:00] shame, over lies of the enemy. Over your
[1:14:03] past, you shall reign over it. You are
[1:14:06] not a slave to your past. Amen. You are
[1:14:10] a king in the now. You are anointed. You
[1:14:14] are appointed by the king of glory
[1:14:17] himself.
[1:14:19] Amen. And if you didn't make yourself
[1:14:21] this, he made you this. Salvation made
[1:14:25] you this. He crowned you with the Holy
[1:14:27] Ghost and set you and positioned you
[1:14:30] beside him.
[1:14:35] We shall reign in life. Colossians
[1:14:38] 1:13 says, "Who hath delivered us from
[1:14:41] the power of darkness and hath
[1:14:44] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:14:46] dear son." He didn't just pull you out.
[1:14:50] He placed you in where? The kingdom
[1:14:56] positioned you as a son of God. You have
[1:14:59] been translated, transferred,
[1:15:03] transplanted, adopted. I mean by that
[1:15:06] placed position into a kingdom that
[1:15:10] cannot be shaken.
[1:15:12] Amen. You don't belong to this world.
[1:15:14] You belong to the king. You don't walk
[1:15:17] like the world. You don't think like the
[1:15:18] world. You don't bow to the world. You
[1:15:20] reign from a higher realm. Amen. You
[1:15:23] have dominion. I'm not talking about
[1:15:26] someday. I'm talking about right now.
[1:15:28] Dominion over sin, dominion over fear,
[1:15:31] dominion over lust, dominion over the
[1:15:33] flesh, dominion over the power of
[1:15:35] darkness.
[1:15:36] Amen. He have made us priests. Oh yeah.
[1:15:41] Watch now. You're not just royalty. You
[1:15:44] are holy royalty.
[1:15:46] A priestly king. You're not you're not
[1:15:50] just sitting on the throne. You're
[1:15:52] actually also standing at the altar.
[1:15:55] Amen. You you offer up sacrifices of
[1:15:58] praise. You offer up your life like a
[1:16:02] sweet smelling incense before the
[1:16:04] throne. Your lips are
[1:16:07] sanctified. Your prayers are heard. Your
[1:16:10] intercession is powerful because you are
[1:16:13] a priest under your God. In fact, your
[1:16:17] effectual fervent prayers avails much
[1:16:20] before God. For the prayer of faith will
[1:16:23] save the sick and God shall raise them
[1:16:26] up. Hallelujah. As he says in in first
[1:16:30] Peter 2:9, "But you are a chosen
[1:16:34] generation, a royal priesthood, a holy
[1:16:37] nation, a peculiar people."
[1:16:40] Well, no wonder the world doesn't appeal
[1:16:42] to us. We've some seen something
[1:16:45] greater.
[1:16:46] We are
[1:16:47] peculiar
[1:16:49] because but we're not peculiar because
[1:16:52] we are strange but because we are
[1:16:54] marked. We are sealed. We are separated.
[1:16:58] We've been set apart. We've been filled
[1:17:00] and we've been commissioned. And maybe
[1:17:03] why that's why some think strange
[1:17:05] because we are totally unworldly.
[1:17:09] Amen. We're not of this world. We're
[1:17:10] from another realm. We have dominion
[1:17:13] over the flesh, the world, and the
[1:17:15] devil. And what do kings do? They rule.
[1:17:20] I'm talking to you this morning. What do
[1:17:23] priests do? They minister. And what do
[1:17:26] sons and daughters do? They reflect his
[1:17:28] glory. They walk in his image. And as a
[1:17:30] priest, they carry the holy fire as
[1:17:33] light into the darkness. And as king,
[1:17:36] they take dominion over hell itself.
[1:17:38] Amen. That carry the name of Jesus
[1:17:41] Christ to which every knee has to bow
[1:17:44] and every tongue confess that he is
[1:17:46] supreme Lord over all. Amen. Do you
[1:17:49] believe that this morning? No wonder
[1:17:51] then we're zealous to good works. We've
[1:17:54] been recreated in Christ Jesus to
[1:17:57] reflect the neighbor the nature of our
[1:17:59] father. So I'm telling you this morning,
[1:18:02] don't walk like a popper. Amen. When
[1:18:05] you're wearing a crown. Come on. Amen.
[1:18:08] Don't moan like a slave when you've been
[1:18:10] seated in heavenly places.
[1:18:12] Quit that slave mentality. Look at
[1:18:15] Israel when they were freed from bondage
[1:18:17] in the first Exodus. One of the first
[1:18:19] things they did, they put off the
[1:18:21] garments of their slavery. They went out
[1:18:25] with a high hand.
[1:18:27] Amen. I think we ought to done that
[1:18:29] already spiritually. Amen. threw off the
[1:18:33] garments of our past,
[1:18:35] the garments of our slavery.
[1:18:38] Amen. The dirty garments, the ragged
[1:18:41] garments
[1:18:43] of our slave life where we were slave to
[1:18:46] sin, thrown them off and we've been
[1:18:49] robed with his righteousness. We've been
[1:18:51] crowned as a king. We have been given
[1:18:55] power and dominion to rule over Satan
[1:18:59] and Satan's kingdom.
[1:19:02] The book of Exodus chapter 19
[1:19:05] says, "Then ye shall be a peculiar
[1:19:08] treasure unto me above all people, for
[1:19:11] all the earth is mine, and ye shall be
[1:19:15] unto me a kingdom, a priest, and a holy
[1:19:18] nation." Amen. You see, that's what he
[1:19:21] called us to be.
[1:19:23] So I I'm telling you today as a priest,
[1:19:27] don't let your lips go silent
[1:19:30] when you've been called to lift up holy
[1:19:32] hands and declare the glory of your
[1:19:35] king. Amen. That's what a priest does.
[1:19:38] He comes and he leads and worship. He
[1:19:41] worships. He brings incense. He brings
[1:19:44] sacrifices.
[1:19:46] Amen. Oh my. You you declare the glory
[1:19:49] of your kingdom. him be glory forever
[1:19:52] and ever. Amen. Let the priests minister
[1:19:55] before his altar. Let the kings stand as
[1:19:58] agents of his throne. Let the sons of
[1:20:00] God speak with authority.
[1:20:04] Amen. The crown is already on your head.
[1:20:07] The fire of the Holy Ghost is in your
[1:20:09] soul.
[1:20:11] And the throne room is calling. Amen.
[1:20:14] Amen. He made us unto our God, kings and
[1:20:18] priests to offer a sacrifice of praise.
[1:20:22] Let's examine the scripture. Hebrews
[1:20:24] chapter 13:E1 15. By him, therefore, let
[1:20:28] us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[1:20:32] continually. Now, that's not just in
[1:20:34] church,
[1:20:35] but our whole lives should be a worship.
[1:20:39] Amen. But church is important. We'll get
[1:20:42] to that in a minute. But our bodies, you
[1:20:45] see, are to to g give a sacrifice of
[1:20:50] praise to God continually. That what the
[1:20:55] fruit you know part of of the worship of
[1:20:58] the priests would actually to be bring
[1:21:01] fruit offerings or grain offerings.
[1:21:04] So part of your work in the priesthood
[1:21:07] is to bring fruit offerings. And he
[1:21:11] said, "The fruit of your
[1:21:13] lips given thanks to God."
[1:21:17] Amen. Now, Brother Brandham had some
[1:21:19] things to say. This this is from faith
[1:21:22] to substance. Our bodies are groaning.
[1:21:25] We have an inheritance. We are children
[1:21:28] now. We're heirs of the kingdom, kings
[1:21:31] and priests offering spiritual
[1:21:33] sacrifice. What does a priest do? Make a
[1:21:37] sacrifice. What is a spiritual
[1:21:39] sacrifice? That's what these sons and
[1:21:40] daughters do which are kings and priests
[1:21:44] yet not in full possession but they're
[1:21:46] making sacrifices offering to God
[1:21:50] spiritual sacrifices the fruits of our
[1:21:52] lips giving praise to him. Amen. The
[1:21:54] fruits of our lips. You say, "Brother
[1:21:56] brother Brandham, I just don't feel like
[1:22:00] praising him." That's the time to make
[1:22:03] the sacrifice. Praise him anyhow. Kings
[1:22:08] and priests, sons and daughters offering
[1:22:10] spiritual sacrifice, the fruits of our
[1:22:13] lips giving praise to his name.
[1:22:17] Amen. What a wonderful admonition from
[1:22:19] the prophet of God. Listen to him also
[1:22:21] from earnestly contending for the faith.
[1:22:24] He said said we are high
[1:22:27] priest offered spiritual sacrifices the
[1:22:30] fruits of our lips are giving praise to
[1:22:33] God. And may every believer now as a
[1:22:36] sacrifice of the high priest enter into
[1:22:39] the praises of God. Listen, shouting,
[1:22:43] glorifying God and praise him. I ask
[1:22:46] this in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[1:22:48] people praise God with all their hearts
[1:22:50] and give glory to God. So again, he
[1:22:53] would tell us and I'm just reading
[1:22:55] several of these. this from the seven
[1:22:57] church ages where he says he says when a
[1:23:00] little confusion comes in church you
[1:23:02] don't run over to one side and pout now
[1:23:04] if you if you are you sure ain't a
[1:23:06] priest see you pray through
[1:23:10] spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our
[1:23:13] lips giving praise to his name see what
[1:23:15] I mean well you you say I just don't
[1:23:18] feel like going to church but you're a
[1:23:22] priest it's your duty you've got to be
[1:23:26] there. Well, I I don't feel like taking
[1:23:29] part in the
[1:23:30] service. You know, now you finally come,
[1:23:34] but now you don't feel like taking part.
[1:23:37] But you're a priest, making a sacrifice,
[1:23:41] a spiritual sacrifice. Not giving
[1:23:43] somebody some handme-down.
[1:23:46] Amen. Not going to go going to get
[1:23:50] somebody to come to church. That's all
[1:23:51] good. I have nothing against it. that
[1:23:53] it's you that making a spiritual
[1:23:57] sacrifice, the fruits of your lips
[1:24:00] giving praise to his name. And when you
[1:24:04] see the time coming that everybody's
[1:24:06] blaspheing and saying those things and
[1:24:08] doing wrong and what do you do? Walk
[1:24:10] away? You're supposed to stand there
[1:24:12] with a spiritual sacrifice. The blood of
[1:24:15] Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin.
[1:24:18] Makes me a new creature in Christ. Well,
[1:24:20] you're a crazy fellow. According to what
[1:24:22] you say, it's all right. But to me, it's
[1:24:23] the power of God under salvation. I
[1:24:26] believe it. You say, "You believe in
[1:24:27] divine healing?" Well, I don't believe.
[1:24:28] Better ask my pastor. Well, what do you
[1:24:31] think about it? You're a priest now.
[1:24:33] You're the guy to say, "Yes, sir. I
[1:24:36] believe it." Because God's word said,
[1:24:38] "So, do you believe in the baptism of
[1:24:40] the Holy Spirit?" Yes, sir. How do you
[1:24:42] know? I received it. That's right. The
[1:24:44] spirit's a blessing. The Holy Spirit
[1:24:46] that fell on the apostles, the same
[1:24:49] spirit, Holy Spirit that falls now.
[1:24:52] Amen. Amen. Amen. What some wonderful
[1:24:55] things he says. He says in the power of
[1:24:58] decision. So the thing same thing he
[1:25:01] said to Moses, in other words, this Holy
[1:25:03] Ghost mana that begin to fall on the day
[1:25:06] of Pentecost was to sustain the church.
[1:25:10] And the church was to live only by the
[1:25:12] Holy Spirit until the day we enter into
[1:25:15] the millennium. Hallelujah. What is it?
[1:25:18] That same Holy Ghost.
[1:25:21] Amen. That same Holy Ghost. Now stop for
[1:25:24] a minute.
[1:25:26] Remember remember to to be eating of the
[1:25:30] hidden
[1:25:31] mana. It was only for the priest.
[1:25:35] It was only for the high priest.
[1:25:38] Amen. That's the highest calling of the
[1:25:40] priesthood.
[1:25:42] And you've not just been called a a
[1:25:45] priest, but you've been called a high
[1:25:47] priest.
[1:25:49] Amen. To enter in to the holiest where
[1:25:52] the pot of mana is. The same mana that
[1:25:56] was given on the day of Pentecost and
[1:25:58] get your handful and eat it. Have you
[1:26:00] done that? Then you're a high priest.
[1:26:04] Nobody else can do that. Listen, the
[1:26:06] veil has been open. God ain't trying to
[1:26:09] keep you out of it. He ripped the veil
[1:26:11] so you could get in.
[1:26:14] Hallelujah. Amen. He made accessible the
[1:26:17] way for anyone whosoever will. Amen.
[1:26:21] Repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:26:23] Christ and receive the gift of the Holy
[1:26:25] Ghost. Eat of the original mana. Notice
[1:26:29] it was for everyone that was a priest in
[1:26:31] the Old Testament. Everyone in the New
[1:26:33] Testament that becomes a Christian, born
[1:26:35] again, becomes a priest to God. And we
[1:26:39] are priests and kings. A priest is to
[1:26:42] make a sacrifice. And we are to give God
[1:26:46] the sacrifice of our lips giving praise
[1:26:50] to his name. Say, "I don't feel like
[1:26:53] it." Do it anyhow. That's a sacrifice.
[1:26:56] Say, you say, he says, "Hallelujah." You
[1:26:58] say, "Well, I feel I feel too tired."
[1:27:02] Well, listen to this. The devil will
[1:27:04] tell you that until he takes you to
[1:27:07] hell. That's right. You've You are to
[1:27:11] make a spiritual sacrifice. The fruits
[1:27:14] of our lips given praise to his name.
[1:27:17] Kings and priests. The Bible said we
[1:27:19] were made us priests and kings unto God.
[1:27:23] I don't know how much planer you needed.
[1:27:26] Amen. Amen. I mean, you hear the
[1:27:28] whispers of the devil. What's other
[1:27:30] people going to think? You know, I'm too
[1:27:32] tired. I'm too weary. I've worked too
[1:27:34] hard. You know, I'm I'm really not
[1:27:36] excitable. I I It ain't about your
[1:27:38] emotions. It's about making a sacrifice.
[1:27:43] It ain't about your feelings.
[1:27:46] It's about who you're serving.
[1:27:52] Bringing an acceptable worship.
[1:27:55] Brother Brandham talks about his own
[1:27:57] sister in question answers on the Holy
[1:28:00] Ghost and he said the Holy Spirit fell
[1:28:03] in the building last night. That was for
[1:28:05] edification. I was standing there trying
[1:28:07] to tell the people they must receive the
[1:28:09] Holy Ghost and the devil had come
[1:28:11] around. You don't think he comes to
[1:28:12] church? You don't think he whispers in
[1:28:15] your ear this morning? Amen. He does.
[1:28:18] And the devil had come around saying,
[1:28:21] "Don't listen. Sit still.
[1:28:26] And my sister said, "Bill, I was so
[1:28:30] happy when you were preaching. I felt
[1:28:33] like I just raise up and jump through
[1:28:35] the wall." And I said, "Raise up and
[1:28:38] jump.
[1:28:40] That's all." And she said, "Well, when
[1:28:42] you began to do it out and the people
[1:28:44] began shouting,
[1:28:47] then I felt like I was an old nothing.
[1:28:52] Look what the devil did to her.
[1:28:55] The people are all rejoicing.
[1:28:58] People are all worshiping and she felt
[1:29:00] like cuz she, you know, because she had
[1:29:04] been reluctant and held back, you know,
[1:29:06] because the devil had come around
[1:29:09] saying, "Don't listen. Sit still." And
[1:29:12] she felt like, I mean, she would have
[1:29:14] had the impulse to worship. Felt like
[1:29:18] I'd raise up and jump. He said, "You
[1:29:20] should have done it."
[1:29:22] And he said, "Then when the people got
[1:29:24] to shouting," said I got to feel like I
[1:29:26] was an old nothing. And he said, "That's
[1:29:28] the devil.
[1:29:30] That's Satan." When he comes in to do
[1:29:33] that, you should have raised up anyhow.
[1:29:35] We're priests of God making spiritual
[1:29:38] sacrifice, the fruits of our lips,
[1:29:40] giving praise to his name.
[1:29:44] Amen.
[1:29:46] This is a little bit lengthy, but I'm
[1:29:49] going to give you an example of brother
[1:29:51] Brandham given the sacrifice of praise
[1:29:54] himself. And I love this and we should
[1:29:57] take example from it.
[1:30:01] He says in the Lamb's Book of Life, you
[1:30:04] can maybe listen to it yourself, but
[1:30:06] he's worshiping and he says, "How we
[1:30:08] love you, how we praise you, how I
[1:30:11] worship you, Lord, myself here behind
[1:30:14] this sacred desk. With my hands up to
[1:30:17] thee, I worship thee, my God. I worship
[1:30:20] thee. You're my healer, my savior, my
[1:30:22] king, my provider, my father, my
[1:30:24] brother, my all and all. Rest in me.
[1:30:26] You're my strength. I publicly, David
[1:30:29] said, I will praise thee in the
[1:30:31] congregation of the saints, and I will
[1:30:33] give thee praise before the sanctified
[1:30:36] ones this morning. I praise thee for
[1:30:38] healing me. I praise you for my life. I
[1:30:41] praise you for my health. I praise you
[1:30:43] for the goodness you've shown me. I
[1:30:45] praise you for my friends. I praise you
[1:30:47] for everything, Lord. You're wonderful,
[1:30:49] joy, unspeakable, full of glory. How I
[1:30:52] praise thee. How I can recommend thee to
[1:30:55] the weary. How I can recommend you to as
[1:30:58] a savior. How I can recommend thee to
[1:31:00] the sick as a healer. How I I I can
[1:31:04] recommend thee to the wonderer as a
[1:31:07] king. How I love thee this morning. How
[1:31:10] I can recommend you to to those who are
[1:31:13] downtrodden to be to be the joy in the
[1:31:17] camp. How I can we thank you. You're a
[1:31:20] rock in the weary land. A shelter in the
[1:31:23] time of storm. The alpha, the omega, the
[1:31:26] beginning, the end, the roses sharing,
[1:31:28] the lily of the valley, the morning
[1:31:30] star. How we love you, how we adore you,
[1:31:33] how we appraise you, the matchless
[1:31:36] eternal one. We give thee praise. We'll
[1:31:38] praise thee and give thee praises
[1:31:40] through all the ages. Receive us, Lord,
[1:31:43] as we offer these blessings, the fruits
[1:31:46] of our lips. You said we're a peculiar
[1:31:49] people, a royal priesthood, offered
[1:31:51] spiritual sacrifice, the fruits of our
[1:31:54] lips given praise to his name. How we
[1:31:56] praise thee, how we adore thee forever
[1:31:58] and ever. Oh, receive the adoration of
[1:32:01] our hearts. Express our lips, Lord, that
[1:32:04] from the depths of a pure heart, we
[1:32:07] praise thee, knowing that it's not what
[1:32:09] we could do. It's not our life, it's his
[1:32:11] life. It's not our salvation, it's his
[1:32:13] salvation. It's not our heaven, it's his
[1:32:15] heaven. It's not our works, it's his
[1:32:17] work. It's not our grace, it's his
[1:32:19] grace. It's not our glory, it's his
[1:32:21] glory. Not our power, it's his power.
[1:32:24] How we love you. Amen. Not our church,
[1:32:26] but his church. How we praise thee, oh
[1:32:28] God. That's our hearts. Receive us.
[1:32:33] Amen. Then he prayed, "Oh God, send this
[1:32:36] little Brandham tabernacle and
[1:32:38] outpouring of the spirit. Will you do
[1:32:40] it, Lord? We're needy here on the
[1:32:42] corner. God, send down the showers of
[1:32:45] blessings. Pour out the rain of God, the
[1:32:48] former and the latter. Baptize our
[1:32:51] pastor new. Set him a fire with the
[1:32:54] gospel. We love him today, the Lord.
[1:32:56] He's your servant. We pray that you'll
[1:32:57] anoint his heart. Anoint the hearts of
[1:32:59] other preachers in the building this
[1:33:01] morning. And every member, may we go out
[1:33:03] of here, Lord, and don't forget your
[1:33:05] poor, unworthy servant, myself, Lord,
[1:33:08] that you'll anoint me aresh with the
[1:33:10] Holy Ghost. Grant it, Lord. Give us
[1:33:12] these blessings. We humbly waiting at
[1:33:15] the altar knowing that we receive it.
[1:33:17] Bathing ourselves in your Holy Spirit,
[1:33:20] not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[1:33:22] Christ, the power of God under
[1:33:24] salvation. How we thank thee for it.
[1:33:26] Some glorious day we hope to see you,
[1:33:28] Lord, and lay our hands at the feet of
[1:33:31] the one that stands with us today, who
[1:33:33] we cannot see, but we know he's here.
[1:33:36] How we praise thee.
[1:33:39] Amen. What an example.
[1:33:45] I think he taught us how to praise God.
[1:33:50] Amen. Oh, it's so important that
[1:33:54] everyone enters into an atmosphere of
[1:33:58] praise unto our God. Amen.
[1:34:02] Oh, what if it would be if we all came
[1:34:04] to church just one time
[1:34:08] and everybody got in one accord.
[1:34:14] Amen. You remember last Sunday's sermon?
[1:34:17] If you if you can't be the prophet, be a
[1:34:20] part of the minstrel.
[1:34:22] You remember where he said, "I tell you,
[1:34:23] brother, when all the formal shuckles
[1:34:26] are shut down and and and the spirit of
[1:34:28] God back in the songs again and get to
[1:34:30] an old place where we have the spirit of
[1:34:32] God moving in a place, then the prophet
[1:34:34] can see a vision. Then the powers of God
[1:34:36] comes in the church. Then they will see
[1:34:38] divine healing. Then they'll see the
[1:34:39] resurrection of Christ. Then they'll see
[1:34:41] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:34:43] forever." And he said, "Well, you say,
[1:34:44] "Brother Brandom, I'm not the prophet."
[1:34:46] Well, if you ain't the prophet, you can
[1:34:48] be the minister of the instrument in
[1:34:50] instrument anyhow. Just keep playing.
[1:34:52] That's right. You ain't got more than
[1:34:53] them 10. You just give bent as hard as
[1:34:56] you can. If you can't be the prophet, be
[1:34:59] a part of the minstrel. Do something.
[1:35:02] Oh, church, hear this. Do something to
[1:35:06] bring the spirit of the Lord down. Amen.
[1:35:09] The prophet couldn't do himself. Listen.
[1:35:12] And the prophet in the pulpit, the
[1:35:13] ministry of the New Testament prophet in
[1:35:16] the pulpit can't do it all by himself.
[1:35:19] He had to have the minstal to help him.
[1:35:22] And when the prophet and the people got
[1:35:24] in harmony with God, then the prophet
[1:35:26] begin to see things. Now brother, if you
[1:35:29] don't see divine healing, you don't see
[1:35:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you don't
[1:35:34] see this mighty move of God in the
[1:35:35] spirit in this last stage here, just get
[1:35:38] in the spirit one time and you'll see
[1:35:41] things. How many would like to see in
[1:35:44] our church?
[1:35:46] Amen. The moving of his spirit. Amen.
[1:35:49] How many would like to see more divine
[1:35:51] healing? Amen. More souls saved.
[1:35:55] Amen. the kingdom of hell shaken, the
[1:35:58] power and the name of Jesus Christ
[1:36:00] exalted. How many would like to see
[1:36:02] that? Amen. Then do something
[1:36:07] to bring the spirit of the Lord down.
[1:36:12] Hallelujah. Become part of the minstrel.
[1:36:15] Don't come with a criticizing spirit.
[1:36:18] Amen. Get in.
[1:36:24] Amen.
[1:36:26] Now, church is to be a place of worship.
[1:36:30] It's to be a place of
[1:36:32] prayer and
[1:36:34] praise and
[1:36:37] worship. Hello.
[1:36:40] I'm talking to you church mouths.
[1:36:44] It's to be a place of prayer,
[1:36:47] of praise and worship. Amen. Isaiah 56
[1:36:52] and7, for my house shall be called a
[1:36:55] house of prayer for all people.
[1:36:59] You see, a place where worship flows
[1:37:02] upward and God's glory comes
[1:37:05] down. We got we've got to restore the
[1:37:09] original purpose, a people of praise,
[1:37:12] not performance. The house of God is not
[1:37:15] where you come to be entertained.
[1:37:18] Amen. Wow. The sermon was pretty good.
[1:37:20] That song was okay, you know, and and
[1:37:23] and we want to be entertained. It's not
[1:37:26] for your entertainment.
[1:37:28] Amen. The house of God is where you come
[1:37:31] to worship.
[1:37:35] You know, many songs that are sung today
[1:37:38] are not sung to worship.
[1:37:41] They're not sung to
[1:37:42] worship. You see a lot of the artists
[1:37:45] even in even in the what do you call it?
[1:37:48] southern gospel even in them, you know,
[1:37:51] they're glorifying the voice.
[1:37:54] They're glorifying, you know, hit this
[1:37:57] note and oh, you know, what a what a
[1:38:00] master. What a great You see, it's not a
[1:38:03] worship.
[1:38:06] And honestly, I've been to some of their
[1:38:08] concerts and honestly, I didn't go to
[1:38:11] worship. I went to be entertained
[1:38:15] because it was entertainment,
[1:38:17] clean, wholesome, but entertainment. But
[1:38:21] that is not a worship.
[1:38:24] You see, you see, we got to get back to
[1:38:27] the original purpose. Like, and like I
[1:38:29] said, many songs today that are being
[1:38:31] sung by these Christian artists. They
[1:38:34] they may have good lyrics, but the
[1:38:37] spirit they sing them in is wrong and
[1:38:41] often
[1:38:42] demonic. And when it's that way, it's
[1:38:45] mockery and it's sacriiggious and
[1:38:47] blasphemous.
[1:38:50] You know, Elvis, he was he could sing
[1:38:52] Amazing Grace really good with his
[1:38:55] melodious voice, but his spirit was
[1:38:58] wrong. You know, Ferlin Husky day
[1:39:02] debuted this song on the wings of a snow
[1:39:05] white dove uh on the grand old opri in
[1:39:08] the year 1960. It made the top of the
[1:39:12] pop charts as entertainment.
[1:39:14] But when it was sung by the prophet of
[1:39:17] God, when I sat there in that meeting
[1:39:21] and listened to him preach on the wings
[1:39:23] of a snow white dove and there hearing
[1:39:26] the song at the end of it sang by the
[1:39:29] prophet, it had a different anointing
[1:39:32] and it was in the spirit and it took a
[1:39:36] same song,
[1:39:38] same lyrics,
[1:39:40] but under a different anointing and it
[1:39:43] took on a new meeting and it became
[1:39:46] worship.
[1:39:52] Oh, the rock crowd loved it. The pop
[1:39:55] stars loved it. The the country and
[1:39:57] western, it made high on the
[1:39:59] charts. It was entertainment.
[1:40:03] But when it was taken by Redeemed Son
[1:40:06] and sung under the anointing of the
[1:40:08] spirit, it was no longer a pop song.
[1:40:13] Amen. It was worship.
[1:40:17] Amen.
[1:40:19] We must worship in spirit and in truth.
[1:40:22] So even though the lyrics may be
[1:40:24] scripturally right, it must be sung in
[1:40:27] the spirit to be acceptable before God
[1:40:30] and to and it must bring the atmosphere
[1:40:33] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:35] Amen. You know, this is what we want to
[1:40:38] do. Yeah. We want the best musicians. I
[1:40:40] believe in you doing our best. Uh we we
[1:40:43] want the best vocalist. I believe in
[1:40:46] giving the Lord our best. Amen. But
[1:40:49] however, you know what's important that
[1:40:52] it brings the atmosphere
[1:40:55] of the Holy Ghost. Did you see how the
[1:40:58] song service crescendo there at the end?
[1:41:02] What was coming down? It was bringing
[1:41:04] the glory of God down. It was preparing
[1:41:07] hearts for the word to go forth. So you
[1:41:11] know but what do we come to church for?
[1:41:14] We are here to worship.
[1:41:18] And praise is not optional. It is
[1:41:21] actually our access.
[1:41:24] Our access.
[1:41:26] Well the Bible said in Psalms 10 verse4
[1:41:31] enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[1:41:34] into his courts with praise. Be thankful
[1:41:36] unto him and bless his name. Amen. The
[1:41:40] gates of go the gates of God's dwelling,
[1:41:43] they open to thanksgiving.
[1:41:46] It's a key to open it up. Amen. The the
[1:41:50] courts, the inner sanctum, they are
[1:41:52] entered by praise.
[1:41:55] Amen. That's what we're coming to church
[1:41:57] for, to enter into his courts.
[1:42:01] Amen. God doesn't God doesn't allow just
[1:42:04] any old spirit into his courts. He's
[1:42:06] enthroned on praise.
[1:42:10] It's like it's the password. You don't
[1:42:12] just barge right in before the throne
[1:42:14] room before a king with your complaining
[1:42:17] lips and depressed attitude. Amen. You
[1:42:20] come with reverent joy.
[1:42:24] It's important how you approach the
[1:42:26] king. There's a proper protocol,
[1:42:31] proper
[1:42:34] behavior.
[1:42:38] Remember
[1:42:40] Nehemiah? He was all sad and burdened
[1:42:43] for his people.
[1:42:45] And you didn't dare show sadness and
[1:42:47] burden and all of that stuff before the
[1:42:49] king.
[1:42:51] But you know, he was so broken for his
[1:42:52] people. He couldn't help
[1:42:54] it. And so, you know, he he went there
[1:42:57] and of course the king asked him what
[1:42:58] the deal was and and he sent him there
[1:43:00] to restore Jerusalem. But here's here's
[1:43:04] the point. You don't approach the king
[1:43:08] with the wrong spirit and attitude.
[1:43:12] Amen. You see Isaiah 60 and verse 18
[1:43:15] said, "Thou shalt call thy walls
[1:43:19] salvation and thy gates praise."
[1:43:23] Thy gates praise.
[1:43:26] So heaven's gates are gates of praise.
[1:43:30] When we praise, it opens heaven's gates
[1:43:35] and allows us into his presence.
[1:43:38] It gives a worshipper entrance and it
[1:43:41] brings heaven down. It opens up heaven
[1:43:44] to the believer. Amen. Now 1 Peter
[1:43:49] chapter 2 and verse 5. You also as
[1:43:52] lively stones, living stones are built
[1:43:56] up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood
[1:44:00] to offer up spiritual sacrifices ex
[1:44:04] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. What
[1:44:07] is this telling us, friends? You're not
[1:44:11] just saved to escape hell. That's right.
[1:44:15] Amen. We are saved to become a house of
[1:44:18] praise.
[1:44:20] Exactly. The church The church isn't
[1:44:22] made of brick and mortar or as in our
[1:44:24] case stuck and stone. The church is you
[1:44:28] and me.
[1:44:30] Filled with the spirit. Release and
[1:44:32] worship. That's right. Worship is our
[1:44:35] priestly duty.
[1:44:37] We don't wait for a feeling.
[1:44:41] That's right. Amen. We we're not waiting
[1:44:44] on an emotion.
[1:44:48] We respond to his faithfulness.
[1:44:52] It is our sacrifice. It's our offering
[1:44:55] to God that we are bringing.
[1:44:58] Amen. Well, I was waiting for a feeling.
[1:45:01] Don't wait for a feeling.
[1:45:03] You may never feel it.
[1:45:06] Amen. You say, "Well, then that's
[1:45:08] mechanical. It doesn't really matter."
[1:45:11] Amen. and you're given voice
[1:45:14] to to and witness
[1:45:17] to the Holy Spirit that is in you.
[1:45:21] Actually, praise is a weapon. It's a
[1:45:23] witness. Second Chronicles 20 shows us
[1:45:26] that when Judah went to war, the
[1:45:29] praisers went first.
[1:45:31] That's why we have the order we have in
[1:45:34] the songs. So, in the service, we we
[1:45:36] have prayer and then we have songs. What
[1:45:39] are we doing? And we're getting ready
[1:45:41] for the battle
[1:45:43] because when the word comes forth, it's
[1:45:45] going to duel the enemy and drive Satan
[1:45:47] out. Is that right? When Judah went to
[1:45:50] war, the praisers went first and the
[1:45:52] enemy would destroy themselves.
[1:45:55] Well, if we get to praising God in his
[1:45:57] church,
[1:45:59] Amen. Devils would start fighting one
[1:46:01] another and destroyed ourselves.
[1:46:04] We got Bible example of this. All right.
[1:46:07] All right. Psalms 149
[1:46:10] 6-9. I summarize it by saying this. Let
[1:46:14] the high praises of God be in their
[1:46:16] mouth and a two-edged sword in their
[1:46:18] hands.
[1:46:20] What? Praises of God and a two-edged
[1:46:23] sword. Your praise, your praise binds
[1:46:28] kings with chains.
[1:46:30] Amen. When the church praises,
[1:46:33] strongholds break, devils flee. Amen.
[1:46:37] Isn't that what the Bible says? Submit
[1:46:39] yourself to God. That's what we're doing
[1:46:42] when we're praising God. We're
[1:46:44] submitting ourselves.
[1:46:46] To do what? Serve us.
[1:46:49] To worship. We're a priest.
[1:46:54] The Bible said in the dedication of
[1:46:56] Solomon's temple in 2 Chronicles 5, came
[1:47:00] to pass as the trumpeters and his
[1:47:02] singers were as one. Watch now. that
[1:47:05] we're all as one. That was all as one.
[1:47:08] Oh, we, you know, you you have the
[1:47:10] musician, but you're the singers.
[1:47:13] And if we could all just be as one, then
[1:47:16] the house was filled with a cloud. And
[1:47:19] even the house of the Lord, the glory of
[1:47:21] the Lord had filled the house of God.
[1:47:24] What? When the church got in harmony.
[1:47:28] Amen. And when the musicians and the
[1:47:31] singers all got together and they all
[1:47:34] got in the spirit, the glory cloud came
[1:47:38] down
[1:47:39] in the house of God. If he did it once,
[1:47:43] it'll do it again.
[1:47:46] Amen. Oh yeah. When Paul and Silas
[1:47:48] praised in prison, the earth shook.
[1:47:52] Amen. Praise is a weapon. It shakes
[1:47:54] prisons. It opens doors. Amen.
[1:47:58] Can I get this to you this morning?
[1:48:00] Unified worship.
[1:48:03] Unified worship doesn't mean, you know,
[1:48:06] one is worshiping here and one's
[1:48:07] worshiping and you know, one's just back
[1:48:09] in the me. It means everybody.
[1:48:14] Everybody. You even ought to be teaching
[1:48:16] your children to worship.
[1:48:20] Amen. Sit up in church. Clap your hands.
[1:48:24] Raise and praise the Lord. pray when
[1:48:27] they're praying. Don't be out running
[1:48:28] around playing this and that. You ought
[1:48:30] to teach that. Train them up from the
[1:48:34] time they're young. I did with mine. My
[1:48:36] wife did with with ours. Amen. You see,
[1:48:40] unified worship is one mind and one
[1:48:42] accord releasing the glory of God. And
[1:48:46] it brings down the pillar of fire. You
[1:48:48] want the pillar of fire in the church?
[1:48:51] Amen. Well, I'll tell you what. in Acts
[1:48:54] chapter 4 after they had received the
[1:48:56] glorious event on the day of Pentecost.
[1:48:59] And the saints got threatened. Amen. Let
[1:49:02] me tell you, they didn't pray and praise
[1:49:05] less. No, no, no. They g they gave even
[1:49:08] more praise and they were filled with
[1:49:09] the spirit until it shook the house.
[1:49:14] Amen. Oh my. Couldn't we have don't we
[1:49:17] need some really house shaking services
[1:49:21] where let every service be a revival of
[1:49:25] worship where we are filled again with
[1:49:26] the spirit and let the sanctuary be
[1:49:29] filled not with spectators but with
[1:49:32] priests offering up sacrifices of
[1:49:35] praise.
[1:49:37] Amen.
[1:49:39] Oh, brother Tim, you got all this wrong.
[1:49:42] You know, uh, we're we're to offer up
[1:49:46] Jesus. He's our
[1:49:48] sacrifice. That's the sacrifice, Brother
[1:49:50] Tim. Yep. Jesus is our sacrifice. He is
[1:49:55] our lamb. He is all of that. You believe
[1:49:58] it? Amen. But the spiritual sacrifice is
[1:50:02] not offering up Jesus.
[1:50:05] And his surrendered life as a lamb. It's
[1:50:07] your surrendered life. Amen.
[1:50:11] That's what he wants you to give as a
[1:50:13] priest.
[1:50:15] Amen. 1 Peter chapter 2:9, you are a
[1:50:19] chosen generation, a royal, that's a
[1:50:23] kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a
[1:50:26] peculiar people that you should show
[1:50:28] forth what?
[1:50:30] The praises of him who hath called you
[1:50:33] out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:50:36] light. Amen. How many believes this
[1:50:39] light is marvelous? Amen. Then you
[1:50:41] should show forth the praises of him who
[1:50:44] have brought you out of darkness. How
[1:50:46] many was in darkness? He brought you out
[1:50:49] of darkness where
[1:50:51] into this marvelous light. You think
[1:50:54] when a somebody gets liberated out of
[1:50:57] prison, don't you know there's some
[1:50:59] shouting?
[1:51:00] Amen. You know when they had them and
[1:51:02] the terrorists had them down, the Hamas
[1:51:04] had Israelites up. Don't you know there
[1:51:06] was shouting when those Israelites were
[1:51:09] freed? If you have been set free,
[1:51:13] if you've been released from Satan's
[1:51:16] prison, there ought to be a shout.
[1:51:20] You shouting and the rest shouting
[1:51:22] because you're free.
[1:51:30] Under the new covenant, we are not
[1:51:33] called to offer lambs, bulls, and
[1:51:38] goats, but we're called to offer our
[1:51:41] lives,
[1:51:43] our lips, our love, our surrender.
[1:51:47] These are the spiritual sacrifices that
[1:51:50] ra rise up like incense before the
[1:51:53] throne and bring pleasure to the hearts
[1:51:57] of God. Did you notice in Revelation
[1:52:00] five the four and 20 elders which I've
[1:52:03] already told you represents the bride of
[1:52:05] the old and the new.
[1:52:07] Amen. The bride then is holding
[1:52:11] incense showing they are priest.
[1:52:13] Remember the king went to Aubre incense
[1:52:18] and leprosy which is a type of sin
[1:52:20] struck him. Amen. Because he was not
[1:52:23] qualified. Well, you have been called to
[1:52:26] offer incense.
[1:52:29] You're shown in the Bible of doing it.
[1:52:33] So when are you going to reflect your
[1:52:35] inheritance?
[1:52:39] Hallelujah. Amen. So
[1:52:43] again in Hebrews chapter 13:E1 15 by him
[1:52:48] therefore let us offer this sacrifice of
[1:52:51] praise to God continually that is the
[1:52:55] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[1:52:58] name.
[1:52:59] I want you to get this now
[1:53:03] notice. Let us
[1:53:05] offer the fruit of our lips.
[1:53:09] You see, praise is a sacrifice
[1:53:13] because
[1:53:14] sometimes it's not offered out of
[1:53:16] emotion, but out of obedience and faith.
[1:53:20] When you're when you're hurting, when
[1:53:22] you're tired, when you're confused or
[1:53:25] broken, and you still say, "Oh, God,
[1:53:28] you're worthy."
[1:53:31] That's a sacrifice raising up and rising
[1:53:34] up to heaven like a sweet incense
[1:53:38] under new covenant. As I said, we're
[1:53:40] we're not called to offer lambs and
[1:53:42] bulls, but our lives and give a
[1:53:45] sacrifice of praise. So he said, "Let us
[1:53:48] offer the sacrifice of praise
[1:53:51] continually to God."
[1:53:55] Now praise then is not based on
[1:53:59] feelings.
[1:54:02] It's based on truth.
[1:54:06] Is it true Jesus saved you? Do you
[1:54:09] always feel saved?
[1:54:12] No, you don't. Amen. There's days you
[1:54:15] don't feel like it. The devil beats you
[1:54:18] around the stump, Brother Brandham said,
[1:54:20] with your feelings.
[1:54:22] Amen. But if you know you've been
[1:54:24] redeemed,
[1:54:26] you can praise him not because you feel
[1:54:28] it, but because it's true.
[1:54:32] Hallelujah. Amen. And when you praise in
[1:54:35] your pain, it becomes pure fire before
[1:54:39] the throne. Paul and Silas sang in
[1:54:41] prison and chains broke. Not just for
[1:54:44] them, but for everybody around them. Oh,
[1:54:47] we need them kind of services. chain
[1:54:50] breaking services,
[1:54:53] chains of complexes and unbelief and
[1:54:55] doubt and fear and sin. Amen. The Bible
[1:55:00] of sin, chains of sin broke off
[1:55:04] where wounded hearts and wounded hands
[1:55:06] lift up and praise before God. And there
[1:55:10] they touch the heart of God like no
[1:55:11] other sacrifice
[1:55:14] can. There's something sacred.
[1:55:19] There's something heavenly about a
[1:55:22] praise that rises not from
[1:55:24] comfort but from conflict.
[1:55:29] Stop and think what I'm saying. You
[1:55:31] know, we only want to praise when we're
[1:55:33] comfortable.
[1:55:36] When everything's been going good and we
[1:55:39] feel like it. Amen. But you see, you
[1:55:42] see, there's something sacred though
[1:55:45] that and and it's heavenly about a
[1:55:48] praise that raises not from comfort but
[1:55:51] from conflict. There there's a praise
[1:55:54] that heaven cannot ignore. It's a it's
[1:55:56] the worship of the wounded.
[1:56:02] Amen. The the Bible said in Psalms
[1:56:04] 51:17, because I know you need a
[1:56:06] scripture for this, the sacrifices of
[1:56:09] God or a broken spirit, a broken and a
[1:56:13] contrite heart, oh God, thou wilt not
[1:56:16] despise.
[1:56:19] You see, when wounded hands are lifted,
[1:56:23] hands that have been carried through
[1:56:25] betrayal, through loss, through grief,
[1:56:28] through rejection, through heartbreak,
[1:56:30] they carry something weighty in the
[1:56:32] courts of heaven. Amen. Why? Because
[1:56:35] that praise ain't cheap. It cost
[1:56:39] something.
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:42] Hallelujah. You remember the woman who
[1:56:44] wanted to wash Jesus' feet? She wasn't
[1:56:47] wanting cheap perfume. I want the best
[1:56:50] Alabaster box you got.
[1:56:55] Hallelujah. And out of her hurting and
[1:56:58] out of her pain and out of her past, she
[1:57:01] offered praise.
[1:57:06] She wasn't looking about her worthiness,
[1:57:09] but his worthiness.
[1:57:12] She wasn't concerned about how she felt
[1:57:15] and how conspicuous she was and what
[1:57:18] everybody else thought about her and how
[1:57:21] she shouldn't be there. She wasn't
[1:57:23] worried about that. She wanted one
[1:57:25] thing. I got to get to Jesus and wash
[1:57:27] the dirt off his feet.
[1:57:30] Oh, that there would be a people today
[1:57:32] that wouldn't be so concerned about
[1:57:34] theirelves, about my past and how
[1:57:37] unworthy I am and all of this and would
[1:57:40] get one focus on one thing about the
[1:57:42] worthy one, the worthy lamb that's in
[1:57:45] our
[1:57:48] midst. And they would bring their
[1:57:51] alabaster box
[1:58:05] You
[1:58:06] see, praise from wounded hands is praise
[1:58:12] that costs something.
[1:58:21] In the Bible, Abraham wouldn't take a
[1:58:23] burial place for Sarah. They tried to
[1:58:26] give it to him. They wouldn't He
[1:58:27] wouldn't take something that cost him
[1:58:28] nothing.
[1:58:30] I'm laying something valuable here.
[1:58:34] Sarah, this is my
[1:58:37] wife. When he he didn't quibble over the
[1:58:40] price, and it was an exorbitant
[1:58:44] price. Jesus wouldn't take a kingdom
[1:58:47] without a cross.
[1:58:50] Come on. David bought on stretch and
[1:58:53] floor and refused to offer sacrifice. He
[1:58:56] said, "I will not offer a sacrifice that
[1:58:59] costs me nothing."
[1:59:04] Wounded praise is costly
[1:59:07] praise. What do I mean? Anyone can
[1:59:11] praise God when the bills are paid, when
[1:59:14] the body is healed, when the doors are
[1:59:17] all open for you.
[1:59:19] Amen. But when the storm is raging and
[1:59:21] you still scream out, "Oh, bless the
[1:59:23] Lord, oh my soul, and all that's in me,
[1:59:27] bless your holy name."
[1:59:30] That is real gold in the fire. That is
[1:59:33] sweet savor rising up from the altar of
[1:59:36] a heart that is burning even when it's
[1:59:38] bleeding.
[1:59:45] Sacrifice implies pain.
[1:59:54] It implies surrender.
[1:59:57] It implies something laid
[1:59:59] down that is valuable to the giver.
[2:00:04] So when you praise when you're bleeding,
[2:00:07] when you lift up scarred hands trembling
[2:00:10] with pain but still lifted toward
[2:00:12] heaven, that's a sacrifice that angels
[2:00:15] cannot refuse.
[2:00:17] or they can't offer and God can't
[2:00:20] refuse.
[2:00:22] Amen. Come on. Amen. They have never
[2:00:25] been redeemed. Only the redeemed, only
[2:00:27] the wounded worshipper can give God that
[2:00:29] kind of an offering.
[2:00:33] I remember the girl at youth camp,
[2:00:36] Sister Deborah, who was so scarred from
[2:00:39] her past, had scars where she slid her
[2:00:43] wrist because of selfhate.
[2:00:46] time after time want to destroy her own
[2:00:49] life. Sin does some awful things to
[2:00:52] people. It wounds the heart. It destroys
[2:00:55] the life and it wrecked this young
[2:00:58] girl's heart. But God in his mercy and
[2:01:01] grace had redeemed her and set her free
[2:01:04] from her past. And she was a slave no
[2:01:07] longer.
[2:01:08] But she still had the scars and she was
[2:01:12] ashamed.
[2:01:15] and sitting in youth camp one service. I
[2:01:18] think by now she's a married woman and
[2:01:20] anyway she whatever she was sitting in
[2:01:23] the service and she was thinking oh I
[2:01:27] I'd love just to be able to raise my
[2:01:28] hands to God and just give him praise in
[2:01:31] the congregation but I can't look at all
[2:01:34] these scars. Everybody would see my
[2:01:36] scars. They would see the the marks of
[2:01:39] my past.
[2:01:42] And she began to think though of how
[2:01:44] great he was and how wonderful he was
[2:01:47] and how worthy of worship he was. And in
[2:01:50] spite of her of her intimidation and her
[2:01:53] feelings, she lifted those wounded hands
[2:01:57] to God and began to praise him. And when
[2:02:01] she did, the
[2:02:02] scars, every one of them
[2:02:05] disappeared, vanish forever, gone. steps
[2:02:11] away and get rid of your scars.
[2:02:13] Surrender your life to Christ. Praise
[2:02:16] him with all your heart. Your scars will
[2:02:18] fade away.
[2:02:27] Only redeemed, only wounded worshippers
[2:02:30] can give God that kind of an offering.
[2:02:33] The great high priest
[2:02:35] himself was a man of
[2:02:38] sorrows and acquainted with
[2:02:42] grief. Even in Gethsemane, when sweat
[2:02:45] turned to blood, he said, "Not my will,
[2:02:49] but thine be
[2:02:50] done." Even wounded, he obeyed. Even
[2:02:53] broken, he praised. So even now, oh God,
[2:02:58] even now we lift up our wounds to God
[2:03:00] and it touches his heart because it
[2:03:03] mirrors the work that he did when he was
[2:03:06] here in the flesh. I want to say to you
[2:03:08] today, your scars do not disqualify you.
[2:03:15] Amen. But when you raise your hands to
[2:03:18] God, those wounded hands, they identify
[2:03:21] you as a worshshiper. Amen.
[2:03:25] Amen. They say, "I have been through the
[2:03:27] fire, but I'm still worshiping. I've had
[2:03:30] all kinds of pain, of rejection, of sin,
[2:03:34] of past. Amen. I've had loss. I've had
[2:03:37] everything, but I'm still worshiping."
[2:03:41] Hallelujah. You can't take my praise.
[2:03:44] Amen. You can't take my praise. Devil,
[2:03:46] you can do everything to me, but you
[2:03:49] can't take my praise.
[2:03:54] I'm still
[2:03:55] worshiping. And when you lift up broken
[2:03:58] hands, it's a declar declaration. Though
[2:04:02] he slay me, yet I will trust him.
[2:04:06] It declares that your faith is not for
[2:04:08] sale and your worship is not conditional
[2:04:11] and your praise is not dependent on your
[2:04:14] feelings.
[2:04:17] It's the voice of those three Hebrew
[2:04:19] children in the fire saying, "Our God is
[2:04:23] able to deliver us, but even if he
[2:04:26] doesn't, we will not bow."
[2:04:29] Oh, I wonder how many worshippers are in
[2:04:32] this building this morning that can say
[2:04:33] that. Amen. No matter what you do to me,
[2:04:36] Satan, no matter what kind of fiery
[2:04:39] furnace you put me through, I will not
[2:04:41] bend. I will not bow.
[2:04:46] I will worship only the Lord God
[2:04:48] Jehovah.
[2:04:50] I tell you that kind of praise is
[2:04:52] dangerous to the enemy, but it's
[2:04:55] precious to God. That kind of praise
[2:04:58] gets heaven to move. And God actually
[2:05:01] dwells in that kind of
[2:05:04] praise. And here's what's so wonderful.
[2:05:08] Wounded hands lifted up become healed
[2:05:10] hands.
[2:05:12] Not always because the circumstances
[2:05:16] changes, but because some something
[2:05:19] divine is exchanged when you worshiped.
[2:05:22] What do you mean, brother Tim? Well,
[2:05:23] Isaiah said there would be an exchange.
[2:05:26] Ver chapter 61, he said he'll give
[2:05:28] beauty for your ashes. He'll give you
[2:05:31] the oil of joy from mourning. He'll give
[2:05:33] you the garment of praise for the spirit
[2:05:35] of heaviness.
[2:05:38] Hallelujah. Your wounds may still show,
[2:05:42] but now they'll carry glory.
[2:05:45] Now your hands are not just raised,
[2:05:47] they're redeemed.
[2:05:49] Your scars are not just reminders of
[2:05:52] your pain, they're testimonies of
[2:05:54] triumph.
[2:05:56] So I say to you this morning, lift up
[2:05:58] those feeble hands that hang down.
[2:06:02] Come on. Amen. Let the lame say, Amen.
[2:06:06] Let the weak say I am strong. Amen.
[2:06:10] Well, lift up those holy hands. The
[2:06:13] physical act of raising hands and
[2:06:16] prayers, it symbolizes reverence and
[2:06:20] devotion and surrender to God's will.
[2:06:23] That's what we're saying when we raise
[2:06:25] our hand. I surrender to your will. I
[2:06:28] give devotion to God. Amen. I reverence
[2:06:32] unto my God.
[2:06:34] Paul said that men should pray
[2:06:35] everywhere lifting up holy hands without
[2:06:38] anger or
[2:06:39] disputing. So what do we do? We lift
[2:06:42] them up when our tears are falling.
[2:06:44] That's right. We lift them up in the
[2:06:46] dark times pushing back their
[2:06:48] depression. When Moses lifted up his
[2:06:51] hands, Amen. Israel prevailed against
[2:06:53] their enemies. So I say lift him up. And
[2:06:57] when the enemy says there's no reason to
[2:06:59] worship, lift them up anyway because
[2:07:03] wounded hands rise in praise, confessing
[2:07:06] promises and expressing faith that moves
[2:07:09] the heart of God. It touches the high
[2:07:12] priest. It says, "That's the one I died
[2:07:15] for. That's the fragrance I've been
[2:07:17] longing for. That's the worship that
[2:07:20] will shake the shake hell." Amen. And
[2:07:23] bring heaven down. Amen.
[2:07:27] So, I'm going to tell you this morning,
[2:07:29] don't let the devil silence your praise.
[2:07:34] Come on. Brother Brandham told us it's
[2:07:36] the devil.
[2:07:38] Come on. When Dolores told him that, his
[2:07:40] sister don't. He said it's the devil. He
[2:07:43] said Satan would take you tell you that
[2:07:45] until he takes you to hell. It's the
[2:07:48] devil. So, don't silence your praise.
[2:07:51] Amen. release it because no sacrifice
[2:07:55] touches God like the one you give
[2:07:58] through your pain. The Bible said in
[2:08:01] Revelation chapter 5 that we read that
[2:08:04] they that they held golden vials full of
[2:08:07] incense which are the prayers of the
[2:08:09] saints. Your prayers that are offered in
[2:08:12] faith are like incense. They're welcome
[2:08:16] before God. Let me tell you, every
[2:08:19] groan, every tear, every intercession is
[2:08:23] not
[2:08:24] lost. It's a
[2:08:26] sacrifice. Your prayers are not
[2:08:28] forgotten.
[2:08:31] Come on. Amen. If God can't get to him
[2:08:34] right now, and sometimes he
[2:08:36] can't, they're not forgotten. They're
[2:08:38] stored up.
[2:08:41] Amen. You remember when the seventh seal
[2:08:43] was open and there was there a you know
[2:08:47] a a bowl a vial with incense in it which
[2:08:52] were the prayers of the saints and when
[2:08:55] the silence was broken announcing the
[2:08:58] coming of the Lord.
[2:09:00] Come on. Opening up the seven seals
[2:09:03] starting the process of the end time
[2:09:05] redemption.
[2:09:06] Somebody with me. What happened? The
[2:09:08] prayers were poured out and ascended
[2:09:11] before God.
[2:09:13] Amen. As I've said over and again, what
[2:09:17] prayers? What prayers have been held up?
[2:09:21] What prayers through the ages? I'll tell
[2:09:24] you when little brothers and sisters sat
[2:09:27] there. Oh yeah. And there the great
[2:09:30] and her daughters would persecute
[2:09:33] the elect of God. Put them on ice until
[2:09:36] they would freeze there. and and
[2:09:38] standing naked out there to hours till
[2:09:40] they till they expired or hung on a
[2:09:43] cross or burnt there or women their hair
[2:09:47] dipped in tar and burned or their breast
[2:09:49] cut off or babies cut out of the womb.
[2:09:52] Horrible, horrible things. And as they
[2:09:55] were, no doubt the curses were spoke out
[2:09:59] against the Antichrist system
[2:10:03] and even they were held. God couldn't
[2:10:06] judge the then. He couldn't say,
[2:10:09] "Listen, listen. There's a word that
[2:10:12] that protects her. She's going to be in
[2:10:13] the tribulation."
[2:10:15] So, you can't speak her out of existence
[2:10:17] now.
[2:10:19] Come on. Amen. You can't speak her out
[2:10:22] of existence, but one day she'll be out
[2:10:24] of existence.
[2:10:26] Because those words, they're powerful
[2:10:29] words and they were stirred up and put
[2:10:32] in vials. Amen. But in the during the
[2:10:36] marriage supper of the lamb, one of the
[2:10:38] seven angels, which are men, will get up
[2:10:41] from the table and pour out those vials
[2:10:44] upon the earth. Amen. And there's going
[2:10:46] to be shout in heaven.
[2:10:49] And the saints around the table are
[2:10:51] going to praise God and glorify him
[2:10:54] because he had judged the great
[2:10:56] He had judged the antichrist. He has
[2:10:59] judged the false prophet.
[2:11:03] But there are prayers that are held up
[2:11:06] and they are there and been before the
[2:11:09] throne waiting for this hour. But
[2:11:13] friends, what prayers was it? Even the
[2:11:16] last prayer in the Bible. Even so, come
[2:11:20] Lord Jesus. And that prayer is still
[2:11:23] just as vibrant and powerful and
[2:11:27] fragrant even to this day. But he could
[2:11:31] not fulfill it then or you wouldn't have
[2:11:33] been in the picture.
[2:11:35] Come on. If he'd have called in the
[2:11:37] first days when John called that, you
[2:11:39] wouldn't have been here. But oh, he had
[2:11:41] to wait until the last name was manifest
[2:11:44] in the book.
[2:11:46] And it was the age for the book to be
[2:11:49] open and the word to be revealed. Are
[2:11:51] you with me? And it's there. Then the
[2:11:54] prayers of the saints
[2:11:56] get poured
[2:11:59] out and it initiates the coming of the
[2:12:02] Lord breaking the cycle bringing Christ
[2:12:06] in word form to a prophet and then that
[2:12:09] word taking on form and a bride and that
[2:12:12] bride united with Christ and go to the
[2:12:14] marriage of the supper of the lamb.
[2:12:18] Hallelujah. Every prayer, every prayer,
[2:12:22] every tear, your prayers are not
[2:12:25] forgotten. Amen. Psalms 56 says, "Every
[2:12:28] tear you cry is collected in a bottle.
[2:12:32] Not one is lost. Not one is shed in
[2:12:35] vain. Those prayers, those those tears
[2:12:39] you cried over over a dead loved one.
[2:12:43] that that that Satan would would through
[2:12:46] death would so crush it and and bring
[2:12:50] down to the earth and you wept and you
[2:12:52] cried over it. It wasn't in vain. Amen.
[2:12:56] It's stored in a battle. But one day
[2:12:59] those tears will be remembered and the
[2:13:03] dead in Christ shall rise first. And we
[2:13:06] which are alive and remain will not
[2:13:09] prevent those that are asleep.
[2:13:11] Oh, but they'll join the living and we
[2:13:14] will be changed in a moment, in a
[2:13:16] twinkling of an eye. Hallelujah. Right
[2:13:19] now, oh, thank God. Your prayers mean
[2:13:23] something to God. Your tears mean
[2:13:25] something to God. And you're a priest
[2:13:27] that are interceding between life and
[2:13:30] death.
[2:13:32] Your prayer cl closet is your altar. And
[2:13:36] every cry is of sacrifice.
[2:13:39] You're a living sacrifice,
[2:13:43] not a dead one, a living one. Your whole
[2:13:46] life is on the altar.
[2:13:49] Amen. Romans 12:1 said, "Present your
[2:13:51] bodies a living sacrifice,
[2:13:55] holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
[2:13:59] reasonable service." Did you notice he
[2:14:01] didn't say lay a lamb on the altar? He
[2:14:04] didn't say even lay Christ on the altar.
[2:14:08] Amen. But we lay ourselves on the altar.
[2:14:12] Remember, you know, yes, we accept his
[2:14:15] work in his atonement on the cross. We
[2:14:18] accept what he did and the sacrifice for
[2:14:20] our life. Truly, he is our sacrifice.
[2:14:24] Amen. But once we receive that, what
[2:14:27] were we told? Take up your cross.
[2:14:32] Become a sacrifice too.
[2:14:37] take up your cross. So we don't lay
[2:14:41] lambs on the altar. We lay
[2:14:44] ourselves on the altar.
[2:14:48] You see, that's what happens so many
[2:14:50] times with sinners. They want to live
[2:14:52] the same kind of life and be forgiven.
[2:14:56] You can't do that. You have to come and
[2:14:59] lay yourself on the altar with Christ,
[2:15:02] your sacrifice.
[2:15:04] and you also die on the altar with him
[2:15:08] so you can raise with him in a new life.
[2:15:12] You see, we don't lay lambs on the
[2:15:14] altar. We lay ourselves. We lay our
[2:15:16] time. We lay our choices. We lay our
[2:15:19] lifestyle. God doesn't want dead
[2:15:22] offerings. He wants a living surrender.
[2:15:27] Come on now. Amen. that the no longer is
[2:15:31] he accepting dead sacrifices. He wants a
[2:15:35] living sacrifice,
[2:15:38] a living surrender.
[2:15:40] A living sacrifice means everything I do
[2:15:42] is for his glory. A living sacrifice
[2:15:46] means it is not just on Sunday a Sunday
[2:15:49] offering, but it's a daily obedience. is
[2:15:52] not a one-time emotion, but it's our
[2:15:55] thoughts, our choices, our bodies, our
[2:15:57] desires must be placed on the altar. And
[2:16:00] Paul said, "I die daily. I do this
[2:16:04] daily." Amen. Amen. Oh yes. Listen, even
[2:16:10] holiness, we preach holiness.
[2:16:12] We preach that women shouldn't cut their
[2:16:14] hair, that they shouldn't look like
[2:16:16] Jezebels and paint their face. We we we
[2:16:19] we preach holiness and dress. We preach
[2:16:23] holiness in men. We don't believe they
[2:16:25] should smoke and drink and lie and
[2:16:27] corral and and go from bar hopping from
[2:16:30] place to place. Amen. We believe in
[2:16:32] holiness.
[2:16:34] Amen. Only holiness shall see the Lord.
[2:16:37] Holiness is a sacrifice. It's a
[2:16:39] beautiful sacrifice. Why do we dress the
[2:16:42] way we do? It's a sacrifice. Why don't
[2:16:44] our women wear cosmetics and look like
[2:16:47] the world? because it's a sacrifice to
[2:16:49] him. When we look for his approval
[2:16:52] instead of the world's approval,
[2:16:55] the world is always saying, "Put this
[2:16:57] on. You'll look better. You'll look 10
[2:16:59] years younger. You'll do this." But
[2:17:01] listen, you have a holy man's taste. You
[2:17:04] have a holy woman's dress. You look like
[2:17:07] a Christian. You begin to act and and
[2:17:10] reflect the place where you come from
[2:17:12] because your citizenship is of heaven.
[2:17:15] You look for his approval rather than
[2:17:18] the world's. Amen. Let's just talk about
[2:17:22] these sacrifices. We got just a little
[2:17:24] more time. Amen. But listen, Hebrews
[2:17:27] chapter 13 verse 16. But to do good and
[2:17:31] communicate, that means share. Forget
[2:17:34] not. For with such sacrifices God is
[2:17:38] well pleased.
[2:17:40] Sharing with one another, communicating.
[2:17:44] Do you realize fellowship is important?
[2:17:48] It's even a sacrifice.
[2:17:51] And the Bible said is a sacrifice well
[2:17:55] pleased. When you give to others, when
[2:17:58] you love the unlovable,
[2:18:02] when you forgive the
[2:18:04] undeserving, that's all a spiritual
[2:18:07] sacrifice. When you did you know when
[2:18:09] you tithe, brother Brandham said taking
[2:18:12] up an offering is a part of worship. You
[2:18:15] know where he got that from? He gets
[2:18:17] that from Philippians 4:18. He said I'm
[2:18:19] full having received the things which
[2:18:21] were sent from you. He said it's an odor
[2:18:24] of sweet smell as sacrifice acceptable
[2:18:29] well pleasing to God.
[2:18:32] Amen. What? When you gave your tithe and
[2:18:35] your offering, he called the given of
[2:18:37] the saints a sacrifice. It wasn't just
[2:18:40] charity. It was worship.
[2:18:45] Worship is surrendering to God's will.
[2:18:48] Jesus said surrendered, saying, "Let my
[2:18:50] will, thine be done." Every time you die
[2:18:54] to your will, when you submit to his,
[2:18:57] that's a holy sacrifice. is not always
[2:19:01] visible, but it's a powerful powerful
[2:19:03] sacrifice. Not my will, thine be done.
[2:19:07] That's where the deepest sacrifices
[2:19:09] happen. When the flesh dies and God
[2:19:12] still lives.
[2:19:14] Amen. Amen. You know, so many the flesh
[2:19:18] is still living and God is dead to them.
[2:19:21] But Jesus, we remember, he offered the
[2:19:24] most the greatest spiritual sacrifice in
[2:19:27] Gethsemane before he ever went to
[2:19:29] Goltha.
[2:19:31] All these
[2:19:33] sacrifices, they flow from the life of
[2:19:36] one who's who've been filled with the
[2:19:37] Holy Ghost. We're not just church
[2:19:41] members. We are priests in a spiritual
[2:19:44] house. We are offering
[2:19:46] sacrifices not on a stone altar but from
[2:19:50] a burning heart.
[2:19:52] I wonder today if we could just kind of
[2:19:56] look again at our worship and just say,
[2:19:59] "Oh God, would our worship be acceptable
[2:20:03] in your
[2:20:04] sight?" Would it be that like his cane,
[2:20:07] you know, his offering was rejected?
[2:20:11] You know, it was it was not accepted.
[2:20:14] And Abel's by revelation, his was
[2:20:18] accepted because he he he recognized he
[2:20:21] could see by revelation what it took to
[2:20:24] remit sin.
[2:20:26] Are you with me, church? His offering
[2:20:29] was accepted. Oh, I wonder today how
[2:20:33] many across the world, how many across
[2:20:35] the nation, how many and that many
[2:20:37] churches are offering today Cain's
[2:20:40] offering that is not accepted before
[2:20:42] God, fruits of the hands of their labor,
[2:20:45] of their works instead of the sacrifice
[2:20:49] well pleasing to God. I wonder if we can
[2:20:53] reconsider the way we worship, the way
[2:20:56] we come to church, the way we behave in
[2:20:58] church
[2:21:00] and get some real church order about us.
[2:21:05] Amen. The order of the Holy Spirit where
[2:21:07] you enter into his courts with praise.
[2:21:11] Where you lift up holy hands without
[2:21:14] fear or failure. Amen. Where where the
[2:21:16] weak can say, "I am strong." where the
[2:21:19] lame can put aside his lameness and walk
[2:21:22] straight. Amen. Where the crippled, I
[2:21:25] don't care if you're crippled because of
[2:21:27] complexes in your mind or because of
[2:21:29] your past where the crippled can be
[2:21:31] healed. Amen. There is healing in the
[2:21:34] house, but praise brings it down. I
[2:21:37] wonder is it not
[2:21:39] time that the church returns in a
[2:21:43] revival of restoration of praise unto
[2:21:47] God and we praise his holy name. I
[2:21:50] wonder if we could mirror this morning
[2:21:53] the praise of the prophet of God. Amen.
[2:21:57] Who went through and spoke of all of
[2:21:59] those things showing you how as a
[2:22:01] musicians come and you stand. Oh, I want
[2:22:04] you today, lift up holy hands to him.
[2:22:09] Hallelujah.
[2:22:10] Amen. Not a timid voice.
[2:22:13] Amen. Oh, but sound out a praise to him.
[2:22:18] Not out of because you feel like it. But
[2:22:21] because you are a priest.
[2:22:24] Hallelujah. Because as a king, he has
[2:22:27] given me dominion over sin. He has given
[2:22:29] me dominion over unrighteousness. Amen.
[2:22:32] You can look at and say, "He gave me
[2:22:34] dominion over pornography, over
[2:22:36] fornication, over the wrong thoughts.
[2:22:39] He's given me dominion over all sin, all
[2:22:42] wickedness. He has empowered me as a
[2:22:44] king. Amen. He's my king this morning.
[2:22:48] He's king of kings and he's lord of
[2:22:50] lords. He is alpha and he's omega. He's
[2:22:53] the beginning. He's the end. He's the
[2:22:55] root and he's the offspring. He's the
[2:22:58] bright and he's the morning star. and he
[2:23:00] deserves our praise. And if we're going
[2:23:02] to be worshiping there in heaven, we
[2:23:05] might as well worship him now on the
[2:23:07] earth.
[2:23:09] Hallelujah.
[2:23:11] Praise him from the depths of your
[2:23:13] heart. Praise him with everything that's
[2:23:16] within you. Let everything that breathes
[2:23:19] breath praise ye the Lord. Praise him.
[2:23:24] Praise him. Hallelujah. Don't stop now.
[2:23:28] Amen. Don't stop now. Amen. Is he
[2:23:32] worthy? Amen. Can you get a look at him?
[2:23:36] The one who took your punishment. Can
[2:23:38] you get a look at him? The one who
[2:23:40] healed your wound. Amen. Can you get a
[2:23:43] look at him? The one who healed all your
[2:23:45] diseases. Amen. Can you bring heaven
[2:23:48] down into this church this morning?
[2:23:51] Amen. Can you bring down the gates of
[2:23:54] hell where the gates of hell will not
[2:23:56] stand against a people who praise his
[2:23:59] name? Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:24:03] Hallelujah. Forget not all of his
[2:24:05] benefit. He heals all diseases. Amen. He
[2:24:08] restores the youth like the eagle.
[2:24:11] Hallelujah. This is a restoring God.
[2:24:14] It's a restoring time. It's time for
[2:24:17] revival in your heart. Amen. Call upon
[2:24:20] his name and he will give you the
[2:24:22] desires of your heart. God bless you.
[2:24:25] Hallelujah. Thank you
[2:24:27] Jesus.
[2:24:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:24:50] Let the weak say I am strong.
[2:24:56] Let the poor say I am
[2:25:02] rich. Let the blind say I can
[2:25:08] see what the
[2:25:11] Lord has done for me. Let the weak Let
[2:25:16] the weak say I am strong.
[2:25:22] Let the poor say I am
[2:25:27] rich. Let the blind say I can see.
[2:25:34] It's what the Lord has done me.
[2:25:43] Hosana.
[2:25:45] Hosana to the
[2:25:49] lamb thou was
[2:25:52] slain.
[2:25:55] Hosana.
[2:25:58] Hosana. Jesus
[2:26:00] died and
[2:26:04] roan. Hosana.
[2:26:07] [Music]
[2:26:10] Hosanana to the
[2:26:13] lamb that was
[2:26:16] slain.
[2:26:19] Hosana
[2:26:22] hosana
[2:26:24] Jesus and into the river I will wait. To
[2:26:29] the
[2:26:31] river I will wait.
[2:26:35] Bear my
[2:26:37] sins are washed
[2:26:40] away from the
[2:26:43] heavens. Mercy
[2:26:46] strange of the
[2:26:49] saint's love for
[2:26:52] me.
[2:26:55] Hosana
[2:26:58] hosana to the
[2:27:01] lamb. Oh that was slain.
[2:27:04] [Music]
[2:27:07] Hosana. Hosana.
