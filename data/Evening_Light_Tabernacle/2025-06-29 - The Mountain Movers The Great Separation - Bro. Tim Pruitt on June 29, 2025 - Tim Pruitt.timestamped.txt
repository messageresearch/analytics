[16:08] Amen. Ask brother Joe to open the
[16:10] service for us in prayer. Want to
[16:12] remember to pray for brother Ron Spencer
[16:15] this morning. Just continue to need a
[16:18] touch in his body and healing from the
[16:21] sickness. Also strength from the regimen
[16:24] that he's on to recover. Also want to
[16:27] remember brother Ben Coleman again this
[16:29] morning as he recovers from his surgery
[16:32] and it needs a touch in his body.
[16:34] Brother Daryl Baxter is back here this
[16:37] morning, but he needs prayer as well.
[16:40] Amen. Amen. And each one that has a
[16:42] need, you just want to lift to the Lord
[16:44] and ask him to come by our way this
[16:46] morning. Amen. He's more than able.
[16:49] Let's go to him together in prayer with
[16:51] brother Jim.
[16:56] God bless you, church. Glad to be in the
[16:58] house of the Lord this morning.
[17:00] Are you glad to be in the house of the
[17:01] Lord this morning? All right. Wonderful.
[17:04] Well, we just bring you greetings from
[17:06] the church there in San Diego. We had
[17:08] some tremendous meetings this past
[17:09] weekend. Brother Andrew Spencer, myself,
[17:11] and I was discussing with Brother
[17:13] Johnny. He's the translator, the one
[17:15] that was here back for our meetings. And
[17:17] he mentioned to me something that um he
[17:20] said, you know, Brother Joe, you and
[17:22] Brother Andrew were saying some things
[17:23] and minister on some things that we've
[17:25] never saw it like that before.
[17:28] You know, you was talking about
[17:29] adoption. You was talking about the Holy
[17:31] Spirit. Y'all both were ministering on
[17:32] the same lines. He goes, "We've never
[17:34] seen it like that." that I said that's
[17:36] because you're coming into the opening
[17:37] of the word, church. That church is
[17:40] coming into the opening of the word.
[17:42] They're hearing things that they've
[17:43] never heard before. And I want you to
[17:45] know even like Tabernacle, you have a
[17:47] part to play in that because brother
[17:49] Tim's been pouring into Brother Johnny
[17:51] and myself has been pouring into Brother
[17:52] Johnny and the church there. And God's
[17:54] doing the miraculous things. We had a
[17:56] great time and just want you to, you
[17:58] know, to know what's going on out there
[17:59] and that we go and we we go as a a
[18:02] testimony of even an extension of the
[18:05] church here and been able to bring them
[18:07] into a furtherance of the ministry of
[18:09] the gospel. So if you have a need this
[18:11] morning, just uplifted hand, God is here
[18:13] to meet that need. We've seen God move
[18:16] this past weekend. Father, we just come
[18:18] into your presence this morning, Lord,
[18:20] and want to say thank you for the grace
[18:22] that you've extended to each of us,
[18:24] Lord. Thank you for your mercy, Father,
[18:26] and for saving us when we were
[18:27] unsavable. Lord, when it seems like,
[18:29] Lord, mankind may be given up on us.
[18:31] But, Father, your hand reached down and
[18:34] lifted us up, Father. And we're so
[18:36] honored today to be your children, Lord,

[18:45] but Father, our where our faith is

[19:18] Lord, we just thank you for that. And
[19:20] God, we bring some needs to you tonight.
[19:22] Brother Ben Coleman, Lord, suffering,
[19:24] needing a real touch, Lord, not only in
[19:27] his body, but Lord, in his spirit. We
[19:30] ask that you would minister a healing to
[19:31] him, God. He's been a faithful servant,
[19:34] Lord. And he's been under the attack for
[19:36] the last several weeks. And we just
[19:38] asking that, God, you'd go to him right
[19:40] now, wherever he's at, Lord. And may you
[19:42] just minister healing, Lord God, to him,
[19:45] Lord, to his back, to the situations in
[19:48] his body and his mind, Lord. restore him
[19:50] to perfect health and strength. Father,

[19:59] from this surgery as well. Lord, and
[20:02] every hand that was lifted to you, may
[20:04] you just, God, come down and search the
[20:07] heart, Lord. You see the need, may you
[20:09] touch it, Lord God, today. And Lord,
[20:12] break the bread of life to us, Father.
[20:13] As brother Tim would come and minister
[20:16] the word, Lord. May you just speak to
[20:18] our hearts today, Lord, as we lift our
[20:20] cups up, Father, and ask that you would
[20:22] fill us a fresh and a new. We commit
[20:24] this service to you now, Lord, in Jesus'
[20:26] name. Amen.

[25:30] wonderful babies that God entrusts us
[25:33] with. And um we we have to be examples
[25:38] um and we set examples before them

[25:48] doing that. Amen. I'm so thankful for
[25:51] this family. They're beautiful family.

[38:33] Paul and Silas were beaten with rods,
[38:38] thrown into prison
[38:40] because they prayed for a girl and cast
[38:42] a demon out of her.
[38:45] The priests weren't too happy with that.
[38:48] But what did they do?
[38:51] They lifted up their hands and about
[38:52] midnight, they started praising the Lord
[38:54] and started singing hymns. And all the
[38:56] other prisoners were looking on and
[38:59] listening in. And around midnight, that
[39:01] great earthquake came.

[50:41] Let's just raise our hands and worship
[50:43] him right now from the depths of our
[50:46] heart. Lord,
[50:49] we want to express our love to you,
[50:51] Lord.
[50:53] Oh, you're our advocate, our sin bearer.
[50:57] Lord, our deliverer, our savior.
[51:01] It is you, Lord, that we worship today.
[51:04] We have come to adore you, for thou art
[51:08] worthy.
[51:09] I pray, oh God, your blessings upon your
[51:12] children today as we in turn bless your
[51:16] name and hold it high and holy. How
[51:21] wonderful you are, Lord. How great is
[51:24] thy faithfulness.
[51:26] How wonderful is your mercies, Lord. We
[51:29] love you today and we thank you for your
[51:32] goodness. Thank you for grace, Lord. The
[51:36] favor of God on our lives, the
[51:38] forgiveness of sin,
[51:40] oh God, how wonderful, how marvelous you
[51:45] are. We're looking to you today, oh God,
[51:48] to speak to us now through the word. Oh
[51:52] God, we have sung the songs. The
[51:55] children have worshiped you. And God,
[51:58] we've all just come in unity of the
[52:02] faith. Lord, acknowledging you as our
[52:04] Lord and asking now that you would just
[52:08] say something special to us today that
[52:12] you would speak to hearts and lives,
[52:15] Lord, that the soul that is the coldest,
[52:19] the further away that you would bring
[52:21] them in, Lord, to the fire,
[52:24] Lord, those that have the heartbeat of
[52:27] the love of God that it would just be
[52:30] blowed upon today and it would just
[52:33] burst into higher flame. Oh God, the
[52:37] word, oh God, the wood of the word
[52:40] placed upon that flame so that it would
[52:43] feed it, that it would go higher and
[52:45] higher. We're your children, Lord. We
[52:48] need you, Lord. We recognize we're here
[52:52] in the last days. And Father, we want to
[52:55] make our calling and election sure. We
[52:57] want to know where we stand. And I just
[53:00] pray God that the word as it goes forth
[53:03] that it'll just speak to hearts and
[53:06] it'll just reveal your character, Lord,
[53:08] it'll just cause those that are
[53:11] faithless to have a new faith. And those
[53:15] that have faith that it would move up a
[53:18] higher level into a rapturing faith. Oh
[53:22] God, we're your children. And we're just
[53:24] asking for you to come now. Move me
[53:27] aside, Lord. I ask that this not be
[53:30] mechanical. I ask Lord that it'll be the
[53:34] dynamic power of God with the uncction
[53:37] of the Holy Spirit that I might speak as
[53:40] a true oracle of God in Jesus name. Heal
[53:45] your children, Lord. There are those
[53:46] that are sick and needy. There are those
[53:48] that are listening in today that they've
[53:50] got special needs in their lives and
[53:53] maybe they feel forgotten and abandoned.
[53:56] May you they be assured Lord by the word
[54:00] the same word that where where you would
[54:02] say Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[54:05] today and forever continues on saying
[54:08] I'll never leave you or forsake you. So
[54:11] may that word of promise be real to them
[54:14] today in the name of Jesus we ask him.
[54:17] Amen and amen. God bless you. It's good
[54:21] to be in the house of the Lord today.
[54:23] We're going to have a water baptism
[54:25] today. And in the name of the Lord Jesus
[54:28] Christ, we have brother Gabe here is
[54:30] going to be baptized in the name of the
[54:32] Lord Jesus. Amen. How wonderful that is
[54:36] that we commit our lives to serve the
[54:39] Lord. It just takes a it just takes a
[54:41] full surrender to him and a yielding of
[54:44] our lives and to the grace of God. Amen.
[54:47] And God is good to us. Gives us so many
[54:50] blessings. Amen. I was able to greet
[54:53] brother Jude Murray just before this
[54:55] service and he reminds me so much of his
[54:58] dad and and you know his dad was the one
[55:01] that I tell you about picked me up and
[55:03] danced around with my feet dangling
[55:06] after I accepted the invitation to come
[55:08] to New Zealand some many many years ago
[55:11] and and um you know brother Neil Murray
[55:14] was he was a treasure. We loved him. We
[55:17] appreciated him and his love for the
[55:19] Lord. Went moved on to Australia from
[55:21] there and now moved on to glory. You
[55:24] know, u the older I get, the more
[55:26] friends I have on the other side. Amen.
[55:29] And you know, so many have went before
[55:32] us, but we're we're about to catch up.
[55:35] They're going to come here and we'll be
[55:37] have a great year reunion. What a
[55:39] wonderful time that will be. Luke chap
[55:42] 21 verse 34. And as you're turning
[55:45] there, I'm reminding you of our theme
[55:48] there. Who art thou, oh great mountain?
[55:51] Thou shalt become a plain, and the
[55:53] headstone shall be brought forth with
[55:55] shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it.
[56:00] Verse 34 of Luke chap 21. and take heed
[56:05] to yourselves, lest at any time your
[56:09] hearts be overcharged with surfing and
[56:12] drunkenness and the cares of this life.
[56:16] So that that day come on you unawares.
[56:19] For as a snare, that's a trap, shall it
[56:23] come on all them that dwell on the face
[56:26] of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore
[56:29] and pray always that you may be
[56:31] accounted worthy to escape all these
[56:35] things that shall come to pass and to
[56:38] stand before the son of man. God bless
[56:40] you. Can have your seats.
[56:44] I want to speak today on the great
[56:47] separation
[56:49] and we are taking the scripture that we
[56:53] have um read from today um where it has
[56:59] the command to watch
[57:02] and it's linked to being alert you know
[57:05] to spiritual dangers and the signs of
[57:08] the times and avoiding the spiritual
[57:11] complacency or being weighed down by
[57:14] worldly cares.
[57:16] You know each age the prophet told us
[57:18] has its pressures and he said for
[57:20] example a great burden of this last age
[57:23] would be the pressure of riches and
[57:26] self-living and nervous tensions in a
[57:29] complex age that we seem unfitted to
[57:32] live in. And yet in the face of this we
[57:37] will overcome.
[57:39] And we will overcome by the dynamic
[57:41] power of God because the capstone comes
[57:44] with grace. Grace so that this mountain
[57:48] of lukewarm and complacency can be
[57:52] overcome. And this is our mountain, you
[57:55] know, and we can't climb over it and we
[57:58] can't bur bury underneath it. And and as
[58:02] I said, we can't get over it. nor can it
[58:06] nor can can we somehow by human means uh
[58:12] push it aside but it can only be
[58:14] overcome supernaturally.
[58:18] Brother Brandham tells us in God's
[58:19] provided place of worship he said notice
[58:22] when this great moving power of God
[58:24] comes into the son of God it quickens
[58:26] him the spirit of life enters into him.
[58:29] Then what does it do? It seats him in
[58:32] heavenly places right now. Not that they
[58:34] will be. We are now. Now we're already
[58:37] resurrected. The dynamics and the
[58:39] mechanics has gone to work. Quickens us.
[58:41] And we're quickened up into the presence
[58:43] of God where his spirit is. And now
[58:46] we're seated together in heavenly places
[58:49] in Christ Jesus. Sitting in there, that
[58:52] great seat that's already fired up, been
[58:56] raised from the dead. And we're part of
[58:58] it. If you're a part of the bride, you
[59:00] are because the bride is a part of the
[59:01] groom, you know. So we find out that
[59:03] it's the same thing. She'll do exactly
[59:05] what's predicted for her to do in this
[59:08] day. She won't be a Leodysa.
[59:13] Not by no means a lukewarm, but she'll
[59:16] be on fire for God. She'll be moving on
[59:19] in the spirit of God. Now, you know, I'm
[59:22] going to be speaking on some things
[59:24] today, and they, you know, I will just
[59:26] say, if the shoe fits, own it. If the
[59:29] shoe don't fit, well, pass it on. So you
[59:32] know you you decide this morning even
[59:35] what portions of this uh uh that is that
[59:39] is being given is for you because that's
[59:42] what you have to do. It's a personal
[59:43] walk. And so when we are speaking
[59:46] sometimes we will speak um
[59:48] evangelistically to the world or maybe
[59:51] to all message churches or sometimes to
[59:54] the local church and which includes
[59:56] everybody and then sometimes to it
[59:59] becomes very individualized.
[1:00:01] So again I I want you to just take to
[1:00:05] heart the things that that you believe
[1:00:08] that the spirit is urging you to uh to
[1:00:13] address. Now, we're living, of course,
[1:00:15] in the time of harvest when separation
[1:00:18] is taking place. The tears and the
[1:00:22] lukewarm and those that are merely
[1:00:25] pretending to be the wheat are being
[1:00:28] bound together for the judgment. And at
[1:00:31] the same time, the true grain, and I
[1:00:33] hope we can identify ourselves as that.
[1:00:36] Amen. that the the true grain, the
[1:00:39] genuine spiritfilled believers, they are
[1:00:42] also being separated not only from the
[1:00:45] tears but also from the lifeless husk
[1:00:49] and the outward forms that lack the life
[1:00:52] of God. and and what follows the
[1:00:55] forerunner. If you notice the life of
[1:00:57] John the Baptist and and and his message
[1:01:00] as he declared of him that cometh after
[1:01:03] me that we know that what follows the
[1:01:06] forerunner
[1:01:08] the prophet like Elijah is the one
[1:01:11] mighter than he which is Jesus Christ
[1:01:14] and and of course who comes not just
[1:01:16] with water but with the Holy Ghost and
[1:01:19] fire and he thoroughly purges his
[1:01:22] threshing floor and this is not a casual
[1:01:25] shifting or or sifting, I mean, but but
[1:01:28] a a complete and and divine separation.
[1:01:32] And he gathers the true grain, the the
[1:01:35] spirit field, the word anchored
[1:01:38] believers by rapturing them into his
[1:01:41] garner, his eternal storehouse. But the
[1:01:45] chaff, the empty husk, those who were
[1:01:49] mere professors
[1:01:51] um have no life in them but are left
[1:01:54] behind and burned with unquenchable
[1:01:56] fire. And this is the baptism of fire
[1:02:00] that purges and consumes and reveals
[1:02:03] what is real and what is not. And and I
[1:02:07] just want to tell you the time of
[1:02:10] pretending is over.
[1:02:13] The time of purging has begun. And and I
[1:02:17] want to review as we have been through
[1:02:19] in the past sermons that I've spoke on
[1:02:22] the parable of the swer which I believe
[1:02:25] is a prophecy of this last day that we
[1:02:29] want to remember that the swer of the
[1:02:31] good seed is the son of man, Jesus
[1:02:34] himself. And the field represents the
[1:02:37] world because from every nation,
[1:02:40] kindred, tongue, and people, the gospel
[1:02:42] has went out to call a bride for him.
[1:02:46] And the good seed are the children of
[1:02:48] the kingdom. Those born of God that are
[1:02:53] true believers. And I believe God's
[1:02:55] going to have some in this day. And the
[1:02:58] tears are the children of the wicked
[1:03:00] one. They are counterfeit believers or
[1:03:03] the unrighteous. And the enemy that so
[1:03:06] deterior is the devil. Satan of course
[1:03:09] actively works to corrupt God's um field
[1:03:13] and and uh to sew his own seed. And the
[1:03:16] harvest represents the end of of the
[1:03:20] world or the age. And the reapers are
[1:03:23] the angels which are God's agents of
[1:03:26] judgment and separation. And I would say
[1:03:29] some of them of course are heavenly
[1:03:31] influence and some of them are men upon
[1:03:34] the earth. God's angels that he sends
[1:03:37] forth as reapers.
[1:03:42] And just as the terrors are gathered and
[1:03:44] burned in the fire, so it will be at the
[1:03:47] end of the world. And that's a clear
[1:03:50] warning of the final judgment. Now, so
[1:03:54] the Bible tells you and I want you to uh
[1:03:57] view this scripture real carefully today
[1:04:00] in Matthew chapter 13:E 30 where he
[1:04:04] says, "Let both grow together until the
[1:04:08] harvest. And in the time of harvest, I
[1:04:10] will say to the reapers, gather ye
[1:04:13] together first the tears and bind them
[1:04:15] in bundles to burn them, but gather the
[1:04:19] wheat into my barn."
[1:04:21] So as we see this, we want to take
[1:04:25] careful note. It's in the time of
[1:04:26] harvest. You know, it's not only the
[1:04:29] tears that are being separated, those
[1:04:32] that are clearly identified as the
[1:04:34] children of the wicked one, but also the
[1:04:37] chaff is being separated. You see, the
[1:04:41] terrors never were of God. But the chaff
[1:04:44] is something far more sobering. You see,
[1:04:48] the chaff once had the life of the
[1:04:50] spirit in it, and it was once a part of
[1:04:54] the wheat, but the life did not remain.
[1:04:58] These are they that have grieved the
[1:05:00] spirit and quenched the flame and and
[1:05:03] are now standing um spiritually dead and
[1:05:07] dry and void of the Holy Ghost. They're
[1:05:10] like the foolish virgins. They once
[1:05:13] burned with oil. The Bible said their
[1:05:15] lamps had went out and they but they had
[1:05:18] once burned with fire, but now their
[1:05:20] lamps are gone out and and their their
[1:05:22] their fire is faded and they've become
[1:05:25] lukewarm
[1:05:27] and they're neither cold nor hot and but
[1:05:29] they're few, you know, they're fit only
[1:05:31] to be spewed out as a group will be
[1:05:35] specifically spoke of in our church age,
[1:05:37] the Leodysian church age, you know,
[1:05:40] spewed out because these are too
[1:05:42] separated from on the grain. And the the
[1:05:46] terrors of course are bound for
[1:05:48] damnation. They're the children of the
[1:05:50] wicked one, swung by the devil and
[1:05:52] destined for wrath. The chaff once a
[1:05:55] carrier of the life, but now without it
[1:05:58] is cast into the fire of judgment. Some
[1:06:02] of these will go through the fiery trial
[1:06:05] of the tribulation and be purged during
[1:06:07] that time and and find uh find mercy
[1:06:11] somehow at the great tribulation or the
[1:06:14] great judgment ahead, the white throne
[1:06:16] judgment. But all will face unquenchable
[1:06:19] fire. Some in the fiery trial of
[1:06:22] tribulation and others in the final
[1:06:25] judgment of God. But the wheat, the
[1:06:28] true, the spiritfilled bride is gathered
[1:06:31] into his garner. The separation, I want
[1:06:35] to tell you friends, it's happening
[1:06:37] right now. The threshing floor is an
[1:06:40] active floor. We're not in the season of
[1:06:43] the long growth of the church ages. We
[1:06:46] are now in the season of the great
[1:06:48] harvest. And there there the threshing
[1:06:51] floor is active and being purged. And
[1:06:54] the fire is coming. Amen. Now in this
[1:06:57] profound parable, Jesus the son of man,
[1:07:01] he reveals a prophetic timeline that
[1:07:04] would happen or would span through seven
[1:07:07] gentile church ages. The kingdom of
[1:07:09] heaven, the realm of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:12] would begin as a seed,
[1:07:15] you know, planted by Christ himself. And
[1:07:18] that seed, pure and undefiled, was the
[1:07:22] original word. But immediately an enemy
[1:07:26] sowed a counterfeit seed, a tear into
[1:07:30] the same field. And the results, two
[1:07:33] kinds of seeds, the wheat and the tears
[1:07:37] growing side by side in the same visible
[1:07:41] field. I want you to understand the root
[1:07:44] was different and so would be the fruit.
[1:07:48] But here they will grow side by side.
[1:07:52] Let me bring it down to home. In the
[1:07:54] same time, in the same movements, in the
[1:07:59] same age, in the same church,
[1:08:07] in the same
[1:08:10] movement,
[1:08:12] now Jesus reveals the mystery of the
[1:08:15] kingdom that the gospel wouldn't come to
[1:08:18] fullness all at once, but like a seed,
[1:08:21] it would be planted and it would go
[1:08:22] through stages of growth. growth until
[1:08:24] the harvest. And the son of man, Christ
[1:08:28] himself, was the swer and he planted the
[1:08:30] original seed word at Pentecost.
[1:08:34] And he produced a spiritfilled church
[1:08:37] that bore the pure life of God. How many
[1:08:40] believes that? Amen. But while men
[1:08:43] slept, an enemy came and swed his tears.
[1:08:47] It was a counterfeit word. It was a
[1:08:49] false gospel. It was an imitation life
[1:08:53] that appeared similar but lacked the
[1:08:56] divine nature of the true seed. The
[1:08:59] apostle Paul saw himself as one of those
[1:09:03] early seed swowers under the ministry of
[1:09:06] the son of man who was the chief seed
[1:09:09] swower. He labored not just as a
[1:09:11] preacher but he saw himself as a
[1:09:13] planter. He laid the foundation of the
[1:09:16] word among the Gentiles. He didn't seek
[1:09:19] to reform the the old old system and the
[1:09:23] law of Moses. No, he didn't do that. He
[1:09:26] separated law from grace. It was a time
[1:09:30] of separation.
[1:09:32] It was a great separation where he
[1:09:34] separated law from grace and and showed
[1:09:37] the fulfillment of the law and the
[1:09:39] prophets in the gospel of Christ. And he
[1:09:42] planted the original gospel in virgin
[1:09:46] soil. Yeah. Hallelujah. He said in 1
[1:09:50] Corinthians 3:6, "I have planted.
[1:09:52] Apollos watered, but God gave the
[1:09:54] increase." He laid a foundation as a
[1:09:58] master builder. He planted the original
[1:10:02] seed, the same seed Jesus spoke of, the
[1:10:06] pure apostolic word of God. That same
[1:10:10] produced
[1:10:12] a church that was like Christ. Amen.
[1:10:16] That early church was filled with the
[1:10:18] spirit, walking in power, living in
[1:10:21] holiness. It was a virgin word bride who
[1:10:25] remained pure and unadulterated
[1:10:29] for a time.
[1:10:32] But then came the enemy,
[1:10:38] Satan,
[1:10:40] and he swed a perverted seed
[1:10:43] right in the same field.
[1:10:49] And Jesus foreseeing the deception, he
[1:10:52] said, "Let them both grow together
[1:10:55] until the harvest."
[1:10:58] So he actually gave permission for these
[1:11:02] to grow side by side
[1:11:06] in the same movement in the same church.
[1:11:10] Are you with me? Amen. So you said let
[1:11:13] them grow both grow together into the
[1:11:15] harvest. And here's the mystery of the
[1:11:18] kingdom of heaven, the realm of the Holy
[1:11:19] Ghost. And we that that there are two
[1:11:24] vines in the church. Not one, two.
[1:11:29] Amen. Two vines. And we must discern,
[1:11:33] recognize, and withstand the spirit of
[1:11:36] the Antichrist.
[1:11:37] Now, we're living in a time when
[1:11:39] spiritual discernment is not optional.
[1:11:41] It's vital. Amen. There must be a Holy
[1:11:45] Ghost awaken called to recognize and
[1:11:48] resist the spirit of the antichrist that
[1:11:51] would make the church lukewarm and
[1:11:53] formal and powerless. And when we do,
[1:11:56] when we stand in the light of truth and
[1:11:58] we expose the lie of the devil, then
[1:12:01] Satan loses his power over us. And this
[1:12:05] is a foundational truth. The enemy can
[1:12:07] only operate where he is not discerned
[1:12:10] and withtood.
[1:12:12] But when we recognize his presence, when
[1:12:15] we identify what he is, and let me tell
[1:12:19] you, this is the age, this is a time
[1:12:22] where everything has to be identified,
[1:12:25] where you see what was actually really
[1:12:28] planted. Are you with me? And all
[1:12:31] spiritual matters, yes, all religion,
[1:12:33] they're they're rooted or they're all
[1:12:36] rooted in one of these two opposing
[1:12:38] forces. And these forces, they're not
[1:12:41] always obvious. No. No. They often
[1:12:44] appear to grow in the same soil. They
[1:12:48] look alike in structure. They speak the
[1:12:50] same language. They share the same
[1:12:53] quotes. They read the same Bible. But
[1:12:56] don't be deceived. They bear entirely
[1:12:59] different fruit.
[1:13:02] One of them is the spirit of Christ. And
[1:13:04] the other is the spirit of the
[1:13:06] Antichrist.
[1:13:07] I know this is hard, but let me tell
[1:13:10] you, one is truth, the other is
[1:13:13] deception. One produces a living bride,
[1:13:16] the other reproduces the harlot system.
[1:13:19] Denominational Christians who are only
[1:13:22] benchwarmers.
[1:13:26] Let me tell you plainly, the fruit of
[1:13:28] the true grain,
[1:13:30] hear me now, the fruit of the true grain
[1:13:35] is a burning love for the spirit and
[1:13:38] truth.
[1:13:41] It longs for holiness.
[1:13:43] It longs for communion with God and for
[1:13:46] a living word. Oh my. not to adorn your
[1:13:51] walls in a collection but to be made
[1:13:53] flesh
[1:13:55] to live in you. But the fruit of the
[1:13:58] tear is different. It loves this shell
[1:14:01] of religion.
[1:14:02] It clings to ritual and form and to
[1:14:05] intellectualism and to the safe and you
[1:14:08] know sanitized version of Christianity.
[1:14:11] It it's content with just tradition
[1:14:15] ceremony performance.
[1:14:18] You know, it it gives a lukewarm nod to
[1:14:21] the spirit but has no hunger for its
[1:14:24] fire.
[1:14:26] Let me tell you, this is the hour we
[1:14:28] must discern. And don't be fooled by
[1:14:31] appearances. What looks like wheat may
[1:14:34] have no life in it. What sounds like
[1:14:36] truth may have the echo of lies. The
[1:14:40] spirit and the word agree. They're
[1:14:41] calling out a people who will not bow to
[1:14:44] the image of man-made religion but will
[1:14:48] stand in the fire and will shine like
[1:14:50] the son of God. So while the sin and
[1:14:54] rebellion of course we know it began in
[1:14:57] heaven on earth
[1:15:00] its origin was in Eden. Let's visit Eden
[1:15:03] for a moment. In the very center of that
[1:15:07] beautiful place,
[1:15:10] in the very center of it were two trees.
[1:15:17] There was the tree of life. You know
[1:15:20] what that was? It was a symbol of Christ
[1:15:22] and the living word made flesh and it
[1:15:25] represent the the the unfiltered spirit
[1:15:28] breathed life of God. That's what it
[1:15:31] represented.
[1:15:32] And then on the other hand, there was a
[1:15:34] tree of knowledge of good and evil, a
[1:15:37] symbol of religion without the spirit,
[1:15:40] truth contaminated with error, a mixture
[1:15:43] of light and darkness, deadly precisely
[1:15:46] because it seemed so right, so good. It
[1:15:51] was so appealing.
[1:15:56] They're branches. Brother Brandham tells
[1:15:58] us in the church ages they likely
[1:16:01] intertwined,
[1:16:02] you know, interwoven together forming
[1:16:05] the same canopy.
[1:16:10] So you could be there under the shade of
[1:16:12] both of them.
[1:16:15] But make no mistake, one gave eternal
[1:16:18] life and the other brought death.
[1:16:22] And this ancient pattern repeats itself
[1:16:24] through the Bible. and right on down
[1:16:27] into the New Testament church continued
[1:16:29] right down to this present age. It, my
[1:16:32] friends, is the trail of the serpent.
[1:16:36] Now, let me tell you that ancient
[1:16:39] conflict did not end in Eden. It walked
[1:16:42] right down into the church.
[1:16:46] Remember, they were God's church
[1:16:49] in Eden.
[1:16:52] Come on. That was God's cathedral
[1:16:56] and two trees were growing in it.
[1:17:01] And the battle of of the two trees
[1:17:04] became the battle of the two seeds.
[1:17:07] Yeah, cuz you see right then, right
[1:17:12] after, you know, right there, right from
[1:17:14] the knowledge from that evil one, right
[1:17:17] from the knowledge, the he would call it
[1:17:20] revelation passed on from the serpent.
[1:17:24] It was sown in the womb of Eve, both a
[1:17:29] Cain and an Abel.
[1:17:32] Think of that. two sons, two altars, two
[1:17:36] worshippers, but only one born of
[1:17:38] revelation.
[1:17:40] The Bible says, "Not as Cain who was of
[1:17:42] that wicked one." Cain, he was actually
[1:17:46] misidentified
[1:17:48] by Eve as a man from the Lord and was
[1:17:52] rejected by God. You see, Abel,
[1:17:56] you know, accepted. Why? Because only
[1:18:00] one had the life of the word.
[1:18:03] And that pattern continued in Abraham's
[1:18:06] household. There were two sons. There
[1:18:08] was Ishmamail born of doubt and human
[1:18:10] effort. Oh my. I wonder how many even
[1:18:14] today are born of doubt and human
[1:18:16] effort.
[1:18:19] Come on. Amen. And Isaac born by faith
[1:18:23] and of a supernatural promise. His birth
[1:18:26] was supernatural.
[1:18:29] Amen. So must be the birth of the
[1:18:31] church, not our human efforts of trying
[1:18:34] to live right and do right and dress
[1:18:36] right and act right and conform. You can
[1:18:39] put anybody in the uniform of a
[1:18:41] Christian. That don't make them a
[1:18:43] Christian.
[1:18:44] Amen. You've got to be born again by the
[1:18:46] Holy Spirit and your life transformed by
[1:18:50] a new birth.
[1:18:52] Amen. Notice this. As I said, there was
[1:18:56] Isaac born by faith and of the promise.
[1:18:59] And here it comes to its head. It
[1:19:01] actually comes to time when the grown
[1:19:03] when when when Ishmael is grown up and
[1:19:06] the word comes cast out the bondswoman
[1:19:09] and her son for the son of the
[1:19:11] bondswoman shall not be heir with the
[1:19:14] son of the free woman.
[1:19:17] You see this prompted the prophet of God
[1:19:19] in this age to to declare the seed shall
[1:19:23] not be heir with the shuck.
[1:19:27] Come on. The plant though a carrier of
[1:19:30] the life will not go in the garner.
[1:19:34] I'm going to deal with it for a little
[1:19:36] bit today. You cannot go on the your
[1:19:39] past.
[1:19:41] It ain't how you used to be with God and
[1:19:44] where you was once with God. It's what
[1:19:47] are you now?
[1:19:50] Right?
[1:19:52] We're going to have to really look at
[1:19:53] oursel and examine oursel in the
[1:19:55] scripture as the Bible said, "Examine
[1:19:58] yourself to see if you're in the faith."
[1:20:02] Let he that thinkketh he stand take heed
[1:20:04] lest he fall. It's a moment of checking
[1:20:07] up.
[1:20:09] Now
[1:20:11] Isaac was accepted. The seed of the
[1:20:14] promise Ishmael was cast out the seed of
[1:20:16] the flesh. One born by the will of man,
[1:20:19] the other by the will of God. And the
[1:20:22] divide is always the same. We we we can
[1:20:25] see it continue right on in Esau and
[1:20:28] Jacob, twins sharing the same womb, but
[1:20:32] possessing different destinies. One
[1:20:35] despised the birthright, the other
[1:20:37] pursued it with everything he had.
[1:20:40] I tell you what, I I I just want you to
[1:20:43] know if you're pursuing the birthright,
[1:20:44] even if you hadn't got it, it's a good
[1:20:46] sign. You're a seed of God.
[1:20:50] Amen. And on through history, this
[1:20:51] mystery, it weaves, you know, two vines,
[1:20:54] two spirits, two churches, two brides,
[1:20:56] the bride of Christ and the bride of
[1:20:58] Satan.
[1:21:00] And Jesus himself prophesied in Matthew
[1:21:03] 13, the weed and the tears would grow
[1:21:06] together, side by side, the same field,
[1:21:09] under the same sun, drinking the same
[1:21:11] rain, bathed under the same spirit, and
[1:21:14] sometimes even shouting under the same
[1:21:16] anointing.
[1:21:19] Now, let them grow together to the
[1:21:22] harvest. You'll hear me repeating this.
[1:21:26] And in this final hour, both are
[1:21:28] reaching maturity. Outwardly, both call
[1:21:32] theirel Christians, believers. Both lift
[1:21:34] their hands and both s sing songs and
[1:21:38] and and both speak of Jesus.
[1:21:41] But only one is born of incorruptible
[1:21:43] seed
[1:21:45] of the word, and the other is a product
[1:21:47] of subtle deception.
[1:21:50] Religion with no spirit, form without
[1:21:53] power, knowledge without life. So, how
[1:21:56] are we going to tell the difference?
[1:21:59] Well, I'm going to tell you there's
[1:22:00] about three things where we can tell the
[1:22:02] difference. One is time, the other is
[1:22:05] fruit, and the other is harvest.
[1:22:08] And you say time. Yeah, time. Because
[1:22:11] when in the infancy, it's impossible to
[1:22:14] tell them apart.
[1:22:16] That's why Jesus said, "Don't go out and
[1:22:18] pluck them up." Now, in this stage, they
[1:22:22] look so much like the real.
[1:22:26] If you pluck them up, you'll pluck up
[1:22:28] the wheat.
[1:22:30] Amen. You pluck up what I planted
[1:22:33] because they look so close. They're
[1:22:36] babies. And as babies, you know, they
[1:22:38] they they're all just gentle and cuddly
[1:22:41] and sweet. But watch and see what they
[1:22:44] grow up to be.
[1:22:46] You can raise a lion cub and a lamb
[1:22:48] together and suck from the same bottle,
[1:22:50] but one day they're going to raise up
[1:22:52] and they will manifest their nature.
[1:22:55] You see again again fruit because by
[1:22:58] their fruit you will know them. Harvest
[1:23:01] because at the harvest time every seed
[1:23:04] brings forth of its kind as the seed
[1:23:07] reveals itself and shows its true
[1:23:09] colors. Let me ask you when did brother
[1:23:12] Brandham say that Judas showed his true
[1:23:14] colors
[1:23:16] at Pentecost
[1:23:18] at receiving the spirit. He said he he
[1:23:22] went and he went not just denied
[1:23:25] betrayed the Lord before Pentecost.
[1:23:29] And you will see this this cycle repeat
[1:23:31] and repeat and repeat you know where
[1:23:34] where where there will be those right
[1:23:36] within the framework of the church
[1:23:38] itself.
[1:23:39] And they will they will be ones with
[1:23:42] Judas had a miraculous ministry. Judas
[1:23:45] was a good preacher. Judas w was trusted
[1:23:49] above all the others. He carried the
[1:23:51] bag. I mean you're not going to give it
[1:23:53] to Matthew the thief was a he he was a a
[1:23:57] tax master. you know, he you you're not
[1:23:59] going to give it to him. He was a cheat.
[1:24:02] But oh, Judas was so trusted.
[1:24:06] One of the most trusted ones. Are you
[1:24:09] with me? Amen. But that but when he come
[1:24:13] up to Pentecost, he showed his true
[1:24:16] colors.
[1:24:18] I'll tell you what, don't you stop shy
[1:24:20] of getting the the true genuine baptism
[1:24:23] of the Holy Ghost. Don't you stop shy of
[1:24:27] a real Pentecostal experience.
[1:24:30] Amen. So, Cain slew Abel.
[1:24:34] Ishmael mocked Isaac. Esau plotted
[1:24:36] against Jacob. Judas betrayed Jesus. And
[1:24:40] today, the false persecutes the true.
[1:24:45] And Galatians 4 says, "But he then that
[1:24:50] was born after the spirit persecuted him
[1:24:52] that was born after the spirit, even so
[1:24:55] is it now." And let me tell you, I've
[1:24:58] got a habit of looking people right
[1:24:59] straight in the face. But I'm not really
[1:25:02] talking and saying, "That's you I'm
[1:25:04] talking about."
[1:25:09] I don't preach looking at the ceiling or
[1:25:10] the floor. I look at people when I
[1:25:12] preach. I'm not I'm not saying you're
[1:25:15] the false seed. I'm saying I'm looking
[1:25:17] for a response from you.
[1:25:21] Are you with me? Amen. I'm looking to
[1:25:23] see that you're you're zoned in. You're
[1:25:25] tuned in, not zoned out. Now again, you
[1:25:29] see the Bible said in Galatians 4:29,
[1:25:31] "But he that was born after the flesh
[1:25:34] persecuted him that was born after the
[1:25:36] spirit. Even so is it now." Just
[1:25:39] consider how many that grew together
[1:25:41] with us.
[1:25:43] who were great church members and seem
[1:25:46] like real believers, were song leaders
[1:25:48] and deacons and even preachers now
[1:25:51] manifest what they were all along now
[1:25:55] lead and persecuting the very message.
[1:25:58] Amen. They didn't become tears. They
[1:26:01] were always tears.
[1:26:03] But now they're manifesting what they
[1:26:05] were all along.
[1:26:07] Now this is not merely history. It's
[1:26:10] prophecy. It's happen right now in our
[1:26:12] churches, in our pulpits, in our altars.
[1:26:15] The supernatural gospel, hear me now. It
[1:26:18] will be ridiculed, criticized, slammed,
[1:26:22] and resisted.
[1:26:25] Satan hates the supernatural gospel.
[1:26:28] He'll do everything he can to discredit
[1:26:30] it.
[1:26:32] Now, just as the weed and the tears grow
[1:26:34] side by side in the same field, so do
[1:26:37] the true and false vine grow together in
[1:26:40] the church. Outwardly, both call
[1:26:42] themselves Christians. Both lift their
[1:26:45] hands. Both sing songs. Both talk about
[1:26:49] Jesus, but only once born of the seed of
[1:26:51] the word. The others a product of
[1:26:53] deception.
[1:26:54] For the Bible said, Matthew 24:24, "This
[1:26:58] is what will plague the last days. For
[1:27:00] there shall be false anointed ones,
[1:27:03] false Christs, and false prophets, and
[1:27:07] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[1:27:10] much, if it were possible, they shall
[1:27:12] deceive the very elect. But did you hear
[1:27:15] that? If it were possible, even the
[1:27:19] elect could be deceived, but they can't
[1:27:22] because they are elect. They're the seed
[1:27:25] of God. But Jesus said, "By their
[1:27:27] fruits, you will know them.
[1:27:30] Amen. The elect, those born of God, they
[1:27:33] will discern the difference. Why?
[1:27:35] Because they have the Holy Ghost, the
[1:27:37] spirit of truth dwelling within them. So
[1:27:41] that's why we cry out this morning,
[1:27:44] Lord, separate us to the tree of life.
[1:27:47] Let us be found as a true wheat, not a
[1:27:49] tear, but true sons, not impostors. Let
[1:27:53] us be born not of religion, not not of a
[1:27:56] church, not of a movement, not of
[1:27:58] tradition, but of the living seed of the
[1:28:00] word, born by the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:04] Amen. Let us produce the atmosphere.
[1:28:07] Amen. Where the Holy Ghost can move and
[1:28:09] birth his sons and daughters.
[1:28:13] Now, the Ephesian church age, I'm going
[1:28:16] to talk about them for a moment because
[1:28:19] this is where it would decline. it
[1:28:21] would, you know, would get choked out.
[1:28:23] The spirit of God would be smothered
[1:28:25] out. And it happened gradually. It
[1:28:28] didn't happen overnight.
[1:28:31] Oh, yeah. And in the early days of the
[1:28:33] church, just before the outpouring of
[1:28:35] Pentecost or just after, I mean, the
[1:28:38] outpouring of Pentecost, we begin to see
[1:28:41] this false vine and it begins to wrap
[1:28:43] itself around the true and and slowly
[1:28:47] squeezing out its life. In Revelation 2
[1:28:51] and six and verse also verse 15, it
[1:28:55] tells us about the deed and the doctrine
[1:28:57] of the nickelans. How many's ever heard
[1:28:59] of them? Well, let me tell you, it was a
[1:29:02] spirit of hierarchy, of control, a
[1:29:04] man-made religion, and God said, "I hate
[1:29:07] it."
[1:29:08] Is that right? Yeah. And while the early
[1:29:11] church really did resist the nickel
[1:29:16] spirit, but because they grew
[1:29:20] together in the same movement, the same
[1:29:24] the true church became drugged down by
[1:29:28] their influence.
[1:29:31] Amen. Let me just tell you friends, you
[1:29:34] know, you don't even want to be
[1:29:37] influenced.
[1:29:41] You want to be separate, undeviled.
[1:29:46] And the Ephesians church was once a
[1:29:48] blazing with the fire of Pentecost. And
[1:29:51] it become a place of outward works,
[1:29:55] you know, without inward warmth. And
[1:29:57] Jesus is walking among them in the in
[1:30:00] the lampstands in Revelation 2 and he
[1:30:03] says verse four, I have someone against
[1:30:06] you because you left your first love.
[1:30:12] Oh my, how in the world can the bride be
[1:30:15] joined to Christ in this last day and
[1:30:17] don't have the first love?
[1:30:20] Come on, somebody help me preach. How
[1:30:22] could we be married? How can a marriage
[1:30:24] take place and the love is tepid?
[1:30:29] And there's no real care, no real
[1:30:31] burden, no no real zeal.
[1:30:35] You see, they hadn't fallen into gross
[1:30:39] heresy or or immorality. They were still
[1:30:42] laboring. They were still enduring. They
[1:30:44] were basically correcting doctrine.
[1:30:48] Oh yeah. They were still quoting the
[1:30:50] apostles. In fact, brother Brandham said
[1:30:52] they resisted those apostles who said
[1:30:55] who claimed those false apostles who
[1:30:57] said they were apostles and were not and
[1:30:59] found them liars and and and and put
[1:31:01] their finger in their face and said,
[1:31:03] "You're not saying what Paul said."
[1:31:06] They were trying to stand with
[1:31:08] everything they had, you know, and they
[1:31:10] they were laboring, enduring, basically
[1:31:13] correcting doctrine, still quoting the
[1:31:15] apostle. The Apostle Paul said this,
[1:31:17] James said this, Jesus said that. All of
[1:31:20] these other, they're telling personal
[1:31:22] testimonies of Jesus. We was with him on
[1:31:24] the boat. I stood there on the shores. I
[1:31:27] saw the blind eyes open. I heard I heard
[1:31:30] the deaf speak. I I saw all of this
[1:31:32] happen. But they had left the flame of
[1:31:35] their first love, the spirit led in
[1:31:38] intimacy that marked them at Pentecost.
[1:31:41] They had left it
[1:31:44] and were already drifting. That's right.
[1:31:47] Brother Brandham said they aimed at the
[1:31:49] high calling
[1:31:55] but relaxed.
[1:31:59] Not turn my back on the message.
[1:32:02] Not deny not true. Not betray. Not
[1:32:06] ridicule
[1:32:08] the prophet. just relaxed.
[1:32:14] Just relaxed.
[1:32:21] They exchanged a living relationship for
[1:32:24] religious routine.
[1:32:30] They exchanged the leadership of the
[1:32:32] Holy Ghost for the order of man.
[1:32:35] And what was that first love? It was the
[1:32:39] freshness of Jesus Christ revealed by
[1:32:42] the spirit. It was a holy zeal which he
[1:32:46] challenges and and admonishes us in
[1:32:49] Leodosia. Be zealous.
[1:32:52] I tell you what, you know what it tells
[1:32:53] you to be zealous to do? Repent.
[1:32:57] Be willing to say I'm wrong. Be willing
[1:33:00] to take a correction,
[1:33:03] a change in course.
[1:33:08] But they lost
[1:33:10] that burning love for his word, his
[1:33:12] presence, and the moving of his spirit.
[1:33:16] That first love was a holy excitement.
[1:33:19] It was the expectation, anticipation
[1:33:21] that our brother Aaron was preaching
[1:33:23] about Wednesday night. And and as I
[1:33:25] heard him preach, I knew what I was
[1:33:26] going to deliver this Sunday.
[1:33:30] So it falls right in order.
[1:33:33] And maybe you don't feel like this is
[1:33:35] very positive, but I mean sometimes you
[1:33:37] have to look at the negative to to
[1:33:39] realize, hey, you know, this is the
[1:33:42] direction I don't want to go. It was
[1:33:45] like the first days of Acts, the Bible
[1:33:48] said in Acts 2:42, "And they continued
[1:33:51] steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and
[1:33:54] fellowship and breaking of bread and
[1:33:56] prayers and and fear came upon every
[1:33:59] soul, and many wonders and signs were
[1:34:01] done.
[1:34:04] But as time passed
[1:34:06] and time is passing,
[1:34:10] a different spirit crept in.
[1:34:13] And then we see the rise of religious
[1:34:15] tamina contamination
[1:34:18] shown in Acts chapter 15 that I talk
[1:34:20] about very often.
[1:34:22] Acts 15:1.
[1:34:25] And certain men
[1:34:28] taught the brethren.
[1:34:31] It come in as a teaching.
[1:34:33] Except you be circumcised unto the
[1:34:35] manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.
[1:34:41] And salvation became from out of
[1:34:43] tradition
[1:34:46] and works
[1:34:48] rather than experience.
[1:34:54] How is it possible? I often ask this
[1:34:57] question. I I I I I get why why I can't
[1:35:02] wrap my mind around it sometimes. How is
[1:35:05] it possible that Pharisees who had once
[1:35:08] persecuted Jesus showed up in the book
[1:35:10] of Acts church?
[1:35:12] How could they be believers and still a
[1:35:14] Pharisees? When when Paul was converted,
[1:35:18] he trashed and discarded Phariseism. He
[1:35:22] flung it away from him and he said, "I
[1:35:24] count it all as as loss for the
[1:35:27] excellency of the knowledge of Jesus
[1:35:29] Christ, my Lord, for whom I've suffered
[1:35:31] the loss of all things and to count them
[1:35:33] as dung
[1:35:36] that I may win Christ." Brother, he he
[1:35:40] flung it so far away from him as
[1:35:42] something unimpure, unclean.
[1:35:46] Even though I'll tell you phariseism had
[1:35:49] all the trapping trappings of holiness
[1:35:52] and purity and righteousness and form
[1:35:56] and legalism
[1:36:03] and yet even the apostle Paul was washed
[1:36:07] of all of that. Yet the early church was
[1:36:10] not.
[1:36:12] Verse five of chapter 15. But there rose
[1:36:16] up certain of the sect of Pharisees
[1:36:19] which believed,
[1:36:22] saying that it is needful to circumcise
[1:36:24] him and command them to keep the law of
[1:36:26] Moses.
[1:36:27] And you see, they believed. Listen to me
[1:36:30] now. They believe the message.
[1:36:34] They acknowledged at least some of its
[1:36:36] truths.
[1:36:38] You know, but they but they clung to an
[1:36:41] expired dispensation.
[1:36:43] They were trying to bring the early
[1:36:45] church back under the law when Christ
[1:36:48] had already fulfilled it. And the Holy
[1:36:51] Ghost had already fallen on the
[1:36:53] Gentiles. And it happened without
[1:36:55] circumcision.
[1:36:57] Showing that the true circumcision is of
[1:36:59] the heart in the spirit and not in the
[1:37:01] letter.
[1:37:03] Amen. They bypass the new birth somehow.
[1:37:06] They bypassed a real upper room
[1:37:09] experience that circumcision of the
[1:37:12] heart and they tried to bind new
[1:37:15] believers now with traditions and dead
[1:37:18] rituals.
[1:37:20] They denied the fiery cutting spirit
[1:37:24] baptism that cut off flesh and
[1:37:26] circumcised the heart and mix the
[1:37:29] message with traditions of the past. And
[1:37:32] that made the the message a hybrid
[1:37:36] gospel by mixing the words of Jesus with
[1:37:39] the traditions of men and thereby made
[1:37:42] the word of God of none effect.
[1:37:46] It wasn't good enough to be filled with
[1:37:49] the spirit. It wasn't good enough to be
[1:37:53] be saturated with the fire of God until
[1:37:56] you stammered and spoke in other tongues
[1:37:58] and other lang. It wasn't good enough.
[1:38:02] It was now you must you must have these
[1:38:05] certain traditions and works.
[1:38:09] You know, we replace that with I just
[1:38:11] believe the message. I just confess
[1:38:13] Christ as a savior, you know, which is
[1:38:15] equal to brother Bradom talking about
[1:38:17] shaking hands with the pastor and being
[1:38:19] accepted into the church. Let me tell
[1:38:22] you, that's not a new birth.
[1:38:25] No sir, they bypass the new birth. made
[1:38:30] a hybrid gospel. And this was the
[1:38:33] beginnings of the false vine. The
[1:38:36] religious system that would choke out
[1:38:38] the spirit with creeds, councelss, and
[1:38:42] carnal reasoning. It would leave the
[1:38:45] church with a name that lives but is
[1:38:47] dead. And soon the church began to
[1:38:50] decline and lose its power.
[1:38:54] Think of that. The name, that phrase
[1:38:58] comes from Revelation 3:1, a name that
[1:39:01] thou lives but is dead. And it's Jesus
[1:39:04] message to this church at Sardis. I know
[1:39:08] your works.
[1:39:10] That you have a name that you live and
[1:39:12] are dead. What in the world does that
[1:39:15] mean? What does that mean to us today?
[1:39:18] Does it even have any meaning? Has it
[1:39:19] lost his meaning? Well, I'll just tell
[1:39:21] you to to have a name that lives means
[1:39:25] to appear alive.
[1:39:27] To have a reputation or form or outward
[1:39:30] success that looks spiritual or vibrant
[1:39:33] and alive in the world's eyes
[1:39:37] and maybe have a rich history of revival
[1:39:40] or spiritual beginnings.
[1:39:44] This is what all denominations do. They
[1:39:46] point back to their founders. We're of
[1:39:48] Wesley. We're the Wesleyan Methodists.
[1:39:50] We are we're we're we're from John
[1:39:52] Smith. We we believe in and in and
[1:39:54] Luther and just shall live by faith. You
[1:39:57] see, they they they revail in what God
[1:40:02] did in the past.
[1:40:06] I I read the other day, you know, where
[1:40:08] a poor Baptist friend of mine was crying
[1:40:11] because the church sits empty
[1:40:14] and nobody's coming.
[1:40:18] you know, they they Wednesday night
[1:40:22] there's nobody there. Sunday, they're
[1:40:24] not coming. Why? And and and and why is
[1:40:27] it? Because because, you know, they they
[1:40:31] were relying on something from the past
[1:40:36] and nothing was up fresh and up to date.
[1:40:40] And I'll tell you what, right now, I
[1:40:42] don't care who you are, whether it's me
[1:40:43] or you, you've got to keep a fresh and
[1:40:46] upto-date experience with God.
[1:40:49] You cannot let it slip.
[1:40:54] So you see,
[1:40:57] this is what denominations always do. Do
[1:41:00] they have maybe reflect on ah the past a
[1:41:06] history of revival
[1:41:09] spiritual beginnings
[1:41:12] and not only are denominations prone to
[1:41:14] do that
[1:41:16] but we're prone to do today the same
[1:41:20] when we revail in the spirit where God
[1:41:23] healed and God delivered in the divine
[1:41:26] healing movements of the vortis and 50
[1:41:28] but then deny that Christ is still the
[1:41:30] same.
[1:41:33] You see, that's a name. That's a
[1:41:35] reputation of of living. But now, but
[1:41:38] now expectations that brother Aaron
[1:41:41] preached about are dead.
[1:41:44] Oh, no. They're dead. You know, it's
[1:41:46] dead. But we are taught to believe the
[1:41:47] Holy Ghost is just a mere confession
[1:41:50] that when that we believe the message
[1:41:52] without an experience of that holy
[1:41:55] baptism of fire that cleanses from sin,
[1:42:06] Let me tell you, a dead church
[1:42:09] can only produce dead children.
[1:42:16] Out of a dead woman comes stillborn
[1:42:18] children.
[1:42:23] Out of a dead church is still born
[1:42:26] children.
[1:42:33] But so it strips our joy.
[1:42:38] I'm not preaching this to condemn you. I
[1:42:40] I'm preaching this for you. You can
[1:42:42] discern truth from error.
[1:42:45] Amen. It strips our joy. It condemns
[1:42:48] emotion. It removes the power. It denies
[1:42:51] and condemns the supernatural. And zoom
[1:42:53] the church is a lifeless group whose
[1:42:56] only weapon is argument.
[1:42:59] Or maybe maybe you know uh they adhere
[1:43:03] to doctrinal truths or a famous name
[1:43:06] like denominations do and now we are
[1:43:08] prone to do.
[1:43:11] Hear me now. We believe the thunders and
[1:43:15] we truly do. We believe the presence and
[1:43:18] we really do. Amen. We are in the
[1:43:22] message and we truly are. We're in the
[1:43:26] open in the word and that's a fact. And
[1:43:29] we're in the third pull and that's an
[1:43:31] absolute truth. But all these are names
[1:43:34] that you are living.
[1:43:37] But Jesus sees past the the surface.
[1:43:41] Amen. Though the church had a name of
[1:43:43] being alive, he says plainly, you're
[1:43:46] dead.
[1:43:48] You got a name that you're living. You
[1:43:50] got a name. You're in the third book.
[1:43:52] You already got a name. You're in the
[1:43:54] opening of the word, but you're dead.
[1:44:00] And that means spiritually in the eyes
[1:44:01] of God, the church lost its connection
[1:44:04] to the life source, Jesus Christ
[1:44:07] himself.
[1:44:11] So what causes a church to be dead in
[1:44:14] God's eyes?
[1:44:20] I want to bring you back just a moment.
[1:44:22] The capstone's coming crying grace,
[1:44:24] grace.
[1:44:26] And if it wasn't for grace, we'd all
[1:44:29] wound up dead
[1:44:32] because a cycle of revival and death
[1:44:34] never fails. But somebody,
[1:44:38] somebody,
[1:44:39] some church, some believers, somewhere
[1:44:43] is going to break the cycle.
[1:44:49] Amen. I say be one of them.
[1:44:52] Let that be your high and holy calling.
[1:44:55] I'm breaking the cycle. I'm breaking the
[1:44:57] cycle of formalism. I'm breaking the
[1:45:00] cycle that takes God out of the church.
[1:45:02] I'm breaking the cycle where there's no
[1:45:05] supernatural. I'm breaking the cycle of
[1:45:07] sin, unbelief. I'm breaking the cycle. I
[1:45:12] will be an overcomer.
[1:45:14] I will not be defeated. I will rise.
[1:45:19] I will not fall.
[1:45:27] But what causes a church to be dead in
[1:45:30] God's eyes?
[1:45:33] Lack of Holy Spirit leadership.
[1:45:36] For the letter killth, but the spirit
[1:45:37] gives life.
[1:45:39] A church may have good, correct doctrine
[1:45:41] and still be dead because it lacks the
[1:45:44] anointing, the presence, the guidance of
[1:45:46] the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:50] What causes him to be dead in God's
[1:45:52] eyes? Form without fire,
[1:45:56] structure
[1:45:57] without the spirit,
[1:46:00] having a form of godliness, you'll hear
[1:46:02] me quote this, but denying the power
[1:46:05] thereof. Continuing on in motions,
[1:46:09] songs, sermons, ceremonies.
[1:46:12] They have the right form, but the fire
[1:46:14] is gone.
[1:46:16] No Holy Ghost fire, no power, no
[1:46:19] conviction, no tears, no brokenness,
[1:46:25] no miracles,
[1:46:27] no gifts of the spirit, no do new birth,
[1:46:32] no moving of the spirit.
[1:46:37] And then reputation
[1:46:40] without relationship.
[1:46:43] This causes, you see, they had a
[1:46:45] reputation. I'm living. I got a name. A
[1:46:48] reputation.
[1:46:50] They had a strong reputation among men.
[1:46:52] But Jesus wasn't impressed.
[1:46:55] Oh, no. He really sees what's on the
[1:46:57] inside. You know, the life of Christ was
[1:46:59] no longer flowing. He wasn't the sinner
[1:47:02] anymore. And many Christians have a
[1:47:04] strong reputation of being a Christian
[1:47:07] for many years, but the relationship
[1:47:10] with Christ has grown cold.
[1:47:14] Oh no, not us. Not us. Uhuh. We're the
[1:47:19] bride. We're We're in the message. We're
[1:47:21] in the present truth. Well, let me just
[1:47:23] pass on this warning from the prophet of
[1:47:26] God. He says, I want to give a warning
[1:47:28] right here. It says concerning the last
[1:47:30] days because of abounding iniquity the
[1:47:33] love of many will wax cold. You know
[1:47:35] that is a prophecy of the end time in
[1:47:37] the leoty in her last days self love and
[1:47:40] love for material things will take the
[1:47:42] place of the true love of God. And we
[1:47:44] need to guard against the power of sin
[1:47:46] in these last days. So many are getting
[1:47:48] so hard because they hadn't realized the
[1:47:51] effect of this last day spirit. It is
[1:47:53] time to draw nigh to God and let him
[1:47:56] fill our lives with his love or we will
[1:47:59] feel the coldness of the last day church
[1:48:02] and reject the truth of God which alone
[1:48:04] is able to help us.
[1:48:10] So here's another thing
[1:48:12] that causes a church to be dead in God's
[1:48:15] eyes. Resting on the past.
[1:48:21] Look at your neighbor and say, "Resting
[1:48:24] on the past."
[1:48:28] You see, Cardis
[1:48:30] had a powerful beginning, but failed to
[1:48:33] press on.
[1:48:36] Like Israel eating yesterday's mana,
[1:48:39] they were now feeding on spoiled bread.
[1:48:42] Truce once fresh but not void of the
[1:48:45] spirit. Now, brother Brandham talks
[1:48:47] about this in question answers on the
[1:48:49] seals and he explains that as a nation
[1:48:52] we're broke and we are.
[1:48:56] He was saying that back then. Wow.
[1:48:59] You can't imagine how we are now. 36
[1:49:03] trillion in debt.
[1:49:07] David, stand up.
[1:49:10] You, my son, owe $1600,000.
[1:49:21] You're in debt
[1:49:24] and you hadn't even taken out your first
[1:49:25] bank loan.
[1:49:30] Thank you.
[1:49:32] You see, we spent more than we've
[1:49:34] earned,
[1:49:36] not only in dollars, but values.
[1:49:39] We're not living in strength. We're
[1:49:41] surviving off of the faded glory of of a
[1:49:44] past reputation.
[1:49:46] And tragically, that's the same
[1:49:48] condition that crept into the church.
[1:49:50] And I I'm not talking about the bride of
[1:49:53] Christ cuz I I believe she's being
[1:49:54] called out and awakened. I'm I'm not
[1:49:57] only talking about the organized rel
[1:50:00] denominational church world, but also,
[1:50:03] forgive me, the tears in the message
[1:50:06] movement.
[1:50:07] And sorry, there's tears
[1:50:10] and chaff.
[1:50:12] Just like this nation, too many are
[1:50:14] surviving over what it used to be, not
[1:50:18] what it is now.
[1:50:21] They said, "We're the church. We're the
[1:50:23] mother church. We're we were there in
[1:50:25] the beginning." And that may be true.
[1:50:27] The Methodists had their fire. The
[1:50:29] Baptist had their convictions. The
[1:50:30] Pentecostals had their outpouring. And
[1:50:33] the message started out in power and
[1:50:35] demonstration.
[1:50:36] But where is it now?
[1:50:40] Kabad has been written over the door of
[1:50:42] the glory departed. And this has
[1:50:44] happened to far too many. I pray it's
[1:50:47] not on your door or my door or this
[1:50:49] church. We don't ever want that.
[1:50:53] In Jesus day, the temple worship was a
[1:50:56] hollow religion. It was filled with
[1:50:58] tradition that was handed down from the
[1:51:00] past. And when the veil was opened, when
[1:51:03] it was rent that day on Calvary, it
[1:51:06] exposed the mercy seat.
[1:51:10] And guess what? It opened it up for
[1:51:13] everybody to see. There was no God
[1:51:16] there.
[1:51:20] My goodness. That's what happened at
[1:51:22] Calvary when Jesus died. The the it was
[1:51:25] the temple veil rent from top to bottom.
[1:51:28] There was no shakina glory. There was no
[1:51:31] pillar of fire.
[1:51:33] There was only the trappings
[1:51:36] of and symbols of a past move of God.
[1:51:41] And the spirit of God wasn't there.
[1:51:45] And that's what happened in this day
[1:51:47] when the veil was open on religious
[1:51:49] system. It showed there's no God inside
[1:51:52] there. No pillar of fire, no anointing,
[1:51:56] no Holy Ghost. It's gone.
[1:52:03] So therefore,
[1:52:06] everybody's boasting about what used to
[1:52:08] happen. Oh, I remember when saints
[1:52:12] danced in the spirit. Well, maybe you're
[1:52:14] too ashamed of that memory. Oh, when the
[1:52:16] power of God fell, when oh, when
[1:52:18] miracles took place. And let me tell
[1:52:21] you, I I truthfully thank God for
[1:52:22] whatever he did in the past.
[1:52:26] Amen. But the danger is this. They're
[1:52:28] living off the memory and not the
[1:52:30] reality.
[1:52:32] Jesus said, "You make the word of God
[1:52:34] have none effect through your
[1:52:35] tradition." And the church has long
[1:52:37] gotten big and refined and powerless.
[1:52:41] And and in other cases, they they become
[1:52:45] smaller
[1:52:47] with no new births,
[1:52:51] fewer baptism,
[1:52:54] and even rare. Yes. very rare services
[1:52:59] where the spirit moves
[1:53:02] and the shout of the king has long gone
[1:53:05] from their services.
[1:53:08] Well, brother Jim, our church, we we're
[1:53:11] just not in the spirit of revival. Shame
[1:53:13] on you.
[1:53:15] We're in the bride's revival.
[1:53:18] How could we not be in the spirit of
[1:53:20] revival? How could we not have Holy
[1:53:23] Ghost pouring when he said, "I'll pour
[1:53:25] out my spirit on all flesh." That means
[1:53:27] you and you and you and you can be
[1:53:30] recipients of the divine power of God.
[1:53:36] Oh yeah. I don't I don't mean to, you
[1:53:40] know, to point anybody out. I I don't
[1:53:42] mean to embarrass anybody or any other
[1:53:45] church or any other thing. I'm not
[1:53:47] trying to say we got it and you don't.
[1:53:49] That's not exact. That's not my motive
[1:53:51] at all. I'm I'm saying every one of us,
[1:53:54] we need to check up and make sure that
[1:53:56] if the veil was open of our heart, Jesus
[1:53:59] Christ is sitting on the inside in the
[1:54:02] altar of our heart.
[1:54:05] That it's not the facade of religion.
[1:54:07] It's not a beautiful out show, but it's
[1:54:09] a real genuine flowing of the Holy
[1:54:12] Spirit in our lives.
[1:54:19] So, Israel of all, they boasted of their
[1:54:21] heritage, but they lost their fire.
[1:54:26] And I don't care if a church is only
[1:54:29] four or five people. If the fire is gone
[1:54:33] out, if the passion isn't there, if
[1:54:36] there's no revival in the midst,
[1:54:40] then you have a form of godliness
[1:54:44] while you deny the power. make excuses
[1:54:47] for why it's not there.
[1:54:51] Don't you see? That's exactly what
[1:54:53] happened to Israel. They thought that
[1:54:55] God would preserve them because of what
[1:54:56] Abraham, Moses, and David had done. But
[1:54:59] when Jesus came, the word made flesh,
[1:55:01] they rejected him. So will they reject
[1:55:04] the Holy Spirit today. As Jesus said,
[1:55:07] don't you think to say within yourself,
[1:55:09] we've got Abraham as our father. For I
[1:55:12] say unto you, God is able of these
[1:55:13] stones to raise up children of Abraham.
[1:55:17] God doesn't preserve a people based on
[1:55:19] what they were, but on what they are
[1:55:21] right now.
[1:55:23] Amen. It didn't matter that Israel once
[1:55:26] had the glory cloud and and the fire
[1:55:29] when they rejected the word of the hour
[1:55:31] of judgment came. And we in America,
[1:55:33] we're in the same boat.
[1:55:36] Don't matter how many times we got a
[1:55:38] Statue of Liberty that we we show uh
[1:55:41] show in our harbor or how many times we
[1:55:44] we we wave the proud flag and say we
[1:55:47] stand for liberty and all of this stuff
[1:55:48] like that. We're in the same boat.
[1:55:52] So hear me. I'm going to tell you the
[1:55:55] bride is not living on memory.
[1:55:58] She's living by the voice of the
[1:56:00] bridegroom.
[1:56:02] Hallelujah. The word to her is
[1:56:04] effective. It's lifegiving. It is
[1:56:07] powerful and lifech changing.
[1:56:11] My sheep hear my voice and I know them.
[1:56:14] They follow me. Said Jesus. We're not
[1:56:18] feasting on crumbs from yesterday's
[1:56:20] revival. We're feasting and dining on
[1:56:23] the hidden mana of today. We're not
[1:56:26] bound by man-made traditions. We're
[1:56:28] walking in step with the spirit. The
[1:56:31] word is alive and fresh to them. And the
[1:56:34] spirit is still anointing. Well, I tell
[1:56:36] you what, that's the way it ought to be
[1:56:38] this morning. Amen. The spirit is still
[1:56:41] anointing us. The spirit is still moving
[1:56:43] upon us. People that are still
[1:56:45] rejoicing, who lift their leaves or
[1:56:48] hands and clap them together as the
[1:56:50] winds blow through the church, the winds
[1:56:54] of the spirit. Come on, somebody who
[1:56:57] only gets deeper and deeper and deeper
[1:57:00] when the winds of the spirit blows.
[1:57:04] So what will it be for us?
[1:57:07] Will we be le oysia
[1:57:10] rich in increase of goods and need of
[1:57:12] nothing while Jesus stands on the
[1:57:15] outside knocking?
[1:57:17] Or will we return not just to our roots
[1:57:21] but to the living word to the fire of
[1:57:24] the spirit to the power and the purity
[1:57:28] of Christ in us the hope of glory.
[1:57:32] Think of this. I want to say don't live
[1:57:36] on repetition.
[1:57:39] How many among us have been Christians
[1:57:41] for more than 50 years? How's my hands
[1:57:44] up too?
[1:57:46] You can't live on your reputation.
[1:57:52] No matter how long,
[1:57:54] how established,
[1:57:56] how once you loved the Lord and walked
[1:57:59] in truth,
[1:58:02] So you see,
[1:58:05] you can't live on repetition.
[1:58:08] Let me just say this.
[1:58:10] Brother Brandham
[1:58:12] talked about this and I'm going to read
[1:58:14] it to you from how can I overcome and he
[1:58:17] preached on this and he preached it. He
[1:58:20] said because the church needed to step
[1:58:21] higher.
[1:58:23] So again, a message like this is not to
[1:58:26] push you down. It's so you can step
[1:58:27] higher. Yes. So when when he preached,
[1:58:31] how can I overcome? It came to him when
[1:58:33] he was crossing what he called a creek,
[1:58:37] a creek,
[1:58:39] a branch.
[1:58:41] You ever drink branch water?
[1:58:44] Well, a branch is a branch off of the
[1:58:47] main stream. It's a creek.
[1:58:50] Maybe it's a feeder creek comes into the
[1:58:53] into the one, but nevertheless, it's a
[1:58:55] branch. And he was walking over this
[1:58:57] branch,
[1:58:59] this creek, this creek, Louisiana, this
[1:59:04] bio,
[1:59:05] South Louisiana, this bayou.
[1:59:11] And he stepped on an old log that was
[1:59:14] laying across it.
[1:59:16] And when he did,
[1:59:19] he almost fell in the creek because a
[1:59:22] big chunk of it fell off. It was rotted
[1:59:26] and he called it dirty.
[1:59:31] And I want you to say that log once had
[1:59:34] a reputation.
[1:59:36] I stood tall in the forest.
[1:59:40] I swayed in the breeze.
[1:59:43] My hands clapped as the spirit moved.
[1:59:47] I rejoiced. Oh, I drank from the water
[1:59:52] of this of this creek. I once was alive,
[1:59:57] but now
[2:00:00] I'm dead.
[2:00:03] And brother Brandon said, you take a
[2:00:05] Christian that's supposed to be a
[2:00:06] Christian and let the life of God goes
[2:00:09] from him and experience the joy of
[2:00:12] serving Christ and living in a church
[2:00:15] because that tree was living in the
[2:00:18] water
[2:00:20] where such is going on. He rottens twice
[2:00:22] as quick living right under. And so if
[2:00:25] we're trying to follow the message of
[2:00:27] the hour, how many is doing that? Or at
[2:00:29] least this part of the message, we
[2:00:31] shouldn't live constantly in the life of
[2:00:33] Christ. Cuz if you don't, you lay around
[2:00:36] and you know these things that you're
[2:00:38] supposed to do and don't do it. And the
[2:00:39] Bible said, "He that knoweth to do good
[2:00:41] and doeth not to him, it's sin." Then
[2:00:43] you become dirty, rotten when you're
[2:00:45] separated from the life of God. So
[2:00:48] strive with all that's in you to stay in
[2:00:51] the life of Christ that you be
[2:00:54] fruitbearing.
[2:00:56] We see this age we're living in is one
[2:00:58] of the grandest of our ages of all this
[2:01:00] leodyian church grandest of all the
[2:01:02] church ages because it's the ending of
[2:01:04] time the blending of eternity. And then
[2:01:07] it's the greatest sinful age is more sin
[2:01:09] in this age than there's ever been. And
[2:01:11] the powers of Satan is many times harder
[2:01:14] to fight than was in any age. Here back
[2:01:16] in the early age, the Christian could
[2:01:18] for his profession of being a belonging
[2:01:20] to Christ could be beheaded for it. He
[2:01:23] could be killed or put out of his misery
[2:01:25] and and and go to meet God quickly. But
[2:01:28] now the enemy has come in in the name of
[2:01:31] the church. And it's so deceiving. This
[2:01:35] is a great age of deception. When Christ
[2:01:38] said the two spirits would be so close
[2:01:40] in the last days, it would deceive the
[2:01:43] very elect if it was possible. Remember
[2:01:45] Christ spoke of elected people in this
[2:01:48] last day. It would deceive the very
[2:01:50] elected if it were possible. So close.
[2:01:53] Now listen people so live
[2:01:59] can live people can live clean holy life
[2:02:06] not be sinful adulterers drinkers and
[2:02:09] liars and gamblers.
[2:02:12] They can live above that and still not
[2:02:15] with it.
[2:02:20] This is the age of life, the personal
[2:02:24] life of Christ.
[2:02:27] Think of this, the age of life, the
[2:02:30] personal life of Christ. We cannot just
[2:02:33] have forms of godliness. I don't steal.
[2:02:38] I don't smoke. I'm not a drunkard.
[2:02:42] I I'm a good person, Brother Tim. You
[2:02:46] don't. But do you have his life?
[2:02:49] That's the important thing. Is that life
[2:02:51] there? You see,
[2:02:55] it's a deception that grows through the
[2:02:57] ages just as Eve was was deceived by
[2:03:00] misapplying in her age. So, the church
[2:03:02] is being deceived by holding to the
[2:03:05] truth of a past season while rejecting
[2:03:07] the word for the hour. So 2
[2:03:10] Thessalonians 3 and 2 and 3 and 4 says
[2:03:14] that day shall not come except there
[2:03:15] come a falling away first and that man
[2:03:17] of sin be revealed who opposes exaltes
[2:03:20] himself above all that is called God so
[2:03:23] that he as God siteth in the temple of
[2:03:25] God showing himself that he is God. Now
[2:03:28] let's talk about that for a minute. The
[2:03:30] temple is no longer a building in
[2:03:32] Jerusalem.
[2:03:34] It's the church. It's the body of
[2:03:36] believers. And this prophecy reveals
[2:03:39] that the man of sin, Satan incarnate,
[2:03:42] will sit in the place of worship
[2:03:44] claiming to be Christ, not in name only,
[2:03:47] but in authority and influence. And
[2:03:50] people will think they are worshiping
[2:03:52] Jesus, but they're worshiping a
[2:03:55] perverted form of him, a Jesus, a
[2:03:58] tradition, a system, a religion, and not
[2:04:00] the word made flesh.
[2:04:03] And this is a great deception of the end
[2:04:05] time. They they worship God through a
[2:04:07] creed. They they deny present truth and
[2:04:10] all the while embracing
[2:04:13] past truth. Are you with me?
[2:04:17] Yet they're sincere.
[2:04:19] Hello. Oh yeah. But sincerely wrong
[2:04:23] because they rejected the voice of the
[2:04:25] word for their day. And he cried out to
[2:04:28] that first age. Return to your first
[2:04:30] love.
[2:04:33] remember from which thou art fallen and
[2:04:35] repent and do your first works. He said
[2:04:39] go back to Pentecost or go back to the
[2:04:41] upper room, back to the fire, back to
[2:04:43] the word, the spirit walking hand in
[2:04:46] hand. You say upper room? Well, brother
[2:04:48] Brandham in the rising of the sun, his
[2:04:51] last Easter message was still saying you
[2:04:54] need to close yourself in the upper room
[2:04:56] till the dynamics come.
[2:04:59] So every person has to have that
[2:05:01] experience. And this is the hour where
[2:05:04] the bride must be separated from the
[2:05:07] false vine. She will not be deceived.
[2:05:09] She will recognize her day in this
[2:05:11] message. She will walk in the spirit in
[2:05:14] the word and the life and the seed that
[2:05:16] was planted in the at the day of
[2:05:18] Pentecost. For he said, "My sheep hear
[2:05:21] they obey my voice. They follow me." But
[2:05:25] to this age there, he said, "I've got
[2:05:28] someone against you.
[2:05:31] You've left your first love."
[2:05:36] This really truly echoes
[2:05:39] the history of Israel after their
[2:05:41] exodus.
[2:05:44] They followed a prophet out of Egypt.
[2:05:48] God led them by supernatural firing
[2:05:50] cloud
[2:05:52] by prophetic voice by miraculous power.
[2:05:56] That's what led them. They rebelled.
[2:05:59] They demanded laws and creeds and
[2:06:00] eventually a king. And they, you know,
[2:06:03] they didn't want a king under the
[2:06:05] spirit. They wanted a man to lead them
[2:06:07] like other nations. And God would say to
[2:06:11] to to Samuel said, Samuel, they have not
[2:06:14] rejected you. They've rejected me that I
[2:06:16] should not reign over them. And this is
[2:06:19] the same spirit that crept into the
[2:06:21] church. The move of the spirit begin to
[2:06:24] be replaced with organization or
[2:06:26] organism instead of feel God's field
[2:06:30] spiritfilled men that are God called and
[2:06:33] equipped and anointed by God. And the
[2:06:36] church begin to look for credentialed
[2:06:39] leaders,
[2:06:40] systems of theology, worldly structure,
[2:06:44] and then lacking the Holy Spirit, they
[2:06:47] they have to use psychology to solve
[2:06:49] problems.
[2:06:51] I tell you what, when we have to use
[2:06:53] psychology to solve the problems in our
[2:06:55] midst, we need to shut the door.
[2:07:05] You know, honestly,
[2:07:09] honestly, we have very little very
[2:07:12] little that I have to sit and and
[2:07:14] counsel with of this problem and that
[2:07:16] problem. Very little.
[2:07:19] You know why?
[2:07:21] Because I teach you need the Holy Ghost
[2:07:26] and you need to be led by the Holy
[2:07:27] Ghost. And you need with that own
[2:07:30] experience then and that you know you
[2:07:34] can be led by the spirit instead of
[2:07:36] having to have some man direct you all
[2:07:38] the time.
[2:07:40] Come on. Amen. You know, again, I don't
[2:07:44] I don't mind counseling, giving a little
[2:07:46] help sometimes. That ain't what I'm
[2:07:47] trying to say. And maybe you think I'm
[2:07:49] too mean to come to. I don't know. But I
[2:07:53] really think it's because that I teach
[2:07:55] you this that you have your own
[2:07:57] experience with God and that I don't
[2:08:00] want to be your Holy Ghost.
[2:08:04] Amen. I don't want to decide what kind
[2:08:05] of car you're going to drive and whether
[2:08:07] you need to buy one or not or whether
[2:08:09] you need to change jobs or not. I want
[2:08:11] you to be led by the g by the Lord.
[2:08:14] Amen.
[2:08:15] I don't even want to tell you you need
[2:08:17] to come to this church and you know or
[2:08:19] you need to move over here or this or
[2:08:21] yeah this living here needs to come
[2:08:23] here. I don't do that. I say you find
[2:08:25] the mind of God. You find the spirit of
[2:08:28] God. You get led by the spirit of God.
[2:08:30] You get anchored in him because I'll
[2:08:33] tell you there's going to be storms.
[2:08:34] There's going to be troubles.
[2:08:39] And the last thing I need is a Jonah in
[2:08:41] my boat.
[2:08:43] I ain't talking about the baby I
[2:08:45] dedicated either.
[2:08:51] I just caught that just in case somebody
[2:08:54] might get a complex.
[2:08:58] But a Jonah in the boat is somebody
[2:09:00] supposed to be going somewhere else and
[2:09:03] they get in your boat and cause all
[2:09:06] kinds of trouble.
[2:09:11] get a revelation of what boat you're
[2:09:13] supposed to be in.
[2:09:15] And if you can't trust the leadership of
[2:09:17] God through the Holy Spirit working
[2:09:19] through the ministry of the church, find
[2:09:21] some place you can.
[2:09:24] But here's the whole deal. Get the Holy
[2:09:26] Ghost. Let him lead you. Don't be led by
[2:09:29] feelings. Be led by the spirit. So you
[2:09:34] see again as it happened you know in in
[2:09:37] Israel the church begins sliding into
[2:09:39] apostasy until it would one day
[2:09:41] completely reject the Holy Ghost. In
[2:09:43] fact according to the Bible the end time
[2:09:47] church would actually put Christ outside
[2:09:54] reject him completely.
[2:09:57] Leodosa shows him knocking on the
[2:10:00] outside of the door and they're still
[2:10:03] singing about him in the church.
[2:10:06] They're still praying prayers and going
[2:10:08] through motion and quoting his words and
[2:10:10] he's on the outside
[2:10:13] trying to get in,
[2:10:17] knocking. Then he finally just says,
[2:10:19] "Hey, forget it. We're not going to
[2:10:22] reform this old system.
[2:10:28] Who will whoever whosoever will open the
[2:10:30] door
[2:10:32] their door I will come in and suck with
[2:10:35] them.
[2:10:38] So you know they rejected him. Let's
[2:10:41] consider the stages of decline that the
[2:10:43] early church went through a process that
[2:10:46] really ought to stir our hearts today as
[2:10:49] and and bring us a holy fear as we see
[2:10:52] the message movement decline. When the
[2:10:55] Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost,
[2:10:57] the church was pure, simple, and full of
[2:11:00] power. Can you say amen? Amen. Acts
[2:11:04] chapter 2 said and I quoted it already.
[2:11:07] They continued daily in the apostles
[2:11:09] doctrine and breaking bread with
[2:11:11] gladness, oneness of heart. Everybody
[2:11:14] was one great sweet group. Many signs
[2:11:18] and wonders was doing
[2:11:20] they shared all things in common. They
[2:11:22] worshiped with sincerity. They they they
[2:11:25] walked in supernatural power. There was
[2:11:28] no class. There was no fame. There was
[2:11:29] no pride. Just a people born of the
[2:11:32] spirit. Amen.
[2:11:35] Consumed with the presence of Jesus
[2:11:37] Christ, so in love with him. They were
[2:11:40] ignorant and unlearned men whose
[2:11:41] credentials were. They had been with
[2:11:44] Jesus.
[2:11:45] Oh God, let that be our credentials.
[2:11:48] Amen. Amen. Let that be our credential.
[2:11:51] I have been with Jesus. And everybody
[2:11:54] can tell it.
[2:11:56] But Satan
[2:11:58] began to come in as something began to
[2:12:00] shift.
[2:12:02] Watch now.
[2:12:04] First thing you know, there were
[2:12:05] murmuring and division
[2:12:08] in the church.
[2:12:11] You see, Satan couldn't stop the
[2:12:13] outpouring.
[2:12:15] So, he infiltrated it.
[2:12:20] He began to sow murmuring and
[2:12:23] discontent.
[2:12:28] And the Grecians started complaining
[2:12:32] that the Jewish widows were being
[2:12:34] favored and the Grecian widows were
[2:12:37] neglected in the daily administration.
[2:12:40] So they made it all a racial thing.
[2:12:46] You know, they played on prejudice
[2:12:50] and the enemy whispered in the ears of
[2:12:52] the church,
[2:12:55] "You deserve more.
[2:12:57] you're being overlooked and this isn't
[2:13:00] fair. We're always getting left out. Ah,
[2:13:04] they think they're better than anyone
[2:13:06] else. We're We're just not in the click.
[2:13:19] Well, I tell you what,
[2:13:22] if you ain't figured it out yet, I'm a
[2:13:24] very clickious preacher.
[2:13:28] I click with everybody in the church.
[2:13:33] You're all God's children and I love
[2:13:35] every one of you.
[2:13:38] My grandchildren, I asked him the other
[2:13:40] day, you know, Aaliyah said was saying,
[2:13:43] you know, maybe I was her favorite. I
[2:13:45] wasn't okay. I said, who is Papa's
[2:13:47] favorite?
[2:13:49] She said, well, maybe maybe
[2:13:53] Luke. Um, then they come up maybe Katie.
[2:13:57] I said, you know, since you can't figure
[2:13:59] it out, it shows you I don't have
[2:14:01] favors.
[2:14:04] And if you ain't figured out, I don't
[2:14:06] have favorites.
[2:14:08] You're all God's children. I love every
[2:14:09] one of you.
[2:14:11] Amen. And as far as I'm concerned, we're
[2:14:13] all in one big click right here. We're
[2:14:15] clicking with each one of us. Amen. But
[2:14:18] some, you know, murmuring gets in. You
[2:14:21] know, why they think they're better than
[2:14:22] anyone else. and we're not in the click.
[2:14:24] And slowly because of the murmuring, the
[2:14:27] unity began to fracture.
[2:14:30] And now instead of they continued daily
[2:14:33] with a with with one accord in in the
[2:14:36] temple, breaking bread from house to
[2:14:38] house with gladness and singleness of
[2:14:40] heart, there was resentment and
[2:14:43] prejudice and murmuring and gossip and
[2:14:46] tailbearing among believers.
[2:14:50] But that was only beginning. you you
[2:14:52] find brother Brandon describe how the
[2:14:54] devil got in the and took root in the
[2:14:57] early church and for you if you want to
[2:14:59] reference it write it down it's in the
[2:15:01] second seal paragraph 128 through 147
[2:15:04] and you know what it started with it
[2:15:07] started with the quest for
[2:15:09] respectability
[2:15:10] and the fall of simplicity
[2:15:16] and those first converts you know they
[2:15:18] were mostly slaves
[2:15:20] the poor the outcasts, the forgotten of
[2:15:23] society,
[2:15:25] and they received the Holy Ghost with
[2:15:27] gladness and went out testifying boldly
[2:15:30] even to their own masters and their
[2:15:32] passion and their joy and their their
[2:15:35] powerful supernatural lives. They could
[2:15:38] not deny it. God was working among them.
[2:15:43] And others began to take notice. And
[2:15:45] soon there were military officers and
[2:15:48] what you know the centurion for one you
[2:15:51] know I wouldn't put him in this group
[2:15:53] but but as as one but here again a man
[2:15:58] of class a man of authority a man of
[2:16:01] prestige a man who was wealthy enough
[2:16:05] that he he was recognized by God for
[2:16:08] giving arms to the church.
[2:16:12] Right? So, you know, there came men like
[2:16:15] that, military officers and Roman
[2:16:18] captains and people of status and
[2:16:20] influence. They began to take notice of
[2:16:23] this powerful uh new faith and and they
[2:16:26] couldn't ignore the miracles. They
[2:16:28] couldn't deny the undeniable
[2:16:31] transformation in people's lives.
[2:16:35] But there was a problem.
[2:16:38] And here it is.
[2:16:40] Pentecost was far too messy for them.
[2:16:46] Oh, they couldn't reconcile the power of
[2:16:49] God with the setting it came in. Humble
[2:16:52] homes, darkened basement, cavelike rooms
[2:16:56] filled with men and women clapping their
[2:16:58] hands and shouting and speaking in
[2:17:00] tongues and weeping on their knees. It
[2:17:03] like the grander
[2:17:05] that they were always associated with
[2:17:08] religion. It was just too disorderly.
[2:17:12] It just wasn't dignified enough.
[2:17:16] Oh, God. Brother Brandham preached
[2:17:18] sermons like this. He preached on it.
[2:17:20] You You listen to one in 55 called
[2:17:22] Pride.
[2:17:24] Amen. I tell you what, you know, pride
[2:17:27] where they, you know, he said in that
[2:17:29] sermon, you ought to get out of order
[2:17:31] once in a while enough to get saved.
[2:17:36] Amen. We ought to break order every once
[2:17:39] in a while so the spirit can move. Get
[2:17:43] out of your dignity, you know, your
[2:17:45] dignitary ways and your starchy colors
[2:17:48] and get rid of all of that and let the
[2:17:50] Holy Ghost have preeminence.
[2:17:54] For centuries, the Jews and Gentiles,
[2:17:56] they they have viewed true worship as uh
[2:17:59] dignified and ceremonial and and and led
[2:18:03] by highly educated men and great flowing
[2:18:06] robes and and is speaking in soft tones
[2:18:10] behind golden altars and magnificent
[2:18:12] temples. And you remember they even the
[2:18:15] disciples brought Jesus to look at the
[2:18:17] ornate structure that Herod had built
[2:18:21] to look at and showed him the wonders of
[2:18:24] the temple and he said he said I'll tell
[2:18:26] you what he said there come a day that
[2:18:29] there won't be one stone left on
[2:18:31] another.
[2:18:33] Amen. He condemned the whole thing. You
[2:18:35] see, true religion in their minds came
[2:18:38] with tradition, with great titles, with
[2:18:40] positions, with the trappings of
[2:18:43] respectability. And they were used to
[2:18:45] formal addresses,
[2:18:48] not fiery spirit-led preaching.
[2:18:52] They were used to ritual and not
[2:18:54] revival.
[2:18:56] Hello.
[2:18:57] Let me say it again. They were used to
[2:18:59] ritual and not revival. They were
[2:19:01] prepared for creeds, not cloven tongues
[2:19:04] of fire. They were used to formal classy
[2:19:07] preachers that were mixed in their
[2:19:10] message with psychology instead of
[2:19:12] dynamic spiritfilled sermons that
[2:19:15] changed lives. That went forth with
[2:19:18] power and healed the sick. Come on,
[2:19:21] church. Amen. I know the power of this
[2:19:24] word. I've seen it go forth and and
[2:19:27] while the preaching of the word is going
[2:19:28] to people healed right in their seats,
[2:19:30] people saved right in their seats.
[2:19:32] Habits leave them right in their seats.
[2:19:34] Spirits leave them right in their seats.
[2:19:37] Come on. I know the power of this
[2:19:39] gospel. But it doesn't come from
[2:19:42] intellectual preaching. It comes from
[2:19:44] dynamic Holy Ghost anointing
[2:19:47] spiritfilled men that fills men and
[2:19:50] women with the same power.
[2:19:53] Hallelujah.
[2:19:57] But they were too used to classy
[2:19:59] speeches mixed with psychology.
[2:20:04] These men are full of new wines, they
[2:20:07] said on the day of Pentecost.
[2:20:09] To the religious elite, it looked like
[2:20:11] madness.
[2:20:16] To the dignified, it looked disgraceful.
[2:20:19] To God, it was the birth of his church.
[2:20:24] Hallelujah. So what did they do? What'
[2:20:27] they do about this? They were
[2:20:28] embarrassed by Didn't you know, Brother
[2:20:30] Brandham tells us in one of his last
[2:20:33] sermons he preaches called ashamed of
[2:20:36] him.
[2:20:37] And he said they would be ashamed of
[2:20:40] speaking in tongues. They would be
[2:20:42] ashamed of the moving of the spirit.
[2:20:45] They would be ashamed. Listen, it's
[2:20:47] coming. It's not only coming. It's
[2:20:48] already here. Men are ashamed of it.
[2:20:52] They want to tone it down, quieten it
[2:20:53] down, you know, move it out of the
[2:20:56] church. They get embarrassed.
[2:21:03] Brother Brandon said, "Does it embarrass
[2:21:04] you to say, "Yes, I believe in divine
[2:21:07] healing.
[2:21:09] Yes, I believe in speaking in tongues.
[2:21:12] Yes, I believe in the moving the
[2:21:14] spirit."
[2:21:16] and he prophesies
[2:21:18] of the church that it would be ashamed
[2:21:21] of him.
[2:21:28] So what did they do?
[2:21:30] They dressed it up.
[2:21:34] They brought in structure,
[2:21:36] formality,
[2:21:38] hierarchy,
[2:21:40] respectability.
[2:21:42] They exchanged the fire for form,
[2:21:45] anointing for acceptance,
[2:21:48] power for polish.
[2:21:52] But in trying to make it more
[2:21:53] presentable to men, they made it less
[2:21:56] acceptable to God
[2:21:59] and they rejected the Holy Ghost.
[2:22:02] So what did the influential do? They
[2:22:05] tried to dress it up.
[2:22:08] They softened his edges
[2:22:11] until they were as Paul described them
[2:22:13] having this form of godliness
[2:22:16] but denied power.
[2:22:18] You see this is always the danger. Hear
[2:22:22] me. The danger it comes when men try to
[2:22:26] tame what God has birthed in the fire.
[2:22:30] I'm telling you church, we shouldn't try
[2:22:33] to tame it.
[2:22:35] I've seen it happen too many times. A
[2:22:38] fire gets started at youth camp and
[2:22:40] among the young people in the message
[2:22:42] and they go back to the church and they
[2:22:43] throw a wet blanket on it. Brother, I
[2:22:46] would say I wouldn't. We don't do that
[2:22:48] here and we're not going to do that
[2:22:49] here. I'm not throwing a wet blanket on.
[2:22:51] I'm going to blow on it and blow on it
[2:22:54] and blow on it. Hallelujah. I'm going to
[2:22:57] add more wood to the fire. Let it blaze
[2:23:00] higher. Let it consume sin. Let it raise
[2:23:04] people in righteousness. Let it fill
[2:23:06] people with the Holy Ghost. Let it
[2:23:08] empower the believers
[2:23:11] until devils can't sit in the church
[2:23:13] anymore.
[2:23:15] Amen. Until the Holy Spirit reigns in
[2:23:18] the hearts of men and women and they
[2:23:20] champion the Holy Ghost in our midst.
[2:23:27] I'll just tell you right now, the
[2:23:29] message was never meant to be pretty.
[2:23:36] It came rough
[2:23:38] without culture
[2:23:40] with a seventh grade Kentucky uneducated
[2:23:44] with halting words.
[2:23:48] Amen. But with power, with anointing,
[2:23:51] with supernatural, with the Holy Ghost,
[2:23:54] undeniably.
[2:23:56] Come on, somebody.
[2:23:58] It was never meant to be fitted to human
[2:24:01] systems.
[2:24:02] Amen. It was loud. It was raw. It was
[2:24:06] unpolished. But it was pure. It was
[2:24:08] real. It was God.
[2:24:11] Hallelujah. And I don't care how it
[2:24:13] come. That's the way I want it. It be
[2:24:16] God.
[2:24:18] Let it come raw. Let it come pure. Let
[2:24:21] it come unish.
[2:24:28] God birthed the church with the power of
[2:24:31] the spirit, with a supernatural
[2:24:33] outpouring.
[2:24:35] He birthed a glorious church and
[2:24:38] brother, it was emotional.
[2:24:42] Hello. It vibrated with the spirit. But
[2:24:46] then Satan swed his seed of discrepancy
[2:24:51] into the field. Give you some homework.
[2:24:53] Go listen to see the discrepancy.
[2:24:57] The womb of the church.
[2:25:00] Now,
[2:25:02] not only was there holy church born of
[2:25:05] the seed of the son of man, but now in
[2:25:09] the same movement,
[2:25:11] there was the sewing of the seed of the
[2:25:13] serpent as he cast his seed
[2:25:17] quietly in the night. Suddenly, nobody
[2:25:21] noticed.
[2:25:26] So out of the womb of the church
[2:25:30] there was birth the nicicoatan spirit.
[2:25:35] This is where the nicicoatan spirit
[2:25:39] crept in. You know what it was? It was
[2:25:42] to conquer the leoty.
[2:25:46] Hello.
[2:25:47] to take the spirit out of the church and
[2:25:51] put it on one man
[2:25:53] until
[2:25:55] there is no longer the power of God in
[2:25:58] the pew.
[2:26:02] And the best brother Brandham said we'd
[2:26:04] have is a few inspired ministers while
[2:26:08] the people just sat there trying to
[2:26:10] absorb it.
[2:26:18] So this is where the nickelan spirit
[2:26:20] crept in. They desired to replace the
[2:26:22] Holy Ghost with fire, with religious
[2:26:25] forms. And God said, "I hate it. How's
[2:26:29] he going to marry a bride to the age?
[2:26:32] He can't."
[2:26:34] No. You see, they wanted to keep the
[2:26:36] name Christian, but remove the
[2:26:38] experience.
[2:26:40] Ah, like many want to do today, keep the
[2:26:42] name message, but remove the experience.
[2:26:45] They wanted the teachings of Jesus
[2:26:47] without the power of Pentecost. They
[2:26:49] wanted order, not outpouring. They
[2:26:50] wanted robes instead of righteousness.
[2:26:53] They wanted titles instead of tongues.
[2:26:55] They wanted cathedrals instead of
[2:26:57] communion with God. They couldn't stoop
[2:27:00] to shout and stagger like drunk men
[2:27:02] under the power of God. It was
[2:27:04] embarrassing to their business partners,
[2:27:06] un unpresentable to their social circle.
[2:27:10] So they cleaned it up and in doing so
[2:27:14] they grieve the Holy Spirit.
[2:27:20] The same spirit
[2:27:22] deceived Eve.
[2:27:25] that deception that said, "Yeah, hath
[2:27:28] God said
[2:27:31] and quote unquote
[2:27:34] to do what?
[2:27:36] For what reason?
[2:27:39] To sew a seed of discrepancy.
[2:27:46] It didn't deny the word,
[2:27:49] it twisted it.
[2:27:55] It added just enough polish to make it
[2:27:58] appealing.
[2:28:00] And just like Eve reached for something
[2:28:02] more refined and opened her womb for the
[2:28:05] serpent to sew his seed, so the early
[2:28:07] church began trading power for polish
[2:28:10] and presence for for position and truth
[2:28:13] for tradition and in turn became the
[2:28:18] horish woman of Revelation 17. You talk
[2:28:21] about a fall.
[2:28:24] She started out as the virgin church and
[2:28:27] winds up being the great
[2:28:34] And it didn't happen overnight.
[2:28:37] That's why the Bible said that we should
[2:28:40] hold on to these things less at any time
[2:28:43] we should let them slip. And that word
[2:28:46] actually means like a leaking vessel
[2:28:49] just going, you know, very very subtly
[2:28:52] seeping out little at a time till you
[2:28:54] don't even know it's gone.
[2:29:00] The church stopped looking like the
[2:29:03] upper room started looking like Rome.
[2:29:06] Actually modeled mis mister Babylon.
[2:29:10] And as dignitaries flooded in, the Holy
[2:29:12] Ghost was pushed out. And Brother
[2:29:15] Brandham feared they would take a
[2:29:16] substitute form of religion. And he
[2:29:20] warned his church. I'm talking he's
[2:29:23] talking to believers of his message.
[2:29:26] He warned his church. And he preached
[2:29:29] this sermon called a deceived church by
[2:29:32] the world. Another homework project.
[2:29:37] And the reason he said that people go
[2:29:39] and join organizations substitute a
[2:29:41] handshake instead of a new birth.
[2:29:43] They're trying to bypass a new birth.
[2:29:45] They don't want the new birth. They want
[2:29:47] they know we teach in the Bible and so
[2:29:49] they want to substitute something for
[2:29:51] it. And the Pentecostal people are just
[2:29:52] as bad trying to substitute something.
[2:29:55] They want it in class. It must be so
[2:29:58] classy. We'll shake hands and join the
[2:30:00] church and be sprinkled or baptized or
[2:30:03] something. They're afraid of the new
[2:30:04] birth. I believe sometimes believe the
[2:30:07] Brandham tabernacles getting afraid of
[2:30:09] it. Now we all know about the birth. I
[2:30:13] don't care where it is or where it's
[2:30:14] about. It's a mess. A baby born on a sh
[2:30:17] pile or a hard floor or in a pink
[2:30:19] decorated hospital room, it's a mess
[2:30:21] anyhow. A birth of a calf, a birth of
[2:30:23] anything else is a mess. And a new birth
[2:30:25] is nothing less than a mess. But people
[2:30:27] want us are so starchy.
[2:30:30] We just go over there where they shake
[2:30:32] hands. will go where they don't ball and
[2:30:34] cry and beat on the altar and cry out.
[2:30:36] You want to be too human. What we need
[2:30:39] is a birth dying out to bring forth
[2:30:42] life. A seed, an old potato, a seed
[2:30:45] potato. You take that potato, put in the
[2:30:47] ground until you can have a new potato.
[2:30:50] That potato has to rot. A corn cannot
[2:30:52] produce new life till it's rotten. And
[2:30:54] if a man or woman can never have a new
[2:30:57] birth until their intellectuals and
[2:30:59] their own self is rotten dead die out at
[2:31:02] the altar and scream and get messed up
[2:31:05] to a place that the starch gets out of
[2:31:07] your collar and you're born again by the
[2:31:09] spirit of God. He said, "I don't care if
[2:31:12] you squall." It's direct quote Timothy
[2:31:15] says,
[2:31:17] direct quote now. I don't care if you
[2:31:19] squall, speak in tongues, jump up and
[2:31:21] down, flop like a chicken with its head
[2:31:24] off. You're bringing forth new lives.
[2:31:27] But we substitute something for it. We
[2:31:29] want it in the classical way.
[2:31:34] And that same spirit is alive today.
[2:31:36] It's the poison of the tears among the
[2:31:38] wheat.
[2:31:40] Churches are filled with influence,
[2:31:42] money, psychology, production,
[2:31:45] performance. But where's the fire?
[2:31:49] Where's the trembling? Where's the
[2:31:50] brokenness?
[2:31:52] We must not forget that God's chosen the
[2:31:54] foolish things of the world to confound
[2:31:56] the wise so that no flesh can glory in
[2:31:59] his presence.
[2:32:01] We don't need a dressed up gospel.
[2:32:04] We don't need a polished up message. We
[2:32:07] need a raw unfiltered power of the Holy
[2:32:10] Ghost like they had in the beginning. We
[2:32:12] need to go back first stage, you know,
[2:32:14] back to that fire, back to the real
[2:32:16] reality of the original Pentecost, back
[2:32:19] to the weed and away from the tears.
[2:32:23] So, let me just kind of wind us down
[2:32:25] with this as I just ask, you know, and
[2:32:28] I'm not talking about, you know, I'm I'm
[2:32:31] just talking about the movement
[2:32:33] worldwide. Where is the power of our
[2:32:35] church? Where is the glory that once
[2:32:38] burned with such fire? What happened to
[2:32:40] us?
[2:32:41] too much. We have traded the power of
[2:32:43] God for the wisdom of men. Pulpits are
[2:32:46] filled now and you're going to see them
[2:32:49] rise with polished intellects,
[2:32:52] psychologists instead of burning hearts
[2:32:57] with a Holy Ghost anointing. Oh, our
[2:33:00] churches becomes stiff, formal, cold.
[2:33:05] Can I say dead?
[2:33:11] made in such a way that they put the
[2:33:13] spirit out. Like the Bible says in
[2:33:15] Revelation 3,
[2:33:17] the mortar's bench has been shoved into
[2:33:21] the basement.
[2:33:24] Tears are rare. Shouts of victory or
[2:33:27] silence and the fire has gone out
[2:33:32] again.
[2:33:34] Left with a form of godliness.
[2:33:39] But believe the power was for another
[2:33:40] day,
[2:33:43] not now.
[2:33:48] I look over here and I see Sister Genie.
[2:33:52] Satan's attacked her again with cancer.
[2:33:59] She don't need a powerless church.
[2:34:04] She don't need a faithless group of
[2:34:06] people.
[2:34:08] She needs a people that believes in the
[2:34:11] power of the living God and sees it work
[2:34:14] among us. And we have. But we can't look
[2:34:18] back to the past. We must bring that
[2:34:20] current.
[2:34:22] We must declare he's alive today. He's
[2:34:26] real today. He heals today. He's in this
[2:34:29] service today. He'll fill with the Holy
[2:34:31] Ghost today. He'll charge you with new
[2:34:33] life today. Oh God, I say, set us on
[2:34:37] fire. Fill us with the Holy Ghost. Pour
[2:34:41] out your spirit once more, Lord.
[2:34:44] Once more.
[2:34:46] Hallelujah.
[2:34:49] Don't let it g be a time where we just
[2:34:52] talk about where the spirit moved
[2:34:54] freely, where saints danced in the
[2:34:55] spirit, where they wept on the altar,
[2:34:58] where they spoke in other tongues. And
[2:34:59] we sit back now with arms folded, hearts
[2:35:02] and moved and cold and formal and
[2:35:04] lukewarm. And even when God performs his
[2:35:08] word with signs and wonders, we get
[2:35:11] barely stirred.
[2:35:14] Like Samson, we once carried the
[2:35:16] anointing and we were a terror to hell,
[2:35:21] but now Samson,
[2:35:23] the Philistines is on you.
[2:35:26] What are we going to do?
[2:35:29] And I speak collectively
[2:35:32] in regard to the message movement. Yeah,
[2:35:34] we have bigger churches. Yes, we have
[2:35:37] greater numbers.
[2:35:39] But I ask, where is the Holy Ghost?
[2:35:43] That's all that matters.
[2:35:47] Where is the real power?
[2:35:50] And I want to say I'm not condemning
[2:35:52] nice buildings. We have nice buildings.
[2:35:56] But I tell you what,
[2:35:58] rather than plush pews, I want to see
[2:36:00] pews are on fire.
[2:36:04] I want to be a rather than sophisticated
[2:36:07] people, I want to see people humble
[2:36:08] enough to be sensitive to the spirit and
[2:36:12] move in the spirit. I want to see a
[2:36:14] people that are alive. Amen. In the
[2:36:17] power of God, who flows in the spirit.
[2:36:20] Amen. who are part of a tree that has
[2:36:23] been restored
[2:36:25] instead of a dead tree that's laying as
[2:36:28] a lifeless trunk across a bra to make a
[2:36:31] bridge for somebody to cross. The devil
[2:36:34] didn't do it all at once.
[2:36:38] Oh, he'll whisper, "You got a nicer
[2:36:39] building now. Hey, tone it down. Tone it
[2:36:42] down, brother Tim. You know, you you can
[2:36:44] tone it down. You know, and you get to
[2:36:48] thinking, if you just get rid of that
[2:36:49] fiery preacher and get somebody
[2:36:51] respectable, I tell you, somebody more
[2:36:53] educated, more eloquent, no more
[2:36:55] dignified. Well, why? Our church will
[2:36:58] really expand. Why? You'll appeal to the
[2:37:02] better class.
[2:37:04] There ain't no better class than God's
[2:37:06] people.
[2:37:07] You're the best class that there is.
[2:37:10] Hallelujah. You're You're Hallelujah.
[2:37:13] You're in God's class. You may not
[2:37:15] equate with the world. You may not
[2:37:18] compare with them. And we don't want to
[2:37:20] be like them. We don't want their formal
[2:37:22] religion. We want the power of the
[2:37:25] living God. We want him to move freely.
[2:37:28] Hallelujah. We want him to speak. We
[2:37:30] want him to heal. We want him to
[2:37:32] deliver. We want him to set free. We
[2:37:34] want to fill him with the Holy Ghost.
[2:37:36] And we should say this morning, God,
[2:37:39] once more, fill my temple. Fill my
[2:37:42] temple with a fresh anointing, a fresh
[2:37:45] spirit, a fresh outpouring. I'm here to
[2:37:48] yield myself to you, Lord.
[2:37:52] I can't live on past reputation. Let the
[2:37:55] musicians come.
[2:37:58] I must press in
[2:38:01] with all of my heart.
[2:38:04] Amen.
[2:38:06] Amen.
[2:38:10] Do you know here recently
[2:38:13] in Europe and I don't want to be
[2:38:15] specific. I don't want to hurt nobody so
[2:38:17] I'm going to be very general here at a
[2:38:19] camp meeting
[2:38:21] there were young people gathered from
[2:38:23] other countries all gathered to this one
[2:38:26] camp meeting.
[2:38:29] And in that camp meeting they had some
[2:38:31] Bible belt
[2:38:34] Holy Ghost anointed preachers.
[2:38:39] that preached under the power of the
[2:38:40] Holy Ghost.
[2:38:43] And do you know it traumatized some of
[2:38:45] the young people, some of the girls come
[2:38:47] crying and screaming to some of the
[2:38:49] elders and saying, "We we're not used to
[2:38:51] kind of this kind of preaching." It
[2:38:52] frightens us because they had never
[2:38:55] heard anointed preaching.
[2:38:58] They had never heard anything but
[2:39:00] intellectual lectures by dead pastors.
[2:39:08] And the spirit of God was so foreign to
[2:39:10] them.
[2:39:12] And when the spirit of God is so far
[2:39:14] into the church that they know nothing
[2:39:17] about casting out devils,
[2:39:20] they know nothing about the spirit of
[2:39:22] God moving. They know nothing about the
[2:39:25] Holy Ghost and a genuine in infilling.
[2:39:30] When it gets to that place,
[2:39:34] they have a name that they're living but
[2:39:38] are dead.
[2:39:42] I want to know,
[2:39:45] are you a Christian by name only?
[2:39:50] Are you a message believer by name only?
[2:39:55] If the veil was opened in your heart,
[2:39:59] is the pillar of fire there?
[2:40:03] I want to know, are you living on past
[2:40:05] reputations when he raised down his hand
[2:40:07] for me?
[2:40:11] Are you living on past reputations
[2:40:18] or what you once were?
[2:40:22] Have you lost that first love
[2:40:27] has murmured got in your heart
[2:40:31] and you no longer can break the bread
[2:40:33] the singleness of heart
[2:40:36] and unity of the spirit.
[2:40:43] He's reaching down for you today.
[2:40:47] [Music]
[2:40:49] Let him speak.
[2:40:52] Let him talk to you in a personal way.
[2:40:57] And you examine your life.
[2:41:00] Where am I?
[2:41:02] [Music]
[2:41:06] If the voice
[2:41:08] would change,
[2:41:11] [Music]
[2:41:14] if it would change from the voice to the
[2:41:17] trumpet,
[2:41:21] would you hear the call?
[2:41:29] Are you a bride prepared
[2:41:32] to meet the bridegroom?
[2:41:36] Or is there things in your life you just
[2:41:38] really need
[2:41:40] to deal with?
[2:41:43] Then be zealous
[2:41:45] and repent.
[2:41:49] When he reached
[2:41:52] down his hand
[2:41:55] for me, I'm so thankful he did.
[2:41:59] He's reaching down this morning.
[2:42:03] [Music]
[2:42:10] Well, I was lost.
[2:42:14] I was undone
[2:42:17] without God.
[2:42:23] [Music]
[2:42:29] One more time. Sing it.
[2:42:31] [Music]
[2:42:39] Is your wall on the altar?
[2:42:42] Is the murmur gone out of your heart?
[2:42:47] Are you still just worried about clicks
[2:42:49] and clams and everything else rather
[2:42:52] than the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[2:42:54] that makes us all one?
[2:43:00] Is it time to really dedicate your life
[2:43:03] a new or maybe dedicated for the first
[2:43:06] time?
[2:43:08] This altar is open.
[2:43:12] You are invited. The spirit of the bride
[2:43:14] say come. When he reached
[2:43:18] down his hand
[2:43:21] for me.
[2:43:26] Oh, and he reached
[2:43:29] way down
[2:43:32] for me.
[2:43:36] Well, I was lost.
[2:43:39] I was undone. God bless you, son.
[2:43:42] There's more.
[2:43:44] There's more. Just find your place
[2:43:46] there.
[2:43:48] I just need to pick up some things
[2:43:50] before God.
[2:43:52] Just invite him to your view where
[2:43:54] you're at right now.
[2:43:57] Well, I was near
[2:44:01] this family
[2:44:03] when he came
[2:44:06] to me. Look what he showed me. He showed
[2:44:09] me it is that I Yes, I could be free.
[2:44:16] Thank you, Lord.
[2:44:18] and he live
[2:44:21] in my what he wants to do for you.
[2:44:25] Name glory complete
[2:44:29] when he reach
[2:44:32] down his hand
[2:44:34] for me. Come on, sing it to him now.
[2:44:39] Oh, and he reached down his hand
[2:44:45] for me. Thank God for me.
[2:44:50] Well, when he
[2:44:52] just make that close down. Amen. For me,
[2:44:58] [Music]
[2:45:00] well, I was born
[2:45:03] [Music]
[2:45:06] without God
[2:45:11] reach
[2:45:13] down.
[2:45:16] Give me another verse, Katie.
[2:45:20] Well, once my soul
[2:45:24] was
[2:45:26] from the heaven
[2:45:31] and it was rich
[2:45:34] and
[2:45:35] [Music]
[2:45:37] as could be.
[2:45:41] Oh, but my savior,
[2:45:44] your love,
[2:45:46] he gave me peace,
[2:45:49] joy and love.
[2:45:52] Oh, he reached
[2:45:54] down his hand.
[2:45:58] Minister, if we need to pray with thee
[2:46:00] some
[2:46:03] reach
[2:46:05] down his hand
[2:46:08] on me.
[2:46:10] [Music]
[2:46:12] Oh, and he reached
[2:46:15] way down
[2:46:18] for me.
[2:46:22] Well, I was lost
[2:46:25] at the D
[2:46:28] without
[2:46:35] down.
[2:46:43] Now my heart
[2:46:45] does rejoice
[2:46:48] since I
[2:46:51] my
[2:46:56] to him.
[2:46:58] Now I plead
[2:47:00] [Applause]
[2:47:03] and now I lean
[2:47:05] on his arms.
[2:47:08] Love secure
[2:47:11] from all
[2:47:16] his
[2:47:18] for
[2:47:29] me.
[2:47:33] Oh, and he re
[2:47:36] way down
[2:47:39] for me.
[2:47:41] [Music]
[2:47:43] Well, I was wrong.
[2:47:46] I could have done
[2:47:49] without God
[2:47:51] or his son.
[2:47:59] Give me that verse again. I was near in
[2:48:01] despair.
[2:48:04] I was near
[2:48:06] in despair
[2:48:09] when he came
[2:48:11] to them
[2:48:14] and he showed
[2:48:17] me

[3:10:28] Jesus the Messiah. I'm glad he's my Lord
[3:10:31] today. And Gabriel is here. He has
[3:10:35] accepted the Lord as his savior. He's
[3:10:37] called on his name. He's believed on the
[3:10:40] Lord. He's repented of his sins. And the
[3:10:43] old Gabe, we're going to bury in this
[3:10:46] watery grave. That's what this is. It's
[3:10:49] a grave. And we're laying him in this
[3:10:52] coffin, burying him in this water
[3:10:55] baptism. But you know what? He's going
[3:10:58] to raise in the newness of life. Not the
[3:11:01] old Gabe raising. No, he won't never
[3:11:03] resurrect again, but this will be him
[3:11:06] walking in the newness of life as a new
[3:11:10] creation in Christ Jesus. That's what we
[3:11:14] believe. Amen. He told us to repent and
[3:11:17] then to be baptized in his name. Then he
[3:11:20] gave us a promise. We shall receive the
[3:11:23] gift of the Holy Ghost. Now, John would
[3:11:25] declare himself as a baptizer, and he
[3:11:28] said, "I baptize you with water, but
[3:11:31] there's one coming after me, and he will
[3:11:34] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[3:11:35] fire." I am John the Baptist. I can
[3:11:39] baptize with water. I cannot feel with
[3:11:42] fire, but there is one that promises to
[3:11:45] come after me that will baptize him with
[3:11:48] the Holy Ghost and fire. Pearly
[3:11:51] thoroughly purge his floor. Burn up the
[3:11:54] chaff out of his life. Make him complete
[3:11:58] full seed of God, grain, the elect,
[3:12:02] ready for the rapture. Amen. Gabriel,
[3:12:05] God has sent me as a servant of his to
[3:12:08] preach the gospel. And he commanded me
[3:12:11] in the scripture. Matthew 28:19 said
[3:12:15] that we should we should get men to
[3:12:18] repent and to be baptized in the name of
[3:12:21] the father and of the son and the holy
[3:12:24] ghost in obedience to his divine
[3:12:27] command. I baptize you in the name of
[3:12:29] the lord Jesus Christ.
[3:12:32] Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:12:35] Amen. Walk in the newness of life, son.
[3:12:37] Hallelujah.
[3:12:39] Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:12:46] Amen.
[3:12:48] He didn't bring us this far just to
[3:12:51] leave us.
[3:12:54] Oh, he didn't teach us to swim to let us
[3:12:59] drown.
[3:13:03] He didn't build his home. Made us
[3:13:07] through.
[3:13:11] Oh, he didn't pick us up. Let us Oh,
[3:13:15] let's sing it one more time before we're
[3:13:17] dismissing.

[3:13:32] [Music]
[3:13:34] He didn't build us in us through way.
[3:13:44] Amen. God bless you. If you're available
[3:13:45] to help move yourself out of the gym, it
[3:13:47] would be appreciated. Oh, he didn't
[3:13:50] bring us this far just to leave us.
[3:13:56] Oh, he didn't teach us to swim, to let
[3:14:00] us drown.
[3:14:05] He didn't build his home in us to move
[3:14:09] away.
[3:14:13] Didn't pick us up.
