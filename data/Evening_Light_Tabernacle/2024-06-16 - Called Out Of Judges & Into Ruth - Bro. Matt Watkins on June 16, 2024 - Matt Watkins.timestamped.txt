[47:44] my goodness I'm so glad to say that I
[47:46] we're almost home it won't be much
[47:48] longer amen now the world is falling
[47:51] apart amen and it's breaking apart at
[47:54] the seam seems like every day you turn
[47:56] on the the news or you click into
[47:58] anything that you can read and the world
[48:00] is just living under prophecy that that
[48:03] that a prophet prophesied and said I
[48:05] prophesy to you the world will go
[48:07] completely insane aren't you glad that
[48:10] in the midst of an insane world we have
[48:12] the mind of Christ amen the sanity of
[48:15] the word of God Amen and that's our
[48:17] stability it's our strength amen it's
[48:20] our it's our Rock it's our high tower
[48:22] it's our Fortress amen and the world can
[48:25] get you know so weary sometimes but
[48:27] David said when my heart is overwhelmed
[48:29] lead me to a rock that is higher than I
[48:32] amen and we have that today God bless
[48:35] you amen Judges chapter 17 and verse 6
[48:39] we're just going to read amen just a few
[48:41] portions of scripture here actually just
[48:43] this one verse and I'll have you be
[48:45] seated I want to minister to you today
[48:47] and I and the Lord even before I came um
[48:51] uh here this this week this for this
[48:53] Sunday service um I thought I would
[48:56] Minister this and and wasn't really sure
[48:58] and then the it worked out where my my
[49:01] father was supposed to be here but we
[49:02] had a death there uh with one of the
[49:05] families at the church and so he had to
[49:07] be there and so the Lord has me here
[49:09] today so I'm just a spare tire fill in
[49:12] so amen now I see brother Joe is not
[49:14] here today so um someone is going to
[49:17] need to take that Amen Corner Spot amen
[49:20] because that's a big void right there so
[49:22] uh you don't let it be a void today you
[49:24] pull on that spot and and if maybe you'd
[49:26] have Haven done that before well you
[49:27] just you you can't be brother Joe but uh
[49:30] you could pull on the word of God Amen
[49:33] praise the Lord Judges chapter 17 but I
[49:35] I want to minister to you I knew the
[49:37] Lord would have me thought the Lord
[49:39] would have me speak this and so he just
[49:41] confirmed it so much to me I'm going to
[49:44] title this called out of
[49:46] judges and into
[49:48] Ruth called out of judges and into Ruth
[49:52] Judges chapter
[49:54] 17 and verse 6 in those days there was
[49:59] no king in
[50:01] Israel and every man did that which was
[50:04] right in his own eyes let's read that
[50:07] again in those days there was no king in
[50:11] Israel and every man did that which was
[50:14] right in his own eyes you'll actually
[50:17] find this and I don't want to take time
[50:18] to have you turn but if you go to
[50:20] chapter 18 chapter 19 chapter 20 I think
[50:24] it's 21 he actually can continues to
[50:27] repeat this message in those days there
[50:31] was no king in Israel and every man did
[50:34] that which was right you see what
[50:36] typifies judges is the same thing that
[50:39] types our age that we live in a world to
[50:43] where there's no
[50:44] King and so everybody does whatever they
[50:48] want to do and whatever they think is
[50:51] right and they've redefined and
[50:53] redefined and and now they're not
[50:55] following any absolute you see when you
[50:58] don't have an absolute you become your
[51:00] own
[51:02] absolute and so the pattern of Judges
[51:05] was a a a pattern to where there was no
[51:08] King every man did that which was right
[51:10] in his own eyes and he just did whatever
[51:12] he wanted to do and you'll find this
[51:14] repeated over and over and over turn to
[51:16] Joel chapter 2 if you have your Bible
[51:30] man we have um some slides and I will'll
[51:33] have those just in a moment but I just
[51:34] want to read a couple scriptures before
[51:36] we have you be seated very familiar
[51:39] scripture Joel chapter
[51:41] 2 and let's just begin reading at verse
[51:45] 28 and it shall come to pass afterward
[51:48] that I will pour out my spirit upon All
[51:52] Flesh somebody say all all I will pour
[51:55] out my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[51:59] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[52:03] your old men shall dream dreams and your
[52:07] young men shall see Visions it sounds
[52:11] like to me that nobody is exempt from
[52:15] this
[52:16] promise that God not only had a promise
[52:19] for the young men but also for the old
[52:21] men not just for the sons but also for
[52:24] the daughters and this promise that he
[52:26] makes in Joel chapter 2 is a promise of
[52:29] restoration that afterward I will pour
[52:32] out my spirit Lord Jesus father we just
[52:35] bow our heads in your presence together
[52:37] giving you Lord complete
[52:40] control Lord Jesus I have many things
[52:43] that I have weighing upon me many
[52:46] directions that I feel pulled in Lord
[52:50] but I believe that you Above All Else
[52:53] Lord God have a word that you want to
[52:55] speak and so Lord I just want to say
[52:58] that I I'm just humbling myself before
[53:01] you now I become subservient Lord to
[53:05] your spirit to the anointing the unction
[53:08] Lord I pray God that you would help each
[53:10] one of us now Lord just pull out from
[53:12] you exactly what we need from the front
[53:15] to the back lord May there not be one of
[53:18] us Lord that is distracted or unfocused
[53:21] Lord but may you tune our hearts right
[53:23] now to synchronize Lord and to be
[53:26] sensitive to what your spirit wants to
[53:29] say Grant it loud Lord to the speaker to
[53:31] the audience Lord I pray that you would
[53:34] be lifted up Lord and may your name be
[53:36] lifted up we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[53:40] amen you can be
[53:44] seated this was the pattern of Judges it
[53:48] was actually a cycle that was going to
[53:51] repeat seven times I almost titled this
[53:55] sermon and it's a funny title but I
[53:57] almost titled this the circle and the
[54:00] line two shapes the circle and the line
[54:05] and the reason is is that you will find
[54:08] in the Book of Judges that judges is all
[54:11] a circle it's a repeating pattern it
[54:14] starts and then it then it it starts
[54:16] good and then it moves past into a cycle
[54:19] and then it repeats over and over and
[54:22] over and there's this constant message
[54:24] there was no King in other words there
[54:27] was no absolute there was no Authority
[54:29] there was no boundary that was just
[54:32] open-ended and and it was the condition
[54:34] that the modern Church would be
[54:36] prophesied to come in today again to
[54:39] where Jesus would say men would become
[54:41] lovers of their own
[54:44] self now that lover of your own self is
[54:47] a prophecy of the age you live in today
[54:50] and it's not that anybody is admiring
[54:52] the beauty of their own self or standing
[54:54] in the mirror and you know I none of us
[54:56] I hope none of us go and get in our
[54:58] bathroom and look at oursel and think oh
[55:00] my I just love myself so much quite the
[55:03] opposite but actually what it's speaking
[55:06] of is that men would become lovers of
[55:09] their own
[55:10] self to where human thought or rational
[55:14] idea would become exalted above the
[55:17] knowledge of the word of
[55:19] God and so this is the age that you live
[55:22] in that men would become their own
[55:24] absolute they would become their own own
[55:26] Compass they would become their own
[55:28] authority and because of this men would
[55:31] would literally exalt their their
[55:33] thinking and their ideas to replace the
[55:36] place of God this is the reason why we
[55:39] live in the information technology age
[55:42] even the Advent of the internet and
[55:44] blogs and social media and all of those
[55:47] things I'm not preaching against those
[55:48] things I'm just wanting you to get your
[55:50] spiritual thinking caps on today to
[55:52] realize that the world that you see its
[55:55] condition that it's in didn't just end
[55:56] up here this isn't just an accident but
[55:59] it's actually on
[56:01] time because this story that you're
[56:04] living is his
[56:06] story and so God's controlling
[56:08] everything he's controlling politics
[56:10] he's controlling econ the economic world
[56:13] the political world the all of the the
[56:15] the the pain the chaos that you see in
[56:17] the world is uh not by accident but it's
[56:20] actually right on time to where men
[56:22] would be exalt themselves and exalt
[56:25] their thinking and exalt their ideas it
[56:27] would be the age of man and the age of
[56:29] self to where men would be able to
[56:31] express themselves in such a way and and
[56:34] you think of the Advent of of a man of
[56:37] blogs and and you know and what they're
[56:40] thinking and what their ideas are it's
[56:41] been a great and some ways a great
[56:43] positive and some ways a great negative
[56:46] we've gotten so detailed today to where
[56:48] people want to let everybody know not
[56:50] just what they're thinking but what they
[56:52] ate that day uh what what they want to
[56:54] eat that day the mood that they're in if
[56:56] they're feeling up if they're feeling
[56:57] down if they're feeling happy if they're
[56:59] feeling sad and then they would post
[57:02] that on the world for the world to see
[57:04] because think about it friends it's an
[57:06] exaltation of self it's an exaltation of
[57:10] what your pain is or what you've
[57:12] suffered or what you've had to go
[57:13] through and we live in a world to where
[57:15] everybody's it's all so they are they
[57:18] are uh intoxicated with
[57:21] themsel listen uh we're to remember I
[57:24] preached on suffering on Wednesday night
[57:26] and I believe in all of that but let me
[57:28] just say you're not to become so
[57:30] self-focused on everything that you've
[57:32] went through in your life and fact the B
[57:35] Paul said that we may know him not to
[57:37] think about our own suffering but in the
[57:38] fellowship of his
[57:40] suffering and so the world would
[57:43] literally become a place of chaos
[57:45] because of this judges cycle to where
[57:47] there was no King there was no absolute
[57:50] there was no there was no ruler but men
[57:52] would become the lover of their their
[57:54] own self and I just want to say today
[57:57] that you live in the Fulfillment of that
[57:59] you're living literally in a world to
[58:01] where people exalt themselves what they
[58:04] think what their their what their ideas
[58:06] are and you live in a world of social
[58:08] media where things are constantly being
[58:10] given to you and constantly being pushed
[58:12] to you whether it's a notification
[58:14] whether it's a feed listen you know I
[58:16] just want to say something very simple
[58:18] have you ever noticed that your
[58:19] Instagram and your Facebook and your I'm
[58:22] going to get old here cuz I don't know
[58:23] all some of the new ones I thought a
[58:25] real was the same thing as be real and I
[58:27] found out that it's totally different
[58:30] and so uh uh I don't even know what be
[58:32] real is but I mean I'm really showing my
[58:35] age but let me just say this those
[58:38] things are caught a feed because they're
[58:40] feeding you
[58:43] something and many people don't realize
[58:45] you're feeding yourself with something
[58:48] and then you feed and you feed and you
[58:50] feed and you feed and you think my I
[58:52] feel imp I feel depressed I feel anxiety
[58:54] I I got so much listen I we more than
[58:56] ever before we live in an age where
[58:58] young people are feeling more anxiety
[59:01] and more these are demon Spirits we give
[59:03] them name but they're the names but
[59:04] they're just Demons of Oppression and
[59:06] and we're feeling D we're feeling
[59:08] depressed and and those things are real
[59:10] and anxiety and you're feeling fear do
[59:12] you realize I wonder sometimes the very
[59:14] thing that you want delivered from is
[59:17] the very thing sometimes if we'd be
[59:18] honest it's the very thing we're
[59:21] feeding all
[59:23] right and we feed upon those things and
[59:26] constantly thumbing going through it and
[59:28] going through it and ingesting it and
[59:30] constant you know what's amazing brother
[59:31] Aaron I have never one time turned on a
[59:34] tape and listened to a tape of God's
[59:36] prophet and ever ended the tape feeling
[59:42] depressed I have never one time opened
[59:44] my Bible and read my Bible Brother Sam
[59:46] and thought Oh I'm just so I got so much
[59:48] fear and so much anxiety and so much
[59:51] worry but how many times do we get on
[59:53] the news come on somebody do we get on
[59:55] our Facebook do we get on some kind of a
[59:57] feed and then we feel pressure we feel
[59:59] worried we feel stressed I think it's
[1:00:01] time we stop feeding on the wrong things
[1:00:05] and start feeding on the thing that
[1:00:06] gives us peace and joy and love and
[1:00:09] harmony oh friends let me just say if
[1:00:11] there was ever a generation where you
[1:00:13] need to hear from the voice of God and
[1:00:16] not hear from some worldly view it's
[1:00:19] today if there was ever a day where we
[1:00:21] need to hear the voice of God's Prophet
[1:00:24] it's not a day to listen l yes it's a
[1:00:26] day to listen
[1:00:28] more oh do we have a church that
[1:00:30] believes that today it's not time to
[1:00:33] quiet that voice it's a time to amplify
[1:00:36] that voice of God that speaks to you in
[1:00:38] your life and tells you not your uh you
[1:00:41] know not that you're not going to make
[1:00:42] it but it tells you you're going to make
[1:00:44] it child greater is he that is in you
[1:00:46] than he that is in the
[1:00:49] world so this was the the world that we
[1:00:52] would live in it would be a world that
[1:00:54] would be full of fear full of pressure
[1:00:56] full of stress full of anxiety and it
[1:00:59] would be a world that would go
[1:01:00] completely
[1:01:02] insane it's incredible when you look at
[1:01:05] this in Judges chapter 2 and if you have
[1:01:06] your Bible I have you turn quickly if
[1:01:09] you just want to turn there to Judges
[1:01:11] chapter 2 and I want you to notice
[1:01:13] because I want you to see the pattern
[1:01:16] here of judges and the cycle of this
[1:01:19] judges cycle as it goes because God is
[1:01:22] going to send them everything that they
[1:01:24] need to come conquer the land of Canaan
[1:01:28] they're going to have a prophet they're
[1:01:30] going to have Moses they're going to
[1:01:32] have the instructions not only that but
[1:01:35] further they're going to have a promise
[1:01:37] and God is going to come through this
[1:01:39] prophet and he's going to tell them I I
[1:01:41] I here's the instructions of what you're
[1:01:43] to do when you cross into the land of
[1:01:45] Canaan you're to drive out all the
[1:01:49] inhabitants of the land from before
[1:01:52] you destroy all their pictures destroy
[1:01:56] all their images destroy all their high
[1:01:59] places and God says don't let any of
[1:02:03] them remain from among
[1:02:05] them and he says and if you allow those
[1:02:09] things to remain then they shall be
[1:02:12] Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your
[1:02:15] side Hall couldn't imagine things more
[1:02:18] painful than a thorn in my eye but God
[1:02:22] says through Moses through the prophet I
[1:02:24] want you to utterly destroy them I want
[1:02:27] you to completely drive them out and so
[1:02:30] then we pick it up in Judges chapter 1
[1:02:33] and we see that through this through
[1:02:35] these instructions they have a promise
[1:02:38] they have a prophet and God says for
[1:02:40] behold I have given you the land to
[1:02:44] possess
[1:02:46] it you say well what more would they
[1:02:49] need here's the crescendo of the whole
[1:02:51] moment here's
[1:02:53] everything every reason that they left
[1:02:56] Egypt as going to Climax and Crescendo
[1:02:59] at this moment in Canaan yet when you go
[1:03:04] and read your Bible in Judges chapter 1
[1:03:07] outside of Caleb you'll find that the
[1:03:09] Bible says Manasseh didn't drive out all
[1:03:12] the inhabitants of bethen and her town
[1:03:15] and tanic and her towns and the
[1:03:17] inhabitants of eam and and her towns it
[1:03:20] moves on to Asher and it says neither
[1:03:23] did Asher drive out all the inhabitants
[1:03:26] from the land but he allowed the iron
[1:03:29] chariots to stay in the valley he could
[1:03:31] never get Victory he got Victory here
[1:03:33] but he could never fully get Victory
[1:03:36] here and then you move on to Nepali and
[1:03:39] the Bible records that Nepali didn't get
[1:03:41] total Victory it goes through all of the
[1:03:44] potential all of those men now notice
[1:03:47] this is the judge of cycle it was a
[1:03:50] cycle to where there was moments of
[1:03:52] Victory moments of great Revival moments
[1:03:56] of things to Rejoice over great battles
[1:03:59] and great things to you know that God
[1:04:01] sent but with mixed in with those great
[1:04:04] victories was great
[1:04:09] defeat and in fact it would be those
[1:04:12] valleys and mountains and those ups and
[1:04:15] those downs and God says because you
[1:04:19] didn't completely drive out because you
[1:04:21] didn't completely have Victory God says
[1:04:24] now those things things which you let
[1:04:27] remain shall be Pricks in your eyes and
[1:04:29] thorns in your sides and shall Vex you
[1:04:33] in the land wherein you dwell it's
[1:04:36] incredible because this pattern actually
[1:04:38] repeats over and over and God then sends
[1:04:41] an angel in Judges chapter 2 can we read
[1:04:44] it together in Judges chapter 2 it says
[1:04:47] in verse one an angel of the Lord came
[1:04:49] up from gilg God of bokam said I made
[1:04:51] you to go up out of Egypt I brought you
[1:04:53] into the land which I swore to your
[1:04:55] father and said I will never break my
[1:04:57] Covenant you shall make no league with
[1:04:58] the inhabitants of this land you shall
[1:05:00] third on their altars and notice this
[1:05:02] here but you have not obeyed my voice
[1:05:05] and God says why have you done
[1:05:09] this and you shall make no leak you
[1:05:11] shall throw down their altars wherefore
[1:05:14] I also said I will not drive them out
[1:05:15] from before you but they shall be as
[1:05:17] thorns in your sides and their gods
[1:05:20] they're Gods lowercase G O
[1:05:23] DS and their gods
[1:05:26] shall be a snare or a trap unto
[1:05:30] you the Bible says that when the a angel
[1:05:33] of the Lord spoke these words that all
[1:05:36] of the people lifted up their voice and
[1:05:39] wept and they called the name of the
[1:05:42] notice this is a great rebuke from the
[1:05:44] Lord it was such a let down after such
[1:05:50] potential after such a
[1:05:53] promise after such a victory
[1:05:56] notice every reason the whole reason God
[1:05:58] brings them out of Egypt into this land
[1:06:02] is not to fall
[1:06:08] short and the Bible says they lifted up
[1:06:11] their voices and wept and they called
[1:06:14] the name of that place bokeum and they
[1:06:16] sacrificed there unto the Lord now
[1:06:19] what's incredible as you keep going
[1:06:21] through Judges chapter 2 as you find
[1:06:23] that the Bible says when Jacob Joshua
[1:06:25] I'm sorry it let the people go that the
[1:06:27] children of Israel went every man to his
[1:06:29] own inheritance to possess the land and
[1:06:31] the Bible says this verse here in verse
[1:06:33] seven and the people serve the Lord all
[1:06:37] the days of
[1:06:40] Joshua the people served the Lord all
[1:06:44] the days of
[1:06:45] Joshua and all of the notice and the
[1:06:48] days of the elders that outlived Joshua
[1:06:52] who had seen all the great works of the
[1:06:55] Lord and Joshua the son of nun died
[1:06:57] being 110 years old they buried and also
[1:07:00] all now notice this you say well what
[1:07:03] happened I thought God made a promise
[1:07:05] here was this great Wicked here was this
[1:07:07] great word and this great curse that was
[1:07:09] going to come but I want you to notice
[1:07:13] actually it was not the generation of
[1:07:16] fathers but it was the generation of
[1:07:21] sons and I'm preaching to you today on
[1:07:23] this and we read it out of Joel chapter
[1:07:25] chapter 2 because I want to show you the
[1:07:27] powerful correlation between a father
[1:07:31] and a
[1:07:33] son because it was actually not going to
[1:07:36] be Joshua but it was or that entire
[1:07:40] generation but actually the scripture
[1:07:43] goes on and says they serve the Lord
[1:07:45] they live for the Lord say well I guess
[1:07:47] we dodged a
[1:07:48] bullet I guess we got by I mean here God
[1:07:52] made this all this word it was going to
[1:07:54] come to pass and it shall be thorns in
[1:07:56] your enemies but I think we did okay
[1:07:58] guys the whole generation and all the
[1:08:01] others they're they're buried everything
[1:08:02] looks good I mean but notice what it
[1:08:05] says keep reading here in verse 8 and
[1:08:08] verse 9 they buried him in verse 10 and
[1:08:12] also all that generation were gathered
[1:08:15] under their fathers and there
[1:08:18] arose another
[1:08:21] generation after them which knew not the
[1:08:28] Lord nor yet The Works which he had done
[1:08:31] for
[1:08:32] Israel and the children of Israel did
[1:08:35] evil in the sight of the Lord and served
[1:08:39] balum they forsook the Lord God of their
[1:08:42] fathers which brought them out of the
[1:08:45] land of Egypt and followed other
[1:08:47] lowercase
[1:08:49] gos gods of the Gods of the people that
[1:08:54] were round about them and bowed
[1:08:58] themselves unto them and provoke the
[1:09:01] Lord to
[1:09:03] anger incredible because the curse was
[1:09:07] not going to come upon the fathers
[1:09:09] though it was the fathers because of
[1:09:12] their incomplete Victory come on
[1:09:14] somebody don't let me lose you here
[1:09:17] because of their inability to get
[1:09:19] victory in their own life because of
[1:09:22] something about their testimony because
[1:09:25] of something that they allowed in their
[1:09:26] life in their
[1:09:29] home and it was not necessarily going to
[1:09:32] affect them but it was going to have a
[1:09:35] great impact upon their
[1:09:39] children in so much that the Bible says
[1:09:41] they forsook God they they they the
[1:09:44] Bible says that they went went on and
[1:09:46] got the anger of the Lord it was hot
[1:09:49] against them and so you see what happens
[1:09:52] here is that pattern of Judges that
[1:09:54] cycle
[1:09:55] of Revival and death that cycle of good
[1:09:59] and then bad and then good and then bad
[1:10:02] begins to take
[1:10:04] place and the Bible says in verse 14 The
[1:10:08] Anger of the Lord was hot against them
[1:10:10] and he delivered them into the hand of
[1:10:12] spoilers he sold them into the hand of
[1:10:14] their enemies so that they can not
[1:10:16] longer no longer stand before their
[1:10:18] enemies whereever they went the hand of
[1:10:20] the Lord was against them notice verse
[1:10:23] 16 nevertheless the Lord raised up
[1:10:29] judges now these judges are not judicial
[1:10:32] don't think of that word in litiga in
[1:10:35] kind of some kind of judicial way but
[1:10:37] actually this was an actual
[1:10:40] dispensation because Israel is going to
[1:10:42] be ruled by prophets by judges by Kings
[1:10:47] Prophet priest and King but this is the
[1:10:49] period of Judges where God was going to
[1:10:52] raise up men and the Bible actually says
[1:10:55] says that these men are are not judicial
[1:10:58] judges but it's actually the word
[1:11:02] Savior and so these men were going to
[1:11:04] become saviors to the people they were
[1:11:08] going to become lights they were going
[1:11:10] to become a message of hope that we're
[1:11:12] going to be a deliverer because Samson
[1:11:14] is called he shall begin to deliver
[1:11:17] Israel he shall begin to save the people
[1:11:20] out of the hand of their oppressors you
[1:11:22] following me
[1:11:23] today and so God sends them judges and
[1:11:27] the Bible says notice this about these
[1:11:29] judge nevertheless the Lord raised up
[1:11:31] judges I delivered them out of the hand
[1:11:33] of those that spoiled them and yet they
[1:11:35] would not hearken unto their judge they
[1:11:40] went a whing after other gods verse 17
[1:11:42] they turned quickly out of the way which
[1:11:44] their fathers walked in obeying the
[1:11:46] Commandments of the Lord but they did
[1:11:48] not so and when the Lord raised them up
[1:11:51] judges then the Lord was with that judge
[1:11:55] notice the pattern when the Lord raised
[1:11:58] up a judge Lord was with him and they
[1:11:59] delivered them out of the hand of their
[1:12:01] Philistines all the days of the
[1:12:07] judge all the days of the judge and it
[1:12:12] came to pass verse 19 that when the
[1:12:15] judge was
[1:12:18] dead that they returned and corrupted
[1:12:22] themselves more
[1:12:26] it is so amazing to me how many times
[1:12:29] I've watched this pattern in real life
[1:12:33] to where God will take a man you can
[1:12:36] call him a patriarch a pillar of a
[1:12:40] family a pastor maybe a
[1:12:43] mother and that man will have a strong
[1:12:46] testimony a strong conviction might even
[1:12:50] preach the message of the hour and all
[1:12:53] the days while that man is alive the
[1:12:56] grandchildren are good the children look
[1:12:59] good a family looks together they they
[1:13:02] that the Anchor Point it's amazing when
[1:13:04] you study what people are really
[1:13:06] anchored
[1:13:09] to because as long as that man is alive
[1:13:12] as long as he has passion as long as
[1:13:14] he's preaching the message as long as
[1:13:16] he's contending for the truth then the
[1:13:18] family the sons and the daughters and
[1:13:21] the church and and the grandchildren and
[1:13:23] and and the Anchor Point is in their
[1:13:25] life and as long as that man serves the
[1:13:28] Lord they serve God but if they're
[1:13:30] anchored to that man and not Christ the
[1:13:36] word then when that Anchor Point is
[1:13:39] removed out of their
[1:13:41] life it's like a boat floating down the
[1:13:45] tide without an
[1:13:48] anchor and after a while you know it
[1:13:51] seems like it's okay big deal but then
[1:13:54] you sit in that boat I've been in the
[1:13:55] Bufford River long enough and the anchor
[1:13:57] came loose and you didn't realize it at
[1:13:59] first but then slowly they start to
[1:14:02] drift and they start to drift and they
[1:14:05] start to
[1:14:06] drift a little at a time the dress
[1:14:08] changes their manner of dress their
[1:14:10] attitudes their
[1:14:12] behavior and you notice that that Anchor
[1:14:15] Point that pillar that has been removed
[1:14:18] out of their life is now removed and
[1:14:20] then before you know it they Flo and
[1:14:22] they Flo and they but what was what what
[1:14:23] what for years they sat in church for
[1:14:26] for years they they they I said it
[1:14:28] appeared visually on the outside listen
[1:14:31] friends if I could just preach this here
[1:14:33] today let me just get straight to my
[1:14:35] point today it is not enough to be
[1:14:38] anchored to a papa or a far a mother or
[1:14:41] an Earthly testimony or the stories of
[1:14:43] yesterday uh you've got to be anchored
[1:14:45] to Christ you've got to be anchored to
[1:14:48] the word uh let's let our our young
[1:14:51] people and our churches not have the
[1:14:53] experience of of what a pastor has
[1:14:55] that's wonderful but I say God give our
[1:14:58] people the real baptism of the Holy
[1:15:01] Ghost let the anchor be anchored to
[1:15:04] Christ the
[1:15:08] word and I'm not talking about Christ
[1:15:10] just a story of Jesus because that won't
[1:15:13] hold
[1:15:14] you oh I'm just going to go ahead and
[1:15:16] preach here I said not just a story well
[1:15:19] yeah just get them to Jesus and people
[1:15:20] love to quote that and say we're
[1:15:22] preaching the message and the message
[1:15:23] and we need to preach Christ listen I'm
[1:15:25] all for preaching Christ but which
[1:15:26] Christ are you talking
[1:15:28] about I'm not just talking about a story
[1:15:31] of Christ of a good man who was nice and
[1:15:33] kind and humble and listen you learn all
[1:15:35] that in Bible in Bible study in Sunday
[1:15:38] school and you say brother man is there
[1:15:39] anything wrong with that there's not but
[1:15:41] the Bible says that the letter
[1:15:45] kth so it's not enough just to know
[1:15:47] about the message it's not enough just
[1:15:49] to know the let me quote a prophet we
[1:15:52] didn't come together to talk about the
[1:15:54] message we didn't we didn't come
[1:15:55] together just to preach about it we come
[1:15:57] to get under
[1:15:59] it because the message is not doctrines
[1:16:02] and books and tapes and stories it's
[1:16:05] Christ revealed in his own
[1:16:11] word I notice as that judge lived they
[1:16:14] served the Lord but then after that pepo
[1:16:18] died and then suddenly now for a
[1:16:22] while they look good and then eventually
[1:16:27] poof they're
[1:16:29] gone and you think what happened I'm
[1:16:31] going to tell you what happened the
[1:16:33] cycle of Judges they had never came out
[1:16:36] of you see judges was actually patterned
[1:16:40] this way to where that cycle of Revival
[1:16:44] would repeat seven times it's not an
[1:16:48] accident I don't believe for one moment
[1:16:51] that it was actually through seven times
[1:16:54] God would s in this pattern of
[1:16:57] Revival and then
[1:17:00] death he would send them men and and you
[1:17:03] could go to the slides brother if you
[1:17:05] want to he would send them men like the
[1:17:07] king of Jericho would be an oppressor so
[1:17:09] he'd send an oel he'd send a king of
[1:17:11] Moab and so God would send an Ehud it
[1:17:14] send the ammonites and so God would send
[1:17:16] a shamgar it send the amalekites and so
[1:17:19] there was a Deborah and a barck he'd
[1:17:21] send the Philistines Satan would come
[1:17:23] and and attack them so God would send
[1:17:25] them a Gideon this is the second uh
[1:17:27] slide there you can display if you'd
[1:17:29] like thank you that's behind me thank
[1:17:31] you so he would send them a Gideon you
[1:17:33] know the story of Gideon you know the
[1:17:35] story of shamgar you know the story of
[1:17:38] the of Samson what was it that every
[1:17:41] time the enemy come rushing in God would
[1:17:44] raise up a deliverer God would raise up
[1:17:46] a standard every time the dtin friends s
[1:17:49] Satan has never one time been ahead of
[1:17:51] God but God has always been 10 steps
[1:17:54] ahead of of the
[1:17:55] devil and every time Satan would come
[1:17:58] into the church with oh you know brother
[1:18:00] Bron would preach that about the ages
[1:18:01] when he would come with a white horse
[1:18:03] and he would come with a black horse
[1:18:04] he'd come with a a red horse God would
[1:18:06] raise up an anointing that would come
[1:18:09] upon a messenger and that messenger
[1:18:11] would be the the the defender or the the
[1:18:14] anointing that would that would meet the
[1:18:15] challenge of that day but those people
[1:18:18] under that message would come under the
[1:18:20] anointing of the messenger's anointing
[1:18:23] and they would meet the challenge of
[1:18:25] their generation oh in the days of the
[1:18:27] Dark Ages God would raise up an ox he
[1:18:30] would raise up a lion he would raise up
[1:18:32] a a man but let me just say what was
[1:18:35] those those were spirits of defenses and
[1:18:38] and and and that God would send upon men
[1:18:41] and it would defeat the Devil for their
[1:18:43] Generation Well let me tell you you
[1:18:44] don't have the anointing of an ox today
[1:18:47] you don't even have the anointing of a
[1:18:49] of a man of human intellect and you're
[1:18:51] going to outsmart the devil but God sent
[1:18:53] a message when an anointing of a mighty
[1:18:58] eagle and that eagle is your anointing
[1:19:00] today to rise above all of Lady oia to
[1:19:04] rise above all of the that the fear and
[1:19:07] the pressure and the
[1:19:11] anxiety God would send a message and it
[1:19:15] would anoint that people notice this
[1:19:17] here the story of Gideon and the story
[1:19:19] of Samson listen to what brother bham
[1:19:21] says today during the time of Judges the
[1:19:24] first thing there come I think I got
[1:19:26] that right he says when Israel got away
[1:19:28] from God when they did the water supply
[1:19:31] was withheld and when the people notice
[1:19:33] get away from God today the water supply
[1:19:37] is withheld and all the other
[1:19:40] blessings will be withheld the prophet
[1:19:43] says Now history keeps repeating
[1:19:48] itself I want you to notice some of
[1:19:50] these themes here because in judges it
[1:19:53] was going to repeat seven
[1:19:56] times and through those ages can we say
[1:20:00] it was going to be a cycle a cyclic
[1:20:03] circle of repeating and repeating and
[1:20:08] repeating the prophet says history keeps
[1:20:11] repeating
[1:20:13] itself in the generation of Israel we
[1:20:16] see revival can I take this
[1:20:20] off we see Revival in one generation
[1:20:24] only to see the fires fading in the
[1:20:27] next and in the third Embers may be
[1:20:31] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[1:20:35] may be no
[1:20:37] vestage of that or whatsoever of that
[1:20:40] original flame you say then what does
[1:20:43] God do he just lights the fire
[1:20:46] again and then the same process is
[1:20:51] repeated the fervent desire you say
[1:20:53] brother Matt what are some of the the
[1:20:54] things that begin to fade in that cyclic
[1:20:58] pattern the fervent desire to please
[1:21:05] God the
[1:21:07] passion to know his
[1:21:10] word the
[1:21:12] fervency the passion oh we can preach
[1:21:15] all day about ages and I could preach
[1:21:17] about churches and we but how about we
[1:21:19] just preach about oursel here today for
[1:21:20] a
[1:21:22] moment because when you're called in
[1:21:24] that judge's cycle it's a cycle of Good
[1:21:27] Times highlights revivals but mixed in
[1:21:30] with that is
[1:21:33] defeat the fervent desire to please God
[1:21:36] the passion to know his word the
[1:21:39] cry for reaching out in the spirit all
[1:21:43] begins to
[1:21:45] fade and instead of that church being on
[1:21:48] fire with the fire of god notice it has
[1:21:52] cooled off
[1:21:55] and became a bit
[1:21:59] formal this is the pattern of Judges
[1:22:02] it's the cycles of revivals and then
[1:22:05] death of high times good times and then
[1:22:09] it would repeat and he says that is what
[1:22:12] was happening back there to the
[1:22:13] Ephesians that second generation coming
[1:22:16] on was just like Israel they demanded
[1:22:18] the king to be like other nations and
[1:22:19] when they did that they rejected God but
[1:22:22] they did it anyway
[1:22:25] notice what the prophet of God says here
[1:22:28] that is the history that is the circle
[1:22:34] that is the cycle of the
[1:22:38] church and it isn't long until you see
[1:22:40] them stop doing things they wouldn't
[1:22:42] used to
[1:22:44] do you mean it's that simple to decipher
[1:22:47] if my Revival is dying yet it's that
[1:22:50] simple they stop doing things they used
[1:22:54] to do do and they start doing things
[1:22:57] they would not do
[1:23:00] initially isn't it incredible I'm just
[1:23:02] reading you right out of the Ephesian
[1:23:03] Church age they changed their manner of
[1:23:07] dress ah so you mean how we look and how
[1:23:11] we dress says something about where our
[1:23:13] Revival
[1:23:16] is their attitudes and their behavior
[1:23:21] notice they get laxed that's what
[1:23:23] Ephesus means means relaxed and drifting
[1:23:26] and listen what a prophet says that
[1:23:29] second generation notice that cycle of
[1:23:32] Revival and death has never
[1:23:37] failed and notice that pattern in judges
[1:23:40] would actually repeat seven times I want
[1:23:43] you to see this that I Illustrated I
[1:23:45] wrote I just did this quickly because
[1:23:47] this is the cycle of judges in those
[1:23:50] days there was no King and every man did
[1:23:53] that which was right right in his own
[1:23:55] eyes there was compromise there was
[1:23:58] there and notice what it would it would
[1:24:00] lead to always it would start with sin
[1:24:04] and then sin always always always leads
[1:24:08] to
[1:24:11] slavery sin always leads to
[1:24:17] bondage and you know sometimes bondage
[1:24:19] doesn't look like
[1:24:22] bondage I'm not talking about just your
[1:24:24] hand are chained up and tied up
[1:24:25] incarcerated in prison a lot of people
[1:24:27] are in prisons of their own
[1:24:29] mind and Visually outwardly externally
[1:24:32] looks like no bondage at all and a lot
[1:24:35] of people get in bondage in their own
[1:24:36] mind when they can't believe the listen
[1:24:38] you're in a bondage in your own mind the
[1:24:40] devil's got you in prison when you can't
[1:24:42] believe the promises of God are for
[1:24:45] you and the devil will put somebody in
[1:24:48] bondage in their own mind to say that
[1:24:49] God surely God couldn't do that did that
[1:24:51] for them but he couldn't do that for me
[1:24:53] it's bondage
[1:24:55] yes and it would lead from sin to
[1:24:58] slavery and then repentance and then
[1:25:01] Deliverance but guess what it'd go right
[1:25:03] back into sin when that judge would die
[1:25:06] and then that sin would lead to more
[1:25:07] slavery and then it would go to
[1:25:09] repentance and then it would be
[1:25:10] deliverance and then it would go back to
[1:25:12] sin and then it would go to repentance
[1:25:14] and our slavery then it would go to
[1:25:16] repentance then it would go to
[1:25:17] deliverance and this is a lot how
[1:25:19] people's lives who've never really came
[1:25:22] out of judges
[1:25:24] yes and their life is a repeating
[1:25:27] pattern can I preach to you
[1:25:30] today and they go in circles and they go
[1:25:33] in circles and they go in circles and
[1:25:35] life becomes just a circle just a loop I
[1:25:38] know we've we've preached on this before
[1:25:39] but I'm just going to go in and do it
[1:25:41] again people are like that in their
[1:25:42] lives when they get away from God their
[1:25:44] life just becomes a wondering Circle and
[1:25:47] they go around and around and around and
[1:25:49] around the
[1:25:50] roundabout and and they go around you
[1:25:52] know like a roundabout like a traffic
[1:25:53] circle y'all got those around here and
[1:25:56] you know that you know the purpose of
[1:25:58] that
[1:25:59] roundabout is to get
[1:26:05] off it's not to go around and around and
[1:26:08] around and
[1:26:09] around but people go in that roundabout
[1:26:11] of life and they you know they grow up
[1:26:13] and then they get in that cycle to where
[1:26:16] they get a job they go to work they come
[1:26:18] home from work they say hello to the
[1:26:19] family then they veg on entertainment
[1:26:21] then they go to bed then they wake up
[1:26:23] they go to work they work eight hours
[1:26:24] they come home say hello to the family
[1:26:26] then they get on YouTube or whatever
[1:26:28] their Outlet is and then they veg and
[1:26:30] then they go to bed then they wake up
[1:26:32] and then they go to work and then they
[1:26:34] work eight hours then they come home
[1:26:36] then they greet their family they veg on
[1:26:37] entertain then it's Sunday so they go to
[1:26:39] church on Sunday then they go right back
[1:26:41] to the same cycle and then they go to CH
[1:26:43] go to work on Monday work eight hours
[1:26:45] come home greet the family and and then
[1:26:47] veg on entertainment and then then go to
[1:26:49] then it's Wednesday they go to church
[1:26:50] but then they go right back to the cycle
[1:26:52] come on somebody
[1:26:54] I'm preaching right at you right now and
[1:26:57] they go on that cycle and they do that
[1:26:59] for 60 years they retire and they hope
[1:27:01] to step off the roundabout about the
[1:27:03] same place they stepped on well let me
[1:27:05] just preach to you today your life is
[1:27:08] not about the roundabout that might be
[1:27:10] the life of your neighbor that might be
[1:27:12] the life of of other people but your
[1:27:14] life has a
[1:27:17] purpose God has called you he's ordained
[1:27:19] you to something and I say today get off
[1:27:23] of the roundabout
[1:27:24] get off of the
[1:27:28] circle and get on the
[1:27:31] line because you see the line is so
[1:27:34] different than the
[1:27:36] circle the line is so different than the
[1:27:39] linear line is so different than that
[1:27:41] cyclic life of patterns of repeated
[1:27:45] patterns over and over and it was going
[1:27:48] to be a little woman named Ruth who was
[1:27:51] caught up in that judge's cycle
[1:27:54] I want you to notice something so
[1:27:55] powerful about this little woman Ruth
[1:27:58] she came from the Book of
[1:28:01] Judges in fact if you go read the way
[1:28:04] that judges ends and you go look at the
[1:28:07] way that judges ends I I'm not going to
[1:28:09] do it today because it honestly would be
[1:28:11] hard to even preach to you in a mixed
[1:28:15] audience with different ages the way
[1:28:18] your Book of Judges
[1:28:19] ends it's complete
[1:28:22] chaos it's complete
[1:28:25] Carnage and murder and and and and and
[1:28:28] you have body parts of cut up people and
[1:28:30] being sent to other tribes these aren't
[1:28:32] I'm not reading you the story of
[1:28:34] Canaanites and
[1:28:36] heathens this is tribes of
[1:28:39] Jacob in so much that the tribe of Dan
[1:28:43] is is almost completely
[1:28:48] obliterated two tribes and and and and
[1:28:52] and this is how judges ends it in horror
[1:28:55] but do you want to know something so
[1:28:56] powerful about this little woman Ruth
[1:28:58] she was caught up in that same judge's
[1:29:03] cycle but she came out of
[1:29:07] it and just two
[1:29:10] miles two
[1:29:12] miles from where the end of Judges takes
[1:29:15] place as a little town called Bethlehem
[1:29:20] Judea and do you realize that that
[1:29:23] little woman's that little woman Ruth's
[1:29:25] life was going to completely The
[1:29:29] Narrative was going to be completely
[1:29:32] Rewritten in her
[1:29:35] life and that actually originally the
[1:29:38] Book of Judges and the Book of Ruth are
[1:29:41] not two
[1:29:43] books in fact if you go and pick up a
[1:29:45] Tanakh a Hebrew Bible Judges and Ruth
[1:29:48] are actually the same
[1:29:50] book you say brother Matt why is that
[1:29:52] powerful to you because your story
[1:29:55] doesn't end in
[1:29:58] judges in fact Ruth is the answer to the
[1:30:01] judges cycle
[1:30:03] Hallelujah it would actually be just two
[1:30:05] miles away you say what was different
[1:30:07] brother Matt everything was different
[1:30:10] about Ruth and judges though it was only
[1:30:12] separated by such a small distance yet
[1:30:15] the atmosphere was totally different
[1:30:18] because little Ruth was going to step
[1:30:19] into a lineage she was going to get off
[1:30:21] the circle and her life was going to
[1:30:24] enter a line of
[1:30:26] Boaz and it would be through that line
[1:30:29] that Boaz and Ruth's life would be
[1:30:31] connected with Jesus Christ you see with
[1:30:34] Christ it is not a circle of seven
[1:30:36] Church ages that would end in death but
[1:30:39] somebody would break the cycle and the
[1:30:42] pattern of the cycle of Revival and
[1:30:46] death Hallelujah listen friends we ain't
[1:30:49] ending in death we're ending in a
[1:30:51] Rapture of the go God's Church it will
[1:30:54] be a ly to
[1:30:57] Glory it would be that cycle that would
[1:31:00] repeat actually that would start all the
[1:31:03] way back in the days of the Kings now I
[1:31:07] want to show you something incredible in
[1:31:08] your Bible because actually it was going
[1:31:11] to be these cyclic patterns that would
[1:31:14] bring de that would bring destruction to
[1:31:17] the Kings of Israel even in your Bible
[1:31:19] turn to turn if you have it to 2 Kings
[1:31:21] chapter 12 I have it for you but if you
[1:31:23] have your your Bible turn
[1:31:32] there I want you to notice that actually
[1:31:36] it would be Solomon not
[1:31:39] David you see David was going to be the
[1:31:43] father of
[1:31:44] Solomon and then Solomon would have
[1:31:46] children and then their children would
[1:31:48] have children and the generations would
[1:31:50] begin to go and it wasn't going to be
[1:31:53] DAV but it was actually going to be
[1:31:55] Solomon that was going to bring in
[1:31:57] things into the worship in in the divinc
[1:32:00] worship that David never allowed in fact
[1:32:03] David would have never stood
[1:32:05] for but Solomon is going to begin to
[1:32:08] bring something in the people's lives
[1:32:11] from his concubines Heathen
[1:32:14] concubines and you would find in your
[1:32:16] Bible this thing called a high place and
[1:32:20] it was actually we' seen them when we
[1:32:21] were there last August in in in Israel
[1:32:24] and they would build a moat or they
[1:32:25] would build a great uh uh you know on
[1:32:27] top of a mountain and they would Worship
[1:32:30] the Lord on this high place you ever
[1:32:32] read that in your Bible and you C it
[1:32:34] that that that that that you know that
[1:32:35] he built the high place so they
[1:32:37] worshiped on the high place everybody
[1:32:38] ever read that in your scripture that
[1:32:40] actually wasn't from David but it
[1:32:42] actually was from Solomon and Solomon
[1:32:45] would bring in from his concubines he
[1:32:47] would bring in from these Canaanite
[1:32:48] wives the the these Foreigner foreign
[1:32:51] Nations I should say and they would
[1:32:53] bring in this way of worship that was
[1:32:55] mixed with div vinic
[1:32:58] worship and they would he would bring in
[1:33:01] these high places and it would affect
[1:33:03] generation after generation after
[1:33:06] generation now I'm sure that when he
[1:33:09] first brought it in I'm sure that when
[1:33:11] he first showed up to church with it
[1:33:13] people were thinking my
[1:33:15] goodness David would have never allowed
[1:33:18] that David would have certainly never
[1:33:21] stood for that but you know what is
[1:33:24] amazing you can let me say it the way
[1:33:27] that John Wesley stood it said it what
[1:33:29] one generation tolerates the Next
[1:33:32] Generation
[1:33:36] Embraces I said what one generation
[1:33:38] tolerates the Next Generation
[1:33:41] Embraces oh friends if we've ever seen
[1:33:43] that today it's it's if we ever seen a
[1:33:45] pattern of that in our world it's right
[1:33:47] now what what was at first egregious and
[1:33:50] no one could have imagined that we'd be
[1:33:52] confused on what as a boy and what as a
[1:33:54] girl and what bathroom to
[1:33:58] use but what one generation might get
[1:34:01] even might even think to themselves that
[1:34:04] shouldn't be going on but listen friends
[1:34:06] if no one ever takes a stand to cut the
[1:34:08] head off of that
[1:34:11] thing hello
[1:34:13] somebody it's it's okay you say well I
[1:34:16] was I was you know I was indignant but
[1:34:18] did you do something about
[1:34:20] it well I knew it shouldn't have been
[1:34:23] going on but what did you do about it
[1:34:25] because your silence makes you complicit
[1:34:27] with
[1:34:29] it and people could think like a lot who
[1:34:32] Bible the Bible brother bam said the
[1:34:34] sins of Sodom vexed his righteous soul
[1:34:37] but didn't have the backbone to say
[1:34:39] anything of it and to say anything
[1:34:41] against it and a lot of people are
[1:34:43] against it but do they have the backbone
[1:34:45] listen friends if we ever needed to cut
[1:34:48] and make the truth clear and bare
[1:34:50] knuckled clear and not dance around the
[1:34:52] way we say it or the way we quote it we
[1:34:55] listen we don't need to dress this
[1:34:57] gospel up we don't need to modernize
[1:34:59] this gospel we don't need to water it
[1:35:01] down we need to say it like a prophet
[1:35:04] said
[1:35:07] it and after a while you know eventually
[1:35:10] after a while well you know David
[1:35:12] wouldn't allowed it but then another
[1:35:14] time then then you know next Generation
[1:35:16] before you know it it's a staple in
[1:35:19] Hebrew
[1:35:20] worship and those cycles that that would
[1:35:23] affect that the family generationally
[1:35:26] would just repeat and repeat and repeat
[1:35:29] let's pick it up here in 2 Kings chapter
[1:35:31] 12 in the seventh year now the writer of
[1:35:34] Kings is going to always say something
[1:35:37] he's going to tell you the mother's name
[1:35:39] he's going to tell you how old he was
[1:35:42] he's going to tell you how many years he
[1:35:44] served and then he's going to tell you
[1:35:46] something most important he's going to
[1:35:48] say one of two things this King did that
[1:35:51] which was right in the sight of the Lord
[1:35:55] or it's going to say this King did that
[1:35:57] which was evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:36:01] in the seventh year of juu jehoash begin
[1:36:03] to Reign 40 years reigned he in
[1:36:05] Jerusalem and his mother's name was zebi
[1:36:07] BBA and joash did that which was right
[1:36:12] somebody say praise the Lord praise the
[1:36:15] Lord I want you to say that every time
[1:36:17] we read
[1:36:18] that let me read it again and joash did
[1:36:21] that which was right praise the Lord in
[1:36:25] the sight of the Lord all notice all his
[1:36:30] days wherein jhoda the priest instructed
[1:36:36] him you see the
[1:36:38] limitation as long as his priest as long
[1:36:41] as his Pastor come on somebody as long
[1:36:43] as that vessel that that that pillar was
[1:36:46] in his life he did that which was
[1:36:49] right all his days when jeod the priest
[1:36:52] instructed him verse three but big
[1:36:55] notice this here
[1:36:57] but
[1:36:58] but he did that which was right praise
[1:37:01] the
[1:37:01] Lord but the high places were not taken
[1:37:06] away he did burn he he says the people
[1:37:09] still sacrificed and burn incense in the
[1:37:12] high
[1:37:13] places so the pattern continues go a
[1:37:16] little bit further to Second Kings
[1:37:17] chapter 14 notice in verse one of 2
[1:37:20] Kings 14 in the second year of joash son
[1:37:22] of jeho King of of Israel reigned amiah
[1:37:25] the son of joash King of Judah he was 25
[1:37:28] he began to Reign he reigned 29 years
[1:37:31] his mother's name was jeod of Jerusalem
[1:37:34] and he did that which was right the
[1:37:39] Lord praise the Lord he did that which
[1:37:43] was right
[1:37:45] notice the
[1:37:47] stipulation yet not like David his
[1:37:52] father
[1:37:54] his
[1:37:56] father wait a minute brother Tim did we
[1:37:58] just read that right his father his
[1:38:00] father was not
[1:38:02] David oh it's Father's Day ain't
[1:38:05] it notice the Bible is going to connect
[1:38:11] David his father and disconnect him from
[1:38:16] his Earthly
[1:38:18] father notice not like David his father
[1:38:22] he did according to all things as joash
[1:38:28] his
[1:38:29] father did you mean brother Aaron you
[1:38:31] can have two daddies two fathers well
[1:38:34] one day brother brandham says I realized
[1:38:36] I'm not the son of Charles and Ella
[1:38:40] brandham I might have had one father on
[1:38:42] Earth and that's a good thing and thank
[1:38:43] God for a Godly father but you've got to
[1:38:45] come out of that You' got to come out of
[1:38:47] that cycle of that Earthly father and be
[1:38:50] connected with your heavenly father
[1:38:53] notice here he did according to all
[1:38:55] things as joash his father did how be
[1:38:59] it for some reason the high places were
[1:39:04] not taken away as yet the people did
[1:39:08] sacrifice and burn incense on the high
[1:39:11] places ah let's go on further 2 Kings
[1:39:15] chapter 15 and the 27th year of jeroboam
[1:39:18] king of Israel began Azariah the son of
[1:39:21] amaziah King of Judah 16 years old he
[1:39:24] reigned this many years here's his mom's
[1:39:26] name verse three and he did that which
[1:39:29] was
[1:39:30] right Lord oh that was weak come on now
[1:39:33] praise the
[1:39:34] Lord he did that which was right praise
[1:39:38] the
[1:39:40] Lord
[1:39:41] according to all that his father
[1:39:46] amiah had
[1:39:48] done in other words as far as his father
[1:39:53] could go he could
[1:39:56] go but yet there was a governor placed
[1:39:59] upon his life to where as far as that
[1:40:03] father could go he could go but wherever
[1:40:05] the father couldn't go it seemed like it
[1:40:08] stopped his life and stuned his
[1:40:11] growth he did that which was right
[1:40:14] according to all that his father amziah
[1:40:17] had done and notice the very next thing
[1:40:19] it says save that the high places
[1:40:23] were not
[1:40:26] removed the people sacrificed and burned
[1:40:28] incense still owned the high places uh
[1:40:32] second king look at verse 32 of chapter
[1:40:34] 15 second year of Pica son of remaliah
[1:40:37] king of Israel began jothan the son of
[1:40:38] Uzziah king of Judah to rign 25 years
[1:40:41] old was he is his mom's name verse 34
[1:40:43] and he did that which was right praise
[1:40:45] the Lord he did according to all that
[1:40:50] his father Uzziah had done
[1:40:54] how be it the high places were not
[1:40:58] removed isn't it
[1:41:01] incredible cycle after cycle after cycle
[1:41:04] after cycle of Revival but death good
[1:41:08] but mixed him with bad some victory but
[1:41:11] mixed him with a lot of
[1:41:13] defeat and as long as he could serve in
[1:41:16] the ways of his father he could go as
[1:41:18] far as his daddy went he could go as far
[1:41:21] as his family went but whatever kind of
[1:41:23] idioc secretes and little things that
[1:41:26] were bred into him naturally those
[1:41:28] things always bothered him in his life
[1:41:31] and it seemed like if a daddy was a
[1:41:33] cheater he would have a a tendency to
[1:41:35] cheat if his daddy had a problem with
[1:41:36] lying he'd have a tendency to lie it
[1:41:39] might have been a good man might have
[1:41:40] been a might have been a great man but
[1:41:41] always struggled with a little bit of
[1:41:43] dishonesty he was always limited by his
[1:41:48] father if his father was a was a was an
[1:41:50] abuser he might would be an abuser too
[1:41:55] I'm going to preach whether you get
[1:41:56] quiet or not I'm going to keep on
[1:41:59] preaching if his daddy if you know if
[1:42:01] his daddy had a temper he probably would
[1:42:03] have the same traits and tendencies in
[1:42:05] his
[1:42:07] life if his mama was a gossiper well
[1:42:10] then she would probably have the same
[1:42:12] trouble and battle the same struggle if
[1:42:14] the mama took her dress and you know it
[1:42:16] always was borderline and dressed on the
[1:42:18] edge of you know standards and you know
[1:42:20] was always really just the the the you
[1:42:22] know just living on the edge of
[1:42:25] modesty then those girls would battle
[1:42:27] the same exact
[1:42:29] thing if the father let me go further
[1:42:32] let me just say this to you if the
[1:42:34] father never really entered into true
[1:42:36] worship in spirit and freedom of the
[1:42:39] Holy
[1:42:41] Ghost then the children were always
[1:42:44] restricted by that same
[1:42:47] thing you can never lead a person to a
[1:42:51] place you've never been yourself
[1:42:55] and thinking about it and Desiring it
[1:42:57] and oh I wish my children would get free
[1:42:59] in the Holy Ghost well have you got free
[1:43:00] in the Holy
[1:43:02] Ghost all right
[1:43:05] now if the daddy was critical then most
[1:43:07] likely the kids would just ingest all of
[1:43:09] that criticism and then they would grow
[1:43:11] up to be little Min versions of their
[1:43:13] dad don't you realize this is the
[1:43:16] pattern of
[1:43:18] Judges so long as the judge lived they
[1:43:21] lived good but when the judge died
[1:43:23] wherever the Daddy went wherever the
[1:43:25] family went whatever the standard was it
[1:43:27] was the standard they withheld and they
[1:43:30] were always struggling and restricted by
[1:43:33] the cycle that he passed down for
[1:43:36] instance a few days ago I was caught in
[1:43:37] on a scene a little something going on
[1:43:39] there was a fine young man very fine boy
[1:43:42] listen to what brother brandham says
[1:43:43] here I'm going to skip this to make sure
[1:43:44] you get it fine young man very he was
[1:43:46] going with a little girl very fine
[1:43:48] little girl fine family little boy all
[1:43:49] of a sudden came up with some kind of an
[1:43:51] idea he just walked away he did
[1:43:53] something wrong to that little girl as
[1:43:54] much as promised her to do a certain
[1:43:56] thing they didn't do it instead of
[1:43:57] coming to the girl and apologizing like
[1:43:58] a gentleman should do notice it just
[1:44:02] wasn't in
[1:44:03] him he couldn't say I'm sorry it just
[1:44:07] wasn't in him to do it he a good boy has
[1:44:11] a good family has a good dad has a good
[1:44:14] mom but now he's struggling with this
[1:44:17] pattern notice what brother M says the
[1:44:19] father and mother called me to the scene
[1:44:20] and said we would desire to know what's
[1:44:22] wrong with our boy it's not easy to do
[1:44:24] so sometimes you're right brother bham
[1:44:26] it's not easy to do so but you must be
[1:44:29] truthful and
[1:44:32] honest right brother bam says he says
[1:44:35] therefore the boy notice how he divides
[1:44:38] this the boy was a Christian somebody
[1:44:41] say praise the
[1:44:42] Lord as far as a
[1:44:45] Believer he had
[1:44:47] repented Lord he was
[1:44:50] baptized come on Church
[1:44:54] he was a Christian he's a good boy he
[1:44:55] was repented he had baptized and had his
[1:44:58] position among
[1:45:00] Believers but yet had not received the
[1:45:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost no matter how
[1:45:08] much he thought he
[1:45:11] had you thinking you have and having it
[1:45:15] is two different
[1:45:18] things you might be able to try to say
[1:45:20] you have and you might be able to show
[1:45:22] some evidence some emotion but unless
[1:45:25] your
[1:45:27] life you mean it's not in some emotion
[1:45:30] no it's not it's good to have it but
[1:45:32] it's not in
[1:45:34] it brother Brandon what's the evidence
[1:45:36] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost love
[1:45:38] would have to be loveed brother brandom
[1:45:39] said it sounded
[1:45:42] good sounded good love and he said but
[1:45:45] the Holy Spirit showed me it's not love
[1:45:48] Christian Science has more fruits of the
[1:45:49] spirit than anybody and they deny the
[1:45:51] deity of Jesus Christ yeah then it must
[1:45:54] be some gift to speak in tongues or
[1:45:55] shout or fill it down or shout it down
[1:45:57] brother brand says I've seen the the the
[1:45:59] you know the witch doctors do that he
[1:46:02] says no matter how much you say then
[1:46:04] what is it brother Matt well let's let a
[1:46:06] prophet say it unless your life is
[1:46:09] vindicating what you're professing
[1:46:12] that's right you still hav't got no
[1:46:14] matter emotions no matter how much you
[1:46:16] jump run Sensations speak in tongues uh
[1:46:19] uh or shouting or whatever you might lay
[1:46:22] upon it and listen what brother random
[1:46:23] says which is all right I believe in all
[1:46:26] of that
[1:46:28] too but unless your life
[1:46:32] copes with your
[1:46:35] testimony that's why I said Wednesday
[1:46:37] night more than anything else your life
[1:46:40] needs to match the life of your
[1:46:44] lamb and with that lamb comes Joy it
[1:46:47] comes power it comes forgiveness it
[1:46:50] comes love somebody help me preach it
[1:46:52] comes it comes gentleness and meekness
[1:46:54] and Temperance and patience and with all
[1:46:58] of those fruits comes the power of the
[1:47:00] spirits of God it's all of it you say
[1:47:02] brother M which is it it's all of it we
[1:47:05] don't just need some of it we need all
[1:47:07] of it oh do just evening light believe
[1:47:10] today God don't just give me a fruit
[1:47:13] don't just give me a gift don't give me
[1:47:15] everything God that you have for me Lord
[1:47:19] I want all of it
[1:47:23] yeah unless your life copes you still
[1:47:25] haven't got it because the fruit of the
[1:47:27] spirit vindicates what you are just like
[1:47:29] fruit of any tree Jesus said by their
[1:47:31] fruits notice this young fellow's
[1:47:32] parents his mother is German I hope
[1:47:35] you're not German today out
[1:47:37] here but there's a strain in that
[1:47:40] family that is they'll just
[1:47:45] sit like a lot of people do when you're
[1:47:47] preaching to them
[1:47:53] they'll just sit you can talk to
[1:47:55] them they'll just stare you right in the
[1:47:58] face uhhuh they sure will
[1:48:02] sometimes God finally had to tell
[1:48:04] Jeremiah don't look at their
[1:48:06] faces you get discouraged
[1:48:09] sometimes sometimes y'all don't realize
[1:48:11] how much your faces have an effect on a
[1:48:14] preacher amen
[1:48:18] preachers he says they'll just stare at
[1:48:20] you right in the face they got this girl
[1:48:23] sister the mother of this boy is brother
[1:48:25] bandam says the mother of this boy or
[1:48:27] sister I've come down the street many a
[1:48:28] morning this young lady be sitting right
[1:48:29] out there and say good morning to you
[1:48:32] she'd just look at me I stop i' say sure
[1:48:35] a fine morning she'd just stand and look
[1:48:38] right at you an intelligent woman I'd
[1:48:41] say come up and see us some sometimes
[1:48:43] she'd just stand and
[1:48:45] look well the brothers are that way her
[1:48:47] father and mother's that way now the
[1:48:49] father of this boy is strictly an
[1:48:50] Irishman he he's high tempered strung
[1:48:53] that's his whole family's like that
[1:48:56] except one or the other out of the
[1:48:58] family converted now in this boy I love
[1:49:00] that statement right there now in this
[1:49:02] boy so now we know the mom now we know
[1:49:05] the dad that'll tell you a lot about the
[1:49:09] boy now in this boy father mother both
[1:49:13] of them Christians filled with the Holy
[1:49:14] Ghost and they have brought this young
[1:49:16] man theyve brought this young man up in
[1:49:18] the way of the Lord and now the young
[1:49:21] man is about 17 18 something something
[1:49:22] along there very fine kid he's been a
[1:49:24] real mod bu at home nice kid he's got a
[1:49:26] brother that's just vice versa the girl
[1:49:28] of the mother mother's family lives
[1:49:29] close to the Fine church and he says you
[1:49:31] know would they ever come over there no
[1:49:33] they they know it's right it's just not
[1:49:34] in them to do it to ask forgiveness or
[1:49:37] ask
[1:49:39] pardoning can you believe actually
[1:49:41] that's hard for some
[1:49:45] people it's hard for some people to say
[1:49:48] I'm
[1:49:50] sorry but do you know the
[1:49:53] power of asking for
[1:49:57] forgiveness I tell you what it can do
[1:50:00] sometimes it can break a curse that's
[1:50:01] been on a family for 30
[1:50:05] years and I've watched it
[1:50:09] happen and he said they just don't have
[1:50:12] it in them they just won't do it it's
[1:50:17] just not in them now the genes and this
[1:50:20] father and the mother of this boy no
[1:50:22] matter how much they're converted in
[1:50:23] other words no matter how much the dad
[1:50:25] and mom are converted no matter how much
[1:50:27] they're converted Still Remains In the
[1:50:29] Flesh that's been in breed out to this
[1:50:31] boy therefore the boy has got a complex
[1:50:33] in him just like from his mother's
[1:50:35] family they are not forgiving they will
[1:50:38] not apologize that's where the boy
[1:50:44] stands now I said to the father no
[1:50:46] matter how much you've raised him up
[1:50:48] look at your family out of all of them
[1:50:50] drunks and fighting and shooting and
[1:50:52] cutting his brother Brandon's family
[1:50:53] speaking of cutting and family and so he
[1:50:55] says and so forth and he says now look
[1:50:58] at your family to the mother there are a
[1:51:00] bunch of people that sit there won't
[1:51:02] speak very
[1:51:05] independent very
[1:51:08] independent I said very
[1:51:11] independent I know y'all ain't got him
[1:51:13] in Louisiana but we got him in South
[1:51:15] Carolina so you forgive me while in case
[1:51:18] they stream I'll preach against them
[1:51:19] here just for a moment y'all just sit
[1:51:20] there and listen
[1:51:23] very
[1:51:25] independent you say oh well you know
[1:51:28] high high tempered and you know High
[1:51:30] Strung and unforgiving you know but they
[1:51:32] got the Holy Ghost and so that's that's
[1:51:34] just how I
[1:51:36] am you know that's just me and you know
[1:51:39] you know that's just you know it's just
[1:51:41] way my daddy was that's just the way I
[1:51:43] that's just the way I am you know it
[1:51:45] just it's just and it's amazing how many
[1:51:47] excuses we make for these little things
[1:51:49] in our own
[1:51:51] flesh and yet profess that we've got the
[1:51:54] life of the Lamb I believe you got it in
[1:51:55] your soul but you need to let it that
[1:51:57] that Soul take control of your spirit
[1:51:59] and your flesh and your mind and your
[1:52:01] temper and your personality listen
[1:52:04] friends God ain't going to stop shining
[1:52:05] that light on any part of your life he
[1:52:07] got in your soul but now he wants to
[1:52:09] change you one day he's going to change
[1:52:11] your body and the fact that he'll change
[1:52:13] your body is the fact that he can change
[1:52:15] every part of
[1:52:17] me I'm not from South Carolina you're
[1:52:20] not even from Louisiana in fact you're
[1:52:22] not an American you're not a German my
[1:52:25] Bible says whoever is in Christ is a new
[1:52:29] creature Hallelujah all things are

[1:52:34] away I don't care what was in your
[1:52:37] family or your daddy or your mama don't
[1:52:39] you say that's just me and that's just
[1:52:41] how I am God wants to change that part
[1:52:44] of

[1:54:07] Christ inside of you oh I said now the
[1:54:11] same thing must happen listen friends I
[1:54:13] am not brother ROM said one day I was
[1:54:15] there as a little boy and he said I
[1:54:17] watch my mama and my daddy I'll party
[1:54:19] animals and I go home all night and
[1:54:21] party all night he said sometimes I'd
[1:54:23] lay there as a little boy and he says
[1:54:25] I'd lay on the top of the shed waiting
[1:54:27] for the music to die down waiting for
[1:54:29] the party to end he said I'd sit there
[1:54:31] with my hunting dog and he said and I'd
[1:54:33] weep and listen this is the kind of life
[1:54:35] our Prophet was
[1:54:37] in and he should have been a drunk just
[1:54:39] like him he should have been a party
[1:54:41] animal just like him he should have been
[1:54:42] an alcoholic just like him but what made
[1:54:45] the
[1:54:47] difference brother bam says I sat there
[1:54:50] in the woods and he says and I sat there
[1:54:52] with my HG and I cried and I cried and
[1:54:56] he said and he said one day he said I'd
[1:54:58] sit there through the winter and he said
[1:55:00] and the the you know the snow would be 2
[1:55:02] feet deep and he said and one day I I
[1:55:04] was sitting there on that river bank and
[1:55:06] he said and it was summer I was fishing
[1:55:09] and he said I had my dog there and he
[1:55:10] said and I looked down and I thought my
[1:55:12] goodness you know it's amazing this same
[1:55:14] ground that is now like this was covered
[1:55:17] with snow one day and brother B says
[1:55:19] then I looked under and there was a
[1:55:20] little flower that popped up
[1:55:23] and brother Brandon says and I thought
[1:55:25] where'd you come from in other words
[1:55:28] how'd you get
[1:55:32] here prophet of God says there was snow
[1:55:35] over top of you but somehow that didn't
[1:55:38] stop
[1:55:40] you and I built a fire over top of you
[1:55:44] and you shouldn't have been here but
[1:55:47] somehow you're here yes sir oh and the
[1:55:50] devil put everything in the path of your
[1:55:52] life he might you might not have had the
[1:55:54] right daddy or the right Mama or the
[1:55:56] right family and Satan thought he' just
[1:55:58] knocked you out you shouldn't be here
[1:56:03] today brother bam says I thought Little
[1:56:05] Flower where'd you come from and he said
[1:56:08] I Heard a Voice speak to me and say you
[1:56:11] are not the son of Charles and Ella
[1:56:14] brandham
[1:56:16] Hallelujah but you're from above you've
[1:56:19] got another father and another kingdom
[1:56:21] and another mother
[1:56:23] oh friends it don't matter what the
[1:56:25] devil threw at you I say I am still here
[1:56:28] I am here by the
[1:56:31] grace
[1:56:33] Hallelujah I am here by the grace you
[1:56:37] shouldn't be in a church today pulling
[1:56:39] on the word of
[1:56:41] God but God took you out of judges and
[1:56:45] he put you in
[1:56:50] rof Hallelujah
[1:56:52] [Applause]
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:55] Ruth didn't deserve to be
[1:56:57] there she should have died with the rest
[1:56:59] of the Book of Judges but God said
[1:57:02] you're not going to end in judges you're
[1:57:04] not going to end in a cycle of Revival
[1:57:06] and death but I'm going to connect you
[1:57:09] with
[1:57:11] Boaz and in Boaz it doesn't matter what
[1:57:14] your daddy
[1:57:18] did now I'm thankful for a good father
[1:57:23] but I'm so glad I met my heavenly
[1:57:29] father I'm so glad I met my heavenly
[1:57:37] father do you know what's so powerful
[1:57:40] and I don't don't have time to preach
[1:57:41] really can I just have just a few more
[1:57:47] minutes so powerful when you think of
[1:57:51] this father
[1:57:53] connection because it's going to
[1:57:56] represent the the it's going to
[1:57:58] represent a generation and a new
[1:58:01] generation a generation preceding and a
[1:58:05] generation arising and even David would
[1:58:08] say to pass the faith on down generation
[1:58:10] to generation we will not hide Psalms 38
[1:58:13] these things from our children but we'll
[1:58:15] tell them another generation and another
[1:58:17] generation that they might know the
[1:58:19] works of God that they might set their
[1:58:22] hopes in the god of their
[1:58:24] fathers and it's amazing because this
[1:58:26] father knows he doesn't want to pass
[1:58:29] down the wrong things brother Aon he
[1:58:32] knows as we just read in judges that
[1:58:34] it's up to him to break the
[1:58:38] cycle that it's up to him to not just
[1:58:41] live from the defeat of
[1:58:43] yesterday but that that God is going to
[1:58:46] do something new for him and that he
[1:58:48] cannot just walk in the ways of yo I
[1:58:51] didn't even say it let me just thank you
[1:58:53] Lord for reminding me do you realize you
[1:58:55] go just right after this you go right
[1:58:58] after this and what you'll find is a
[1:58:59] king named
[1:59:00] Hezekiah he was no different than the
[1:59:02] rest of the Kings you say brother Matt
[1:59:05] what was different about this man he had
[1:59:07] a daddy he had a mother he reigned this
[1:59:09] many years here's his mom's name he did
[1:59:12] that which was right but notice the
[1:59:14] difference in Hezekiah according to all
[1:59:18] his father David
[1:59:23] yeah oh Hallelujah you say brother Matt
[1:59:26] what was the difference he removed the
[1:59:29] high
[1:59:31] places what was it it wasn't going to
[1:59:34] connect him with his Earthly father but
[1:59:36] he was going to walk in the ways of
[1:59:39] David his
[1:59:41] father you say brother Matt what was it
[1:59:44] going to represent what was it going to
[1:59:46] say what was it going to be
[1:59:48] representative of I'm going to tell you
[1:59:49] what it was going to represent it was
[1:59:51] going to repres present that it doesn't
[1:59:53] matter what your past was it doesn't
[1:59:55] Define your
[1:59:58] future it doesn't matter what your
[2:00:00] ancestors were it doesn't matter what
[2:00:03] what the family before you did God can
[2:00:05] take you and break generational curses
[2:00:08] and shatter the power of the devil in
[2:00:10] your
[2:00:13] life but very much like a father can
[2:00:15] pass the wrong things the father can
[2:00:18] also pass the right
[2:00:20] things and a good father father and a
[2:00:23] father who passes down the right things
[2:00:26] as David said tell them to your children
[2:00:29] oh I think of that story we read of that
[2:00:32] that prophecy in
[2:00:33] Joel that you're that I'll pour out my
[2:00:37] spirit upon All
[2:00:39] Flesh your sons and your daughters shall
[2:00:42] prophesy your old men will dream dreams
[2:00:46] your young men will see Visions in other
[2:00:50] words God wasn't going to leave any of
[2:00:52] them out in fact God was going to say by
[2:00:56] Joel that it doesn't matter if you're a
[2:00:58] child it doesn't matter if you're a
[2:01:00] teenager it doesn't matter if you're 20
[2:01:03] if you're 30 if you're 40 if you're 70
[2:01:05] if you're a come on somebody he said old
[2:01:08] men and young
[2:01:10] men in other words God has a purpose in
[2:01:13] every season of your
[2:01:16] life God has a special purpose God has
[2:01:20] things that he can do for you as a young
[2:01:22] man that he may not be able to do so you
[2:01:24] better take your
[2:01:26] opportunity while you're
[2:01:29] young and let me say to the I won't call
[2:01:32] you
[2:01:33] old but the Bible called the old men the
[2:01:36] old
[2:01:37] men you say brother mat is this going to
[2:01:39] be the young uh-uh because the Bible
[2:01:42] says the old men dream
[2:01:44] dreams and the young men seen
[2:01:47] Visions I notice this generation even
[2:01:49] when Elijah dies and Elisha saying my
[2:01:53] father my father he calling him his
[2:01:55] father the Chariots of Israel and the
[2:01:57] horsemen
[2:01:58] thereof and notice this passing down of
[2:02:01] this mantle and a double portion what
[2:02:03] was it it was the right father passing
[2:02:06] down the right things and not the wrong
[2:02:09] things and then Elisha comes to the end
[2:02:12] of his life tell something so powerful
[2:02:15] Elisha comes down to the very end and
[2:02:18] the Bible says he's going to repeat the
[2:02:20] same words
[2:02:23] the same words not Elisha but juu is
[2:02:27] going to say the same exact thing what
[2:02:28] do you have represented here in Elijah
[2:02:30] I'm sorry Elisha can we read it can we
[2:02:32] just take just a moment to read it turn
[2:02:34] to Second
[2:02:36] Kings chapter 13 turn there quickly if
[2:02:39] you
[2:02:41] could thank
[2:02:43] you my plane ain't till 7 o'clock so
[2:02:47] that's that's either good or bad for you
[2:02:49] I'm not sure I'll let you decide
[2:03:00] now notice this here because he's going
[2:03:02] to pass down the right things not the
[2:03:04] wrong
[2:03:06] things and I want you to notice the
[2:03:08] power of this connection between the old
[2:03:12] and the young between the old men and
[2:03:15] the young men because both are important
[2:03:20] in fact one can't live without the
[2:03:25] other it wasn't just an old generation
[2:03:28] or a new generation but actually God
[2:03:30] viewed them as one
[2:03:34] weapon and I'm just filling the Holy
[2:03:36] Spirit right now
[2:03:37] so I believe the Lord wants to say
[2:03:41] something it was actually going to be
[2:03:43] both the connection of the old and the
[2:03:46] young and God says here's Elisha and
[2:03:50] Elisha's Fallen sick he's got at the end
[2:03:52] of his life he's going on but God is
[2:03:55] going to actually take this example and
[2:03:57] notice it says Elisha was Fallen sick of
[2:03:59] his sickness come here brother Tim come
[2:04:01] here I got to use you just for a moment
[2:04:03] come here come here buddy I want to use
[2:04:04] you come here can I use these two give
[2:04:06] these give these guys a hand as they
[2:04:10] come I want to illustrate something come
[2:04:12] up here on the stage with me now brother
[2:04:14] Tim I want you to stand here and face
[2:04:16] the audience and brother you stand here
[2:04:17] and face the audience I want you to
[2:04:19] notice because I'm not call calling you
[2:04:22] old brother Tim but I'm about to use you
[2:04:23] as
[2:04:26] Elisha now the Bible says here in verse
[2:04:29] 14 Elisha was Fallen sick of his
[2:04:34] sickness come on brother Tim Fallen sick
[2:04:37] of his
[2:04:40] sickness now don't die yet not that sick
[2:04:51] notice Elisha was Fallen sick and and
[2:04:54] joash the king of Israel came down unto
[2:04:57] him and wept over his face said oh my
[2:04:58] father let's read it together oh my
[2:05:00] father my father The Chariot of Israel
[2:05:02] notice this connection between this
[2:05:04] father my father my father The Chariot
[2:05:08] and the horsemen thereof and Elisha said
[2:05:11] unto him take bow and arrow so brother
[2:05:13] take bow and arrow don't draw it yet but
[2:05:15] just hold your bow like this like you
[2:05:17] got a bow now now I want you to notice
[2:05:19] what he says he says take bow and arrow
[2:05:22] and so he takes a bow and arrow and he
[2:05:24] took unto him a bow and arrow and he
[2:05:26] said to the king of Israel put thy hand
[2:05:28] upon the bow and he put his hand upon it
[2:05:31] and Elisha stand behind him brother Tim
[2:05:33] Elisha this is actually the example that
[2:05:36] he gives that he tells him to put your
[2:05:38] hand in other words there's a connection
[2:05:40] between the old and the young come on
[2:05:42] somebody help me preach here today
[2:05:44] there's not a disconnection there's a
[2:05:46] connection between the two and God says
[2:05:49] I want you to put your hand upon his
[2:05:51] hand and Elisha put his hand upon his
[2:05:54] hand and what's it representative of
[2:05:56] here what's it representing is that God
[2:05:58] says this is the arrow of God's
[2:06:03] Deliverance what was it going to be your
[2:06:05] old men shall dream dreams and your
[2:06:07] young men shall see Visions you say what
[2:06:10] do you have represented here you have
[2:06:12] the wisdom of the old generation you
[2:06:15] have veterans that have stood for the
[2:06:17] message of the hour you have testimonies
[2:06:20] of time Ed
[2:06:24] memorials and you've got the Zeal and
[2:06:26] the passion and the fervor and the
[2:06:29] energy of a new generation and God says
[2:06:32] this is the arrow of God's Deliverance
[2:06:36] oh I say it's time for our old men to
[2:06:39] dream
[2:06:43] dreams and our young men to see the
[2:06:48] vision thank you Brothers give them a
[2:06:50] hand this morning
[2:06:55] let me say we need the faith of the
[2:06:57] generation the old generation we need
[2:06:59] the faith and the energy of the new God
[2:07:02] says this is the arrow of my
[2:07:08] deliverance and Elisha knows as he puts
[2:07:11] his
[2:07:12] hand upon the hand of ju Elisha
[2:07:18] knows I don't want to pass down all I
[2:07:22] thank this and I thank any
[2:07:24] father how many dads we got here today
[2:07:27] on Father's
[2:07:30] Day Elisha says I don't want to pass
[2:07:34] down the wrong
[2:07:38] thing I think of God's Prophet as we
[2:07:41] read in standing in the Gap and he
[2:07:44] realizes it's going to be his
[2:07:47] testimony and his
[2:07:49] resolve oh he could have just went off
[2:07:51] and took that
[2:07:54] detour he had a right
[2:07:57] to listen sometimes people hurt you and
[2:08:00] you you say if anybody ever had a right
[2:08:03] I think it was God's prophit just to go
[2:08:04] be a
[2:08:05] mountaineer come on if anybody had a
[2:08:09] right a human right just to say I didn't
[2:08:10] do anything wrong and people are closing
[2:08:13] the doors but he knew if he did that
[2:08:16] what would that do to the Next
[2:08:20] Generation and he knew as a father I
[2:08:23] don't want to pass down the wrong thing
[2:08:26] I don't want to pass down my
[2:08:28] complexes I don't want to pass down my
[2:08:30] anger if I've got any temper I don't
[2:08:33] want to pass down any idial secrecies
[2:08:35] anything I want to pass down the right
[2:08:38] thing how many dads how many mothers how
[2:08:41] many fathers raise their hand today and
[2:08:44] say God don't let me transfer the wrong
[2:08:47] thing upon my family
[2:08:51] I want to transfer faith brother Aaron
[2:08:54] oh I want to transfer Hope Oh does
[2:08:57] anybody feel that way today I want to
[2:09:00] transfer Revival to the Next Generation
[2:09:03] I want to transfer the god of the
[2:09:06] supernatural to my children so that they
[2:09:09] would believe in a god of the
[2:09:11] supernatural oh could you stand to your
[2:09:14] feet and say God let me transfer down
[2:09:17] the right thing to my children
[2:09:22] let me pass
[2:09:23] down not
[2:09:27] fear not
[2:09:30] fear but
[2:09:33] Faith oh you just want to raise a hand
[2:09:35] to the Lord now and say God that's my
[2:09:41] desire that's my desire Lord that I
[2:09:45] transfer the right things
[2:09:48] down that i' break the cycle of
[2:09:52] judges and I bring my family into
[2:09:55] Ruth where there's no more fighting
[2:09:58] there's no more
[2:09:59] war there's just rest under
[2:10:05] boas there's
[2:10:07] peace oh brother Matt you don't know
[2:10:09] what my life is you don't know where
[2:10:10] I've been you don't know what my home
[2:10:12] looks like oh but can I just tell you
[2:10:14] today with your head bows and bowed in
[2:10:16] that hand raised can I just encourage
[2:10:19] you
[2:10:21] that a different
[2:10:23] atmosphere is just right down the
[2:10:26] road it's not a Million Miles
[2:10:30] Away judges doesn't have to end you
[2:10:32] don't have to end your life there but
[2:10:35] you can break that cycle in your
[2:10:40] life you don't have to end with the
[2:10:42] chaos and another generation go down and
[2:10:46] pass down the same traits and pass down
[2:10:49] the same things and pass sound the same
[2:10:52] as brother brandham said just little
[2:10:53] things that their family was inner bread
[2:10:56] and bread and inner
[2:10:58] bread but
[2:11:00] God can come and rewrite your whole
[2:11:06] life you say brother Matt what power do
[2:11:08] I
[2:11:09] have over the tendencies that I was born
[2:11:13] with I'm going to tell you what power
[2:11:14] you have you have the power of choice to
[2:11:17] lay it down and say I stomp my pride
[2:11:21] under my feet in the name of Jesus I
[2:11:25] stomp it under my
[2:11:27] feet you say what power do I have
[2:11:30] brother
[2:11:31] Matt to live past and go
[2:11:34] beyond to break free from the chains of
[2:11:37] generational curses
[2:11:41] curses God can forge a new Legacy this
[2:11:47] morning and what could have ended in
[2:11:49] death can end in life
[2:11:52] life it can end in it can end in
[2:11:56] Hope Ruth's
[2:11:58] Legacy her past wasn't going to dictate
[2:12:01] her
[2:12:02] future but God was going to rewrite The
[2:12:05] Narrative of her life and break the
[2:12:08] shackles of generational
[2:12:11] curses and God says Ruth I got your new
[2:12:13] purpose I got your new
[2:12:16] identity oh and it's not going to be one
[2:12:18] that ends in defeat and failure and it's
[2:12:21] not going to be one that ends in
[2:12:22] lukewarmness and coldness and
[2:12:24] indifference it's going to be one that
[2:12:27] ends with you having a
[2:12:29] son
[2:12:31] oh and that son will be OED and he'll
[2:12:35] have a son named Jesse and Jesse will
[2:12:38] have a son what was it it was a lineage
[2:12:40] of Faith her name would have been
[2:12:43] smeared out in the Book of Judges but
[2:12:46] because she came out of judges and came
[2:12:47] into Ruth now the very lineage of Christ
[2:12:51] would come through her
[2:12:53] lineage you say God I want that for my
[2:12:56] family today I'm raising my hand and I
[2:12:59] accept it maybe you need to do that I
[2:13:02] challenge you
[2:13:03] today I challenge you today and and and
[2:13:07] you do whatever you want to do you there
[2:13:09] at your seat or come to this altar do
[2:13:11] whatever you feel you need to do but I
[2:13:13] challenge you today to take that
[2:13:17] yearslong generational tendency and come
[2:13:20] up to this alter and say I'm leaving it
[2:13:23] right here it will not haunt me it will
[2:13:26] not follow me I'm going to smash it
[2:13:30] under my feet and today I'm coming out
[2:13:33] of judges and I'm entering the land of
[2:13:37] Ruth oh Hallelujah Lord oh God give it
[2:13:41] give us that kind of inheritance to our
[2:13:43] young people to our families to our

[2:13:51] dreams to our old revive us Lord God

[2:13:56] lost all hope in Joseph he had lost all
[2:14:00] faith it was his dream got to the end of
[2:14:02] his life and his dream was dead he for
[2:14:04] all he knew Joseph was dead oh but one
[2:14:07] day he would see the evidence of wagons
[2:14:10] of increase and the Bible says Jacob was
[2:14:13] revived oh what was it Lord you sent a
[2:14:16] Revival God it was an old man receiving
[2:14:19] a Revival and becoming like a man oh I
[2:14:22] say today God give us all the families
