[27:53] [Music]
[27:54] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[27:56] lord amen let's turn to second
[27:58] corinthians 10.
[28:01] amen second corinthians 10 and verse 3
[28:07] it says for though we walk in the flesh
[28:10] we do not war after the flesh for the
[28:13] weapons
[28:14] of our warfare are not carnal
[28:17] but mighty through god to the pulling
[28:21] down of strongholds casting down
[28:23] imaginations
[28:25] and every high thing that exalted itself
[28:27] against the knowledge of god
[28:29] and bringing into captivity every
[28:32] thought
[28:33] to the obedience of christ amen
[28:36] we let you be
[28:43] i'd seated to speak to you again on
[28:45] casting down imaginations
[28:47] looking at this strongholds
[28:50] strongholds or arguments or reasonings
[28:54] by which someone tries to fortify maybe
[28:57] their opinion
[28:58] or what they believe or defend and
[29:00] defend it against
[29:02] their opponent or someone else these
[29:04] strongholds
[29:05] are thoughts or arguments or reasonings
[29:08] and we might tonight we could call them
[29:10] the fiery darts of the enemy
[29:12] that would come against our mind and
[29:14] against our our peace amen and against
[29:16] our
[29:17] against our our mind in this world that
[29:20] we're living in because
[29:21] the devil uses thoughts he uses
[29:24] arguments he uses reasonings to
[29:27] to be to bring confusion either to try
[29:30] to complicate or hinder
[29:32] or destroy our faith or our trust in god
[29:35] and our trust in all that god is and all
[29:38] that god promised that's that's
[29:40] his goal is to try to destroy our trust
[29:42] in that
[29:43] and strongholds are targeted at our mind
[29:46] or our and our real problems you know or
[29:48] not our real problem is not the trial
[29:51] or the temptation that we go through but
[29:54] what we believe
[29:55] and where we put our faith and trust in
[29:58] the middle of our problems
[30:00] amen it ain't our pride ain't the
[30:01] problem or the trial you're going
[30:03] through that's really the real problem
[30:05] the real problem is where your trust is
[30:07] while you're going through the trial
[30:09] or where your faith is while you're
[30:11] going through the trial
[30:13] what you allow to capture your mind
[30:15] while you're going through the trial
[30:17] what you allow to capture your heart and
[30:20] your mind what you allow to take
[30:22] over or to build a stronghold or it will
[30:24] determine your outcome in these
[30:26] situations
[30:27] but we know faith defends both our mind
[30:30] and our heart
[30:31] against the strongholds and the
[30:33] imaginations of the enemy
[30:35] therefore we must have a stable place to
[30:37] put our
[30:38] our faith upon and that faith can only
[30:40] rest
[30:41] upon the word of god and that word of
[30:44] god is the only thing in this
[30:46] hour that is a stable place amen there's
[30:49] only in the world that we live in and
[30:51] you know the time that we're in
[30:52] even tonight and through this week and
[30:55] through the elections and all that kind
[30:57] of thing that's going on the whole world
[30:59] is holding their breath it's very
[31:01] unstable
[31:02] thing that people don't know what to do
[31:04] some are liking it some don't like it
[31:06] some of this that and the other
[31:07] but satan is there to try to grab a hold
[31:10] of minds during this time
[31:13] and you know uh we must realize that
[31:15] we're always going to have trials we're
[31:17] always going to have temptations
[31:19] it doesn't matter who you know would
[31:21] would win the election or who would
[31:23] would be in power or this that and the
[31:25] other that does not change it one thing
[31:27] we're always
[31:28] going to have trials and tribulations
[31:31] there's always going to be things that
[31:32] we have to
[31:33] uh fight against there's always going to
[31:35] be things that we have to conquer in the
[31:37] life that we're living
[31:39] but you know james would say it like
[31:40] this he would say my brethren counted
[31:43] all
[31:43] joy when you fall in the diver's
[31:46] temptations
[31:47] knowing this that the trying of your
[31:49] faith worketh patience
[31:52] and let patience have a perfect work
[31:54] that you may be perfect
[31:55] and entire wanting nothing if any of you
[31:58] lack wisdom let him ask of god
[32:01] that giveth to all men liberally
[32:03] unabradeth not and it shall be given to
[32:05] him
[32:06] but let him ask in faith nothing
[32:09] wavering
[32:10] amen that's a key nothing wavering for
[32:12] he that wavereth is
[32:14] like a wave on the sea driven with the
[32:16] wind and tossed
[32:18] for let not that man think that he has
[32:20] received anything of the lord a
[32:22] double-minded man
[32:24] is unstable in all his ways a
[32:28] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[32:30] ways or otherwise
[32:31] other words he's prone to change he's
[32:34] prone to fail he's prone
[32:36] in the middle of temptation to give way
[32:39] because
[32:40] one day he believes it the next day he
[32:41] daunts one day he's up the next day he's
[32:43] down
[32:44] therefore double man is unstable this in
[32:46] in all of his ways let
[32:48] the brother of low degree rejoice
[32:51] in that he's exalted but the rich that
[32:54] he's made low because of the flower of
[32:56] the grass he passes away
[32:57] the sun is no sooner risen with a
[32:59] burning heat and it withers the
[33:02] grass and the flower thereof falleth and
[33:04] the grace of the fashion of it perish
[33:07] so also shall the rich man fade away in
[33:09] his ways but
[33:10] blessed is the man and that endureth
[33:13] temptation
[33:14] for when he has tried he shall receive
[33:17] the crown of life
[33:18] which the lord has promised to them that
[33:20] love him how many loves him tonight
[33:23] amen i want to read this for a moment as
[33:25] we look at some things here in the
[33:26] amplified
[33:28] it says consider it nothing but joy
[33:31] when you fall into various trials when
[33:34] you have trials
[33:35] consider it joy
[33:38] i knew that was going to be like a pen
[33:40] that would drop amen
[33:41] you know when you're in the middle of
[33:43] your trial consider it
[33:45] joy nothing but joy be assured that the
[33:48] testing of your
[33:49] faith through the experience produces an
[33:52] endurance that leads to spiritual
[33:55] maturity
[33:56] and inner peace and let endurance have
[34:00] its perfect result
[34:01] and do a thorough work in you so that
[34:03] you may be perfect
[34:05] and completely developed in your faith
[34:08] lacking nothing
[34:09] if any of you lacks wisdom to guide you
[34:11] in the decision or a circumstance
[34:14] you're to ask of our wonderful god who
[34:17] gives to everyone generously
[34:19] and without rebuke or blame and it will
[34:22] be given to you but you must ask for
[34:24] wisdom
[34:25] and faith without doubting god's
[34:28] willingness to help
[34:29] for the one who doubts it is like a
[34:31] billowing surge of the sea
[34:33] that is blown about and tossed by the
[34:36] wind for such a person ought not to
[34:38] think
[34:39] or expect they will ever receive
[34:42] anything
[34:42] at all from the lord amen
[34:46] at all from the lord for being a
[34:48] double-minded man
[34:50] unstable and restless in all his ways
[34:53] and everything he thinks feels
[34:56] or decides a double-minded man
[35:01] let the brother in humble circumstances
[35:03] glorify
[35:04] glory in his high position amen as a
[35:08] born-again believer
[35:09] called the true riches to be an heir of
[35:12] god
[35:12] and the rich man is to glory and being
[35:15] humbled
[35:16] by trials revealing human frailty
[35:18] knowing
[35:19] true true riches are only found in the
[35:22] grace of almighty god
[35:24] for the sun rises with the scorching
[35:26] wind and it withers the grass the flower
[35:28] will fall the beauty will fade away
[35:31] so too will the rich man in the midst of
[35:33] his pursuits
[35:34] fade away but blessed are happy
[35:38] and spiritually prosperous and favored
[35:41] by
[35:41] god is the man who steadfast
[35:44] under trials who will hold the line who
[35:48] will persevere
[35:49] when they're tempted but when he has
[35:51] passed the test
[35:52] and been approved he will receive the
[35:55] victor's crown of life
[35:56] which the lord has promised to those who
[35:59] love him
[36:01] hallelujah so we can be happy in the
[36:03] middle of our trials
[36:05] we don't have to be depressed in the
[36:07] middle of our trials we don't
[36:09] have to be weary or down i don't
[36:11] understand there's
[36:12] there's human emotions and things but
[36:14] amen there has to be something greater
[36:16] than your human emotion they're asking
[36:18] you know i know people go on their
[36:20] emotions you know they get sick and they
[36:21] go on their emotions for a while
[36:23] but the only thing that will produce a
[36:25] healing is not an emotion
[36:27] the only thing that will produce a
[36:29] healing is faith in almighty god's word
[36:32] amen so many times we work on emotions
[36:34] we go out on emotions and we're up or
[36:36] we're down
[36:37] we're this way we're that way but that's
[36:40] unstable that's a double-minded man
[36:42] there's only one person that can have
[36:44] stability in
[36:45] this life is to take these imaginations
[36:48] and
[36:48] cast them down and exalt the word of god
[36:51] and say the word of god is true no
[36:54] matter who's in power
[36:55] the word of god's and true is true no
[36:57] matter how bad the world gets
[36:59] the word of god is true no matter how
[37:01] terrible things may seem around me
[37:03] the word of god has not failed it's not
[37:06] faltered
[37:07] it's not lost one one iota or fact or
[37:10] it's not lost the truth it's still the
[37:12] truth of the hour

[47:17] real word and he's here by his visible
[47:20] evidence
[47:21] and he shows us he's we're we're with us

[47:56] nailed the theses up and he's a
[47:58] and he's all about you know the the the
[48:00] roman catholic church and all this
[48:02] and being against it and all that you
[48:04] know i'm thinking well i've tried to
[48:06] show him down through the scriptures and
[48:08] all these things

[48:29] unstable
[48:30] what a privileged people we are

[48:39] hallelujah to know that this world is
[48:42] not my home
[48:45] hallelujah i mean you can elect george
[48:47] washington
[48:48] and it'll never go back to what it was
[48:50] again this world is not my home
[48:53] i'm just a passing through but while i'm
[48:56] passing through
[48:57] i might as well have a good time cause
[48:59] i'm on my way home
[49:09] he said this in 62. he said he said i
[49:13] don't know how the canadian
[49:14] people are feeling now but the americans
[49:17] are putting on one of the biggest bluffs
[49:19] i've ever seen
[49:20] just like the rest of the world they're
[49:22] acting like they're not afraid
[49:24] but they're scared to death they're
[49:28] hiding in the
[49:29] hiding in the government all kinds of
[49:31] places digging down the ground reminds
[49:33] me of a little boy passing the graveyard
[49:34] at nighttime
[49:35] whistling saying he's awful brave he
[49:37] just whistle in the dark
[49:39] actions speak louder than words because
[49:42] the time has come where we'll not need
[49:45] military forces anymore just one fanatic
[49:48] to pull the trigger
[49:49] and the whole world will blow up i do
[49:52] not believe
[49:53] amen he said god cannot defeat his own
[49:57] purpose
[49:58] the earth was put here and there will be
[50:00] a millennial reign upon the earth for a
[50:02] thousand years that the church has done
[50:04] taken home
[50:05] amen he said but when those sights begin
[50:07] to come to pass
[50:09] lift up your head redemption draweth
[50:13] nigh
[50:14] don't look down and be weary we're just
[50:16] coming to the place
[50:18] for the coming of our lord jesus this is
[50:21] where we're at we're just coming to the
[50:23] place
[50:24] of the coming of our lord jesus that's
[50:27] nothing to be sad about
[50:28] unless you're not ready to go but
[50:31] i am in tonight if you find yourself
[50:33] worried and stressed out
[50:35] listen there's time to get ready lay
[50:38] aside every weight lay aside everything
[50:41] that's both
[50:41] so easily beset you and run the race
[50:46] we're just about home
[50:52] we're coming to the place for the coming
[50:56] of our lord jesus
[50:58] instead of being weary we should be the
[51:01] most happiest people
[51:02] in the whole world why
[51:06] and he says and we are why because we're
[51:10] not afraid of bombs
[51:16] bombs don't bother us i said the other
[51:19] day he said i said you can't dig far
[51:21] enough to get away from
[51:22] them this is a 62. you sure can't dig
[51:24] far enough away now
[51:26] blow your bones you can get down and
[51:28] concussions bones blow it apart
[51:30] 150 you know feet deep i mean you
[51:33] dig all you want to you're not going to
[51:35] get away from it but you know one good
[51:37] thing
[51:38] science can work out all kinds of things
[51:40] but god was way ahead of that
[51:43] we have a bomb shelter and it's not made
[51:47] out of steel
[51:48] it's made out of feathers hallelujah
[51:51] under his wings were resting
[51:54] and before it explodes we'll be out
[51:57] until going into a land where there's no
[52:00] sickness
[52:00] no sorrow no old age and will be forever
[52:04] renewed back to youth again and it will
[52:07] be that way
[52:08] forever therefore we ought to be the
[52:12] most happiest
[52:13] people on the face of this earth because
[52:16] my trust is not in a government
[52:18] it's not in what i can do i'm under some
[52:20] feathers
[52:23] shielded from the fiery darts of the
[52:27] enemy
[52:28] and when it comes cast them down
[52:32] cast them down cast them down
[52:39] well what what do we got to lose nothing
[52:43] what have we got to win everything
[52:49] we don't know how long it's going to
[52:51] last
[52:53] maybe gone by morning
[52:57] maybe our last time together
[53:00] listen this is how we ought to take
[53:03] every service
[53:04] it may be our last time together we have
[53:07] may have had our last youth camp
[53:09] together
[53:12] we may have had our last meetings big
[53:14] meetings together i don't know what the
[53:16] future holds
[53:19] but whether it is or whether it isn't we
[53:21] can't lose
[53:24] so therefore our minds don't have to get
[53:26] all worried and stewed up and stirred up
[53:28] amen no there's no way for a christian
[53:31] to lose
[53:33] you just can't lose no matter what
[53:36] there's no loss in a christian if i live
[53:39] i gain if i die i gain
[53:42] hallelujah there's no loss amen he talks
[53:46] about another place he said just to
[53:47] build the faith of the people
[53:49] just to get them built to a place where
[53:51] it gets all the scare away from them
[53:54] he said a christian has not one worry
[53:57] in the world
[54:04] hello somebody that's quite a statement
[54:09] how many count i wonder how many we
[54:11] could count of worries today that we had
[54:12] today
[54:13] maybe in the last five minutes one worry
[54:17] in the world we should be
[54:20] the most freest happiest people
[54:23] in all the world
[54:26] you can't lose
[54:33] all things work together for the good to
[54:35] them that love god
[54:37] how can we lose there's nothing too
[54:39] loose we're anchored in jesus
[54:44] we're just at the point of going home
[54:55] you know
[54:59] he would say at another place and i'm
[55:00] just going to lay a few of these things
[55:01] in
[55:03] to the covenant people he said
[55:05] whatsoever things you desire as a
[55:07] christian when you pray believe when you
[55:08] receive it
[55:09] and hold right on to it and it'll be
[55:11] given to you
[55:13] it will be given hold right on to it
[55:15] because god said it would do it
[55:17] i'm here as a confirmation i'm going
[55:19] away going back to the father
[55:20] the holy ghost will come and he will
[55:22] confirm everything i've said
[55:23] he will be with you he will continue
[55:25] this ministry till i return again
[55:27] and here we are sitting in the building
[55:29] tonight feeling the same holy ghost
[55:32] that fell on the day of pentecost the
[55:35] same holy spirit that led abraham
[55:38] the same holy ghost that performed the
[55:40] miracles in the early church
[55:42] the same signs the same wonders the same
[55:45] baptism
[55:46] the same results what we got to worry
[55:49] about
[55:52] god swore he'd do it you can't lose
[55:57] god said so it don't make any difference
[56:00] what
[56:00] anybody else says
[56:03] or what anybody else does
[56:08] we can't lose
[56:14] you know satan has spent his time taking
[56:18] the things of god and perverting them
[56:20] into evil things
[56:23] beginning to pervert things into evil
[56:25] instead of good
[56:27] when satan first done that god as soon
[56:30] as it was first done
[56:31] out of his great treasure trust of love
[56:35] he had a plan of redemption that quick
[56:39] he didn't have to sit down and think it
[56:42] all over and
[56:43] how it would be and how am i going to
[56:46] make this work and
[56:47] how am i going to get this back i mean
[56:49] how in the world

[56:53] had a wonderful
[56:54] evening and and and and i just
[56:58] out of nowhere here he comes and he just
[57:00] pulled the wool over my eyes no
[57:03] uh before it ever happened
[57:09] he knew how it would be he's infinite
[57:13] he had in his great heart how he'd bring
[57:15] all this about
[57:17] how if he foreknew the church he
[57:19] foreknew christ he foreign to the plan
[57:21] and he set it all in order and all the
[57:23] world
[57:24] turning around just according to his
[57:27] plan
[57:29] amen and you being dead yourself dead in
[57:32] christ

[57:35] christ god
[57:36] is working all things together for the
[57:39] good
[57:40] to them that love him
[57:43] so how can we lose
[57:48] when the infinite god who started all
[57:51] this is still here
[57:54] and he made this plan of redemption and
[57:56] it worked out perfectly
[57:57] according to his plan he foreshadowed it
[58:00] all through the scriptures
[58:01] he brought this one for this type and
[58:03] this one for that type and there ain't
[58:04] no way in the world we can sit there and
[58:06] make all that up
[58:08] god did it in his infinite knowledge
[58:10] bringing out of this one
[58:11] out of this one out of this and
[58:12] pre-planning you to be here
[58:16] by his foreknowledge amen god was so
[58:20] i mean so designed that he would bring
[58:22] you to this place for this certain age
[58:25] to live here and have a certain thing
[58:27] about you to do a certain way
[58:28] to have a certain nature to be a certain
[58:31] way amen to make you this or that or
[58:33] whatever his gifts he would give you
[58:35] or whatever he would like for you to be
[58:36] on the earth god had already planned it
[58:38] all out
[58:39] and therefore god knew exactly exactly
[58:42] how all of this was going to play out
[58:44] nothing is surprising god
[58:55] but there's only one loser in this whole
[58:57] thing
[59:00] you can't lose but satan will
[59:06] and everything that's under him will
[59:12] the devil will lose god
[59:16] will always win
[59:20] amen if you're on the wrong side sure
[59:21] you're going to lose but if you're on
[59:23] god's side
[59:24] which is the right side you will win
[59:27] you cannot lose
[59:31] hallelujah
[59:36] you know
[59:42] you take your sickness doctors are
[59:45] giving you up to die
[59:50] just say go home you know hospice
[59:54] just got a prayer request for a friend
[59:55] of mine who's just an acquaintance
[59:58] his mother's been given up to die to go
[1:00:00] home to hospice with ovarian cancer
[1:00:05] lee fox mother prayer request
[1:00:09] asking god to be merciful
[1:00:14] but you can't lose by trusting god
[1:00:24] you know he would he would brother talk
[1:00:26] about we know the story in the bible
[1:00:28] of of the of the of the lepers that
[1:00:31] sat by the gate there and said why do we
[1:00:34] sit here till we die
[1:00:36] let's go into the city and we know the
[1:00:39] story
[1:00:40] samaria was being seized by the syrians
[1:00:42] and they're so hungry they're starving
[1:00:44] them to death
[1:00:45] until they'd eat the bark off the ground
[1:00:47] off the off the uh
[1:00:48] a tree and grass off the ground and boil
[1:00:51] one another's children to eat
[1:00:55] lepers couldn't come in the city they
[1:00:56] were they were contagious
[1:00:59] why what they said we're going to die
[1:01:02] here or we can die there
[1:01:04] why sit here until we die let's go down
[1:01:07] the syrians if they kill us whatever
[1:01:09] we're going to die
[1:01:10] anyhow they had to take a chance
[1:01:14] but you know what that story was all
[1:01:16] about
[1:01:18] it was about faith they started down
[1:01:21] towards assyrians
[1:01:23] and just because they began to move
[1:01:25] under that faith
[1:01:26] and that inspiration god amen began to
[1:01:30] send a big rumble through the desert
[1:01:33] all the way down to the whole midst of
[1:01:34] them syrians so they got so confused by
[1:01:37] it all
[1:01:37] they ran away and left their tents and
[1:01:39] all their food
[1:01:40] and they found plenty to heat not only
[1:01:42] did it save their own life
[1:01:44] but the leopard saved the city's life
[1:01:47] i mean look what a chance they had to
[1:01:50] take
[1:01:51] and you don't even have to take that
[1:01:53] chance
[1:01:55] all you've got to do is trust god
[1:01:58] and you can't lose by trusting god
[1:02:01] you're not asked to go down to the camp
[1:02:03] of the enemy
[1:02:04] you're invited to the house of god
[1:02:07] who's waiting for you and there's no
[1:02:10] losing
[1:02:13] whether you be a leper whether it be
[1:02:14] sick whether it be this whether you be
[1:02:16] that
[1:02:17] there's no losing you are invited
[1:02:20] to the house of god
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:23] and god is here to perform his word
[1:02:27] there's no losing the only way you'll
[1:02:31] lose
[1:02:32] if you sit still and don't act
[1:02:38] amen but you're invited
[1:02:44] how many says it's true that
[1:02:47] if you sit there when the spirit of
[1:02:49] god's moving
[1:02:51] and you don't react you lose
[1:02:57] i mean think about the loss that the
[1:02:59] woman would have had
[1:03:00] who ended up touching jesus's garment
[1:03:04] when he come by if she'd just sit there
[1:03:08] or blind as we talked about last weekend
[1:03:10] about last wednesday about blind
[1:03:11] bartimaeus what if it
[1:03:12] says oh okay that's that's just somebody
[1:03:14] somebody trying to be somebody
[1:03:16] and he just let him go on by and and
[1:03:18] next thing you know he's out of sight
[1:03:20] out of earshot and it's over he'd have
[1:03:22] died a blind man
[1:03:24] he had a lot to lose by sitting there
[1:03:36] god won't fail us heavens and earth will
[1:03:39] pass away but his word won't fail
[1:03:41] god will not fail us
[1:03:48] you know he would it would going back to
[1:03:51] the greatest battle ever
[1:03:52] fought brother branham went to a
[1:03:55] football stadium one time and was going
[1:03:57] to preach
[1:03:59] so he stopped at the door and looked up
[1:04:00] and there was a sign that said it's not
[1:04:02] the size of the dog of the fight
[1:04:04] it's the size of the fight in the dog
[1:04:08] that's what wins the battle somebody
[1:04:12] willing to fight
[1:04:14] somebody willing to move somebody
[1:04:16] willing to step out and say this is the
[1:04:18] promise of god

[1:04:33] craziest fighting dog ever seen in my
[1:04:35] life is a little chihuahua

[1:04:41] someway he's cast down every imagination
[1:04:47] truly
[1:04:52] of him being tore up and ripped apart by
[1:04:54] this rottweiler and he'll just let her
[1:04:56] go

[1:04:59] chase rottweilers big old dogs
[1:05:01] out of the yard
[1:05:05] amen this is what brother brad was
[1:05:06] talking about he said it's the fight in
[1:05:09] the dog that counts
[1:05:10] it's the faith in the individual

[1:05:16] little cuddle hole
