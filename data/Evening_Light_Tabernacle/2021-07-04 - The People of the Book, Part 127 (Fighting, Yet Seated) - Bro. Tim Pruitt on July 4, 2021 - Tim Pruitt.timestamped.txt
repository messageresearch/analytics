[55:08] moment i want to speak to you and then
[55:10] we'll read the word of god
[55:12] so um you know we got a lot of things
[55:14] today to
[55:15] that's on our hearts and um uh
[55:19] you know i just wanted to just uh
[55:22] mention again what we heard thank you um
[55:25] the other night where brother timothy
[55:27] was sharing about his meeting that he
[55:29] had over
[55:30] at brother ron spencer's and how the
[55:33] phenomena was done
[55:35] and um you know brother michael dexter
[55:38] was also there and they'd asked him to
[55:40] come and sing a song and he was
[55:42] talking about the great physician now is
[55:45] near the sympathizing jesus and how
[55:48] when a little baby was a young boy that
[55:51] was all twisted up
[55:53] was help being held in brother branham's
[55:56] arms as
[55:57] a little dunkard or mennonite girl some
[55:59] type of
[56:00] i'm not really sure what what they were
[56:03] from he says
[56:04] different ones but anyway you know she
[56:07] she was there playing the piano and uh
[56:10] the the great physician now is near the
[56:12] sympathizing jesus and brother michael
[56:14] was telling about this
[56:16] and and and preface before he sang and
[56:19] he really just caught his musicians off
[56:21] guard because they thought he was going
[56:22] to sing that and
[56:24] instead he's saying when jesus comes
[56:27] the tempter's power is broken when jesus
[56:30] comes
[56:31] amen our fears are wiped away
[56:35] he takes the gloom and he fills the
[56:36] heart with gladness
[56:38] and all is changed when jesus comes to
[56:40] stay
[56:41] amen and so that was kind of the
[56:44] preference to that and then brother
[56:46] timothy preached on the god that answers
[56:49] and he and he stepped out on a little
[56:51] platform
[56:52] it's kind of out front maybe about three
[56:54] or four five feet out
[56:56] you can walk out on it just a couple of
[56:58] steps down it would be like
[57:00] a circle like this in front of brother
[57:02] ron's pulpit there but
[57:04] just a little lower platform where they
[57:06] can walk out and he
[57:08] stepped out and was was preaching there
[57:11] and leaving his ipad
[57:12] with his notes on the pulpit and he
[57:15] doesn't wear
[57:16] i watch you know so uh
[57:19] that couldn't been it but as he said
[57:22] as he was preaching he has come down
[57:26] you know like the for the three hebrew
[57:28] children and
[57:29] stepped into the fire and he's he has
[57:32] come
[57:33] down for us and and he talked about you
[57:36] know how that
[57:36] you know in that moment he just called
[57:38] for the east winds the north winds south
[57:40] and
[57:41] and and there was there in a moment said
[57:43] this is a job for me
[57:45] and at that moment his ipad began to
[57:49] switch off from his notes and
[57:52] and change over select a sermon of
[57:54] brother branham's and begin to play
[57:56] and brother brandon's voice begin to say
[57:59] you know
[57:59] my favorite hymn is down from his glory
[58:02] because he's come
[58:03] down to show he's not just a prophet or
[58:06] a junior god but he's the almighty god
[58:09] but he has come down among us and um
[58:13] so you know it just went together when
[58:15] jesus comes
[58:16] the tempter power is broken and and then
[58:19] he has come down brother ron
[58:21] sitting on the platform he said he
[58:23] watched the whole thing it was just like
[58:25] you know someone was pushing buttons on
[58:27] there and making it happen
[58:29] and you know and so it was prefaced
[58:32] actually by brother michael mentioning
[58:35] the angel of god continuing to play the
[58:38] piano
[58:39] when that little baby dropped out of
[58:41] brother branham's arms
[58:43] and uh began to run across the platform
[58:47] and
[58:47] that little sister seeing that jumped up
[58:49] and began to worship god and
[58:51] and speaking in another language and and
[58:55] and their uh dancing and and rejoicing
[58:58] over this great victory and the piano
[59:00] never missed a beat
[59:01] continued right on and so you know we
[59:04] we saw the phenomena being done that god
[59:08] is among us amen and so
[59:11] i just wanted to to remind you that
[59:15] because we still need a miracle for
[59:17] sister karen
[59:18] they uh had been planning to move her to
[59:21] a rehab on tuesday
[59:23] but we're still facing obstacles today
[59:26] we
[59:27] we needed a new um cat scan done and
[59:30] um so they're checking some some issues
[59:33] that have come up
[59:34] and so we really need your prayers about
[59:36] that as as we stand here today
[59:39] but um you know where as as i went in
[59:43] last night to see her i i reminded
[59:47] myself we walk
[59:48] by faith and not by sight
[59:52] so i'm not looking at what i see i'm
[59:54] looking at what he says
[59:57] and so you know it we demonstrated
[1:00:01] sunday with brother timothy hall you
[1:00:03] know about
[1:00:05] as he had a yellow shirt on and i called
[1:00:07] it black
[1:00:08] and when i asked brother l there you
[1:00:11] know
[1:00:12] well you know brother l what what color
[1:00:15] is that shirt
[1:00:16] and he said well i'll just go with you
[1:00:19] what you say
[1:00:20] and uh you know he did this because
[1:00:24] he has confidence and he believes in my
[1:00:26] knowledge
[1:00:27] my position the authority that i carry
[1:00:30] as a pastor and
[1:00:31] if i said that shirt was black when it
[1:00:33] was yellow and he could see it was
[1:00:35] obviously yellow he was going to say
[1:00:37] whatever i said you know but in doing so
[1:00:40] he would have to deny
[1:00:42] what his sense of faith said all right
[1:00:46] now this is a way we often do
[1:00:49] our faith says the word of god is true
[1:00:52] our faith says we are healed by his
[1:00:55] stripes
[1:00:56] our faith makes a claim on the promise
[1:00:59] but then a person with
[1:01:01] knowledge or position or authority tells
[1:01:04] us something different
[1:01:05] from what our faith says and then we
[1:01:08] just surrender up our faith
[1:01:10] to the knowledge of man and deny what
[1:01:13] this sense of faith says now
[1:01:16] faith is looking at something different
[1:01:19] than what is
[1:01:20] obvious to the eye faith is looking into
[1:01:23] the
[1:01:24] unseen and to a divine promise and what
[1:01:27] jesus did at calvary
[1:01:29] and uh i just want to say we have been
[1:01:31] buffeted by
[1:01:32] messenger from satan and it's been blow
[1:01:35] after blow after blow now and that god
[1:01:39] has brought us through each time
[1:01:41] and he'll bring us through again i wear
[1:01:44] on my
[1:01:45] right hand right here on my middle
[1:01:47] finger
[1:01:48] you know um because it fits that finger
[1:01:51] that's reason i wear it there
[1:01:53] i have my wedding band over here and an
[1:01:55] anniversary ring my wife gave me when
[1:01:57] this one wore
[1:01:58] thin and broke and she bought me another
[1:02:01] one and it didn't fit so i put it
[1:02:03] on this put it there on my hand wore
[1:02:05] that for a while it wasn't comfortable
[1:02:07] so i put it away and and um you know
[1:02:11] um just uh for a long time
[1:02:14] i had you know just i actually took this
[1:02:18] this my original band and had them a
[1:02:20] jeweler fix it and put it back
[1:02:22] on and it just sat in the drawer for a
[1:02:24] long long time
[1:02:26] when we went to the meetings many of you
[1:02:28] know for the last
[1:02:29] i'm going to say eight years we have
[1:02:31] dealt with
[1:02:32] menopause and and the hormonal changes
[1:02:36] and
[1:02:37] uh a lot of a lot of different things
[1:02:40] that has been
[1:02:40] really really trying and very difficult
[1:02:43] and then the
[1:02:44] major brain believed that happened in
[1:02:46] 2015 and then we had
[1:02:49] uh last year we we had an another brain
[1:02:52] bleed and
[1:02:53] uh actually two and one was very major
[1:02:56] where it required surgery
[1:02:58] so we have been buffeted by you know
[1:03:00] over and again but anyway
[1:03:01] when i went to germany after the first
[1:03:04] brain bleed
[1:03:05] and i was preaching over there and uh
[1:03:09] you know sister karen was very very
[1:03:12] upset
[1:03:13] because of um and nervous because
[1:03:16] there was some confrontations that was
[1:03:19] going on in the meetings
[1:03:21] and uh where i was dealing with some of
[1:03:23] the brothers about some of the
[1:03:25] issues uh that their false doctrine has
[1:03:28] caused and there had been some
[1:03:30] altercations that was being
[1:03:32] said in the and the pulpit there by some
[1:03:35] others and so i was meeting that head on
[1:03:37] i was out
[1:03:38] to two o'clock in the morning and my
[1:03:40] wife was really upset about it and
[1:03:42] she had been going through even though
[1:03:44] she'd been healed of the brain bleed and
[1:03:46] had recovered from that and she was just
[1:03:49] still going through these
[1:03:50] really mood swings of this uh hormone
[1:03:53] situation and
[1:03:54] we had to take her to a doctor and
[1:03:56] finally you know give her some
[1:03:58] hormonal treatments that was a natural
[1:04:00] thing
[1:04:01] of a naturopath anyway but
[1:04:04] we we had all that going on and and it
[1:04:07] was better but it wasn't
[1:04:09] it wasn't fixed and we were really
[1:04:12] dealing with it
[1:04:13] over and again and i found her at two
[1:04:15] o'clock in the morning and walking up
[1:04:17] and down in our
[1:04:18] room and just crying and fretting and
[1:04:21] saying you know
[1:04:22] i was worried about you and you know i
[1:04:25] know
[1:04:25] i know i've heard stories and things
[1:04:27] that have happened and
[1:04:28] and and i said why you know i can hold
[1:04:31] my own i said i
[1:04:33] i've never had problems holding my own
[1:04:35] so
[1:04:36] you know so i they didn't have to you
[1:04:39] didn't have to worry about
[1:04:40] them you need to be worried about them
[1:04:42] you know didn't have to be worried about
[1:04:44] me be worried about them i said but you
[1:04:45] know let's just go to bed and
[1:04:47] let's go and you know we was really
[1:04:49] dealing with that and
[1:04:50] and brother ron didn't come to the
[1:04:52] meeting till late
[1:04:54] his father-in-law was in a very
[1:04:57] difficult
[1:04:57] condition he would later die um some
[1:05:01] months later but he kind of had to be
[1:05:03] delayed coming to the meeting and he
[1:05:05] spoke
[1:05:06] and so we didn't have a real time to
[1:05:09] speak together a lot and he knew nothing
[1:05:12] about
[1:05:13] what had happened during the night and
[1:05:16] as he was preaching he said you know
[1:05:20] god is going to he told about sister
[1:05:22] karen's healing of the brain bleed and
[1:05:24] he said god's going to finish what he
[1:05:26] started
[1:05:27] and he walks down and he pulls her out
[1:05:30] of the audience and he said god saw you
[1:05:32] in the night
[1:05:33] ringing your hands and threatening
[1:05:35] crying and walking up and down the room
[1:05:38] god saw you
[1:05:41] but he's going to heal you we never had
[1:05:44] to take another treatment we never had
[1:05:45] another mood swing
[1:05:47] every situation was vanished was gone
[1:05:50] in an instant well i walked home
[1:05:54] i come home rather we flew home and i
[1:05:58] walked into my house and as i went in i
[1:06:02] happened to pass by and was looking for
[1:06:05] something and
[1:06:05] saw my ring laying there and i looked
[1:06:09] at that ring and i tried it on this
[1:06:12] finger it didn't fit and i tried it on
[1:06:14] that one and it fit and i said
[1:06:17] well this was before menopause and this
[1:06:21] is
[1:06:21] after menopause
[1:06:25] and i've been wearing it as a token of
[1:06:29] my of her healing and her deliverance
[1:06:32] well just a few days ago last week or so
[1:06:36] a messenger of satan
[1:06:38] emailed me accused me of being a witch
[1:06:41] because i wore it on a finger and
[1:06:43] you know and said i you know next thing
[1:06:45] i'd be wearing earrings
[1:06:46] even though i've never been effeminate
[1:06:49] my goodness
[1:06:50] you know um and um and then you know
[1:06:53] blasted me like that and so i said well
[1:06:55] maybe i'm stumbling people and i put it
[1:06:57] back in the drawer and
[1:06:59] you know this has happened and today i
[1:07:01] put it back on and i said i'll wear my
[1:07:03] testimony i don't care what they say
[1:07:17] but after he compared me with you know
[1:07:19] like smoking cigarettes or
[1:07:21] you know being like a witch or whatever
[1:07:23] else i said well i'll put it away for a
[1:07:25] while
[1:07:26] but you promise me you'll get rid of
[1:07:27] your broom and your cat
[1:07:39] now we have been buffeted by me and
[1:07:42] by messenger of satan don't think this
[1:07:45] is on
[1:07:46] this is something unusual
[1:07:50] don't think so jesus was a man of sorrow
[1:07:54] acquainted with
[1:07:55] grief amen
[1:07:59] so he he was he he knew what it was to
[1:08:03] have a lot of trouble that come his way
[1:08:06] the bible said we even hid our faces
[1:08:09] from him when he needed a friend he
[1:08:11] didn't have one
[1:08:12] but thank god i i've got so many friends
[1:08:15] out here
[1:08:16] amen and god bless you i you know
[1:08:18] brother sister stanky brought me a big
[1:08:21] uh bunch of blueberries far in your your
[1:08:23] little red containers right out here by
[1:08:25] the door
[1:08:26] and don't forget it today and many of
[1:08:28] you have brought food
[1:08:29] and helped us and brother wendell was
[1:08:32] here and
[1:08:32] my goodness we never ate so good in our
[1:08:34] lives and
[1:08:36] so you know we we just had a you know
[1:08:39] great time with them they came and
[1:08:41] really was a blessing was a messenger
[1:08:43] from god
[1:08:44] so you know but god has brought us
[1:08:46] through each time
[1:08:47] and he'll bring us through again now
[1:08:50] i'll just say this
[1:08:51] if this is the the time of the end of
[1:08:54] her journey upon earth
[1:08:56] she cannot die she can only change
[1:08:59] dimensions i watched her die
[1:09:02] you know some 45 years ago at an altar
[1:09:05] and raised up again to be known as a
[1:09:08] child of the most high god
[1:09:10] and today she lies in the hospital where
[1:09:13] in the natural eye it looks very dark
[1:09:16] she has a breed on the
[1:09:17] bleed on the right side of her brain it
[1:09:20] affects her cognitive skills it may be
[1:09:23] affecting her limbs on the left
[1:09:24] side but today we turn our eyes from
[1:09:28] from all of that we look back to calvary
[1:09:30] where he was
[1:09:31] wounded for our transgressions
[1:09:34] and bruised for our iniquity now on
[1:09:37] on friday brother timothy and i visit
[1:09:39] her her in the icu
[1:09:41] and she had not spoken then for 18 hours
[1:09:45] would not eat or drink or take oral
[1:09:47] medication
[1:09:48] and i was very concerned and so we went
[1:09:51] up and prayed for her
[1:09:52] and as i went to her bedside she
[1:09:56] you know called my name and told me she
[1:09:57] loved me
[1:10:05] and then after prayer brother timothy
[1:10:06] began to speak to her
[1:10:08] and said mom god has come down
[1:10:11] and as that moment without prompting
[1:10:16] she began to sing softly
[1:10:19] down from his glory
[1:10:25] my god and my savior came and
[1:10:28] jesus was his name twice we've heard
[1:10:31] that saying today
[1:10:33] and she began to weep as she began to
[1:10:36] sing
[1:10:36] oh how i love him how i adore him
[1:10:39] my breath my sunshine so today
[1:10:43] we look away from these troubles and we
[1:10:46] look away to jesus
[1:10:48] you know brother branham preached on job
[1:10:50] so much that
[1:10:52] when he was going through the trial and
[1:10:54] i guess losing his wife and daughter and
[1:10:56] all
[1:10:56] the other thing preached on job so much
[1:10:59] that somebody asked him one time said
[1:11:00] when you're going to get job off the ash
[1:11:02] heap
[1:11:03] and if this seems redundant well i just
[1:11:06] want to say i'm in battle
[1:11:08] but i'm going to tell you where i'm
[1:11:09] fighting from so i want you to turn with
[1:11:11] me to revelation 12 verse 7 we'll stand
[1:11:14] in honor to the word and we'll look
[1:11:18] now to the promise of god
[1:11:23] revelation 12 7 and there was war in
[1:11:26] heaven
[1:11:26] michael and his angels fought against
[1:11:28] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:11:30] angels and
[1:11:31] prevailed not and neither was their
[1:11:34] place found anymore in heaven and the
[1:11:36] great dragon was cast out that old
[1:11:37] serpent called the devil and satan which
[1:11:39] deceiveth the whole world
[1:11:41] he was cast out into the earth and his
[1:11:43] angels were cast out with him
[1:11:46] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[1:11:48] heaven now he has come salvation and
[1:11:50] strength and the kingdom of our god and
[1:11:52] the power of his christ
[1:11:54] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:11:57] down which accused them before our god
[1:12:00] day and night
[1:12:01] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:12:03] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:12:05] testimonies
[1:12:06] and they love not their lives unto the
[1:12:08] death therefore rejoice you heavens
[1:12:11] and ye that dwell in them and woe to the
[1:12:13] inhabiters of the earth
[1:12:15] and of the sea for the devil has come
[1:12:18] down unto you having great wrath
[1:12:20] because he knoweth he hath but a short
[1:12:23] time
[1:12:25] when we remind the devil he only has a
[1:12:27] short time
[1:12:29] amen there is a limit to him
[1:12:32] but there's not a limit on us
[1:12:36] god bless you can be seated i'm going to
[1:12:39] be speaking on today
[1:12:41] fighting while seated or yet seated
[1:12:45] fighting yet
[1:12:46] seated now when man sinned
[1:12:50] and fell from his rightful position as
[1:12:53] ruler of the earth he lost his throne
[1:12:56] and his dominion
[1:12:58] and satan took that dominion becoming
[1:13:00] the prince of the power
[1:13:02] of the air or atmospheres heaven became
[1:13:06] obscured by his darkness satan
[1:13:10] became the ruler as the prince of this
[1:13:12] world and
[1:13:13] took lordship over man and every man
[1:13:17] that is
[1:13:17] born of sexual birth would be born
[1:13:21] dead and dead to god that is
[1:13:24] but alive to sin and the new birth of
[1:13:28] course is the reversal of that
[1:13:30] it makes us dead to sin and alive to god
[1:13:34] and gives christ the lordship over our
[1:13:38] lives
[1:13:39] where satan is no longer ruler
[1:13:42] now satan is called in scriptures like
[1:13:46] ii corinthians 4 4 the god of this evil
[1:13:49] age
[1:13:50] in john 14 30 he speaks of satan
[1:13:53] as the prince of this world and then he
[1:13:56] declares
[1:13:57] that he has no claim or no part in me
[1:14:01] now so through the fall this earth was
[1:14:04] given to the devil
[1:14:06] in luke chapter 4 verse 6
[1:14:09] um that he said satan said to him
[1:14:12] to you i will give all this authority
[1:14:15] and their
[1:14:16] and their glory and it's been delivered
[1:14:18] to me and i will give it
[1:14:20] to whomsoever i will so you can see that
[1:14:24] satan
[1:14:24] knows that um it has been delivered to
[1:14:28] him
[1:14:29] all this power over all
[1:14:32] the earth he showed him all the kingdoms
[1:14:35] of the world it says
[1:14:36] luke 4 4 and matthew 4 4 you'll find
[1:14:39] where
[1:14:40] jesus is opposed by satan and and then
[1:14:42] this
[1:14:43] moment of time the devil said this power
[1:14:46] is mine this authority was given to me
[1:14:49] and he said i'll give it to you if
[1:14:52] you'll just
[1:14:53] bow down and worship me and
[1:14:56] and so he he is a prince
[1:14:59] and although he's an evil prince
[1:15:02] but i declare he is not the king
[1:15:06] amen and he's certainly not my king for
[1:15:10] there
[1:15:10] is but one king and that is jesus christ
[1:15:13] the bible says in first timothy 6 15 he
[1:15:16] is the blessed and only
[1:15:18] potentate or sovereign the king of kings
[1:15:21] and lord of lords
[1:15:23] now every kingdom of this world of
[1:15:25] course is governed by the devil
[1:15:27] the earth uh this earth
[1:15:31] belongs to the devil now not legally
[1:15:34] but as a squatter he claims what adam
[1:15:37] surrendered to him now god didn't give
[1:15:40] him the earth
[1:15:41] god didn't give him the power of the
[1:15:43] earth man did that
[1:15:45] by his fault he surrendered himself
[1:15:49] to come under the rulership gave satan
[1:15:52] lordship over his life so he
[1:15:55] surrendered to him and
[1:15:58] adam surrendered it to him and he
[1:16:00] retains now
[1:16:02] the control over the earth even somewhat
[1:16:05] our bodies
[1:16:06] because our bodies are of this earth uh
[1:16:08] it retains it by contesting our rights
[1:16:12] to possession by his accusation
[1:16:15] of our sins he is called the accuser of
[1:16:19] the
[1:16:20] brethren now this is a reason we have
[1:16:23] wars and shootings and fightings and
[1:16:25] trouble
[1:16:26] is because the kingdoms of this world is
[1:16:28] the kingdoms of the devil
[1:16:31] that won't always be that way because in
[1:16:33] the millennium
[1:16:35] there's a scripture that's prophesized
[1:16:37] of it rejoice all your heavens
[1:16:39] and you holy prophets of the earth for
[1:16:41] the kingdoms of this
[1:16:43] earth have become the kingdoms of our
[1:16:45] lord and
[1:16:46] he shall rule forever and ever so you
[1:16:49] see
[1:16:49] it is promised then that where we will
[1:16:51] have no more war
[1:16:53] when jesus comes there'll be no more
[1:16:55] sickness there's no trouble
[1:16:57] but right now we are incorruptible
[1:17:00] bodies
[1:17:01] so we are septic to all kinds of things
[1:17:04] remember
[1:17:05] jesus was acquainted with grief
[1:17:08] amen he knew what it was to suffer pain
[1:17:12] sorrow sickness everything that we go
[1:17:15] through
[1:17:16] amen it all happens to him when he was
[1:17:20] mortal somebody with me but jesus
[1:17:23] declared when he is lifted up
[1:17:26] on the cross that it would initiate the
[1:17:29] casting down of satan
[1:17:31] as the prince of this world and
[1:17:35] it would and at the same time it would
[1:17:37] exalt
[1:17:39] exalt of men to the throne
[1:17:42] of sonship now the end results of what
[1:17:46] happened at calvary will produce the
[1:17:49] ultimate
[1:17:51] victory of what we have read about today
[1:17:54] where that satan is cast down
[1:17:57] the accuser of the brethren now as jesus
[1:18:01] approached
[1:18:01] the cross he declared victory
[1:18:05] he looked right in the face of death and
[1:18:08] he didn't look at
[1:18:09] as defeat but as he went he looked at it
[1:18:12] and he said
[1:18:13] now will the prince of this world be
[1:18:16] cast out
[1:18:17] and it and of course it would be done by
[1:18:20] the re for the redemption of our sins
[1:18:22] through his death
[1:18:23] on the cross he said if i be lifted up
[1:18:27] he said then satan will be cast down
[1:18:31] now again this was signifying of his
[1:18:34] death
[1:18:34] on the cross where he would be lifted up
[1:18:37] on our behalf
[1:18:38] now notice as we look at this then we
[1:18:41] know that
[1:18:42] as he died on the cross paying
[1:18:44] redemption sins
[1:18:46] after he resurrects then his next work
[1:18:50] is his ascension now this
[1:18:53] is very important that we get this not
[1:18:56] only does god
[1:18:57] come down as a man but this man now
[1:19:00] must also meet death and defeat it
[1:19:03] meet hell and defeat it but he also
[1:19:06] must make a way back into heaven for man
[1:19:10] again
[1:19:12] are you with me amen because since the
[1:19:15] day
[1:19:16] in the garden of eden that sin was
[1:19:18] committed
[1:19:19] all heavens were shut off from mankind
[1:19:23] satan became the prince of the power of
[1:19:25] the atmospheres
[1:19:27] heaven became obscure and clouded over
[1:19:29] by darkness
[1:19:31] and that darkness then began to feel the
[1:19:34] atmosphere between
[1:19:36] god and man and and we became
[1:19:40] you know only held by sense-bound
[1:19:43] knowledge and and and uh
[1:19:46] that's how that we operate upon the
[1:19:48] earth and we
[1:19:49] lost that realm of being able to see
[1:19:52] clearly through the realm or the the
[1:19:55] sense of faith
[1:19:57] now no man could see up into glory
[1:20:00] no man could understand because it was
[1:20:02] just the power above us
[1:20:04] and heaven means the atmosphere was
[1:20:06] above and these powers were
[1:20:08] shut off from mankind because of sin
[1:20:11] and when heaven was shut off the the man
[1:20:14] man lost his position of authority
[1:20:18] that when man could no longer stand in
[1:20:20] god's presence
[1:20:21] because of his sins and then god came
[1:20:24] down
[1:20:25] as a man amen to
[1:20:28] true man as a man in order to make a
[1:20:32] way back for man to rule again
[1:20:35] as sons of god amen now jesus
[1:20:38] died buried and went to hell for us
[1:20:42] we have mentioned this before he was our
[1:20:44] scapegoat
[1:20:45] a man he was the one upon whom our sins
[1:20:48] and sickness
[1:20:49] the results of our sins was laid upon
[1:20:52] him
[1:20:53] in first peter 2 24 he says for
[1:20:56] whom his own self bear our sins
[1:21:00] in his own body on the tree that we
[1:21:04] being dead to sins should live unto
[1:21:08] righteousness
[1:21:09] by whose stripes you were healed
[1:21:13] amen so he was sent to hell in our place
[1:21:17] amen like the young goat kid let out
[1:21:21] and the sins of the nation play placed
[1:21:23] upon him
[1:21:24] and then abandoned in the wilderness
[1:21:27] left alone
[1:21:28] to be torn chased by every demon
[1:21:32] sickness and disease this is jesus
[1:21:35] as he descends into you know there and
[1:21:38] he meets
[1:21:39] meets death at calvary and on down into
[1:21:42] hell
[1:21:42] the the scapegoat torn by the beast
[1:21:46] let me just tell you jesus was our
[1:21:48] scapegoat
[1:21:49] every cancer diabetes
[1:21:53] tuberculosis asthma heart disease
[1:21:56] high blood pressure brain bleeds strokes
[1:22:00] affliction amen blind
[1:22:03] death dumb lyme's disease every beast
[1:22:07] of every kind bit at him and
[1:22:10] poured his flesh and he was wounded for
[1:22:13] our transgressions
[1:22:15] and he was bruised for our iniquities so
[1:22:18] that
[1:22:18] by these tribes we could be healed
[1:22:24] and let me tell you what he was healed
[1:22:26] of all of them that day he rose again
[1:22:32] without a shred of it he was
[1:22:36] he was there on that sunday morning
[1:22:39] after his time at trial was over there
[1:22:42] he became the mighty conqueror
[1:22:44] he not only raised his self up but he
[1:22:47] raised up all the sleeping dead of the
[1:22:49] old testament saints
[1:22:51] and they appeared to many he proved he
[1:22:53] was alive and
[1:22:54] triumphant over death and he showed the
[1:22:58] infallible proofs of his resurrection
[1:23:00] he appeared to his disciples he could
[1:23:03] show his scars
[1:23:04] up to to thomas and and and said
[1:23:08] you know you know put your hand in my
[1:23:10] side
[1:23:11] look here at my hands you know i'm not a
[1:23:14] ghost
[1:23:15] i can eat fish and honeycomb he can
[1:23:17] speak 153
[1:23:19] fish into existence and plus our bread
[1:23:21] and fish on the fire
[1:23:23] waiting by creation are you with me
[1:23:26] he could break bread with cleopas and
[1:23:30] his friends that emmaus the same jesus
[1:23:34] let me tell you the same jesus alive
[1:23:37] from the dead but now he's got to do
[1:23:40] something more than that here comes the
[1:23:44] greatest of all days when he ascends
[1:23:48] amen when he says as he said i am the
[1:23:50] way and i go to prepare a place for you
[1:23:53] and so he said he said see heaven have
[1:23:56] been blocked off to man
[1:23:58] by the prince of the power of the air
[1:24:00] the one who controls atmosphere
[1:24:02] and jesus must make a way
[1:24:05] amen for the rest of us to follow
[1:24:08] remember he was the logos that went out
[1:24:11] of god in the beginning
[1:24:12] he came down on the earth not to be made
[1:24:15] an angel
[1:24:16] he came down on the earth and took the
[1:24:17] form of a bondsman
[1:24:19] a servant not an angel he came down from
[1:24:22] the great glory
[1:24:23] the jehovah glory but he come down as a
[1:24:26] man
[1:24:27] to redeem man hallelujah that's why
[1:24:30] you know this is so pertinent down from
[1:24:32] his glory
[1:24:33] every living story my god my savior came
[1:24:37] the great i am became my savior
[1:24:41] and all god's filling his dwells in him
[1:24:44] the sin of man
[1:24:45] came upon him to pay the penalty of sin
[1:24:49] what did what did he do the bible said
[1:24:51] he was made
[1:24:52] a little lower than the angels in order
[1:24:55] for death that he might
[1:24:56] abolish him and take away sickness from
[1:25:00] the world
[1:25:00] he came from the highest from the logos
[1:25:03] of god
[1:25:04] he came down to angels condescending
[1:25:07] coming down
[1:25:08] was made a man until he can say i was
[1:25:10] not even a man i'm a worm and no man
[1:25:12] because i'm despised and rejected the
[1:25:15] lowest to the lowest
[1:25:16] he became the lowest of the lowest so he
[1:25:20] could come down on your level
[1:25:22] to cause you to come up to sonship
[1:25:26] amen to a place of dominion and power
[1:25:29] and authority are you with me now
[1:25:32] no never a man died like him never man
[1:25:36] could die like him never could a man
[1:25:39] ascend on high like him
[1:25:41] because he was god he made himself of no
[1:25:44] reputation
[1:25:46] you know the man that made the
[1:25:47] artificial eye made himself a reputation
[1:25:50] the man who made false teeth made
[1:25:52] himself a reputation
[1:25:54] the man who made a wooden arm made a
[1:25:56] reputation for himself
[1:25:58] the man who made the original eye
[1:26:01] are you with me the original arm made
[1:26:04] his have no repetition
[1:26:06] but became a servant a bondsman
[1:26:09] unto men who were sinners that he might
[1:26:12] win them back
[1:26:14] oh what matter of love hath the father
[1:26:18] for adam's fallen race that he would
[1:26:21] come down and descend
[1:26:22] and become one of us
[1:26:27] and to do so now in his ascension
[1:26:31] he would break through every veil
[1:26:33] brother branham says in the hebrew
[1:26:35] series
[1:26:35] he said the bible said he ascended on
[1:26:37] high and gave gifts to man
[1:26:40] there was an atmosphere hung over the
[1:26:42] earth of darkness of gloom of death and
[1:26:44] weary
[1:26:45] and the the that's worry and the the
[1:26:48] prayers couldn't come up because the
[1:26:50] atonement wasn't made
[1:26:52] but he broke through that veil and he
[1:26:54] opened up the way
[1:26:55] and he broke the veil of sickness he
[1:26:58] broke the veil of sin
[1:26:59] he broke the veil of worry he broke the
[1:27:02] veil of depressed he broke every veil
[1:27:05] and then he made a highway
[1:27:06] for the wayfaring man walking up the
[1:27:09] king's highway
[1:27:11] hallelujah he did it so we can rise up
[1:27:15] in the heavenly realms he made us alive
[1:27:18] in christ so he can
[1:27:19] raise us up to make us sin with him
[1:27:26] philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you
[1:27:31] which was also in christ jesus
[1:27:34] who being in the form of god thought it
[1:27:36] not robbery to be equal with god
[1:27:39] but made himself of no repetition he
[1:27:42] condescended in other words took upon
[1:27:44] him the form of a servant
[1:27:46] made in the likeness of man and being
[1:27:48] found as a man he humbled himself and
[1:27:50] became obedient unto death
[1:27:52] even to the death of the cross wherefore
[1:27:56] god had also also hath
[1:28:00] highly exalted him and given him a name
[1:28:03] that is above every name that at the
[1:28:06] name of jesus
[1:28:07] ever needs to bow of heaven of things in
[1:28:11] heaven of things on earth the things of
[1:28:12] the earth and that every
[1:28:14] tongue should confess that jesus christ
[1:28:17] is lord
[1:28:18] to the glory of god the father i say
[1:28:22] what a promise that is and what a word
[1:28:23] that is
[1:28:25] that every devil every cancer every
[1:28:28] affliction
[1:28:29] every disease every demon has to bow to
[1:28:33] the name of jesus
[1:28:35] amen get ready to get on your knees
[1:28:38] devil
[1:28:39] because you'll have to bow to the name
[1:28:42] of my lord
[1:28:44] amen he's no little lord he's king of
[1:28:47] kings
[1:28:47] and lord of lords you may be prince of
[1:28:50] this world
[1:28:51] but you're not king over my lord and
[1:28:54] neither are you my king or at that name
[1:28:57] at the mention of that name they bow
[1:28:59] they fall
[1:29:01] every demon has to bow to that name ever
[1:29:04] flicks and every sickness
[1:29:16] let's go to ephesians 1 20.
[1:29:19] he speaks of the working of his mighty
[1:29:21] power which he worked in christ
[1:29:24] when he raised him from the dead and
[1:29:26] what
[1:29:27] seated him at his own right hand in the
[1:29:31] heavenly places
[1:29:33] far above all principality and power and
[1:29:36] might and dominion and every name that
[1:29:38] is named
[1:29:39] not only in this age but also in that
[1:29:42] which is to come
[1:29:44] now let's look at this he said him
[1:29:48] look when he ascended he ascended to a
[1:29:52] place
[1:29:53] far above principalities
[1:29:56] for above power might dominion
[1:30:01] every name that is named this is where
[1:30:03] jesus
[1:30:04] sits at the as a place of preeminent
[1:30:08] authority are you with me now
[1:30:12] now far above everything else any name
[1:30:15] that is named
[1:30:16] now we know that spiritual things are
[1:30:19] just as real
[1:30:20] as physical things we know that
[1:30:22] spiritual things are
[1:30:24] superior to to uh
[1:30:27] to physical things because god is a
[1:30:30] spirit
[1:30:31] and and and as a spirit he created the
[1:30:34] physical things
[1:30:36] so the physical things are creation of
[1:30:39] the spiritual things
[1:30:41] so it's it's lesser isn't it amen so
[1:30:45] then the spiritual things are superior
[1:30:47] to physical
[1:30:48] we know that are you ready
[1:30:51] that greater is he that is in you
[1:30:56] than he that is in the world we know
[1:30:59] that
[1:31:00] greater is the one that is in us amen is
[1:31:03] the
[1:31:04] master this great one in us he is a
[1:31:06] master
[1:31:07] of sickness he is the master of diseases
[1:31:11] he is the master of weaknesses he is the
[1:31:16] master over
[1:31:17] sins do your sin be like scarlet
[1:31:21] can i tell the prodigal this morning
[1:31:24] thou your sins be like
[1:31:26] prodigal as the prodigal and like
[1:31:28] scarlet you shall be made white as snow
[1:31:31] don't let me read like crimson they'll
[1:31:33] be made
[1:31:34] white as wool as far as the east is from
[1:31:37] the west
[1:31:37] i'll remove your sins from you
[1:31:43] why jesus is greater than that sin
[1:31:47] he's greater you mentioned of name he's
[1:31:50] read his name is greater
[1:31:53] oh but you say but that was just for
[1:31:56] jesus right
[1:31:57] that dominion you talk about just for
[1:31:59] dominion well let's look at verse 22
[1:32:02] and he put all things under his feet and
[1:32:05] gave him to be head over all things to
[1:32:07] the church
[1:32:08] which is his body the fullness of him
[1:32:11] who feels all in all
[1:32:14] notice this he put all under his feet
[1:32:18] verse 2 he of chapter 2 verse 1 he says
[1:32:21] unto you
[1:32:23] he made alive who were dead in
[1:32:25] trespasses and sins
[1:32:27] in which you once walked according to
[1:32:29] the course of this world according to
[1:32:31] the prince of the power of the air
[1:32:32] the spirit which will not works in the
[1:32:35] sons of disobedience
[1:32:36] among whom also we once conducted
[1:32:38] ourselves in the lusts of our flesh
[1:32:41] fulfilling the desires of our flesh and
[1:32:43] of the mind and we're by nature the
[1:32:45] children are out
[1:32:46] just as others but god
[1:32:49] who is rich in mercy because of his
[1:32:52] great love
[1:32:54] which he had for us even when we were
[1:32:58] dead
[1:32:58] in trespasses have made us alive
[1:33:02] together
[1:33:03] with christ for by grace you are saved
[1:33:07] and has raised us up
[1:33:10] together and made us sick
[1:33:17] where in the heavenly places
[1:33:21] in christ jesus so now
[1:33:24] he made a way not just for him to be
[1:33:28] thrown but for us to be enthroned
[1:33:32] with him are you with me
[1:33:36] now as believers we are in the same
[1:33:39] seat of authority that jesus occupies
[1:33:44] we are with christ we are also in christ
[1:33:48] and this is a place i want to just
[1:33:50] declare it it is above every demon
[1:33:54] every fallen angel every evil spirit
[1:33:57] even lucifer himself amen just as adam
[1:34:01] was given dominion over
[1:34:03] every living creature in eden god has
[1:34:06] chosen us
[1:34:07] to give us his beloved children and this
[1:34:10] new creation how many beliefs are of a
[1:34:12] new creation
[1:34:13] amen he has given us a level of
[1:34:16] authority in the spirit realm
[1:34:18] let me say it again just as adam had
[1:34:21] control over nature
[1:34:23] come on god has given you control in the
[1:34:26] spirit realm
[1:34:29] amen and that that authority is above
[1:34:32] every created being
[1:34:38] hallelujah now brother madam tells us
[1:34:41] the greatest authority
[1:34:42] he said which is the greatest authority
[1:34:44] an angel from heaven or angel in the
[1:34:46] pulpit
[1:34:47] which is it said is the angel or the
[1:34:49] messenger in the pulpit
[1:34:51] paul said if an angel from heaven comes
[1:34:52] preach any other gospel
[1:34:54] to you than this which i've already
[1:34:55] preached let him be a curse so
[1:34:57] the angel anointed with the holy spirit
[1:34:59] when the word stands next to god
[1:35:01] into heaven his authority all powers in
[1:35:04] heaven and earth is given to my hand go
[1:35:06] and i'll go with you
[1:35:07] whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in
[1:35:11] heaven what you loose
[1:35:12] on earth i'll loosen heaven oh if the
[1:35:15] great holy church
[1:35:16] only realizes power to do these things
[1:35:19] but when there's so much doubt and fear
[1:35:22] and trembling
[1:35:23] wondering well could it happen as long
[1:35:26] as that exists
[1:35:27] the church can never stand upright and
[1:35:30] whenever
[1:35:31] talk of fear is vanished are you with me
[1:35:34] and the holy spirit is in complete
[1:35:36] control in the church
[1:35:38] then all fears are gone and the church
[1:35:41] has the power
[1:35:42] see why they have everything heaven owns
[1:35:44] behind them
[1:35:45] they're ambassadors of the throne
[1:35:48] absolutely an ambassador of christ
[1:35:50] has the authority and everything that
[1:35:52] christ owns belongs to that ambassador
[1:35:55] and he said go into all world and you be
[1:35:57] a witness
[1:35:58] after the holy ghost has come on you and
[1:36:01] what is a witness as an ambassador to
[1:36:03] come and witness something the
[1:36:04] whole powers of heaven is right in your
[1:36:07] hands he said oh
[1:36:08] why do we sit and the church is barren
[1:36:12] and we sit dormant because we don't
[1:36:15] recognize these things
[1:36:17] hallelujah we are positioned
[1:36:21] with him as sons of god without
[1:36:25] blemish with power
[1:36:28] and authority name the name
[1:36:32] hallelujah for you has he made alive
[1:36:36] who were dead in trespasses and sin and
[1:36:39] he hath raised you up
[1:36:41] together with him hallelujah and made us
[1:36:45] to sit together
[1:36:46] in heavenly places
[1:36:50] in christ jesus he puts you back in a
[1:36:53] position
[1:36:54] in heaven as a of sonship
[1:36:58] with power and authority over every
[1:37:00] devil now this is why he said in my
[1:37:03] name you're going to cast out amen
[1:37:06] you're gonna
[1:37:06] you're gonna do it because of what my
[1:37:09] name represents what i did at calvary
[1:37:11] so you are gonna do what you're gonna
[1:37:13] cast satan out
[1:37:15] now paul is showing us in these
[1:37:17] scriptures that jesus
[1:37:18] is sitting at the right hand of the
[1:37:20] father he's far above
[1:37:22] every evil spirit or demon or fallen
[1:37:25] angel
[1:37:26] or any other evil spiritual being that
[1:37:28] exists
[1:37:29] and remember we wrestle not against
[1:37:31] flesh and blood
[1:37:33] but against principalities and powers
[1:37:35] and spiritual wickedness and heavenly
[1:37:37] places
[1:37:38] right amen but he's showing us we're
[1:37:40] already above it
[1:37:42] if we are in a kingdom being seated
[1:37:45] listen to me
[1:37:46] being seated at the right hand of the
[1:37:49] king
[1:37:50] is the highest position that is
[1:37:52] available
[1:37:55] and this is where god has exalted his
[1:37:58] bride his church
[1:37:59] his wife too is to a place beside him
[1:38:04] come on read the lao to see an age and
[1:38:07] who gets to sit with him on the throne
[1:38:09] and i don't believe that just over there
[1:38:12] in the glory land
[1:38:13] i believe that's right now he has made
[1:38:16] us kings and priests
[1:38:17] [Applause]
[1:38:20] now sure it'll be in the glory land but
[1:38:23] this even right now
[1:38:25] surely be in the millennium but we right
[1:38:27] now have dominion
[1:38:29] over what over every unclean spirit
[1:38:33] over every lie of the devil amen
[1:38:36] and since this kingdom of god is the
[1:38:39] greatest kingdom how many believes
[1:38:40] it's the greatest kingdom how many
[1:38:42] believes it's greater than all kingdoms
[1:38:44] satan says i'm my kingdom i'll give to
[1:38:47] you do you believe it's greater than
[1:38:48] satan's kingdom amen the kingdom of god
[1:38:51] then is the greatest kingdom
[1:38:52] and since there is no authority in
[1:38:55] existence that is higher than god
[1:38:57] then we know that being seated at his
[1:38:59] right hand is to be in a place
[1:39:01] of unmatched authority
[1:39:04] amen his place of authority is shown as
[1:39:08] a man
[1:39:09] at the father's right hand
[1:39:13] jesus has absolute unconditional
[1:39:18] authority over all demons
[1:39:22] hallelujah over all the sickness all the
[1:39:24] problems that they can create
[1:39:27] christ sitting at the right hand of the
[1:39:30] father now
[1:39:31] how would you get this is a picture
[1:39:35] of rest
[1:39:39] now how different this is in the old
[1:39:41] testament
[1:39:43] you know jesus is the priest of the new
[1:39:44] testament he's the high priest
[1:39:47] and he does it from a sitting down
[1:39:49] position
[1:39:51] of a seat a throne
[1:39:54] but on the old covenant the priests
[1:39:57] were constantly working to cover sins
[1:40:01] trying to make things happen laboring
[1:40:05] bringing sacrifice after sacrifice and
[1:40:07] hew in the woods and bring
[1:40:08] the water and all the other things
[1:40:10] necessary for the sacrifice
[1:40:13] in the old testament the priests had to
[1:40:15] go in the temple
[1:40:16] you know and make these sacrifices
[1:40:19] because that's the way they receive
[1:40:20] forgiveness and
[1:40:21] it was all based off of works
[1:40:25] amen think of the tabernacle there's no
[1:40:27] chairs in the tabernacle
[1:40:29] there's no reason for seats the priests
[1:40:31] couldn't sit down
[1:40:33] no their work was never done they
[1:40:36] offered
[1:40:36] sacrifices for sins continually they
[1:40:39] lived under constant pressure for their
[1:40:42] work was never done
[1:40:44] oh we need some more wood now bring in
[1:40:46] some more water and here's another lamb
[1:40:48] and here's a
[1:40:50] man and you know they had to do this
[1:40:52] continually over and over and over and
[1:40:55] over again
[1:40:55] works works works works
[1:40:59] amen every day another sacrifice and
[1:41:02] then another sacrifice is required
[1:41:04] but when jesus offered himself
[1:41:08] as the lamb of god on the cross he said
[1:41:11] it
[1:41:11] is finished
[1:41:16] and he abolished the old way of having
[1:41:19] to constantly work for god's goodness
[1:41:25] he sat down on the right hand of the
[1:41:27] father him sitting there is a picture of
[1:41:30] rest
[1:41:31] under the old covenant they're still
[1:41:33] working working working under the new
[1:41:35] covenant
[1:41:36] jesus is sitting and resting
[1:41:39] i'm preaching i'm preaching on
[1:41:42] give my title again they never lost it
[1:41:46] i'm preaching on fighting yet seated
[1:41:52] about this in mind jesus
[1:41:55] is sitting contrary to the old testament
[1:41:59] work work work he is sitting
[1:42:02] and resting now paul said
[1:42:05] we are seated in heavenly places
[1:42:10] that means we got a place of rest too
[1:42:15] amen you don't have to go through life
[1:42:17] all worried
[1:42:18] upset tore up on the inside
[1:42:22] when you live seated i might know you're
[1:42:26] resting
[1:42:27] you don't have to go through life
[1:42:29] frustrated because
[1:42:31] you know you're trying to dot every eye
[1:42:33] right and
[1:42:34] cross every t no no you're
[1:42:37] you're sitting you're sitting in
[1:42:40] heavenly places
[1:42:42] you may have problems maybe you're
[1:42:44] struggling with
[1:42:46] illness perhaps you know the medical
[1:42:49] reports don't look good
[1:42:51] and you can stay worried but just
[1:42:54] instead you stay seated i hope you're
[1:42:58] getting the picture
[1:42:59] you can go around worried and upset but
[1:43:02] instead
[1:43:02] you know god's got you in the palm of
[1:43:04] his hands
[1:43:05] you know the number of your days he will
[1:43:08] fulfill
[1:43:09] that there's nothing that devil can do
[1:43:11] to take you away
[1:43:12] until god decrees your time is up on the
[1:43:15] earth
[1:43:16] amen amen david said although i'm
[1:43:20] surrounded by trouble
[1:43:21] my heart will know no fear because the
[1:43:23] lord will bring me safely through
[1:43:26] the the psalmist said it's a rapture
[1:43:29] scripture it's
[1:43:30] those who are going to rapture this is
[1:43:32] their scripture psalms 2701
[1:43:34] the lord is my light and he is my
[1:43:37] salvation
[1:43:38] brother jim you said well it's a time of
[1:43:40] you know it's been things are kind of
[1:43:42] dark the lord is my light though and he
[1:43:45] is my salvation
[1:43:47] whom shall i fear the lord is the
[1:43:49] strength of my life
[1:43:51] of whom shall i be afraid when the
[1:43:53] wicked even mine enemies my foes came
[1:43:56] upon me
[1:43:56] to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell
[1:44:01] i didn't fall they fell amen
[1:44:05] though an army a host should encounter
[1:44:07] against me
[1:44:08] my heart will not fear a mental war
[1:44:11] should rise against me
[1:44:13] if this will i be confident one thing i
[1:44:16] desired from the lord that will i seek
[1:44:18] after that i may dwell in the house of
[1:44:20] the lord
[1:44:21] in his presence all the days of my life
[1:44:24] and behold the beauty of the lord and
[1:44:25] inquiring his temple
[1:44:27] for in the time of trouble he will hide
[1:44:30] me in this pavilion
[1:44:32] amen and he shall set me up on a rock
[1:44:37] how many times did god's prophet tell us
[1:44:41] let off the pressure
[1:44:44] i think we need to just take a deep
[1:44:46] breath right now just
[1:44:50] i'm safe i'm sheltered
[1:44:54] i'm in this pavilion i can rest
[1:44:58] i can sit here
[1:45:01] perhaps i have a right to be worried
[1:45:05] and upset but i've come to realize
[1:45:08] that's why i'm in the pulpit this
[1:45:10] morning but i've come to realize
[1:45:12] the battle isn't mine
[1:45:16] amen the battle is the lord's so i'm
[1:45:19] going to rule from a position
[1:45:20] right beside him can i tell you where
[1:45:23] i'm at i'm resting
[1:45:25] and knowing he's in control he's got
[1:45:28] this
[1:45:30] but you see when you take over letting
[1:45:33] your worries
[1:45:34] dictate your feelings you are no longer
[1:45:37] allowing god to work anymore
[1:45:40] i want to remind you this battle is not
[1:45:43] yours it's the lords
[1:45:50] now yes timothy said in first timothy 6
[1:45:53] 12 fight the good fight of faith
[1:45:55] lay hold on eternal life but brother tim
[1:45:57] you've got to fight
[1:45:58] you've been preaching you've got to
[1:46:00] fight
[1:46:03] but do it from a position
[1:46:06] of rest sitting down with him
[1:46:10] and then don't let no nothing move you
[1:46:12] from that position
[1:46:14] now when you stand up you see you're
[1:46:16] trying trying to take over
[1:46:18] god just steps back as long as you fight
[1:46:21] he's gonna rest but when you step back
[1:46:24] and sit down you see what's happening
[1:46:28] in the heavens michael and his angels go
[1:46:30] to fighting for you
[1:46:32] but when you get in there and try to
[1:46:34] take over the battle
[1:46:36] and frustrated and worried and trying to
[1:46:38] fix everything
[1:46:39] god can't work but when you sit there on
[1:46:43] your throne
[1:46:44] and let the angels the servants that you
[1:46:46] command
[1:46:47] come on now that you command they're at
[1:46:50] your command
[1:46:51] amen jesus said i could call allegiance
[1:46:54] or legions of angels 12 legions of
[1:46:56] angels
[1:46:57] what is that about 182 000 angels
[1:47:01] when one angel could kill 200 000 with
[1:47:03] one blow

[1:47:08] hezekiah
[1:47:09] right everybody but don't let nothing
[1:47:12] move you from your position
[1:47:15] as long as you're fighting god god just
[1:47:18] stand back
[1:47:19] but when you step back and you sit down
[1:47:22] and you sat down on your throne
[1:47:24] angels go to working for you
[1:47:27] amen when you rest god works
[1:47:32] that's why he told the israelites be
[1:47:34] still and you'll see the deliverance of
[1:47:36] the lord
[1:47:38] remember that exodus 14 the lord shall
[1:47:40] fight
[1:47:41] for you and you will hold your peace

[1:54:16] peptic ulcer and then this
[1:54:18] and this worry is brought up on this and
[1:54:20] that and
[1:54:23] you see this is why many have health
[1:54:26] problems of
[1:54:27] high blood pressure and stomach problems
[1:54:30] they haven't learned to rest
[1:54:33] they're always fighting on the inside
[1:54:35] worried about your children

[1:55:05] how it's going to happen

[1:55:22] you must have been half asleep when you
[1:55:24] went to bed because he was grouchy and
[1:55:25] fussy then
[1:55:29] no wonder we got high blood pressure and
[1:55:31] diabetes and everything else he says
[1:55:34] look at a little robin he'll raise of a
[1:55:36] morning the first thing he throws his
[1:55:38] little face toward heaven goes to
[1:55:39] singing at the top of his voice
[1:55:42] you'll never seen any of them with high
[1:55:43] blood pressure walking on crutches and
[1:55:45] with diabetes
[1:55:47] i said a little robin sometime one time
[1:55:49] said wonder
[1:55:50] what's the matter these people these
[1:55:52] creatures that calls themselves human
[1:55:53] beings why
[1:55:54] they they're so sad maybe they hadn't
[1:55:56] got a heavenly father like we have
[1:55:59] that takes care of us now the scripture
[1:56:03] says be still and know
[1:56:06] that i'm god this lets us know if
[1:56:11] we're not still you really don't won't
[1:56:13] know he's god
[1:56:15] you see it's easy to let your mind
[1:56:17] wonder about what if
[1:56:20] don't think i don't think satan hadn't
[1:56:22] whispered in my ear
[1:56:24] what if you know wha what if
[1:56:28] what if my wife don't get well what what
[1:56:30] if
[1:56:31] we faced with things worse than that
[1:56:33] what if
[1:56:34] my health don't return you know what if
[1:56:37] the report isn't good oh what if
[1:56:40] my finances goes bad and what if
[1:56:44] just remember when you're working
[1:56:48] god can't work if you'll just take your
[1:56:49] position be seated with him
[1:56:51] he'll start working you know he's
[1:56:54] already got the solution
[1:56:56] brother wendell martin preached in the
[1:56:58] scripture that i just
[1:56:59] read of david in my own private
[1:57:01] devotions at zig lag
[1:57:04] and i believe it was god just confirming
[1:57:06] to me
[1:57:07] you know how david encouraged himself in
[1:57:10] the lord
[1:57:12] and the lord is god and he said you know
[1:57:14] and he asked of the lord what shall i do
[1:57:16] and he said
[1:57:16] pursue and you will recover all
[1:57:21] and david recovered his wife he
[1:57:23] recovered everything he lost
[1:57:25] he recovered the spoils beside enough to
[1:57:28] share with those who grew faith and were
[1:57:30] unable to fight
[1:57:32] and it dropped out along the journey he
[1:57:34] had enough broth back to share with
[1:57:36] everybody
[1:57:38] and i believe that we can have miracles
[1:57:40] that can happen
[1:57:41] come on what god restores all
[1:57:44] and even those who are faint and didn't
[1:57:46] have enough faith for a miracle
[1:57:48] and churches who didn't have enough
[1:57:49] faith for miracles can take heart
[1:57:52] and believe we'll get enough to share
[1:57:55] with the whole bride
[1:57:58] hallelujah we've shared about atlanta
[1:58:00] we've shared about such a caring we've
[1:58:02] shared about
[1:58:02] baby drew we've shared about brother we
[1:58:05] said about all these promises
[1:58:11] because god has given us abundance
[1:58:15] and we're going to recover all
[1:58:19] [Music]
[1:58:23] we're trying to figure everything out
[1:58:26] some
[1:58:27] solutions have no logical solution you
[1:58:29] have to turn your mind off
[1:58:33] you don't lean to your own understanding
[1:58:38] you trust in the lord
[1:58:41] you know it's okay to say god i don't
[1:58:43] see how this will work out i don't see
[1:58:46] i don't see a way but don't stop right
[1:58:48] there
[1:58:49] you know follow up with it but i know
[1:58:51] you have a way
[1:58:53] you knew the solution before i had the
[1:58:56] problem so i'm not going to worry i'm
[1:58:57] just going to
[1:58:58] live from a place of david said
[1:59:02] in psalms 110 in verse 1 the lord said
[1:59:05] to my lord sit at my right hand
[1:59:07] till i make your enemies your footstool
[1:59:10] a footstool is
[1:59:11] again something you put your feet on
[1:59:14] it's another picture of rest so come you
[1:59:17] know when you meet
[1:59:18] challenges you've got to come to a place
[1:59:20] of peace
[1:59:22] you know you have to do this by faith
[1:59:24] because the voice of the enemy will say
[1:59:26] nothing's going to work out you're not
[1:59:29] going to get well
[1:59:30] this is going to be worse than ever your
[1:59:32] child will never come right your
[1:59:34] marriage it'll never be fixed
[1:59:36] your family will never be restored
[1:59:38] there's just too much strife
[1:59:41] tell that to that couple right there
[1:59:44] they know better than that
[1:59:48] amen i believe god's going to give them
[1:59:50] even not just a restored marriage but
[1:59:53] abundance plus
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:56] hallelujah i'll tell you i'd hold my
[1:59:59] hands out
[1:59:59] my heart out for a blessing today amen
[2:00:02] the enemy is going to do everything he
[2:00:05] can though to get you up
[2:00:07] amen to get you to leave your seed of
[2:00:09] dominion
[2:00:10] he knows when you're seated and you're
[2:00:12] in peace and you're trusting god
[2:00:14] he don't stand a chance but when you're
[2:00:17] because when you live from a place of
[2:00:19] rest
[2:00:20] the forces of darkness can't stop you
[2:00:23] hallelujah remember this god
[2:00:26] has the final say
[2:00:32] and just like joseph said to his
[2:00:33] brethren what you meant for harm god's
[2:00:36] turned it for my good that he might
[2:00:38] exalt me
[2:00:40] and i'm saying that to satan today what
[2:00:42] you meant for my harm
[2:00:44] god's going to turn it for my good that
[2:00:46] he might exalt
[2:00:48] the power of god that is manifest in
[2:00:50] this bride
[2:00:53] but we don't fight our battles with
[2:00:54] human strength remember it's not
[2:00:56] a flesh and blood affair we're not
[2:00:58] fighting against
[2:01:00] you know against um flesh and blood but
[2:01:02] we're
[2:01:03] fighting against principalities and
[2:01:05] powers and rulers of darkness
[2:01:06] and heavenly places because you can't
[2:01:09] win the battle
[2:01:11] with your own human strength satan will
[2:01:14] defeat you
[2:01:16] it's not a flesh and blood battle like i
[2:01:18] said you do it from a place of rest
[2:01:21] and when you do it from a place of rest
[2:01:24] simply
[2:01:25] taking dominion over satan by trusting
[2:01:28] in god's ability
[2:01:29] that's when you truly overcome now i
[2:01:32] want you to look at hebrews 4 and verse
[2:01:34] 9 there remaineth there for a rest
[2:01:37] to the people of god for he that is
[2:01:40] entered into his rest
[2:01:42] he also has ceased from his own works
[2:01:45] as god did from his let us labor when a
[2:01:49] few times
[2:01:50] god tells us to work let us labor
[2:01:52] therefore to enter into that
[2:01:54] rest lest any man fall after the same
[2:01:58] example of unbelief
[2:02:00] so labor you know labor to rest sounds
[2:02:03] like
[2:02:04] a contradiction but it isn't god knew
[2:02:07] it was going to take work for you to
[2:02:09] stay in this seat
[2:02:12] of dominion and power you know and
[2:02:15] like i said it's easy it's easy to live
[2:02:18] worried and discouraged by
[2:02:19] problems and make it a flesh and blood
[2:02:22] affair
[2:02:22] trying to figure out how you're going to
[2:02:24] whip this
[2:02:26] how what am i going to do now i you know
[2:02:28] i'm going to try this now and
[2:02:30] my human ability my human efforts
[2:02:34] and satan does everything he can to
[2:02:36] bring you down from that heavenly
[2:02:38] position
[2:02:39] where you're seated with christ you know
[2:02:42] why
[2:02:42] because he can whip you when you fight
[2:02:47] as a flesh and blood affair
[2:02:52] you're not able to whip the devil
[2:02:55] with human strength
[2:02:58] it's going to be a battle for you to
[2:03:00] stay in your seat
[2:03:03] to stay in your position it's going to
[2:03:05] take effort you're going to have to work
[2:03:07] to stay in your place of authority amen
[2:03:10] you know not work to go straighten that
[2:03:13] kid out
[2:03:14] not work to try to devise some scheme or
[2:03:17] get rich scheme to
[2:03:18] get out of debt
[2:03:21] you know but work by staying in your
[2:03:24] seat
[2:03:25] by him in a position of power and
[2:03:28] authority
[2:03:29] lord i'm trusting in you
[2:03:33] i mean lead me guide me show me
[2:03:36] so we'll enter into his rest just like
[2:03:38] we fight the good fight of faith
[2:03:40] we take every thought cut them and make
[2:03:42] it obedient
[2:03:43] to jesus christ we cast down every
[2:03:46] imagination
[2:03:48] because you're going to have them when
[2:03:49] you're in battle you're going to have
[2:03:50] them
[2:03:52] he's the prince of atmospheres and he's
[2:03:54] going to make the atmospheres dark
[2:03:58] he's going to make it look impossible
[2:04:06] but when you allow your self to rest
[2:04:10] just quit worrying about how it's going
[2:04:12] to happen
[2:04:14] this allows you to be open where god can
[2:04:16] direct you
[2:04:17] but you can hear his voice because your
[2:04:19] own thoughts and a lot of it's not
[2:04:21] crowding out the voice of god
[2:04:24] a good example is this when jesus spoke
[2:04:26] to the victory he cursed it
[2:04:28] he walked on he didn't worry about
[2:04:30] whether he was going to drop and die
[2:04:32] he knew what he said would come to pass
[2:04:34] is that right
[2:04:35] he gave it no more thoughts amen he let
[2:04:38] the word
[2:04:39] somebody help me he let the word do its
[2:04:43] work
[2:04:44] [Applause]
[2:04:46] he just spoke from his seed of authority
[2:04:49] and let the word work
[2:04:53] and he says i'm not spoken of myself the
[2:04:56] father sent me
[2:04:57] he gave me a commandment what i should
[2:04:59] say and what i should speak
[2:05:01] is that right that's the way sons of god
[2:05:03] live
[2:05:04] the words that i speak to you are not of
[2:05:06] myself but the father dwelleth in me
[2:05:08] and he did the work the same father that
[2:05:10] dwelt in jesus dwells in you
[2:05:13] somebody helped me preach amen so you
[2:05:16] know that's what we got to do we got to
[2:05:18] walk in the god kind of faith we've got
[2:05:20] to stand where there's no
[2:05:22] doubt no fear no worry just rest
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:28] amen now again
[2:05:33] you have a choice i have a choice i have
[2:05:36] a choice to disbelieve or believe
[2:05:40] and i choose to believe i can i have a
[2:05:43] choose to doubt
[2:05:44] and fear and worry or i have a jew i
[2:05:47] have a choice
[2:05:48] to rest in god's promise amen faith is a
[2:05:52] choice
[2:05:57] and i choose to believe
[2:06:02] now you have to be determined you have
[2:06:05] to be disciplined
[2:06:07] but if there's a war going on the inside
[2:06:09] and you're worried and frustrated and
[2:06:10] upset within yourself impatient that the
[2:06:12] promise is carried
[2:06:13] remember sight and time are god's worst
[2:06:15] enemies
[2:06:17] when it comes to healing when you're
[2:06:18] trying to force things to happen
[2:06:20] in your own strength rather than letting
[2:06:23] the father within you
[2:06:25] do the work you're just not tapping into
[2:06:27] the grace of god that's available
[2:06:30] you're like the priest had to do
[2:06:31] sacrifices over and over again
[2:06:33] but you're under a new covenant you're
[2:06:36] to live under new covenant
[2:06:38] christ has already defeated every enemy
[2:06:42] amen the price has already been paid
[2:06:44] you're not working to get victory
[2:06:46] you are working from victory
[2:06:49] when you know you've already won there's
[2:06:51] a rest
[2:06:53] you see you don't live worried you don't
[2:06:54] lose sleep at night you were watering on
[2:06:56] your pillow trying to figure it out
[2:06:58] and like i said i refuse to weep
[2:07:01] even though sometimes i want to weep but
[2:07:03] we we weeping will weaken
[2:07:05] faith and rather than cry let's speak
[2:07:09] lord amen i choose rather than cry
[2:07:13] to speak and let's speak deliverance
[2:07:17] let's speak healing let's speak miracles
[2:07:21] let's speak restoration let's be victory
[2:07:24] let's speak joy let's be peace
[2:07:28] hallelujah let's speak the power of god
[2:07:32] under deliverance
[2:07:36] already know the outcome god said no
[2:07:39] weapon formed against me can prosper
[2:07:42] amen he will always cause me to triumph
[2:07:46] i know he said the thoughts i have of
[2:07:48] you they are
[2:07:49] peace and not of evil to bring you a
[2:07:51] hope and a future hallelujah when the
[2:07:54] doctors give no hope i have a hope
[2:07:57] when the doctors get no future i've got
[2:07:59] a future
[2:08:06] hallelujah
[2:08:08] now it may not turn out every time the
[2:08:11] way you wanted it or when you wanted it
[2:08:14] but god's ways are always better than
[2:08:16] our ways
[2:08:18] and that's what trust is all about
[2:08:22] when you live from a place of peace
[2:08:24] you'll not only enjoy life's blessings
[2:08:26] more but god
[2:08:27] will make happen what you couldn't make
[2:08:29] happen

[2:09:37] promised knowing that that no matter
[2:09:39] what the thing is or how it looks
[2:09:41] there's neither sickness sorry death
[2:09:43] there's neither starvation or anything
[2:09:45] that can separate us from the love of
[2:09:47] god
[2:09:48] we're at rest just let the old ship toss

[2:10:06] he was warned by a voice from god and
[2:10:09] saying
[2:10:10] a storm is coming
[2:10:13] and he told me brother tim the storm is
[2:10:15] coming
[2:10:16] i said awesome bring it on
[2:10:22] because i know i didn't leave on this
[2:10:26] journey
[2:10:27] without jesus in my boat
[2:10:28] [Applause]
[2:10:33] amen and it will only be an opportunity
[2:10:35] to see the
[2:10:36] jesus that's in me rise up
[2:10:40] to the occasion and rebuke devils in the
[2:10:43] storm
[2:10:45] and after i come to land there's a
[2:10:47] legion of devils to cast out into the
[2:10:49] pigs
[2:10:50] and there will be deliverance of god's
[2:10:52] children
[2:10:54] hallelujah

[2:11:07] amen bring on the storm the evening like
[2:11:10] tabernacle
[2:11:11] jesus is in this boat and we await jesus
[2:11:15] that's been asleep within us
[2:11:19] while we were telling testimonies and
[2:11:21] pressing doctrines and arguing this and
[2:11:23] that let jesus go to sleep and
[2:11:25] he'll rise in the power of his majesty
[2:11:29] and say
[2:11:29] to the storm peace be still
[2:11:32] [Applause]
[2:11:34] [Music]
[2:11:35] that's what i'm expecting amen
[2:11:40] now if some of you went off without
[2:11:43] jesus in your boat
[2:11:47] and you're in the storm it's the perfect
[2:11:51] opportunity for jesus to come up in this
[2:11:54] dorm
[2:11:56] and get in your boat
[2:11:57] [Applause]
[2:11:59] in the time of storms glorious things
[2:12:02] happen
[2:12:03] it's an opportunity to see the
[2:12:05] miraculous and see
[2:12:07] jesus walking on the water walking on
[2:12:10] your storms
[2:12:11] coming right to you to get in your boat
[2:12:15] and when he enters your boats the winds
[2:12:17] and away seas
[2:12:20] and that when you see him walking on the
[2:12:22] water
[2:12:24] it provokes faith to rise within his
[2:12:26] believing children
[2:12:28] to also walk on water
[2:12:35] hallelujah amen there it struck
[2:12:39] it'll strike out here again and again
[2:12:42] you're going to see the glory of god
[2:12:46] hallelujah the interval brother brandon
[2:12:49] said
[2:12:50] now i find what's in my most christian
[2:12:52] life most i hate to say that
[2:12:55] but it's true the most
[2:12:59] people that profess christianity they
[2:13:01] seem to have a
[2:13:02] hard time struggling to hold on
[2:13:06] i believe it's because of a lack of
[2:13:07] correct teaching of the bible
[2:13:10] this is why i'm teaching on this there's
[2:13:12] no such thing as holding on he done the
[2:13:14] whole
[2:13:15] on the whole christian principle is
[2:13:18] built upon rest come unto me
[2:13:19] all that you that labor and heavy laden
[2:13:22] i will give you rest
[2:13:23] don't have to worry and struggle you're
[2:13:25] just resting that's all given rest
[2:13:27] you enter you enter peace that's the
[2:13:29] whole thing's finished
[2:13:31] then he's called he's justified those he
[2:13:33] justified he's glorified
[2:13:36] amen and the inspiration brother branham
[2:13:39] tells
[2:13:40] again about talking to his wife he said
[2:13:42] the whole christian principle based upon
[2:13:44] rest
[2:13:45] i was burning my heart about resting i
[2:13:47] said why are we trouble
[2:13:49] let not your hearts be troubled he said
[2:13:52] we are just resting come come to me and
[2:13:55] you shall find rest
[2:13:57] take my yoke upon you learn to me find
[2:13:59] and rest
[2:14:00] i said when you come to christ once
[2:14:02] believe him once accept him
[2:14:04] enter into the rest and then all things
[2:14:07] of the world will just
[2:14:08] seem to die away you've got to rest then
[2:14:11] rest your soul and you enter in that
[2:14:13] state and there you are you're resting
[2:14:15] in with christ
[2:14:17] he again brings us out and just bring it
[2:14:19] because there's some nuggets and all of
[2:14:20] the christian experiences based solemnly
[2:14:23] and wholly upon rest
[2:14:26] come unto me all you that labor heavy
[2:14:27] laden i'll give you rest we're tossed
[2:14:29] about with everything
[2:14:30] until you come to christ then it's all
[2:14:32] finished
[2:14:35] resting in christ perfectly no matter
[2:14:36] what comes or goes
[2:14:38] nothing can touch us without it comes
[2:14:41] over the shepherd
[2:14:42] he has to permit it and he said all
[2:14:46] things work together for the good of
[2:14:47] them that love god
[2:14:49] and he has to come over the shepherd
[2:14:51] first said i'm the door no man can come
[2:14:53] in without me accepting it let me tell
[2:14:55] you when god permits anything
[2:14:57] it's working out to your good so would
[2:15:00] sickness be the same thing
[2:15:02] certainly that god might heal you to
[2:15:04] show a great testimony and give you a
[2:15:06] little something to move on for
[2:15:09] all things work together for good notice
[2:15:12] how beautiful this shepherd laid himself
[2:15:14] at the door
[2:15:15] to be the go-between or the block
[2:15:19] i thought then in my text of job when
[2:15:21] job tested and tried
[2:15:22] how that he knew he was righteous
[2:15:24] because he had offered the sacrifice
[2:15:26] the burnt offering stood firm he stood
[2:15:28] firm of it no matter
[2:15:30] how much his church members said job
[2:15:32] you're wrong your secret sinner
[2:15:34] job knew he had confessed his sins and
[2:15:37] had offered god the appropriate
[2:15:39] offer the one that god had required the
[2:15:41] burnt sacrifice he knew he was righteous
[2:15:43] in god's sight oh if christians who now
[2:15:47] will fall away and run back or run out
[2:15:49] or run in and run out
[2:15:50] and then you think well i can't make it
[2:15:52] you could make it in the first place
[2:15:55] it ain't your place to make it god's
[2:15:57] already made it for you in christ
[2:16:00] the price is fully paid the only thing
[2:16:02] you have to do is accept
[2:16:03] god's provided way and stand on it now
[2:16:06] no matter what takes place
[2:16:08] don't move rest the shepherd's watching
[2:16:11] over his sheep he knows the sparrow
[2:16:14] how much does he know about you remember
[2:16:16] the story of paul rayder
[2:16:18] where brother branham would try to give
[2:16:20] that illustration so many times
[2:16:22] of where that his boss told him as he
[2:16:25] was actually dying with
[2:16:27] with black water fever and had a hot
[2:16:29] fever and delirium and whatever and he
[2:16:31] dreamed
[2:16:32] that he was out trying to you know as a
[2:16:35] woodsman trying to cut down a big log
[2:16:39] he said you know i would cut it down and
[2:16:43] i limbed it and i got its size and
[2:16:46] everything and
[2:16:47] i tried to pick it up and carry it to
[2:16:49] camp where it was to go and
[2:16:51] it was just too big it was too big i
[2:16:54] couldn't pick it up i couldn't budget
[2:16:55] and
[2:16:56] i was struggling and i was struggling
[2:16:58] and trying and i would lift and try and
[2:17:01] roll it and this i couldn't do it
[2:17:04] and he said then i then i heard a voice
[2:17:07] say paul
[2:17:08] what are you doing and he said i saw it
[2:17:10] was the lord
[2:17:11] and he said he and he said i
[2:17:15] i'm trying to get this log down to camp
[2:17:18] and
[2:17:19] i can't do it and he said well paul
[2:17:23] you're trying on your own i want you to
[2:17:26] just
[2:17:26] roll that thing over into
[2:17:30] the water there into the string and then
[2:17:33] what you do is get on that log and
[2:17:35] write it to the count and paul reader
[2:17:38] got on that
[2:17:39] log he said in that in that dream and he
[2:17:42] said he went
[2:17:43] riding down that river screaming i'm
[2:17:46] riding on it
[2:17:47] i'm riding on it i'm riding on it until
[2:17:50] he came to the camp
[2:17:52] we're struggling we're trying to move
[2:17:54] something we're trying to make this
[2:17:56] happen
[2:17:56] we're trying to make this work we're
[2:17:58] struggling with it ourselves
[2:18:00] and god said roll it over into the river
[2:18:04] of the holy ghost
[2:18:05] get on it and ride on it ride on it
[2:18:08] rest don't work at it no more rest
[2:18:14] [Music]
[2:18:16] he said i'll never leave you or forsake
[2:18:19] you i'll be with you in there to the end
[2:18:21] of the world
[2:18:22] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[2:18:25] and forever
[2:18:29] hallelujah why don't we ride on that
[2:18:32] promise
[2:18:33] knowing where we stand in this day and
[2:18:35] hour
[2:18:36] hallelujah we're seated in heavenly
[2:18:39] places
[2:18:40] in christ jesus put your foot up
[2:18:44] hey man put your foot on a foot stool
[2:18:47] until he makes every enemy your
[2:18:49] footstool
[2:18:51] come on look over here the heavens is
[2:18:53] working on your behalf
[2:18:56] michael and his angels fell amen
[2:18:59] hallelujah daniel was there praying for
[2:19:02] revelation
[2:19:03] and michael and gabriel fight against
[2:19:05] the prince of persia
[2:19:06] and brought to them the revelation
[2:19:09] you're struggling you're weary you're
[2:19:12] you're trying you're
[2:19:13] working hard start resting put your mind
[2:19:17] your agrees
[2:19:18] quit trying to figure it out quit
[2:19:20] leaning to your own understanding
[2:19:22] it ain't even a logical answer
[2:19:26] atlanta yours your healing was not a
[2:19:28] logical
[2:19:29] healing was not a logical answer
[2:19:34] hey man even when she was told i found
[2:19:36] nothing it took a moment to digest it
[2:19:38] all
[2:19:39] it wasn't logical come on
[2:19:43] it defied logic there one moment
[2:19:47] gone the next it was medicine doctor
[2:19:49] said medicine would have killed you
[2:19:53] madison wasn't going to heal her it was
[2:19:54] going to kill her
[2:19:56] amen he knew it
[2:20:01] maybe extend her life a little longer
[2:20:04] maybe just a little bit but she would
[2:20:07] die from the medicine before she would
[2:20:08] to cancer
[2:20:12] god have mercy defied logic
[2:20:16] it defied logic to get up out of their
[2:20:19] seat
[2:20:20] and rejoice running around this building
[2:20:23] shouting it divided logic for me to
[2:20:26] declare
[2:20:27] her enemy was dead
[2:20:31] amen in the bible object for me at the
[2:20:34] same time to lay my hands
[2:20:36] and pray here at this pulpit over a
[2:20:38] prayer cloth and send it over to south
[2:20:40] africa
[2:20:41] to a little brother there whose wife was
[2:20:44] in the third stages of rectal cancer
[2:20:47] and he hadn't had a job in two years and
[2:20:49] couldn't find work
[2:20:50] and was in a desperate situation and he
[2:20:53] gets the prayer cloth his wife is healed
[2:20:55] and gets a job
[2:20:56] what is it god restored all
[2:21:00] it wasn't logical when the doctor said
[2:21:02] are you with me
[2:21:03] hey man that that your sister mariah
[2:21:06] would never grow hair
[2:21:07] it was a autoimmune disease and she'd
[2:21:09] never get over it
[2:21:11] wasn't logical then to believe for
[2:21:14] healing but we believed despite logic
[2:21:16] and one logic to bring three pins in her
[2:21:19] hand
[2:21:20] and say i'm going to believe the word of
[2:21:22] promise i want to wear these come on
[2:21:24] it wasn't logic amen in divine
[2:21:28] logic but she was looking to the unseen
[2:21:31] to a promise of god
[2:21:33] amen and the same god defied everything
[2:21:37] of logic
[2:21:38] and put hair back on her head and it's
[2:21:40] still there to that day
[2:21:42] it wasn't logic five years ago when my
[2:21:45] wife lay with the brain bleed
[2:21:47] and was unable to dress herself and
[2:21:49] bathe herself at sitting in the bed
[2:21:51] and couldn't see on her side there
[2:21:54] peripheral vision was gone
[2:21:56] it wasn't logic for her to turn up and
[2:21:59] raise her hand and begin to worship god
[2:22:01] and at that moment the angel of god come
[2:22:03] sweeping over her bed
[2:22:05] and a little baby who never would have
[2:22:07] walked
[2:22:08] and couldn't pull up 18 months of years
[2:22:11] old
[2:22:11] got up and ran around my house while
[2:22:13] beason returned to her eyes
[2:22:15] that divine logic
[2:22:21] hallelujah but when karen started
[2:22:23] resting
[2:22:24] god's standing working when she started
[2:22:26] praising
[2:22:27] heaven started moving i'll tell you it's
[2:22:29] time that we
[2:22:30] oh don't you come down with me some
[2:22:32] gloomy spirit
[2:22:34] don't you have a pity party for me i
[2:22:36] don't want a pity party
