[26:23] father we're so thankful that you are
[26:25] need supplier you're our God and you're
[26:27] our Savior father you are everything in
[26:31] God where would we be without you Lord

[26:36] among us and touching us healing us
[26:39] delivering us Lord setting us free from
[26:43] every vile thing of this world Lord what
[26:46] oh what a wonderful Savior father today
[26:49] we just want to ask you to come and move
[26:51] in our hearts our lives come and speak
[26:53] to us once again father Lord if there be
[26:56] something in our hearts Lord that's not
[26:58] right God may you just somehow by your
[27:01] mercy and grace Lord just convict us of
[27:03] the Lord
[27:04] lord help us to repent Lord and make it
[27:07] right God we commit our hearts to you
[27:09] everything father for your glory and for
[27:11] your honor in Jesus name hey man you
[27:16] turn in your Bibles to Ephesians chapter
[27:18] 6 a man and also Hebrews an eye on it's
[27:26] good to be in the house the Lord
[27:27] a man Ephesians 6:13 says wherefore take
[27:33] unto you the whole armour of God that
[27:35] you may be able to withstand in the evil
[27:38] day and having done all to stand stand
[27:42] therefore also Hebrews 9 24 said for
[27:47] Christ is not entered into the holy
[27:49] place made with hands which are the
[27:52] figures of the true but unto heaven
[27:54] itself now to appear in the presence of
[27:57] God for us nor yet that he should offer
[28:00] himself often as a high priest in Earth
[28:03] in the holy place every year with blood
[28:06] of others
[28:07] for then must he often have suffered
[28:10] since the foundation of the world but
[28:13] now once in the end of the world hath he
[28:15] appeared to put away sin by the
[28:18] sacrifice of himself and as it is
[28:21] appointed unto men once to die but after
[28:23] this the judgment so Christ has once
[28:27] offered to bear the sins of many and
[28:30] unto them that look for him shall he
[28:34] appear the second time without sin unto
[28:37] salvation well look at that again and
[28:40] unto them that look for him shall he
[28:44] appear amen we'll let you be seated I
[28:51] don't think that we would we could all I
[28:56] mean I believe we all could agree that
[28:59] we live and we're living in the evil day
[29:01] evil time man's mind is on evil
[29:04] continually
[29:04] and seemingly going further and further
[29:08] towards evil as they get further and
[29:10] further away from God but I believe that
[29:13] as we read in the scripture there's a
[29:15] people that's able to stand in the most
[29:18] evil day as he said here in the
[29:21] scripture he said that ye may be able to
[29:23] withstand in the evil day and having
[29:26] done all to stand stand therefore I
[29:30] believe there's a people in turn up
[29:31] regardless of what you see all the bad
[29:33] news and all the things there's plenty
[29:35] of that's out there but there's a people
[29:37] on earth that are standing there's a
[29:39] people on earth that are standing for
[29:41] righteousness they're standing for
[29:43] holiness they're standing for the
[29:45] supernatural God to move among them
[29:48] they're standing for the kingdom of God
[29:50] and there's a people on this earth as
[29:52] able to take the pressures of this age
[29:55] because they have been pressurized for
[29:58] this age and I like to speak to you that
[30:00] again on pressure pressure eyes and
[30:02] realizing that's all that's going on in
[30:04] the world and and I believe there's a
[30:06] people here that really realizes that
[30:08] all this going on there in the world is
[30:11] just setting the scene for they're going
[30:14] away
[30:15] amen and that's what this is all about
[30:17] this is a setting the scene for your
[30:20] going away or your catching away as a
[30:23] thief would come in the night amen you
[30:25] know looking at this word pressurized it
[30:27] means to be brought to or be maintained
[30:30] and an atmospheric pressure higher than
[30:34] that of the surroundings or greater than
[30:37] that of the surroundings in other words
[30:40] there's a power greater or higher than
[30:43] the power that's on the outside a power
[30:46] a power higher or greater than that of
[30:49] its surroundings you know I've gotten a
[30:51] jet plane now I know there's many here
[30:53] there's I've been in a plane and you get
[30:55] up and you fly overseas especially and
[30:57] they got you know they've got it now do
[30:59] I remember as a kid they didn't have
[31:01] this but and you know has technology has
[31:05] progressed now you get in a plane you
[31:07] got your own little screen you can watch
[31:09] whatever you want to you can game
[31:10] whatever you want to I mean there's all
[31:12] kind of options out there but they have
[31:13] a map that you can watch and you can
[31:16] watch where the plane is and and on that
[31:18] map it'll tell you the temperature of
[31:20] the on the outside the altitude all
[31:23] those sayings and you get up at a
[31:24] certain place and you begin to realize
[31:25] it's not very pleasant on the outside
[31:28] you may be sitting in a short sleeve
[31:30] shirt and you may be comfortable as you
[31:32] can be you know squeezed together in
[31:34] that little seat but on the outside it
[31:36] can be somewhere around 65 below zero
[31:39] and but at that plane has been built in
[31:42] such a way to withstand the pressure of
[31:44] all the things that's going on around it
[31:46] and it has been pressurized so that the
[31:49] inside can keep its ability to be
[31:51] comfortable to have a comfortable
[31:54] temperature to be able to relax as much
[31:56] as possible and on the outside it can be
[31:58] cold it can be all kind of things storms
[32:01] lightnings and all that thing around
[32:03] there happening but there's on the
[32:04] inside of that plane it has been
[32:06] pressurized for that atmosphere or for
[32:09] that place and it shows that what's on
[32:12] the inside is greater because unless
[32:14] there's something that cracks or
[32:15] something that malfunctions in that
[32:17] plane and thank God I've never had that
[32:18] happen while I've been in the plane you
[32:20] know they give you all the rundown of
[32:21] what you're supposed to do and out of
[32:23] the roofs supposed to come some cups and
[32:25] you stick it over your face and breathe
[32:26] naturally and normally I don't know how
[32:28] many by
[32:29] can do that in that kind of situation
[32:30] but anyway if that happens I don't know
[32:33] how I would react but I've never been
[32:35] there but apparently that is there but
[32:37] you know that plane is built to
[32:39] withstand things that and then and can
[32:42] go to those places and be in those
[32:44] places and while on the outside it is
[32:46] uncomfortable it's freezing it's
[32:49] whatever on the outside but on the
[32:51] inside there's a prayers of pressured
[32:53] cabin and it's been pressurized to
[32:55] withstand to where that things on the
[32:57] outside cannot get to the inside and I
[33:00] believe that there's a people upon this
[33:02] earth that has been pressurized and been
[33:04] pressurized by the seal of the Holy
[33:06] Ghost now this this seal you don't have
[33:08] to worry about it blowing apart or
[33:10] breaking apart or falling apart and the
[33:12] time of chaos and the time of trouble or
[33:15] if it's cold outside hot outside this
[33:17] seal will hold this Holy Ghost gospel
[33:20] this Holy Ghost pressure pressure rises
[33:23] about a body of believers to a place
[33:25] that no matter what's going on the
[33:27] outside what's taking place on the
[33:29] outside whether hail has come to earth
[33:32] or whether whatever is going on this on
[33:34] the inside is pressurized for what for
[33:37] this and getting able to take it now we
[33:39] know that also as astronauts as we begin
[33:42] to lift off the earth they also are in a
[33:44] pressurized capsule and they have
[33:46] pressurized suits they're they're
[33:48] gearing up and they're becoming a men
[33:51] geared up to be able to withstand where
[33:53] they're going or to be able to take
[33:54] where they're going and you know Anna as
[33:56] we spoke about this here the last time
[33:58] on a couple Wednesday's ago that as
[34:01] they're sitting on top of that capsule
[34:03] in there and the time is counting down
[34:05] to they're going away they're there
[34:08] looking to where they're going they're
[34:10] sitting there looking up into the
[34:12] heavens because that's where they're
[34:13] going they're not looking and you know
[34:15] if they're sitting on that coaster out
[34:16] there on the Florida coast they're not
[34:19] looking back over at New York are not
[34:20] looking to Louisiana or toward the west
[34:23] they're looking up a ma'am because that
[34:25] is where they're going they're not
[34:26] planning on going to Louisiana or going
[34:29] to the other coast or going to the other
[34:30] side of the world they're planning on
[34:32] leaving this atmosphere and going into
[34:35] another atmosphere they're looking at
[34:37] where they're going amen God has also
[34:40] has a stir
[34:41] and they have their eyes trained on
[34:44] where they're going a man if you're
[34:46] planning on going to hell just keep
[34:48] looking at hell if you're planning on
[34:50] staying here on earth just keep looking
[34:51] at this earth but you're planning on
[34:53] leaving this world you better train your
[34:55] eyes to look to another dimension to
[34:58] look to where you're going because you
[35:00] know even NaturallySpeaking uses human
[35:02] eyes you're generally looking to where
[35:04] you're going if you're walking this way
[35:07] you better be looking where you're going
[35:09] you know you see people that ain't you
[35:10] see videos of people that not looking
[35:12] where they're going they're looking at
[35:13] their phone or they're talking to
[35:15] somebody and they got their head they're
[35:16] distracted and they hit themselves
[35:17] upside the head with a pole they walk
[35:19] right into it because why they're not
[35:21] looking where they're going but I
[35:23] believe there's a people with their eyes
[35:25] fixed on another dimension they're not
[35:28] concerned so much with what's going on
[35:30] around them remember but they're moving
[35:33] and they're moving towards that other
[35:35] dimension as that dimension is blending
[35:37] into this dimension there's also a
[35:39] people that's ready to take that step
[35:41] into that other dimension you know what
[35:43] I also looking at this it was very
[35:45] interesting that as there's also
[35:47] astronauts or circling the Earth they're
[35:49] going at a greater speed than what this
[35:51] earth is going at they're going at
[35:53] somewhere around 17,000 200 miles an
[35:56] hour that's a great speed I haven't
[35:57] never been that fast don't ever plan to
[35:59] go in that fast as far as
[36:00] NaturallySpeaking but in going that fast
[36:02] they see about sixteen to seventeen or
[36:05] so sunrises and sunsets a day you know
[36:08] and they're moving around there they're
[36:09] not looking at Earth and seeing all the
[36:11] problems on earth they can't see all the
[36:14] problems on earth they can't see the
[36:16] things that are going on they have been
[36:18] lifted up into another dimension to
[36:20] another atmosphere they're moving at a
[36:22] faster rate or faster speed and brother
[36:25] branham will talk about that other
[36:26] dimension and move this here it says but
[36:28] it's moving just a little faster than we
[36:31] are
[36:32] hallelujah and let me tell you Church if
[36:34] you're looking at the church problems
[36:36] and you're looking at situation around
[36:37] you you're looking at family problems
[36:40] you're looking at sicknesses you're
[36:41] looking at this you're not moving fast
[36:43] enough he meant it's time that we begin
[36:46] to move in another atmosphere we operate
[36:48] in another atmosphere with more
[36:50] sincerity about us and longing
[36:53] looking to where we want to go a man
[36:55] brother branham would use this and look
[36:57] he would say look like going down the
[36:59] road sometimes maybe certain scene will
[37:01] come and somebody to say looked just
[37:04] like right now look at that organ look
[37:07] at that organ see you did it
[37:09] automatically the word look causes you
[37:12] many of you some of your stubbornly just
[37:14] looking this way but if many of you it
[37:16] kind of makes you want to look what I'm
[37:18] talking about because this is a voice
[37:22] that spoke and it told you there's
[37:24] something to look at
[37:25] and there's many voices that are
[37:27] speaking in this day and they're saying
[37:29] look at this and look at this and look
[37:31] at this and look at this in their eyes
[37:33] if we're not careful we're look at all
[37:35] kinds of things and get caught up in it
[37:37] but there is a greater voice there is a
[37:40] voice speaking in this day and it's
[37:42] saying don't look at what's going on
[37:44] around here look beyond those things
[37:46] there's something greater there's
[37:48] something is going on all of what's
[37:50] going on around you it's only setting up
[37:53] the atmosphere are they climate for
[37:55] you're leaving here but see everybody's
[37:59] looking everybody's looking for
[38:01] something they're looking for something
[38:03] to happen you know the world is
[38:05] constantly looking there they're looking
[38:07] for radar on their radars or whatever
[38:09] they got nowadays screens around the
[38:11] world every nation you know trying to
[38:13] keep their defenses up you know trying
[38:15] to keep their eye on the sky looking for
[38:17] somebody to push the button to send a
[38:19] nuclear weapon look look everyone is
[38:21] looking but there is some people on this
[38:24] earth that is also looking there is a
[38:27] bride that is looking for the coming of
[38:30] her Lord and he said unto those that are
[38:34] looking for my appearance will I appear
[38:37] to them hallelujah Amen we're all
[38:40] looking but it depends on what voice
[38:43] we're listening to some of us are saying
[38:46] look for this and look for that he said
[38:49] but what is happening to the world
[38:51] they're going on in their blindness and
[38:53] they're getting blinder and more
[38:56] or all the time as it was in the days of
[39:00] Noah people were blind they couldn't see
[39:04] what was going on all the things that
[39:06] were going on in this day he said but we
[39:09] who look for Christ the second time it
[39:12] is an inside of his soon coming when we
[39:16] see the days as it was in the days of
[39:18] Noah or we see the day as it were in the
[39:22] days of lot and it vexes our soul and it
[39:25] hurts us to see the world go in the way
[39:27] that it's going and the things that are
[39:29] going the way that they're happening
[39:30] hurts a man it hurts it you don't want
[39:35] to see it get this way but it's prophecy
[39:37] we can't stop it
[39:39] governments can't stop it they came put
[39:41] enough laws and regulation out there to
[39:44] stop it it's heading down this track why
[39:46] because prophecy has said it to be so
[39:49] amen and it said that it was going to be
[39:52] the climate that is going to be on there
[39:54] as it was in the days of Noah as it was
[39:56] in the days of lot what is it is nothing
[39:59] but an in sign to look at he's coming we
[40:04] see something is about to happen but it
[40:07] depends on what you're looking at what
[40:10] you'll see no one new by the Word of God
[40:13] that was coming to flood but by faith he
[40:15] saw it and he knew that it was going to
[40:18] be because God word promised it either
[40:20] we believe this word that we don't
[40:22] believe this word hey man but the world
[40:26] could not see it because it didn't line
[40:29] up to their beliefs it didn't line up to
[40:31] what they thought it didn't line up to
[40:34] their political ideas they didn't line
[40:36] up to how they wanted you to be then it
[40:38] didn't line up to them and they found
[40:40] themselves and in water over their heads
[40:44] they found themselves destroyed because
[40:47] they could not see what Noah saw and it
[40:50] wasn't a popular message what Noah saw
[40:52] neither is this a popular message it
[40:55] wasn't a popular message what Noah was
[40:57] preaching it's going to rain it's going
[40:59] to come you better get in this heart why
[41:00] are you building this heart why are you
[41:02] doing all this because I've seen another
[41:04] vision I'm saying God has come and
[41:06] revealed something to my heart
[41:08] I'm putting one more nail in I'm cutting
[41:11] another board I'm going right along
[41:13] according to what God's Word says what
[41:16] you living the way you're living why
[41:18] you'd believe the way you believe
[41:19] because I've caught another vision it's
[41:22] not the vision of this world and what
[41:24] the devil wants you to believe in to see
[41:26] I caught a vision from another realm and
[41:29] there's also people here on this earth
[41:31] that's also caught that vision there is
[41:36] a people that's caught a vision they
[41:38] caught a vision of a destruction and
[41:40] there get into the structure as hard as
[41:43] they can go but there's also another
[41:45] people that's called a vision of leaving
[41:47] here hallelujah but Noah kept his eyes
[41:53] on that word the church the bride that
[41:55] called out knows that the coming of the
[41:59] Lord is at hand regardless how much the
[42:03] world is progressed and and we've been
[42:05] succeeded in and opening up things in
[42:08] the physical realm and scientifically
[42:10] speaking
[42:11] amen going to the moon it that means
[42:13] nothing to the believer only a sign that
[42:16] the coming of the Lord is at hand we see
[42:20] nations breaking we see nations falling
[42:23] apart we see the world being pulled
[42:25] apart the church move is coming apart
[42:28] and we're taught that when we receive a
[42:30] kingdom that cannot be moved well as
[42:32] these things begin to happen the church
[42:34] itself the bride together tighter
[42:37] binding itself tighter and tighter and
[42:40] tighter to the Word of God it's a great
[42:43] day we're living in Oh hallelujah it's
[42:48] an evil day but it's a great day
[42:55] everybody's looking for something you
[42:58] might already be looking past this
[43:00] service already looking for to know
[43:02] what's happening tomorrow or what you're
[43:04] going to do when you get home what I got
[43:05] to do tomorrow might be something
[43:07] another next week you got you're already
[43:09] looking to and then that's our problem
[43:11] we keep our eyes on other things we're
[43:13] looking for this thing to happen or this
[43:15] neighbor to come over or this friend to
[43:17] come or that to happen everybody's
[43:19] looking for something but as a group
[43:22] believers tonight assemble together
[43:24] let's fix our thoughts and our
[43:27] principles and our heart upon the coming
[43:30] of the Lord hallelujah looking for
[43:35] Christ who shall appear the second time
[43:37] without sin unto salvation to those that
[43:41] are believe and that are looking for him
[43:43] to come but the devil is constantly
[43:47] trying to get our eyes on what other
[43:49] things are going on and sicknesses that
[43:51] we got in this coronavirus over here and
[43:53] that over here and this problem over
[43:55] here and this world problem issues and
[43:57] this and in your mind just about ready
[44:00] to go explode what is it we get out of
[44:05] focus we'll get our eyes off on what's
[44:08] really important it's the devil's job to
[44:11] get your eyes off the coming of the Lord
[44:14] that's what's important I know people
[44:16] don't believe in it they don't some
[44:18] people don't believe in the coming of
[44:19] the Lord but I believe in it I believe
[44:21] in the rapture of the church I believe
[44:23] that there's a going away I believe
[44:25] there's a people here that's been judged
[44:27] by the word and the Word of God has
[44:29] placed upon a robe of righteousness the
[44:31] seal of the Holy Ghost upon their lives
[44:33] adopted sons and daughters of God that
[44:36] are not going into judgment but they're
[44:38] going into a rapture they're leaving
[44:41] this whole world this world is going
[44:43] into judgment but if you want to go go
[44:45] with them I'm not going I'm looking unto
[44:49] Jesus brother Branham talks about a
[44:53] camera he had brother Billy Billy Paul's
[44:56] a young boy and had taken pictures and
[44:58] he can to his dad said take that picture
[45:00] out there's a beautiful swirl crack
[45:02] cactus and it just look at that
[45:03] incredible he said so I threw up the
[45:06] camera and he said I saw not one stock
[45:08] but I saw three stocks not two but three
[45:10] stocks and I took it down there was only
[45:13] one stock I put it up again and there
[45:15] was three stocks he said let's just say
[45:17] it this way sometimes we get out of
[45:21] focus and if we're not careful all the
[45:27] things that are going on around us is
[45:29] going to get us out of focus it's going
[45:32] to get us out of stamp it's going to
[45:33] pull us one way or the other
[45:35] if we give our eyes to it no heart to it
[45:38] and our thoughts to it it's there to
[45:40] pull you away from one thing the coming
[45:43] of the Lord Jesus this is what he said
[45:47] again in Luke chapter 21 and verse 25 he
[45:50] said there shall be signs in the Sun and
[45:52] the moon and the stars and upon the
[45:55] earth distress of Nations with
[45:56] perplexity the sea and the waves roaring
[46:00] men's heart failing them for fear and
[46:02] for looking after these things which are
[46:05] coming upon the earth for the powers of
[46:06] heaven shall be shaken and then shall
[46:09] they see the Son of man coming in clouds
[46:11] with great power and great glory
[46:14] and when they's when these things begin
[46:16] to come to pass what do you do look up
[46:21] lift up your heads for your Redemption
[46:25] draweth not they meant what are you
[46:28] looking at what are you so what you're
[46:30] seeing depends on what you're looking
[46:32] with if you're looking with these two
[46:35] eyes you'll see the things of this world
[46:37] the problems around you the situations
[46:40] around you if no one would have looked
[46:42] with these two eyes he would have never
[46:44] built a boat if Moses would have looked
[46:48] with these two eyes he would have never
[46:50] went and seen a burning bush it made
[46:54] excuses why there must be a bad drought
[46:56] going on something happened everybody
[46:58] wasn't looking with these two eyes
[47:01] something else grabbed ahold of him just
[47:03] as no something else grabbed ahold of
[47:05] until where it wasn't looking with these
[47:07] two eyes now I no doubt these two eyes
[47:09] tried to take over sometime no doubt he
[47:12] had mine battles and things things he
[47:14] had to deal with wanted to quit wanted
[47:16] to give up there's 120 years of this
[47:19] going on I don't know what all he had to
[47:20] deal with all I know is he continued to
[47:23] walk with God and continue to do what
[47:25] God told him to do and God sent the rain
[47:29] God sent the judgment and the boat
[47:31] floated and he was saved and his family
[47:33] was saved hallelujah
[47:35] I don't know when you may have mine
[47:36] battles you may feel like giving up but
[47:38] you just keep walking with Jesus you
[47:40] keep walking according to the Word of
[47:43] God got us in the rain gotta send the
[47:46] judgment of
[47:47] the things that are bothering you God
[47:49] will move those obstacles out of your
[47:50] way just could walk one with God keep
[47:56] looking into the unseen God has are
[48:00] people that are looking away from the
[48:02] world the world wants you to look at it
[48:06] the world wants you to see all the
[48:09] problems and the bad news everything's
[48:11] bad news they don't want you to see any
[48:14] good news it wants you to believe that
[48:16] everybody's hateful and spiteful and
[48:18] ungodly and everybody's wrong and
[48:20] everybody's everybody's just terrible
[48:22] person than ain't true it wants you to
[48:26] believe that there's no hope and mankind
[48:28] that ain't true it wants you to believe
[48:32] there's more problems than our solutions
[48:34] there's more sicknesses in there as
[48:36] health there's more disappointments and
[48:39] there are happy times and what happens
[48:42] we as people if we're looking with these
[48:44] eyes when disappointment comes our
[48:46] reaction and how we react and how we how
[48:49] we how we carry ourselves after a
[48:51] disappointment tells us what we're
[48:54] looking at and what we're looking with
[48:57] come on somebody even a person can go
[49:01] through disappointments in their lives
[49:02] and and they react and they get bitter
[49:04] towards God it shows you you're looking
[49:06] at the wrong thing you're not looking at
[49:10] the promise of God you're not looking at
[49:12] God himself you're looking at middle
[49:15] line poor old me how bad I got and how
[49:18] terrible I'm having and how and nobody
[49:20] else was having a bad day like I'm
[49:22] having come on now this is our human
[49:25] about human so thoughts aren't human
[49:28] they're thinking and how we turn to
[49:30] ourselves well I'm having such a bad day
[49:32] there's nobody having a bad day like I'm
[49:34] having instead of looking saying I'll
[49:38] have such a good God
[49:39] there's nobody got a God like I got
[49:42] he'll take care of me when nobody else
[49:44] to take care of me he'll feed me when
[49:47] nobody else will feed me he'll heal me
[49:49] when nobody else can heal me he'll
[49:50] deliver me when nobody else can deliver
[49:52] me hallelujah I have a great guard
[49:57] oh if our minds can turn away from our
[49:59] disappointments and our sicknesses and
[50:02] our problems and realize God is God and
[50:05] his word don't change
[50:07] God is God he's the same yesterday today
[50:10] and forever he's the same God right now
[50:12] that can move aside every problem every
[50:15] sickness every trouble and her family
[50:18] strife everything in a moment in a
[50:20] twinkling of an eye if you take your
[50:22] eyes off of what you're looking at and
[50:24] look to Jesus look at him my brother
[50:34] Timothy all I see is strife all I see is
[50:37] problems all I see is the world has
[50:40] fallen apart huh all I see is
[50:42] everybody's terrible
[50:44] everybody's horrible there's no good
[50:47] person in this world you know Isaiah at
[50:52] one time looked at Jesus he could have
[50:58] looked at problems he could look at
[50:59] situations around him his life maybe
[51:01] wouldn't go in the way he planned it but
[51:03] one day he caught another glimpse and he
[51:05] looked away from the world and he looked
[51:08] to see him and when he saw him he said I
[51:12] see a counselor I see a Prince of Peace
[51:16] I see the mighty God
[51:18] I see the everlasting father that's what
[51:21] I said looked away in song hallelujah
[51:27] Daniel one time he could have saw a lot
[51:30] of problems he coulda saw a kingdom that
[51:32] was turning against him he gonna saw a
[51:34] king that decreed he going to a Lions
[51:36] there but he looked away from the Lions
[51:38] Den he looked away from the other
[51:40] problem and he said I see a stone you'd
[51:43] out of the mountain without hands I see
[51:46] a God who's able to move when there's
[51:48] impossibilities zico he mine and his
[51:53] life no doubt was not going the way he
[51:55] played but he looked away and he looked
[51:57] one day at him and he said well he's a
[52:00] will in the middle of the will
[52:03] hallelujah he's a will in the middle of
[52:05] the wheel and he's the hub that
[52:08] everything's connected to he's the big
[52:11] wheel that's run by faith and all of us
[52:14] are turned and spokes connected to that
[52:17] wheel by the power of the Lord Jesus
[52:19] that's what Ezekiel saw when he looked
[52:22] away what are you looking at well I had
[52:28] this problem and I got this going on and
[52:29] I'm bitter I'm just mad ain't nobody
[52:32] gonna make me happy no as long as you're
[52:33] looking at that ain't nobody gonna make
[52:35] you happy but if you'll turn and look
[52:38] let me say if you just continue in that
[52:40] way God can't even make you happy he
[52:49] said well I need God to do this will
[52:50] change your attitude and God can move
[52:53] listen it's our attitude that causes a
[52:56] lot of issues pressure gets to us and we
[53:00] ain't quite pressurized
[53:02] amen things of life and things around us
[53:05] and our attitude stinks sometimes I just
[53:07] be honest with you it gets on the world
[53:10] the things of the world and all the
[53:11] stuff around us I don't know how many
[53:18] he's dealt with depressions in his last
[53:19] few months spirits won't ever hand me
[53:26] and my wife were trying to set aside
[53:28] time in the morning I meant to have
[53:29] devotions together and pray and the more
[53:32] we try to go into that realm seem like
[53:33] the more the devil fights that tells me
[53:35] I'm going the right direction hey man
[53:39] that's what he's gonna do he coming
[53:41] against you to try to get your eyes of
[53:43] what's really going on around you what's
[53:46] really happening around you John the
[53:49] Baptist he could have looked and said my
[53:50] head's fixing to be on a platter
[53:52] government's turned against me things
[53:54] are going wrong but when he looked and
[53:56] he caught sight of him he saw a dove and
[53:58] heard a voice saying this is my beloved
[54:00] Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in
[54:02] that's what he saw when he looked at
[54:05] Jesus hallelujah they saw him because
[54:09] the Spirit came down from heaven like a
[54:11] dove said this is my
[54:13] son Noah when he looked away to see him
[54:20] Noah saw the just judgments of God
[54:23] coming upon the people of the world who
[54:26] had rejected his word listen all this
[54:30] burning and things that's going on is
[54:31] only a precursor it's only a precursor
[54:36] of the judgment that's about to come
[54:37] upon this world lawlessness homei amen
[54:42] things that's coming upon this earth and
[54:43] the situation is going to happen when
[54:46] this bride lifts off of here I had
[54:49] somebody email me telling me they don't
[54:50] believe in the rapture I'm sorry I'm not
[54:53] going with you
[54:55] don't take my hope away that's the only
[54:59] hope of ever getting out of this
[55:00] situation we're in
[55:02] how many coming told Noah they didn't
[55:05] believe in a boat how many come told
[55:09] Noah they don't believe in rain well I
[55:12] got my quotes and I got my this and I
[55:14] got my scientific proof it ain't gonna
[55:16] rain it ain't never rain it as possible
[55:18] to rain no one said God said is going to
[55:20] rain all I know is the Prophet said
[55:23] there's a bride getting ready to go in a
[55:25] rapture he preached a message called the
[55:27] rapture so sound like you're listening
[55:33] to another voice not the voice I've been
[55:39] trained to listen to him Moses when he
[55:42] looked away Moses had all kind of
[55:44] problems he had a government behind they
[55:46] was trying to kill him he's running on
[55:48] the backside of the desert he had all
[55:49] kinds of reasons to hide behind a bush
[55:51] somewhere but he saw when he looked away
[55:53] he saw a bush on fire the pillar of fire
[55:56] had been come down into a bush and when
[55:59] Moses draw close to it he heard a voice
[56:01] that said take off your shoes
[56:03] the I am is here hold hallelujah the I
[56:06] him is here it did not I was not I will
[56:10] be the I am eternally I am he saw him
[56:14] that's what he saw in the burning bush
[56:18] Israel they had all kind of problems
[56:20] they had fire serpents going among them
[56:22] because of their sin and their disbelief
[56:24] in God amen but God raised up
[56:26] brass certain and said look and live
[56:29] change what you're looking at quit
[56:31] looking at this below and look to that
[56:35] look and live amen what was it was
[56:38] speaking of the suffering of Christ for
[56:40] the judgment of the sick and the lost in
[56:45] the atonement Oh hallelujah
[56:47] I love hate deals with this because some
[56:49] people can believe for the atonement for
[56:51] sin but they can't believe for the
[56:52] atonement of sickness Jesus was that
[56:54] atonement as Moses lift up the brass
[56:57] serpent the wilderness so must the Son
[56:59] of Man be lifted up for the same purpose
[57:02] they had sinned and they got sick but he
[57:06] that came to take away their sins and
[57:08] their sicknesses and that's what Jesus
[57:11] did Jesus was wounded for our
[57:14] transgressions but by His stripes were
[57:17] healed take divine healing away from
[57:20] Christ you cut the atonement in half but
[57:23] what do you see when you look at him a
[57:27] man Moses saw a burning bush no assault
[57:30] rain he saw judgment right just judgment
[57:33] coming up on the air Ezekiel saw a will
[57:35] in the middle of the wheel Isaiah saw a
[57:37] counselor mighty God and everlasting
[57:39] father but what do you see when you look
[57:42] away from your problems and you put your
[57:45] focus on him then what do you see I tell
[57:49] you what I see I see a savior I see a
[57:53] healer I see a deliverer I said God is
[57:57] worthy of every praise and every honor
[58:00] no one I can sing that song every
[58:02] praises to my god sing hallelujah to my
[58:06] god because I know why I was when he
[58:08] found me and I know where I am when he
[58:10] brought me and he put me up on a rock by
[58:12] his side hallelujah praise be to God
[58:21] what do you see when you see him if you
[58:28] look through a crate they'll tell your
[58:29] days of miracles are past it's not super
[58:32] 10 natural times anymore it's it's just
[58:35] believing on the word but if you look at
[58:38] it through the word you
[58:40] see he's the same yesterday today and
[58:43] forever the disciples had a lot to look
[58:51] at on the ship they had a lot of
[58:53] problems going on winds and waves and it
[58:57] ain't fun being on a little boat out in
[58:59] the middle of a sea been there done that
[59:01] don't care to do it again waves you
[59:04] can't even see over and it's cresting
[59:06] over the boat you feel like at any
[59:09] moment you don't know what's about to
[59:10] happen because we're going down we're
[59:11] going through what's going on and here
[59:13] they are rocking and carrying on and
[59:15] they're looking at these waves and
[59:17] they're getting worse getting worse and
[59:18] all of a sudden once it who is that who
[59:22] is that out there and when they looked
[59:25] away at the from the troubled sea they
[59:27] saw the only help that could help them I
[59:34] trust somebody tonight and look away
[59:36] from the sickness and see the only help
[59:38] that can help you the only one maybe I
[59:42] can look away from your family issues or
[59:44] your problems that's going on and the
[59:45] things that's happened in your life and
[59:47] the situations nobody could fix if they
[59:49] had all the time in the world it'd be
[59:51] impossible for them fix but there is a
[59:52] help that can help you man Caine helping
[59:57] governments can't help you people can't
[59:59] help you but there is a help that can
[1:00:01] help you you said well I'm depressed I
[1:00:03] got anxiety I got fear
[1:00:05] I got dread I got there is a help that
[1:00:07] can help you it's not a psychologist
[1:00:10] there's not a doctor it's not somebody
[1:00:12] here on this earth but there is a help
[1:00:14] that can help you that can come in a
[1:00:16] moment in a twinkling of eye and change
[1:00:18] that whole situation hallelujah
[1:00:23] I was listening to this tape this
[1:00:25] morning look away to Jesus and brother
[1:00:27] Brandon was going through all the
[1:00:28] different things that happened in his
[1:00:30] ministry incredible incredible tape
[1:00:32] going through the different things of
[1:00:34] God speaking and and the word had he
[1:00:36] write in the squirrels and I don't in
[1:00:38] the storm and his wife and all those
[1:00:40] things that had taken place and he tell
[1:00:44] us about a mr. shim and on the candy
[1:00:47] store that was in a bad suit way it got
[1:00:51] in sick and was in terrible situation
[1:00:54] and he'd went there as a little boy and
[1:00:56] bought candy from him and I know many of
[1:00:58] us probably been to that store I've been
[1:00:59] there enjoy that plays red hearts are
[1:01:01] great had some just a few days ago where
[1:01:06] the Ben Coleman sent me something for my
[1:01:08] birthday I appreciated that anyway I had
[1:01:12] you know as he went there's a little boy
[1:01:14] told some things that I can't comprehend
[1:01:16] talking about getting a can't ice cream
[1:01:18] cone for a penny or something like that
[1:01:20] and having a pocket full of candy just
[1:01:22] for a couple of cents and things we
[1:01:24] can't comprehend the day within times
[1:01:26] that we live in as far as by value value
[1:01:29] of money and things but this man he went
[1:01:32] there as a little kid and this man had
[1:01:34] gotten really sick and he's hit he said
[1:01:36] he'd heard about brother branham and his
[1:01:38] prayers and how God answered him and he
[1:01:40] called for him to come by his side and
[1:01:41] he was in a terrible shape I can't
[1:01:43] remember all the problems in
[1:01:45] possibilities but all of a sudden
[1:01:48] brother branham looked from what he saw
[1:01:50] to something else and he said what he
[1:01:54] said brothers brothers him it's going to
[1:01:56] be alright
[1:01:57] he said I'm gonna buy redhots from you
[1:01:59] again one day he said it completely
[1:02:04] forgot about it they went home for
[1:02:05] Christmas or something sometimes going
[1:02:07] home back to Jeffersonville went to run
[1:02:09] to grab a few things as gifts and ran
[1:02:11] into he said I went right went into
[1:02:13] Simpson he said I walked over there with
[1:02:15] my hat draw down there was mister Shemp
[1:02:17] now standing heard he got healed he said
[1:02:19] but I hadn't seen him yet and he said
[1:02:20] I've seen him standing behind there I
[1:02:21] walked with my kind of my hat covered
[1:02:23] and I said I'd like about a half a pound
[1:02:25] or a pound okay member of Red Hots
[1:02:28] he said okay and he fixed him up and he
[1:02:30] handed him up and he said brother
[1:02:31] branham looked up and he said well
[1:02:32] brother Brenner
[1:02:34] he said I told you I you would sell me
[1:02:36] Red Hots again I'd like to have about
[1:02:41] another half pound of Red Hots
[1:02:44] then we could catch a different vision
[1:02:47] all the things going around us and all
[1:02:49] the problems in the situation and the
[1:02:51] devil pointing out there it's important
[1:02:53] out that and this failure and this
[1:02:54] problem and this situation over here I
[1:02:57] don't like how this hat I don't like
[1:02:59] catch a different vision and you can get
[1:03:02] out of that old decrepit position that
[1:03:05] you're in and you may be down and out
[1:03:07] and seem like nobody cares but if you'll
[1:03:09] catch the vision that God cares for you
[1:03:13] that God cares enough about a man to
[1:03:16] tell him you're gonna sell me Red Hots
[1:03:18] again does it care enough about a person
[1:03:21] to say hey you're not going down and

[1:13:44] talked about how dark it is you don't
[1:13:46] say I'd go past that and we're now here
[1:13:49] where we're at and it's dark but he read
[1:13:56] a scripture in that sermon that said
[1:13:59] arise and shine for that light has come
[1:14:04] light can only truly show its brightness
[1:14:07] in darkness it can only truly show how
[1:14:11] bright it is the darker it gets the
[1:14:13] greater the darkness the greater the
[1:14:16] light the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:14:18] upon thee though darkness shall cover
[1:14:22] the earth groats darkness to people but
[1:14:24] the Lord shall rise upon thee
[1:14:27] did you hear me Church the Lord shall
[1:14:30] arise upon thee Satan says cancers gonna
[1:14:34] rise upon you or sugar diabetes for this
[1:14:36] land the other whatever kind of problem
[1:14:38] it's gonna know the scripture let me
[1:14:40] take him back to Scripture the scripture
[1:14:42] says the Lord shall arise upon thee the
[1:14:46] Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory
[1:14:51] you not due to be crowned in the glory
[1:14:54] of cancer of the Gloria I've ever kind
[1:14:56] of seeing the call you're here to be
[1:14:58] crowned with the glory of the Lord it
[1:15:01] shall be seen upon thee is it gross
[1:15:05] darkness upon the people he said this is
[1:15:07] prophesied of the day we're now living
[1:15:10] in and he goes on to say he said and
[1:15:12] it'll only get darker if he reads that
[1:15:20] he reads out of Psalm 62 truly my soul
[1:15:23] waits upon the Lord for him from him
[1:15:26] cometh my salvation he only is my rock
[1:15:29] and my salvation he is my defense i
[1:15:32] shall not be greatly moved how long were
[1:15:35] you imagine mischief against a man you
[1:15:38] shall be slain of all you he says /
[1:15:41] slain of all you as a Boeing Walsh a you
[1:15:43] being as a tottering fence next all the
[1:15:45] way down
[1:15:46] they only counsel consult to cast him
[1:15:49] down from his excellent sleep they
[1:15:50] delight in lies who does they do they
[1:15:56] bless with their mouths but they cursed
[1:15:58] inwardly Selah my soul wait on thou only
[1:16:03] upon God for my expectation is from him
[1:16:07] ho holiday he only is my rock and my
[1:16:11] salvation he is my defense and I shall
[1:16:16] not move and god is my salvation in my
[1:16:19] glory the rock of my strength in my
[1:16:21] refuge isn't God trust in him at all
[1:16:24] times you people pour out your hearts
[1:16:27] before him God is a refuge for us
[1:16:33] he says but in Isaiah I'm going back he
[1:16:36] said I rise and shine for the glory that
[1:16:38] God has come upon you the light is here
[1:16:40] the next verse he says gross darkness
[1:16:42] upon the people and we are in the mist
[1:16:44] mix of light and darkness he said my
[1:16:47] address to the church though to the
[1:16:49] bride to the church is Shalom peace this
[1:16:57] let that sink down what is what yours
[1:17:01] what are what are you supposed to be
[1:17:02] listening to peace we're facing this
[1:17:08] year both darkness and light now the
[1:17:10] world wants you to only see darkness but
[1:17:14] there's also like the world is as one
[1:17:19] the most chaotic times of darkness that
[1:17:21] is ever student and yet we're here again
[1:17:24] in the most blessed light that has ever
[1:17:28] shine begin the differences just as it
[1:17:32] were in the beginning when gross
[1:17:33] darkness upon the earth but the spirit
[1:17:36] of glory upon the face of the water and
[1:17:38] said let there be light and the power of
[1:17:41] darkness could not stop the light
[1:17:46] hallelujah he said I believe that's what
[1:17:48] we're living in the hour again when God
[1:17:51] is separating light from darkness he's
[1:17:55] pressing it to the other side of the
[1:17:57] world that the light might be made
[1:17:59] manifest that's why he says I say to the
[1:18:02] church I say shallow is because it's
[1:18:06] God's peace I got a piece that the world
[1:18:10] didn't give and the world therefore
[1:18:13] can't take it away it's not the peace of
[1:18:17] the world and their peace pact to world
[1:18:19] packs in this packet and all the things
[1:18:21] as they come up with and their laws
[1:18:22] that's not the peace I'm looking for or
[1:18:25] I need I have God's peace and God's
[1:18:28] peace is not affected by the temporary
[1:18:31] peace or worldly peace there is a
[1:18:36] difference but what are you looking
[1:18:40] where are you looking at what are you
[1:18:42] looking for he said the world's 1 they
[1:18:44] going cried peace
[1:18:45] and sudden destruction is going to come
[1:18:50] he said but now we see breaking over the
[1:18:52] on a realm is breaking between
[1:18:54] mortal and immortality we see it break
[1:18:57] in between heavens and earth from an
[1:18:59] Earthbound sickness in trouble world
[1:19:01] into a bright shining day of immortal
[1:19:05] life and an immortal body and an
[1:19:08] immortal earth that shall never pass
[1:19:11] away he said that's why I can say
[1:19:14] chillon what are you looking at if
[1:19:19] you're looking at this earth the earth
[1:19:22] you can only be at peace when the earth
[1:19:23] is at peace when you have a you know
[1:19:27] they don't seem to be near as much bad
[1:19:28] bad news in the world and you got you
[1:19:31] know this and that and the other and
[1:19:32] then nothing having a good day it's
[1:19:34] Wednesday oh my great day Friday great
[1:19:37] day I can have peace and Saturday you
[1:19:40] get up in the world falls apart what
[1:19:41] happens to the peace that's not the
[1:19:45] peace I'm talking about tell my gods
[1:19:47] peace they can come into your heart and
[1:19:50] settle you and say no matter what the
[1:19:54] world does they didn't give me this
[1:19:56] peace and therefore if they didn't give
[1:20:00] it they can't take it I don't care how
[1:20:03] bad the world gets I don't care if how
[1:20:07] many people died tomorrow how many
[1:20:09] people died this that and the other or
[1:20:10] this government gives up and that
[1:20:12] government starts fighting that this
[1:20:13] country starts fighting that country
[1:20:15] that has nothing to do with this piece
[1:20:17] this piece is connected to that place
[1:20:22] hallelujah but he says you you work look
[1:20:26] at the world is constantly going down
[1:20:28] down down down listen they turn to what
[1:20:30] this country regardless if we want to
[1:20:33] admit it or not turn down the gospel
[1:20:38] somehow has message believers we got in
[1:20:41] our mind at this country somehow it's
[1:20:42] gonna turn around it is not going to
[1:20:44] turn around is thus saith the Lord
[1:20:49] and that's why even brother branham said
[1:20:51] he said I don't even pray for it
[1:20:55] he said because she rejected the word
[1:20:59] but we want to pray for certain things
[1:21:02] because our motives to have a peaceful
[1:21:03] day or peaceful time peaceful life have
[1:21:07] a retirement have the that's not what
[1:21:09] we're here for our 401 K that's not what
[1:21:12] we're here for our retirement that's
[1:21:14] really not what we're here for if you
[1:21:16] make it god bless you but that's not why
[1:21:17] you're here for one day retirement to
[1:21:20] run out what then but what are we
[1:21:23] looking for what are we looking at
[1:21:27] Shalom
[1:21:32] when one day and a mortal life will make
[1:21:37] an immortal body to come and live on an
[1:21:40] immortal earth that's the piece I'm
[1:21:42] looking for hallelujah he says he goes
[1:21:46] on he talked about the world as just
[1:21:48] getting dark and he gets goes on you can
[1:21:50] listen to his incredible sermon gross
[1:21:52] darkness he said I even see up on
[1:21:54] churches and they're failing to see
[1:21:56] light shining there seemed to be such a
[1:21:59] heavy press said some of the noted
[1:22:02] evangelist is there constantly screaming
[1:22:03] for revival working right against it
[1:22:05] seeing not understanding not knowing but
[1:22:08] the Prophet said gross darkness would be
[1:22:10] upon the people and he said it was the
[1:22:13] same darkness it was on the Jews when
[1:22:15] Jesus came they missed him and he said
[1:22:18] the same darkness again we're a whole
[1:22:20] group of people are missing him and
[1:22:23] calling it fanaticism calling it this or
[1:22:26] whatever all kind of but he said the
[1:22:28] hour is upon us darkness gross darkness
[1:22:31] gross darkness on the people that's what
[1:22:33] it is what does it all mean where are we
[1:22:36] standing one hour over here how close
[1:22:38] are we to coming he says fear not little
[1:22:43] flock it is your father's good will to
[1:22:47] give you the kingdom peace Shalom God is
[1:22:52] beginning to separate the light from the
[1:22:55] darkness
[1:22:56] and is pressing behind it like he did in
[1:22:58] the beginning to show the dawn of a new
[1:23:01] day
[1:23:02] the church ages are fading out Amen God
[1:23:06] is pressing the darkness into a place it
[1:23:09] has to do it to fade out the
[1:23:10] organization church organization fade
[1:23:12] out the world the world is covering this
[1:23:14] thing over worldly isms taking this
[1:23:16] place where only things worldly dressing
[1:23:18] worldly acting worldly living it's the
[1:23:20] world but we are not of the world we are
[1:23:26] of heaven this is not our home no
[1:23:31] holiday is it sure as many good people
[1:23:35] sincere people that get caught up in the
[1:23:37] creeds and the dogmas and the denying
[1:23:39] the power thereof and having a form of
[1:23:41] good of godliness but denying the power
[1:23:43] gross darkness it blinded Israel is now
[1:23:46] blinding the church he said but the
[1:23:49] bride is making herself ready mmm how
[1:23:55] many is part of that bride
[1:23:56] making herself ready for a time it's
[1:24:00] time for the rapture direct quote it's
[1:24:07] time for the rapture for darkness is
[1:24:11] fading upon the Gentiles and dawn will
[1:24:14] soon break upon the Jews the Sun is
[1:24:16] traveling from the east to the west and
[1:24:18] we're at the West now the light can only
[1:24:20] do one thing go back east again the
[1:24:23] light can only do that he said but see
[1:24:26] good people are caught caught in it just
[1:24:27] like though they were then even Mary and
[1:24:30] Joseph for good people thought Jesus was
[1:24:32] with them and come to find out he had
[1:24:34] left him and he wasn't even with them
[1:24:36] and he said so is the church world they
[1:24:38] think Jesus is with them but in this
[1:24:40] darkness they've lost him he said but
[1:24:43] there is a people that has not lost him
[1:24:47] hallelujah
[1:24:49] groans darkness is upon the people but
[1:24:51] what about the light
[1:24:53] what are we to look for when I look at
[1:24:56] the darkness look at the light rise and
[1:24:59] shine for the light has come look to the
[1:25:03] light

[1:25:57] identified Shalom it's the great day of
[1:26:01] breaking upon us the greatest day ever
[1:26:04] known to man when that day breaks that
[1:26:10] bright and cloudless morning when the
[1:26:13] earth dead in Christ's arise what a day
[1:26:18] and somehow God Satan is so dark in
[1:26:21] people's mind to where they're not
[1:26:23] looking for that day they're looking for
[1:26:27] destruction they're looking for judgment
[1:26:29] they're looking for issues and problems
[1:26:34] looking for this world to burn over
[1:26:36] that's where they're headed
[1:26:38] I'm not looking to that I'm looking to
[1:26:42] good morning I'm looking shalom peace

[1:26:51] same amongest
[1:26:53] darkness is being separated God is
[1:26:58] causing it hello did you hang up
[1:27:05] God is allowing this to happen because
[1:27:09] it's set in the atmosphere for good
[1:27:12] morning
[1:27:16] chalo gods causing it the lights doing
[1:27:21] it the lights pressing itself in such a
[1:27:23] way until darkness has to congregate
[1:27:27] together they had a chance to accept it
[1:27:33] and they wouldn't do it so now it's
[1:27:36] being condensed together and together
[1:27:40] disagreeing but Isaiah 60 rise and shine
