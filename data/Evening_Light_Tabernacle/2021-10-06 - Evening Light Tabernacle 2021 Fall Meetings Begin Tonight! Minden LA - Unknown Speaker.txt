lazarus had no power to come forth but the speaker the one that was doing the speaking had a breath of life that loosed him from the bones it loosed it from the grips of death and brought him back to life again i'll tell you the same one that stood in the graves of lazarus is the same god that stood here in the end time and used the message of the hour to speak to the church of the living god we were dead in sins and we were dead in sins and trespasses but god gonna hold my body down [Applause] [Music] brother josh the devil thought he could take her away from you baby's on the way some have their doubts but i know that i know that i know where you can find someone who cares amen that his wife was hundreds of miles from him and he knelt down and began to pray and his wife wasn't in touch she wasn't within reach of him amen but he began to pray and said before the doctor ever touches her the cancer's going to leave her body and miles away the cancer began to drop off of her you said preacher why you tell things like that because somebody may be watching this right now they may be somewhere sitting at home hundreds of miles away and saying they ain't got no hope but let me tell you there's a hope tonight in the preaching of the gospel of jesus christ you don't have to be in this building amen that cancer can drop off your body right now he's a cancer killing god don't tell me it's gone don't tell me that i stood preaching the gospel in a meeting just a few years ago and a man sitting in the meeting stood up and began to testify brother wayne while you were preaching the cancer that was on my chest has fell away i am completely healed if god can do that through me he can do it through any person in this field for the spirit of the lord is upon us to say we have liberty liberty to be the sons and daughters of god except your liberty you've got a right to tell the devil get out of here the day of sin is over now look at look at the position he put you in he put you in a position of favor jesus has changed my life his name be lifted this holy fire's burning inside of me i cannot hold it inside i cannot keep it quiet this holy fire's burning inside of me paul and silas were imprisoned the bible says when they started praising god their change fell oh yes there is power and true worship god is an object of worship that means when you start believing what he says about yourself when you start confessing what he has done for you then you it will make you want to shout hallelujah thank you jesus lord you're worthy of all my praise [Applause] he was [Applause] [Music] i am [Applause] where people and invincible armies sent forth to this last day we're not going to leave out of here undefeated people we're leaving out of here of victorious people the rapture is not a defeat the rapture is the greatest victory the world has ever seen amen the glory has risen upon you we're going to see the glory of the lord hammer the earth as this bridling from here as he raptures a people for his glory
