looking at that first verse and we're going to sing it again before we go to prayer he said he walks among us and all that he does all of his mercy and all of his love if the pen of the writer could write every day even the world can never contain it's what john would say in john chapter 21 said this is this is the disciple was testify of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true and there are many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written that's who's walking among us he's a god of miracles he's a god of mercy he's the god the same yesterday today and forever i i tell you this morning i believe that this is not a sermon or a service to just take for granted or to just take half-heartedly i believe we're in for a special moment with him i just woke up this morning just feeling the charge of the presence of god i know the angel of the lord is among us yesterday i would walk around my mother's bed and we would pray just a few days before brother ron spencer had been there and was praying for her he would come to me and said go around to the head of that bed and see if that angel is not there and i would go around there and i would feel the presence of god and i knew the angel of the lord was standing there and he would my brother tim would walk back in and he would tell him what was going on and brother tim's words was thank you for coming thank you for coming so we can't we can't open the red sea but we can speak and we can go forward [Music] as they would turn around and leave and go out the door as we was about to leave the hospital room the presence of the angel would walk around would go out or go around the bed and it would touch esther she stood right there at the foot of the bed and she would just about crumble to her feet and lose her strength the virtue would leave her and she would begin to speak said this is the miracle of life yesterday we would go there again and i would you know walk around there to that part of the bed just to see if that one same place would be there that same moment would wouldn't feel anything but i would went out because i wanted brother my son andrew to come in and so i went in there to sign him in got to talking to the receptionist for a moment and talking to her about the things of god and different situations by the time i got into the room they had went back into prayer and brother matt dexter that is here with us somewhere in the building this morning and right there he i'd walk in as he was praying and the presence of the lord would just you could tell the atmosphere had changed in the room the presence of god would come into the room and just knew that the lord was there again and uh we the nurses would walk in after they'd we'd finish praying and she would ask her was it time to turn her turn mom over and she said yeah she said i actually was coming in a few moments ago but it sounded like he was praying so i wanted to give you some time and so they came in to do that we would walk out and brother derek paris was with us and different ones and we'd walk out and brother tim would text me and say it's all clear come back in let's have prayer because visitation was about to be over and let's have one last prayer before we leave so we'd walk back in and i'd walk around that end of the bed around to the side right to the head the presence of god was so strong that i would just i would have to grab even as i am right now having to hold the bed to stand up and i would look at dad and i said the presence of the angel is here again and he'll begin to say thank you for coming because when he comes something always good happens and so i know this morning he's with us i would i would pick a sermon on my way home our way to church this morning and just randomly choose one and it had i say randomly in a way it was random because i had no idea what would be said but it was jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and as you know i've been on that thought and so i would thought well this would be going to listen to and hit play and brother branham would again say it's my favorite of the hymns down from his glory he said because it expresses his deity in the day that we're living in he said they want to make him just a prophet but he's more than a prophet he's god so i know we're in for something special this morning so i wouldn't take this moment very lightly i would take it very seriously he walks among us if you know who's walking among you then you would reach out and touch the hem of his garment and be made whole this morning be touched he's a high priest that we can be touched by the feelings of our infirmity i we have a lot of needs this morning and i i'm going to sing that before we pray but i want to take these knees before you today we have brother raymond butler that's his daughter sister ron is asking for prayer he he streams nearly every service of not every service here and was very tuned into things that goes on here in our church but he said they removed a cancerous tumor from his colon the doctor stated that the cancer had seeped out into the blood he's to start chemo treatments tomorrow and desires prayers of the saints to be with him to carry him through the journey ahead he trusts us he says trust us in god and he believes him he knows he's the healer and he's with him but he appreciate all of us to remember him in prayer we had sister debbie ray from washington recovering from a hysterectomy to remove a small cancer that was found doing well husband is having surgery just needing a touch in their bodies uh he's having he's having surgery monday to remove cancer on his tongue both need healing and insurance and things to go through for them ask god to make a way where there seems to be no way you know we have the happy valley church that's been under attack of this covid and brother jim babb is in very serious condition in the hospital by the tim airwood as well and maybe some others but many of them are sick he's asking the lord to move on their behalf i was just listening today that the angel of the lord that and on that same tape as brother branham would talk about that woman there was two women that came in the prayer line and how that it was pronounced healing over their bodies he said he said it don't always happen immediately he said but god always answers and he said if you'll just hold the faith of god in your heart he said god sometimes will he said it just depends he said but don't ever back up if it don't happen immediately just hold on to the promise and god will bring it to pass and we know the story of how he said the healing angel passed to the neighborhood he walks among us and i believe he's walking through the hospital rooms this morning and then and the places where his people are in in need of him sister ladonna smith is as well on a ventilator and been fighting for a life and things are moving in the right direction even now but we want to ask god to bring a complete healing and total deliverance to her body brother ron ron spencer would feel led yesterday to have a prayer line in his church feel directed to preach last night and to have a prayer line the man stood for over two hours praying for the needs of the people [Music] what a mighty god we serve mercy of course we want to continue to remember sister karen and just ask the healing angel to pass through her place again today i i believe it doesn't matter what you're facing god is able more than able and able to touch any need and any heart any desire how many would have a need today you want to make known to him hallelujah let's just sing this verse and course again before we go to prayer he walks among us and all that he does all of his mercy even this world could never contain how i have been blessed he's so good to me [Music] i [Music] how many do they believe that prayer changes things i believe it was friday night we got word that the doctor said sister ladonna wouldn't make it through the night they said she wasn't gonna make it through the night and i know me and my wife got down and went to prayer as many of you did as people began to pray for around the world and as i got up from there all i could think of was brother andrew spencer preaching here o king i'll see you in the morning and since that moment she's been improving and like brother timothy said it's heading in the right direction and it's positive but we believe she's going to be completely restored and completely healed you got brother jim babb and and brother airwood they're in the hospital in serious condition it wasn't too long ago i was laying in icu but the prayer of the saints changed things and i believe if we'll bind together and we'll go to prayer for these as if they're our mom as if they're our dad our loved one and take them before the throne of grace you can prepare for a series of victories because the enemy has come in like a flood but there's a standard there's a standard being raised and our god will be victorious we will be victorious we will see victory and we will see healings and we will see salvation let's take this before our god now our gracious heavenly father lord how we love you this morning how grateful

that's all it could take so he's talking about those two sisters brother brandon was speaking about he said you know it was a couple of weeks that he and angel came through but that woman got up that morning she just felt a cool feeling go over and immediately she was hungry amen and god moved the other sister got up that morning was shaking out the sheets because the gorter was gone he's that kind of god i was sitting under a tree in my front yard the other day i sent it out and that word began to whirl through me immediately immediately it don't take very long god can move in a moment in an instant we think sometimes it's a long time and sometimes it seems to drag on but just hold on because that cool sweet that cool feeling will sweep over and it'll all be done in this moment right here in this service your family can be changed lives can be changed things can be totally redone and rewrote immediately but andrew would get up the other morning or other day from a nap and that

part of a great ascending how wonderful amen god bless you amen i'm going to let you be seated just for a moment we just want to worship the lord together as we um reflect on this part of the service here today and uh we have something very special that is going on today we have um we have a brother ben steeman that is here and um he has asked adriana pruitt to be his wife and so to we want to announce their wedding engagement where you come down to the front a amen and it's going to take place somewhere around um well we're we're planning for october the 30th amen so uh we're what we believe that they will work out for us all and amen what a wonderful opportunity that we have you know to present one of our our young ladies here at the church to a young man from brother danny stevens church and ben is brother danny's nephew and of course everybody knows adriana's my granddaughter so it's very special it's my first and so she'll be the first of probably others that will come along and want to get married too and you know i stood very at this very similar place many years ago and the lord has blessed us with a union with four children and now that four children have grandchildren now we got one old enough to marry so we're thankful for the lord and for the testimony that god has given amen and the blessing that he's had upon our family i want y'all to come right here right over this way please stand right here i'm going to bless you in the name of jesus father at this awesome moment we bring ben and adriana before you two young people that gave their heart to

ask that you'll guide them in jesus name amen i love you [Music] amen [Music] praise the lord find us together bind us together with that can not be broken bind us together lord find us together behind us together with love amen amen we have something thank you we have well just wait just a minute um so we have something here i just wanted to speak about this morning before that we go into the message and um uh i have a few little photographs i'll be showing you just in a moment but um you know the we have um something that i spoke to you about many years ago and that i want to kind of bring to your attention today just one more time and um as as you know we believe in divine healing and there's healing no matter which way you go because the bible says he heals all diseases there's never a disease god doesn't heal some years ago i was looking at the the aspects of the holy spirit as he delivers and as you know down to the church ages there he is anointed um he has anointed um men and in different ages different times uh with a portion of his spirit and it's reflected in the four living creatures and that is the lion the ox the man and the eagle and uh of course when the white horse rider went forth which was it was like christ but it was the antichrist a deceiving spirit god raised up um and turned the face of the of the living creature toward the church and they had great faith as a lion and they had tenacity to hold on to the promise and to call those that were that said they were apostles and were not and found them liars and called them false apostles and so they had you know men with great faith and there was great miracles and signs and wonders that followed that and was influenced by that and then of course you know it changed from the white to the red and satan comes in and he changes his form and and now he bloodies the white horse with a uh with a sword and and there are millions that are killed um as the power of state got behind the the church and it formed into the catholicism and there was 68 million that were killed during those horrible times and and um and so the the ox anointing gave them the power to overcome in that age so it wasn't a different holy spirit or a different living creature aspect of god it was the same one but he just turned another face and he looked there toward them in that time and they willingly gave their lives and sometimes you wonder how in the world could men and women give their lives like they did and even their children would die and and their wife or husband would be killed and all of these things it was you know a horrible time how could they do it well because they were anointed to do so and they had the calf anointing there which was a sacrificial animal and they willingly gave their life and then of course the the way the enemy attacked it changed and he comes as the black horse rider and begins to begins to bring again charging money for the staff of life and and it started the dark ages and there would be a horrible time where truth was sequestered and and uh you know it um was a time of great darkness where um the light of god's word was dimmed and and that god gave them the again turned it as the enemy came he turned it a different way and another face looked toward the church and it was the man and with the man anointing it was the intelligence of a man and god would use men like luther with a gutenberg press and they would put the bible in the hands of the common people in the language instead of latin which nobody could read had to have a priesthood for you or being hid away in the cloisters of some monastery the bible now every person could have the bible in their common language they would print it in the in the german language and then from there into english you know tyndale and many others would give their lives for this book that you hold don't you ever take it for granted men died gave their life so you could have it in your language and that you could read it don't neglect it amen men's blood was spilled over for that and with the intelligence of a man god gave us the bible in print and so with that it overcame the darkness of that age with the light of the glorious word of god and so then of course you know the last anointing there would be when we come to the laodicean age it would be the eagle anointing and to overcome that god would send an eagle anointing he would send the prophet that he would come to to to bring us into realms where all things are possible to them that believe and so you know again the eagle is the only one that doesn't have to worry about crossing the river right he flies right over the top of it and it speaks of him as a flying eagle specifically because it indicates that we're going to have a rapture in this age so we're in a rapture now in a rapture in time under an eagle anointing right and so as i looked at that some years ago and thought about it that this is god's way of deliverance that sometimes you know in our in our troubles our trials the problems we have that god will will look upon us and the the the face of the living creature god's anointing will turn toward us as we as we pray and sometimes it'll be the great faith a lion ferocious uh tenacious courageous holding onto a promise now the these four living creatures were the same as um as the emblems of the fortre of the of the heads of the tribes of israel they would there would be four of them and three tribes on each side that would be guards around the the tabernacle and so judah would be under the lion down under the eagle and and so on like that and and with them that would be the banner and three tribes there with them as they gathered around and so this the same thing now um these are the guards there and when god his anointing comes a lot of times for us for healing it'll be the lion anointing or sometimes it will be the other side of the the opposite side which will be the eagle anointing and that's the miracle it just snatches you right out in a moment and you know one moment you're this way and the next moment you're you know it's different it's when it's like with my wife when they when and with little drew sitting at the end of the bed in one moment you know the eagle anointing there that the miraculous took place or eyesight came back little drew run all over the house never been able to walk 18 months old couldn't pull up couldn't couldn't um hardly stand alone could not take steps so you know you had you had that that eagle anointing is the miraculous and then you have times like when my wife went through the brain bleed a year ago and doctors didn't give us any hope and they called me in the middle of the night and said should we evacuate the blood from her brain and you know and and i held her life in my hands just for a moment and said yes by all means do that and the face turned around toward the intellect and god used to doctors and god uses doctors amen and and so and it looked that way and evacuated the blood and you know the story she came home she's lived now a year it's been wonderful that we have had this this time but there are there is one more and sometimes the face of the anointing which is the car for an ox anointing turns around and when you pray and and it's death but you see death doesn't change god's healing you understand he still heals all diseases in fact it's a greater healing than any because it takes you from here from suffering into a place into a dimension that is beyond you know anything that you could ever imagine that your heart could ever dream about no yesterdays or tomorrow young and as i saw my mother just young her face so tight no wrinkles a beautiful white garment there and i i thought you know who is this young girl and you know and i said it looks like my mother but who who could this be and i looked at brother ron standing there and he said wow i said brother ron that that looks just like my mother and he she spoke up and she said it is me tim and i've come to tell you you're well thought of over here and i'm sorry for all the trouble i caused you so you know um we know just one breath away is total divine healing and one day it'll be that for us even we that are living and alive and remain total divine healing now because sometimes that it you know doctors give up hope which the intelligence of man says we can't help you and you know we're we're doing everything we can to hold on with tenacity as a lion or you know our trusting for a miracle of the eagle you know but let me just say this to you as we think of this you know we we know it won't be the intelligence of a man because they've given up but brother branham said uh sometimes he said it turns dark around the people and i know they're not going to live but i don't say it because prayer could change that again and let me just say again he repeats it again the same thing a lot of times i see it turn dark under the people and i say well go on and may the lord bless you or something like that because prayer could change it so even if it looks like you know the anointing is looking this way and it looks like death is you know looks uh our direction or the ox anointing it looks our direction prayer can change it so we're standing there believing and trusting and expecting and knowing that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so you might wonder so well what are you going to do is sister karen dies i'm going to keep preaching divine healing amen i'm going to still preach that jesus saves and he delivers because my jesus is the lord he heals every disease and there's even healing and death but let me tell you this she can't die she died a long time ago give me a picture of number one please and she died a long time ago and then as i told you i preached from the churches book many years ago i still have this book picture number two this is my churches book which i preached two series from to this church where that i took a 125 30 sermons sometimes preached on only a line and took this book as you can see is well worn and i studied it since i was a boy we cut our teeth on this church hates book when when we in 1965 we received our first copies at the at these threeport meetings when brother branham was there there were copies of that that were brought to the meetings and we got our first copies there or right shortly thereafter and and mother and dad got us ever won a book a church's book personally and this was my book we sat around as a family because we had no place to go we had been put out by our church who had voted to join a denomination and we were against the nomination and so we came out and and um i was only 11 years old when i got this book but anyway we got this we we we came out and we had no place to go we sat in a living room and we read this book along with our bibles paragraph by paragraph and and we read it as a family each one of us taking a paragraph and reading my youngest brother learned to read on the church age book and and so you know we helped him stumble through all the words and everything else so you know i did this but i want you to know in one of those services give me the last one on april 11 1976 the holy spirit fell in the church as i was preaching on the church's book taking it in the series and my wife karen received the baptism of the holy ghost and so you know she can't die she's eternal the devil can't take her from us a man she can only just change dwelling places i want you to stand together with me because we're going to prayer now and and as we go to prayer i have in my hands two little handkerchiefs that are going to go to south africa there's a brother trium that is near the cape and he he has um he has a going blind and he has there's another brother there with cancer of brother ernest scotsman and they're asking for prayer for believers prayers today and we're going to pray together as as we pray and maybe you've got a need on your heart today and you say lord will you pass by my way today too let's talk to him father we love you today and we do believe that's what believers do i remember lord when the miraculous took place and i spoke those words to my children in the in the waiting room of the icu five years ago and said we're not going to fear we're going to believe because that's what we do we are believers and believers believe see and then lord you honored that and it came out of my mouth for i knew what i was saying she'll be in the icy room tonight she'll be in a regular room tomorrow night and the next night she'll be at home in her own bed lord he came to pass just like you said i didn't even manipulate it i didn't even request it it happened just that way father you're still god and we're still believing where you're believing children today even though doctors give up no we know it won't be the the face of a man with his intelligence we don't know how it will be but we know this that even if death looks at it we do know lord that our prayers can change it that just in a moment just in a moment seem lord it was just a moment when hezekiah was told his time was up and before he could get across the courtyard god spoke to him said i heard hezekiah praying over there go back and tell him i've extended his life lord you're still that god we still ask for your divine mercy but even if not lord no matter how you do it we're going to serve you with all our hearts we'll preach this glorious gospel and declare jesus christ the same in jesus name lord you see these two men brother trium going blind ernest scotsman with cancer god meet the needs of these men they're your children crying out i don't know them but they reached out lord they are i don't have nothing magic to send them i just have your word and it's more than magic it's creative we've seen it create new cells in cancer patients we've seen it open up the eyes of the blind lord just in one sweep you moved over and the blindness of my wife's eyes was restored lord you're still god you're still god and we're still your people and our prayers are still effective and we pray the effective fervent prayer of the righteous because we know it avails much and i send this today taking it from my body through this prayer now to south africa and for the needs of your people lord that lifted their hands everywhere meet them i pray in jesus name amen amen thank you lord all things are possible because we only believe god bless you thank you thank you amen god bless you as you know i've been using a timer and i just now started it amen first john chapter 3 verse 1. first john chapter 3 verse 1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is how many believes were in the hour of disappearing i don't think this is future i think right now even even though it is future but yet at the same time is present amen first john 4 and verse 4 the scripture is so full of so many wonderful things here now you are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen god bless you you can be seated today i'm going to speak on the book of acts continues hallelujah timothy didn't know what i was preaching on so he brought me out on the new testament church rising up amen now as we are looking at this god has ordained a people to be a book of acts church as we remember brother branham telling us that christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts that's why we can call this a continuation or the book of acts continues and then he says that the book of revelation on the other hand it exposes um the antichrist spirit that would come into the church and defile it and making it lukewarm formal and powerless now when we talk about the acts of the holy spirit or the acts of the apostles rather the book of acts it is not the acts of her failures that we are going to because i want to just remind you that we are a people who are predestinated not to fall now we know the early church would have to go down into the ground because they were a sea church that could have been raptured but god having something better things more names in the book to be manifested on the earth knowing that there would seven church ages follow that there will be 2 000 years of gentile dispensation that god knowing all of these things that that um he he would plant that church for a future crop where that it would come back to seed again and so again we are we're not a book of acts of her failures we are not the acts of her ignorant deeds we are not the acts of divisiveness over jewish traditions nor are we the acts of arguments over doctrine nor are we the acts of petty human rivalry now that is not the book of acts church i mean that is the book of human failures it's the acts of human failures the book of acts is called that because it is the acts of the holy spirit working in power in the church can you say amen now god has ordained a people to have a the book of acts of power and manifestations of the holy ghost as brother branham would tell us again in the church age book and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at pentecost by experience it will be a pentecostal church and there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healings and god will be in the midst of her and god will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has praise the lord again in the resume of the ages he said the people of god are being made ready by the word of god or the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the lord how many believes and thus saith the lord amen now of course we know that as he told us again that the lutheran age did not restore the church it started a reformation the western age these ages beyond us are passed us there which is the methodist age with john wesley it did not restore the church the pentecostal age we're talking about azusa street now did not restore but god has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration and god will bring or take the church right back to pentecost of the beginning hallelujah now i want to just bring out a few things today as we preface where i'm going today in december of 1959 you know brother branham preached the holy ghost series how many has ever heard it well if you happen you know you need to hear what the spirit has said to the church but in 1959 of december he preached the holy ghost series at his church he preached on what is the holy ghost he preached what the holy ghost was given for then he had the unrecorded sermon of how uh the how to receive the holy ghost and finally he had questioned answers on the holy ghost and but in november the month before he was in san jose california and he tells the group there about this coming revival that he's going to have at branham tabernacle and he says we're to leave home now right away i've got a three days meeting there at my little church teaching them the baptism of the holy ghost speaking in tongues signs and wonders to follow the believers and so forth are the people that's around in there i believe in all the spiritual gifts i believe in all the bible i am pentecost from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet inside outside all around through i am pentecostal now i just want to ask you the question you know was brother branham just a hypocrite that want to placate and appease his audience no you know there in san jose or what's he just willingly trying to deceive them you know what kind of man do you think he was what about his sermons when he preached the church ages and this would be now a year later in december of 1960 and in the laodicean church age and how many beliefs that's our church age amen i do you reckon do you reckon the messenger knew what his message was do you think this message messenger had a message from god that it was jesus christ speaking to this generation eventually you know the one jesus christ said to the angel or the angelos and the messenger of laodicea write these things god had something for this last age do you believe that so he would he would say in that message a good pedigreed heart say he's gentle oh he's good i like him he put his head on you over your shoulders loving kind why he knows who his pappy is he knows who his grandpappy is he knows who his grandpappy's pappy was and man he's he can go plumb on back his pedigree i like to see a pedigreed christian not packing his letter he's a methodist last week in a baptist this week and pentecostal this week and pilgrim holi is next week he don't know who his pappy is or whose mammy is but let me tell you a man that is born of the spirit of god can take you plum back to the day of pentecost because he is a pedigreed pentecostal amen i want to be listen your prophet i want to be pentecost from the top of my head to the souls of my feet i don't mean denominational pentecost i mean the real power of the resurrected christ the real pentecostal blessing now i shouldn't have to make a disclaimer but just just so that you know make no mistake about it i am not advocating at all to go back to azusa street you cannot revive that neither are we trying to but we're talking about a restoration promise by malachi 4. amen and malachite forward brother branham tells us over and over again was to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the pentecostal father in the message of shame in 1965 you know in jeffersonville he will say notice today if somebody says um are you a christian oh it's a popular thing to say oh i'm a christian see but then he says but do you believe the word of god oh yeah brother tim we believe the message yes sir we got the mysteries down we got all the truths we listen to what he asked when but you believe the word of god where it said these signs shall follow them that believe oh even ministers faces will will blush see or are you ashamed to say say of divine healing are you ashamed of the full gospel are you ashamed of your pentecostal experience that 99 of message believers have never had that's being ashamed of his word that's his word made flesh in you remember he tells us invincible union that the only kind that the word can bring forth is those tongue speaking acts 238 blabbering screaming children amen now he tells us in the church age book that the true church will always try to be like the original at pentecost and if there's anything we are aiming for it is not to die it is not to die with the cycle of revival and death it is to go back to life again to break the cycle of recycling death because every age would have its revival and they would die and we see them dying everywhere but i'm going to tell you there's somebody going to be alive and redeemed at the coming of the lord there's somebody going to be an [Applause] might as well be me hallelujah the true church will always try to be like the original of pentacles that's right i want to know what is our church's aiming toward what are we trying to be like what is it our goal what is what is what is it that we're we're aiming what do we want to be like the true church will always try to be like the original of pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one and the messengers to the churches having the same spirit of god in them will try to approximate the apostle paul i wonder if our messenger succeeded or not i think when he went beyond the curtain they told him now you just you preached what paul preached amen so if i messenger approximated the apostle paul amen his church has got to approximate amen the early first one it sees the church it looks like there ought to be a church somewhere that matched her messenger hallelujah there's got to be a people that matches the word hallelujah that you can say we're bone of his bones we're flesh of his flesh we're light of his life we're power of his power but too often we find christ is missing the anointing is gone well brother tim there's not supposed to be revival now well that's true of the healing revival of the 40s and the 50s even by the time brother branham left it was gasping its last breath but that's not true the bride's revival but oh yes but brother jim just quieting down it's a word revival and worth the word revival is just word it's word it's word it's word you mean powerless and meaningless dead lectures amen let me tell you what a word revival does as brother brandon said again in the church age book it is a fact that the prophet for the last days must be bringing forth a message from god that will forerun the second coming of the lord and remember remember he comes as shout voice and trump somebody help me preach so there is a shout in the prophet form bringing the word there is a voice that must be in the pride because she must prophesy again and become the voice of the written word and the spoken word and then there's the trump of god where we're ascending high but what's now he says a message that would forerun did you know brother branham said my mission i believe is for run a coming word which is christ is that right then he tells us that it would be he would forerun a bride spoken words original seed he foreruns the bride so you see he listen he has to come in bribe form before he can come and groom the form we want the meeting in there nobody wants it but the only way he'll ever be is for his bride to step into the word that has been spoken of them there's no other way that's right amen now again let me see if i can get through this quote for you it is a fact the prophet for this last age must be bringing forth a message from god that will forerun the second coming of the lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the pentecostal fathers yes and with the restoration of the work will come the restoration of the power so if it's word word word it has to have power power power power it cannot be a dead laptop it's gonna be [Applause] alive now if it is divine revelation and people say well brother tim we don't have signs of wonder but we got revelation brother we got revelation above everybody we're we're so revelated well here's what true revelation will do satan knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do she can do she can do the greater works she will be hallelujah that's what true revelation will do there'll be a revelation of the power of god it won't be that teaching it will be alive with power with demonstration hallelujah hallelujah they can get the true revelation a man of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before but too often christ is missing that's right the anointing is gone no shout out the king even in the midst that's right brother branham told us from the beginning it wasn't so and you can trace this whole concept and thought all the way to the end because i did but he says what do you find among our kindreds go among the baptists the methodist presbyterian and so forth and and he says see if you find it you don't find him among our kin folks like that that's the only way you you find him is the way mary and joseph found him where they left him and that's where you find him where'd they leave him at the pentecostal feast hallelujah that's where the church will find him again go back to the feast of pentecost go back to the pouring out of the holy ghost there you will find the power of the almighty god you'll find the risen christ you'll find signs and wonders of him just exactly like he said it would be go back to where where you found him go back to the beginning jesus said at the beginning and he's preaching at the beginning it wasn't so john 15 chapter jesus said i'm divine you're the branches now the first branch that came out of that vine they wrote a book of acts out to it they had the power to heal they had to spoke with tongues they interpreted they had visions prophets power they'd done signs that jesus did and if that verse branch come out of that vine was that kind of a branch the next branch will bear the same and every branch it bears will be the same branch amen if we say we are the church of god that will bear record of the first branch heals the vine if you're growing grapes and your first bunch of branches produce grapes your second branch will produce grapes your third branch will produce grapes every branch the trees bear will produce grapes and if the church of the living god that jesus christ set up i said we methodists want to think that's our church we baptist one who thinks it's ours we're pentecostals one of the things is ours we catholics think it's ours let it be what it may be but if we are in that branch we have the same fruits they have you can't get pumpkins off of a grapevine the bind of jesus christ will produce the life of jesus christ for he is the life that is in the vine and we are the branches the first branch that came forth was a pentecostal branch filled with pentecostal power so the impact of the holy ghost they staggered under the impact of the power of god they went forth and saw visions perform miracles open the eyes of the blind heal the sick joy was in the camp they prayed in one accord and all of them together and the building shook where they were assembled show me your church doing that today even the pentecostals are getting so dry they have a little why they have a little ceremonial prayer what we need is a prayer meeting that'll shake the shingles off the top of the house and bring god back in the church again it wasn't so from the beginning all these creeds and cold formal ritualistic all these different things it wasn't so from the beginning jesus set up a church and said these signs shall follow them that believe that was the beginning that's what happened in the beginning if he was here on earth today he would not endorse our creeds and there are things we're doing i would say that you know creed means i believe there's many things that are being professed around in churches today even message churches jesus christ would not endorse and brother branham would never recognize as being his message amen he said he would not endorse her creeds and things were doing he would say it wasn't so from the beginning jesus said in the beginning the works that i do so you do also that's the way it was at the beginning what kind of a works did he do at the beginning the same works that he's doing now what kind of church did he have at the beginning a church that was filled with the spirits that healed the sick prophesied great signs and wonders they weren't ashamed of their religion hello and then they shouted and danced under the spirit like drunk men they had cloven tongues like fire that set upon them they've done signs and wonders and exploits followed them that was the kind it wasn't the beginning that's the kind it'll be in the middle that's the kind it'll be at the last and you say well my church don't teach that it wasn't so from the beginning you say i'm a methodist it wasn't so from the beginning you said i'm baptist it wasn't so from the beginning i'm lutheran it wasn't so from the beginning they were baptized saints of god with the holy ghost that's what the beginning was signs and wonders you say my church don't believe in it it wasn't so from the beginning my church don't see believe in seeing vision it wasn't so from the beginning and my church says days of maryland as it passed it wasn't so from the beginning my church don't believe in the baptism of the holy oath it wasn't solved from the beginning i tell you god wants a people that is consecrated by the power of god let us surrender their intellectuals and let god come in and take over and give a new birth let's go back to the beginning if we want to see the sick healed we want to see signs and wonders of the living christ go back to the beginning where we left him and we left him at the pentecostal feast we've been wandering around 2000 years gentile church ages but there's a people coming back to the beginning hallelujah amen bring us back back to a living faith in a living god with living presence ever with us to the end of the world now you see again this is what i call i don't care you know what you are i don't care what ism you've been in whether you're perugia or whether you're seven thunder coleman's version whether you're where you're this or that or two two lords or or whatever you are go back to the beginning take it back to what paul preached you won't find two lords come on you will you won't find some some idea oh he's already come but we don't know where he's at you you won't find something that you just hear in some word form that that is powerless because it's really not word it's intellectual word has power in it by the word he created a word but things into existence that's what the word does yes hallelujah oh my i tell you what this this is wonderful you say brother tim that was what was that 1960 maybe that was before the seals you know okay united time and sign 1963 august 18th what did he say in malachi 4 would restore restore back the original pentecostal faith back to the people with the same not different the same pentecostal message the same pentecostal sign the same pentecostal evidence the same god same power same treatment everything exactly with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck paul strolled down on the road down to damascus is among us today doing the same thing he did in that day that's what you're united with now i want to remind you brother branham saw the church in a vision he saw it start out in the beginning a virgin walking with the word holy neatly dressed beautiful group of women you know marching to the tune of onwards christian songs then it wasn't long till they begin to march to the beat of another drummer some modern day something another rock and roll stuff amen you said wow brother tim i i don't hear no rock and roll in that church they can be rocking and rolling to some modern day beat that jesus christ isn't the same or he's not here the way he was with brother branham or we're not in the season for miracles that ain't nothing but uh but just backslidden beat of the devil the wrong kind of music i'm going to tell you when the seals were open the bright southern new song hallelujah saying thou are worthy to take the book in the open the seals and thou has made us to our god kings and priests it didn't make us backslidden pure warming just church goers memberships belonging to a church society it produ let me tell you the true gospel produces old-fashioned born again holy ghost glory to god come on hey man you say well brother tim what are you trying to do to get us all to speak in tongues well paul said freaking not speaking in tongues all right man it wasn't hard for you to have that experience brother brandon said if you laid under the altar of god long enough you would sooner or later ever mind if you just get under the altar of god amen he also told us the spies not prophesying despise not speaking in tongues why are we despising it no it's not the evidence no it's not the initial evidence it does it is an evidence of the holy ghost but it's not the evidence but it does you know the holy ghost does speak with genuine tongues hallelujah hallelujah i just punched a button on the radio today and heard a preacher a preacher come on and he said you're down to ziggler and god's gonna restore everything [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] let me tell you if you've been out of line that don't mean you're not bright [Applause] the bride got out of step but the prophet's voice screamed out get back alive get back in line i'm using that prophet's voice get back in line get back in step with the message you walk to the truth of all these better false doctrines we're walking that way with the word [Music] so he said i watched her come down i saw it changed i saw miss america i saw the church of america i saw that backslidden group naked shrimp there's no holy ghost no power of god no gifts of the spirit we despise prophecy we despise speaking in tongues that's the church of america i saw her and he said is this what my message produced and he said i just about fainted and about that time i heard that same music coming again and i heard him say the bride will come back in preview again lord of god i've not been seen i've been seen in a vision walk in and step with the word hallelujah listen to him he said and when she walked by she was exactly like the first one in the first place walk into the step of the music of god's word marching on and i stood with my hands up crying like that came myself on the step on the porch out there looking across the field what she is to be the same bride the same kind built out of the same kind of material that she was in the first place now read malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed to have a message in the last days that had turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers how close brother to him back to the original pentecostal message word by word then he says brothers we are here i want to echo that this morning we are here this is where we are now what all the bride of christ be doing just what all we've seen 60 plus years of kingdom building that removes the power of god from people and made pastors dictators what is all this years of teaching done when we should have had preaching amen demonstrating the gospel so brother tim you teach when i taught my wife received the baptism of the holy ghost and in that same service our first elected deacon brother jerome butts received the baptism of the holy ghost it was no dry word it was the power of god demonstrated god of this evil age brother branham tells us where we should be and what we have let happen and we've let it happen again because the cycle of revival and death never ceases never dies goes right down revival down unto death but god's going to have somebody to break the cycle how do you know that because he said i'll have a bride without spot a wrinkle because he said of them that alive and remain now she has caused the whole church to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program and that's what we've had educational programs educating oh these greek words and this and that and the other and we got this and brother you better be saying this right no now we're going to introduce another greek word this week and you know we just got forms of doctrine and whatever satan under has given her under a name of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program i'm pitching to you the god of this world when she has eve had the very filling of god's word in her hands she could have took god's word but what did she do to that instead of carrying for the baptism of the holy ghost let science prove to her the holy ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping divine healing going when she ought to be now raising the dead and doing great miracles she has let satan under his leadership of religious man take the word of god and try to say that it was for another age and they have believed it now what will the church be doing not only should it be the book of acts be our example of holy ghost power it should be our textbook you know it should be it should be the uh our text because it defines the triumphs of the name of jesus the acts of the holy ghost the disciples in the book of acts had authority that was granted to them from heaven that was conferred on them by jesus christ himself amen they were endued with power from on high these men after receiving the holy ghost they didn't wait on the squeeze of persecution to come and to give them power you know why that would make god tomorrow but not god today first of all this if the squeeze of persecution brings faith for a rapture and the works of god then the dark ages should have been raptured with that brutal persecution and if so then that would have been the thing that would have started the rapture in faith for the going away if persecution can do it second i'm fully aware that brother branham pondered and um and surmised that the third pull of his ministry would be manifested during a squeeze or but at the feast of the trumpets he turns a corner as joshua he's given division of the land you know certain parts we don't fulfill all the parts of the bible there is a in the book of revelation that we we will not fulfill there is a foolish virgin a multitude without number in the tribulation we will not fulfill there is a hundred and forty four thousand that and that are to the jews and and they will fulfill that not us so you want you got to know you know your borders of your land because the land is big you know there's land from moab there's land over here for esau come on esau is also a seat of abraham there's land for the ishmaelites there's land for the moabites this children of lot they they also are coming down and receiving blessings somebody with me i'm but then but then there's the seed of abraham and what land are they given i mean when they went into the land he said don't you try to take esau's portion it's not yours don't possess it i won't bless you now don't try to take these others that is not your land i will define your borders and joshua was given from the definition of the borders word that it goes and he was given the landmarks now god sent in this day a prophetic ministry and it would also be as a joshua i know joe coleman thought he was the joshua you know that's going to bring us into into a higher uh higher order and all of that these are liars he didn't bring into him bringing the higher order he took them back in the depths of sin and unbelief i i don't mean to be ugly i i'm speaking truthful and sometimes you just have to talk truth and so you know again you know there was let me just say in that you know when there was no other man in this day that i'm aware of that the bible comes down out of heaven and the page is turning and as the page is turning it turns to joshua chapter one and as it does a finger goes down from verse 1 down through about verse 9 saying as i was with moses so will i be with you you know don't be don't fail don't be discouraged amen be of good courage for i have given you the land if there was anybody that we should recognize as as being the joshua to give us the definitions of the border of the land it should be the prophet of malachi 4 who was not only elijah but he was also the joshua to place us in our inheritance and there at the feast of the trumpet you know brother branham turns a corner he said you know it was revealed him those trumpets were to the jews and they received their persecution in a physical literal manner to drive them back to their homeland while the bride spiritual israel receives theirs in an ecclesiastical manner that's from the pulpit people beat from the pulpit killed from the pulpit people burned up in furnaces at the pulpit a holocaust from the pulpit ecclesiastical and so have we been beat and abused and imprisoned and many are dead from false ecclesiastical attacks from the pulpit against the movement of the holy spirit with false apostles and false teachers rising up claiming greater revelation than the prophet some deifying brother branham and others denying the deity of jesus christ what an awful evil spirit so until they're so confused when with such blind with double vision that they have two lords and two jehovah's and two jesus what kind of confusion is that i tell you what you need to myself that only malachi 4 the seventh angel can bring to put in your eyes as i preach this i'm not in in any way saying i'm the only pebble on the beach listen you don't ever have to even hear the name of tim pruitt to be saved or go in the rapture you got to know jesus amen i'm not trying to build a kingdom here i'm trying to point you to christ but let me just say neither if you have seat belts on it might get kind of stormy on this plane ride we might have some turbulence here it might upset some of you neither did the disciples wait on the third pull to come so they could have power unless let me qualify that unless the third pole pulled them into christ they pulled them into christ was justification and another pull into sanctification and then the third pull happens in the soul the with the realm of the baptism of the holy ghost because that's where you receive power only there with the baptism of the holy ghost as the third pull work in case you think i'm way out of line go listen to there is a man here that can turn on the light and brother branham uses this analogy and as for waiting on the third pull i want to declare to you it's already come in fact it's here not coming it's here it is now you know why because god's word is always now it was manifested five different times where the word was showed in its power was speaking creation speaking life resurrection life little fish speaking healing sister branham speaking salvation had it right amen by the way that still works there's many a time as i spoke the word as i preached souls ran to the altar and had the same experience that he talked about had he writes children having i want to tell you every child of god who has been born again by the holy ghost has had a spoken word experience peter said you are born not a corruptible seed but of the word of god that liveth and abideth forever [Applause] my birth is a spoken word birth not my physical one my spiritual one and then finally speaking to storms which changes atmospheres now that shows the power of the speak in the word that was given to us as a sword which would just fit brother branham's hand because that message is our message and that sword is our sword now the third pull brother branham actually talks about it in the past since 10th sense and and as just before he leaves the scene and the anointed ones at the end time he said the first poll was healing the second poll prophesying third paul the opening of the word the mystery's revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way a prophet can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word amen so you see the their pool has already come it opened up the word it took the the seals off the book and opened the land to us that was the third phase of brother branham's ministry and now we're not in the first pool where the signs in the hand we are not in the second poll where there's prophesying discerning the hearts we are in the third pull which is the opening of the word the seven seals opening up the mysteries of the word wiping out the debt against us so all the false doctrines and the liens that was against us was removed from the title so that you have received the same open book that paul had which brings us i know sometimes you say brother them nothing goes way over my head i've got to preach it to you and get it maybe sometimes i just need to sit down with some of you one on one just find out where you're missing it at this is not hard this is not rocket science this is the word of god and that opens us up to exactly where paul was where he says we are now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus where where are the middle ages didn't have deprivedness at the beginning it's the pride at the end you say there's no more innocence nobody has an intercessor like [Music] us now let me just go on neither do they wait on some future adoption word that they would finally get enough faith to believe oh we'll grow up one day brother tim you know look we just can't overcome all this sin and that stuff and you know we just adding our faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and i mean you know we got to grow up and this is what's the matter with our churches brother tim you know it's just that they're immature and you know they ain't grown up there they got the holy ghost and you know they've been baptized with the holy ghost but they just can't overcome their uh you know they drink a little wine and wine here and they won't attend church none and you know they just um you know i tell you what they they just um struggle with with sex sins and i i just tell my church you know brother tim i just tell them you know you've got to let the the word abide in you richly and you're just not letting him abide and you know i got you know we got to have some you're all right you're all right brother you know sister you're all right you you just need to grow up a little bit but one day one day we're going to get this adoption and we'll uh we'll be adopted since then devil had to hide from us then but now we're kind of cowered around in the corner when cancer comes hello the disciples the book of acts church didn't wait on some future adoption where they'd get faith enough to believe that faith was born in them by the holy ghost [Applause] hallelujah these are just excuses we got to wait till the squeeze come we got to wait till the bride comes into power we got to wait until we got to wait until we're mature enough we got to grow up we're just immature now it's just not the season you know because we're nobody's got the faith this is kind of unbelief being preached it's worse than alexander campbell with the church of christ because they're using quotes to try to make it happen let me just tell you my brother the apostles didn't make excuses or we are too immature but one day we're when we're mature or we're waiting on adoption let me stop for a minute again you know that that's it we we got the holy ghost we got it when we believe the words you know and so we didn't really know it we just believe the word and we we just believe we got it and so because we accepted the message and because we believe god sent a prophet and it's the revelation and i i accept this revelation well i now have the holy ghost you know because uh the holy ghost will believe the word you know and it say amen say amen amen that's right that's right that's right i i don't understand that i have no idea what you're talking about but amen because i got the holy ghost well i can't live right but one day i'll get adopted one day i'll be one day i remember it was 1985. and yeah i don't know my my genealogy says i got a little cherokee in me and i must have pulled up the hatchet but it was late in 1984 i went to tucson meeting and there i watched a man you know that was put up there because he had some money and he could talk because he had some money and he was doing scams and he wound up you know wound up being put in prison for it and he had some cohorts there with him two of them that was um there was actually three that was a fellow by the name of ernie villanueva the other was ron nordone and the other was arne marcioni and arnie got up in that meeting and he said well praise god i got the holy ghost he as i tell you i got the holy ghost here you know i know i've been baptized because i've received the message i'll tell you but you know i got this little problem with smoking and i really can't i really care you know one day god just take it from me one day i'll just get my faith in it it'll just get you know it'll just go away but i got the holy ghost praise god i got it he's making a witness like that why when i witnessed ernie here you know i tell you he was in the full gospel businessmen meeting and i sat down with him at a table i thought i would help him out a little bit because what he said sounded like eagle food and he said so i i said to him what are you he said well i'm upc and i and ernie deville in the waiver said yeah i'm upc and he said well do you know god sent a prophet no i didn't know god sent a prophet well he got to trying to talk to him he couldn't explain it you know he got his words all tunneled tangled up and you know ernie just kept putting him in this you know putting him down putting him down use the scripture that scripture and arnie gets home you know upset just just just a minute he walks out the door goes outside grabs him a joint of marijuana he smokes his marijuana oh he's anointed now he walks back in and he he's on fire now and he sits right there and he said all right god's in a prophet and here's his message and i'm going to give you a bunch of books well ernie took him said well maybe i can help this poor guy but my goodness he you know he thinks he's anointed because he got a joint ain't that awful that we have to get a joint of marijuana to get anointed so it was in june of 1985. let me let me just tell you so anyway you know he gave this book these parcels of books this is their testimony gave this parcel of books or gave a few books to to um ernie and ernie read them and he said well man this is good stuff he said where'd you get this he said you like it i can bring you more and he brought him boxes he went to he was taking a little vacation and our brother ernie started reading and he read one read another read another read another read another read another by the time you read it he was convinced the message was true i was preaching a meeting in 1985 to the youth camp in ohio youth camp and they asked me to come along with them for lunch well i'd already heard their testimony in tucson it didn't bide well with me and as we was riding along you know they were going to the to a restaurant they stayed in the home of a greek man who owned a greek restaurant and he it was rich i mean you know he had this beautiful elaborate this beautiful elaborate restaurant and they fed us a nice meal and you know i'm preaching all the way i'm getting every word i can to ernie arnie and ron these three men i'm getting every word i can i go to telling them ezekiel 36 26 i go tell them about a new heart and a new spirit and my spirit and i tell them you might have got my spiri you might have got a new spirit of i want to do right you might have got into where your intellect says that the word is true you might have got a new heart where you desire have a new desire and want to do right and there's some of you sitting in that condition today but you'll go to hell if you'll miss the rapture if you don't get the holy ghost [Music] do you hear what i'm saying amen but there as i talked to them i said but i said there's some something you're missing you cannot have the holy ghost and still smoking arnie you cannot have the holy ghost and get anointed with marijuana you cannot have the holy ghost and you're still sipping wine with your competitors or your businessmen you cannot live that kind of life and have the holy ghost already i don't care how much you got the holy you claim to have it you don't have it i don't care how much you believe the word you don't have it we went from that restaurant into a place to the greek people's home we got there in a dinner living room one most exquisite furniture i ever seen most beautiful house i hadn't seen one like today it was ornate it was beautiful great furniture then the men we sat down on the couch we were having a drink of water for for a refreshment or some maybe some coffee or something and here i am and i'm still preaching new heart new spirit my spirit and when my spirit comes he'll cause you to walk in my statures and keep my judgment and do them it won't be you trying anymore it'll be the law of god written in your heart you won't have to work at it anymore you won't have to try to be good you'll hate sin and you'll let righteousness because i write it in your nature and i write it in your life and the holy spirit fell in that place there and i'll tell you them men begin to cry and weep and snot all over that exquisite furniture and i'm saying oh my but i'm still praying for him amen and i got her i got ernie ernieville in the waiver by the neck to the nap of the net and i said this man has been a pentecostal but he needs the baptism of the holy ghost and i got a hold of him until god got a hold of him hallelujah it changed his life forever it changed mercy on it forever it took away cigarette marijuana sin everything else that made a new creature out of it hallelujah that's the power of the book of acts that's the power of this word that's the power of deliverance hallelujah you don't have to take second best amen you can have every promise that god gave you can have a dirt pool experience when you're baptized with the holy ghost and you receive power hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus there's worshiping come on just give me praise just a moment thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus it shall be light in the evening time hallelujah i'll pour out my spirit upon my flesh my sons and my daughters they were prophesied amen it's god's word is his promise i will restore saith the lord amen he'll restore health he'll restore amen he's a restorer he'll restore my wife he's restored hell yeah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] thank you thank you jesus amen you think that's how to order a little bit just go listen to this day the scripture's fulfilled they have to do the same thing there [Applause] amen god bless you can be seated now i still got a little more time here on the clock hallelujah now so as i said neither did they wait on some future adoption when they would finally get enough faith to believe that faith was born in them by the holy ghost so i'm just saying brothers out there as you're listening to me don't make excuses the apostles didn't make excuses that we're too immature but one day we'll be when we are mature one day when we're waiting on adoption or persecution the squeeze will make us believe that's catholicism if you think you're going to have to pay for something to get this faith by doing some kind of penance going through some type of persecution then you're a catholic in your faith brother branham told us and thou knowest all things he says ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of god where you're sealed to the day of redemption how many can say that's me amen let the devil kick you around that's the trouble of it today another christian person sitting there sick if they only knew they were sons and daughters of god now living with christ not you will be now you are the sons of god you got the full pentecostal blessing the day of pentecost fully come 1900 years ago and never left and never will till jesus comes now is the hour now is the time now is accepted our this is acceptable year of the lord now is when healing is supposed to be now is when miracles take place now is when christ is revealing himself here we are now not in the future the devil keeps pushing it at all that catholicism now is the day this is the hour this is the time this is the place right now this is the day amen now all the preachers have made excuses for where there is no power no gifts the real reason is because of dead sermons and dead sermons kill so well we're preaching doctrine brother tim so you know we're teaching doctrine what jesus doctrine was a lot different from the pharisees and our doctrine should be a lot different from denominations are you with me because mark 1 27 says that the it says the people that heard him exclaimed what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him so if we're preaching the doctrine of jesus amen it is a doctrine with authority over devils sickness disease sin you know what brother tim you're you're really too shallow you know you just you just preach faith you're just so shallow that's all you do just preach faith faith faith there's nothing deep about it well i'll tell you you've got to preach faith to have faith amen and faith is of great necessity because without faith it's impossible to please god and besides that whatsoever is not a faith is a sin amen so i'd love rather be preaching faith to you than i believe uh-huh amen because you're one doing one another you're either preaching faith or doubt amen the disciples had received power we know and authority after the holy ghost was given to them and they would act in his name the first recorded use of that authority was with authoritative words from that peter used to command the lame man to walk and and that when he rose up and walked that moved the city it took jerusalem but it showed that that name has power and that his children have the right to use that man notice what it is it showed they were the children of god it showed they had the right to use that name and it showed that that name had power in it now peter used his authority and the power of that name to strike a man or a woman dead for lying there was awesome power in that name there was power to heal power to slay power to rise up and power to cast down amen now you think that's only history that only happened back then brother branham and his last words to the messenger to this age and the message communion said the hour will soon arise when right among us will be the holy spirit will speak out like an anonymous fire remember that the hour is arriving now you just remember that that god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now amen now paul he he calls blindness to come upon the opposers he cast demons from the mediums he was bit by a viper and it did him no harm the sick were healed the dead were raised and whole heathen cities came to know the unknown god jesus christ amen the gospel went everywhere in power it was backed by the by the power of the name aprons were touched by paul that were laid on the sick and did the same mighty acts through as the paul was there the same happens today you know amen the same day sister atlanta was healed of non-hodgkin's lymph lymphoma and minds went back to the next day a new creation had taken place brand new sales totally new lungs you say brother tim it's impossible for your wife to live it ain't impossible for my god new brain cells hallelujah it only takes a moment only takes a moment just one moment in his presence one moment hallelujah i know one moment in prison he changed my life forever wow we were going on that service and i was preaching on an extreme god doing a god doing extreme things you know there we were we prayed i prayed over a prayer cloth for a little preacher brother in south africa and needed a job his wife had stage three rectal cancer i sent that and we prayed over it that day sent it in the mail there he received it in the name of jesus he got a job that had been waiting on him two years hey man he had a his wife was healed of third stage cervical cancer a rectal cancer he got a job his wife was healed and during the covet outbreak last year he took that same prayer cloth and went and drove 400 miles to lay on a dying brother gasping his last breath under a ventilator in a south african hospital and he lives hallelujah he lives there's a little family right now listening to us from australia and listen listen i'm not their pastor and i don't want to be i'm not there i'm not their their leader i don't want to be i want to point them to jesus christ but this little sister from australia wrote a receiving a prayer cloth that we prayed over here and sent of a daughter who was so oppressed of the devil and she and she wrote me back the other day and said brother tim my child is a different child no more depression no more anxiety she communicates with us now she is happy and we can't ever remember her being so happy and free what almighty god we serve absolutely incredible thank you jesus hallelujah so the gospel paul preached still works today hallelujah those book of acts christians were human just like we are it wasn't superhumans they were humans just like me and you a man they had passions like ours they made mistakes like we do they got rebuked yet they wrought miracles by the authority given to them by a holy ghost birth they were sons they understood their sonship they took authority over demons and diseases preachers were dangerous in that day amen christians had power to prove their claims i mean they pray what they preach they practice amen they delivered the goods their faith stood not in word only but in demonstration and power miracles were the common order of the day they were baptized with the same holy ghost the same one that filled jesus and gave him power amen they were like their master they didn't have empty doctrines they didn't go and just pass out books and tapes but their doctrine was more than word only remember with power and with demonstration of the holy ghost it was it was that alpha church then then why should not this omega church be the same come on why would we be any different if that's what the book of acts did then then why should the people of the book be any different every demon and an angel is subject to the matchless name of jesus i mean believes that amen he gave us the power of authority to use his name amen and his name is mighty all of our all our authority is based on his finished work come on not what brother branham did but what jesus did at calvary amen and his authority is a based on his finished work but it's all encapsulated in his name and by giving us the legal use of his name now get this get this this is where we have come where they have not denied his name you got women today that they still want their their their maiden name they want to include they want you to know there's something different than their husband that's not the bride come on amen no you know he gave us his leg legal name to use see when i baptize and i baptize the aaron ogles me i don't baptize him in the name of ogles be jesus when i baptized joe adams i didn't baptize him in the name of adam's jesus when you're married to christ you forget your past identity [Applause] and you accept his identity and you say the all life is dead and i'm a new in christ and now the two have become one blessed under the same name i'm getting you somewhere so when you take on the name of jesus you have the same family name jesus had [Applause] hallelujah are you with me amen so all of our authority is enraft in his name by giving us the legal use of this name he has put omnipotence at our disposal in order that we can combat the satanic host that's right amen now here's how he defines our legal authority we shall cast out demons that means authority over demons in their relation to men cast them out of people's bodies break their power over those bodies over their minds over their spirits break their powers over over our meetings amen there's been many times i've had to preach and break the devil's power first amen break the power over our homes over our communities i want to send a word to you in south africa where rioting and looting and destruction has been going on and you're listening to me now hell cannot break out until the bride is lifted from the earth there were pillars of fire in acts chapter 2. there are pillars of fire in acts chapter in revelation chapter 10. so in the alpha church there there were pillars of fire in the omega church there are pillars of fire the anointing comes down a man upon the land and upon the sea what two beast powers arises one of them is the roman power and god how many can testify god gave us power over the roman doctrines he gave us power over her false trinity he gave us power over her naveena's and her saints and all the the trinity triune gods he gave us power he put our feet by giving us the pillar of fire each one of you have got your feet on the denominational spirit [Applause] amen and then this come on there's the land and the sea so that was out of the seed the multitude nation kinder tongues and people that's symbology in the bible the land is where no people come out america that ecumenical spirit we're all the same we're just this rainbow color we're just you know there's no black or white this is a pale horse you see you know you're neither male nor female and you can decide whatever you want to be because you know it's so mixed in the colors and it's such a deceiving spirit you know and it's it's neither black and it's not white and you can be anything you want to be and so here you are american spirit american idols feminism rising up in power until we got a woman who is vice president no doubt soon we'll be president i saw her rising up royal purples but i want to tell you that beast that rises up out of america cannot come full power until a bride is lifted up into a rapture because as long as she is here they are under our feet your very presence keeps the devil at bay and he cannot come in the full power until the bride is lifted up then satan comes down and has been a short time but as long as we are here he can't take over because there is a book of that church hallelujah because there is a people who know their god and who does exploit because their people feminine has no power over them amen political rams has no power over them and then homosexualism has no power over them and man the pale horse has no power over them amen why they are an eagle they're anointed with an eagle to rise up to fly up in the heavenlies where all things are possible for them to believe i declare to you today every devil is under your feet i declare you sicknesses under your feet sin is under your feet because you have been filled with a pillar of fire let the musicians come hallelujah hallelujah amen the book of acts continues we go forth in his name and nothing can stop us not even death because if death comes he will raise us up again [Applause] there is a new testament church she's rising she's not falling she's not a part of the fallen world she's a part of a rapture bride hallelujah our combat's not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers trying to keep us from our place trying to convince you you're not worthy trying to convince you that you're powerless and helpless now you are the sons of god we are not powerless we're not helpless the devil is powerless he cannot take my wife's life he cannot take her life god holds that in his hands it's not even his decision whether she graduates or whether she continues days on the earth the devil has no part in her she didn't become eternal on april 11 1976 she always was eternal she could never die believe us now this yeah lord i believe that you are the resurrection of the life and even now lord whatever you say that's the way it will be hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord crazy hallelujah just take a moment worshiping just a moment let your
