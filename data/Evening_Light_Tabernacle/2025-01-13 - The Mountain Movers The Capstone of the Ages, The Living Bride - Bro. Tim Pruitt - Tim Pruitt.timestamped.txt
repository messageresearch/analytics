[47:32] Lord that I was yours before the world

[47:38] sunship is so important to us we know it
[47:41] didn't happen down at an altar
[47:44] somewhere but Lord it happened oh God in
[47:49] the Eternal
[47:51] ages Way Beyond Before
[47:54] Time When there we were attribute of you
[47:58] and then down at an altar someplace
[48:02] somewhere an altar in our hearts perhaps
[48:05] you revealed to us our
[48:07] sunship Lord we thank you for Grace
[48:11] we're asking for your anointing today
[48:14] because it's the anointing of God that
[48:16] breaks the Yoke break the Yoke of sin
[48:19] unbelief offer our lives Lord as often
[48:23] the prophet of God was would stand and
[48:26] pray in Lord forgive me of my
[48:28] sins I I don't think at all that it was
[48:32] some Grievous awful sin Lord that would
[48:37] maybe that we would look at like oh God
[48:40] adultery or smoking drinking ly cussing
[48:43] like that but Lord just the unbelief in
[48:47] our
[48:48] hearts Lord we stagger sometimes at the
[48:52] promise but may it be like Abraham that
[48:55] threw the cross
[48:58] Lord that it could be written of us that
[49:01] after we come through the blood that we
[49:03] stagger not at the promise of God
[49:05] through unbelief but is strong in faith
[49:08] given praise to God I pray Lord you'll
[49:11] find faith in our hearts today that
[49:14] you'll reveal yourself through the word
[49:16] Lord and you'll make yourself great
[49:18] among your people deliver your children
[49:21] Lord there are those that we heard a
[49:23] prayer requests today and we know there
[49:26] are those that are shuttin that can't
[49:29] come and Lord some that are are miles
[49:32] away and aren't able to assemble Lord

[49:39] know Lord you'll bless your people oh
[49:41] God and you'll minister to them I also
[49:43] know present would be those that would
[49:46] listen in from different places that is
[49:48] icy conditions and they can't go to
[49:51] church and and they will be tuning in to
[49:55] our service today
[49:57] I pray Lord that it'll be more than them
[50:00] tuning in but you'll tune their hearts
[50:03] to the promise of the word and Lord that
[50:06] you'll work in their midst and you'll
[50:08] drop right down in this with them as
[50:11] they have service together with us may
[50:14] you appear Lord may you appear in this
[50:17] place today where the presence of God
[50:20] can be so real and so fresh anoint us a
[50:24] new oh God we stand here Lord in the in
[50:27] the last day and we're needing you
[50:30] father oh God so we're asking that you
[50:32] would Minister to hearts and lives as we
[50:35] open up the word Lord open up the pages
[50:38] of our hearts and write it in it so that
[50:41] we and the word are the same we ask it
[50:43] in Jesus name amen and amen amen God
[50:48] bless you in it wonderful to be in the
[50:51] house of the Lord and have this
[50:53] privilege that we have of serving him
[50:56] and
[50:57] and um and looking into the things of
[51:00] God thank you God bless you so
[51:02] appreciated the the songs and and the
[51:04] worship to the Lord and amen I I believe
[51:08] that he dwells in the Praises of his
[51:10] people he comes near as we worship Him
[51:13] and amen I pray that he'll come and draw
[51:16] night to you today and here's the thing
[51:18] about it he said you draw night to God
[51:21] and he'll draw night to you amen so if
[51:24] you'll just make a move toward him this
[51:25] morning I I know that he will he will
[51:29] move in your heart amen so if you'll
[51:32] turn with me to again to Zechariah 4
[51:35] we'll look at verse 4 and 6 and quickly
[51:38] move on from there and says then
[51:41] answered and spake unto me saying this
[51:44] is the word of the Lord unto zeruel
[51:47] saying not by might nor my power but by
[51:51] my spirit sayth the Lord of host who art
[51:55] thou oh great m Mountain before
[51:57] zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and
[52:00] he shall be bring forth The Headstone
[52:02] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[52:06] Grace unto it amen makes me think of
[52:09] that song we just saying Grace Grace
[52:13] God's grace let me show you another
[52:16] Capstone it's a bride without spot or
[52:19] wrinkle or any such things and she will
[52:22] be the Capstone Church of the ages so
[52:26] we're going to speak on that today the
[52:28] Capstone of the ages the living bride if
[52:32] you'll turn with me to First
[52:33] Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 we will
[52:37] see this church she is also the bride of
[52:42] Jesus Christ especially in this day
[52:44] where we use a designation between
[52:46] church and bride Church going to those
[52:50] through the tribulation bride being
[52:52] those who would be married to to the
[52:54] word the word would become their head
[52:56] and they would be United with him and go
[53:00] go to the marriage supper the lamb but
[53:03] yet at the same time you know what he
[53:06] said he said um I will build a church
[53:11] that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[53:14] against so he uses the word church
[53:17] church church church church always but
[53:20] in this day because there is a division
[53:24] and a separation a lot of times we will
[53:27] refer to the church as being those who
[53:31] will go through the tribulation and that
[53:33] multitude without number but I want you
[53:36] to know this bride is the true church
[53:40] amen that's who she is first
[53:42] Thessalonians 4:13 but I would not have
[53:45] you to be ignorant Brethren concerning
[53:48] them that are asleep that you sorrow not
[53:52] even as others who have no hope now when
[53:55] Paul wrote this there were very few that
[53:59] were asleep now they were slipping away
[54:01] one at a time here and there and
[54:03] whatever but there was actually very few
[54:05] of them because the Old Testament Saints
[54:09] had been risen remember if one Old
[54:12] Testament Saint had to REM had remain
[54:16] out of the presence of God in a in a
[54:18] place of of where the blood had not
[54:22] cleansed then Jesus blood was not able
[54:25] to compl completely eradicate sin but it
[54:29] doesn't matter it doesn't matter where
[54:31] where you were born or what you were or
[54:33] where you died or whatever else you know
[54:36] every child of God there in that that
[54:40] went to Paradise there under Abraham's
[54:43] bosom rose up with him so the Bible said
[54:45] many of the Saints that's because many
[54:48] that they thought were Saints weren't
[54:51] Saints but I'll tell you what all of the
[54:54] Saints rose with him he didn't leave a
[54:58] one he completely cleared the debt of
[55:01] the Old Testament aren't you glad for a
[55:03] god like that he'll clear the debt for
[55:05] you today amen but I want you to look
[55:08] here as they were saying ah these that
[55:11] are asleep so you should sorrow not even
[55:14] as others who have no hope aren't you
[55:16] glad for that hope we have for if we
[55:20] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[55:23] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[55:26] now this has been God's body his Temple
[55:30] that he's been building for Seven Ages
[55:33] and most of them now sleep in
[55:37] Jesus amen of the great number that will
[55:42] actually be in the great Rapture
[55:44] ahead there will be the greatest number
[55:48] coming from those that are sleeping
[55:50] Jesus there will be just a few that will
[55:53] be alive and remain
[55:56] but I tell you he says those that are
[55:59] asleep in Jesus will God bring with him
[56:02] now another group now that we want to
[56:05] talk about this Capstone that I want to
[56:07] speak about that we want to describe
[56:11] today she's at the top that capts off
[56:15] the others those who sleep in Jesus were
[56:19] a part of the
[56:20] building and we're using this term very
[56:23] Loosely now you know because in reality
[56:25] Christ himself caps off the church as he
[56:29] is the head of the body but before he
[56:32] comes Christ will be
[56:35] here in a physical
[56:41] form in a physical
[56:43] form now not in the body of
[56:47] Jesus but in the body of his bride the
[56:51] church
[56:56] think about that you are living in the
[57:00] bride coming of
[57:02] Christ is where he manifest himself
[57:05] completely in Bride form in a
[57:10] people now as we look at this we we know
[57:15] that these last ones these people who
[57:19] are alive and remain they will be the
[57:23] finishing stones
[57:26] watch now verse 15 for this we say unto
[57:29] you by the word of the Lord oh this is
[57:33] absolute that we which are alive and
[57:37] remain you see this
[57:39] group unto the coming of the Lord they
[57:41] shall not prevent them that are
[57:45] asleep but for the Lord himself shall
[57:48] descend from heaven with a shout that's
[57:51] a message and that message will God
[57:54] gather God's elect from all four winds
[57:58] or four directions of the Earth where
[58:01] will it gather them to brother Tim to
[58:03] evening light Tabernacle no it'll gather
[58:06] them into
[58:08] Christ so again the the shout is the
[58:12] Gathering of the elect of God back to
[58:15] the word
[58:16] again so and with the voice of the
[58:21] Archangel ah Archangel that's
[58:24] interesting because only in Revelation
[58:27] 10 do you see the Archangel appeared in
[58:30] the last day the mighty Angel
[58:33] Christ and then he says and then with
[58:36] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[58:39] shall rise
[58:41] first then we which are alive and remain
[58:44] shall be caught up together with them in
[58:48] the
[58:49] clouds not rain clouds not storm clouds
[58:54] but Clouds Of Glory yes to meet the Lord
[58:57] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[59:02] the Lord God bless you you can be
[59:05] seated now as we are looking at this
[59:09] today you know we had just a moment ago
[59:12] a wonderful wonderful um testimony of
[59:16] our brother Tim Winters
[59:19] and and it reminded me of in my studies
[59:23] this week as I looked at a something
[59:27] about that would go right along with
[59:30] this because you know you are looking
[59:32] for mountains to be moved in your life
[59:36] some of it is sickness or that you need
[59:39] healing or Deliverance or whatever
[59:41] you're looking for mountains to be moved
[59:44] and a lot of times you're wanting these
[59:46] mountains to be moved
[59:49] instantaneously or
[59:52] spontaneously but I I want you to listen
[59:55] to the prophet of God when he talked
[59:57] about your healing and here we're going
[1:00:00] in this just for a moment just deviating
[1:00:03] into this thought to go with brother
[1:00:05] Tim's testimony he says now lots of
[1:00:08] people they say pray for me brother all
[1:00:11] right Lord help this dear brother give
[1:00:14] them a prayer cloth and best you can and
[1:00:16] he seen others healed right night after
[1:00:19] night and time after time but I didn't
[1:00:23] get it so I'll try again tomorrow night
[1:00:26] Oh my he says you discredit God you
[1:00:31] discredit his word watch if you believe
[1:00:35] in your heart that it's being done maybe
[1:00:39] that mountain looks just exactly like it
[1:00:41] always look but in your heart you
[1:00:44] believe it there might not be but one
[1:00:47] little grain of sand but something is
[1:00:50] tearing
[1:00:51] loose amen you see something's beginning
[1:00:55] to take Place see when we believe that
[1:00:58] it's being done but you see we want
[1:01:00] something spontaneous and what do we do
[1:01:04] what do we get left out left out because
[1:01:07] it weakens so you know when you don't
[1:01:09] immediately see a result you said well
[1:01:13] God didn't hear well God does and God
[1:01:17] responds and remember your mountain is
[1:01:21] already
[1:01:23] moving whatever you've been praying
[1:01:25] about your mountain is already moving
[1:01:28] you may not see the results yet maybe
[1:01:31] you're looking for changes in your
[1:01:33] family maybe you're looking for a wife
[1:01:36] who is who is uh out from under the the
[1:01:39] the realm of Grace and you're you got a
[1:01:42] confusion in your family and everything
[1:01:45] else well well you know let me tell you
[1:01:48] your mountain is moving the moment you
[1:01:50] prayed things begin to
[1:01:53] happen but you see you got to stand
[1:01:56] there keeping believing no matter what
[1:01:58] you see it may get worse she may go on
[1:02:02] the Tantrum she may she may just go wild
[1:02:05] and go and leave you your children may
[1:02:07] just go wild no matter what you
[1:02:12] see amen you may see your condition in
[1:02:15] your flesh get worse no matter what you
[1:02:18] see you believe it's being
[1:02:22] done I can't see the results I I can't
[1:02:26] feel the results in fact my feelings are
[1:02:29] telling me
[1:02:31] different but I am taking God at his
[1:02:34] word he said I so I have spoke to this
[1:02:38] mountain and this mountain is moving in
[1:02:40] my life amen and maybe I don't see big
[1:02:44] results yet it doesn't matter one grain
[1:02:47] at a time but one day it'll be one grain
[1:02:50] two grains 10 grains several fulls you
[1:02:53] know truckloads full and finally you you
[1:02:55] know on and on and on until half the
[1:02:57] Mountain's gone and then it's all
[1:03:00] gone you just keep confessing you keep
[1:03:04] looking now when we're talking about
[1:03:06] this wonderful Capstone here that
[1:03:09] Zachariah is preaching about and uh and
[1:03:12] he's prophesying of zerubabel and and as
[1:03:16] you know this has been an insurmountable
[1:03:19] Mountain it looks like Jerusalem will
[1:03:21] never be restored and things will never
[1:03:24] take place you know it's been years now
[1:03:27] in Ruins and there isn't even anybody
[1:03:30] that can be around to tell you how it
[1:03:32] even looked and where these Stones going
[1:03:34] and how it's going to
[1:03:36] be and he's got a mighty task in front
[1:03:39] of him it's
[1:03:41] insurmountable it's a
[1:03:43] mountain and zachariah's prophesy and
[1:03:46] said it's going to be
[1:03:47] moved this mountain is going to be moved
[1:03:51] and it won't be by man's might man's
[1:03:53] Wisdom Man's power but it'll be by my
[1:03:56] spirit sayith the Lord God's doing this
[1:03:59] oh if we could just realize for a moment
[1:04:02] God's got this he's got your situation
[1:04:06] he understands what need that you have
[1:04:08] in your life and you'll commit your way
[1:04:10] to him he'll go to working on it and he
[1:04:14] says he says by my spirit sayeth the
[1:04:17] Lord so you know here again um this was
[1:04:21] he said you're going to even see the
[1:04:23] Capstone you're going to see the
[1:04:24] finishing star
[1:04:26] zable because it it's going to come and
[1:04:30] and remember how it's going to come it's
[1:04:31] going to be Grace Grace unto it now when
[1:04:37] we're talking about capstones you're
[1:04:38] usually about three different things and
[1:04:40] I want to go over this again because
[1:04:43] people miss it and and so I'm trying to
[1:04:45] get get you on board so listen carefully
[1:04:48] don't let somebody distract you but you
[1:04:51] know there there are three different
[1:04:54] ways that brother Brandon use this
[1:04:56] Capstone for different things and and of
[1:05:00] course you can't mix them you got to
[1:05:02] realize they're not all the same thing
[1:05:04] but they're all for to to to bring forth
[1:05:07] the right thing and one is of course in
[1:05:10] our day we had many many mysteries of
[1:05:14] God that was that was um uh that was
[1:05:18] veiled and covered up and and in
[1:05:21] confusion and so you see God would have
[1:05:25] to actually send an Elijah Prophet to
[1:05:29] restore the Altar and put the stones
[1:05:31] back in place sacrifice back in place
[1:05:34] and every everything back in position
[1:05:37] and then the fire would fall and
[1:05:38] vindicate it so you know again so God
[1:05:43] would God would again in this day we had
[1:05:46] a lot of stones that was to go and and
[1:05:50] Luther had been working in his day and
[1:05:52] he put the stone of justification in and
[1:05:55] sanctification under Wesley and
[1:05:57] restoration of the gifts under the
[1:05:59] Pentecostal zusa Street era but brother
[1:06:02] Bram looked at it and he said now
[1:06:04] there's going to come a Capstone and
[1:06:07] this Capstone will be seven Thunders
[1:06:10] which are seven voices of God that will
[1:06:14] cap off the mysteries of God so seven
[1:06:17] Thunders are the
[1:06:20] Capstone amen and it's something we had
[1:06:23] to receive in this day in order to
[1:06:25] rapturing Faith because why it gave us
[1:06:29] back the faith that was once delivered
[1:06:31] to the Saints now let's go to the next
[1:06:34] one now and here'll set that one aside
[1:06:36] and as you know brother brandham spoke
[1:06:38] of statue of a perfect man and and he
[1:06:41] said he's building the Tabernacle of the
[1:06:43] living God's dwelling place and he says
[1:06:46] you know you start off with faith
[1:06:48] believe in God and and and and that that
[1:06:52] he referred to as a new birth now we
[1:06:55] know you know as brother brandom
[1:06:58] explained especially in later years he
[1:07:01] emphasized it and said now that's
[1:07:03] terminology and he says but that's just
[1:07:05] believing on the Lord right there a real
[1:07:07] New Birth is when you and God are united
[1:07:11] together in the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:13] Ghost but here in this teaching he said
[1:07:16] you know people are calling this or
[1:07:18] we're calling this Born Again by faith
[1:07:21] and we're going to add Faith virtue
[1:07:23] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[1:07:25] brother kindness and he said it is
[1:07:27] capped off with Charity which is God
[1:07:32] himself so the Capstone for the believer
[1:07:37] is when you receive the baptism of the
[1:07:40] Holy Ghost that puts you and God
[1:07:45] together amen so if you have the Holy
[1:07:48] Ghost in your life you have been capped
[1:07:50] off you're a finished product you are
[1:07:54] sealed to the day of redemption isn't
[1:07:57] that marvelous amen he makes you a son
[1:08:01] or daughter of God and you're capped off
[1:08:04] so that is The Headstone that every
[1:08:06] believer must have otherwise you're
[1:08:11] unfinished amen and it's only those
[1:08:13] finished that is going into Rapture so
[1:08:17] brother Brandon would draw it out like a
[1:08:18] pyramid you know starting down low and
[1:08:20] coming on and coming up and then he
[1:08:22] would compare it with the Seven Ages
[1:08:25] now we've been speaking on this for some
[1:08:27] time this uh in in in weeks going by I'm
[1:08:30] just
[1:08:31] recapping now and so in Seven Ages he
[1:08:34] said God would build a church and that
[1:08:36] was he would start out with Ephesus and
[1:08:39] and Smyrna and Sardis and on and on and
[1:08:41] on till you finally get to
[1:08:44] leoa and then of course he would cap off
[1:08:47] that finished church with Christ himself
[1:08:51] which is the physical return of Christ
[1:08:55] so you see again you have the headstone
[1:08:58] over here which is the seven Thunders
[1:09:00] the voices of God capping off the
[1:09:02] Mysteries You've Got The Headstone which
[1:09:04] is God himself capping off the
[1:09:06] individual and then the whole body of
[1:09:09] the Bride is capped off with the coming
[1:09:13] of Jesus Christ and let me tell you
[1:09:16] we're not complete until he comes now
[1:09:19] brother Brandon would tell you over and
[1:09:21] over again and this is what we're going
[1:09:23] to be looking at is that that last age
[1:09:27] he said now you know you start down wide
[1:09:29] at the bottom he said you couldn't put
[1:09:31] the Capstone on it you know it would it
[1:09:34] doesn't fit and so it keeps moving up up
[1:09:36] up up until finally the capston got to
[1:09:40] fit or should I say it this way the last
[1:09:44] age and the last people have to fit the
[1:09:50] Capstone and that Capstone is
[1:09:53] Christ so there's a people on earth that
[1:09:56] is going to match
[1:09:58] him is't that amazing isn't that
[1:10:00] wonderful what a promise leads out
[1:10:02] before us that no matter what you see
[1:10:06] all around you and the confusion the
[1:10:08] trouble and whatever around you know
[1:10:10] he's not through working he's not
[1:10:13] through honing he's not through fitting
[1:10:15] stones into into the into the church and
[1:10:19] the and the last stones are going to
[1:10:21] match him
[1:10:23] perfectly and the same Ministry the same
[1:10:26] works the same attitude that Jesus had
[1:10:30] will be in this last day bride now
[1:10:34] that's why we are speaking about her as
[1:10:37] a Capstone because she C the living
[1:10:39] bride caps off all the rest of them and
[1:10:42] matches the Capstone
[1:10:46] completely
[1:10:49] now as we look at
[1:10:51] this there is all kinds of prophecies in
[1:10:54] the tie
[1:10:56] you know God foreshadowed it and showed
[1:10:59] it over and over and over again about
[1:11:02] these people who would be the redeemed
[1:11:06] ones who would receive not a gift of the
[1:11:10] spirit not not an anointing of the
[1:11:13] spirit but the person himself would
[1:11:16] Unite with them they they would be the
[1:11:18] very embodiment of
[1:11:20] deity and and so he would show this in
[1:11:23] the types of what this bride would be
[1:11:27] and I don't have time to even go into
[1:11:29] allall but I want to just just stop just
[1:11:31] for a moment because there just a few
[1:11:34] just right off the top as I lay in the
[1:11:36] bed the other day in the morning and as
[1:11:39] I was reflecting and going over these
[1:11:42] were ones just come up to me and and I I
[1:11:45] just thought about
[1:11:46] Adam you see God had done this with Adam
[1:11:51] do you realize Adam was a Capstone he
[1:11:54] was the cap off of all of God's
[1:11:57] creation is that right he had started
[1:12:00] down you know of course he'd made an
[1:12:02] earth that was for his domain he had
[1:12:04] trees and and and started like an
[1:12:06] evolution and build it up from the small
[1:12:09] things up and then he comes and and the
[1:12:11] bird life and and reptiles and
[1:12:14] amphibians and reptiles and from there
[1:12:16] to mammals and and he's building and
[1:12:18] he's building he building and then his
[1:12:20] crowning his crowning of the whole thing
[1:12:24] was a man in which would be the which
[1:12:28] would be a Son of God are you with me
[1:12:32] amen one that would be in God's image so
[1:12:36] you see he's actually as he's doing he's
[1:12:40] prophesying of what he is going to have
[1:12:44] in the last day of people in his very
[1:12:49] image my now think about that they would
[1:12:53] be there as Adam lived in Eden even so
[1:13:00] this one would bring about a restored
[1:13:03] Eden even as Fellowship would be before
[1:13:08] again as it was before the fall between
[1:13:11] God and man I'm telling you friends I'm
[1:13:15] talking about the last people I'm
[1:13:18] talking about the last people I'm
[1:13:20] talking about the top and I'm talking
[1:13:23] about the top there being ones that
[1:13:25] would Fellowship again as it was before
[1:13:28] the
[1:13:29] fall amen you you say brother Tim I need
[1:13:32] some scripture for that he said well
[1:13:34] then we would come boldly before the
[1:13:36] throne of grace finding help in our time
[1:13:39] of need if that isn't restored
[1:13:41] Fellowship what is
[1:13:46] it and then I look at it again and I
[1:13:51] look at them as ones when even sin
[1:13:54] entered in and it was all
[1:13:57] hopeless and it looked like you might as
[1:14:01] well throw in the towel God your enemy
[1:14:05] come in and and ruins your Eden and
[1:14:08] contaminated man and now his own vile
[1:14:11] nature lives in them but as they go out
[1:14:15] of the garden condemned God says wait a
[1:14:18] minute wait a minute thy seed the
[1:14:22] woman's seed will bruise the head of
[1:14:25] this
[1:14:26] serpent amen there you see it was there
[1:14:29] in the Eden that a people entered into
[1:14:32] death and mortality but it is here at
[1:14:35] this last day that a people alive and
[1:14:38] remain at the coming of the Lord cheat
[1:14:42] death and it will bruise the head of the
[1:14:46] serpent and
[1:14:48] Triumph changed in a moment in a
[1:14:51] twinkling of an
[1:14:53] eye brother that's
[1:14:56] profound that's
[1:14:58] awesome and to realize you've been
[1:15:01] chosen you are the chosen generation for
[1:15:04] that
[1:15:06] amen now as we are seeing this you know
[1:15:11] again we see even another type of Enoch
[1:15:16] the seventh from Adam prophesying of us
[1:15:19] showing that the seventh Church age
[1:15:21] takes the Rapture and you know anoch
[1:15:24] walked with God and was not for God took
[1:15:27] him you see again you know it's
[1:15:31] prophesied in the life of Noah and which
[1:15:34] is also a type of the Bride go get Noah
[1:15:38] go get um some porous
[1:15:42] wood get some porous wood go for wood
[1:15:46] and it's full of pores and it's a sorant
[1:15:49] and build the boat with it God that
[1:15:51] won't
[1:15:53] float it's going to what what will
[1:15:56] happen this this is what will happen
[1:15:58] when you put that in water it'll absorb
[1:16:00] it all he said but you didn't let me
[1:16:02] finish Noah line it with
[1:16:05] pitch go cut down an evergreen tree and
[1:16:09] bring the life out of that and put it
[1:16:11] into this poorest material and it'll be
[1:16:14] an impregnable Fortress against the
[1:16:17] tribulation coming the judgments that
[1:16:21] are coming somebody help me preach amen
[1:16:23] I want you to understand that's exactly
[1:16:25] what God did with you he took poorest
[1:16:29] Humanity amen you know how poorest you
[1:16:32] was you absorbed the world you absorbed
[1:16:34] every Dirty song Every Lie every this
[1:16:37] every that you was attracted to it but
[1:16:39] God Eed you out and took down and cut
[1:16:42] down a tree which was Christ himself the
[1:16:45] Eternal one and took the life out of
[1:16:47] that and put it in the in
[1:16:50] you to make you a part of this Ark
[1:16:55] that's right so that we could escape the
[1:16:57] Judgment
[1:16:59] Waters and guess
[1:17:03] what when they all when the elect
[1:17:06] entered in God shut the door sealing out
[1:17:10] the
[1:17:13] Judgment I want you to know Church you
[1:17:15] have passed from Death un life I I know
[1:17:18] in the large type it know it will type
[1:17:21] the tribulation sints but that's not why
[1:17:23] we're using it and we we want you to
[1:17:26] understand you are escaping the Judgment
[1:17:29] the condemnation upon this world because
[1:17:32] why God has prepared you as a vessel to
[1:17:36] be able to go through the the the the
[1:17:39] world itself and never absorb
[1:17:42] it and pass right over it into the new
[1:17:46] land oh Hallelujah into the new
[1:17:50] Earth now
[1:17:55] what about Abraham and Sarah Abraham and
[1:17:58] Sarah was another prophecy and laying
[1:18:01] there in the
[1:18:02] scripture and they were a couple an old
[1:18:05] couple an old couple who were looking
[1:18:08] for a promised
[1:18:09] son and whose body got changed to
[1:18:13] receive
[1:18:15] it now sometimes we don't understand why
[1:18:19] things happen the way they do in the
[1:18:21] scripture but isn't it something that
[1:18:24] Abraham would actually would they would
[1:18:27] record a story of him lying and him
[1:18:30] staggering in his faith that God was
[1:18:32] able to keep them and all of this and
[1:18:35] and it would record of him you know
[1:18:37] telling the Philistines that oh this is
[1:18:40] woman is that's my
[1:18:42] sister but it it allowed us to get a
[1:18:45] Viewpoint that when ailec wanted her
[1:18:48] what in the world would this King want a
[1:18:50] 90y old
[1:18:52] woman amen he wouldn't want that for his
[1:18:55] harm come
[1:18:56] on Amen now no offense to anybody 90 but
[1:19:01] even in 70 I'm not ready to marry
[1:19:03] something like
[1:19:05] that
[1:19:07] amen yeah it's like brother Jeff told me
[1:19:10] about his father father-in-law somebody
[1:19:12] has said to him um one of his other
[1:19:16] siblings said or or je siblings said to
[1:19:19] um Jeff dad you know what uh you ought
[1:19:23] to look around and there ought to be
[1:19:25] some of these little Widow women around
[1:19:26] here in town that you could you could go
[1:19:28] out and you know you don't have to live
[1:19:30] alone you go out and marry he said no I
[1:19:34] don't believe I want to do that he said
[1:19:36] sides have you looked at women my
[1:19:43] age you know there's something about
[1:19:45] Youth and whatever that is that's
[1:19:48] appealing and this was what it was to
[1:19:51] aimc aimc looked out and he he sees this
[1:19:55] young woman and he wants to marry her
[1:19:58] and she's
[1:20:00] 90 amen what did that tell us that gave
[1:20:03] us a view that this woman was changed
[1:20:07] she would have to be changed to be able
[1:20:08] to carry a baby see our milk veins was
[1:20:11] dried up for years and years and my
[1:20:13] goodness but all of a sudden there's a
[1:20:15] spring in her step there's a change that
[1:20:18] has happening and I want you to know it
[1:20:20] probably didn't happen overnight it was
[1:20:22] like that Mountain Moving
[1:20:25] amen so you see again again you see
[1:20:29] their bodies was changed to receive it
[1:20:31] now what could we say of the many
[1:20:33] Patriarchs a Moses who led Israel out of
[1:20:37] Egypt under the token of the blood
[1:20:39] Fallen a pillar of fire his ministry
[1:20:42] types this Third Exodus what about a
[1:20:44] Joshua placing Israel in their
[1:20:47] inheritance and we we have received the
[1:20:51] inheritance we have received to go to
[1:20:54] and returned to the land of our fathers
[1:20:57] what about Samson a church raised up to
[1:21:00] destroy the kingdom of hell and you can
[1:21:03] look at him and see the defeated Church
[1:21:07] come on but lay laying his head on the
[1:21:11] lap of a prostitute and what has
[1:21:13] happened to the ages we have been the
[1:21:16] chrisom has been contaminated with the
[1:21:18] horror of Revelation The Book of
[1:21:21] Revelation and and so you know then was
[1:21:24] blinded by her and and by them and yet
[1:21:27] while in prison while in
[1:21:30] bonds amen his hair grew out his
[1:21:34] Covenant was restored and and and here
[1:21:37] he cried just once more Lord what was it
[1:21:40] showing that the church who had started
[1:21:43] out in power and would go down in defeat
[1:21:46] would come again in the last day
[1:21:48] restored to the same power and actually
[1:21:51] do more as Samson did than what they did
[1:21:54] the
[1:21:58] first look at Joel's prophecy
[1:22:02] prophesying of Israel returning to their
[1:22:04] land but in that prophecy laid a greater
[1:22:07] Pro Prophecy of the outpouring of the
[1:22:10] spirit and of restoration and so when
[1:22:12] God said I will restore this was the
[1:22:15] scripture that Peter grabbed a hold of
[1:22:17] and when the Holy Spirit came and he
[1:22:19] said you know th this is that which the
[1:22:22] prophet Joel spoke of and if here in the
[1:22:24] last day it's it's the same outpouring
[1:22:28] as God finishes the work then we can
[1:22:30] look back to Joel chapter 2 and see you
[1:22:33] know yeah the church got ate down
[1:22:35] through the years and went down in
[1:22:37] defeat in so many ways and was carried
[1:22:39] off to Babylon and and and here the the
[1:22:42] Army come in instead of instead of a
[1:22:45] locust and a caterpillar and a Palmer
[1:22:47] worm and so on it it would be a white
[1:22:50] horse a red horse a black horse a pale
[1:22:53] and would strip the church down and that
[1:22:56] would be the church coming down in
[1:22:59] complete defeat carried down into
[1:23:02] Babylon bound down with Traditions but
[1:23:06] amen that's not the end of it for he
[1:23:09] says I will restore sayth the
[1:23:14] Lord what all the years of the
[1:23:17] cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer
[1:23:20] worm the
[1:23:22] Locust yeah
[1:23:26] but it will not only
[1:23:28] be the
[1:23:29] word it will
[1:23:31] manifest its
[1:23:34] power for to be the true word it has to
[1:23:38] be in spirit and
[1:23:40] truth I know we put a lot of emphasis on
[1:23:43] the word and many times that emphasis is
[1:23:45] on the
[1:23:47] mechanics but I want you to know it is
[1:23:50] you know even Paul after doing all the
[1:23:52] Mysteries and revealing all these
[1:23:54] Mysteries truth he he reminded him and
[1:23:56] he said but this gospel did not begin in
[1:24:00] word only but in power this not how it
[1:24:03] came it didn't just come with word only
[1:24:06] but in power and much assurance and I'm
[1:24:08] just going to tell you it must not end
[1:24:11] just in word only that's right just us
[1:24:14] embracing a new
[1:24:16] theology that is different from all the
[1:24:20] denominations but also the power of God
[1:24:22] to go with it
[1:24:25] amen now brother brandom tells us uh
[1:24:29] clearly that the Dynamics and the
[1:24:30] mechanics will be
[1:24:34] together amen and he said that's where
[1:24:37] Satan got into it listen carefully
[1:24:39] that's where Satan got in it to make it
[1:24:41] all mechanics and no
[1:24:44] Dynamics or back all Dynamics and no
[1:24:49] mechanics because here you had you had
[1:24:52] the fundamentals and the Pentecostals he
[1:24:54] kept talking about one of them's all
[1:24:55] mechanics no Dynamics the other's got
[1:24:58] Dynamics no
[1:25:00] mechanics the word's
[1:25:03] missing so he says we got to put it
[1:25:08] together we've got the power of the Holy
[1:25:11] Spirit but we got to come back with the
[1:25:13] word to feed the machine now he's
[1:25:15] speaking here to the Pentecostal group
[1:25:17] he said we've got the power of the Holy
[1:25:19] Spirit but we've got to come back with
[1:25:22] the word to feed this machine and we
[1:25:24] can't feed it on Creeds it won't burn it
[1:25:27] chokes up the flu it will not burn it
[1:25:30] it's made for the word of God man shall
[1:25:32] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:25:34] word not just part of it every word that
[1:25:37] proceeds out of the mouth of God but yet
[1:25:41] at the same time I want you to
[1:25:43] understand this word in his power will
[1:25:46] be the stone the builders
[1:25:50] disallow but God will make it the head
[1:25:52] of the corner
[1:25:54] but you know you
[1:25:57] know I just want to say to you no matter
[1:26:00] what kind of confusion we see and
[1:26:03] trouble that we see in the world and
[1:26:05] trouble even that we see in message
[1:26:08] ranks I want to say it today clearly
[1:26:12] someone somebody will accept
[1:26:15] him and Revelation 10 shows this the
[1:26:19] mighty angel coming down with the open
[1:26:22] book restoring pen Pentecost again amen
[1:26:27] you say Pentecost yes that was exactly
[1:26:30] what the prophet of God was to do turn
[1:26:32] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:26:35] Pentecostal fathers not Aza Street they
[1:26:37] were Pentecost that's
[1:26:40] right
[1:26:43] now and there will be
[1:26:45] somebody somebody who will take that
[1:26:50] book and eat it and manifest deity and
[1:26:55] his power in their lives for they speak
[1:26:58] out I want you to notice they are the
[1:27:01] last
[1:27:03] prophecy because they're prophesying
[1:27:06] again bringing the same prophecy that
[1:27:10] Paul
[1:27:12] brought amen come on the bride will have
[1:27:16] the final prophecy Revelation
[1:27:19] 108 he said thou must prophesy again
[1:27:24] you see the same prophecy that Paul had
[1:27:27] the same prophecy that they prophesied
[1:27:30] and preached as the Spirit came down at
[1:27:32] Pentecost we'll prophesy again now
[1:27:37] prophesying is is a work of the
[1:27:41] supernatural through a man or woman who
[1:27:45] is speaking out the word of God now let
[1:27:47] me tell you the word the message came as
[1:27:50] a shout and that message has been
[1:27:53] consumed
[1:27:56] consumed these past 60 years but it must
[1:28:00] be
[1:28:01] prophesied and
[1:28:03] manifested amen I I don't mean just
[1:28:06] taught teaching is not
[1:28:09] preaching it is demonstrated the gospel
[1:28:13] it must be
[1:28:15] demonstrated now brother brandham told
[1:28:17] us it is in the in the sermon um what
[1:28:21] shall I do with Jesus it's uniting time
[1:28:23] of God God and his bride to and I say
[1:28:25] this with reverence and respect I
[1:28:28] believe the bride of Christ is called I
[1:28:30] believe she's sealed in the kingdom of
[1:28:33] God I believe the mechanics is there and
[1:28:36] they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll
[1:28:39] take her off the earth and the glory and
[1:28:40] the Rapture I believe it with all my
[1:28:42] heart yes sir we don't know how he's
[1:28:44] going to do it but he shall do it he is
[1:28:47] a Dynamics we just become members of the
[1:28:50] machine of his body forming oursel into
[1:28:53] his image and see uh him uniting himself
[1:28:57] with us in his work with his love
[1:29:00] gifts as he hands them to us just before
[1:29:03] the wedding supper oh my you mean he
[1:29:06] will hand out love
[1:29:08] gifts just before the wedding supper and
[1:29:12] he said we're waiting watching for that
[1:29:14] he and he said now they're big church
[1:29:16] out there they're all being united
[1:29:18] together but the Dynamics of this church
[1:29:21] is going to be different from that
[1:29:24] because the Dynamics of this church will
[1:29:26] be a refilling of the holy spirit that
[1:29:29] we have worked in a small measure while
[1:29:31] The Headstone is coming to unite with
[1:29:34] the body but when that head and body
[1:29:37] unites together the full power of the
[1:29:40] Holy Ghost will raise her up just
[1:29:42] exactly like that and even the dead
[1:29:45] that's dead in Christ for hundreds of
[1:29:47] years ago will rise in the beauty of his
[1:29:49] Holiness and take a flight to the sky
[1:29:52] the Dynamics is the Holy
[1:29:56] Spirit
[1:29:57] hallelujah amen so instead of less of
[1:30:00] the
[1:30:03] spirit amen there's a bride promis more
[1:30:06] of the spirit till it
[1:30:09] crescendos to the point the dead in
[1:30:12] Christ
[1:30:14] rise now in three kinds of Believers
[1:30:18] brother Brandon would talk about the
[1:30:19] three kinds you know the make believer
[1:30:21] the unbeliever the make believer and the
[1:30:23] True Believer
[1:30:25] talks about Abraham how that Abraham
[1:30:28] stagger not at the at the promise of God
[1:30:31] and the impossibilities he didn't
[1:30:33] consider even his body now dead you see
[1:30:36] that's what you do with Divine Healing
[1:30:38] or any prise you don't consider the
[1:30:41] negative you consider only the
[1:30:44] positive only what God said he said
[1:30:48] we're going to have a baby 25 years
[1:30:50] later he still said doc you still
[1:30:53] holding that hospital
[1:30:55] open you see it makes you act funny your
[1:30:59] decisions are odd to the world but it's
[1:31:02] a a Believer no matter how strange it
[1:31:05] seems you see the Bible said that he was
[1:31:08] fully persuaded God was able to perform
[1:31:11] what he said he would do the Bible said
[1:31:14] of Abraham that he was fully persuaded
[1:31:17] that God was able to perform what he
[1:31:18] said he would do that ought to be the
[1:31:20] achievement of every believer this
[1:31:22] afternoon God is able to keep every word
[1:31:26] that he said he'll do it I don't care
[1:31:28] what denominations say words um days of
[1:31:32] Miracles has passed all this is
[1:31:34] telepathy and and it's all fortune
[1:31:36] telling it doesn't matter to me what
[1:31:39] they say I still believe if that gun is
[1:31:44] zeroed to the Target it'll Hit the
[1:31:47] Target and I believe if a Believer is
[1:31:50] zeroed with the word of God it'll hit
[1:31:52] the same thing if the word of God ever
[1:31:55] promised it it'll do it again I'm fully
[1:31:58] persuaded of that then when we see we're
[1:32:01] in this age when it's supposed to be
[1:32:03] here it's supposed to be here these
[1:32:05] things are supposed to take place that's
[1:32:09] the reason that I believe that when the
[1:32:13] bride is called out and elected and said
[1:32:16] in the Book of Life there will come a
[1:32:19] sound from Heaven that'll take such a
[1:32:22] baptism of the Holy Spirit into that
[1:32:24] bride that it take her off of the Earth
[1:32:27] from the earth in a rapturing Grace God
[1:32:30] promises don't care how many science or
[1:32:32] how many astronauts they signed up and
[1:32:34] everything else and how many millions of
[1:32:36] miles they can say I don't care nothing
[1:32:38] about that there is a heaven and there
[1:32:41] is a literal Jesus Christ there that
[1:32:44] will come in a body form to receive his
[1:32:47] church to himself and no matter how old
[1:32:49] the story seems it's still the truth God
[1:32:52] said so that's what what Believers
[1:32:55] believe God said I am the Lord that
[1:32:57] heals all th diseases I'm God I change
[1:33:00] not amen and God is word and if God
[1:33:03] don't change how is his word going to
[1:33:05] change I am God and I change not you see
[1:33:09] he can't
[1:33:11] change so but I I just want to ask you
[1:33:17] again as we
[1:33:20] consider the words in Revelation 10
[1:33:24] eight that thou must prophesy
[1:33:29] again then how is this even going to
[1:33:33] happen without being
[1:33:38] prophesied
[1:33:41] amen you know that's why I say Minister
[1:33:43] Brothers everywhere
[1:33:47] prophesy amen you you you you get what
[1:33:50] you expect so preach it so the briide
[1:33:54] will expect
[1:33:56] it amen don't don't be don't be
[1:33:59] satisfied with whatever feeling you've
[1:34:02] got amen say God pour out into me your
[1:34:07] fullness until I'm
[1:34:09] changed are you with me amen so prophesy
[1:34:13] if you teach people you you if you teach
[1:34:16] people that they're just going to be
[1:34:17] denominational church members who just F
[1:34:20] A Pew and you know you got to struggle
[1:34:22] with all your problems s and know you
[1:34:24] can't overcome and you know we'll give
[1:34:26] you some lessons on you know that's all
[1:34:28] they'll be but if you teach them that
[1:34:31] now they are the sons of God you are
[1:34:34] filled with deity then and that they can
[1:34:36] expect more than just a knuckle down to
[1:34:39] the devil that they will become more
[1:34:42] than
[1:34:43] conquerors amen Seed of Abraham that are
[1:34:46] called to possess the gates of his
[1:34:49] enemies faith will rise if faith is
[1:34:53] preached
[1:34:58] I'm going to say it again don't be
[1:34:59] satisfied with what you
[1:35:02] have and and and and people are so
[1:35:05] lukewarm I mean even to the point of
[1:35:08] church has become so lukewarm they're
[1:35:10] just happy with where with the status
[1:35:13] quo you know we got a few answered
[1:35:16] prayers we got a healing now and then I
[1:35:20] say expect a
[1:35:22] miraculous amen expecting to pour out
[1:35:24] his Spirit till it
[1:35:27] overflows amen don't don't just expect
[1:35:30] just a little bit come on I mean it's
[1:35:33] it's like it's like people all of a
[1:35:35] sudden gets into fense mode well we got
[1:35:37] miracles we got signs that's okay I'm
[1:35:40] not denying that I'm saying even among
[1:35:43] us we want more we're not going to be
[1:35:46] satisfied with a just a handful now and
[1:35:49] then we want the full
[1:35:52] possession amen amen Ruth in the Bible
[1:35:56] she got measures she got measures of
[1:35:59] barley and that was given to her that
[1:36:01] was sustainer for a while but she wasn't
[1:36:03] satisfied with getting a lap full of of
[1:36:06] bar barley and put in her veil and say
[1:36:08] okay we got enough to to last for a week
[1:36:12] no sir she said I I want more than that
[1:36:15] barley I want
[1:36:17] Boaz because if I have boas I have the
[1:36:21] whole field I have every premise I have
[1:36:25] the seed amen I have the king line amen
[1:36:29] I Hallelujah this is what will place me
[1:36:33] as the bride I want to be the bride I'm
[1:36:35] not just satisfied with that little
[1:36:37] handful dropped on purpose once in a
[1:36:46] while see it's written in the
[1:36:48] types you're going to be that Ruth
[1:36:54] that's going to get
[1:36:57] Boaz other ages they got a measure to
[1:37:01] sustain
[1:37:02] them come on gave them seven measures I
[1:37:05] mean gave gave them enough to sustain
[1:37:07] them for the time but this last one
[1:37:10] doesn't get a little another dose of
[1:37:13] barley she gets she gets
[1:37:17] Boaz she gets the
[1:37:20] king she gets the prize
[1:37:34] brother Brandon
[1:37:36] prayed in 1965 Lord dear Jesus as we
[1:37:41] assemble together again in your name
[1:37:44] with a great
[1:37:46] expectation for the outpouring of the
[1:37:49] quickening power of God to bring us into
[1:37:52] recognition of our position in place our
[1:37:55] responsibilities as being a called
[1:37:58] people separated to the world dedicated
[1:38:01] to God lord tonight that the blessings
[1:38:03] of God will guide us and direct us in
[1:38:06] the things we do or say that it may be
[1:38:08] bring honor and glory to your name look
[1:38:10] look what he prayed great
[1:38:13] expectation that's how we should come
[1:38:15] together great expectation what for the
[1:38:18] outpouring of quicking power to bring us
[1:38:21] in recognition of our position
[1:38:24] our responsibilities and being a called
[1:38:28] people I know I know sometimes people
[1:38:31] sigh and say well brother Tim you you
[1:38:34] you're always just preaching the same
[1:38:35] old same old you know don't you realize
[1:38:38] Revival is over and every gifts on the
[1:38:40] shelf and you shouldn't even be
[1:38:42] preaching Divine
[1:38:44] Healing you know you shouldn't even
[1:38:46] preach those and we we got we we got so
[1:38:48] much greater to even
[1:38:52] preach well let me quote the
[1:38:55] prophet it's scripture and you can't
[1:38:58] preach the Full Gospel without preaching
[1:39:01] Divine
[1:39:05] Healing it's got to be
[1:39:09] preached to what to raise a level of
[1:39:13] expectation to create faith in
[1:39:16] people so if we do not preach Divine
[1:39:19] Healing we're not preaching the Full
[1:39:21] Gospel and the fullness of the word came
[1:39:24] by the opening of The Seven seal so
[1:39:26] that's what we are endeavoring to
[1:39:29] promote is the full word the open book
[1:39:32] and all of the word all of the word and
[1:39:36] Divine Healing is in the word come on if
[1:39:40] it's not in the word you can't have it
[1:39:42] but it's in the
[1:39:44] word now the third pull the opening of
[1:39:48] the word opens up and makes available
[1:39:50] more healing than ever not l as more in
[1:39:55] the fifth seal when the little Collins
[1:39:57] boy was brought into the room where the
[1:39:59] holy where the spirit of God day by day
[1:40:03] spoke out and and was a thunder of God
[1:40:06] that would re open a seal to the prophet
[1:40:09] you know the child had had rheumatic
[1:40:12] fever that was affecting his heart it
[1:40:15] was so bad the doctor said not even to
[1:40:18] move him and the parents brought him to
[1:40:20] that room and prayer was made and and
[1:40:23] not one trace of the disease could be
[1:40:28] found amen that's right in the midst of
[1:40:31] the opening of the word
[1:40:34] healing is coming out of the presence of
[1:40:37] the one who was given
[1:40:42] Revelation and then a NY year a little
[1:40:44] nine-year-old girl was brought with
[1:40:46] leukemia and the last stages had already
[1:40:49] turned yellow and was being tube fed and
[1:40:51] and just be before the child left after
[1:40:54] prayer it cried for a
[1:40:57] hamburger and a few days she's back in
[1:40:59] school was taken to the doctor she who
[1:41:01] said there's not even a trace of
[1:41:04] leukemia found in that child he said now
[1:41:08] that's instantaneously on the mark the
[1:41:10] power of God to take a bloodstream and
[1:41:12] cleanse it out like that and put the
[1:41:14] pulsation of New Life in there because
[1:41:16] your bloodstream is your life mortal and
[1:41:18] to create new sales and clean out the
[1:41:20] old and what did I'd say this it's the
[1:41:23] creative act of almighty
[1:41:27] God hallelujah creative act of almighty
[1:41:32] god listen the power of creation going
[1:41:35] forth as the third pole was being
[1:41:37] manifested in the opening of the seals
[1:41:40] and if we're recipients of that mystery
[1:41:43] then the creative power of God ought to
[1:41:45] be at work in the
[1:41:50] church he said bloodstream
[1:41:53] contaminated with cancer till the little
[1:41:57] fellow was yellow and puffed out in just
[1:41:59] a few minutes moment's time a brand new
[1:42:04] bloodstream then he continues he says I
[1:42:07] believe I'm not going to speak this in
[1:42:09] his name I'm going to speak it in the
[1:42:11] revelation of my faith but what happened
[1:42:13] in sabinaa Canyon the other day I
[1:42:16] believe the hour is approaching when
[1:42:18] missing limbs will be
[1:42:21] restored I don't know maybe you have
[1:42:23] different expectation from the prophet
[1:42:25] but this is what he
[1:42:26] expected out of the revealing of the
[1:42:30] word that it would manifest in his power
[1:42:33] he said where even the hour is
[1:42:35] approaching when missing limbs will be
[1:42:37] restored and the glorious power of the
[1:42:39] Creator I believe if he can make a
[1:42:41] squirrel that has no and here's a man or
[1:42:44] woman just just aart missing and that's
[1:42:46] a complete animal himself oh he's God
[1:42:53] yes
[1:42:55] sir so brother bradam in the revelation
[1:42:59] of his
[1:43:00] faith because of a king's sword come
[1:43:03] into his
[1:43:05] hand what he said what happened in
[1:43:08] sabinaa Canyon the other day what
[1:43:14] happened come on message Buffs you know
[1:43:18] a sword came in his
[1:43:20] hand I'm standing out here in this
[1:43:23] desert nobody with me in me with around
[1:43:27] me for miles and here I've got my hands
[1:43:30] raised up and a sword comes into my
[1:43:33] hand and I look at it and I say see it
[1:43:37] it's say a glistening sword and it just
[1:43:40] sprit my hand as I say it over and again
[1:43:43] th this was not this is not the prophet
[1:43:46] receiving it for this is you receiving
[1:43:49] it when Moses went up there and got the
[1:43:51] law it wasn't from Moses it was for
[1:43:55] Israel and when brother Bram received
[1:43:58] the king sword it wasn't for him alone
[1:44:01] it was for you God put a word in your
[1:44:05] hand and there somebody is going to fit
[1:44:12] them so you
[1:44:15] see where the king sword meaning to
[1:44:18] meant to him that the hour is coming
[1:44:21] that missing limbs will restored that's
[1:44:24] what it meant he said it means to me
[1:44:27] this this King sword what happened there
[1:44:30] means to me we're coming into a time
[1:44:33] where the word's going to be so pre
[1:44:36] prevalent in power that missing limbs
[1:44:40] will be
[1:44:43] restored well I'm reading that from
[1:44:45] first Thessalonians
[1:44:49] 4 come on we which are alive remain will
[1:44:54] be changed you think you're going in
[1:44:56] that Rapture with a missing arm
[1:45:01] leg missing teeth imperfections no
[1:45:05] you're going to be
[1:45:07] changed in a
[1:45:11] moment in the twinkling of an eye so
[1:45:14] brother brandham talks about this and he
[1:45:15] says you know Divine Healing is right
[1:45:18] the message is right the purpose is
[1:45:19] right it's scripture and you can't
[1:45:22] preach the Full Gospel
[1:45:23] without preaching Divine Healing now you
[1:45:26] know so many he said people think that
[1:45:29] Divine Healing is just a Hocus Pocus
[1:45:31] Affair it's plain simple and the Gospel
[1:45:35] of Jesus Christ So Divine Healing is the
[1:45:40] gospel down heal Divine Healing is the
[1:45:43] down payment or the earnest money on
[1:45:46] your mortal Immortal body it's the
[1:45:48] evidence you will have an immortal body
[1:45:54] and you want to do away with the
[1:45:55] evidence we're going to be
[1:45:59] changed come on brother bandam tells us
[1:46:02] in the in there he says you you'll see
[1:46:04] come to this platform little old
[1:46:06] crippled children Twisted children
[1:46:08] you'll see them stand here all misformed
[1:46:11] out of shape and you'll see it with your
[1:46:13] own eyes see their hands and arms come
[1:46:16] straight and walk off the platform
[1:46:18] normal children you'll see people come
[1:46:20] here that's got all kinds of condition
[1:46:23] and see them healed and leave the
[1:46:25] platform what is it that's the down
[1:46:27] pavement that's the earnest to know that
[1:46:30] that person someday if they stay under
[1:46:33] the blood will receive an immortal body
[1:46:37] am hallelujah amen so when we get healed
[1:46:43] it is the earnest the down payment of a
[1:46:46] new
[1:46:48] body and can you imagine that becoming
[1:46:51] less and less as we had toward the new
[1:46:55] body
[1:46:57] no it's going to materialize greater and
[1:47:03] greater so rather than there be less
[1:47:07] healing expect more
[1:47:10] healings amen expect God to reveal to
[1:47:13] you amen the down payment on your on
[1:47:17] your Immortal body your new body again
[1:47:21] he talks about this he said
[1:47:23] I have some man across everywhere across
[1:47:25] the country criticizing me about Divine
[1:47:28] Healing why my brother how could I keep
[1:47:31] from the believing in Divine Healing
[1:47:33] when it is the very nature of the Holy
[1:47:37] Spirit come on you know the the Divine
[1:47:40] Healing is not Hocus
[1:47:43] Pocus am man it's it's not listen it's
[1:47:47] not even just a fish attractant you know
[1:47:49] it is it is the very nature of the Holy
[1:47:52] Spirit
[1:47:56] every every man that's born in the
[1:47:58] spirit will have to believe in the in
[1:47:59] the Supernatural because he is a part of
[1:48:02] God he's an offspring of God he said you
[1:48:05] look like you're daddy you got a nose
[1:48:06] like you tell me I got a nose they tell
[1:48:08] me I got a nose like my dad I got a
[1:48:10] mouth like my dad he's my father I've
[1:48:12] got a right to look like him then if God
[1:48:15] is my father I have a right to believe
[1:48:18] in the Supernatural because I'm born of
[1:48:20] the supernatural spirit and that makes a
[1:48:23] supernatural being out of me
[1:48:26] inwardly now outwardly he said I'm a man
[1:48:28] of
[1:48:30] clay but inwardly when you're born in
[1:48:33] the spirit of God you become a
[1:48:34] supernatural being in there and that
[1:48:37] supernatural being hungers and thirst
[1:48:39] for his Heavenly
[1:48:43] home I got a new body waiting for me and
[1:48:46] I'm hungry and thirsty and I'm saying
[1:48:49] Lord show me you know give me a little
[1:48:51] more of that down pay
[1:48:55] amen come on give me a little more of
[1:48:57] the deposit let me enjoy what you did
[1:49:01] for me at Calvary let me take of that
[1:49:04] deposit and spend
[1:49:06] it Hallelujah I don't have to wait for
[1:49:09] the whole new body I can already amen
[1:49:13] because he made a deposit there at
[1:49:15] Calvary for me I can already begin to
[1:49:18] spend that
[1:49:21] deposit Hallelujah so if I need healing
[1:49:24] he paved it
[1:49:28] all now you think oh but old brother Tim
[1:49:31] the impersonators the impersonators
[1:49:34] Janice and jambre they just bragged
[1:49:36] about how great they were because of a
[1:49:39] miracle that that you know we should
[1:49:43] quit testifying on Miracles cuz you know
[1:49:47] but let me tell you they did it to make
[1:49:50] themselves big the bride does it to make
[1:49:54] God
[1:49:55] big to exalt the name of
[1:49:58] Jesus Take brother Brandon for example
[1:50:02] he told of his Supernatural experiences
[1:50:04] time after
[1:50:06] time I mean service after service he
[1:50:10] told it we and and you know and I one
[1:50:13] time it was in 65 after telling a
[1:50:16] supernatural experience he added he said
[1:50:19] that's not fiction that's the truth that
[1:50:21] wasn't back in Bible days that's now
[1:50:25] that's the same God that's always showed
[1:50:27] me these things and they come to pass
[1:50:29] exactly to the light letter never one
[1:50:32] time have they failed now I'm bragging
[1:50:35] on
[1:50:40] him this is what this is example of our
[1:50:43] Prophet I'm bragging on
[1:50:46] him how do you think it's in the Bible
[1:50:51] of the mighty America because it Jesus
[1:50:53] did why is it written there is because
[1:50:57] somebody
[1:50:59] bragged and
[1:51:01] testified and wrote it in the Bible I'm
[1:51:04] glad aren't you glad and that's what I'm
[1:51:08] going to do when Jesus comes and does
[1:51:10] something Among Us I'm going to brag on
[1:51:12] Jesus I'm going to tell of his mighty
[1:51:15] wonderwork Powers amen that this is not
[1:51:19] just back in the Bible days but it's
[1:51:21] right here right now it's for
[1:51:26] 2025 and it's not going to get
[1:51:29] less and I'm not going to keep silent
[1:51:31] about
[1:51:32] it now brother Brandon said now that's
[1:51:34] the reason I'm trying to say all that I
[1:51:37] can and you hear me bragging on Jesus
[1:51:40] always about Jesus Jesus always never
[1:51:43] myself it's Jesus you see it's him it's
[1:51:47] him it's him I have nothing to do with
[1:51:49] it I'm just his mouthpiece
[1:51:53] and that's us under our messenger we are
[1:51:56] the final voice to the final age amen
[1:51:59] and we are to be his mouthpiece because
[1:52:01] leod deia God sped it out of his mouth
[1:52:04] but he has now another mouthpiece in
[1:52:08] this day and if we brag on
[1:52:12] Jesus don't accuse us of being like
[1:52:15] impersonators who use their gifts to
[1:52:17] exalt themselves when we're exalting
[1:52:20] Jesus
[1:52:24] if brother brandom exalted Jesus by
[1:52:26] telling his wonders we're going to exalt
[1:52:29] Jesus at the book of Acts was written
[1:52:32] and told of the mighty works of the Holy
[1:52:34] Spirit then when the Holy Spirit does
[1:52:36] his Works among us we're going to
[1:52:39] publish it among his people for we are
[1:52:41] writing a book of Acts that's
[1:52:45] right how can it be written if it's not
[1:52:51] testified come on
[1:52:53] the devil wants you to hide your candle
[1:52:55] in a bush he wants you you know to to to
[1:52:58] be so afraid of oh I might I might be I
[1:53:02] I I might be trying to make myself
[1:53:04] something big listen it ain't about
[1:53:06] making you something big it's about
[1:53:08] making him
[1:53:10] big amen that you know he said oh my I
[1:53:14] love that I love to brag on him I love
[1:53:17] to make him big before the people I
[1:53:19] don't have to make him big he's already
[1:53:22] big he's so high you can't get over him
[1:53:24] so deep you can't get under him so wide
[1:53:26] you can't get around him and yet you got
[1:53:28] room in your heart for Him won't you
[1:53:30] receive him how wonderful our Lord
[1:53:32] is well brother you know all through the
[1:53:35] Bible they did this even in the Old
[1:53:37] Testament psalms 105 verse one put it up
[1:53:41] oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon
[1:53:43] his name make known his deeds among the
[1:53:47] people this is a commandment of God Amen
[1:53:51] sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk
[1:53:54] you of his wondrous work oh let's let's
[1:53:57] talk about his wondrous work let's tell
[1:54:00] people he's still a Healer he's still a
[1:54:03] deliverer that he sets captive
[1:54:08] free listen it'll happen and and not
[1:54:11] even a man lay his hand on you didn't
[1:54:13] you hear brother Tim a while ago when I
[1:54:15] I stood there and said you can receive
[1:54:17] it right now in your seat and things
[1:54:19] begin to happen things begin to move off
[1:54:21] his Mountain right
[1:54:25] then listen it don't even take an altar
[1:54:28] call some people need to come to altar
[1:54:31] spend a
[1:54:32] Time die
[1:54:35] out but you can you can make that
[1:54:38] decision right
[1:54:39] now
[1:54:41] immediately you can be as long you know
[1:54:43] long as you want it or short as you want
[1:54:49] it you know I spoke with brother Jason
[1:54:52] tag and I just told him I said you know
[1:54:54] I don't care what you've been through
[1:54:55] just go fall in love with Jesus forget
[1:54:58] about everything else and what this done
[1:55:00] and what this one said and how this one
[1:55:01] mistreated you and this and that forget
[1:55:03] all of that get one that thing on your
[1:55:06] mind go fall in love with
[1:55:08] Jesus here he comes to another service
[1:55:10] or two and sitting back there you know
[1:55:13] while the word is going forth while the
[1:55:16] preaching of the word is going forth you
[1:55:19] know he he walks out and he doesn't even
[1:55:21] realize
[1:55:23] there's a change that has happened in me
[1:55:25] he doesn't even recognize somebody that
[1:55:28] what's even been done yet and sitting at
[1:55:31] the table hours after the service his
[1:55:33] wife said to him have you noticed
[1:55:35] something Jason what what no what are
[1:55:38] you talking about you haven't
[1:55:40] smoked I couldn't go 20 minutes he said
[1:55:43] without banging my head up against the
[1:55:45] wall for a
[1:55:46] cigarette but he said it was gone Not
[1:55:50] only was that gone but my drinking habit
[1:55:52] was gone the drugs was gone my desires
[1:55:55] were
[1:55:56] changed that's all it takes One Moment
[1:55:59] In His presence brother Tim did you do
[1:56:02] that no man can't do that I would be
[1:56:05] stupid to think I could do that but God
[1:56:08] is in the midst of his people and we're
[1:56:10] going to declare his mighty
[1:56:13] [Applause]
[1:56:18] Works sing unto him sing Psalms unto him
[1:56:21] talk of his
[1:56:22] his wonders Works Glory ye in His holy
[1:56:26] name let the heart of them Rejoice that
[1:56:29] seek the Lord seek the Lord in his
[1:56:31] strength seek his face forever more
[1:56:33] remember His Marvelous works that he has
[1:56:35] done his wonders and the judgments of
[1:56:38] his
[1:56:39] mouth
[1:56:43] Hallelujah brother brandham tell us in
[1:56:45] the Hebrew he said how can we escape if
[1:56:48] we neglect such you neglect to eat
[1:56:51] you'll die die you neglect to turn a
[1:56:54] corner you'll wreck you neglect to Milk
[1:56:57] The Cow she'll go dry you neglect your
[1:56:59] teeth you'll have all them pulled out
[1:57:02] certainly you pay for your neglection oh
[1:57:04] brandom Tabernacle and you visitors let
[1:57:06] me tell you something now you neglect to
[1:57:09] testify the glory of God you neglect to
[1:57:12] give God the praise and the glory you'll
[1:57:14] find yourself cold and formal and
[1:57:16] backslid in one of these days you give
[1:57:19] God praise
[1:57:22] and that's what happens you know again
[1:57:24] if we don't tell his mighty works then
[1:57:27] people don't know to expect his mighty
[1:57:36] works now I focus on
[1:57:39] this because if
[1:57:42] Satan can with his Antichrist Spirit he
[1:57:47] will try to make this bride cold formal
[1:57:52] and
[1:57:53] Powerless and he will take the
[1:57:55] miraculous from our
[1:57:58] midst he will try to kill the faith we
[1:58:00] have he will try to stop the word of Our
[1:58:03] Testimony that we overcome by and but
[1:58:07] I'm going to tell you he won't be
[1:58:10] successful for the bride will be alive
[1:58:12] and remain to the coming of the Lord and
[1:58:15] when Jesus comes he will find Faith
[1:58:18] there will be somebody that will believe
[1:58:20] him in the hottest fire
[1:58:24] the worst
[1:58:28] trials
[1:58:30] trials oh we're not tell me brother Tim
[1:58:32] we're not going to have no trials in
[1:58:41] 2025 out of great Trials Come great
[1:58:43] victories that's
[1:58:46] right you can't have healings without
[1:58:48] sickness you can't see Miracles without
[1:58:51] situation
[1:58:57] if everything's going to be perfect in
[1:58:59] this life we wouldn't need
[1:59:02] God his great attributes of healer
[1:59:05] deliver whatever wouldn't be
[1:59:09] needed now he didn't make us fall so
[1:59:11] that we'd have to go through
[1:59:13] this but knowing we would fall he was
[1:59:15] already a
[1:59:17] provider and I know during times of hard
[1:59:20] trials that when the voice of the enemy
[1:59:23] becomes so loud it nearly drowns out the
[1:59:27] voice of
[1:59:29] God listen David's own Brothers was his
[1:59:34] worst critics and they discouraged him
[1:59:38] and in his boast in the Lord they they
[1:59:41] called him a naughty
[1:59:42] boy told him to get back to his sheep
[1:59:46] they were just a worthless Shepherd and
[1:59:49] and he was not to forget it
[2:00:00] oh yeah that was David's
[2:00:03] brothers and and I tell you what David's
[2:00:06] Brothers will try to do that to you come
[2:00:09] on Amen just say you're just a naughty
[2:00:12] boy you're just a
[2:00:15] boy you know get back to your sheep all
[2:00:19] you are is just a worthless nobody just
[2:00:21] a shepher that's
[2:00:23] all you ain't got no business out here
[2:00:25] in the
[2:00:26] Army you couldn't whip a
[2:00:30] flea he would say later he' said by my
[2:00:33] God I have run through a troop and I've
[2:00:36] leaped over a
[2:00:40] wall come on
[2:00:42] church amen and I tell you don't be
[2:00:45] surprised when men who are supposed to
[2:00:47] be brothers and on the same team will
[2:00:50] ridicule and F fely accuse you and so
[2:00:54] sometimes you'll have to face Giants
[2:00:56] alone because no one else will stand
[2:00:59] with
[2:01:00] you do you think about it Israel let
[2:01:04] David go out by
[2:01:09] himself Saul who towered above them
[2:01:13] all let David go out by
[2:01:17] himself he didn't say hey I'll be your
[2:01:20] armor boy bear boy you got the faith you
[2:01:22] get out there I'll come up with my armor
[2:01:24] I'll stand right here by you while you
[2:01:26] slay that giant no I don't have nothing
[2:01:28] to do with that you go out there
[2:01:31] baby you risk your life I ain't got I
[2:01:33] ain't
[2:01:34] got I ain't got a dog in this
[2:01:40] fight they let him go out oh if he wants
[2:01:44] to make a fool of himself go out and do
[2:01:48] it but the closer David got got to
[2:01:52] Goliath I want you to listen to this the
[2:01:55] closer David got to Goliath the Roar of
[2:02:00] the giant was even
[2:02:05] greater you know way back over here on
[2:02:08] the hill somewhere and him in the
[2:02:09] distance he can just hear him you know
[2:02:11] kind of yell out over there you know it
[2:02:14] must be loud cuz I can hear it here but
[2:02:16] it's not really loud it's you know he's
[2:02:18] so far away but when he gets up close
[2:02:23] the Roar of the giant is even
[2:02:27] worse it's
[2:02:30] loud and when you get close to your
[2:02:33] deliverance the Roar of your giant is
[2:02:36] going to be louder than
[2:02:39] ever he's going to scream
[2:02:42] worse amen and as he approached
[2:02:45] Goliath Goliath didn't get smaller
[2:02:49] Goliath got bigger that's right when
[2:02:52] you're out here and you're you're 200
[2:02:54] yards away from somebody they look
[2:02:57] little but when you get up close you see
[2:03:00] how big they really are and so you see
[2:03:03] as he approached Goliath he the bigger
[2:03:05] he became that's the way it's going to
[2:03:08] be in your
[2:03:10] trials you'll come up and you'll face
[2:03:12] your enemy and Goliath his Roar will be
[2:03:15] louder and he'll look bigger than ever
[2:03:23] but to David that didn't
[2:03:25] matter he thought my goodness the be of
[2:03:29] the
[2:03:29] giant the greater the
[2:03:33] target amen I got more to
[2:03:37] hit amen and you know when he got up
[2:03:40] close the giant did exactly what David's
[2:03:43] brothers did you can show it was Satan
[2:03:46] and they called him he called him just a
[2:03:49] boy you're just an old nothing you know
[2:03:52] am I a dog did You' come out and try to
[2:03:55] whip me with a flea you know he pointed
[2:03:57] out David's youth called him just a boy
[2:04:00] pointed out his weakness pointed out his
[2:04:02] his lack of
[2:04:04] training and that's what the devil will
[2:04:06] do he's a bluff he'll come right out and
[2:04:10] he'll scream at you and he'll tell you
[2:04:14] how worthless how no good how faithless
[2:04:17] and he'll remind you of every every
[2:04:20] situation in your life that you didn't
[2:04:23] overcome that's amen and and he pointed
[2:04:27] out his youth he called him just a boy
[2:04:29] he pointed to his weaknesses like a
[2:04:31] trainer he pointed out to his small
[2:04:37] frame and the Giant's voice was
[2:04:41] loud it was Satan's attempt listen to me
[2:04:45] now Satan's attempt to drown out the
[2:04:49] voice of God yeah
[2:04:55] brother Tim when you when you you when
[2:04:59] you the pain increased it was Satan's
[2:05:03] attempt to drown out the voice of God
[2:05:07] who said you can be
[2:05:09] healed you see if Satan attempt to drown
[2:05:12] out the voice of God but you know you've
[2:05:16] already I'm talking to you now you've
[2:05:18] already defeated M Giants many times
[2:05:20] already your faith in the
[2:05:23] word and I'll tell
[2:05:25] you it's like with me I've met with
[2:05:30] Devils I'm not talking about
[2:05:32] people I'm talking about de demonic
[2:05:36] manifestations and they're ugly they're
[2:05:39] grotesque they're they're filthy they're
[2:05:43] nasty they have a it's
[2:05:47] unpleasant oh yeah I've seen them get a
[2:05:49] hold of
[2:05:50] people do all kinds of
[2:05:53] things and it's never
[2:05:55] Pleasant and I would rather never face
[2:06:01] another
[2:06:04] one I would rather never see
[2:06:07] that
[2:06:09] again but I'm going to tell you you know
[2:06:12] even with you and your situations even
[2:06:14] some of you in your health you know you
[2:06:16] would rather never be sick
[2:06:20] again but even
[2:06:22] but you see Philistines are
[2:06:25] persistent and even after Goliath's
[2:06:28] death they came again and again and
[2:06:30] again read the book The the book of the
[2:06:33] Kings he defeated Goliath they chased
[2:06:36] them out of the land and they come
[2:06:39] again and you think God when will this
[2:06:42] ever happen when your body's changed
[2:06:44] that's when you'll cease being
[2:06:47] invaded that's When Trials will be over
[2:06:50] that's when prophet IES will no longer
[2:06:52] be needed that's when Divine Healing
[2:06:55] will not ever be used again you can hang
[2:06:57] it up when our bodies are changed until
[2:07:01] then we need
[2:07:05] it so it seemed like the battles will
[2:07:07] never end and it's
[2:07:10] discouraging God I just got over
[2:07:14] this and here it comes
[2:07:17] again I Just Whipped this thing and
[2:07:21] here's is troubling me again knocking on
[2:07:23] my door screaming at me
[2:07:26] again and it's true and I'm going to
[2:07:29] just tell you you will never listen to
[2:07:33] me now you will never ever be able to
[2:07:36] make peace with your
[2:07:40] enemy I mean Israel's over there and
[2:07:43] they're over there
[2:07:45] wishing that they would never get
[2:07:47] another missile
[2:07:49] strike can we just go to our homes and
[2:07:53] sleep in the bed without being woke up 2
[2:07:56] 3 4:00 two or three times a night and
[2:07:59] run into our safe
[2:08:03] rooms but if they're going to possess
[2:08:05] that land they have to realize the enemy
[2:08:08] is persistent and they're not going to
[2:08:11] be happy until every Jew is dead but
[2:08:14] prophecy is against them come on church
[2:08:18] God will have a Jewish people of RI that
[2:08:21] in this last day 144,000 and they can't
[2:08:25] wipe them
[2:08:28] out not until God said okay it's time
[2:08:32] for them to change
[2:08:35] Dimensions now let me just
[2:08:38] say he's going to invade your Promised
[2:08:41] Land again and
[2:08:46] again and we don't ask for these battles

[2:14:34] up look back into the
[2:14:37] word go back in your
[2:14:40] mind where you killed the bear where you
[2:14:43] killed the
[2:14:44] lion and don't be afraid to testify
[2:14:47] before
[2:14:48] David David before your brothers before
[2:14:51] King Saul let the world know this God I
[2:14:55] serve amen he was with me when I killed
[2:14:58] a bear he was with me when I killed the
[2:15:01] lion and I'm drawing from these
[2:15:03] testimonies to declare that my God is
[2:15:07] able to bring down this Goliath I don't
[2:15:10] need your Shield I don't need your sword
[2:15:13] I just need my God
[2:15:23] we shall
[2:15:24] overcome we shall overcome for the Gates
[2:15:27] of Hell will not Prevail because we are
[2:15:30] the living bride and he's coming looking
[2:15:34] for Faith that's and somebody's going to
[2:15:37] have
[2:15:40] it
[2:15:42] oh listen brother brandom says an
[2:15:46] influence oh I ain't gotten near as far
[2:15:48] as I wanted to go
[2:15:49] today but he says an influence he he
[2:15:52] quotes the scripture he could not do
[2:15:54] many mighty works because of their
[2:15:59] unbelief so we must keep
[2:16:03] focused upon God's Eternal plan and what
[2:16:07] he wants us to accomplish you see the
[2:16:09] enemy throws up his fronts to distract
[2:16:11] us from what God wants
[2:16:13] done and so God help us God help us not
[2:16:17] to get sidelined by the trials of life
[2:16:21] for where we are overwhelmed and we
[2:16:22] don't see what God is doing I going tell
[2:16:25] you you
[2:16:27] know we're
[2:16:32] targets could I tell you this morning
[2:16:34] little bride you're an endangered
[2:16:41] species and there's a Target on your
[2:16:44] back every godly woman every godly man
[2:16:47] there's a Target on your back and
[2:16:49] Satan's got all the guns of Hell trained
[2:16:52] on you every minister of the Gospel
[2:16:54] Satan's got a Target on your
[2:17:01] back and we're shot at and sometimes
[2:17:05] we're shot at at Point
[2:17:10] Blank when you don't see how did that
[2:17:13] not take me down
[2:17:23] sometime ago you
[2:17:25] remember I had a
[2:17:27] dream I had a dream that I
[2:17:30] was I was taking a road I was you had
[2:17:34] some equipment some heavy equipment and
[2:17:37] I was using it to straighten out
[2:17:42] roads taking making heels
[2:17:46] level and
[2:17:48] there there is I was doing that that
[2:17:52] work which is what we're doing every
[2:17:54] minister of the Gospel is working with
[2:17:58] the
[2:17:59] Forerunner we listen listen let me let
[2:18:02] stop stop for a
[2:18:04] minute you know it wasn't just all
[2:18:07] Roberts and Billy Graham who were angels
[2:18:10] to
[2:18:11] Sodom they were just
[2:18:14] representatives of a spirit that was
[2:18:17] working of God to call the people out of
[2:18:22] Sodom come on but there was a many
[2:18:26] little Baptist preacher that got
[2:18:27] inspired by that same angel of God that
[2:18:31] anointed Billy
[2:18:33] Graham and or Roberts and they would and
[2:18:36] and they would go with their Bible under
[2:18:38] their arms and they would start little
[2:18:39] Baptist churches and they would preach
[2:18:42] and it's the same
[2:18:44] message come on it wasn't just
[2:18:48] them somebody help me realize something
[2:18:52] I mean it was it was it was an anointing
[2:18:56] and here we had figureheads men who
[2:18:59] represented that anointing and it would
[2:19:02] be men like Billy Graham or Roberts or
[2:19:04] Roberts that was representing the the
[2:19:06] faith movement and and they took it and
[2:19:08] with they blinding they had Miracles and
[2:19:11] signs and whatever so they couldn't see
[2:19:13] the door the other had easy believism so
[2:19:16] they couldn't see the
[2:19:18] door and many of them jumped on the
[2:19:21] bandwagon and preach the Prosperity
[2:19:23] Gospel and whatever and they did it to
[2:19:27] Blind fulfilling the type
[2:19:31] somebody sign on just a moment I want
[2:19:34] you to get what I'm saying amen there
[2:19:37] were many underneath them that were
[2:19:39] doing the work of those angels of that
[2:19:44] anointing that's right preaching the
[2:19:46] same thing blinding the eyes of some and
[2:19:50] and calling a a lot out that's
[2:19:54] right well if that's true with them what
[2:19:57] about the angel that stayed with
[2:20:00] Abraham Amen brother Brandon was the he
[2:20:03] was the the figurehead he was he was
[2:20:06] like or Roberts and Billy Graham were
[2:20:07] the Sodom he he was the one we can look
[2:20:09] at and said there it is that's the son
[2:20:13] of man revealing himself through human
[2:20:16] flesh but brother Brandon said that was
[2:20:18] to be done in the bride body
[2:20:21] so I want to tell you under that
[2:20:22] Forerunner there is Ministry that is now
[2:20:26] here preparing the way for his coming
[2:20:30] making the path smooth pulling down the
[2:20:33] heels straightening out the
[2:20:36] curves I know sometimes you don't like
[2:20:38] me doing it but that's a part of my job
[2:20:41] to pull down that Hill pull down lift up
[2:20:45] those neglected
[2:20:46] truths amen if we have not been putting
[2:20:49] enough emphasis on the D Dynamics lift
[2:20:51] up that neglected
[2:20:54] truth make the path clear get ready for
[2:20:59] the coming of the
[2:21:05] Lord oh
[2:21:07] yeah we're still doing the work of the
[2:21:10] Forerunner making the path straight
[2:21:13] smoothing out the rough places preparing
[2:21:15] a highway for a God so that his coming
[2:21:19] will be unh
[2:21:22] hindered preaching these kind of things
[2:21:25] a bride will
[2:21:27] know what you know what she will know
[2:21:31] their God say what she will know their
[2:21:34] God and will do
[2:21:36] exploits so you see we're making a
[2:21:39] highway for our God and there must be a
[2:21:41] living bride that stays stead fast upon
[2:21:45] the word but in this dream as as I was
[2:21:51] straighten it out it made a group angry
[2:21:54] and they swarmed around me with angry
[2:21:56] faces I didn't recognize them I didn't
[2:21:59] see who they were I don't know they were
[2:22:01] just people and one walked right up to
[2:22:04] me in point blank shut
[2:22:08] me Point
[2:22:11] Blank and I woke up because it was so
[2:22:15] loud in my ears and I could hear it
[2:22:18] resounding
[2:22:21] an echoing as I woke
[2:22:24] up and I said God I don't know how they
[2:22:27] didn't kill
[2:22:31] me I don't know
[2:22:33] how sometimes you go through
[2:22:36] things you get shot
[2:22:40] at you get shot at you get ridiculed you
[2:22:44] make made fun of you get you get every
[2:22:47] kind of things you have a meeting and
[2:22:49] the young people are people I don't care
[2:22:51] who they are old they jump and they
[2:22:53] shout and oh it ain't it ain't a jumping
[2:22:56] and shouting we love
[2:22:59] that don't tell us what we already know
[2:23:02] we know
[2:23:05] that we wern't born
[2:23:08] yesterday it was it ain't all in jump
[2:23:10] and Shout you don't shout to get it you
[2:23:13] shout cuz you got
[2:23:16] it amen oh it ain't all in Emotion we
[2:23:20] know that
[2:23:22] brother Brandon was you speaking of
[2:23:24] those things to correct
[2:23:26] people an age of of people who are in a
[2:23:30] cycle of elevating emotion over the word
[2:23:34] of God we are a people with the word you
[2:23:37] tell me what We Don't
[2:23:40] Preach amen we preach the seven Thunders
[2:23:42] are revealed we preach the Seven Seals
[2:23:45] are open we preach that the book is open
[2:23:48] and every Divine promise we know
[2:23:51] predestination eternal security serpy
[2:23:53] there's none of that we don't preach we
[2:23:55] preach what the prophet preached so he
[2:23:58] ain't talking about
[2:24:00] [Applause]
[2:24:02] us so therefore we can Rejoice over the
[2:24:05] word because when we eat it come on
[2:24:08] somebody it's the wine of Revelation and
[2:24:11] it causes stimulation on the inside of
[2:24:14] us the difference between us and that is
[2:24:17] because ours is not with you know it's
[2:24:20] kind of like opening a bot a bottle of
[2:24:22] pop and you find it and you're
[2:24:23] disappointed has no
[2:24:26] Fizz and a lot of what being served out
[2:24:29] there has no
[2:24:33] Fizz I like mine with fizz in it well
[2:24:37] okay you want to shake it all out and
[2:24:39] say all that's past but I don't want I
[2:24:42] don't want flat
[2:24:45] Coke and I don't want
[2:24:48] wine that doesn't have power in it
[2:24:51] stimulating power I don't want a just a
[2:24:55] drrive word that doesn't act and doesn't
[2:24:58] work I want to see it with power in it I
[2:25:01] want to see it come into new skins and
[2:25:04] bubble over Hallelujah until they're
[2:25:07] lack in the upper room where they just
[2:25:10] say Lord I'm just a big funnel fill me
[2:25:12] up and they get full and those new skins
[2:25:15] begin to expand and that begins to
[2:25:18] bubble out and here they come up
[2:25:21] bubbling out down out of the upper room
[2:25:23] speaking in Heavenly languages or in
[2:25:26] languages that only Heaven could
[2:25:30] give cuz it didn't come from
[2:25:34] man dancing shouting spilling
[2:25:41] over the power of God is limited to your
[2:25:45] faith that's the only limit it
[2:25:49] has is your
[2:25:51] faith so Faith must be
[2:25:55] preached oh can I finish this up just a
[2:25:59] little
[2:26:00] more like David's
[2:26:03] Brothers they scream
[2:26:06] out let's scream out we you see brother
[2:26:09] Tim we we're not to expect what the Zeus
[2:26:11] of Pentecostals are looking
[2:26:15] for
[2:26:17] yeah that's right
[2:26:20] I don't even say that begrudgingly I say
[2:26:22] yeah I know that they're looking for a
[2:26:25] time where there' be a great outpouring
[2:26:28] they'll empty the hospitals we're
[2:26:30] already told that's a lie it's not going
[2:26:33] to be
[2:26:34] that oh that's a false expectation and
[2:26:38] of course we don't want what Moses and
[2:26:41] Elijah's Ministry to the Jews we wants
[2:26:43] what's promised to the
[2:26:45] bride amen and I'm not even able to get
[2:26:48] to these bride promises this morning

[2:27:05] son and
[2:27:09] rottening yeah you brought it all
[2:27:14] right if you
[2:27:16] ripen you would mature and be exactly
[2:27:20] like the first grain that was on the day
[2:27:23] of
[2:27:29] Pentecost so if you lay in the presence
[2:27:31] of the word you're not supposed to go
[2:27:35] bad and WTH you're supposed to change
[2:27:39] from Glory unto Glory all the greenness
[2:27:43] of the past ages out and the fullness of
[2:27:46] the Holy Spirit sealed in
[2:27:51] yes
[2:27:54] now
[2:27:57] so someone
[2:27:59] shout they shout at us you can't have
[2:28:03] Revival because Nationwide and worldwide

[2:28:27] Healing campaigns and and and big tents
[2:28:29] and you know heral and man of the hour
[2:28:32] this and that we're not expecting
[2:28:34] that it won't be another repeat of that
[2:28:37] come on somebody amen but but the
[2:28:40] bride's Revival is not over and we're
[2:28:43] not dying we're gaining
[2:28:45] momentum I want to tell you we are not
[2:28:48] falling with the voice Fallen World we
[2:28:51] are rising with Christ we are part of
[2:28:54] the Ascension not a part of the
[2:28:59] Fall brother Brandon and how can I
[2:29:01] overcome he says now I chose this that I
[2:29:05] that I think that it's a time that we
[2:29:08] should never let the spirit of Revival
[2:29:13] die hello we've got to keep in Revival
[2:29:17] constant Revival every day Paul said
[2:29:20] daily that Christ should live we should
[2:29:22] never let that Revival die within
[2:29:25] us he says I think it's birth pain he
[2:29:28] said oh they say today you can't have an
[2:29:30] oldfashioned Revival he said oh yes you
[2:29:33] can you can have one in
[2:29:39] yourself how can it
[2:29:42] die she's described as alive and
[2:29:48] remain Not Dead
[2:29:55] brother brandham himself
[2:29:58] preached so that Apostolic times would
[2:30:04] come he said in perfect
[2:30:07] Faith he says we're trying to get the
[2:30:11] church into the place I wonder ministers
[2:30:14] are you on the same page as the
[2:30:16] prophet trying to get the church into
[2:30:19] the place where we could really see
[2:30:22] Apostolic times moving Among Us oh
[2:30:26] that's just baby stuff brother Tim we're
[2:30:27] Way Beyond that that's what we all
[2:30:31] hunger and it's just laying right at the
[2:30:36] door we see
[2:30:38] it and I'm not denying that we can go
[2:30:41] through this building this morning and
[2:30:43] we can say I've seen this and I've seen
[2:30:45] that and i' here's this and healed this
[2:30:47] and delivered this this and set free oh
[2:30:50] wondrous works that God has done he said
[2:30:53] we see it have we seen it sir but we
[2:30:57] want to see more of
[2:30:59] it how many is with the prophet on that
[2:31:02] we want to see more of it he said we
[2:31:04] want it to be such a flow that it'll be
[2:31:07] a help to us and US flow out to
[2:31:12] others if you're not hunger to see
[2:31:14] Apostolic time then you got a different
[2:31:16] appetite than the prophet of God
[2:31:20] that's all I can
[2:31:21] say because I tell you what I believe
