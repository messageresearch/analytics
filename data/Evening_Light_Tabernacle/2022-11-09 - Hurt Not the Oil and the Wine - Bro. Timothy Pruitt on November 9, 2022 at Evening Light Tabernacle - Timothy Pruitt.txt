there be anything that we've done that would hurt you in any way we ask the Lord that your forgiveness will come upon Our Lives we ask it in Jesus name For Your Glory amen amen let's turn to Revelations chapter 6. hey man it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen still kind of getting over some jet lag this uh this week and your mind's a little bit scrambled and hard to focus but we're glad to be here tonight amen it's always good to be home amen we will be again gone this weekend for that wedding for brother Joshua Pruitt and his wife to be and and for the Pruitt family so be there in Oklahoma with them this weekend so amen looking forward to what the Lord has in store for them amen Revelations chapter 6 and verse 5 and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I'll be held in low a black horse and he that sat on him had to pair had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine amen we let you be seated this evening I like to speak to you on hurt not the oil and the wine just looking as we I've personally been going through the Seven Seals and listening to them and uh just seeing what God has revealed in our age amen as we we're all living all know some of these things but just to go over them rehearse them in our minds as we know that the ages have been Satan has tried to destroy the light in every age he's tried to put it out in every Age and and we know that the the four horses symbolize in him as he rides and the White Horse is the Antichrist Spirit and the red horse and the Black Horse and and into the Pale Horse but also that it's very comforting to know that is not just him there but there's also for anointings that are there to combat him as he would take his ride and we know that those anointings be the lion and the ox and the man and the ego and and I'm thankful to know that today that we're not fighting him alone but and we're not fighting the darkness alone but there's a light that is with us and is combating the darkness that is around us as we know that it's the same demon that same devil same Satan that would ride all the way down through every age it's also the same God watching over his people in every age because he's determined to have a life in every age he's determined to have a people in every age he's determined hey I'm thankful for that because I'm I'm thankful to know that he's determined to have as he was in the first second third fourth all the way down he's just as determined tonight to have a people in this age and overcome her and so to have that he would have to give a strength or the ability or an anointing to make sure his word would come to pass now we know that this black horse is representing the Dark Ages and we know in that time it was a very dark time as as Darkness would try to put out the last bit of light it would try to put out that last bit of life that is coming through the seed or through the plant it was trying to kill that life and it was trying to stop that life from going through but we also see here that he spoke up and he said don't touch so don't hurt the oil and the wine or the life that is going through the body there must be a life to continue because of that life was stopped in in that age and us in our time we would not have no hope amen we would be it'd be nothing but a dead plant but God was determined that this life was going to continue in every age and it didn't matter what little bit it got down to how many what little group it got through it was going to go through every every spot now we see as this oil and wine amen it symbolizes something the oil symbolizes the spirit of God or the Holy Spirit and you can see all all through the Bible you can see it in Leviticus 8 and verse 12 where Aaron was anointed with oil you can see it in Zechariah 4 and 12 the oil that came down through the pipes and so forth you can see and he said this is my spirit you can see it in Matthew 14 and verse 25 have in the foolish virgins that had no oil no Spirit and the wise versions that had oil and had spirit and you can see it all through the Bible now also many times through the Bible oil and wine is together you can see it I I was just looking at it in the in the in the man who came to the uh the great the Good Samaritan as he would find that man that was wounded on the road he would he would address him with oil and with wine amen so it also it comes together you cannot you cannot divide it all simply simplifies the spirit it symbolizes Spirit but wine symbolizes the stimulation of Revelation amen so where their spirit is there's also the stimulation of Revelation amen he said Hey brother Brian will say when I realize what that stood for he said I like to run all over the place he said it's a wonder I didn't wake up the neighborhood when God showed me that the stimulation of Revelation all and wine in the Bible is always Associated together he said I've seen it all the way down to the concordances down to the scriptures he said when the truth or the promised word of God has been truly revealed his Saints that's filled with all they will all get stimulated amen if they're filled with all they will all get stimulated so if you see someone that's not stimulated you find maybe there's a problem they don't have the oil amen because it's always running he said it hears from the seals wine is a stimulation he said Glory I feel it right now stimulate it with joy shouts and when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine that that wine has upon the natural man amen has the same effect as wine has upon the natural man because when Revelation has been given of the truth of God the True Believer that's filled with all the Revelation is revealed and the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behave himself unnormally Hallelujah that means you cannot have the oil and be a normal person you're not going to be normal when it comes to being compared to this world thank God I'm thankful that when it comes becomes comes to being compared to this world I'm not thought of being a normal person amen because what's thought of being normal is not who I am or who I want to be but what I am is a child of God a Son of God and therefore as a Son of God filled with the oil of God and stimulated by the revelation of who he is and who I am it makes me act unnormally it makes something happen on the inside amen it makes them behave themselves un seemingly well I believe in church order well you ought to go listen to the seals again Amen brother random talks about it very clearly he says when someone has the all of God in them and the Revelation falls upon their heart they can't help but be stimulated it's something that reacts or something that moves as this unseen Force he would call it in places you know it's a man one time that would talk about a doctor actually that says what talks about somebody uh you know just reacting he said he said you can't react unless there's something Amen to cause a reaction and he said what is happening to people when they begin to scream amen and they begin to shout he said it's the Unseen force of the angels of God that are moving upon them that's causing them to act that way amen therefore it causes us to act unnormally or to be classified as Holy Rollers I'd rather be a Holy Roller than an Unholy roller amen because I see them all over the world that ain't you say well there's something about these you know a Holy Roller that's a bad name no what's a bad name is an Unholy ruler because you see them at different places when they get stimulated by what stimulates them and the world and their and the things that they bring enjoyment and what brings enjoyment to them and they get all tore up about it and they roll around about it and they shout about it well if they can shout about those kind of things in the world how why can't we shout about the goodness of God and the and the Miracles of God and the healings of God and the Deliverance of God and the word of God and it shows me who I am and I'm not lost I'm saved amen I'm not bound I'm free amen it shows me who I am it causes a stimulation on the inside it causes something to happen amen when that when that begins to take place and he said you can turn right over to Acts 2 and he goes right there and he said they had the promise that had been given them with all the promise of the Holy Spirit was to be poured out scripturally Vindicated he said what did they say now wait he told us to wait here for our ministry he said maybe after a few days a few of them got a little sideways and decided you know why I think we already got it we already got it he said why are we waiting for we've already got it and others said well let's just wait another day nine days come well I think we already got it he said but Simon stood up who had the keys and he said now wait a minute the scriptures got something to say with this he never told us just how many days away he said you stayed there until until what Joel's prophecy comes to pass until Isaiah's prophecy is Vindicated for with stammering lips and with other tongues when I speak to this people and this is the refreshment this is the wine that's poured out hallelujah what is wine in the Bible it's a refreshment it's the refreshment that comes from the presence of the Lord it's got to be scriptural now you see wine represents stimulation of Revelation and when the Holy Ghost fell they seen fire of God fall upon them by that began to stimulate them and the first thing you know they got so stimulated to people actually thought they were drunk but they weren't drunk with no some wine of the world they were drunk by the being stimulated by the Revelation that the Holy Ghost is not just there anymore or in a body called Jesus it's now in human flesh in 120 in the upper room and they realized then that the same life that was in Jesus is now living on the inside of them that if he overcame they can overcome Hallelujah amen and this is what's began to cause a stimulation on the inside of them that caused an excitement well I don't know about that excitement what it causes that it might cause it in different ways and other people and you know and and just as natural wine has different effects amen so does this it has different effects amen but the main thing is to realize I need to be filled with the oil of God amen so when the Revelation comes the stimulation is there with it amen God Vindicated Revelation made plain to them and they was happy about it well then what's wrong with us being happy about it God's revelated plan for this day has been made plain to us how come we can't be happy about it well we realize amen we're not just continuing on and to perpetuate another generation or another church age but this is the last stage this is the rapture age this is the bride age this is the coming of the Lord how come we can't be happy about it it causes stimulation it causes something to happen on the inside he said that's the reason Peter can get out there and say why you men of Judea you dwell in Jerusalem listen to me are you not doctors of divinity listen to what I'm going to tell you how wonderful revealed revealed they become so stimulated when they seen it Vindicated they saw it Vindicated therefore it caused a stimulation they saw a revelation revealed therefore it caused something on the inside of them to react by because they had something on the inside amen you know people people say well you know you tell those testimonies about sister Lana or you tell them about Sister Mariah you're telling them about sister Karen you're telling about Brother David or this one or that one or another you know why do we do that because it's the word that's been Vindicated or revealed it shows Jesus Christ Among Us amen therefore amen it causes a reaction it causes it to also stimulate faith I've seen it happen you go to telling testimonies and the goodness of God and the things of God Amen Faith starts building it starts stimulating on something on the inside of somebody else to say hey if God healed her he can heal me if God delivered that one he can deliver me Amen brother Tim told about brother Justin's salvation just throughout a few days ago and I can't tell you how many come up and said I want my son delivered I want my husband back I want my family back together I've God can do it for them he can do it for me it causes a stimulation of faith but darkness is trying to put it out and darkness is trying to say it can't happen and darkness is pushing against it but God said don't touch the oil in the wine don't don't touch that amen when I say God promise to do a certain thing in these days and he's promised to break these seals in the last day and you don't know the joy and the glory when I see he's revealed this and stand there and watch it happen and he said he never did say one thing to us about what what wouldn't happen and then to see the joy that's in my heart when I see his promise for this last day as he promised he would do it and here he is doing it he's vindicating it and he's making it perfectly right he said well I feel religious and people think we ought to sit around like a bunch of bumps on the log and come on now I saw my name in the book the book came open and I got a peek on the inside of there don't you think that amen don't you think that uh Haman he was after he was after Esther and Mordecai amen but the Bible said the book was open the book of remembrance was open one night and he began to read in there the king began to read in there and find out that Mordecai had saved his life and nothing had been done for Mordecai he said what what happened the book when the book came open Mordecai and Haman traded places Hallelujah when the book came open don't you think Mordecai got a little stimulated when he realized I had the Gallows that had been built for him no longer was for him but there was for the one who built them Amen in there Mordecai one but one woman was going to be hanging there and the next moment Haman is hanging there I believe that stimulated him a little bit and you mean to tell me I'm not supposed to get happy and Shout about things when I realize hell ain't for me no more I never was going to hell hell's not my home but it's for the devil and his angels the very one that's trying to kill me the very one that's trying to destroy me it's going to be destroyed [Applause] I'm not supposed to get excited about that I'm just supposed to well that's a pretty good story no it's a revelation stimulated by revelation the the ones in the upper room became so stimulated over the Revelation that they've been that the promise was Vindicated they broke out the joy of stimulation to the people said they're drunk with new wine when God revealed his promise to them and not only did he reveal it he proved it that's what I've always said a man can say anything but when God comes around and vindicates it and proves it the Bible said if there be anyone among you claims to be spiritual or Prophet if he says he sings it don't come to pass then don't pay attention to him don't fear him at all don't fear that man for what he says don't come to pass that's not me that's him but if he is sin but if he does speak it and it comes to pass then it's me you know there's a little Samaritan woman scripture said that Messiah would do things and he would he would vindicate a certain way and he would do this and she was she'd come down to a well and she she begins to talk to him and he begins to reveal things to her maybe the first time he said something she might have thought well he guessed pretty good on that but when he hit it Time After Time After Time After Time then what this was no guessing this wasn't no accident this was on purpose and began to tell her the the secrets of her heart this was an accident this was on purpose amen and listen all of these things that have taken place it's not an accident it's on purpose God is calling to the hearts of men and women on purpose amen revealing things and doing things it's not by accident and he's speaking to her and here she thought you know things were so important her water pot was so important this was so important you know her way she worship was so important and he began to check it off one by one by one by one and she said you know when when the Messiah comes he'll he'll do that he said I am he and that Revelation struck her heart and brother Brandon said when that became revealed to her that she wasn't standing before just a Jew or standing before just a prophet she was standing before a messiah she got stimulated there was a revelation that broke forth that you're beginning to realize hey this man told me everything he's exactly who he says he is amen she began to run into the city he said she'd done things unseemingly out of character for a woman of her of her type and who she was and one of her position it seemed unseemly but she became so stimulated by the Revelation that this is not just a Prophet this is the messiah hallelujah amen there ought to be the same people when you went down to a well one day and you was thirsty and you wanted to drink and you begin to realize the person talking to you was not just a preacher or not just somebody but it was Jesus speaking to you and something began to resonate hey that's the bless the truth I want to hear more about that I want to hear a man begin to make you act unseemingly you left family you left churches you left this or that and the other to find the truth because it was something stimulated you then stimulation started the way she went shouting shouting she didn't come and see what I've heard today it was great I had a good time uh she was shouting she left her old water pot and said come and see amen it caused her to act unseemingly it calls her to act unnormally amen she was changed it changed her whole thought process it changed everything about her it changed what she thought the doubt what the rest of the day was going to hold the rest of the day wasn't even important no more what was important is I need to go tell somebody to come taste what I have tasted to come see what I have saw because seed was coming to life and it was causing a stimulation on the inside oh okay it was something happening that was moving there was things that were taking place amen things were growing things were moving but here's this writer in Black Darkness been a white horse been a red horse black horse and here he is trying to put it all out blackness Darkness trying to make his last stand trying this I found light at its weakest spot I found it where it came it can't if I can just put it out it's over I found her in a weak moment and if I can just put that last little flicker of Hope out she's done if I can just put out that last little flicker trust it's over with if I can just stop it right here and he's pushing and he's blowing and he's about to make his last charge amen but all of a sudden out of the midst of the throne a voice speaks Amen brother Brown said this wasn't one of the beasts that spoke he said this was the lamb that spoke Hallelujah and the Lambs spoke and said don't hurt my all in wine don't you touch it that is mine it must go through Hallelujah why because there was a people in this age that was going to have to take a drink of it that was going to have to take the life of it that was going to have to become amen the oil in the wild would have to be poured out in this generation so there had to be oil and wine to pour out Hallelujah foreign Hallelujah he said in other words if you catch some of my little flock that's filled with my oil and wine or the pure word and you're going to kill them because you're going to do that that's what you're going to do don't you for you don't you force them to say any Hail Marys or do anything like that some of your Creeds you keep your hands off of them they know where they're going for they Anointed with my oil and being anointed my oil they have the wine of Joy because they know my Word of Promise and I'm going to raise them up again don't hurt that don't go try to messen them up just keep away from them hallelujah amen maybe you're here tonight and the devil has been trying to put out your last glimmer of hope and your last moments and your last time but there's a voice that is speaking he says don't touch them that's my all and that's my wine that's my people and they must go through they must go through there must be a people here for a body change there must be a people here for a Rapture a resurrection that's my people there had already been a white horse red it comes a black same Rider all the way down here he was charging for life measure wheat for a penny measure of barley symbolizing Spirit a whole and joy of wine foreign spiritual life but that spiritual life don't hurt that leave it alone and the voice is still speaking today that spiritual life don't hurt that leave it alone it's mine that belongs to me Hallelujah as we said he said it was not one of the four beasts that said don't touch the oil and wine the four beasts have been talking come and see but a little bit you see a measure a penny for a three measures of barley for a penny see that thou hurt not the oil of wine and art of voice in the midst of the four beasts what was it it was the lamb it wasn't the four beasts the lamb said it the lamb said it don't touch the oil in the wine the lamb said it amen we must still have the spirit we must still have the stimulation of revelation we must still have the oil we must still have a wine don't touch that the lamb said it he's going to take his own that belongs to him the redeemed it don't you touch that oil not of the four beasts but the lamb the four beasts didn't announce this the lamb said it itself coming the four Beast said come and see but the lamb said don't hurt the wine and the oil listen to it don't you heard it you're going to pay for it and I said I don't condemn a drunker for going out and getting drunk he's all Moody don't know he gets in the morning he's got the blues this isn't Tyson Spirits he said I hang over go it gets out and gets him two or three bottles of beer gets out and gets some whiskey and all kinds of stuff I don't blame on him but he said shame on you profess to be a Christian and rely on such things for Joy when the Holy Ghost Gospel is nothing but one great big Powerhouse of joy Hallelujah the Holy Ghost Gospel is a perfect intoxication for every man that's got the blues if you got the blues tonight why don't you take another drink come on now if you're all depressed why don't you take another drink if you're all down and dishearted why don't you take another drink why I just want to take my life don't take your life take another drink amen Don't Take Your Life take another drink of the Holy Ghost so let him pour down upon you let him wash over you again let him push out all that Darkness that's trying to put out your last flicker of Hope it's an enticing spirit that isn't trying to entice people away from the movement of the Holy Ghost and make it a cold formal religion I'm not interested in a cold form of religion you say well you're trying to make everybody shout no I'm trying to make everybody worship he may worship with your hands in the air and tears coming down your face and you can't say a word but just Worship in spirit and in truth the all and the wine the stimulation however it stimulates you let it work on you don't try to put caps on it and limitations upon it and say we can only do so much and put it in a box Let It Go and let it do its work he said you take a drink of the Gospel of Jesus Christ be filled with the Holy Ghost you're drunk until you leave this world now there's another woman that's drunk on the blood of the Saints she's intoxicated because of her murderous spirit murdering and killing and raping and pillaging and plundering she's drunk on it but there's also another woman that is drunk she's not drunk on her rapes and her murders and and all the all the things that she has done and that's the no she's drunk on the spirit of almighty God there's something else that is entire listen this world is intoxicated they literally have to be intoxicated to do what they're doing they're drunk on a certain drink it's a it's a spirit of laodicea and it's causing them to be blind and naked and they don't even know it that's a drunk person they totally lost all senses they totally lost everything about them they totally don't even know what's right what's wrong what's up what's down what's sensible what's not sensible they've totally lost all morals they have become drunk intoxicated and ready for Destruction but there's also another people that has also becoming drunk drunk on the holy spirit of God and it's so taken over there thinking that they can't think like this world thinks they can't think about how the things around them and all the situations they're not even concerned about that they are intoxicated for a Rapture for leaving here for it going away [Applause] it's a constant intoxication he said well I don't feel very intoxicated we'll take another drink it's a constant stimulation that's a quote I'm not coming it's a constant stimulation well I don't feel very joyful we'll take another drink it's Unlimited Supply if you ain't drunk it's your fault yeah if you ain't intoxicated it's your problem your fault it ain't because it's not there it ain't because it ain't affordable it's been made affordable it's been made free by the blood of Jesus Christ he gave his life and he shed it so his Spirit could be let loose amen we have the ability to get drunk well it might make me act a certain way well if you're worried about that you ain't never got to worry about getting drunk because you're worried about that more than being drunk but a person that's a real Drinker he don't care what he acts like after he gets drunk he don't care he could care less he could care less of what's going on around him once he's drunk they ain't a drunk person right now if you find a real drunk that could care anything about what happened yesterday in the elections they could care less red blue all I see is another bottle that's all he's interested in because he's a real drunk well there's some people in this world there's also a bunch of real drunks you're making me nervous I don't know about that brother there's a constant stimulation it's a constant intoxication drunk day and night that's the word of God hallelujah amen to yourself I don't feel it well take another drag start pulling some more in and say God I need more of you now the power of Revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of why natural wine is to stimulate is to bring a person that's all slumped down to stimulation man well I just I I was singing my own good song for somebody to slumped down I'm depressed I'm depressed every day that I live I'm depressed when I wake up in the morning when I lay my head to rest I'll kill myself I'll kill myself you're drunk on the wrong thing but if you start taking a drink and you start drinking in the word of God and you begin to realize oh oh look at there that's me right there mama mama that's me right there I'm blessed I am blessed every day that I live I am blessed doesn't matter if a democrat or a republican is in power I am blessed doesn't matter what's going on me I'm blessed it doesn't matter what's happening in the church I'm blessed Hallelujah is there any more blast Among Us you realize God is in our midst we're blessed God is healing us we're blessed God is saving our children we're blessed God is moving among us we're blessed God is putting families back together we're blessed is bringing the last ones there we're blessed any moment now the dead in Christ is going to rise I'm blessed it causes a stimulation of Revelation something on the inside when you realize I'm not going down I'm going up I wasn't born to be defeated I was born to defeat devils and run over hell and not let hell run over me [Applause] it's like the story of that Mouse foreign got chased around by that cat because I'm gonna kill you every corner I got you grabbing at his tail grabbing at this first thing you know that cat reached come over the counter jumped off fell into a wine jug yeah that Mouse did well until he thought it was a cat after he got through I guess that Mouse fell over that wine jug and he about drowned in that thing that's what you want you want some wine you can drown in not just some wine you can get your feet wet some wine you can just about drown in because the other way the only way to keep from drowning in it is to drink it and he starts drinking and he kind of blue finally he used to get so stimulated he forgot he was a mouse he pulled himself up and he looked over that old line that old lid of that jar and he looks at where that cat at now the story don't change he then got stimulated enough to believe I can whoop that cat I can beat that cat that cat ain't gonna beat me I'm gonna be that I'll come on somebody if you'll get stimulated and drunk enough you'll realize that depression ain't gonna defeat me I'm going to defeat it that's suicide ain't taking my life I'm gonna overcome it cause you've been drinking on the word of God and it stimulated you enough to your faith muscles began to pop out and you realize where's that devil at now it's meant to torment my child where is he at that's been destroying my family I'm here to take charge [Applause] it brings a person that's all slumped down to stimulation so in other words it gets you out of your slump Hallelujah that's a good one right there get out get out of your slump been in a slump hello it was a slump brother Timmy well it's kind of like a guy's trying to hit a baseball and he can't you know they call him they say he's in a slump he ain't hit nothing in a while hold for three one night over four the other night oh for five the next night over whatever o for L for over that sounds like a bowl for me over you brother Jewel would say wowzy wowzy booze I'm in a slump get out of it how do you get out of it you drink your way out of it I ain't talking about down at Dixie end either you drink your way out of it this is untapped resources there's bottles that the lids ain't even been taken off of yet they're just waiting for you to reach away foreign listen to Drunk if he's a real drunk he wants to be a real good drunk you know how to cure a good hangover get drunk again I'm talking spiritually now get drunk again the word gives stimulation of Joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction I'm satisfied I need the right sister Phillip I'm satisfied amen it brings stimulation that is Vindicated as prude it called in the scriptures that we want to refer to it a new wine these are drunk on new wine but really it should be a spiritual wine a spiritual wine as the natural line reveals itself and stimulated power so does the spiritual wine as this reveals the word of God which is Spirit the word itself is spirit and it begins to reveal itself and it's the spirit that quickeneth or makes alive it's the flesh profit and nothing but the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life there's a quickening power that comes with it it's not a dead Creed the word itself is Spirit it's spirit in word form when it's quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and it acts a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word when that when when that thought is presented it's a word God thought that he hadn't had in his place in his word and then we received it from him it becomes word god revealed to Moses what to do God spoke it and it happened and it begins to stimulate it begins to give joy because the word of God the new wine the spiritual wine stimulates and when it reveals the word then it brings Joy beyond measure sometimes it brings just such joy to you just get over flooded oh it ain't a little Trickle a little sprinkle a little dot hearing it no you get over flooded David said my cup overfloweth it runs over he said I know there's a lot of fanaticism people carrying on sometimes they do it when the music's jumping up and down and everything I know that goes on I believe that too I've seen people in the day when as long as the music's playing everybody's jumping and screaming when the music stop they stop that's that's still all right as far as I'm concerned people apparently don't read that part that's all still all right as far as I'm concerned as long as people lives right Hallelujah but you start bringing the word now that brings actually brings life is the word that brings the joy of stimulation of new wine and that's what it was on Pentecost on Pentecost when the word was Vindicated he said behold I send to you uh my promise of my father in New York but you go into Jerusalem and wait until amen Joel 2 28 he finds out he's going to pour out his spirit in Isaiah 28 and verse 19. then be stammer and lips and other tongues and all these things and somehow that's not even preached no more but it's right there in the seals one said well maybe we've waited long enough let's just accept it by faith let's just believe the message and we're saved that's what they that's what he just said let's just believe the message that he spoke and we're okay no no you got to have more than that he said that's a good Baptist Doctrine it didn't work with them brothers so the first thing you know it had to become a reality they waited on their Ministry for the word to be Vindicated and when you come to seek the Holy Spirit you do the same you wait until yes you can accept it by faith you can have you have to accept Christ by faith that's exactly right you accept the Holy Spirit by faith but let the Holy Spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness he's accepted your faith hello somebody we get to the Exception by faith I believe the message I'm saying I believe Brother Brad is a prophet and I'm saying no you're not you're not saved unless he comes and gives you that seal of circumcision to show you your faith has been accepted Abraham believed God was imputed him for righteous but God gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation he had accepted his faith so it's the same thing with us we must wait unto the Holy Spirit has done something not necessarily because we spoke in tongues or not because we danced or got emotional we shouted until we're changed until something actually happened I don't care what for me comes in just so it happens that's the main thing I believe in speaking in tongues but Brandon there's a lot of people in this message that don't but he did all those things other things that are all right it just that but just that in itself won't work you know it won't work so it doesn't do it I've seen witches speak in tongues lay a pencil down right another tongue somebody interpret it tell the truth wrote just exactly how it happened I've seen him throw Dustin ahead cut themselves a knife covered all the blood of the wildebeest or something calling the devil a hunt speaking of tongue doesn't do it though I speak of tongues of men and Angel and have not charity it probably nothing though I could do it so those sayings don't mean that you have the Holy Spirit but when he the person The Immortal Spirit of Christ becomes your personal Savior and changes you and changes you and puts your views right straight towards Calvary to its word then something has happened something is happening no one will have to tell you about it you'll know it's happened and when this new wine brings revelation when it's revealed that's the way it was on Pentecost they knew that there was supposed to be a spirit poured out upon them and they waited till this happened till this happened so something that happens is an experience till this happened and when the Vindication of Revelation took place then stimulation was upon them sure did they steamed up too right out in the streets they were where they were as afraid before and had the doors shut there they went out in the streets they'd been afraid to a group of people preaching the gospel to here they begin to preach gospel to them something that happened because the True Word of Promise had been Vindicated all right then Pentecost had Beyond Joy they was really stimulated he said I think it does anyone just take a just take a moment just think about David when he got all stimulated too he said my cup runneth over he'd had a great event that's like what caused him to do that was when he saw the word Ben returned again is when he got a glimpse of calvary and he saw the lamb hanging there and he saw him go down into hell but he said they will not leave my soul in Hell neither you suffer your hold on a secret ruption I tell you his cup got to run it over because he seen no matter what God was going to rise up he's saying the resurrection and his cup began to run over but he went through another dry spell in second Samuel they had taken the ark and the enemy had come in and took it we know the story they tried to hold on to it he said but it was too hot for them to hold he said they're God Dagan fell on his face and broke into pieces in front of it they tried it's the hottest thing they ever had on their hands they couldn't get rid of it fast enough they put it on an ox cart and started back and when David saw the art coming you know what he did he got so full of stimulation he seen the word being revealed back to Israel again and he danced in the spirit all around and around and around his cup got to run it over why he saw the word hadn't returned into his place he said I think that would make anybody get a little stimulated when they see after all of these years the true word has been Vindicated and is put back in his place again what a time we're living in [Applause] a time we're living in church we're not living under some man's Creeds or some man Dogma but we have fully witnessed the word has returned back again to its rightful place and his rightful position and everything has been put back the altar has been rebuilt the fire has come down and consumed the altar again and we have saw it and been Vindicated right before our very eyes and we're supposed to sit around like a bunch of bumps on the log nose sir no red no way no how not today tomorrow or any other day I've seen God Vindicated in this church again I've seen him moving like he said he would move I've seen him falling like he said he would fall I seen him free and delivering like he said he would I've seen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever right here Among Us walking up and down these aisles changing hearts and changing lives it causes something on the inside of me to say that's him that's him that's not just a man that's God himself moving and vindicating himself Among Us what a mighty God we serve what a mighty God we serve we don't have to be ashamed about our shouts the lamb said we could hahaha we don't have to be ashamed about our dance the lamb said we could come on now we don't have to be ashamed about our tongues and interpretation the lamb said we could we don't have to be ashamed amen when the joys of Heaven starts overflowing us and we raise our hands and we cry we shout or we dance whatever we do we ain't got to be ashamed about it we know what he's done for us we know that he visited us when something has happened it's not a make-believer a hope so or a fairy tale the Holy Ghost is Among Us and he's changing lives and he's filling us and he's moving us from glory to glory and one of these days we're going to be moved to that last Glory into that body to never go back again oh what a day that's going to be it fills my heart with stimulation to think about it one of these days this old rag's
