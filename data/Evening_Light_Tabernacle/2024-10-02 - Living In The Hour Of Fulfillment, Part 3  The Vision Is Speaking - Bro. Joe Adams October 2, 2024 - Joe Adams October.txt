enrapture us right now Lord we just commit Our Lives unto you today we give us service into your care father we pray you'll bless it now in the name of Jesus Amen if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to look back here at habac great to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight certainly enjoyed the message that brother Aaron preached this past Sunday I thought he did an outstanding job come on Church you do better than that thought he did an outstanding job we have a blessed Ministry team here I we're a blessed church we going to look here tonight at habca 2 and verse two and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that reth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it ter wait for it because it will surely come it will not t God bless you you can have your seats this evening so the we started this series just a few weeks back we spoke about a prophet and why God sent a prophet and the office of a prophet why a prophet must come and we understand by the scriptures that the word of the Lord only comes to a prophet and before then we spoke about the Winds of Pentecost still blow showing that what God does he continues to do what he is he still is or what he was he is what he did he still does proven that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if he was faithful yesterday then we will find him faithful today we will find him faithful tomorrow in the last service we spoke on under the cover of darkness and we brought out how that the end time conditions would be of the world the condition of the world at the end time how Darkness will cover the Earth but gross Darkness to people and we find that it's in that darkness that deception takes place and we spoke about the boycott and the image of the Beast and how all the churches will be gathered into the World Council of churches and everything that will transpire at that time but tonight I want to speak to you on that the vision is speaking yes sir the vision is speaking amen habc 2 we find again I want to read it habca 2 and verse three for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak yes this is a prophetic scripture here look we're living in the day where the we're living in the hour of fulfillment and the vision is speaking we're not waiting for it to speak we're watching the prophecies manifest in front of our eyes day after day week after week month after month we are seeing prophetic scriptures being made manifest right in front of our eyes that's right so we look here this word speak means to break out or Break Forth breathe out to come to pass and we understand that the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall bring forth right all right at the appointed time that God has allotted that this vision is going to speak or is going to manifest and and we find here don't be disappointed by a lack of expectation maybe you've never kept up with the news you never kept up with what's going on the in today in World politics and and what's going on in overseas and Israel but notice now I want you to understand prophecies are beginning to be made manifest even as of yesterday we find Iran attacked Israel and we find the scriptures regarding Israel that she would become a burdensome stone is being made manifest daily you recognize that her borderers she surrounded on every border by her enemy and yet she's still living let me tell you you're surrounded by your enemy and yet you're still living the bride of Christ is being attacked day after day after day the enemy is dropping bombs after bombs missile attack after missile attack mind battle after mind battle but little bride you're still here you're still living you're still overcoming and that which was spoken of Israel as the the natural bride is also speaks of you as the spiritual bride right the spirit and the voice of God is saying come and what is it doing it's manifesting the word of God for this hour now I'm going to try to slow down and teach a little bit of this tonight but I'm just a little bit caught up with it we look here in Daniel Daniel Daniel 9 and understand when I was gone brother Tim did a phenomenal job of picking this up and running with it I'm not going to do that kind of job tonight so I'm not going to disappoint you but I'm going to go into some other topics and maybe not quite like he did but we're a team so it it does US good to have some of this stuff reiterated to us but we find in Daniel 9 verse1 it says in the first year of Darius the son of azerus however you say that excuse me I'm not a theologian the seed of the mees which was made King over the realm of the Chans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Israel so we find Daniel begin to look back at the writings of Jeremiah to gain understanding in regards to those 70 years when will this be accomplished what will be the manif he's looking to find when that time comes notice just think about it like this Daniel in his day was looking for modern events to be made clear by the prophecy of Jeremiah come on church and we can learn and many prophets they will look back at the writings or the the the scriptures from the pre their predecessors and they would see what they prophesied and notice one Prophet can't prophesy something contrary to another and can be a God's a god called prophet he must his his prophecies must line up and we find Daniel looking back to what Jeremiah said so what brother Joe what did Jeremiah say we go to Jeremiah 25 and verse 7 I know I'm going a little bit fast I got a lot of ground to cover but I will slow down at some point Jeremiah 25 and: 7 yet you have not hearken unto me sayeth the Lord that you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hand hands to your own hurt therefore thus sayith the Lord of hosts because you have not heard my words notice the key element here you have not heard my words Behold I will send and take all the families of the north sayeth the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and will bring them against the land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and a Perpetual desolation moreover I will take from them the voice of merth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom the voice of the Bride the sounds of the millstones in the light of the candle and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years and it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished that I will punish the king of Babylon and that Nation saith the Lord for their iniquity and the land of the Chans will I make it a Perpetual desolation go to verse 10 for thus sayeth the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and I will perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place so Daniel is looking back to Jeremiah to gain understanding of when will this happen will when the destruction of Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian Empire be made manifest but not only the destruction he's more concerned about when will Israel return back to our homeland so we find now Israel's been exiled taken captive by Babylonian or the B Babylonians in Nebuchadnezzar due to their Disobedience to God that's right you have not hearkened unto me sayeth the Lord that you might provoke me to anger with your works and your hands so we find their Disobedience provoked God so God scattered them God God s another Nation to come and to overtake them and bring them captive and make them slaves but I want you to understand here in verse 10 that after the 70 years be accomplished at Babylon we have a promise now that God will visit and that we will perform his good word toward you and causing you to return to the land amen God has given a promise to Israel and that same promise lies with the supernatural bride today that you're not going to be indentured servants you're not going to be in slavery indefinitely but God has promised you when this time has been fulfilled when the time of the the prophecy has come to pass he will bring you back to the land of promise so every Prophet looks back to see what the prophets before them would say and we find here Daniel looks back at Jeremiah he's looking to see when is this going to be accomplished not merely the destruction like I said of Babylon in the land of Chad but the time that the Jews are going to return back to their Homeland now for many of us Jew the Jews have always been in Israel okay for most of us here tonight many of us we grew up only knowing that the Jews are in their Homeland so we're going to we're going to jump off here we're going to spend the rest of the service dealing with the Jews because I want you to understand tonight you're a type okay little bride you're they're your type that's the natural bride you're the spiritual bride yes sir don't miss that tonight recognize where they are recognize where they've been recognize they've been taken captive generations and generations 70 years no not just 70 years in Babylon but it actually has a compound two-fold purpose that they're prophesying Daniel that there was going to be an end time when God is going to wrap all of it up and bring destruction to your adversary oh Hallelujah tonight God ain't going to let that enemy go unpunished for his attack to you tonight that's right so notice here we find that God has promise I'm going to cause you to return or I'm going to cause in to return to the place and never did God bless Israel outside of her promised land and God young person God will never bless you outside of the promised land you may drive a fancy car you may make lots of money you may have a knockout wife for a a wife it doesn't matter but all I can tell you that ain't God's blessing your blessing lies in the land of promise look Abraham left the land of promise and the prophet God said there was not one miracle done there that's right all right but see we may be blessed we may be successful but that's not a sign of God's blessing in the message be certain of God brother B will tell us like this and so is our Modern Trend today falling away from the things of God and has brought the world to one greatest ulies that we've had and he calls it it's idleness just idling around great is the iniquity of the people today making plenty of money and think that God's blessing us because he's prospered us he said that's no sign of God's blessing not at all right then again he goes and he says now what we need today is not a lot of material things not a lot of amens on that one did we we have that we don't need greater churches we don't need greater congregations we don't need more Radio and on television we don't need so many more of these things but what we need today to be spiritual is a person that will humble themselves before God come on church if they haven't got a penny and will pray till the spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God and the Revival takes place on the inside of their heart that changes their attitudes and the atmosphere that they live in he goes you might not have a pair of shoes on your feet you might be dressed in raged but something in your heart is singing The Melodies of God I'd rather have that than all the money in the world yes sir oh Hallelujah so you can't say that Natural Things is always a sign of God's blessing that's right but notice God never blessed Israel outside of her Homeland and God promised Israel in Genesis 15 and verse 18 if you could go there God promised Abraham seed a land right yes so we find this early on in human existence in the origin which is Genesis means the origin of the Bible so we or the origin so we find here Genesis 15 and verse 18 in the same day that the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates the kenites the kites the catamites and the Hittites and the perizzites the rumes and the amorites and the Canaanites and the gites and the jebusites so God promised Israel this little stretch of land what's the big deal God promised them this land yes sir it's their land though they didn't occupy it already had squatters on the land it had tenants already on the land but yet God had already searched out the land god already made sure that it was a good land it was a plenteous land it was a land that flowed with milk and honey it was a land fit for his people otherwise God didn't want his people living in any other land but this little stretch of land let me tell you little bride God don't want you living off in some denominational existence God placed you in the promised land of the word of God and he sent you a message to bring you back to that little bitt Promised Land of the word and in that little land you're blessed hallelujah look little Israel she may have gone all through Europe and all through the Arab Nations and been successful but she never was blessed until she got back in her Homeland and little bride you'll never be blessed until you get back into the homeland of this world quit thinking about your own ideas and how Traditions that's been handed down from society or Generations it ain't about generational so uh hand me downs it ain't about generational of curses it ain't about man-made CES and dog it's about getting back to the homeland of the word of God then you'll be blessed then you can say Amen to the word then you don't mind getting a little excited a little emotional a little bit of Joy coming to the house of God cuz when you realize that's where your blessings l oh Hallelujah think about this the total area of the state of Israel is 22,45 KM or 8,630 square miles not very big Israel from from one point to the next the length of it is 420 km or 263 mies not very big and it's 72 mies across and the country is bordered by Lebanon to the north Syria to the North East Jordan to the east Egypt to the southwest and the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the mountains and plains and fertile land desert are often minutes apart so it's a blessed land fertile land and they say you can drive from east to west or from across it in 90 minutes and to make the trip from north to south it takes n hours not a very big country not a very big country at all but God promised them that land what am I telling you God has promised you the same it may not appear to much it may not look like much to a lot of other people but to us we recognize God gave us the promise of it and we're only going to be blessed inside of that land that's right but what we find due to Israel's Disobedience God dispersed them and there's a term that is used called the dispora or the Exile or the displacement and the Jewish dispora or Exile is a dispersion of Israelite or Jews out of their ancient ancestral Homeland the land of Israel and their subsequent settlement in other parts of the globe the term Exile here denotes the fate of the Israelites who were taken into Exile from the Kingdom of Israel during the 8th Century okay that's a long time ago go folks and the Judit from the kingdom of Judah who were taken into Exile during the 6th Century BCE so the first Exile was the Assyrian Exile the explosion from the Kingdom of Israel began by tiglath Pizer III of Assyria in 733 BCE this process was completed by Sargon I second with the destruction of the Kingdom in 722 after a threeyear Siege against Samaria and we also had the next experience of Exile was the Babylonian captivity in which portions of the population of the kingdom of Judah they were deported in 597 and again in 586 by the Neo Babylonian empire under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar the second so the Jewish dispor started long before the Romans got there okay but when the Assyrians conquered ear on 7:22 the Hebrew inhabitants were scattered all over the Middle East and these early victims of the dispersion disappeared utterly from the pages of History I want you to I'm trying to capitalize I want you to see way before even Christ came on the scene God's elect people were scattered that's right they were not in their Homeland right they were not in a place that they could be blessed a lot of it had to do with their Disobedience but we find here they say the historians would say it like this so from 597 onwards there were three distinctive groups of Hebrews a group in Babylon and other parts of the Middle East a group in Judea and another group in Egypt thus 597 is considered the beginning of the date of the Jewish dispora kicked out of their land and just as the Jews have been dispersed from their Homeland for more than 2500 years and Scattered throughout all the Arab Nations Egypt and European countries the true bride of Christ has been dispersed from her Homeland the word of God through seven Church ages she's been dispersed that's right she's been scattered because she followed ideas of man and we find here but God had promised just as he promised that Israel would be uh brought back to their Homeland God also promised that there would be a restoration of the brid tree notice in Ephesians 5:27 he said that he might present it to himself a glorious Church come on somebody say Amen he's talking about you he's going to present himself a glorious Church otherwise he's going to make ready a bride he's obligated to put you right where you can be blessed right where there be no spot there'll be no wrinkle there'll be no blemish you'll be perfectly lined up with the word of God for your hour remember brother Aaron said just last past Sunday it's the message of the hour that's right it brings the enlightenment for the hour and so we find here God had promised this and God be to deal with the Jews after the first world war and he dealt with them again after the second world war so the first world war 1915 191771 18 along those lines I want you to see this I'm going to bring some things out and I'm trying to hurry but I'm trying not to go too fast on thank you I will do that but we find he begins to deal with the Jews really we find a lot of it in the 1930s and the 1940s and I hope you understand what I'm alluding to there in the second world war but God began to do things and to Usher that little bride into her Homeland so at the same time God is beginning early in 19 175 in the first World War I want you to notice what comes on the scene for the spiritual bride in 1909 a prophet is born in 1933 at the age of 24 that Prophet preaches his first sermon in this that same year in 1933 he had seven continuous Visions then in 1936 he built brandom Tabernacle and was the pastor but notice things begin to shift and begin to change in 1946 he received an Angelic visitation on May the 7th of 1946 commissioning his worldwide Ministry and launching his campaign career into mid 1946 right so no longer now was it a local Ministry no longer was it just contained to Jeffersonville Indiana New Albany now the commission because God was calling not just the Jeffersonville people not just the people in New Aly and and Louisville Kentucky now God was raising up a messenger to scatter around the world to call those that have been dispersed throughout all the lands to call Hallelujah call them back to the promised land of the word of God and we find here his first sermon that he preached in 1947 as we would consider well under his commission now he preaches faith is the substance yes sir then we drop down from a few years here if you don't if you allow me to as we kind of get into the meat of the context of brother Brand's Ministry 1962 the restoration of the brid tree I want you to see God is beginning to call out a spiritual bride and these sermon titles are showing what is he doing he's calling it out in the 1962 why am I against organized religion because organized religion is the foreign lands let me tell you little bride you don't belong in a foreign land you belong in the land of the Holy Ghost you belong in the land of the word then he preachers in 62 is this the sign of the end s now he's trying to bring things down cuz showing look he's W God is going to be wrapping things up here in a few short years then in 63 the way of a true Prophet showing that you can have faith in this prophet that this is what you to look for then God hiding himself in Simplicity yes sir cuz see the theologians over complicated things and today a lot of people want to over complicate this message but it's not complicated oh Hallelujah in 63 the miraculous takes place the seals are revealed he preaches the seals he also preaches in 63 the indictment but why why did he indict to generation why did he indict to religious leaders because a Cru crucified the word of God they crucified your Homeland they were throwing bombs in your Homeland say that God don't do these things anymore the Holy Ghost don't act the way it used to act signs and wonders are something of yesterday but God sent a prophet to tell you it belongs Hallelujah in the Homeland healing belongs in the Homeland Deliverance belongs in the Homeland the prodical belong in the Homeland your destroyed marriage can be restored in the Homeland land Hallelujah notice then in 63 he preaches the uniting time and sign then the token the literal Life of Christ dwelling in the bride then he preaches Christ is the mystery of God revealed and in 64 God God's provided way for this day CU he don't want you to miss it that's right Sister Jenny he don't want you to miss it God's provided way for this day not Paul's day not Luther's day not Wesley's day today this day little church notice then he preaches the Mighty God unveiled before us oh these are beautiful sermon titles but it's more than a title it's God calling on that elect seed that's right God the Mighty God unveiled before us then in 64 the identified Masterpiece of God here he shows that the bride is his Masterpiece oh brother Aaron did it so wonderful for Sunday showing that many people have made this message about a prophet about a prophet about a prophet it never was about a prophet but it was about a prophet raising up and going into the far ends of the world to call out the elect to call out the disperse to call out that genuine true bride that's been disported through the lands and bring her back to the homeland of the word of God it never was about William brand it's always been about you little bride he's calling natural Israel and he's call call in spiritualism come home to the word come home to the land and let me bless you tonight let me pour out my blessing that's where you'll be blessed is in the land of promise then he preaches the sea is not air with the shut 1965 then he preaches the anointed ones at the end time showing there's going to be anointed ones the anointing is true but they're false but but there is a genuine anointing at the end time then he preaches Christ is revealed in his own word right here Christ is not the denomination not man's idea not man's view not your idea your view but Christ is revealed right here how when it comes to pass when the word is fulfilled amen amen then in 65 he preaches the invisible Union of the bride of Christ where there is an visible Union takes place before the Rapture let me tell you little bride you better have that Union tonight don't wait then in ' 65 toward the end of 1965 I believe it was in December he preaches the Rapture the secret snatching away of the Bride then he preaches things that are to be and in modern events made clear by prophecy all of this to to get a bride yeah to bring you back to the homeland of the word we call it the message of the hour that's our homeland that's where we're blessed the Jews call it Israel it's a little land it's despised it's hated by its enemies they're all around trying to destroy it let me tell you but for you it's a glorious land and for Israel it's a glorious land for them brother B says in 1947 experience the church has failed see instead of bringing the people together as one body it's separated them out so the church will never take the people over Jordan you believe that the church will never take the people over Jordan because the Baptist are going to take you to a Baptist view the Methodist are going to give you a Methodist few the Pentecostals give you a lot of excitement but ain't going to give you no word and then you got the Lutheran and the Holiness they're all going to give you their view oh but when God sends a prophet and God sends a messenger he's not giving you that view and that view and that dogma and that Creed and that idea he's giv you God's revelation for the word so that you can be blessed in the Homeland and if you got a need it's in the word you got a need for healing it lays in the word that he is the same yesterday today and forever and what God did he does and what he is or what he was he still is little bride notice this Propet begins to call out and and we find the scriptures come out of her my people so notice you don't belong to the systems you belong to God come out of her come out of the denominational systems come out of the foreign lands come out of Egypt come out of the Arab Nations come out of all the European countries that you've been dispersed to little bride and come back to the word of God and be not partakers with her plagge so we find as early as 1947 God be to restore a bride amen all right word on top of word on top of word on top of word on top of word begin to Resto how important are you little church I mean come on how maybe you woke up this morning you didn't feel very important but God sent you a message to pull you out of that nonsense to pull you out of your own thinking to pull you out of that system of religion that maybe you've been tied up in some of you come out of the Baptist some of the older ones some of you young ones you ain't never known nothing but a message Pew but for some of us we come out of those man-made Creeds we come out of those foreign lands and let me tell you I know what it was in the Baptist Church I know what it was like in a Pentecostal church I know how dead it was in the Methodist church but I now I know how it is to be in the homeland of the word I know the joy of serving the Living God I know the realities of the Holy Ghost I know healing I know Deliverance I know the manifestation in this hour cuz why cuz we're in the whole land of the word of God oh Hallelujah so no longer was it a local Ministry now become a worldwide Ministry to call out the elect oh Hallelujah and brother man will tell us this and I'm going to try to go probably 45 minutes so 45 more minutes just putting y'all own flash leave it don't look at that clock notice he says God deals with the Gentiles as individuals yes Israel as a nation so he deals with you personally amen so Jay you can't get in on brother L Joseph you're not going to get in on me Jude as good as you are nice looking tall dark and handsome you're not getting in on your daddy girls you're not going to make it on Mama God deals with us as individuals but he deals with Israel as a nation notice now in Matthew 2 4 and verse one and Jesus went out and he departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple and Jesus said unto them see you not all these things for verily I say unto you there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and he sat and in verse three he said he sat in the Mount of Olives and the disciples came unto him properly saying tell us they're inquisitive tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world and we're still wanting to know the end of the world I'm giving you a clue tonight if you just watch you'll find your time piece Matthew 24:1 15 notice they ask when will it be in Jesus in 24:15 he says when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken by Daniel the Prophet and then Gabriel's instructions to Daniel brother BR says now he's talking to the Jews they want to know what about this Temple when will it be destroyed when will it be rebuilt when will there come a time that there won't be one stone left on another how long will it last otherwise when will the end time come and brother B says now this is one of the most important scriptures in the book don't let this go over your head tonight church he said this is one of the most important scriptures in the big what does he do it tells the closing of the Jewish Nations referring to Daniel 9 the the closing of the Jewish Nation the Jewish people this scripture the 70 weeks it discloses and tells exactly from the time that Daniel started there until the end of the consummation and he says it's one of the greatest time pieces so if you want to know where we are if you want to know what day of the week it is you look at the calendar if you wanted to know what time it is it is practically 801 I look at my clock but if you want to know where we are in time in the essence of the end time you watch Israel Israel is your time piece there're your watch there're your clock that's why it's so important for us to understand Daniel's 70 weeks look it doesn't pertain to the Gentiles it doesn't pertain to us at all it pertains to the Jews but you can watch the Jews you can watch where Israel's at she's been been dispersed throughout many lands but now today she's back in the Homeland I'm not going to try to get ahead of myself he said it has nothing to do with the Gentiles those Seven Seals seven plagues seven woes seven trumpets has not one thing to do the Gentile church will be in glory at that time oh come on somebody yeah that Gentile church we ain't going to be here when destruction comes let me tell you when when we leave we're going to wave at those atomic nuclear bombs byebye hope you hit your target we're gone brother BR would tell us and I spoke of it last time she's up at the in the eternities up in heaven getting married oh come on some of you little brides yes sir you just waiting for that day man got to go check my venue out got to make sure it's going to satisfy all my guests let me tell you he saids I go to prepare a place for you and if it were not so I would have told you let me tell it's a great land let me tell you where we're going is a great land little bride but you got to come back to this land before you get to that land come on some of you put a smile on your face it's Wednesday night it don't pertain to us but we can watch the clock and we can see exactly where we are that's right oh I love this he said it discloses the facts that God Deals Only with the Jews when they are in the Homeland hallelujah oh yes so we look at Isaiah 11:11 you don't have to turn there but I just want to paraphrase so Isaiah 11:11 is a scripture that predicts or prophesies that God will gather the children of Israel back to their Homeland so God ain't going to leave his elect dispersed oh come on I mean some of you got wer children out there God ain't going to leave that seed dispersed uhuh a Son of God can go a long time brother Daryl before he recognized he's a Son of God but apps a seed in there he belongs in the Homeland he belongs in the word he may be on their deathbed but let me tell you he's coming back cuz God's got a prophecy over him God's got a word over him and that word will not return for but he will go and snatch up that little seat they may be two breaths away from entering to the other side before they give their heart to God but God's determined right let me just say it like this God is determined to get his bride in the Homeland God is determined to get the elect into a land that he can bless them why is all this Beall me God's trying to get you in a land oh my Jeremiah 29 And1 as we read the Prophet Jeremiah predicts that Israel will return to their Homeland after the 70 years of captivity then Genesis 17 god affirms with Abraham the Covenant I've given you this land not just a land not just any land this land something special but that little sliver of Landen notice brother man says I've always told you if you want to know what day of the week it is look at the calender but if you want to know the time we're living in watch those Jews that's the only time piece God LED no certain time for the Gentile there was no certain space of time he says and that's where I think that many great writers mixed it up trying to apply this to the Jew and Gentile because he said thy people but he was talking to Daniel not to the church Daniel's people is the Jew that's right so he was talking to the church see he goes if he was talking to the church you can't make that run nowhere you're you're way way back he says even before the coming of Christ it'll run right out any kind of prophetic weeks you want to you want to put it in it's already run out but he was talking to the Jews so therefore the Jews is God's time pieace so Daniel 70 weeks has nothing to do with the church the 70 weeks has nothing to do with the church so why is it so important because they are your time piece some of you know what day it is today October the what how'd you know that I don't know some people you need to get a calendar but you know it's October 2nd because you woke up many of us have iPhones and right on the front screen it tells you October 2nd and it tells you the time so now Gentiles brother B says was not a lot at a certain time the time of the Gentiles and when we find out Jesus didn't lot them time for we find out in Luke and he goes to Luke 21- 24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive and to all the nations of Jerusalem shall be trien down of the Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles is fulfilled so we don't know how long that time is but we do know that there was 70 weeks a lotted to the Jews that's right so if you want to know where we are you just put your eyes on little Israel and you keep your eyes on little Israel and that's why you don't curse Israel because he that cursed her will cursed and he that blessed her will be blessed amen he said there isn't a lot of time but nobody knows when it will be talking about the Gentile now he said the Gentile time but the Jews we cannot tell time by what the church whether it's backslid or whether it's going on or what it's doing you can't tell by that but look at the Jews that's the time calendar do you see it God did lot them exactly a day an hour of time but he never the Gentile he did the Jews so let's watch the Jews amen then you'll see where you're at and in Matthew 24:32 he says now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender he putteth forth his leaves and you know that summer is not and before we get to Matthew 24:32 we find Jesus he speaks of the signs of the end in Matthew 24 3-14 the abomination of desolation in Matthew 24:1 15-28 and the coming of the son of man in Matthew 24: 29-31 so we find all this he wraps it all up in Matthew 24 what is how it's exactly going to play out so we find there's going to be a signs of the end there's going to be the Abomination desolation but during that time God's going to there's going to be the coming of the son of man and the Fig Tree is going to put forth buds cuz he's giving you something to look for he's giving you something a road Mark when you drive down the highway you know before we had GPS you know before we had atlases that we toted around in our cars they would say turn a certain certain place you're going to see this big sign here and you're going to turn and take it right there or this here and so we find that this budding fourth of the Fig Tree is a marker telling us where we are on the road map that's that you're close to going home that's so Israel he says now here in 1960 and I want you to the clue in here I'm paying attention to that clock trust me and Israel for her first time for 2500 years is restored again to Jerusalem he says oh people don't let that go over your head right that's the Fig Tree putting forth its buz this generation he says 40 years is declared a generation and it's already been a long time way into 10 to 12 years he says we're into the last generation ation he preached this in 1960 so now Israel is 76 years old as a nation and I ask you Church how close are we we're 76 years Israel is as a nation how close are we don't let this go over your head don't let what happened yesterday to Israel being attacked by Iran being in war with Hezbollah don't let these things go over your head watch up yeah look and see what's happening because any moment God can come and snatch away this little bride because she is the time piece we don't know the hour we don't know the day no man knows the Bible says the day that you think not but one thing we do know you can put your eyes on little Israel and you can see God dealing with her and that's your time piece let me tell you the coming of the Lord just throw everybody in the church tonight into desperation Lord I Want My My Heart Right Lord I want to live a true life in case you come tonight I want to be snatched away sir yes sir I don't want to be left down here I don't want to be left for Destruction he says here sir we will see Jesus a nation will be saved when Israel comes it will be just borned overnight when Israel will come to God at one time and in May 14th 1948 Israel was officially declared an independent state with David benguan the head of the Jewish agency as the Prime Minister and notice in May 1948 Israel declared its independence and was immediately invaded by armies of five Arab Nations as soon as it declared its independence it was invaded let me tell you the enemy has done everything it can to destroy Israel and your enemy has done everything it can to destroy you but she still standing there was over 200 missiles thre at her yesterday and she has three Defense Forces and all three of them operated simultaneously they said it was an act of God just like The Parting of the Red Sea not one missile landed in a particular place they let it in sand they let it in water and it caused no destruction to Israel you telling me that Iran got it so figured out that they can't bomb a little land like this they can't hit the target what am I telling you the devil can't hit his Target tonight he can't hit you tonight your God's elect you're God's elect tonight he's got to go before your father to get permission before he Touch One hair on your [Applause] head let me get just a tad bit more volume because my little controller ain't working oh Hallelujah God deals with Israel only when she is in the her Homeland pay attention only when she is in her Homeland Abraham left a Homeland and went to Egypt what happened he walked away from the will of God never was blessed till he returned back to the Homeland God never dealt with him not One Vision not one nothing else till he was back in the Homeland right so why does the nominal system don't have what we have it's not the Homeland oh church not trying to set ourselves apart make something big of ourselves God placed us here God gave us this message God sent you a prophet to call you out of those systems he says oh God we're glad today to see Israel coming to our homeland of nation the old Sixpoint star David flying under them Jews were turning say they'll never come back in to die in the Homeland but they come back to see the Messiah oh hallelujah oh they come back to see the Messiah he said now he said God we know then that our hour our days are number we're watching watching just as Noah watched Enoch and not immediately after Enoch come to judgment was going to strike the Earth we see the Ark of the Jew being prepared again we know that the translation is at hand then we find in the seventh week of Daniel brother B says after the first world war so God be to deal with the Jews so for 40 years they began to come into their Homeland then we get into 1930 33 and there become a man who rose on the scene over in Germany by the name of Adolf Hitler but before him in 1922 25 there's a man named melini that rises on the scene and we go into a whole another story on them maybe another service but for tonight brother BR said God went to harden melini's heart Hitler's heart Stalin's heart hearts of men all over the country hating the Jews why why did God go to harden their hearts push him get back get to the Homeland oh get back in the Homeland get back where I can bless you so he be to harden man's heart no he said it was in Germany up in Russia Italy the people raised up Joseph Hitler stal melini who hated the Jews they had to go back to their Homeland he said God you got ways of doing things that we don't understand understand that's right and you press them no home in Germany everything taken away from them also in Italy Russia no place to go they were sent back to their Homeland just to fulfill the word and so is it for the bride you have no home in the Baptist system you have no home in the Pentecostal Church you have no home in Wesley's Methodist system our Luther's Lutheran system our homeland is the word of God and in this word there's signs there's wonders there's healings there's Miracles there's Deliverance whatever you have all the precious Promises of God lay in the homand then he says in the third exod oh the loving hand of God how sometimes it looks cruel the way that people suffer but it still it's the tender hand of Jehovah you're telling me that a great world war is the tender hand of Jehovah World War II was a deest military conflict in terms of total dead 75 million people casualties included military and civilian around 3% of the world's population died as a result of World War II many civilians died because of deliberate genocide massacres Mass bombings disease and starvation the Soviet Union lost 27 million people during the war 8.7 military 19 million civilians Germany sustained 5.3 military losses mostly on the Eastern Front fighting fighting Russia and we find Nazi Germany as part of the deliberate program of extermination systematically killed over 11 million people and six million Jews of that 11 million so in addition to Nazi concentration camps the Soviet Googs or labor camps led to the death of 3.6 million people yet after all this death after all this destruction after all this cruelty it's the tender hand of Jehovah that's right yet some of us would disagree how could God do that how could God permit that cuz God is determined to get his people back in the home God's determined where he can get them to bless them notice they were never going to see the Messiah in in the Arab Nations they were never going to see the Messiah in Egypt they were never going to see the Messiah in those European countries they were only going to see the prophecy said only in the land of promise that God already picked out searched out and dedicated and deed it over to them they only see the Messiah in that land that's where the blessing is that's where the blessing lies it's not with wealth and prosperity but it lies and seeing church it's seeing the Messiah and in the promised land of this word we're going to see our Messiah we're going to see our Jesus we're going to Rapture out of here in the land of promise that's why we got to get back that's why we got to encourage the Y get back to the word get back to the Homeland don't be ashamed of the emotion don't be ashamed of this message don't be ashamed of the excitement it brings it brings a reality we're not going back to the Homeland to die we're going brother to see the Messiah we're going to meet Jesus we're going to a wedding supper Hallelujah the tender hand of Jehovah leading his children back to the Homeland God is more determined than you are to make sure you're where you need to be did you hear that God is more than termined why does he let certain things happen to your offspring that are wavered why does he let certain calamities come oh God take this off of no God keep it on oh God God take this off no God keep it on them cuz we want you to Mo push them we want you to press them we want you to Drive sister Diana back to the land of promise but if we pray God remove your hand how's he ever going to get them there no God there was many prayers going forth for the Jews during that time but they would have never went back to the Homeland have not been for Hitler have it not been for melini have it not been for Stalin have it not been for a great world war have it not been for many lost life but God used it for his glory and today Israel is a Nation again the Sixpoint star David is flying over there and they got great Innovative Technologies more than any other country Israel is a great nation today because she's in her land oh Hallelujah notice he said it's one of the greatest time pieces I got to hurry up so 40 Years of coming back since the first world war the Jews have returned back to their own land God never did deal with the Jews until she was in her land and then true Jews now he's talking about it them that never had the opportunity now brother there sure 144,000 amen there's 12 Tribes of GAD tribes of ashers tribes of Reuben 12 tribes they were where were they all standing on Mount Si Jews back into the Homeland see that's where they were ceue up that picture if you would or that slide please I want to share something we hear Brother him talk about that old Rabbi he talks about are you going home are you going home to die he says no we're going home to see the Messiah and we find here in Exodus 19 and verse4 you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear you up on Eagle wings and brought you unto myself so they had a prophecy that one day they were going to be lifted up On Eagle's Wings and brought back to God brought back to the Homeland and here in May of 1949 you can turn to the next slide 1949 the country of Y or yeeman excuse me if I say that wrong y'all just have to excuse my Mississippi ignorance allowed the majority of its Jewish population to leave Israel immediately jumped into action launching operation on the wings of an eagle sir a covert airlift operation next slide to bring tens of thousands of humanite Jews to their new home in Israel the operation's official name originated from the scripture you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself Exodus 19 and verse4 next slide during the operation nicknamed operation Magic Carpet some 49,000 yite Jews mostly children were airlifted to Israel from yean and addin and another couple other countries there and Saudi Arabia next Slide the mission was secret only revealed to the media after its success next slide look at this they're all preparing next slide next slide they're waiting next sles they're waiting they're ready to be lifted up on the wings of an eagle to go back to their promised land next sles here we find them now they're on the plane they're barded the plane there ain't no turning back come on little Bri there ain't no turning back today we're are barded the plane this time any day now we're going to be caught up on E wings and be lifted up into an eternity next slide here they are boarded true Jews true Jews for br said it's not those Wall Street Jews that's the true Jews and from this these Jews he's going to call out 144,000 next slide here's the quote I was talking about here in beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation he says notice here not long ago I've seen a prophetic real play from over there and they're bringing in those Jews by the thousands by airplanes I was reading that thank you I say look I got a good memory but not quite that good you seen it in the paper and so forth look in life Magazine's been packing and thousands of Jews returning and they ask him said what are you returning for old people pack people packing on their backs their young ones was said are you coming back to the Homeland to die said no we're coming back to see the Messiah let me tell you why do we come back to this word we didn't come back to die we didn't come back to be buried we didn't come back to bring coures we came back to go to the H land we came home and God promise I'm going to lift you up on Eagle T and what did he do he sent you an eagle he sent you a prophet he sent you a message to lift you up and take you out of denomination on manmade systems I'm coming to a close here shortly let me read something to you 1949 Mr oeri his parents he was the second child he was four months old in 1949 his 20-year-old father and friend loaded up their donkeys and went to the market he said Yan was a very backward country we didn't have news we didn't know what an airplane was if you went to a big city he goes you'd see a car but very few people went to the big city so donkeys thank God we don't live in yeman he said the village all Jewish very close proximity to all rare Village made up about 40 Jewish families all inter married with each other because they were disconnected from other Jewish community so everyone was related to everyone to Market toown was a big city at TZ which my grandmother said was about half a donkeys ride away well this is how you measure time once on the road notice once on the road the two men Mr oi's father named n which means Miracles met a stranger also on donkey back that man was a esan Jew he didn't look Jewish but he said Shalom malum to them and they just looked at him and startled they said who are you he said I am a shile a messenger from Israel from Israel he says from Israel a state of whose existence they had not heard although it was a land where they believed someday their descendants would visit they said you don't look Jewish but the shelite he started reciting the sheima and by the end of their first paragraph they said we believe you and the shac said you should go back to your Homeland look he told him we have our own State now we have a leader whose name is David Ben gurian and another leader who is MOSI and he goes now said they ask well how would we get there and he said the airplanes will be waiting for you in Aiden the British control y seap Port about two week donkey ride away so they asked him what is an airplane and he took out a piece of paper out of his pocket and he drew on it and they looked at it and they said it looks like an eagle so I'm trying to P I'm trying to bring your reality when you hear brother Brandon quote these quotes now you can see the images in which he saw now you can see the detail in which they live notice now he says that's what God promised to send us to take us there Exodus 19 God talks about bringing Israelites out of Egypt On Eagle's Wings and the promise of in the Gathering of the Exiles on Eagle wings Echoes into the Jewish dreams he goes back on the dusty road to Y the man pulled out a loaf of bread out of a bag and he said this is what I brought you so take it back to the village and show them and tell them he said so my father and his friend they turned around they went back to the Village they told the rabbi the rabbi said assemble everyone in the synagogue they said to haleel in a service of gratitude and Thanksgiving on the that set on holiday days and they said the blessing for the New Year's and then the rabbi told everybody to be ready to move in 5 days see there was something in their heart they didn't have to debate about it they were ready to get back to a Homeland that they never seen they didn't even know existed but something inside of them called them back to it oh Hallelujah he say so we went to Aiden he goes in 5 days they left they rode their donkeys to Aiden and so we went to Aiden and the jdc the Jewish agency took good care of them and they prayed that God would send the Eagles and that was the air lft sometimes known as operation flying carpet but known to the people who had brought new lives as on the wings of eagles and this is where brother Brown says that old Rabbi stood there and he said remember our Prophet said when we go back to the Homeland we're going to be carried back on the wings of an eagle so it's the Homeland church and brother brand almost went to Israel but I want you to know Israel was never promised a gentile Prophet they were promised a Jewish Prophet so he couldn't go he said I made a split second decision but he said the spirit spoke to me says not now this is not the time the cup of iniquity of the Gentiles is not yet full go back oh because God has two prophets ready for Israel and notice in 1948 Israel's population was 800 6,000 today is 9.8 million people with 75% being Jews yes sir oh Hallelujah prise God 2500 years the Jews has been scattered to every nation under Heaven God hardened Pharaoh's heart bringing them back he hardened Hitler's heart melini's heart and so forth till he drove them back to Palestine coming back they had made them a nation again on May the 6th 1947 the Jewish flag was raised over for the first time for 2500 years the oldest flag in the world was raised for the first time in 2500 years are you coming back to the Homeland to die they said no we're coming back to see the Messiah Allelujah he said the Fig Tree is putting forth its buds he goes oh the great Church of the Living God notice he parallels this down to the bride he said the great Church of the Living God will be raised like on wings of an eagle packed out out yonder into Glory why did God send you a prophet he sent you an eagle because what he does in the natural he also does it in the spiritual that's right when is God going to start this last week speaking of the 70 weeks of Daniel it may be today it may be before the sunset tonight God will declare he says we are at the Homeland the Jews are in the Homeland we're at the End of the Age ready for the Rapture the Rapture comes the church goes up we're caught up to meet him in the air we know that the stone that was cut out of the mountain is ready to come at any time and when it comes what does it do it does away with the Gentile age it's all over and God completely quits dealing with them let him that be filthy be filthy still and him that Holy be holy still so the Gentile church is in the leot Dean age we're at the end of the leot Dean age the Jews are in their Homeland the Gentile apostate is already taken place he says we have a president like we have we have a nation that has broke up like have we have atomic bombs hanging in the hangers we have a church that lukewarm we have a church of people that draws theirselves together we have a Ministry that patterns the ministry of Jesus Christ for to catch the stone when it comes what's left to happen it might be any minute there isn't nothing left we're at the end but we got a Time piece he said and it's time for the Rapture don't don't you remember as soon as the church goes then the Jews take hold of and it comes first the next thing is order is the mighty nation a national Revival he goes it's not a a mighty nation or a national Revival for amongst the Gentiles the next thing in order is the coming of the Kingdom the coming of Christ amen and I'm going to bring this to a close here in 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 6 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout and the voice of an archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then they which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words that word caught there is harpazo which means to take by force to catch away to plug to carry off by force to seiz to claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out of the way he goes I believe we're living in the coming days of the Lord and he goes to church has got to go completely into desperation he goes now in the end the messages see the action of the great Holy Spirit we see him come down visible among the people even taking its picture it's working and showing it's not a man it's not just a preacher it's not a certain congregation it's the Holy Spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ now it's embodied in the body of the bride and it should throw us into desperation all church but when he comes the day of the Lord he comes with three things the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians 5:2 for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night see a thief not only he doesn't give a notice of when he's coming he's knocking on your window he's not knocking on your door he's coming in so secretly that you don't even know he's there and the coming of the Lord is so secretly that you don't know he's there for some of us we look over in Israel and we don't think anything about it but he's coming so secretly but all along he's given you signs all along he showed you she's in her Homeland you're in your Homeland I've sent you a message notice now but God has said in his word that it would be like a thief in the night coming and that would be people the people of the world think well you know it's just I got plenty of time it'll be all announced but you see it's announc but it's a secret announcing amen it's just those who are willing to hear it those who are willing to consider it those who love the Lord for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven notice he descends musicians can make your way back with a shout what is a shout brother the first thing that comes is he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it a message right it's a message to get the people together a message comes forth first it's lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps he said some of them found they didn't have oil in their lamps but it's lamp trimming time it's Malachi 4 time and we find the second thing happens is that there is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice loud voes in St John 11:38 that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together then the resurrection of the Dead Sea caught up with it see now watch the three things take place next is what a trumpet see the third thing is a trumpet which always is at the Feast of the trumpet is calling the people to a feast and that'll be the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky oh he says we're right there ready now the only thing the church is coming out has got to lay lay before the sun to ripen the great combine will come by after a while the wheed will be burned the stalks but
