and I believe the Lord just dealt with some hearts in a real way God used used us brother Timothy also to minister the words of life and we saw the Holy Spirit just move hey man god bless you brother Johnny good to see you today and each one of you that is assembled with us a man so we today as we just approach the throne of grace and looking to God we want to turn to the Bible and Titus chapter 2 verse 11 and we want to read from there today as we just look to the Lord and ask for his grace to us today Titus 2:11 but the grace of God bring us salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us denying ungodliness and worldly lusts that we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ amen you believe he's our great God and Savior a man Redeemer and we're looking forward to to that glorious appearing it's Our Blessed hope and man I've ever believer here today and for you're seated I'm going to read just a little little quotation from the testimony of a true witness so if we are a Christian and we're born of the Spirit death can hold nothing but victory for us because this old corruptible body that Satan still has power over will drop into the dust of the earth this is a wrong season now is mortal season when the but the immortal season is coming when the immortal one comes he will bring with him the immortal spirits that has returned to him from the earth and they will come forth again in the resurrection for the great millennium and shine in his glory hey man god bless you you can't be seated we're gonna speak today as we just kind of bringing along our subject again as we've been talking about the coming of the Lord and we want to rejoice in that blessed hope this morning because that is our only hope when we see sin abounds and when iniquity abound in and evil on every hand we know then they only hope we have is in Jesus coming back being prepared for that great day when we will be gathered there with him but so Paul was telling Titus that we're looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing and as we shared with you a little quotation from brother Branham that we're in the wrong season right now it's a mortal season and in this mortal season there's sin and death and sorrow and sickness and pain and every other thing that goes with being mortal but when the immortal one comes you know it's going to change seasons and and yet you know we have had great things that have happened in our day we've seen the Holy Spirit move as a fig tree would put forth her bud and all the other tree's and we're in a time in an hour of restoration we have seen the heavens open and seven angels step forth from there and reveal the seven seals and and uh an anointing the mighty angel Christ coming down in Revelation chapter 10 which is a great anointing and outpouring of his spirit upon the earth as we know the scripture said he would pour out his spirit in the last days and yeah and yet that is that is of course we can look back to revelation 10 and we can say that isn't a the immortal one but yet it's not it is not the completion because it is not the Corporal and physical return of our Lord and so we are still here in the mortal season a man no matter how much we have seen God move and we certainly have yet we're still here in the mortal season and so the immortal one that we're looking for has not come but we are looking for his return and I think this should be the hope that we have is ever believer that Jesus is coming back to earth again hey man we're gonna meet him in the air and this time but yet he will also come to the earth and take over the earth for the millennium ahead Nepal teaches us in Ephesians that when Jesus ascended he took with him those that had been held captive in the grave and this is of course when he left the earth after his resurrection that when he rose that the dead in Christ rose also and the Apostle is referred to what Jesus did at the grave for he descended first to the lower parts of the earth and we find this in a piece in chapter 4 in verse 8 and Paul is actually quoting the scripture from the book of songs and so this is why he begins of saying wherefore he saith so he is actually referring back to the Psalms where that under the Spirit of God the anointing was spoke and the word was prophesied and he said when he ascended on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men so as another translation would say this is why the scriptures say when he ascended to the heights he led a crowd of captives and gave gifts unto his people or again he is send it into the heavenly heights taking his many captured ones with him and gifts were given unto men and then it and then he goes on and explains in verse nine that he ascended but he also descended first in the lower parts of the earth and so he deceived that the Senate is the same that I send it far above all heavens now these these are going to be some very key point as we we talked today about where Jesus is now because that's what we're wanted to speak to you where is Jesus now we're looking for him to come back but where is he now what is he doing now what is this present office and what is the work he's doing hey man so we want to know where he is and then how he will come and so we're going to be speaking on that today where is Jesus now so now so he said what what does he does what does he ascended mean except also he descended to the lower earthly regions or into the depths of the earth he who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens to in order to feel the whole universe so Poland establishes he ascended to the highest level of all heavens this is where that he resides her abides today is in the highest realm of heaven now if you look with me to first Peter chapter 3 and verse 18 he says for Christ also has suffered once for sin now there just for the unjust then he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit that means made alive by the spirit but which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedient when what and the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water so we know that the Bible teaches us that when when Jesus died that he was alive still living though he had left his corporal body in the grave right it was in the tomb but yet he is still alive and he had descends into the lower parts of the earth and man he is active he is preaching he is speaking there even in the regions of the loss and identified himself as the fulfillment of the scripture a man to those who repented not in the days of Noah this is an illustration has given he his shows that he actually appears into the reasons of the loss and identifies himself as a fulfillment of Scripture are you with me a man but you saw but but I want you to get it that not only did he visit the realm of the Lost but he also goes to the realm of the blessed where the Saints in paradise are waiting and they have been waiting for this Redeemer to come now for thousands of years Adam has been in the grave now for thousands of years Methuselah Noah on and on and on have been down in the grave right down to the prophets that would be down to the ages Jeremiah Isaiah Ezekiel Malachi they're all there and they're all waiting and they're waiting on Jesus to come I want you to get a picture now the Saints these Old Testament Saints they are waiting on Jesus to come the Redeemer because they can't come in the presence of God yet because they have no blood that will remove some all they have is a substitute atonement that only rolled in a head the debt of Santa head until the Redeemer could come and pay the price but when Jesus comes remember when he appears there and the regions of the blest this is called Abraham's bosom or in paradise he appears there to bring to them to take those who were in captivity in a holding place and take them captive and lead him out as the trophies of his blood and the victory that's in Jesus are you with me now because the reason why I'm going through all of this because the same thing is gonna happen here at this in time hallelujah the dead in Christ are waiting for Jesus to come amen they're under expectation for him to come to them are you with me Amen so so again just like they were expecting the Redeemer to come in the Old Testament the New Testament Saints are now waiting under the altar waiting for Jesus to come back you think you're longing for Jesus come back they are to man and they would submit their voice can be heard back up on the earth by prophet of God screaming out cheering him on and say you know you know press the battle you don't know what lays at the end of the road I mean you don't understand all the joys get your eyes on the goal don't look at the here and now in the troubles that are around get your eyes on the goal and that because Jesus is going to come back hallelujah now let's look at him as he a sins now because as he ascends into paradise and and again it is they were not in hell they were they you know the Bible says of the rich man he lifted up his eyes and hell and saw Abraham the bosom of Abraham so it was an around higher than hell hey man and so but yet now Jesus in his ascension after going to the desert preaching to the spirits that were lost in prison comes up and he comes now into another round and it's around my paradise and this is what happens when he ascends as he comes up this is all a part of his ascension as here Isis he's gonna raise somebody with him so in Matthew 27 verse 50 Jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from top to bottom in the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many of the bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many so we see when they raised they came right into this dimension of time of light matter in time and they appeared unto many oh now we get a picture of what is going to happen in our resurrection our man when the living remembered the living shall remain the dead in Christ shall be gathered together amen and we will see them but this time friends were not going to remain in the same condition this time when we see them we're gonna be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye they couldn't be changed back there because maybe because it was not time it was so it was going to be a Gentile dispensation and more time but we're at the end and we're right here on the very edge of the daddy in Christ rising are you with me I'm not now so Jesus went into the heavens now because he would have sinned and he would have sinned and be taken up the Bible we could describe it taking up in a cloud receive out of their sight and they would be told in the book of Acts this same Jesus will come again in like manner hallelujah in other words there's going to be a physical corporal return of Jesus Christ what we will see him and on another but eyes will see him for ourselves and we'll be caught up to meet the Lord in the air now Jesus went to the heavens to take a position there to intercede and I want you to get this point he is there to intercede until every name on his book is manifested on the earth so he's got a whole list of names he knows you're coming and he's been waiting on you to get here hey man all the saints are you with me all the Saints are waiting waiting for that last ones to finish the race and we're right here this is why brother Branham could hear them scream and press the battle I'm impressed the battle you don't know what lays at the end of the road you know you don't know the joys it lays ahead and that says what Jesus did he ran the race for the joy that was set before him and we got to keep our eyes on the joy the joy of a new body the joy of the dead since risin I'm at the joy hallelujah I've never another sinful thought never evil deed never another problem come on somebody the joy the joy of being United with our Redeemer forever that's how we gotta run this rate so look into the joy this is why Paul would say that blessed hope of his appearing well I say never you know we must never take that hope away from the church we must never over spiritualize it until we we count that as fulfillment we must look at this and realize there is coming more than just a spiritualization of this event and a man it's gonna materialize you know in obtains of our corporate bodies and a meeting of Jesus Christ what a promise audience now ever since his death at Calvary where he paid sins price and then a sinning of the heaven Jesus has resided on the throne of God and it's not a separate throne it is the throne of God it's not two Thrones sitting up there but it is it is it is Jesus there residing on the throne of God making a way for us to the throne now this is very important that we begin to understand because this has made the throne of Almighty God a throne of mercy it's made it a throne of grace a seat of mercy and I just want to add it's not for ignorance alone hey man but it's for the sins and unbelief of all times he has been on the mercy seat so we could find favor or grace in our time of need I'll refer to this again but Hebrews 4:16 said let us come boldly unto the throne of grace I want you to understand two things is a throne but it's a throne of grace is a throne of mercy that we may obtain mercy so you see it's a throne of mercy or otherwise we wouldn't be able to obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need now because of the sacrifice of Christ our lamb we can come boldly but now notice I want you to get a picture here that for right now until Satan is cast down how do we know he's not been cast down because he becomes incarnate in the Beast and at the same time the pride leaves from here because we're not going to be here when Satan is full king of the earth right hey man so again again window when Satan is cast down the bride goes up I want you to see a picture here because Satan has a right to stand in the heavens and there accuse us before God that's what Satan can do right now let me repeat again Satan stands in the heavens nap how are you with me before the throne of God to accuse you before God but I want you to understand something else you have one setting on the throne that is your mercy [Music] hallelujah Amen that when you approach this strong that you approach it through the sacrifice through this mediator through this redeemer to find grace hallelujah that's not just for you that's for every person it's for the sins of the whole world it's for the lowest sinner here among us or the last one that has lost their way that anybody can come and approach that throne of grace but you can't approach it without Jesus you cannot approach it without accepting the atonement of the sacrifice now we're going to get a picture because the Bible tells you some very clear things that will happen here in the end time it says the Sun will be darkened the moon will not give its light there's coming a time upon this earth as she moves into the tribulation when the bride leaves there will be no bride here to give light the light of the word will no longer be shone upon the Gentile world and the Sun will be darkened and stars will fall from the heavens there's to be a movement in the heaven and great earthquakes upon the earth some of these are physical some of these are even have spiritual application but there will be stars to fall now you know you know if you're just a teeny bit scientific at all and and knowledge of science you know if the Sun turned dark for any length of time this world would freeze over right we also know that it stars fell to the earth all the stars found the earth there wouldn't be enough room to can contain all the stars in the heavens so he's not speaking about something physical he is talking about something that is happening in the happens where stars will fall and these stars are not going to be planets and solar systems and this and that they're going to be the fall of angels now I'm going to just show you in the Bible revelation 12 and 7 I want you to get this picture because this right here describes our rapture brother branham tells us in the first seal in the fourth seal and and through our and other places and the seals at Revelation 12 is right here when the when Satan is cast down the bride goes up so we're going to look at this picture right here because the Bible tells you that at the coming of the Lord in this event and this this event of his coming from the rapture to his second coming where he of where he comes with the Saints and actually we call that the third coming and can refer to it as the third coming because because but in all reality the what we call the second coming the rapture he never comes to the earth we meet him in the air so it's kind of second coming where he's coming back to the earth is a different event than the rapture there's different things that will happen but in this event up between there between the rapture and his second coming or this where he comes back to take the world over again for the Millennium there's going to be some great changes that happens on the earth there's going to be where the wrath of God is poured out upon the earth there's going to be where Satan himself is cast down again and I want to get to this picture to you again because he was already once cast out he was cast out there there when he exalted himself and we'll read about it in Isaiah 12 that he where he exalted himself above all that is called God he wanted to be God so he comes to earth and he becomes her he is kicked out of the heavens after descending this even a third of the angels the Bible said a third of the of heaven fell so their way then we get it again stars fell angel swell and the transgression because sin began in heaven didn't begin on the earth it beginning to heaven and they begin with these words I will words Satan an angel who had the ability to make choices somebody help me to preach now shows one day to exalt his will over God's will and from there began the original sin and now it comes down the earth and moves upon Eve there to exalt her will over God's will now we're going to place these pieces here in a moment but let's just go to Revelation chapter 12 verse 7 because I want you to see him he's the accuser of the Brethren and that's what he's doing now future home brother branham said Satan right now can accuse us before God so he's still the accuser of the Brethren and as long as areas an accuser we must have an intercessor now just to jump ahead just a minute and I'll read you where the Prophet said but brother Branham said I do enough in one hour to be to be sowed into hell forever that was him what about you when we talk about the holiness of God no one dare approach him without the blood of Christ and I don't care how great these people think that they are now so what we're the bride we're this and that without the blood you have no approach to God amen now in Revelation chapter 12 verse 7 and there was war in heaven so now we see our thermals in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels now we see a great war in this against Michael and the Michael Michael is in a battle and Michael is is represents the Archangel who is like Jehovah is what his name means is a Mike L which is AE L is representative Elohim he who is like Elohim so it's an angelic form of Jesus all right is that the authentic form of Jesus and there he fights against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels are you with me now and I'm at now you say not brother Jim are you sure about this about Michael let me tell you Jesus is our only answer and this one is interceding or fighting on our behalf and Jesus is that intercessor he's depicted now as Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels this is an endtime battle God's fighting on your behalf to bring you to glory so there should be a rapture in this day man now there's a big fight there's a turmoil going on and I idols would like to say it's going on right now and the dragon over Nona what's and verse eight and I like this and prevailed not are we like reading that because we can read the results before it ever even happens the prophecy says he will prevail man let me just say again the devil will prevail whatever you're fighting against and warned against today he will not prevail you're gonna prevail over it notice prevailed not neither was their place how in the world did they have a place neither was their place found any more in heaven how in the world do they have a place in heaven look now verse 9 and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil now we know who the dragon was he's the same old serpent that beguiled Eve right and he's called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him now brother Branham explains this he said when he's cast out he becomes incarnate in in the the the beach system in the Antichrist and will become incarnate in a man are you with me so far we're not there but it lays real close a map now and notice here and he says and I've heard I love this and I heard a loud voice in heaven now we're getting the scene change here Satan man Castle earth but now we're going to see somebody in heaven but loud voice in heaven saying now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ now we see here in his final victory is finally attained you said well it was done at Calvary yes it was initiated at Calvary but remember he's got to reign until every enemy is under his feet are you with me my man so he is there to reign his intercessor until his enemies are under his feet Norris and he says now is come salvation strength the kingdom of our God the power of his Christ what's now for the accuser for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night now again they had a place in heaven how did they get there because we can go to Isaiah chapter 14 and verse 12 and we can see where Satan has been cast down out of heaven how art thou fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which to this week in the nation for that was said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will all sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north notice these these words remember beautiful for situation is Mount Zion in the size of the North the city of our Great God so Satan says I want to church I want God's church and we can see him as he as an antichrist begin to move all the way from the beginning moving us away from the original enthronement of God and the end the sealing of the spirit and the pouring out of the Holy Ghost although it didn't here he comes inside out of Christ moving in and he winds up according to Thessalonians sitting in the temple of God showing himself that he is gone and is worshiped and then Revelation says he's worshipped by millions all the world will worship Him are you with me hey man so he says he says I will ascend in the Allsop on the Mount of congregation and the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the cloud I will be like the Most High yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit so God that prophesizes that you desire to ascend but this is what's going to happen to you you're gonna fall you'll be brought down to the pit hey man this whole world is getting wicked her and wicked her and more and more ripe with sin and it's making a very place for the devil to come but it's gonna be his trap not his victory are you with me you see this has always been Satan's desire to be God it's a very temptation he used an Eden to get Eve to disobey God you shall be as gods Lucifer was cast out of heaven because of his sin and his pride a pride and his desire to be God remember Isaiah is it Isaiah 28 when that shows him as a hovering the covering cherub and how that that you know that he was he was beautiful and and was once a a covered cherub he was once I'll protect your the word he was writer what's up right hand man that God as it were he gets kicked out of heaven because he exalts itself he takes his own selfish ambitions and places it over the Word of God but now he's cast down the earth and here he comes and he's looking for a way to get back now he finds a serpent which is next a man which has no soul that he can enter into so now he has a body he can work through but now he comes here to Eve and he begins to reason the word EA has God said and presses on to her the desire or the thought you can be as God now and when he does now this one who's been kicked out of Heaven's comes to the earth here he comes now the one who is deceived angels deceive Z now Adam looks at it he looks at here and here here this is bone of his bone in life of his life are you with me this is his flesh this is a part of him a man without her are you with me let man let me just say something caught God can't just destroy her and Adam just go on in order to bring forward are you with me in order to be fruitful and multiply he's got to have Eve so he can't just so ever destroyed and start all over again but she's fallen so what he does is he goes and takes on her sin are you with me and there dies with her in order for redemption well as far fetched brother Jim well that's what Jesus did he can't be complete without you he can't be complete without me he's gotta have a bride are you with me he can't leave you in Siena so he came down to the top your sin and take the penalty of your sin on himself in order to bring you back to God again you can't make this stuff up it was just a beautiful story of redemption Oh God he'll never forget you I don't care how lost and backslidden and away from him you've been he'll never forget you he's gonna find his own no matter where they are he's gonna find his own ha tonight what I hope that ought to give us this morning what a joy that ought to give us so now Adam now let's just look at him for a minute he's a dual nature he lives here in a corporal body although we could call it corporal fleshly body made out the dust it's not it's still at this time there's no important it's still immortal he's walking now as close as long as he's in fellowship with God his body will never die right it'll never die as long as he keeps God's Word he'll never die never sickness everything's brought under control hey man he's there like a millennium and the lion lays down by the lamb and eat straw like the Bullock nothing hurts are destroying all my holy mountain he dresses the garden with the power from another round now I want you to get a picture here because he's on the earth but his throne Adam's throne reaches from heaven to earth because he's ruling the earth from heaven from Heaven's atmosphere from Heaven's power from Heaven's throne from Heaven's dominion and as long as he's there and with that seat in the heavens everything about it is subject to him but Satan now he's been kicked out of the heavens but now he wants this throne I'll get back I'll get back in the heavens now and to do that he's got to get Adam to become subservient to him and if he will subjugate himself to Satan and Satan become his ruler then Satan has a position and becomes the Prince of the power of atmospheres of the air hi ma'am remember this that's all going to be restored here in this last day because we meet Jesus in the air right now Satan is the prince and the power there but we're going to meet Jesus hallelujah in the air I meant back in opposition again a man and there begin listen listen listen the fall of the earth did not begin with animals it did not begin with the vines it did not begin with that it began with the king of the earth are you with me which was man now we restore man back to his original position then him in that position will restore animals and will adjust or write them down to every vine every Brier everything will be restored but you got to redeem man back to his position and this is what's been the problem we have been out of position hey man we have been out of position but there's a battle going on for our position I see men and women right now that are playing to Satan you can't stay there my man because Adam might have sold it but Jesus redeemed it and we're taking back our position as sons and daughters of God and right now we can save you safe and take your cancer off of God's people take your sickness and leave are you with me now so now through the fall of man he takes he takes a subjugated place it's not his position he is only there by permission whosever missing man's permission because Adam sold out tomb sold us all out now he stands there in the heavens asserting authority and accusing us and the reason he accuses us is to keep us from taking our position in other words saying you don't have a right to be a son you don't have a right to stand here you don't have a right for this position it was sold to me by Adam and because you were born and seen safe in iniquity because you came by the way of sexual birth you were all born my slaves and you have no right to this position of sonship hey man now we'll get to it in a minute but I would just want you to see this now then in Joel chapter 1 in verse 6 I want you to see this that there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord now so here sons of God are coming into God's presence and Satan came also among them now what in the world does he have a right there we have the right because of the fall hey man now and he's and the Lord said to Satan which cometh thou and the Satan man said the Lord and said I've been going forth is the to and fro to the earth and walking up and down in it I've been looking I have been looking for things to accuse the sons of God so they'll have no right to approach this throne I need the Lord said unto Satan well have you considered my servant job did you notice him there's not like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man and one that fears God and excuse evil and Satan accuses says does job fear God for nothing hast thou not made a hedge around him and about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side and I was blessed the work of his hands his substances increased in the land so here here he begins to accuse job and say well the only reason he's serving you is for what he's getting out of you and then in chapter 2 where we could we could read again or is it chapter three no chapter two he will see Satan appears again and ask his permission he said but to attack his flesh and let me let me just tell you something by default Satan has a right to attack your body because of Adam's sin you say what God why did you let this happen to me well I'll tell you why because of Adam chose we would be born mortals and because of that we all die and because that we have sickness and pain and sorrow and death in trouble bad things happen to good people are you with me now but anyway he he said let me just touch his flesh he said because for man's flesh he'll curse you he's only serving you because of the heads you God and protection you will give because God does protect us many times he's kept you listen you think he's kept you from that accident he kept you from things you didn't even know about I'm Anna I'll just say this this isn't this wasn't the first time God healed sister Lana from cancer see I cancer many times and so of you it works at your body it's there to attack your cells a man but God said but God would draw a line and said no that's it and your body would raise up and throw it off and ma'am your body would raise up and throw it off where did where did that come from God put that in there hey mom that's why it's an important part of our our own duties to to try to take care of our bodies not sin against our bodies by doing things that will harm them are you with me but notice again you know there is another accusation if you go to Zechariah 3 and verse 1 we will see that gods that he showed me is Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him so here's Joshua now he's going to be the high priest and in the Israel at the restoration that is going on and and and we could go through the whole picture semen dirty garments and the change that has made everything that God did them to put him in position but but nevertheless even at the point that I want you to get right now is Satan was standing and his right hand to resist him well that's where Satan is he is also standing there resisting accusing but his time of accusation is about over because there's a war going on that's about to be won it was initiated at Calvary but it's going to be finished here in this last day hallelujah amen if you will I you know let me go back to to Revelation chapter 12 and verse 10 I want you to skip this again and I heard a loud voice in heaven now these these are the raptured Saints in heaven and they're saying now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brother is cast down which accused them before our God day and night give me the next verse verse 11 and they overcame him hallelujah by the blood but yet not one drop of blood was shed for angels come on somebody this is more than angelic Bibles this is your battle and they overcame him that's the only way you can overcome that was his heart here's your part and the word of their testimony that's your part man he paid the price and you can pass it's done she forgave your sins and you can test it's done he gave you a pardon and you say I received that pardon he says I paid for your healing and you say I believe it so I receive it with all of my heart for they overcame him by blood and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death a man they an and so how wonderful this is now this is a voice in heaven this is the voice of the raptured Saints screaming back here's how we whipped him here's how we got victory hey man you ought to know that this morning here's how you get victory mmm because there is a sacrifice somebody help me preach because there is an atonement oh we got a new atonement today no brother Brendan said it was a restoration back to the original atonement I meant the blood of the Lamb and by the word of our confession brother Bentham said he cannot heal you until he you first confessed that he's done it now so again we we see this is where he comes he asserts authority listen brother branham in the fourth seal says this is paragraph 183 in the fourth seal notice now he'll be given the heart of the beast at that time and Satan will incarnated himself because when the church goes up Satan is cast out so as long as we're here on this earth still in the mortal realm a man Satan had been cast out but when when the church goes up Satan is cast out it's all done men and all of his accusing is done hallelujah hey man now he said look as long as the innocent were still on the throne Satan can stand there and accuse because he is the attorney on the other side he's the opponent of Christ and Christ he's standing there the opponent is standing there sales but wait Adam fell Adam did this I conquered him I got his wife to believe a lot and you said she'd be damned bud I got it and here the mediators tendon they're the kinsman redeemer standing there with the blood that can make the violence sinners heart take the solace in his heart and change it a mediator on the throne can't you see is this more than purchase ignorance because we didn't know that the word in pass ages and we lost the truths it's more than that it's because we were the vilest sinner take the vial of sinners heart and changes a man Satan says but they're guilty and Jesus says they're not he said that Clorox and he's really represented as a blood was invented or manufactured to take stain take the color and a beak and any other stain that God and they break it up to you can never find it again it goes back to gases all the way back to cosmic light and pass molecules and everything it turns back to the original word come from is a creation of creation had to come from a creator but all the chemicals that was manufactured and put together that broke up and just ever and that's just all there is to it there's no more of it and the very water substantive blends with the Clorox which is Isis amen glory to God it's all clean that win the blood of Jesus that's what the blood of Jesus does to a true child of God when he confesses that sin he stands there justified in his he serves mercy goodness hallelujah even it's so great till God says I can't remember it anymore and it's absolutely my son very I've seen you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't down in your heart but believe what you said it shall come to pass you will have what you said you're redeemed son he's lying no it's true hallelujah because that spoken word resurrected fishes come on that spoken words created squirrels out of nothing that spoken word brought salvation to the Lost come on somebody that spoken word removed a tumor out of it his wife miles and miles hundreds of miles away that that spoken word spoke to a storm manda and it costed to go back are you with me a mansion because why he was standing there as a redeemed son but we're here operating in the perimeters of the mortals some people who get he'll get sick again believers still die trouble still comes because we're still in the realm of the mortals and no matter how much we've had great things happen in the heavens we're still here in the mortal drama but we're about to leave it there's war in heaven and there's a contention there I want you to see it every time I believe or prays or takes the stand on the Word of God it causes war you say sometimes brother damn I got prayed for it and it's worse because he calls to war so what I prayed for my kids and looks like they're worse because he calls to war hey man it's his cosy disturbance in the heavens are you with me well I got prayed for and I was seeking appeal were you cause the wall I man you took and stood for your position as a son of God and you got opposed it's not a time to give up it's not a time to quit I can read you the Bible he prevailed not hallelujah let me say it again he prevailed not he'll not prevail over your children he'll not prevail over that sickness he'll not prevail he'll not prevail [Applause] we call the angels of glory to come down on your behalf I don't know brother Tim if all this is true well Ephesians 6:11 he tells you you're in a battle put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but here's what we're fighting against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness where high places in the heavenlies there is a battle that you're we are fighting in the heavenlies now this word this this word high places is exactly what it says in ephesians chapter 1 that he had made us to sit together in heavenly places with christ so he's made you to have dominion because of him or with him man but every time you step up to take a part of that promise of the word Satan is there to oppose you are you with me and he's going to do it he'll bring ever doubt do you bring ever fear he'll bring depression he'll bring unbelief he'll bring a host of Hell Kali saves us and he knows he's better G he knows when your weaknesses are and he's trying to get you to back down but when you've done everything to stamp therefore don't be a quitter with your loins Girt about your sword drawn where do you want your sword in your mouth that's where Jesus holds the sword is in the mouth in the out of his mouth goes a two-edged sword and out of your mouth it's got to come the Word of God the Lord rebuke you Satan I mean you you who has opposed this bride the Lord rebuke you Satan take your hands of the Gods property bias flatline he'll offspring with us it's the only thing that a defeat the devil that's what Jesus used the sort of the word oh you say what brother Tim I just want it you know I want this battle over well I do too but not till he's whipped I'm man so Jesus comes and he comes in one side and one in one way and tempts him in one way and the band and youth in you what's that but he finishes where he gets that battle done and he comes another way and then he comes another way but hallelujah after a while the devil leaveth him hallelujah just stand there you're gonna see his taillights Oh hallelujah I can see his taillights running out of this church this morning heading out the door hallelujah because the moment somebody believed and the Bible says and the angels came and strengthened them in the time for the angels just to come down among us it strengthened us after the battle hallelujah but they can prevail you can prevail just on the words of Jesus Jesus sent him out the seventy out in Luke 10 and verse 8 whatever city you entered and they receive you eight such things that are set before you and heal the sick that are darienne that means cast Satan out that's what healing the sick yes casting Satan out a man brother Brandon would preach the sermon casting out Devils is casting out unbelief and he said heal the sick that are terror Darian and say to them the kingdom of God is come near to you and verse 17 after they went out the seventy returned again with joy saying Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name hallelujah somebody ought to start shouting right there man the Devils are subject to us through thy name a man and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning flowers from heaven what you are out doing this I was watching what was happening in the heavens and you were making Satan's law because you were taking the position that I told you to take hallelujah amen tile you would take it the position I told you to take and that was class a turnout and you were acting that authority and you come back and you say it happened Lord and he said I saw it I saw what happened I was watching all the time and when you sort of believe it and you started using my name I saw Satan fall he didn't float down like a pretty little butterfly he fell like a stone from heaven hallelujah I want you to know you as a child of God can cast sitting down can see before your promise come on somebody cast him off your property you don't tell that devil where he belongs you don't belong in your position you're a son of God your daughter God you got her act on that if you don't act on his signal squat on it and he'll Bluff you although all your life now then he goes on and he says in verse 19 behold I give you power how many's one of his disciples this morning a man this is his commission to you I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over some of the power well that's not what it said not just some all of the power of the enemy you know I want to point out something here you know when brother Branham was there before the angel and Andy you know he says he told me in one place he says he told me you know that nothing would stand before your prayers not even cancer but when he tells us originally with this you know and explaining it he said I said to him not even cancer because he said nothing to stand before your person he said not even cancer you see what in the angel making cancer some big thing it's only something that Devils only big in your eyes it's not big in the eyes of Jesus isn't him harder to heal than a toothache I meant no harder heal than a headache it's no harder to heal than than anything cancer is nothing in the presence of God are you with me and he said to humour me he said he I said to him not even cancer he said no not even cancer but to the angel he didn't make a difference and here he didn't say I give you power over some he said overall hallelujah he heals all diseases there is nothing too hard for the Lord there's nothing too great for God I give you power over the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you you're not going to come out damaged goods you're gonna come out victorious but not withstanding in this rejoice not the spirits are subject to you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven hallelujah hey man that's what we ought to be rejoicing in we've seen our name in the book we know who we are as sons of God rejoice that your sons and daughters of God now but I want to announce to you we've been talking about Satan and what happened there in the garden what happened in the heavens did the fall in the garden in his then him being able then to take Adams position as Prince of power the heir Jesus would call him the Prince of this world listen he is ruler of it because Adam subjected himself not by divine right and so it's questioned he's only a squatter and he's only there saying but I deceived them and they sold but jesus said but I paid for it I'm the Kinsmen now which one are you going to believe come on somebody which one are you going to believe are you gonna receive what the accuser says you're gonna receive what the Redeemer says paid in full by the blood of the lamb my sins are gone I stand as an abducted son I stand positioned as a child of God I Know Who I am but I want to get something to you we are not there at the very beginning there were the fall took place we are now past the Jewish dispensation and at the end of the Gentile dispensation so we are we are here we've seen the Old Testament fulfilled now we're in the fulfilling of the New Testament and we're standing exactly where the Jews was when Jesus came the first time and you as Gentiles are standing exactly where we're we're real where we are here to receive the Messiah and we've been brought back to a homeland for that purpose so we're on the other end of the situation we're on the cusp of full Redemption by the return of Jesus Christ and to do this Heaven's powers will be shaken and Satan will fall from his position of being able to stand before God as the accuser and will be cast down and when he's cast down we go up hallelujah I just wondered could this be the final day of battle we're that course we're that close man as we've been preaching the last night in Egypt I'm out here we are we're here at the last battle Luke chapter 21 verse 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the earth distress of nations and with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's heart failing them for fear for the looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then once the powers of heaven is shaken Satan has cast down the bride goes up but then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory now now here's why that we can prevail we can prevail right now because of our intercessor and he's with me now when Jesus ascended he went into the third heavens everybody say it third heavens now if you get it if we would look at it in the in the natural you know all your types Father Son and Holy Ghost God meant three different manifestations same God we see man bodies spirit and soul it's a one man and and and he himself is a tabernacle the outer court to enter court in the most holy the Old Testament the same way that the tabernacle outer court inner court must holy and so when you get to heaven there is a place in the heavens called the sanctuary this is called the third heaven I'm going to get to this for a moment as we look at it because I want you to understand he's when in the pred the presence of God is this spoke up in the book of Revelation as the temple of God where the throne is the presence of God no we we was dealing with the other day of the vials that when the the angel was given permission to pour out his vials of judgment on the earth for the tribulation of the tribulation judgments began of the wrath of the Lamb the sanctuary becomes smoky and that is because Jesus has left the sanctuary and when he does as we know he's going to come first to the Saints who are looking for him those who are waiting there beyond the curtain of time who have entered in through the veil of death into that round but let's just look right now in high Hebrews 9 24 where that word that he says that Christ is not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the truth and these were just tights just speaking of what or what are the true would be but he's entered into heaven itself to appear in the presence of God for us now I want you to understand this is so that when Satan comes to accuse we have an advocate there and he will accuse until every name that is on the book has been manifested on earth and dipped in blood all right now so when Satan comes to accuse we have an advocate there we have a go-between now this is a Apostolic doctrine because now he's in the presence of God he'd appear and they're in the presence of God what's the word for us I want you to get the picture he's there for me he's there for you there's a reason he's there did you need him and here's what you need first John two and one my little children these things I write unto you that you send not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous hallelujah I'm at now this word advocate is the word comforter are you with me same word when Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you that's an advocate I will be your advocate advocate I am going away to be to make an approach of God for God to God because man has not been able to approach God and even the Old Testament Saints could not come in this presence they had to wait down in Paradise but I'm going there as a man to represent the whole human race so that when you have a need I know how you feel I'm a proper mediator I went through everything you went through so I can plead your case amen now so he says my little children I write into you that you sent not because we're not to be willful sinners but if any man sin we have an advocate with the father we have an approach to God we have somebody that will plead our case a man not some unknown distant spirit that never was a man but someone who was flesh and bones like we are who knows what it is to be sick brother tell me you know I'm not sure about him sitting down a rock and groaning with a headache that's what Ingram said and brother branham's just quoted that well let me tell you if you don't think he had a headache what about when he was that thrust her crown of thorns on his head and beat him over the head with a reed and then beat him and beat him and beat him up on his back you don't think he had a pain he groaned with a headache he groaned under the every listen he was marred by him the worse than any man are you with me everything you went through you said my pains and my feet he had painted as his feet pain in my head he's had pain in his head pain in my shoulder my back brother Tim I can't really sit here he's had that pain he knows how you feel he knows how it is to be weak he knows how he is to be hungry he knows how it is to be falsely accused he knows how it is like a woman at the well didn't want to give him a water because of his race he knows how and he needs me he had racial prejudice come on every kind of thing that can be thrown at him he was called an illegitimate he was made from all the religious leaders rejected him everything in every way you cannot name a problem that he don't understand oh he would look at him come and said Isaiah that seemed he was wounded for my transgressions not for his own my transgressions he was bruised because of my iniquities the weapons I should have got the chastisement of my peace he took my weapons and by His stripes I am delivered killed saved and he is the perpetuation that means the means of appeasement going back to Egypt for a moment every Israeli was to die but a lamb took his place somebody help me all the firstborn was to die but a lamb took their place everybody was guilty but a lamb took their place and the death that was should have come on the firstborn was put up on the lam I'm an the same thing he became the perpetuation the lamb would become the perpetuation or the appeasement the wrath was poured out upon that God said today you eat thereof that day you die he can't change his mind so the penalty has to be paid and so Jesus takes the penalty and he says and he is a perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but for the sins of the whole world what a mighty God what a gracious Savior amen now so you see here's a teaser of our sins but now we're here's Jesus now I know a background now for over an hour and we talked about were Satan this and how he got there and the battle that's going on and he's going to be cast down and then we're going up because we're going to take our position of sonship this world will come back under the Dominion of man with Jesus being the king of it and thus ruling and reigning with him I can read it to you in the Bible we shall we shall rule and reign or we shall be kings and priests and rule and reign with him upon the earth but where is Jesus now I can hear it in the hearts brother the heart of brother Branham I hear to the heart of saints oh I want to see him it's the cry of the sunrider's there's a cry of ever true believer certainly I'm in love with his word are you in love with his word how many's grateful that the the seals have been revealed all of them all seven seals how many's grateful that the word has been made known in this day and we have restored back to Apostles doctrine how many's happy for that hey man I'm in love with his word and I love you I love his love letter it's kind of like getting the letter from somebody far away I might and you get a message from somewhere a loved one far away it's not them oh but you love it you'd love to get that letter you know it's like the soldier boys hearing from home they can get the hug mom or dad but tears from them they got a letter from them and they would read between the lines of it and they would Bastion they would think envision what mom and dad's doing back home and you know all of this is they conveyed their love but it wasn't them I just want to say I love the Bible it's a love letter and yet its expression of Jesus but it's not Jesus a bask in his message his expression of him it's not him you say all of the words him by the damn word don't let me tell you it's an expression of a person and this is expression of a person and yeah it's the same as him in the sense that what he said did this is what he said and it's true but it's not him I want to see Jesus I want to see the one who died for me I want to see the one who is nail-scarred for me and I want to see him not not just get a letter from him or receive a message from him I'm grateful for the message he'll give me a misunderstood but he's not the same as him I'm basking it I want to see Jesus this is brother Branham if you don't believe it brother Branham had received many many things and when he went beyond the curtain of time was when he actually went there was after he drew his last breath here he stepped over in that dimension and his heart's cry was I want to see Jesus no matter how much of the word that we've seen how much of the message we've seen I want to see Jesus how who we saw him you know you know yeah it was like the wind that blew and there as it blew the winds and the leaves on the trees moved as the winds of the Holy Spirit moved blind eyes was open we saw Jesus it had to be Jesus it had to be him passing by for blind eyes open and the Deaf to hear the seals took him open it was him a member but we want to see sees us and we're generation of people we're gonna get to see him where is he now fundamental doctrine of the New Testament is it Jesus ascended leaving the earth to go into the seventh dimension Paul called it the third heaven heaven sanctuary we would you you would be referred to in the type of the of the Old Testament Tabernacle the holiest of Holies the highest of the heavens and Jesus has entered into heaven sanctuary for us to the very throne of God and he remains there until this day how old my brother Tim he came down in Revelation 10 he also did and in other other places in the Bible that's where he spiritually came he came into the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost a man that this again was a it was not a physical comment and we're talking about the physical return of the Lord Jesus Christ we're not talking about a spiritual and anointing or power and enlightenment or revelation we're talking about him he entered into sanctuary heaven sanctuary he remains there to this day this is Paul's teaching this is Peters teaching this is a this is a pasta liqu doctrine this was William branham's teaching before the seals and after the seals that Jesus is there in the century as the atonement as a mediator between us and God until our last human battle is over somebody with me so will brother Jim we we've been declared righteous and we're justified and we never did it in the first place yes that's what's been declared but I'm still here fighting another battle and until the last human battle is fought and when I need him there to make inappropes for me cuz I cannot approach that throne without him and as long as I'm in this mortal body no man can go into his presence he has to be changed first and until our change comes he remains there in heaven sanctuary mark 16 verse 19 and then the Lord had a spoken to them and he was received up to heaven into heaven and on the right hand of God I don't know if I can finish all this today but I want you to just to get this he didn't just go to the lower heavens he went to the highest part of heaven and he saddled the right hand of God now we'll get to that here in a moment but let's just go to Hebrews 7:26 and let's read it for such a high priest became us he's saying he became the high priest in other words he became our intercessor he became the one that brought the blood to atone and it wasn't animal blood it was his own blood such a high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens a man so you see he's so high in the heavens from that position he looks down on all of heaven right down to earth hey man brother Branham would tell us and be not afraid in 1963 he says he was talking about how that Jesus wouldn't climb to high heel what's his disciples leave and he says but he hadn't really left him you know the Bible said he climb on the highest heels there was in the country so he could watch him and that's when he did when he left us at Calvary when they crucified him he never left us he didn't climb the eyes heal but he climbed Calvary he kept on climbing past the moon to Stars plumb him to the heavens of heavens higher UK higher you go further you can see he got so high till he has to look down on heaven the Bible said yeah he's way up in the heavens of heavens I'll send it on high no this is what brother Branham said he kept climbing and he's there this is what he did for us when he left Calvary when he ascended he climbed in the highest of heavens so he could see it every bet there's an eye watching you he sees every situation he understands what the enemy's been doing from his position he can see the works of the enemy and knows exactly how to commander his troops on earth to go defeat him are you with me I mean someone or two said he will regard to prayer of the destitute this is verse 17 sums 102 17 he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise a prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord for he had looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven did the Lord behold the earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner to lose those that were appointed to death and to declare the name of the Lord in science and his praise in Jerusalem hallelujah that's why he's there are you with me to hear the groaning to hear your travail are you with me and to loose those that were appointed to death [Music] I said hallelujah this is why he's there he's watching for you his eyes are on you this morning and those that were appointed for death he has loosed hallelujah he hears the groaning of the prisoner he hears what the devil has done to his children you've been in bondage of sin and bondage of wickedness and bondage of drugs and alcohol and women and men or whatever it is have you been under bondage and upon into death but he sees and he sees it to loose you Oh hallelujah I want to get it to you he's also watching for your children your loved ones for the loss that is out there he sees so he can't so cry he hears your cry we use a prayer to pray because every time you call and is there to loose - loose the priest Oh hallelujah all the angel may appear to your loved one right today and shake them and bring them and right into his presence but they could come to themselves and recognize the father that they have left because he's watching and nothing misses his eyes hallelujah hallelujah nothing misses his eyes he's got eyes before and behind a man he sees every move up on the earth he knows what the devil is doing he knows about that sickness in your body he knows he knows about your brother branham would say as we finish that quote his eye is on the sparrow and I know he's watching us tonight that's right he's looking down upon this meeting he sees our trouble he knows our frustrations and frustrations he knows how sick you are he knows what you've been through he knows what you're trying to do his eye is watching you he's that fair they're not watching not to condemn you but to loose you not to destroy you but to free you let bring you out of bondage to bring healing to break deliverance now Paul spoke about the third heaven first Corinthians 12 and 1 it's not expedient for me doubtless to glory I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body or I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such a one was caught up into the third heavens now heaven is not marked off in different levels that we attain to by works there is brother Branham said when he went into that realm of paradise where the Saints are waiting the New Testament Saints Old Testaments already risen so well just some of them well some of them because some of them they thought were Saints and weren't Saints but you know the blood did not leave a one there in Paradise the empty paradise paradise is empty so all of them raised are you with me now let's get this let's get this clear but there is a place called paradise and it's under the altar of God and the altar God is the third realm of heaven it is the throne of God it is the seat of mercy now just below that and in the in the levels of heaven is angels and below that brother brems said I went to the first heaven which is the realm of paradise and there's where the saints are waiting now friends this is no imagination they're really there now there are three heavens but there are seven dimensions now not seven dimensions of heaven - seven dimensions to explain a dimension a dimension literally means length breadth and height so the dimensions of this Polpette is you know so many feet high and so many feet wide and so many feet deep that's the dimensions the dimensions of where we live is like matter in time we live in those that's you know we can't go no further than time in this dimension and we can't leave matter right and and so you know we are controlled by the light of the Sun here upon this earth all energy and life comes from the Sun that's the Lincoln Heights and the breadth of where we live now is three dimensions science has brought us into an invisible dimension and that invisible unseen dimension is very real now a hundred years ago they really didn't know much about it in fact they didn't know it even hardly existed let's just see we've made a little more time so let's go back 150 years ago they didn't know anything about this dimension but it was real it was there all the time television was there back when when Jesus was here that's right they just didn't have the way to produce it electricity was here back then that it just didn't know how to tap into it it's an unseen force that we operate by we're sitting here in this building and and even if you're listening in through the internet you're hearing my voice come through the microphone go into a system go out in through the lines go out into into the the big banks and and fed out where however it works I don't have to know how it works I just know it works television television is there you know people that were here fifty years ago can all of a sudden be in this room right now by television moving talking whatever else and they're dead been dead 50 years because television can produce that where it appears right in front of you right you tell of your telephone you know you can stand right here we can call Africa or Asia or anywhere else and and you know it just goes into an invisible farm moves out goes out your whole picture your everything you movements everything because we the fourth dimension has been brought very real to us now that's what science has had had been been able to do but now the fifth dimension is the dimension of the lost the dimension of lost souls and demons so it's where that they dwell it's a real dimension and let me just tell you it's a round that you will go to if you die without accepting the pardon that's made available by the blood of Christ a mouth that's where you go if you go without receiving that pardon and forgiveness of sin you go into the fifth dimension there were the the realm of the Lost and it's a horrible condition dimension brother branham said is a condition it's um he said it's like going to sleep you can't be asleep you're in a nightmare you're hideous things your your dream your screaming you said that's the state of the wicked dead you can't go in the presence of God in other words you can't wake up and go into God's presence because you're sinner and you can't come back to the earth because your time is up on the earth and so you're caught in between there in between the earth but between this dimension of life matter and time and between the realms of heaven you can't go into heaven and you're there a wandering spirit you're an atonement and like a tormented nightmare but it's real is not a nightmare problem is you'll never wake up out of the nightmare the nightmare get worse because what you knew is you'll wind up in the great white throne judgment and brother Branham would say he would describe the white throne like this he said let my belly be opened and cut open and he said let sulfur be burn in it and all kinds of horrible things dude done to me but don't let me stand at that white throne judgment that's of it dimension it's not heaven it's just a dimension beyond light matter in time now there's another dimension and it's called the six dimension the six dimension is under the altar where Jesus is and that's where the saints abide and in contrast is not a dream it's real but in contrast to a lie a nightmare is like a wonderful dream that you'll never wake up from are you with me and then you'll never you'll never wake up you'll never go back to the old life again you'll never are you with me you'll never be mortal again you'll always be immortal timeless eternal not controlled by matter or even sunlight but controlled by and energized by the very light of God are you with me so it's like a wonderful dream that you never want to wake up from but it's not a dream it's real now the seventh dimension that's a sixth dimension where the Saints are and the seventh dimension is the altar where God dwells now we can see from these souls under the altar I just like to go there for a moment and I'll try to conclude with this part of the thought souls of the altar let's go to the fifth seal we're just going to see these are in the martyrs block is what brother Branham called it they're in a special designated place they were Jewish people who will be given white robes and he said they did it because the testimony which they held will read this in a moment in revelation 6 and 9 actually we'll just go there now but these are souls in the altar and brother Branham said that my group the believers for this age were not in the martyrs book they were they were here gathered still in the sixth dimension souls under the altar so he said there are there groups like that are gathered like the these Jews that that had that were were given grace and he said they were under the martyrs block haven't been slain for the word of God and the testimony which they held but he said my group was not with them they were here I still under the altar waiting for Jesus to come are you with me now so revelation six and nine when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held so these were not since these were Jewish people who were given white robes and they they were slain because of their stand for the word of God the Old Testament law and for the testimony that the hell this is why they were killed they were killed because they were Jews are you with me and they were despised because they were Jews they were God's people God's chosen people and God hadn't forgot them a man if God wouldn't forget Jews are you with me God wouldn't forget Jews who did not receive the atoning blood of Christ and he would not forget them but remembered them because of their testimony in the Word of God then prints we got really dis God don't forget nothing he's not gonna forget about you your loved ones your children your knees what's now and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given to them every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren should be killed as they were and should be fulfilled so there's going to be a few more added and that's gonna be killed she tells us of these souls in the altar they're slain for the word of God now we're just going to make some points here as we go along that these were not disembodied spirits but there were people that were yet alive even though they had been martyred they are not different people but people relocated understand whatever you are here that's what you're going to be there you know go me I did not gonna be you're gonna be the same person just relocated somebody with me that's what brother Benton said if your center here you been sitting there so don't worry you won't be there if you're lying here you'll be lying there dead so don't worry you'll be over here in this other round whatever you was that's what you'll be unless there's a atoning blood that wipes out every memory of sin now watch this real close so they were relocated those dead in Christ they're still just alive as they were when they walked back can I say they're more alive not just as a lot they are more alive there than what they were here this is real life and he say you know they're there they're just been relocated and waiting for Jesus to come you see that run out of the the link Heights and breadth of this dimension they run out of time so they move our relocated out of this old time-worn body into a theophany party mmm because the Bible said if this house of our habitation be dissolved we have one of waiting already in the heavens hallelujah I've got a body that's better than this one and I'm gonna get to it one way or the other I go by the way of the grave I'll just be relocated if I go by there change I'm just going to be relocated but whatever I'm moving into that theophany so are you now they're not different people the boogie brew speaks of it as as righteous men made perfect so you know here we are we're still in imperfect bodies but when we step over there just one breath from here we're righteous men made perfect these persons were remembered in heaven because of their life on the earth God doesn't forget you're remembered for your deeds because of the testimony which they held their called out with a loud voice or they called out they spoke with a loud voice so they can express themselves as like people on the earth this tells us they were rational they were communicative they were emotional they were passionate they had ever ever spectrum of feeling as brother Branham when he when I went beyond the car when he went beyond the curtain of time he says you you mean I can feel them you mean they're real in other words they're not they're not just the spirit or a spook but it's a body that can be touched they were fully conscious they were aware of each other they were aware of God they're aware of the situation on the earth and they were even praying they were free to ask God questions they talked to God to intervene on the earth and forgot to act on their behalf it means they had an audience with God in the present heavens they knew enough about what was happening on the earth they realized there was those had killed them and had not been judged they had a clear memory of their life on the earth they knew they had been killed they had prayed for judgment of their persecutors who are still hurting others and asking for divine intervention they were an effect interceding for the suffering of others on the earth are you with me there were continent of God's attributes as they called him lord holy and truth they were treated as individuals as each one was given white robes they had physical forms because as a spirit they could not have been clothed with a white robe God answered them and promised fulfill their requests but that they would have to wait a little longer brother branham went beyond the curtain of time I said but we gotta wait a little longer he hasn't come yet but he'll come to you and when he comes you'll be judged for what you preach to us and if you are accepted which you will be we'll go back to earth together come on somebody the Saints anticipate the return of Jesus and they've made their immediate return to Earth for with excitement they said to brother Branham one day we're going back to earth and we'll take up our bodies again we don't eat here but we'll eat there and those bodies it's somebody with me a man you see the Saints I want you to get it the Saints are anticipating the coming of the Lord so if they are anticipated how much more should we be if they are saying he's still higher that means he had descended from the mercy seat yet but when he does he'll come to them first and then there'll be a resurrection and then we'll gather together hallelujah are you with me we'll gather together hey man I'm just gonna jump ahead of my time right now and just conclude it with this it was brother Branham would we would say well you would say he said you know when when he said God look at his wisdom his wisdom he he knows he knows when the dead in Christ rise and here we are all getting together we're gonna look around and say good brother son so make it worse brother son where is it where's my son where's my daughter's dissin where's that one and he said we'll have a great reunion and he said we're going to get to meet one another first hey man because he said he wants all eyes to be on him and not be wondering is dysentery that one there did this Omega but we'll have a great reunion verse turn on Jesus and we'll see him as he is what a day that will be what an hour we can look for and to realize were the last one in the race so it's our time to run give me Hebrews 12 verse 1 but the musicians cometh they well Hebrews 12 and verse 1 wherefore now you remember he's already just went through all the Old Testament Saints and them that's went on he talks about Abraham and Gideon and oh he just names all these heroes of faith that have went on and we've had heroes I said we've had heroes we've had men down to the ages heroes great men of faith heroes and Paul AB dimension and these heroes of the Old Testament he said wherefore seeing we are tall so compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us oh brother we can call out the witnesses and even brother Brandon without the witnesses coming hearing their voices press the battle you know the joy that leaves at the end of the road witnesses and they're there listen can I see it they're out of every scripture calling out of every verse in the Bible I mean Moses says we did it you can do it we applied the token you can do it man we saw our enemies drowned in the in the Red Sea they're dead you can do it man whatever we done you can do come on church but now he says we are compassed with the great a cloud of witnesses there's Paul my radius Martin Columba loser Wesley Branham we got those of our own congregation that's already we went over there a cloud of witnesses seeing where to pass about with other men who have run their race I've done the same thing then let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily beset us and let us run back hallelujah with perseverance with not giving up we're putting everything you got into it the works with your grace [Applause] get a position but everything you got into it I'm not gonna quit I'm not gonna stop I've gotta persevere I'll endure to the end because it wasn't endure to the end the same I want you to run looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher he started us he's gonna finish it hallelujah I said he started he's gonna finish it right with your eyes on Jesus Jesus looking for Jesus who they're after the finisher of our faith who for the joy for the joy somebody helped me preach now for the joy for the joy of a new body he did it to get a bride come on put the joy of getting you he found the couple and then he endured the cross he despised the shame and he sat down at the right hand of God he did it bring you together pride come on somebody but look to Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who far the joy the joy of being together with the millions of the hosts of all the saints down to the ages of the joy of being a new body that can never see and never have a bathtub never have an evil deed having a body that the load is heavy the cross is heavy it's too high it is too hot it's going to be worth it off put everything you got into it jump slack off in this hour wrap with everything that's in your heart within your life so easily beset you whatever

accepted in the beloved in the time you surrender your life to God the time you put everything you got into it in the time you become more sincere like I treats the other day got call him for more sincerity in the time unit time for a fresh medication a man seeing we have a cloud of witnesses appalled who would give us give us heavy beheaded for the gospel men and women down to the ages who stood for God I can see saints of God tried right down to the very end I watched an old veteran soldier bosom friend of mine Daniel Williams get a brain bleed brain a brain tumor I mean dying wither

know God they serve and they loved not their lives unto the death but they're faithful they're looking over the banister do you know the Bible said that the heavens rejoice and we usually say the Angels rejoice but the Bible cendars add there's rejoicing before the angels before the presence of God there's rejoicing for ever sinner that repents keeps you imagine as the news reaches heaven when
