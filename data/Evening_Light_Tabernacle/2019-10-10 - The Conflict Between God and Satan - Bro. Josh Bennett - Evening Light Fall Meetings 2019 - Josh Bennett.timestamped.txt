[28:58] into the ministry of the word tonight it

[34:19] honored to be here with all these great
[34:21] men of God and and to be here with you

[34:29] something tonight that would be an
[34:31] encouragement to the people of God amen
[34:35] so let's just bow our hearts together
[34:36] and let's just look to the Lord Heavenly
[34:39] Father we just thank you Lord for this
[34:41] time Lord this what we consider it to be
[34:44] an opportunity in order to be able to
[34:47] come Lord into your presence and Noor we
[34:51] believe God that we're in your presence
[34:53] tonight Lord because you keep all your
[34:56] appointments and Lord you've already
[34:58] promised in your word that wherever two
[35:00] or three are gathered in your name that
[35:02] you will be in the midst and Lord we
[35:04] believe that you are in the midst
[35:06] tonight God we believe that you are here
[35:08] and Lord I believe that wherever you are
[35:12] the supernatural is a reality wherever
[35:17] you are Lord it's impossible that we
[35:20] could remain in the same condition that
[35:22] we're in Lord so I pray tonight that
[35:25] every person Lord just now with what
[35:28] settle it in their heart Lord that
[35:30] they're gonna leave different than they
[35:32] came we're gonna leave better Christians
[35:34] we're gonna leave Lord more in love with
[35:37] you with a closer relationship we're
[35:39] gonna rededicate and consecrate our
[35:42] lives but we're gonna take and seize the
[35:44] moment tonight and we're gonna Lord take
[35:47] this opportunity Lord to let's to come
[35:49] up to the Masters table and the Lord to
[35:52] draw nine to you and you already
[35:54] promised God that if we would draw nine
[35:56] to you that you would draw nine to us
[35:58] and Lord that's what we want to do
[36:00] tonight so God we just ask thee Lord as
[36:03] we take this Bible Lord how precious
[36:06] that it
[36:07] and Lord as we open it up God we know
[36:09] this is your word and it's it's anointed
[36:13] word Lord it's infallible heavens and
[36:15] earth will pass away but that word can
[36:17] never fail but Lord we as we open this
[36:21] Bible tonight God anybody can read the
[36:23] words but Lord we're asking the author
[36:25] of the book or just a drop down tonight
[36:28] and Lord make this word a living reality
[36:31] to us lord I pray that you would open
[36:33] every heart and Lord that we would
[36:36] receive the word with gladness Lord I
[36:39] pray as we receive that word Lord that
[36:41] we would become the word that's the
[36:43] desire we have tonight so God we just
[36:45] ask your blessing upon the service now
[36:47] and lord may you have preeminence god I
[36:50] pray Lord that your perfect will would
[36:52] be done among us in the name of Jesus
[36:55] Christ we ask a man in amen amen if you
[37:00] take your Bibles tonight we'll ask you
[37:02] to turn with us to the book of second

[37:43] may not be bold when I am present with
[37:46] that confidence wherewith I think to be
[37:49] bold against some which think of us as
[37:52] if we walked according to the flesh for
[37:56] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[37:59] war after the flesh for the weapons of
[38:03] our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[38:06] through God to the pulling down of
[38:09] strongholds casting down imaginations
[38:12] and every high thing that exalteth
[38:15] itself against the knowledge of God and
[38:18] bringing into captivity
[38:20] every thought to the obedience of Christ
[38:23] and having in a readiness to revenge all
[38:27] disobedience when your obedience is
[38:31] fulfilled revelations the twelfth
[38:34] chapter if you'd like to turn with us
[38:38] their revelations chapter 12 we'll just
[38:43] read this and let you have your seats
[38:45] tonight
[38:45] revelations 12 and we'll read from verse
[38:47] 7 and there was war in heaven Michael
[38:52] and his angels fought against the Dragon
[38:54] and the dragon fought and his angels and
[38:57] prevailed not neither was their place
[39:01] found any more in heaven and the Great
[39:04] Dragon was cast out that old serpent
[39:06] called the devil and Satan which
[39:09] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[39:11] out into the earth and his angels were
[39:14] cast out with him and I heard a loud
[39:17] voice saying in heaven now is come
[39:19] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[39:22] of our God and the power of his Christ
[39:24] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[39:27] down which accused them before our God
[39:30] day and night and they overcame him by
[39:33] the blood of the Lamb and by the word of
[39:36] their testimony and they loved not their
[39:39] lives unto the death
[39:41] may God just had his blessings you can
[39:43] have your seats this evening I mean he's
[39:52] glad to be an overcomer amen
[39:57] I'd like to read also from Ephesians 6
[40:00] we'll just read this tonight as we as we
[40:05] just begin to enter into our thought
[40:08] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 Paul
[40:11] says finally my brethren be strong in
[40:13] the Lord and then the power of his might
[40:15] put on the whole armour of God that you
[40:19] might be able to stand against the wiles
[40:21] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[40:24] flesh and blood but against
[40:26] principalities against powers against
[40:29] rulers of the darkness of this world
[40:32] against spiritual wickedness and
[40:34] places I want you to notice that Paul is
[40:37] again saying we are not wrestling
[40:40] against flesh and blood so you can you
[40:43] can look at your neighbor tonight and
[40:44] say you're not my enemy
[40:46] a man your wife is not your enemy
[40:49] you mean your husband is not your enemy
[40:51] your brother's not your enemy we wrestle
[40:53] not against flesh and blood but against
[40:55] principalities against powers against
[40:58] rulers of the darkness of this world
[41:00] against spiritual wickedness in high
[41:02] places
[41:03] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[41:06] of God that you might be able to stand
[41:08] in the evil day and having done all to
[41:11] stand stand therefore having your loins
[41:14] Girt about with truth and having on the
[41:17] breastplate of righteousness and your
[41:19] feet shod with the preparation of the
[41:21] gospel of peace and above all take the
[41:23] shield of faith wherewith you shall be
[41:26] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[41:28] the wicked and take the helmet of
[41:30] salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[41:32] which is the word of God praying always
[41:35] with all prayer and supplication in the
[41:37] spirit watching thereunto with all
[41:40] perseverance and supplication for All
[41:43] Saints amen I'd like to just speak to
[41:46] you for a few minutes tonight by the
[41:48] help of the Lord on a thought and I
[41:51] would title it the conflict between God
[41:53] and Satan and I just want to approach
[41:57] this you know but even even our prophet
[41:59] when he preached the message he he
[42:01] titled Satan's Eden there in 1965 when
[42:04] he was taking that thought he said I
[42:06] just would like to bring something to
[42:08] enlighten you to make us better soldiers
[42:12] in the field that we're fighting in now
[42:14] Amen he says he would like to bring
[42:17] something to help us learn the tactics
[42:18] of the enemy so that we could block
[42:21] everything before it gets to us aiming
[42:24] to learn to keep the punches off of you
[42:26] amen and and so I would just like to
[42:28] approach it in that way tonight I
[42:31] believe that we need to know our enemy I
[42:33] believe that we need to know the battle
[42:35] that we're in tonight you see because we
[42:38] you know we can't we're not fighting in
[42:41] Luther's day we're not we're not living
[42:42] in Wesley's day
[42:44] but we're in a battle right now and we
[42:47] need something to equip us in the battle
[42:49] we're in right now amen and so how many
[42:52] knows you're in a battle Amen if you
[42:55] ain't in a battle I say you just go
[42:57] ahead and come on to the altar now
[42:59] because even if you're not in a battle
[43:01] then there's something wrong with your
[43:02] testimony amen because we are in a
[43:06] battle we are in a war but but this war
[43:08] didn't start with you and you're not the
[43:10] only one that's fought in this war and
[43:12] as a matter of fact the conflict is not
[43:14] even between you and Satan the conflict
[43:17] is between God and Satan it just so
[43:20] happens that many of us amen are
[43:23] identified with Jesus Christ amen
[43:26] and because we have taken sides with
[43:28] Jesus tonight
[43:29] he may we have become an enemy of his in
[43:34] other words amen Satan is his enemy and
[43:37] because we have taken sides with Jesus
[43:39] then Satan has now become our enemy amen
[43:42] you see what I'm saying even even though
[43:44] the conflict is between God and Satan
[43:46] amen now we have entered into this
[43:49] battle by identification amen but the
[43:53] war didn't start with us even it started
[43:55] in heaven I believe that if we can find
[43:58] the origin of this great battle of this
[44:00] war that's going on I believe would help
[44:02] us tonight so the battle started in
[44:04] heaven but the prophecy in the fourth
[44:06] seal it'll finish on the earth in the
[44:08] form of Armageddon amen and the greatest
[44:11] battle ever fought he said this great
[44:13] first battle that was ever fought begin
[44:15] in heaven when Michael and his angels
[44:17] fought against Lucifer in his angel -
[44:19] angel it first started the first battle
[44:22] was in heaven
[44:22] so sin did not originate on the earth it
[44:26] originated in heaven and it was thrown
[44:28] down from heaven cast out of heaven to
[44:31] the earth and fell on human means the
[44:33] battle even from Angels becoming human
[44:36] battles and Satan come to destroy God's
[44:40] creation he meant what God had created
[44:43] for himself that was what his purpose
[44:45] was was to destroy it and then the
[44:48] battle begin here
[44:49] owners and it began in us and has been
[44:52] raging ever since Amen so we can see
[44:56] that this battle started in heaven but
[44:59] the Battle of Angels has now become
[45:01] human battles Amon but you know what I
[45:04] would like to point out to you tonight
[45:06] if you can see that the battle first
[45:09] started in heaven you can also see Amen
[45:12] that God was victorious there and if he
[45:16] was victorious there I believe that God
[45:18] will be victorious here and you can also
[45:22] see that there was some angels in heaven
[45:24] even the Bible says that they were elect
[45:28] angels amen and there was angels in
[45:30] heaven that stood with Michael Amen when
[45:32] he fought against Lucifer
[45:34] amen and I believe if there was angels
[45:36] in heaven even that were elected to stay
[45:39] with Michael amen against the lie the
[45:41] enemy amen and now the battle now
[45:44] started in heaven has come to the earth
[45:47] amen there's also a myth some humans on
[45:50] the earth even there's some people in
[45:52] the ER tonight that are elected of God
[45:55] to stay with Christ against the enemy
[45:58] tonight
[45:59] hallelujah amen do you believe that how
[46:03] many he's glad to be one of them oh yes
[46:07] Amen now we see in this great war that
[46:09] there's two powers Amen there's two
[46:12] powers really there's only two powers
[46:14] that are represented here and a power is
[46:16] the the capacity or the ability to
[46:20] direct or to influence the behavior of
[46:24] others or the course of events amen and
[46:26] brother BAM says in the greatest battle
[46:28] ever fought he says we've had Wars after
[46:30] wars and rumors of wars and if the earth
[46:33] stands we'll have plenty more wars but
[46:35] do you realize there's only really two
[46:37] powers in all the universe of all our
[46:41] differences between nations and
[46:42] differences between each other and
[46:44] everything it all mounts up to two
[46:47] powers there's only two powers and
[46:49] there's only two kingdoms all the rest
[46:51] the little minor things are connected to
[46:54] either one of those powers and those
[46:57] powers is God's power and Satan's power
[47:00] every war every disorder everything that
[47:03] comes alone
[47:04] is either controlled by God's power or
[47:07] Satan's power because that's the only
[47:09] two powers there is is the power of life
[47:12] and the power of death amen and Saint
[47:16] his power is a perverted power of God
[47:19] it's no real power it's a perversion of
[47:21] God's power everything Satan has death
[47:24] is only a perverted life a lies a
[47:27] treatments told adultery is an act
[47:29] misuse everything Satan has got it's
[47:32] something that's perverted but it is a
[47:34] power and we are here and and we are
[47:38] today sitting here and one or the other
[47:41] power is going to control us amen
[47:46] something is going to control you
[47:48] tonight what power the other even in
[47:51] this service tonight it's going to
[47:53] control you you're going to be
[47:55] influenced by either one of these powers
[47:59] tonight Amen so the prophecy
[48:01] so let's cast out the evil one and let's
[48:05] take our position like the stars of the
[48:07] heavens amen so as we look at this we
[48:11] begin to see there's two powers now you
[48:13] can call it whatever you want to right
[48:15] versus wrong wisdom versus faith fever
[48:18] or you know doubt versus faith or fear
[48:21] versus of love or you could you could
[48:24] give it all kind of names but in reality
[48:27] amen there's only two powers the power
[48:29] of God and the power Satan Amen so you
[48:33] recognize that tonight
[48:34] amen and so you're gonna be influenced
[48:37] by one of those powers Amen now I just
[48:40] would like to say that in this war or
[48:43] this conflict that we're in there's many
[48:45] battles amen and you know because there
[48:48] can be many battles within a war and and
[48:51] you're going through battles as a church
[48:53] and we're going through battles as the
[48:55] Bride of Christ and you know and there's
[48:57] you know for in others you know there's
[48:59] battles that we go through collectively
[49:01] as as a as a congregation but then aim
[49:04] in this war you got your own individual
[49:06] battles amen
[49:08] in the end so amen brother Bell says
[49:10] this he said to lose a battle is not to
[49:14] lose a war I don't know about the rest
[49:17] of y'all but that's encouraging to me
[49:19] because I for one have lost some battles
[49:24] but I have not lost the water hey I'm
[49:29] still here tonight amen listen I've got
[49:33] knocked down a few times but I didn't
[49:35] stay down is there anybody else that's
[49:39] been knocked down is there anybody else
[49:41] has lost a few battles along the way but
[49:43] the promise is to lose a battle
[49:45] is not to lose a warrior Patton lost
[49:48] several battles but he never lost the
[49:50] war that's right we'll lose a lot of
[49:52] battles too but will not lose the war
[49:57] hallelujah amen I'm encouraged by that
[50:01] Amen now remember amen there's a power
[50:04] of Satan the power of God now brother
[50:05] Branham there in the 55 he actually
[50:09] preached a series of sermons he preached
[50:11] the power Satan the power of God the
[50:12] power of decision even and in that one
[50:15] of those services there he says Satan
[50:17] does we do not want to be mistaken Satan
[50:20] has a power and that power is dead amen
[50:24] we see in Ephesians 6:12 we read where
[50:27] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[50:29] but against principalities against
[50:31] powers against rulers of the darkness of
[50:34] this world and Ephesians 2 and 2 it says
[50:36] we're in times past we want the court
[50:38] according to the course of this world
[50:40] according to the Prince of the power of
[50:43] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[50:46] the children of disobedience so we can
[50:48] see even by the scripture that Satan has
[50:51] a power
[50:52] Amen but thank God there is a greater
[50:56] power than he has
[50:59] but how many believes there's a real
[51:01] devil how many can recognize tonight
[51:05] that Satan is real amen I know there's
[51:08] people out here trying to convince us
[51:10] that there ain't no real devil and there
[51:12] is no real demons and there is no you
[51:15] know and they're trying to you know just
[51:16] explain everything away and and take
[51:19] everything and they say that Satan you
[51:21] know I tell you
[51:22] maybe there's all kind of ideas and
[51:24] theories out there there's no real devil
[51:26] there's no real hell but I want to tell
[51:28] you there is a real devil he is real and
[51:31] he's got a power but if there's a real
[51:34] devil it's gotta be a real God and if
[51:39] Satan is real and he has a power I say
[51:43] God is more real and he has more power
[51:49] the power of God is greater than the
[51:52] power of the enemy
[51:54] amen the promise said the power of Satan
[51:56] is dead but the power of God is life
[52:00] amen and what is greater death or life I
[52:04] just I might get ahead of myself right
[52:07] here Bible go ahead and do it even
[52:09] you're gonna defeat the last enemy
[52:12] according this Bible there be a last
[52:14] enemy and that last enemy is death and
[52:17] it just so happens that you are our
[52:20] people that's anointed to defeat the
[52:22] last enemy you say brother how we ever
[52:26] going to do that because Amen Jesus the
[52:29] life of Jesus Christ defeated death
[52:32] 2,000 years ago and that same life will
[52:36] defeat death again hallelujah amen
[52:39] you're living in a time when the token
[52:41] life the literal life of Jesus Christ
[52:44] this is available evidence here it's not
[52:48] coming is here and that life will defeat
[52:51] this the power of the life of Christ is
[52:56] greater than the power of death do you
[53:02] believe that tonight Amen the probably
[53:05] just asked the question he said which is
[53:06] strong is life or death life which is
[53:10] stro is light or dark a lot even how
[53:16] many knows that light will always take
[53:18] supreme authority over darkness
[53:21] the only way that darkness can exist is
[53:25] for light to be absent come on darkness
[53:30] cannot overtake light the only way that
[53:33] darkness can exist is for light to leave
[53:37] that's why the church is in darkness
[53:40] that's why the world is in darkness
[53:42] because they put Christ on the outside
[53:45] hallelujah darkness could have never
[53:48] overtaken Amy where he was as long as
[53:51] life was there as long as life was there
[53:53] even the darkness could not overtake
[53:55] even the only way that darkness can
[53:58] exist is in the absence of light
[54:03] hallelujah
[54:04] so you can see that darkness cannot
[54:06] overtake or overtake light but this bill
[54:11] can be dark and you turn on a switch and
[54:16] light will always overtake the darkness
[54:22] hallelujah ôhe glad there's a man here
[54:25] that can turn on the light even listen
[54:29] even you might be here tonight and
[54:31] you're living in a world of darkness
[54:33] aiming your life's all covered up with
[54:35] sin and unbelief I got good news the
[54:37] ringing you there's a man here that can
[54:40] turn on the light hallelujah in just a
[54:43] moment he flipped a switch and we're
[54:46] darkness was black will exist because
[54:50] the power of God is greater than the
[54:53] power of the enemy
[54:54] [Applause]
[54:56] that's right God is much stronger the
[54:59] power of God is much stronger than the
[55:01] power of death because he's life he was
[55:04] spurt wick which was first life or death
[55:06] life now watch this amen the promises
[55:10] you got a weapon there to fight that
[55:11] sickness with it's in you
[55:15] God gave it to you why would you stand
[55:19] back like a coward why you'll stand on
[55:22] the sidelines let's follow the captain
[55:24] let's following the one that went to
[55:26] Calvary when he went to Calvary he was
[55:29] wounded for our transgressions with His
[55:31] stripes we were healed take what he

[55:40] alive I invite you to do it right now

[55:48] well I tell you somebody needs to say it
[55:50] tonight
[55:51] aimin that Devils been telling you all
[55:53] kind of stuff a man is fighting always
[55:55] before you got here ain't me just take
[55:57] the opportunity tonight and tell the
[56:00] devil amen you're the promos that tell
[56:05] the devil is a liar Christ said he has
[56:08] overcome the world and greater is He
[56:11] that is in you than he that is in the
[56:14] world greater is the power of Christ in
[56:18] you than the sickness that you have in
[56:21] your body tonight greater is a power of
[56:23] Christ in you then that little bit
[56:25] setting sin that you can't overcome
[56:27] let's take that Holy Spirit and fight
[56:30] the devil down hallelujah how many like

[56:35] just take the Holy Spirit and fight the
[56:38] devil down and walk out victorious as
[56:41] heroes of the Cross Oh hallelujah amen
[56:46] that's what I want to do tonight first
[56:48] John four and for you I've got little
[56:50] children and over and have overcome them
[56:53] because greater is He that is in you
[56:57] than he tuss in the world
[56:59] you know what brother Brown said and how
[57:01] can overcome he said that's real
[57:03] overcoming first you gotta recognize
[57:05] that Satan is real and he is against you
[57:10] he said and then realize or recognize
[57:13] that greater is He that is in you than
[57:17] he that's in the world Oh hallelujah
[57:22] Amen listen friends amen you gotta first
[57:25] get a revelation that Christ is in you
[57:27] even you can't do that without a new
[57:29] birth even I'm convinced that some of us
[57:33] just need to get the Holy Ghost amen and
[57:36] recognize and realize even that greater
[57:39] is He that is in us than he that's in
[57:42] the world
[57:43] oh my hey watch what he said he that is
[57:48] in you greater what is he that was in
[57:50] David then the bear that stole his sheep
[57:53] greater is he that was in David than the
[57:55] line that come in and took one of his
[57:56] lambs greater was he that was in beta
[57:59] than the enemy
[58:00] amen listen I love our brother band with
[58:03] Taylor and you know here was glass
[58:05] standing out there and making his big
[58:06] boast and even telling all that he died
[58:08] but the promise said then words fell on
[58:11] the wrong ears that they hear come
[58:14] little David down there to the cap of
[58:16] Israel and he heard all that
[58:18] amen and they even begin to recognize
[58:20] something amen David I believe with all
[58:22] my heart David caught a revelation in
[58:24] 1st Samuel 17 and 45 and then David's
[58:28] then said David to the Felicity now
[58:30] coming to me with a sword and with a
[58:32] spear and with a shield but I come to
[58:35] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[58:37] the God of the armies of Israel whom
[58:40] thou has to find this day will the Lord
[58:44] deliver thee into my hand and I will
[58:46] smite thee and take that head from thee
[58:49] and I will give the carcasses of the
[58:51] host of the Philistines this day under
[58:53] the fowls of the air and the wild beasts
[58:56] of the earth to all that all of the
[58:58] earth may know that there is a God in
[59:01] Israel and all this assembly shall know
[59:05] that the Lord saith not with a sword and
[59:08] a spear for the battle is the Lord's
[59:12] hallelujah and He will give you into our
[59:16] hands I believe the revelation that
[59:19] David called
[59:20] was this ain't my battle this is God's
[59:24] battle
[59:25] I'm only here representing the side of
[59:28] the right and he is only here
[59:31] representing the side of the road so it
[59:34] don't matter how big he loots and how
[59:36] little I am a man I'm only represented

[1:02:31] [Applause]
[1:02:40] whoa thank you Jesus
[1:02:45] so powerful revelation when you begin to
[1:02:48] realize just st. my battle this is God's
[1:02:53] battle you know the children is okay
[1:02:56] maybe but I believe it was Jehoshaphat
[1:02:58] over there in second chronicles 20
[1:03:00] there's three powers united against the
[1:03:04] children of israel they come to war
[1:03:05] against the children of israel Ava and
[1:03:07] Johanna or Judah rather and Joseph and
[1:03:10] king of Judah Amen you know Judah repre
[1:03:13] you know Judah means praise so now
[1:03:16] there's a great enemy coming to the war
[1:03:19] against praise Amen and Jehoshaphat when
[1:03:23] this went and listened they were
[1:03:24] outnumbered even go read your scripture
[1:03:28] they were outnumbered
[1:03:29] maybe the hearts were stacked against
[1:03:31] them but Jehoshaphat even caught a
[1:03:34] prayer meeting amen any-any assemble
[1:03:39] together all of the other of the
[1:03:42] children of Israel even both smiling
[1:03:44] great all of them the young ones old
[1:03:46] ones all of them got them all gathered
[1:03:48] up even they just decide to have Church
[1:03:52] you know what I think that's so amazing
[1:03:54] aiming that in their Time of Troubles
[1:03:57] they didn't ever come over to your house
[1:03:59] so fast fine mine you know thing man
[1:04:01] that is really things were really turned
[1:04:03] upside down and it seems like the Lord
[1:04:05] has forsaken us and everything is going
[1:04:07] wrong I think I'll just stay home
[1:04:12] you know I think I just lay out on
[1:04:14] Wednesday night he much seems like you
[1:04:16] know everything's went bad anyhow so I
[1:04:18] think you know I I'm kind of discouraged
[1:04:21] I just sit around the house know when
[1:04:24] everything was going wrong he said let's
[1:04:26] have a meeting
[1:04:28] let's have revival baby but don't you
[1:04:32] realize even all the all the armies are
[1:04:34] gathering up against you define yeah
[1:04:36] I think what we need to do is have
[1:04:38] Church even because we can't a man
[1:04:42] ain't it amazing that to us about never
[1:04:44] gathered all of his great generals
[1:04:46] together he didn't have a award meeting
[1:04:49] and putting the best military minds that
[1:04:53] he had together and try to come up with
[1:04:54] a plan to defeat the enemy he said let's
[1:04:57] have Church let's consult God let's see
[1:05:00] what God has to say about it
[1:05:02] apparently I'm right in the middle of
[1:05:04] all that even a young man begin to
[1:05:06] prophesy even Annie begin to tell them
[1:05:09] he says heart can you hold you need a
[1:05:11] whole you and happiness of Jerusalem
[1:05:13] amen and now King Jehoshaphat firt thus
[1:05:15] saith the Lord unto you be not afraid
[1:05:18] nor dismayed by the reason of this great
[1:05:20] multitude for the battle is not yours
[1:05:23] but gods tomorrow go ye down against
[1:05:28] them behold they have come up by the
[1:05:31] clip of Xia's and you shall find them at
[1:05:33] the end of the brit before the
[1:05:35] wilderness of Jarell and you shall not
[1:05:37] need to fight in this battle set
[1:05:39] yourselves
[1:05:40] stand you still and see the salvation of
[1:05:43] the Lord with you hold Judah and
[1:05:45] Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed
[1:05:47] tomorrow go out against them for the
[1:05:50] Lord will be with you now when you get
[1:05:54] home you can go read the rest of it you
[1:05:55] know what they did the Bible says they
[1:05:57] got up early amen do you realize they
[1:06:01] were outnumbered out man all the odds
[1:06:03] was against them
[1:06:04] amen and they were going down to a
[1:06:05] battle even it looked like it was
[1:06:07] impossible for them for them to win but
[1:06:10] they were so excited about it that they
[1:06:13] decided to get up early
[1:06:16] seemed like a good day to sleep in to me
[1:06:19] but they they decide to get up early and
[1:06:22] jehosophat say I tell you what we're
[1:06:24] gonna do any we're gonna sing the
[1:06:26] singers and the musicians out hallelujah
[1:06:29] and I want y'all to start praising God
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:34] amen and all the soldiers will follow
[1:06:37] and brother Browne said that's the order
[1:06:39] of God's army anyhow amen do you realize
[1:06:41] that's why we have church the way we do
[1:06:43] amen we started out with singing in
[1:06:45] music Amy you know what we're doing
[1:06:47] we're set in a battle in a reign
[1:06:49] hallelujah
[1:06:50] we can't ready to whip some Devils
[1:06:52] brother maybe that's why we're already
[1:06:54] singing and rejoicing because a battle
[1:06:59] is getting ready to take place and the
[1:07:03] Bible says while they were singing and
[1:07:06] praising God the Lord said and Bush was
[1:07:09] against the enemy and they began to kill
[1:07:12] one another and by the time the children
[1:07:16] ain't meant by the time Judah got down
[1:07:19] to the battlefield it was covered with
[1:07:21] dead bodies and none of them escaped the
[1:07:24] enemy was dead hi and they never drew a
[1:07:30] sword all they did was sing the praises
[1:07:33] of God and rejoice and lift their hands
[1:07:37] and ate and the word ain't God destroy
[1:07:40] their enemy
[1:07:43] I love you you know what I love about it
[1:07:48] even when they got down there front of
[1:07:50] them dead bodies God said now you go out
[1:07:52] there and get the spools and it took
[1:07:57] them three days to gather the spools of
[1:08:01] a battle that they never even drew a
[1:08:03] sword to fight brother that's how good
[1:08:07] your Guardians he said you just praise
[1:08:10] me and I'll fight your battles and when
[1:08:13] I get done destroying your enemy you can
[1:08:17] just gather all the spoils hi I say
[1:08:21] let's worship Him tonight
[1:08:22] let's praise Him tonight let's watch our
[1:08:24] God as a warrior tonight and when God is
[1:08:28] finished with this meeting are we gonna
[1:08:32] do it's just gather the swalls
[1:08:35] somebody's gonna get you joy back
[1:08:38] somebody's gonna get your health back
[1:08:41] somebody's gonna get your children back
[1:08:43] early because God it's destroyed our
[1:08:47] enemy and we
[1:08:49] forgetting us fools I say we got
[1:08:56] something to chat about we got some to
[1:08:58] single but we got some appraised I'll
[1:09:01] bet because while we're singing God is
[1:09:04] fighting just going crazy
[1:09:28] you know a that way because God takes an
[1:09:33] attack on your personal when the devil
[1:09:46] touches you you know what God God's
[1:09:50] attitude towards that is whatever you
[1:09:52] done to the least of these my little
[1:09:54] ones you've done it unto me
[1:09:58] I prove a table any wing take that
[1:10:02] scripture we take another scripture when
[1:10:03] when when Saul which became Paul was was
[1:10:07] met by an angel or the pillar of fire
[1:10:09] should say when when the pillar of fire
[1:10:12] come to Paul and he spoke the poet says
[1:10:14] he tells him I am Jesus whom thou
[1:10:18] persecuted I know now Paul never
[1:10:22] purchased you to Jesus in the flesh as a
[1:10:24] man anybody was persecuting the church
[1:10:28] but Jesus did not tell Paul amen I'm
[1:10:31] Jesus and you're persecuting my church
[1:10:33] he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecute us
[1:10:38] Eamon because when you persecute the
[1:10:40] church amen when the devil touches you
[1:10:45] God takes offense
[1:10:47] [Applause]
[1:10:50] excellent Exodus 23 20 by hold I send my
[1:10:54] angel before thee to keep you in a way
[1:10:56] to bring thee to the place I prepared
[1:10:59] beware vehement obey his voice provoke
[1:11:01] him not for he will not pardon your
[1:11:03] transgression for my name is in him but
[1:11:06] if thou shalt indeed obey his voice how
[1:11:09] many won't so be the voice of the angel
[1:11:10] and do all that I speak then will even
[1:11:14] then I will be an enemy unto thine
[1:11:18] enemies and an adversary under thy
[1:11:22] adversaries what a promise God is
[1:11:27] telling you even if you keep my word if
[1:11:30] you obey the voice of the angel oh
[1:11:33] brother I tell you that's why I don't
[1:11:35] care what they say about this message I
[1:11:37] don't let them criticize make fun I do
[1:11:39] whatever they want to do even I take
[1:11:41] this message even there's something in
[1:11:43] my heart I just want to say a man be it
[1:11:47] unto me according to thy word hallelujah
[1:11:50] even full of the Word of God
[1:11:52] entitles you to the token even and when
[1:11:56] you got that kind of attitude towards a
[1:11:58] towards the angel of the Lord Amen God
[1:12:00] is telling you even your enemy it's now
[1:12:04] my enemy and your adversary it's not my
[1:12:09] officer well I don't know what that does
[1:12:11] to the rest of y'all but I want to tell
[1:12:13] you what it does to me even when I
[1:12:14] realize even that my enemy is God's
[1:12:17] enemy I also realized I just got the
[1:12:21] victory
[1:12:23] hallelujah because I might not be able
[1:12:26] to defeat him I might not have the power
[1:12:30] to overcome him but my god is more than
[1:12:35] able hallelujah I love that my enemies
[1:12:44] using me God takes an offense when
[1:12:46] you're attacked he takes his attack on
[1:12:48] his self you know we got they got what
[1:12:52] they call NATO you know in this whole
[1:12:53] bunch of Nations they made an agreement
[1:12:55] if you're a part of that if you are a
[1:12:59] part of that agreement you're in that
[1:13:01] considered in that an attack on one is
[1:13:05] an attack on all and and because we're a
[1:13:09] part of NATO even if if they attack a
[1:13:12] foreign land ain't got nothing to do
[1:13:14] with us
[1:13:15] amen we are obligated and responsible to
[1:13:20] assist
[1:13:24] amen and we have to fight that enemy
[1:13:27] just like we have been attacked on our
[1:13:30] own soil oh brother I say if it's that
[1:13:35] way with NATO ever and I'm covenant that
[1:13:38] God that that that has nothing to do
[1:13:40] with God made by men Amen what about
[1:13:42] when you enter into a covenant with
[1:13:44] Christ amen when Satan attacks you God
[1:13:48] takes it personal but let's flip that
[1:13:50] over a little bit
[1:13:52] amen amen when somebody attacks this
[1:13:54] Bible it ought to be an offense to you
[1:13:59] when somebody attacks the name of Jesus
[1:14:03] Christ amen

[1:14:20] I said direct quote by the way if it's
[1:14:22] against the word that's against you it's
[1:14:24] against your enemy hey but and if God
[1:14:29] takes it personal when you're attacked I
[1:14:32] believe that you and I ought to take it
[1:14:34] personal when he's attacked
[1:14:38] oh come on even I think they're not of
[1:14:42] Amen yeah yeah you know it ought to
[1:14:44] bother you when people start running

[1:14:49] when they start calling this prophet a
[1:14:51] false prophet amen and start talking
[1:14:54] about aiming the cloud and the pillar of
[1:14:55] fire even enough let me just tell you

[1:22:18] when he used the army of destruction to
[1:22:20] disbelieve God's Word and set up a
[1:22:22] better Kingdom than Michael had and God
[1:22:24] cast him out it's God's method is to

[1:22:46] heaven when Jesus Christ was only on the
[1:22:49] earth even what did he do when he come

[1:22:56] out
[1:22:59] hallelujah look maybe say why it's
[1:23:03] wonderful for God but what about us
[1:23:04] we'll just take this Luke chapter 10 in
[1:23:06] verse 1 after these things the Lord
[1:23:08] appointed other 70 also it sent him out
[1:23:11] two by two before his face into every
[1:23:14] city in place wherewith he himself would
[1:23:16] come verse 17 and the seventy returned
[1:23:18] again with joy saying Lord even the
[1:23:20] Devils are subject unto us through thy
[1:23:22] name and he said unto them I beheld
[1:23:24] Satan as lightning falling from heaven
[1:23:25] but hold I give unto your pyre the
[1:23:27] turtles serpents and scorpions and over
[1:23:30] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[1:23:31] by any means a man shall hurt you
[1:23:35] Amen is that right even though that
[1:23:37] notice is even he said notwithstanding
[1:23:39] he me rejoice not that the spirits are
[1:23:41] certainly on you but rather rejoice
[1:23:43] because your names are written in heaven
[1:23:45] so we know what to rejoice about tonight
[1:23:48] how many knows your names written in
[1:23:49] heaven but notice this Jesus aim a

[1:23:55] what did he send them out to do he gave
[1:23:57] them power to cast out the enemy Francis
[1:24:03] is powerful because this is before the
[1:24:05] blood was shed this was before Pentecost
[1:24:08] this is before the Holy Ghost come and
[1:24:11] brother Graham says amen immediately
[1:24:13] after Jesus gave His disciples power
[1:24:15] against unclean spirits and they went
[1:24:17] casting out Devils he sent them out two
[1:24:19] by two and as you go preach the kingdom
[1:24:21] of heaven heal the sick cast out devils
[1:24:23] and they come back rejoicing happily and
[1:24:25] he said rejoice not because the Devils
[1:24:28] are subject unto you but rejoice because
[1:24:29] your names are written in heaven he said
[1:24:31] - hail Satan falling from heaven like
[1:24:34] lightning see the power of that church
[1:24:37] moving forward had just upset the whole
[1:24:41] kingdom of Satan you see any Psalm

[1:24:46] again given power to his church to go
[1:24:48] out and he beheld him falling like
[1:24:51] lightning from heaven amen the power of
[1:24:53] that church anybody said I give you
[1:24:55] power over unclean spirits and that
[1:24:57] really upset the kingdom of Satan and

[1:30:23] my heartening and brother Wayne I had
[1:30:26] over the years he's just been so close
[1:30:29] and and the way that the Lord just
[1:30:32] brought us together it's just
[1:30:33] supernatural and and and you know a lot
[1:30:38] of people don't would never know this
[1:30:40] but I was studying that door was dealing
[1:30:43] my heart on this thought some time back
[1:30:45] I was going there's just a lot of stuff
[1:30:47] you know going on I was young people
[1:30:50] coming up and had prayer and I seen what
[1:30:53] a battle that they were in the Lord just
[1:30:55] started dealing with me and and I took a
[1:30:57] series I don't remember how many was
[1:30:59] some of these poor people having to hear
[1:31:02] this stuff again but but but you know
[1:31:06] what was Supernatural about it
[1:31:08] his brother Wayne had been I don't
[1:31:10] remember where he's at he's somewhere
[1:31:11] overseas and he was overseas and he was
[1:31:13] coming back home and he pick up the
[1:31:18] phone to call me and somehow in the
[1:31:19] conversation we just got talking about
[1:31:21] something and he mentioned a certain
[1:31:23] sermon or something somehow it got
[1:31:25] brought up and I Savannah I was just
[1:31:27] preaching and I told him entitled my
[1:31:28] sermon he said you got to be kidding me
[1:31:29] he said man that is exactly what the
[1:31:32] Lord has put on my heart I think he was
[1:31:34] just getting ready to preach it that
[1:31:35] night or something like that and in and
[1:31:37] we just kept talking I said you know I
[1:31:39] said man I went I was listening to three
[1:31:40] sermons really around preaching the
[1:31:42] fifty five the power of Satan the power
[1:31:43] he said I listen them on the plane
[1:31:47] and it was so it was so supernatural Hal
[1:31:51] and and I said he said what was you
[1:31:53] getting out of I said well well in the
[1:31:55] main points I was really seeing was that
[1:31:57] the conflict is not between you and
[1:32:00] Satan but between God and Satan this is
[1:32:03] not this battle didn't start with you I
[1:32:05] mean this battle is not you're not alone
[1:32:07] in this war he's a man that's it's
[1:32:10] incredible because that's one of the
[1:32:12] very things that he was seeing out of it
[1:32:14] it was just amazing and in the
[1:32:17] conversation or it might have been I
[1:32:18] think was in that conversation he
[1:32:20] mentioned something about Muhammad Ali
[1:32:23] which trucker
[1:32:24] we were just talking to a fellowship
[1:32:26] struck a chord to me I went and started
[1:32:28] start looking at it and and you know it
[1:32:32] was some amazing about Muhammad Ali when
[1:32:35] he fought George Foreman you know in
[1:32:38] that in that by in that fight you
[1:32:41] realize that Muhammad Ali was a
[1:32:45] four-to-one underdog he was an underdog
[1:32:51] in that fight but but there was he
[1:32:56] realized he could not overpower George
[1:32:59] Foreman he had to outsmart him he had
[1:33:05] studied his opponent to the place he
[1:33:07] recognized in realism but he realized
[1:33:08] something that was very good that was
[1:33:10] very powerful for him because he
[1:33:11] realized this man ain't never went past
[1:33:13] six rounds of course everybody else
[1:33:16] looked at that and thought man they saw
[1:33:18] it and was afraid by it because George
[1:33:21] Foreman was undefeated he never went
[1:33:24] past six rounds because he hadn't
[1:33:25] knocked everybody else out by then but
[1:33:30] but Muhammad Ali began to realize he
[1:33:32] ain't used to going the distance
[1:33:35] so I all I gotta do is wear him out and
[1:33:41] outlast him
[1:33:44] and so you know the day come to the
[1:33:48] rumble in the jungle
[1:33:49] humming neighs you know here it comes
[1:33:51] they was gonna fight it out and here's
[1:33:53] it the great the great fight I mean you
[1:33:55] know at that time is one of the greatest
[1:33:56] sporting events has it ever happened and
[1:33:59] and they begin to fight and Holly just
[1:34:02] laid on the ropes and for six solid
[1:34:05] rounds he took punch after punch after
[1:34:08] punch after punch and he was late on
[1:34:11] them ropes and he went roll with the
[1:34:13] punches a man just took them licks and
[1:34:15] aiming Foreman was just beating him up I
[1:34:17] remember in that seventh round aiming
[1:34:20] there was all these even lay on the
[1:34:22] ropes and and Foreman was looking for
[1:34:24] that knockout punch because he began to
[1:34:26] realize I'm wearing down I got knocked
[1:34:29] this guy out I don't want to say going
[1:34:31] to the scorecards I need to knock this
[1:34:33] guy out
[1:34:34] so he ripped went up there and he got a
[1:34:36] good lick in on Holly amen and later on
[1:34:39] all the admitted it hurt real bad but at
[1:34:41] that time you know what he done he
[1:34:43] looked right at George Foreman he said
[1:34:45] George is that all you got is that the
[1:34:48] best you guys how you can do a mean look
[1:34:51] right straight I says that the best you
[1:34:53] can do
[1:34:53] amen and George Foreman lost the battle
[1:34:55] right there because he realized that he
[1:34:58] is the best I got
[1:35:00] that is all I got ami and Ollie when
[1:35:03] told to knock the guy out you know what
[1:35:06] he did he outlasted him hallelujah and I
[1:35:11] want to tell you this tonight
