[39:10] &gt;&gt; a move of God
[39:15] move.
[39:16] God.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just happy to be here.
[39:26] Again, our our family's been around, so
[39:28] we we know many of you and many of of
[39:30] you we may not know, but again, my name
[39:33] is Ben Shamal and I've got my family
[39:34] here with me. I just bring my amen
[39:37] corner with me.
[39:40] But if we come expecting,
[39:42] &gt;&gt; no matter who's preaching, I believe our
[39:45] God is still the same.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; So if you come expecting, if you come
[39:48] anticipating,
[39:50] then regardless of what your need is,
[39:52] regardless of how big it might be,
[39:55] &gt;&gt; our God has an answer for you.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that?
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Well, we just sure want to say thank you
[40:02] to all the musicians and brother Tim and
[40:04] Timothy, Brother Joe, and the church
[40:06] here for having us out. We just feel
[40:09] honored and privileged to be here. We've
[40:10] been to many, many of the youth camps
[40:12] and kind of grown up with a lot of the
[40:14] young people here. And it's just a
[40:16] privilege to be standing before you. And
[40:19] honestly, the way I think about it is if
[40:21] I could stand before kings of the world
[40:24] or I could stand in front of the bride
[40:26] of Jesus Christ, I would rather
[40:29] preach to this group of people
[40:32] &gt;&gt; than I would to Trump himself. I would
[40:36] rather preach to you guys here tonight
[40:38] than any king across the world.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; And that's just how I feel about it.
[40:44] Well, we want to just jump into the word
[40:45] and uh if you don't mind turning with me
[40:48] in your scriptures to Revelations
[40:49] chapter 19 and verse 7. We'd like to
[40:52] draw our text from here and see where
[40:54] the Lord would lead. Revelations
[40:58] chapter 19 and verse 7.
[41:04] We're going to try to not put God in a
[41:05] box here this evening and just let him
[41:09] have his will and have his way.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter 19 and verse 7. And
[41:18] then we'll have you seated.
[41:20] And the scripture says, "Let us be glad
[41:22] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[41:25] the marriage of the lamb is come and his
[41:28] wife hath made herself ready." Let's
[41:32] just bow our heads. Dear gracious
[41:33] heavenly father, Lord, we just come
[41:35] before you yet once more, Father. Lord,
[41:37] we're just thankful that we can gather
[41:38] ourselves together in this place and
[41:40] know that if we take you at your word,
[41:42] your word says that if there's two or
[41:43] three that are gathered together in your
[41:45] name, that you'll be here in our midst,
[41:47] Father. So, we're just clinging on to
[41:49] that scripture tonight, Father, and
[41:51] we're just going to claim that that
[41:53] you're going to be in our midst, Lord.
[41:54] So, whatever the needs are amongst your
[41:55] people, Father, we just ask that you
[41:57] would just minister to them. Help me to
[41:59] get myself out of the way, Father, that
[42:00] we might enter into the channel of the
[42:02] Holy Spirit. Lord, we just ask that you
[42:04] would just work in our lives, that you
[42:05] would just come down and speak to our
[42:07] situations, Lord. Any that are bound
[42:09] with chains, Father, we just ask that
[42:10] you would break them free tonight. We
[42:12] ask it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[42:15] Amen. And you may be seated.
[42:18] So, we would like to take an interesting
[42:20] uh subject if we could from this text of
[42:23] Esther,
[42:25] a type of the church. You may think,
[42:27] well, Esther's not found in Revelations
[42:30] 19:7, but she is because Esther is a
[42:34] type of the church. Now, I don't believe
[42:37] that the scriptures is just a book of
[42:40] dos and don'ts.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; But I believe that there is a lot more
[42:44] to the scripture than just a law of dos
[42:47] and don'ts. I don't believe that the
[42:48] scriptures is just a book of cute
[42:50] stories or or maybe of histories, but I
[42:53] believe that the power of God is wrapped
[42:56] up inside of the scriptures just waiting
[42:59] to be accepted by his bride.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that this evening?
[43:04] &gt;&gt; I believe that this is the opening of
[43:07] God's word to his bride.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; And it's been hidden in the scriptures
[43:12] all throughout time. And we are just now
[43:14] coming to the realization of the opening
[43:16] of the word by the opening of the seals
[43:18] through our prophet. So I don't believe
[43:20] that the book of Esther is just a
[43:22] romantic story. I know that we all we
[43:24] all been to Sunday school. We all heard
[43:26] plenty of sermons on the book of Esther.
[43:28] It's a very common story. But it's not
[43:30] just a little romantic story that we can
[43:32] get worked up about. But I believe that
[43:34] it is a perfect type of the church
[43:36] today.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; All right. We re realize that God hides
[43:41] himself in simplicity. and he'll reveal
[43:44] himself in the same.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon preaches a lot on
[43:48] Esther in the message, Marriage of the
[43:50] Lamb. He would say in one place he says,
[43:53] "Now, Israel was promised a promised
[43:55] land, but they had to fight for every
[43:58] inch of it." You see, wherever the souls
[44:00] of your foot tread upon, they have been
[44:03] given to you. God said to Joshua, it was
[44:06] all there. The land was there. God gave
[44:09] it to them,
[44:10] &gt;&gt; but they must fight for it. So, we can
[44:13] see promises in the scripture. And what
[44:14] I'm trying to get to you tonight is we
[44:16] can take the scripture. We can take the
[44:18] promises of God and we ourselves tonight
[44:21] can act on it. We don't have to wait for
[44:23] special meetings sometime. We don't have
[44:25] to wait for a for a youth camp. We don't
[44:27] have to wait for anything, you know,
[44:29] strange to happen in the church. But we
[44:31] can claim the promise of God tonight
[44:33] wherever you're standing in your
[44:35] situation. And you can claim the promise
[44:37] of God tonight. Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; We aren't basing our experience on
[44:41] emotion.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; And I praise God for that. We're not
[44:44] basing it on anything that we can work
[44:46] up.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; If we just worked up an emotion, we
[44:49] would be nothing more than the
[44:50] Pentecostal church. But we're looking to
[44:52] the revealing of God's word in this age.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; God himself expressing himself to you
[45:00] and through you.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. If God could be
[45:04] an expression to the world around, he
[45:07] would choose you.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Man, if we could only catch the
[45:10] revelation of that, if God wanted to
[45:12] express himself to the world around, it
[45:15] would look like Ben Shame. It would look
[45:17] like brother Joe Adams. It would look
[45:19] like,
[45:20] &gt;&gt; come on, church. If God could express
[45:23] himself to the world, he would look just
[45:26] like you.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; He would look just like your neighbor
[45:30] sitting right next to you. Because
[45:31] that's how God decided to express
[45:34] himself through man.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; What hands does God have but yours?
[45:40] &gt;&gt; What ears does God have but your ears?
[45:46] &gt;&gt; God chose to work through you, his
[45:48] bride.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; But you're going to have to fight for
[45:52] it.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; This is not just a rose, you know, bed
[45:55] of ease.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; This isn't going to be an easy walk. If
[46:00] somebody said, "Oh, you just got to
[46:02] surrender your life to the Lord." And
[46:03] it's going to be easy, brother, from
[46:04] here on out, man.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Well, you got one coming if that's what
[46:08] you think.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; This way is going to be a hard way. But
[46:12] we are going to receive our promised
[46:14] land.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; And when you identify a promise in the
[46:18] scriptures, you just latch on to that
[46:20] and you fight with it for every inch. It
[46:23] doesn't matter if you come against a
[46:24] wall of Jericho. You take the word of
[46:26] God and you continue forward.
[46:29] I love the story of Rahab and how those
[46:32] two spies came to her and you know what
[46:35] they knew that the power of Israel, the
[46:37] power of God was behind their words.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Realize what they told her. They said,
[46:43] "When we come to this city, you just
[46:45] throw out that scarlet thread.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; And when those trumpets sound, all the
[46:50] walls will fall but yours. You and your
[46:53] family will be safe."
[46:55] Now, I want to show you what they did
[46:56] not do is they didn't go grab the demo
[46:59] saw and
[47:03] &gt;&gt; get that demo saw going and cut a
[47:05] control joint down on either side of the
[47:07] the the the the wall there.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; They didn't have to do that because they
[47:11] had a greater power than a demo saw.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; They knew that when they spoke, the
[47:16] power of God was behind it and all the
[47:18] walls of Jericho were going to fall down
[47:21] except for that Rahab's house. Amen.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Because they knew that the word that
[47:27] they spoke was backed up by heaven.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm talking about a Holy Ghost fil
[47:32] believer here.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody that's been adopted into this
[47:35] me into this this word revealed word of
[47:38] the age.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a hard walk,
[47:42] &gt;&gt; but there is power in the walk.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; So, you don't have to cower down to the
[47:46] devil anymore.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; You know, the devil sure likes to talk
[47:49] you down, doesn't he? And who does he
[47:52] use? He'll use your voice to talk
[47:54] yourself down.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Now, we're not preaching psychology.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; We're preaching the word of God.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; But the devil will try to trick you up.
[48:01] He'll try to trip you up.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; He's the kind of friend that'll try to
[48:04] get you to do something against the law
[48:06] and then call the cops on you.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:08] &gt;&gt; He'll try to trick you into doing
[48:10] something and then he'll turn around and
[48:11] say, "Oh, look at what you did.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; You're such a bad Christian. Look at
[48:16] &gt;&gt; devil. You're the one trying to talk me
[48:18] into doing this.
[48:23] It's going to be a fight,
[48:27] &gt;&gt; but we have promises.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon goes on to say it's he
[48:30] said it's the same way about divine
[48:32] healing. Anybody need healing here
[48:34] tonight?
[48:35] &gt;&gt; I've got a little bit of bulldog faith
[48:37] tonight to say reach out and claim your
[48:39] promise and you'll be healed
[48:40] &gt;&gt; because there is power in the word of
[48:42] God.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; And what my scripture says is if there's
[48:44] two or three that are gathered here
[48:45] together in his name, he will be here in
[48:48] our midst. And I know one thing that
[48:50] Jesus doesn't show up anywhere without a
[48:52] purpose.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; When he showed up at the grave of
[48:55] Lazarus, he came for a purpose.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; People thought he was four days late,
[49:00] but when he stepped in front of that
[49:01] grave,
[49:03] &gt;&gt; he came with purpose.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; He didn't just come to cry and sob that
[49:07] his friend Lazarus had died. But where
[49:09] Jesus is, there also is life. So if
[49:13] Jesus is in the building tonight, then
[49:15] you can reach out and grab hold of that
[49:17] life and apply it to your situation.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; I just believe it just like the Bible
[49:22] says it.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; But it's the same way about divine
[49:25] healing. He says God has an amazing
[49:28] grace to save you and he will do it. But
[49:30] you'll have to fight every inch of the
[49:33] way.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; You must fight if we must reign. He
[49:38] says,
[49:39] &gt;&gt; "So we fight.
[49:41] We find out that the bride has to make
[49:43] herself ready. Be willing to lay aside
[49:46] every weight that so easily besets us
[49:49] that we might run the race with patience
[49:52] that's set before us.
[49:55] We must lay them aside ourselves. We
[49:58] can't say, "Oh, God, you come and you
[50:00] lay hands, you you lay them aside for
[50:02] us." We just got to do that ourselves.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; There is a work for us to do.
[50:12] God's not going to try to force you into
[50:13] a pipe and pull you out the other side,
[50:14] Brother Brandham said, and then call you
[50:16] an overcomer,
[50:18] &gt;&gt; but God rather is going to give you a
[50:20] situation that looks too high for you to
[50:23] overcome and then give you the power to
[50:26] overcome it.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; But you have to make the decision
[50:29] yourself to overcome.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; You have to go against the devil
[50:34] fighting every inch.
[50:36] not going to be easy,
[50:38] &gt;&gt; but we have a promise
[50:39] &gt;&gt; that we are going to overcome. And if
[50:41] the scripture says that there will be an
[50:42] overcomer,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; then I'm going to say that somebody is
[50:47] going to fulfill that scripture.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; If there's going to be a powerful
[50:50] church, then somebody has to fill that
[50:53] scripture.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; And I say, why won't it be me? Why can't
[50:56] it be us here tonight?
[50:58] &gt;&gt; I believe that God is the same. In
[50:59] Hebrews 13:8, it says that he is the
[51:01] same yesterday, today, and forever. So
[51:04] let's just prove God that he's the same
[51:06] today
[51:07] &gt;&gt; as he was back then.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; But we see in this story of Esther,
[51:15] her parents had died. She grew up an
[51:18] orphan.
[51:20] And Queen Vashy, of course, she doesn't
[51:22] come to the king's call.
[51:25] So she gets kicked out of the kingdom
[51:27] and the king starts looking for a new
[51:29] bride
[51:30] and she gets brought in. And I thought
[51:32] it was interesting as I was reading this
[51:33] the last couple days is that the king
[51:36] had seven chamberlins.
[51:39] Interesting.
[51:41] There's, you see, God won't let you
[51:44] starve.
[51:45] God, we've we've been reading this Bible
[51:48] over and over and over for seven church
[51:50] ages.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; But God's going to like like Ruth,
[51:54] right, and Boaz, he's going to drop a
[51:56] little extra here.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Drop a little extra there.
[52:03] And so Esther finds one of those
[52:06] servants of the king
[52:09] &gt;&gt; and he begins to tend to her more than
[52:12] any of the others. Why?
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Because there was something different
[52:16] about Esther.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; You see, they had gathered up maybe even
[52:19] thousands of young women to come into
[52:21] the king
[52:23] &gt;&gt; all over different countries, different
[52:25] races, different all kinds of different
[52:28] women. But there was something about
[52:30] Esther. You see, while all of those
[52:33] other women were getting their earrings
[52:35] on and making their makeup just right
[52:37] and trying to dress just perfect, what
[52:39] was Esther doing?
[52:42] &gt;&gt; She identified that the servant of God
[52:45] or servant of the king?
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Jumping ahead of myself a little here.
[52:52] She identified that the servant of the
[52:53] king would know a lot about the king.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; If he's a chamberlain, then he must know
[53:00] the secrets of the king.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Let's put on our thinking
[53:04] caps here.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; But one of these seven chamberlins
[53:06] starts revealing to her the mind of the
[53:09] king.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Well, this is what he
[53:13] likes.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; He likes you to dress a certain certain
[53:16] way."
[53:18] You know, he could have told all those
[53:19] other women the same exact thing and
[53:21] they wouldn't have done what the
[53:22] Chamberlain said because they said, "I
[53:24] don't think I look that good in that
[53:26] long dress.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; I don't think I look that good with my
[53:29] long hair."
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel weird when I go play
[53:32] basketball and I don't have shorts on.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, boys, we got to preach over here,
[53:37] too.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; You see, but they were trying to find
[53:40] out what the king liked. We have to find
[53:43] out what our king likes. We have to lay
[53:46] aside every weight that so easily besets
[53:49] us. We have to lay aside all of these
[53:51] worldly things and we have to focus on
[53:53] what does the king want from us
[53:56] &gt;&gt; because it had nothing to do with
[53:57] Esther. My life has nothing to do with
[54:00] me and it's got all to do with him.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Your life has nothing to do with you and
[54:05] it's got all to do with Jesus Christ
[54:08] because it is a love affair. Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; And that's what Esther identified
[54:15] &gt;&gt; is the chamberlain is going to know the
[54:17] very secrets of the king.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Just like Isaac and Eleazar
[54:25] Rebecca, she says, "Ezer, tell me more.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; You can't give me enough of this
[54:31] message. I mean, you can't tell me about
[54:32] Isaac enough
[54:35] &gt;&gt; because I'm learning the very secrets
[54:38] &gt;&gt; of the king.
[54:42] You see, our prophet came on the scene
[54:43] and he said, "You should be able to talk
[54:45] with somebody for about two minutes and
[54:47] be able to identify if they have the
[54:48] Holy Ghost."
[54:52] &gt;&gt; What is he telling us? He's saying this
[54:54] message has now unlocked
[54:57] &gt;&gt; the very nature of God
[55:00] &gt;&gt; to the bride
[55:01] &gt;&gt; because now you can identify it. You can
[55:04] identify the nature of God in someone
[55:06] else.
[55:09] Brother, if I was a preacher like
[55:10] brother Joe, I'd be jumping down these I
[55:13] might I might hurdle this banister,
[55:14] brother.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; We have access
[55:19] &gt;&gt; to be able to recognize the very nature
[55:23] of God. And that's how brother Brandham
[55:25] could get so worked up about a bubbling
[55:27] spring.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; That's how he could get so worked up
[55:29] about looking at the sunrise. That's how
[55:32] he could get so worked up about the tree
[55:34] in the fall. It would turn leaves and it
[55:35] would fall down because he saw the very
[55:38] nature of God living in nature and
[55:40] living in himself and living in the
[55:42] bride of Jesus Christ.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; It had now unlocked the very nature of
[55:46] God to the bride. And it is hidden to
[55:49] all of the unbelievers. They cannot see
[55:51] it.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; You know, this rapture that they've been
[55:55] talking about, they've been probing and
[55:57] probing and probing
[55:58] &gt;&gt; and they have no idea what they're
[56:00] talking about.
[56:01] They think they're smart, but they miss
[56:03] it every time. And it's because they
[56:06] keep probing at the word of God, and
[56:08] they have no authority to do so. They're
[56:10] pursuing
[56:11] &gt;&gt; because they are ignoring what the
[56:13] Chamberlain says about the secrets of
[56:16] God.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Let me just preach to you this tonight.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; We can no longer discard
[56:24] the secrets of the king.
[56:30] We cannot discard them.
[56:33] So if brother Brandham says that God
[56:34] likes you to have long hair, sisters,
[56:37] &gt;&gt; why does it matter what you look like
[56:39] after that?
[56:41] &gt;&gt; As long as the king likes it.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Are you trying to please all the
[56:45] peasants that are out there that the
[56:47] king is over?
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Or are you trying to please the king
[56:50] himself?
[56:55] Boy, we could go a lot of different ways
[56:56] here,
[56:57] &gt;&gt; but we must line ourselves up with the
[56:59] scripture.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Regardless of how I feel, regardless of
[57:03] what I think,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; regardless of how I believe, it must
[57:07] line up with the scripture. It must line
[57:09] up with the message.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; I believe, let me just tell you what I
[57:15] believe. I believe Brother Brandham was
[57:17] a very special person.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; I believe Brother Brandham was a
[57:20] prophet. I believe he was the seventh
[57:21] age messenger.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that the Holy Ghost was
[57:25] with us for six and a half church ages.
[57:28] But I do believe that the Holy Ghost is
[57:30] going to be with us throughout the
[57:31] entirety of the seven church ages.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't leave us when
[57:35] brother Brandham went into the ground.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost has continued.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't go into the ground
[57:42] with brother Brandham, but the Holy
[57:44] Ghost continued and is living in you and
[57:46] I.
[57:47] So the same authority that brother
[57:49] Brandham had
[57:50] &gt;&gt; can be behind you
[57:53] &gt;&gt; because we serve the same God.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; All right. Hopefully that's okay.
[58:01] But she was not looking after another
[58:02] man.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; She was not falling in love with the
[58:06] chamberlain asking him what he liked.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; She was asking what the king liked.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; She would ask him, "How would you want
[58:15] me to dress? Would you want me to have
[58:18] makeup on? I don't believe that Esther
[58:20] had any makeup on.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; I don't believe she had any earrings on.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Might as well preach on tattoos, too.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; There's people in church that think it's
[58:30] okay to go get tattoos. And there's only
[58:32] one scripture on tattoos.
[58:35] But you believe Brother Brandham when he
[58:37] preaches against makeup, and that's a
[58:39] temporary thing.
[58:41] Then you're going to go scar your body
[58:43] with an in Oh, anyways, I better get off
[58:45] there.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "This church of
[58:53] the Pentecostal move ought to be so
[58:55] bound up together with the power of
[58:57] Almighty God until the very life of
[59:01] Jesus Christ would be reflected in it."
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be such a testimony that
[59:08] you're walking down the street and
[59:09] people say,
[59:10] I kind of wonder
[59:13] if he is Jesus Christ incarnate.
[59:16] Not the fullness now. I'm not talking
[59:18] about that. But if you could make Christ
[59:21] so real to people
[59:24] &gt;&gt; that they might wonder.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; That's how close brother Brandham was.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; People would do that to him. They would
[59:31] say, "Oh, I I think that brother
[59:33] Brandham is Jesus Christ." He wasn't. He
[59:35] was a prophet,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; but he had a portion of that Holy Spirit
[59:37] living inside of him.
[59:39] and so can every believer.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; This this message isn't just for brother
[59:45] Brandham.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; This message is so much more than God
[59:47] send a prophet.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; This message is so much more than you
[59:50] got to believe this way or you got to
[59:51] dress this way or you got to act this
[59:52] certain way or you got to come to work
[59:54] on or come to church on Sundays and
[59:56] Wednesdays.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; No, no, no.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; This message is the unveiling of God
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; personally to you.
[1:00:06] This message is that that that that uh
[1:00:09] curtain being rent into
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; so you can now enter into communion with
[1:00:13] Jesus Christ.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; So the king's servant had equipped us
[1:00:22] with the things to get us ready.
[1:00:25] Brother Brandham says, "Oh, so many
[1:00:26] times we say, if the Lord would just
[1:00:28] take this evil spirit from me, this
[1:00:30] drinking or gambling or lying or
[1:00:31] stealing, I'll serve him."
[1:00:35] It's a trick from the devil.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; He's trying to get you to be perfect
[1:00:39] before you'll start serving God. That's
[1:00:41] not how it works.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; When you're in your lowest state,
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; that's when God can do his moving. When
[1:00:49] you feel as weak as you've ever felt
[1:00:51] weak,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; that's when God can move on the scene.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; God didn't come to the to the to the
[1:00:58] righteous,
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; but he came to the sinners,
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; But even if we could achieve
[1:01:04] righteousness, which we can't, but let's
[1:01:06] say we could achieve righteousness,
[1:01:09] we we could be the perfect man. The
[1:01:12] scripture says that our righteousness is
[1:01:14] as filthy rags. So even then we could
[1:01:16] not rely on our own righteousness.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; We're completely relying on him.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "But that's up to you." See,
[1:01:25] there's something that you have to do.
[1:01:27] There's a part for you to play.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And so many times people are so worried
[1:01:33] about getting in the flesh. If I could
[1:01:35] just preach here a minute. People get so
[1:01:37] worried about being in the flesh that
[1:01:39] they hinder the moving of God.
[1:01:44] But I have sure seen the other side of
[1:01:46] it where people get in the flesh and sit
[1:01:47] there on the like a bump on the log and
[1:01:49] resist the moving of the Lord.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; I would rather scream and shout and run
[1:01:53] the aisles
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; and be in the flesh than sit there like
[1:01:56] a bump on the log and hinder the moving
[1:01:58] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I would rather
[1:02:03] have a wildfire
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; than no fire at all."
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; But what we're doing is we're trying to
[1:02:07] paint a fire so it looks like we got a
[1:02:09] fire, but we don't really have a fire.
[1:02:12] That's what I'm afraid of with with with
[1:02:14] so many message churches these days is
[1:02:16] they've got a painted fire. They know
[1:02:17] exactly what to wear. They know exactly
[1:02:19] how to do their hair. They know the
[1:02:20] things to say. They know the things to
[1:02:21] do. But they don't have a fire down in
[1:02:23] their soul. They don't have anything
[1:02:25] pushing them like that brook that's
[1:02:27] bubbling up and making them share the
[1:02:29] gospel
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; that's making them talk to the people at
[1:02:32] school. That's making them talk to the
[1:02:34] people at work. That's bubbling out of
[1:02:36] them. Because this message is real.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; And this message is for a lot more
[1:02:41] people than we think it is.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; We hear it preached that the bride is so
[1:02:46] small sometimes. I think we get so
[1:02:47] selective in who we Well, we wouldn't
[1:02:49] want them in the bride.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to share with them the
[1:02:52] message.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Especially now with this whole Charlie
[1:02:58] Kirk thing going on. And boy, the devil
[1:02:59] is sly. This Charlie Kirk thing happens
[1:03:02] and it seems like there's revival going
[1:03:03] around and then, oh, the rapture's going
[1:03:05] to happen. Oh, isn't that a coincidence?
[1:03:08] And then it doesn't happen. So now
[1:03:10] they're all confused. That's just the
[1:03:11] devil.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; But we had a message come
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; that makes all it reveals all the
[1:03:17] mysteries of God.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you, church, the very
[1:03:23] things that the world is looking for,
[1:03:25] the bride has.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; The world is looking for joy,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; and they're trying to find happiness in
[1:03:31] all of these worldly things, but they
[1:03:32] have no pure joy. But you have pure joy
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; because we have the word of God.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Even what the devil wanted, you have.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me back that up.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; For 6,000 years, the devil has been
[1:03:54] clawing,
[1:03:56] grinding, working because he wanted to
[1:03:59] be equal with God. Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Since before the beginning, he was
[1:04:04] trying. He was made the angel above all
[1:04:05] angels.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; He was ahead of all the music.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be made equal with God.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; So, he's been working for all these
[1:04:14] thousands of years down through all of
[1:04:16] the ages trying to get to that spot. And
[1:04:20] then he's jealous like the 11th hour
[1:04:22] worker because here we come in at the
[1:04:24] seventh age.
[1:04:26] And my scripture says that we are now
[1:04:29] made joint hes with Jesus Christ. What
[1:04:32] does that mean? Brother Brandham said
[1:04:33] that everything that God was, he poured
[1:04:34] into his
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; church. Everything God was, he poured
[1:04:42] into Jesus Christ. Everything that Jesus
[1:04:44] Christ was, he poured into his church.
[1:04:46] Not just a building down the way, but in
[1:04:48] his church.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; So now you are made joint hes with Jesus
[1:04:52] Christ.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. which is the very thing the devil
[1:04:56] has been trying to get to over thousands
[1:04:58] and thousands of years. And then we
[1:05:00] wonder why the devil hates us so much.
[1:05:02] Because the very thing that you have,
[1:05:04] the joint air membership with Jesus
[1:05:07] Christ, Satan has been trying to get to
[1:05:09] this whole entire time. And here we come
[1:05:11] and we snatched it out of his hands. And
[1:05:13] he's jealous
[1:05:15] because we have power over the devil.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; We are joint hes with Jesus Christ.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah. I think that'd make a
[1:05:23] Methodist shout.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; That ought to certainly make a a message
[1:05:26] believer shout if we could just get that
[1:05:28] revelation
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; that the message has brought the
[1:05:32] unveiling of God to me personally, to
[1:05:35] you personally
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; that we can step on the head of this
[1:05:39] serpent.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, but you don't understand, brother
[1:05:42] Ben. I'm just such a a bad Christian.
[1:05:47] Well, let's say you're the the feet, the
[1:05:49] skin on the bottom of the feet, the
[1:05:51] bride of Jesus Christ's body. You know
[1:05:53] what the job of the skin on the bottom
[1:05:55] of the feet is?
[1:05:58] It's not to slap him in the face. That's
[1:06:00] the hand's job.
[1:06:02] It's not to pat somebody on the back.
[1:06:04] That's the hand's job. But the job of
[1:06:07] the foot
[1:06:10] is to go up to the devil and to stomp on
[1:06:13] his head.
[1:06:16] And that's the job that many of us have.
[1:06:19] And how do you identify that when you're
[1:06:21] in the dirtiest place that you've ever
[1:06:23] found yourself in?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Then you can turn to almighty God.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; And you can say, "Lord, I am nothing in
[1:06:30] my own, but I need you to come.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Give me power over the enemy in the name
[1:06:35] of Jesus Christ." So many times we pray
[1:06:37] in the name of Jesus Christ and we have
[1:06:38] no idea what we're talking about.
[1:06:39] Brother Joe,
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about real power. Not
[1:06:43] talking about benny hinn power. I'm
[1:06:45] talking about real power of God.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Where you say in the name of Jesus
[1:06:51] Christ, brother Brandham came and
[1:06:52] preached ambassadors
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; where an ambassador is representing a
[1:06:56] country.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; He has all the power of a country behind
[1:06:59] him
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; and the power behind him
[1:07:06] will take hold of what he is speaking.
[1:07:09] So when we're praying and we say in the
[1:07:11] name of Jesus Christ, do you understand
[1:07:15] what you're saying?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, the King of
[1:07:20] Kings, the Lord of Lords, the healer of
[1:07:24] all healers,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; the chain breaker, the mighty deliverer
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. There is no
[1:07:32] other name. No other name.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; We sing it so often. You know, sometimes
[1:07:37] I think we hear such mighty preaching.
[1:07:38] And I've been in many, many, many
[1:07:40] meetings with brother Tim, Brother
[1:07:42] Timothy, Brother Joe, and all these
[1:07:43] great brothers. And we hear such great
[1:07:45] preaching so often that I think
[1:07:47] sometimes it just becomes normalized to
[1:07:50] us, and we become numb to the word of
[1:07:52] God. We become numb to the power of God.
[1:07:54] We become numb to the spoken word of God
[1:07:57] for our age.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; And we don't fully grasp what God is
[1:08:01] trying to get to us through the spoken
[1:08:03] word because we just come every Sunday,
[1:08:05] we come every Wednesday, and it just
[1:08:06] becomes normal to us. But if we can make
[1:08:08] it a personal revelation,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; oh man, I remember when it became a
[1:08:13] personal revelation to me, it changes
[1:08:15] who you are.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; You're not trying to change from the
[1:08:20] outside in. That's always a battle. And
[1:08:22] brother Brandham said, you're going to
[1:08:23] be the most miserable Christian
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; on the face of the planet, most
[1:08:26] miserable human being on the face of the
[1:08:28] planet if you're trying to change from
[1:08:29] the outside in. But if you're trying to
[1:08:30] change, if if if you get your soul
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; changed,
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; then you'll change from the inside out
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; and then you're just bear wool like that
[1:08:40] sheep.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; But there's a part that we have to play.
[1:08:44] And sometimes you don't feel up to it.
[1:08:47] Many times the part you have to play
[1:08:49] comes when you don't feel like a
[1:08:51] Christian.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you just feel low, that's
[1:08:55] when you need to reach out and praise
[1:08:57] him.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; We hear it all the time. And
[1:09:02] You just not reach up your hand and
[1:09:04] praise him.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? You're creating an
[1:09:07] atmosphere.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said that that that that
[1:09:10] the Christian has the power
[1:09:14] to go speak a world and go live on it.
[1:09:17] Now, he was talking about atmospheres
[1:09:19] and he was just saying that talking
[1:09:21] about well, if we were to refer to uh
[1:09:24] the Andaluvian world and the world we're
[1:09:26] in now and the one to come, he said it's
[1:09:28] not the earth that changes, but it's the
[1:09:31] atmospheres around it.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; So, if you want to go speak a world,
[1:09:35] brother Joe, and go live on it, then I
[1:09:37] say speak the word over your family.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Speak the word over your home.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Then speak the word over your situation.
[1:09:45] And then you'll create a new world to
[1:09:47] live on. Not some world out there by the
[1:09:49] moon. But it is a world right here that
[1:09:50] you're living in that you can speak the
[1:09:52] word and you can take authority over the
[1:09:54] devil and you can stomp on his head and
[1:09:56] say, "Devil, you have no place in my
[1:09:58] family. You have no place in my life.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; And I am creating a world through the
[1:10:03] atmosphere
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit to go live on."
[1:10:13] Brother says, And why Christ speak? He
[1:10:16] says, "I'm so glad that a man can so
[1:10:18] completely serve God until the devil
[1:10:21] don't know what to do with him."
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Just obeyed God so
[1:10:26] completely till the devil says, "Oh my,
[1:10:28] get away."
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I want I want that kind of power.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; I want to live so close to God
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; where the devil gets sick of me.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Where the devil just says, "Oh my
[1:10:41] goodness, here comes Ben Shamal. He's
[1:10:43] rolling out of bed in the morning.
[1:10:45] Run.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; We have the ability.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon goes on marriage of the
[1:11:02] lamb. He says, "And we know
[1:11:05] that those that are going to make up
[1:11:08] that bride is going to be his church.
[1:11:12] and they're going to appear before him
[1:11:14] without spot or wrinkle.
[1:11:17] And they have the material,
[1:11:20] listen close, on earth now to make
[1:11:24] themselves ready.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; If you notice, it said she has made
[1:11:30] herself ready.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; I need to read that again.
[1:11:39] They have the material on earth now to
[1:11:42] make themselves ready.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; The chamberlain, the servant of God, has
[1:11:49] now given you the material
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; that you need
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; to make yourself ready for a rapture.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for an eighth age
[1:12:00] messenger.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another message.
[1:12:03] We're not looking for another great
[1:12:05] preacher. But what we have been given is
[1:12:07] all that we need to make ourselves ready
[1:12:10] for that rapture.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; This word is enough.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; This word is enough to get you over your
[1:12:16] situation.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; This word is enough to get you broken
[1:12:19] from those chains.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; This word is enough.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I believe it
[1:12:27] anyways.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; This word is enough.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Continuing on with our story here.
[1:12:39] But Esther required nothing
[1:12:43] but what he the king's chamberlain the
[1:12:46] keeper of the women appointed.
[1:12:49] And then Esther comes to a a hazeris on
[1:12:52] the 10th month of the seventh year.
[1:12:59] Here's another drop for you. Revelation
[1:13:01] 10:7 Malachi 4:5. There you go.
[1:13:07] We're going to meet the king in the age
[1:13:11] of Revelations 10 7
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; and at the voice
[1:13:17] of the seventh angel
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; when he begins to sound.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; It's a Wednesday. I'll keep moving.
[1:13:28] So Morai goes on and he hears about
[1:13:31] these two that are going to try to
[1:13:33] assassinate the king and he turns them
[1:13:35] in and Esther hears about it. She tells
[1:13:37] the king
[1:13:42] nothing came of it. So many times we
[1:13:44] think our good work works should re we
[1:13:47] should receive a good reward for it.
[1:13:49] Sometimes things go unnoticed. You think
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; but God sees.
[1:13:59] So then
[1:14:01] Hmon is promoted.
[1:14:04] He's way up there. He's God of this evil
[1:14:07] age, maybe we'll say. And he goes
[1:14:10] strutting around. He goes, "You know
[1:14:12] what? I have made everyone bow. I walk
[1:14:16] through the streets and everyone bows."
[1:14:19] And maybe he's riding his horse on his
[1:14:21] high horse one day and he just sees an
[1:14:24] evening light tabernacle way out there
[1:14:28] and it just drives him nuts because
[1:14:31] everybody else is bowing. Brother Joe,
[1:14:33] you look out into the world, everybody's
[1:14:35] bowing. Pentecostal churches are bowing.
[1:14:37] The Baptist churches are bowing. The
[1:14:38] Catholic church is the mother of
[1:14:40] them all.
[1:14:42] Everybody is bowing to the pressures of
[1:14:44] Satan except
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; one.
[1:14:47] The bride of Jesus Christ will never
[1:14:48] bow.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, and it just burns and it grinds on
[1:14:53] Hmon. He just hates it so much. So he
[1:14:57] goes home and he complains to his wife.
[1:14:59] Brother Brandon say he goes back and
[1:15:00] starts complaining to Jezebel like devil
[1:15:03] in hell.
[1:15:05] He goes back to his wife and starts
[1:15:06] complaining and she says, "Oh, you you
[1:15:07] could fix that. You just need to go and
[1:15:10] build gallows 50 cubits high."
[1:15:13] Interesting. That's seven stories high.
[1:15:16] The devil wants to make you an example.
[1:15:18] He wants to hang you up out here so the
[1:15:20] whole world can see that you can't
[1:15:21] overcome.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; He wants to hang you up here so people
[1:15:24] think that this message is not enough.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; He wants to hang you up there so people
[1:15:28] think that oh that message is just a
[1:15:30] cult.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; I grew up in a youth group where there's
[1:15:33] very very very few if any outside of my
[1:15:36] family that are left in the message.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Satan wants to hang them up and say,
[1:15:40] "Hey, see
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; message obviously can't be right.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; They can't hold young people.
[1:15:46] I'm looking at young people
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; and I believe that there's going to be
[1:15:50] young people and old people
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; that are going to rise up
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; that aren't going to take this hanging
[1:15:55] from Haymon.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Better slow down here.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to build a foundation,
[1:16:01] Brother Joe.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; It drove him absolutely nuts.
[1:16:11] Do not be ashamed of this message.
[1:16:14] If everybody else is bowing, stand.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; If your neighbor bows, stand.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; If your wife bows, stand. If your family
[1:16:24] bows, stand. If your church bows, stand.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; So, he builds these gallows and the
[1:16:34] devil thought that he could get one over
[1:16:35] on them.
[1:16:38] But we flip over to Esther chapter 6. I
[1:16:41] want to read verses seven and nine. 7-9.
[1:16:43] And Hmon answered the king, "For the man
[1:16:45] whom the king delightth to honor," of
[1:16:47] course, the king's asking him, "What
[1:16:49] should be done to a man that the king
[1:16:51] would like to honor?"
[1:16:53] And he says, "Let a royal apparel be
[1:16:56] brought,
[1:16:58] which the king useth to wear, and the
[1:17:01] horse that the king rideth upon, and the
[1:17:03] crown royal which is set upon his head.
[1:17:06] And let this apparel and the horse be
[1:17:08] delivered into the hand of one of the
[1:17:09] king's most noble princes, that they may
[1:17:12] array the man with whom the king
[1:17:14] delightth to honor, and bring him on
[1:17:17] horseback through the street of the
[1:17:18] city, and proclaim before him, thus
[1:17:21] shall it be done to the man who the king
[1:17:22] delightth to honor.
[1:17:25] So he's promoting what he thought was
[1:17:27] himself.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't we do that sometimes? We just
[1:17:30] build it up and then just step in. I've
[1:17:32] done it. I hate it when that happens.
[1:17:36] But here's Hmon and he he he thinks all
[1:17:39] the all this glory is going to come unto
[1:17:41] me.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; All this majesty is going to come unto
[1:17:47] me. Isn't that how the devil works?
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, we've seen preachers go that way
[1:17:50] many times where they start preaching
[1:17:52] themselves instead of the message and it
[1:17:53] goes wrong.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; But I want you to to to notice something
[1:17:57] here. Here's where I wanted to get
[1:17:58] tonight. If you don't get anything else
[1:18:01] from what I'm saying tonight, get this.
[1:18:06] Are you ready?
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; At the opening of the book,
[1:18:13] the roles between Hmon and Mori were
[1:18:17] reversed.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; At the opening of the book, the roles
[1:18:24] between Hmon and Mori were reversed.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; I feel like running right now.
[1:18:36] Mori used to be a servant.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Mori was in the ash heap.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Mori had no prestige at all.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Hmon thought he had it all. Hmon was
[1:18:50] living next to the king. Hmon thought he
[1:18:52] was over the entire thing. Yeah.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; But at the opening of the word in this
[1:18:57] last age in the seventh church age, we
[1:18:59] listen to our chamberlain and we heard
[1:19:02] what the king wants. And at the opening
[1:19:04] of the word, the roles are reversed. The
[1:19:07] devil has no authority. The devil cannot
[1:19:10] overcome you because the roles have been
[1:19:12] reversed. And now you are no longer
[1:19:15] getting stomped on by the enemy. But now
[1:19:18] you can stomp on the head of the enemy
[1:19:22] because now we have the opening of the
[1:19:25] word. It is no longer a closed book, but
[1:19:29] your name has been revealed.
[1:19:33] The seven seals have been revealed.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Your name is in the book. Your name was
[1:19:39] in the book the entire time. And Mori
[1:19:41] never knew it. He didn't know where he
[1:19:44] should be living.
[1:19:46] Come on.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; But the example that devil wanted to
[1:19:50] make of the of the believer and hang him
[1:19:52] up on the gallows now turned around on
[1:19:54] him.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; You can throw anything devil at this
[1:19:58] bride and we shall overcome
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; because we have a promise that's written
[1:20:04] in scripture that there shall be an
[1:20:06] overcomer.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; And if there's going to be an overcomer,
[1:20:10] then that's going to be me. That's going
[1:20:11] to be you. That's going to be the body
[1:20:13] of Jesus Christ that is overcoming in
[1:20:16] this last age. It may look dark. It may
[1:20:19] look hard. We may have to fight every
[1:20:21] inch of the way, but the roles have been
[1:20:23] reversed. We're not waiting for the
[1:20:25] rapture.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for the rapture for
[1:20:31] the roles to be reversed.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; But it has already opened up the word so
[1:20:38] the roles can be reversed tonight.
[1:20:41] So let me ask you, what is your
[1:20:43] situation?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; The devil has no hold on a believer.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, he can strap you down with chains.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; He can put you into a prison. He can put
[1:20:54] you into the innermost prison like he
[1:20:55] did with Paul and Silas and Peter and
[1:20:58] all the disciples. Those chains will
[1:21:01] never hold you. Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; If physical chains cannot hold them,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; then spiritual chains will not hold us
[1:21:11] when we have the opening of the word.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach to you young people.
[1:21:16] You need to dig into this word.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; You need to realize for yourself
[1:21:20] preachers can get up here and we can
[1:21:22] scream and shout and we can preach with
[1:21:24] everything that's within us. But until
[1:21:26] you get the revelation that this is the
[1:21:28] opening of the word, it is Jesus Christ
[1:21:31] coming down into your flesh
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; and it is personally revealed to you,
[1:21:36] then it will do us no good.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; But at the opening of the word,
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; the roles were reversed.
[1:21:52] So the devil's eating some humble pie at
[1:21:54] an evening light church service.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; You know what? All those streets that
[1:22:05] Hmon had walked down riding his high
[1:22:08] horse,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; making everybody bow.
[1:22:14] Now he's walking back those same streets
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; saying there
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; he's an overcomer.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; They're wearing
[1:22:36] the king's crown.
[1:22:38] They're wearing the royal apparel.
[1:22:43] This is coming from Hmon's mouth now.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, devil don't like it.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Do you realize this is incredible? This
[1:22:53] is all in the book of Esther.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; We haven't even touched Genesis or
[1:22:56] Revelation yet.
[1:22:59] Hardly. I guess I opened with it.
[1:23:03] But Hmon is going down these streets
[1:23:05] going back and forth proclaiming the
[1:23:08] glory of the believer.
[1:23:11] The devil is trapped
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; into giving God the glory.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; He may make your situation look so
[1:23:20] uh impossible.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; I've seen situations where they're bad
[1:23:26] and people trust
[1:23:31] but they get worse
[1:23:34] and that trust begins to fade.
[1:23:37] But when that situation then looks
[1:23:39] impossible,
[1:23:41] brother Brandham said when the doctors
[1:23:42] have done all they can do, that's when
[1:23:43] the great physician can move
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; because we serve a living God. He's no
[1:23:49] dead god. He's not some trinket on the
[1:23:51] wall somewhere.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; He's not in a grave somewhere.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; We serve a living God.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; All right, let's move on.
[1:24:08] You know, sometimes I think we wait as a
[1:24:10] church.
[1:24:14] Maybe this is me. My experience when I
[1:24:16] was younger
[1:24:18] is so many times we get caught up in the
[1:24:20] emotion of preaching. We listen for
[1:24:22] buzzwords. Can I just say that like does
[1:24:23] that make sense?
[1:24:26] To rejoice or to to or to or or to shout
[1:24:28] or to rejoice.
[1:24:31] But if we could just take a moment as
[1:24:33] these brothers are preaching from here
[1:24:34] on out and really focus on what they're
[1:24:37] saying
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; and we can dissect their message, not
[1:24:43] just what they're saying word by word
[1:24:45] with buzzwords, but what they're what
[1:24:47] they're what they're saying
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; to where we can catch that very nature
[1:24:54] of God in the message
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; and then apply it to our lives.
[1:24:59] You better look out, devil.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said when the bride
[1:25:03] begins to recognize who she is,
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; that she's an invincible army.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that he can do to stop
[1:25:10] it.
[1:25:14] Pass my 45 minutes already, brother.
[1:25:17] All right, I'm going to try to wrap it
[1:25:18] up before too long.
[1:25:22] Let me tell you a story. Esther come
[1:25:24] Esther comes to the king. She says, "I
[1:25:26] have a request." and she asks to meet
[1:25:29] with him over dinner. But the the king
[1:25:31] said, "Ask in abundance up to half of
[1:25:34] the kingdom." So many times I think we
[1:25:36] can we could take a lesson from this
[1:25:38] that we try to limit God so much
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; because Esther only asked for and she
[1:25:43] had a purpose but she only asked for
[1:25:44] dinner.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; She had up to half the kingdom.
[1:25:49] So let me tell you a little story that I
[1:25:51] heard one time.
[1:25:53] This man from uh California
[1:25:56] flies over to Qar and he's teaching a
[1:25:59] king how to golf. Do you golf?
[1:26:04] I hope it's better than mine.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Oh boy.
[1:26:10] But he teaches this king to golf
[1:26:13] and the king says, "I'm so thankful for
[1:26:15] you teaching me how to golf and get into
[1:26:18] a handicap of whatever."
[1:26:22] He says, "What can I give you out of a a
[1:26:26] token of love or appreciation?"
[1:26:28] And the instructor said, "Well, I you
[1:26:31] know, I collect golf clubs. So, if you
[1:26:33] wanted to get me one, you know, I could,
[1:26:35] you know, I love golf clubs."
[1:26:38] He said, "Okay."
[1:26:41] So, the man flies back home and the
[1:26:42] whole time he's thinking, "I wonder what
[1:26:44] kind of club I'm going to get. Maybe
[1:26:46] it's a golden plated. I mean, this guy
[1:26:48] was rich. He's a king, right? Maybe he
[1:26:50] can get a golden putter.
[1:26:52] Maybe he'll get a chipper with diamonds
[1:26:55] up the handle.
[1:26:58] Who knows? He's thinking big."
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Well, this club never comes in for a
[1:27:04] long, long time. And then he gets a
[1:27:05] letter in the mail and it's like a big
[1:27:07] first class letter and he opens it up,
[1:27:10] brother Joe, and he goes, "What's this?"
[1:27:13] And he looks and it's a certificate and
[1:27:15] says, "You are now the proud owner of
[1:27:18] the most expensive golf club in
[1:27:20] California."
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; He was now the proud owner of the entire
[1:27:27] 18 holes
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; golf club in California.
[1:27:34] Why? Because kings think different.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Our king thinks different. Our king is
[1:27:43] not limited, brother, by our thinking.
[1:27:46] But when we go to ask for something, I'm
[1:27:49] telling you, bride of Jesus Christ, ask
[1:27:51] for big things because a golf club to
[1:27:54] our king is nothing.
[1:27:58] Ask up to half of the kingdom. Ask what
[1:28:01] do you have need of? Do you need a
[1:28:03] little putter or do you want an entire
[1:28:05] golf course? The clubhouse, it had all
[1:28:08] the sand pits included. It had all the
[1:28:10] ponds included. It had all the fish
[1:28:12] included. It had all of the golf clubs
[1:28:14] inside of the clubhouse included.
[1:28:18] If you need a promise for your family,
[1:28:21] ask.
[1:28:22] Ask big things.
[1:28:25] Cuz our king thinks different.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:30] Let's just stand.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; What do you have need of tonight?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; What's your situation? The rules have
[1:28:39] been reversed.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; What golf club do you want?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; You want a putter? You want a driver? Or
[1:28:46] do you want the one in California? Or
[1:28:47] you want the one in the Bahamas? Or you
[1:28:49] want the one in Qar?
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Ask little bride.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Because you and Jesus Christ are joint
[1:28:58] hes.
[1:29:00] Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, man.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; It's not an emotional workup. It's the
[1:29:06] opening of God's word for our age that
[1:29:09] can live inside of you.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Are you worthy? No one is worthy.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; But do you have the position? You have
[1:29:19] the position.
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe I could say it this way. Authority
[1:29:28] can be greater than power.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; If the Incredible Hulk is out there
[1:29:33] trying to stop a school bus at a
[1:29:34] four-way stop and the Incredible Hulk by
[1:29:38] his power stops that school bus
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; crunches the whole thing, destruction
[1:29:45] everywhere.
[1:29:46] But you let a little police officer
[1:29:48] about my size
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; with a little badge
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; stand up into the middle of that
[1:29:54] intersection
[1:29:55] and raise his hand.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; All the devils and pale I mean the big
[1:30:01] school bus is going to come to a
[1:30:04] screeching halt
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; because there's an authority.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; The police officer cannot stop a school
[1:30:13] bus.
[1:30:14] You cannot stop the devil.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; You're relying in the badge.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; You're relying in the authority that's
[1:30:22] been given to you as a son and daughter
[1:30:24] of God.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what we're saying?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; I know it's Wednesday night,
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; but I believe that there are overcomers
[1:30:34] at this church tonight.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know what your situation is. I
[1:30:39] don't know the majority of you,
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; but God knows.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; All we can do as ministers is try to to
[1:30:48] find the the will of the Lord.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; It takes God to speak to your heart.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; So maybe he's been try to to
[1:30:56] come here, little Esther.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe the king would like to spend a
[1:31:00] little time with you.
[1:31:03] Maybe he would like to give you
[1:31:04] something and all you got to do is ask.
[1:31:10] Let's just bow our heads.
[1:31:12] If there's anybody here that that needs
[1:31:14] just a just needs a touch from the Lord.
[1:31:18] [Music]
[1:31:20] Whatever the situation is, no matter how
[1:31:23] dirty you feel, no matter how low you
[1:31:26] feel, how no matter how much of a
[1:31:28] Christian you don't feel like,
[1:31:32] Jesus Christ never shows up
[1:31:35] without a purpose.
[1:31:38] And his purpose here tonight is to swing
[1:31:40] by your way and to touch your need.
[1:31:46] Don't pitchfork this to somebody else,
[1:31:48] but you just need to reach out and
[1:31:49] accept it. If you need healing, reach
[1:31:51] out, accept your healing.
[1:31:54] If you need chains broken,
[1:31:57] then it's time that we reach up like
[1:31:58] that little police officer and we begin
[1:32:01] to lift up our hands.
[1:32:03] We might as well begin to praise him.
[1:32:07] Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[1:32:09] just come before you tonight.
[1:32:11] Lord, I just ask that you would just
[1:32:12] take this broken up message, Lord, and
[1:32:14] that you would just take something good
[1:32:15] out of it.
[1:32:17] Father, we believe that we're in the
[1:32:18] bride's revival now. The bride's revival
[1:32:21] is not a uh an emotional workup. It's
[1:32:24] not a catchphrase, but Lord, we believe
[1:32:27] that the bride's revival is the opening
[1:32:29] of the word
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:33] and it being personally revealed to us.
[1:32:37] So Lord, we just ask that you would just
[1:32:39] be with each and every one that's here
[1:32:40] tonight.
[1:32:45] There's maybe grave situations, Father.
[1:32:48] We know that we can do nothing, but
[1:32:49] we're only relying on you.
[1:32:52] We just ask you to move now.
[1:32:55] Show yourself God to the people tonight.
[1:32:57] Father for your scripture says you're
[1:32:59] the same yesterday, today,
[1:33:02] and forever.
[1:33:06] We thank you for it in the name of Jesus
[1:33:09] Christ.
[1:33:10] Amen.
[1:33:12] Say, sing something softly here.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; I just want to open it up. If you if you
[1:33:17] need prayer,
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; maybe we can open it up. It's a
[1:33:21] Wednesday night, but I don't believe
[1:33:23] that you have to come up to the altar. I
[1:33:26] believe the altar's in your heart.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; If you're backsliden or you find
[1:33:30] yourself stale with the word of God,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; let's make that right tonight.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; We need to live like the rapture could
[1:33:39] happen at any time.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; We got to live every day like the
[1:33:46] rapture is coming.
[1:33:49] We don't have to bow down to the devil
[1:33:51] any longer.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; I don't care what he's been telling you.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; The rules
[1:33:58] have been reversed. God bless you.
[1:34:04] Feels like you're running
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:12] and you will never win.
[1:34:17] But I don't know who told you you could
[1:34:22] not make it.
[1:34:25] I don't know who told you. You could not
[1:34:30] take it.
[1:34:33] I don't know who told you. It's time
[1:34:37] that you quit.
[1:34:40] Oh, my God says wait. It ain't over yet.
[1:34:48] Somebody here
[1:34:52] oh needs an answer
[1:34:57] to the question
[1:35:00] fears and the lies.
[1:35:03] Oh somebody.
[1:35:06] Oh if you're desperate for freedom
[1:35:08] tonight you need prayer you're welcome
[1:35:10] to come forth. Just want to lift your
[1:35:12] hand to the Lord. Say come by my way.
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:17] Oh,
[1:35:19] it feels like
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; you've wasted so much time.
[1:35:29] You want to move ahead, but you're still
[1:35:32] last in line.
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:36] Feels like you're running will never
[1:35:41] end.
[1:35:44] And you will never win.
[1:35:49] But I don't know who told you. You could
[1:35:54] not make it.
[1:35:57] I don't know who told you. You could not
[1:36:02] take it.
[1:36:04] I don't know who told. Oh, it's time
[1:36:08] that you quit
[1:36:11] in my God said way.
[1:36:14] [Music]
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Say,
[1:36:19] I don't know who told you
[1:36:24] you could not make it.
[1:36:27] I don't know who told you. You could not
[1:36:32] take it.
[1:36:36] Oh, it's time that you quit.
[1:36:41] My God says wait. It ain't over yet.
[1:36:49] It ain't over till God says it's over.
[1:36:55] And God will says that this
[1:37:00] it ain't over yet.
[1:37:04] It ain't over
[1:37:07] till God says it's over. And what says
[1:37:12] the missing?
[1:37:15] It ain't. So hold on.
[1:37:19] Hold on till I will say it's over.
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:29] Oh, it ain't
[1:37:34] just hold on till I say it's over and I
[1:37:41] will say that this thing.
[1:37:45] It ain't. Yes.
[1:37:48] I don't know who told you you could not
[1:37:53] make it.
[1:37:56] I don't know who told you you could not
[1:38:01] take it.
[1:38:06] Oh, it's time that you quit.
[1:38:10] But my God says, "Wait,
[1:38:13] it ain't over yet."
[1:38:19] Jesus blinded all my darkness.
[1:38:25] He touched my heart within
[1:38:29] his grace and mercy lit a passion.
[1:38:34] Consume my sin
[1:38:38] now like a city on earth.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you shine through the night?
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a lamp for his glory. Oh, can
[1:38:52] you proclaim tonight? I will not.
[1:38:58] And I've been touched by your fire.
[1:39:04] So let the world come and watch me burn.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, shout it from the rooftop
[1:39:17] and shouting.
[1:39:20] No one can serve.
[1:39:24] His love will never be.

[1:42:28] twist the situation,
