in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you amen thank you very much god bless you appreciate the music this morning those of you that has come out and and supporting us here in this time we so appreciate you being here Wednesday night we heard a masterpiece from the Word of God and brother Timothy ministered and he said felt like he was preaching to a thousand and so come to find out I think there were over over a thousand people that was joining us and listening and so we we know then that God was speaking the hearts and we really appreciated the anointing which we experienced in fountain pray that you'll feel that same anointing this morning Amen now I'm no stranger to small crowds I started off preaching to 12 so you know it's not a it's not a big problem there but I'm actually not speaking to a small crowd I'm greeting those right now who then it's who's meeting together this evening they're quarantined in India and not being able to have meetings over in South Africa they can meet with 50mm or less and so some of them have had service so we greet brother Kalin there and they did different brothers different ones that will be listening in from different parts of South Africa also from Africa down in Ghana those would be listening there over in Europe that are joining us right now from a different parts over in New York where that pastor wrote me yesterday and he was in in tears because they weren't able to have church today up in Canada different places wherever you are any place in the United States we're just happy for you to join with us today so we we greet you in the name of the Lord and we want you to know is a local congregation that we love you and that we're praying for you we're asking God to be with you during this time and if you need anything for us from us you know cause and because we're right there for you so we really appreciate each one of you we've got some things on our hearts that we're going to be speaking on today and we will read from Daniel chapter 12 and verse 1 even if you're gathered in a in your home today I pray that you'll just make this a real serious time and a holy gathering and that you at this moment in time will stand with us now as we read the word from Daniel chapter 12 and verse 1 it's been a scripture that has been a theme on my heart in the last little bet we've read it several times but we have another scripture to read again that we'll read in Revelation 12 also but the scripture said and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and that and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased and then with me turn with me to Revelation chapter 12 and we'll read from the seventh verse and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him amen may God bless you you can be seated we're living in a time of a great trouble of course it's not the the tribulation the Great Tribulation but nevertheless I believe that we're so close to it right now that we're seeing the looming clouds of tribulations it's like a storm that's brewing in the distance and we can hear the rolling of the Thunder we can see the lightning flash in the distance and it's not here yet but it's coming I'm instan Wednesday night about what if our youth camp or our services of the past were just fond memories and I tell you in my heart I believe that we will fellowship again I believe that the things will again come back to somewhat normal again perhaps this is merely a dress rehearsal for what is coming and but I just wanted to say if you're all shook up and uncertain about where you are where you are in Christ and where you stand in Christ it's past time that you find an anchor a man you've got to have an anchor that doesn't depend on others to keep you in the faith a man if it's if this is shaking your faith well it's important you get the token while you can for there will come a time where the Holy Ghost will be gone with the Gentile bride and you know I was thinking about the other day about the services and and the blessing that we had and given having this building that God gave us and everything has been that free and paid for and we thank God for that and I was thinking about it you know God didn't give us this for it to sit empty but then again I thought yeah he did because I plan to leave here hey man I plan for one day for it to be empty I just hope nobody none of you are here amen but you have left to one day perhaps it will be nothing but a stark a sign or emblem of a people that has left that went somewhere mysteriously but I believe that there's going to be a catching away for the bride of Jesus Christ now as things have gone over the last few years or months rather it seems like years time is just drug in those last few days and and you know with where it seemed like everything is came down to a very small space almost but in these times there's been floods I would say floods and quotes passed around about viruses and plagues and everybody is searching for answers and this this is a great need I think as we are looking at times like this we we want to see where we're at and what is promised for this hour and for this time and what can we look for and you know what is true and what is it true and what applies and what doesn't apply and and so today I'm going to be talking about speaking about enforcing our abstract of title or you know how to apply the token in the situation our abstract and so there but you know with these great needs in mind I can't help but go back a couple of weeks ago that I woke up during the night with a with a certain a sudden start with a very clear mind you know how it is many times you wake up to 3:00 in the morning and you're you're foggy minded but it wasn't like that it was really like I was very very clear in my thinking and I was thinking about the the trumpets and going over them in my mind and the seven trumpets in the book of Revelation and and you know it was just going over different aspects from the seven trumpets around Jericho and when the walls came down the Riis going blowing this seven trumpets there and and just going over different aspects of the trumpets and then a few nights later it would be probably five or six nights later and had dreamed that I was being asked to teach on the trumpets to some new people they seemed like new people but I realize that this new to many that this is new rather to many of not most of the message people that because there's been a lot of misunderstandings down through time and listening to the message and sometimes some people are just now understanding the message and others have misunderstood so I believe this has to be taught and so today it may be a little bit of a difficult subject and maybe a little treacherous and some points but I think with many believers looking for answer during this time of shakin in the world that and many quotes that are being shared I thought that I would speak about some things because how can we enforce our display unless we know what we have or what portion is ours to manifest our display so we don't want to be trying to enforce our bring to pass something that does not pertain to us we won't we want to we want to stand with the word that does protect us so well do all the Bible pertain says no some other Bible proteins and speaks of the horror of the book of Revelation some of the Bible speaks about the 144,000 which is the Jews some of the Bible speaks of the foolish virgins some of the speed people speaks about the the unbelievers who will who will be lost and son and then there is portions of the word that is to the believer so in one sense us all to us but in the other sense there are portions that are especially designated to the bride for this in time so um this quote was just sent to me and I just wanted to use it as an example because this was spoke of as a prophecy and in brother Branham said this in 1954 which is actually before I was even born and he said what is cancer what is a tomb what what is a disease we'll deal on that for the next five minutes now what is it cancer what caused that thing let's take a cancer or anything you wished to take tubercular pneumonia whatever you wish to any disease diseases or germs and let me pass this home here quickly as our time is going listen did you know the Bible predicts that in the last days there be a germ warfare that diseases will break out upon the people and will fall out on everyone without the baptism of the Holy Spirit but with the angel or who had the charge over the plagues was given orders to touch no one on whom the mark was why how much kind of teachers have we got to be brethren in order to get the to get the church in order to be in that condition immune my arms are sore now from where the doctors have puts needles in try to inoculate me from yellow fever and so forth I told him I didn't need it but they wouldn't listen to me but I'll tell you what God's going to do God's got a serum and it's called the Holy Ghost and when that serum goes in it'll knock you late you hallelujah in the last days and he breaks off from there now the point I wanted to to get this the point made in this quote is that we have to believe for divine healing against diseases sickness and diseases will come but we got a remedy amen because God heals all diseases but we're not exempt from persecution such as happening in China and I ask you wherever you are to pray for the believers in time right now who are the Chinese government is using this virus and they clamped down upon the people to clamp down even harder and shut down all gatherings and all the home churches were that they were kind of meeting under the radar but it's now all been closed down and people are going to jail we have three of our brothers right now that are in prison because of you know somebody was found with the King James Version Bible and and they looked on their phone and getting researched and found a pastor and they got him in prison and others in prison and and it's a very very very serious thing because they see this as a foreign influence from from America and they're they're really clamping down on it and they they are under very serious consequences there are Iranian believers in Turkey that are they're trying to deport from there but and and it's really serious because they go back to Iran it's certain imprisonment and probably death so I ask for you to believe and pray for those believers there but I just want to say we're not exempt from sickness cancers viruses fevers but we do have a healer and just a reminder none of these diseases are from him every one of these diseases are demons and so what we're having is is an angelic war that is going on right now and it is causing sickness across the world but I want you to understand that this prophecy or this quote that we speak about I just read it refers to Bible prophecy the Bible predicts said in the last day that there be a germ warfare that diseases will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the Holy Spirit but with the angel who had charge of these plagues was given orders to touch no on whom the mark was now this is a prophecy but it doesn't happen in our day it happens in the Tribulation Period where the hundred and forty-four thousand are sealed now notice in Revelation 9 and four and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads so here again it was it was permitted to strike plagues were permitted to strike those who didn't have the seal again in Revelation 7 this is specifically to Israel I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom was given to hurt the earth and to the sea saying hurt not the seed neither or the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads and have heard the number of them that were sealed and there was sealed a hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel so you can see it is Israel that is being sealed it's not it's not the Gentiles the Gentiles of course are sealed with the Holy Ghost but this is this is a is something has happened particularly when God has poured out the plagues and so when he has pouring out the plagues these plagues are from God and when he does poured them out upon the earth to avenge the death of his servants and they the actions and the activities of the and and all the all the persecution that has been upon the Saints through the ages and God pours out the vials he's going to protect his people but I want you to understand that things such as this coronavirus are just signs of the end time they're not to be confused with the tribulation plagues and things will continue to get worse amen as the winds of change come and I don't doubt that that there are some things that are never be the same in 911 we gave up lots of freedoms here in America no doubt we'll do the same again as things are tightening they just gave up a lot of freedoms in China as things tighten down we're closer than ever to the coming of the Lord and I but I'm not sure that we even know how bad things will get you know I don't think any of us prediction or thought that we'd be speaking to ten or twelve people and video streaming to everybody else here now quarantine you know this changed so very quickly and so I just want to remind you you know if this if this um drug troubles you to the point that you're questioning your anchor go get anchored make your calling and election sure know where you're standing this hour a man because Daniel stood by himself and his day you can stand remember because you have the Holy Ghost in this hour so so we don't know how bad things will get but the reason I spoke the other day about our services becoming a fond memory was not to say this is permanent I I'm playing the happiest camp in 2021 you know if we're still here praise God I hope for our next campus in heaven amen but but I'll and I hope that that this will soon pass and we can meet together again as we once did but do you see it is a time of desperation as death goes through the land and it requires a deep sincerity you you must have it to bind the serpent amen and make sure that the blood is on your doorpost is the only thing that can rapture you out of here as things get worse because we will escape the things that are coming on the earth remember this and the hold is for your comfort Luke chapter 21 verse 32 take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with survives and in drunkenness and cares of this life so that day but when you underwear for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth and watching therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man so I want to remind you it is a time of Laodicea people's hearts are overcharged with survives into drunkenness and maybe this is a wake-up call for all of us to be in stop just for a minute and realize what's really really important you know as we have been busy about life and over charms with with the cares of this life and you know to the point it's overindulgence which is what survives and mean or drunkenness where is not just a little wine but we're just overtaken by it and the wine of Laodicea and thus the slothful Laodicean spirit is that to get idioms I'm guarantee you when you do get to come back to the house of God you'll appreciate and being able to come a man rather than saying it's just an option I can stay home today if I want to or who cares and be a because chalice say it not to offend anybody but just be a secular Christian or our secular Baptists about it I meant where it's just an option it'll mean something you say well hey this might be something important this might be something to value now and that when I come that I've come and put everything that I got into it I meant because this is the Bible said whoo that's a snare and I pay it this came just like a trap he just closed suddenly and then most of us wouldn't prepared for it you didn't have enough toilet paper you know people found themselves in the situations and they were unprepared but there is it's it's something that we should be prepared and man that we should be ready cuz we don't know the moment that things was quickly changed the rapture can take place just like that I know I know there are those that are say well certain things has got to be fulfilled I'm going to show you in the scripture today and by the message that that that some of those things you think it's going to be fulfilled or not even applying to the Bride of Christ but anyway I want to give you a consolation brother branham to use this text to preach the rapture from some twenty seven and he says the Lord is my light and my salvation remember this is rapture hour and this is a rapture scripture here's my light and my salvation we can't look for government's to save us we're looking to the Lord to save us whom shall I fear or shall I say what shall I fear or we can say whom shall I fear because this is a devil Jesus would call these these diseases demons and said thou devil come out of them the man or rather the woman that spirit of infirmity he would call them Devils so this is an angelic war so of whom so shall I fear the Lord he is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell love that don't you don't a host should encamp against me that's an army my my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me if this will not be company one thing I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and enquire in his temple during the time of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion that's his tent in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock so you know again we we want to just take consolation God's got this it's in his control and but you don't Kim but can we say though like some people take these quotes to indicate that if we really the whole ego seal that we won't get the virus you don't listen as believers we're not immune from sickness or death except spiritual death and you know we had we had Jacko who was a great man of faith he died of polio thirty-eight years old polio that he obtained in a prayer line William Branham died in the horrendous car accident Saints get cancer and other diseases as sinners did John the Baptist got his head cut off because of a drunken woman at a dance calamities happened to all mankind believers non-believers alike but for there to be plagues and only those with the seal of God will be protected that's for the tribulation when the plagues aren't caused by God under the ministry of Moses and Elijah and we need to understand that before the seals even brother to brother Brandon now I want you to listen carefully even to brother Branham the book was closed it had to be open to him you see before that he was one who proved that he crawled step allama scriptures he had a church view on the book of Revelation and even some other scriptures and this is what made the Bible become a new book to him when the seals were open and some of these quotes are no different from the ones that reverse to the white horse rider of the first seal be in Christ we'd never preached that we never sinned those quotes around Woodley then that that's that would be Christ the white horse rider of the book of Revelation we wouldn't send that around we wouldn't we read that we understand the seals corrected that right and so we know that when the revelation was given it wasn't Christ at all it was the Antichrist his brother branham said in the verse seal he said oh I would absolutely today I hope that people are spiritual well I would have had made horrible mistake hole not big bad been for about 12 o'clock today when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that I was writing down to say you see the seals were um a definite turning point a corner that was turned and brother branham's understanding and so must it be for us and I want to say so were the trumpets until the Viets of the trumpets but the random was still of the opinion the bride would go through a squeeze of persecution and see a great display of power and there are quotes on that and later the in the and the Feast of the trumpets there and thereafter he sees that the bride won't go through that time at all you see he clearly thought the trumpets was for us and it was his job to to reveal him he was making plans to preach him he was he had meetings that would be set up seven in a row where he'd take each one of the trumpets and explain them until God showed him different you see now that was a milestone or marker or injunction of time or a corner that was turned in his ministry and so there are many of these quotes and things that you have to judge according to the light that was given at that time because God showed clarity up on that now here's the supporting quote for that in the Feast of Trumpets he says oh don't you see where we're at don't you see why them trumpets and mean nothing to us they all sounded under our sixth seal you see why the Holy Spirit wouldn't let me speak it and the Heavenly Father knows for this Bible before me that's the truth didn't know till yesterday day before yesterday in my room there were he revealed it come to me and spoke to me and I come back and I said wife I got it now he just met me in there and told me and here it is honey see see it's perfectly in harmony old people without him get in quick it might be your last opportunity you'll ever be able to have you don't know what time he might come and the reason why he would say that is because scriptures that they were expecting still to be laying before them to be fulfilled had had already been realized now they're not even for us and we're raptured out of here before that time so now search this is very very crucial to understand in many of these quotes he said I didn't know to yesterday or the day before and everything so everything before mentioned about persecution and plagues must be and understood in the light of this prophetic understanding now this is no different than the white horse rider before the seals you you you know you you've got to place these things correctly like I said we want enforce we want to enforce our rights but you don't want to try to be making things happen that doesn't apply to us you you I want you to remember there are two Israel's you look at one another and say to Israel's there's a natural people and a spiritual people and man there's a natural seed of Abraham and a royal seed of Abraham and there are two groups and both of them are God's chosen people and the Jews have a natural land of what was once called Palestine and the bride has a spiritual land of the Holy Ghost and what God does with the Jews naturally he does with the church spiritually so what he's working with naturally what he's working with spiritually and the Israel for 2,000 years or nearly 2,000 years have been out of their homeland and they were dispersed and they wandered about out into other nations same with the church the spiritual application the the church was dispersed and wondered about not in that nations but in two denominations and the the seven trumpets call Israel back to their homeland and following the trumpets is the Day of Atonement now while at the likewise the seven gospel trumpets by seven churches messengers call the bride to the atonement so you see each one of them have their job one of them's a natural one of them the spiritual let's look at Leviticus 23:23 and we'll get this I think this is very very wonderful he says and live in it because 23:23 didn't the Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to the children of Israel saying in the seventh month on the first day of the month you shall have a Sabbath rest a memorial of blowing of trumpets a holy convocation let me stop right there a holy convocation that's a gathering holy gathering that's what that means it's interesting enough a gathering of eagles is called a convocation so where the carcass are gathered are the carcasses the eagles are gathered and man there's a holy convocation where the word is so now again he says in verse 25 years have do no customary work on it and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord notice this let's notice particularly this was in the seventh month so there was the Passover which would happen at the beginning of the year and then seven months later the feast of the trumpets and these seven months also represent to us are tied to us seven church ages so since Calvary there has been seven months or seven church Jesus and we are now here at the feast of the trumpets in a in a spiritual sense now it is a memorial notice what it says ye shall have a memorial of blowing of the trumpets Leviticus 23:23 a memorial of the blowing of trumpet now a memorial is to remind people of an event a past event that took place right so it's a memorial now the Bible didn't say what the event was but there was a vent where the trumpet blew loud and long for their above Mount Sinai at the sound of the blowing of the trumpet Moses spoke and God answered my Thunder and you you have to see this in the translations because our King James Version doesn't bring it in out exactly like that but other translations do so so it's bound to be there in the Hebrew because other theologians are bringing this out said is a he answered by back Thunder and so so you see the blowing of the trumpet was to bring Israel back to remembrance of when the word was given to the prophet Moses upon Mount Sinai and Moses spoke and God answered by Thunder when when the trumpet sounded so note the trumpet blows God speaks and his voice is like thunders you can find this in Exodus 19 and in the book of Revelation there are seven trumpets and seven thunders and all of them sound their voices and each are symbolic of something that God is doing on earth hey man so now the feast of the trumpets happened in the seventh month before the Day of Atonement now the day of atonement was when Israel the high priest would offer an atonement for the whole nation a man for all the people to be accepted now this seventh month was all it was a month of the last harvest or the harvest of harvest it would be the final harvest of the year remember there was a barley harvest set at Passover there was the wheat harvest at Pentecost and then the last feast of the year was the seventh month which happened in the fall of the year and three feasts on in that month in the seventh month was three feasts there was the Trumpets the Day of Atonement and the Feast of the Tabernacles now of course we believe of course that the same thing happens for us here in this last seventh age a man Daria's the the trumpet call back to the word a man there is the day of atonement not a new atonement but back to the original atonement and then the feasts of the tabernacle which we wear which is the Millennium so where we're coming right here at the end of the seventh age unsername the Millennium the Feast of the Tabernacles were that we will we will build houses and another will not inhabit because it be temporary during that thousand years so that's the Feast of Tabernacles was the feast of booths where they would take temporary little booths they would make of out of shrubs and and and brush and whatever and make a little tent and sleep outside during the Feast of the Tabernacles to remember their journey in through the wilderness and the millennial reign is the Feast of the Tabernacles where that we we will dwell live in houses and and when another will not inhabit and and so on like that and we long enjoy the works of our hands and we remember our journey ins here upon the earth as we live in temporary shelters because then it will be burned with fire and the new heavens and the new earth will come so you can see it lays up perfectly and and it all happens here at this last seventh month now the seven trumpets of Revelation they were to call Israel back to their homeland and to the atonement they rejected now this last days has been the calling out time remember this this is the calling out time brother Branham would place it he said there was the martyr time then there was a reformer time and now is the calling out time all right this is what he's satting pieces of the trumpets the martyr time we don't fulfill that hey man the reformer time we don't fool the well that the calling out time that's where we're we're fulfilling all right so he sells in the pieces of the trumpets pair up 331 231 now here is the calling out time at the sixth seal one opened the persecution struck the Jews in the literal standpoint here comes the persecution to the church in the ecclesiastical standpoint because the bride's already called the Sabbath's are over 1 because we're at the end of the Sabbath the seventh Church ages we're here as we've been explained in the seventh month all of the sevens are being fulfilled and ready for the Jews we call where to the feast of atonement Oh church don't you see that call to the feast of atonement what to recognize the atonement listen close not no more chickens and geese and what they've been doing but the Lamb of God slain before the foundation soil is Allah know that now remember this is the original atonement the Lamb of God a map so again this is what they are going to be pointed to no more chickens and geese he says when we can all say well it was never chicken and geese well it might as well been a member for they had no atonement since they rejected the atonement at Calvary since they had rejected God's lamb well they definitely have a temple they don't even have place to worship except their synagogues it's not is not work God told him to worship a man is not where the temple was and then they've not been able to offer a lamb they can't even they can't even do the the red heifer all of their all the things if they if it requires a blood sacrifice those people are lost in fact all the world is lost that don't accept a blood sacrifice and even those in the message today that say he's no longer the bloody sacrifice you're lost because without that bloody sacrifice you had no hope so you see he again no it wasn't chicken and geese but it might as well have been they they have had no atonement since they rejected the atonement at Calvary and for spiritual Israel the bride the piece of the trumpet represents to us you know something something you know the spiritual Israel it represents the seven gospel trumpets that had blown under the seven messengers calling the bride of every age to the atonement and when the seventh angel the last church aids messenger sounds his trumpet this gospel message on the last day of the feast then we come back to the original atonement the same Holy Ghost that was given at the beginning any man again some of this that has been offered for atonement it is not better than offering the chickens and geese you see it was it was not the Holy Ghost of leather the Covenant but rather man-made traditions of shaking hands with the preacher or joining church or some Roman ritual that's that's that's my offering chicken and geese hey man it's it means nothing it will not save you a man some Romans ritual or tradition will not save you a man even some of this sin is being offered this almost nice religion this this our religion without experience it will not say and it doesn't deliver and it's like an atonement of chicken and geese imagines we're not having a totally hey man but I tell you God has brought us back to the original atonement which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the blood of Jesus Christ coming in spirit form now brother Branham says hey pair up to 91 now is the same as the two prophets did remember that Gentile bride is to have a prophet called Elias Elijah that is to call them out of their traditions the bride just the same as these prophets call the Jews out of Judaism to Christ the atonement and the Gentiles already know the atonement but is called the bride back to the original atonement and what was the original I told me it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that came on the day of Pentecost that's where the blood was applied hey man the lamb was shed at Calvary his blood but it was applied at Pentecost and 120 were born of the blood of God are you with me so so again it brings the bride back to the original atonement so just as they have a prophet or two prophets to call them out of Jewish traditions back to the teratoma so God sent a prophet in this day to call us out of the tradition of the ideas of the church ages and bring us back to the original baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same power the same war times the same wondered that he did back there hallelujah so you see it is to call us back as Gentile people back to the true atonement by a prophet to a holy gathering to a convocation amen back to the word a call back to word to the word to remember the original word and the original atonement that was given not about Sinai but at Pentecost hallelujah because that's where the word came to be written in the heart was not there at Mount Sinai but here at Pentecost and this message brings us right back to the Pentecostal father's one more time hallelujah back to the original atonement a man the original word original atonement the trumpets are something that have been overlooked and hasn't been spoken about a lot but since we're in these trouble sometimes it's important to look some of these things over really good because whole sermons have been preached for years of a common squeeze and the bride's persecution and the belief that the power of the word is delayed until the squeeze comes but but don't we understand that it's this great junction of the Feast of the trumpets brother brother Branham tells us the pressure that comes upon the bride is not in a physical manner it's in an ecclesiastical manner now ecclesiastical manner means by preachers by doctrines of the church and that causes a squeeze on the people are you with me squeezing out what squeezing out the gifts of the Spirit squeezing out speaking in tongues squeezing out in banning divine healing discouraging prayer lines don't want altar calls anymore even worship don't want spiritual worship anymore you see and I want you to understand that's the please see a circle squeeze and my brother bottom makes it clear in the Feast of Trumpets that the bride receives her persecution in an ecclesiastical manner this is this whole thing you know where summer rose up against our worship and I praise unto the Lord it's nothing more than an ecclesiastical squeeze trying to pressure us not to have the movement of the Holy Ghost in our midst that God working among us are you with me man so you see this queasy obstacle squeeze banzi anointing it bands the gifts of the Spirit it discourages and prohibits speaking in tongues and divine healings and prayer lines and altar calls and worship and again I just say like I said last Sunday if this is the virus we need to be worried about because you don't just bring physic it's not just physical there's a spiritual death now the church talking about not the bride the church will go through a time of tribulation but not the bride let me share a few little quotations to support these in the tired church age page 228 so let me say right here then we have the very same thing going on right now people all come together they're right in the Bible that will suit everyone whether it be Jew or Catholic or Protestant and they have their own Nicean counsel but they call it the ecumenical council and do you know what and you know who all these organizations fight they fight the true Pentecostals I don't mean organization called Pentecostals I mean the ones who are Pentecostal because they're filled with the Holy Ghost and have the signs and gifts and in their myths because they walk in truth so notice what he says here these organizations are listen it's an ecclesiastical spirit see we've been looking for a long time for the ecumenical council to come in and close our churches and some are saying oh this is it this is it yes Nadia it's a virus it's the government giving a recommendation amens now they're not yet prohibited religion if they're just giving recommendations are you with me and so it's not physical but it's you see this this ekam you Camus you see that in your among all your people that your work with your associate everybody's at communica minded you can't say anything everything's got to be politically correct you know and you you dare not you you know if you you dare not stand for the word of God your just mental right you can't stand for truth you're judgmental you're immediately they kick you out you can't say anything about sin you can't say anything about you know what is wrong that bisexual is wrong and homosexual is wrong and this other other sentence or room can't say that no more what is that it's the squeeze and everybody is got to be accepted what is it it's the squeeze it's coming in an ecclesiastical manner trying to shut us down trying to shut your witness down your testimony down even what we preach from the pulpit down are you with me Amen they fight the true Pentecostals I don't mean the organizational call Pentecost I mean the ones are Pentecostal cuz they've been filled with the Holy Ghost and have signs and gifts in their myths because they walk in truth come on they're the same thing that is happening there just like they would take but the Star of David upon the upon the Jews and and they're the one and they made that a sign of disgust come on they're very very sign of their ancient heritage a King David and his kingdom they turned it have made it a sign of disgust distrust hate it brought them down to the death camps and that's what they want to do on you is pin on your label Pentecostal oh you're you're just a Pentecost let me well you know your your Pentecost cuz you shout well what about it if you don't chatter you Baptists and my or your Macedon so you Catholic what are you a man but but again you know it's it's it's like pitting on you a dirty name now the calling of Pentecost what we are to Pentecost hey man we're not the organisation Pentecost I mean the ones who are Pentecostal because they're filled with the Holy Ghost and they got signs and gifts in their myths because they walk in truth but you see some will protests but brother Tim we we just got to have this persecution in order to drive this together to bring on the power for the rapture you know we we we can we we gotta have rapture in faith and so you know listen listen to some of these quotes so this is pre that pre trumpets again brother Brandon said how we going to lose this great race this isn't a paradox 1964 April the 18th is because we're divided how we going to do it we're going to stay to get we got to stay together we're all believers in God the Holy Ghost takes us all in it'll be a paradox if God ever gets us together but he will just trust him that virgin birth he knows how to send the persecution that will run us together in a court trial again in April 64 brother Branham preached his Feast of Trumpets in July of 64 and you said this this is where I knew all the Pentecostals groups come together then it'll take a persecution to run you people together you'll never believe it but when that time comes well you don't that makes some assume well the Bobby change is an imminent then and it can't take place until we're persecuted and we gotta have the squeeze so we can do miracles and then brother will have will have power then and brother then we'll have rapture in faith and I want to just say to you we already got the power you have a seat power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you that's what gives you power not persecution amen you see we have the power the message has come and it's given us the faith for the rapture a man it struck up over claim that was against us and gave us the extract of title somebody with me right now a man so you see you see this message is rapture and faith it is what gives us the revelation for the rapture in it it illuminates the scriptures that pertain to us don't you see what I'm talking about I've often used this example and maybe this illustration will help somebody but there's some of you that were caught in marriage situations horrible situation some of you married to three times living with a man that wasn't you know your husband he's and he had two or three wives and so on like that and you were in horrible shape well how could you go in the rapture you know I mean you are you were in a mess but God through the open and those seals revealed to us that that has been forgiven don't go do it again well that gives that divorce cup of faith they can go in the rapture yep they're living together and they would have been living an adulterer but God gave him permission to live together and still go in the rapture you see rapture and faith lays in the message somebody with me a man so here again this is really important that we this gives us faith the message gives us faith for the rapture now I want to see and I want to say that persecution did run the true Pentecostals together this ecclesiastical persecution did drive true Pentecostals together we came out of denominations we fled into the land of the Holy Ghost where the word has preeminence and right here in this church right it evening like Tavenner we got Baptists and Methodists and Catholic and Pentecostals all those two Pentecostals that were out there in those denominations somebody listening to me a man who have escaped the concentration camps of organized religion where you were skin and bones and on condition and made to work in their organization for your salvation are you with me but you escaped and you have been pushed out of your former church homes just like the Jews were pushed out of Germany and Italy and their homeland for years and years and persecution ecclesiastical persecution because you couldn't hear the word preached there drove you out God forced you out of there they just got worse and worse and worse till you fled the third Exodus brother Branham says it this way in this prayer Heavenly Father we look we by faith will look toward the future I'm looking now by faith towards that coming something Lord upon the earth that's going to draw that people together we see the denominational churches so pitting down and getting so different it's it's really pushing the people out just like it was in Egypt but Pharaoh Rison who knew not Joseph as it was in Germany and up in the Russia and Italy and the people raised up doses and Hitler and Stalin and Mussolini who hated the Jews and they had to go back to their homeland God you got ways of doing things we don't understand you press them no home and Germany everything taken from them remember this is a natural Israel and also an Italy and Russia no place to go and they were sent back to their homeland just to fulfill the Word of God and man oh the lemon hand of God how sometimes it looks cruel the way that people suffer but still it's the tender hand of Jehovah Lina's children we thank you Lord now God as I see the day that denominations watts now that ecclesiastical spirit that denomination is pressing the believers excommunicating them saying that their name must be upon their book or their loss have nothing to do with the other group it's only the tender hand of Jehovah leading them to the tree of life I pray God that each one I know they will because it's your word it can't fail and made me led to the tree of life that we might be a possessor of eternal life and see the hand of God and by the eyes of faith look beyond these shadows that we're walking in today and see the promised land just ahead so you see it did I mean when you look at that it's gonna take persecution to drive us together it did it's already happened hey man it's already driven us to the word it's already driven us to our homeland it's already placed us in a position but for the Jews it took natural force for us it took an ecclesiastical force you wanted to hear this word Amen now in question answers number 1 in 64 brother branham's asks a question brother branham would the bride go through the persecution as an early up apostolic church didn't know I just explained that a few minutes ago no the next thing is a rapture now remember we're at the promised land we're at the border you understand the marks of Israel a man in the fifth seal explains and then there he explains on Petrov 433 and so on he said I was just thinking about how that John saw you know so that group he saw his brethren he saw the souls under the altar he saw the 144,000 he recognized all of them don't salute his brethren right and a man and this is his brother that had to suffer a little while he solved them there and he said him to think the Lord God permitted me to see my brethren and the Saints that were waiting for the coming of the Lord notice they're not under the altar of sacrifice man 1 but these was they were martyred mine wasn't under the martyrs altar so God chose brother Branham his group is not under the martyrs altar now that doesn't mean there won't be persecuted people here are persecuted there in this world we have persecution I'm not in the different foreign lands of different places or different laws and whatever and they they've been under persecution for years and years it's nothing new but understand that bride is a whole don't go through that time she is saying that she's not under the martyrs altar if I could just give some hope even to some Chinese people today a man there there's some hope right there to you that we're we're not part of the mountain the martyrs although some of you may be murdered but that's not what we're all called to be understand that a man so that gives you that gives you some hope it gives us hope that we won't go through the tribulation ahead where people give their lives this gospel but right now you give your life for this gospel you live your life for a man you can pour out of sacrifice and then you leave the things of the world you do what is right it's a sacrifice hey man some of you some of you are sitting back you know watching your brother's your sisters go through the sacrifice and the persecution and you you want to be exempt from it so you cut your hair and you paint your face and then you live like the world I want to say shame on you while others are dying for this truth or should I say living for this truth because that's what we're doing right now it's living for it amen in the Feast of the trumpets brother Branham said he said as soon as this church the bride is gathered together she'd be taken up in that mystery of this seventh seal or the seventh seal the mystery of going in the turret the Jews is called by the mystery of the seventh trumpet which is the two prophets Elijah and Moses and they come they come back and there's where the Pentecostals is all mixed up they're looking for something to happen and the church has done gone and that's to the Jews so you see some even a message are still Pentecostal or Church world religion in their thinking because they haven't turned the corner with the Prophet and man and they're all mixed up and they're preaching when we gotta go through persecution or we you know what's out where we're gonna be shut down and here comes the squeezin and this houses in an ecclesiastical manner brother Branham is asked for the bride before Jesus comes this is again question answer is 164 when the bride before Jesus comes will she raise have all the power the Holy Ghost performed miracles raise the dead and so as in the latter Ranger is the laddering for the hundred forty-four thousand years or well all ministers have this are we just waiting for they come in and he says yes then he says friends I'm not a theologian and I got to teach everything I know by the times and he said you can call me a typology he said if I see my shadow of my hand he said I can see you know I get a glimpse of what's coming and he said is God dealt with Abraham that's the way that God's gonna deal with the church excuse me so he said you look at the Stations of Abraham's life he comes like and he types it from Luther to wesley own down on down he said he confirmed the this to him to shed blood the villa Delphian age and then that was a bloody age the Wesleyan age and he said watch the Pentecostal age that he made the promise of el-shaddai I nursed from me and the question is can you nurse and he said that was brought before the Pentecostals and they grabbed for their abreast of denomination where they came out of but he said then the real seed that comes to nurse on the breast now what he's doing is typing it the Pentecostals with Hagar and Ishmael a wild seed because he go right back into denominations so he says you know they were offered the breasts of el-shaddai I they were offered the full promise of the word but instead they took the breasts of a denomination and took their evidence that the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues but then there comes a real seat which is Isaac who will nurse on the breasts now in other words who will take the word and he said what was the last sign before the promised son that they waited on all these years come back was God standing in the form of man could discern the thoughts of was in Sarah's heart Sarah being the church represent the church to represent and discerned the thoughts is in the church that was even behind him immediately after that she's changed to a young man our young woman in him a young man and Isaac was brought on the scene the promise I believe you are seeing the last thing that happened to the church before the rapture I believe it the rain is over in other words the final rain has come this message is the latter rain so people are looking for great power it's here hey man it's here it's I'll tell you most of time is untapped resources but it's because you let the doors accretes endowments Ian message churches bind the movement of the Holy Spirit and won't will any move and this is exactly where brother Branham 2nd ecclesiastical spirit bringing that persecution bath and the Holy Ghost bathe in tongues been in the gift better all three calls Banda the divine healing Bali now but we have received the final revival I'm just going to say it to you persecution won't bring it if persecution would have brought the raptured faith they would have had it in the Dark Ages a mountain soup but what will bring a message that turns the hearts of the children back to faith again back to believe it again and godly operas if we're not gonna believe them who is gonna believe somebody's gonna believe it somebody's gonna say it's true somebody's come kind of professing is they're all somebody's got to say we're gonna let the Holy Spirit move in its power we'll have every sign or Wonder will have healing will have miracles will have the Holy Ghost will have the power [Applause] somebody's gotta stand up to it cuz he said I'll have a bride and should be without spot or wrinkle so zone were declared you're gonna be here I can't help but be here because I have been prophesied to be here I've been chosen for this time and for this moment and so have you but we received the final revival they'll had a ring it's God back in blessing he it's the Holy Ghost back in his full power and God demonstrated what it would do it would heal the sick it would raise the dead it would cast out Devils it would heal cancers it was it would change lives forever it would shake up Leona seeing severe gunshot what it would do he showed it with a sign among us that he is here that I want you to remember those of you that are listening to me everywhere remember the Son of Man Jesus Christ is here among us he's never left us this because the Prophet left the scene doesn't mean he left God takes his man but he don't take his spirit his spirit is right here he's working in the church he's working on me he's working right in your home this morning as you lay hands on the seconds you believe the word is his biggest name it's God in the flesh of his people God in human flesh we son in a prophet he's got to be in Bride form it moves from from the south to the voice and the shout it was a brothers message but this phase of his coming is the bride coming she's the voice of the resurrection I'm the first one that raised from the dead after 2,000 years we come out of DOC denominationalism back to the full word again he said you notice the other day when we started him trumpets all his spirit said that don't belong here he sent in a latter rain 144,000 you know that isn't that's when the lives of Moses that's where that's where the miracles take place the things the people has been looking for for Pentecostal for miracles that'll take place that's under them see that's the lives of Moses they'll smite the earth with curses often as well they're closer heavens that it don't rain the days of their prophecy God will Fightin's stand and fight for them like he did he'll bring them out of their mighty hand just like he did in Egypt on these isms of the world he'll do that he'll stop the plagues among them like he did in Goshen hey man he doesn't stop all the plagues that comes here why because he expects you with faith to stand up and declare the Word of God and overcome it we're just a weight on the come to the Lord keep your lamps trimmed all filled with oil pray up every hour at not every day every hour keep ready be ready be sweet me watching and then he begins to answer sing that song we're watching for the coming of that glad millennial day when our Blessed Lord shall come and catch his waiting bride away no see Church this is what we're to look for we're to look and expect the coming of the Lord so it can happen yet you're wrong if it is happening I'm out they asked him again if standing in line to get in the church is going to be only a memory because brother Brendan said you know doing what you're doing now and trying to come in the church and stand in line one day folks this will just be a memory and they said it's just gonna be a memory what's going to happen if we're not going through the tribulation or we're gonna be seeing some suffering if we're not and he says look these people are wanted say thinking the church is going to hit the tribulation because but he said it won't cause it's already been redeemed he said now the church the nominal believers like lot he's going to go through the tribulation be saved as it was by fireman Noah went through the tribulation period carried above it and came out with ham loop there's again a lot came out his own daughter slept with him and had children by his own daughters but Abraham brought forth the royal sea broke foot the seed of the promise and Enoch went to glory and the rapture just took a walk and went home he never went through the tribulation period hallelujah and in mind anemic sir type the seventh from Adam those in the seventh church age you're gonna be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hey man me think wasn't persecuted so he can be changed he didn't have to go through persecution so he can be changed he walked with God so he can be changed and that's our duty keep your lamps trimmed stay steady don't don't don't get discouraged in this hour keep your eyes on the goal keep your eyes on Jesus otherwise those forms to take it but the church will go through the tribulation but not the bride and they then he said I don't pay and this is paragraph 232 and questions answers to now people say well what about the early Saints that was the change in the dispensation that was under persecution which of you here this church ages and to see they went out into darkness and having to do that it shows where they had to take that persecution because each of the church ages and everything began to show that went into darker and darker see the brides of that age did go through persecution so there what finally in complete place they denied his name picked up another name they lived or dead Sardis and they come on ties that tire of Sardis and came out came to let Philadelphia known well and so forth and then come to the car of the time of the calling out of the bride which was to escape all the damnation it's accounted worthy just gave all this damnation and wrath that should come upon the earth that you might be counted worthy to escape it not go through it escape it see do you understand now everybody so you again you know they there were a lot of tribulation they were the bride in the dark ages and they a tribulation was their allotment but we're not in the barter time these are we have the reformer time we're in the calling out time were the trumpet calls the gospel trumpet calls us back to the original atonement now hope you still got plenty time for dinner let's go on just a little more I want you to see and question answers number two he was asked where the foolish virgin be saved and he's now what happens happens now after that she's in the state and of course you know the state he doesn't finished it here but he this felt his filthy still he this Holies holy still now she will have to go through the tribulation and the reason of it is because she rejected the atonement in its fullness see they reject that took shaken hands I believe on Christ this is a sacrifice but they didn't take the fullness of the atonement which is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and so therefore they didn't come and to receive the true atonement in as full as she is a believer a professed believer but she'll have to go through the tribulation period the Bible said in the rest of them the Dragons past burned it out water out of his mouth to go and make war and what an hour that is and that is of course the last verses of revelation 11 I believe it is now so she she rejects the atonement in his fullness and goes into the tribulation period peace the trumpet he said now here is the calling out time the sixth seal when it's opened persecution struck the Jews in the lintel standpoint and comes a persecution to the church in the ecclesiastical standpoint because the bride is already called so this ecclesiastical persecution drove the bride out of denomination but the ecclesiastical persecution oh yeah drove that the ecclesiastical listen closely the ecclesiastical persecution drove the bride out of the nomination but the ecclesiastical persecution drives the church into the tribulation and then it turns physical so you see the pressure is on everybody ecclesiastical its own the bride and the church of the bride it forces our back the word to the rest of them it pushes them into concentration camps and and their safety believing and Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Catholic organizations and they wind up in the tribulation where it turns physical would you like to see that let's look at revelation 11 and the last couple of verses there if you will please let's let's just see revelation is it 11 okay I mean this look real quick real quick where we talking about the remnant of the woman's seed that's Revelation 12 isn't the last the last verses okay yeah and so in in Revelation 12 and verse 17 what's now and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ so you see then war is made against the foolish virgin and there's a multitude of them in Revelation 7 that have washed their robes in the blood the lamb the maid the white and they come up out of Great Tribulation now listen brother Branham he says now I'm going to say something is recognized in your day in this message right after Feast of Trumpets national force but Israel and our homeland national voice will put the church in the World Council of Churches but the power of God will put people in the bride the world forces this way the world forces that would but God forces upward and the Spirit of God which is a Word of God my spirit as my word of spirit in life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position and the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in place no national force will do it but the national force did drive Israel into the homeland and the National forces of the Catholic Church Council of Churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride in the glory out of it what a problem study is and then of course Feast of the trumpets he told us that he said it was a spirit of Antichrist upon them bringing them to slaughter just like they didn't the other than our to call the bride how loose in the ecclesiastical church spirit Lucifer what not abundant along the nation's upon the bride now here you get it the bride will not go through that time the Bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see brethren that you say the church has got to go to the persecution for the perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride a man who chooses his wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace to with her she's found grace with him he engages to her and if anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her head his grace is so great amen but I will tell you that we have been in a time of trouble and this age is the last page and it's full of trouble and I award you it will only get worse you gonna wind up in the Tribulation Period and as we go closer to it you're going to feel more and more the winds of that tribulation but I want you to know in the midst of all of this materials the Great Prince which standeth in the time of conflict and he standeth for the children of thy people and I want you to know as you're looking at the news where this virus I've been called it a demon a man supernatural Devils are going to the land maybe you've been attacked maybe cancer is attacking and I'm talking specifically to some of you supernatural Devils and you're under attack you're going through the land and they're fallen angels angels of death Jesus called sickness death and this brings a time of great trouble and there's a nation our nation and as a world our world it is a time of great trouble and I said god bless you brother Caleb sisters Shalom and those gathered with you right now in the in the India who can't who can't meet right now because you've been shut down and I greet you all around the world wherever you are in Europe some of your same places some in America 50 or more or less I mean but you know it's a time of great trouble some of you have got personal attacks you're already attacked maybe it's cancer in your body perhaps it's a diabetic condition but it's a spirit is an enemy it's a demon and I just wanted I want you to look away from the bad news and I want you to look to the good news and the good news is I saw another mighty angel that there is an anointing that has come down from heaven there is a loyal team of people on the earth and causing her to believe hallelujah and I want you to know you're not alone you are anointed and there is Wow and maybe maybe it's been 21 days maybe it's been longer than twenty one day maybe it's been a long time maybe it's been a spiritual drought I don't care how long it's been I want you to know the angel has stood up on your behalf man he's coming to the aid of Gabriel who is coming to bring your message that is the time of fulfillment that we're living in the day in the hour where there's angelic wars that are going on and what you are seeing in the world today is an angelic bar and I want you to know you've got God on your side you're not alone in this you're not facing this by yourself God knew it may come like a trap up earlier but it didn't come like a snare and a trap to God he knew about it long long time ago and he planned the scripture and that day Michael shall stand up and if he's standing up for Israel he's gotta be standing up for the bride because you're Israel man they're the natural we are the spiritual whatever is happening there is happening here come on and God has fought their battles God's fight your battles you're not fighting this alone sings anointing your friend anoint your faith with all the bad news all the bad news maybe it's the bad news from the cancer lab maybe it's the bad news from the doctor all of these things are coming in your ear right now but I want you to know there's a battle going on that's going on in your mind there's a war the war for your faith to turn your faith and non-believer to turn turn your heart to believing I'm going to say you're a believer turned to believing in the Book of Daniel a book a brand the book of Revelation Michael is shown as a messenger of war he fights to the realms of darkness against the Prince of Persia to bring a message to Daniel and in the book of Revelation it shows him prevailing against Lucifer and his angels I want you to know I you know you're looking for prophecy look at the prophecy Michael fights against Lucifer and his angels and he prevails I want you to know it's already written in the book who's going to win you cannot lose this battle you are a winner Daniel chapter 10 gives him fascinating account of Gabriel and Archangel who was hindered for twenty-one days because of the Prince of Persia and then Michael came to help him and he got through to Daniel to reveal to him his day his hour and give him the promise of restoration and I want you to know an angel has got through to the bride in this last day with a message a message I'm not gonna leave you here I'm not going to leave you in Persia I'm gonna take you back to your homeland I'm not gonna leave you in seeing the darkness and this evil a I'm taking you in a rapture and the message has gotten to let's look at this for a moment Hebrews 1:14 are not angels all angels ministered spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation so look here they're ministering spirits Jesus received the comfort of angels after his temptation he received comfort and strength from angels gethsemane to go to the cross are you with me I'm trying to tell you you are believer here Paul received the comfort of an angel who told him you're not going to perish but you're gonna make it we have received the comfort of an angel I want you to know this message is the only message with an angelic visitation that came night after night after night after night to confirm I'm with you I'm with you I'm with you I knew your situation I know your your care and I have the power to defeat that devil and I can make him leave you it said prisoners free people who are prison in a crippled condition in spiritual conditions in blind conditions Matthew 18 10 what if you want the little ones see that you don't despise one of these little ones for I say to you that their angels continually see the face of my father who is in heaven I want you to know there is even your angels are interceding on your behalf beholding your father's face come he's not only a good Jesus father he's our Father man the Angels they're taking back messengers there's they're believing down there man they've been in this battle they they go go through this suffering then they're here that they don't see how they can make another night that you don't see how they can go another day they're in the desperate situation father move not only that but the prayers of the saints go up there before the throne now commence and I'll tell you we got enough and keep on market and asking keep on asking and seeking people secret we must never give [Music] some 34 and seven the angel the lord encamps about those who fear Him I want you to know I can't be with you maybe in your quarantine but he came he's right there in that home with you right now the angel of his presence temps about them that fear him and I love this part and everybody say it with me and deliver them and deliver them he's not only there he's delivering you he's there fighting your battle he's there helping you in this war of doubts and concern and trust and mistrust and oh you know wherever you see my gear on a waiver and see and you don't know what to believe and these quotes are towed and that misses food and that you're wondering this and you wonder that he's their sums they 111 he will give his angels charge concerning you to guard you in all your ways you're not alone he is there so what brother Jim what water water what if what if what what if what if what if what if what if what if and I hear the tremble what if I I get what if I die all death can do is take you into his presence so what if you die you escape just the same as listening brother branham and listening to the report of where he was in the jungles of our meetings he'd went to get system Mita who was joined him for the last day of those meetings where he's eight days and nights and the prayer lines he went to get system Mita I don't know maybe met her in a train station or bus station somewhere got her brought it there I had to park blocks away to get to the where the meetings was there's no parking as he was going in a little ambulance driver comes waving at him and and just you know trying frantically to get his attention he said you calling me sir yes I'm calling you said please come quick there's a woman here it is dying if she ain't dead he said I can't go there there's thousands of people and I can't show you no preference here and this time like this I can't but he said the man he's he's in desperate condition his wife is dead he's can't you just come and comfort him just a little prayer anything easy you know I can't stand to see this old man he's brought his wife she's had cancer in the female glands and and and it was all wrapped around they couldn't do surgery and now she's dying and they've sold everything they could to hire me to come in and the sandlots to come to the meeting and now she's dead and he said well just call an undertaker he said no said please come off or at least already comfort please sorry if it was brother branham said okay so they made a way and someone said we'll help you get there and but to us sure he got him through the crowd and got him down into there he said he got in there and said there was an old man with some patched up overalls he's and he was crying and so mamas dead mother's dead and he said no but but how could this be said we were believing with all our hearts and we trying to get here to the meet and then we just didn't make it in time and now that is how you did are you the doctor said no I'm brother branham he said well what would you pray for he said well yeah I'll offer a word of Prayer he's felt everything there was no pumps furthermore he took her by the her right hand by his left hand and there was no moving of those of those that cancer which would move on his arm as a sign of that of that life that would reflect against him now the reason I'm saying this even if death does take you the cancer dies it dies too but you still live you can't die so you're gonna win no matter what no matter which way you go you're gonna die in faith if that's the way you go through death you're gonna die in faith but the demon will die too but you will still be living one breath beyond here that's why you can stand with every cancer victim or anybody else with dazzle of a germ disease and and say look in the gasket this man still living but that demons dead the Bram said there was no life so he said I just begin to pray said Lord Jesus you understand this man has sold everything that he had sold his farm and different things to get her to surgery and that didn't work and sold his neither sold her blackberries and some quilts and in order to make the tip here and now she's going to use he's praying like that he felt his hand her hand squeeze his he opened his eyes for a moment and he looked and see him still seemed like she was still dead so he just said that was my imagination he just kept praying there and and a moment again she squeezed his hand again and and he opened his eyes and was looking at her and said you could see the muddy the muddy waters coming out of her eyes and all of a sudden her eyes flick open and become not clouded anymore but clear and she looks up at him and says who are you are you the doctor and he said no I'm brother Branham and as he began to talk with her the dad sitting over there with his head down crying here we gonna say mother mother mother you're live here you're living and he said he felt her hand and the cancer was dead there was no life in it he said she was healed by the glory of God and I just want to say to you you see that was because of an angelic visit and I want you the angel of this presence of complices that accompanies this message and there is a war that is going on and he has spit up on your behalf that even even in death he'll raise you up even in sickness he'll make you well a man that there's no disease known to man that this God doesn't have the remedy far and he will give his angels charge concerning the little bride to guard you in all your ways Exodus 23 20 and let's go back to their Exodus nominee believes we're in the Nexus and then listen I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared and I want you to remember I want to remind you shall I blow a trumpet to you man a gospel trumpet a memorial a reminder that there is an angel that accompanies this message and no message has been vindicated by an angel like this Jacob had blind faith all Roberts students audience just imagine Jesus standing there and that Jesus was right here but this messenger he didn't imagine anything he did not bind faith hey man he he had an actual visible presence of an angel and many saw that angel and pictures were taken out that angel and that light that surrounded his presence and those who didn't see it were like me I didn't see the angel nor did I see the light but I'd like when you see the wind and it glows the trees I saw the effects and man has it discerned the hearts as it called out sickness as it spoke to different individuals and me as a live 11 year old boy I saw the effects of that angel as he passed through the congregation hallelujah a man I didn't see an angel with sister lana was healed but he was here I didn't see an angel when he swept through the room hey man you can just say oh it just was happenstance at that moment sister Karen her brain a brain bleed dissipated in her brain and and the swelling went down and at that moment sight came back but explain to me how a little crippled boy who'd never walk couldn't pull up couldn't take a step are you with me a man jumps up mid doesn't take his first step walking doesn't take his first steps Dublin that baby got up out of that floor and ran around the room the house and my my eyes were watching followed him around watching in amazement the working of the Holy Spirit as a crippled boy walk and my wife could see I had maybe seen the angel but I've seen the effects a man and I see the effects of oh this is the very gospel that we have it changes life it very many turns men from sin and darkness into light it is the angel of his present and he said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you I'm gonna try to close illness because I've got enough till 6 o'clock tonight it could probably go longer but I haven't heard his voice since a child it was at the age of 37 after being told over and over by the clergy and Vala ministers that God didn't heal no more remember the church brother Brandon was in was a Baptist Church they didn't believe in healing would you think of it like this when he went to mill town got an old Apple box now watch as I went to the steps of a prophet it was being led by the Lord didn't know what to do and I know it gives me a lot of comfort because there's a lot of times you don't know where you're gonna put your foot next he tried this and he tried that he went and bought in my apple cart Apple Creighton stepped up on it and said but no words would come to his mind and he was just stumbling around to try to say something thought he'd preach on the street and that wasn't working he wasn't anointing for that so brother Ike came by and said that that cause he'd went together with him so why don't you go with me why don't you just go with me down to - I'm gonna sell some eggs to a man and once you go with me there and you passes by Church and he feels in those a very strange spirit he goes there doors locked so you don't what to do now he sits there on the steps a man comes up said you one in here said I've got the key but because that they put on the flyer inviting people to a meeting it was an old abandoned church the city had taken over and they got permission that day to hold a meeting they put on the flyer brother right thought it was thought it would be good you know I'm put on there another little Billy Sunday thought that would attract but down at the bottom said bring the sick and afflicted we pray for the sick and because of that nobody would come to the meetings that night he would preach to three people three or four people brother right his son and daughter and maybe it's for the rights why big into building the next night the man steps to the door knocks his pipe out said I want to see that little Billy Sunday brother right said come in have a seat and runs up till the brother branham said that's the hardest man in the city he owns a rock quarry down here said he's hard they invited him to come down front to said he's and I'll sit here in the back I watched this part you watch yours really hard brother branham went and prayed started preaching preacher with all his heart that night at the end of that service that man bill Hall came down to the altar and gave his heart to Christ surrendered his heart now they got one person bill Hall goes back to the quarry and tells all his employee get down here to this meeting you got to hear this breech change my life he invites his neighbors the next night they got about 18 at the end of this meeting there that night they called for those who are sick and and they have prayer and people are healed people with cancer people other situations are healed noise goes out the next night to have you know many more and finally they got a building full and finally you know but but again you know in all of this you see it was the Holy Spirit movement and the angel of God leading and led him right down to meal town where a little girl was crying out trapped in the prison of her own body and brought deliverance to the little Georgie Carter ma'am and it was all because of the angel of his presence and it goes to show you no matter where you are and how the ecclesiastical spirits that say the days of miracles are past and they had banned anybody said anybody goes to that church meeting where that man praying for the sick we don't believe in that will excommunicate you from the church can't you see it was an ecclesiastical spirit bringing the persecution but the little lambs were getting it anyway and that's the thing with you the work it cannot be kept from God's elect that's gonna find you somewhere and it sounds you I want you just to stop for a moment because that wasn't Georgie's only healing and 1954 she gets breast cancer and she's dying again and there's no hope but the angel of God comes to rescue again heals her of her breast cancer and she lives into the 1990s 1998 I think 84 years old ripe old age why because of this angel what am I trying to tell you I'm trying to tell you there's an angel gone to the land scientifically they've named it come in 19 it came from eating unclean animals people - just used some Bible guidelines you know of cleanliness and uncleanness maybe this wouldn't even crossed over into humans but these heathen people do this so it crosses crossed over from bats or snakes or something there and crossed over into humans and mutates and comes in and now is a spirit going through the world and people are shaking in their boots but at that time Michael stand up I want you to know you're not alone little bride wherever you are around the world we're not going through the tribulation and persecution is not what we need for a body change we have received the message for the body change you just want to talk about that final quick and when we see the data rise we're gonna be changed immediately to be like them we've already received the last sign I've been telling you you're on display and you're it because you are the last sign God in human flesh he manifested through a prophet now manifested in Brad form I want you to be a sign to the world Jesus Christ lives and he's the same yesterday today and forever don't doubt don't fear believe only believe all things are possible nothing can harm you not even death because if death would hit you the Spirit of God is gonna raise you up remember divine healing it is the earnest of the resurrection we got to have it and you got to get sick to be healed otherwise we wouldn't have divine healing we'd have divine health you know we don't we have mortal bodies but there is a healer and I want you to put your faith in him this morning as a musician comes and we try to wind this down maybe I can speak about this a little more in a further service on how to enforce it how to be on display but I want you to understand the Holy Spirit is here to enforce to enforce that word against your enemy when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God will lift up a standard against him put your faith in it right now reach out reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by you might be sung that song last Sunday bless sing it again I want you wherever you are in your home here over in South Africa brother Kaylin saying and the believers there with you whoever might be streaming in that area the sisters Shalom the Caleb mom and dad I love you folks god bless you moves my heart to hear about the

come to Christ getting fall in love with Jesus more than you've ever been invite him to come with you ask him to come to your heart if you you're not sure you got no peace you have no anchor maybe you're been doing that you know that's wrong you know that's wrong [Music] god bless you [Music] you're thirsty you've been trying things of the world is satisfied because you hadn't come and drank incoming drink yet valued you hadn't valued of wine of this word the stimulation power that have changed getting valued you hadn't drank of it maybe been lit on a church pew for years and you just never had that sincerity and never had that real dedication don't you want the angel to stand up for you is their little lamb maybe in your heart it's crying out Jesus [Music] maybe that's why you cut off your hair because you've been thirsting for God but you tried to do something else to satisfy maybe the ecclesiastical persecution wore upon you oh ain't nothing wrong no it's just ecumenical oh my god you know I I just want to fit it fit in with what I'm asking you to turn to Jesus wherever you are turn to it no you're gonna hide your hair down to the floor and dragging the floor just having to lift it up six foot down behind you that didn't save you that's not it jesus said if you love me you keep my Commandments then you're gonna like amendments aren't Grievous you love to do what's right you're willing to be on display a sign to the world I'm a Nazarite I'm consecrated to God I'm not part of this world maybe it's time you go do you through your life you make your home a place where Jesus was - maybe it's time to fuss and the fight that's going on in the home between you you and your husband and wife and get down on your knees and say we've got to come to Jesus [Music] we got escaped if we're having a dress rehearsal here and things are getting bad now how do I escape what's coming I want to be ready will you make that choice right now wherever you are kneel down there

my hands on this promise and I claim it for myself today sickness can't stay any longer perfect love casts out all fear I have perfect love hey man that's the Holy Ghost I'm gonna pray for you right now as you lay your hands on your Bible once you claim your promise there's no sickness can stand before the name of Jesus that at the name of Jesus every knee has to bow and every tongue has to confess that he's Lord as you lay your hands of your Bible and those may be around and lay your hands on the sick father we believe your word of promise right now Lord God is too sick under the sound of my voice they need a touch from you Lord right now I pray O God they'll be touched as you can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities that you'll feel their need and right now that the demon that's oppressing them will leave their body and they will be healed I claim it by the virtue of the name of Jesus Christ and the promise given to us as believers right now in Jesus name now Satan take your hands over God's property it don't take my physical presence to be there and they don't even take my voice come into the internet or the ether waves or our it comes I speak out into the dimensions of the unseen and that's the son of God my faith I live myself in that dimension and I speak to that demon that same demon that had to leave the servant boy when Jesus did the same maybe he was miles away but he spoke into that realm and the servant lived same thing that happened when a prophet was there in his home in Jeffersonville kneeling down at a veg stool and his wife was there going to the doctor and said before the doctors hands touch her they see me healed I speak it in the name of the law the same one who commissioned me to speak so that there would be money for Japanese
