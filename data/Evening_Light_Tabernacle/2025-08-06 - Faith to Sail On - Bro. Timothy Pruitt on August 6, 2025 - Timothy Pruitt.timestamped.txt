[18:15] [Music]
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Our spit
[18:27] a song of praise that flows
[18:33] [Music]
[18:34] from those you have redeemed.
[18:39] [Music]
[18:41] And we will use the words we know.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you just tell them tell you
[18:50] an awesome
[18:52] God
[18:54] you are
[18:56] when words are not enough
[19:00] to tell you?
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, just make that personal to him. Sing
[19:08] it to him again now. Lord, won't you

[19:25] A song of praise that flows.
[19:32] Oh, from those you have redeemed.
[19:39] And we will use the words we know
[19:44] just to tell you,
[19:47] Lord, what an awesome God
[19:52] you are.
[19:55] [Music]
[20:05] Let's pray together.
[20:07] Heavenly Father, Lord, as as we sang in
[20:10] the song, our desire tonight is that the
[20:12] glory of the Lord would rise among us,
[20:14] Lord. Lord, we can come together and see
[20:17] one another and we enjoy that. We enjoy
[20:19] the fellowship. We enjoy friendships and
[20:22] bonds, Lord, of like precious faith. But
[20:25] Lord, if you don't come and you don't
[20:26] speak, Lord, it's been a meaningless
[20:28] gathering of people. So Lord, we're
[20:30] looking under you tonight to just come
[20:32] and move us out of the way. Uh give us
[20:34] the strength to move tiredness out of
[20:36] the way and worries out of the way. And
[20:38] just for this short time, focus in on
[20:40] you and what it is you would have for us
[20:41] tonight, Lord. What you would want us to
[20:43] hear in this service, Father. Lord, so
[20:46] we just want to commit ourselves and our
[20:47] minds, Lord, right now to you, our
[20:49] thinking to you, and and lock in for
[20:51] this next little bit and just begin to
[20:53] worship you, Lord. And I just pray that
[20:54] our worship will please you, Lord. That
[20:56] it'll be something that comes from the
[20:58] heart tonight, Lord, and just rise up as
[21:00] we recognize, Lord. We've all been
[21:01] rescued by by the Messiah. We've been
[21:04] called out of this age, Lord. Lord, and
[21:06] we're grateful for it. We're thankful
[21:08] for it. And we've gathered on this
[21:09] Wednesday night with with expectation in
[21:11] our heart, Lord. Lord, just knowing that
[21:13] you're going to speak and Lord, directly
[21:15] to each and every heart, Lord, if each
[21:17] and every heart will just open it up to
[21:19] receive you, Lord. Lord, tonight may it
[21:21] fall on good ground as the word goes
[21:23] forth. Not stony ground, not hardened
[21:26] ground, not even distracted ground, but
[21:28] Lord, tonight may that seed fall and be
[21:30] quickened. May we be strengthened in our
[21:33] faith just raised up, Lord, to the level
[21:35] of the promise tonight that we can
[21:36] receive, Lord, all that you have for us
[21:38] in this service, Father. Lord, we're
[21:40] looking for you to speak, Lord. You
[21:42] know, those that are sick, those that
[21:43] are hurt, been injured, Lord, just
[21:45] battling different things. And we just
[21:47] pray right now, Lord, that even as we're
[21:49] in this service, that the healing angel
[21:51] of God will go by each place. Lord, you
[21:53] took stripes for our healing, Lord. And
[21:55] we believe that they haven't lost any of
[21:57] their power, but today you still heal
[21:59] and you still deliver and you still set
[22:01] free. So Lord, I pray even now on the
[22:03] wings, Lord, of this prayer, Lord, that
[22:05] you'll just go to the sick and afflicted
[22:07] and bring deliverance, Lord. And in this
[22:09] service, Lord, there's many afflicted
[22:11] because, Lord, you said that many are
[22:13] the afflictions of the righteous, but
[22:15] didn't stop there. You said that you
[22:17] would deliver us out of them all. So,
[22:19] Lord, we're expecting deliverance and
[22:21] healing, Lord, tonight in this service.
[22:23] Lord, we're expecting you to come and
[22:25] speak to hearts, speak to our lives.
[22:28] Lord, I have need of you. I know that
[22:30] that's the testimony of everyone in this
[22:31] building. We have need of you tonight.
[22:33] Lord, we recognize that need. And we ask
[22:35] that you'll just anoint our brother
[22:36] Timothy. allow him to speak words, Lord
[22:39] God, directed by you, straight to our
[22:41] hearts tonight. Lord, we just turn this
[22:43] time now and ask you to take preeminence
[22:46] in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[22:52] [Music]
[22:54] How do you explain?
[23:00] And how do you describe
[23:06] a love that goes from peace
[23:12] and runs as deep as it is wide?
[23:17] [Music]
[23:19] Lord, you know all my
[23:23] [Music]
[23:27] and you know all of
[23:34] words cannot.
[23:38] Lord, do you feel that way tonight?
[23:41] Lord, I just want to find some way to
[23:43] tell you how much I love you, Lord. So
[23:48] listen to my heart.
[23:51] [Music]
[23:53] Oh here our spirit sing
[23:58] [Music]
[24:01] a song of praised.
[24:07] Oh, from the Lord you have redeemed
[24:14] and we will use the words we love
[24:20] to tell you
[24:23] more than a soul.
[24:26] Brothers can take up the offering.
[24:29] Words are not enough
[24:31] to tell you.
[24:35] Listen to my
[24:39] voice.
[24:41] And if words could fall, I pray.
[24:45] [Music]
[24:48] Oh, from these lips of mine.
[24:55] And if I had a thousand years,
[25:01] oh, I was still
[25:04] I still run out of time.
[25:08] So if you listen to my heart,
[25:13] [Music]
[25:14] oh Lord, every people would say,
[25:20] "Oh, thank you, T. Thank you, Lord, for
[25:24] the life. And I thank you for the truth
[25:29] and thank you for the way."
[25:35] Oh, listen to my voice.
[25:41] Yes, Lord.
[25:43] Hear our spirit sing.
[25:50] The song of praise.
[25:54] [Music]
[25:56] Oh, from those you have redeemed.
[26:00] [Music]
[26:01] [Applause]
[26:03] And we will use the words we know
[26:08] to tell you what
[26:12] it all comes
[26:20] [Music]
[26:29] from
[26:32] words.
[26:34] [Music]
[26:45] When words are not
[26:50] tell
[26:53] [Music]
[27:04] I know we've
[27:07] mentioned it before and
[27:10] it's been a while
[27:12] just had that story on my heart this
[27:16] evening and sister Biscll had mentioned
[27:19] years ago
[27:22] brother Brand on being out in a boat
[27:23] with some believers and
[27:27] they were going along and hit a bump in
[27:29] the boat And
[27:31] they thought they'd hit a log under the
[27:33] water. And he said, "That wasn't a log.
[27:35] That was the angel."
[27:38] My prayer tonight is that each one of us
[27:40] will feel that bump in the boat. And
[27:44] &gt;&gt; whatever your need is, whatever your
[27:45] desire, that
[27:48] mighty angel will come by,
[27:51] bump into your situation.
[27:54] Hallelujah.

[37:21] tonight that he's here with us, even in
[37:24] us, touching our hearts and lives. Let's
[37:27] just go to him in prayer. Father, we
[37:29] just come to you today, Lord, asking
[37:32] that you would come and speak to us,
[37:34] Lord, once again, and minister to
[37:37] hearts, Lord. And just ask, Father, you
[37:40] just come and make yourself known to us
[37:42] in a real special way, Lord. We if there
[37:45] be anything we've done or said not be
[37:47] pleasing to you, you bring bring
[37:48] forgiveness, Lord. And whatever it is,
[37:51] Father, we just want to be yours and be
[37:54] yielded to you, Lord. And your your
[37:56] people, Lord, today to feel your
[37:58] presence, but not just feel your
[38:00] presence, but let that presence, Lord,
[38:02] reign supreme in our hearts and lives.
[38:04] We pray. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[38:10] Amen.
[38:12] Turn our Bibles to Luke chapter 8 and
[38:14] verse 22.
[38:20] Said, "Now it came to pass on a certain
[38:22] day that he went into a ship with his
[38:24] disciples,
[38:26] and he said unto them, let us go over to
[38:29] the other side of the lake." And they
[38:31] launched forth. But as they sailed, he
[38:35] fell asleep. And they came down a storm
[38:37] of wind on the lake, and they were
[38:38] filled with water and were in jeopardy.
[38:42] And they came to him and awoke him,
[38:44] saying, "Master, master, we perish."
[38:46] Then he arose and rebuked the wind and
[38:49] the raging of the water, and they
[38:51] ceased, and there was a calm. And he
[38:54] said unto them, "Where is your faith?"
[38:56] And they being afraid wondering, saying
[38:58] one to another, "What manner of man is
[39:00] this? For he commandeth even the winds
[39:03] and water, and they obey him. Amen.
[39:07] We'll let you be seated.
[39:12] Amen.
[39:13] It's good to be in the house of the
[39:15] Lord.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have um Sister Rosie Bennett
[39:19] that is with us this evening and um
[39:23] she's kin of course to the Pattons and
[39:25] to the Mitchells and she's been going
[39:28] through quite quite a trial in her life.
[39:30] And I'm just going to kind of read you a
[39:32] series of texts that I received in just
[39:34] the last week. It says, first of all,
[39:37] we're done here at Emory and headed
[39:39] home. They did tell us Rosanna is in
[39:41] heart failure, but no med bed meds are
[39:44] needed right now. Doctor says exercise
[39:46] is key and she needs to do it even when
[39:49] she's isn't feeling like it. The damage
[39:52] is done. Unless God touches her, there's
[39:54] no one doing it. But he said she could
[39:57] live a long time like this. And uh I
[40:00] think the diagnosis was maybe four years
[40:03] up to 40 years. They didn't really know,
[40:05] but she was just living with a lot of
[40:07] heart damage from the chemo and things
[40:09] that she had taken, I believe, from from
[40:11] the cancer she had in her leg. And this
[40:14] is just that was just about a week or so
[40:16] ago. And then this week says, "Hello
[40:18] everyone. We're finished up and headed
[40:20] our separate ways. Rosanna's coming back
[40:22] to Mendon." and he said, "We got a good
[40:24] really good report. All Rosanna's
[40:26] numbers have recovered. Last year they
[40:28] were not so great, but this year we're
[40:30] perfect. Chest chest X-rays were good.
[40:33] Leg leg x-rays showed some
[40:35] brittleleness, but nothing to be
[40:37] concerned about at this time. They
[40:39] actually called us back in for an
[40:41] unscheduled echo as they're thinking our
[40:44] heart's a little better maybe than it
[40:45] was. Praise the Lord for that. We won't
[40:48] hear the results from it for a few days.
[40:51] uh we don't have to return for a year.
[40:53] And then today, this is from Sarah Beth
[40:56] said, "Rosie just told me she went to
[40:58] the doctor. They told her that she has
[41:00] no record of heart failure. The heart
[41:02] failure is completely gone and she
[41:04] doesn't have it. Thank the Lord.
[41:08] It's a miracle."
[41:12] So they So they can't even find the
[41:15] records where they ever told her she had
[41:17] it.
[41:19] God completely got rid of it. Well,
[41:21] that's the kind of God we serve. Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; I I love the God that can just destroy
[41:26] the records.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know the records he destroyed
[41:29] in our lives. And so, we're thankful for
[41:31] that. Amen. I I I just want to speak to
[41:34] you this evening on faith to sell on.
[41:37] You know, as we read in our scripture,
[41:39] Jesus said to them, "Let us go to the
[41:42] over to the other side." And I I think
[41:44] that's quite a statement because as we
[41:47] read later, you know, they got in a lot
[41:49] of a pretty good jam as it were, they
[41:51] got got to uh in in the sea as it begin
[41:54] to storm and winds begins to rise and
[41:58] waves begin to and I don't know if
[42:00] you've ever been in a situation like
[42:01] that, but it's kind of a scary
[42:03] situation. I I've been in some big
[42:05] waves. Actually, uh I was with brother
[42:08] James Lei one time in over in
[42:10] Washington, me and my wife. and and and
[42:13] waves. I've never seen waves quite that
[42:14] big where you would just disappear and
[42:16] couldn't see land and you'd bob back up,
[42:18] see land for a little bit. It it's a
[42:20] little bit of a scary situation to be
[42:22] in. You know, I I remember when that
[42:24] first actually sister Ruth had got on
[42:26] another boat with another a bigger boat
[42:29] and me and brother James was going
[42:30] across this by oursel and and it's
[42:32] getting worse. The winds were getting
[42:34] worse and we was trying to make it
[42:35] across and and I'm holding on to that
[42:37] boat, you know, and I'm all brave. Don't
[42:39] have a life jacket on. even thought
[42:40] about a life jacket for whatever reason.
[42:43] And all of a sudden that first wave
[42:44] crashed over the bow of that boat and I
[42:46] went, "Wow, this is awesome." Second
[42:49] wave crashed over over that boat and I
[42:51] said, "Where is my life jacket?"
[42:54] But it, you know, it can get very very
[42:56] scary because it's a something that we
[42:58] can't control as humans is the is the
[43:00] water. Water is very powerful force. You
[43:03] know, it's very easy, you know, to trust
[43:05] God, you know, when you're in a safe
[43:07] place in your life, you know, when
[43:09] things are going along in your way and
[43:11] you're in the boat and things are just a
[43:13] and and and vice versa is hardly a more
[43:16] calming place to be in a boat on a lake
[43:18] somewhere or out out in a in the sea or
[43:22] whatever and just a little wind pushing
[43:23] you along or gentle breeze. You know,
[43:25] it's it's real easy to trust God during
[43:27] those moments. But uh you know, as we
[43:30] know, life isn't always a gentle breeze.
[43:33] Life isn't always calm waters. All of a
[43:35] sudden, storms can gather and waves can
[43:38] grow and a and can start crashing
[43:41] against the boat and winds can become
[43:43] very fierce. But at those times, you
[43:46] have to realize that you have to trust
[43:48] not in your own abilities, but you have
[43:50] to trust in the one that's with you. And
[43:53] as long as he's in the boat, that's all
[43:55] that matters. Amen. And because he he he
[43:58] wasn't concerned. He knew he knew that
[43:59] the winds and the waves were going to
[44:01] come up. He knew all the things that
[44:02] were going to take place. He just said,
[44:04] "Let's go over to the other side." And
[44:06] and I think that's kind of how he does
[44:08] it. He with us, he calls us out of sin
[44:10] or calls us out of whatever. And he
[44:12] calls us into this Christian life. And
[44:14] he he tells us that we got a home
[44:16] prepared and he's went to prepare a
[44:18] place. And you know, and he don't always
[44:19] tell us about all the things that are
[44:21] going to go on inside all of this span
[44:24] of time from here to here. But as long
[44:26] as he's in the boat, that's all that
[44:28] matters.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he's in the boat, then the
[44:31] storms can cease and just as quick as
[44:33] they picked up. Amen. Amen. Or even
[44:35] quicker, when he is in the boat, he is
[44:37] in control of every situation. Amen. But
[44:40] the point is that we have to trust in
[44:42] the one who is carrying us or who is
[44:45] with us. And mean we're to sail in spite
[44:48] of the winds and in spite of the waves.
[44:50] Amen. And you know Hebrews chapter 10
[44:53] and verse 38 is actually I I found today
[44:55] is actually referring to sailing in a
[44:58] way. It says, "Now the just shall live
[45:00] by faith, but if any man draw back, my
[45:03] soul shall have no pleasure in him. But
[45:06] we are not of them who draw back unto."
[45:10] This draw back is actually the word for
[45:12] letting down the sails. that when the
[45:15] winds get tough or the things get going
[45:17] the wrong way or things get a little out
[45:19] of cate or out of out of our control
[45:21] that we just pull the sails down and you
[45:23] know and we just lose our faith and we
[45:26] just drift along. No, it's a time to
[45:28] keep sailing on because God is in
[45:30] control of this ship. God is in control
[45:33] of this vessel. He that called you, he
[45:35] that started the work, he is going to
[45:37] finish the work. Amen. You know, I
[45:39] actually got on that a little bit last
[45:40] Wednesday on the sailboat and I wasn't
[45:43] quite ready uh really prepared for it
[45:45] just on the kind of the last there on
[45:48] Wednesday, but I got to looking at it
[45:49] again this week and and I actually
[45:51] misunderstood what the captain has said.
[45:53] I thought he said kneeling, but he
[45:54] actually said healing when the boat is
[45:57] bend into the wind. Amen. But whether
[45:59] it's healing or whether it's kneeling,
[46:00] amen, I believe is very applicable to
[46:02] our lives that God no matter what
[46:05] situation that we're in. Maybe maybe
[46:07] maybe we're going into the wind. You
[46:09] know, you know, if you that that we we
[46:11] we could go into a lot of scriptures
[46:13] about the Holy Spirit, amen, being the
[46:16] wind that blows us and and we know Satan
[46:18] has a breath, but you know, sometimes,
[46:20] you know, you wonder if you're in the
[46:22] right wind. Well, let me tell you, if
[46:23] it's taking you the wrong direction,
[46:25] it's the wrong wind.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if it's going to the right
[46:29] place in the right direction, Amen. or
[46:31] even if you have to push against that
[46:33] wind, amen, whatever, you have been
[46:35] given the ability that if Satan is
[46:37] blowing against you, you've been given
[46:39] the ability to tune the vessel just
[46:42] right and you're going to go through
[46:43] that situation in your life. And then so
[46:46] he say said this draw back is to haul
[46:48] down to lower the sails. Amen. To furl
[46:51] them up, to to roll them back up, to
[46:53] draw yourself back and out of sight.
[46:56] Come on, somebody. That's exactly what
[46:58] Satan likes to do when you get in a
[47:00] battle. He likes you to go to yourself
[47:02] and pull to yourself and you become to
[47:04] your own little thing and your own
[47:06] little situation and your own little
[47:08] thoughts and your own and it's all you
[47:10] and nobody else. Listen, that ain't the
[47:12] time to draw back. That's the time to go
[47:14] forward. That ain't the time to pull
[47:15] away from fellowship. That's the time to
[47:17] get in more fellowship.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; That ain't the time to sit out of
[47:21] service. That's the time to get into
[47:22] more services. Amen. when Satan is
[47:25] coming against you with a hot hot breath
[47:28] of air. Amen. It's a time that you just
[47:31] just trim those sails a little bit and
[47:33] build that faith up a little higher and
[47:35] let that boat may it might lean over and
[47:37] it might feel like it's about to fall
[47:39] over, but God will take you through the
[47:42] winds and the waves of your life. Amen.
[47:45] But if you put the sails down and and
[47:47] you just let go of the r u the rudder
[47:49] and you just let go of it all at that
[47:51] boat begin to just flip around. I
[47:53] actually saw a man that just, you know,
[47:55] had kind of been been watching a little
[47:58] bit. A man who just left his job on the
[48:00] West Coast and bought him a sailboat,
[48:02] rebuilt it, never sailed in his life,
[48:03] and learned how to sail, and now he's
[48:05] sailing across the ocean, but he got in
[48:07] a position the other day when his rudder
[48:09] broke and and and you could tell that
[48:11] fear jumped and jumped in his eyes and
[48:14] and because now he couldn't steer that
[48:16] thing and get it directly into the wind
[48:18] or into the waves or however. Amen. He
[48:21] was at he was at where he could actually
[48:23] capsize very easy. And he said, "It was
[48:26] one of the scariest days of my life." I
[48:28] said, "I can imagine you're out there in
[48:30] the middle of this ocean. There ain't
[48:31] nobody around you. Ain't nobody can help
[48:33] you within a 100, 200, maybe 500 miles.
[48:36] It's a hard spot to be. And sometimes
[48:38] you feel that way in your life.
[48:40] Sometimes you feel like the rudder's
[48:42] broken, the sails are torn. But if
[48:44] you'll just stay in the ship and and
[48:46] you'll just say, "God, I may not know
[48:48] how to handle this situation, but I'm
[48:50] going to sell on. I'm going to push
[48:52] forward. I I'm going to get in more
[48:54] services. I'm going to get in more
[48:55] tapes. I'm I'm going to read my Bible
[48:57] more. I What are you doing? You're
[48:59] trimming the sales. You're you're
[49:00] raising them up. You're altering them
[49:02] just exactly to the point to where you
[49:05] can go through the wind." You know, you
[49:07] know, we we we see sometime, Brother
[49:08] Brand said it like this. He said, "You
[49:10] know, we talk about how bad the world is
[49:12] getting or how wicked the world is
[49:14] getting. It's true. It's very wicked."
[49:16] He said, "But look how great the church
[49:18] is getting all the time." He said,
[49:20] "Sometimes we failed to look at that
[49:22] side." Jesus said, "Let them grow
[49:24] together." He said that when the world
[49:25] gets more wicked and wicider and
[49:27] wicider, the church is going to get more
[49:30] powerful and powerful all the time. He
[49:33] said, "When the enemy comes in like a
[49:35] flood, the spirit of God is going to
[49:37] raise a standard against it." Sit still.
[49:39] Glory. The winds may be blowing. Just
[49:42] set yourselves.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Just set yourselves and move right on
[49:47] into the face of the storm. What do we
[49:49] care? Who's the captain? He'll take care
[49:51] of it. Now, don't fear. I'm always
[49:54] there. The captain says,
[49:57] &gt;&gt; "So, it doesn't matter what is going
[49:59] on." You know, the devil loves to make
[50:02] us think there's more of him. You know,
[50:04] and the world's more wicked than God is
[50:06] greater. No, God is greater than the
[50:08] world's ever going to be wicked.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; He's got a plan for this age that we're
[50:13] living in. We We can see how wicked the
[50:15] world was in little Moses's day. And you
[50:17] know, little Moses was put in a ship as
[50:19] it were on on a starllet night on the
[50:22] Nile when and the winds were blowing and
[50:24] the howling was taking place and this
[50:26] little baby laying in this little boat
[50:29] made by his mom on a Nile River and
[50:31] crocodiles around him. But brother said,
[50:34] "Hallelujah. He was safe and protected.
[50:38] Safe and protected. Cuz standing between
[50:41] him and those crocodiles or between him
[50:44] and the Nile was the atonement.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Between him and all the gales and all
[50:51] the heavy winds and all that the devil
[50:54] could send against him. Amen. Was the
[50:56] atonement. Nothing was going to turn
[50:58] that ark over.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing was going to turn
[51:03] that ark over. She was going to float
[51:05] right on through it. He said, "I can see
[51:06] the Holy Spirit standing there, angels
[51:09] guarding up and down the up and down the
[51:12] bank, swords drawn." No, nothing was
[51:13] going to touch that one. He said, "I can
[51:15] see the devil trying to sink the ark
[51:17] there and Amen. in Noah's day and Noah
[51:20] singing as he went through those sh
[51:22] those storms of 40 days and nights, oh
[51:25] Jesus, keep me near the cross or
[51:27] whatever song. All the devils in hell
[51:29] couldn't sink that heart because it had
[51:31] been built according to God's
[51:33] instruction. There was an atonement made
[51:36] that stood between him and the judgment.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; And that's every believer tonight. No
[51:42] matter how hard the jolts get or how
[51:45] hard the bounces are or how hard life
[51:48] may seem, as long as you are in Christ
[51:51] Jesus, there's nothing present, nothing
[51:53] future, no death, no sickness, no sorrow
[51:57] can separate you from the love of God.
[51:59] The devil will turn every gale loose on
[52:02] you, all hell loose on you. But God has
[52:04] a an atonement standing between you and
[52:07] the judgment.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; You will float every wave. You will go
[52:12] through every alligator bed.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The ship we're sailing is
[52:19] the ship of Zion. It's Christ. It's the
[52:22] foundation. It's the word. Amen. And
[52:25] brother Ram would put it like this. He
[52:27] said, "The stabilizers have been put on
[52:30] the ship." He said, "Sure, great fearful
[52:32] waves are out here before us. We know
[52:35] just but we know just beyond that
[52:37] fearful wave we are nearing the shore.
[52:41] We're getting close. He said just stay
[52:43] stable. Just stay in the word. Just stay
[52:46] with God. No matter how you feel,
[52:49] whatever else, stay right with the word.
[52:52] Let it stay. Let it stabilize you. He
[52:54] said when you see all those great big
[52:55] clouds around us, storms are coming,
[52:58] atomic bombs hanging everywhere,
[53:00] everything else they're talking about,
[53:01] but our stabilizer is the word. God said
[53:05] it would be here. We'll crest every one
[53:07] of them.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Every wave that Satan throws against
[53:11] this ship, she's going to rise above it.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; She's going to float over it. God said
[53:17] it would be here, but we're going to
[53:18] crest every one of them. We're going
[53:20] right over the top of them. They cannot
[53:23] sink us.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you, cancer
[53:28] cannot sink us. Satan with every kind of
[53:32] ism or every kind of doubt, every kind
[53:34] of fear, every kind of depression, it
[53:36] cannot sink us.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; This bride is not going down. She is
[53:42] going up.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; We go right over the top of it. They
[53:47] can't sink us. They can't drown us. You
[53:50] put us in a grave, we're coming out
[53:51] again.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. There ain't no way the
[53:55] world is going to keep it down. will
[53:56] crest every one of them because our
[54:00] chief captain is calling at the other
[54:02] side.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know, he said it's always
[54:07] a mystery to me how that by sail you can
[54:11] actually control the wind. You can go
[54:13] right smack into the face of the wind.
[54:15] That is it is a paradox. Take you
[54:18] forward right in the face of it. Right.
[54:20] even against currents. The current of
[54:23] the ocean, you can go right against it
[54:25] and right against the wind and and and
[54:28] and move forward. He said that's the way
[54:30] faith is. He said right in the face of
[54:33] it. It's just the way you set
[54:34] yourselves.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; As I said last Wednesday, actually a
[54:39] sailboat is nothing but airplane on its
[54:41] side is how they describe it. and and it
[54:43] uses both what's down underneath the
[54:45] ocean and what's above in the sails and
[54:47] and the way the water's moving around
[54:49] the bottom and the air is moving around
[54:51] the top and the d aerodynamics of it
[54:53] causes it to propel that boat forward
[54:56] and but it's the way you set your sails
[54:58] that is the way faith is if you just
[55:01] know how to pull your sails of faith
[55:03] around
[55:06] &gt;&gt; just pull your fa sales of faith around
[55:08] you and start adjusting them a little
[55:10] bit I say God adjust ourselves a little
[55:12] a bit tonight.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we're going to have to
[55:15] have them adjusted a bit for a body
[55:16] change, right? We're going to have to
[55:17] have them adjusted a bit for healing in
[55:19] our body, situations in our lives,
[55:21] things that we can't handle. We can't We
[55:24] can't do nothing on our own about Amen.
[55:26] We can't do nothing about the current.
[55:28] We can't do nothing about the wave. We
[55:30] can't do nothing about the wind, but we
[55:31] can do something about the way our boat
[55:33] is headed.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. We can't do
[55:38] nothing about the current of this world.
[55:40] This world's going to hell.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Right. It's going straight to a burning.
[55:46] It's going to hell. That is the current
[55:48] of this world. But there's somebody
[55:50] that's turned around and going against
[55:52] the current.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going with their ideas.
[55:56] We're not going with their dress. We're
[55:58] not going with their thoughts. We're not
[56:00] going with how they think or what they
[56:02] think or how they think our life ought
[56:04] to be. We're going with what the word
[56:06] said. Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; So, it's directly against the current.
[56:11] It's directly against the wind of this
[56:13] world. But this boat, if you'll adjust
[56:15] your sails of faith, it'll catch the
[56:17] wind of the Holy Ghost and it'll push
[56:19] you right through everything.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; It'll it'll do something for you if
[56:29] you'll adjust your sales of faith
[56:32] right in the face of difficulty. It'll
[56:35] drive you right on through it.
[56:38] The reason people get wrecked or
[56:40] shipwrecked is a couple things. They
[56:43] either take their sails down and they're
[56:46] at the mercies of the winds and the
[56:47] waves or or or they they turn it the
[56:50] wrong direction. Allow it to get a get a
[56:53] get sideways to get some waves. Listen,
[56:55] a ship is built to go straight through
[56:58] just right not not not sideways, but
[57:00] just right right through the wave.
[57:05] That's why we got to be careful that as
[57:07] we talked about Wednesday, we don't
[57:09] become twisted rope and twist it all up.
[57:11] And you know, I I actually admired the
[57:14] guy that was on our little sail sailboat
[57:16] the other day. The the first mate, they
[57:18] called him. You know, the captain was
[57:19] steering back there and he was telling
[57:20] him what to do. But I I I admired what
[57:23] he did because I had to help him. A
[57:25] couple of us guys on the boat had to
[57:27] help him pull up some of those sails and
[57:29] he would come behind us and he would
[57:31] make sure that rope and he would just
[57:32] adjust it. He I mean every rope was done
[57:35] just perfectly because you didn't want
[57:36] your ropes tied up in a real situation.
[57:39] You didn't want them tangled up because
[57:41] you wanted them things accessible. You
[57:43] wanted to be able to move them or do
[57:45] whatever you needed to do very quickly.
[57:46] You didn't want them tangled up with
[57:47] another rope or or tangled up around the
[57:50] mass or tangled up around the seat
[57:52] somewhere. He he would just roll them
[57:54] out just perfectly. And I watched how he
[57:56] done I thought, God, ain't that the way
[57:58] we ought to be in our lives to make sure
[58:00] things are not tangled up, make sure
[58:02] that things are not all messed up on the
[58:04] deck and and we got everything tore up
[58:06] and messed up in our lives. And no
[58:09] wonder sometimes we get in a situation
[58:11] and we start crying out wondering if
[58:13] we're going to make it through because
[58:14] we can't even adjust ourselves because
[58:16] stuff is so tangled in our lives.
[58:20] Of
[58:23] course, you know, the word is our
[58:25] compass.
[58:27] It's one thing that we'll know. The word
[58:28] is a it'll the compass. It'll point to a
[58:31] north star. That's your compass. That's
[58:33] what you're sailing with. The compass
[58:35] that I he said, I'm trying you to sail
[58:38] to trying to train you to sail with is
[58:40] the word. The word always points to him.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Always. He said, "You we feel like we're
[58:47] going through a great time of distress
[58:49] and trials and perplexities of time and
[58:52] distress between nations and all kinds
[58:54] of things happening." He said,
[58:56] "Sometimes I feel like I'm getting
[58:57] engulfike." He said, "Everywhere I look,
[59:00] it's like a ship out on the sea. And
[59:03] I've been given charge of the boat. And
[59:05] how are we going to make it? Here comes
[59:06] a big white capund times bigger than my
[59:09] ship. But we were we will crest every
[59:13] one of them.
[59:15] We are more than victors through Christ.
[59:17] The captain, the chief captain has got a
[59:20] hold of the string at the end of the
[59:21] ship and he's going to pull us through
[59:23] every time.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, that gives me great confidence to
[59:28] know. You know, I always get amused by
[59:30] people that says Jesus is my co-pilot.
[59:32] No, no, no, no. He ain't my co-pilot.
[59:35] He's my pilot.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't need a co-pilot. I need a
[59:40] pilot.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; And I sure don't want to be the pilot of
[59:43] my life. if I'll get myself in a wreck
[59:45] in a jam really quick if I go along the
[59:47] way Timothy thinks it ought to be or how
[59:49] Timothy ought to do this or how No, I
[59:52] want what the word thinks it ought to
[59:53] be.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Random talks about a poem a
[1:00:00] couple of times he read in school in the
[1:00:03] school book. He says a little boy when I
[1:00:06] was a little boy there many he said many
[1:00:09] of you my age may remember it. I don't
[1:00:12] know if there's anybody here his age or
[1:00:13] would be his age. What would he be now?
[1:00:19] 20 somewhere around there.
[1:00:22] Yeah. Ain't nobody here that age.
[1:00:25] But I don't know if you ever heard the
[1:00:26] belie. He's talking about Christopher
[1:00:27] Columbus was given ships
[1:00:30] because in his heart he saw a vision
[1:00:33] that the world was round and he had
[1:00:36] hated because in that day they thought
[1:00:38] it was flat and somehow we got back to
[1:00:40] that. I don't understand that. Go back
[1:00:43] 400 years. Well, why don't you go back
[1:00:45] to horse and buggy and everything else?
[1:00:47] Why don't you go back to science 400
[1:00:49] years ago and live like that? Why don't
[1:00:51] you go to a doctor 400 years ago?
[1:00:55] Hello.
[1:00:56] I don't understand anybody like that.
[1:00:58] Sorry. Not sorry. But anyway, he didn't
[1:01:01] believe the world was flat. He believed
[1:01:03] it was round.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; And so he gets these ships and given a
[1:01:07] bunch of prisoners and cowards. That was
[1:01:09] his church members.
[1:01:11] A bunch of pullbacks, a bunch that was
[1:01:14] discouraged and tried to discourage him.
[1:01:16] Just a little longer and we're going to
[1:01:18] drop off the world. Just a little
[1:01:19] longer. and a serpent going to rise up
[1:01:21] from the bottom of the sea and going to
[1:01:23] wrap his big arms around us and pull us
[1:01:25] up from the pull us down to the bottom.
[1:01:27] He said, "But I say, brave Rover, what
[1:01:29] do you say?" He said, "Sail on.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Sail on." You know, I went back and
[1:01:36] looked up that, if you give me just a
[1:01:38] few minutes, I went back and looked up
[1:01:39] that poem. It's kind of kind of
[1:01:41] interesting. Says, "Behind him lay the
[1:01:43] gray Azores, which is the outward
[1:01:46] islands off the shore of Portugal.
[1:01:49] Behind the gates of Hercules beho before
[1:01:53] him not even the ghost of shores
[1:01:58] before him only shoreless seas. The good
[1:02:01] mate said now we must pray for lo the
[1:02:04] very stars are gone. Brave admiral
[1:02:07] speak. What shall I say? Why I say? I
[1:02:10] say sell off. Sell on and on. My men
[1:02:15] grow m mutinous day by day. My men grow
[1:02:18] ghastly wine and weak. The stout mate
[1:02:22] thought of home. A spray of salt waves
[1:02:25] washed his sworthy cheek. What shall I
[1:02:28] say? Brave admiral say if we my if we
[1:02:31] sight not but seize at dawn
[1:02:34] why you shall say at the break of day
[1:02:37] sail on sail on and on. They sailed and
[1:02:42] sailed as winds might blow until at last
[1:02:45] the blanch mates said, "Why now not even
[1:02:49] God would know should I and all my men
[1:02:52] fall dead."
[1:02:54] The very winds forgot their way. For God
[1:02:57] from these dead seas is gone. Now speak,
[1:03:00] brave admiral. Speak and say. He said,
[1:03:03] "Sell on, sell on, and on." They sailed.
[1:03:06] They sailed. Then spake the mate. This
[1:03:09] mad sea shows his teeth tonight. He
[1:03:12] curls his lips. He lies in weight with
[1:03:14] lifted teeth as if to bite. Brave
[1:03:16] admiral say but one good word. What
[1:03:19] shall we do when hope is gone? The words
[1:03:22] leapt like a leaping sword. Sail on,
[1:03:25] sail on and on and on. Then pale and
[1:03:29] worn, he kept his deck and peered
[1:03:31] through the darkness all that night of
[1:03:34] all dark nights. And then a speck, a
[1:03:36] light, a light, at last a light. It
[1:03:39] grew. A starlet flag unfurled. It grew
[1:03:41] to be times burst of dawn. He gained a
[1:03:44] world and he gave that world its
[1:03:47] grandest blessing. Sell on. Sell on.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; There was a lot of opportunities there
[1:03:54] to give up.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; There was a lot of opportunities to just
[1:03:59] turn around and and say, you know what,
[1:04:01] maybe that was not a good idea. I I just
[1:04:04] don't think, you know, he had a lot to
[1:04:06] lose on this situation. But there was
[1:04:08] something on the inside of him that
[1:04:10] realized no, there's another path. I
[1:04:13] believe that this earth is not how they
[1:04:14] say it is. I believe it's you can go on
[1:04:17] around. He actually thought he would go
[1:04:18] on around and sell right back. You know,
[1:04:20] he didn't know that new world was there.
[1:04:22] He didn't know none of that. But he
[1:04:23] believed he would just go right back and
[1:04:25] come right back around. And so he he
[1:04:27] just kept going and going. What was it?
[1:04:29] It was something on the inside of him
[1:04:31] that beyond all the waves, beyond all
[1:04:34] the darkness, beyond the days. Listen,
[1:04:36] now they can make it across. I believe
[1:04:38] that the captain told me about 29 days.
[1:04:40] 26 29 days they can sail from the east
[1:04:43] coast over to England. It used to take
[1:04:45] almost uh about six three to six months
[1:04:47] depending on where winds and things.
[1:04:49] That was a long time not to see land. It
[1:04:52] was a long time out there and all you
[1:04:54] seen was water and know all the
[1:04:56] imaginations that could take place cuz
[1:04:57] they didn't know what was down in that
[1:04:59] ocean. They didn't know how big the
[1:05:01] beasts were that were down there. They
[1:05:03] didn't know. They didn't know all the
[1:05:04] same. Well, they're still finding them
[1:05:05] today.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; But there was something on him that
[1:05:10] said, "I don't care what they say. Sail
[1:05:13] on." And brother Brandon makes this
[1:05:14] statement. He says, "Give us men in the
[1:05:17] church just like that."
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. that no matter what the scientific
[1:05:23] world says and no matter what the church
[1:05:25] world says, I'll take God's word and I'm
[1:05:28] going to sail on.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to sail until I pass every
[1:05:33] barrier. I'm going to sail till I pass
[1:05:35] every barrier of sin and I I sail past
[1:05:38] every barrier of sickness and I sail
[1:05:40] past the veil of this old body and I
[1:05:43] step into a new dimension.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there's a new world out
[1:05:48] there.
[1:05:52] Oh,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; there might be a lot of monsters in our
[1:05:54] way, but God is with us.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; So, we used to in the old church here,
[1:06:03] he said, you used to sing a little song.
[1:06:05] Said, I crossed the separated line. I've
[1:06:07] left the world behind. He said, if there
[1:06:09] was ever a time that the church needs to
[1:06:12] step across that line, which separates
[1:06:15] you between faith and unbelief by sight?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Hear what the prophet said.
[1:06:21] Step across the line that separates you
[1:06:24] that separates you between faith and
[1:06:26] unbelief by sight and look at the unseen
[1:06:30] by faith. It's now.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; It is now. Amen. He preached that almost
[1:06:35] 60 70 years ago. Well, if it was now
[1:06:38] then, it's now. Now.
[1:06:41] We need it more than ever to quit
[1:06:43] looking at what we can see and look at
[1:06:45] the world and all the things around us
[1:06:47] and say, "Look, I'm not a part of this
[1:06:49] old world. I'm a part of another world.
[1:06:52] I'm going to sail to that other side."
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "When you can do that, that's
[1:07:01] when you leave everything behind you.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Every care, every worry, everything that
[1:07:07] says you can't be a Christian. That's
[1:07:09] right.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I smoked too long. I drank too
[1:07:13] long. You can put whatever sin you want
[1:07:15] to right there. Whatever form of
[1:07:16] unbelief you want to put. I've done this
[1:07:18] too long. I I've lived in adultery too
[1:07:20] long. I don't care what you say and what
[1:07:22] you've done. Though your sins be as
[1:07:24] scarlet,
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; hello.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Though your sins be as scarlet,
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; you can be made white as snow.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:36] Once you pass the line of the barrier of
[1:07:39] that devil that's trying to torment you
[1:07:42] and say you can't do it, you can't do
[1:07:44] it. You won't make it. There ain't no
[1:07:46] new land out there. It's just a fairy
[1:07:48] tale in a sand castle. There ain't a new
[1:07:50] body. There ain't a new hope. There
[1:07:52] ain't no hope for you. And you sail past
[1:07:55] all of that.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; And you say, I can do it.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Why can't I do it? Jesus said,
[1:08:04] "Whosoever will let him come and drink,
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; I can be free of this sin. I can be free
[1:08:11] of this demonic oppression, I can be
[1:08:13] free of this thing, I can." Why? Cuz he
[1:08:16] said I could.
[1:08:20] said, "When you people that are sick and
[1:08:23] you plowed through prayer line after
[1:08:25] prayer line and you've been prayed for
[1:08:27] and you've been to doctors and you've
[1:08:29] done everything and still death stays at
[1:08:31] your door, you'll get to the place that
[1:08:33] you say, "I don't care what the doctor
[1:08:35] says. I don't care what the scientific
[1:08:37] world say. Jesus Christ made a promise
[1:08:39] and you pass that barrier of vibrations
[1:08:42] to your soul that you're free. There's
[1:08:44] not one thing that'll shake you no more.
[1:08:47] You'll sail to your healing just as
[1:08:49] certain as I'm standing in this pull
[1:08:50] pit.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You'll never turn to look
[1:08:55] that way no more. You'll be looking this
[1:08:57] way. You're free from them things that
[1:08:59] say divine healing's over or days of
[1:09:01] miracles are passed or there's no such a
[1:09:03] thing as that anymore. You can't get
[1:09:05] well. Your case is too bad. Sail up
[1:09:07] above it.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; There's a word you can sail up to. What
[1:09:11] is that word? I'm the Lord God that
[1:09:13] heals all thy diseases.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Climb the walls under until you're free.
[1:09:19] Every rope, every feather has been cut
[1:09:21] loose. Every vibration left and you're
[1:09:24] free and free indeed.
[1:09:29] As I said,
[1:09:31] sailboat is like wings on an airplane or
[1:09:33] like wings on a bird.
[1:09:36] Brother Brandham
[1:09:38] was up in Colorado.
[1:09:42] where he used to run some cattle and he
[1:09:43] was in the timber line there and a storm
[1:09:45] had came big big big big storm blowdowns
[1:09:48] blew a lot of stuff down. He said after
[1:09:50] the storm passed it rained a while then
[1:09:53] it snowed a while and then the sun come
[1:09:55] out storms coming like that in the fall
[1:09:57] of the year.
[1:09:59] He said, "So I was standing behind this
[1:10:02] storm as it went past and after the
[1:10:04] storm went past, the sun peeped out,
[1:10:06] looking down through those crevices and
[1:10:09] turned cold and the water froze
[1:10:10] evergreen." And there was a rainbow that
[1:10:13] came over the valley. I thought, "My,
[1:10:15] there's God in that rainbow for he made
[1:10:18] a promise."
[1:10:20] Said, "Sometimes you just get along by
[1:10:21] yourself sometime and think it over
[1:10:24] about his promises and things and see
[1:10:26] how close God can get to you."
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] After a while, he heard a elk bugle and
[1:10:32] got lost from the herd maybe during the
[1:10:34] storm was bugling and old gray wolf
[1:10:36] howled up on the mountain. His maid
[1:10:38] answered he said it was like David said
[1:10:40] when a deep callth in a deep there's a
[1:10:42] deep to respond.
[1:10:45] He said my mother's half Indian and he
[1:10:46] said my conversion never took that out
[1:10:49] of me. something that's real. When when
[1:10:51] you get out in nature and standing
[1:10:52] there, I put my hands up in the air and
[1:10:53] I said, "Oh, great creator who made
[1:10:56] heavens and earth. How great thou art to
[1:10:58] let me let me even be here? Why can't
[1:11:01] why can't I always stay here? Just let
[1:11:03] me live here. This this end this is the
[1:11:05] end I was born for." Felt almost I guess
[1:11:08] like the apostles did on the mountain
[1:11:09] transfiguration. Must have been a
[1:11:10] wonderful time.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Let's build three tabernacles, you know.
[1:11:14] But at the bottom of that mountain, of
[1:11:15] course, is the sick and needy. And while
[1:11:18] I was thinking on that, I noticed this
[1:11:19] little old pine squirrel jumped up on
[1:11:21] this little blow down limb and made the
[1:11:23] awfulest noise you ever chatter,
[1:11:25] chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter,
[1:11:26] chatter, chatter. Thought, well, my god,
[1:11:28] why would you take my attention off all
[1:11:30] of that and notice this little old
[1:11:31] squirrel making all this ragged?
[1:11:34] And while he's bouncing up and down like
[1:11:36] he's going to kill everything in the
[1:11:37] woods, just all noise though, you know,
[1:11:39] nothing to him. And after he's bouncing
[1:11:41] around, I've been saying, "Praise the
[1:11:44] Lord, my hands up." And I guess if they
[1:11:46] had had somebody in the woods, they
[1:11:47] thought a maniac was there, but I didn't
[1:11:48] care. I was worshiping God.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, in the woods or church,
[1:11:53] what does it matter?
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who made the heavens? I was
[1:11:57] worshiping the God that made the heavens
[1:11:59] and the earth. But I was just watching
[1:12:00] this little squirrel and and and I
[1:12:04] thought, why why why did he attract my
[1:12:05] attention to this? What what what would
[1:12:08] be godly about that fell? What's the
[1:12:10] matter in a storm? But he said, "I
[1:12:13] noticed over there what he was looking
[1:12:14] at." And he said, "There was a storm had
[1:12:15] blowed down this big old eagle
[1:12:18] down in the rubbish of the blowdown."
[1:12:21] This big eagle had jumped up on a limb.
[1:12:24] I thought, God,
[1:12:27] you know, how how would you what's
[1:12:29] what's in this eagle for me now? And
[1:12:31] little squirrel. I thought, man, well,
[1:12:33] that's godly because, you know, he's not
[1:12:36] scared. God don't want anybody to be
[1:12:38] scared about talking about the eagle.
[1:12:39] was not scared of this pine squirrel
[1:12:40] making all his racket, you know, and
[1:12:43] this eagle was not afraid. And I
[1:12:45] thought, well, why? Why? Why are you not
[1:12:46] afraid? What? And I began to notice he
[1:12:50] was taking his feathers and he was kind
[1:12:52] of moving his wings a little bit and he
[1:12:55] just kind of moving his arm his wings
[1:12:56] back and forth. I thought, that's it,
[1:12:59] God. If you give that eagle confidence
[1:13:01] enough in his wings to know that he can
[1:13:03] get away from me
[1:13:05] in just a blink like that, he said, "How
[1:13:07] much more ought the church or a person?"
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; As long as we know the Holy Spirit is
[1:13:13] around us, how much more can the spirit
[1:13:15] of God deliver us than the eagle can be
[1:13:19] delivered by his natural wings?
[1:13:22] If a eagle has that much faith in his
[1:13:25] natural wings, how much faith would
[1:13:27] should should we have in the wind that
[1:13:29] lifts us up?
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "I noticed him." He didn't seem
[1:13:35] like I was interrupting him so much and
[1:13:37] I thought, "Don't you know, Eagle, I
[1:13:39] could shoot you?"
[1:13:41] I have big old gray eyes. Just looked at
[1:13:43] me and could you imagine this
[1:13:44] conversation? Don't you know I could
[1:13:46] shoot you? He knew I wasn't going to
[1:13:49] shoot him. And if I reached for my guns,
[1:13:51] he'd flop them wings and look and he'd
[1:13:54] look up and then he'd look up like that
[1:13:55] and he'd look at me and he'd look up and
[1:13:58] I thought, "Oh, God, truly, you're
[1:13:59] everywhere. You're in the bird. You're
[1:14:01] in the rainbow. You're in the wolf.
[1:14:02] You're in the elk. You're everywhere."
[1:14:04] But I noticed after a while, he got
[1:14:07] enough of that chatter, chatter,
[1:14:08] chatter.
[1:14:10] He just made a big jump and flop those
[1:14:13] wings about twice. And I seen something
[1:14:14] happen that'd be a lesson for us all.
[1:14:16] He'd ever try to flop back and forth.
[1:14:18] flop, flop, flop. He just knew how to
[1:14:20] set his wings.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; And every time the wind would come up
[1:14:25] that mountain, it would just take him
[1:14:28] higher and higher and higher until he
[1:14:31] was nothing but a little spot.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And I stood there and I began to weep
[1:14:36] for I thought that's it, God. It isn't
[1:14:38] join this or do this or leave this or
[1:14:40] run over here and or go to this
[1:14:42] Pentecostal church. do is knowing how to
[1:14:45] set your faith in the ways of the Holy
[1:14:48] Spirit.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; It's knowing how to set your faith in
[1:14:52] the ways of the Holy Spirit. And right
[1:14:54] away from this chatter, chatter here and
[1:14:57] there. This chatter that says days of
[1:14:59] miracles are passed. This chatter that
[1:15:01] says there's no such a thing as the Holy
[1:15:03] Ghost. This chatter that says there's no
[1:15:05] such a thing as divine healing. This
[1:15:07] chatter that says you won't make it.
[1:15:09] Come on.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; This chatter that says this message
[1:15:11] ain't for you and you're just born to be
[1:15:13] a child of the devil. This is a lot of
[1:15:16] chatter going off.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; This chatter that says your family's
[1:15:19] going to be destroyed. This chatter that
[1:15:21] says your marriage is going to be
[1:15:23] destroyed. This chatter that says your
[1:15:25] children are going to go out into the
[1:15:27] world and never come back. That's a lot
[1:15:29] of chatter. But let me tell you, if
[1:15:30] you'll learn how to set those wings,
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. That's why you got to come
[1:15:37] to services. That's why you got to get
[1:15:39] in the tapes. That's why you got to read
[1:15:41] your Bible is get into the air of the
[1:15:44] Holy Spirit and lift those hands up and
[1:15:47] say, "God, I'm here for one thing.
[1:15:50] I'm here to leave all this chatter. I'm
[1:15:52] here to leave all this hellbound earth.
[1:15:55] I'm here to leave all the thinking of
[1:15:57] this world and rise above it all.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Get away from all this old earthbound
[1:16:06] chatter.
[1:16:08] Well, you can't have that no more. That
[1:16:10] ain't the way God operates no more, will
[1:16:12] you? Chatter, chatter, chatter.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Well, that's just rock and roll music.
[1:16:16] Bunch of chatter.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Chatter. A lot of chattering going on. A
[1:16:25] lot of pine squirrels in the message.
[1:16:31] Oh, mercy. Well, you know, God used to
[1:16:35] work like that.
[1:16:37] And God used to do this. You know, I
[1:16:39] thought about it so many times. How many
[1:16:41] times that we've prayed for people who
[1:16:43] says their church, you know, Baptist
[1:16:45] people that,
[1:16:47] thank God I can still say that Baptist,
[1:16:49] not message, but I probably could say
[1:16:51] that too, but Baptist people said they
[1:16:53] their church don't pray for the sick no
[1:16:55] more.
[1:16:59] You know, I always think about the man
[1:17:00] that would come to one of the deacons at
[1:17:02] the camp there in in Scottville and
[1:17:04] said, "We used to have services like
[1:17:06] this.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Too many pine squirrels got in.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Shut down the music, the moving of the
[1:17:13] Holy Spirit.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Shut down the winds of where eagles
[1:17:16] could move up into the heavenlies again.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; That's why we can't ever we can't ever
[1:17:21] stand for anything that'll shut down the
[1:17:23] moving of the Holy Ghost. We got to have
[1:17:26] the moving of the Holy Ghost to leave
[1:17:27] this place.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; We got to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:33] Ghost moving in our services for us to
[1:17:36] even take a body change.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; We got to have him moving in our lives.
[1:17:41] We got to have him moving in our
[1:17:43] situation. We can't ever stand for any
[1:17:45] formal or cold. Amen. Denominational
[1:17:48] idea. Amen. Whether it be a message,
[1:17:51] denominational idea, or whatever, we
[1:17:53] cannot stand for it.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; We have to be willing to take our our
[1:17:58] stand upon the word of God and say, "No,
[1:18:00] I believe that God is the same
[1:18:02] yesterday, today, and forever." And if
[1:18:04] God wants to move, I say move.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz I need to leave some chatter behind.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but the devil
[1:18:13] been chattering in my ear a lot here
[1:18:14] lately. He been telling me all kinds of
[1:18:17] things in my life. But I'm here to tell
[1:18:18] you, I got two wings.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; I got the Old and the New Testament.
[1:18:25] Amen. That God has given me the word of
[1:18:27] God that I can depend upon in my time,
[1:18:30] in my situation. And all I got to do is
[1:18:32] open up those wings and let the winds of
[1:18:35] the Holy Ghost begin to blow. And it's
[1:18:37] going to lift me up above my depression,
[1:18:40] above my thinking, above my thoughts,
[1:18:42] above my ideas, above what I want to do
[1:18:45] or don't want to do. It'll lift me up in
[1:18:47] the heavenly of heavens.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Get away from that old earthbound
[1:18:53] chatter. That chatter is trying to keep
[1:18:56] you earthbound.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Chatter chatter here and chatter chatter
[1:19:03] there. Just set your wings in the power
[1:19:06] of the Holy Spirit and let him carry
[1:19:09] above this old chatter noise of there
[1:19:11] ain't no such a thing. The eagle knew
[1:19:14] what he was doing and what he could
[1:19:16] trust.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Just set your wings and say, "Jesus
[1:19:20] Christ, I love you."
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Can we do that tonight? Set those wings
[1:19:25] in that.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; I trust you. And hold these blessed old
[1:19:31] two-wing book here and just fly away for
[1:19:34] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:19:35] forever. It's just setting your wings,
[1:19:38] your faith wings in the power of the
[1:19:41] Holy Ghost.
[1:19:44] Cuz like listen,
[1:19:46] if that eagle would never set his wings,
[1:19:49] the wind could have blowed all he wanted
[1:19:50] to blow,
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; It could have blowed all it want to
[1:19:55] blow. He still sat on that old log.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; That's what happens sometimes. times. We
[1:20:01] got a lot of eagles sometimes that the
[1:20:02] wind of the Holy Spirit will blow
[1:20:04] through here and they just kind of keep
[1:20:05] their old wings down.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; No, no. We want those wings lifted up.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Let the Lord lift us up above these
[1:20:13] shadows.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Lift us up. Lift us up above this world.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Lift us up above days of miracles or
[1:20:22] pass. Lift us up above the thought of
[1:20:24] just a bunch of holy rollers.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Who cares?
[1:20:30] Well, good.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; I' I've said it before, say it again.
[1:20:35] You know, people some people want to
[1:20:36] call us Pentecostal because of our music
[1:20:37] and our worship and then meanwhile
[1:20:39] they're dead as a doornail and can't
[1:20:41] hardly clap their hands, won't lift
[1:20:43] their lift their hands, won't hardly
[1:20:44] sing, shout, do nothing. Well, I can
[1:20:46] tell you this. If nothing else, I'm a
[1:20:48] couple church ages ahead of you.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; But we heard Sunday, that ain't the
[1:20:56] church age we're emulating. That ain't
[1:20:59] the age we are. We're we're going back
[1:21:00] to the first age,
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; seed to seed,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. But listen, they will get
[1:21:07] beyond all these things. Get beyond the
[1:21:09] thoughts of how somebody else thinks
[1:21:11] service ought to be or how somebody
[1:21:12] thinks your worship ought to be or how
[1:21:14] somebody thinks worship ought to be in
[1:21:16] general. Get past it all.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; It's me and you, Jesus. I love you.
[1:21:20] You've done something for me.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, Brother Brandon
[1:21:26] wasn't just that kind of way. just out
[1:21:27] in the woods.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; No, no. He He said he said somebody
[1:21:32] found him out there thought he's a
[1:21:33] maniac. Well, listen. He found himself
[1:21:35] out in the middle of his aisle with a
[1:21:36] with his pant legs pulled up one time.
[1:21:38] Come to himself.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Found himself on top of sitting on top
[1:21:41] of a pull pit one time
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; with his hands up in the air.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a service right there,
[1:21:49] ain't it?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; We ain't got that wild wild yet.
[1:21:55] I've been here a lot of times. I ain't
[1:21:57] seen a preacher yet sit on top of this
[1:21:58] pull pit.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; I ain't seen one yet out in the middle
[1:22:01] of his aisle with his pants pulled up.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Just saying.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; People want to judge us and judge our
[1:22:08] our worship and judge our music and
[1:22:10] judge this. Why don't you just try it
[1:22:12] for yourself and see how you feel?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll realize it'll kind of lift
[1:22:17] you up a little bit and get out of your
[1:22:18] wy wowy woos.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. and your self-righteous,
[1:22:22] stiff neck attitude and rise up above
[1:22:25] those things.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Just set your wings in the power of God.
[1:22:32] Let the Holy Ghost rise you above it.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Let him rise you above it. That's one
[1:22:38] thing about a rudder. You know, a
[1:22:40] rudder. Yes, we believe the rudder is
[1:22:42] Christ as he directed us. That that's
[1:22:43] one thing, but there's also a part of
[1:22:45] that that you play with your hand on it.
[1:22:47] Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; The captain's got his hand on the
[1:22:52] rudder, right? Or the steering wheel
[1:22:53] which controls the rudder.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; It's a part of flesh there, too, that
[1:22:57] you got to watch. Because if you see
[1:22:59] yourself getting off course, it ain't
[1:23:01] because Jesus turned the rudder.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; That was just for free. That was extra.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; But let the Holy Ghost, let him rise you
[1:23:15] above it.
[1:23:17] We
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; come to church sometimes all soured up
[1:23:19] and tore up and then we leave just worse
[1:23:22] and soured up and more tore up. We
[1:23:24] didn't let the Holy Ghost let us rise as
[1:23:27] above it.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to be fake.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; What's that got to do with being fake?
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; I want to be real.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; I want to be a real Christian.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; I want to be somebody that really loves
[1:23:41] the Lord. And then somebody that really
[1:23:44] loves the Lord will worship him. No
[1:23:45] matter if they're down in the valley or
[1:23:47] they're up on the top of a mountain.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; It won't matter if they're in the winds
[1:23:51] or the waves or the howling storms. It
[1:23:53] doesn't matter. They will worship God
[1:23:55] anyhow.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram tells a story about a
[1:23:59] boat that was going down a ship out in
[1:24:01] the middle of the ocean made a call in
[1:24:03] for Mayday. Mayday and and they was
[1:24:05] having some jazz music playing and the
[1:24:07] captain said, "Change the music. Change
[1:24:09] it. Change it up. play near my God to
[1:24:11] thee.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Everybody, you pray like you're in
[1:24:15] church and you're needing something from
[1:24:17] God. Start praying. We're not going to
[1:24:19] make it. But there was this one woman on
[1:24:21] that boat. She was walking up down
[1:24:23] saying, "Praise God.
[1:24:25] Hallelujah. Praise God." The captain
[1:24:29] said, "What is wrong with you? We need
[1:24:30] people praying, not praising."
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; She said, "Listen here, captain." She
[1:24:35] said, "I ain't worried about this ship
[1:24:37] going down." She said, "I gave my son my
[1:24:40] soul to God a long time ago." Said, "I
[1:24:42] got a daughter in New York. If I get
[1:24:44] there, I'll see her. If I go down to the
[1:24:45] bottom of this ocean, I got a daughter
[1:24:47] waiting for me there. Either way, I'm
[1:24:48] going to win and I'm going to praise him
[1:24:50] while I'm in the storm."
[1:24:54] Hallelujah. How about you tonight? No
[1:24:56] matter what, no matter what goes on, I'm
[1:24:59] going to win. I'm going to win this
[1:25:01] fight. I'm going to win this war. I'm
[1:25:04] going to rise above it all.
[1:25:08] That's right.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Church will not be defeated.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to flop from place to
[1:25:13] place. So, I'll go over and see this.
[1:25:14] I'll go do that. He just knew how to set
[1:25:17] his wings.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do about divine
[1:25:20] healing, about the Holy Ghost, is how
[1:25:22] you set your faith in the power and
[1:25:26] promises of God. It will pack you right
[1:25:29] up
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; and you'll just go right on up. Every
[1:25:33] time it blows in, you'll rise higher and
[1:25:35] higher and higher till you're able to
[1:25:37] hear. Not able no more to hear chatter,
[1:25:40] chatter, chatter. You'll not even pay
[1:25:42] attention to it no more cuz you'll be
[1:25:45] out of hearing distance.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm ready to be out of
[1:25:50] hearing distance of that old devil.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; What a day that's going to be.

[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Out of here distance.

[1:26:03] more doubts. No more fears. No more
[1:26:05] unbeliefs. No more sorrows. No more sin.
[1:26:07] No more mind battles. No more nothing
[1:26:10] that the devil's got to offer.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Peace and love,
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; joy. That's not a sand castle.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; That's not a fairy tale.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; That's thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's something there you can set your
[1:26:24] wings into.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand together.
[1:26:33] I make can say tonight, Lord, help me to
[1:26:36] set my wings in the winds of faith.
[1:26:38] Let's sing that, brother Andrew. Wings
[1:26:40] of winds of faith.
[1:26:43] Hallelujah. I want to rise up a little
[1:26:46] higher tonight. I want to rise up and
[1:26:48] all things are possible.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to cross that separating
[1:26:52] line between my doubts,
[1:26:56] what I see by my eyesight, and my
[1:26:58] thoughts. and what I can see by the eyes
[1:27:01] of faith, the unseen.
[1:27:05] Let me see what you see, Jesus.
[1:27:08] You know what Jesus saw in that
[1:27:10] situation? He said, "Let us go to the
[1:27:11] other side." He said, "Because over on
[1:27:13] the other side, there was a soul waiting
[1:27:15] on him."
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; That's what he saw.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; He didn't care about the winds and the
[1:27:21] waves. He worried about he want that
[1:27:22] soul that was on the other side.
[1:27:27] Sometimes you don't know the winds and
[1:27:28] the waves are just carrying you to the
[1:27:31] spot that Jesus is wanting you to be.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Things are moving. Winds are moving. And
[1:27:37] just let just adjust your faith a little
[1:27:39] bit to believe, you know, God's in this
[1:27:42] situation somehow.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know how, but he's in it. He
[1:27:46] promised he would. He promised he'd
[1:27:47] never leave me.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; He's with me. He never forsake me.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to adjust my faith a
[1:27:53] little bit to catch a little bit more
[1:27:54] wind. There you go.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; And get out of here.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing this together.

[1:28:07] you may take.
