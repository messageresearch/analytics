you with all of our hearts and thank you for the opportunity to serve you in the time we're living in thank you for the call of God in our life thank you for calling us and believing in us that we could stand in this evil day or we love you with all of our hearts in Jesus name amen turn to Galatians 5 and verse 1. amen it's good to be back home with you again even if it's just for a moment me and sister Ruth and sister Katie and I think sister Rebecca is going with us tomorrow we're going to be up in Missouri this weekend ministering it brother Ben Beard's church it was formerly brother Harold Browns and and um I just ask you to pray for us then we'll be home for a little while and be looking forward to that but we had a good time while we was away was that brother Josh Bennett's dedication meeting and just had a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord and God done some wonderful things there they have a beautiful building that the Lord has has given them and and uh and and they moved from a little small little place into then covered struck and had to go into a gymnasium and then different things happen and their Church grew and they wasn't able to even thinking about think about going back to where they came from and but God had greater plans and they have a nice build a nice facility there and we thank the Lord for that then we went to brother Donnie Reagan's dedication there at the Word of Life Tabernacle and and that's a beautiful place as well that the Lord has given and we thank the Lord for all that he's done something struck me very uh you know a lot of people get tangled up and thinking that we ought not have nice churches and things and you know we not do too many nice things but but Don he said somebody had sent him something on what the Tabernacle in the wilderness cost you heard it didn't you 330 million dollars for a tent that's quite incredible and then then the building the Temple was 30 billion dollars uh God doesn't mind spending money on his own place and I believe we ought to have something nice for him and you know it really ain't the building it's the people right amen that's what makes it all and then as brother Tim would preach their first night on Friday night I'm sure you heard it but the building is just an empty building and just just a gathering of people if it's not for the glory of God there and that's what we want is the glory of God Among Us amen let's read here in Galatians 5 and verse 1 says Stand Fast therefore and the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage amen we let you be seated you know I yesterday we had July the 4th and it's has been quite a holiday in our country for some time men or women are kind of turning against it now in the time that we're living in and and not really wanting to celebrate the freedoms that we have enjoyed for many years and we definitely see this land that was raised up as a lamb is beginning to speak as a dragon and they're coming against the freedoms that were given us by men who had Faith uh men of faith that would rise up against the church and the Tyranny that was there in their land and so we want to land where we can worship God as we would want to worship God and we could give God the glory and honor that he deserved in the way that we want to and so they would by faith they would get on boats and they would come across a great ocean and they would begin to search out and find a place and they begin to you know as as the nation was formed and I'm not going to go into all of that we have a little bit of History here but uh you know they wrote out the uh the the Declaration of Independence and then the Constitution and all those things in the thought of freedom and the thought of a man being free they knew what it was like to be under oppression and to do things a certain way and and to only be able to serve God in certain manners and so they wanted a place where man could be free and and I'm thankful for this country that we have and and God has used it in many ways and we know that that what is what its end is going to be but that's because of Prophecy but you know God raised it up for a purpose and and he raised it up for a place and a time and man that God could use it in the time and manner that he has but you know I got to thinking about freedom and how men and women are coming against it and and calling it different things and I'm not going to get into the political side of it but I thought about you know thinking about this day of how many men gave their lives and women gave their lives that we could have this Freedom uh you know I want to speak about that the cost of freedom because Freedom has a price freedom is not free someone died that we could have freedom you know Freedom means to be one who is not a slave one who has ceased to be a slave who is freed amen is exempt unrestrained not Bound by obligation but somebody amen had to die that we could have the freedom that we enjoyed today now as I said we see it going away very quickly and you know but I got to looking at different things that men have said down through history and one struck me as John F Kennedy he would say the cost of freedom is always high but Americans have always paid it but one path we will never choose and that is the path of surrender or submission and I thought you know that's a wonderful thought because you know there is a cost of freedom but there is also a cost of surrender there's also a cost of submission but you know you know does freedom have a cost and I just want to go through a few things as we begin to look at this thought you know it says ask the question again of the remnants of that same second ranger battalion that's now reinforced and assigned to a hill 400 in eastern France late in November the first Army had already thrown four divisions at the the hill 400 with crushing losses the conditions were even worse than at the point still the Rangers went in knowing the risk outnumbered ten to one their original strength of three full companies eventually were reduced to just five officers and 86 men but they took that hill in two days The Cost of Freedom is not able to be calculated amen ask the 19 year old teenagers the average age of the first U.S Marine Division who landed August the 7th 1942 on the North shore shore of Guadalcanal a small tropical island not far from Australia guatem Canal was the first time that Americans forces stopped the Japanese sweep in the South Pacific turning the tide of War 19 year old boys but at what cost under Fire during the landing the naval forces pulled away leaving these young marines without air support with most of their heavy weapons and tanks and all the rest of their supplies left with them but these young teenagers hung on in that rain-soaked malaria-ridden land fighting off snakes leeches jungle rot is well entrenched Army for the next six months Guadalcanal became hell for both the Young Marines and the Defenders when in early 1943 the Japanese pulled out only ten thousand soldiers were left of their original 400 or 40 000 the first Marines required a full year of Rehabilitation before they could be called a fighting unit again having lost many thousands dead and wounded The Cost of Freedom cannot be calculated amen he said think of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 individually each of them had more to lose and to gain by signing this document most of them were already men of standing in their communities Highly Educated owners of substantial property John Hancock the richest man in America became a wanted man with a price on his head they did not choose to revolt they were mainly meanly merely wanting to be treated the same as other Englishmen in the that were in England but they all knew that the pennant what the penalty was for treason it was death by hanging but each signer immediately become a Marked Man Pursuit relentlessly by the re by the British army not none who had property or family were spared most lived to see their families killed separated forever their property sacked nine signers died of wounds or hardships during the war many died in poverty the fathers of our country their pledge Our lives our Fortune our sacred honor was no Idol boasts The Cost of Freedom cannot be calculated hey man you know it it comes with a price it comes with a call so I think we're up to 1.4 million men that have died Amen in the fight for freedom but Patrick Henry we know the the last few lines of his of his speech it says give me libertarian give me death but this man stood to lose a lot when he stood here and he gave this gave this speech but I want you to hear it in its entirety says if we were base enough to desire it is it now too late to retire from the contest there is no retreat but in submission and slavery amen our chains are already forged they're clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston the war is an inedible and let it come I repeat sir let it come it is in vain sir to extenuate the matter gentlemen May Cry peace peace but there is no peace the war is actually already begun the next Gale that sweets from the north will bring to our ears there's a clash of resounding arms our Brethren are already in the field why stand here till we die why stand here Idol what is that gentleman's wish what would they have it's life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of change and slavery forbid it almighty God I know not what course my others may take but as for me Give me liberty or give me death in other words if it ain't Liberty then Chain's away slavery awaits so there is a cost of freedom but there's also a cost to not accepting the freedom or not fighting for the freedom amen there is a cause to have freedom and liberty in the house of God but there's also a cost and and a change that comes with it for not standing and fighting for having Liberty in the house of almighty God there is a cause for preaching the gospel but there's also a cause for not preaching the gospel amen there is a cause for living for this this life that we live but there's also a cause for not living the life that we live there is a cost of freedom and there and it's way it's a price is worth paying amen you know we're going to have wars we're going to it's already here you know you're not going to live a while a life without fighting I don't care what side you're on you're either going to fight your way to heaven or you're going to fight your way to hell come on now amen don't look out there in the world and think they got it easier no sir they got it worse amen they're living a life full of hell and full of anxieties and full of worries and they don't have nothing to stand upon their life is tore up from one end to the other they may be singing the brother they may be singing and shouting and carrying on all they want to and saying hey we said we're living a good life and drinking it up and partying up but they're paying the price the wages of sin or death amen there is a price that has to be paid no matter what size you take you know even the Bible and I I was looking at this this Bible came at cost we look at it today and well you know this is this is a really nice Bible my wife actually bought for me it's got goat skin leather and things and it's been a wonderful Bible That's lasted me a very long time you can buy one for about 300 bucks if you'd like to have it maybe get one for thirty dollars but it came for more than dollars it costs more than dollars amen you know there's many men that would actually why cliff and different ones that would work and give their lives for the translation of the Bible and but one man I want to read about is William Tyndale and what he went through you know he was found guilty of heresy and translate in the Bible from Greek to English he would and for for being guilty of doing that he was tied to a stake and he was strangled to death and burnt to ashes William Tyndale is popular known as the father of the English Bible a brilliant person who spoke 12 languages 12 languages fluently at 21. man I barely speak one of them amen many historians historians debate on his actual birth but not much is even known about his childhood but it is believed that according to Tyndale the church priests were not following the actual teachings of God amen amen thus misleading people amen one Catholic clergyman once once said to him we are better to be without God's law than the popes can you imagine this we are better to be without God's law than the Pope's law to this statement he responded if God spares me air many years I will cause a boy that drives a plow to know more of their scriptures than you do I'm thankful he was willing to pay the cost at some point he was ordained even as a priest and later a chaplain but remember nothing fighting evils nothing fighting frightens evil men more than a good man who's willing to stand in their way his sediments around religions threatened these leaders of the church and the authorities leading his dismissal as a man of values and principles he was willing to die for it his dismissal was a blessing in disguise because it gave him more time to translate the Bible so he there when he began to fully dedicate his life to studying and teaching the gospel and and begin to work among those that had this language bearing realize that these people needed the Bible in their own language see we know the people England they didn't speak or hear Greek or Hebrew and but that was what the Bible was written in or maybe Latin but they could understand that so the church could say whatever they wanted to say decree whatever they wanted to say do it however they wanted to do it and you couldn't do nothing about it because you didn't even know what the bible really said so he said I want to put the Bible in the people's hands and so he began to give his life to it and and The Possession back in the days of possession the Bible sacred and translating it without the king or The Bishop's permission was strictly forbidden and William headed to the bishop of London to Cuthbert Tunstall to seek consent but Tunstall refused to Grant his wishes devoted to the cause William wouldn't let anyone stand in his way and he secretly begin to search for people that had any form of print and equipment or connections lucky for him he found what several traders who were smuggling Martin Luther's writings from Germany and they encouraged him to flee from England to Europe and would help him smuggle the Bibles thereafter filled with happiness and fear William left England under a false name and began to work and head into Germany and begin to work and work and work knowing his life was at stake with every letter he wrote and it would begin to move from City to City from City to City you know and they tried to uh they tried to do whatever they could and and you know a lot of things went on and I I just get on down to it here there was a man he thought would be his friend and pretended to be his friend and it gained his confidence and eventually he turned him over to the authorities and he was put into prison and for over a year and many months behind bars his trials began to begin and William was accused of heresy that is believing among other things in the forgiveness of sin and that the mercy offered in the gospel was enough for salvation ah he believed that freedom had already been paid for but the church was trying to still get you to pay for Freedom this was their money line and they knew when people began to realize I don't have to pay for it it's already been paid for and so these were the heresies he was guilty of and he was sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake his last wish and prayer was Lord open the king of England's eyes a cry for Freedom amen as he was life was ending his out of his butt going out of his body freedom is not free this this holiday we just went through and fireworks went off and all kinds of things happen but for too many years people have taken their freedoms for granted thought they'd always be here and they'd always be that way and you know this is America no well America's turning and it's very quickly going to be going to become a place that don't have freedoms no longer it's going to turn to the dragon as you know as it was there and what they tried to leave is actually going to come again and be exactly what they left and it's going to begin and that's where when the tribulation hits and all that kind of stuff and all that how that works the Beast is going to come and and take lives amen they're going to realize hey you know I wish we still had those freedoms but of course you know men can be thinking say and a freedom is a you know and and they turn it into the license to do whatever they want and so that's where we're at in this nation now is it's not just the land of the free it's the land of the free to do whatever you want to do think however you want to think be how whatever you want to be if you want to be a dog bed if you want to be a cat bed if you want to be this you you just be what you want to be but that's not what this nation was built upon amen listen the nation how it was built amen it was only meant to be run by Christians it was only meant to be run by men who knew what true Freedom was it wasn't the license to sin and the license to do whatever you want to it was a license to live the freedom to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ but of course they turned it into what it is today and this nation is going to pots I mean it's gone there's no hope for it you can do whatever you want to you can pray for it and do whatever but it's it's prophesied Amen it's going to to burn so we know where it's headed but the greatest Price that was ever paid for freedom and there was only one that could pay it came in he came and done it at Calvary that's where the greatest price was paid that's one of the things God had required it no man was worthy no man was able no man could do it and God came himself was made human and lived a human life under human desires and was crucified at Calvary and that's where we are Satan thought he wouldn't do it he thought he wouldn't go through it and he went through it anyhow he stood every Temptation and he went through it just like all men why so he could pay the price and it was a price that only one man could ever pay [Music] the Brandon was saying like this he said it was a terrible day he said that day the sun looked funny there was never a day like it would never will be again it was a horrible thing the debt from Eden has to be paid it was a horrible day and we began to notice early in the morning he said I hear a noise coming down the street and I hear something going bump bump bump what is it it's an Old Rugged Cross and he said I see a little woman run out in front of him said what has he done what has he done but preached the gospel what has he done but heal the sick and I see a rough hand smack her in the mouth and say sit down would you believe that woman who's a prostitute before you'd believe you believe your priest she couldn't speak her peace his time had come for something else that cross was dragging for a purpose he had a robe over his shoulders and he started up the hill and I noticed little bitty red spots all over his coat wonder what they are his little weak body a crown of thorns on his head spit hanging down his face what had he done to deserve it nothing but he was paying my penalty he was paying your penalty and those spots they watch him with it he drags on and his little body begins to get more fail more frail on it and they're whipping him and they're making him go on and he's pulling that old crossbow bump bump and those little spots get bigger and bigger and bigger and I hear splashing down his leg and he's getting weaker and he's getting weaker and what was it he was willing to pay the price and listen he was willing to pay such a great price for our freedom of the spirit for our freedom of worship for our freedom in the house of God to Deliver Us From The Law of sin and death and he paid such a great price I will not be like what our country has become and stay inside and Let Freedom at the freedom be taken but I know this gospel came with a cost and if it gave men have died and they give their life how much more should we stand for the freedom of God in our lives and say devil you're not taking one of our freedoms they might rewrite Constitution they may rewrite amendments they may take all the holidays off and never celebrate the 4th of July ever again it matters not to me I have a freedom that this world didn't give and the world can't take away it is a freedom in the land of the Holy Ghost and it's been paid for he said that's what blocked the Earth out it's like he said it was like operation was taking place he was it was my operation here's cutting sin off of me he was Breaking Chains off of me so when a doctor gives a man anesthetic and first knocks him out before he can do it and when God gave an operation for the church the world got an anesthetic nature had a convulsion no wonder God in human flesh was dying it was the hour the world had looked for yet many of them never saw it ain't that a paradox like it is today many have looked for these things that they don't recognize them they don't realize the way out they're still trying to seek pleasures and things of the world trying to find their way out there there was it's been and has been many signposts that pointed to that day many great foreshadowings many have been foreshadowed by the Lamb by the Bulldog by the turtle dove all these things and yet it could they could not see it and that all those other foreshadows could not pay the price they could not break the Yoke off of the earth they could not break the Yoke off of men's lives you couldn't break death's hold the very Rock said he once walked up and down the Earth burning like Brian Brian Stones Lucifer was a son of the morning and he walked on the Earth when the burning volcanic those same rocks that it cooled off when Jesus died at Calvary bench belts forth again out of the earth he said the price that was paid the bondage of Satan was broke God put back in the hands of man away back to what he was looking for he had to weep no more when he broke the backbone of Satan there at Calvary the backbone of sin the backbone of sickness it brings every Mortal being on Earth back into the presence of God with all sins forgiven wow the price is paid no wonder the Catholics didn't want you to have this Bible come on somebody amen we don't understand that we have this Bible has been a part of our life all of our life we grew up reading the Bible many of us amen we don't understand what it was like for some of those men to fight their way and give their lives so you could have this Bible freely but somebody had to pay the price somebody had to pay the price for you to believe what you believe today William Branham could have been it could have been a boxer he could have been a god he could have been all kinds of things but he paid a price this gospel that we believe today did not come without price somebody paid a price amen and you know he paid a price to to get up he would get up and preach no and preach things knowing that what he was preaching friends was going to leave him and they did come down to it he said I don't have many friends left it's like if I preach this they ought the rest of them believe he knew that it came with a price amen for us the how the atmosphere that that we experience and the spirit of God moving Among Us and the liberty of the word it comes with a price amen it does not come it does not come freely if somebody had to give something so you could obtain it listen for you to have kids that that are good children and love the Lord and it came with a price God put back in the hands of man away back he was looking for he had to weep no more it broke the backbone of Satan the backbone of sin the backbone of sickness and it brings every Mortal being on Earth back into the presence of God with all sins of our sins are forgiven no more can Satan block us off from God man that ought about shouting shoes right there amen the devil always wasn't trying to tell you no God ain't hearing your prayers God don't hear you God don't hear you no more can Satan block us all from God no more can he cut the communication between us and God there is a Highway made there's a telephone sitting there there is a line to Glory amen it brings every person in reach of that line if a man is full of sin it connected him to on Central he can be forgiven of that sin not only that that sin is already paid for you don't have to say I'm not worthy oh hallelujah amen that's what the devil wants you to say over and over and over and over I'm not worthy I'm not worthy Omni you'll never will be but he made you Worthy scripture said he made you accepted in the Beloved so in other words he had to pay the price so you could have that place there amen you don't have to say no more you're not worthy you're not you never could be but a worthy one took your place [Applause] therefore you're no more bound you're afraid you don't have to wonder anymore you don't have to be a pleasure seeking man out in here no more there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins or Sinners plunge beneath the flood and lose all their guilty stains oh my you don't have to be lost oh Jesus amen if the loss could ever realize that you don't have to be lost there is already a highway built there's a way you can go it's called the way of Holiness the unclean came Passover but he that comes to this Fountain and he can enter in that cow that Highway listen Jesus Paid the price he broke the powers of Satan Satan has been hanging stuff over your head what you need to remind him is you're broke how many times he wants to tell you that you're broke you ain't got nothing you don't have anything you've never experienced nothing from God you're broke you don't have no joy you're broke you don't have no peace you're broke you're full of you're full of anxiety and fear you're a broke person you're nervous all the time you're a broke person no he's the one that's broke come on now you're not the one that's broke you're the one that's paid for is there a brother Timothy I don't look like much well neither they don't knock knead Lop ear mule that time he's born so ugly hey man it looks so ugly looks so terrible he's like man as soon as they see me they're going to kill me and his mama said hey you just need to settle down there there was a lamb that was offered for you Hallelujah you made to yourself never look like much and never looked like anything but you need to quit saying I'm not worthy you need to quit saying I'm broke you need to quit saying I'm nothing God gave everything for you so you have to be something I mean my God you only give something for something what you think is worse that's common that's common sense right I mean who's going to go to a garage sale and you're going to see this old shirt tattered up or whatever stinks what you gonna give for it you ain't even gonna want it I hope not anyway but I mean none of you it ain't good since gonna pull out a hundred dollar bill and say here I believe I'll buy this shirt that would seem senseless stupid yeah that's a good word I like that word stupid somebody done lost their marbles turn your neighbor and say I ain't lost mine all right yeah we'll loosen up a little bit it's Freedom Day hey man here you go to the garage sale and you find some piece of junk and you pay a a crazy price for it it don't it seems like but the reason why you would is because you would know it's worth more than what they think it's worth the reason why you might would decide hey I need to get this and get out of here with it you know I I mean brother Mike I'm here brother Mike we was looking for Coleman lanterns and I got into Coleman lanterns with him and I I said you know what I'm gonna find one of them Mark lanterns he said whatever he said people looked all all over for one of them things they're not their rares woodpecker lips that's one of his sayings and that's why so I'm gonna find one sure enough I ain't been I ain't been looking for lanterns for about four or five months maybe less I drive over to Dallas pull off on the side road go in this little spot it don't even look like an antique place I walk around the corner in Andrews and Luke's with me and sister Ruth and Andrew there's one of them kids went through that Ruby's Cube craze and he's just he go whoa dad there's an ark I knew Andrew and I thought he's pulling my leg I look down there and sure enough it was you know and it's a beautiful Arc and it but it didn't look like much it looked like it was broke just a broken hunk of metal but I knew it was worth something I knew that it was rare I knew that it was something of great greater value than what was on it and he was even had a tag on it says a great Lantern to paint or decorate how fun 24.95 last night's that thing up because I knew even as it said it was worth probably 20 40 50 times more than even that and so I'm just shook up because I don't found an ark and I'm walking around and I called brother Mike I said hey you ain't gonna believe this I found an R he said you're lying I put on a table I took some pictures I sent her a picture I said now my line or what he said hey let me ask you this question he said you still in that store and I said yeah I'm still I'm just kind of I'm just my mind's blowed he said go up there throw them 30 dollars on the front and walk out the door and put that thing in your car before somebody realizes what you got that's what I did because I knew that even the tag that was on it it was a certain price somebody had put on it but I knew it was worth more than that so I was willing to even pay more than what it was what they had on it because I knew that inside of it and what it was it could be worth more than that did I have to do something sure I had to go home and I sent it to another person they made it into something now it's worth about three grand maybe or somewhere around there amen somebody who thought it was nothing but a hunk of junk that needed to be painted and decorated and put out in the yard somewhere but somebody with an eye come along and said hey that's worth more than that [Music] [Applause] I remember the day when I was sitting in a shop and the devil had put all kind of tags on me and said do this and he's this and he's there and that's all he's ever going to be but somebody came walking through there and said hey that boy is worth more than that and I'm willing to pay the price I'm willing to give my all cause it's worthwhile I don't care what the sign says I don't care what it says to do with it that's not what I'm gonna do I'm gonna remake it I want to remold it and it will give light again Hallelujah some of you ain't been nothing but beaten down humanity and the devil's put all kind of signs on you and said oh just go ahead and have fun paint it up and decorate it do what you want to with it but that's not who you were you was destined to give light you is destined to light up the world and God saw something on the inside of you and he walked and he ripped that old tag off oh Jesus and he made you into something that can Shine for his glory you don't have to be lost pretty good way to work Coleman into a sermon amen there is a Highway he broke the power of Satan he opened up the prison doors to every man that was shut up in this earth fearing that when he died what death would have be to him on Calvary he opened those cell doors he let every captive Go free you don't have to no longer be torn down by sin hello somebody you don't have to no longer be torn down by sin you don't have to no longer yield your members to sin drinking smoking gambling whatever sin in there you're besetting sin you can be honest just enough right and Satan can do nothing about it I love that part right there you can be honest Justin upright and Satan can do nothing about it nothing came from it no one will shake you even death itself can't shake you that's what Calvary done pay the price men that were in bondage were set free men that were once under the fear of death no longer fear death a man who Longs for a city whose Builder maker is God he can step on the highway and set his face toward Heaven because he's a free man he is redeemed he don't have to wonder no more hello you don't have to wonder no more Emma saved am I not saved Emma hears them are not his now I belong to him do I do to me you don't have to wonder no more he thought you was worth saving the devil may not have thought much about you but God thought she was worth saving God thought you was worth paying the price for and so he was willing to give the ultimate price no greater love has a man than one that'll lay down his life for his friend he is redeemed he no longer has to wander no more there's no way of knowing whether you're right or not there is a way of knowing whether you're right or not God give us life our sins are gone that day old Calvary paid the price when we see all that and the one of the poet wrote mid-winding rocks and deafening Skies My Savior bowed his head and died the opening Veil revealed the way to Heaven's joy and endless day Abraham don't have to wonder no more across the country and city seek in the city The Sinner don't have to wonder anymore whether he can be saved or not the sick does not have to wonder whether he can be healed or not do like brother and brother and check check mike you working the sick does not have to wonder anymore if you can be healed or not the price has already been paid [Applause] you don't have to wonder anymore if your son or your daughter can be saved the price has already paid [Applause] you don't have to wonder anymore if you can be free from that debilitating disease amen what is it death has already been crushed sin has already been paid for what a privilege it is to know that you got away now when there was no way Calvary opened up the way for all those Patriarchs that hunted and sought for it calvary gave it to you free how can we turn such a great thing down how can we turn it down and join a denomination whether that be whatever name you want to put on it amen are turning away freedoms at once the faith that was delivered to the church my Jew was Jude said we must earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered so there it has to be someone that will stand and say you know what it's going to be War either way whether we want to end up just just laying back and saying devil do whatever you want to and we end up in Chains or we fight we fight for our families oh there's a cost but we fight for our families we fight for our freedom there's men in this gospel that we've earnestly we love with all of our heart we call the message that are laying aside freedoms and saying they they don't belong to us they're saying it ain't no more we shouldn't do prayer lines we shouldn't do altar calls you traitor that's all you are as a traitor you need the Holy Ghost on the inside of you say how can you say that because I was just in one Saturday night and I saw Deliverance after Deliverance after the why wouldn't you want it that's right why would you all have a freedom that's been given to the house of God why would you want it why wouldn't you stand for it why wouldn't you stand there and hold the sword and say devil come take it if you wanted you're gonna have to come take it because I'm going to fight for it I'm going to fight for the Holy Ghost in our hearts I'm going to fight for the Holy Ghost atmosphere that Sons and Daughters can be born of the spirit of God I'm going to stand there but I've done all to stand I want to stand fast in the Liberty whereas I have been called you can go back to the bondage if you want to go back I'm not going back to bondage you can go back to lukewarmness if you want to go back I'm not going back to lukewarmness you can go back to your own comfort zone if that's where you want to be but as for me in my house we're going to serve God we're going to fight for our liberties the devil wants to come in the house of God and take the liberty of the ministry to preach the gospel how dare you devil you as the children of God on a fight for the Liberty to have a man better stand and proclaim the message of almighty God whether it burns a hide off of us but there is a cost of freedom that day on Calvary there wasn't a lamb on this Earth that could pay the price no woolly lamb but there was the Lamb of God he was hacked he was chopped he was beat he was spit on slammed smacked by the world and the blood dropping off his locks it was a cost and he paid it for you he paid it so you can enjoy the liberties that we could find in Christ Jesus the Liberties to let God do as God wants to do he said in John 8 and verse 36 he said the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed he'd say this in the church he says now don't get tired again by traditions and Creeds and organizations don't get tired again don't be led astray by letting be not entangled again remember what we just read be not until don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word hello don't be led astray by listen to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves and deny that he heals and deny that he feels with the Holy Ghost in power you are God's men loosed by his own blood it would say it there in that same place in Revelations 1 5 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins this wash means actually means loosed loosed us from our own sins and his own blood isn't that wonderful but are you spiritually minded did you catch it it was his own blood that loosens completely from our sins it was not human blood it was the blood of God Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul called it the blood of the Lord the blood of Jesus not free person but one person there is that Revelation again one God that omnipotent Jehovah God came down and made himself a body by means of the Virgin birth and indwelted that it might be the blood of God that would free us loose us entirely from our sin and present us spotless before himself would exceeding great joy what happened you had sins I had sin we were all born since but somebody settled to death [Music] Hallelujah one lamb could always in the Bible the Old Testament can only come and sacrifice and maybe for a year settled the dead or of one sin settle the death but this one lamb came and settled every debt talk about person in this church I'm talking about everyone whosoever will let him come he has settled every death canceled the devil wants to come by as your accuser and he pulls out his old book of remembrance wait a minute I had a road here but it says cancel let me let me go out and I got something on him over here back in this well cancer I was sure I knew he told this line he'd done this bad deal and he'd done this over I had it wrote down let me flip it right cancel what matter of fact it's written there in red let me read let me put my glasses on again Justified yes as though we never did it in the first place it's all gone there is now no condemnation [Applause] Hallelujah if you've got condemnation tonight and you put everything under the blood it's not coming from God it's coming from that Old Wicked enemy called the devil and he's trying to hold us something over you that you never did in the first place because God came and he canceled the dead and he paid the prize that you could go free became himself to redeem that lost son he did not send another he didn't send an angel he didn't send another one like unto us no he came himself God did not entrust this Plan of Salvation to anyone else his trust he trusted only himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed us into him by himself we are saved by the blood of God Eternal God indwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood to enter into the veil with it consider this since it was the blood of God it is a perfect blood and if it has a perfect blood it has a perfect loosing it loosens us from the power and the bondage and the defilement of sin then the loosen is perfect and complete there is now therefore no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies it or declares us righteous [Applause] who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation there is now nothing to be condemned for amen what's in Watson is removed as far as the east from the West because the blood has loosed us from the sin we are free Guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word that's why God paid the price for you to have the word some years ago brother random says it like this we bring this down I was walking around looking at different pictures and things in this old Museum I admire art and I think God is in art and I walked up and I noticed there was an old negro man he was a real old stooped in his shoulders little rim of hair and at the back of his head he had a hat on he's walking around something in that manner looking around as if he was watching or looking for something something specific I stood back and I watched him a little bit after a while he came to a certain little box and he looked into it and he startled his eyes brightened up and he jumped back took off his little plug hat and held it in his hand and I watched him as that he bowed his head and tears began to drop off his cheeks and I stood there and watched an amazement I thought I had to find out what he's so excited about and I walked around this side and I looked it looked at me like just a dress laying there and I said Uncle how you doing he said how do you do sir I said I'm a minister I'm surprised to see you offering prayer at this place I believe you must be a Christian he said yes sir I am so why are you so excited what has excited you so much he said come here sir and I walked over with the old fella there and he said you see that dress he said yes sir you see that spot on there yes sir put your hand on my side I said well what's that rough place he said a slave belt went around there one day he said that blood on that dress is Abraham Lincoln's blood that blood took the slave belt off of me wouldn't that excite you too [Music] I stood there in amazement I thought if the blood could excite a slave for taking a slave belt off for him what all the blood of Jesus Christ do a people like Rosella sitting here that was a slave to alcohol or me dying a miserable rest but he took the slave belt off of me [Applause] he said I can't hardly look at a tree without remembering my Lord I was on a tree and he gave his life for me he said that's not to make anybody Shout [Applause] Hallelujah and you wonder why we're shouting you wonder why we get excited you know I get Amazed by people they can get excited by a song and they can have a concert and they can say well the spirit of God moved here and maybe he did and I'll say he did wonderful but somehow we get to preaching of the word and we go to shouting and something's wrong about that I thought it was the word that was supposed to make a shout not some guilt that's up there singing and carrying on AIM I mean it's all fine and Danny in this place but what ought to really make you shout is the word of God because in the word of God there is liberty and the word has come he said his word and he healed them wow that's what is happening that is what is going on around us God has sent his word and he's delivering that way and he's delivering that one and he's sitting that one free and the slave Builders broke off Builders broke off and the rejoices I once was lost but now I'm found I want to fly but now I see Amazing Grace how sweet this sound let's save the rich like me Hallelujah he paid the price that I can go free when I think about the Lord Harry save me how he healed me how he delivered me when I think about the Lord how he brought Justin wear back how he healed sister Atlanta how he touched different hearts in this assembly it makes me want to shout when I think about the Lord and I feel the marks of that old slave belt put the Slate belt ain't there no more it's just marks of it amen Scholars that I hold but it's a reminder there used to be a slave out there you say well brother Timothy I got a lot of scars in my life let that be as a reminder there used to be a slave bill then but that sleigh bells ain't there no more he broke it off of you and you're free we have a little spot of Abraham's leaking blood can make a little man shout want all the blood of Jesus Christ through the Church of the Living God whose sin has been broke on chains have been broke off pop places have been broken all anxiety has been broke off tears called who the sun is set free is free indeed you're free tonight [Applause] let's don't give up our liberties let's Stand Fast therefore in the liberty of Christ this ain't a man decreed Liberty come on now this ain't a man decreed Liberty it was an angel a mighty angel that came down with a book in his hand and he put his land upon the sea and upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice his head was in heaven but where was his body [Applause] and it showed you in that body you allow your feet are over the land and Over the Sea it's all has Dominion in it it has power in it you say well brother Timothy I'm just nothing but that old mule I'm just nothing but a lot better than me or nobody cares for me nobody 100 I'm just a skin on the bottom of his feet well good thing you made the body [Applause] you might be the skin but try walking without skin try operating without skin on the bottom of your feet it is very necessary every person in this church is very necessary you might feel the lowest of the lowest but with the lowest of the lowest steps out of bed and it gets to walk around it ain't walking around a Slave it ain't walking around bows it's walking around delivering and the devil knows he's under your feet devil knows you are a free man and he is the one that's bound you are a free people so let's act like we're free [Applause] [Music] you love the Lord they just lift your hands and just tell him how much thank you for paying the price thank you for paying the price [Music] thank you his hair and he saw value in you and he picked you up out of the pawn shop he didn't leave you where he found you but he raised you up so you could stand no mountains Hallelujah someone paid incredible prices for Freedom they've moved across countries they've done everything they could to get in the presence of God well then just enjoy your Liberty
