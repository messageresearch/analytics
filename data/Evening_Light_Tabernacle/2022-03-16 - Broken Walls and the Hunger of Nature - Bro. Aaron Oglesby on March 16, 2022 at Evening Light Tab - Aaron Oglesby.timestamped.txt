[44:45] and about that you should have seen them
[44:47] man there were so many of them
[44:51] brother danny that was the funniest part
[44:52] was watching people have been reading
[44:54] the bible for 40 years trying to find
[44:56] the book of gideon
[44:58] and uh and after i said it about the
[45:00] third time i hear brother danny go
[45:02] judges
[45:05] what
[45:06] judges
[45:08] that's exactly right
[45:11] but uh
[45:12] we are going to read from the book of
[45:13] proverbs tonight and that is a real book
[45:16] in the bible
[45:19] turn to the book of proverbs the 24th
[45:21] chapter
[45:22] and the 30th verse
[45:24] i'd like to
[45:26] take a little thought tonight maybe a
[45:27] little different
[45:28] on
[45:29] broken walls and the hunger of nature
[45:34] broken walls
[45:36] and the hunger of nature in the 30th
[45:39] verse it says i went by the field of the
[45:41] slothful
[45:42] and by the vineyard of the man void of
[45:45] understanding
[45:46] and lo it was all grown over with thorns
[45:49] and nettles
[45:51] had thorns and nettles had covered the
[45:53] face thereof and the stone wall thereof
[45:55] was broken down
[45:57] then i saw and considered it well i
[46:00] looked upon it and received instruction
[46:04] if you'll also turn over with me to
[46:06] galatians the 5th chapter
[46:08] and the 22nd verse
[46:11] galatians the 5th chapter and the 22nd
[46:13] verse
[46:16] it says but the fruit of the spirit is
[46:18] love joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[46:20] goodness
[46:22] and faith meekness temperance against
[46:25] such there is no law
[46:26] and they that are christ have crucified
[46:29] the flesh with the affections and lust
[46:32] if we live in the spirit let us also
[46:35] walk in the spirit
[46:38] amen may god had his blessings as you
[46:40] have your seats
[46:43] i mean i believe that each and every one
[46:44] of us tonight and in every service and
[46:47] in every day
[46:48] are being called to further our walk
[46:51] from wherever it is that we find
[46:52] ourselves
[46:54] we are never all on the exact same spot
[46:56] or in the exact same place and in our
[46:58] spiritual walk but i believe that god is
[47:00] always calling us to take another step
[47:03] the moment that we're not walking in the
[47:05] moment that we're standing still is when
[47:06] our our relationship or our experience
[47:09] as it were becomes stagnant so he's
[47:11] calling us tonight to take another step
[47:13] and to to go to greater depths and for
[47:16] each one of us to reach higher heights
[47:18] and as i was studying this and looking
[47:20] on this thought i know that within every
[47:22] congregation you have people at every
[47:24] single level you have some that have
[47:26] never even accepted salvation you have
[47:28] some that are justified and sanctified
[47:30] and then those that are filled with the
[47:31] holy ghost and everywhere in between
[47:33] those sit underneath the roof of every
[47:36] single congregation but as i studied
[47:38] this thought out
[47:40] i wasn't studying it from the standpoint
[47:42] of someone that was lost but from the
[47:43] standpoint of someone who is doing
[47:45] everything that they can to walk with
[47:47] the lord
[47:48] walking with god
[47:51] doing their best to push on and take
[47:53] that step that i believe god has called
[47:55] us to and i was looking at through the
[47:57] standpoint of you are god's people and
[48:00] you have been called to be fruitful
[48:03] every single christian is called to be
[48:06] fruitful to bear fruits of the spirit
[48:08] now i was i was looking at it thinking
[48:11] that we above all people in the earth
[48:13] should be a group of people bearing
[48:15] forth the fruits of the spirit
[48:17] all right if anyone should be bearing
[48:19] forth fruits in this day in this age it
[48:21] should be the people and the followers
[48:23] of this message that have a revealed
[48:25] word that light has shown in this day on
[48:28] the word and when we have a fool where
[48:30] we're not looking at it through a glass
[48:32] darkly as it were but we can look at it
[48:34] with revelation we can look at it in
[48:36] truth and and if we can see that we
[48:38] ought to be a people that can bear
[48:40] fruits in this day so when i got to that
[48:43] i asked myself and i asked you this for
[48:46] you
[48:46] personally what hinderath
[48:51] what hindereth
[48:54] if we're supposed to be bearing all
[48:55] these fruits
[48:57] what hindereth what is it stopping you
[49:01] what is it hindering me
[49:03] why don't i have a greater harvest than
[49:05] that which i have
[49:06] what is it that hinders us and brother
[49:08] branham says here in a quote he says god
[49:11] bless you god bless you god bless you in
[49:13] the balcony is somebody up in the
[49:16] balcony that would say brother branham i
[49:18] once had the victory
[49:20] i once was a godly person but somehow
[49:23] another the weeds and the thorns and the
[49:25] things has choked me down
[49:28] the weeds and the thorns and things has
[49:31] choked me down what happened to this
[49:34] person
[49:35] why is it that they can look and say i
[49:37] once had the victory this isn't someone
[49:39] who wasn't walking with god this isn't
[49:41] someone who wasn't serving the lord this
[49:43] is someone who lived for a period of
[49:45] time and and had the the testimony that
[49:48] i had the victory i walked above sin i
[49:51] walked above i had the victory that i
[49:53] needed but but thorns and things has
[49:55] choked me down i once was a godly person
[49:59] now notice what it is that brother brown
[50:01] on when he's speaking these these people
[50:03] that he says has stolen away the victory
[50:06] he says what is it that has choked the
[50:08] life out of this person weeds and thorns
[50:11] and things has choked me down
[50:15] weeds and thorns and things has choked
[50:18] me down now christians are called and
[50:20] instructed to be a fruit-bearing people
[50:24] we are instructed and called to be a
[50:26] fruit-bearing church not a church that's
[50:29] living off past traditions not a church
[50:31] that's living off past moves or a church
[50:34] that's living out of a past glory but
[50:36] one that is bringing forth the same
[50:38] fruits as the original church one that
[50:41] is bringing forth the exact same harvest
[50:43] as the original church because it is of
[50:45] the same vine and so the fruits that
[50:48] we're bringing forth shouldn't match the
[50:49] fruits that we see there in the book of
[50:51] acts in the very first church age i know
[50:54] sometimes it's hard for us to look at it
[50:55] like this but in the first church age
[50:57] every church was a message church
[50:59] every church in the first age was a
[51:01] believing church so we should match up
[51:04] with that when we look at and bring
[51:05] forth the same fruits we are called to
[51:08] have fruit-bearing fruitful homes
[51:11] our homes should be those that bear
[51:13] fruit where the atmosphere is right for
[51:15] spiritual growth in the family where
[51:17] evils are kept out and the token is
[51:19] applied and children are nurtured and
[51:22] not a place where they are exposed to
[51:24] all the evils of the world i've often
[51:27] wondered what good it does us to
[51:28] homeschool our kids in order to keep
[51:30] them from an evil influence and then
[51:32] just bring the influence right into our
[51:33] house you might as well have just sent
[51:35] them to school
[51:36] you might as well just send them off to
[51:38] the wolves you're bringing it right in
[51:39] your home you're going i'm trying to
[51:41] protect them i'm trying to protect them
[51:42] but here i don't got time for you go
[51:44] watch this yeah that's okay yeah i'll
[51:46] tolerate that what good is it what have
[51:48] you really done if you're doing that
[51:50] you're cutting off the harvest you're
[51:52] killing the fruits you're making your
[51:54] home an unfruitful home
[51:56] you're making it where the the kids have
[51:59] to literally fight uphill to get where
[52:01] it is that you want them to go or where
[52:02] we hope to see them get
[52:04] you're putting them off in a bad
[52:06] situation because the the place that
[52:08] they're supposed to be protected the
[52:09] place that they're supposed to be
[52:11] nourished the place the atmosphere where
[52:13] the holy spirit is supposed to be able
[52:15] to deal with them you've got them living
[52:16] in a worldly atmosphere in a so-called
[52:18] christian home
[52:20] but it's a home that's called to be
[52:22] fruitful where the atmosphere is right
[52:25] for spiritual growth
[52:28] spiritual church
[52:30] it's built on spiritual families
[52:33] which is then built by spiritual leaders
[52:36] spiritual individuals that take charge
[52:39] and recognize the buck stops with me
[52:43] i tell my children all the time you
[52:45] don't understand one day daddy is going
[52:47] to answer for what goes on in this house
[52:50] one day daddy's going to answer it may
[52:52] make you mad right now it may make you
[52:54] upset right now you may not like this
[52:56] decision but that's okay because you're
[52:57] not going to answer to god for it i am
[53:02] fruitful individuals fruitful homes make
[53:05] fruitful churches
[53:08] we're not to be bearing our own fruits
[53:10] we're not to be living how we see fit
[53:14] people like to say things like well it's
[53:16] my life no it's actually not your life
[53:19] it's his life lent to you for his
[53:20] purpose
[53:22] and it is not your life that life was
[53:24] given to you by almighty god and he
[53:27] expects it surrendered back to him to be
[53:29] used according to how he sees fit
[53:31] we are not to be people conforming to
[53:34] the world and producing fruits of the
[53:36] world
[53:37] but living a life led of the spirit let
[53:40] of the spirit of god producing the
[53:42] fruits of the spirit
[53:45] in galatians we read there where it said
[53:46] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[53:48] peace long-suffering which means
[53:50] patience
[53:51] gentleness goodness faith meekness
[53:54] temperance which means self-control
[53:58] i doubt there's a person here that would
[54:00] raise their hand and say i've maxed them
[54:02] all out
[54:06] let me go ahead and tell you right now i
[54:07] can pick out several that i'm like
[54:09] struggle
[54:12] i ain't got much patience
[54:16] and if you pray for it that's just
[54:19] whoo you're asking for it
[54:21] and i don't mean patience
[54:26] all of us can grow
[54:28] all of us can see our harvest increased
[54:31] all of us can see a greater harvest and
[54:33] a greater yield the bible talks about
[54:36] some fell on good ground and yielded 30
[54:38] and some 60 and some 100 fold
[54:41] we all could increase our harvest and
[54:43] grow more a life surrendered to christ
[54:47] will bear forth these fruits and not
[54:49] only will they let me tell you it is
[54:51] expected of you that it will
[54:54] god expects you to bring forth fruits
[54:56] this isn't an optional thing this isn't
[54:58] something we just chalk up the
[55:00] personality well she's a meek sister i'm
[55:03] not
[55:05] well my family just don't have patience
[55:08] god's not gonna listen to that excuse
[55:10] that day
[55:11] he's saying i expected you to bring
[55:13] forth my fruits i put you there as a
[55:15] testimony i put you there as a witness i
[55:18] put you there to show people what my
[55:20] spirit living through human flesh would
[55:22] do
[55:24] and what is your excuse for not
[55:25] manifesting those fruits we can't just
[55:28] chalk it up to personality
[55:31] too many times when we chalk it up our
[55:33] shortcomings to our fleshly nature
[55:36] and when surely this does play a role
[55:38] but that flesh although it will always
[55:40] war with you and although it will be a
[55:42] thorn in your side that flesh was never
[55:45] meant to control you
[55:47] that flesh is not meant to control you
[55:48] yes i'd realize it's unconverted and
[55:50] we'll deal with that as we go along but
[55:52] that unconverted converted flesh is
[55:55] meant for the spirit in you to grab a
[55:57] hold of and bring it into subjection and
[56:00] you are to rule over that flesh
[56:02] that flesh is not to rule over you it is
[56:05] not to be your crutch it is not to be
[56:07] your excuse well i just can't help it
[56:10] this flesh is unconverted then what good
[56:12] is the holy ghost
[56:14] what good is the holy ghost if every
[56:16] time we trip and fall we're just going
[56:18] to blame the flesh and we're going to
[56:19] blame the flesh and i'm just not strong
[56:21] enough i know you're not strong enough
[56:23] that's why he sent the holy spirit
[56:25] that's why you got to be born again
[56:27] that's why you got to have the token in
[56:29] this day
[56:31] and it will overcome your flesh
[56:38] galatians 5 24
[56:40] and they that are christ have crucified
[56:43] the flesh
[56:44] [Music]
[56:46] a life with the holy ghost on the throne
[56:48] will have battles as much as the next
[56:50] man
[56:52] you as a holy ghost feel believer is
[56:53] going to have battles just like the
[56:55] ranked center down the street
[56:57] is that it's not going to make it to
[56:59] where you you are immune from having
[57:01] battles but the life of the holy ghost
[57:03] christian will bear out victory
[57:06] the life of a holy ghost a christian
[57:08] will walk after the spirit and not after
[57:11] the flesh and the fruits of the spirit
[57:13] will be evident
[57:15] it will be an evident thing
[57:18] sure all lives have seasons
[57:21] i recognize that you can't just live in
[57:23] harvest time where it's just constant
[57:25] and constant and constant brother joe
[57:27] preached wonderfully not too long ago on
[57:29] the mountains and the valleys and the
[57:30] experience
[57:32] and where sometimes you're in a growing
[57:34] season
[57:35] sometimes you're in a harvest season we
[57:37] all have mountains and we all have
[57:39] valleys and therefore we'll have times
[57:41] where the harvest is great and other
[57:43] times where maybe it's a struggle but
[57:45] even in the struggle you will overcome
[57:48] even in the struggle you will produce
[57:50] the the fruits of the spirit maybe not
[57:52] as much as at other times maybe you're
[57:54] in a struggle maybe you're in a valley
[57:57] but even when you're not in so-called
[57:59] fruit growing season you must make sure
[58:02] that the ground stays prepared
[58:05] you got to make sure that the ground
[58:07] stays tilled up and ready to receive
[58:09] seed because if the ground is hard and
[58:11] you let the thorns in and you let the
[58:13] other things in and the seed falls in
[58:15] then it gets choked out
[58:17] but you got to keep the ground tilled up
[58:19] you got to keep it soft and ready
[58:21] you got to keep the walls of your estate
[58:23] fortified
[58:25] you got to keep them built up because
[58:27] the walls is what kept the wild beast
[58:29] and the wild animals out from eating up
[58:31] the crops
[58:34] you got to keep the walls fortified
[58:38] and you got to live in the condition to
[58:40] produce fruits even if it's not fruit
[58:42] growing season
[58:44] so that when the word comes forth so
[58:46] that when the spirit does move you are
[58:49] ready to receive it you are ready to
[58:51] produce you are ready to have a harvest
[58:53] in that moment you got to live ready for
[58:55] your opportunity so many people the
[58:58] spirit moves and nothing happens and the
[59:00] spirit moves and nothing happens and why
[59:01] it happening white and it happened i
[59:03] thought i had something was the ground
[59:05] prepared was the ground tilled up were
[59:07] you looking to plant the garden that day
[59:10] or did it fall on stony ground
[59:13] did it fall on concrete ground because
[59:15] of the season of life that you were in
[59:17] to where your ground wasn't prepared
[59:20] your life has to be prepared to take
[59:22] that seed and nurture that seed and
[59:25] allow it to manifest exactly what god
[59:27] intended for it to do when he sent it by
[59:29] your way
[59:30] because when he sent it by your way he
[59:32] sent it by your way with an intended
[59:34] harvest
[59:36] that was the purpose of it he didn't do
[59:37] it it's not meant to just be scattered
[59:40] out so he can say well i did it
[59:42] he did that he sends it specifically by
[59:44] your way and he comes by evening like
[59:46] tabernacle service after service and the
[59:49] word goes forth and the seed goes forth
[59:51] and he's expecting a harvest to come
[59:53] forth from all the seed that has gone
[59:55] forth over the pulpit
[59:58] it's so time after time and the spirit
[1:00:00] moves and the atmosphere is right so if
[1:00:02] it's not producing a harvest
[1:00:05] then there's something wrong with the
[1:00:06] ground
[1:00:11] that's not to say that those who would
[1:00:12] live in these can this condition
[1:00:14] prepared for it overcoming filled with
[1:00:17] the holy ghost it's not to say that
[1:00:18] you're never going to have issues
[1:00:21] not to say we don't acknowledge the fact
[1:00:23] that the flesh isn't converted
[1:00:26] that's not to say that bringing forth
[1:00:28] good fruit won't be a struggle at times
[1:00:30] that you're never going to have an
[1:00:32] argument with your spouse or never have
[1:00:33] a bad day at work that you're never ever
[1:00:36] ever going to raise your voice at your
[1:00:38] children it's never going to happen
[1:00:49] it's not saying that it's not saying
[1:00:50] that that you're even that you won't
[1:00:52] ever do a single thing wrong
[1:00:55] brother brown's asked a question one
[1:00:57] time can a holy ghost feel believer be
[1:00:59] pushed to do
[1:01:00] small things i'm paraphrasing wrong and
[1:01:03] he said absolutely it says a matter of
[1:01:04] fact when you get the holy ghost now
[1:01:06] you're in a position for that attack to
[1:01:08] come now you're in the position for
[1:01:10] those things to be pushed upon you but
[1:01:12] then people stop right there he follows
[1:01:14] that up the next sentence he says is but
[1:01:16] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:01:20] that's in the world don't stop halfway
[1:01:22] and use it as your crutch for why you're
[1:01:24] sinning and why you can't stand and
[1:01:26] while you're failing what brother
[1:01:27] branham said these things would happen
[1:01:29] but he also said you'd overcome those
[1:01:31] things
[1:01:32] [Applause]
[1:01:39] you will do things wrong
[1:01:44] you will have
[1:01:46] hiccups
[1:01:48] and stumbles here and there
[1:01:50] because nature
[1:01:52] is hungry
[1:01:54] and it wants to consume you
[1:01:57] nature is hungry
[1:02:00] and it wants to consume you
[1:02:02] beast nature is your enemy
[1:02:07] you are not your friend
[1:02:12] this flesh
[1:02:14] is unconverted
[1:02:15] we acknowledge
[1:02:17] and it will be a thorn in your side as
[1:02:19] long as you were here
[1:02:21] and it will try to fill your life with
[1:02:23] thorns and thistles to choke out the
[1:02:25] fruits that the spirit is supposed to
[1:02:27] bring forth
[1:02:29] we know that originally adam and eve
[1:02:31] didn't have to deal with sin nature when
[1:02:33] they were first placed in the garden
[1:02:34] that's not something he ever ever had to
[1:02:37] deal with
[1:02:38] ever had to worry about but because of
[1:02:40] reasoning and because eve stepped out
[1:02:42] from behind her wall of protection
[1:02:45] which is the word
[1:02:46] then mankind and all of earth fell into
[1:02:49] the condition that we now see
[1:02:52] genesis 3 17 says and unto adam he said
[1:02:55] because thou has hearkened unto the
[1:02:56] voice of thy wife
[1:02:58] and has eaten of the tree of which i
[1:03:00] commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat
[1:03:02] of it
[1:03:03] curse it is the ground for thy sake
[1:03:06] and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[1:03:08] days of thy life
[1:03:09] thorns also and thistle shall let bring
[1:03:11] forth to thee and thou shall eat the
[1:03:13] herb of the field in the sweat of thy
[1:03:15] face shalt thou eat bread
[1:03:18] till thou return unto the ground for out
[1:03:20] of it wast thou taken for dust thou art
[1:03:24] and dust thou shalt return
[1:03:27] earth is cursed
[1:03:30] before this time adam had no trouble
[1:03:32] finding food
[1:03:35] adam never had to work a day in his life
[1:03:37] to grow food
[1:03:38] he didn't till by the sweat of his brow
[1:03:41] he didn't have any trouble bringing
[1:03:44] forth fruit as it were
[1:03:46] bringing forth fruit was an easy thing
[1:03:49] in eden nature was not adam's enemy
[1:03:54] it had not been at war with him
[1:03:56] in the eden condition adam was in total
[1:03:59] control
[1:04:01] brother branham would lay out so
[1:04:02] beautiful things other people don't even
[1:04:04] realize he said how do we know this
[1:04:05] because look at the second adam
[1:04:07] look at the way he would say peace be
[1:04:09] still look at the way he would command
[1:04:11] nature
[1:04:12] so we know that adam was in total
[1:04:14] control the weeds didn't try to take
[1:04:17] over
[1:04:19] the life of the fruit-bearing plant
[1:04:21] wasn't choked out by the life of the
[1:04:23] weeds
[1:04:24] adam operating from this place called
[1:04:27] called eden was told in genesis 1 28 to
[1:04:29] subdue the earth
[1:04:32] he was told to subdue
[1:04:35] the earth in other words eden was to
[1:04:37] stretch from sea
[1:04:39] to sea
[1:04:41] god said yes eden is in a wonderful
[1:04:43] condition yes this is a wonderful place
[1:04:45] but i'm commissioning you to expand eden
[1:04:47] i'm commissioned you to subdue the whole
[1:04:49] earth i want you to take more i want you
[1:04:51] to possess more i want you to make it
[1:04:53] all operate underneath your dominion not
[1:04:56] just eden but from sea to sea i want you
[1:04:59] to go and i want you to subdue the earth
[1:05:02] that was his commission
[1:05:04] but instead
[1:05:06] adam falls
[1:05:09] and now a constant struggle begins
[1:05:11] cursed is the ground
[1:05:13] thorns and thistles shall it bring forth
[1:05:15] dust thou art dost thou shalt return
[1:05:19] and it's not just the earth out there
[1:05:21] that we call the earth that is cursed
[1:05:24] it's not just going to be difficult to
[1:05:26] grow fruit out here in a garden
[1:05:29] but with the curse of nature and with
[1:05:30] the curse of earth
[1:05:33] now this earth is cursed
[1:05:37] now not only is this earth curse but now
[1:05:39] nature is against you
[1:05:42] so now not only is it going to be
[1:05:44] difficult to grow fruits and bring forth
[1:05:46] fruits out there
[1:05:48] but it's going to be impossible
[1:05:51] to continually bring forth fruits
[1:05:54] here
[1:05:56] because the ground is cursed
[1:05:58] it's going to be something you work at
[1:06:00] it's going to be something you toil as
[1:06:01] can be something you try to do but fail
[1:06:04] because it's all cursed
[1:06:06] nature is against you and now earth is
[1:06:09] calling for the very bodies that came
[1:06:10] forth out of it and it's calling for
[1:06:12] them to return to it
[1:06:14] earth is calling for it drawing it
[1:06:17] constantly pulling you back constantly
[1:06:19] pulling you down sitting this old age
[1:06:22] pulling at you drawing gravity to where
[1:06:24] as time sets in you begin to stoop
[1:06:27] you begin to go down you begin to be
[1:06:29] drawn back to the earth that you which
[1:06:31] you were drawn from
[1:06:33] because nature always has a desire
[1:06:36] to reclaim what has been taken from it
[1:06:40] stay with me a little bit here nature
[1:06:42] always has a desire to reclaim what it
[1:06:46] is that has been taken from it you came
[1:06:48] from the earth and so now the earth
[1:06:50] wants you back
[1:06:52] sin nature had a claim on mankind right
[1:06:55] there
[1:06:56] at the fall right there sin nature laid
[1:06:58] a claim and if something has a claim
[1:07:00] that means they want it
[1:07:02] sin nature laid a claim right here on
[1:07:05] man right here on this earth the earth
[1:07:07] became crowned in attributes of sin
[1:07:10] there was wickedness there was sickness
[1:07:12] there was death and dying and thorns and
[1:07:15] thickets became a symbol for the curse
[1:07:20] how could one bring forth fruits in that
[1:07:22] condition
[1:07:24] how can you overcome the world in that
[1:07:26] condition
[1:07:28] how can you overcome the curse walking
[1:07:31] around in cursed earth
[1:07:34] it was impossible brother branham say
[1:07:37] all was lost for adam's race
[1:07:39] he said there was no hope i'm so
[1:07:42] thankful that when he sent him out the
[1:07:43] garden he didn't just let him walk out
[1:07:45] the garden
[1:07:46] i'm so thankful that he couldn't take it
[1:07:48] brother branham said he couldn't stand
[1:07:49] to see him go
[1:07:51] he says and then when i see adam as it
[1:07:54] was standing there and heave the
[1:07:55] beautiful stature of her and while she's
[1:07:57] standing there these old bloody sheep
[1:07:59] skins and the blood running down her
[1:08:01] legs adam and his great fine stature of
[1:08:03] a man the blood of these sheepskins
[1:08:05] running down him and god standing there
[1:08:07] pronouncing death sorrow heartache and
[1:08:10] destruction
[1:08:11] watch then i can see eve put her lovely
[1:08:14] head over on adam's shoulder and him put
[1:08:16] his arm around her they started weeping
[1:08:18] turned around and started to walk out of
[1:08:20] his presence
[1:08:21] god depart from him he had sinned
[1:08:24] there's your judgment
[1:08:26] then when i can hear going down along
[1:08:28] that path through the garden of eden
[1:08:29] something like this brother branham
[1:08:31] claps
[1:08:32] what is it bloody sheepskins slapping on
[1:08:35] adam's leg as he goes down then i see
[1:08:37] all that great spaceless eternity
[1:08:40] conforming down like a funnel to four
[1:08:42] little letters l o v e
[1:08:45] he loved his children so much until he
[1:08:47] couldn't turn them away then i hear him
[1:08:49] say stop
[1:08:51] i'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[1:08:53] serpent seed promising a redeemer god
[1:08:56] making preparations
[1:08:59] to redeem
[1:09:00] oh what a moment if i say there was one
[1:09:03] of the greatest moments in time that was
[1:09:05] one of the greatest moments in time
[1:09:07] because once he made that preparation it
[1:09:09] was as good as already done
[1:09:11] he was already making preparations to
[1:09:13] come as the lamb he was already the lamb
[1:09:15] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:09:17] now in time he promises it to his
[1:09:19] children i won't leave you in that
[1:09:21] condition i won't leave you without hope
[1:09:23] i won't leave you without a way back
[1:09:25] into eternity i won't leave you in this
[1:09:27] sin cursed world
[1:09:29] making preparations for a way back
[1:09:33] and there in that moment what god gave
[1:09:34] was a substitute
[1:09:38] there in the garden he took the life of
[1:09:39] an innocent lamb
[1:09:41] and it covered their nakedness
[1:09:44] and then the blood from that lamb
[1:09:46] covered their sin but that blood didn't
[1:09:48] have the power
[1:09:50] to bring cursed earth subject once again
[1:09:54] it didn't have that power to bring
[1:09:56] cursed earth subject
[1:09:59] it didn't have the power to subdue
[1:10:01] nature
[1:10:06] we see it at mount moriah
[1:10:08] genesis 22 and 11
[1:10:10] and the angel of the lord called unto
[1:10:12] him out of heaven and said abraham
[1:10:15] abraham and he said here am i
[1:10:17] and he said lay not thy hand upon the
[1:10:19] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[1:10:22] for now i know that thou fearest god
[1:10:24] seeing thou has not withheld thy son not
[1:10:26] only son from me
[1:10:27] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:10:29] looked and behold behind him a ram
[1:10:31] caught in a thicket by his horns and
[1:10:34] abraham went and took the ram and
[1:10:35] offered him up for a burnt offering
[1:10:37] instead of his son
[1:10:39] what is it it's a foreshadow of christ
[1:10:42] but it was still a woolly lamb
[1:10:46] the life of that ram could not come back
[1:10:49] upon abraham
[1:10:51] the life of that lamb couldn't come back
[1:10:53] on him and give him the power to
[1:10:55] overcome sin nature no matter how many
[1:10:58] rams were slain it would never give him
[1:11:00] the power to overcome sin nature
[1:11:03] it couldn't give man the power to subdue
[1:11:06] his own flesh
[1:11:08] so year after year man would have to
[1:11:10] give another sacrifice and he would
[1:11:12] sacrifice but he'd walk out with the
[1:11:14] same sin desire he'd walk out with the
[1:11:16] same nature only to fall again and fall
[1:11:18] again and fall again he would come back
[1:11:20] and he would once again get his sin
[1:11:22] covered but it couldn't do away with his
[1:11:24] sin
[1:11:26] he would go out with the same nature
[1:11:28] that he came in with
[1:11:29] go out with the same sins that he came
[1:11:31] in with
[1:11:32] i want you to notice there in the
[1:11:34] scripture
[1:11:35] the ram was caught in a thicket
[1:11:39] we're from the south most of us know
[1:11:40] what a thick it is
[1:11:42] but a thick it is briars
[1:11:45] thorns
[1:11:47] brambles
[1:11:50] and such
[1:11:52] it's a thicket
[1:11:54] and the ram is caught in the thicket
[1:11:58] by its horns
[1:12:02] what you're seeing there in that thicket
[1:12:03] is the curse from genesis 3
[1:12:06] 18. that is the curse and you're seeing
[1:12:09] it there and the curse has the ram held
[1:12:11] by his horns
[1:12:13] notice that the the thicket is upon the
[1:12:15] ram's head showing that sin's curse
[1:12:18] would be upon jesus's head
[1:12:20] but there's a major difference between
[1:12:22] the two i want you to notice that the
[1:12:24] ram in this situation is trapped
[1:12:26] the ram has no power over the thicket
[1:12:30] this woolly lamb doesn't have strength
[1:12:32] over the thicket even though he's a
[1:12:34] sacrifice
[1:12:36] in this situation the thorns and the
[1:12:38] thickets still have power over the
[1:12:41] woolly lamb
[1:12:42] it's the thorns that have the power
[1:12:45] the curse here represented by the
[1:12:47] thicket is shown to still be in control
[1:12:50] of humanity
[1:12:52] it's still in control but that lamb was
[1:12:55] only a substitute
[1:12:57] a substitute for what you say behold
[1:13:01] behold the lamb of god who takes away
[1:13:04] the sin of the world
[1:13:06] he carries the sin away when those
[1:13:08] thorns are put on his head it doesn't
[1:13:10] trap him the tables have turned now he
[1:13:13] takes the curse he takes the thorns and
[1:13:15] he marches them up to calvary and he
[1:13:17] breaks in curse off of your life
[1:13:20] oh the thicket held around but the
[1:13:23] thorns couldn't hold jesus he took those
[1:13:26] up there and he took them to calvary he
[1:13:28] carried away the sins of the world
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:40] now it wasn't the lamb that's trapped
[1:13:43] by the power of sin
[1:13:46] and satan didn't know what he had done
[1:13:48] and all his mocking and crown of thorns
[1:13:51] not realizing symbolically what he was
[1:13:53] doing his great curse was being carried
[1:13:56] away
[1:13:58] the curse that had been put on humanity
[1:14:00] would be no more the tables have been
[1:14:02] completely turned this ram this lamb
[1:14:05] isn't trapped no no no no but now sin is
[1:14:08] trapped now sin is cursed now sin is
[1:14:10] defeated now sin can be overcome
[1:14:13] oh before you couldn't you couldn't come
[1:14:15] in under a woolly lamb and be set free
[1:14:18] only covered but now there's freedom for
[1:14:20] a child of god now there's victory now
[1:14:23] there's a new nature that can come into
[1:14:25] you
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:30] this lamb took those thorns to calvary
[1:14:33] and crushed his sin's curse
[1:14:39] and now through his death
[1:14:41] his burial and his resurrection
[1:14:44] and then the return
[1:14:46] of the holy ghost on the day of
[1:14:47] pentecost
[1:14:49] now
[1:14:51] man has the power to subdue
[1:14:54] once again the nature that has been
[1:14:56] ruling over him
[1:14:58] so now nature no longer is going to rule
[1:15:00] over me
[1:15:01] they tried to live right they tried to
[1:15:03] do right they couldn't do it sin nature
[1:15:05] had control but now because of the
[1:15:08] baptism of the holy ghost now the nature
[1:15:10] that once ruled over me the nature that
[1:15:12] once ruled over you now i rule over the
[1:15:15] nature
[1:15:16] i rule over sins curse i am victorious i
[1:15:20] walk in victory i walk in freedom
[1:15:23] i overcome
[1:15:26] hallelujah
[1:15:27] [Applause]
[1:15:33] now there is a place
[1:15:36] on the inside of man
[1:15:39] that he can operate from
[1:15:41] in order to bring forth
[1:15:43] fruit
[1:15:46] [Applause]
[1:15:48] he couldn't bring it forth out of the
[1:15:49] cursed ground
[1:15:51] but now there's a place to bring forth
[1:15:53] fruit
[1:15:55] not since genesis 1 28 has man been in
[1:15:57] the position to subdue nature
[1:16:02] he says and god blessed them and god
[1:16:04] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[1:16:06] and replenish the earth and subdue it
[1:16:09] and now down through time back in that
[1:16:11] position once again
[1:16:15] so what happens
[1:16:17] when you're saved and you receive the
[1:16:19] spirit of god
[1:16:23] it takes a part of you
[1:16:25] back away
[1:16:27] from
[1:16:28] sin nature
[1:16:30] it had a claim on it
[1:16:32] and nature along with anybody or
[1:16:34] anything else don't like to let go of a
[1:16:35] claim
[1:16:37] but now you're filled with this spirit
[1:16:39] and so a part of this nature a lot of it
[1:16:41] is still cursed a lot of it is still sin
[1:16:43] nature but there's a part of me
[1:16:45] that he has reached down inside of and
[1:16:47] he's ripped that away and he's put
[1:16:49] himself in there and that sin nature has
[1:16:51] no right there that sin nature can't
[1:16:54] control that as a matter of fact from
[1:16:56] that place i now control it
[1:16:58] [Applause]
[1:17:01] it takes a part of you back from fallen
[1:17:03] nature and now your soul is ruled by the
[1:17:06] spirit
[1:17:07] a part of you is now beyond
[1:17:10] the control of the flesh
[1:17:13] and that part actually begins to rule
[1:17:16] over the flesh
[1:17:18] and when we're filled with the spirit we
[1:17:20] get in behind the wall of the word and
[1:17:22] we stay behind the wall of the word and
[1:17:24] behind that wall we are safe behind that
[1:17:27] wall nothing can hurt us behind that
[1:17:29] wall we produce fruits
[1:17:32] sin nature
[1:17:34] once again being ruled
[1:17:38] there was a time when sin nature would
[1:17:39] rise up
[1:17:40] brother joe
[1:17:42] and as tries you might you couldn't
[1:17:43] withstand it
[1:17:45] try as i might i couldn't withstand it i
[1:17:47] would say i'm not going to do those
[1:17:49] things i'm not going to look on evil i'm
[1:17:51] not going to go that way and sin nature
[1:17:52] would rise up no matter how hard i
[1:17:54] fought
[1:17:55] i would fall
[1:17:56] but now when it tries to rise up there's
[1:17:58] something within me that puts it down
[1:18:00] now when it puts sin in front of my face
[1:18:02] there's something within me that turns
[1:18:03] my head i don't have to fight it i don't
[1:18:05] have to try i don't go you know i
[1:18:07] shouldn't look at that no that was sin
[1:18:08] nature now something within me says no
[1:18:11] sir that right there is a gate to hell
[1:18:13] that right there is deceit that right
[1:18:15] there is a lie i'm not going that way
[1:18:17] now something rises up on the inside of
[1:18:20] me there's something that gives me power
[1:18:22] over sin nature when temptation comes in
[1:18:25] temptation will come
[1:18:28] how many times do we deal that with with
[1:18:29] young people and they feel so guilty
[1:18:31] because they've been tempted
[1:18:33] there's no guilt in temptation let the
[1:18:35] devil tempt let the devil tip let the
[1:18:37] devil chant i'm gonna keep walking i'm
[1:18:39] going to keep overcoming i'm going to
[1:18:40] keep being victorious he can scratch he
[1:18:43] can claw he can bark he can how you know
[1:18:45] why he's helen because we got the
[1:18:47] devil's answer
[1:18:49] oh there's something on the inside of me
[1:18:51] that overcomes temptation
[1:18:56] now let's balance that out
[1:18:59] don't build your house on the cliff
[1:19:04] and then blame the devil when it falls
[1:19:05] off
[1:19:09] don't be like them and i don't want to
[1:19:11] call him by stupid but
[1:19:13] all right them stupid people
[1:19:15] bless their hearts
[1:19:18] that built all their houses on the wrong
[1:19:20] side of the levian bozier parish
[1:19:22] because it hadn't flooded in a hundred
[1:19:24] years
[1:19:26] and like three years later the whole
[1:19:28] thing flooded and the whole thing's
[1:19:29] underwater and like we can't believe i'm
[1:19:31] like they built a levy there for a
[1:19:32] reason
[1:19:34] stupid i'm sorry i shouldn't be saying
[1:19:37] that
[1:19:38] but we did
[1:19:41] god puts things in your way and if you
[1:19:43] willingly go around them don't get mad
[1:19:44] at him or the devil when you fall devil
[1:19:46] didn't do it you did it
[1:19:50] matter of fact if you're constantly
[1:19:51] setting yourself up for temptation
[1:19:54] intentionally or accidentally
[1:19:57] i didn't know when i clicked on that
[1:19:58] site that down at the bottom of the page
[1:20:00] after i scrolled 72 times that i was
[1:20:02] going to find that yeah you did
[1:20:06] and those accidents are pretty no not a
[1:20:08] pretty good are in evidence that you
[1:20:10] don't have what you claim to have
[1:20:17] i don't take anything
[1:20:21] away from people and what they claim to
[1:20:23] have
[1:20:25] i don't de-christianize people
[1:20:27] but you buy your fruits

[1:22:50] hallelujah
[1:22:58] what a power
[1:23:01] whereas before you couldn't now you can
[1:23:04] whereas before you would fall now you
[1:23:06] stand
[1:23:08] there's something in you that's doing it
[1:23:10] a place within you has returned to a
[1:23:12] condition of power
[1:23:14] an eden on the inside of cursed earth
[1:23:22] but now
[1:23:23] the reality of it
[1:23:26] the cursed earth
[1:23:28] all around that eden
[1:23:31] wants to take it over
[1:23:34] the cursed earth wants to subdue it
[1:23:37] the cursed earth wants you to back off
[1:23:39] what you've claimed
[1:23:41] the cursed earth wants you to give back
[1:23:42] over to the desires of the flesh
[1:23:45] but just like adam was told i'm telling
[1:23:48] you
[1:23:49] don't give in expand your dominion take
[1:23:53] more of your dominion claim more of the
[1:23:55] promises walk more in victory than you
[1:23:57] ever have before overcome the world
[1:24:00] you can expand your dominion tonight you
[1:24:02] can walk in victory and bring forth
[1:24:05] fruit
[1:24:08] colossians 1 10 says that you might walk
[1:24:10] worthy of the lord unto all pleasing
[1:24:13] being fruitful in every good work and
[1:24:15] increasing in the knowledge of god
[1:24:18] strengthened with all might according to
[1:24:20] his glorious power unto all patience and
[1:24:23] long suffering with joyfulness
[1:24:26] brother brown says and the fruit of the
[1:24:28] spirit is love joy peace long suffering
[1:24:30] goodness gentleness patience meekness
[1:24:32] temperance
[1:24:33] fruits of the spirit god knows today
[1:24:35] that what the holiness people need and
[1:24:37] also the calvinist all of them needs
[1:24:39] today is more fruit of the spirit
[1:24:42] more lives to prove it
[1:24:45] we've had many testimonies but as the
[1:24:48] old saying is your life speaks so loud i
[1:24:51] can't hear your voice
[1:24:53] we are written epistles of god
[1:24:55] read of all men
[1:24:59] so here we are the people of god called
[1:25:01] and chosen to be fruitful
[1:25:04] and i'm believing
[1:25:06] saved sanctified justified
[1:25:09] let's get them in order justified
[1:25:10] sanctified
[1:25:13] and filled with the holy ghost
[1:25:15] i want to believe that for everyone in
[1:25:17] this building
[1:25:20] and here we are
[1:25:21] and yet even in that condition you can
[1:25:24] go through dry times
[1:25:31] you can go through times where you
[1:25:34] let your guard down a little bit
[1:25:38] we find ourselves
[1:25:41] in a situation when we do those things
[1:25:43] like brother branham was speaking to
[1:25:44] those at the very beginning
[1:25:46] god bless you in the balcony as somebody
[1:25:49] up in the balcony would say brother
[1:25:50] brown them i once had the victory
[1:25:53] i once was a godly person but somehow
[1:25:55] weeds and thorns and things have choked
[1:25:57] me down
[1:25:58] now listen
[1:26:00] let's keep it in line with what we've
[1:26:01] been preaching i'm not talking about
[1:26:03] going back into the world
[1:26:05] i'm not talking about sinning
[1:26:09] okay i'm not talking about living a life
[1:26:11] of sin i'm talking about someone who
[1:26:13] finds that they don't have the victory
[1:26:15] quite like they once had
[1:26:17] i'm talking about that somebody who
[1:26:19] finds that their joy just isn't quite as
[1:26:21] full as it once was
[1:26:23] maybe little things are nagging at your
[1:26:25] life
[1:26:26] something is choking down the harvest so
[1:26:29] you just aren't bringing forth a harvest
[1:26:31] like you know the word says you can
[1:26:32] 30-fold 60-fold 100-fold
[1:26:36] it doesn't take sinful things to rob you
[1:26:41] remember that
[1:26:42] as a matter of fact the the scripture
[1:26:44] very specifically says that the seeds
[1:26:46] were choked out by the cares of life
[1:26:49] it doesn't take sinful things to rob you
[1:26:52] of the harvest that god wants you to
[1:26:54] have of the fruits that he wants you to
[1:26:56] bear but regardless of why
[1:26:59] regardless of the reason if you find
[1:27:01] yourself in this place where you just
[1:27:02] aren't progressing forward
[1:27:05] i want to ask you a question
[1:27:07] how up-to-date is your experience
[1:27:10] when is the last time that you actually
[1:27:12] took another step with god
[1:27:15] notice i'm not saying you backed up
[1:27:17] but when's the last time you took
[1:27:19] another step
[1:27:20] that you progressed farther
[1:27:23] listen brother tim did an amazing job on
[1:27:25] sunday dealing with how our experiences
[1:27:27] are not just a one-and-done
[1:27:31] that we go from glory to glory that we
[1:27:32] have refillings and that experience is
[1:27:34] built upon experiences and and that you
[1:27:36] must keep moving and that you must
[1:27:38] experience more of god that you don't
[1:27:41] serve god on a memory
[1:27:43] we don't serve god on what happened
[1:27:47] last service was amazing but what about
[1:27:49] tonight
[1:27:50] last year's oklahoma camp was amazing
[1:27:53] but what about this one coming up god
[1:27:55] what about right now
[1:27:57] if you have come into dry places in your
[1:27:59] life what i'm offering you tonight is a
[1:28:01] fresh drink because the holy ghost is a
[1:28:04] gusher and it's welling up and it's
[1:28:05] there for you you just gotta stop you
[1:28:07] just gotta take time and you gotta take
[1:28:09] another drink and don't let a day go by
[1:28:11] that you don't take a drink don't let a
[1:28:13] day go by that you don't stop and
[1:28:14] fellowship with the holy spirit on the
[1:28:16] inside of you
[1:28:18] because that keeps you fresh that keeps
[1:28:19] you annoying and it keeps you full of
[1:28:21] power it gives you the ability to
[1:28:24] overcome
[1:28:25] the way that you need to overcome
[1:28:27] our experiences with god are not a
[1:28:29] one-time thing he calls you to many
[1:28:31] different levels he calls you to more of
[1:28:34] himself
[1:28:36] so tonight i'm telling you press forward
[1:28:38] take another step now listen i know some
[1:28:40] of you are thinking but i thought once
[1:28:41] you're filled with yes once you're
[1:28:43] filled with the holy ghost and you have
[1:28:44] that experience the upper room
[1:28:46] experience like they did in the book of
[1:28:47] acts you are sealed unto the day of
[1:28:48] redemption
[1:28:51] but we got many here that are seeking
[1:28:53] for just that
[1:28:55] and i'm telling you many times they come
[1:28:57] up and they realize they don't have it
[1:28:58] and so the devil will point to the last
[1:29:01] thing that happened to him and says that
[1:29:02] wasn't nothing no sir if you had a real
[1:29:04] experience as a real experience build on
[1:29:06] it
[1:29:07] build on that experience don't throw
[1:29:08] that experience away you recognize you
[1:29:10] need more drive another stake down
[1:29:12] tonight and if you need more sunday
[1:29:13] drive another state town and drive
[1:29:15] another state down until you get what it
[1:29:17] is you're seeking for but don't throw
[1:29:19] away the things god has done for you
[1:29:21] don't let the devil belittle what
[1:29:22] happened to you last time you came down
[1:29:24] for prayer oh you didn't get nothing
[1:29:26] he's just telling you that because he's
[1:29:28] scared of what you got and he's scared
[1:29:30] of what you're gonna get
[1:29:32] don't let him rob you of what god has
[1:29:34] done for you already
[1:29:42] seek for more
[1:29:44] walk to another milestone
[1:29:46] because listen if you're always walking
[1:29:48] forward
[1:29:50] you will never point backward to what
[1:29:52] you were as being something greater than
[1:29:54] what you are
[1:29:59] the only time if you're always walking
[1:30:01] with god the only time you'll ever point
[1:30:02] back is say i used to be that but god
[1:30:04] has brought me here the devil used to
[1:30:06] have me but he don't have me no more the
[1:30:08] devil held me bondage but now i'm free
[1:30:09] you'll never go i used to be in a better
[1:30:12] place
[1:30:14] because if that's the case you are
[1:30:16] backslidden
[1:30:18] but if you're walking with god and
[1:30:19] you're feeding on the word anytime you
[1:30:21] will never point backwards to something
[1:30:23] that was greater than what you have
[1:30:25] right now
[1:30:28] if god did something wonderful for you
[1:30:30] don't stop right there feed it
[1:30:32] feed what god did for you grow from it
[1:30:35] get more tomorrow seek more tomorrow
[1:30:38] how many times have i seen
[1:30:41] mighty deliverances
[1:30:44] i can think specifically of one where me
[1:30:45] and brother tim were praying for a
[1:30:46] sister at youth camp
[1:30:49] i can think of several with me and
[1:30:50] brother joe
[1:30:52] mighty deliverances or the holy spirit
[1:30:55] falling upon somebody
[1:30:57] or seeing discernment directly deal with
[1:30:59] a person's life in ways that would blow
[1:31:01] your mind
[1:31:02] and within months or a year
[1:31:05] or a few years or whatever it is they're
[1:31:06] right back in the condition they were
[1:31:08] before that experience
[1:31:11] oh brother aaron
[1:31:13] that must not have been a real
[1:31:14] experience
[1:31:15] no no
[1:31:16] it was very real
[1:31:18] it was a very real experience but the
[1:31:20] problem was
[1:31:22] they thought that was the end
[1:31:25] when it was the beginning
[1:31:28] they thought i've arrived when they were
[1:31:31] just starting their journey
[1:31:34] and there was no hunger to feed it and
[1:31:36] make it grow
[1:31:38] there was no hunger to progress into it
[1:31:41] there must be a hunger for more one of
[1:31:44] the greatest signs i know of of a solid
[1:31:46] experience is an intense desire for more
[1:31:49] of what you got
[1:31:53] brother branham would say now
[1:31:55] i'll give you my estimation of what i
[1:31:57] think that the closest thing to an
[1:31:59] evidence that a man is a christian than
[1:32:01] anything i know of you know what it is
[1:32:04] it's travail of soul
[1:32:06] a person that's always so hungering and
[1:32:09] thirsting for god they just simply day
[1:32:12] and night they just can't stand it
[1:32:14] they've got to do something for god
[1:32:17] there is a hunger there is a burning
[1:32:19] desire for more i gotta have more of it
[1:32:22] because if you don't have a desire for
[1:32:24] more of it i wonder if you ever tasted
[1:32:26] it
[1:32:29] because once you taste it you're going
[1:32:30] to want more of it
[1:32:32] you can't stop getting more of it
[1:32:35] when you have an experience with god
[1:32:38] moving deeper into this when you reclaim
[1:32:41] a portion
[1:32:42] of that fallen nature
[1:32:45] and you begin to subdue it
[1:32:47] that's when the battle begins
[1:32:49] because nature always tries to take back
[1:32:52] what it is that it lost
[1:32:56] listen a person with the holy ghost
[1:32:57] isn't going to go out and commit
[1:32:58] adultery
[1:32:59] a person with the holy ghost won't go
[1:33:01] seek out pornography they won't go out
[1:33:03] and willfully sin
[1:33:05] but don't think there ain't going to be
[1:33:06] traps for you
[1:33:08] don't think there's not going to be
[1:33:09] attacks on you don't think that there's
[1:33:11] not going to be your weak spot weak
[1:33:13] spots that are probed at
[1:33:15] don't think that temptations aren't
[1:33:16] going to come at you stronger than ever
[1:33:19] this is why you must have an up-to-date
[1:33:22] and fresh experience because you have to
[1:33:24] have the strength to push through those
[1:33:26] things when those things come at you
[1:33:29] that's why you have to keep subduing and
[1:33:31] keep pushing and keep expanding your
[1:33:33] territory and growing larger and pushing
[1:33:35] the borders back and pushing the evil
[1:33:37] back why would i want to live inside
[1:33:39] this little circle of freedom where i
[1:33:41] can't take a step that way and i can't
[1:33:42] take a step that way because that's all
[1:33:44] the freedom i got no but i want to take
[1:33:46] the sword and i want to expand my
[1:33:48] borders this way and expand my borders
[1:33:50] that way and expand them in every
[1:33:52] direction so i can have freedom
[1:33:54] so i can live in a godly atmosphere
[1:33:58] you got to keep pushing
[1:34:00] keep progressing keep subduing
[1:34:03] because the minute you sit down
[1:34:06] the minute you relax
[1:34:08] the moment you take a break
[1:34:12] gardeners gardeners will know what i'm
[1:34:14] talking about
[1:34:16] weeds thorns
[1:34:19] thistles
[1:34:21] and the hunger of nature begins to creep
[1:34:23] in
[1:34:25] what do you mean by the hunger of nature
[1:34:27] brother aaron
[1:34:29] what do you mean
[1:34:30] that nature always tries to reclaim what
[1:34:32] is taken from it
[1:34:34] do you have those pictures from me i
[1:34:35] just thought i'd bring a visual aid
[1:34:36] tonight
[1:34:39] it's an escalator
[1:34:42] inside of a mall
[1:34:46] we're used to there was life
[1:34:48] used to there was people
[1:34:50] used to it had a purpose there was
[1:34:52] people coming there was people going
[1:34:55] you would have walked in that you to
[1:34:57] never envision this
[1:35:00] but nature is always hungering to
[1:35:02] reclaim what was taken from it
[1:35:05] it's always looking for an opportunity
[1:35:08] next one
[1:35:11] somebody used to live here
[1:35:13] there was life there was a family
[1:35:16] there was thanksgivings
[1:35:18] there was christmases
[1:35:21] maybe grandbaby's feet ran across the
[1:35:23] floor for the first time
[1:35:25] now
[1:35:27] it's reclaimed
[1:35:29] nature came in
[1:35:31] the moment
[1:35:33] that it quit being taken care of
[1:35:37] next one
[1:35:39] an entire village in china that was
[1:35:42] abandoned
[1:35:45] reclaimed
[1:35:47] you can go the next one
[1:35:50] another picture of that same village
[1:35:54] you can clear a spot in the woods
[1:35:56] you can cut down all the trees you can
[1:35:58] clear you a nice yard there
[1:36:01] you can build a home you can plant a
[1:36:02] nice garden and that place can be so
[1:36:05] full of life
[1:36:06] but you got to stay on top of it
[1:36:09] because nature is gonna try to creep
[1:36:11] back in
[1:36:13] this weed pops up and you deal with it
[1:36:15] and this thorn pops up and you deal with
[1:36:16] it
[1:36:18] and you run over here and you cut this
[1:36:19] one down you run over here and you cut
[1:36:21] this one down you spray the whole yard
[1:36:22] with roundup and you think i got it but
[1:36:23] two weeks later
[1:36:29] you can have wonderful grass planted
[1:36:31] but try to go one year without
[1:36:33] fertilizing it
[1:36:36] have a great experience but go a long
[1:36:37] time without fertilizing it with the
[1:36:39] word fertilizing that experience with
[1:36:40] faith and all sudden there's weeds
[1:36:42] trying to creep back in
[1:36:45] nature trying to take back what it was
[1:36:47] that was stole from it
[1:36:49] the weed pops up and you deal with it
[1:36:51] tries to grow and you cut it down
[1:36:53] but you stop taking care of it for one
[1:36:55] minute stop tending to it for one little
[1:36:57] bit stop caring for it the way you
[1:36:59] should
[1:37:00] stop subduing nature the way you did
[1:37:03] when you first got it
[1:37:07] stop praying as much as you used to
[1:37:10] stop reading your bible as much as you
[1:37:11] used to stop playing sermons as much as
[1:37:13] you used to and soon weeds begin to move
[1:37:16] in amongst your grass stop working the
[1:37:18] garden the way you use tooth and keeping
[1:37:20] the weeds out the way you used to and
[1:37:21] soon your harvest won't be what it used
[1:37:24] to be
[1:37:25] the harvest won't be what you're
[1:37:27] expecting the weeds and the thorns will
[1:37:29] take over because they will never stop
[1:37:32] trying they will never stop pushing they
[1:37:34] will never stop trying to crowd you in
[1:37:36] but i'm telling you that's okay because
[1:37:38] a holy ghost-filled christian is never
[1:37:40] going to stop pushing back never going
[1:37:41] to stop feeding never going to stop
[1:37:43] fighting never going to stop overcoming
[1:37:45] we can't stop there's something on the
[1:37:47] inside of us that won't let us stop some
[1:37:49] days i'm tired some days i want to lay
[1:37:51] it down but i can't lay it down i can't
[1:37:54] quit there's a deep calling to the deep
[1:37:56] keep fighting keep pushing expand and
[1:38:00] subdue
[1:38:09] you got to stay on top of it because the
[1:38:11] weeds choke out life
[1:38:13] by robbing the nutrients
[1:38:15] that were meant for the crops
[1:38:18] by getting you tangled all up in
[1:38:19] complexes
[1:38:20] they choke out your joy they choke out
[1:38:22] your victory you gotta chop the weeds
[1:38:25] back you gotta have the attitude of i
[1:38:27] will subdue more look i've got this
[1:38:30] parcel but i want more joy so i'm going
[1:38:31] to take it i've got this parcel but i
[1:38:34] want more peace so i'm going to take it
[1:38:36] i need victory over this thing that
[1:38:37] keeps hindering my life so i'm going to
[1:38:39] go out and i'm going to take it because
[1:38:40] now i have the power to subdue i don't
[1:38:43] have to live with my problems i don't
[1:38:45] have to live with these complexes i
[1:38:47] don't have to live with fear i don't
[1:38:49] have to live with these things because
[1:38:50] i've been given the power to subdue
[1:38:52] those things
[1:38:53] i'm called to be a fruitful christian so
[1:38:56] now i'm going to subdue pride i'm going
[1:38:58] to subdue selfishness
[1:39:00] i'm going to subdue the things that keep
[1:39:01] me out of the house of god
[1:39:03] i'm going to subdue those things i'm
[1:39:05] going to subdue my anger i'm going to
[1:39:07] subdue my temper because i'm called to
[1:39:10] be a fruitful christian
[1:39:15] and yet nature hungers
[1:39:16] and flesh hungers
[1:39:18] but the spirit on the inside also
[1:39:21] hungers and as long as that's what you
[1:39:22] feed it will be victorious
[1:39:26] the spirit man will continually subdue
[1:39:29] the flesh man
[1:39:31] that's why experiences once again must
[1:39:33] be up to date and they cannot be
[1:39:35] stagnant because when it's stagnant
[1:39:37] that's when weeds grow when it's
[1:39:39] stagnant that's when thorns grow listen
[1:39:41] you can't feed natural man
[1:39:43] all the time and then wonder where your
[1:39:44] spiritual harvest is
[1:39:48] you sprinkle in these movies and
[1:39:49] sprinkle in this and sprinkle in a
[1:39:51] little bit of that and then you go
[1:39:53] where'd the weeds come from
[1:39:55] you planted them
[1:39:58] you literally took a handful
[1:40:02] from the evil sower and went
[1:40:04] i'll take a little bit of that
[1:40:08] and you threw it in your own garden
[1:40:11] and you wonder where'd it come from
[1:40:18] we're gonna do our best to bring this
[1:40:19] down
[1:40:22] maybe you've been noticing that the
[1:40:24] harvest hasn't been as plenty
[1:40:26] maybe the joy isn't there like it once
[1:40:28] was the self-control the patience the
[1:40:30] kindness
[1:40:32] it's time to start examining your patch
[1:40:34] of ground
[1:40:37] have you been tending your life the way
[1:40:39] you used to when you first fell in love
[1:40:40] with jesus
[1:40:42] checking it up all the time that joy was
[1:40:45] there and you were checking to make sure
[1:40:46] am i doing everything right
[1:40:47] i'm not doing everything sometimes we
[1:40:49] look at that and go yeah that's the sign
[1:40:50] of an immature christian that's the
[1:40:51] sound of somebody that's deeply in love
[1:40:52] and they want to please the father
[1:40:56] am i doing everything right is it lining
[1:40:58] up with the word is this how i'm
[1:40:59] supposed to be are you checking up are
[1:41:00] you watching vigilantly over the fruit
[1:41:03] making sure no weeds are coming into
[1:41:04] your rose making sure that there's
[1:41:06] nothing there robbing the life from your
[1:41:08] harvest
[1:41:09] it's time to start searching for the
[1:41:12] cause of your harvest being down
[1:41:15] it's like them big
[1:41:16] green
[1:41:18] horn tomato worms
[1:41:21] you go out there and all of a sudden
[1:41:22] your plants eat up you don't go
[1:41:24] bad luck
[1:41:26] better luck next time i know you find
[1:41:28] the worm
[1:41:29] you search for it you look for it then
[1:41:31] you find it then you kill it you don't
[1:41:32] pick it up and go oh cute little worm
[1:41:36] it probably won't hurt this plant let me
[1:41:37] move it over here
[1:41:39] that's how we all was to oh my temper
[1:41:41] got me again
[1:41:43] let me just move it to next week
[1:41:47] maybe it won't hurt me next week
[1:41:50] yeah it will it'll eat that plant it'll
[1:41:52] eat the joy there it'll eat the harvest
[1:41:53] there and it'll keep robbing and keep
[1:41:55] robbing and keep robbing until you find
[1:41:56] that thing go yep there he is there's
[1:41:59] the problem boom squashing problem dealt
[1:42:02] with problem solved now i can walk in
[1:42:04] victory now i can have joy because my
[1:42:06] plan ain't getting heating up my harvest
[1:42:08] isn't getting eaten up because i dealt
[1:42:09] with the problem
[1:42:11] we got to start dealing with the issues
[1:42:14] there's something robbing you
[1:42:16] of your harvest
[1:42:20] why do i not yield fruit like i should
[1:42:25] what is it that we found that chokes the
[1:42:26] life out of it thorns thistles
[1:42:30] cursed earth which is
[1:42:33] your flesh
[1:42:35] brother brown says what we needs in old
[1:42:37] fashion scoring out digging out get
[1:42:39] those weeds out the patch so the corn
[1:42:42] can grow
[1:42:42] jesus is coming all right that's what we
[1:42:45] need back to the old hewing line again
[1:42:47] back to the way god will come among us
[1:42:52] sometimes we have to go through terrible
[1:42:53] chastisement chastening of the lord many
[1:42:55] things to correct us
[1:42:57] that we'll be fruit bearing christians
[1:43:00] sometimes he has to prune us cut off
[1:43:02] take away take out of our hands we think
[1:43:04] sometimes oh god what are you doing to
[1:43:06] us but he knows what he's doing so we
[1:43:08] pray father that today you will prune
[1:43:10] every one of us from the least to the
[1:43:12] greatest
[1:43:13] to the least to the greatest pastor god
[1:43:15] we pray that you'll prune every one of
[1:43:17] us take away all that's unlike you
[1:43:19] father take away the thing that's
[1:43:21] hindering us from being fruit bearing
[1:43:24] christians
[1:43:28] god does not look kindly on things that
[1:43:31] are supposed to bear fruit
[1:43:33] but don't
[1:43:35] how do you know
[1:43:37] well if you could i'd say ask the fig
[1:43:39] tree
[1:43:44] it says and when he saw a fig tree in
[1:43:45] the way he came to it and found nothing
[1:43:47] their own but leaves only and said unto
[1:43:50] it let no fruit grow on thee henceforth
[1:43:51] forever
[1:43:52] and presently the fig tree rivered away
[1:43:55] why
[1:43:56] because he expected
[1:43:59] fruit
[1:44:01] he's expecting
[1:44:04] fruit
[1:44:05] don't get caught with the master coming
[1:44:07] by and finding the field overgrown
[1:44:12] don't get caught with the master coming
[1:44:14] by and finding the wall torn down
[1:44:17] seeing that nature
[1:44:18] has taken the fruit away
[1:44:21] back to our opening scripture proverbs
[1:44:23] 24 31
[1:44:27] and actually what's happening here is
[1:44:28] solomon is out for a walk
[1:44:31] that man didn't know the king was going
[1:44:32] to come by his place that day
[1:44:36] he didn't know the king was walking down
[1:44:37] the road
[1:44:40] and lo it was
[1:44:42] all grown over verse 31 with thorns and
[1:44:45] nettles
[1:44:46] had covered the face thereof and the
[1:44:48] stone wall thereof was broken down
[1:44:51] then i saw and considered it well i
[1:44:54] looked upon it and received instruction
[1:44:57] listen as solomon strolls by like i said
[1:44:59] that man had no idea that that day was
[1:45:01] his day of visitation you don't know
[1:45:03] when the king's coming
[1:45:06] but of the times and the seasons
[1:45:08] brethren you have no need that i write
[1:45:09] unto you for you yourselves know
[1:45:11] perfectly that the day of the lord so
[1:45:12] cometh as a thief in the night
[1:45:16] mark 13 33 take ye heed watch and pray
[1:45:19] for you know not when the time is
[1:45:24] but when the king comes by all he finds
[1:45:26] are symptoms of the curse
[1:45:30] thistles
[1:45:32] thorns things i died to give them power
[1:45:34] over
[1:45:36] i gave my life so i wouldn't find this
[1:45:40] i gave my life and sent back my holy
[1:45:42] spirit that they would bear fruit
[1:45:44] that they would be protected behind the
[1:45:46] word that they would stand there and
[1:45:48] have a shield that they would put on the
[1:45:50] breastplate of righteousness
[1:45:52] i gave them armor i gave them things to
[1:45:53] keep this from happening
[1:46:00] he finds fallen nature reclaiming a
[1:46:03] field
[1:46:04] he finds the wall of protection broken
[1:46:06] down
[1:46:07] even if the field had been growing a
[1:46:09] crop the wild beast would have divided
[1:46:11] it all because the wall had been left
[1:46:12] unattended too
[1:46:14] and solomon makes the statement i
[1:46:16] received instruction
[1:46:18] and what he means right there is i knew
[1:46:21] all i needed to know about that person's
[1:46:23] life
[1:46:25] i looked at it he said and i received
[1:46:27] instruction
[1:46:28] and then he goes on to say how
[1:46:31] and i'm paraphrasing
[1:46:32] put that scripture up for me so i don't
[1:46:34] have to paraphrase it
[1:46:39] then i saw and considered it well and
[1:46:41] looked upon it and received instruction
[1:46:44] next
[1:46:46] yet a little sleep a little slumber a
[1:46:48] little folding of the hands to sleep in
[1:46:50] other words you didn't deal with things
[1:46:51] you just laid around
[1:46:53] you laid in bed you didn't deal with it
[1:46:55] yeah that that wall needs to be built
[1:46:56] back up yeah
[1:46:58] i need to go get some of those weeds out
[1:47:00] it's right
[1:47:01] but you know what a little sleep
[1:47:03] next
[1:47:04] so thy poverty
[1:47:06] come as one that travaileth and i won't
[1:47:09] as an armed man
[1:47:11] you're gonna be found without a harvest
[1:47:13] you're gonna be found wanting and it's
[1:47:15] coming upon you quickly
[1:47:17] because you didn't deal with things
[1:47:22] how's your harvest evening like
[1:47:23] tabernacle
[1:47:25] is your life yielding the fruits of the
[1:47:27] spirit if the king walks by today how
[1:47:30] will he find your wall of defense
[1:47:32] how will he find the harvest i say it's
[1:47:34] in time it's time that we go inspect our
[1:47:36] rows
[1:47:38] i say that it's time that we go inspect
[1:47:40] our field to make sure there ain't no
[1:47:41] creepers coming in and choking out the
[1:47:43] life
[1:47:43] it's time to take the sword of the word
[1:47:45] and cut back the weeds and cut back the
[1:47:47] thorns and cut back the pixels and i say
[1:47:49] it's not too late to do so
[1:47:52] it's time to subdue the land that you
[1:47:54] once had i'm not saying you've given it
[1:47:56] all back but what i'm saying is you woke
[1:47:57] up one day and realized something's
[1:47:59] creeped in here something's crept in
[1:48:00] there i don't have as much joy as i used
[1:48:03] to have and i don't want the king to
[1:48:05] find my field in this condition
[1:48:07] i don't want the king to see my wall in
[1:48:09] this condition
[1:48:10] i want to do something about it's not
[1:48:12] too late but now is the time
[1:48:15] now is the time to do it now is the time
[1:48:18] to drive the enemy from the field
[1:48:24] proverbs 25 and 28
[1:48:27] says he that hath no rule over his own
[1:48:29] spirit
[1:48:30] we're just bringing this now it ends
[1:48:32] with the wall and the fruits of the
[1:48:33] spirit
[1:48:34] because what this is speaking of is
[1:48:35] temperance self-control
[1:48:38] he that hath no rule over his own spirit
[1:48:40] is like a city
[1:48:41] that is broken down and without walls
[1:48:45] when the walls are broken down all that
[1:48:47] is good goes out
[1:48:50] and all that is evil breaks in
[1:48:54] now is at the time now is the moment to
[1:48:57] inspect your walls
[1:48:58] inspect the walls make sure they're
[1:49:00] strong
[1:49:01] brother aaron a couple weeks ago you
[1:49:02] preached don't tear down the wall that
[1:49:04] was different that was man-made walls
[1:49:06] i'm talking about the walls that god has
[1:49:07] given you providing you protection in
[1:49:10] this day
[1:49:14] inspect the walls
[1:49:16] a wall that is functioning according to
[1:49:18] its purpose will completely surround the
[1:49:20] area it is intended to protect and it
[1:49:22] will establish the boundaries of
[1:49:25] separation
[1:49:27] that fallen nature is out there but on
[1:49:29] this side of the wall on this side of
[1:49:31] the wall is an eden condition i'm
[1:49:33] keeping cursed nature out i'm keeping
[1:49:35] the power of the flesh out but from here
[1:49:37] i rule my flesh but from here i'm in
[1:49:40] control right here
[1:49:42] i have the power to operate and i'm
[1:49:44] keeping the wall built up because i'm
[1:49:46] not going out and i'm not letting it
[1:49:47] come in
[1:49:49] the wall of protection in behind that
[1:49:51] wall you can have your harvest
[1:49:53] how is the wall tonight around your soul
[1:49:56] how is the wall that you've built around
[1:49:58] your children
[1:49:59] how is the wall around your home tonight
[1:50:03] i say let's build it back tonight
[1:50:05] i say we start tonight building it back
[1:50:08] and when you go to do it the devil's not
[1:50:10] going to make it easy on you
[1:50:12] he's going to bring all kind of
[1:50:13] condemnation and things and tell you
[1:50:15] what you're doing is is futile and it's
[1:50:17] not going to work
[1:50:19] because anytime you begin to look and
[1:50:21] take an honest inventory and an honest
[1:50:23] assessment of where you are it will
[1:50:25] always stir up the devil
[1:50:28] anytime you begin to truly look inward
[1:50:30] and take an assessment and see where am
[1:50:32] i at the devil doesn't like that
[1:50:35] the devil doesn't like you to take
[1:50:37] honest assessment he wants you to be
[1:50:38] comfortable right where you are
[1:50:40] he doesn't want you to rebuild the wall
[1:50:42] or push back the weeds because that hole
[1:50:45] in the wall is his access to your
[1:50:47] victory
[1:50:48] so he doesn't want it fixed
[1:50:52] and we're going to close here with
[1:50:53] nehemiah
[1:50:55] because nehemiah goes back to build back
[1:50:57] the wall around jerusalem he weeps when
[1:51:00] he finds out that it's torn down because
[1:51:02] there's no defense and the people are
[1:51:03] easy praise
[1:51:06] nehemiah 2 19 and we're going to read
[1:51:08] some of this
[1:51:10] but when san bala
[1:51:12] the knight and tobiah the servant
[1:51:14] the ammonite and geshem the arabian
[1:51:16] heard it they laughed us to scorn notice
[1:51:18] none of these were israelites
[1:51:21] they laughed us to scorn and despised us
[1:51:23] and said what is this thing that you do
[1:51:26] will you rebel against the king
[1:51:28] then answered out them and said unto
[1:51:30] them the god of heaven he will prosper
[1:51:32] us and therefore we his servants will
[1:51:34] arise and build but ye have no portion
[1:51:38] nor right nor memorial in jerusalem
[1:51:42] notice the mocking and the jeering and
[1:51:44] they try to mock your progress what are
[1:51:46] you really trying to do evening like
[1:51:48] tabernacle
[1:51:49] do you really think that stone you just
[1:51:51] put up on top of that other stone's
[1:51:52] gonna provide you any protection
[1:51:54] they act as if it's all
[1:51:56] nothing has actually ever happened to
[1:51:58] you it's all in your imagination
[1:52:01] but all the while what it is is they see
[1:52:02] a wall going up
[1:52:04] oh they're telling you oh that's not
[1:52:06] doing nothing oh that's not doing
[1:52:07] nothing but all the time they're seeing
[1:52:08] stone upon stone and stone next to stone
[1:52:11] and stone next to stone and so they're
[1:52:13] trying to get you to stop because they
[1:52:15] are seeing what it is you're
[1:52:16] accomplishing
[1:52:17] and they know it will keep them out
[1:52:21] of course the devil's going to try to
[1:52:23] talk you out of building up your wall
[1:52:25] tonight that's what's going to keep him
[1:52:27] out of your victory
[1:52:32] i love how he tells them
[1:52:35] he will prosper us therefore we his
[1:52:37] servants will rise and build but ye have
[1:52:39] no portion nor right nor memorial in
[1:52:42] jerusalem
[1:52:44] he says this is going to keep you out
[1:52:46] and that's how it should be because you
[1:52:48] don't even belong here satan you don't
[1:52:50] belong in here this was ripped away from
[1:52:52] you this was cursed earth but now it's
[1:52:55] eating on the inside of me it's a place
[1:52:58] i operate from in power you can't come
[1:53:00] in here
[1:53:02] you have no memorial here you have no
[1:53:04] right here this was stripped from you
[1:53:07] that day on calvary
[1:53:10] oh the beast don't like to see the
[1:53:12] garden wall repaired
[1:53:16] they don't like to see it because
[1:53:17] they're used to robbing that
[1:53:20] but that's not their portion
[1:53:22] that's for you
[1:53:24] that's yours that's your inheritance
[1:53:26] that's your harvest
[1:53:28] of course they don't like it wall them
[1:53:30] out
[1:53:33] young people when you start building up
[1:53:35] that was because you hadn't done nothing
[1:53:38] you really didn't get anything look at
[1:53:40] all the rest of that wall that's torn
[1:53:42] down look at all that
[1:53:44] listen every victory matters
[1:53:46] every experience matters
[1:53:49] they were real
[1:53:50] the devil just hates to see stones going
[1:53:52] up he hates to see stones going out
[1:53:56] chapter four verse one but it came to
[1:53:58] pass that when sam balot heard that we
[1:54:00] builded the wall he was wroth
[1:54:02] and took great indignation and mocked
[1:54:04] the jews
[1:54:05] and he spake before his brethren and the
[1:54:06] army of samaria and said what do these
[1:54:09] feeble jews
[1:54:11] will they fortify themselves will they
[1:54:13] sacrifice will they make an end in a day
[1:54:16] will they revive the stones out of the
[1:54:17] heaps of the rubbish which are burned
[1:54:20] now to buy the ammonite was by him and
[1:54:22] he said even that that they built if a
[1:54:25] fox go up he shall even break down their
[1:54:27] stone wall
[1:54:29] you think that's going to keep an army
[1:54:31] out if a fox runs into that it's going
[1:54:33] to knock it over
[1:54:35] and he's mocking you the whole time
[1:54:37] trying to get you to see it through
[1:54:39] that testimony
[1:54:41] because in the reality of it they know
[1:54:43] they're closing us out
[1:54:45] i've had free access to that harvest for
[1:54:47] years i've been taking that away from
[1:54:49] shamgar for years i've been robbing him
[1:54:51] for years but now he's building a wall
[1:54:53] he's building a wall and now i'm going
[1:54:55] to be locked out i'm going to be kept
[1:54:56] out i will not be able to rob his
[1:54:58] victory anymore
[1:54:59] verse seven but it came to pass that
[1:55:02] when sand ballad and tobiah and the
[1:55:03] arabians and the ammonites and the
[1:55:04] astrodites heard that the walls of
[1:55:06] jerusalem were made up and that the
[1:55:08] breaches began to be stopped then they
[1:55:10] were very roth and conspiring all of
[1:55:12] them together to come and to fight
[1:55:14] against jerusalem and hinder it even
[1:55:16] like tabernacle they're gathering their
[1:55:17] forth as the fight against you
[1:55:19] nevertheless we made our prayer unto god
[1:55:22] and we set a watch against them day and
[1:55:24] night because of them and judah said the
[1:55:26] strength of the bearers of burdens is
[1:55:28] decayed and there is much rubbish so
[1:55:30] that we are not able to build the wall
[1:55:32] and our adversaries said they shall not
[1:55:34] know neither see till we come in the
[1:55:36] midst of them and slay them and cause
[1:55:38] the work to cease and it came to pass
[1:55:40] that when the jews which dwelt by them
[1:55:41] came they said unto us ten times from
[1:55:44] all places which you shall return unto
[1:55:46] us they will be upon you
[1:55:48] they're about to be upon you evening
[1:55:50] like tabernacle as you're trying to
[1:55:52] rebuild the wall what are we going to do
[1:55:54] what are we going to do about it are we
[1:55:55] going to quit building the wall
[1:55:57] are we going to give up on the harvest
[1:55:59] we're called to be fruit bearers we've
[1:56:01] got to protect the harvest what is it
[1:56:03] we're going to do
[1:56:04] therefore said i in the lower places
[1:56:06] behind the wall and on the higher places
[1:56:08] i even set the people after their
[1:56:10] families with their swords their spears
[1:56:13] and their bows and i looked and rose up
[1:56:15] and said unto the nobles and to the
[1:56:17] rulers and to the rest of the people be
[1:56:19] not ye afraid of them remember the lord
[1:56:22] which is great and terrible and fight
[1:56:24] for your brethren fight for your sons
[1:56:26] fight for your daughters fight for your
[1:56:28] wives fight for your houses even like

[1:56:33] for your children pull your sword get on
[1:56:35] the wall fight for me i'll fight for you

[1:56:40] friends fight fight fight press the
[1:56:43] battle subdue it so do it it's yours you
[1:56:48] are called to be fruitful

[1:57:08] the enemy will be kept out of the
[1:57:09] harvest i will have my joy i will have
[1:57:12] my peace i will have my patience i will
[1:57:15] have all that i'm called to have
[1:57:18] and i will build a wall around my family
[1:57:20] and they will have it too

[1:57:26] hallelujah
