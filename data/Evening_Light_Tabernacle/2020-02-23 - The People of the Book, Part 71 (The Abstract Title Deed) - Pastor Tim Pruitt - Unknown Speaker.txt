however you can say that this morning more just cover us covers for the mercy in your grace amen the love that you bestowed on us even I had some prairie question he'd take before the Lord this

healing sister Atlanta so that we serve a God who heals cancer he requested that we pray for him this morning also and remember brother Johnathan Middleton been in the hospital with breathing issues here this morning but is asking for prayer still having some trouble with that also I remember brother Mike Dexter he had a shoulder surgery this week just in a tremendous amount of pain the doctors went in there and expecting to find something they knew they knew that he had tore his rotator cuff but also had some calcium buildup there and said normally it's about the size of a pea had two of them in his shoulder but they went in that it was actually to him about the size of a walnut said his pain level must be pretty high as tolerance so but just he's dealing a lot of pain recovering for that so I remember him this morning how many would have a need you just want to make it known to the Lord as for the Joe to come an opener service and prayer this morning remembering these needs amens situations they men also want to pray for Jeffrey Yarborough he goes to brother Doug Baker's or in that area anyway he had a fall has multiple brain bleeds he's a I think a young man and I believe

every situation every problem a man ever sickness every disease every everything that you could go through he's lord over it this morning he wants to show himself as Lord to you a man a man I tell you I sometimes feel like we're just walking right in the vision just walking right in the very will and vision and mind of God hallelujah ain't it wonderful just to be in this presence just to know you're in his will and you're walking right in that vision of its plan for your life is a predestinated mystery of its will a man what a privilege in yes I'm looking out seen the different ones that

vision brother Ron Spencer just wrote me as I came out of the office and he said sister Priscilla was singing exactly what he's preaching tonight be not afraid a man and so you know sometimes you don't know who you're ministering to God's using you to confirm something to another and many so on it my thought is Jesus is on the way and nothing can stop him [Applause] I believe that's true for us this morning [Applause] and I heard from sister Shalom from India she is a little sister that's been suffering with cancer I prayed for her the other day as I stood in the presence of God and brother runs living room anyway she said I didn't take any painkillers today brother I'm used to take three to four per day strong ones to stop my burns but today I've taken none I'm slaying the devil every day like I told you praising God for that my God is still called and I'm healed I'm confessing this and praising jobs got a bride the people around the world I believe he's concerned about ever me he'll hear your hearts cry he's never too busy he'll walk right down what's wrong to people around and when he couldn't even physically hear the cry of a blind man there was something still touched his heart and turned him to blind bartimaeus and if you reach out to him this morning he'll come right to your view and he'll speak to your heart reveal himself to you because he's a personal God a man here to minister to you and to your needs let's pray let's talk to the Lord today you just lift a hand to him and say God I need you he'll come right to your view today and speak to your heart reveal himself amen bring you right in the center of his world you're seeking the will of God through your life today he's got the answer for it and he'll produce it and provide him father it's in the name of Jesus that we're looking to you who is the author of the finisher of our faith the healer of ever disease Lord deliver from ever sinned we're people here today that as we said we're we're walking in the vision Lord God looking back seeing upon our wall there today the the Emmaus walk Lord we believe we're walking with you this moment may our eyes come open to your presence among us may you do what you did then that you just take and break the bread of life and no God let us recognize you in the breaking of the bread Lord as you know God may you may Lord as you if you just reach there no doubt like you must must have done them I don't know how it was but somehow they knew you and the breaking of the bread Lord no doubt Oh God they had seen you as you fed the five thousand Yunis you just showed yourself the inexhaustible fountain as you as you just pulled one part off there was another part right there to give larger becomes your Jehovah Jireh you are the provider your God that is more than enough you're the one who does exceeding abundantly above that which we're able to think or ask and we're just asking God you reveal yourself to us Lord in the manner the way that you did in the Bible in the Word of God Lord we're tired of cold theology we're tired of just canned sermons and oh god some preacher upbringing sermonettes we want to hear from you today we want your word Lord to live among us father what good is a word of it dead live Lord what good is the message if it doesn't change lives if it doesn't heal sickness Lord what good is an open-book if it's less power than when it was closed Lord we know who God is an open book with every promise open to us today it opens all the way o God no matter where we are who under the sound of my voice Lord where is it reaches across the world down and of our nation's and moves right down little homes where they're listening right now I pray God your Minister every heart Lord call your bride to the attention of the word today and make the word real to their hearts it's in Jesus name we ask it and we thank you for your goodness Lord amen amen god bless you if you'll turn with me to Revelation 5 and verse 1 we certainly heard of the wonderful not only heard but experienced with you the wonderful outpouring of the Holy Spirit last Sunday as the Lord just moved among you and of course was here for Wednesday night and so hasn't got good to us to give us so many blessings we're not deserving of them but he gives them anyway a man his mercy endures ever it's new every morning a man and here we are approaching to 12 o'clock hour and going to be moving into the afternoon now and so as we as we read from the the Bible let's just accept of something from the Word of God today and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice saying who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said to me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain heaven seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and pointed twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for that was slain and has redeemed us to God by the that blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth god bless you you can have your seats I'm going to take a few moments today and just to kind of bring you up to what we were doing last week is you know most of you know I was with brother Ron Spencer in Alton Virginia he lives in a little town of grottoes and and but the church is in Elton Minh and as you as you know that some of the sermons that I spoke here and that I even spoke to him while I was while I was preaching those sermons here and I'm I went there too and personally addressed him in his church and really this this trip was reminiscent of the trip that I made some 12 years ago when he lay dying after a propane torch accident and was burned severely and laid there in a coma for nearly three weeks and and and then and then of course they would pronounce him brain-dead and and and was was just within hours of planet they were planning to within just hours within five hours to harvest his organs as he was an organ donator and so and of course we saw God come on the scene in a very miraculous way and raised him up from that condition and but I you know again it was reminiscent of that trip that I made some 12 years ago I've been wanting to go there and to be with brother Ron Spencer and his church and the family there and feeling the urge but just not knowing when you know it's some a lot of times you can feel an urge to do something and and the Lord moving on your heart but you want to do it at the right time and so you know I just didn't know when to go there was several different times where he went for tests for the the cancer and would be receiving news and so on like that and there was several opportunities to go brother Joe green actually came from North Carolina went with him to those those times that was very very wonderful of him to to be there and support brother Ron and his family at that time but you know again I didn't know when I was to go I was just feeling the the urge to go and but the Timothy encouraged me by saying you know once again go now you know because that's what he did the last time when I was telling him I was feeling led to go but I just didn't know when and I was at the barn doing chores if you remember 12 years ago the the story of it and brother Timothy said go now dad and I said today I said I'm not through doing George he said we'll take care of them you just get mom and y'all head out and of course we would we would jump in the car it was just a just within an hour or so and and leave out and go all day and and stop for the night and go the next day cuz it's about 18 20 hour drive and so this time again brother Timothy was coming back home from Missouri from a meeting on Monday and he said and said dad I feel the same way it is now time for you to go and I said well you know it that's great son for you to know when to good for me to go but IIIi really need to know you know when I need to go and and so I just you know went to back to prayer about it and thinking of it and considered it and and you know God just miraculously gave us tickets to go that was very reasonable to go to to fly him to Charlottesville Virginia and my wife went along on the companion ticket so she went free and and so you know let me just say that we had a there was just so many many supernatural moments it's just difficult to tell all of them recall all of them perfectly but just signs from God and words of encouragement see ever since I heard of the attack on brother Ronna I've been prayin diligently for him I heard it actually the day after Christmas and I had I had been like Joshua looking at the like looking at the walls of Jericho and you know the enemy's walled off how do I get to him how do we how do we here so here's one of our ministers um that has been attacked and what can I do how do we how do we get to that enemy that is that we've got to break through that wall and you know brother branham told us he said it's one of the most marvelous things I've seen in my life when the greatest hours of my life is when I get up against the wall that I can't get over or under it around it that's right and then I trust God and he opens the way and I go through the thing God takes you to it and then you come out on the other side it's like Samson when he killed the lie and then he got the sweetest honey he ever got out of that old carcass of that line and he said sometimes have you overcome something by the grace of God it'll be one of the sweetest things you ever tasted of in your life you know spiritually what I was speaking of and of course you know um we on the 1st of February we had brother Matt Watkins here and he was speaking our youth banquet and and then on on February the 2nd he spoke here for us on Sunday and his message was just a really timely message of God before us is what he ministered on if you hadn't heard it yeah then you got a responsibility go hear what God said to us and he not having it in his notes you know and of course I'm praying and asking God you know for ever every way for him to speak to me and he he just he said it wasn't it's not my notes but you know I just felt lived felt led to bring in about Jericho and those walls and and being walled off and he says you know it said don't look for a a new way for God to use you but use what God has already given you and take what's in your hand and he used gives different examples of Shamgar and and you know Samson and so on like that that men David with a little sling that he used what was you know the way that God used him and he told us over again we can't go back we're in a place we must go forward and we must start from where we're at and so you know this was very very important to me because I had been praying and just seeking the Lord as a god and my wife can tell you that um you know that it wouldn't be a night that went by that I didn't pray and said Lord somehow speak to me son looking to hear your voice I you know I'm not prone to visions but you said all the old men will dream dreams and young men will see visions and I said so I didn't have many visions when well you know our inhibitions when I was just a young man so you can make up for lost time for me as an old man but somehow to speak to me and you know so I was I was praying that way is as there's about three ways that the Lord uses to speak to me in and others in dreams and then in his voice audible voice that I've heard on numerous occasions and and then of course um other times were that just experience were we're song comes right out of heaven to me and when when I'm when I'm asleep and I waked up hearing from that heavenly round and so you know III was hearing from brother brother but the Matt saying you know don't look for a new way for God to speak to you just look for the way that God uses you and so you know though those things I was just took it in my heart and is you know brother wrong brother Timothy brother George and I were to go to Japan and to the Philippines and and not a feelin led not go at this time because of brother runs illness and then the corona virus that has affected our meetings it wasn't that you know that we can't travel it's that many of the people that were going to meet us from India and Indonesia and other places that were gathering that their countries wouldn't let them to travel without being quarantined and some of them it actually I understand you know review services and so on and and so they we couldn't have the people that were going to gather with us in Japan so I decided to put it off and right now tentatively we're going in June that's um still tentatively we're we're just praying the Lord will you know opened the door or whatever you wants done so instead of going to to Japan and flying out there we my wife and I flew to Charlottesville to be with brother Ron Spencer and we arrived there on Thursday and brother Ronon and sister Connie brother Matthew was there to greet us it was just an emotional time this brother wrong didn't know I was coming and they had brought him up to their brother Matthew had told him said well I've got an appointment here we got to go to the to the airport so they'd went and hung around for a little while and went to the airport and he said what are you going to here for he said well it's for meeting with the TSA well that happens to me Tim secret agency so you know so you know as I walked out you know brother ron was not expecting me and he just grabbed me and weapon my shoulder it was like we were there alone as hundreds of people just walked by and we were just oblivious to everybody around he prayed that morning he says God I need a boost and so you know we when we had heard of his diagnosis which is mr. Detmer status melanoma cancer and it's went to his lungs and as usually starts melanoma usually starts in the skin somewhere and moves to other organs and when it does you know if it moves them from from there from just the surface of the skin that stage one goes deeper stage 2 stage 3 it goes to lymph node Stage four it goes to lung or another organ and so you know we'd heard of his diagnosis and brother Donnie Regan texts me about it and he said brother Tim I'm just heartbroken about it and I said well you know I'm headed to Charlottesville tomorrow son said why don't you just meet me there and we'll double up on the devil you know I figure you know want to put a thousand of light and to put ten thousand so we went to the airport and went from the airport word to the Spencer home brother Donnie and sister Carol had arrived and had been led in their home would have been waiting there but you know as we visited and talked and whatever you know we hadn't Friday that we were going to be together and I didn't know how things were gonna transpire I just knew I wanted the right atmosphere and the right moment and you know the right time just be right in the vision I didn't know exactly how this was going to be and but brother Ron wasn't gonna wait for another day for a prayer no no no he wasn't gonna wait til Friday when we had all day and you know I kind of envisioned talking and then going over the scriptures and spending the day with him and having prayer but no he wasn't gonna wait for another day and you know he was he wasn't like Pharaoh who when when he was asked you know when do you want the frogs to leave he said well tomorrow and so he was willing to spend another night with the Broncs and so but he wasn't like Pharaoh he said I won't prayer right now and I saw I said okay right now he said right now I said well we got all day tomorrow to be together he said no right now and I said okay I said then and then you know I immediately began to just break into the scriptures go into the word was showing divine healing and its promises and that it's God's will to heal and and he heals all diseases and and and just going right down to the scriptures for the next 20 minutes half an hour or so and and the atmosphere came right and the Holy Spirit dropped down and and I cuz I was talking of healing and deliverance and I said you know brother Ron I've been right here at this very place with others where God delivered others who were dying and I was in the room with brother Gary stanky and and brother Timothy had texted me were writing another book of Acts and I was there in a moment in the time where he was a dying man and to see the Holy Spirit just turned that whole situation around in fact that's reason this church was built was on on the very things that he breathes from his very heart and that he asked me to do and we couldn't do at the other location and and then I knew I had a mandate from God and just tell you just I'm just gonna tell you that that blessings of God well we have come here we bought this lamb we never paid a paid a dime of interest we never borrowed money we paid cash for it we paid cash for the whole building we never borrowed a sin on anything God provided everything every time we needed it and and right now I'll just go ahead and announce it to you this and this next week I'm signing the papers on the cell of our old buildings they're behind us and and all of that will be behind us God has blessed us every way miracle after miracle active you know why because he's all set up he is more than enough and I just want you to know for whatever your neediest men no matter if you're overseas over in India or wherever you are or South Africa where you're listening let me tell you he's more than enough he's out satya hey man you can you can know this God is a God that heals and delivers and sets free and provides you're worried about your finances or things today don't worry about it no more you've got a goddess in control a man also you know brother Ron himself was dying from the burns I remind him of that really Kenneth when the doctors called the family and said he was dying his son Brian was called it from Montana Montana to the bedside of his dying father and that was Sunday and you know we went in there with the ministry here and prayed for him that day and asked him what he wanted he said well I want to be in terms for the October two meetings he was there Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and then the dying man's telling it still is not dead he's still alive the devil told him he would die Christmas before Christmas the devil told him he died before New Year's the devil told him he he would die before his granddaughter got married he's facing a birthday here in a couple of days the devil no doubt Toya whispered in his ears you won't live to your birthday but he's still living devil and the devil still a liar Amen the ladies were in in an adjoining room and they came in as we is about to pray I just want you to know the Holy Spirit came down and anointed us when we prayed and cursed that demon of cancer for his immune system to be anointed to seek out and to destroy this cancer I want you to notice how we prayed man and brother Donnie began to intercede in the spirit as tongues from the heavenly language began flowing from his mouth and we were charged by the Holy Ghost and we demanded that evil spirit to leave his body was a very powerful and anointed moment and as I concluded in prayer I looked up on the wall there and you know as I looked up on the wall there there was a in big letters over his office door in this room right here if you if you'd look it would been it would have would have been there right over his door is better wrote in big letters shalom and and as I looked at that I thought of this little sister Shalom from India who has contacted me for prayer and and and you know that we have written to and correspond it with and tried to you know encourage I began to pray for her and as I did I began to contemplate on that name Shalom and what it means peace peace and I began to speak peace and I began to speak her brother wrong over and over again peace peace it was very reminiscent when I was at youth camp look deep in the eyes of that demon-possessed boy and there that boy still walking in delivers today a man and I look down in his eyes and begin to speak peace to him a demon-possessed boy thereafter after a long time of of different ones praying with them and spoke peace to that and that enemy left that and all sitting that voice he just stopped and he said I look different look come over his face he says I'm free I'm free that spirit is gone and then I began to speak peace of her brother wrong and a spirit of oppression that has haunted him for weeks left him right there at that moment and peace came over him and we believe he is healed and man now that don't mean he won't have another battle but rather they healing is a process a man I preached for to his church on Saturday night who had believed our report because we've heard the doctors reports but who is believe God's report and I began to preach on what Jesus did at Calvary and in the scapegoat and and the redemption and the dual atonement for the healing for the body and salvation for the soul and Sunday night I spoke on our redemptive rights and then and then you know then that Saturday night after the meeting I found out I was ministering to Japanese and I didn't even know I was going to be ministering to Japanese little sister Angela senior doctor told us about a in a testimony the next day said of doctor you who is originally from Tokyo Japan he's been in the US for two five years he's an international correspondence affairs professor has several PhD titles and he and so he is alumni of Penn State in his top three classes and she was one you know had taken her Graduate Studies as he was one of the professors and as a philosopher he always shared you must have scientific evidence to prove anything and so um in a way they they had their in in your review and you know she she took the liberty then the classes are over so she said she shared that contradictory to many opinions that the supernatural occurred several times in history without scientific understanding and so she used several examples in the Bible like knowing the art regardless of scientific proof it rain 40 days and 40 nights God shut the door not Noah another example was was Joshua and the son standing still and and so he he asked a question well I went when scientific research says that there had to be movement how could this be and she said I don't know just God did it I just know it happened and so um she before she left she told him said I'm going down to Alton Virginia to we're special friends her church family would be and said I shared a youtube link and Express you should check that link because you'll be blessed and encouraged and so during the service she starts getting her phone starts vibrating and she's and I knew it it must be urgent as my family I knew I was at church so I checked her phone and ass it was this doctor you and he had decided to check out the YouTube length and there I was preaching about Joshua stopping the Sun and we don't have to know how God did it we just know he did it we don't have to figure out how he did it we just know that God stopped the Sun you say what was it the light that God stopped or how did it happen or why didn't the earth fall or did the earth the Sun don't move the earth is what moves I said don't make it like no difference how you figure it happened all we know is that light remained there until the enemy was conquered and so as I was preaching that this man came under conviction was overwhelmed by presence that came into the room and he immediately gave his heart to the Lord hey man he was just thankful that the Lord understood him as he had never prayed and she he asked what should I do next and she replied be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and so you know as you know I was supposed to be leaving to minister to Japan but God had other plans and sent me on a mission and while there God saved a Japanese professor this is an incredible miracle a man this is our God at work at the time we were praying right there within the same hours as we was praying for brother Ron brother Jason Jackson not knowing we were there not knowing we were having prayer for him knew nothing about our visit there or what we were or that we were praying at that time and the Lord speaks to him and he writes a note puts the date and the time and and and he the note says brother Ron fear not don't doubt I have not forgotten my promise to you if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before amen hallelujah I asked brother Ron how he was feeling this morning he said feeling awesome but he coughed gongs step one and a big one a moon preach tonight hey man hey man I just want to tell you a few of the some of the events as you know I had been praying to the Lord about earnestly for a visitation from him looking at these walls it was like I felt like like Joshua before Jericho you remember on the on the last Sunday of December and this this caused me to preach what I did you know of as I was with Moses so will I be with you and be strong and be very courageous remember that sermon title that I preached in the end it was because I was looking at some of these walls and some of these things and I'm praying to God Lord somehow you speak to me I don't care you know just just do it you said you but pour out your spirit on all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men will dream dreams young men will see vision and so you know I looking at that on that Sunday night after I'm ministered I have a very very vivid dream now you know God doesn't like I said give me visions I'd like I said I've had songs in the night out of out of heaven that woke me up during the night I've had audible voice of God speak to me a number of times when you know and here recently when you know when the doctor announced that that again that brother Kenneth was dying this has just been a little while ago just I'm here recently that is hearted failed and that open-heart surgery this is in November and that his heart had failed in open Serg it was his only chance or survival and so that we're contemplating to an open heart he was going in to see if they would do that and the doctors had turned him down and you know just said another heart attack you're gone you're history and they put in what 30 stents 29 30 yeah how many 32 stents enemies he's a record he's probably a bionic man and so anyway they've had that many stents as men his heart and and and I was praying on a Wednesday morning I got up and I said God we're out of showdown I said something's gonna happen I said you know Kenneth Asst he's reached a place medically they can do no nothing for him so we're at a showdown if you don't do something he's going to die so what are you gonna do about it and I was just talking to the Lord you know what are you gonna do about it and I had the voice of God came rushing back from the heavens and he said I've already done my part now what are you gonna do about it we had him come down that night we anointed with oil and rebuked that spirit he's still living today that was November now I know you know you can't be led by dreams and especially symbolic dreams you know Joseph the husband of Mary had a dream that didn't need interpreting because there was no prophet in the land then and I caution you against trying to follow every dream and you followed the word right a man and so we know Pharaoh had a symbolic dream that needed a prophet to interpret Daniel also did for Nebuchadnezzar for Pharaoh it was seven healthy fat cows that were eaten up by seven lean cows and and then seven years of corn fat and good eaten up by seventh in the ears and this meant that would be seven years of plentiful harvest eaten up by seven years of famine but it took a prophet to interpret that and we remember brother Branham had a friend his name was Bill Hall he was pastor of his church in Milltown Indiana and he came down with cancer it was liver cancer he was dying they asked brother Branham to come down and he advised him to go to the doctor said I don't have a word from the Lord but I got a good doctor friend and he called him up for him personally asked him to see this man and he said well I you know let me just look at the x-rays and he said there's nothing I can do since cancer of the liver send him over to Louisville's a certain doctor and that doctor looked at everything and sent him home to die and said you know here jaundice your you have had this now for five months and you're you're dying man you your preacher you must be ready to go and there's nothing can be done and some brother branham here gets the report even from the doctor is doctor friend said you know you're your friend is gonna cross over in four days and four days I don't give him for days and so he goes and tells the man's wife the man's you know brother halls going to die and and you know and the doctors have said for days and the Lord hasn't given me any words so you know we all got to go sometime and she started crying and and a few days later he was he was up early gonna go out hunting that morning and as he walked through the kitchen he looked and he saw on the wall a wormy green green wormy not eating knotty apple and and and he looked there and he said why would me to put that on the wall and and and then he realized he was seeing a vision and he quickly jerked his hat off and stood there and he saw five of them dropped down one after another and then he said and he saw a beautiful healthy-looking apple that came along Chomp Chomp Chomp and and ate him all up and he looked at that and said you know five months he's been sick his that's represented by the worm-eaten apples you know but God's God has shown me God's gonna heal him and God healed the man raised him up and so you know sometimes things happen in symbolic farming on Sunday night I saw um some young but mature buzzers this is very strange but I saw these young mature buzzards there I didn't count them but there was about twelve of them look like they just left the nest but hadn't learned to fly and there was a and and I was taking them and and moving them one by one into a pen of pigs and these pigs were just eating these buzzards up just you know as fast as I would put them in I could see the guts the gourds everything you know as they just shredded these buzzards apart and so you know I had been listening to the greatest battle ever fought and there was a statement brother branham made there that it stood out to me he said that there was a man that was that or a woman that was dying with with cancer or situation she's in a dying condition anyway she and the and the Lord appeared to her husband in a dream and he came back with the dream and he thought it was jokey and he cuz they come to find out it was the very answer to his wife's healing how the holy spirit did deal so Monday now I have a day of fellowship not preached all day long to brother on about the promises of healing and went over you know about you know our rights as a believer our legal rights are all of these things and just spent the day in the word with him on Tuesday morning we were to go to the hospital and to find out the news and the treatment plans and and then we were to fly out or at home um 2:40 in the afternoon and so that just I didn't know that he would be going for this appointment for it left but the Lord just arranged it so I could be there with him and in the middle of the night in the middle of the night I had an experience of waking up and I I heard the song being sung here I was singing it Bob but whatever it was me and sung as I as I came to and I heard it as as I was there awake we shall see miracles we shall see Giants fall we shall walk on water and so you know I got up that morning and was greeted by sister Connie as I poured the water into the coffee pot and I see asked how her night was and I and I said well ours was fine I said but if it's any consolation to you I woke up during the night he singing or here in the song I really I don't know if I was singing or whether I was hearing it's but it was saying we shall see miracles and she was she started crying she burst into tea and she said mother Tim we were up at 2:30 in the morning I was back in the bath room and this is on the back side of the house with several rooms between us no way that you could hear we had a fan going on in our room where you couldn't hear anything any noise that was going on we had a we had a fan for noise maker and and she says I was singing that Stas just started singing this song we shall see miracles real softly to myself we shall see Giants fall will walk on water and so he just confirmed it to her we started on the way the doctor to discuss his plan and I was riding along and all of a sudden a dream come back to me I'd told my wife about it the night before and I dreamed came back to me I've seen those buzzards and feeding those buzzers to pigs and all of a sudden it just came to me the brother branham told us and it's the first I think it's the first place in diseases and afflictions of first search on buzzards he said in a cancer in the natural and the spiritual he's a devil he types a scavenger and a buzzard he eats dead things so now I you know all of a sudden I knew this dream had some significance and brother Rocco brother honor said them buzzards there were cancers and I was feeding them to pigs and so you know then and then I was puzzled why of what the pigs meant so I was kind of silent for the next ride into into the doctors and then that sitting in the in the hospital and I was searching scan through nearly 200 quotes on pigs I couldn't find a clue in the sermons but well you know what but when the doctors was talking about treatments and use an immunotherapy I did a I did an internet search on cancer and immunotherapy and pigs and found that they developed this in a min of a therapy using small pigs like I saw in the dream in fact to the matter is I just read a document error a document on it said porcine cancer models the value of big cancer models of obviously depends on how faithfully they represent human disease porcine cancer biology is still a new field but indications are the pigs can correctly mimic human cancers and so you know they they were being fed to pigs and the pigs were gobbling them up and there was about 12 of them and I fed them one about a dozen but I was fed them to about a dozen pigs one by one just see him chopping them up now there's to be about 12 treatments and after them he will have a PET scan and I'm asking you to agree with me and believe with me for this PET scan it's going to come back off clear completely well i'ma know this is all biblical you know in the Bible legions of devils for cast out of a man and went into pigs and the pigs hadn't took them Devils to the sea and drown them a man and as far as a man he was restored his family healthy and well hey man so we got scriptural evidence amen amen now brother Branham said in the uncertain sound he's a now don't teach this but you know in the beginning when God made him he didn't make him to be doctored he had his own doctrine in him and remember I prayed that God would anoint his immune system and he was equipped he was a unit of his own here then healin does not come from any outside resource it comes from the inside now we can take the outside aids such as to kill germs or whatever it is in us or we can take our hands and cut on each other and make take a piece out or something like that an appendix or bad tooth or something take it out but healing does not come from anything you apply healing only comes by the power that's within yourself to build back to tissue that's been torn from the place has been taken out of there for healing is in you now I'm going to conclude as we come down here we were we were contacted again by this sister Angela because on that I believe it was on Tuesday morning that she received a phone call and she received a phone call from a an elite executive Sales Director who is Catholic by faith she doesn't participate in social media but she had a dream and she clearly said she clearly saw her in that dream so she knew she was connected somehow and this so moved on this woman said that she called her early in the morning said I saw you in a dream and then the dream that was a couple that was sitting on a sofa or couch in this answered the descriptions as she described it it matched sister Connie and brother Ron there was a gentleman that was speaking to him and he stated to them you did your part now we'll do mine and the dream faded and she began to hear a song and she woke up hearing this song did she never heard before and she's Catholic and she sees and she's a she religiously she's not super religious but she starts hearing this song and she starts humming the tune to sister Angela on the phone and said it was going like this way make a miracle-worker promise keep her mob dog hallelujah a man a woman who had never ever heard the song begins to hear it sung from another dimension a man now you say how can that be brother Tim well cuz He pours out his spirit on all flesh hey man so therefore as we're looking here you say well I just can't get it brother Tim it's a Catholic woman not super religious let me just say I don't care if God speaks through a donkey a man just I didn't speak however he wants to speak a man but I say at the same time let's get in the position where God can speak through us hey man hey man god bless you alright now I hadn't even started preaching yet hope you're not in too big a hurry thank you brother we're going to be speaking to this from this morning on the abstract title deed in this scene we see a book that is sealed with seven seals it is a book of a title but none can claim it it's a deed to a land but no man is worthy who can take it and so there's steps for the lamb who stands up to take the book and what it contains is the title to everything that Adam lost in the fall and and of course we know that originally that Adam on the earth he was a God of the earth and but he would forfeit that title deed to it to Satan and and of course as we know that he was like an amateur God over the earth the earth was his everything was given to his hand and through his fall Satan then would become the Prince of this world and he would also become the pen ^ atmospheres or prince of the power of the air and in the fall adam forfeited the title deed - that he would forfeit it over to Satan but Satan does not rightfully own the earth and he doesn't rightfully own you but he but of course he can possess it but it's only for a time and is only by permission and of course it's because that man is out of his rightful place and so he lost the title to it but Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back in the hands of Almighty God now title is the holy evidence that gives rise to a legal right of possession or control and in Eden none forfeited the title deed to the earth and to Satan and in order to do this and doing so he lost the title even to his own body and and his solver Satan would take a hold of his body his spirit and the soul of man and corrupt him and and man was robbed of his faith and now he would live by fear his body which was made to be in the image of God was was now by a false life by deceit he was robbed of his health and he was robbed of his eternal life and it became a slave and the property of Satan his body which never needed medicine never was sick never had a headache never stomach problem now became the target of demons and evil spirits could now take up residence in the body that once only housed the Son of God and the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit and now his body was to decay to turn gray and old and feeble until it's brought back to the dust of the earth we like to point into you to Genesis 3:17 re part of verse 17 Kirsten is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt I eat them in all the days of thy life verse 18 thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field now sadly not only would the land grow thorns and thistles but man's body was also made from the dust of the ground and that body would also grow thorns and thistles and Men tormentors that would come and torment his body evil spirits that could now attack in what had been once an immortal body now turned mortal and with that mortal it would become corrupted by by demon powers in spirits that would it would grow now thorns and thistles subject to disease and sickness and even death and of course the man's mind the human spirit became corrupted its memory which only remembered God's Word and contained God's promise now would become defiled his imagination from which man's comes man's creativity that ability to use imagination to develop to use I order to develop new and original ideas or things became evil its conscious now became aware of nakedness and shame and was stripped of its purity its affections and feelings and desires that were that had been settled things above now became said upon temporal and central things where that pass away and man's power of reasoning that power of logical thinking in order to draw conclusions and the once only contained God in his and reason to purity and holiness and it began to dwarf and shrivel and now man began to have thoughts that Satan interjected into his mind and God comes down looking for his son and finds him beaten and whipped and deformed and robbed of his inheritance but there was one thing that Satan could not put a claim on and that was that predestinated see gene of God that was resident within him inside of his soul so in spite of all the claims the devil had on him God has a claim on all of us as well and you see that that seed gene of God was clods those names that was in his book so the book of title deed was now in question after who owned it and Satan had a claim on him because Adam had subjected his self to it I'd to Satan on there and become subservient to him but yet God had a claim because he was the original owner and he had the first claim a man that the earth was originally his right and then you were originally his I like to tell the devil I've never originally belonged to you a man I wasn't yours to possess I belong to God before a world was ever began he chose me in him before the foundation of the world and Satan's dirty hands could not take this book so it went back in the hands of the original owner which is God before the fall man was a dual person he was connected to the earth because he had a physical body but he was connected to the heaven because he had a soul and so there when one with one round he he contacted and lived in heaven and he operated and he brought heaven Downs remains of the faith in the Word of God he would bring heaven down to the earth and he would control the natures of the animals and there was a millennium as a lion would lay down like the lamb and and would eat straw like the Bullock and there there was there the great powers laid within him as a said to move things on earth from Heaven's Dominion and and so but when this sin came in they became a great chasm between God and man and their fellowship but I want you to know that our God is a determined God and man he doesn't give up easily and he won't let the devil have the upper hand for long a man but you see if he has a son he then will redeem that son that son cannot be lost from him forever they don't get ought to give you some hope for your loved ones this morning they can't be lost from him forever a man so God was determined said I will not allow Satan to be victorious this is my son and I will redeem him and in the very moment Alice he is sent out of the garden and there they are oh you know whipped and defeated and the only way they can have a conference with God is for there to be a death a substitutionary death in their place and a lamb or some animal had to die and his skins now would be draped over them a bloody skin as they go out of the garden with her shoulders bent and weeping to one another has a walk out of the carton and garden watching the mouse he goes as they go it all formed down into one great thing God's great love began to move within him and he said but I won't let you go along I want you to get that point this morning I will not let you go alone but I'll go with you and I will be a seed in that that I come through the woman and I will redeem you from what the serpent has done and I'll bruise his head hey man I will bruise his head and he and he will bruise my heel word I walk upon the earth in my humanity so you Adam Adam you've been robbed and cast into Satan's prison house but you were born to be free and man you are now in bondage the Satan but I'll tell you what I'm not gonna allow this to happen I will provide an attorney for you a man son we're gonna have a day in court that's what you're seeing in Revelation 5 is a day in court a man there is a throne there is a king there is an intercessor a mediator an attorney and then there is a question document in question a man and then he says we're gonna have a day in court right now the ownership of the a man and earth is in question but the judge will hold the question title in escrow until it is determined before the judgment throne after who owns it now escrow is money or property or deed that's our bond is put into the property or the custody of a third party to go for delivery to a grantee only until after the fulfilment of the conditions specified and so in this case the title deed was put in the custody of the judge for delivery to a man who was worthy notice he would have to be a man who was worthy a man without sin am I now as God he had it but now it's got to be transferred back to a man again because it was not God who lost the title its man who lost the title and man then we gotta bring man back to the condition from where he fell from I'm man because when he fell all of the earth fell with him because he was the king of the earth animal life vegetation everything would fall with him and the only way to bring that back to a millennium again was restore man back to his original condition so the very purpose and plan of God is to take man who has fallen and put him back to the place before the fall are you with me amen brother buddy here he would show an Eden until I can come as a man and take that because I'm going to come a man there will be a man who will be a serpent brucer as I seed the seed and the woman will bruise his head there's going to be a seed that comes through the woman coming through the woman brings death through the woman brings life and through this woman now through through through Mary will come a son a man it will be the very body of Almighty God God would create himself a body a man now God as you see Jesus could not be his own father and man so he would have to be a body created formed of God but it mean that God couldn't be his own son Amen so God would create a body a son and this would be the title of his a son it's an offspring is a creation of God and God would come and take on flesh they meant to become the intercessor the attorney a man the Redeemer Alleluia a man so here as a down payment he said I'll tell you what we'll do and he took him through a lamb and he through a bloody skin to Adam and said come with this for this is a first step of redemption but this is going to be a process but I promise you I will redeem my son back to his original inheritance I've got some good news for you this morning we are not back over here in the beginning we're sin entered in and one man fell but we're right here in the hour of redemption where there is a people to walk for back a man from mortal battle mortality there they move from immortality to mortality but we're not there anymore we're right here at the end hallelujah we're at the very place where there is a people that is promised in the word to move from being mortal batei immortality these disputed title now remains in the hands of God until a worthy man takes the book but there isn't a man that is worthy all is all man is unworthy so we see the picture now now Jesus is not a lamb with seven horns and seven eyes that is symbolic of him he's not a woolly creature and man not me or else we would show you a picture of the lamb with 7-hour and seven eyes as they behold your God fall down and works and we're not either we're not idol worshippers this is symbolic a man of his redeeming work so that we wouldn't get confused because if we have seen if we'd to see one on the throne and another man over here we would have thought there were two gods but at the very one on the throne becomes a he creates himself a body and the father comes and dwells in the Sun for the purpose of redemption hallelujah not another God the same God moving right down to Eternity to take on amen your afflictions to go through your sorrows to feel how you feel do experience what you experience so he could be a proper mediator and prove himself worthy and without sin so he could take as a man take the book back for a man Oh hallelujah that makes me feel like speaking in tongues hallelujah just about lose words to express myself but now there's no man worthy so God steps out of eternity to become a man in order to take the book but once it's taken is still a book that is sealed and it cannot be open until the seals are removed and the removing of it seals the lots are the giving of it in the abstract because the seals represent something that's keeping the book closed to man and then heritance being able to be open to them are you with me so the removing of its seals are given an abstract of title that means it's there it requires a title search and so it will give an abstract of title which is a brief history of other transfers of a piece of land including all the claims that could be made against it so again you know there would be a search a title search and with this title search going back and and saying seeing as it moved down from this one to this one did this one to this one it would have to strike all the claims that were against it we'll all have to be struck off and paid for hey man hey if you're going to go sell a piece of property and there's a lien on it man you may own the deed to it and man but somebody else has got a claim on it and we've got promises laying right here in the word but there's a devil standing up there and saying but he can't take it he can't have it he's not worthy he can't have a rapture in this day their claims against him their claims against this church there's a claim against the bride and they've all got to be cancelled everything that's kept a rapture from taking place has got to be dealt with hallelujah I'm corrected they meant by the blood of the Lamb and shown that now the title is free and clear hallelujah so that's why we can see in Revelation 10 a transfer of the title when John could look at it John wasn't worthy John could not touch it John could not take it but now after the lamb pays the price and he cancels the death here's somebody with me did John his throat go and take the little book out of the hand of the angel now the book is yours oh I'll tell you that's why I believe we're living we're living in the day and the hour where the seals have been taken off the book and God is commanding the people now go take the little book out of the hand of the angel go and take your possession you've got an abstracted title it's not a closed book anymore it's an open book every claim against it is struck off now the book is the title the opening of the seals will give the abstract of titled showing that all the claims against it struck off so before the book of title can be opened by the lambs the seals have to be removed and so there had to be a title search so the lamb will work through his agent are you with me ma'am because he'll tear the seals off and hand it down to the seventh angel on earth where do you get that brother damn revelations in seven just put it up there for observation I found that in the days of voice of his sound in the midst of God to be finished and when the seals would be opened the thunders would be revealed the voiceless he kept giving us the revelation of the mysteries that were only in symbol form hallelujah exactly that could parallel the days of and you will you have written air and unknown town symbols many many tackle your Farsi but there comes a time where a prophet comes on the scene after everybody else is just about it the illusions our guest about it man I wrote books about it hallelujah but in this day God doesn't send another theologian but God sends a profit and that profit has the Word of God and he looks at the symbols and he says this is what they are Daniel would say many many technical arts and give the interpretation hallelujah and that's what God did for us in this day an hour and then there was a white horse and the rider we didn't know who it was and a red horse and we didn't know who it was black and we didn't know what it meant and a pale horse and souls under the altar and on and on and on and on you go and in days gone bad man gets about it but we're no longer guessing we have a vindicated word Bob vindicated prophet with a vindicated voice with a vindicated message hallelujah a man of God so the agent on earth starts all the way back in Ephesus and he does a title search all the way to Laodicea looking for all the claims of satan had against the church the first organization that rose the niccola and in spirit they're wrong and the Trinity of three God's Trinity is not even in the Bible amen a false baptism a Father Son and Holy Ghost that's a false baptism there's only one name given under heaven whereby men must be saved and man there's only one in his name is remission of sins if you want sins remitted it must be you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ nobody and all the Bible was ever baptized any other way until theologians come along and mess with the deed and put a claim against it but I want you in this knowing this day friends and we got a clear deed all the things down to the ages that man is tacked on and the Antichrist period of the white the red the black double the pale horse rider would put their seal and close the book now it is not a closed book anymore it is an open book and the land is yours not only have you got a deed now but you have an abstract shoe the need and you can read clearly in the word what is yours and possess it [Music] now the land is yours the Covenant is the deed to it but the enemy that possesses it in his claims against you must be struck off somebody with me now now this and we're just gonna just turn just a little bit here so catch me as we make this little Junction this is true of Israel now remember they are our type we are the Anna type we're not typing them they're typing us they were foreshadowing us so God would use Israel to show what he would do in his people there right and so the land is yours of course and the Covenant is is the deed to to it but the enemy possess it like Israel they were given a covenant they were given the rights they were given the title to the land on Mount Sinai cannot stop here just for a minute amen because really Mount Sinai was 50 days after the Passover it was the first Pentecost it is here that the Jews will tell you they they they say God made a covenant with Israel therefore he married her it was seven weeks after they had left the land a promise and after the Passover and then then they without this Jubilee which was a given of the rights the title to the land on Mount Sinai and there are seven nations I would like you to look here Deuteronomy 7 1 and when the Lord our good that God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it and it's cast out many nation before thee the Hittites the girgashites the amorite the Canaanites the parasites the hive eyes and the jebusites seven nations greater and mightier than thou so I want you to notice now the land is possessed by seven nations hours the history of the title has come through seven churches each one of them with the claim on the land all of these nations were claiming the lands we have been there longer than you we are the first church our our Pope was the first pope Peter on and on and on they have their claims that goes up many many years seven Church ages and they have had claims on the land and they are their own

come on there should be time no more there that there will be no more delay of the promises being fulfilled aren't you glad to be living in the day where he's not delaying it any longer but he said there will be no more delay I'm gonna finish the work that I start when I started back over here need and I'm going to finish it right up here right at the end of that's Laodicean age if somebody with me hey man why because are you going to keep the earth give me revelation ten six I just want to go back over this again because this this is his last ode to his bride he swears by him that liveth for ever and ever he swears by himself who created heaven and the things that therein are the earth and the things that there are you there therein are and if C and the things which which are there Ian that there should be time no longer and what are you saying is don't throw your wristwatch away don't take the the the clock off the wall no don't take your calendar down that's not what he said he is saying I don't no longer hold back the fulfillment of this word the angel listened the iniquity them rights are for the cup of iniquity is running over this is what God was dispossessed them he would give them even opportunity in the times of Abraham to repent they can see the righteousness of God but then continue right on their evil ways amen until the cup of the iniquity of the hem rights were full and we're here in the day an hour where sin has heaped up to its height and the cup of iniquity is now full imagine and that time God says okay it is not full it is now my time to pour out the judgments and I'm going to start pouring it out by bringing a people into the laughs and dispossessed who is still never promised down to the agents and tried to keep God's people off of it I'm gonna dispossessed them so that every promise in this world is gonna be yours hallelujah and why is it because the Lord loves you and because he would keep the oath that he is sworn unto your father's at the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondsmen from the hand of Pharaoh because He loves you because he chose you before the foundation of the world I love it he didn't choose you cuz he weren't perfect he tells you to be perfect hallelujah this was his choice Amen you were perfect but he chose you to be perfect amen did you know when God God chooses something he can never change his mind about so if he's chosen you he can never change his mind about you he can never discharge unto you he can never do that he can't go back on his word he can't change his mind about his word so therefore even in your failure when because you are chosen somebody with me and even in your failure he won't leave you in the failure he wouldn't begin to work on you by the power of His Holy Spirit till he purges that see out of your life and raises you up and cause you to walk in this promise I know ye therefore that the LORD thy God he is God and the faithful God this is what he said to the Laodicean age he said under faithful God I'm the faithful and true witness that right which keepeth covenant I keep my covenant even when you fail to keep your part of the bargain I keep a man and mercy with him that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations hallelujah and so in the end verse 12 the LORD thy God shall keep it unto thee the

oil and the increase of the kindness cattle and the and the flocks of thy sheep and the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give them thou shalt be blessed of all people and there shall not be a
