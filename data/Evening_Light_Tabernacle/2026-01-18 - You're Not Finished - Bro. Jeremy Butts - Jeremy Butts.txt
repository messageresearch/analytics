TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And when I feel like I can't make it. When my world's falling apart, when I feel forgotten alone with a broken heart. When I question every promise and doubted every prayer, it's in the silence. Somehow I know you're there. I almost let go. Then you told me the truth that you're not finished. That you're not done. You made me a promise that I would overcome. You speak to my valley. They answer to you and every mountain in my ways you move. Cuz you're nothing finished. You're nothing. And even in my weakness, you still have a plan. When I'm in the darkness, you reveal your hand. than what was meant for evil. You turn it for my good. You give beautiful ashes just like you said you would. When I want to let go, I remember your true not finished, that you're not done. You made me a promise that I would overcome. You speak to my valley. They answer you and every mountain in my way. You said you move cuz you're not finished. And you're not witness. You're with me in the shadows through every fear I battle. You never turn away. You never stop calling my name. Breathe on what's been broken. Restore what was stolen. Speak to my storm and your voice. It calls the crashing away cuz you're not finished and you're not done. You made me a promise that I would overcome. You speak to my valleys. They answered you in every mountain in my way. You said you move. Cuz you're not finished. Cuz you're not done. You made me a promise that I would overcome. You speak to my valley. answer to you and every mountain in my way say you're not finished. You're not finished.
