TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] [music] And when I feel like I can't make it. When my world's falling apart, [music] when I feel forgotten alone with a broken heart. When I question every promise [music] and doubted every prayer, it's in the silence. Somehow I know you're there. I [music and singing] almost let go. Then you told me the truth that you're not finished. That you're not done. You made me a promise that I would overcome. [music and singing] You speak to my valley. [singing and music] They answer to you and every mountain in [singing] my ways you move. Cuz you're [music] nothing [singing] finished. You're nothing. And even in my weakness, [music and singing] you still have a plan. [music] When I'm in the darkness, [singing] you reveal your hand. than what was meant for evil. [singing] You turn it for my good. You give beautiful [music] ashes just like you [singing] said you would. When I [music and singing] want to let go, I remember your true not [music and singing] finished, that you're not done. You made [music and singing] me a promise that I would overcome. You speak to [music] my valley. They answer you and every mountain in [music] my way. You said you move cuz you're not finished. [music] [singing] And you're not witness. [music] You're with me in the [singing] shadows through every fear [music] I battle. You never turn away. You never stop calling my name. Breathe on what's been broken. Restore what was stolen. Speak to my storm and your voice. [singing] It calls the crashing away [music] cuz you're not finished and [music] you're not [singing] done. You made me a promise that I would overcome. [singing] You speak to my valleys. They answered [singing] you in every mountain in my way. You said you move. Cuz [music] you're not finished. Cuz you're not done. [singing] You made me a promise that I would overcome. [music and singing] You speak to my valley. answer to [singing] you [music] and every mountain in my way say [music] you're not finished. You're not finished. [music] [applause]
