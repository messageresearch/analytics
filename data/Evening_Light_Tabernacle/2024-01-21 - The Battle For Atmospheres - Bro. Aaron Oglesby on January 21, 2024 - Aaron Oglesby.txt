but we just ask Lord right now as brother Tim ministers in Virginia Lord that you would just surround Him Father Lord that you would just give him direction as he preaches father Lord that the very words that you'd want spoken would just come from his mouth Lord God lord we're just lifting up brother Ron Lord all the different others in their congregation with needs that they mention this morning Father Lord you're more than enough God we just seek your will Lord God I ask that you would just move in a supernatural way among among among all of those people Lord and we're so thankful father that you can be there and you won't leave us out here God but we're just looking to you this morning Father Lord we're just lifting each need that was mentioned Lord and we just ask that you would meet each one father Lord there's special times that you do special things father we ask that today would be one of those days Lord Lord that the angels of God would just sweep through the building Lord and meet the needs of the people father Lord if there's a sinner in our m or a backslider lord I ask that while the word would go forth conviction would strike father and it would be like that story of the man who was testing the sound and he said repent or perish and that man fell and repented father we asked that there just be such a supernatural presence in this building Lord Lord that nobody would leave worse than they came in Lord but you would just be found to be the Conqueror in our midst father we're just looking to you father Lord you are able father and here we are willing Lord to just Lord just come and worship you with all of our heart Lord we just want to lay everything aside everything father that would hinder God anything that we've done said thoughts that we've had through the week that weren't pleasing to you Lord we just ask father your forgiveness Lord we come to you Lord and we just ask that in Purity Lord we just come father and you would just accept our worship Lord we invite you father we welcome your presence father Lord we're just expecting you Lord we know you're here father because we're here and you came with us father but we ask that you would just make yourself Manifest this morning Lord that you would just anoint brother Aaron father that you would use him Lord as never before Lord those that are on the stream father ask that you minister to them too Lord God as I was reading about the life of Elijah this week and there was that woman who had a need and you said I have commanded her to sustain you and he had a long journey to get to that woman about 80 miles he had to travel through the hills and the mountains and he finally got to her when she had her last me the whole time Lord you cared the whole time as he journeyed father and she counted down the meals to her last meal father you cared you knew father there was a predestined moment when your Prophet would show up father and today is a predestined moment when your minister would come and just preach what's on his heart father without fear we love you father ask that you just be in the whole service father those on the stream Lord like that widow woman who couldn't come to the prophet Lord I ask that you would just minister to them today Father those that would watch the archive minister to them Lord God we just love you Lord we give the service to you each part Lord ask father that each song Lord wouldn't just be sung out a ritual father but your spirit would be behind it father Lord that you would come in the music you'd come in the worship father each one would do their part we give it to you Lord God may this not be a normal service father but may it be a supernatural moment Lord that's what we expect in Jesus Christ's name bless the offering take these and lift them up for I have not the strength to praise you much as you are worthy to be praised oh Lord I am oh Lord take my voice this morning Lord and take my voice

she'd come up and make ready for her special Wednesday morning not knowing that any of these events were coming getting ready to take place L Ron said that he dreamed this morning this Wednesday morning said Andrew and myself was speaking in a beautiful gymnasium he said we were standing besides one another and our our people was sitting in the in bleacher seats and the floor was as it is now in our church the place was at capacity and he said I was speaking with like a mask on and Drew was wearing a hat like a statement hat he said we was going full blast I was brought a note and I went to to an office to read the note he said I removed my mask and coming out to speak with Drew a moment and he removed his hat and the announcement was made the curse is over and the place erupted he said I don't know what it all means but it was some feeling he shared it with brother Tim puit and brother Tim sent the interpretation to the dream The Mask represents your sickness the Hat represents Andrew's Declaration of Faith the no is a word from God the mask removed means the sickness is over the Hat removed means faith has achieved its Victory the announcement is the curse and its trial is over the place erupting is the shouts of Victory heard around the world I was driving on Thursday morning and i' taking the kids to school that morning and I was just praying as I was traveling back and I I was driving and I begin to think begin to think about this dream that brother Ron had and how the spirit of the Lord had came down and dealt with him and and I was begin to think about this dream and I'd really begin to pray about it and the Lord dealt with me just sweeped into the car and I could just hear him say say these words write sister Courtney Dexter and ask her if she could write a song to this dream you know if you would come to me and say brother Andrew dream me a dream you know I couldn't do that or if you would come to me and say brother brother Andrew preached me a sermon unless the gift begins to activate it it just doesn't work that way so I knew that when I had felt led to write sister Courtney to put a song to this dream I knew that the Lord was in it and literally within moments of texting Brother David Dexter and writing sister Courtney literally in moments she had put the things with you brother Ron had a dream on Wednesday [Music] morning [Music] I

that can dance for joy it ought to be the Bride of Jesus Christ who can Rejoice for joy in the face of of bad news in in the face of a bad doctor's report in the face of an evil world around us we still got joy we still got Victory and we still got peace it's the atmosphere that the bride lives in it's an atmosphere of Victory it's an atmosphere of Peace Hallelujah isn't it good to be in the house of God this morning amen you know I know they talked about it already but you know yesterday brother Matthew Spencer called me and tell me the the newest report on brother Ron and you know it's incredible I I was talking to him about and I said I said y'all don't understand what a testimony y'all are you you don't you don't understand that you bad report after bad report after bad report and you see yes brother Ron but an entire family with their shoulder squared back saying I've got victory over the enemy and the world can do me no harm you know he said the doctor said that he's got cancer in both eyes and they believe that it's come from the brain PR wow and he says Isaiah 53 says God is my healer and I believe that we ought to be able to stand with him today you know I know you've prayed for him for 4 years and look here we are four years later the prayers have worked don't back off now I'm going to ask you the same thing that that brother Andrew asked his church consecrate yourselves yes and pray for him more fervently than you've ever prayed before because the devil just threw everything he had at him but when the enemy comes in like a flood I believe I believe that the word is true that he's going to raise up a standard of healing no harm no no harm can we pray this morning Heavenly Father what an atmosphere Lord Lord an atmosphere of faith and an atmosphere of believing an atmosphere Lord where all things are possible Lord I pray this morning that you'll move me aside Lord Lord completely and may you just speak Lord maybe it seems off of what I studied maybe I don't even understand where I'm going Lord but will you speak this morning Lord take control Lord in this atmosphere I know Lord God lord I know you want to speak and you want to move Lord right now we remember brother Ron Lord Lord in such a in such a battle and yet Lord what a soldier he's been Lord as they've stood there in faith as he's ministered the gospel Time After Time After Time I can declare unhesitatingly that you've used him like never before Lord and I see a man that has trusted you with his life and now I pray Lord that you give it to him Satan we come before for you as the Bride of Jesus Christ and we command you to take your hands off of God's Property not only off of brother Ron but AC of the Bride around this world the ones that you've Afflicted and that are struggling there's many even here in our own assembly our dear sister jeie battling cancer many other problems and sicknesses but it's time that you let go it's time that the house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus and we stand and speak this morning because we believe Lord and we believe that you would never fail and that your will is to heal and so we place it in your hands now father and we believe you Lord have your way now in this service we thank you that you're here Lord we always know you're here but we thank you and when it's special and we can feel you move in the building Lord speak to every heart now I pray in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles with you I'd like to ask you to turn with me to the book of gen Genesis the first chapter and we'll read the very first three verses before we turn over to Ephesians the second chapter amen ain't God good amen he sure is it's it's wonderful when when God's people come together and and begin to worship him and to feel him move into the place like he has this morning Hallelujah and it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light if you'll turn also with me to Ephesians the 2 chapter and we'll read the first seven verses there as well it says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us you know right here in this verse it's almost a parallel to verse two in Genesis you had a chaotic Earth there was chaos but God moved and then he describes our lives and we were in sin and we were in darkness and we were in shambles but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through qu Christ amen I pray the Lord will add His blessings to the word as you take your seats this morning what we see right here in verse two is it tells us that Satan is the prince of the power of the air in other words he rules in high places in Heavenly places and the reason he was there is because man fail and we'll get more into that later and we fail from our position it allowed Satan to move into that position and began to rule from there and therefore we no longer could attain Heavenly places so it places him there and it shows that he is there but then it comes right on down and and in verse six it says but he's raised us up together so now we've been raised up again to make us sit together where in Heavenly places so it shows our restoration right here but notice it doesn't show Satan cast down at this point so it's still a contested place even though we have a right to to go there and battle for it he's still there accusing you and telling you you don't have a right to be here we're going to get into that more as we go because we live in a time where the atmosphere all around us is very unsettled it's a very unsettled times and many times I I don't think we we appreciate the significance um and the role that atmosphere plays in our lives it it's a uh we don't recognize its importance in a good marriage uh it's importance in a good home it's importance in church and the services that that we have it's something that we should work to foster a positive atmosphere an atmosphere of Faith an atmosphere of believing an atmosphere of uplifting atmosphere is very important and it should be fostered and it should be centered on the word of God in all aspects of our life and and many times we don't we don't recognize this but it's the truth and brother brandham we'll see quotes that back this up often times what we receive or don't receive what we receive or don't receive is a direct result of the atmosphere that we operate in you'll find that positive people tend to have more positive things happen to them or at least they recognize the positive in the things that happen to them when man lives in a NE in a negative atmosphere and he's constantly living in the negative he will produce negative results it's just the way it is it's a self-fulfilling prophecy really is is what it is and you get those people that that have that eore woe as me atmosphere and that's exactly what you're going to produce in your life and the same thing goes for church if if you come to the house of God with well I guess we'll see well I guess how we'll see how this service going to go oh they're talking about blessings again but my life's in shambles oh here they go talking about the moving of the spirit again so people can run and shout and oh here they go he's got victory over the enemy well then that's what you're going to get out of every single service you're going to walk in defeated unless you change the atmosphere in which you operate you're going to walk out defeated but what I'm telling you is this morning you don't have to live in that atmosphere you have been called to be the creator of atmospheres you get to choose the atmosphere in which you live in and I say in a day which the word has been restored which the seals have been opened which God has come back once again to fellowship with God between God and man we should be living in the most happy most positive most overcoming atmosphere of anybody that's ever lived on the face of the Earth we know we're standing on the edge of a Rapture how much happier how much more positive how much more excited could we be and yet we get a lot of this we get a lot of negative ativity you come with that atmosphere and it not only affects you in a church service but in reality it hinders the entire atmosphere and it'll keep it from reaching the levels that that moment could have reached oh but brother Aaron it was a great service it sure was what could it have been where could we have gone What miracles could have taken place well we're not looking for that every C speak for yourself I am I'm looking for the exceeding abundantly every time we come together I'm not sure why you showed up this morning I didn't wake up to waste time I didn't come together to see all your smiling faces even though I do love you y'all are wonderful people but I came to see him move and when he moves there's the miraculous the sick are healed the Lost are saved the the the Justified get Sanctified and the Sanctified get filled with the Holy Ghost I want to see it every time we come together so let's come in a positive attitude lay aside your mully grubs lay aside how you've been hurt here and hurt there and let's press the battle let's press into the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost where all things are possible when we speak of atmosphere and it being unsettled it's true that the world is in an uproar over the atmosphere right now as it relates to the climate they're in up in an U War over that and as it relates to the weather and surely we we know we know that Satan can get in that and stir that up absolutely he can but but the unsettled atmosphere that I'm really speaking of would be the surrounding influences in the spir uh in the spiritual and the political environment in which we live in today the time we live in has been placed in the scripture by a prophet in this day as the leot toan age it is the last age and therefore it is what is commonly known even amongst many nominal churches that this is known as the end time but we don't guess about that we know this is the end time and now it's not unique in one sense that there have been other end times before there was an end time in Noah's day there was an end time in the days of of Sodom uh the Bible will even hearken to those days as representation of how things will be in this day because those were end times there was an end in Jesus's day as it was the end of the Jewish dis dispensation however we say all these things and they do relate to today but I want to emphasize this is not anend time this is the end time this is the wrapping up of all things th th th this is this is the winding up of time this is where the whole thing that God ever planned even from back before we were in in in existence here upon the Earth back in the back part of his mind this is where all of that wraps up in a Rapture and then and then from there here upon the Earth there's a tribulation and and then there there's a wedding supper and there's a millennium and then there is eternity this is is the end time and we can find similarities in the other end times that relate to this time but when it comes down to the fact that we stand on the edge of the Rapture of the church and and when we stand at the edge of the change of our bodies we can boldly say there has never been a day like this day there has never been a time like this time and yet the atmosphere around us is troubled and it's stirred up just as the Bible said it would be I've said this before and I'll say it again the end time condition should not trouble a Believer it should not bother a Believer it should not upset a Believer it should be a confirmation that everything you've ever believed and ever been taught is absolutely the truth it would trouble me if all of a sudden everything was really good and really smooth and perfect and it went on that way and I looked look around and go wait where are we where are we at in time I I don't understand this but because the scriptures tell us that this is how it's going to be then I can look around and go perfect I'm standing right where the prophet of God told me I was to be standing things are exactly how the word said it was going to be this doesn't trouble me this anchors me ever more so to know that when you see these things going on around you look up Redemption draweth nigh listen we don't got to wait ages and ages for the return of the lord The Return of the Lord is happening now we are in the midst of the Rapture of the church it is a process there's a shout and it has gone forth and now the church is being prepared to go up into a Rapture second Timothy 3:1 lays out the characteristic of the last days and and I just have a few of them here and a couple of them I even paraphrase but it says it'll be perilous that means dangerous check says men will be lovers of themselves that means they will be selfish yes are here we are they will be blasphemers Unholy no natural affection false accusers Fierce that means they will be savage or Untamed like Beast despisers of those who are good lovers of pleasure 1 Timothy 4:1 says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron now I looked at that and I just thought just I thought about America in general not necessarily what we call the the message but just Christianity as a whole and I got to looking at at some numbers and it says about 64% of Americans call themselves Christians today says that might sound like a lot but 50 years ago that number was 90% many have departed from the faith and have had their conscience seared with a hot iron and it says and I don't I don't have it right here but it says if this rate continues by the year 2070 Christianity would be extinct in America am listen that number ain't going up that number ain't stabilizing churches are closing their doors day after day after day after day because there aren't enough people to even come and sit in the pews to even keep the lights on they are departing from the faith and yet in the midst of all that there's actually been a people that's been turned back to the faith to the faith of the fathers and While others are going down just like it was seen in a vision there is a people getting stronger and stronger and stronger and growing and growing and growing listen this trial can come this tribulation could come did it make your faith waver no absolutely not it just shook the dirt enough to let my roots go deeper and deeper and deeper listen Satan is barking up the wrong tree if he thinks this bride is about to quit if he thinks we're about to back off preaching Divine Healing if he thinks we're about to give up on our prodical out there in the world we're not giving up we're on the verge of the greatest most miraculous events in history I'm standing firm and I'm saying come Lord Jesus come I listened to brother Donnie last night talk about his precious daughter Erica and he said I believe more now than I ever have come am he said I'm going to pray for the sick now more than I ever have I'm going to have prayer lines more now than I ever have listen hard blows from the devil don't make a real believer quit it makes me recognize I got to buckle up I got to Annie up and I got to come back to the middle listen Bell's ringing it's time for the next round I can sit there in the ring and throw in the towel and say I quit and go down with the rest of them or I can rise up in faith and say yet he slay me yet I'll serve him he's a good god he's a mighty God he is an overcomer he is a conqueror and his children are the same thing I'm not quitting I'm not backing up I ain't going away we're not leaving until we leave here we're here to stay devil we're here to stay and we're operating in an atmosphere of Faith Matthew 24 tells us that Nations shall rise against Nation in Kingdom against Kingdom the accuracy of these scriptures and how it describes the current state of the world is actually astounding I mean it's not like well I can kind of see that oh it's pinpoint yes it's pinpoint this is the end time and the atmosphere is tore up and whipped up by Devils atmosphere of Oppression is what people live in every single day it's an atmosphere of attacking where people look for any reason to attack their fellow man atmosphere of hatred atmosphere of nervousness everybody's on edge amen it's an atmosphere of fear and anxiety and there is no peace to be had y I was thinking about this just the other day we had a situation where one of our cars broke down and I had to call a tow truck and the guy came and picked it up and towed it and dropped it off and I was just standing there talking the guy he seemed friendly enough and I said man I bet you know being in this job sometimes you get putting some dangerous situations huh he said oh every single day he said but I ain't worried about it he said somebody go ahead and shoot me just put me out of my misery like man that that turned so quick I was just trying to talk to the guy and he he's hoping I'd shoot him but I I left there and it actually was heavy on me for a minute and I said that's how people are walking around in misery right there's no peace to be had because the world that we live in is not conduced Ive to peace the atmosphere all around us is unsuitable for peace and the reason that is is because the one who has dominion over this atmosphere the one who has dominion over this Earth because we fail the one who has dominion over all the kingdoms of the earth is a liar and a murderer and the father of it you can't have peace when the atmosphere is ruled by a liar and a murderer brother brandham said here in Victory Day He said Jesus said in St Matthew 24 said you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars and wars and War why because the prince of the earth Satan the power of the Nations there's a national Spirit here a national Spirit here it's Devils they can't get along with one another see now stop for just a minute before we read too deep into that just CU you can't get along with somebody don't mean it's cuz they're Devils that's good but what brother Bram says here is he says that is why there's wars and rumors of wars because the Devils that run the atmosphere of those Nations cannot get along with one another and so what I'm speaking on to you today is the battle for atmospheres the battle for ATM atmospheres so notice the current atmosphere we live in is controlled by the Devil by Satan himself the prince of the power of the air now when we say that like I already said when it said the prince of the power of the air many times we just take that and think we mean the weather well tornadoes came he's the prince of the power of the air that's true that's not a wrong application but it's also speaking about the atmosphere in which the world lives under and operates in because many times brother Brandon would take and tie that that scripture about the prince of the power of the heir multiple times right into the temptation of Jesus when he offers them all the kingdoms of the world he would say something like this this is in the message Elijah the Bible said so Satan is the prince of the power of the air and every nation is under his Dominion the scripture says that s he says Satan quoted it to Jesus said the whole world all these kingdoms of mine and I will do with them what I will so when we see the scriptures that we've read about the end time and how pinpoint it is and like I said it's something that we recognize has to be fulfilled that has to be fulfilled the end time must be evil the atmosphere must be that Disturbed that tore up that it seems like we're on the edge of of of Civil War in our country all the time it seems like we're on the edge of World War III all the time the atmosphere is troubled and that's exactly how it had to be these things must come to pass and as Bleak as that sounds I'm not trying to paint a bleak picture to you as Bleak as it sounds it shouldn't Shake us even one little bit because they aren't the events that the bride is supposed to be focused on when it comes to end time scriptures there are other end time scriptures that we find our identification in I look right here at an end time scripture in Acts 2 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams identify with that scripture well the world Fallen apart yeah well the Lord is pouring out his Spirit upon All Flesh well this is going on over here and Russia is doing that well there's visioning happening there's prophecies going forth and the spirit of the Lord is being manifested amongst his people I find my identification there first Thessalonians 4:17 well there's going to be bombs and there's going to be this okay that's fine but I find my identification where it says then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord we should be focused on the the fact that the atmosphere is charged with the coming of the lord it's right here upon us we're in the very moments of his appearing the coming of the Lord Jesus is at hand church he promised as Malachi 4 he did it he promised restoration he did it he promised to pour out his spirit and he's doing it he promised us heal in he's doing it he promised a Salvation for us in our Offspring and he's doing it he promised to come back and take away a bride and he's going to do it all these promises are the truth brother brandham spoke about the about the atmosphere there in Jerusalem and that atmosphere was just as stirred up at the time of Jesus as our atmosphere is it was just as stirred up and he it was an end time and and the politics were awful and there was Roman oppression and the Pharisees and the Sadducees were fighting amongst themselves and zealots were riding in the streets and fighting against the Romans the atmosphere was awful in Jerusalem it was an awful time and an awful place but to those that held on to the words of Jesus to those that knew he said he was coming to the Passover feast they were gathered in Little Homes and looking out their Windows anxiously and and and they had their Palm leaves ready and the atmosphere was charged with his appearing to those expecting him the atmosphere was charged with his coming how charged should we be what kind of anticipation should we be living under where should our thinking be on it how excited should we be to serve the Lord to have an opportunity an opportunity to be the ones who are alive and remain what a privilege to have received the message from the seventh Church age messenger the one who came to tie it all up how excited we should be to serve the Lord and if you're not it's because you're not expecting his appearing you're not expecting his coming brother brandham says the Christian knows it's the coming of the Lord see there's an atmosphere it depends on what you're looking at that's right there was a prophecy went forth last night over the pull pit there at Full Gospel Lighthouse as brother Andrew began to speak and I don't have the whole thing you can go listen to it at the end of the service and it came forth very powerfully I am the Lord God Almighty and he speaks about being I am Alpha and Omega and one thing I led that he said was I formed you before the foundation of the world and no one can erase you he said no one can erase you but it came right down it said at the end do not Slumber the Rapture is upon the church do not Slumber I don't know maybe this is a silly analogy but how many of you maybe children would understand how it feels maybe um maybe the day before Christmas or maybe how you feel when you fix and get to go on some big exciting trip and and you know you got to get up at 5: in the morning to catch a plane and you lay down but do you sleep well now you can't Slumber because you are excited hallu how can you Slumber how can you Slumber how can you slip into an atmosphere of negativity how can you slip into an atmosphere of the Lord at the late is coming how can you slip into an atmosphere of God don't move like that anymore how can you slip in that kind of atmosphere if you're excited and you know he's coming he's coming he's right here at the door oh Ju Just in the morning we may get up and go just in the morning tomorrow morning may be the time how can you Slumber and it shows your condition if you're able to Slumber if you're able to be lukewarm if you're able to be nonchalant about it you're not excited about it because you're not expecting him to really return or if you are you're not expecting it in the morning maybe some far off y under maybe years down the road maybe so but you don't know when he's coming for you so live excited live ready serve the Lord with purpose do not Slumber the coming of the lord The Rapture is upon the church do not Slumber brother BR says there's an atmosphere it depends on what you're looking at for our Lord has strictly told us what was going to happen at that time and we don't know the minute or hour but know that we're nearing something now you can feel it in the atmosphere church it's been dark a long time but day is about to break you can feel it in the atmosphere you can feel it charge through a place like it did this morning when the Lord comes down in a mighty way and there's just something different you just feel it pulsating something's about to happen something's about to take place you forgive us if we get a little bit excited because our Lord's coming forgive us if we get a little bit excited cuz we hear the the wagon wheels coming I was a nobody I was a little wash girl I didn't deserve anything I was lost and Bound for hell but he said I'm coming back for you others didn't believe it others said you're unworthy others said you sin too much others said you was an alcoholic others said you was a drugie others said you did too many things there's no way he'd ever want you but I hear the wagon wheels coming I hear it coming forgive me if I get excited I've been forgiven so much I've been forgiven so much it excites me that he's coming back for me I can't Slumber now I can't Slumber now he's coming back for me day is about to break and yet all that being said it is a constant War to live in and operate in the right atmosphere it is a constant fight because we are affected by the atmosphere that surrounds us at all times doesn't mean we give into it doesn't mean we cave into it but the Bible would describe it as a smoke and you know how it is you don't got to be just walk through it you walk through this atmosphere every day walk through smoke for a little bit it affects your clothes it gets on you that's why we come time after time to be washed Washed by the Water of the word I'm not saying you fell in sin saying junk gets on you and you want to be washed from it and cleans it and we get affected by it and you can have a bad day because of the atmosphere around you look I'm realistic we're human you go to work and your boss treats you like dirt and yells at you and blames you for stuff and does this and I don't expect you to come home be like woo hallelujah what a wonderful day it was awesome I hope I can do that again tomorrow that's that's not what I'm saying I understand that it affects us and so it is a battle to keep the right attitude towards Promises to Keep the right attitude towards people yeah people we have to operate from the same place of Grace and forgiveness that Jesus operated towards us when it comes to people regardless of their intent purpose not on purpose meant to hurt didn't mean to hurt lay all that aside because the atmosphere that we live in is to assign blame whose fault is it well who what but Jesus doesn't lay blame he offers forgiveness and Grace and if you'll operate in the place that without giving forgiveness you can't have forgiveness without offering Grace you can't have Grace then it'll change your perspective on a lot of things sitting there being nailed to the cross he said father forgive them they know not what they do now that being said I've had people say well I mean well yeah that was Jesus of course of course he could okay let's point to just a regular man filled with the Holy Ghost Steven being stoned and he says the exact same thing Lord don't lay this to their charge Lord don't hold this against them Stone Lord forgive that man Lord I hope he knows you easy to do no hardest thing ever but you got to operate from that place where else you'll find yourself with Grudge after Grudge after Grudge and hurt after hurt after hurt and funny feeling after funny feeling and I can't fellowship with this one I don't want to sit by that one and then this one gets up to saying but I can't even be blessed by because I don't like this and she said that and what about this one here and look at him preaching I probably at some point in my life said something smart elic to you I'm sorry Lord I believe it's very important to be self-aware and understand your own shortcomings and your own faults because when you can't recognize yours you don't have Grace for others hey you don't even know me and this guy's buddies was that always the case no sir you got have Grace for people let God in a relationship he'll mold it up and fix it up and make it right but the problem is we're judging them through our own self-righteousness and how we think they should have and they shouldn't and they shouldn't and if you'll combine your list of Shas with their list yours probably longer than theirs I don't even know how we got there but there we are and we're going to move on now we got to operate from a place of Grace Place of forgiveness to where you can truly look at somebody and say I love you not say it because the Bible says you got to say it because if you forgiven you can do it easily amen atmospheres affect us and we have to battle to stay in the right atmosphere with the right attitude towards church towards promises towards people because like I said atmospheres affect people you have to be willing to war listen just because we have the ability to have the right atmosphere doesn't mean it always happens let's be real you come into church many times we talk about it in the back you talk about it sometimes it's just there man the atmosphere just first song first prayer it's charged and and you don't have to work at it it's just there and then there's times that we come in and it's not but our attitude isn't to be well everything's just off tonight oh another song I Don't Like what's wrong with the music tonight something just a little off timing seem sometimes you have to work at it sometimes you have to fight for it how bad do I want the Lord to move in this service today how bad do I need him in my home how bad do I need him to move on my behalf you know what things the atmosphere just ain't cracking and popping like it is sometimes I'm going to create one right here I'm going to create an atmosphere of worship right here and I'm I'm Let It Bleed over to this one and bleed over to this one and it never it may never start cracking and popping all over the place but it can be cracking and popping right where you're sitting as you invite the Holy Spirit to come and deal with me accept my worship accept my praise accept my offering we're going to have church right here tonight if you want to join me that's fine but right here I'm going to create an atmosphere I'm going to fight for [Applause] it you got to be with to war against the atmospheres and and fight to create the right ones the atmosphere in Jerusalem that we just described in many ways was just like the one we're in turmoil and struggle the people felt forgotten and the people felt Forsaken and there was a priest there by the name of Zacharias and the scripture says in Luke 1 and6 that he was righteous before God amen don't get it in your mind that Zachariah was lukewarm him and his wife were both righteous before God walking in all there wasn't one he messed up all it didn't say he kept most of the Commandments all go to the next verse no act to no there it is at the end go back to six ordinance of the Lord this is the word I want you to look at blame L I know some of you think you could but I don't believe there's anybody here that I could stick that tag on this morning blameless but the scripture attaches it to him blameless but even the most Ardent Christians even the ones that are most devout filled with the spirit can allow themselves to get worn down by circumstance if they're not aware if they don't catch it if they don't recognize it in time and they get to a place where they begin to speak and give voice to the circumstances of the atmosphere around them and they began to speak in doubt and we begin to let the testimony of our lips give voice to the doubt that has crept into our thinking and give voice to to to to things that are contrary to the message because right there the Bible says he was in service doing the ordinances lighting the candles doing all that his job was to do so he's in the middle of service church as it were and an angel comes to him to deliver the message of go of John's birth and instead of rejoicing in it instead of shouting in it instead of going out and testifying of this wonderful miracle that God's doing before he'd ever even seen any sign of it happening he gave voice to the circumstance of his age not only the age he lived in but the age he was he gave voice to the atmosphere of doubt that plagued the people of his day and he says I can't believe this I'm too old my wife is too old this is impossible he looked at the circumstance you know the thing is the Bible actually says that the angel tells him that the Lord has heard your prayer it was actually the thing that he was praying for do we even believe what we're asking for sometimes Lord send us a child Lord Lord send me we want to have a child the Lord has heard your prayer you're going to have a child no way we're too old for that and it happened right in the middle of a service and how many times the Holy Spirit come down and anoint a man of God to be to begin speaking right to the thing you've been asking for begin to speak to it your children are coming back your children are coming back you're going to be healed of that cancer you're going to be delivered instead of yes Lord It's like but my kid's been gone 30 years my kid don't even really know what the message about they're out there and the doctor says I can't get better right in the midst of the service under the anointing of the spirit and I want to ask you is anything too hard for the Lord and yet we respond to his promises our very prayers is being spoke back to us with doubt and with negativity but this is impossible possible but Lord and we speak doubt right in the face of the Angel we speak doubt right in the face of the promise we have to fight to stay in an atmosphere of Faith to where when that word comes forth we grab and goes yes that's right that's mine yes that's exactly right that's mine and not this can't be this can't be oh that's exactly what I've been praying for Lord that's exactly listen the Lord goes around dropping handfuls on purpose and we walk around going I'm hungry I'm hungry handful on purpose Lord give me something Lord meet my need Lord he's going and we walk right past it I guess it's never going to happen because the world around us is pressing in all the time and it's an atmosphere of doubt it's an atmosphere of of unbelief it's an atmosphere of this can never happen and you're surrounded by doubt and you're surrounded by an evil and chaotic atmosphere but that's no excuse you know what's incredible I was reading it's in Luke chapter 1 after this account I love how doubt took zachariah's voice away he could no longer speak no longer praise doubt will take your voice away too but what I love is when God brings his word to pass despite Zachariah and it says they handed him a tablet and he wrote the name John it says his mouth came open and the next 10 or 12 verses is him prophesying and giving glory and praise to God and what I see there is a man who recognized his error what I see is listen sometimes we come in doubt sometimes we come in fear sometimes we sit there in unbelief and wonder is this real is that the movement of the spirit is that really emotion well I doubt that's be careful I'll tell you this God's going to fulfill his word with or without you but when you see the word start to be in fulfilled at least have enough about you say I was wrong I Praise You Lord I give you glory Lord you are the king of kings you are the Lord of lords and Zachariah gives praise unto God when his mouth came open he used it for the right reasons but even though atmosphere B bothers us and attacks us and we have to war against it it's no excuse because in that exact same time in that exact same atmosphere visited by the exact same Angel is a little girl walking to the well but brother brandham says she'd been in an atmosphere they'd been talking about the message and they'd been reading the Scrolls and they were talking about how good the service was yesterday is that how your Mondays go hey it doesn't tell us Monday might have been horrible for her it might might have been the worst day of the week there might have been some rude people at the well but all I know was she was staying in the right atmosphere and in that atmosphere there was a Flicker and out of that flicker stepped an angel and it was the exact same angel that had come to Zachariah and told him and he said no that ain't going to happen but he tells her something even more difficult he says you're going to have a child without knowing a man and the holy spirit's going to overshadow you I say in a world full of doubters and a world full of Skeptics evening like Tabernacle let's be a Mary because Mary threw her shoulders back and said be it unto me Lord yes right there I take it that's my word I accept it let it be unto me there's going to be a Rapture well I don't know your sick are going to be healed I'm not sure all the prodical are coming home be it unto me be it unto me be it unto me I accept it I take it it's mine you can doubt all you want you can fear all you want but I'm walking in an atmosphere of faith our hearts have been turned back to Faith and I'm walking in that it's chaos everywhere things are impossible doctor's reports worse than it's ever been but we're walking in an atmosphere of faith and I can say I believe today more than I've ever believed before I believe now more than I've ever believed before that Lord you are my healer that Lord you are coming back to take a bride Lord that you are going to heal sister Jeanie Lord that you are going to heal Ron Spencer Lord that no matter what happens we believe more than ever I believe it is atmosphere that produces results one way or the other there was so many quotes and things about atmosphere and I had to kind of pick which way to go but brother brand I'm over and over teaches that it's atmosphere that brings the result you know how we talk about taking the egg and putting under a dog the atmosphere would make that egg hatch you got to get things in the right atmosphere he says and Brethren may I say this with reverence and respect to you as my brethren knowing that maybe before tonight before night we will all stand at the Judgment seat of Christ look may I say this it's the atmosphere always that brings forth the product see it's the atmosphere always that brings forth the product see and yet you're going to have to be willing to fight for that atmosphere Satan's not just giving it over going man y'all have a good time today man I just hope the Lord just really pours it out in there let me know how it goes when y'all come out no he ain't outside he's here he don't miss a service cuz he's here to battle the atmosphere he's here to fight your claim that you have a right to ascend into Heavenly places and he's here battling he's in your car battling teenagers he's in your room battling trying to get you to set the wrong atmosphere give into the wrong things he's in the home trying to make the wrong Atmosphere Trying to make you mouth off and be rebellious he fights you every single day to create the wrong atmosphere because in the wrong atmosphere God's children can't Blossom the way they're meant to the atmosphere all around us is filled with Devils we don't like to think of that we like to think oh there's angels all around there are but the atmosphere around us is filled with devils and tormentors and they're constantly pressing in on you trying to squeeze you and to press you into an atmosphere of negativity and doubt brother brandom says this now listen Satan is still here this is 1964 future home that's the reason all these things happen he is still here and all of his evil forces are still here notice that's why the earth now is filthy that's why the scum and ridiculous things that goes on Bloodshed War politics sin adultery all kinds of filthiness goes on is because that Satan is the ruler of the earth and this atmosphere he says you say the atmosphere yes sir both the heavens and earth now is contaminated with Devils that can accuse us before God Jesus is there to intercede for us see while the accusers keep pointing a finger saying they did this they did this they did this so it's all contaminated contaminated with devils accusing you day and night Non-Stop and they come and they accuse you in your ear and they accuse you in your mind and they accuse you before the Throne of God and we mentioned it earlier how how how they got there but we're going to stop for a minute we're going to go back in time we're going to see how he even got in this place and how man got in this place because we're going to go back before time even begin and and see how we got here to where it's such a bad attle for us to walk in faith and walk in the light because it wasn't that way for Adam it wasn't a battle at all that was the atmosphere that he lived in the atmosphere there was faith and peace and love he didn't have to fight it it's what it was because we can live in an atmosphere of Peace an atmosphere of Faith an atmosphere where there's where there's no fear where there's no funny feelings right now amen even in the midst of the greater atmosphere that would surround us on a daily basis we read in Genesis 1 that the world was without form and void and it was dark there was nothing it was without form it was in horrible shape there was no light there was churning Waters brother Bram says the world was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the Earth nothing but a complete chaos he then says in power of transformation and the Bible said in the beginning back there that the world was without form and was void there was nothing but just a darkness of chaos and what a horrible shape it must have been in nothing but but but way into darkness Yonder without light or anything and the churning of the water and that wondering star twisting around and around and orbits out there somewhere it must have been a Terri terrific mass of something lost like it couldn't find its way now what I want to focus on here for the next couple minutes is God's ability to take something like that that's and to completely change the situation I want you to see as as brother Brandon would preach this sermon and call it God's power to transform you ought to go listen to it God's power to transform but he describes it as we just read here as an absolute master of chaos chaos meaning complete disorder and confusion it was an awful condition but the Bible says there in Genesis 1 and two that the spirit of God moved church that's the key to everything you're facing this morning that's the key to every trial every situation every prodal every sickness that the spirit of God would move on that situation this morning when the spirit of God moved things began to to take place when the spirit of God moves chaos begins to come into perfect order and out of that great chaos came the Garden of Eden think about it this was the condition of the earth and the spirit of God moves and out of that comes an Eden chaos to Eden the entire picture changed because the spirit of God moved and because a word was spoke over that chaos there was a word spoke and the spirit of God moved it went from an unimaginable chaotic atmosphere where where everything was out of order like a terrific mass of something lost to the most Sublime most perfect peaceful atmosphere the world has ever known your world may be in utter chaos right now your situation may be unfathomable to you you may have got a report that you never thought you were going to get your children may be in places you never foresaw when you were raising them in your home your health may be in a place that there's no way to come back your spiritual walk your lukewarmness your family situation your your loved ones are out there like a twirling star lost somewhere and can't find its way but all you need is for the spirit of God to move upon that situation all you need is for one word One Moment spoke over that situation in the most chaotic most horrible most terrible situation becomes an Eden again it becomes a restored daughter a restored son a Sav family a family in harmony a church in harmony because the spirit of God moved upon the face of the deep all you need is for the spirit of God to move I don't see a way out you need the spirit of God to move I don't understand how this is going to work out my job's terrible I need a new job situation you need the spirit of God to move that's all you need is the answer and the remedy to all your troubles the devil gets in the atmosphere and he begins to stir and he begins to work and whip up storms against you but your chaos is not too hard for God your situation is not too hard for God you just need the spirit of God to move in that situation one word church I believe he's here to do it I believe he's here to meet your needs even this morning I believe he's here to move on your job situation even this morning I believe he's here to drive that cancer out of your body even this morning I believe he'll drive that anxiety that you've been dealing with out of your body even this morning that Spirit of depression out of your body even this morning that Spirit of cancer out of brother Ron's body even this morning I believe he's here to move upon the face of the deep the deep and the dark situations that we don't know what to do with and I just say move on the situation Lord let the spirit of God turn loose in this place this morning turn it loose and let's see an Eden come forth out of the chaos let's see a healing come forth out of the sickness he can take your situation and transform it into a testimony into a testimony of his power to transform the Earth is transformed there into an Eden and in the atmosphere of Eden there's no fear wo how good that sounds there's no fear in that atmosphere they don't know worry and sick and in that atmosphere Adam operates as a Son of God and he has dominion and he operates in the power of the spoken word he could stop the wind he could move a tree all by speaking to it because he had Dominion now that Satan is going to ascend to at some point and in that atmosphere he was on speaking terms with God I want to get this to you because there was fellow ship in the cool of the evening and God would come down and walk with his children there was no sin to separate them there was no reason that he couldn't do that that's right so he would come down and walk in the cool of the of the evening with his children in that Eden atmosphere because there was nothing between God and man the atmosphere as it were was clear but there came a time as you well know that that atmosphere changed everything changed because Satan wanted to get back into the heavens to get back to a place where he could rule and operate from a position of dominion and he had a plan to do this and he comes and he attacks and he causes man to fall and in that fall he steps into that position and man can no longer operate there and because man cannot operate there now there's something between him and God and so it breaks Fellowship between God and man Fellowship is broken and now fear enters in death enters in fellowship with God Is Lost and the Earth is given over to the devil the atmosphere is given over to the devil and I want to put it like this brother brandham says the heavens was shut off think about that one day God's coming down it's a regular occurrence you're walking with God I don't mean in the sense like we do I mean in the sense like he came down and walked beside them and they talk to him and how was your day kind of talk like children talk to their fathers that was a common occurrence and the next day the heavens are sealed shut off man completely separated from God and now there's a great mist and a fog of demon powers between the heavens and the Earth where once God would come down no more the powers was cut off the fellowship was cut off and as we saw there in our opening scripture in Ephesians Satan becomes entrenched as the ruler of the earth and as the prince of the power of the air and man begins to wander Alone brother Bram says after he lost his fellowship with God he become a Wanderer had to shift for himself God taken care of him before but now he finds he has to shift for himself and it's a pretty hard thing so he doesn't have a loving father to watch over him and protect him and guide him and direct him and feed him and cloth him and care for him like he did so instead of coming back he tries to find his own way he wants to make his own way back man wants to make his own way he always has always will I suppose try to find his own way and every time he makes his own way he gets it wrong take that for yourself this morning especially I'll say it for men it's hard for us sometimes you know how we don't like to stop and ask directions no I'll figure it out no I think I remember up here there's this one road that we're going to take goes east and we get it wrong sometimes we might get there but it may take a few extra turns and a few roads you didn't have to go down if you need to get back to God just do it his way just repent just make it right just come back to God and let him guide you don't try to do it on your own and soon in this new atmosphere without fellowship and seemingly with without hope man begins to slip once again into the chaos that was there before e a whirling Mass lost and the generations that followed the first Adam lost touch with Eden Eden became a story Grandpa told Eden became almost mythical Eden became something that was for a past age fellowship with God and worshiping God became optional and without contact and without fellowship and with the atmosphere clogged with demons in doubt they lost touch and the prophet of God says man in the fall has lost his conscience of what father put him on Earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it was in our brains and the outlets of faith has been clogged up with the business affairs with home life domestic things it all becomes so clogged up with that until God can't operate through those channels that he made a man for he specifically designed every part of your body to work in a certain way that life could function and he specifically designed it that he could function through it but through the fall man lost contact lost Consciousness lost the why they were here what their functions were supposed to be for and I want to say you better stay in contact with God stay in contact with God and stay in his word and stay in Fellowship I I don't care how good your home is and how good mom and daddy have it how much they stay in contact you better stay in contact with God or else you end up forgetting why you're here don't let it be long periods of time between your fellowship with God I I don't care how many times you've had encounters don't let it go camp to Camp before you have another experience before you have another move don't even let it go service to service stay in contact with God because what got man in this trouble was when they fell fellowship and contact was cut off and they forgot what they were here for they forgot their very purpose so don't let it go long periods of time without that contact because that's how Satan got us in this mess to begin with but I do want to say and we'll bring this around here in a minute that we live in a different situation than the Saints of old because Jesus came and he made a way of access so that now you can have that Fellowship once again you can have that contact once again but you're going to have to fight for it but it's worth fighting for yes it's worth fighting for the generations after Adam that they they forgot their purpose the generations after Adam for forgot because all the outlets were clogged and I want to say this the atmospheres were clogged and the same thing happened after the second Adam because now he has another body on Earth and it's not just my body it's not just yours but it's the body of Christ it's the church and they forgot what the body of Christ would was made for amen they forgot what the purpose of his body on the Earth was for just like this body of Flesh was designed in a way with every little part in mind it was designed in a way uh uh that that life could flow through it God designed his church in a perfect way and each part of the design plays a critical role in it living and functioning properly we can't forget what the church is here for we can't let let Amnesia as it were come in and cut us off from what he put us here for we can't allow the ideas of man to change while we're here the ideas and doctrines of man to to change the way we operate we can't go for long periods of time without him moving in a service we can't just say it's okay just to have an average service there should be no such thing as an average service you should be able to leave every service and be able to tell what God did for you in that service how God spoke to your heart in that service how you're going to apply it to your life what came out of that service it wasn't average it was words of eternal life anointed by the spirit of God moving over those words because it doesn't take long sitting in a dead atmosphere to think that's a normal atmosphere it doesn't take long sitting in a formal atmosphere to think that's a normal atmosphere this body of Christ is built for the supernatural I'm going to remind you how he made the body he made it for Supernatural he made it to soar in the heavenlies he made it for the miraculous he made it for manif manifesting his power this body is for the heavenlies it's built for manifestations of the spirit listen the body of Christ can't stand the atmosphere of a chicken yarn the body of Christ can't stand the atmosphere of negativity amen the body of Christ can't stand the atmosphere of chickens who go around and and nitpick one another you know that's what happens when a chicken gets a sore right all the other chickens gather around and they peck it and make it worse whereas Eagles when they see another one of the Eagles there scabbed over and down in the valley they'll drop food to them brother I see you're struggling this might help I see you're going through something this might help instead of well I can't believe you did that what were you thinking what is wrong with you this isn't helping me at all the body of Christ is made for the chicken yarn it's made to lift up above into the Heavenly atmospheres never forget what this body is designed for brother brand puts it clear right here he said if God designed man's body he certainly designed the body of his son the church and he has designed us to come together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have these Supernatural workings of God Outlets through gifts of the Spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and Gifts of healing and all these other different gifts it's Outlets that God lets out his power and lets out his revelation to the people that's how God designed the body remember one thing you didn't design the body I didn't design the body so let's don't go and church order all the outlets right out of the body to where God can't live and move and express himself the way the body was designed to live and move and express itself it's designed in that way without Outlets let's not forget what the body is for it's to manifest him manifest his glory manifest his power manifest his miracles because the devil knows if I can clog up the outlets if I can clog up the outlets I they can't get no power from it if the outlets are clogged up and they forget that it's supposed to flow like this and it's allowed to flow like that and I restored the gifts here so that it would manifest my power if they forget then they can't get no power from the outlet don't let the outlets get clogged up evening like Tabernacle don't let the outlets get clogged up I say we coming to a place that we we ought to Let Freedom Ring in the house of God we got to let the life flow through Eden and light Tabernacle to to create an atmosphere of life where God can flow through every one of these Outlets that he designed and God can manifest himself through his body that he designed and that's why we drive at home so much that's why we preach about it so much brother brandom says here that whatever is taught in a church is the atmosphere you will find but y'all talk about that a lot I know that's the atmosphere we want y'all preach about that a lot yeah yeah because we want that atmosphere we want the atmosphere where somebody can get receive the Holy Ghost we want an atmosphere where where a sinner can weep his way to Calvary we want an atmosphere where the miraculous takes place and so we preach about that all the time he says and now we find out that those atmospheres he says and you get in wherever those things where faith is taught in a church you'll find a church in that atmosphere where faith is preached from the word the children live amen and then in a way only brother Bram can do he just says it real simply that's the difference it's just life and death it's just life and death so we have to be careful when we go to labeling things with it's just emotion or it's just this or it's just that wherever you want to label it whatever side of the things you well they just starts before you go to labeling anything brother brandham labeled it as it's just life and death so how are we supposed to act there's not a rule book you're supposed to be free that's how you're supposed to act yes sir thank you pe people sometimes get it wrong and they get the wrong idea and they think that we promote things like isua Pentecost and like we say they had their place in the restoration we understand that but what isua became was not freedom of worship because they had to that's you had to speak in tongues or you had to run you had to shout or it wasn't a good service that's not Freedom at all that's bondage we're not promoting that we want you to run jump sh what we're promoting is freedom to where when God moves you can move how God leads you to move that's it that's it and if you have a problem with the promotion of Freedom that means you have are promoting bondage it's a matter of life and death it's black and white there is no gray area in this discussion are y'all for emotion no I'm For Freedom it's not singling things out are you for this it's are you for Freedom or are you for bondage that's the two categories that's the categories we're for Freedom this has to be a place where we always will Let Freedom Ring because if we're not careful and I want to go down this just because I feel too and it might take up a little bit of my time but I feel to go here don't get to the place to where because there wasn't shouting running jumping tongues that you don't walk away and think it was a good service do not get to that place many times some of the greatest most powerful Services have this sweet solemn spirit that just drops in and deals with the man and woman's heart always be impressed by the word the quality of the word which the word itself is good quality right but what what what is preached and the way the Lord comes behind it and the way he operates in the heart determines or should determine how we label it not that we should label service I'm just speaking in a way we can all understand that it was a good service because if we get to the place like it got in isua to where it was such a good service we ran and screamed and shouted so much that we didn't have preaching you're not in a good place a good service is when God deals with hearts that's a good service now we have preferences or we have times of refreshing in the Lord he y'all know me y'all know how I feel and how emotional I get I'm all about it you run around the church right now you ain't going to offend me none I'm for it sometimes we need it but God knows what we need and when we need it we do not want nor do we promote an emotional work up now if God moves through the building and you get emotional I'm all for it why wouldn't you how can you not I'll move on atmospheres produce atmospheres produce man fell back into chaos again and after the fall Satan ruled completely over the atmosphere and I'm going to go quickly now darkness and Gloom Blom hung over the Earth Fellowship was broken Heavens was shut off from Mankind and yet that was all about to change I want you to think about the place that man stood with no access to Heavens prayers couldn't even Ascend there was no access to Fellowship man was that twirling star lost in a matter of chaos that was the condition of man but it was all about to change because the very one who originally had spoke Eden out of a chaos had spoke Eden out of turmoil had spoke Eden out of that awful condition that the Earth had been in was determined once again to have fellowship with man he was determined that chaos would not always reain over the hearts of his children he was determined to make a way I'm so thankful today that he made the way and and he he was determined and it was chaos in the beginning and the spirit of God moved and then it was chaos after the fall and God became flesh oh Hallelujah the spirit of God moved and brought an Eden and then there fell and then there was chaos and then God became flesh and stepped in and stepped down into Earth and that flesh came down in the most chaotic time and he came down in that time to show how a man can create an atmosphere around himself of Peace in the midst of a storm he came and showed how that Satan may be the prince of the power of the air and and he may be able to stir things up and and bring up a storm and bring things up against you but he was still subject to the word when the word would stand and say peace be still he came to show that even though he's the prince of the power of the air when you take the word upon your lips on the mouth of a believing man or woman it's the same as deity speaking and he may have put his foot up on the bow of a boat and stopped a physical storm but what about the storms in your life this morning he came so that you would have a way back so that you would have Fellowship so that you would be on speaking terms again so that you like Adam in the garden could look at that wind of sickness in your life that wind of turmoil in your family and you can stand there and put your shoulders back as a redeemed son or daughter of the Living God and say peace be still and the winds have to calm down the storm has to calm down and the Seas have to become calm he came to show that that's how man could operate and he came into this atmosphere that was cut out that had been cut off from the Heavens to do battle against the enemy to do battle against spiritual wickedness and high places and this is what I came into as I was studying about atmospheres and it just thrilled my heart maybe it's just common knowledge to everybody and and I don't know but I just never seen it like this before yes he came to conquer sin and he came to conquer death hell in the grave but there's a piece that we often Overlook brother brandham says the Ascension is not talked about enough he says he came to conquer atmospheres and all the evil that was there so that you once again could return to Heavenly places and have access to the heavens once again so that your prayers could go up before God and so that his answers could come down to you he said there's so little spoke of this Ascension it's one of the greatest days when he ascended up cuz all over the Earth since the day in the Garden of Eden that sin was committed all Heavens was shut off from mankind when he was on the earth he conquered passions Pride he conquered sickness he conquered Devils but when he died he conquered death when he arose he conquered hell and when he went up and he conquered everything that was against mankind it then went into the wine press of God and crushed it down and conquered death hell grave sickness formalities everything else and overcome it all and Rose on the third day and conquered all the atmospheres above and he cut the Mist between God and man and he connected Heaven to Earth again glory to God once again man was connected he ripped through the atmospheres he ripped through the demons and he made a highway as he went back up past the moon passed Mar through the Milky Way he tore through the atmosphere of [Applause] devils he said and as they went out he conquered the grave then there was a great Mist hanging over the Earth yet so he had to conquer that mist of sin that mist of stench of the sins of the people and with his own blood his vesture dipped in blood he conquered the atmosphere above Blessed Be His holy name he cut the fogs of Hell from place to place until he cut a whole through the sky Adam's lost children could pray through to Victory he conquered the atmospheres he conquered sin he conquered death he conquered hell and he rose triumphant Hallelujah Satan sit there and says you don't have a right you don't have a right to come into Heavenly atmospheres you don't have a right oh I do Satan there was a mighty conqueror and he rose through the atmosphere and he tore your hold upon it you may be the prince of the power of the air but I have a right to say peace be still I have a right to worship here I have a right to live here I have a right to abide here Jesus Made A Way Hallelujah Hall he conquered atmospheres no man can see the glory of God no man can understand the glories of God was shut off the powers was shut off Fellowship was shut off but our conqueror tore through the midst of demons tore through the fog of demons and granted us access to Heaven once again granted us access to God once again he ripped the veil of atmospheres and paved the way not only for us to be able to sit in Heavenly places now but he paved a highway cuz he knew one of these days I got a bride coming how she going to go he made a way he paved a highway he listen we couldn't have went up before the atmosphere was conquered no man ascended up that's what the scripture says we couldn't Ascend up we couldn't go there it was clogged with demons and torments but he said I got a bride coming and she's going to come up through the atmosphere she's going to rise up to meet me in the air and so he tore a highway and he marked it well with his own blood and he said this is the way this is the way rise to meet me little bride brother Brown says the Bible said he ascended on high and gave gifts unto men there was an atmosphere hung over the Earth of Darkness of Gloom of death and weary the prayers couldn't come up because the atonement wasn't made but he broke through that Veil and he opened up the way the atmosphere may be full of demons this morning church it may be full of devils but there is a Highway made right through it all there is a Highway in the glory and one of these mornings when the trumpet sounds one of these mornings with the trumpet sounds we're going to gather with our Mighty conqueror think about this now it's just me I liked it right there in the place that Satan supposedly controls right there in the place that he laid claim to right there where he blockaded all men where he had wared with angels where he had blocked our blessings you say blocked our blessings yeah brother brandham says all the sins that's in Heaven above he is the prince of the power of the air he keeps off the blessings from God in there comes Thunderbolts of lightning and strikes the Earth and everything from the heavens Sheets of slicey Rain typhoons storms and everything comes from above which is Satan the prince of the power there look we saw this in Daniel we saw this in the Book of Daniel 10 where he had to wait 21 days because the the the prince of the power of Persia battled the angel to keep him from getting to Daniel Satan has laid claim to those atmospheres for years and years and years and yet Jesus made a way that we can make a claim to them because they rightfully belong to us and he says in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds and meet the Lord in the air and so we shall ever be with the Lord it shows it's been reconquered it shows that we have a right to it it shows that that's a place that we can operate from live in abide in we can listen listen we're called to Rise Above This layot toan atmosphere you're called to rise above that depression that's holding you down you're called to rise above that anxiety you're called to a Heavenly atmosphere and he paved the way just walk up the King's Highway this morning just rise above it a little bit this morning and Fight for Your god-given Atmosphere because now we have a right we have a right yes it is the atmosphere of the end time but we can sit in Heavenly places and live in an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost to where our lives are not dictated by that atmosphere I'm G skip some of this now as I as I as I bring this down brother brandham taught us very clearly that it's atmosphere that does it it's worth fighting for every service every devotion at home every moment conquer the atmosphere around you fight for the right atmosphere around you he says well that's what the word of God is if you take any promise of God and place it in the right atmosphere it'll produce exactly what it is in its life we will get and I'm going to bring this down and and yes I'm talking about your life and not just Sunday Wednesday but I'm going to bring this down to service for just a minute we will get we will receive what we get based off the atmosphere we create you say brother I disagree it's the word that does these things it's the word that we got to have true we must have the word but it must be placed in the right atmosphere in order to produce what that word promised listen to brother brandom here this this was amazing to me he said what difference does that make I don't care how many nails you got how many pieces AC cross you got we need to produce this word again amen put it on a cross on a nail not on a cross or on a nail but on the living atmosphere of the holy spirit that brings forth the results God's word under the right atmosphere will produce exactly what it says it'll do it's got to be in the right atmosphere though you can't lay it over in the Seminary or some Bible school that don't believe in signs and wonders it'll never happen amen so you take this exact word and you place it somewhere that don't believe in it and it has no power well those things never happen in our church well know you don't believe in it well we do believe it well brother brandham says that the atmosphere of the church will be what is preached so if you believe it preach it but you lay it in a place that has no atmosphere it will do nothing he says it's got to be in the right atmosphere you can't lay it over in the Seminary it'll never happen it'll never break forth and bring life there the atmosphere is wrong you got to put it in the right atmosphere so listen he says we can't have a healing service until people get in the spirit of a healing service yes we can't have a filling of the Holy Ghost until people get in that kind of atmosphere so apparently there is a that kind of atmosphere that goes along with people getting filled with the Holy Ghost and the people was in the atmosphere in that day to bring judgment upon the Earth and they're in the same atmosphere today I'm going to read this quote it's a little long he says they was blessing God for the Holy Ghost he's talking about the day of Pentecost Why didn't it come sooner which had never come yet but they believed that it was because God was going to keep his promise and when they kept blessing God until the atmosphere got right then there came from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and filled all the house that were sitting there see the atmosphere got right oh could we get an atmosphere here that every crippled every blind every sick person everything all with one Accord believing he said I seen it just last week in Wood River where there wasn't a person left they just piled up the crutches and Wheelchairs and CS I was standing at the platform preaching like this and they just begin to raise up and throw them in the corner why the atmosphere got right what would happen if we would come together in every service determined to get the atmosphere right determined to do my part not worried about what other people listen listen I can't worry if you're not worshiping I can't worry if you're worshiping really loud as a matter of fact I shouldn't worry what you're doing any at all when it comes to worship now when it comes to standing here it's a little different it's difficult to not worry about it when you're asleep on me but when it comes to worship it's my job to worry about my worship and if I will just be determined to do my part cuz I know when I come I know he's going to try to hinder I know he's going to try to fight I know it's not always going to be easy but we have to remember we are the creators of atmospheres and we have a right to sit in Heavenly places we have a right to the things written in the word of God we have a right to the power of God moving in our midst we have a right to worship Him in spirit and truth and if the atmosphere is what brings on the supernatural then why wouldn't we want to do everything within our power to create a super natural atmosphere every single time we come together and make sure the atmosphere gets right brother brand says what we need is a holy ghost atmosphere that's right an atmosphere where the power of God's moving one Accord one place gathered together under that atmosphere of expecting God to move down and do signs and wonders amen let's move ourselves up now for the people that think this is Elementary brother Bram says it's moving up but because that atmosphere is now available to us he says let's move ourselves up into that bracket so an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost an atmosphere of signs and wonders and shouting and tongues and prophecies is a move upen he said let's move ourselves up into that bracket Step Up in faith move out of these three dimensions up into that next one say Lord I'm just believing you're going to pour out your blessings I'm expecting it now all things are moving right in and I'm expecting to see exceedingly abundantly now I'm expecting it you come down and say now listen you come down and say well I don't know about it he goes right from that to but you come down and say well I don't know about does that sound super negative that's not awful that's not like saying well that's just a bunch of workup well that's not right that wasn't the spirit now that's harsh but he says you're just sitting there going I don't really know about it well you see you've hurt the other person right well you see you've hurt the other person because it's a battle for atmosphere you just put a Log on the Fire of negativity and now it's burning a little brighter next to the other person who was trying to push through who was trying to fight into that atmosphere and Break Forth but your little seed of Doubt was an anchor the atmosphere you create right now just judge yourself judge yourself right here or in any service it either benefits the service or hinders there's no such thing as in between there's no such thing as I was just an observer well then You Hinder the service I'm sorry that's just that's how it is this has nothing to do with how I'm natured how I'm this you know good and well I don't believe that every single person has a run jump dance Shout Scream the top of lung that's not what I'm asking you to do but did you enter in that's what I'm talking about did you enter in I I didn't today you hindered the service I understand you had a bad day I get it why did you have to put your bad day on all of us amen because you have the power right now in this moment in this service to transform the atmosphere around you out of chaos came an Eden because he was the creator and now that Creator is on the inside of you and you have the power to create personal a personal atmosphere that welcomes God now multiply that personal Atmosphere by 250 what kind of atmosphere could we create in this building right in the middle of Leota a Heavenly atmosphere we could truly sit together in Heavenly places as God moves however he sees fit through an atmosphere that welcomes him that pulled on the word what's that mean I pulled on the word I pulled on Jesus to come to my Pew that's what it means well I'm not really a puller today's a good time to start you know I I didn't really get spoke to today did you pull it out of the man of God you operate the gift by pulling for the needs that you have I never get anything you never pull you talking about me no I'm talking about whoever that hit between the eyes I don't I don't know who it is I have no idea but I say let's get the atmosphere right in our homes let's fight for the right atmosphere in our services let's fight for the right atmosphere around us that other people recognize they've stepped into something different we didn't even go into the that this time brother Brown deals with individual atmospheres maybe at another time but you have the ability for people to know you're different by the atmosphere that you live in in an atmosphere where where where people accuse and demons Rule and demons ACC accuse and they influence when troubles come into the church I'm going rise above that atmosphere I'mma change that atmosphere when gossip and unbelief come in I'm going to change that atmosphere when Satan tries to come and make us cold and formal I'm going to change that atmosphere I'm not going to stand for it because look it don't we're in Louisiana it don't take but a little cold front to mess things up you know they say natural types of spiritual so I'm just going there we had one day of cold in the world shut down I know it SED a little bit I'm thinking we might get to stay home a day my kids homeschool poor kids Public Schools got out for a week I gave them Monday you can safely get from your bed to the [Applause] classroom going to be no trouble here but what's my point you let the atmosphere change a little bit let the roads get a little icy and all of a sudden we're all froze over we're all stuck at home life changes we ain't moving but then let the sun start to shine again Hey listen if you froze up a little bit the sun's out this morning if you've been froze for a little while the sun's out this morning it's time to Tha out a little bit it's time to work those joints out a little bit it's time to say praise the Lord for your many blessings God you're good I'm going to live in a heaven atmosphere I'm going to call Heaven on the scene for my needs I'm going to cry out to God I'm going to praise him I'm going to worship him I say create an atmosphere in even light Tabernacle where the devil ain't welcome where cancer flees where sickness flees where bondage is Loos into freedom and Eden comes forth in your life create a Heavenly atmosphere where all things are possible just give praise to God Heavenly Father how we love you this morning morning how we worship you how we praise you Lord you are worthy of Praise Hallelujah you are the alpha and omega you are the beginning and the end Lord God we welcome you with our Praises Lord come into this place Lord change Hearts father speak to lives Lord may we walk in an atmosphere of Peace may we walk in an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost thank you Lord thank you Lord may we live in a place where all things are possible he's a faithful God he's a mighty God he's a promis keeper he said I'll never leave you or forsake you it's the worst atmosphere that's ever been he hasn't left us he's still on the inside of you saying there can be an Eden in your heart there can be an Eden around you oh when we create the right atmosphere and he begins to move thank then all things are possible if you can get the people to believe then not even cancer will stand before you that's the kind of people we are but it takes the atmosphere there is special atmospheres for special situations for special needs he said it you want healing getting a healing atmosphere what do you think happened when the pool of Bethesda was troubled the atmosphere changed it was a changing atmosphere he said you want people to get the Holy Ghost get a holy ghost [Music] atmosphere all mys have been held in your hand from the moment that I wake up until I we're seated together in Heavenly places hey come down to confirm that this [Music] morning you he conquered death he

if you have to break me Lord and bless the [Music] broken I want to be you [Music] right right now in this atmosphere an atmosphere of Faith an atmosphere of [Music] believing we got brother Ron with this report and we're not here to bring fear or preach fear but I think you understand how serious where we're at is this is the moment we talked about end times and the and this is the moment to where God has to intercede that's where we [Music] are and just for a moment I want you to think about the times that he's fought for your young people that he's fought for you that he stood in this pull pit I've been right there with him getting ready to come out and he says take me out the back door and he walks out and pukes seven times as they're calling him up wipe his mouth and come to the pull pit and preach under the anointing and the power of God right now I want you to consecrate your thinking to consecrate your mind lay everything else aside and we're going to show what I believe happens when you get in the right atmosphere we're going to have brother Joe lead us in prayer and yes it's for brother Ron but it's also for you aun jeie same demon she's in a desperate condition too anybody with cancer is in a desperate condition but I want you to pray I don't want them just to hear Joe Adams on the recording May the voices of the saints of God at evening like Tabernacle ring into the heavens into the atmospheres that Christ made a way for us to enter into he did it so prayers like this could go up so that answers like healing could come down in this moment in this time will you pray with us for brother Ron amen I sent this to brother Tim this morning as he was preparing to go forth and to preach there with the Believers at brother Ron's church I said draw your sword and fight like you never fought before if you know anything about brother Tim he's got a fighting Spirit he's a man that believes this word with his entire heart and because of who he is and because of how he preaches each of us has been endued with that same Spirit to never give up to never walk away from the battle I said you've been called for this hour and you've been anointed for this [Music] purpose cut your way through the victory for the Spencer family and cut your way through the victory for the family of God each of you here today has a need it may not be cancer but may be a loved one it may be a son it may be a daughter of God I counted over 20 prodical the other day that should be sitting in the house of God each of you have your own battle you just heard about creating an atmosphere where the presence of God can come down and each of you today have a sword that God has placed in your hand and I'm going to ask you David I'm going to ask you sons of God will you draw your sword this morning will you cut your way through the victory this morning will you do that this morning then I believe we as a Church of the Living God the church even light Tabernacle God has endued us God has place within the ranks of this church the atmosphere that the supernatural can come down and miracles can take place he's still the god of impossibilities he's still the god that heals he's still that God that deliver us and father God today Lord we're believing for the impossible God to report say it's over the reports say it's no use the reports say that cancer is dropped down and come from his brain back into his eyes but God we're not looking at the reports this morning God we're looking at the word we're looking at the promise oh God you said that the people of God we believe Lord we believe the message of the hour we believe that the word is true we believe that we're sons of God we believe that deity is here we believe that the Holy Ghost is empowering the people and Satan we come against you this morning and we defy you you demon of Hell take your hands off of Ron Spencer take your hands off of Genie Camp take your hands off even like Tabernacle take

fighting for the healing of Ron Spencer we're fighting for the faith of Full Gospel Tabernacle we're fighting this morning Lord and the Living God is on the scene in the midst of chaos oh there's an eaten that's come down to a need condition where she can speak to the things in her life she can speak to the storm and the storms had to cease father we're here Lord we're here as the man in the

just remember what sister Erica Erica Parker said Lord before she passed on that dumb old devil doesn't he know it doesn't end this way and Satan I want to remind you one more time it doesn't end this way there's a body of Believers this morning who are uniting themselves together not only at evening light Tabernacle but across the globe right now and we're praying for Ron Spencer we're believing
