[51:05] also brother Jeremy and and his wife and
[51:08] sister April and brother Stephen and
[51:12] sister Tara and all of you I'd like to
[51:15] thank you for coming to our Labor Day
[51:16] meeting
[51:17] while you you came and it was such a
[51:20] wonderful blessing I never heard your
[51:22] preacher preach that great in his life
[51:26] amen and I know you enjoyed it amen I
[51:30] know you enjoyed it
[51:32] that should have been the best amen of
[51:34] the whole
[51:36] amen so we we love brother Tim we've
[51:40] been buddies a long time now
[51:42] and I don't know why I got grayer and he
[51:45] got darker headed and so
[51:47] and that's just how it is
[51:49] thank you for every prayer that you have
[51:51] prayed for me and God's been with us in
[51:54] this journey it's not for sissies but we
[51:57] are still standing
[51:59] still cutting Devil's heads off and here
[52:01] we are
[52:02] Psalms chapter 27 and verse 1.
[52:06] I'd like to speak to you this evening
[52:08] and maybe just somewhat of a simple
[52:10] thought
[52:11] on let's finish this
[52:19] amen Psalms chapter 27 and verse 1.
[52:23] we identify this as the Rapture
[52:26] scriptures
[52:28] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[52:31] Whom Shall I Fear
[52:34] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[52:36] whom shall I be afraid
[52:39] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[52:41] foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[52:44] they stumbled and fell
[52:46] though a host should encamp against me
[52:49] my heart
[52:51] shall not fear
[52:53] the war shall rise against me and this
[52:57] will I be confident
[52:59] one thing that I have desired of the
[53:01] Lord that I will I seek after that I may
[53:05] dwell in the house of the Lord all of
[53:08] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[53:12] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[53:16] for in the time of trouble
[53:19] he shall hide me
[53:22] in his Pavilion
[53:24] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[53:27] hide me and he shall set me upon a rock
[53:30] you may be seated this evening
[53:36] I find it very interesting that brother
[53:38] Branham when he's beginning to speak on
[53:40] the Rapture he reads these scriptures
[53:43] an infinite God that knows
[53:46] the beginning from the end the Alpha and
[53:49] Omega
[53:50] has the last age Prophet to use these
[53:53] scriptures that David is writing about
[53:56] as his theme thought
[53:59] that I have hidden you
[54:02] I have hidden you as the final voice as
[54:05] the final age I have hidden you in my
[54:09] Pavilion
[54:11] I I've got this taken care of
[54:15] it wasn't we that have gathered
[54:17] ourselves here together
[54:23] it wasn't we that gathered ourselves
[54:27] it was God
[54:29] and when you think about this you and I
[54:32] had very little to do with this because
[54:35] you wasn't looking for God God came
[54:38] looking for you
[54:42] and and remember it he took charge of
[54:45] you he's your husband he's the he's the
[54:48] king of your heart
[54:50] he has given you everything that you
[54:53] need for life's journey and for the
[54:55] battles that you will face in your life
[54:58] and so when he's writing through David
[55:01] thousands of years ago these words are
[55:05] more than a song it's more than a than a
[55:08] poem but it's power packed for the Bride
[55:12] of Jesus Christ
[55:14] for in the time of trouble
[55:19] I've got you
[55:26] we see a man named Putin
[55:30] screaming to fulfill scriptures
[55:33] screaming to prop to fulfill the
[55:36] prophecy that is written
[55:39] Israel is screaming for a messiah
[55:44] they're screaming to be a part of that
[55:46] that word that is a part of them
[55:50] but there's a bride that's on the Earth
[55:54] there's Angels standing holding back
[55:58] Putin and all of his armies and nuclear
[56:01] weapons
[56:03] they cannot fulfill ahead of time
[56:07] everything is on time
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:13] and brother David's country
[56:16] he is in a he has a place where they
[56:18] have a clock that is called Big Ben it's
[56:21] supposed to be one of the greatest
[56:22] clocks that there is in the world on
[56:25] time let me just say it has nothing on
[56:28] God's timepiece
[56:31] God's time is not a second off
[56:34] [Applause]
[56:37] I think about the Gathering of a setting
[56:39] here together
[56:41] and I I'd like to just use a couple of
[56:43] illustrations sometimes we just take for
[56:46] granted somebody else is in the building
[56:49] brother Dave and mayor that sets behind
[56:52] us at
[56:53] standing here
[56:56] Head and Shoulders above us all
[57:03] incredible Prince of a man
[57:06] he spoke to you on Sunday
[57:10] that was the best I've ever heard him
[57:11] speak
[57:13] and God came and amen at the end of the
[57:16] service
[57:17] [Applause]
[57:21] your response ought to have been better
[57:23] than that
[57:24] it's one thing for a man to speak then
[57:26] then God Amen
[57:28] [Music]
[57:39] we we became almost common listening to
[57:44] the tapes that brother Brandon would
[57:45] speak a sermon
[57:47] and we could we could give a list of
[57:49] sermons that brother Branham would speak
[57:51] and then he would turn into the
[57:53] prophetic gift
[57:55] and God would amen the word and begin to
[57:57] call names and where they were from and
[58:00] their addresses and their condition what
[58:02] the doctor said
[58:06] he would rare his shoulders back and say
[58:08] he's here
[58:09] [Applause]
[58:11] he would remind us that we're not
[58:13] feeding on the mind of a man
[58:15] but we were feeding on the body word of
[58:18] the son of man
[58:19] we weren't it wasn't even feeding on the
[58:22] personality of William Branham though we
[58:25] loved him and had phenomenal respect for
[58:28] him and still do
[58:29] but it was the mighty angel that was a
[58:32] company
[58:34] there was not another man on the sea
[58:37] I can say this without without even with
[58:40] a declaration there was another
[58:43] phenomenal speaker on the sea and there
[58:46] was phenomenal speakers but there was
[58:48] not another one
[58:50] all right
[58:52] that had been met by an Angel in the
[58:55] cave
[58:56] that would stand there night after night
[58:59] after night after night confirming this
[59:02] message
[59:04] our Prophet had to leave the scene but
[59:07] the angel is still here
[59:24] I heard Brother David speak
[59:26] who is like our God
[59:30] and then he would use Danny Henry's
[59:33] as he stood there and he spoke that in
[59:36] the French language how would you like
[59:37] to hear that
[59:39] how it sounded I I was with you
[59:43] I applauded that
[59:45] was incredible then at the end of the
[59:48] service God spoke to you
[59:51] [Applause]
[59:52] not David May or God spoke to you
[59:57] I like that
[59:59] more than a man more than a pastor more
[1:00:02] than a group of people
[1:00:03] [Applause]
[1:00:04] he's confirming his word
[1:00:07] [Applause]
[1:00:11] Brother David was a
[1:00:14] was in his father-in-law's Church
[1:00:16] knowing well
[1:00:18] Sister Anne 's father and mother
[1:00:23] and Brother David was interpreting for
[1:00:26] me
[1:00:26] wasn't a preacher
[1:00:28] I told this at brother biskels is it
[1:00:30] okay to tell it again
[1:00:34] just a smile
[1:00:42] so I I and God just moved on me
[1:00:47] spoken to my heart
[1:00:50] and I turned to Brother David as we're
[1:00:52] standing in in Switzerland
[1:00:55] and I said don't interpret this
[1:00:57] but God's calling you to speak and be a
[1:01:00] preacher and Pastor a church
[1:01:04] he wasn't even a preacher
[1:01:08] but the amen is there's now a church
[1:01:16] it's one thing for something to speak
[1:01:18] something or have an unction for
[1:01:20] something but God opened the door
[1:01:24] I don't care what critic says I'm not
[1:01:26] interested in the credit
[1:01:36] it was in one of those meetings as I
[1:01:38] walked by Brother Joshua and I've never
[1:01:40] said your last name right
[1:01:42] Von braunt
[1:01:45] I'm not a Belgian knees
[1:01:50] as I walked by him and he was standing
[1:01:53] as a deacon in the in the meetings about
[1:01:55] 450 people and I walked by him
[1:02:01] and I turned and went back to you
[1:02:03] and told you that God was calling you to
[1:02:05] preach
[1:02:06] and now about six to seven years
[1:02:11] has been a preacher
[1:02:14] it was just a couple of years ago that
[1:02:17] God called your father home
[1:02:21] but he got to hear you preaching
[1:02:27] I'm going to just can I talk to you just
[1:02:29] a bit
[1:02:31] you know I'm fighting to live you can
[1:02:33] listen to me a little bit
[1:02:38] your dad was so proud of you
[1:02:41] it was in North Carolina
[1:02:44] your father was at the end of the meet
[1:02:45] we were at the end of the meeting
[1:02:47] and I had spoke to where that God can't
[1:02:49] operate out and because I we had some
[1:02:51] critics in the room if God can't operate
[1:02:54] out here he'll operate in the back room
[1:02:55] Miracle after miracle happened behind
[1:02:58] the curtain and your father came back
[1:03:02] and it was told to your father
[1:03:06] God's there's a train coming
[1:03:09] go ahead and get on in a couple of
[1:03:11] months later God took him home
[1:03:15] but he had a desire
[1:03:18] that he constantly would remind me of
[1:03:21] that would be son Isaiah
[1:03:25] he said
[1:03:26] I want Isaiah to come home I want him to
[1:03:28] serve the Lord
[1:03:32] some things I can't say from the pulpit
[1:03:34] I want him to come home I want his wife
[1:03:36] him and his wife together I want them to
[1:03:38] serve the Lord so when you look over at
[1:03:41] them brother Isaiah your wife if you
[1:03:44] just raise your hand just now
[1:03:46] there's a miracle
[1:04:08] these are names that were in the Lamb's
[1:04:11] books
[1:04:14] these are names that were in the Lamb's
[1:04:16] books
[1:04:18] and Satan did everything possible
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:23] like he did you to destroy you
[1:04:26] before you were ever born
[1:04:30] but Satan can't stop you
[1:04:32] [Applause]
[1:04:42] in Revelations chapter 19 I want to I
[1:04:46] have I have read what God has fortified
[1:04:48] you with and now I want to read you
[1:04:49] where we're headed
[1:04:51] and I want to remind the devil
[1:04:55] that we are not
[1:04:57] we're not just going to finish here
[1:05:00] [Applause]
[1:05:02] we're not just going to finish here
[1:05:05] we're going to walk off of this Earth
[1:05:07] but we've got a place to go
[1:05:11] we're going to spend eternity together
[1:05:13] [Applause]
[1:05:15] and I heard a great voice
[1:05:18] of a great multitude as a voice of many
[1:05:21] Waters and a voice of Mighty thundering
[1:05:24] saying hallelujah for the Lord God
[1:05:28] omnipotent arenas
[1:05:30] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:05:34] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:05:36] Lamb has come and his wife has made
[1:05:41] herself ready
[1:05:44] Revelations 21 and verse 1 and I saw a
[1:05:48] new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:05:51] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[1:05:53] were passed away and there was no more
[1:05:56] sea and I John saw the holy city the New
[1:06:00] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:06:02] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:06:05] her husband and I heard a great voice
[1:06:07] out of Heaven's saying behold the
[1:06:09] Tabernacle of God is with men
[1:06:12] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:06:14] shall be his people and God himself
[1:06:17] shall be with them and be their God
[1:06:20] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:06:24] their eyes
[1:06:27] and there shall be no more death
[1:06:29] [Applause]
[1:06:33] there shall be no more death
[1:06:36] neither sorrow nor Pride neither shall
[1:06:41] there be any more pain for the former
[1:06:44] things are passed away
[1:06:46] he that set up on the throne said behold
[1:06:48] I make all things new and he said unto
[1:06:51] me right for these things these words
[1:06:54] are true and faithful and he said unto
[1:06:58] me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the
[1:07:02] beginning and the end and I will give
[1:07:04] unto him that is the thirst of the
[1:07:06] Fountain of Water of Life freely he that
[1:07:08] overcometh
[1:07:15] he that overcometh
[1:07:18] shall inherit all things
[1:07:22] and I will be his God
[1:07:26] and he shall be
[1:07:27] my son
[1:07:31] in First Corinthians chapter 9 and verse
[1:07:34] 24
[1:07:36] and Paul is writing about running this
[1:07:39] race
[1:07:41] know you not that they which run in a
[1:07:45] race run off
[1:07:48] but one receiveth the price so run
[1:07:51] that you may obtain
[1:07:54] Paul is the first church age messenger
[1:07:57] giving charge
[1:07:59] to every age
[1:08:03] even this one even you tonight
[1:08:07] every man that strived it for the
[1:08:09] Mastery is tempering in all things
[1:08:12] now they do it
[1:08:14] to obtain a corruptable crown but we an
[1:08:18] incorruptible
[1:08:19] I therefore so run not as uncertainly so
[1:08:23] fight I not as one that beta the out but
[1:08:26] I
[1:08:27] but I keep under my body and bring it
[1:08:32] into subjection
[1:08:34] lest by any means when I have preached
[1:08:37] to others I myself
[1:08:41] should be a Castaway
[1:08:44] let me just say this to you there's
[1:08:46] nothing in this life
[1:08:48] worth getting hung up for
[1:08:54] there's not a house there's not a job
[1:08:57] there's not a relationship there's not a
[1:09:01] marriage
[1:09:02] [Applause]
[1:09:04] there's not an offer from the Devil
[1:09:10] there's not a hurt feeling
[1:09:13] there's not an ounce of Pride are you
[1:09:15] with me now
[1:09:16] the Zeal of this age is to repent
[1:09:20] well brother Ron I fell I made some
[1:09:23] mistakes get up
[1:09:27] get up
[1:09:28] while there's still time to run did I
[1:09:32] just because you've Fallen get up run
[1:09:46] Paul gives us a glimpse of Hero's lives
[1:09:50] I cannot imagine the responsibility of
[1:09:52] what it was
[1:09:54] to take an inside entire life of a man
[1:09:58] and to take one
[1:10:00] or two sentences
[1:10:03] to describe his entire life
[1:10:07] but yet those people would be listed
[1:10:11] in the Overcomers
[1:10:13] that will inherit all things
[1:10:17] now in this Paul was not was not just
[1:10:21] given us a motivational speech
[1:10:25] but God was given us momentum
[1:10:32] I know you've heard this and read this a
[1:10:34] thousand times but let me just read it
[1:10:36] one more time Paul is writing
[1:10:39] in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 32
[1:10:43] what more he's already talked about
[1:10:45] Enoch he's already talked about
[1:10:47] Abel he's talked about Moses he's talked
[1:10:50] about all of those
[1:10:52] what more shall I say for the time she
[1:10:56] had failed me of of Didion
[1:10:59] and a Barack and of Samson
[1:11:03] he just mentions their name yeah
[1:11:09] and of Jeff Knight
[1:11:11] and of David
[1:11:13] and of Samuel
[1:11:15] and of the prophets
[1:11:18] now notice these next words who through
[1:11:21] faith
[1:11:23] subdued kingdoms
[1:11:26] righteousness
[1:11:28] obtained promises
[1:11:31] stop the mouths of lions quench the
[1:11:34] violence of the fire escape the edge of
[1:11:37] the sword no Hollywood here
[1:11:41] out of weaknesses who made strong wax
[1:11:44] blogging in fight turn to fight the
[1:11:46] armies of the aliens women received
[1:11:49] their dead raised the life again others
[1:11:52] were tortured
[1:11:53] not accepting Deliverance
[1:11:59] let me just say this to you
[1:12:01] maybe you've got some excuses here
[1:12:03] tonight
[1:12:04] of why you're not giving it a hundred
[1:12:06] percent
[1:12:08] why don't you tell these people
[1:12:11] if you could have a personal interview
[1:12:12] with them why you're not giving a
[1:12:14] hundred percent
[1:12:16] why why don't you have an interview with
[1:12:19] some of these people that were stretched
[1:12:21] apart that were shown asunder
[1:12:25] women were cut apart that their babies
[1:12:27] were pulled out of them why don't you
[1:12:29] talk to them
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:37] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[1:12:39] and sturgeons yeah over more over bonds
[1:12:41] of imprisonment
[1:12:43] they were stoned
[1:12:46] they were sauna sunder
[1:12:50] they were stoned read that with me they
[1:12:53] were stoned
[1:12:55] that might not mean too much to you
[1:12:58] but how many has ever heard of a man
[1:13:00] named John Wesley
[1:13:04] John Wesley was five foot one
[1:13:07] he was a red-headed man he was not
[1:13:09] accepted in any of his churches
[1:13:12] but that scripture stood out to him and
[1:13:15] if you go back and read in any of these
[1:13:18] sermons he mentions that over and over
[1:13:20] again because John Wesley was stoned
[1:13:23] repetitively
[1:13:26] he was stoned after he would get done
[1:13:29] preaching none of us
[1:13:32] we may get a Blog and we may get some
[1:13:34] hurtful text and we may get some words
[1:13:36] or somebody might meet us after church
[1:13:41] but John Wesley when he got done
[1:13:43] preaching was stoned
[1:13:45] and you can read it in his in his Daily
[1:13:48] Journal
[1:13:49] it said last night I preached and they
[1:13:52] stoned me and they piled Stones up on
[1:13:54] top of me and they left me for dead but
[1:13:57] God rich in Mercy
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:13:59] [Applause]
[1:14:01] and I shook the Rocks off of me today
[1:14:04] I'll preach eight more times
[1:14:07] God give us the energy
[1:14:18] of whom the world was not worthy they
[1:14:21] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:14:24] in dens of the caves and these all
[1:14:26] haven't obtained a good report through
[1:14:28] faith received not the promise
[1:14:32] God having provided
[1:14:37] some better thing for us
[1:14:40] that they without us
[1:14:49] should not be made perfect
[1:14:51] I'd like to say this to you you have no
[1:14:54] Stadium where somebody's cheering for
[1:14:56] you
[1:15:00] maybe you can't hear the other side
[1:15:03] but there's angels in another dimension
[1:15:07] there's a cloud of witnesses that are
[1:15:10] watching us
[1:15:12] that have went on before us
[1:15:14] sister Karen is screaming finish this

[1:15:41] your way
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:54] expensive well for seeing we are
[1:15:56] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:15:58] witnesses
[1:15:59] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:16:02] sin was just so easily beset us and let
[1:16:05] us run
[1:16:08] with patience the race that is set
[1:16:10] before us
[1:16:12] looking unto Jesus
[1:16:14] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:16:18] who for the joy
[1:16:23] that was set before him endured the
[1:16:26] cross
[1:16:27] despising the shame and it's set down at
[1:16:30] the right hand of the Throne of God
[1:16:34] these all died in faith
[1:16:37] they didn't know what God defeated
[1:16:41] and neither are we a bunch of victims
[1:16:47] but we are victorious standing here
[1:16:50] tonight
[1:16:51] Paul would say it like this I press
[1:16:54] towards the mark of the prize of the
[1:16:56] High Calling of God which is in Christ
[1:16:59] Jesus
[1:17:02] now if I could just share a couple of
[1:17:04] thoughts with us just here just for a
[1:17:06] few moments
[1:17:07] we are his subjects
[1:17:10] and we were predestinated before the
[1:17:12] foundation of the world
[1:17:14] we came from God and we're going back to
[1:17:17] God
[1:17:18] and we come to an understanding that our
[1:17:22] origin was not of man but was of God
[1:17:26] yes and God was like a great contractor
[1:17:29] when he was making the Earth he laid our
[1:17:32] bodies
[1:17:33] in the Earth
[1:17:38] now watch what's this
[1:17:40] Revelation chapter 5. he said the book
[1:17:43] he took the book with Redemption power
[1:17:45] for the for the blood that's a Trent
[1:17:48] that's a transform you from a rascal
[1:17:53] to a son of God
[1:17:55] with authority with checkbook adoption
[1:17:58] with substance of God placed inside of
[1:18:01] us
[1:18:03] the re the resort his life his own life
[1:18:08] greater than all darkness that there is
[1:18:11] there's no room
[1:18:13] no darkness in him
[1:18:18] like the attribute see it is in God an
[1:18:21] attribute is your thought God in the
[1:18:24] beginning the Eternal he wasn't even
[1:18:26] taught he was eternal he wasn't even God
[1:18:30] God is an object of worship
[1:18:35] so he wasn't even that
[1:18:38] he was Elohim he was the Eternal but in
[1:18:42] him was thoughts
[1:18:45] watch this Prophet as he just lays it
[1:18:47] out
[1:18:49] no other man never spake like that
[1:18:51] he wanted to become material
[1:18:54] what did he do then he spoke a word and
[1:18:58] the Word was materialized that's the
[1:19:00] whole picture I like God's whole picture
[1:19:04] you know what about a picture if there's
[1:19:07] 150 people in your picture
[1:19:10] who do you find
[1:19:18] you're a bunch of vain people
[1:19:27] and you'll stand there and go well my
[1:19:28] hair wasn't right
[1:19:31] I wasn't standing right
[1:19:33] I
[1:19:38] well when you look at the work
[1:19:42] when you look at the word you find
[1:19:44] yourself in the book
[1:19:55] it's good to find this one and good to
[1:19:57] find that one but when you find yourself
[1:20:01] if you ever get that anchor in your
[1:20:04] heart that's not a devil in hell can
[1:20:06] shoot you from that
[1:20:17] Elohim sitting on the throne
[1:20:21] with all of his subjects around him I
[1:20:24] want you to just notice this is what God
[1:20:26] pictured before all of this started
[1:20:29] he's sitting there with his thoughts
[1:20:33] and you was there
[1:20:34] and if you ever was there
[1:20:38] and then you came into this little
[1:20:39] hickey of time
[1:20:42] if he ever thought of you there's never
[1:20:45] a time that he unthinks of you
[1:20:54] I like that don't you
[1:20:56] he's not the kind of businessman that
[1:20:58] gets in the middle of the stream and
[1:21:00] says I I don't have enough to get him
[1:21:02] through
[1:21:05] if he ever thought of you
[1:21:11] let's just watch this
[1:21:13] he says it's like a man building
[1:21:16] chains or making chains the mortar each
[1:21:21] Bell has got to ring different
[1:21:24] from the other the same materials
[1:21:27] but so much iron so much steel so much
[1:21:30] brass to make it ring The Ting
[1:21:35] isn't that so simple
[1:21:38] Oh I thought it would be a great mystery
[1:21:44] that's the way God did
[1:21:46] he bred this one
[1:21:49] to that one
[1:21:51] to this one
[1:21:53] to that one
[1:21:55] and this one
[1:21:57] to that one are you getting the point
[1:22:00] and it got exactly what he wanted
[1:22:04] and that's how he come down God unveiled
[1:22:07] himself in a pillar of fire down through
[1:22:10] the prophets then into the son of God
[1:22:14] he which he was God
[1:22:16] see it's the same God be bringing out
[1:22:19] exactly from Perfection to Perfection
[1:22:22] from glory to glory that's the way the
[1:22:25] church does notice Through the Ages the
[1:22:28] same way by the prophets he reveals
[1:22:31] himself them wasn't exactly prophets
[1:22:34] they were gods
[1:22:37] for what they spoke was God's word they
[1:22:41] were the flesh that God was veiling in
[1:22:46] they were gods
[1:22:48] ever heard a denominational preacher
[1:22:50] used that kind of a term
[1:22:55] Jesus him set himself
[1:22:59] how can you condemn me
[1:23:02] when I say I'm the son of God
[1:23:05] and your own law says
[1:23:08] that them who the word of the Lord comes
[1:23:12] to
[1:23:12] what's God
[1:23:17] now think about this
[1:23:19] you're sitting there tonight and and the
[1:23:21] enemy was whispering your ear how
[1:23:24] worthless you are
[1:23:28] and he'll try to send you down through
[1:23:31] memory allies
[1:23:34] and maybe remind you that nobody cares
[1:23:37] or nobody loves you or you know there's
[1:23:41] so many things that are against you and
[1:23:43] all the complexes of your life
[1:23:47] but I want you to think since Adam
[1:23:52] as I expound on that quote since Adam
[1:23:56] man has courted woman
[1:24:00] not man courted man
[1:24:03] escorted woman just to get her to smile
[1:24:07] at him
[1:24:09] then to Mary then to have children
[1:24:13] that's been happening since Adam
[1:24:17] and then we're understanding in One in a
[1:24:20] Million
[1:24:21] that in every seed of life
[1:24:24] 999
[1:24:28] 000 Souls of cells die and only one is
[1:24:33] predestinated to life so all the way
[1:24:36] since Adam
[1:24:38] [Applause]
[1:24:41] God has been watching over your natural
[1:24:43] seed that's your natural sin
[1:24:48] he wanted you a certain height a certain
[1:24:51] build a certain hair color a certain a
[1:24:54] certain way in your attributes
[1:24:57] he wanted the Bell to chime just right
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:03] just so that he could come and live on
[1:25:06] the inside of you
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:19] oh
[1:25:21] brother Brandon would use some
[1:25:22] statements he said
[1:25:25] she knows
[1:25:26] what he wants done with the word
[1:25:31] he would use this term
[1:25:33] checkbook Authority
[1:25:36] that God signed it
[1:25:40] and you just have to fill it out
[1:25:44] he said he knows that if the people
[1:25:47] get the true revelation of the true
[1:25:49] church and what she is
[1:25:53] and what she stands for
[1:25:55] that she will do the Greater Works
[1:26:01] God's not going to send another
[1:26:03] messenger
[1:26:05] neither is he going to raise another
[1:26:08] Prince of preachers
[1:26:11] we're not looking to the personality of
[1:26:13] man we need preachers God Holy Ghost
[1:26:16] Field preachers
[1:26:17] [Applause]
[1:26:21] we need that but God wants to use you
[1:26:31] now we're gathered in this building and
[1:26:33] every one of us are sitting here
[1:26:35] and every one of us come from different
[1:26:36] diverse situations
[1:26:39] sister Elena your testimony has went
[1:26:41] around the world
[1:26:42] Satan attacked you
[1:26:44] tried to take your life
[1:26:46] you took the word of God and you signed
[1:26:49] a check
[1:26:51] Satan thought he had you
[1:26:55] as a matter of fact no doubt Satan said
[1:26:57] she'll be she'll be dead in just a few
[1:27:00] months
[1:27:01] he had plans to destroy the family but
[1:27:04] you took the word of God
[1:27:07] come on
[1:27:09] you took a word of God
[1:27:18] your testimony has went around the world
[1:27:22] there's just such a woman probably no
[1:27:24] doubt and I'm just gonna be kind they're
[1:27:27] such a little woman I don't know how
[1:27:28] tall she is and I have no clue what she
[1:27:31] weighs never going to get in that
[1:27:32] trouble
[1:27:34] but she has shook the kingdom of hell
[1:27:47] the reason we can do that because
[1:27:49] brother random says he conquered
[1:27:51] sickness
[1:27:52] he conquered Temptation and when the
[1:27:54] enemy spit in his face he smote his jaw
[1:27:57] and he turned to the other side when
[1:27:58] they jerked his beard from his face and
[1:28:00] spit on him he never reviled back he
[1:28:03] conquered the temptation
[1:28:06] he says have faith in God he said oh my
[1:28:09] how the devil has to recognize the
[1:28:11] supreme authority of Jesus Christ not me
[1:28:15] he hates me he don't have to mind me but
[1:28:19] he has to mind who I represent
[1:28:21] he asked the Mind who sent me here
[1:28:24] hallelujah
[1:28:27] listen to him pray Satan you bound these
[1:28:30] people you've exposed you're exposed
[1:28:32] tonight your grips are lost you have no
[1:28:35] legal Authority at all Jesus Christ
[1:28:37] robbed you
[1:28:39] and stripped you at Calvary and we
[1:28:41] become us the Church of the Living God
[1:28:44] In The Name of Jesus Christ I adore you
[1:28:47] to leave every person in the building
[1:28:49] come out of the people
[1:28:52] thou demons I jure Thee by the by the
[1:28:56] Living God live
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:29:04] he said that's the way the enemy will do
[1:29:08] if he can
[1:29:09] if he can see he's got an upper hand
[1:29:13] he will always proposition you
[1:29:18] but when he's in a corner he's a coward
[1:29:22] for the Devil is defeated he's nothing
[1:29:25] but a bluff
[1:29:27] if this Bible is the truth which it is
[1:29:30] Christ stripped him of every legal
[1:29:33] Authority that he had at Calvary and he
[1:29:36] paid the full price for sin and all of
[1:29:40] his attributes
[1:29:41] [Applause]
[1:29:46] thank you
[1:29:51] I can say this and I'll share this with
[1:29:53] you
[1:29:54] on our roughest days
[1:29:57] our lowest hours of despair
[1:30:00] even in those tone those times we're
[1:30:03] still chosen
[1:30:05] blessed
[1:30:07] favored forgiven
[1:30:10] loved let of God
[1:30:13] Victorious inheritance of all of
[1:30:16] Heaven's Glory privileged to walk with
[1:30:19] our own Creator married to the kings of
[1:30:22] kings and he calls us his beloved
[1:30:28] we're strong in faith we're armed to
[1:30:30] fight devils
[1:30:32] entrusted with God's word the most
[1:30:35] powerful weapon protected by the arm of
[1:30:37] the almighty and he has placed a hedge
[1:30:41] about us
[1:30:48] I imagine every time I read that the
[1:30:50] devil must just shiver
[1:30:57] here I stand tonight
[1:30:59] and the enemy Whispers constantly in my
[1:31:02] ear that death is in front of me
[1:31:06] but I refuse to fear
[1:31:10] because I realize to be absent from this
[1:31:12] body is to be present with the Lord
[1:31:15] so every time I step into Pulpit is
[1:31:17] another time to pull the sword and cut
[1:31:19] his head off
[1:31:33] maybe your fight is not staged for
[1:31:35] cancer
[1:31:36] but the word cancer seems to make people
[1:31:39] tremble in their shoes
[1:31:42] but once it begins to get into your body
[1:31:44] and in your lungs and in your brain the
[1:31:47] enemy Whispers in your ear
[1:31:49] but God who is rich in Mercy
[1:31:54] so every time I get an opportunity to
[1:31:56] stand in the Pulpit I may be weak I may
[1:31:59] be dizzy but I stand here
[1:32:02] and I want to challenge you
[1:32:07] if I'm not here to whine on you I'm not
[1:32:09] to lay my head on my shoulders and for
[1:32:11] you to feel sorry for me I want to
[1:32:13] challenge you
[1:32:15] let's finish this race
[1:32:32] let's finish it
[1:32:35] let's finish it you may be tired you may
[1:32:38] be wore out you may have went through a
[1:32:40] lot of things but let's finish this last
[1:32:44] finish this race
[1:32:54] foreign
[1:32:58] notice it is to him that overcometh
[1:33:01] so God sees you as an over comma
[1:33:06] God sees you I like how God sees you
[1:33:10] don't look at how you see you or
[1:33:12] somebody else sees you look at what the
[1:33:14] word says about you you are an overcomer
[1:33:17] you overcome a lot of things just to be
[1:33:20] sitting in this pew
[1:33:21] [Applause]
[1:33:22] so if you're sitting on on the other
[1:33:24] side of the internet and you've got a
[1:33:26] lot of excuses why you're not here Shake
[1:33:29] Yourself
[1:33:30] get over yourself
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:52] expect to be victorious
[1:33:58] expect Faith to pre be preached
[1:34:02] you walk into this building expect this
[1:34:05] to be the greatest service you've ever
[1:34:06] been in
[1:34:11] we don't come here to be entertained
[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:16] we're not looking for the best thing to
[1:34:18] help
[1:34:19] there's three of us preaching we're not
[1:34:21] here to compete with each other
[1:34:25] we are here to complement each other
[1:34:28] we're a team here
[1:34:32] [Applause]
[1:34:35] whether you're the Oregon player
[1:34:38] or you're sitting in the balcony every
[1:34:40] one of us are on the same team
[1:34:43] we all have the same enemy
[1:34:46] so every one of us has got to fight
[1:34:57] 15 years ago
[1:35:00] I was in a coma
[1:35:06] and
[1:35:08] I've entered into a state of being brain
[1:35:10] dead you know the story I'm not going to
[1:35:13] tell it much
[1:35:15] I'd entered into a state of being brain
[1:35:17] dead and non-responsive
[1:35:19] your pastor walked into my pulpit
[1:35:23] spoke on God's Hall of Fame
[1:35:27] and then he spoke on God will have a
[1:35:29] testimony
[1:35:33] God used him
[1:35:35] as a this may stumble some but who cares
[1:35:39] as a prophet in the pulpit
[1:35:43] projecting impossibilities
[1:35:46] [Applause]
[1:35:48] little did any of my family know that
[1:35:50] the doctors were going to harvest my
[1:35:52] organs
[1:35:54] they were already making preparations to
[1:35:56] approach my family to harvest my organs
[1:35:59] those that are in the medical field
[1:36:01] knows how all of that happens but let me
[1:36:03] just say this to you God had a plan
[1:36:06] [Applause]
[1:36:09] the last 15 years we've seen the dead
[1:36:12] raised
[1:36:13] [Applause]
[1:36:15] I'm going to go ahead and preach
[1:36:17] we've seen the dead raised we've seen a
[1:36:20] little girl come out of a wheelchair and
[1:36:22] run all over a building
[1:36:24] we've seen cancers delivered greatest of
[1:36:27] all we've seen the transformation of
[1:36:30] souls last weekend we baptized 35 people
[1:36:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:36] just last weekend
[1:36:45] you tell me oh one day the Revival is
[1:36:48] gonna happen brother on it's happening
[1:36:50] now
[1:37:02] no man is producing these things
[1:37:05] no man can produce that God himself the
[1:37:09] mighty Angel is among us even in this
[1:37:13] building
[1:37:17] he's in this building now
[1:37:23] he will not entrust this to a man to
[1:37:25] finish it so he has come himself to
[1:37:29] finish this work
[1:37:40] it is Jesus Christ in Bride form
[1:37:45] sure when looking for the corporate
[1:37:47] return of Jesus Christ but look around
[1:37:50] you you are seeing his physical
[1:37:53] attributes on the Earth right now that
[1:37:56] he thought of before the foundation of
[1:37:59] the world
[1:37:59] [Applause]
[1:38:08] what has he done to try to stop you
[1:38:12] let's just like think about that just
[1:38:14] for a minute
[1:38:16] how much energies that the enemy tries
[1:38:19] to stop you
[1:38:24] is this okay
[1:38:28] I didn't look at my clock so
[1:38:36] every one of you
[1:38:38] are a separate book
[1:38:42] every one of you
[1:38:47] every one of you are different
[1:38:51] every one of you have different things
[1:38:53] that you have to fight
[1:38:56] your fingerprints different your eye
[1:38:59] prints different even your blood is
[1:39:00] different
[1:39:05] but every one of us came out of the book
[1:39:08] of eternal life
[1:39:10] that he thought of
[1:39:13] and God had confidence
[1:39:15] not in your flesh
[1:39:20] because you came through the hybrid of
[1:39:22] man
[1:39:23] the Fallen flesh of of this dirt
[1:39:27] but he placed something on the inside of
[1:39:30] you
[1:39:31] that Eternal Gene seed of God that may
[1:39:35] have laid their dormant for decades but
[1:39:37] one day God rich in Mercy that seed came
[1:39:41] to life
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:45] and you could have been raised in the
[1:39:47] worst home in the world but God ignited
[1:39:51] that sin
[1:40:01] okay
[1:40:04] the woman at the well
[1:40:12] and Jesus goes to her
[1:40:17] and he even sends his disciples away
[1:40:19] because they'll be judgmental
[1:40:29] and he goes to her
[1:40:32] and he spends an afternoon with her
[1:40:35] huh
[1:40:36] of all of his busy schedule he goes and
[1:40:39] gets one
[1:40:42] but one turns into thousands
[1:40:44] [Music]
[1:40:50] One turns into thousands
[1:40:54] go ahead and stand up Joshua
[1:40:56] Joshua

[1:41:26] a seed
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:34] I feel ten thousand votes up here on
[1:41:36] this stage

[1:43:17] standing in your kitchen
[1:43:31] God don't care for me you can't see the
[1:43:34] other Realm
[1:43:36] oh
[1:43:44] amram and Joseph bed
[1:43:47] were praying for it was a season of
[1:43:49] Deliverance
[1:43:52] they knew that the the messenger had to
[1:43:55] come
[1:43:56] it was a time for Rapture I'm sorry
[1:43:59] Exodus
[1:44:04] and we're praying
[1:44:06] and he was up in the attic
[1:44:09] and he was praying
[1:44:10] and an angel came
[1:44:14] he met him
[1:44:18] he went back to work the next day
[1:44:21] just like always
[1:44:23] but he knew that he knew that he knew
[1:44:25] that he knew he met an angel
[1:44:29] and he and his wife had a child
[1:44:31] they had other children but this child
[1:44:33] was a special child
[1:44:35] there's a decree that was going out
[1:44:37] about the season of the time of the
[1:44:39] deliverer to come on the scene so male
[1:44:41] children would be killed
[1:44:43] God's always God's always had to fight
[1:44:46] with Satan because Satan's always trying
[1:44:48] to destroy the young seed
[1:44:51] that's why he's trying to destroy you
[1:44:53] young people with every bombardment of
[1:44:56] every every Marketplace of hell every
[1:45:00] internet of Hell he's trying to bomb
[1:45:02] your mind with unbelief but if you can
[1:45:05] ever realize who you are
[1:45:10] the baby came
[1:45:12] and God asked
[1:45:15] them to do something that was beyond
[1:45:19] even thoughts
[1:45:22] take this baby that the angel said that
[1:45:25] you would have
[1:45:26] and put it in a certain
[1:45:29] type of made bushel
[1:45:33] and put it in a crocodile infested water
[1:45:36] listen to The Prophet how he how he
[1:45:39] tells it you don't find us in the
[1:45:40] scripture but listen at the seeing
[1:45:43] Prophet as he looks at how it would take
[1:45:45] place
[1:45:46] he's saying something about the
[1:45:48] protected seed that you are
[1:45:51] he said put him in that crocodile
[1:45:53] infested water and he said Gabriel
[1:45:59] you come and stand on this this bushel
[1:46:02] basket
[1:46:05] and line up thousands of angels Up and
[1:46:08] Down the River
[1:46:09] [Applause]
[1:46:11] and and when a crocodile comes up
[1:46:13] against him you you take your your foot
[1:46:16] and push him back down him
[1:46:18] and when it gets to a Whirlpool
[1:46:20] Whirlpool of life you see that it gets
[1:46:23] out that's how God does you
[1:46:27] maybe you can't see the angels that are
[1:46:30] protecting you
[1:46:37] he kept you from that car wreck he kept
[1:46:40] you from that drug addiction he kept me
[1:46:43] from that porn habit he kept you out of
[1:46:46] all that trouble it was angels that were
[1:46:50] standing guarding
[1:46:53] foreign
[1:47:08] Glory Glory
[1:47:24] and he said I'll be standing at the end
[1:47:26] they're waiting on him
[1:47:28] when he arrives
[1:47:45] I don't know how it's all going to be
[1:47:47] written in my life
[1:47:48] but all I know is whether it's by the
[1:47:51] body change
[1:47:53] or by that other way
[1:47:55] he's going to be standing there
[1:47:58] about it
[1:48:07] sister Rachel
[1:48:09] and I don't want no regrets

[1:57:24] goal in mind
[1:57:26] to finish it

[1:57:31] our legs would get tired and our our
[1:57:34] lungs would feel like it was going to
[1:57:35] blow out of our chest but we had one
[1:57:38] goal in mind
[1:57:40] not just to turn the corner
[1:57:43] but at the end of that turn we would
[1:57:45] begin to kick
[1:57:48] and our legs would begin to kick and we
[1:57:50] try to raise our legs higher and we
[1:57:53] would finish
