[35:38] there's so many wonderful things that we
[35:39] can find in it and I just pray that
[35:41] he'll open our eyes tonight to to some
[35:44] things verse 7 says unto the angel of
[35:46] the church in Philadelphia write these
[35:49] things saith he that is Holy he that is
[35:52] true he that hath the Key of David he
[35:55] that openeth and no man shutteth and
[35:57] shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy
[36:00] Works behold I have set before thee an
[36:02] open door and no man can shut it for
[36:05] thou Hast a little strength and has kept
[36:07] my word and has not denied my name
[36:10] behold I will make them of the synagogue
[36:12] of Satan which say they are Jews and are
[36:15] not but do lie behold I will make them
[36:17] to come and worship before thy
[36:22] feet and to know that I have loved thee
[36:25] verse 10 because thou has kept the word
[36:27] of my patience I also will keep thee
[36:30] from the hour of Temptation which shall
[36:32] come upon all the world to try them that
[36:35] dwell upon the Earth behold I come
[36:37] quickly hold that fast which thou Hast
[36:40] that no man take thy crown him that
[36:43] overcometh will I make a pillar in the
[36:46] temple of my God and he shall go no more
[36:49] out and I will write upon him the name
[36:51] of my God in the name of the city of my
[36:53] God which is New Jerusalem which cometh
[36:56] down out of heaven from God and I will
[36:58] write upon him my name my new name he
[37:02] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[37:04] spirit saith unto the churches amen you
[37:07] can have your seats tonight aren't you
[37:09] thankful that the Lord has anointed us
[37:12] and given us ears to hear in this day
[37:14] you know it just seems so simple he that
[37:16] hath an ear we know that doesn't mean
[37:18] physically because everybody has ears
[37:20] everybody physically can hear but but
[37:22] because that the Lord has anointed our
[37:24] ears and because he sent a prophet in
[37:26] this day let's just be honest to to
[37:28] break these things down it's allowed us
[37:30] to see and to understand what what's
[37:33] going on in our day and one thing that
[37:35] we have found as as we've studied that
[37:37] that's very important not just to this
[37:39] study of the church ages but just to
[37:41] study the Bible in general is the
[37:44] unchanging character of God brother
[37:47] brandom says it is the Revelation that
[37:50] God never changes and he he said this
[37:52] was the key to his whole study this is
[37:54] how he knew who the messengers were this
[37:56] is this is how he um got into this to to
[38:00] the church ages and understood things he
[38:01] said it was the whole key the Revelation
[38:04] that God never changes and that his ways
[38:06] are as
[38:07] unchangeable as he is amen the very the
[38:11] very um uh I wouldn't say theme the very
[38:14] theme of the message was Hebrews 138
[38:17] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[38:21] and forever brother Brandon would would
[38:23] take this and say not even necessarily
[38:25] referencing the church ages but but he
[38:27] would say that it is the Keystone of the
[38:30] whole Bible he the Keystone of the whole
[38:33] Bible is that Jesus Christ is the same
[38:35] yesterday today and forever and I'm
[38:38] thankful tonight that our God doesn't
[38:39] change I'm thankful that what he says
[38:42] stands and what he think stands and and
[38:44] whatever thought he had of you it still
[38:47] stands in the eternals when he saw you
[38:49] as a son tonight he still thinks of you
[38:51] as a son and you may say well I've had
[38:53] these failures and I've had these ups
[38:55] and downs and I've had these the the
[38:57] these struggles his thoughts of you can
[39:00] not change you you are a part of God
[39:02] you're an attribute of God and so he
[39:05] still looks at you tonight as son he
[39:07] looks at you tonight as daughter now if
[39:09] you're in a backsliding condition he's
[39:10] not going to leave you there he's not
[39:12] going to let you get by with it but he's
[39:14] also not going to change what he thinks
[39:16] about you amen I'm thankful that what he
[39:18] says stands he isn't like a man who can
[39:22] change his mind and one day you're this
[39:24] and your buddies and the next day he's
[39:26] mad at you and and you're cut off but
[39:28] but tonight you have an open door to God
[39:30] you you have the ability to to have a
[39:33] relationship with God because he's open
[39:35] that door amen his word is sure and we
[39:38] can rejoice in that tonight amen so
[39:41] tonight we're going we're going to look
[39:43] at the the city of
[39:45] Philadelphia and the age that that City
[39:48] represents and brother brand would say
[39:50] these seven churches located in Asia
[39:52] Minor contain certain characteristics
[39:55] within them and at that ancient date so
[39:58] he's looking back to the city and they
[40:00] had these characteristics at that
[40:02] ancient date which became mature fruit
[40:04] in later ages amen amen so as we look at
[40:08] this each City had characteristics about
[40:10] them and maybe they were little small
[40:12] things things that it took a prophet to
[40:14] recognize little small things maybe
[40:17] things that that we would never notice
[40:18] and those characteristics were like
[40:20] seeds and then they were there in that
[40:23] City and they would become manifest in
[40:25] an age to come years later so so one
[40:28] thing I want us to stay focused on
[40:30] tonight is we may talk about a city but
[40:33] it only represents the age that we're
[40:36] studying amen but the prophet could look
[40:38] back in there and see it talking about
[40:40] this city and go but it's going to
[40:41] represent a period of time way down the
[40:45] road amen so we've we've come to we've
[40:48] studied five of the churches and tonight
[40:50] we come to Philadelphia and you can see
[40:53] it right there on the right hand side in
[40:55] between Sardis and Le oosa
[40:57] it was the sixth age it lasted from 1750
[41:01] to
[41:02] 1906 and it's known as the age of
[41:05] Brotherly Love and and as brother
[41:07] brandham teaches on on the Philadelphian
[41:10] age he spends a bit of time at the
[41:12] beginning making sure that we understand
[41:14] even though I have dates up there he he
[41:17] makes sure that we understand that the
[41:18] ages blend there is no exact this age
[41:21] ended on this day and this age started
[41:24] on this day but the ages overlap and he
[41:27] talks about that a lot during this study
[41:29] and he says there's an overlapping of
[41:31] the ages and and he begins to show as
[41:34] these ages overlap he also begins to
[41:36] talk about the rep repetition of the
[41:39] false Vine in each age in other words as
[41:43] the religions and the false doctrines
[41:45] that begin way back at the earliest ages
[41:48] he shows that they continue on age after
[41:51] age after age because remember Spirits
[41:54] don't
[41:55] die spirits don't die then they don't
[41:58] they don't go away so so maybe it had a
[42:00] new name attached to it maybe it came
[42:03] with with a little different way and and
[42:05] attacked in a different side and it
[42:07] disguised itself differently but it's
[42:09] the same devil in every age the same
[42:11] devil that come against Adam and Eve is
[42:13] the same devil coming against you in
[42:15] this day amen that those Spirits never
[42:18] die you can Trail him from Genesis all
[42:22] the way to Revelation and as it relates
[42:24] to the church ages you can find him
[42:26] right there in Ephesus
[42:27] and you can find him coming down
[42:29] attacking the True Vine all the way down
[42:31] to the age of Leo deia amen so we're
[42:35] talking about the city of Philadelphia
[42:37] and it was built in a famous wine
[42:40] growing District second largest city in
[42:42] ancient Lydia suffered frequent
[42:45] earthquakes and yet it was the longest
[42:48] lasting city of all the Seven Cities of
[42:50] Revelation as a matter of fact it still
[42:52] stands today under a different name that
[42:55] I can't pronounce so I didn't even put
[42:57] up there but it's still standing to to
[43:00] this day Philadelphia is still there and
[43:03] and interesting enough brother brandham
[43:06] takes and he begins to talk about the
[43:08] coins of the city and I found this very
[43:11] interesting he begins to talk about the
[43:13] coins and he says the mage of the coins
[43:16] suggests the deity of the city to be
[43:19] bakas he says now bakas is the same as
[43:23] nenus or Nimrod now if you were remember
[43:27] in the last age that we talked about
[43:29] Sardis and Sardis worship Cil and I'm
[43:32] just going to lay this out for just a
[43:34] second and that City Sardis was used to
[43:37] represent that age because the
[43:40] characteristic of that age was the
[43:42] worship of the Jezebel system okay so
[43:45] they worshiped cibil and it was used to
[43:48] represent that age because they were
[43:49] going to worship The Jezebel system and
[43:52] we saw Martin Luther begin to protest in
[43:54] the last age and he began to break fre
[43:57] fre or break off from the Catholic
[43:58] church and one thing we know in the
[44:00] scripture called it out and and it held
[44:02] it against him is they didn't break
[44:04] completely free from the Catholic Church
[44:07] they didn't come all the way out even
[44:09] though they they protested there was too
[44:11] many Catholic Traditions that was
[44:13] carried right on over into protestantism
[44:16] amen and so they didn't break free but
[44:19] but but but they were getting loose just
[44:21] a little bit they they they just didn't
[44:23] go all the way back to the original they
[44:25] didn't go all the way back listen Church
[44:28] we've come a long way but we can't stop
[44:30] short of going all the way back to the
[44:32] original We Can't Stop I'm thankful for
[44:34] how far we've come and and and but we
[44:36] didn't get called out just to be called
[44:38] out the same message that calls you out
[44:41] takes you in amen there was a lot of
[44:43] people in the days of of Moses that came
[44:45] out under a pillar of fire there was a
[44:48] lot of people that left Egypt that never
[44:50] made it to a promise land they they
[44:51] ended up stuck in the wilderness they
[44:53] end up grumbling they end up complaining
[44:55] they saw the Miracles but they didn't go
[44:58] all the way church we got to be willing
[45:00] to go all the way tonight don't stop
[45:03] short of all the way back to where this
[45:05] message was taking us
[45:07] amen but Luther they were breaking free
[45:10] but they weren't going all the way back
[45:12] to the original word they were being
[45:14] snared by the spirit of
[45:17] organization that they became the
[45:19] daughters of that system and and they
[45:21] are so much like the mother church that
[45:23] the Bible refers to those Church systems
[45:26] as Harless
[45:28] well Justice Jezebel we studied it
[45:31] before Justice Jezebel had a daughter
[45:33] named aalia who carried on just like her
[45:36] mother now the Catholic church had
[45:38] daughters and they were churches with
[45:40] new names they were just like Mama but
[45:43] they had new names and brother brandom
[45:45] says this about the coins he says what
[45:48] illumination this brings to our minds he
[45:51] said here is a coin and these coins had
[45:53] bakas on one side and the mother on the
[45:55] other he said here a coin with the God
[45:58] on one side and the Priestess or
[46:00] propheus on the other he says Now flip a
[46:02] coin does it matter which way it comes
[46:05] down no sir it's still the same coin
[46:09] that is the Roman religion of Jesus and
[46:13] Mary so if we trace this back we know
[46:16] that bakas was the same as Nimrod and if
[46:18] we remember Nimrod was the one who
[46:21] started the mother son or the mother God
[46:24] worship to begin with amen and so what I
[46:27] love talking about trailing this all the
[46:28] way down Through the Ages once again we
[46:31] can see the roots of that Catholic
[46:33] Church tied right back into Nimrod you
[46:36] can see the roots of it tied right back
[46:38] in to Pagan worship listen there's
[46:40] nothing Christian about it it's Pagan
[46:43] from the core it's Pagan at its roots
[46:46] you can trace it all the way back to
[46:48] Nimrod brother Bram says and now at this
[46:50] point in this age he says we're not
[46:53] thinking about Rome only no there's not
[46:55] only the great heart charlot certainly
[46:57] not for she by her fornication has
[47:00] become a mother her daughters are now
[47:04] coins of the same
[47:06] minage think about they make a mint and
[47:09] then every coin that comes through there
[47:11] is exactly the same they come out
[47:13] exactly the same listen I'm so thankful
[47:16] tonight we heard a call that said come
[47:18] out of her my people we're not mened
[47:20] like that system we're not mened like
[47:22] that church but we're mened all we're
[47:23] mened like our father we're we're copies
[47:26] of our father were're Sons and Daughters
[47:28] of the king we're we're called chosen
[47:30] bought with the price filled with the
[47:32] spirit of God tonight we're minted Sons
[47:35] and Daughters of God tonight amen we've
[47:39] returned to the homeland of the original
[47:41] word hallelujah I'm so thankful that
[47:44] we're not carbon copies said come out of
[47:47] her that you be not partakers of her
[47:49] plagues amen so during this age we know
[47:54] that the messenger was John Wesley I
[47:57] love how brother brandham says this he
[47:59] says the messenger to this age was
[48:02] without doubt John
[48:04] Wesley and I just that just struck me
[48:07] just the without doubt part how awesome
[48:09] is it tonight to be beli in what you
[48:11] believe without doubt we had a prophet
[48:14] coming this day and he said you know I
[48:16] maybe I look at it and there was a lot
[48:18] it could be he said no without doubt
[48:20] it's John Wesley I'm telling you we got
[48:22] a message tonight we can believe without
[48:24] doubt without doubt there's going to be
[48:26] a body change without doubt there's
[48:28] going to be a Rapture without doubt he
[48:30] still heals without doubt he still fills
[48:32] with the spirit without doubt we serve a
[48:35] living God tonight we can stand firm
[48:37] tonight without doubt heyen you don't
[48:41] you don't have to question it you don't
[48:42] have to worry about it tonight we have
[48:44] something we can believe without
[48:48] doubt he says the messenger John
[48:51] Wesley John Wesley is an incredible
[48:54] person from a historical standpoint
[48:56] point I could have just stood up here
[48:57] and talked about him all night but I
[49:00] just pulled some things that were
[49:01] intriguing to me and hopefully you find
[49:03] it interesting as well he lived to the
[49:07] age somewhere between 87 and 88 it's not
[49:10] exactly exactly clear but he was one of
[49:14] 19 children rode
[49:17] 4,500 miles a year on
[49:21] Horseback in his lifetime he preached
[49:23] more than
[49:25] 40,000 sermons
[49:28] I read that and I think I'm like at
[49:32] 108 I'm not going to get there and I'm
[49:35] not going to do it on a
[49:37] horse
[49:39] 40,000
[49:42] sermons I just found this interesting
[49:44] there's nothing spiritual about this he
[49:45] coined the phrase agree to
[49:49] disagree and I loved it because it said
[49:51] the reason why is so many of his
[49:53] brothers now remember this the age of
[49:55] Brotherly Love so so many of people he
[49:57] called Brothers disagreed with him so
[50:01] many of them would come and come at him
[50:04] and argue and debate and he instead of
[50:07] of making it something ugly and letting
[50:09] it tear him apart he came up with the
[50:11] term we're just going to agree to
[50:12] disagree because he wanted to remain in
[50:15] Fellowship he didn't want to allow
[50:16] disagreements to tear him apart and he
[50:19] came up with agree to disagree and I
[50:21] love that in the age of Brotherly Love
[50:23] he he was going to let his Brotherly
[50:24] Love show forth and not be well you
[50:26] disagree with me we can't Fellowship we
[50:28] don't see it the same listen we're
[50:30] grown-ups we got to be able to see
[50:32] things different and love one another we
[50:34] got to be able to see things different
[50:35] and say let's just agree to
[50:38] disagree in his lifetime he rode
[50:42] 250,000 miles on a horse let me put that
[50:46] in perspective that would take him
[50:48] around the globe 10
[50:51] times he had a god of Works strict set
[50:54] of rules that that he belied believe
[50:56] should and things that should not be
[50:59] done they were called Methods hence the
[51:02] name
[51:04] Methodist that was actually a derogatory
[51:06] term used against him early in then his
[51:09] ministry it was they were methodists and
[51:11] it was something they threw at him in an
[51:13] ugly way he was ostracized by his
[51:16] colleagues and his students at Oxford he
[51:19] was banned by Churches so he preached in
[51:22] the
[51:22] fields he was attacked by rioter many
[51:26] times who tried to kill him mobs would
[51:28] often burst into his meetings and attack
[51:30] him with clubs and Stones he had large
[51:33] chunks of his hair pulled out while he
[51:35] tried to preach the gospel he was
[51:38] attacked by a bull that was
[51:40] intentionally released into his
[51:45] meetings I'm at 108 and if that
[51:50] [Music]
[51:52] happens we can't have no bull coming in
[51:54] the church
[51:56] can you imagine sometimes we take for
[51:59] granted we talk about how easy we have
[52:01] it there's not people coming in here
[52:03] with clubs and stones and turning Bulls
[52:05] loose in the back door but listen to
[52:08] what he says this is amazing to me all
[52:10] that happened and he says of himself
[52:13] that he could not remember to have felt
[52:16] lowness of spirit for even a quarter of
[52:19] an hour that's 15 minutes since he was
[52:22] born
[52:27] the way you
[52:29] feel I'm going to say this and I
[52:31] understand it's a blanket statement
[52:32] don't get me wrong we have bad days we
[52:34] have but you have a
[52:36] choice you have a choice if you want to
[52:38] walk around moping you have a choice if
[52:40] you go through hardships with your head
[52:42] held high he couldn't remember feeling
[52:45] lowness of spirit for 15 minutes since
[52:48] he was born he slept no more than six
[52:51] hours a day arose in time to start
[52:53] preaching at 5:
[52:58] all right first of all I'm not going to
[52:59] be here to preach at 5 Sunday but if I
[53:02] was I wonder how many of y'all would be
[53:04] here with
[53:05] me yeah don't lie we're in
[53:10] church come on that's right start
[53:13] preaching at 5: every day of his
[53:17] ministry preached up to four times a day

[53:24] sermons I say Lord give give us more
[53:27] Zeal Lord give us more Fire Lord give us
[53:30] more Drive we're right here at the
[53:32] Crossing of the Finish Line we've been

[53:37] anybody's everever had before and we got
[53:39] people in the past ages that have really

[53:46] me have more fire help me be willing to
[53:48] go wherever you want me to go and do
[53:50] whatever you want me to do and not get
[53:52] lowly in spirit and not get put out and
[53:54] put down we're going to have
[53:55] disagreements we're we're going to have
[53:56] rough days we're going to have bad days
[53:59] but I'm saved by the blood of Jesus
[54:01] Christ I'm called and chosen I got a
[54:03] body change coming I got a Rapture
[54:05] coming my children are going to be there
[54:07] my family's going to be saved I got so
[54:09] many promises the seals have been opened
[54:12] what do I have to be lowly about
[54:16] Hallelujah we are without excuse with
[54:20] everything that the Lord has given us in
[54:22] this day and if you look at the
[54:24] scripture trials and tribulations and
[54:26] attacks aren't even an excuse for us to
[54:29] have a bad
[54:30] attitude or a low attitude or a down
[54:33] attitude they're not an excuse for woe
[54:36] is
[54:37] me James 1:2 my brethren count it all
[54:45] depressing count it all joy yeah when
[54:48] you fall into diverse Temptations I goes
[54:50] that's counterintuitive to the human
[54:52] mind that don't make no sense well
[54:55] that's because we're looking at it
[54:56] through human eyes but he explains why
[55:00] knowing that the trying of your faith
[55:02] worketh patience John 16:33 these things
[55:06] I have spoken unto you that in me you
[55:09] might have peace in the world you shall
[55:11] have
[55:13] tribulations but be of good
[55:15] cheer you're going to have troubles but
[55:18] be of good cheer look John Wesley lived
[55:21] these verses and God used him mightily
[55:25] despite the oppos position despite the
[55:27] attacks the work went on and it was a
[55:31] mighty work the spirit of God was
[55:33] manifested the the sick were prayed for
[55:35] with Incredible results listen listen
[55:38] laying hands on the sick and they shall
[55:39] recover that's worked ever since the day
[55:42] it was spoken and it hadn't quit working
[55:44] in this day I'm telling you it's not
[55:46] time to back off our promises it's not
[55:48] time to back off the word it's not time
[55:50] to expect to see less of the power of
[55:52] God listen we're coming up on the day
[55:54] where I got to have faith for this body
[55:57] to change back into a young man for an
[55:59] entire sweep to come over and there the
[56:01] greatest Divine Healing that's ever
[56:04] taken place is the change of the body of
[56:07] the Bride of Jesus Christ worldwide and
[56:09] you think it's going to get less and
[56:10] less no no no no it's going to get more
[56:13] and more and more and more and it's
[56:15] going to build up to that day when each
[56:17] and every one of us receive the greatest
[56:19] Divine Healing that's ever taken place
[56:22] on the face of the Earth I'm looking for
[56:24] more of God more power more healing more
[56:27] Deliverance more than I've ever seen
[56:30] before he is Jesus Christ the same
[56:32] yesterday today and forever so I say if
[56:36] it work then it'll work today and it's
[56:39] also going to work for you tomorrow
[56:41] what's the key to the whole thing he
[56:43] doesn't change if he did it one way
[56:46] brother Brown said he's obligated to
[56:48] continue doing it the same way if he
[56:51] ever was he still is if he ever was he
[56:55] still is my children are lost if he ever
[56:57] was a savior he still is well there's
[57:00] sickness in my home if he ever was a
[57:02] Healer he still is I'm bound tonight
[57:05] with anxiety if he ever was a deliverer
[57:08] he still is tonight
[57:12] Hallelujah that's why he says if the
[57:14] vine puts forth another Branch it'll
[57:17] write another book of Acts because it's
[57:20] going to do the same things
[57:24] amen it's the pattern
[57:27] it's the pattern he makes it very clear
[57:28] in the church age book he says the true
[57:31] church will always try to be like the
[57:35] original at Pentecost the true church of
[57:39] today will try to
[57:42] approximate the first one my so I'm just
[57:46] saying if you're not there if we're not
[57:48] there that don't give us an excuse to
[57:51] not be trying to be he said the true
[57:53] church will always try to be
[57:56] exactly like that first church
[58:00] was the
[58:03] salutation we read this we're going to
[58:04] read it again and we'll probably be in
[58:06] this verse the rest of the evening says
[58:09] unto the angel of the church in
[58:11] Philadelphia write these things saith he
[58:14] that is
[58:15] Holy he that is true and he that hath
[58:19] the Key of David he that openeth and no
[58:22] man shutteth and shutteth and no man
[58:26] open it what an incredible description
[58:28] of our Lord
[58:30] Jesus he's holy he's true he has the Key
[58:33] of David he opens it no man shutteth he
[58:36] shutteth and no man open I'm I'm going
[58:39] to look here at the first part that says
[58:42] he that is
[58:44] Holy I want to look at that what is
[58:47] Holiness you know I think sometimes we
[58:48] have different ideas of you know that
[58:50] that sister she's a really she's really
[58:52] holy or that brother he he has a really
[58:54] holy life and and those are proper ways
[58:56] to use that word for sure but where does
[58:58] the Holiness come
[59:00] from what is it that we're judging as
[59:03] holy because if we don't know a person
[59:06] maybe we're judging by their outward
[59:08] appearance things of that nature maybe
[59:11] conversations you've had you can pick up
[59:12] real quick I'll say this you can pick up
[59:14] real quick if somebody's not
[59:16] holy you can pick that up real quick but
[59:20] what is Holiness because Wesley himself
[59:24] he lived a very clean life he lived what
[59:27] we would call a holy life a life of
[59:29] sacrifice a life of
[59:31] self-denial and yet he goes to America
[59:34] on a mission trip and it's a complete
[59:37] failure it's a complete failure and on
[59:39] the way back he makes this statement or
[59:41] when he gets back he says I went to
[59:43] America to convert the
[59:45] Indians he says but oh who shall convert
[59:50] me because he began to realize that all
[59:53] the rules he was following all the meth
[59:56] methods he was following all the
[59:58] Holiness that he could put
[1:00:00] on and there was no God there it
[1:00:04] actually angered his brother when he
[1:00:05] started telling his brother Charles I
[1:00:07] got to get saved his brother it upset
[1:00:10] him because he's like he knew the life
[1:00:11] he lived he's like if this isn't saved
[1:00:14] then what
[1:00:17] is but could that not have we said the
[1:00:20] same thing about the Pharisees if that
[1:00:22] isn't
[1:00:23] holy then they dressed perfect they
[1:00:25] follow the law perfect but the problem
[1:00:27] is they were doing
[1:00:30] it Wesley was doing it it was him that
[1:00:34] was doing it see he began to realize
[1:00:36] there was no Holiness in his works there
[1:00:39] was no Holiness in his
[1:00:41] self-denial but then he got the
[1:00:44] Revelation that it wasn't in the dos and
[1:00:46] the don'ts it wasn't in the rules and
[1:00:48] the regulations although don't don't get
[1:00:51] it twisted we believe in In Living a a a
[1:00:54] clean life according to the word of God
[1:00:56] Amen we we believe in that but true
[1:00:59] sanctification is a work of
[1:01:02] Grace and once he came to that
[1:01:05] realization then brother Brown says he
[1:01:07] was born again then he was truly saved
[1:01:10] brother Brown says what did the Lutheran
[1:01:12] do after the death of Luther that they
[1:01:14] met Satan and they made a denomination
[1:01:16] out of it and they died she never done
[1:01:18] anything else after that she was done he
[1:01:21] says but then God picked her up again in
[1:01:24] the days of John Wesley with with
[1:01:26] another truth to reflect what did he do
[1:01:29] he said sanctification is the second
[1:01:32] work of Grace and what did God do he
[1:01:36] blessed it see
[1:01:39] Holiness is of the Lord there's nothing
[1:01:42] you can do tonight that's
[1:01:44] holy the only one that's Holiness is the
[1:01:47] Lord our only source of Holiness is the
[1:01:50] Lord listen you can you can dress to the
[1:01:53] tea you can do everything right you can
[1:01:55] walk around the most Pious person in the
[1:01:57] world and your heart full of absolute
[1:02:01] evil I've said it before you can you can
[1:02:04] live life to a perfect te and have
[1:02:07] somebody that has in your eyes standards
[1:02:10] a little lower than your own and they
[1:02:11] have the Holy Ghost and you
[1:02:14] not because it's what you're
[1:02:17] doing it's what you're putting on you
[1:02:21] can't produce Holiness yourself he is
[1:02:24] the only source of Holiness amen these
[1:02:29] things saith he that is Holy see that's
[1:02:33] where the Jews made their
[1:02:35] mistake brother brownon this is this is
[1:02:37] Brother Brown speaking the Jews did not
[1:02:38] call him holy then they do not call him
[1:02:41] holy now but he is the Holy One Psalms
[1:02:45] 16 and10 for thou will not leave my soul
[1:02:48] in Hell neither will thou suffer thine
[1:02:50] Holy One to see corruption now he's
[1:02:53] talking about the Jews they sought their
[1:02:55] their righteousness after the law and
[1:02:58] failed miserably for by the law can no
[1:03:02] flesh be justified by the law can no man
[1:03:06] be made holy Holiness is of the Lord
[1:03:10] they had all the works they had all the
[1:03:13] sacrifices And yet when the Holy One
[1:03:15] came they rejected him when the one who
[1:03:18] could truly make them holy came they
[1:03:21] turned it down it was Christ or perish
[1:03:25] and brother brand says they perished
[1:03:27] because they refused him church it's
[1:03:29] Christ or perish
[1:03:31] today it's Christ or listen in their day
[1:03:34] they found refuge in their synagogue
[1:03:36] worship and that's where they found
[1:03:38] their refuge and in the in the day of
[1:03:40] Philadelphia that they found refuge in
[1:03:42] their new big organizations and in their
[1:03:44] churches and and they joined the church
[1:03:46] and that's where they found Refuge
[1:03:47] listen don't find Refuge because you
[1:03:49] believe the message don't find Refuge
[1:03:52] cuz you go to a message Church you
[1:03:54] haven't found Refuge because you go to
[1:03:56] evening light Tabernacle there is but
[1:03:58] one place of Refuge you got to get into
[1:04:01] Jesus Christ you got to know Jesus
[1:04:04] Christ you got to let him change your
[1:04:05] life and let him change you from the
[1:04:07] inside it's a work of Grace you can sit
[1:04:10] here every service and I hope you do sit
[1:04:12] here every service but that's not it you
[1:04:15] got to let the word change you and mold
[1:04:18] you into the image of Christ
[1:04:21] amen
[1:04:23] hallelujah there's no holiness
[1:04:26] and saying I believe the
[1:04:28] message you must be born
[1:04:32] again brother Brown says it's not join a
[1:04:34] church that
[1:04:36] counts the life is not in the church the
[1:04:39] life is in Christ this is the record
[1:04:42] that God hath given to us eternal life
[1:04:45] and this life is in his son he that hath
[1:04:47] the son hath life and he that hath not
[1:04:50] the Son of God hath not life man is made
[1:04:55] holy by the
[1:04:57] spirit it is the spirit of Holiness that
[1:05:00] raised Jesus from the dead that indwells
[1:05:02] us and makes us holy with his
[1:05:06] Holiness so what is Holiness what is
[1:05:09] true sanctification it's God working in
[1:05:14] you not you working to please
[1:05:18] God God working in you not you working
[1:05:22] to please God he's the Holy One and it's
[1:05:26] it's his work in you that will produce a
[1:05:29] true
[1:05:30] sanctification a true
[1:05:34] sanctification brother brand says oh I'm
[1:05:36] so glad that my Holiness is not of
[1:05:39] myself oh thank you Jesus I'd be in a
[1:05:42] bad place tonight I'd be in a bad place
[1:05:45] tonight he says I'm glad that I'm in
[1:05:47] Christ and with all his wonderful
[1:05:49] attributes of righteousness imputed yay
[1:05:51] imparted unto me blessed be God forever
[1:05:56] I'm thankful tonight that it's all in
[1:05:58] him aren't you
[1:06:01] amen the next part of Revelation 37 that
[1:06:04] we read said he that is true and as I
[1:06:08] studied this it was a huge Enlightenment
[1:06:10] to
[1:06:11] me because I looked at it as true versus
[1:06:15] false he's true because he's not false
[1:06:18] he's not a liar he tells the truth and
[1:06:20] there's nothing wrong with seeing it
[1:06:21] that way but brother Brown says that's
[1:06:23] not what this word means he says
[1:06:26] here these things saith he that is true
[1:06:30] now this word true is a very wonderful
[1:06:34] word it does not mean true in just the
[1:06:37] sense that is opposite to false it
[1:06:40] expresses the perfect
[1:06:42] realization of an idea as contrasted
[1:06:46] with its partial realization now we'll
[1:06:49] go into it a little deeper but just so
[1:06:52] so you instantly know where we're at all
[1:06:55] the scriptures of the Old Testament
[1:06:57] being
[1:06:58] partial when he came he was the fullness
[1:07:02] of all that so he was truth he was all
[1:07:05] of it he was the perfect realization of
[1:07:08] what each one of those had in part so he
[1:07:11] is the truth he's the perfect
[1:07:13] realization of everything amen so I want
[1:07:16] you to notice these scriptures here as
[1:07:19] we look at them with that thought in
[1:07:21] mind of what the word true means because
[1:07:24] it's Jesus that is true or Jesus is the
[1:07:27] perfect realization of what was only a
[1:07:31] partial type look at
[1:07:33] these then Jesus said unto them verily
[1:07:36] verily I say unto you Moses gave you not
[1:07:38] that bread from heaven but my father
[1:07:41] giveth you the true bread from
[1:07:45] Heaven bread that you won't hunger again
[1:07:48] because this is true bread that was
[1:07:50] partial this is true this is the perfect
[1:07:53] realization of what he was trying to
[1:07:55] tell you back there I am the True Vine
[1:08:00] and my father is the husbandman 1 John
[1:08:02] 2:8 again a new commandment I write unto
[1:08:04] you which thing is true in him and in
[1:08:07] you because the darkness is pass and the
[1:08:10] True Light now shineth so I want to go
[1:08:15] back to what I just made comment on
[1:08:16] we'll look at Mana for just a second
[1:08:19] Mana was Angels food sent down from
[1:08:21] heaven but it didn't actually satisfy
[1:08:24] not not long term it was good for a day
[1:08:27] it worked for one day and if and and you
[1:08:29] got hungry again the next day that's how
[1:08:31] it tends to happen and if you left it
[1:08:33] over it would spoil and and ruin it was
[1:08:35] only good for a moment and those who ate
[1:08:37] it got hungry again he fed
[1:08:40] 5,000 with
[1:08:43] bread that mana and that bread were only
[1:08:46] partial realizations it was a partial
[1:08:49] realization of a truth that God was
[1:08:51] giving his people look I'm giving you
[1:08:53] bread but that's ain't this ain't what I
[1:08:54] want to give you I'm feeding you but
[1:08:56] this ain't really what I'm wanting to
[1:08:58] feed you this ain't what it's all about
[1:09:00] wake up and open your eyes that what I'm
[1:09:02] really wanting to give you is myself the
[1:09:04] true bread the living bread the Eternal
[1:09:07] bread that right there is only going to
[1:09:09] last a day but if you eat this bread if
[1:09:11] you drink from this water you'll never
[1:09:14] thirst again because it's the perfect
[1:09:17] realization of a partial truth it's the
[1:09:20] reality of all of it amen John 6:35 and
[1:09:25] Jesus said unto them I am the bread of
[1:09:27] life he that cometh to me shall never
[1:09:29] hunger he that believeth on me shall
[1:09:32] never thirst brother brand says but
[1:09:35] Jesus is the true bread from Heaven
[1:09:37] whereof Mana was just a type and if any
[1:09:40] man eats of that bread that came from
[1:09:42] Heaven he'll never hunger again he does
[1:09:45] not need to come back and eat again the
[1:09:47] moment he partook he had eternal life
[1:09:50] here indeed was reality no no no need
[1:09:54] any longer for a shadow need for partial
[1:09:56] salvation here is the whole of it just
[1:09:59] like Jesus isn't part of God He Is God
[1:10:03] When Jesus came there was there was no
[1:10:05] need for a shadow anymore there was no
[1:10:08] need to say when he comes he'll be like
[1:10:10] this and when he comes he'll be like
[1:10:11] that no here he was he was the perfect
[1:10:15] realization of it I'm telling you
[1:10:17] there's been a lot of scriptures that
[1:10:18] says when she comes she'll be like this
[1:10:20] and when the bride gets here she'll be
[1:10:22] like this but I'm telling you we're at
[1:10:24] the place where types and shadows aren't
[1:10:26] needed anymore because here she is the
[1:10:30] perfect realization of what was a paral
[1:10:33] truth down Through the Ages
[1:10:37] hallelujah
[1:10:39] hallelujah Israel had light if you go
[1:10:42] back in Egypt when it was Darkness
[1:10:44] everywhere who had light
[1:10:45] Israel when it was dark they had light
[1:10:48] down through the Old Testament the
[1:10:49] prophets brought light by the
[1:10:52] scriptures but when Jesus came
[1:10:55] that light had been partial brother
[1:10:57] brandham says it had been but a glowing
[1:10:59] word he said but when Jesus came the
[1:11:03] Fulfillment of the light has come and
[1:11:05] that word broke forth in the brightness
[1:11:08] of God manifested amongst his people the
[1:11:11] light was now that had been partial was
[1:11:14] now manifested in the godhead bodily he
[1:11:17] was the perfect realization he was all
[1:11:19] of it they had sacrifices that were
[1:11:21] partial they had bulls and goats that
[1:11:23] were partial once again though what was
[1:11:26] it doing it was pointing to a reality it
[1:11:29] was pointing to the real thing it it was
[1:11:31] pointing to the fact that there was a
[1:11:33] true sacrifice coming and when that
[1:11:35] sacrifice came and that blood was shed
[1:11:37] that sacrifice was like you and me so
[1:11:40] that Spirit was going to come back on
[1:11:41] the worshipper come back on the believer
[1:11:44] and it was going to break you free from
[1:11:45] the law of sin and death and you were
[1:11:47] going to walk out completely delivered
[1:11:49] saved Hallelujah set free because it
[1:11:52] wasn't a partial it was a complete
[1:11:55] realization of the true sacrifice hey
[1:11:58] man perfect life had now come and now
[1:12:02] the believer was free from the law of
[1:12:05] sin and
[1:12:06] death brother brandham says but the Jews
[1:12:08] back there in the time of Jesus did not
[1:12:10] want to accept that sacrifice the blood
[1:12:13] of wolves and goats made nothing perfect
[1:12:15] it was once God's ordained method but
[1:12:18] now Christ having appeared in the flesh
[1:12:20] and by the shedding of his own blood has
[1:12:22] put away sin and by that offering of
[1:12:24] himself has made us perfect the Jews
[1:12:27] would not take that but what about the
[1:12:30] Philadelphian age and yes other ages too
[1:12:33] did they really accept this reality in
[1:12:36] Christ no sir even though Luther brought
[1:12:40] the truth of justification the Roman
[1:12:42] Church and its eastern counterpart the
[1:12:44] Orthodox Church still clung to works now
[1:12:47] works are fine he says but they don't
[1:12:51] save
[1:12:52] you they don't make you perfect it's
[1:12:55] Christ or perish and it's not even
[1:12:58] Christ and
[1:13:00] works it's Christ
[1:13:03] Alone he says now I believe in Good
[1:13:05] Conduct see because some people can take
[1:13:07] these and say see our works don't matter
[1:13:09] that's not what he's
[1:13:10] saying he says I believe in Good Conduct
[1:13:13] if you are saved you will do
[1:13:15] righteously you will do
[1:13:18] righteously but just because you do
[1:13:20] righteously doesn't mean you're saved
[1:13:21] you
[1:13:22] see he says we have already gone gone
[1:13:25] over that but let me tell you now
[1:13:27] salvation is not Jesus plus it is Jesus
[1:13:30] alone listen guys sometimes we
[1:13:32] complicate things I thank God for the
[1:13:34] Mysteries I thank God the seals are open
[1:13:36] I believe we should preach it I believe
[1:13:38] we should teach it but every now and
[1:13:40] then it's good to just remember
[1:13:42] salvation is in Jesus alone those who
[1:13:45] believe on the Lord shall be saved look
[1:13:49] I believe in teaching people the
[1:13:50] Mysteries but let's get them to Calvary
[1:13:52] let's get them to Jesus Christ let's get
[1:13:54] them saved let's Point them once again
[1:13:56] it's not complicated just repent of your
[1:13:58] sins lay them down at the altar be
[1:14:00] washed in the blood of Jesus and you
[1:14:02] shall be saved it's
[1:14:05] simple salvation is of the Lord from
[1:14:08] start to finish it's all God let his
[1:14:11] life be in me let it be his blood that
[1:14:13] cleanses me let it be his spirit that
[1:14:15] fills me let it be his word in my heart
[1:14:17] and mouth let it be his stripes that
[1:14:19] heal me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone
[1:14:22] not by works of righteousness which I
[1:14:24] have done no sir Christ is my life
[1:14:29] amen so Jesus is he that is true he is
[1:14:35] the perfect realization of the truth
[1:14:38] that God satisfies our every need he's
[1:14:40] the perfect realization of the truth
[1:14:42] that God satisfies our every thirst and
[1:14:45] satisfies our every desire Perfection or
[1:14:49] let me say it to you even like this
[1:14:51] completion is in
[1:14:53] Christ men here of you many young people
[1:14:56] hungering and thirsting for that
[1:14:57] completion that that satisfa it's in
[1:15:00] Christ that's where you're going to find
[1:15:02] it without him we can do nothing I want
[1:15:05] to encourage you I I say this to the
[1:15:06] young people but it's not too late if
[1:15:08] you're an old person give your hopes to
[1:15:09] Jesus give your dreams to Jesus give
[1:15:12] your Ambitions to Jesus give your
[1:15:14] marriage to Jesus give everything you've
[1:15:16] got to Jesus seek ye first the kingdom
[1:15:20] of God then the rest of the stuff he's
[1:15:22] not saying that you know you can't have
[1:15:23] those things he's not saying you can't
[1:15:25] have a good job and a good home and you
[1:15:27] can't go on vacation that's not what
[1:15:28] he's saying seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:15:31] God I'll add all this other stuff to you
[1:15:33] I'll give you all this other stuff but
[1:15:35] first fall in love with Jesus make him
[1:15:38] your everything he alone can satisfy
[1:15:41] your heart's desire once you have him
[1:15:45] you have everything but if you don't
[1:15:48] have him you've got
[1:15:52] nothing the next part says that he that
[1:15:55] has the Key of David now I put both
[1:15:57] scriptures up here we've already read
[1:15:59] Revelation 3:7 but I just want you to
[1:16:01] notice how similar they are where it
[1:16:03] says these things I'm on the bottom when
[1:16:06] these things saith he that is Holy he
[1:16:07] that is true he that hath the Key of
[1:16:09] David he that openeth and no man shth
[1:16:11] and shth and no man openeth go back to
[1:16:13] Isaiah
[1:16:14] 22:22 and the key of the House of David
[1:16:17] will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall
[1:16:20] open and none shall shall shut and he
[1:16:22] shall shut and None Shall open notice
[1:16:25] how similar they are here brother Brown
[1:16:28] says this scripture has to do with our
[1:16:30] Lord after his resurrection not his
[1:16:33] Earthly pilgrimage he says but what does
[1:16:36] this key
[1:16:37] signify and I love I love this part the
[1:16:41] answer lies in the position of the key
[1:16:45] where is the key it's on his shoulder
[1:16:49] but what does his shoulder have to do
[1:16:52] with it think about who carries the key
[1:16:54] on the their
[1:16:57] shoulder for under us a child is born un
[1:17:00] us a son is given given the government
[1:17:03] shall be upon his shoulder his name
[1:17:06] Shall be Called wonderful counselor the
[1:17:07] Mighty God the Everlasting father the
[1:17:09] prince of peace and what brother Bram
[1:17:12] says here we're looking at it we're
[1:17:14] thinking politics government on his
[1:17:16] shoulder you know that's how the Jews
[1:17:18] looked at it they never recognized it as
[1:17:21] a love
[1:17:22] story they thought he was going to come
[1:17:23] overthrow the Romans and set up this
[1:17:25] Earthly government it's a love story and
[1:17:29] brother brandham takes it back to
[1:17:31] wedding ceremonies of the East and he
[1:17:34] says what it is is when the bride has
[1:17:36] committed to the groom she takes her
[1:17:38] veil off and lays it across his
[1:17:43] shoulder why it shows that he is now her
[1:17:47] head and that he if he allows her to do
[1:17:51] that he is accepting responsibility for
[1:17:54] her her he's going to care for her he's
[1:17:57] going to provide for her he's going to
[1:18:00] protect her no one else has any say in
[1:18:02] her responsibility little bride you've
[1:18:04] got a great provider little bride you've
[1:18:07] got a great protector you got one
[1:18:09] watching over your children tonight you
[1:18:11] got one watching over your home the
[1:18:12] devil's brought an attack that's okay
[1:18:14] you got a protector tonight you got one
[1:18:16] that says I'm going to heal you already
[1:18:18] I took responsibility for you I promise
[1:18:21] to watch it I know money's getting tight
[1:18:23] but I'm a provider I said i' take care
[1:18:25] of it I'm the one responsible for your
[1:18:29] needs amen thank you Lord Brother Brown
[1:18:32] says she did not choose him he called
[1:18:35] her she did not come on her own he's
[1:18:37] talking about Christ and the bride he
[1:18:39] died for her he washed her in his own
[1:18:42] blood he paid the price for her she
[1:18:44] belongs to him and to him alone she is
[1:18:46] wholly committed to him and he accepts
[1:18:49] the obligation that right there fires me
[1:18:52] up brother Aaron I got so much trouble
[1:18:54] in my life he accepts the obligation you
[1:18:56] my life falling apart he has accepted
[1:18:58] the obligation I'm torn down I've made
[1:19:01] so many Stakes mistakes I don't know
[1:19:02] where to stand he accepts the obligation
[1:19:05] tonight he says I got you I got you just
[1:19:09] trust in me don't forget whose hands is
[1:19:11] holding you
[1:19:13] tonight he is her head for Christ is the
[1:19:16] head of his church as Sarah called
[1:19:18] Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy
[1:19:21] that he is her Lord he speaks and she
[1:19:24] obeys
[1:19:25] for that is her
[1:19:29] Delight just want to drop this in here
[1:19:32] if you're in that
[1:19:33] place to where keeping the word of God
[1:19:36] is a
[1:19:38] struggle and it's a burden to
[1:19:41] you we need to find a place of
[1:19:45] repentance because doing what he asked
[1:19:48] is her
[1:19:51] Delight he says my burden my yoke is
[1:19:56] light because we love to do it because
[1:20:00] of all he did for us we love to do it
[1:20:05] now look let's be real it says when you
[1:20:08] eat up the book it's going to make your
[1:20:09] belly bitter there's things that don't
[1:20:12] always sit well and you're
[1:20:15] like that hurts a little
[1:20:17] bit that didn't feel good but we don't
[1:20:20] do it begrudgingly well I guess I have
[1:20:23] to
[1:20:26] no we love him and we know all he's done
[1:20:29] for us so we're willing Lord what
[1:20:31] whatever makes you happy Lord whatever
[1:20:33] pleases you and that's the place we got
[1:20:35] to get even in life and I thought about
[1:20:37] this a lot recently with my own self we
[1:20:39] don't want to get into a place where
[1:20:41] we're saying does God really care if I
[1:20:43] do this does God really God probably
[1:20:46] ain't G to send you to hell for it I
[1:20:48] don't even know what we're talking about
[1:20:49] they might I don't know what you're
[1:20:50] thinking about but I'm just talking
[1:20:52] about those things that you don't know
[1:20:54] you're
[1:20:55] can I get away with it why are we
[1:20:57] wondering that the question we should
[1:21:00] ask ourselves
[1:21:02] is does this please
[1:21:06] him does this please God
[1:21:11] Amen so it's Christ that has the key not
[1:21:15] a church hierarchy not a pope not a
[1:21:19] preacher nobody controls this bride he
[1:21:22] controls this bride this bride ain't
[1:21:24] going to be manhandled this bride ain't
[1:21:26] going to be put underneath a a man's
[1:21:28] thumb the devil don't have no say in
[1:21:31] this he says he's the one that opens and
[1:21:33] he's the one that shuts the devil can't
[1:21:35] put you out listen the devil keeps
[1:21:38] telling you're not going to make it
[1:21:39] you're not good enough you're not going
[1:21:39] to make it you're not good listen the
[1:21:41] devil don't get a say the devil don't
[1:21:44] have a key to his own house much less
[1:21:46] the house I'm going to he was stripped
[1:21:48] of the keys of death and hell he don't
[1:21:51] even have keys to his own house but the
[1:21:53] man who holds the key to tonight said I
[1:21:55] can come in the man who owes the key
[1:21:57] tonight said you're going to make it
[1:21:58] I've opened the door and I'm not
[1:22:00] shutting it on you come on in come on in
[1:22:03] but I'm struggling I'm holding the door
[1:22:05] open for you tonight the man who has the
[1:22:08] key said you can come in Hallelujah
[1:22:12] can't no devil keep you out can't no
[1:22:14] church keep you out can't no preacher
[1:22:16] keep you out the door is open you just
[1:22:19] got to come into the door tonight quit
[1:22:21] listening to all the other voices
[1:22:22] there's one voice tonight call call in
[1:22:24] your name and he says I open the door
[1:22:27] and I shut the door no other man can
[1:22:29] close it tonight
[1:22:32] Hallelujah Christ has the key and he's
[1:22:35] opened the door for you and no man can
[1:22:38] shut it he's accepted
[1:22:41] responsibility for your life
[1:22:43] tonight brother Bram says he bought the
[1:22:45] bride he owns her she is his and his
[1:22:48] alone he cares for her he is our King
[1:22:51] and I love this and we are his kingdom
[1:22:55] his eternal
[1:22:58] possession
[1:23:00] amen next part verse eight talks about
[1:23:04] the age of the open door and this will
[1:23:06] this will be the last section that we'll
[1:23:08] cover tonight says I Know Thy Works
[1:23:11] behold I have set before thee an Open
[1:23:13] Door no man can shut it for thou Hast a
[1:23:17] little strength and has kept my word and
[1:23:20] has not denied my name
[1:23:25] now remember at the very beginning I I
[1:23:26] said how brother Bram talks about the
[1:23:28] ages
[1:23:29] overlapping and we're not going to get
[1:23:31] much into the overlap tonight or if at
[1:23:33] all but here brother brandham really
[1:23:35] begins to to to lay in on that point as
[1:23:38] he goes into this verse and he says
[1:23:41] there is an overlapping a melting or
[1:23:43] Fading Into rather than an Abrupt end
[1:23:46] and a clearcut
[1:23:48] start he says this age particularly
[1:23:51] flows into the next age that would be
[1:23:53] our age Le Osa now listen to this not
[1:23:56] only does this age overflow into the
[1:23:58] last age but the last age is in many
[1:24:01] respects simply a carrying on of the
[1:24:06] sixth age so with that in mind there's
[1:24:09] so many things being spoken to the sixth
[1:24:11] age that we can take and apply because
[1:24:14] it's just a carrying on into the seventh
[1:24:18] age he he spends a lot of time here also
[1:24:22] focusing on the open door that no man
[1:24:24] can shut and he deals with it in sever
[1:24:27] several different ways but tonight we're
[1:24:28] only going to have time to deal with the
[1:24:29] first
[1:24:31] one and and he starts by looking at the
[1:24:33] open door as signifying the great
[1:24:37] missionary effort that went out during
[1:24:39] the Philadelphia age because Paul had
[1:24:42] spoken uh one of his missionary trips
[1:24:45] where he had the opportunity to go
[1:24:46] somewhere and and I'm off of memory
[1:24:48] can't remember it but he says a door was
[1:24:50] open unto me in other words I had the
[1:24:52] opportunity to go and Minister and and
[1:24:56] and so brother brand says this Open Door
[1:24:59] signifying the great missionary effort
[1:25:01] that went out during the Philadelphia
[1:25:03] age he says they opened up many doors
[1:25:06] during that age the door to the gospel
[1:25:08] the door to the mission Fields the door
[1:25:11] back to Christ and everything was opened
[1:25:14] up during that age and you can see what
[1:25:17] they did the Brethren done a great job
[1:25:20] out of it it was the greatest spreading
[1:25:24] of the word that the world had ever
[1:25:27] seen Luther began to open that door in
[1:25:30] the previous age but it's during this
[1:25:31] age the doors just busted wide open and
[1:25:34] men with a burden begin to take the word
[1:25:37] around the world it's the age of you've
[1:25:39] heard the term the Great Awakening it's
[1:25:42] the age of the Great Awakening men like
[1:25:44] George Whitefield Jonathan Edwards
[1:25:45] Charles finny it was it was the open
[1:25:49] door to truth and it began to spread
[1:25:50] like
[1:25:52] wildfire but brother Brown makes an
[1:25:54] interesting statement I just want to
[1:25:56] bring this down to us tonight as we
[1:25:57] begin to wind this
[1:26:00] down he says the word of the Lord now
[1:26:05] has its
[1:26:06] day he's talking about
[1:26:08] then of course the fifth age had set the
[1:26:11] stage for this Mighty move as that age
[1:26:14] gave us exploration colonization the
[1:26:18] printing of books Etc so he says the
[1:26:20] word of the Lord has had its day now I
[1:26:22] want to ask you a simple question
[1:26:24] question maybe not so simple how should
[1:26:27] the gospel be
[1:26:30] preached is there a a way no I'm not
[1:26:33] talking about a style I understand
[1:26:35] there's teachers there's people that get
[1:26:37] really really really really excited
[1:26:39] there's people that get kind of excited
[1:26:40] there there's all kind of different
[1:26:41] styles of delivery I'm not talking about
[1:26:44] a style of delivery I'm talking about
[1:26:47] what should the gospel come with what
[1:26:51] should accompany in it because he didn't
[1:26:53] say go get give
[1:26:55] lectures he was very specific about how
[1:26:58] the gospel was supposed to go forth amen
[1:27:01] well we we just need to to give them the
[1:27:03] word and we just need to tell them about
[1:27:05] Jesus and and tell them that God sent a
[1:27:08] prophet if you do those things those
[1:27:09] things are great not here to knock any
[1:27:12] of that but just
[1:27:13] notice he says for the past 150 years
[1:27:17] great missionaries like of no other time
[1:27:20] or age before has covered the entire
[1:27:23] Earth think of that
[1:27:25] every nation under the heavens has heard
[1:27:29] the word that's what the prophet said
[1:27:32] every nation has heard the word it
[1:27:36] completed many many many years ago well
[1:27:40] there's a lot of people going we got to
[1:27:41] get the word out we got to get the word
[1:27:43] out I'm not going to argue with you I'm
[1:27:46] just saying he said that was completed
[1:27:48] many many many years
[1:27:52] ago see but not the
[1:27:57] gospel wait what there's a difference
[1:28:02] absolutely because the gospel comes in
[1:28:04] power and
[1:28:07] demonstration the letter kth but the
[1:28:10] spirit giveth life see my he actually
[1:28:14] comments right here and I didn't put it
[1:28:16] in a slide he said he he he commends the
[1:28:19] age for all that they did and says but
[1:28:21] it's too bad they didn't do it according
[1:28:23] to the pattern of
[1:28:25] Pentecost where the power of God is
[1:28:28] demonstrated where the power of God is
[1:28:30] preached to the people where Mark 16 is
[1:28:32] put in action don't let that ever be
[1:28:35] said about us that that that we we give
[1:28:37] people the word but there's no power
[1:28:39] there's no gospel in it because it's
[1:28:41] supposed to be delivered like like
[1:28:43] brother brandham says Mark 16 in action
[1:28:45] is the true church he says all else is
[1:28:49] false it has to be it's a direct quote
[1:28:53] so what is 16 in action these signs
[1:28:56] shall follow them that believe they
[1:28:57] shall cast out Devils they shall speak
[1:28:59] with new tongues they shall lay hands on
[1:29:01] the sick and they shall
[1:29:03] recover what's the Bible say the Bible
[1:29:05] says and they went forth and preached
[1:29:07] everywhere the Lord working with them
[1:29:09] confirming the word with signs following
[1:29:12] amen he never said go start a program I
[1:29:15] actually have a direct quote right here
[1:29:17] from Brother Bram he never said Go pass
[1:29:19] out
[1:29:20] literature not against that he's just
[1:29:23] telling you that's not preaching the
[1:29:24] gospel that's all he's saying he's not
[1:29:26] saying those things aren't good matter
[1:29:27] of fact he makes it a point to say
[1:29:29] that's fine but that's not what he meant
[1:29:31] when he said go preach the gospel into
[1:29:33] the whole
[1:29:34] world he said preach the gospel and
[1:29:37] signs will follow why because our
[1:29:40] ministry is supposed to be when I say
[1:29:42] our our not just the pull pit our
[1:29:46] ministry is to be a
[1:29:48] continuation of the ministry of Christ
[1:29:51] and when you read how his ministry went
[1:29:53] it says he went about to all the cities
[1:29:54] teaching preaching healing every
[1:29:56] sickness and every disease amongst the
[1:29:58] people and then he says John 14:12 The
[1:30:01] Works that I do shall you do also
[1:30:06] brother Brown says yes the Bible Way is
[1:30:08] the real way of the open
[1:30:11] door we can't be
[1:30:14] satisfied with the power of God laying
[1:30:18] dormant we can't be satisfied putting
[1:30:20] those things on a shelf but he don't
[1:30:21] heal like he used to yes he does he
[1:30:23] doesn't change he doesn't save like he
[1:30:25] used to yes he does he doesn't change he
[1:30:28] doesn't fill people with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:30] like he did in the upper room yes he
[1:30:32] does he does not
[1:30:35] change we've got to stick with the
[1:30:37] original pattern
[1:30:39] amen he goes in he he spends the next
[1:30:42] Pages talking about his trip to South
[1:30:45] Africa there in Durban he says there was
[1:30:48] over 100,000 people in attendance and
[1:30:50] I'm going to just summarize this for you
[1:30:52] briefly he said there was a missionary
[1:30:55] there there with him and he told Brother
[1:30:57] Bram that he had seen one muhamad
[1:30:59] converted in 30 years one that was his
[1:31:03] life's work was 30 years there and he
[1:31:06] had one
[1:31:07] convert brother Brown says it's like a
[1:31:10] packed amongst them once a muhammadan
[1:31:11] always a muhammadan they stick together
[1:31:15] and so brother brandham gets up there
[1:31:16] and he asks the crowd he says have the
[1:31:19] missionaries he holds up the Bible read
[1:31:21] to you out of this book and all the
[1:31:22] missionaries were there
[1:31:25] and he says through the translators the
[1:31:26] people respond yes he says' and have
[1:31:29] they told you that Jesus came to save
[1:31:31] you and they all said yes now you got to
[1:31:34] understand he's dealing with people that
[1:31:36] they've been told this but they don't
[1:31:38] believe none of them have converted but
[1:31:41] they've been told the
[1:31:42] word over and over 30
[1:31:46] years he said but did they also tell
[1:31:50] you that this same Jesus was a mighty
[1:31:53] healer
[1:31:54] and that he would live in his people
[1:31:56] down Through the Ages until he came
[1:31:57] again to receive them unto himself did
[1:32:00] they tell you that because of that same
[1:32:02] spirit in them that was in Jesus that
[1:32:04] they would be able to do Mighty works
[1:32:05] even as Jesus did did they tell you that
[1:32:08] you can be healed even as you can be
[1:32:09] saved how many of you would like to see
[1:32:12] the same Jesus come down amongst us and
[1:32:14] do the same thing that he did when he
[1:32:16] was here on Earth long to
[1:32:18] go they all wanted that
[1:32:24] they all listen the world that'll make
[1:32:27] the world thirsty you show them a living
[1:32:30] God and not just a dead letter you begin
[1:32:33] to let them know that God still heals
[1:32:35] God still delivers look I'll never
[1:32:37] forget I was asked to give a a devotion
[1:32:39] one time at a little basketball game
[1:32:41] where Jude was playing and I'm sitting
[1:32:43] there in front of several hundred
[1:32:45] Baptist folks man I got to testifying
[1:32:47] about Jude's kidney being healed and how
[1:32:50] God created new kidneys in his body and
[1:32:52] I was just talking about it and you
[1:32:53] could heard a pin drop except for this
[1:32:56] one old woman she must have been like 80
[1:32:58] and she was over in the corner going
[1:33:01] amen yay man I'm like hey I got one I'll
[1:33:05] get one listen if it only touches one
[1:33:07] tell them about it God still heals God
[1:33:10] still saves he's the same the same way
[1:33:12] you can be saved you can be healed the
[1:33:14] same way you were saved you can be
[1:33:16] delivered the power has not
[1:33:19] changed he said they all wanted that and
[1:33:23] so he had a sister right there and he
[1:33:24] begins to speak with this sister and he
[1:33:26] begins to discern her by the power of
[1:33:28] the Holy Ghost and he begins to tell her
[1:33:29] her trouble what the doctors found what
[1:33:32] the doctor looked like what the
[1:33:33] diagnosis was he says I asked her and
[1:33:36] this is after he discerned her how is it
[1:33:38] you came to me a Christian why didn't
[1:33:40] you go to your Muhammad and Prophet she
[1:33:43] said I think you can help
[1:33:45] me I said I can't help you but if you
[1:33:48] receive Jesus Christ as your savior he
[1:33:50] who is here now and knows all about you
[1:33:53] he'll help you she said I accept Jesus
[1:33:57] as my savior that did it see how simple
[1:34:02] it is that did it now notice he didn't
[1:34:07] stand up there and break down all the
[1:34:08] doctrines and break you know what he did
[1:34:09] he showed them a living Christ he showed
[1:34:12] them a living God and the next part says
[1:34:15] she was healed and about 10,000
[1:34:18] muhammadans came to Christ that day
[1:34:20] because the gospel was preached in both
[1:34:22] word and power God never told a man to
[1:34:25] labor 30 years and harvest nothing my he
[1:34:29] gave us the open door of word and power
[1:34:32] and that is what we're supposed to use I
[1:34:35] say Get It Off the Shelf tonight we got
[1:34:38] something we're supposed to use we got
[1:34:40] word we got power we got mechanics we
[1:34:43] got Dynamics we got a power that'll
[1:34:45] bring the lost in that'll heal the sick
[1:34:48] that'll relieve your anxiety deliver you
[1:34:50] from depression he's the same God
[1:34:53] tonight tonight he says that's what
[1:34:55] we're supposed to use
[1:34:58] Hallelujah what' Paul say my preaching
[1:35:00] was not with enticing words but in
[1:35:03] demonstration of the spirit and power
[1:35:06] yes we should preach the word yes we
[1:35:09] should give them the word but it has to
[1:35:11] be brought by the original Open Door of
[1:35:14] Pentecost the open door of word and
[1:35:18] power church this word has life in it
[1:35:22] this isn't a dead word this word has
[1:35:24] life in it it has power in it it'll
[1:35:26] change your life how many can testify
[1:35:28] it'll change your life I was a nothing
[1:35:30] nobody lost and Bound for hell wrapped
[1:35:32] up in so much sin what a filthy life but
[1:35:35] one day one moment in his presence
[1:35:38] changed all of that how frustrating it
[1:35:40] must be for the devil to pour decade
[1:35:42] after decade after decade into a life
[1:35:45] and say I got them covered up there's no
[1:35:46] way this one's coming out but one moment
[1:35:49] in the presence of God oh how's he going
[1:35:51] to get my son one moment how's he going
[1:35:53] to get my daughter one moment that's all
[1:35:56] it takes is one moment in the presence
[1:35:58] of God don't over complicate it don't
[1:36:01] build it up too high he just needs a
[1:36:04] moment
[1:36:07] Hallelujah he just needs a
[1:36:12] moment why would we want to settle for
[1:36:14] anything
[1:36:15] less than the open door of word and
[1:36:19] power I want it
[1:36:22] all there's power to
[1:36:25] overcome in that day brother Brown says
[1:36:29] the word was well
[1:36:30] preached but it did not have the open
[1:36:33] door of power that it ought to have had
[1:36:37] the power of the spirit was missing he
[1:36:42] says the power of the spirit was missing
[1:36:44] in that age the word was well preached
[1:36:47] he was well able to make Souls wise unto
[1:36:50] salvation but the great power of God
[1:36:52] that showed forth his mighty works that
[1:36:54] made bear his arm in behalf of his own
[1:36:57] was missing except amongst the scattered
[1:37:01] groups woo I see myself in this one I
[1:37:04] see myself there he says yet praise God
[1:37:08] it was growing and had increased over
[1:37:12] what they had in the
[1:37:14] Reformation I read that and I got so
[1:37:16] excited I thought man that was the last
[1:37:18] age and the prophet looked at and said
[1:37:20] it was growing that seed had gone from
[1:37:23] the ground that went in in Ephesus and
[1:37:25] it was growing it wasn't there yet but
[1:37:27] it was growing that there was some life
[1:37:29] in them scattered groups and you begin
[1:37:31] to look back now knowing what we know
[1:37:33] and you can see a foundation being laid
[1:37:35] you can see a foundation laying a
[1:37:37] there's there's power about to be
[1:37:38] restored there's fullness on the horizon
[1:37:41] there's a message coming promised by
[1:37:43] Malachi 4 that's going to take the
[1:37:45] people all the way back to the original
[1:37:48] and you can look at it there in
[1:37:49] Philadelphia and say no that ain't it
[1:37:51] but it's growing that ain't a it but
[1:37:54] it's growing that ain't it but Satan
[1:37:56] hadn't been able to stop it the false
[1:37:58] Vine hadn't been able to stop it listen
[1:37:59] I going to leave you with this Satan has
[1:38:02] never been able to stop the plan of God
[1:38:04] and I got news for you because you're an
[1:38:06] attribute you are a part of the plan of
[1:38:09] God that means Satan cannot stop you
[1:38:13] we're still here but I'm growing I'm
[1:38:15] growing I'm getting closer I'm
[1:38:17] progressing I may not be there yet but
[1:38:20] he can't stomp out this life I'm still
[1:38:23] growing we're going to make it we're
[1:38:25] going to leave here we're going to
[1:38:26] Rapture because he can't stop this broad
[1:38:31] hallelujah hallelujah stand your feet
[1:38:34] with me tonight oh there's wonderful
[1:38:37] truths in the word of God there's
[1:38:39] wonderful wonderful truths there's a
[1:38:43] door that's been opened yes sir there's
[1:38:46] a
[1:38:46] door I'm so glad that God sent a Propet
[1:38:49] in this day I'm so glad we're not
[1:38:51] stumbling around blind
[1:38:54] I'm so glad that we've heard the call to
[1:38:55] come out of her I'm so glad he's still
[1:38:58] the same today as he was in brother
[1:38:59] bram's day I'm so glad the book is open
[1:39:02] I'm glad the door is open now Church
[1:39:05] let's take advantage of it let's operate
[1:39:08] in the fullness of the open door the
[1:39:11] open book The Open Word it's all open he
[1:39:15] said I opened it ain't no man going to
[1:39:18] shut it what God has restored we ain't
[1:39:21] going to let no man take away hold BL
[1:39:23] ask that which thou Hast that no man
[1:39:26] take thy Crown I let you know there's
[1:39:29] people after it there's Spirits after it
[1:39:32] he says hold on fast you know I look at
[1:39:34] the church ages and it's just me and and
[1:39:37] you look back in Ephesus you know that
[1:39:39] original church that that the word
[1:39:41] speaks of so highly that brother Bram
[1:39:42] says it's the pattern and yet they
[1:39:44] fell and you look at it and you say why'
[1:39:47] they fall how'd they fall brother Bron
[1:39:49] makes it clear go back and read the
[1:39:50] Ephesian age he calls about nickan ism
[1:39:53] and a hierarchy over the church he said
[1:39:55] they began to make Church formal and it
[1:39:58] began to squeeze the life out of it and
[1:40:01] make it all about just the word of
[1:40:04] course then they begin to pervert the
[1:40:05] word as well but at first he said that
[1:40:07] squeeze the life like a boowa
[1:40:09] constrictor or a python by making their
[1:40:11] worship formal by taking the power of
[1:40:14] God out of and I got to think and I said
[1:40:16] you know and this is just me but the
[1:40:19] devil looks around he sees a group of
[1:40:21] people on the Earth and he says I I
[1:40:23] ain't seen something like that in 2,000
[1:40:25] years I ain't seen a group like that
[1:40:28] since that first
[1:40:30] age now how did I get
[1:40:34] them
[1:40:35] oh I made them
[1:40:37] cold I made them formal I made them
[1:40:42] powerless I made them just focus on just
[1:40:44] give them the
[1:40:45] word and if it works in that age I'mma
[1:40:49] get them again
[1:40:54] but this eve this bride she's
[1:40:57] predestinated not to fall we had a
[1:41:00] Prophet come he told us don't be formal
[1:41:03] don't be cold keep your fire lit keep
