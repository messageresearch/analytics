[18:13] is to worship you the almighty God. So
[18:17] Lord we come father with these needs
[18:19] because Lord we know you've already
[18:21] provided for each one of them. Lord, you

[18:26] morning. You know the need behind it,
[18:29] Father. So Lord, our faith is in you and
[18:32] you alone, Lord, to meet every need.
[18:35] Lord, we've heard the request. Sister
[18:37] Edna Hollis there in the hospital this
[18:39] morning. Lord, we we know the doctors
[18:43] are not given a lot of hope, but we look
[18:45] to you, Lord. Father, you are our hope,
[18:49] Lord. You've given us promises
[18:51] concerning our healing, Lord. So we
[18:53] claim that for our sister even now,
[18:56] Lord. She may be up in age, Lord, and
[18:58] the doctors not know what to do, but
[19:00] you're the great
[19:02] physician. So we call on you today for
[19:04] this need, Lord. Our brother Kenny Camp
[19:07] that's in need, Lord, very sick. Ask
[19:10] that you would come by his way even now,

[19:16] morning. and may our faith unite with
[19:17] his Lord and call down the healing from

[19:25] Calvary for Brother Kenny and we claim
[19:27] that in the name of Jesus. We ask now,

[19:52] that you would be there, Lord. You're
[19:54] the healer in the great physician.
[19:56] Doctors can only do what they know how
[19:58] physically, but you're the healer, Lord.
[20:01] So, we ask that you would come down in
[20:03] that room and bring healing to her body.
[20:06] We love you, Father, and we thank you
[20:08] for this opportunity today. We ask Lord
[20:11] that as we would go forth as service
[20:13] Lord that you would move on every heart
[20:16] Lord if there are sick among us you
[20:18] would heal them. If there are those that
[20:20] don't know you, that are away from you,

[20:33] morning. Lord, I need you. And we are a
[20:36] needy people. And we acknowledge that,
[20:38] Father. Without you, we have nothing.
[20:41] Father, so we call you on the scene
[20:43] today for these needs and for this
[20:46] service. We ask these things this
[20:48] morning in the precious name of our Lord
[20:50] and Savior Jesus
[20:52] Christ. Thank you,
[20:54] Lord. Amen. I greet you this morning in
[20:58] the name of the Lord. We have a few
[21:01] announcements or actually um some things
[21:05] that concern the facilities that I
[21:07] wanted to talk to you'all about just a
[21:09] moment. You know, the Lord has blessed
[21:12] us with um some wonderful facilities
[21:14] here and we all enjoy using them. Uh
[21:18] they've been such a blessing to us. And
[21:20] so I wanted to talk to you all a moment
[21:22] about the use of them. And you know,
[21:25] Sister Lydia, she kind of keeps the
[21:27] sanctuary clean, these bathrooms up
[21:29] here. Uh but she don't take care of all
[21:32] the facilities uh as far as the
[21:34] cleanliness and keeping them clean. So,
[21:37] I wanted to make mention that when we
[21:40] use these other areas, the fellowship
[21:42] hall, um the activity center, the
[21:47] pavilion, we need to clean up after
[21:49] ourselves. So, if we have an event or
[21:51] something going on, uh maybe a
[21:54] basketball, whatever is being played out
[21:56] there or somebody's having a birthday,
[21:58] whatever it is that we need to take the
[22:01] responsibility to make sure that all the
[22:02] trash is taken out, uh the floor swept,
[22:05] the bathrooms cleaned up. So, I just
[22:08] wanted to make that uh mention that we
[22:11] don't want trash left anywhere. You
[22:13] know, it'll draw uh unwanted guest. And
[22:16] so we want to take care of of that and
[22:19] make sure everything's cleaned up to
[22:20] keep it nice and that uh we don't burden
[22:22] somebody just you know one person with
[22:24] having to take care of that. So just
[22:27] wanted to mention that and um you know
[22:30] wipe the tables up, sweep the floors,
[22:33] wash the dishes, whatever is being used,
[22:35] just make sure you leave it in a good
[22:36] condition when you leave after using
[22:38] those. We sure are thankful to have them
[22:41] and we want to take care of what the
[22:42] Lord has blessed us with. Amen. Also, um
[22:47] wanted to mention our nurseries. We have
[22:49] uh a lot of new little ones. And it's
[22:52] such a wonderful thing to see all the
[22:54] new mothers with the little babies. And
[22:56] we do have um two nurseries. And we have
[23:00] one that's uh like a quiet area. So, if
[23:02] you're taking your baby in there, maybe
[23:04] a small child nursing, uh maybe trying
[23:07] to get them to sleep, we have one that's
[23:08] designated as a quiet uh nursery. And
[23:11] then we have one that's uh to be used
[23:14] maybe for uh you have to take a a small
[23:18] toddler child out for discipline
[23:21] whatever it would need. Um you could go
[23:24] in the other ones. So just want to make
[23:27] mention of that that it is those are to
[23:30] be used for that purpose. They're not
[23:32] really a sitting area to go and just sit
[23:35] out the service with the child and let
[23:37] them run around and play. That's not
[23:39] what they're designated for. They're
[23:40] they're designated to take them in
[23:42] there, take care of their needs, and
[23:44] then come back into the service. Um,
[23:47] recently we had to clean those uh
[23:51] nurseries. There was um a lot of stuff
[23:53] in the carpets, uh, gummy candies,
[23:56] different things like that that So, we
[23:58] don't want you to go in there and feed
[24:00] your children and leave stuff. We want
[24:02] to keep that clean. um just use it as an
[24:06] area not to let your child run around,
[24:08] but keep that area reverent. Uh we have
[24:11] the monitors that are playing the
[24:12] service in there. So, we want you to if
[24:15] you have to take them out, make them sit
[24:17] quietly in there. Uh take care of their
[24:19] needs and then come back into the
[24:21] service. So, just wanted to make mention
[24:23] of that. Uh and you know, uh there's
[24:28] some things that that we can do as
[24:29] parents. you know, we don't want to
[24:31] train our children to, you know, we have
[24:33] to take them out and let them play and
[24:35] run around because they like that a lot
[24:37] better than having to sit still in the
[24:38] service. So, we want to use wisdom as
[24:40] parents and make sure that we're not
[24:42] letting them train us to take them out.
[24:44] So, just wanted to mention that and um I
[24:48] know been a little bit lengthy this
[24:50] morning. Had several things that uh been
[24:53] needing to take care of, but that's all
[24:55] I have this morning. So, God bless you.
[24:57] I look forward to the service today and
[25:00] serving the Lord. I'm excited about what
[25:02] God's going to do today. Amen. God bless
[25:04] you, brother
[25:11] Timothy. How many can say amen, brother
[25:13] Daryl?
[25:16] Amen. Amen. Won't you just turn around,
[25:19] shake one of those
[25:20] hand, welcome each other to the house of
[25:23] the Lord today. And if you have a
[25:25] visitor next to you, be sure to make
[25:27] sure that they're they feel welcome. And
[25:29] we've got quite a few here today. Amen.
[25:32] Some visiting loved ones, some visiting
[25:34] the service as well. And so, Amen. Just
[25:38] want to make everyone welcome. And God
[25:40] bless you today. So glad you could be a
[25:42] part. Amen. I know it was the blood.
[25:46] Amen. I know it was a blood for me. Ask
[25:48] the brothers they would take up the
[25:50] offering today. I know it was the blood.
[25:54] I know it was the blood. I know it was
[25:58] the
[26:00] blood for me. One day when I was gone,
[26:05] he died upon the cross. I know it was
[26:09] the blood for
[26:12] me. Oh, I know it was the blood. I know
[26:17] it was blood. I know it was his
[26:21] love for me. One day when I was lost, he
[26:27] died upon the cross. I know it was love
[26:32] for
[26:33] me. Well, I know he paid the price. I
[26:38] know he paid the
[26:43] price. Oh yeah. One day when I was lost,

[27:13] back for
[27:15] me. Well, I know it was the blood. I
[27:19] know it was the
[27:24] blood for me. One day when I was lost,
[27:30] he died on the cross. And I know it
[27:33] wasn't blood for
[27:36] me. For I am covered. Covered. I'm
[27:40] covered by his blood. I'm walking by
[27:44] faith. I'm living in love. I am covered.
[27:49] Covered. I'm covered by his blood. For
[27:53] Jesus has rescued
[27:56] me. Yes, I am
[27:59] covered. Oh, I'm covered by his blood.
[28:03] I'm walking by
[28:07] faith. Oh, I am covered.

[28:26] [Music]
[28:27] victory. It's in the name of Jesus. In
[28:32] the name of Jesus, demons will have to
[28:36] flee.
[28:39] When we come in the name of
[28:43] Jesus, tell me who can stand
[28:48] before. In the precious name of
[28:54] Jesus, the
[29:00] victory. Hallelujah. How many got the
[29:02] victory this

[36:10] goodness and mercy will follow me all of
[36:15] my
[36:17] days. I know by your still waters I'm
[36:22] safe.
[36:24] I know by your still waters I'm
[36:29] [Music]
[36:33] [Applause]
[36:42] safe.
[36:44] Hallelujah. Amen. That's one of my
[36:46] favorite scriptures. It's a wonderful
[36:49] thing to be able to read when you're in
[36:50] a moment of fear and anxiety, knowing
[36:53] David faced those same things. No doubt
[36:56] he faced it when he faced that Goliath
[36:58] of great fear, but he knew his God was
[37:01] greater than his fear. He said, "Yay,
[37:04] though I walk through the valley of the
[37:05] shadow of death, I will fear no evil."
[37:08] Didn't mean that he didn't have fear,
[37:09] but he had to fear that evil. Amen.
[37:12] Because his God was greater than that
[37:14] evil. And I believe we have a God that's
[37:16] greater than any situation that we may
[37:19] face this morning. You believe that this
[37:21] morning with all your heart. Amen.
[37:23] Adorations and praises. Let's just sing
[37:26] that.
[37:30] Adoration and
[37:33] praisees my my soul.
[37:37] [Music]

[40:20] be strong. I will

[42:43] Oh, I will sing to the
[42:47] Lord. And I will
[42:51] sing to the
[42:54] Lord through
[42:59] lifting my hands.
[43:03] Oh,
[43:05] hallelujah
[43:07] to the
[43:12] lamb. When I come into his
[43:16] presence, I
[43:18] humble
[43:21] myself. I lift both my
[43:25] hands and
[43:27] I begin.
[43:32] Oh yes,
[43:35] Lord. Oh, I
[43:40] worship
[43:42] him when I come
[43:47] into his
[43:49] presence. I humble
[43:53] myself remembering what he's done. All
[43:57] the victories he's won.
[44:02] Oh, I praise
[44:06] him. Oh, I
[44:10] praise
[44:13] him. Oh,
[44:16] all he's done for
[44:22] me. Redeemed and set me
[44:28] free. And
[44:32] because just
[44:35] because he's God when I come into his
[44:41] presence, when I come into his
[44:47] presence, oh, I humble myself.
[44:52] Hallelujah. I surrender to you, Lord.
[44:55] [Music]
[44:57] I begin to worship.
[45:01] Oh yes
[45:03] Lord I
[45:07] worship
[45:09] him when I come into his
[45:15] presence. I humble
[45:18] myself remembering what he's done.
[45:23] Hallelujah.
[45:25] Oh, I'll
[45:26] praise
[45:30] you.
[45:33] [Music]
[45:41] I

[45:47] Jesus. Oh
[45:50] yes. That's
[45:53] because just

[46:41] [Music]
[46:43] He's

[46:47] Praise you, Lord.
[46:54] Oh, for all is

[47:17] he's hallelujah.
[47:21] He's my God.
[47:25] Is he your God this morning?
[47:27] And he we owe him everything.
[47:31] We want to surrender our all to
[47:34] him. Let's just bow our heads for a
[47:36] moment as we ask God's blessings today.
[47:40] Lord, we want to thank you for your
[47:41] blessings to
[47:43] us, for your mercies that endure to all
[47:47] generations. That you're a merciful God.
[47:51] A God that is rich, rich in mercy.
[47:55] Your mercy never
[47:57] fails. We don't even ask for justice,
[48:00] Lord, but we ask for
[48:03] mercy. Cuz if we got what we deserve,
[48:06] Lord, we would all go to hell. But Lord,
[48:10] because of your
[48:11] mercy, rewriting our lives, revealing
[48:15] our names in the Lamb's Book of
[48:17] Life, Lord, you're so good to us. We
[48:22] just want to give you praise and thanks
[48:24] for all the great things that you've
[48:26] done. Lord, you know the needs of your
[48:29] children today, the requests that have
[48:32] been brought in. Lord, there's Brother
[48:34] Jeff Smith fighting some kind of
[48:37] infection. Lord, sickness in his body. I
[48:40] pray, Lord, you'll bring healing to that
[48:42] home today. You'll just lift up their
[48:45] spirits, Lord, to believe the word of
[48:47] promise for them. And not only them,
[48:49] Lord, but for all that will be joining
[48:52] with us today and presenting their needs
[48:55] with our prayers as we pray. We pray, oh
[49:00] God, that you'll just meet them, then
[49:02] meet the needs of your people
[49:04] everywhere. We're needy. Father, speak
[49:08] to hearts and lives. Reveal yourself and
[49:11] anoint us by your spirit. For Lord, the
[49:15] word is only letter without anointing.
[49:18] And it's the anointing that breaks the
[49:21] yoke. So break the yoke of sin and
[49:23] unbelief off of lives today and bring
[49:26] deliverance in the hearts and lives of
[49:28] your children. In Jesus' name we ask it.
[49:33] Amen. And amen. God bless you. Could you
[49:37] just play softly only believe for a
[49:41] moment? I just want to take a moment
[49:44] this
[49:45] morning to reflect if we
[49:52] could. 116 years ago
[49:55] today, God sent
[49:59] a a gift into the world.
[50:02] [Music]
[50:05] Brother William Marin Brandon was born
[50:08] today back in
[50:11] 1909. This December will be 60 years
[50:14] since God took him
[50:16] home. I want to just share this account
[50:19] from the supernatural books by Owen
[50:21] Jorgensson. As we reflect on it for a
[50:25] moment, it was shortly after 5:00
[50:28] Tuesday morning, April the 6th, 1909.
[50:31] Daylight filtered in through the
[50:33] jinks. Even though the sun had not
[50:36] topped the horizon, his father, Charles,
[50:39] opened the shutter, then drew back,
[50:41] startled. Something had darted through
[50:43] the open window, a light like a star
[50:47] about a foot in
[50:49] diameter. His mother, Ellis, screamed
[50:51] and cradled her son tightly to her
[50:54] bosom. The others, bewildered, stepped
[50:56] back against the wall.
[50:59] The strange light circled the room
[51:01] several times and then stopped over the
[51:04] bed, hovering above the new mother and
[51:08] the
[51:09] child. Glowing yellowish green pulsating
[51:12] with a life of its
[51:14] own. For less than a minute, it held
[51:17] that position. Not long, yet long enough
[51:19] for everyone in the cabin to be sure
[51:21] they had really seen it.
[51:23] Then as quickly as it come
[51:25] in, the fireball left, whirling up past
[51:29] the rafters and out through the
[51:32] roof. His father, Charles, stared up at
[51:35] the clapboard shingles with wide,
[51:37] unblinking eyes, and suddenly a flurry
[51:39] of wings turned his attention toward the
[51:43] door where a dove had landed on the seal
[51:46] of the open window. This snow white dove
[51:50] eyed the room with curiosity, almost as
[51:52] if it was looking for something or
[51:55] somebody. And when it spotted the
[51:57] newborn baby, it cocked his head and
[51:59] cooed before it flew
[52:01] away. Charles gazed after the bird for a
[52:05] moment, then rolled his eyes back toward
[52:08] the ceiling, and one of the neighbor
[52:10] women muttered, "Well, I never." Others
[52:13] mused, "I wonder what kind of young this
[52:16] boy will be." Billy Brham was only 15
[52:20] minutes old. The news spread quickly
[52:23] among the mountain folks about that
[52:26] young and born yonder on the hill with a
[52:28] light over him. Some passed off as
[52:31] sunlight reflecting from a
[52:33] mirror. Charles and Ella knew better
[52:37] since there were no mirrors in their
[52:38] cabin. Besides, the sun had not yet come
[52:42] up.
[52:43] And they were
[52:44] puzzled. Was there some spiritual
[52:47] meaning in that light? Charles wanted to
[52:50] forget it, but Ella wouldn't let him.
[52:52] She insisted something must be done. And
[52:54] finally, they decided that their baby
[52:57] should be taken to church and dedicated
[53:00] to
[53:00] God. At first, Charles argued against
[53:04] this idea, but finally he consented.
[53:07] And although the concession ranked
[53:10] ranked against the grain of his
[53:11] character, but now the question came up,
[53:15] where would they take
[53:16] him? The ancestry of Charles Brham was
[53:19] strictly Catholic. On Ella's side, the
[53:22] Harveys were Irish Catholic,
[53:24] too. However, both Charles and Ella had
[53:27] drifted completely away from their
[53:29] Catholic foundation, and neither of them
[53:32] had any formal religious convictions.
[53:35] They agreed for their purpose. The best
[53:38] church was the nearest church. So when
[53:41] Billy Brham was two weeks old, Charles
[53:44] and Ellen bundled him up, took him to
[53:47] the Possum Kingdom Baptist Church where
[53:50] a small congregation met each Sunday in
[53:54] a rustic log building with a dirt floor
[53:56] and pews made from boards lying across
[54:00] uptown turned blocks of wood.
[54:04] The Possum Kingdom Baptist Church had no
[54:06] regular pastor. On most Sundays, the
[54:09] congregation sang songs and read from
[54:11] the Bible. But every two months, a
[54:14] circuit preacher came through and
[54:17] delivered a sermon. The old preacher was
[54:20] there today. He offered prayer over
[54:23] little William Mary and Brham, asking
[54:25] God to someday use this boy in his
[54:29] service.
[54:30] When he was only seven years old, he was
[54:32] passing under a popular tree and he
[54:36] heard the sound of leaves rustling. It
[54:39] was like a wind blowing in the top of a
[54:41] tree. And a voice came out of this wind
[54:44] saying, "Never smoke or drink or defile
[54:47] your body in any way, for I have work
[54:50] for you to do when you are older."
[54:53] Surrounding the time of his conversion,
[54:55] there was a light formed like a cross
[54:57] and a voice spoke to him. 1933, as he
[55:02] took those who accepted the Lord and his
[55:05] ministry down to the river to baptize
[55:07] them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:10] Christ, there was a strange and glorious
[55:13] star appeared above the baptismal scene
[55:16] so that the audience saw it. Some were
[55:19] frightened and some trembled. But some
[55:22] ran with a
[55:24] voice that because of they heard a voice
[55:28] saying, "As John the Baptist forerun the
[55:32] first coming of Christ, so will your
[55:35] message forun the second coming."
[55:38] On May 7th,
[55:41] 1946, nearly 79 years ago, Brother
[55:45] Brandham had been criticized because
[55:49] of seeing the working of the
[55:52] supernatural. And he's being told that
[55:54] visions were of the devil. And he had
[55:58] worked hard that day and came home and
[56:00] was standing there under an maple tree
[56:03] when this wind stirred the top of the
[56:05] tree. It frightened him with a great
[56:09] rushing sound greater than he had ever
[56:12] heard before. And his wife thought
[56:14] something had happened. But he bit her
[56:16] goodbye and told her he just had to find
[56:19] out what this meant. And he went away to
[56:21] seek God to know what this was all
[56:24] about. Said, "I must find out." He went
[56:27] alone bowing before his Lord in
[56:29] repentance and in weep and praying
[56:31] asking the Lord would to speak to him.
[56:35] It was about the 11th hour at the night.
[56:37] He quit praying at the time was sitting
[56:39] up when a light flickered in the room.
[56:43] He thought someone was shining with a
[56:45] flashlight into the cab cabin. But when
[56:48] he looked out the window, he saw no one.
[56:50] Then he observed the light as it began
[56:53] to spread wider and wider across the
[56:55] floor. Naturally, he became frightened.
[56:58] And as it beheld, lo, the stars hung in
[57:02] the room like a ball of fire. He heard
[57:05] the sound of feet walking. Then he saw
[57:07] feet coming toward him. Then he beheld
[57:10] this angel from God. He estimated he was
[57:13] about 200 lb, dressed in a white robe,
[57:17] rather dark complexion, hair flowing
[57:20] down to his shoulders. This angel spoke
[57:22] to him and said, "Fear not. I'm sent
[57:25] from the presence of almighty God to
[57:28] tell you your partic peculiar life and
[57:31] misunderstood ways have been to indicate
[57:34] that God has sent you to take a gift of
[57:36] divine healing to the peoples of the
[57:39] world. If you will be sincere and can
[57:43] get the people to believe you, nothing
[57:45] can stand before your prayer, not even
[57:48] cancer. He was told many other things in
[57:51] this visitation.
[57:52] It's told that he would be given two
[57:54] signs as Moses had been given so that if
[57:58] people would not believe the first sign,
[58:00] they would believe the second sign. By
[58:03] one gift, he would have be given the
[58:05] power to detect diseases. By another, he
[58:08] would discern the thoughts and deeds of
[58:11] men. The angel explained that the
[58:14] thoughts of men speak louder in heaven
[58:16] than their words do on earth. He was
[58:19] told among many things this gift was a
[58:22] sign of the nearness of the coming of
[58:24] the Lord and through it God would call
[58:27] his people together in the unity of the
[58:29] spirit. In short, the man we know as
[58:32] William Brham was sent to demonstrate
[58:35] God again in the
[58:38] flesh. As I think about one of his
[58:41] greatest experiences, which was going
[58:43] beyond the curtain of time, and he saw
[58:47] millions gathered on the other
[58:51] side, every one of them young,
[58:54] vibrant, healthy, and
[58:56] well, he was told, "Those are your
[58:58] converts, the ones you led to the Lord.
[59:01] Some of them women you think are so
[59:03] beautiful, they're better than 90 years
[59:06] old when you led them to the Lord."
[59:08] and and said, "No wonder they're
[59:10] screaming, our precious
[59:12] brother." And they screamed all at
[59:15] once. If you hadn't
[59:17] went, we wouldn't be
[59:20] here. Certainly, God used him to bring
[59:23] millions to Christ. Sister Marilyn
[59:26] Griffith went to be with the Lord on
[59:28] Thursday, and we'll have her funeral on
[59:30] Tuesday. But she recounted to me when
[59:33] she heard first heard the
[59:35] message and the the impact it had on her
[59:39] life the very first time looking at the
[59:42] the pillar of fire and the man that God
[59:47] was using at that time and said it
[59:49] looked like he looked right deep into my
[59:53] soul. The power of the gospel though is
[59:56] what's important. It transformed her
[59:59] life.
[1:00:00] made her a real
[1:00:02] Christian. As of today, there have been
[1:00:05] no equal to rise to brother Brandham in
[1:00:07] his
[1:00:08] ministry. All there's been many
[1:00:10] wonderful gifts, gifts of healing, gifts
[1:00:14] of prophecy, even words of
[1:00:17] knowledge. But brother Brandham, this
[1:00:20] was no gift like found in the list of
[1:00:22] the nine spiritual gifts. But what we
[1:00:25] witnessed was the ministry of Jesus
[1:00:28] Christ repeated again in this day for
[1:00:32] the purpose of vindicating the word.
[1:00:35] There will be no one else rise for the
[1:00:38] Gentiles who will have this gift. It is
[1:00:41] one to a
[1:00:43] generation. Now he was a man. He
[1:00:46] certainly wasn't God. But he revealed
[1:00:49] Jesus in a way no other man has done
[1:00:51] since the book of Acts.
[1:00:54] Even today, nearly 60 years since his
[1:00:56] death, there's been no one arisen from
[1:01:00] anywhere from the millions of preachers
[1:01:02] or religious movements that is even
[1:01:05] close to the gift that he had. It was
[1:01:09] perfect. Some might have the operation
[1:01:12] of a gift and it be
[1:01:14] occasional, sometimes hit and miss, but
[1:01:17] this was continual and perfect. Night
[1:01:20] after night, service after service with
[1:01:23] uncanny details, telling of names,
[1:01:27] addresses, diseases, repeating back even
[1:01:30] prayers that were prayed or what the
[1:01:32] doctor said as the spirit discerned the
[1:01:35] thoughts and intents of the heart, doing
[1:01:38] only what the word can do.
[1:01:41] Today here in this church we
[1:01:45] believe in every gift of the spirit and
[1:01:47] believe they should be active in the
[1:01:50] church. But we must be cautious. We must
[1:01:54] take care.
[1:01:56] Care must be given that we not be
[1:01:58] overtaken with fleshly emotion or say
[1:02:01] things with uh just because of
[1:02:04] enthusiasm or by impression and say
[1:02:07] things that the Lord did not say that
[1:02:10] would be lying on God would bring great
[1:02:12] harm to the body of Christ. But at the
[1:02:14] same time we cannot allow skepticism and
[1:02:18] suspicion to hinder God from showing
[1:02:20] himself to be the same yesterday, today
[1:02:23] and forever. There are true gifts, there
[1:02:26] are false
[1:02:28] gifts, and there are impersonations of
[1:02:31] true gifts. But we cannot allow the
[1:02:34] false to keep us away from the true.
[1:02:38] As I think of this
[1:02:41] today, and we have prayed often for our
[1:02:45] brother Ron
[1:02:47] Spencer, and there has been countless of
[1:02:52] brain scans that have been
[1:02:54] made throughout these five years. As you
[1:02:57] know, he was only given four months to
[1:03:00] live with showing cancer in the brain,
[1:03:04] three
[1:03:05] tumors. And every time they have been
[1:03:08] showing that they are there, they're
[1:03:11] present. But the other day, just
[1:03:13] recently of this
[1:03:15] week, one of the specialists walked into
[1:03:17] the
[1:03:18] room after examining the scan and said,
[1:03:22] "It's a miracle. There are no cancer in
[1:03:26] your brain.
[1:03:48] Hallelujah. As we think on this today,
[1:03:51] we know he's still got many battles
[1:03:54] ahead. He's still taking chemo. This
[1:03:56] chemo still makes him very, very sick.
[1:03:59] He would spend most of the morning
[1:04:02] yesterday throwing up because of it.
[1:04:04] Feels better today. When will he stop?
[1:04:07] When will he when will he decide? I I
[1:04:10] don't know. I don't know. I It's like
[1:04:14] with Sister Lana when she was had taken
[1:04:17] two treatments. I think it was two. And
[1:04:19] and went back for
[1:04:21] her to get a scan to see on the progress
[1:04:24] and there was no more. and they were
[1:04:27] continuing to insist that she finish out
[1:04:29] the 12
[1:04:32] treatments.
[1:04:34] Anyway, as her pastor, I wouldn't tell
[1:04:37] them, "Don't take
[1:04:39] anymore." I wouldn't give them any
[1:04:41] advice. I said, "This is a got to be a
[1:04:43] personal revelation to you." They went
[1:04:46] all the way down to I think it was well
[1:04:49] to Houston. Was it MDM Anderson?
[1:04:51] whatever the cancer specialist is down
[1:04:53] there, they encouraged her to finish all
[1:04:56] the
[1:04:58] treatments, even though they could find
[1:05:00] no trace of the
[1:05:03] cancer. And they told her, "Keep on
[1:05:06] taking
[1:05:07] it." And they didn't know what to do.
[1:05:10] Her husband being in the medical field
[1:05:12] knew you wasn't supposed to treat and
[1:05:16] cause harm with medication when there
[1:05:18] was no reason for
[1:05:20] it. And so yet the doctors were
[1:05:24] insistent that she continued taking all
[1:05:26] the medications and the treatments the
[1:05:29] doctors would admit would actually take
[1:05:32] her life. It would kill her.
[1:05:36] And
[1:05:38] yet seeking for an answer, they came
[1:05:41] back to youth camp that
[1:05:46] Easter and as they listen to the
[1:05:48] ministry of the word, brother Andrew
[1:05:51] Glover preached a
[1:05:53] sermon, when God cancels the devil's
[1:05:56] plans.
[1:05:59] And there it gave them the consolation
[1:06:02] and the revelation in their heart. No
[1:06:04] more treatments. That's been seven years
[1:06:07] ago and she has a complete clean bill of
[1:06:11] health to the glory of
[1:06:23] God in
[1:06:26] memory of these things that God has done
[1:06:30] in our generation and sending a the
[1:06:33] seventh angel messenger to the Leot.
[1:06:36] CNH. Let's just stand for a moment and
[1:06:39] reverently sing.

[1:07:43] possible with the Lord.
[1:07:47] You know I believe
[1:07:52] [Applause]
[1:07:54] you know the heart of man.
[1:07:59] We would say help our unbelief Lord.
[1:08:04] are
[1:08:06] possible. Lord,
[1:08:09] I
[1:08:12] believe. God bless you. If you'll turn
[1:08:15] with me to
[1:08:16] Revelation 12 verse
[1:08:20] 7. I think it was only last year, was it
[1:08:25] February,
[1:08:27] March, maybe it was January last year,
[1:08:31] you know, I flew
[1:08:33] to to uh Virginia. Brother Ron had
[1:08:37] received news that he had cancer in his
[1:08:41] eyes, both
[1:08:43] eyes, and that the treatment would be
[1:08:46] that they would have to they would have
[1:08:48] to remove one eye and do chemo in the
[1:08:51] other. And you know, it was just, you
[1:08:54] know, it seemed that the brain cancer
[1:08:56] had moved and now come was affecting his
[1:08:59] vision was in his eyes and was spreading
[1:09:02] through. And that was only a year ago.
[1:09:06] And you know, I preached a sermon there
[1:09:08] called the hour is come. Brother Donnie
[1:09:11] Reagan was there with me and he also
[1:09:14] ministered on uh this wonderful
[1:09:17] scripture, great sermon. And and
[1:09:20] afterwards, we we had prayer for brother
[1:09:22] Ron and and we just believed the word of
[1:09:25] promise. He went back to the doctor
[1:09:28] within for the follow-up checkups. And I
[1:09:31] was there when he got had while I was
[1:09:33] there he had gotten a call you know
[1:09:35] telling him the gravity of the situation
[1:09:37] the appointments and what they were
[1:09:39] going to do and whatever. So he goes
[1:09:41] through a whole series of doctors one
[1:09:43] after one looking in the eye and one
[1:09:46] saying okay we're going to remove that
[1:09:47] one today and we you know we'll take
[1:09:50] that eyeball out and you won't be able
[1:09:52] to see with that you will we'll do uh
[1:09:54] chemo in the other. and he gets down to
[1:09:57] the last specialist and he takes a look
[1:10:00] in the eye and he says, "There's nothing
[1:10:02] there. It's all gone."
[1:10:06] From one
[1:10:08] one doctor to the next, that's how close
[1:10:13] your miracle might be today.
[1:10:18] I would look for it if I were you. I
[1:10:20] would be under
[1:10:22] expectation. Amen. Revelation 12:7.
[1:10:26] Remember our theme. Who art thou, oh
[1:10:28] great mountain? Thou shalt become a
[1:10:30] plain, and the headstone shall be
[1:10:33] brought forth with shoutings, crying
[1:10:35] grace, grace unto it. And there was war
[1:10:37] in heaven. Michael and his angels fought
[1:10:40] against the dragon. The dragon fought
[1:10:42] and his angels and prevailed not.
[1:10:44] Neither was their place found anymore in
[1:10:46] heaven. And the great dragon was cast
[1:10:49] out, the old serpent called the devil
[1:10:52] and Satan, which deceiveth the whole
[1:10:54] world. He was cast out into the earth,
[1:10:57] and his angels were cast out with him.
[1:11:00] And I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:11:02] heaven, now is come salvation and
[1:11:05] strength, and the kingdom of our God,
[1:11:08] and the power of his Christ. For the
[1:11:10] accuser of our brethren is cast down,
[1:11:12] which accused them before our God day
[1:11:14] and night. And they overcame him by the
[1:11:17] blood of the lamb, and by the word of
[1:11:18] their testimony, and they love not their
[1:11:20] lives unto the death. Therefore, rejoice
[1:11:23] ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.
[1:11:26] Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and
[1:11:28] of the sea, for the devil has come down
[1:11:30] into you having a great wrath, because
[1:11:32] he knoweth he hath but a short time. God
[1:11:35] bless you. You can be
[1:11:39] seated. Now last Sunday I preached on
[1:11:43] the power of the
[1:11:46] blood and that we know that the blood is
[1:11:51] still the only place where God will meet
[1:11:53] a man. It is God's chosen place of
[1:11:57] worship. Brother Brandham preached a
[1:11:59] sermon called the trial. He would call
[1:12:01] it of course trial a trial dri. But
[1:12:04] about five different times he ministered
[1:12:06] on that subject after he ministered on
[1:12:09] the seven seals. This was all in the
[1:12:11] year
[1:12:12] 1964. And in those sermons, he showed
[1:12:16] that Satan is still the prosecuting
[1:12:19] attorney that is bringing accusations
[1:12:22] against God and against man, disputing
[1:12:26] God's word, and that as long as Satan is
[1:12:29] accusing, which he does every day, then
[1:12:32] we need an intercessor.
[1:12:34] Amen. So well you some will think uh
[1:12:38] today and I don't know where they come
[1:12:41] up with some of these ideas. It's man's
[1:12:43] interpretation but somehow that the
[1:12:45] bride don't need an intercessor anymore.
[1:12:49] Now we've been declared righteous and
[1:12:50] the case is dismissed. And I get that. I
[1:12:54] I sincerely do. I believe that we are
[1:12:56] justified by faith and that the blood
[1:12:59] cleanses. and Paul because Paul said,
[1:13:02] "We are the righteousness of God." Yet,
[1:13:05] that was true for those believers 2,000
[1:13:08] years ago and they needed an
[1:13:10] intercessor.
[1:13:12] And you say, "Well, what do what do we
[1:13:14] need an intercessor for?" Well,
[1:13:16] sometimes you forget how holy God is. He
[1:13:20] is so holy that angels look black in his
[1:13:24] presence. And then what about you? You
[1:13:27] you have disbelieved. You have doubted.
[1:13:30] And that's sin. Amen. You may not have
[1:13:33] done major things wrong and maybe go out
[1:13:36] and commit adultery or, you know, do
[1:13:38] something really really evil or
[1:13:40] drunkenness or or dope or whatever or
[1:13:43] some crime. But we have done enough in
[1:13:46] one day to need his blood. And if you
[1:13:50] have his blood, then that is
[1:13:53] intercession. For his blood he has
[1:13:55] cleansing you from sin, making you
[1:13:58] acceptable in his sight. Now that's what
[1:14:00] brother Brandham taught us in the fourth
[1:14:02] seal. He said when the church goes up,
[1:14:05] when the church is raptured, Satan is
[1:14:07] cast down. We just read about that in
[1:14:09] the Bible. See, he's finished. Then all
[1:14:12] his accusing is done. So we know he's
[1:14:15] going to be the accuser of the brethren
[1:14:18] as long as we are in this flesh.
[1:14:21] And so Satan can standard accuse because
[1:14:24] he's the attorney on one side. He's the
[1:14:27] opponent of Christ and he's saying,
[1:14:30] "Wait, Adam failed. Adam did this. I
[1:14:32] conquered him. So therefore, when I
[1:14:34] conquered him, I conquered all of
[1:14:36] mankind." But here's the mediator
[1:14:38] standing there, the kinsman redeemer
[1:14:40] standing there with the blood,
[1:14:42] interceding with his blood that can take
[1:14:44] the vilest sinner's heart and change it.
[1:14:47] That's the mediator on the throne. I'm
[1:14:50] glad to be able to declare that when
[1:14:52] Satan says you're guilty, God has
[1:14:54] already declared your innocence. Not
[1:14:58] because you never done anything, but
[1:15:01] because that his blood has completely
[1:15:06] atoned for every sin that you ever did.
[1:15:10] Now, so again, we have quoted from the
[1:15:12] future home how that the heavens and the
[1:15:15] earth is right now contaminated with
[1:15:18] devils that accuse us before God. Jesus
[1:15:21] is there to intercede for us. So here
[1:15:24] again, here Jesus is in the heaven. Here
[1:15:27] you are on the earth. Heavens between us
[1:15:30] are contaminated with devils that
[1:15:32] accuses before God. We know God made a
[1:15:34] way through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:37] He made a channel to be open between us
[1:15:39] and the throne of grace. And the accuser
[1:15:42] though keeps pointing a finger. You did
[1:15:44] this. You did that. You didn't do this
[1:15:46] right. Sins of omission. Sins and
[1:15:49] neglect. You didn't pray enough. You
[1:15:52] didn't fast enough. You're not worthy to
[1:15:54] go before this throne of grace. But you
[1:15:57] see, the blood still covers. Aren't you
[1:16:01] glad for the blood? But can you imagine
[1:16:04] today some filled with such arrogance
[1:16:06] and sinful pride they think I don't need
[1:16:09] an intercessor you know that somehow his
[1:16:12] intercessory work is over and not
[1:16:14] needed. Let me just share a few little
[1:16:16] quotations of brother Brandham's uh look
[1:16:19] at this and this is from forsaken all.
[1:16:22] He says we don't we do not want to try
[1:16:25] to enter into thy presence with sin upon
[1:16:28] us. Therefore, knowing each day troubles
[1:16:31] and things besets us that might not even
[1:16:34] be noticed in our thinkings. But when we
[1:16:37] become to think of a holy God who even
[1:16:40] angels are dirty in his sight, and this
[1:16:43] is in his prayer, then we know Lord that
[1:16:45] we have not even a chance unless we come
[1:16:48] through the blood of Jesus Christ. And
[1:16:51] then we are the children of God and our
[1:16:53] mistakes are overlooked as we confess
[1:16:56] them. Again, unbelief does not hinder
[1:16:58] God. He said, "And we would ask this
[1:17:01] morning in the light of the sanctifying
[1:17:03] power of his blood that you'd cleanse us
[1:17:06] from all our evil and anything we've
[1:17:08] done, thought, or said that would be
[1:17:10] contrary to thee." And Father, we know
[1:17:13] that would be many things. For a great
[1:17:17] holy God shall even angels look dirty to
[1:17:20] him, where would we
[1:17:22] stand? Amen. in the message shalom, he
[1:17:26] he talks about the year that he we were
[1:17:29] facing there. Um, as the the new year
[1:17:32] had begun, he said, "As we face this new
[1:17:34] year's and we're facing both, as I've
[1:17:37] read, darkness and light, we see David
[1:17:39] speaking here, trust in the Lord. Put
[1:17:41] your confidence in him." Isaiah said,
[1:17:43] "Gross darkness is coming upon his
[1:17:45] people, but for the church to rise and
[1:17:48] shine in the glory of the light." So we
[1:17:52] face this year just like we do all
[1:17:56] years. There is a regret of our mistakes
[1:18:00] in the past. A looking forward to a
[1:18:04] future of the glorious light of Christ.
[1:18:07] No doubt if we live through this year
[1:18:09] we'll find many mistakes that we made.
[1:18:12] And we just expect that because it goes
[1:18:15] along with the the pro and con. That's a
[1:18:18] law of average that we live by here in
[1:18:20] this life. But we're so glad we have a
[1:18:24] mediator who sits at the right hand of
[1:18:27] God to make intercessions. When we are
[1:18:30] willing to admit our mistakes that we've
[1:18:33] done wrong, then he forgives them. He is
[1:18:36] full of grace and mercy to forgive us of
[1:18:39] those mistakes.
[1:18:41] I think of a private interview that he
[1:18:44] had that was recorded with Sister
[1:18:46] Georgie. Bruce and and and this was done
[1:18:49] on the morning where he preached the
[1:18:51] masterpiece in 1964 in Janu uh July the
[1:18:55] 5th. And he's and he's he's talking to
[1:18:58] Sister Bruce and said, "I'm going to
[1:19:00] pray for you. I'm not worthy of that. I
[1:19:02] think what would I do if the Lord if
[1:19:04] Jesus Christ was sitting here now? What
[1:19:07] would he do if he was sitting here? He
[1:19:09] had lay his hands on you and with his
[1:19:11] great faith see you'd get well. Well, I
[1:19:14] think well I'm a sinner. I'm not him but
[1:19:17] I come to represent him. But remember me
[1:19:19] and be a sinner and before God I'm not a
[1:19:22] sinner and neither are you. We got a
[1:19:25] blood sacrifice laying there. God
[1:19:28] doesn't even see us. He hears our voice
[1:19:32] but he sees the blood of Christ. That's
[1:19:35] it. He sees the blood of his own son.
[1:19:38] It's our voice. It's it's Christ's
[1:19:41] blood. And then it's Christ talking
[1:19:44] through us to God. So therefore, we're
[1:19:47] not sinners anymore. We're Christians. I
[1:19:50] believe you to be a genuine Christian
[1:19:53] woman. Sister Bruce interrupts him and
[1:19:56] says, "I make so many mistakes. I've
[1:19:58] failed so many times." And he says,
[1:20:00] "That's why Christ had to die. So that
[1:20:03] you with your mistakes wouldn't be
[1:20:05] laotted to you." See, he took your
[1:20:08] mistakes. Your desire is to serve him.
[1:20:11] And she said, "Yes." And they said,
[1:20:12] "Well, that's what he died for so you
[1:20:14] could serve him." See, your mistakes are
[1:20:18] not looked, not allotted to. He is your
[1:20:23] perpetuation, which means an atonement.
[1:20:25] He is your sin offering. He your sins
[1:20:29] are not known. You're not a sinner
[1:20:31] before God. Christ took your sins and he
[1:20:34] became you because your desire is to
[1:20:38] serve him. A little later that morning,
[1:20:40] he re referenced that interview. He said
[1:20:43] on the interview a few minutes ago, I
[1:20:46] was speaking to a person in the room
[1:20:48] that's present now, but said, "Brother
[1:20:50] Brandham, I make I have so many things
[1:20:54] that I know that's wrong and a godly
[1:20:57] little woman." And I said, 'But look
[1:20:59] sister, don't look at yourself. It's
[1:21:02] just what your desire is and what you
[1:21:05] try to do. If you really love the Lord,
[1:21:08] you try to serve him with all your heart
[1:21:10] and then all your mistakes is hid in the
[1:21:14] blood of Jesus Christ. Aren't you glad
[1:21:17] to be servants of God like that?
[1:21:21] In the message Satan leading he prays.
[1:21:23] Oh God, help us to be pure in your
[1:21:25] sight. Lord, no matter what man thinks
[1:21:29] about us, what other people say, Lord,
[1:21:32] let it be our conversations be holy. Let
[1:21:35] it be seasoned with God's word. So
[1:21:38] seasonal, Lord, that there's no g found
[1:21:40] in us while we plead in our own mistakes
[1:21:44] that the blood of Jesus Christ will
[1:21:46] stand between us and God. that he'll
[1:21:48] look down upon us through the blood of
[1:21:50] Jesus. Not upon our own on righteousness
[1:21:54] or who we are or what we've done, but
[1:21:56] upon his merits alone, God granted.
[1:22:00] Amen. I I just say today, oh, how we
[1:22:03] still need the blood. It's the blood
[1:22:06] that mediates. It's the blood that
[1:22:09] atones. And as long as the blood is
[1:22:12] atoning, there's no difference between
[1:22:14] Christ and his blood because the blood
[1:22:16] is the life of Christ. Amen. So it's the
[1:22:20] blood that heals. It's the blood that
[1:22:22] saves. And without it, we are lost and
[1:22:26] damned sinners.
[1:22:28] Amen. Now from the trial, Brother
[1:22:30] Brandham me ministered and and you can
[1:22:33] go and listen to great sermons that many
[1:22:36] of them that you can listen to, five
[1:22:38] different ones. But he he just
[1:22:41] established the case is God's word of
[1:22:43] promise versus the world and the
[1:22:46] defendant is God. And Satan is the
[1:22:49] prosecuting attorney and he represents
[1:22:52] the world. And he brings an indictment
[1:22:55] in this trial. The cause for the
[1:22:57] indictment is because of a breach of
[1:23:00] promise. That is that the world claims
[1:23:03] that God made a promise that is not
[1:23:05] true. And now the prosecuting attorney
[1:23:08] has three witnesses. These three
[1:23:11] witnesses are Mr. Unbeliever, Mr.
[1:23:14] Skeptic, and the next one is Mr.
[1:23:17] Impatient. Now, these are witnesses
[1:23:20] against God that God does not keep his
[1:23:23] word and that his word isn't true. And
[1:23:26] you are the jury. You are the one who
[1:23:30] decides for God or against God. You
[1:23:33] decide which one will rule. human
[1:23:36] thinking or God's thinking. And so you
[1:23:40] you you cannot let Satan and and his
[1:23:44] witnesses block your way with unbelief
[1:23:49] or with skepticism or with impatience.
[1:23:52] Remember, these are these are ones that
[1:23:55] will try to block the channel between
[1:23:59] you and God and your access to the
[1:24:03] throne of God. So if he clouds your
[1:24:06] channel with unbelief or skepticism or
[1:24:08] impatience, the Holy Spirit can't bring
[1:24:11] God's blessings down upon you. He's not
[1:24:14] going to bless a skeptic. He's not going
[1:24:17] to bless someone who is and with
[1:24:19] unbelief. God only blesses faith when we
[1:24:23] believe him. God is a rewarder of those
[1:24:27] who diligently seek him with faith.
[1:24:30] Amen. Because he only rewards faith.
[1:24:33] Now, in all of this and moving
[1:24:35] mountains, we've been preaching about
[1:24:37] moving our mountains. And you know, your
[1:24:40] mountain is different from my mountain.
[1:24:42] Your mountain is probably not a literal
[1:24:44] mountain that's in your backyard. If you
[1:24:46] live in Louisiana, we don't have them.
[1:24:48] So, you know, you're not worried about
[1:24:50] trying to get this mountain or getting
[1:24:52] over that physical mountain, but there
[1:24:54] are situations in your life where the
[1:24:57] mountain needs to be moved. Situations
[1:25:00] that need to be changed. And the only
[1:25:03] way you'll ever move the mountains in
[1:25:05] your life is to align yourself with
[1:25:08] God's will. You see, you cannot just do
[1:25:11] it haphazardly or just in the flesh or
[1:25:15] just using mere human words. You got to
[1:25:18] step off of your thinking into God's
[1:25:20] thinking. You got to tap into true
[1:25:23] faith. You see, we must never forget
[1:25:27] this. God's word is
[1:25:31] infallible. It is eternal. It is
[1:25:34] unshakable. It is unchanging. And the
[1:25:38] key to understanding his promises in
[1:25:40] your life is having the right mental
[1:25:44] attitude or the right mindset toward
[1:25:47] them. If you can approach any divine
[1:25:50] promise with the right perspective and
[1:25:52] with unwavering faith, it will come to
[1:25:56] pass. Now, so brother Brandham let us
[1:26:00] know about moving mountains. And you can
[1:26:03] write these things down as you go. And
[1:26:06] and he he let us know the guiding
[1:26:08] principle of his own life because gifted
[1:26:11] as he was, he could not just go do
[1:26:14] whatever he humanly wanted to do. Amen.
[1:26:18] He could not do it. I mean, you say,
[1:26:20] "Well, oh, he he could speak into
[1:26:23] existence." Listen, he couldn't do
[1:26:25] anything until God told him to. He was a
[1:26:28] man, right? Amen. And he was operating
[1:26:32] as a mortal man. And this is not the
[1:26:35] millennium.
[1:26:37] In the millennium, there will be, you
[1:26:39] know, we will dress the earth like Adam
[1:26:42] did the garden, but we're not there yet.
[1:26:44] So, you're not going to have complete
[1:26:46] control of the weather.
[1:26:48] Amen. Or all
[1:26:50] circumstances. But you, what you want to
[1:26:52] do is find the will of God for your life
[1:26:56] and for the mountain that you're facing.
[1:26:58] Some of them God don't want moved.
[1:27:01] Some of them God wants you to go over
[1:27:03] it.
[1:27:06] Amen. Some of them it's going to be a
[1:27:08] struggle.
[1:27:10] Amen. God doesn't he doesn't just move
[1:27:12] every mountain. But there are mountains
[1:27:15] he moves. And brother Brandon said
[1:27:18] before anything I seek to know is this
[1:27:21] the will of God? Now we know many things
[1:27:24] is the will of God. Divine healing is
[1:27:26] the will of God. Amen. Amen. But there
[1:27:29] comes a time in life when when even for
[1:27:32] divine healing is not his will for in
[1:27:34] this mortal realm it's his will for that
[1:27:36] person to be healed in the next
[1:27:38] dimension.
[1:27:40] So you see is this the will of God? If I
[1:27:42] know it's his will that's step number
[1:27:46] one. Next I examine my heart. What is my
[1:27:51] objective? You see is my is my motive
[1:27:55] right? Then so then that's my my next
[1:27:58] one. I check my motive. Why am I doing
[1:28:02] this? And if it's God's will and if my
[1:28:06] objective is to glorify him, if my
[1:28:08] motive is pure, giving him all the
[1:28:11] glory, then I can stand in full faith
[1:28:14] that it will be done. But if there's
[1:28:17] selfish
[1:28:18] ambition, if it my my goal is for
[1:28:22] personal gain, for
[1:28:24] self-promotion, for wealth, then I know
[1:28:27] it won't work. If I'm pushing forward in
[1:28:30] something that is outside of God's will,
[1:28:32] it's going to fail from the start. True
[1:28:35] faith only operates in the divine
[1:28:38] channel of God's will.
[1:28:41] Now there is a human faith and then
[1:28:45] there is the faith of God and the two
[1:28:48] are not the same.
[1:28:51] Now to walk in divine faith you must
[1:28:55] have the will of
[1:28:57] God which is the mind of Christ
[1:29:00] operating in you. That's the key. Let
[1:29:03] this mind that was in Christ be in you.
[1:29:08] Amen. which was let this mind be in you
[1:29:11] which was also in Christ Jesus. That's
[1:29:13] Philippians 2:5. When his mind is in
[1:29:16] you, then you receive divine
[1:29:20] direction. And when his mind is in you,
[1:29:22] he reveals his will and and it can be in
[1:29:26] many different ways. It could be by
[1:29:28] visions, revelation, divine
[1:29:29] understanding, but he reveals himself.
[1:29:32] When his mind is in you, your faith is
[1:29:35] no li no longer limited to human reason.
[1:29:39] It is energized then by the very power
[1:29:41] of God itself.
[1:29:44] Now, so you do you see what we're
[1:29:46] talking about this morning is the secret
[1:29:49] to mountain moving faith is alignment of
[1:29:54] with God's will and a heart that is
[1:29:57] fully surrendered to his glory. And when
[1:30:00] you step into that realm, nothing is
[1:30:03] impossible. For without God or with God,
[1:30:07] there is nothing impossible. Amen. And
[1:30:10] when you have that faith, that
[1:30:12] revelation from God, nothing's
[1:30:14] impossible with you. So now, as we think
[1:30:18] on these things, I want to just kind of
[1:30:21] progress into this this morning. Let's
[1:30:24] let's go in our thinking to our
[1:30:25] scriptures that we have been uh
[1:30:28] pondering over and expounding upon in
[1:30:30] the last few weeks like in Ephesians 6
[1:30:35] where he tells us uh in verse 10.
[1:30:38] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[1:30:40] Lord and in the power of his might. Put
[1:30:43] on the whole armor of God. Well, what do
[1:30:45] you need an armor for if you're not
[1:30:46] going to fight? And where are you going
[1:30:48] to fight? Amen. You're going to fight as
[1:30:51] you ascend this channel.
[1:30:53] as you ascend toward the throne and the
[1:30:56] accuser is going to stand there and he's
[1:30:58] going to boldly oppose you. Listen, this
[1:31:02] rascal, he will oppose God himself. He's
[1:31:05] bold. He's arrogant. Amen. If he'll
[1:31:09] oppose God, he'll oppose his bride from
[1:31:11] ascending to his presence. Amen. So, you
[1:31:14] put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:31:16] may stand against the ws of the devil.
[1:31:19] Our our battle is not against flesh and
[1:31:22] blood, but it's against principalities,
[1:31:24] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:31:27] darkness of this world. It's against
[1:31:29] spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.
[1:31:31] So the higher you walk in God, Amen. the
[1:31:35] more you're going to be opposed, the
[1:31:36] devil ain't going to bother you very
[1:31:38] much if you if you're not bothering him.
[1:31:42] But the moment you start to try to
[1:31:44] ascend into your position of sunship as
[1:31:48] an adopted son or daughter of God,
[1:31:51] that's where the devil's going to bring
[1:31:53] all of hell against you. He'll scream,
[1:31:56] he'll howl, he'll yell, but he's
[1:31:58] powerless.
[1:32:00] He cannot stop you. You can prevail.
[1:32:04] Amen. So take the whole armor of God
[1:32:06] that you may be able to withstand in the
[1:32:08] evil day and and having done all to
[1:32:13] stand. So here is the commandment of St.
[1:32:16] Paul who is telling us these things. And
[1:32:18] of course you know he he knows that
[1:32:21] Christian is going to be in battle.
[1:32:24] You're going to battle until you leave
[1:32:26] from here. Your battle fronts may
[1:32:29] change. It could change from from youth
[1:32:32] and maybe in in youth it could be a lot
[1:32:35] of different things. The pursuit of
[1:32:37] wealth or happiness or this or that the
[1:32:39] other. You you could have other other
[1:32:41] things that you're pursuing. When when
[1:32:44] you're older, you're pursuing your
[1:32:45] health, trying to hang on to being well
[1:32:48] and and everything else. That's where
[1:32:50] your battle is. And Satan will cause
[1:32:52] storms and winds of strife to disturb
[1:32:56] your human nature because he holds the
[1:33:00] kingdoms of this world. And he'll even
[1:33:03] stir up chaos and strife and cause great
[1:33:06] suffering in all the world. Amen. What's
[1:33:09] he doing that for? To try to keep you
[1:33:13] depressed and disbelieving.
[1:33:16] Trying to hold off the blessings of God
[1:33:18] from your life. Now we know that he told
[1:33:21] us that the weapons of our warfare are
[1:33:24] not of flesh but but they have divine
[1:33:27] power to break down strongholds. Now
[1:33:31] listen, he could not see he could not
[1:33:34] say whereby you will be able to
[1:33:36] withstand the ws of the devil if you
[1:33:39] wasn't going to have a battle and if you
[1:33:40] wasn't going to overcome. The word has
[1:33:43] already declared you victorious.
[1:33:47] Reading in the scripture today, we
[1:33:50] already see he prevailed not. So you
[1:33:54] have to go in the battle knowing I am
[1:33:57] going to win. I will not lose this
[1:34:00] battle.
[1:34:02] Amen. Well, I may lose a battle now and
[1:34:04] then, but I ain't going to lose the war.
[1:34:07] Amen. I will overcome. I will rise above
[1:34:12] this.
[1:34:17] You got to decide that if you're just
[1:34:18] starting out and you got all kinds of
[1:34:21] habits hanging on you of dope and
[1:34:23] alcohol and tobacco and everything else,
[1:34:25] you got to stand right there and
[1:34:27] declare, "I will no longer be
[1:34:29] subservient to this. I will no longer be
[1:34:33] subject to it anymore. It will not rule
[1:34:35] over my life. Today is a different day.
[1:34:38] Today I'm taking I'm putting on the
[1:34:40] armor of God, taking the sword of the
[1:34:42] word. I'm advancing Amen.
[1:34:46] And it doesn't matter if you've been a
[1:34:47] Christian for 50 years. You got to do
[1:34:51] the same. Your battle is still there.
[1:34:55] Amen. And Satan comes against us with
[1:34:57] arguments, with reasoning, waring
[1:35:00] against our mind, doing everything to
[1:35:03] change our atmosphere from one of faith
[1:35:06] to an atmosphere of
[1:35:09] doubt or fear or or failure. You see,
[1:35:13] he'll clog our channel to keep us from
[1:35:16] God's
[1:35:18] presence. I go back, you know, to Elisha
[1:35:22] the prophet, who was a prophet of God, a
[1:35:25] man gifted of God. A gift is a channel
[1:35:28] through which God can work. Amen. Now,
[1:35:32] you know, there there's some channels
[1:35:34] that are real real small and and but
[1:35:36] they're channels. There's larger
[1:35:39] channels where more of the spirit can
[1:35:42] flow. You say, "Well, how did it happen
[1:35:44] that way?" Well, some men can yield
[1:35:46] themselves to God more than other men.
[1:35:49] Amen. They're but they're all channels
[1:35:52] and God can speak through them and can
[1:35:54] speak in them and and flow through that.
[1:35:58] And but however, no matter who we are,
[1:36:01] the channels can get clogged. They can
[1:36:04] get stopped up. They can be hindered.
[1:36:07] where the spirit of God cannot descend
[1:36:10] and and and the blessings of God flow.
[1:36:13] So, you know, we we want to understand
[1:36:16] now, you know, that if these channels
[1:36:18] get clogged, we got to clear them out.
[1:36:21] Amen. Whatever it is that is hindering
[1:36:24] you in your walk with God, you got to
[1:36:27] figure it out. You got to say, "Well, I
[1:36:29] need a closer walk." Well, what's
[1:36:30] keeping you from that closer walk? Amen.
[1:36:33] It ain't just saying, "I need, will you
[1:36:34] pray for me? I'll have a closer walk."
[1:36:36] No, you deal with the issue
[1:36:39] of what is keeping you from having that
[1:36:41] closer walk. Amen. Where is it? A lack
[1:36:45] of commitment. Are you not coming to
[1:36:46] church? Are you not being faithful? Or,
[1:36:49] you know, is there something is
[1:36:50] somewhere you're letting down on your
[1:36:52] prayer life? What is it?
[1:36:55] Something's hindering it. And you got to
[1:36:58] figure it out. You got to go talk it
[1:36:59] over with God and say, "What is it?
[1:37:01] Examine my heart. Let me examine it.
[1:37:06] Maybe it's just not putting God first.
[1:37:10] Maybe he's on the back burner
[1:37:12] somewhere. Maybe it's a lukewarm
[1:37:14] attitude toward him. A lukewarmness, a
[1:37:17] lukewarm attitude toward church. Some of
[1:37:19] you right now are listening to me and
[1:37:21] God bless you. You're streaming and and
[1:37:24] it's justified. There's a reason that
[1:37:26] you're there. But there's other of you
[1:37:27] are too lazy to get out of bed and get
[1:37:30] out of your house robe and get into
[1:37:31] church.
[1:37:33] Shame on you that you're not here in the
[1:37:34] presence of God this morning with the
[1:37:36] saints.
[1:37:37] Well, I'm too grown up for that. I'm too
[1:37:41] I'm too I'm an adult in Christ. I don't
[1:37:43] need that. That's a church is for
[1:37:45] babies. Well, then if you're such an
[1:37:46] adult, how come you ain't here to help
[1:37:48] the babies grow?
[1:37:53] It shows how infant you really are.
[1:37:56] Amen. I I know you don't want me to
[1:37:59] preach that.
[1:38:00] So, thank you, brother Johnny. Brother
[1:38:03] Johnny. Brother Johnny just retired from
[1:38:05] his job. God bless you, brother Johnny.
[1:38:07] Faithful years of serving the Lord there
[1:38:09] in his job. Man, what a blessing you've
[1:38:12] been to us here at Evening Light. God
[1:38:14] bless you. Here to encourage me this
[1:38:16] morning. Look at there. Amen. Even a man
[1:38:19] pulled him out of retirement. He ain't
[1:38:21] retired from serving God.
[1:38:23] Amen. But anyway, Satan comes against us
[1:38:26] with with arguments and reasoning and
[1:38:29] and and and
[1:38:31] and
[1:38:32] events happen and this happened with
[1:38:35] Elisha the prophet, you know, he got a
[1:38:38] visitation one day from a couple of
[1:38:41] kings and one of them was Jehoshaphat
[1:38:44] was a righteous king of of Judah and
[1:38:48] then there was a uh Jehoram which was uh
[1:38:52] an unrighteous king, a son of Ahab. They
[1:38:54] were wicked people servants of serve
[1:38:57] Baal and you know had done many things
[1:39:00] killed God's prophets and did many many
[1:39:03] awful things a lot of atrocities that
[1:39:05] happened with his even his mother
[1:39:07] Jezebel and all of these things and you
[1:39:11] know Elisha had no use for him.
[1:39:18] Amen. He had never shown that he ever
[1:39:21] had any
[1:39:23] sincerity. And here he was approaching
[1:39:26] God because their
[1:39:27] armies where they had went out to fight
[1:39:30] go to fight a battle. They were
[1:39:31] perishing because of thirst.
[1:39:35] And now they get in trouble. And of
[1:39:38] course, you want God's help now
[1:39:42] after you haven't served him and you
[1:39:44] haven't done right and you've killed his
[1:39:46] prophets and you you you've you've
[1:39:48] desecrated his temple and you've done
[1:39:50] all these things and be honest with you,
[1:39:53] it made Elisha mad.
[1:39:56] Okay? You know, you won't come to serve
[1:39:58] the Lord in good times, but in bad times
[1:40:02] here, you want to show up to the house
[1:40:04] of God.
[1:40:06] And now you want me to help you out.
[1:40:09] Kind of way sometimes my attitude about
[1:40:11] some
[1:40:13] people that wants to come to you from
[1:40:15] marriage counseling and you want they
[1:40:17] want you to fix in 30 minutes what they
[1:40:19] tore up and ruined in 25 years.
[1:40:24] You know cuz
[1:40:27] I sometimes have to do the same thing
[1:40:29] like
[1:40:30] Elisha and get brother Tim under control
[1:40:33] first.
[1:40:38] And Elisha, you know, the prophet, it
[1:40:40] took him a while to get in the spirit.
[1:40:44] You know, sometimes you wonder what it
[1:40:46] take so long and how come so many songs
[1:40:48] and you know why why why in the service
[1:40:51] like this and you know, oh my when will
[1:40:54] there be a break forth of the spirit?
[1:40:56] Well, sometimes people are just too they
[1:40:58] come to church too out of sort, too full
[1:41:02] of the of their experiences in the world
[1:41:05] and the the problems that they have
[1:41:07] faced and everything else
[1:41:10] and they're all out of sorts and they
[1:41:12] come to the house of God and the first
[1:41:13] thing you got to do is get them in the
[1:41:15] spirit. That's why we have singing
[1:41:18] before we come and that's why the
[1:41:19] worship is it ain't to entertain you.
[1:41:23] It's so the spirit of God can move
[1:41:25] through the songs because there's a
[1:41:27] message in those songs and the spirit
[1:41:29] follows those songs and and it's and it
[1:41:31] soothes the spirit and it calms you down
[1:41:33] and and it lifts you up then in the
[1:41:35] spirit and you start getting ready to
[1:41:37] receive the word when it comes.
[1:41:41] And Elisha the prophet, it took him a
[1:41:43] while to get in the spirit. His channel
[1:41:46] was all clogged up with indignation. My
[1:41:48] goodness. You know, Jehoshaphat, I I
[1:41:51] tell you what, you brought him You
[1:41:54] brought him. I tell you, I I wouldn't
[1:41:56] even I wouldn't even give him an
[1:41:57] audience if it wasn't for you.
[1:42:02] His mother ought to spit in his face. He
[1:42:05] ain't worth he ain't worth my time. And
[1:42:08] Elisha was all out of sorts. Now, he was
[1:42:12] a gift. He was a channel through which
[1:42:16] heaven could come down and they could
[1:42:18] hear from God but full of indignation
[1:42:21] and
[1:42:22] anger, you know, about about that son of
[1:42:26] Ahab who served other gods who now
[1:42:29] wanted a word from Jehovah after
[1:42:31] belittling and disregarding God and his
[1:42:33] prophet and slaying many of the
[1:42:35] prophets. And he said, "If I didn't
[1:42:38] respect Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even
[1:42:41] look at you.
[1:42:43] He was all stood there stirred up. His
[1:42:45] temper got
[1:42:46] up and he said, "Just tell you
[1:42:51] what, better bring me a minstrel. I'm
[1:42:55] all out of sorts. Get somebody to sing
[1:42:58] some good gospel
[1:43:00] songs. Kind of soothe me down a little
[1:43:02] bit." You know, I I'll tell you what.
[1:43:05] You
[1:43:06] know, why why why did he want a
[1:43:08] minstrel? Why do you want to sing or
[1:43:10] sing in some songs? maybe playing a
[1:43:13] heart, but close when you're angry or
[1:43:16] when your emotions are all worked up
[1:43:18] with just life.
[1:43:22] Amen. Or with temper or impatience or
[1:43:25] even maybe sometimes
[1:43:27] skepticism. Your channels are all
[1:43:29] clogged up and and you need something to
[1:43:32] soo you down
[1:43:35] just to settle you down where you can
[1:43:37] hear the voice of God. Amen.
[1:43:41] Now, Brother Brandham talked about this
[1:43:43] in Elijah and Elisha. He said, "I was
[1:43:46] talking to a man not long ago that
[1:43:48] didn't believe in music in the church."
[1:43:51] He's only wanted to fuss with me about
[1:43:53] it. Said, he said, "Music belongs to the
[1:43:55] world." I said, "The spirit of God
[1:43:57] didn't come on that stood up prophet
[1:43:59] until he got a minstrel out and began to
[1:44:01] play a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[1:44:02] song." And the spirit of God came down
[1:44:05] on the prophet. And that's that's right.
[1:44:07] God doesn't change. If God liked music
[1:44:09] in that day, God likes music today.
[1:44:12] And he began to play a song. He said, "I
[1:44:15] don't know what they played in those
[1:44:16] day, but I imagine it was a good old
[1:44:19] song like there's going to be a meeting
[1:44:21] in the air in the sweet, sweet by and by
[1:44:24] and all you unbelievers won't be over
[1:44:27] there. Glory to God in the high." Amen.
[1:44:32] You know, he's he's half in and half
[1:44:34] out, but he's he's listening to this
[1:44:36] music, you know. Amen. And and and you
[1:44:39] say, "Well, Brother Tim, that song,
[1:44:41] yeah, it was a Jubilee Pentecostal song.
[1:44:44] It was it was contemporary for the time.
[1:44:47] You know, it would been written about 30
[1:44:49] years before. So, you know, it was and
[1:44:52] and and brother Brandham pitched that
[1:44:54] one out and he said, "Now, that's one
[1:44:56] that would really start moving you in
[1:44:58] the spirit.
[1:45:00] Amen. And he said the spirit came on the
[1:45:04] prophet. And he said, "I tell you,
[1:45:06] brother, when we get all the formal
[1:45:08] shackles shook down and the spirit of
[1:45:11] God in the songs again and get back to
[1:45:15] an old place where we can have the
[1:45:16] spirit of God moving in the place, then
[1:45:19] the prophet can see the vision. Then the
[1:45:22] powers of God comes on the church. Then
[1:45:24] they can see divine healing. Then they
[1:45:26] can see the resurrection of Christ. Then
[1:45:28] they can see he's the same yesterday,
[1:45:30] today, and forever. And you say, "Well,
[1:45:32] brother Bradam, I'm not the prophet."
[1:45:34] Well, if you're not the prophet, then
[1:45:37] you can be the instruments anyhow. Just
[1:45:39] keep playing. You ain't got no more than
[1:45:42] them 10.
[1:45:44] Just give vent to that just as hard as
[1:45:46] you can. If you can't be the prophet, be
[1:45:51] a part of the minstrels. do something to
[1:45:55] bring the spirit of the Lord down. Now
[1:45:59] listen church, that is the job of every
[1:46:02] one of us when we come to the house of
[1:46:05] God. Maybe you're not the preacher.
[1:46:07] You're not the prophet, the New
[1:46:09] Testament prophet in the pullpit, but
[1:46:11] you but you are part of the minstrel.
[1:46:15] Maybe you're not on the piano. Maybe
[1:46:17] you're not on the organ. Maybe you're
[1:46:18] not on the drums, but I you know, maybe
[1:46:21] you're just out there. But do something.
[1:46:24] Enter in. Amen. Be a part of the
[1:46:28] minstrel to bring the spirit of God
[1:46:31] down.
[1:46:32] And then when the spirit comes, then he
[1:46:36] can minister through the channel.
[1:46:39] Amen. He can minister through the gift
[1:46:41] of God. And then you will see divine
[1:46:44] healing. Then you will see souls saved.
[1:46:47] Then you will see miracles in the
[1:46:49] church. When we get in the spirit.
[1:46:59] Hallelujah. When the prophet and the
[1:47:01] harmony God and the people got in
[1:47:03] harmony with God, the prophet began to
[1:47:06] see things. Now, brother, if you don't
[1:47:10] see divine healing and you don't see the
[1:47:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you don't
[1:47:15] see this mighty move of the spirit of
[1:47:17] God moving in the last stage here, just
[1:47:20] get in the spirit one time and you will
[1:47:23] see things will be revealed to you. Then
[1:47:26] you'll begin to notice things looking
[1:47:29] different what they used to be. That's
[1:47:31] right. You won't go along with
[1:47:32] criticizing spirits. You'll come back
[1:47:35] humbly.
[1:47:37] That's right. He said, "Oh, I'm kind of
[1:47:38] feeling religious myself."
[1:47:41] Amen. Now, so you see, God gave a word
[1:47:47] to the prophet once he got in the
[1:47:50] spirit. And you know what that word was
[1:47:53] in that day? It was, "Go dig the valley
[1:47:57] full of
[1:47:58] ditches." In other words, make a channel
[1:48:02] for the Holy Spirit to flow through.
[1:48:06] Amen. If you want water,
[1:48:10] make a place for it.
[1:48:13] If you want the Holy Ghost, get the
[1:48:16] things out of your life that is filling
[1:48:19] you up with every other things and make
[1:48:22] a place for the Holy Ghost to fill. Come
[1:48:25] on. If you want divine healing, come on.
[1:48:28] You're going to have to get the unbelief
[1:48:30] out, what the doctor said out, what
[1:48:33] everybody else thinks out, and see what
[1:48:36] God's word said.
[1:48:39] Amen. Make a valley full of ditches.
[1:48:43] Make a channel full for where the Holy
[1:48:46] Spirit would flow. So if you want the
[1:48:49] power of God, if you want the
[1:48:51] supernatural move, if you want to walk
[1:48:54] in revelation, if you want authority and
[1:48:57] victory, make room.
[1:49:00] That's it. It's just that simple.
[1:49:05] Now get in the
[1:49:07] spirit. Oh yeah. You know, you ain't
[1:49:11] going to make room just sitting in the
[1:49:14] doldrums.
[1:49:16] You're going to have to get in the
[1:49:17] spirit.
[1:49:18] Amen. You're going to have to begin to
[1:49:21] rejoice.
[1:49:23] You're going to have to shout. You're
[1:49:25] going to have to start triumphing over
[1:49:27] the enemy. And when you do, your cup
[1:49:29] will underflow overflow. And and but
[1:49:32] only if there's a channel for it to pour
[1:49:34] into. The more room you make, the more
[1:49:36] water of the spirit that you will have.
[1:49:38] So you're going to have to dig dig dig.
[1:49:45] Notice Elisha didn't tell him said go
[1:49:48] sharpen your swords. He didn't say ah go
[1:49:52] train your your soldiers better you know
[1:49:55] get get them you know I'll tell you what
[1:49:56] give them an education you know in in
[1:49:59] the word and get them to understand. No
[1:50:01] he said he didn't tell them polish up
[1:50:03] your theology. He said, "Go to get to
[1:50:06] digging."
[1:50:08] And you dig until you find the rock.
[1:50:12] Cuz the rock is still here. The same
[1:50:15] rock that Moses struck. The same rock
[1:50:19] that water poured out in the wilderness
[1:50:21] is still in the place. That rock was
[1:50:23] Christ. And you got to dig through the
[1:50:26] dry crusted over religious debris to get
[1:50:30] through it.
[1:50:32] Amen. You got to say, "What is it that's
[1:50:35] blocking the flow?" Amen. I got to dig
[1:50:38] down till I find Christ again.
[1:50:41] Amen. I'm all out of sorts. I I've had
[1:50:44] this problem. Uh unbelief is here.
[1:50:47] Skepticism is there and impatience is
[1:50:50] there. I I've got to dig out
[1:50:54] until the Holy Spirit can flow. I've got
[1:50:56] to get back to the rock.
[1:50:59] That's what the church needs today. We
[1:51:01] need to get back to Christ more than
[1:51:02] ever. Somebody help me preach. Amen. We
[1:51:06] need a refilling of the Holy Ghost, an
[1:51:09] outpouring of his Holy Spirit. We need
[1:51:12] to get to the rock.
[1:51:17] What's blocking the flow? The blessings
[1:51:20] of God aren't absent. The channels are
[1:51:23] just clogged.
[1:51:25] Start digging. You get the obstacles out
[1:51:27] of the way. You you throw out that
[1:51:30] rotten log of unbelief.
[1:51:33] That lie that says days of miracles are
[1:51:35] passed. Ain't nothing been happening and
[1:51:38] ain't nothing going to happen. That's
[1:51:40] blocking the flow.
[1:51:42] You rip out the the log of religious
[1:51:44] tradition that system that says the Holy
[1:51:47] Ghost ain't for today. Amen. It's not
[1:51:49] like it was in the book of Acts. We're
[1:51:51] not there anymore. You see, that's
[1:51:53] stopping up the flow. Amen. You burn
[1:51:56] that dead log of theology, that false
[1:51:59] teaching that say we don't get the Holy
[1:52:01] Ghost like they got in the book of Acts.
[1:52:04] That's only a temporary gift. No, it's
[1:52:06] only temporary if you're not seed. But
[1:52:08] if you're seed, the Holy Ghost is the
[1:52:10] very light that quickens you. It seals
[1:52:13] you to the day of redemption. And when
[1:52:15] the spirit of God quickens you, you will
[1:52:18] never be the same.
[1:52:22] For you're sealed to the day of
[1:52:24] redemption. and ignite it with his
[1:52:26] divine power.
[1:52:29] So dig, make room for the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:33] Throw out every hindrance. The Holy
[1:52:36] Spirit is ready to flow, but you got to
[1:52:38] clear the way. The rock is waiting, but
[1:52:41] you got to remove the barriers. You got
[1:52:43] to tap into the flood. Amen. remember to
[1:52:47] come out of there, out of that rock,
[1:52:50] enough water, not a
[1:52:52] trickle, but enough water to to water 2
[1:52:56] million people and their livestock.
[1:53:00] Friends, I tell you, I I don't think
[1:53:03] we've seen but just a trickle. There's a
[1:53:06] whole guster waiting to be open.
[1:53:09] Amen. You got to find yourself digging
[1:53:12] and and and and get in there. And if you
[1:53:14] throw a log, throw it out. If you say,
[1:53:18] "Well, baptism of the Holy Ghost ain't
[1:53:20] for us today, and we don't get it the
[1:53:22] same way." That's a slimy old mossy log.
[1:53:25] It's been around for years and years.
[1:53:28] Amen. Throw the thing out.
[1:53:31] I don't care. It may be petrified and
[1:53:33] you think it's valuable, but get rid of
[1:53:35] the log.
[1:53:37] Amen. I want to give you a shovel.
[1:53:40] Sometimes we need a shovel. We have h we
[1:53:43] have a word of God. These are tools.
[1:53:44] These are shovels. Dr. Simon Peter said
[1:53:47] on the day of Pentecost. It's for you.
[1:53:50] It is for your children. It is for them
[1:53:53] that are far off. It's for as many as
[1:53:55] our Lord our God shall call. I'll tell
[1:53:57] you what. What you need to do is go to
[1:53:59] digging and bring heaven down. for your
[1:54:02] lost loved ones this morning realizing
[1:54:04] you've got a promise but you take that
[1:54:06] shovel of the word of God and you
[1:54:09] uncover it till you get to the rock.
[1:54:15] Oh yeah, let me give you another and
[1:54:17] they shall be there and their offspring
[1:54:19] with
[1:54:20] them. Let me give you another. Believe
[1:54:22] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and
[1:54:25] thy house shall be
[1:54:27] saved. Hallelujah. You take the sele of
[1:54:30] the word of God. Get rid of that long of
[1:54:33] unbelief and start believing God's word
[1:54:37] for you, for your family, for your
[1:54:39] children, for the church, for Christ.
[1:54:51] So, I can bring heaven down for my loved
[1:54:54] ones. Well, that's what the little
[1:54:55] sister did in Memphis.
[1:54:58] She might have been poor living in the
[1:55:01] hood.
[1:55:03] She might have even had a very sinful
[1:55:05] past. You know, we none of us was always
[1:55:08] Christians. We weren't born that way.
[1:55:10] Every one of us needed saving. Amen. She
[1:55:14] But she dug past all of that. She used a
[1:55:17] shovel.
[1:55:18] You know, she found a shovel and the
[1:55:20] Bible said, "There in the Bible is me.
[1:55:24] There's a Shinomite woman.
[1:55:27] Amen. I couldn't have a baby and you
[1:55:30] gave me a baby and now it's dying.
[1:55:34] Where is your Elisha?
[1:55:36] Amen. I got to get to the rock cuz my
[1:55:40] boy is dying without Christ. Oh no, she
[1:55:43] wasn't interested in healing. She's
[1:55:45] interested in salvation. And brother,
[1:55:47] she brought heaven down.
[1:55:50] I'm telling you literally. Amen. She
[1:55:53] brought heaven down. the the the very
[1:55:56] plane itself was called out of the
[1:55:59] skies. Amen. Drove down by storms that
[1:56:02] she had prayed up,
[1:56:05] stopped the plane there in Memphis and
[1:56:07] held it on the ground till that prophet
[1:56:10] walked out of that plane out into a a
[1:56:14] hotel room and out of that hotel room
[1:56:16] and walking by the spirit led right down
[1:56:19] to her house.
[1:56:21] Hallelujah. She'd been praying all night
[1:56:24] digging.
[1:56:27] Oh, I wonder if people are willing to
[1:56:29] dig. I wonder if people are willing to
[1:56:31] pray through. I wonder if people really
[1:56:34] want revival in their heart till the
[1:56:36] Holy Spirit can come down and change
[1:56:40] lives and
[1:56:43] atmospheres. But that woman brought
[1:56:46] heaven down.
[1:56:49] Brought a channel right to her house.
[1:56:52] Hallelujah. That we could pray the
[1:56:54] prayer of faith. Bring the boy to his
[1:56:56] consciousness. Lead him to Christ. Get
[1:56:59] back on a plane as held down until he
[1:57:02] got back on it. Last call to
[1:57:04] Jeffersonville.
[1:57:08] Hallelujah. God knows how to save right
[1:57:11] in the nick of time. He did it with the
[1:57:13] Hebrew children. He'll do it for you.
[1:57:15] Amen. Your miracle ain't three minutes
[1:57:18] away. It's right now. It ain't years and
[1:57:20] years and years away. You can have it
[1:57:22] now. The promise is unto
[1:57:28] you. Well, it's just not the season
[1:57:31] anymore for the divine healing. Brother
[1:57:34] Tim, you know, I tell you what, you get
[1:57:36] that rotten log out. It's so old. I got
[1:57:40] slime all over it. It's obstructed the
[1:57:42] flow of the spirit through the ages. Let
[1:57:45] me give you a shovel to get it out. He
[1:57:48] is the same yesterday, today and
[1:57:52] forever. I am the Lord thy God and I
[1:57:54] change not. I heal all diseases.
[1:58:03] Logs of creeds, logs of men's fetal
[1:58:06] philosophies, they stop at the flow of
[1:58:08] the spirit. What do you do about it?
[1:58:11] Clean the channel out. Get it where the
[1:58:13] water can flow. Well, the water ain't
[1:58:15] flowing. Well, make room for it. for it
[1:58:18] comes.
[1:58:20] Before you even strike the rock, make
[1:58:22] room for it. Come
[1:58:25] on. You see, Christ is the same
[1:58:28] yesterday, today, and forever. That
[1:58:31] smitten rock was in the wilderness and
[1:58:32] it's still here. You see, it's it's it's
[1:58:37] God. Christ was that rock. Remember in
[1:58:40] the days of Abra or Isaac rather the
[1:58:43] Bible says in Genesis
[1:58:46] 12:15 that you know Abraham had went
[1:58:51] through the land and everywhere did he
[1:58:53] place and he built an altar he had a
[1:58:55] well
[1:58:57] there's important to have a well
[1:59:01] it's important to have water.
[1:59:04] Come on. Amen. And and he didn't just
[1:59:07] have an altar and a dead confession, but
[1:59:11] everywhere that he went and he had an
[1:59:13] altar, he dug a well.
[1:59:18] But you know, later comes along the
[1:59:20] Philistines, the same ones that
[1:59:22] threatened David and the key Israel
[1:59:24] there. And the and the Philistines had
[1:59:28] stopped them up and filled them up with
[1:59:31] earth. Ain't that like the devil?
[1:59:35] God sent a move of God and the devil
[1:59:37] comes along, throws a bunch of rocks and
[1:59:40] stones and sticks and logs and dirt.
[1:59:44] Nobody can drink from it. Why do you
[1:59:46] think they can't drink fresh water no
[1:59:48] more from Luther?
[1:59:51] Why? Why, Wesley? Why? Why is it not
[1:59:53] even a stagnated stream? It's it's it's
[1:59:56] a broken system holds no water. It's a
[1:59:58] dry and a thirsty land. It's barren now.
[2:00:03] Amen. You see, the Philistines had
[2:00:06] dropped them up and the filled them up
[2:00:09] and the and Isaiah 12 says that with joy
[2:00:12] you will draw the waters of the well of
[2:00:16] salvation.
[2:00:18] And there's just no joy in a stopped up
[2:00:21] well.
[2:00:23] Amen. David prayed, "Restore to me the
[2:00:26] joy of thy salvation."
[2:00:30] Amen.
[2:00:32] I tell you what, we need some joy today.
[2:00:35] Remember, it ain't even our salvation.
[2:00:37] It's his salvation. He's the one that
[2:00:40] provided. He's the one that saved us.
[2:00:44] But you get that
[2:00:46] way. I see it so many times in
[2:00:49] Christians. They just become dried
[2:00:52] up,
[2:00:54] sticky, like a plant out in the desert,
[2:00:57] a kaka.
[2:00:59] little leaf is all folded up and rolled
[2:01:01] up into a sticker.
[2:01:03] Everything, you know, is, you know,
[2:01:05] sticking. Ain't nobody happy about
[2:01:09] nothing. Service is too
[2:01:11] long. Preaching is too
[2:01:14] short. The guy here don't preach long
[2:01:17] enough. No, the preacher was short. He
[2:01:18] preaches too
[2:01:19] long. Kind of got it mixed up. But you
[2:01:23] see, I mean, you know, they get all
[2:01:24] spiny and everything. But but you see,
[2:01:28] you know, David said, "Restore unto me
[2:01:30] the joy of thy salvation."
[2:01:35] How many Christians, message believers,
[2:01:38] genuinely filled with the Holy Ghost,
[2:01:41] have no joy in their lives?
[2:01:44] Satan's done robbed the joy out of them.
[2:01:45] How many churches are sitting around
[2:01:47] dead as morgs this morning, claiming the
[2:01:50] message? Genuine people, lovely people,
[2:01:53] but their joy is gone.
[2:02:00] Brother Brandon spoke about this in
[2:02:02] restoration of the bride tree. You know
[2:02:04] when he talked about the canker worm,
[2:02:06] the palmer worm, the locust, the
[2:02:07] caterpillar. What did it done to the
[2:02:09] church?
[2:02:11] It laid all the gifts of the spirit off.
[2:02:14] It took away the Holy Ghost. It took
[2:02:16] away, you know, it just gnawed down the
[2:02:18] church till it was a stump.
[2:02:22] He said, "Here come a little palm of
[2:02:24] worms." You know, it's small and sneaky
[2:02:26] and deadly. You know, sometimes
[2:02:29] overnight them pests can
[2:02:32] come and and what's it do? It starts
[2:02:35] knowing away. The palmer worms started
[2:02:37] knowing away at the fruit of joy. And
[2:02:41] that joy that used to bubble up from the
[2:02:43] soul of fire of souls that used to be on
[2:02:47] fire for
[2:02:48] God. That joy that used to make hands to
[2:02:52] clap and feet to dance and mouths to
[2:02:54] cry. Hallelujah. And amen. With no
[2:02:58] shame.
[2:03:00] Amen. Ain't no shame on me. I'm glad to
[2:03:04] serve the Lord. I mean, that's the way
[2:03:05] they used to be. But what happens now?
[2:03:08] Amen. Look out. Cuz now the voice of the
[2:03:11] palmer worm sneaks in. Hear slithers in
[2:03:15] that old ancient serpent called the
[2:03:16] devil and Satan. Now you folks are just
[2:03:19] too
[2:03:20] noisy. That shouting praise it's
[2:03:23] unnecessary. That crying rejoicing. Ah
[2:03:26] that's just emotionalism.
[2:03:30] Well
[2:03:32] hey my wife died. I was emotional and
[2:03:35] cried. I had babies born. I was
[2:03:38] emotional
[2:03:40] laugh. Something good happens, something
[2:03:42] bad happens. We have emotions.
[2:03:46] Come on. Emotions are normal. They're
[2:03:48] natural. When the spirit of God moves,
[2:03:51] it makes you emotional.
[2:03:54] Amen. It makes you to rejoice. You might
[2:03:57] cry. You might shout. I don't know. You
[2:03:58] might dance. I, you know, there's no
[2:04:01] certain dictate to what you're going to
[2:04:02] do. Amen. But you see, you see, it's not
[2:04:06] just emotionalism. We're not emotional
[2:04:08] because we're emotional.
[2:04:11] We're emotional because something
[2:04:12] happened. I was emotional because my
[2:04:14] wife died. I was emotional because a
[2:04:16] child was born. Something happened. And
[2:04:19] when the spirit of God moves on you, you
[2:04:20] get emotional cuz something happened.
[2:04:24] It's just that simple. But you see
[2:04:27] again, you know, they the that that was
[2:04:29] just a lie that the church and from
[2:04:31] there the church began to die slowly,
[2:04:35] quietly, suddenly and the joy was choked
[2:04:38] off
[2:04:39] until it was just like a like it was
[2:04:42] this morning, you know, when the
[2:04:45] temperatures changed and in my house it
[2:04:48] got
[2:04:49] cold gradually just crept in through the
[2:04:52] night. colder and colder it got. And you
[2:04:56] know, before you know it, it happens in
[2:04:58] the church. And the sanctuary turns to a
[2:05:02] spiritual morg.
[2:05:05] Everybody dressed up and sitting in rows
[2:05:07] and no life.
[2:05:11] You know what I'd had to do to my house?
[2:05:13] Turn a fire on.
[2:05:17] Amen. You know what we need in the
[2:05:18] church this morning? Turn the fire on.
[2:05:22] Hallelujah. Turn this thing from a morg
[2:05:25] to a living house of God, a house of
[2:05:28] praise, a house of glory where the
[2:05:31] spirit of God comes
[2:05:33] down. That's what we need. Turn the fire
[2:05:37] on. Turn it
[2:05:40] up. You got plenty of the word of good
[2:05:43] of the word of God, but it ain't no good
[2:05:45] unless you put a fire to it.
[2:05:49] They pumped the Holy Ghost out and
[2:05:50] pumped in formality and and dead and
[2:05:53] stiff and cold dry cold creeds,
[2:05:56] replacing the Holy Ghost with structure,
[2:05:59] replacing the fire with form. Now they
[2:06:02] got a spiritual and bombing fluid that's
[2:06:04] flowing through their veins instead of
[2:06:06] the living burning power of the Holy
[2:06:08] Ghost.
[2:06:09] It's no wonder they said, you know, no
[2:06:11] wonder they're sitting there frozen and
[2:06:14] dryeyed, handsfolded and hearts closed.
[2:06:23] Somebody dares to say, "Amen." The whole
[2:06:26] church turns like geese in the field.
[2:06:28] Who said that?
[2:06:31] Instead of joining in the praise.
[2:06:35] Come on. Don't be a gawker in this
[2:06:37] church. Who said that? Who shout? Now,
[2:06:40] who is that same one? Get up yourself
[2:06:43] and go to praising God. If he's your
[2:06:45] God, he deserves your
[2:06:49] praise. Hallelujah. Join in. Join in the
[2:06:54] praise. Don't put a damper on it. Don't
[2:06:57] throw a wet blanket on it. Don't put the
[2:06:59] fire out. Dear God, we need the fire.
[2:07:07] It's a shame. It's a tragedy because
[2:07:09] where the spirit of the Lord is, there
[2:07:11] is liberty. And where there's liberty,
[2:07:12] there is joy, there is love, there is
[2:07:14] life.
[2:07:16] But that old devilish bug has long
[2:07:19] chewed away the joy away. And what are
[2:07:21] we left with? Listen to me carefully. A
[2:07:24] husk of a church.
[2:07:27] And unless we let God restore what the
[2:07:29] palmer word has stolen, that's all we'll
[2:07:32] be is husk.
[2:07:34] Dead dried
[2:07:38] husk.
[2:07:39] Husk. Husk of a church. Yep. You can
[2:07:44] tell they're just shuck because if the
[2:07:48] original wheat
[2:07:49] grain, if that's what they were, it
[2:07:52] would have the life and the joy in the
[2:07:54] power of Pentecost.
[2:07:58] Amen.
[2:08:00] Now Jesus dug a well all the way to the
[2:08:04] rock. He cleaned it out at Calvary. So
[2:08:07] out of him could flow lifegiving waters
[2:08:10] of salvation and healing. But men with
[2:08:13] their creeds came right back around and
[2:08:15] threw logs in it again and blocked off
[2:08:17] the flow of the spirit.
[2:08:19] You see logs get in the channel. The
[2:08:23] dirt of men's tradition, the sin of
[2:08:25] doubt, it'll build up against it. And
[2:08:29] the first thing you know, the wells of
[2:08:31] God's blessings cannot
[2:08:33] flow. You know, I think of some of
[2:08:36] these, and there's a lot of them I could
[2:08:38] dwell on, but some some years back, some
[2:08:41] put a log in the flow of the spirit
[2:08:42] saying, "No one could be saved after
[2:08:45] 1963." Some of you remember that. I was
[2:08:48] a log. Another one come along and say,
[2:08:50] "Oh, no. I'm I'm I I got a greater
[2:08:53] revelation that you know, God, the order
[2:08:55] of mercy closed in 2000.
[2:08:58] Oh my goodness. Well, what does that do?
[2:09:02] It dams up the flow of the spirit even
[2:09:04] to their children. It blocks off the
[2:09:07] Holy Spirit and it makes the church a
[2:09:10] filthy stagnated pool.
[2:09:16] Amen. I I had a conversation with a man
[2:09:19] one day, you know, told me, you know, I
[2:09:21] went and preached for him
[2:09:24] and he invited me to come. And so I
[2:09:28] didn't really know him. So I I I
[2:09:30] thought, you know, I knew what move he
[2:09:32] was in. I thought, well, maybe it's
[2:09:34] opening up a little bit. He's inviting
[2:09:37] me, an outsider, to come in his church
[2:09:40] and
[2:09:41] preach. And now, you know, I preached
[2:09:44] first service, his whole church was at
[2:09:46] the altar.
[2:09:50] Then afterwards he comes along and he
[2:09:52] said, "Well, you know, God told me that,
[2:09:55] you know, some had said in ' 63 mercy
[2:09:58] was over." Well, you know what? God
[2:10:01] closed to me that the year of mercy was
[2:10:06] closed back in over in the year
[2:10:09] 2000 when the when the when it turned
[2:10:12] the year
[2:10:13] 2000. And I thought it's strange that
[2:10:15] elders would come to me in
[2:10:19] church, preacher, walk over to me and
[2:10:22] said, "When's the last time you seen a
[2:10:24] soul
[2:10:27] saved?" And I said, you know, like that
[2:10:31] was an an unheard of thing anymore.
[2:10:35] It didn't happen no more. And I I was
[2:10:38] puzzled by it. And I said,
[2:10:40] "Well, he I'm not talking about somebody
[2:10:42] can, you know, in in the church like
[2:10:44] that, somebody like I said, "Well, let
[2:10:46] me tell you, let me tell you, we just
[2:10:49] had a boy that was a bartender in a
[2:10:53] bar come to the Lord, come to the
[2:10:56] church, and God gloriously saved him,
[2:10:58] changed his life, set him free."
[2:11:03] I said, "We've we've had a lot more
[2:11:05] since then." I said, "Ning all the time.
[2:11:08] That's what's supposed to happen in a
[2:11:10] church."
[2:11:12] He shrugged and said, "Huh?" Well, then
[2:11:14] the pastor tells me that he he closed
[2:11:16] the door. He had to do it cuz God
[2:11:17] didn't. He closed the door. Mercy in
[2:11:20] 2000. And I said, so I I looked at him.
[2:11:23] I said, "Why in the world do you want to
[2:11:26] believe that?"
[2:11:29] I said, "Why? Why do you want to believe
[2:11:31] that? Why do you want to believe that
[2:11:34] God closed the door of mercy?" And here
[2:11:37] last 2005 2010 somewhere like that and
[2:11:41] and and and the door of mercy would got
[2:11:43] closed then. I said why do you want to
[2:11:44] believe that? Don't you know that I damn
[2:11:47] your children your grandchildren?
[2:11:51] And he looked over me. Oh no no no no.
[2:11:54] Everybody I love and everybody loves me
[2:11:57] is going to be there.
[2:12:00] And I just rolled my eyes and I thought
[2:12:02] God have mercy. If that's the way it is,
[2:12:06] I'm gonna start loving everybody.
[2:12:10] I'm gonna love the sinner and I'm going
[2:12:13] to preach to him a gospel of peace. I'm
[2:12:16] going to love the unbeliever, the
[2:12:18] backslider, the lost. I'm going to love
[2:12:21] them all. I'm going to love those that
[2:12:23] are prostitutes and the drunkers and
[2:12:25] alcoholics. I don't care what they are.
[2:12:28] I'm going to love them. I'm going to
[2:12:29] love them enough to tell them Jesus fell
[2:12:33] save. He's an intercessor for
[2:12:38] sin. Hallelujah. And I declare right
[2:12:41] here in
[2:12:42] 2025, he's the same yesterday, today,
[2:12:46] and forever. Healer, deliver, savior,
[2:12:49] soul
[2:12:52] satisfier.
[2:12:56] Hallelujah. He hasn't changed. Men have
[2:12:59] changed. Their attitude has changed. But
[2:13:02] his attitude hasn't changed. He's still
[2:13:06] saved. He's still healed. He still
[2:13:08] delivers.
[2:13:13] Hallelujah. Why don't you just praise
[2:13:14] the Lord a moment?
[2:13:27] Glory. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:13:35] I'm trying to could, you know, not
[2:13:37] preach quite as long, but sit down a
[2:13:38] minute.
[2:13:40] Oh, hallelujah. Don't tell me
[2:13:43] that. You know, somebody jerked their
[2:13:45] neck around said, "Who said that?" Oh,
[2:13:47] Jonathan said
[2:13:49] it. God bless you, brother Jonathan.
[2:13:52] We're going to preach a little more.
[2:13:55] I've been doing my best to cut these
[2:13:56] sermons down
[2:14:00] and it ain't worked yet.
[2:14:02] So, don't get
[2:14:05] excited. But you know what it does when
[2:14:08] you chose to throw a log in a
[2:14:11] channel? You know, all kinds of dirt
[2:14:14] gets hit up against this log and washes
[2:14:17] up against and the water backs
[2:14:19] up just like beavers do. Now, brother
[2:14:22] Brandham used this illustration in
[2:14:24] getting in the
[2:14:26] spirit and he said we he said he said
[2:14:30] you get all the water backed up like
[2:14:33] beavers do and make a dam and you got no
[2:14:38] water that'll go through it. And he said
[2:14:40] we got too many beaver preachers
[2:14:44] today trying to dam all the water up and
[2:14:48] say this is ours. This is just for us
[2:14:52] here. This belongs to us. And what
[2:14:54] happens? It becomes stagnated.
[2:14:57] And that's what's the matter with a lot
[2:14:58] of our organizations trying to back up
[2:15:00] the water of your organization only. And
[2:15:03] let me tell you, they did this with
[2:15:04] return ministry. They did this with the
[2:15:06] thunder doctrine. They did this with
[2:15:07] Prouia. They did this saying there's no
[2:15:09] mercy. It all just got stagnated.
[2:15:14] Mhm. You see, you know, stagnated water
[2:15:18] then gets what they call little wiggle
[2:15:20] tails in it.
[2:15:24] And that's what's the matter with the
[2:15:25] church. Little wiggle in here and a
[2:15:27] little wiggle out there. And you tell
[2:15:30] them, you tell them what the Bible said
[2:15:31] and they wiggle out of that.
[2:15:34] And you show them another quote and they
[2:15:35] wiggle out of that and try to show you
[2:15:37] another quote. Well, the well will
[2:15:39] cancel out that
[2:15:40] quote. You know, days of miracles have
[2:15:43] passed. No such thing as divine healing.
[2:15:45] Oh, you're just trying to be brother
[2:15:46] Brandham. No, we're
[2:15:48] not. We're trying. We're trying to be
[2:15:50] Jesus Christ.
[2:15:54] Woohoo.
[2:15:57] Amen. You got to You just kind of hit a
[2:15:59] little low on my aspiration. This bride
[2:16:02] will be Jesus Christ in action on the
[2:16:05] earth. Amen. Oh, you know, oh, you know,
[2:16:08] you know, stagnated water, beaver dam.
[2:16:12] He says, blow it out. There is a
[2:16:15] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[2:16:17] Emanuel's vein where sinners plunge
[2:16:19] beneath the blood. Lose all their guilty
[2:16:22] stains.
[2:16:24] What do we do with these dams that these
[2:16:27] beaver preachers have built to stop the
[2:16:30] flow of God's blessings that leaves
[2:16:33] behind nothing but stagnated water for
[2:16:36] people to
[2:16:37] drink around here? I tell you what they
[2:16:40] do around here. Brother Jimbo knows he's
[2:16:42] a been on the cruise and and and the
[2:16:46] highway department, but we have them
[2:16:48] sometimes. We got beavers in this
[2:16:50] country and yeah, they'll get down.
[2:16:52] They'll dam up a little stream of
[2:16:54] water. First thing you know, it's
[2:16:57] flooding the
[2:16:58] highway. You see, it's blocking the
[2:17:01] channel.
[2:17:03] It's not only blocking the flow of the
[2:17:05] water out of the stream, but it begins
[2:17:08] to block the the the roads, the highways
[2:17:12] itself. And they'll build their dam,
[2:17:15] flood them roads, making them
[2:17:16] impossible. And but you know what?
[2:17:18] They'll use dynamite.
[2:17:22] They got some specialists out there that
[2:17:24] are some beaver damn busters.
[2:17:27] Amen. And you know, and I tell you,
[2:17:29] that's what we need this morning. Is the
[2:17:32] specialist of the Holy Ghost to set the
[2:17:35] dynamics of the Holy Ghost into the
[2:17:37] beaver dams that people have built up
[2:17:40] and blow them sky high and let the water
[2:17:43] flow. Let the Holy Ghost move. Let the
[2:17:46] power of God sweep across the bride of
[2:17:48] Christ.
[2:17:50] Hallelujah. Get some damn
[2:17:53] busters. Some dynamite. A little bit of
[2:17:56] Acts 2 and 4. A little bit of that Holy
[2:17:59] Ghost. A little bit of speaking in
[2:18:01] tongues. A little bit of the shout of
[2:18:03] the king. A little bit of the dancing in
[2:18:05] the spirit. A little bit of the moving
[2:18:07] of the Holy
[2:18:09] Ghost. Hallelujah. Mix it all up in that
[2:18:12] TNT. In that dynamite power blow that
[2:18:16] beaver dam.
[2:18:25] Prophet said, "Get down there and dig
[2:18:26] all them logs
[2:18:28] out."
[2:18:30] Well, I tell you,
[2:18:32] prophet, should we just go back and
[2:18:35] let's just try to reinvent that mighty
[2:18:37] Russian wind?
[2:18:39] Nope. Should we have an eighth
[2:18:41] messenger? Nope.
[2:18:44] That would just be another beaver
[2:18:47] building another
[2:18:48] dam, a kingdom for himself and hoarding
[2:18:51] up all the waters.
[2:18:53] We ain't looking for another messenger,
[2:18:55] another gift, another sign like that.
[2:18:59] No. Shall we start a another latter
[2:19:02] rain? No. We don't need a new
[2:19:06] doctrine. That would be just another big
[2:19:08] log to stop the flow and hinder the
[2:19:10] spirit. Nope. Nope. Just clean out the
[2:19:13] channel. That's what we need. That's all
[2:19:15] you got to do. We got We got people. We
[2:19:17] got the people. God's called the bride.
[2:19:21] We got the people. Just clean the
[2:19:24] channel out. Amen. The the the bride's
[2:19:26] okay. She's all right. She's called.
[2:19:29] Amen. But she needs her channels cleared
[2:19:31] out. Amen. Get cleaned out where the
[2:19:34] Holy Spirit can come in and get rid of
[2:19:36] fanaticism, isms of man, the ideas of
[2:19:40] man. Clean it all out.
[2:19:44] And don't go and try to smite the rock
[2:19:46] again and bring forth something new out
[2:19:49] of the rock. Just speak to the rock.
[2:19:53] Amen. The waters are fresh. But you see
[2:19:56] what happened? Our ecclesiastical
[2:19:59] systems have damned up the
[2:20:01] stream. So you clean them all
[2:20:04] out. And he says, "Now listen, you're
[2:20:07] not going to have another rushing wind.
[2:20:10] You'll see neither will hear neither
[2:20:12] when neither will you see any rain but
[2:20:15] there's going to be rain. So we're not
[2:20:17] going to get a new system. Not going to
[2:20:19] get a new prophet. We're not going to
[2:20:21] get as in somebody else and that can do
[2:20:24] what brother Brandham did. Amen. We you
[2:20:27] know it's not going to make another
[2:20:28] oneness or assembly or or Presbyterian
[2:20:31] or or whatever else. Not another deity
[2:20:33] movement or not another prophet. Not
[2:20:35] another pro movement. Not another
[2:20:37] thunder. Get all the louds out.
[2:20:40] Amen. All the differences. Quit the
[2:20:42] fussing.
[2:20:44] Quit taking snippets of preachers and
[2:20:47] snipping them out. And you say he say he
[2:20:49] said this here and he said this there
[2:20:51] and you see what he's saying there. And
[2:20:53] all of your slander
[2:20:55] that's going around among preachers in
[2:20:57] the message with gossip against the
[2:21:00] moving of the Holy Ghost. Quit it all.
[2:21:03] Get back to the rock.
[2:21:06] Amen. Dig out the stream.
[2:21:09] Make a child. Get ready cuz it's going
[2:21:12] to move whether you are ready or not.
[2:21:15] Amen. There will come a sound from
[2:21:17] heaven. Hallelujah. Of the bride groom
[2:21:21] coming from from the sky. A trumpet will
[2:21:23] sound and the dead in Christ shall rise.
[2:21:27] There'll be a crescendo.
[2:21:29] We need a
[2:21:31] revival. What we need is a digging time.
[2:21:34] You dig. And the deeper you dig, the
[2:21:36] more water you get. Get all this stuff
[2:21:39] out of your life.
[2:21:41] If you ain't paying your debts, go pay
[2:21:43] them. Got lingering bills? Get it off of
[2:21:46] your mind, out of your heart.
[2:21:49] Get delivered from the thing, get ready
[2:21:51] to leave. We're leaving.
[2:21:53] Amen. We don't want nothing that has a
[2:21:55] claim on you to make you stay behind.
[2:21:59] Amen. Get rid of your malice. Get your
[2:22:02] stripe out. Clean out the ditches until
[2:22:05] you get down to the solid rock. Amen.
[2:22:08] Get down to water is pouring out of
[2:22:11] Emanuel's veins. Wait until you get down
[2:22:14] to a place where water's flowing out
[2:22:16] like a
[2:22:17] fountain. Start your meetings a new. I'm
[2:22:20] quoting the prophet with a new church
[2:22:22] order of letting God come in.
[2:22:26] Woo. That's what we need around the
[2:22:29] message. a new church order of letting
[2:22:32] God come in.
[2:22:34] Mhm.
[2:22:36] Take out your old fault finding, your
[2:22:38] backbiting, your stiff neck, and these
[2:22:41] superstitions and unbelief. Throw the
[2:22:43] thing
[2:22:45] out. You know what brother Brandham told
[2:22:47] the churches when he was here? He said,
[2:22:49] "You either get to digging or perish.
[2:22:52] You dig out the things, you throw it He
[2:22:53] said, "I'll tell you thus sayaeth the
[2:22:55] Lord, unless you dig out this corruption
[2:22:58] that's in there, you'll perish and your
[2:23:00] fruit and the church will dry up and
[2:23:03] die. Dig it out. You won't hear another
[2:23:06] latter rain or another former rain or
[2:23:09] whatever. But there'll be water and
[2:23:10] peace like a river flowing through every
[2:23:13] heart." Yes, sir. You'll see signs and
[2:23:15] wonders and miracles and powers of God
[2:23:18] returning back into the church and a
[2:23:20] real flowing Pentecost just coming down.
[2:23:22] That's the spirit's message. We start
[2:23:25] digging our parish.
[2:23:31] So, well, we don't need divine healing.
[2:23:33] I don't know who we is,
[2:23:35] but I do.
[2:23:37] And we ain't I ain't in your we. So,
[2:23:40] don't say we cuz I ain't the
[2:23:43] Amen. We need it more than ever. Amen.
[2:23:47] We Well, we got the best doctors, best
[2:23:49] medicine. Listen, Ron Spencer had the
[2:23:51] best doctors, best medicines that the
[2:23:53] money could buy that I mean that was way
[2:23:55] up in the millions of dollars that have
[2:23:57] been spent on the man. But they can't
[2:23:59] cure him. You know it's going to take to
[2:24:01] cure him? The power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:24:04] That's the only thing that can do it.
[2:24:06] Even they say, "Son, it's been your
[2:24:09] God."
[2:24:11] Amen. We got the best hospitals. Yeah.
[2:24:13] We got more
[2:24:14] sickness. Got more unbelief. That's why.
[2:24:18] Amen. So get rid of whatever is clogging
[2:24:20] the
[2:24:21] channel. And I'm going to say to you
[2:24:23] young people, if it's gaming, get rid of
[2:24:25] it. If it's porn, leave it behind. Amen.
[2:24:30] If it's vaping, stop it. If it's drugs,
[2:24:34] flee from it. Amen. If it's a
[2:24:37] fornication, run.
[2:24:40] Amen. Clean out the channel. It doesn't
[2:24:42] matter what it is or who it is this
[2:24:45] morning. Look at your own life. If it's
[2:24:48] your phone,
[2:24:50] I got some advice for you. Get a life.
[2:24:54] Amen. If it's looking to the news too
[2:24:56] open and getting burdened with things
[2:24:58] that you have no control over, dig it
[2:25:01] out.
[2:25:03] Get back into the good news. I got good
[2:25:06] news. He's coming.
[2:25:09] Not only he's coming, but he's here. And
[2:25:11] he's here in bride form about to take a
[2:25:14] people over. Amen. Get back until
[2:25:17] there's a spirit of worship in the
[2:25:19] church, till the spirit gets back in the
[2:25:22] songs. Throw that log of criticism
[2:25:24] aside. Get to where you can shout the
[2:25:27] praises of God and become a part of the
[2:25:32] minstrel. You know, I hear a lot of
[2:25:35] times logs
[2:25:38] stroed logs. Preachers, beaver dam
[2:25:42] preachers throwing logs.
[2:25:46] Well, I saw people he shout all over the
[2:25:49] building and go live a backsliding life.
[2:25:52] Well, look at both sides of it. I've
[2:25:55] seen people claim the Holy Ghost without
[2:25:57] emotion just by believing the message
[2:25:59] and never have an experience and then go
[2:26:02] back and live a backsliding life. And
[2:26:04] there's a whole lot more of them
[2:26:07] that gets up and shouts and go back and
[2:26:09] be a bachelor in life than there is
[2:26:11] those that are sitting in message pews
[2:26:14] educated in the gospel.
[2:26:20] And living backsliden lives.
[2:26:24] Throw out the log. Get in the
[2:26:28] channel. Get aware that you're in the
[2:26:31] spirit.
[2:26:33] Get the spirit back in the evening light
[2:26:35] tabernacle.
[2:26:37] Oh, sure. We go through cycles, through
[2:26:39] ups and downs. We'll have deaths in the
[2:26:41] church. We'll have situation
[2:26:45] comes. I tried to show you. I went
[2:26:48] through the loss of my own wife and I
[2:26:51] tried to show you how to conduct myself,
[2:26:53] how to conduct yourself before the
[2:26:56] children of God.
[2:26:57] I never let it dictate my sermons bring
[2:27:02] me down.
[2:27:06] You say, "Brother Tim, you never had
[2:27:07] tears. Not that you saw."
[2:27:11] Amen. You never had that days of
[2:27:13] depression. Not that I let you see.
[2:27:16] Amen. Those are times I settle it out on
[2:27:18] my knees. But when I come to the church,
[2:27:21] I didn't bring my depression with me.
[2:27:24] And I didn't preach my depression.
[2:27:27] And I tell you, don't you worship your
[2:27:29] depression. Let the thing go. Amen.
[2:27:33] Don't bring it. Amen. If you're bringing
[2:27:34] the house of God, throw it
[2:27:36] out. Amen. Rise up above it. You're a
[2:27:39] son or daughter of God.
[2:27:45] People can still go to a ball game and
[2:27:47] shout and scream and whatever else and
[2:27:49] then call you a holy roller. Well, I'll
[2:27:51] tell you, brother Bradam had a name for
[2:27:53] you. He said, "If you can do that, go to
[2:27:56] the ball game and scream and holler and
[2:27:57] shout and then then look down on the
[2:28:00] church for doing the same." He said, "If
[2:28:02] we are holy rollers, you are unholy
[2:28:04] rollers."
[2:28:08] But if you get in the spirit one time,
[2:28:11] you see the water came. They didn't even
[2:28:14] see a wind. They didn't see a rain. But
[2:28:18] they hit the rock.
[2:28:20] And that same rock that provided water
[2:28:22] in the wilderness back in the days of
[2:28:25] Moses came again and watered them all.
[2:28:30] And not only did it water, but you see,
[2:28:33] when the enemy looked and they saw that
[2:28:37] water, to them it looked red.
[2:28:42] Amen. It is red. It's bloody red with
[2:28:45] the blood of Jesus Christ. And they
[2:28:48] looked at it and said, "Hey, they killed
[2:28:50] everybody." And here they ran in there
[2:28:53] and, you know, ran in there to them and
[2:28:55] and Israel fell upon them and killed
[2:28:57] them all. Why was it? Because they
[2:29:00] cleaned out the channels.
[2:29:03] Are you ready to clear your channels
[2:29:05] this morning? Are you ready for the Holy
[2:29:07] Ghost to move? Are you ready for the
[2:29:09] dynamic power of God? Are you ready for
[2:29:12] the Holy Ghost? If you're not, make
[2:29:14] yourself ready. Get it out. Whatever's
[2:29:16] in your life, whatever is hindered,
[2:29:18] whatever is holding you back from that
[2:29:20] closer walk, get it out of your life.
[2:29:23] Make a surrender to God. God promised
[2:29:26] it.
[2:29:28] As I close this morning, musicians, come
[2:29:31] now. We believe in
[2:29:34] restoration. But do we believe in
[2:29:37] revival? Revival and restorations are
[2:29:40] the same. They're the same thing. If God
[2:29:44] says, "I will restore it." He is saying,
[2:29:45] "I will revive."
[2:29:48] It is his will that we have revival.
[2:29:50] It's his will that the shadow of the
[2:29:52] king be in our midst. It's his will that
[2:29:55] we are on fire and not lukewarm. It's
[2:29:58] his will that healing takes place. It is
[2:30:00] the children's bread. It is that the
[2:30:04] will that devils are cast out and souls
[2:30:07] are saved. Once again, healing is
[2:30:11] restoration. Healing is revival. And the
[2:30:15] whole purpose of this message was to
[2:30:17] bring healing,
[2:30:19] restoration, revival.
[2:30:22] Is it reviving you this morning? Are you
[2:30:25] letting logs lay on your victory and
[2:30:29] killing your
[2:30:32] faith? We're coming down to the
[2:30:34] communion table.
[2:30:37] If the power lines are clogged this
[2:30:43] morning, get it opened
[2:30:46] up. You
[2:30:49] see, faith was the original
[2:30:54] design for he said, "If you abide in me,
[2:30:58] my words abide in you. You will ask what
[2:31:00] you will and it shall be given to
[2:31:05] you. We were created to walk in
[2:31:08] dominion, to rule, to operate in divine
[2:31:13] authority. But through the fall, that
[2:31:15] connection was
[2:31:17] severed. Yet through redemption, we have
[2:31:20] been
[2:31:22] restored. So what's stopping us?
[2:31:26] Why don't we see the full power and the
[2:31:29] full manifestation of his
[2:31:32] power? You see, those divine power lines
[2:31:35] meant to operate to us have become
[2:31:39] blocked. The supernatural flow of God
[2:31:43] has been
[2:31:44] hindered. Not because God wield that.
[2:31:47] That was never his will.
[2:31:50] You hear brother Brandham say, "The
[2:31:52] church now ought to be raising the dead,
[2:31:54] casting out devils, the miracles of God
[2:31:57] among
[2:31:58] it." But that supernatural flow of God
[2:32:02] has been
[2:32:03] hindered by man's
[2:32:05] unbelief, religious
[2:32:08] traditions, man's
[2:32:11] theology. Make the word of God of none
[2:32:17] effect. For too long, the enemy has used
[2:32:20] false
[2:32:21] doctrines, doubt, human reasoning to
[2:32:25] block God's move of his spirit. It's
[2:32:29] time to clean out the
[2:32:32] debris. I want to say, throw out that
[2:32:35] log of
[2:32:36] unbelief that says miracles are not for
[2:32:39] today.
[2:32:41] Tear out that old dead religion that
[2:32:43] says the Holy Spirit isn't needed and
[2:32:47] doesn't come like it did in the book of
[2:32:49] Acts. That log of fear that whispers in
[2:32:53] your ear is the serpent's hiss that says
[2:32:57] and tells you the doctor said I can't be
[2:33:00] healed. No, we can't accept that. God
[2:33:05] has not changed. His word is still alive
[2:33:08] today.
[2:33:10] So tap into
[2:33:12] it. Get
[2:33:15] connected. You
[2:33:17] see the electricity power in these
[2:33:21] lights. They're it's invisible. It's a
[2:33:24] power yet it's
[2:33:26] invisible. Yet when it's harnessed,
[2:33:29] it'll light
[2:33:31] cities. It will power machines. It will
[2:33:34] connect the
[2:33:35] world. Remember Benjamin Franklin? He
[2:33:38] discovered it. He shouted, "I got it."
[2:33:42] But he had no idea how far it would
[2:33:45] go. Here come Edison alone. Put it to
[2:33:48] work. Now we got wireless
[2:33:51] technology. Signals travel through space
[2:33:53] at speeds way too fast for you and
[2:33:58] I. But it's
[2:34:00] real. It's powerful. It's been
[2:34:03] lifechanging.
[2:34:06] Now, what I'm saying to you, if the
[2:34:07] natural laws can do this, what about the
[2:34:10] supernatural laws of the
[2:34:13] spirit? What happens when the spirit of
[2:34:15] God is unhindered and flowing through a
[2:34:18] yielded
[2:34:19] vessel? What happens when faith connects
[2:34:22] to the divine current coming from
[2:34:26] heaven? I'll tell you what happens.
[2:34:29] Miracles happen. The sick are healed.
[2:34:33] The dead are
[2:34:34] raised. The lost are saved. Chains
[2:34:38] break. Revival will
[2:34:41] ignite. This is what the church was
[2:34:43] designed
[2:34:45] for. Are you blocking the flow? Are you
[2:34:48] holding it
[2:34:50] back? I'll tell you some people, they're
[2:34:53] more wired for the enemy's power than
[2:34:55] for God's
[2:34:56] power. They believe in sickness more
[2:34:59] than healing, in fear more than faith,
[2:35:02] in doubt more than God's promise.
[2:35:05] And because of that, the enemy has free
[2:35:08] reign to bring disaster and depression,
[2:35:11] destruction. But I'm telling you this
[2:35:13] morning, we were not made for defeat.
[2:35:18] I upon this rock will build my church,
[2:35:22] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[2:35:24] against it.
[2:35:27] It's Satan's kingdom that operates
[2:35:28] through fear and unbelief and
[2:35:31] deception. And it produces exactly what
[2:35:33] it was designed to produce. Sickness,
[2:35:38] bondage,
[2:35:39] hopelessness, and
[2:35:42] death. What about God's kingdom? Is it
[2:35:47] powerless? The devil's kingdom
[2:35:49] has great power in it. But what about
[2:35:53] the kingdom of God? Should not the body
[2:35:56] of Christ, who is the very extension of
[2:35:59] Jesus on earth, shouldn't we operate in
[2:36:02] victory and healing and power and
[2:36:04] miracles and dominion? Shouldn't we? Why
[2:36:07] did he redeem us? How come he purchases
[2:36:11] us with his own blood? Why did he wipe
[2:36:14] it clear where you could boldly approach
[2:36:17] the throne of grace? Why did he send the
[2:36:20] Holy Spirit? Did he do it just to
[2:36:22] forgive us and leave us powerless?
[2:36:25] He say you're saved and you have no
[2:36:27] authority, no healing, no victory in
[2:36:29] life. No, that's not why he did it. He
[2:36:34] did it so you could walk in power.
[2:36:37] He did it so you could tread on serpents
[2:36:41] and scorpions and nothing by any means
[2:36:44] would hurt you. That these signs would
[2:36:47] follow them that believe in my name.
[2:36:49] They would cast out devils. They would
[2:36:51] speak with new tongues. They will lay
[2:36:54] hands on the sick and they shall
[2:36:56] recover.
[2:36:59] The body of Christ is to be a mighty
[2:37:02] force, but it's got to be properly
[2:37:05] wired.
[2:37:07] Got to have the channels cleaned
[2:37:09] out. It's got to have dedicated channels
[2:37:13] where the Holy Spirit can flow.
[2:37:17] When the
[2:37:18] building is wired
[2:37:20] right, all it takes is a flip of the
[2:37:24] switch and the power
[2:37:27] flows. And if the church is wired to
[2:37:30] Jesus
[2:37:31] Christ, wired to the
[2:37:33] word, when that master electrician flips
[2:37:37] the
[2:37:38] switch, revival will explode because
[2:37:41] it's restoration.
[2:37:43] Are you ready? Yes. Are you ready?
[2:37:47] Is something grounded in your life? Is
[2:37:50] something holding it back? Is something
[2:37:53] keeping it? Is your faith wired to
[2:37:56] theology instead of
[2:37:58] revelation? If you're plugged into
[2:38:00] doctrine instead of the spirit? If
[2:38:01] you're filled with doubt instead of
[2:38:03] faith, the power will never
[2:38:06] flow. I want to tell you this morning,
[2:38:09] strip out the unbelief.
[2:38:13] Tear down the mental
[2:38:14] barriers. Dig down deep. Clear the
[2:38:18] channels so the Holy Spirit can flood
[2:38:21] in. Be filled with the
[2:38:23] spirit. It's not enough to have the
[2:38:26] vine. We must be the branches.
[2:38:30] We must be willing to bear the
[2:38:32] fruit. The vine carries the life, but
[2:38:36] the branch bears the fruit.
[2:38:39] God's depending on you this morning to
[2:38:42] bear the fruit. Have you been thirsty in
[2:38:45] your life? Do you thirst for a closer
[2:38:48] walk? Do you long for more of
[2:38:51] Jesus? Do you realize you're thirsty
[2:38:54] this morning and you're in a dry and
[2:38:58] thirsty
[2:39:00] place? What's the word from the
[2:39:03] prophet? Take the shovel and dig
[2:39:06] ditches.
[2:39:08] Dig out the
[2:39:09] logs. Move the
[2:39:12] unbelief. Hit the rock till the spirit
[2:39:16] flows. I want you to bow your heads for
[2:39:18] a
[2:39:19] moment before we have this communion
[2:39:22] service. Maybe you'd like to take this
[2:39:24] communion
[2:39:25] unhindered. As a newborn babe in
[2:39:28] Christ, you'd really like to right now
[2:39:31] surrender your heart to the Lord. You've
[2:39:34] never really done it. Never really
[2:39:35] cleaned out those channels. you to let
[2:39:37] something hinder you, hold you
[2:39:38] back. But you heard this morning that
[2:39:42] that desire in your heart is a real
[2:39:43] desire. God put it in you. It's a
[2:39:46] channel. That desire is a channel for
[2:39:48] his Holy Spirit to flow through down to
[2:39:50] the soul to change you in his presence.
[2:39:54] Would you like to be changed? Would you
[2:39:57] like the lifegiving power to be in your
[2:40:00] life? Would you like the whatever's been
[2:40:03] hindering you, holding you back? I don't
[2:40:06] care what it's been. Maybe drugs,
[2:40:08] alcohol, maybe sin. Maybe you stopped
[2:40:10] all of that and you've had a sanctified
[2:40:12] life and you kind of cleaned up a little
[2:40:14] bit. But you know what? Why don't you
[2:40:17] let him really clean you up? Why don't
[2:40:20] you do it by letting the flow of the
[2:40:21] Holy Spirit move through you until it
[2:40:23] boils all the trash out? Until it that
[2:40:26] flows like a river in your life.
[2:40:29] Maybe I could just get you to do that
[2:40:32] first step of faith this morning and
[2:40:34] just raise a hand to God and say,
[2:40:36] "That's me, Brother Tim. I really want
[2:40:38] that in my life." Would you raise your
[2:40:41] hand to God? God sees you. God sees you.
[2:40:44] God sees you. God sees you. God sees
[2:40:46] you. Amen. There's even saints of God
[2:40:49] raising their hands right now in this
[2:40:51] building. Amen. That are saying, "I want
[2:40:53] it flowing, unhindered. I want it to be
[2:40:55] completely I want to get into the spirit
[2:40:58] where the spirit of God can really move
[2:40:59] in my life. Amen. Where I can really
[2:41:02] have communion with him where this
[2:41:04] communion will not just be bread and
[2:41:06] wine that I take in symbols but I really
[2:41:08] have communion with the father where the
[2:41:11] flow of the Holy Spirit really moves in
[2:41:13] my life. Will you surrender to him? Will
[2:41:16] you surrender right now? One more hand.
[2:41:18] One more hand. I'm just asking you just
[2:41:21] to surrender right now. I'll say here I
[2:41:23] raise my hand surrender. God bless you.
[2:41:26] Father, in the name of
[2:41:28] Jesus, you said, "He that comes to me, I
[2:41:31] will in no wise cast out." I pray in the
[2:41:34] name of Jesus, do the work that only you
[2:41:37] can touch the lives and the hearts of
[2:41:39] your children this morning. Father, as
[2:41:42] you've moved on their lives, as you
[2:41:43] moved on their hearts, hands lifted to
[2:41:46] you. I pray Lord that there'll be a
[2:41:48] channel the Holy Spirit can flow through
[2:41:51] now. Every bit of trash, every login,
[2:41:54] every hindrance moved out, the Holy
[2:41:56] Spirit moving supreme in Jesus
[2:42:00] name. Amen.
[2:42:05] Amen. So I throw up my hands, praise you
[2:42:10] again and
[2:42:11] [Music]
[2:42:13] again. All that I have is a hallelujah.
[2:42:18] [Music]
[2:42:26] Hallelu. I know it's not much, nothing
[2:42:31] else fit for a king
[2:42:35] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[2:42:41] [Music]
[2:42:50] All my words fall short.
[2:42:54] All my words fall
[2:42:57] [Music]
[2:42:59] short. I've got nothing
[2:43:04] new. How could I
[2:43:09] express all my gratitude?
[2:43:13] [Music]
[2:43:15] I could sing these
[2:43:20] songs as I often
[2:43:25] do. Every song must
[2:43:30] sing, but you
[2:43:33] never
[2:43:35] do. So I throw up my hands and praise
[2:43:40] you again and again.
[2:43:45] All that I have is a
[2:43:49] [Music]
[2:43:52] hallelujah.
[2:43:55] [Music]
[2:43:56] Hallelujah. I know it's not much.
[2:44:00] Nothing else for a
[2:44:04] king except for a heart singing
[2:44:08] hallelujah.
[2:44:09] [Music]
[2:44:18] I' I've got one response.
[2:44:22] I've got one response. I've got just
[2:44:26] one.
[2:44:28] I've got just one word.
[2:44:32] With my heart, with my arms stretched
[2:44:37] wide, I will
[2:44:40] worship you. No, I throw up my
[2:44:46] hands. Oh, I
[2:44:49] praise your
[2:44:53] name. Hallelujah.
[2:45:00] Hallelujah.
[2:45:01] [Music]
[2:45:04] And I know it's not much. I'm nothing
[2:45:08] else
[2:45:09] before
[2:45:11] king except for a heart singing
[2:45:16] [Music]
