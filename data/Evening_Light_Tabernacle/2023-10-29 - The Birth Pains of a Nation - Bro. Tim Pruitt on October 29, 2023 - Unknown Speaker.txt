have some meetings at 1 of December to go to brother Jason Watkins and Minister there and to to a group of to a ministers meeting as well so you know it's u a a time uh we we just a time today of reflection of thinking of of praying of believing together um as you know I went to um Johnson City Tennessee uh we had our sister Erica Reagan Parker she was 44 years old that passed away brother Donnie's daughter you know we prayed and God has given us the answer and he gave us the answer by rescuing her from the dreaded disease of cancer that ravaged her body and uh we want to thank the Lord for her life and testimony I I went there and I um ministered to the family and to the church and um you know was just a partner with them and uh as you know brother Donnie Reagan and I have been very close bosom friends since 1987 and uh even though I was scheduled to go away to um flight to Switzerland and then on to France for meetings um you know I I just couldn't go with under the circum ances and so I I stayed home and brother Timothy went had tremendous meetings he's finished up in Belgium today and he'll be traveling home uh on Tuesday so keep him in your prayers that the Lord would be with them and he is certainly blessed them in both places there in France with tremendous meetings and an outpouring of the spirit and Revival coming there and and uh so we are thankful to the Lord I also wanted to mention to you as the church that our brother Billy Paul brandham he was 88 years old he passed away on October the 19th with pancreatic cancer and um I I guess they kind of kept that a little bit secret most people didn't know that um he was uh in that condition but brother Billy was a a loving man and so sweet and very kind you just couldn't help but love him and certainly I had a special place in my heart for uh you know many many years ago when my wife was just a young teenager about 13 she had um uh an awful condition that doctors uh had said that she was uh going to uh well they they thought it was menitis they were uncertain what it was but they checked her out of the hospital and um took her to over to col Lake Mississippi where brother Billy Paul brother um some of the other brothers brother Doug McHugh was there and in a prayer line she was healed for the glory of God and lived many years and blessed us as a wife a mother a grandmother a you know a church pastor's wife you know it just um wonderful wonderful things that the Lord did and I know God used brother Billy in many ways as um you know through life's journey and I want to thank the Lord for him and his love for the Lord and his love for the message and his love for the the things of god so let's stand together as we we go to prayer this morning we just remember these families in prayer as they continue to deal with their loss uh pray for the Reagan family and the the brandham family as well and the extended family we just want to ask God's grace now upon them Lord as we just bow before you today we want to thank you for lives that have gone before us lives that has inspired us we think about sister Erica and her life and testimony how that she was one who died in faith believing the promise of God and as I testified of her in the service that she was a woman of faith and we thank you Lord for these these people of Faith like her like brother Billy Paul who has who has tried to stand for you with all that he knew we believe that he was a sincere Christian and we know Lord that he has been gathered with his people on the other side we're asking Lord today for those of us in the journey that you will just encourage encourage our hearts Lord that you will help us to press along life's journey realizing Lord that we're still here to fight the battle and Lord there are those members of the Bride Lord that have been called on to the other side and certainly we can now say there's more over there than there is here as the bride is made up of Seven Ages and here we think of Father here we're the last runners in the race and the responsibility that we have as your children to continue this journey and to fight the good fight of faith and to to finish the work that you started I pray Lord that you'll bless this congregation and this people today is we just kind of draw up the armor and we put it on a little tighter and adjust trust it this morning draw our sword and Advance forward May no one Lord lay down their sword or take off their helmet it's the battle's not over it's time to advance I ask Lord that you'll give us faith and courage and ability as we press along I ask father for comfort for brother Donnie sister Carol the Lance the four girls and all the other extended family Lord I pray that you'll Comfort them as only you can Comfort Lord as they will feel the vacancy and the and the loss and Lord I I pray that you'll help them Father in this and may that they turn to you with all their hearts and be more determined than ever before for the brandom family Lord I pray that you would bless them in a great way pour out your spirit upon them Lord and may they be revived within their hearts and their hearts turned back to the faith of the apostolic Fathers as Elijah promised would happen I ask Lord you'll do a work in the in their lives we don't want to leave one behind so we're asking Lord that you would just be all inclusive today and move on the lives and hearts of men and women everywhere and cause them to come to you with all of their hearts in Jesus name amen amen God bless you let's turn to the Bible let's go to Joshua 111 is a scripture that I ended on the other day and I thought I would I would read from here again this morning I've got uh lots of places to go in in the word of God today so I pray that you'll you'll be patient with me some things I want to speak to you about personally um as far as the times that were're in so I'm going to read from this and from Isaiah 66 also so Joshua 111 pass through the host command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God hath given you to possess it and Isaiah 66 and verse 8 who hath heard such a thing who has seen such things shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as Zion travailed she brought forth her children shall I bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth sayeth the Lord shall I cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith my thy God Rejoice ye with Jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that love her Rejoice for Joy with her all ye that mourn for her may God bless you as you are seated may add His blessings to the word amen may he just today take us over in such a way that we Minister the words of life looking over this congregation today we want to just focus in on some things today as we are living in this time this day and hour I you know am have been a very much of a student of the visions of brother brandom and I've mentioned this to many of you before but I'm just going to go over with you as uh time has passed and we are here now at a very special moment in time I I feel like that we are but um many years ago now in 1937 brother brandham had a a vision that took place shortly after his wife wife hope and his baby daughter Sharon Rose's death and he um he of course was uh in a very despondent condition he had tried on this would now be two occasions on which he would try to take his life because he didn't feel like it was worth living he looked at himself as a failure having disobeyed the Lord and having things that had come upon him as you know he was to uh have went with the Pentecostal people after his experience at Mishawaka and then his his mother-in-law Hop's mother would um just just come out and and uh adamantly refused to let her daughter go out on the field as he would go out to preach to the Pentecostal people and so because he didn't go he would try many times to make up for that in life but in this he was very despondent because he looked at his situation and uh you know as um having lost a wife and a little baby daughter somewhere around 8 months old and and um you know he he tried to take his life by first um taking a hold of the the power lines and and electrocuting himself and found himself at the bottom there just weep and and beside himself at the bottom of the pole and later he would try to take his life a second time with um with with a pistol he was used his service revolver and uh he tried to take his life he got down and prayed and said you know Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done and pulled the hammer back and it wouldn't fire so he threw it across the room and it went off and and uh you know it was God protecting the gift and and so as as you know in this despondent condition he laid across the bed and you know Place some place he said he went to sleep or he must have went to sleep or another it was a trance or he called it a vision but nevertheless he's he thought he was um walking along a path out West and he was dressed in western clothes and as he was out on this Prairie he um happened to look along the path was a wagon an old covered wagon that was there and the wheel was noticeably broken with the axle hanging down and as he approached the scene he was whistling and or perhaps singing a tune to an old country a cowboy ball of the wheel of the wagon is broken this song although it was written I think some uh 10 years before was sang by paty Montana with the Prairie Ramblers in 1936 and was sang on a on the radio on a popular show called Grand old Opry and it was a mournful account of a a bidding farewell to ranch life it was really the sad song of a cowboy and the end of life and this and it goes along like this the wheel of the wagon is broken it ain't going to turn no more my days on the Prairie are over there is weeds around the Old Ranch door there ain't any campfires smoking where we sang when the day was through the wheel of the wagon is broken and gone is the West I knew goodbye Old Faithful there's a sign on the ranch for sale Goodbye Oh faithful looks like the end of the trail and so as he's whistling this song about death then somewhere near the the broken down wagon he sees this beautiful young girl she's about 18 or 20 years of age and and uh I I just want to break here in the story just to remind you as he looked at this um this Prairie Schooner and the Wagon Wheel that was broken he would mention of it you know it represented his broken family but um when he had his Visions to go west and some of you that are here might remember many years ago now in the old church I took a whole series on the Visions to go west as we studied those visions of why God sent brother brandham West and so on like that and this was one of them that he he thought you know that um he in the cuses of time he tells about it he said I I turned around and to my right sitting at the front of the gate was an old Prairie scooner you know what a covered wagon with horses hitched to it and sitting opposite the driver's side was my wife and I looked in the back my children was sitting back in there and I climbed up on the wagon I said honey I've stood all I can stand and I picked up the lines and pulled the lead horse and started heading Westward and the voice spoke to me when this comes to pass then go Westward and then he continues telling and picks it up later in the same sermon is this the sign of the end sir that Vision had my wife and my children and that the very thing was I was in a covered wagon and the minute I walked in there there was I was in my station wagon and that's the way we leave in a couple days not knowing where we're going not knowing what we're going to do when we get there just going so you can you can see the the parallel just past the the modern-day Prairie Schooner his old station wagon just pass the wreckage here he enters into that other dimension so you know you know sometimes Visions are very Timeless in that even though here he is in 1930 um 6 1937 and there you know here he is in that time but actually he's been transported right to the wreckage right past the wreckage of the station wagon somewhere out on the Prairie out west and we know that he died there in amarilla Texas there out in the prairie walking along the roads and he's singing this popular Western ballad the wheels of the wagon is broken and as he passes the covered wagon um or this Prairie Schooner and he he noticed that the the the W wheel is broken and they making the box frame tipped down in one corner until the axle touched the ground and and just past that wreckage here was this pretty young lady that stood watching him and the wind would play in her in her long blonde hair and her her eyes just sparkled blue and in the Sun and as he walked by he just kind of tipped his hat and greeted her cheerfully and said um good morning ma'am she said good morning Daddy well he stopped and he stared at this beautiful young woman and said well miss how can I be your daddy when you're almost as old as I am and her you know she just smiled at him and showing her perfectly formed teeth and said daddy you just don't know where you're at on Earth I was your little Sharon Rose Sharon but but you were a little baby and there aren't any babies here Daddy though she she replied we're all the same age we're Immortal I said honey you're not sharing said yeah said Mother's up there waiting for you where's Billy Paul my brother and he said I he'll be coming soon and Sharon said I'm going to wait here for Billy Paul why don't you go on and see mother she's waiting for you up at your new home and as brother brandham and I'm just repeating some of the things that he said he said honey I I don't understand he said well Daddy you just don't know where you're at so well am I not on the Prairie and he said no you turned your right and looked and he said he looked and he saw saw the most beautiful light that was coming out of the most beautiful place she'd ever seen and said this is heaven Daddy and mother's up there waiting for you and I said home said at at in your home said you mean I got a home honey there was never a Bram ever rich and Never Had A Home of Their Own well at that present time he he rented a place that was a what was called a shotgun house and um called so because it was basically two rooms if you shot a gun it was shot shoot all the way through the house through every room in the house and it had no toilet it had no running water it was uh it was just there the minimum electricity no doubt either coal at all or or um the uh coal itself that would be burned in an old heater and perhaps a wood heater but anyway here he'd never had a home before and she pointed up the road and there at the end of the trail was this beautiful mansion that was perched on the top of a hill and it seemed as though the the sunbeams just was just all around the Mansions roof and shot out in every direction guiding weary Travelers home to rest and so he would walk from there up toward there to uh and he would sing my home sweet home and a long stairwell led up to from the bottom of the hill to the front door and and hope waited there in an Open Door dressed in white with their long black hair unfurled to the breeze and brother brand bounded up the stairway taking probably three step steps at as stride and when he reached the land and he he fell at her or knelt at her feet and holding her hand and she urged him to give up to get up and said he said oh hope honey I can't stand it no longer I'm just about to go wild since you left and she said I've seen all that's went on Bill promise me something I I want to stop there just for a moment I've seen all that's went on a lot of times you know we think of that other dimension being in a far away place but brother Brenham said it was a slanted place he said I went into a slanted place about 12 feet above my head and he said I could look back and I could see my body so of standing there he could see both Realms and and I as I Rejoice today hearing of Joel van BR in there from Switzerland he came to the meetings in Belgium and he's one of brother Joshua and brother Isaiah V bren's brother and he's been away from the Lord but today he came back to the Lord and surrendered his life to Christ there in the meetings this morning and I couldn't help but thinking of the scriptures where he says there is rejoicing in the presence of angels when one sinner repents it didn't say that Angels Rejoice they don't really know what it is to be lost but it said in the presence of angels there is rejoicing the Saints there Rejoice if you would read in the under the fif seal you would see that those Souls of the altar knew even what had happened to them and that they had been martyred they knew also the conditions on the earth and that others were being martyred and and they they conferred their in their prayer to God when they when they asked for how long how long will you will you will this go on and he told them to rest a little while and give them white robes and of course we know those were Jewish believers who who died for the testimony that they held but I want to just get to back to you said I've seen all that's went on Bill and you know and so he said promise me something who she said promise me something what promise me you won't worry no more and he said you know I've seen Sherry honey didn't our girl make a beautiful woman said yes she's waiting for Billy isn't she and said promise me won't you that you won't worry sharing off and I are much better off than you are just promise me you won't worry you've got to stop worrying about me so well I can't help it I've been so lonesome for you both and Billy Paul cries for me for you all the time and I don't know what to do with them well Sharon and our far better off than you are promise me you won't worry about us anymore and Hope put an arm around his shoulder and patted his back as she'd done so often on Earth and and she she said come on in you're tired aren't you said you're so tired you've been praying for the sick and these are brother brandom's words and I hadn't prayed for the sick in them days and that was the reason I know someday I I I pass out here in the Pulpit friends the other night when I was with you here I passed completely out among you I passed out as for as many as 24 hours at a time I no one of these nights I'm going you know he's trying to rationalize all of this you know understand what is happening and he said she said bill you look so tired you're wearing yourself out praying for this sick said I know all about it bill again I want you to get it I know all about it Bill come inside with me and now you can sit down and rest and he walked with her inside the the mansion and sat down on a green Morris chair exactly like the one he'd lost to finance company because he couldn't make the payments and hope said you remember that chair a lump formed in his throat and said yeah how well I remember said well they won't take this one it's paid for I want to stop just for a minute Heaven is a real place there are real people there in real bodies and there are things in heaven that look much like what is here on the Earth there are Fields with great panoramic views there are Hills there are valleys there are mountains there are rivers there are parks with trees I'm giving this to you from the Bible there's all kinds of things that remind us of this world here in this Shadow land and things that we we that Comfort us here like this Morris chair that he talks about they they're there too and he says I'm going home where I got a chair to sit down to rest a little while come over there and I I wish I could meet with every one of you over there I believe there's a land Beyond this here Beyond this veil of tears and sorrows and heartaches I preached day and night I've stayed till I shut sh crying I've standed the platform until they have to pack me out why because I've tried to make up for the time that I lost back there and so all of a sudden he feels himself going back and he said you're going back Bill promise me you won't worry and he said just then I come into the room and it was dark and I could feel her arm around me patting me and I heard her voice I thought oh it can't be it can't be the vision's over and I I stood I shook my head I looked and her arm was still around me and she was patting me and said Billy promise me you won't worry no more I promise hope and she took her arm away and that was all of it I've never worried since I tell you brother a real anchored faith in God can stand take it stand upon the beaten rock of the rock of Eternity and stand there and look off into the heavens when the waves and things are beaten against its bowels and look to him and say I am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die brother it takes something here in the heart now as I as I look at this for a moment and of course for many of you I've went over this before and maybe have done it even in the Pulpit but now that we are past the event let me just bring it out again my observation of the vision that uh that in 1965 when brother bradam left this Mortal life and just past the wreckage of his station wagon the modern day covered wagon waited Sharon Rose to greet him yes sir and this dream or Vision that he was visiting there is a mortal but Sharon Rose was in a theophonic form and she was no longer an infant but a grown woman and and those in theophonic form understand things that Mortals do not she recognized him he did not recognize her she told him there aren't any babies here Daddy we're all the same age we're Immortal and so you know she told him said you remember how you taught immortality which he hadn't taught immortality that way at that time this is very very early in his ministry and so and then she she also was waiting patiently for her brother Billy Paul to come she knew that he would be coming and she was waiting at that Gateway between Dimensions now here's the facts if we are alive in physical form in our Corporal bodies when the Lord comes those in the ovic form will appear to us and we will Unite and resurrect uh are they will appear to us and will unite and resurrect and glorify their body if we die we go to join those that are in theophonic form and Sharon Rose new Billy would come to her she was waiting for his arrival now the vision showed us then that brother Billy would go by the way of the Grave that the Saints there were expecting his arrival now so you see with them expecting him they knew he was coming and I I just want to say even this moment that we're in as we are now past that time where brother Billy now has went there and he's had this Reunion where Sharon Rose has met him and he's had reunion with the rest of the family I I I just want to say God knew we would be here that's right even as this time and so we know the vision is transpiring right around us right now where where uh so we're we're not we we're not be beyond what God had planned we're not in some kind of overtime or Pastime or we're exactly where we're supposed to be in the vision and so you know here we we know now brother Billy has met with um sister Sharon Rose I I want to just share with you the quotes from who is this MDC which I draw my understanding from that when a man is Born Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit babe in Christ and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there's a natural body theophany a body not made with hand neither born of a woman that we go to and then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body and then he goes on to say second Thessalonians tells us that we will meet him in the air a beautiful type of Rebecca meeting Isaac in the field in the cool of the day we will meet him in the air second Thessalonians tells us also for we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of God God shall sound the dead and Christ shall rise first we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air Perfect all these types therefore the theophany if you have died and entered into that theophany what happens that the aony comes to the Earth to pick up the redeemed body and if you're here in the air you take the body to meet the theophany there you are caught up and go to meet the Lord in the air so the vision is clear it told us if we had listened that our precious brother Billy Paul would not be a part of those that are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord and he has now preceded us as many others have before us now of course this comes to question and you know I made some comments about this that I'm going to share with you many of you heard of the test testimony where brother Billy Paul um told was he was there in front of the May building in Los Angeles and um and that his daddy told him that he would not be an old man when um when sharks was swim at the May building in Los Angeles and I I just want to just say to you first of all two things we have been we have been absolutely adamantly told by brother brandham say what I said on tape so you know there are many many stories of many many different ones and you know many many different ideas that comes from these stories but you know if you really want to know what he said listen to the tape it it isn't on tape then put a big question mark on anything you hear so as as to his daddy telling him um that chucks would be swimming at the May building in Los Angeles the account was not a part of the prophecy and this is important because there's a difference between us as men speaking and God speaking so you know we can speak and have the human desires and uh ex you know human expressions or we can we can desire things to be or we can hope they're going to be or we can make presumptions and uh presumptions and brother Brandon said himself uh many times he said now I'm presuming here that means I'm venturing without Authority so we know that as a human that he could do this but I want you I want to just take you to the service of the prophecy that was took place in Los Angeles California 1965 on April the 29th it was on the evening I believe this was at a full gospel businessman's meeting and and you know the Holy Spirit was moving in a tremendous way and brother brandham is speaking here under the anointing of the spirit of God I want you to listen to the actual prophecy stop is man look at your your Creeds that you serve look at your churches is it with the word of God have you met ever qualification say I'm a good man so was Nicodemus and so was all the rest they were fine say I don't have nothing to do with it and women I want you to look in the mirror and look what God requires a woman to do and see in God's miror not your church maror now in God's maror and see if you could qualify in your life the spiritual of Jesus Christ ministers think the same do you cut Corners here to save somebody's feelings over on would you do this if it wasn't it that put you out of the church if you are feeling that way my dear brother let me warn you in the name of Jesus Christ flee from that right now that's and lady if you can't measure up to the qualification of a Christian not as a nominal Christian but in your heart and your life is patterned exactly like God's marriage system that can ear say it has to be and church member if your church isn't like that and measure up to God's qualification of his word get out of it and get into Christ that's solom warning we don't know what time you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out here at the bottom of this ocean oh cerum said Jesus thou who exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell for if the mighty Works have been done in solom and gomorah it had been standing to this day and solom Gomorrah lays at the bottom of the Dead Sea and capernium in the bottom of the sea thou City who claims to be the city of the Angels who's exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of f and things even the foreign countries come here to pick up where filth and send it away your fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you will be laying in the bottom of the sea your great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of God is Bing right beneath you how much longer you'll hold this sand bar hanging over that on that ocean under a mile will slide in there come back to the Sal see It'll be worse than the last day of palain repent Los Angeles repent to rest of you and turn to God the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth flee while there's time tole and come into Christ let us pray dear God but my spirit is shaking my heart is dropping tear drops of warning oh God that men and women will not think of what I've said as a joke and the church people will not think of it as something that was Prejudice or against them may they see lord it's in love thou bear me reord almighty God up and down this Coast I went year after year proclaiming your word me record oh God happened tonight I told the truth thou knowest this vision of the Bride is the truth I've took your name by Lord and said it was thus sayth the Lord and I feel I'm conscious Lord of what I'm doing so I pray the Lord in Jesus name let people shap themselves tonight and flee from the Wrath that is to come far e is roll over the doors and over the Nations a black check mark has come across it the spirit of God has breathed away from it and they're waiting in the [Music] bound the Beast of King Nebuchadnezzar has repeated again with drunking parties and half dressed women calling themselves Christian oh god of Heaven have mercy on a sinful world and a sinful people Lord As We Are Tonight God I'm trying to stand in the prach and ask for divine mercy that you will speak into this crowd tonight and call your bride to attention Lord to March not by the sound of any Creed but by the sound of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ gred oh God let it be known this night that th God and thy word is truth while Solly in the face of his people we call them to attention of our word in the name of Jesus Christ I pray for them Lord they have seen you beyond any Shadow doubt move across their crows and tell much in their heart thou knowest Lord right now what's going on thou knowest that to be truth oh God I pray the in Jesus name let the Holy Spirit intercede again Lord and pull from this audience are those who are written in the land's Book of Life oh God pray with all my heart these people naturally Lord would give me the last p had to support the message they do anything that they could but oh God when it comes to C with it and coming into it I pray God that this will be the night that you reward them and pour down your Holy Spirit upon this convention and may not be aing or jumping around but a weeping and a crying and a repenting holding on to the hor of thear while we see judgments rolling beneath us tonight gr God pray sincerely as in the name of Jesus Christ my brother sister I I don't know what more to say if I found Grace in your sight by the power of God if you believe me to be his Prophet this is the first time in public I've ever SE said that but I feel a strange warning of some I'm not prone to this you know I'm not I don't act like this I hesitated to speak that message and say those things I run sideways and everything else to keep from doing it but it's been said they don't stand the day of the Judgment a witness that have told the truth that all p run for your life we to the horns of the and Crow before it's too late an hour will come when you cry do good for ES s to find the place of his birth and couldn't I convince you old California old Convention of the Full Gospel businessman who I love who I've left and Str to you with all my heart I commit you to Jesus Christ tonight B to him don't let the devil ever to you off from this stay right with it until you're everyone filled with the Holy Ghost in so much that'll make you come to this word that'll make you women straighten up that'll make you men straighten up if you say you've got the Holy Ghost and w't cope with the word it's another Spirit In You God's spirit is on his word the Messiah the anointed the bride must be a messiah the anointed word let us stand on our feet in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as you can see this prophecy never did speak of brother Billy Paul and sharks at all but this was a conversation they had with his dad the days in the in the following days as they stood near the May building in Los Angeles and my best recol recollection was that he asked brother Billy he said Billy where are you standing he said well I'm in Los Angeles California and he said he wanted him be more specific he asked him again said Billy where are you standing and this time his answer was more complete he said I'm standing in front of the May building in Los Angeles California and to this response brother brandom said you won't be an old man when sharks will swim here' now of course after brother bram's death you know brother brother Billy hung on to every thread of Hope of his dead dad's return and adamantly told around the world that he was not an old man even when in fact he was and of course he the older he got the more he was open to question and ridicule he told me privately um after I had discussed this with the church and the clip was sent to him he sent me an email and he said this is the the the thing that I'm asked most often is this question and he said I don't know what to say other than daddy said it and I I you know I just posed the question was this a father trying to get his son to understand the seriousness of the hour and his belief that an earthquake would happen in Los Angeles in days if not months or even a year we don't know we just know brother Billy has now passed away at 88 years of age but sometimes things happen in a way we don't expect and and of course no Los Angeles is not laying in the belly of the sea but what about the sharks that are swimming at the May building it was in 1970 and in those years and that decade that brother Charlie Spencer and his wife was listening to Paul Harvey news and Paul Harvey was one who told the news in an interesting way and sometime it was humorous unusual events that were not often reported in the mainstream media in this particular report they heard him say there had been an earthquake in that Los Angeles area and that sharks had been seen swimming there near the May building now this same report was confirmed also by a brother who attends brother Jason Watkins Church his sister worked in the May building and a memo had been issued from management not to go uh in certain areas there but sharks had been seen swimming there so you know um things can happen in ways that you don't even realize and brother Billy wouldn't have been in the old man in 1971 when when this earthquake which was there was a reported earthquake during that time but you know whether they were in the drainage ditch or where where they was I don't know I don't know all the the situation I'm just giving you the report you know two witnesses reported they had heard the news or another had received a memo working there at the May building so things can happen in ways that you don't even expect but but nevertheless even if it even if it did or didn't happen it's not even a part of the prophecy it's just a father speaking to a son telling him uh that he believed that it would happen in his lifetime that it would be an event that would happen within maybe days months if not a year but of course now we're many years past that but that doesn't mean it won't come to pass sometimes God's wheels of Prophecy they grind slow but sure but they finally get there and they come in ways a lot of times you do not expect and even though that the vision carries uh it causes the prophet then to be mocked and I just want to say today that we understand the vision that the vision um are the the prophecy told us about Los Angeles said nothing about shark swimming at the May building that's a testimony of a son speaking about something that his father said to him and we don't even know why that he said it or what the circumstances was it could have been to get a young man to realize the seriousness of life and the seriousness of the hour and to to step up in his walk with God now today we're going to go from that as I wanted to cover that in this first part you know uh and and now we're going to move beyond that as I go into my sermon today and I'm going to be speaking on the birth Pains of a nation and uh as you know I re re rep to you the vision brother Bram had of coming down looked like he was coming down the map of Palestine and he was coming to the Jordan and he could hear a song being sung that was said I'm going down to to the Jordan so you know this would help identify where he was at by the song and and he said as I drew near the river I looked back and seen the way that I'd come and I was 2third of the way there to the Jordan and he said I looked across Jordan and I said praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the Promised Land now of course he wasn't talking about Israel and Palestine but he was talking about the promised land that we possess which is in the Holy Ghost that is our promised land and of course it includes all of the word of God he would go to the end of that and he would explain it even a little more and said let's cross over now cuz it all belongs to us the en vision have never failed because they come from God and you know we across Jordan the separation God break to us the seals that's on the back of the book let us enter into this great place now for Joshua divided to the people their inheritance that God has left for them so again he he shows us what it means he said you can see now what it what coming down to Jordan meant that we're coming down to the breaking of the seals or the opening of the book or the opening of the promised land to the people of God and this has brought us to a great land that the Holy Ghost has divided for us it is our inheritance and we cannot deny or reject or refuse any part of it and neither can we afford to let any devil Camp upon it but but after possessing it we will also have to defend our borders it is not enough to possess some of it you see we must possess it all this is a age where you just can't just get a part like justification or sanctification or just just a you know a part of Holiness or part of this or the whole word the whole land must be ours and we must possess every promise it's not enough to possess a understanding of the seals being open and yet you're lacking Holiness it is not enough to possess Holiness then and deny that the Seven Seals have been opened you see it all must be embraced it is a whole land and we must possess every promise that lays in that land and we must defend our land I want you to understand it's not just enough to possess it you must hold it you see Israel today is in a fight for their life and so are we I just heard been uh uh Netanyahu say the prime minister of Israel said this is our second Independence war and we will fight on the land the air from the sea we will fight on the ground and under the ground and in this war we stand together this is the fight of our life well they' already had one war for independence but now they're having to have a second war for independence and and I I under we understand here we're coming down to this time where we're at and I feel like the same that is you know we're we're here in a fight for our life we're here in a time where that we must we must realize this is for our independence this is for our freedoms this is for us to possess our land every promise that lays in the book now brother Brandon and I quoted this to you the last time I spoke but I want to bring it back to your Forefront again to your memory he spoke a a Thanksgiving service in sort Louisiana called The Invisible Union of the BR and it was this Thanksgiving service to to to thank God for what we have and he said that the the the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their Newfound way of life being separated from the old English denominations and Creed that they could marry to the new anointed word for their day that's right the new anointed word for their day and we can be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourselves from the things of the world and all of our Associates Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all dead religions I'm speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds and to and to what separated us and open to us a new land a new message for this day so we we understand the message is a new land amen now Israel coming out of Egypt was birthed into a new land as a nation they left Egypt and they were justified by faith and then they were Sanctified in the Red Sea and then they were birthed into a new land the land of Abraham Isaac and Jacob their stages of their journey is parallel or similar to the church justification by faith sanctification and then birth into the land of the Holy Ghost you see the land that land of the Holy Ghost is the land of the Apostles Peter John and Paul and this is similar to the birth of every believer every believer comes through the same Journey the Bible said in 1 John 5:7 for these three bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one understand these three are one there's not three Gods these are one you can't have the father without having the son who is the word and you can't have the son without having the Holy Ghost they are one and you can't separate them into three they are one but then verse eight says then there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one now they're not one but they agree in one it takes the water the blood and the spirit to agree or to make up one birth you see but you can be justified without being Sanctified and you can be Sanctified without being spirit filled but you cannot be spirit filled and not have been Justified and Sanctified it takes all three to make one New Birth now to explain to that you must repent of your sins and have them forgiven that's justification you must be Sanctified and then cleansed from filthy habits you cannot be born again or spirit filled and still smoke or dope or drink or snort or chew or watch porn or and deny Holiness because without Holiness no man shall see the Lord that's Hebrews 12:14 so you see so it is in the spiritual realm is water justification by faith believing on God receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized second is sanctification of the spirit that God cleanses the spirit from all the elements of the world and desires of the world and then the Holy Spirit comes in and gives a new birth and fills up that Sanctified vessel truly you're not really born again till you get the Holy Ghost you're just in the process of believing unto now so brother bam used for instance or an example he said a glass laying out in the chicken yard you don't just pick that up and put it on your table and fill it up with water or milk no you by picking it up it's justification you look at it hey that's one of Mama's dishes that's one of that's one some of our best that we we have look here this is a worthy Cup oh it's dirty it's filthy it's our out here in the chicken yard but then you cleanse it you take it in and you wash it washing is sanctification is washing because the Greek word means is a compound word which means cleanse and set apart for service it's not in service it's just set apart you can wash it up go take it back out in the chicken pin again get it just is dirty and filthy all over again this is a problem with many many people around the message they go as far as repentance get baptized in water and they quit their smoking or their doping or this or that and after a while the same old evil spirit that calls him to do it in the first place comes back again and is worse than there was at the beginning back out in the chicken bin they go and it brings a it brings a great discredit it looks like the gospel doesn't work but if you'll ever get sealed to the day of redemption amen if you ever get put in service in service you're not in a chicken pin in service you're filled with the Holy Ghost in service you're sealed to the day of redemption and there's a difference but you see this is where many have walked up to even in the message they've come that far like the pilgrim Holiness did or the Nazarene that walked right up even to to Pentecost he said you were cleansed by sanctification but when you were ready to be put in service by Gifts of speaking in tongues and other things you turn that down and drop back into the pin again now that's what happens so you see you know why because without the Holy Ghost you're going to fall back into the M of sin now the natural types the spiritual I'm going to get into my subject now As We Lay the background the natural types the spirit spiritual when a baby is born of course you know the the water breaks but the baby isn't born yet it's coming near the time of birth there again so there's water blood spirit Jesus said in John 3 and3 he answered and said unto Nicodemus verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God verse four Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he's old how can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born verse five and Jesus answered verely verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water in the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God and that which is born of flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is spirit so now watch natural typing the spiritual when the water breaks the baby isn't born and just repentance and water baptism is not enough and that's been the problem that we have faced over and over and over again we get somebody you know to receive the formula of baptism and see that's the way to be baptized and they repent of their sins and they get baptized that's not enough you're not born again yet you got to be cleansed you know we we then comes the blood and by the blood we are Sanctified but there can be water and blood and yet no life yet and as it's being born the breath of life has to come in and feel those lungs and brother bandam used this in in the message birth pains he said but in order to get life in the baby you got to give him a spanking and make him yell out somehow or another we got it around in our thoughts that the New Birth has no feeling no expression this is never brother Brandon's teaching all the way down to 1965 all the way from his earliest sermons all the way through he warned us against stillborn babies babies who were never receive life the manifestation of the Resurrection and he speaks of this he said you know where Jesus when where Jesus is there there's always a little noise a little upsetting why life comes in it brings noise if a baby's born it doesn't cry is dead that's that's what's the matter with the church tonight we need some more weeping breaking up in our services when Israel travailed children was born when the church travails children will be born you know again you say but brother Tim I I have asked for the Holy Ghost and I hadn't got it well go back and look and see have you been willing to deal with sin have you thoroughly repented and and is it just a a dry-eyed confession or is it out of the depths of sincerity where is this coming from is it something I know I need to do to get a boyfriend or a girlfriend or is it something I know I need to do to be socially accepted in this church what is it no you have to go back and you have to look at your experience and you have to say God have I fully surrendered everything have I fully yielded to you have I fully given over these things in my life let you sanctify it and cleanse it listen again he said in the resurrection he said a baby is born a baby's born still birth you you know what's the matter with the baby the baby's born dead and that's what's the matter with a whole lot of stillborn children in these formal churches today you're born dead you got a conception but you never receive life what to do with a baby like that is pick him up by the heels and give him a little posterior Pro protoplasma stimulation I tell you he comes alive right quick and if there's anything the church needs today is a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost spanking by the hand of God pouring out his power it'll make the church come to life now might be SE flat but that's the truth you'll spank him a little bit and he'll let out a Squall crying in the message birth pains again he says and you take a a little some kind of a shock maybe would I wouldn't have to SP him just shock him a little the very idea of him being born sometimes will do it grab him Shake him he don't start breathing spank him a little and then he yells out in unknown tongues to himself I guess and he anyhow he's making a noise and I think if a baby is born just by still birth with no sound no emotion that's a dead baby and that's what's the matter with the church today the system we got too many stillborn children that's right they need a gospel spanking you see so to wake them up and to bring them to the themselves so God can breathe the breath of life into them we know that's so it's crew theology but it's the truth anyhow again he would say if a baby's born and it doesn't cry or do something the baby's dead we got two many dead born babies in the church tonight that's what's the matter with the church it doesn't it just doesn't understand it is never come to life you know what they do with a little baby when it's born I've been I've watched them born the doctor picks him up gives him a little posterity protoplasma stimulation wakes him up right quick and he goes to squalling if there's anything to Pentecostal church needs tonight is a good oldfashioned gospel spanking to wake them up again the little thing get some starch out of them amen someone said brother brandom are you holding a meeting down there where the people are screaming carrying on I said yes sir said don't don't you think that's fanaticism I said no sir there's nobody in the world believes in any old time or Old Time shouting and blessings and praising God than I do I believe that I believe when a baby is born it don't move it don't whimper it don't do nothing you know what the doctor has to do he picks him up by the heels and gives him a little spanking he gets a little breath in him and I think that's what's the matter with the church tonight when people say I'm born again you know what it is it's a still born dead baby it needs a little gospel spanking once in a while that'll wake it up and get it to whining and crying that's right get some life in it that's what we need tonight that's what the church needs and then getting straight on the right path now you might wonder what in the world is a gospel spanking it must be a scolding or balling out from the pulpit I I want you to understand it's not discipline right I want you to look at your neighbor cuz you're really quiet on me today and I want you to look at him said it's not disciplined okay you got that now you see instead it's the action of the great physician with the power of God that stimulates us to believe amen and as you believe and as you breathe I mean you squir out so you know don't get in you know a lot of times you know glory to God we're going to get the church needs a good gospel spanking you think you're going to get a scolding or hiding that's not what God's doing he is sending a charge of stimulation of the power of God to bring an Awakening in the church so that stillborn babies will take a breath what can breath eternal life the Holy Ghost that's right now that's the individual well then what about the bride who is pregnated with the word I tell you what we got to I'm sorry we got turned a lot of this into dead Creeds and the dead words amen but we need a good gospel speaking not a scolding not a hiding not a bey but a stimulation of the power of God that makes that word live [Applause] again you see she has to bring forth Life by the spirit the bride too is in birth pain to bring back the Son of God the world is in birth pains to bring forth A New Earth and it's not going to do it quietly no it'll happen for the Millennium it'll happen again for the new heaven and the new Earth brother Bram explained to us the world is in birth pains and what you're seeing that is taking place even in the world right now is birth pains amen it's signs that there's there there is there's coming a a millennium A New Earth right that this one is dying and it's it's rotten he would take it compare it to seed and he said the seed has to get get rotten before the life comes out of it and as it dies New Life comes out and we're living in a Dying World with a dying Society with a dying nation and we're just on the cusp of total Destruction for a new Earth now with the first world war it went through its first birth pains you know birth Pains come most of the time light to start off with in comparison to the the final push and then that first world war the first woe they invented a mass killer that would blanket an entire area I'm not sure all of the chemistry of it was mustard gas chlorine glass whatever that would would go and and then and what they would do with it is just saturate a whole area with this gas and everything that that was gased there would die and people would fear that to the point of they believe that the world this would cause winds to blow it across the Earth and it wouldn't just kill people locally would but would be in thousands but of course it didn't happen as they thought it would but this was the fear and then as the pains become greater in the second world as World War II ended with the horrible Pains of a an atomic bomb that destroyed entire cities actually would evaporate you know just in a moment's time entire cities of of of of hirosima and nakasaki and Japan would caus them to surrender because they had nothing they had nothing to counter it and what they realize now would be the destruction of the entire Japanese uh uh lands because of this and so you you see it was great birth pains and now we are in the thresholds of the last wo the third wo the last World War is right now upon us oh yeah they're warning today that you know even in the news that there's a new front containing Russia and China and Iran together as a new front with all the Arabs Nations that they can gather to come against the west and they are warning there that we are being pulled into another world war it's going to happen church amen man may maybe it seemed like it won't but you know maybe it seemed like it's just went a long time like the California earthquake we were talking about that it's bait is time but it'll happen and the destruction of the world is about to happen in your lifetime now I'm not in front of the May building and saying to you you know you know trying to warn you I'm just saying signs of the time look where we're at never has there been in the hands of man the the capabilities now America alone has enough bombs to destroy the world 10 times over Russia has twice that many we're entering the last threshold of the wo or into the threshold of the last W as they look at it and they contemplate what will happen Washington DC will probably been hit in the first wave of attacks from there as counter Force evolves into counter value Russian missiles would begin targeting larger cities including New York Chicago Houston Los Angeles and San Francisco during the peak of the of energy output one megatom bomb one megatom nuclear weapon can produce temperatures of 100 million degrees cels at its Center about four to five times that which occurs at uh times that which occurs at the center of the sun nine countries possess nuclear weapons that we know about United States Russia France China United Kingdom Pakistan India Israel and North Korea Malachi 4 the very the very scripture that tells us that Elijah would come before the Earth was SM smoked with a curse you know to call out a rim for his name's sake that very scripture opens up with verse one said for the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud and yay that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayi the Lord of hosts that shall ne le them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name is there anybody here that fears that reverences his name amen shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as ties of the stor hallelujah amen there's going to be a people rise up in that day who will go forth mature people a mature elect bride because they reverence his name sir and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of host let's turn our eyes to Israel for a moment in the scripture Zechariah 12 and verse 2 give me verse one to begin with Zechariah 12 verse one the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel sayth the Lord which stretches forth the heavens layeth the foundation of the earth and forth the spirit of man within him behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem and in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people think of this a burd some Stone you know here here's the thing that troubles the whole world at the moment that they're all burdened it's a it's a it's a sar in our world today of what is happening in the Middle East and he said and all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the world or the people of the earth be gathered together against it look down at verse eight in that day the Lord shall defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem and he that's feeble among them at that day shall be as David and the House of David shall be as God as the angel of the Lord before him and I that day I will it shall come to pass and that day I will seek to destroy all nations that come against Jerusalem oh God grant it amen come on Church stop a moment as we're saying Amen to that and I want you to say as you look you realize this Bride is a burdensome Stone she is the spirit of Jerusalem and she's a bism stone to all the world to Satan and all his kingdom those little Fanatics those little Holy Roller men and women that believe in Holiness and righteousness and stands against the evil of the day against abortion and genocide and and the assisted suicide and all the other evils of of the world she's a burm Stone but I want you to understand in that day I will seek to destroy all nations they come against her and I will pour upon the House of David upon the houses inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and supplication and they will look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourn for his only son and shall be in bitterness for his firstborn so there we see Israel will turn and recognize the one that they have pierced you know here's the thing you know here's the problem with the with the Gentiles even right now they don't recognize that the word that they are crucifying is the only word that can save them but you have looked upon him who your own sins sent to Calvary amen you have received pardon and you have receive Grace right Hallelujah now verse 12 of chapter 14 and this shall be the plague where with the Lord shall Smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand on their feet their eyes shall consume away in their holes their tongue shall consume away in their mouth nuclear destruction that's right the Bible said it would happen we are here we are here Peter said and I'm quoting this from future home Peter said the heavens will pass away and Earth with a great noise such an explosion will rock it because it's going to kill every disease every thistle every every Thorn everything that's be done the fire will burn it up and it's not together just a literal fire it's also a holy fire we take Satan all of his all of his Devils both Heaven and Earth amen will pass away killing all the germs and insects and all natural life around it even the H2O the water will will explode think of it talk about a noise I know some of this is a New Jerusalem to come on the other side of the Millennium but I also want you to understand the world is about to see the birth of another world well we will walk out on the ashes of the wicked now brother Bron you think about a little noise out here in tuon that was something when he opened the six seals That Shook the round country round about and caused it talk wait until this Earth receives her baptism and you know when a man receives the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think it's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that just wait until the Earth getes her baptism so brother Bram compared the baptism of fire on the earth and the explosion that takes place and the noise that takes place there with the with the spiritual birth of a believer that when you are born again a lot of noise takes place amen and it eradicates sin it eradicates habits it eradicates come on church every kind of evil and makes you a new Earth for God to dwell in think about that like I preached two Sundays ago we have arrived we have crossed cross over from that inspiration you've heard brother Joe and brother Aron both preach the sermon but I want you just to remember that after seven Church ages after leaving the Egypt of Catholicism where we sojourn like Israel in a strange line with pagan gods the churches journeyed through the Wilderness of protestantism and coming through justification of Luther and Wesley Sanctified in the Red Sea we come up to Cades Baria and tasted of the Holy Ghost with ausus treat it was a taste but I want to to say we're back in the land of the Bible we are walking now where the apostles trod and the fruits have been amazing so many got to taste of it unfortunately many of them just went back camping in the wilderness built another camp out there you know as I Was preparing for this sermon I come across some things brother Billy Paul spoke of the deliciousness of this wonderful fruit of this land I want you just to I want you just to salivate with me for a moment about its deliciousness and this testimony told of one Miracle of this good land that has seldom been witnessed but it's there in fact of the many miracles he had seen he said none were quite like this one it was a little girl that came in the prayer line who had no eyes all she had was two little slits in her cheek with skin over it there were no eyeballs brother brandham looked at the child and said sweetheart you don't have any eyeballs do you believe what brother brandham spoke about you know he was told by the angel if you can get the people to believe nothing will stand before your prayers said yes said you believe if I pray for you that Jesus will give you ie she said yes he said everybody put your head down brother Billy testified everybody did but me CU I wanted to see it I'd never seen nothing like like this in all the Miracles and he had he'd seen Miracles unimaginable ER Miracles he he' seen a man who was walking like a dog on all all fors on his hands and knees and he watched brother brandham as he took the chain on around the man's neck and raised him up while every bone snapped and crackled and popped and straightened and went went into place as he commanded him to stand in the name of Jesus Christ and walk normal but he'd never seen nothing like this just a slit in the cheeks and brother Brandon prayed Lord Jesus cre in these eyeless sockets two perfect eyes brother Billy Saidi a witness to you I I guess this why I kept my head up so I could tell you this I I saw a streak come down and go into that socket and two crystals form I saw with my own eyes two crystals form two perfectly normal eyeballs brother brandom stopped in the middle of his prayer and said the little girl said little girl I forgot to ask you what color you want your eyes well I heard that blue was beautiful and said Lord Jesus give her the most beautiful blue eyes and out of that streak came a blue eye and another blue eye into each socket and she had two perfectly normal beautiful blue eyes Hallelujah makes me want to speak in other tongues this is our homeland and in it is amazing fruit it's delicious and there is more that you have not discovered you say well how could that even be possible to create eyeballs listen if God created the first eyeballs God can create the second thank you Lord this is the land of our fathers this is the land where Jesus walked this is the land where when a man came to him without eyeballs and he spot in the ground and with his mighty spittle rolled him a couple of balls out of dust and stuck it into two empty sockets and said go wash in the pool of salom that's right the fruits of these lands is not new it's simply new to us but it's the original word the true gospel that have been lost and this is only just showing his power amen I I just say to you today it's he can do exceed and abundantly above that which you're able to think or even ask this is a God who does impossible things that you cannot even think of how glorious and wondrous of what he can do this is the kind of God that will take little fragments of dust and bring them out of the dungs of lions and bears or tigers or whatever else that have been in the Arenas and there they were eaten and and there become dung on the earth and God take them there and bring them back again and there the theophany glorify it and step into it we've returned to the land of the Messiah yes Jesus Christ to the land of our fathers Peter James John and Paul the world is positioned exactly where it's supposed to be right Israel is exactly where it's supposed to be this second war for independ is exactly what's supposed to happen and we too are in a fight for our life we can look at the Sodom condition we can look at the White House flying it's pride flag and the president declaring we're a pride Nation they're giving voice to Sodom giving voice to the LGBT and as they say we're coming after your children well you're going to have to go in a Rapture to get them cuz we ain't leaving a hoof behind you would get them you would destroy them but I tell you God promise I am going to Rapture a church out of here and I'm going to take a people in the glory I'm not leaving them behind they're going to escape the things that are coming upon the Earth because they were accounted worthy to stand before the son of man and let the word judge them now so they don't have to go through the Judgment of tribulation I tell you right now let the word judge your sin Let it cut out your unrighteousness let it call out your wicked living whatever let the Lord do it now and Purge you now so you don't have to go through the tribulation for [Applause] purging because all will be purged you can get the purging of the Holy Ghost and let the fire of God burn sent out amen until it is no more amen or you can wait and wait around here and and what will you see you go to the tribulation for purging your choice you see we're not the only ones coming to our Zenith are to our crowning pointen the world is about to Crown Satan is King of the earth he will reign Satan will reign for a short season but the Church the true bride is also at her Zenith she's at her crowning point do you realize today that you are God's crowning achievement am what he always longed to achieve what he wanted in every age was a spotless bride he had it at Pentecost and she fell away and defiled her garment but there is a people in this day predestinated not to fall you are his crown and achievement that he'll lift up before Satan as he as we meet him in the air and he'll lift her up before the world and take her away that's right and way she'll go with him she has to be exactly like the pure bride she was at Pentecost before the fall at NAA and the vision speaks that in this last day there is another people in the land who are under their messenger are the final voice to the final age listen brother brandham right here in Freeport Louisiana you can still go by the Life Tabernacle you can look at the buildings on the side where where Anna jeene would type out the first newsletters where the type set was made for the book A man sent from God where they would declare Bible days are here again and I want to just declare to you Bible days are not over amen he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still God and he's still heals amen I say that right now in the face of what two of brother bram's children have now died of cancer where we laid a precious one sister Erica to rest the other day where our brother Ron is fighting for the Battle of his life but I want to still declare we have not lost we have not lost and we will not stop preaching that Jesus Christ healed and he's the same yesterday today and forever but now there's a resolve within our hearts like never before as brother Bram would look at cross-eyed children and not one of them would pass him by without being straightened because of what the devil did to his child I'm telling you it's time for the bride of Christ to get that same resolve brother brandham in the early days named his magazine the voice of healing to share testimonies of the wonderful Miracles that were happening that magazine no longer exist it's not needed for now the bride of Christ is the voice of healing let me just start with it just for a moment we can work from there some of the greatest healing miracles of this message are you let me say it again some of the greatest healing miracles of this message message are you John le Marie Jonathan Middleton Justin we who the Lord pulls out in the middle of the night in your pajamas brings you to an altar your life has never been the same you're one of the greatest healing Miracles Laura Hallelujah Loretta H you're one of the greatest healing Miracles Aaliyah God has taken wretched bent emotionally crippled human beings and gave them a new heart changed their spirit and their attitude and healed them from their sin so completely that his Spirit now abides in them they are trophies and they are voes of healing and voices of [Applause] Miracles we are the voice of healing we're the voice of Miracles we're the voice of Deliverance with the voice of Holiness everywhere you go brothers sisters your Holiness speaks even down to you William going to class just to get your your hunting permit your training for it and they and and the guy says where does he go to school well he's homeschooled no wonder said what a wonderful young man so different from all the rest what is it your Holiness is speaking what about you your sister you brother you may never preach a sermon in your life but you're preaching a sermon everywhere that you go your life is a sermon it's display of a miracle you're the voice of Miracles voice of Holiness Holiness is more than the way you dress Holiness is is there you don't smoke you don't drink you don't commit adultery you're not in b you're you're clean you've been cleansed it's the voice of Holiness you are the voice of mercy and you're the voice of judgment we must give voice look at Israel they've been attacked children children beheaded in front of their parents and then the parents slaughtered CT scans where they're burnt into such unrecognizable condition and find two spines spines of a mother holding a baby a child mothers burned with their babies women raped raped aped until their pelvic bones broken so brutal so satanic old young Israel has defended their land and they're trying to eradicate those demons but let me stop for a moment those S same demons brother brandham described them as the spirits coming from Euphrates two 100 million Supernatural Chargers and they come against Israel in a physical Manner and they're coming against you in a spiritual manner these are merciless horrible beast and Israel defending their land trying to eradicate those demon whose voice now is being heard in the streets whose voice voices are being heard all through the streets of Europe whose voices are being heard in in our cities the voice of the wicked whose voice is being heard in our colleges the voice of evil the voice of Sodom perversion the voice saying and holding up Palestinian flags and say you know we're going to we're going to cleanse you and push you to the city meaning there will be no more Israel so much as a hatred so much as a Venom and brother brandham told us the Same Spirit as a against you it comes in ecclesiastical manner it wants to take the rejoicing and the shadow of the church it wants to keep babies from being born it wants to kill them as soon as they're born it wants to destroy the church it wants to take Victory out of the house of God I'm telling you as I ended my sermon two Sundays ago there is another people in the land and they too are in pain to be delivered the bride is expecting the coming of the groom why would brother bandam tell us that the bride was pregnated with the word if there wasn't going to be a birth that's right that's right you come on somebody amen and we are in birth pains to deliver a bride for Christ brother Brandon preached birth pains the churches and birth pains and out of her would come a a bride and out of her would come an antichrist that's just as the tribe of Judah came forth Jes Jesus and Judah out of out of the church comes the bride of Christ and the Antichrist they're both religious the last sign before the birth of the Bride is a word coming to a prophet and then out of the word is birth the bride and we've seen in the vision we've been seeing in the vision that she has to be that same kind of bride the same kind build out of the same kind of material that she was in the first place and he says Now read Malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed to have a message in the last day that had turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to to the original Pentecostal message word by word Brothers we are here the sign of the son of man the fullness of the word was a great great birth pains now I want to just go real quick for a moment because you know you're living in a time where people are giving tribute to God and the and Isaiah 29:13 sums it up said wherefore sayi the Lord for as much as his people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honor me but have removed their hearts from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men so you know people have been taught to give a nod to God politicians talk about God church members talk about God but they draw nigh with their mouth and with their lips they honor him but the heart the heart is far that's why we live in such a religious Nation this nation gives a gives a lip service to God lip service but their heart is an evil heart and let me just say brother brandham tells us he said but the message has been going on for 15 years there been no organization from it said the Shu was the last we at the end and that's why there will be no move move of God Beyond this this message is the last move of God which will cresendo in the resurrection and Rapture and I just want to say no Prophet who Rises no prophet's son who Rises no Kingdom Builder will be successful God will not bless it it will crumble cuz there's nothing beside this that's right so you see the birth pains brother Brandon said what's the matter just a Remnant will be brought out and that's why I'm crying and straining and pushing and laying every aside every favor of man to find favor with God and just moving on his word Galatians 4:19 my little children of whom I travail in birth again to be till Christ be formed in you so she's in pain he said that's what's matter she's going to give birth there's handwriting on the wall now I'm just going to take the next few minutes you know we don't have but one service and and yeah I'm taking full advantage but I want you to just look how close we are to the Fulfillment of the vision I want you to help me check them off yes 1933 brother brandham received seven continuous Visions Bonito musolini will invade Ethiopia and take it the poor country will fall at his steps Italy will then try to invade other countries but will fail and melini himself will come to a disgrace disgraceful end check from Germany the young Austrian at Hitler will draw the world into war America too will go to war and in the process Franklin Roosevelt will be elected to the fourth term as president Germany will fortify herself Bes an extensive wall of concrete and America will pay a tremendous price in lives to break through this wall but Germany will be defeated and Hitler will come to mysterious end check and he would see Europe spreading out as a map before him he saw National borders altering and reforming into new political sections the voice said there are three political ideologies struggling for dominance in the world today fism Nazism and communism the first two will come to nothing but communism will FL will flourish watch Russia the King of the North check amen tremendous advances in technology sweeping over the globe among other Marvels he saw cars with streamline curves like eggs they didn't even have a word to Des to Define that until now we have the word now is called aerodynamics traveling down the road

wearing long dresses marching with Packards demanding the right to vote when the that right was granted he saw them elect a young man as president of the United States we're talking about John F Kennedy because of women and their vote women of women influenced politics we went from having no women in our sants and Our House of Representative till they're filled with women and queers then he watchs women cut off their hair put on pants while others shortened their skirts and made their blouses skimpier until the coverings were like that of fig leaves check six Vision he watched and There Rose in the United States a beautiful woman elegantly clothed she was either vice president or president or something but like that but rising in great power wearing purple a royal purple and despite her lovely features it was a hardness about her that defined description great power was given to her and she dominated in the the land with her Authority he was not sure if this was actual actual woman in the or the rise of the Catholic church we know now it was both we have another Catholic President come on somebody and a woman vice president and can you believe it holding the nation in their sway that I mean you've never seen the abuse of power that's right I mean the Supreme Court said no you can't give student loans free to kids you know you can't do that and what did he do he finds another way around it abuse of power on every side it ain't just that it's on everything biggest sneak we've ever had in the presidency he was not sure whether it was an axle woman or the rise of the Catholic Church listen I just want you to think it was both in this last election the US elected by the by votes of Sucker moms and panty wase a Catholic President and a woman as his vice president and she was dressed and Royal Purple check we've crossed over yes six Visions now yes sir six Visions now look over at your neighbor and say six Visions now and our nation is weak when have we ever been more weaker we've depleted our energy fuel Reserve we stripped our military instead of rugged men a bunch of women and gays have filled not only the ranks but but but filled the position of officers and now we can you know we ought to be we ought to be worried about America going to war with the mess that our military is in amen now we come to the seventh and final Vision he saw the United States stretching before him in in chaotic ruins craters pitted the ground and smoking de piles of debris back in the air as far as he could see the land was empty of human beings I want to ask you this morning how close are we to Armageddon I don't know I just know the bride's got to leave before that time and in this time of pain a bride has been born of the word we see the Earth is about ready to go and we see the church she's so rotten she's about ready to go and the birth pains is on all on on both the the world and the church and the rotness he's speaking of is the decaying of the seed as it changes and gives birth to New Life and we have arrived the world is in a rotten condition the nation is in a rotten condition Russia is in its place Israel is in its place there's a bride

Thousand-Year honeymoon first to the married supper of the Lamb there's a world that's in his rotten condition about to give birth to a new Earth and the righteous will walk out on the ashes of the

this this is your day your hour your visitation maybe those pains you've been feeling has been birth pains they coming out of your life listen I heard brother brandom say something years ago kind of confused me when he said it really I didn't understand and he said there will come a Phoenix again it'll be the coming of the Lord Jesus Jesus and I wondered what in the world does that meant and then I learned it a phoenix was a bird in Greek mythology that when it got old and feeble his eyes all crusty and it was now Earthbound and it was time for it seemingly to die and it reached that point there would be a fire that would burn out I mean bust out within that Phoenix and it would so completely burned the old bird and out of that fire would come a new phoenix flying out of it maybe it would be today that you need to lead that old life of your past and Ashes and I there come a new life maybe it be one day that we're going to leave this in the coming of the Lord Jesus all of this what you care and you think about and what you've worked for and what you tried for and everything else and it'll just be ashes but out of those ashes you'll be released into a new life I'm asking you today consecrate your life we're in the battle it's a war for independence it's a war for complete Liberty it's a war it's not a picnic would there be someone pray today and raise a hand to God said
