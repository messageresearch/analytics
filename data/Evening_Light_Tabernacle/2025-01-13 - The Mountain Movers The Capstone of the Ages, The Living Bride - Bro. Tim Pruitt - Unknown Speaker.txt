make me a son of God make me realize who I was and Who I Am Lord that I was yours before the world began and Lord your revelation of sunship is so important to us we know it didn't happen down at an altar somewhere but Lord it happened oh God in the Eternal ages Way Beyond Before Time When there we were attribute of you and then down at an altar someplace somewhere an altar in our hearts perhaps you revealed to us our sunship Lord we thank you for Grace we're asking for your anointing today because it's the anointing of God that breaks the Yoke break the Yoke of sin unbelief offer our lives Lord as often the prophet of God was would stand and pray in Lord forgive me of my sins I I don't think at all that it was some Grievous awful sin Lord that would maybe that we would look at like oh God adultery or smoking drinking ly cussing like that but Lord just the unbelief in our hearts Lord we stagger sometimes at the promise but may it be like Abraham that threw the cross Lord that it could be written of us that after we come through the blood that we stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but is strong in faith given praise to God I pray Lord you'll find faith in our hearts today that you'll reveal yourself through the word Lord and you'll make yourself great among your people deliver your children Lord there are those that we heard a prayer requests today and we know there are those that are shuttin that can't come and Lord some that are are miles away and aren't able to assemble Lord but they would love to be here today I I know Lord you'll bless your people oh God and you'll minister to them I also know present would be those that would listen in from different places that is icy conditions and they can't go to church and and they will be tuning in to our service today I pray Lord that it'll be more than them tuning in but you'll tune their hearts to the promise of the word and Lord that you'll work in their midst and you'll drop right down in this with them as they have service together with us may you appear Lord may you appear in this place today where the presence of God can be so real and so fresh anoint us a new oh God we stand here Lord in the in the last day and we're needing you father oh God so we're asking that you would Minister to hearts and lives as we open up the word Lord open up the pages of our hearts and write it in it so that we and the word are the same we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen amen God bless you in it wonderful to be in the house of the Lord and have this privilege that we have of serving him and and um and looking into the things of God thank you God bless you so appreciated the the songs and and the worship to the Lord and amen I I believe that he dwells in the Praises of his people he comes near as we worship Him and amen I pray that he'll come and draw night to you today and here's the thing about it he said you draw night to God and he'll draw night to you amen so if you'll just make a move toward him this morning I I know that he will he will move in your heart amen so if you'll turn with me to again to Zechariah 4 we'll look at verse 4 and 6 and quickly move on from there and says then answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zeruel saying not by might nor my power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of host who art thou oh great m Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall be bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen makes me think of that song we just saying Grace Grace God's grace let me show you another Capstone it's a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such things and she will be the Capstone Church of the ages so we're going to speak on that today the Capstone of the ages the living bride if you'll turn with me to First Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 we will see this church she is also the bride of Jesus Christ especially in this day where we use a designation between church and bride Church going to those through the tribulation bride being those who would be married to to the word the word would become their head and they would be United with him and go go to the marriage supper the lamb but yet at the same time you know what he said he said um I will build a church that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against so he uses the word church church church church church always but in this day because there is a division and a separation a lot of times we will refer to the church as being those who will go through the tribulation and that multitude without number but I want you to know this bride is the true church amen that's who she is first Thessalonians 4:13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them that are asleep that you sorrow not even as others who have no hope now when Paul wrote this there were very few that were asleep now they were slipping away one at a time here and there and whatever but there was actually very few of them because the Old Testament Saints had been risen remember if one Old Testament Saint had to REM had remain out of the presence of God in a in a place of of where the blood had not cleansed then Jesus blood was not able to compl completely eradicate sin but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter where where you were born or what you were or where you died or whatever else you know every child of God there in that that went to Paradise there under Abraham's bosom rose up with him so the Bible said many of the Saints that's because many that they thought were Saints weren't Saints but I'll tell you what all of the Saints rose with him he didn't leave a one he completely cleared the debt of the Old Testament aren't you glad for a god like that he'll clear the debt for you today amen but I want you to look here as they were saying ah these that are asleep so you should sorrow not even as others who have no hope aren't you glad for that hope we have for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus now this has been God's body his Temple that he's been building for Seven Ages and most of them now sleep in Jesus amen of the great number that will actually be in the great Rapture ahead there will be the greatest number coming from those that are sleeping Jesus there will be just a few that will be alive and remain but I tell you he says those that are asleep in Jesus will God bring with him now another group now that we want to talk about this Capstone that I want to speak about that we want to describe today she's at the top that capts off the others those who sleep in Jesus were a part of the building and we're using this term very Loosely now you know because in reality Christ himself caps off the church as he is the head of the body but before he comes Christ will be here in a physical form in a physical form now not in the body of Jesus but in the body of his bride the church think about that you are living in the bride coming of Christ is where he manifest himself completely in Bride form in a people now as we look at this we we know that these last ones these people who are alive and remain they will be the finishing stones watch now verse 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord oh this is absolute that we which are alive and remain you see this group unto the coming of the Lord they shall not prevent them that are asleep but for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout that's a message and that message will God gather God's elect from all four winds or four directions of the Earth where will it gather them to brother Tim to evening light Tabernacle no it'll gather them into Christ so again the the shout is the Gathering of the elect of God back to the word again so and with the voice of the Archangel ah Archangel that's interesting because only in Revelation 10 do you see the Archangel appeared in the last day the mighty Angel Christ and then he says and then with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds not rain clouds not storm clouds but Clouds Of Glory yes to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord God bless you you can be seated now as we are looking at this today you know we had just a moment ago a wonderful wonderful um testimony of our brother Tim Winters and and it reminded me of in my studies this week as I looked at a something about that would go right along with this because you know you are looking for mountains to be moved in your life some of it is sickness or that you need healing or Deliverance or whatever you're looking for mountains to be moved and a lot of times you're wanting these mountains to be moved instantaneously or spontaneously but I I want you to listen to the prophet of God when he talked about your healing and here we're going in this just for a moment just deviating into this thought to go with brother Tim's testimony he says now lots of people they say pray for me brother all right Lord help this dear brother give them a prayer cloth and best you can and he seen others healed right night after night and time after time but I didn't get it so I'll try again tomorrow night Oh my he says you discredit God you discredit his word watch if you believe in your heart that it's being done maybe that mountain looks just exactly like it always look but in your heart you believe it there might not be but one little grain of sand but something is tearing loose amen you see something's beginning to take Place see when we believe that it's being done but you see we want something spontaneous and what do we do what do we get left out left out because it weakens so you know when you don't immediately see a result you said well God didn't hear well God does and God responds and remember your mountain is already moving whatever you've been praying about your mountain is already moving you may not see the results yet maybe you're looking for changes in your family maybe you're looking for a wife who is who is uh out from under the the the realm of Grace and you're you got a confusion in your family and everything else well well you know let me tell you your mountain is moving the moment you prayed things begin to happen but you see you got to stand there keeping believing no matter what you see it may get worse she may go on the Tantrum she may she may just go wild and go and leave you your children may just go wild no matter what you see amen you may see your condition in your flesh get worse no matter what you see you believe it's being done I can't see the results I I can't feel the results in fact my feelings are telling me different but I am taking God at his word he said I so I have spoke to this mountain and this mountain is moving in my life amen and maybe I don't see big results yet it doesn't matter one grain at a time but one day it'll be one grain two grains 10 grains several fulls you know truckloads full and finally you you know on and on and on until half the Mountain's gone and then it's all gone you just keep confessing you keep looking now when we're talking about this wonderful Capstone here that Zachariah is preaching about and uh and he's prophesying of zerubabel and and as you know this has been an insurmountable Mountain it looks like Jerusalem will never be restored and things will never take place you know it's been years now in Ruins and there isn't even anybody that can be around to tell you how it even looked and where these Stones going and how it's going to be and he's got a mighty task in front of him it's insurmountable it's a mountain and zachariah's prophesy and said it's going to be moved this mountain is going to be moved and it won't be by man's might man's Wisdom Man's power but it'll be by my spirit sayith the Lord God's doing this oh if we could just realize for a moment God's got this he's got your situation he understands what need that you have in your life and you'll commit your way to him he'll go to working on it and he says he says by my spirit sayeth the Lord so you know here again um this was he said you're going to even see the Capstone you're going to see the finishing star zable because it it's going to come and and remember how it's going to come it's going to be Grace Grace unto it now when we're talking about capstones you're usually about three different things and I want to go over this again because people miss it and and so I'm trying to get get you on board so listen carefully don't let somebody distract you but you know there there are three different ways that brother Brandon use this Capstone for different things and and of course you can't mix them you got to realize they're not all the same thing but they're all for to to to bring forth the right thing and one is of course in our day we had many many mysteries of God that was that was um uh that was veiled and covered up and and in confusion and so you see God would have to actually send an Elijah Prophet to restore the Altar and put the stones back in place sacrifice back in place and every everything back in position and then the fire would fall and vindicate it so you know again so God would God would again in this day we had a lot of stones that was to go and and Luther had been working in his day and he put the stone of justification in and sanctification under Wesley and restoration of the gifts under the Pentecostal zusa Street era but brother Bram looked at it and he said now there's going to come a Capstone and this Capstone will be seven Thunders which are seven voices of God that will cap off the mysteries of God so seven Thunders are the Capstone amen and it's something we had to receive in this day in order to rapturing Faith because why it gave us back the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now let's go to the next one now and here'll set that one aside and as you know brother brandham spoke of statue of a perfect man and and he said he's building the Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place and he says you know you start off with faith believe in God and and and and that that he referred to as a new birth now we know you know as brother brandom explained especially in later years he emphasized it and said now that's terminology and he says but that's just believing on the Lord right there a real New Birth is when you and God are united together in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but here in this teaching he said you know people are calling this or we're calling this Born Again by faith and we're going to add Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brother kindness and he said it is capped off with Charity which is God himself so the Capstone for the believer is when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that puts you and God together amen so if you have the Holy Ghost in your life you have been capped off you're a finished product you are sealed to the day of redemption isn't that marvelous amen he makes you a son or daughter of God and you're capped off so that is The Headstone that every believer must have otherwise you're unfinished amen and it's only those finished that is going into Rapture so brother Brandon would draw it out like a pyramid you know starting down low and coming on and coming up and then he would compare it with the Seven Ages now we've been speaking on this for some time this uh in in in weeks going by I'm just recapping now and so in Seven Ages he said God would build a church and that was he would start out with Ephesus and and Smyrna and Sardis and on and on and on till you finally get to leoa and then of course he would cap off that finished church with Christ himself which is the physical return of Christ so you see again you have the headstone over here which is the seven Thunders the voices of God capping off the Mysteries You've Got The Headstone which is God himself capping off the individual and then the whole body of the Bride is capped off with the coming of Jesus Christ and let me tell you we're not complete until he comes now brother Brandon would tell you over and over again and this is what we're going to be looking at is that that last age he said now you know you start down wide at the bottom he said you couldn't put the Capstone on it you know it would it doesn't fit and so it keeps moving up up up up until finally the capston got to fit or should I say it this way the last age and the last people have to fit the Capstone and that Capstone is Christ so there's a people on earth that is going to match him is't that amazing isn't that wonderful what a promise leads out before us that no matter what you see all around you and the confusion the trouble and whatever around you know he's not through working he's not through honing he's not through fitting stones into into the into the church and the and the last stones are going to match him perfectly and the same Ministry the same works the same attitude that Jesus had will be in this last day bride now that's why we are speaking about her as a Capstone because she C the living bride caps off all the rest of them and matches the Capstone completely now as we look at this there is all kinds of prophecies in the tie you know God foreshadowed it and showed it over and over and over again about these people who would be the redeemed ones who would receive not a gift of the spirit not not an anointing of the spirit but the person himself would Unite with them they they would be the very embodiment of deity and and so he would show this in the types of what this bride would be and I don't have time to even go into allall but I want to just just stop just for a moment because there just a few just right off the top as I lay in the bed the other day in the morning and as I was reflecting and going over these were ones just come up to me and and I I just thought about Adam you see God had done this with Adam do you realize Adam was a Capstone he was the cap off of all of God's creation is that right he had started down you know of course he'd made an earth that was for his domain he had trees and and and started like an evolution and build it up from the small things up and then he comes and and the bird life and and reptiles and amphibians and reptiles and from there to mammals and and he's building and he's building he building and then his crowning his crowning of the whole thing was a man in which would be the which would be a Son of God are you with me amen one that would be in God's image so you see he's actually as he's doing he's prophesying of what he is going to have in the last day of people in his very image my now think about that they would be there as Adam lived in Eden even so this one would bring about a restored Eden even as Fellowship would be before again as it was before the fall between God and man I'm telling you friends I'm talking about the last people I'm talking about the last people I'm talking about the top and I'm talking about the top there being ones that would Fellowship again as it was before the fall amen you you say brother Tim I need some scripture for that he said well then we would come boldly before the throne of grace finding help in our time of need if that isn't restored Fellowship what is it and then I look at it again and I look at them as ones when even sin entered in and it was all hopeless and it looked like you might as well throw in the towel God your enemy come in and and ruins your Eden and contaminated man and now his own vile nature lives in them but as they go out of the garden condemned God says wait a minute wait a minute thy seed the woman's seed will bruise the head of this serpent amen there you see it was there in the Eden that a people entered into death and mortality but it is here at this last day that a people alive and remain at the coming of the Lord cheat death and it will bruise the head of the serpent and Triumph changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye brother that's profound that's awesome and to realize you've been chosen you are the chosen generation for that amen now as we are seeing this you know again we see even another type of Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesying of us showing that the seventh Church age takes the Rapture and you know anoch walked with God and was not for God took him you see again you know it's prophesied in the life of Noah and which is also a type of the Bride go get Noah go get um some porous wood get some porous wood go for wood and it's full of pores and it's a sorant and build the boat with it God that won't float it's going to what what will happen this this is what will happen when you put that in water it'll absorb it all he said but you didn't let me finish Noah line it with pitch go cut down an evergreen tree and bring the life out of that and put it into this poorest material and it'll be an impregnable Fortress against the tribulation coming the judgments that are coming somebody help me preach amen I want you to understand that's exactly what God did with you he took poorest Humanity amen you know how poorest you was you absorbed the world you absorbed every Dirty song Every Lie every this every that you was attracted to it but God Eed you out and took down and cut down a tree which was Christ himself the Eternal one and took the life out of that and put it in the in you to make you a part of this Ark that's right so that we could escape the Judgment Waters and guess what when they all when the elect entered in God shut the door sealing out the Judgment I want you to know Church you have passed from Death un life I I know in the large type it know it will type the tribulation sints but that's not why we're using it and we we want you to understand you are escaping the Judgment the condemnation upon this world because why God has prepared you as a vessel to be able to go through the the the the world itself and never absorb it and pass right over it into the new land oh Hallelujah into the new Earth now what about Abraham and Sarah Abraham and Sarah was another prophecy and laying there in the scripture and they were a couple an old couple an old couple who were looking for a promised son and whose body got changed to receive it now sometimes we don't understand why things happen the way they do in the scripture but isn't it something that Abraham would actually would they would record a story of him lying and him staggering in his faith that God was able to keep them and all of this and and it would record of him you know telling the Philistines that oh this is woman is that's my sister but it it allowed us to get a Viewpoint that when ailec wanted her what in the world would this King want a 90y old woman amen he wouldn't want that for his harm come on Amen now no offense to anybody 90 but even in 70 I'm not ready to marry something like that amen yeah it's like brother Jeff told me about his father father-in-law somebody has said to him um one of his other siblings said or or je siblings said to um Jeff dad you know what uh you ought to look around and there ought to be some of these little Widow women around here in town that you could you could go out and you know you don't have to live alone you go out and marry he said no I don't believe I want to do that he said sides have you looked at women my age you know there's something about Youth and whatever that is that's appealing and this was what it was to aimc aimc looked out and he he sees this young woman and he wants to marry her and she's 90 amen what did that tell us that gave us a view that this woman was changed she would have to be changed to be able to carry a baby see our milk veins was dried up for years and years and my goodness but all of a sudden there's a spring in her step there's a change that has happening and I want you to know it probably didn't happen overnight it was like that Mountain Moving amen so you see again again you see their bodies was changed to receive it now what could we say of the many Patriarchs a Moses who led Israel out of Egypt under the token of the blood Fallen a pillar of fire his ministry types this Third Exodus what about a Joshua placing Israel in their inheritance and we we have received the inheritance we have received to go to and returned to the land of our fathers what about Samson a church raised up to destroy the kingdom of hell and you can look at him and see the defeated Church come on but lay laying his head on the lap of a prostitute and what has happened to the ages we have been the chrisom has been contaminated with the horror of Revelation The Book of Revelation and and so you know then was blinded by her and and by them and yet while in prison while in bonds amen his hair grew out his Covenant was restored and and and here he cried just once more Lord what was it showing that the church who had started out in power and would go down in defeat would come again in the last day restored to the same power and actually do more as Samson did than what they did the first look at Joel's prophecy prophesying of Israel returning to their land but in that prophecy laid a greater Pro Prophecy of the outpouring of the spirit and of restoration and so when God said I will restore this was the scripture that Peter grabbed a hold of and when the Holy Spirit came and he said you know th this is that which the prophet Joel spoke of and if here in the last day it's it's the same outpouring as God finishes the work then we can look back to Joel chapter 2 and see you know yeah the church got ate down through the years and went down in defeat in so many ways and was carried off to Babylon and and and here the the Army come in instead of instead of a locust and a caterpillar and a Palmer worm and so on it it would be a white horse a red horse a black horse a pale and would strip the church down and that would be the church coming down in complete defeat carried down into Babylon bound down with Traditions but amen that's not the end of it for he says I will restore sayth the Lord what all the years of the cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer worm the Locust yeah but it will not only be the word it will manifest its power for to be the true word it has to be in spirit and truth I know we put a lot of emphasis on the word and many times that emphasis is on the mechanics but I want you to know it is you know even Paul after doing all the Mysteries and revealing all these Mysteries truth he he reminded him and he said but this gospel did not begin in word only but in power this not how it came it didn't just come with word only but in power and much assurance and I'm just going to tell you it must not end just in word only that's right just us embracing a new theology that is different from all the denominations but also the power of God to go with it amen now brother brandom tells us uh clearly that the Dynamics and the mechanics will be together amen and he said that's where Satan got into it listen carefully that's where Satan got in it to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics or back all Dynamics and no mechanics because here you had you had the fundamentals and the Pentecostals he kept talking about one of them's all mechanics no Dynamics the other's got Dynamics no mechanics the word's missing so he says we got to put it together we've got the power of the Holy Spirit but we got to come back with the word to feed the machine now he's speaking here to the Pentecostal group he said we've got the power of the Holy Spirit but we've got to come back with the word to feed this machine and we can't feed it on Creeds it won't burn it chokes up the flu it will not burn it it's made for the word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God but yet at the same time I want you to understand this word in his power will be the stone the builders disallow but God will make it the head of the corner but you know you know I just want to say to you no matter what kind of confusion we see and trouble that we see in the world and trouble even that we see in message ranks I want to say it today clearly someone somebody will accept him and Revelation 10 shows this the mighty angel coming down with the open book restoring pen Pentecost again amen you say Pentecost yes that was exactly what the prophet of God was to do turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers not Aza Street they were Pentecost that's right now and there will be somebody somebody who will take that book and eat it and manifest deity and his power in their lives for they speak out I want you to notice they are the last prophecy because they're prophesying again bringing the same prophecy that Paul brought amen come on the bride will have the final prophecy Revelation 108 he said thou must prophesy again you see the same prophecy that Paul had the same prophecy that they prophesied and preached as the Spirit came down at Pentecost we'll prophesy again now prophesying is is a work of the supernatural through a man or woman who is speaking out the word of God now let me tell you the word the message came as a shout and that message has been consumed consumed these past 60 years but it must be prophesied and manifested amen I I don't mean just taught teaching is not preaching it is demonstrated the gospel it must be demonstrated now brother brandham told us it is in the in the sermon um what shall I do with Jesus it's uniting time of God God and his bride to and I say this with reverence and respect I believe the bride of Christ is called I believe she's sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there and they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth and the glory and the Rapture I believe it with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is a Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming oursel into his image and see uh him uniting himself with us in his work with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper oh my you mean he will hand out love gifts just before the wedding supper and he said we're waiting watching for that he and he said now they're big church out there they're all being united together but the Dynamics of this church is going to be different from that because the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that and even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the sky the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen so instead of less of the spirit amen there's a bride promis more of the spirit till it crescendos to the point the dead in Christ rise now in three kinds of Believers brother Brandon would talk about the three kinds you know the make believer the unbeliever the make believer and the True Believer talks about Abraham how that Abraham stagger not at the at the promise of God and the impossibilities he didn't consider even his body now dead you see that's what you do with Divine Healing or any prise you don't consider the negative you consider only the positive only what God said he said we're going to have a baby 25 years later he still said doc you still holding that hospital open you see it makes you act funny your decisions are odd to the world but it's a a Believer no matter how strange it seems you see the Bible said that he was fully persuaded God was able to perform what he said he would do the Bible said of Abraham that he was fully persuaded that God was able to perform what he said he would do that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon God is able to keep every word that he said he'll do it I don't care what denominations say words um days of Miracles has passed all this is telepathy and and it's all fortune telling it doesn't matter to me what they say I still believe if that gun is zeroed to the Target it'll Hit the Target and I believe if a Believer is zeroed with the word of God it'll hit the same thing if the word of God ever promised it it'll do it again I'm fully persuaded of that then when we see we're in this age when it's supposed to be here it's supposed to be here these things are supposed to take place that's the reason that I believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the Book of Life there will come a sound from Heaven that'll take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that it take her off of the Earth from the earth in a rapturing Grace God promises don't care how many science or how many astronauts they signed up and everything else and how many millions of miles they can say I don't care nothing about that there is a heaven and there is a literal Jesus Christ there that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself and no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth God said so that's what what Believers believe God said I am the Lord that heals all th diseases I'm God I change not amen and God is word and if God don't change how is his word going to change I am God and I change not you see he can't change so but I I just want to ask you again as we consider the words in Revelation 10 eight that thou must prophesy again then how is this even going to happen without being prophesied amen you know that's why I say Minister Brothers everywhere prophesy amen you you you you get what you expect so preach it so the briide will expect it amen don't don't be don't be satisfied with whatever feeling you've got amen say God pour out into me your fullness until I'm changed are you with me amen so prophesy if you teach people you you if you teach people that they're just going to be denominational church members who just F A Pew and you know you got to struggle with all your problems s and know you can't overcome and you know we'll give you some lessons on you know that's all they'll be but if you teach them that now they are the sons of God you are filled with deity then and that they can expect more than just a knuckle down to the devil that they will become more than conquerors amen Seed of Abraham that are called to possess the gates of his enemies faith will rise if faith is preached I'm going to say it again don't be satisfied with what you have and and and and people are so lukewarm I mean even to the point of church has become so lukewarm they're just happy with where with the status quo you know we got a few answered prayers we got a healing now and then I say expect a miraculous amen expecting to pour out his Spirit till it overflows amen don't don't just expect just a little bit come on I mean it's it's like it's like people all of a sudden gets into fense mode well we got miracles we got signs that's okay I'm not denying that I'm saying even among us we want more we're not going to be satisfied with a just a handful now and then we want the full possession amen amen Ruth in the Bible she got measures she got measures of barley and that was given to her that was sustainer for a while but she wasn't satisfied with getting a lap full of of bar barley and put in her veil and say okay we got enough to to last for a week no sir she said I I want more than that barley I want Boaz because if I have boas I have the whole field I have every premise I have the seed amen I have the king line amen I Hallelujah this is what will place me as the bride I want to be the bride I'm not just satisfied with that little handful dropped on purpose once in a while see it's written in the types you're going to be that Ruth that's going to get Boaz other ages they got a measure to sustain them come on gave them seven measures I mean gave gave them enough to sustain them for the time but this last one doesn't get a little another dose of barley she gets she gets Boaz she gets the king she gets the prize brother Brandon prayed in 1965 Lord dear Jesus as we assemble together again in your name with a great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power of God to bring us into recognition of our position in place our responsibilities as being a called people separated to the world dedicated to God lord tonight that the blessings of God will guide us and direct us in the things we do or say that it may be bring honor and glory to your name look look what he prayed great expectation that's how we should come together great expectation what for the outpouring of quicking power to bring us in recognition of our position our responsibilities and being a called people I know I know sometimes people sigh and say well brother Tim you you you're always just preaching the same old same old you know don't you realize Revival is over and every gifts on the shelf and you shouldn't even be preaching Divine Healing you know you shouldn't even preach those and we we got we we got so much greater to even preach well let me quote the prophet it's scripture and you can't preach the Full Gospel without preaching Divine Healing it's got to be preached to what to raise a level of expectation to create faith in people so if we do not preach Divine Healing we're not preaching the Full Gospel and the fullness of the word came by the opening of The Seven seal so that's what we are endeavoring to promote is the full word the open book and all of the word all of the word and Divine Healing is in the word come on if it's not in the word you can't have it but it's in the word now the third pull the opening of the word opens up and makes available more healing than ever not l as more in the fifth seal when the little Collins boy was brought into the room where the holy where the spirit of God day by day spoke out and and was a thunder of God that would re open a seal to the prophet you know the child had had rheumatic fever that was affecting his heart it was so bad the doctor said not even to move him and the parents brought him to that room and prayer was made and and not one trace of the disease could be found amen that's right in the midst of the opening of the word healing is coming out of the presence of the one who was given Revelation and then a NY year a little nine-year-old girl was brought with leukemia and the last stages had already turned yellow and was being tube fed and and just be before the child left after prayer it cried for a hamburger and a few days she's back in school was taken to the doctor she who said there's not even a trace of leukemia found in that child he said now that's instantaneously on the mark the power of God to take a bloodstream and cleanse it out like that and put the pulsation of New Life in there because your bloodstream is your life mortal and to create new sales and clean out the old and what did I'd say this it's the creative act of almighty God hallelujah creative act of almighty god listen the power of creation going forth as the third pole was being manifested in the opening of the seals and if we're recipients of that mystery then the creative power of God ought to be at work in the church he said bloodstream contaminated with cancer till the little fellow was yellow and puffed out in just a few minutes moment's time a brand new bloodstream then he continues he says I believe I'm not going to speak this in his name I'm going to speak it in the revelation of my faith but what happened in sabinaa Canyon the other day I believe the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored I don't know maybe you have different expectation from the prophet but this is what he expected out of the revealing of the word that it would manifest in his power he said where even the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the Creator I believe if he can make a squirrel that has no and here's a man or woman just just aart missing and that's a complete animal himself oh he's God yes sir so brother bradam in the revelation of his faith because of a king's sword come into his hand what he said what happened in sabinaa Canyon the other day what happened come on message Buffs you know a sword came in his hand I'm standing out here in this desert nobody with me in me with around me for miles and here I've got my hands raised up and a sword comes into my hand and I look at it and I say see it it's say a glistening sword and it just sprit my hand as I say it over and again th this was not this is not the prophet receiving it for this is you receiving it when Moses went up there and got the law it wasn't from Moses it was for Israel and when brother Bram received the king sword it wasn't for him alone it was for you God put a word in your hand and there somebody is going to fit them so you see where the king sword meaning to meant to him that the hour is coming that missing limbs will restored that's what it meant he said it means to me this this King sword what happened there means to me we're coming into a time where the word's going to be so pre prevalent in power that missing limbs will be restored well I'm reading that from first Thessalonians 4 come on we which are alive remain will be changed you think you're going in that Rapture with a missing arm leg missing teeth imperfections no you're going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye so brother brandham talks about this and he says you know Divine Healing is right the message is right the purpose is right it's scripture and you can't preach the Full Gospel without preaching Divine Healing now you know so many he said people think that Divine Healing is just a Hocus Pocus Affair it's plain simple and the Gospel of Jesus Christ So Divine Healing is the gospel down heal Divine Healing is the down payment or the earnest money on your mortal Immortal body it's the evidence you will have an immortal body and you want to do away with the evidence we're going to be changed come on brother bandam tells us in the in there he says you you'll see come to this platform little old crippled children Twisted children you'll see them stand here all misformed out of shape and you'll see it with your own eyes see their hands and arms come straight and walk off the platform normal children you'll see people come here that's got all kinds of condition and see them healed and leave the platform what is it that's the down pavement that's the earnest to know that that person someday if they stay under the blood will receive an immortal body am hallelujah amen so when we get healed it is the earnest the down payment of a new body and can you imagine that becoming less and less as we had toward the new body no it's going to materialize greater and greater so rather than there be less healing expect more healings amen expect God to reveal to you amen the down payment on your on your Immortal body your new body again he talks about this he said I have some man across everywhere across the country criticizing me about Divine Healing why my brother how could I keep from the believing in Divine Healing when it is the very nature of the Holy Spirit come on you know the the Divine Healing is not Hocus Pocus am man it's it's not listen it's not even just a fish attractant you know it is it is the very nature of the Holy Spirit every every man that's born in the spirit will have to believe in the in the Supernatural because he is a part of God he's an offspring of God he said you look like you're daddy you got a nose like you tell me I got a nose they tell me I got a nose like my dad I got a mouth like my dad he's my father I've got a right to look like him then if God is my father I have a right to believe in the Supernatural because I'm born of the supernatural spirit and that makes a supernatural being out of me inwardly now outwardly he said I'm a man of clay but inwardly when you're born in the spirit of God you become a supernatural being in there and that supernatural being hungers and thirst for his Heavenly home I got a new body waiting for me and I'm hungry and thirsty and I'm saying Lord show me you know give me a little more of that down pay amen come on give me a little more of the deposit let me enjoy what you did for me at Calvary let me take of that deposit and spend it Hallelujah I don't have to wait for the whole new body I can already amen because he made a deposit there at Calvary for me I can already begin to spend that deposit Hallelujah so if I need healing he paved it all now you think oh but old brother Tim the impersonators the impersonators Janice and jambre they just bragged about how great they were because of a miracle that that you know we should quit testifying on Miracles cuz you know but let me tell you they did it to make themselves big the bride does it to make God big to exalt the name of Jesus Take brother Brandon for example he told of his Supernatural experiences time after time I mean service after service he told it we and and you know and I one time it was in 65 after telling a supernatural experience he added he said that's not fiction that's the truth that wasn't back in Bible days that's now that's the same God that's always showed me these things and they come to pass exactly to the light letter never one time have they failed now I'm bragging on him this is what this is example of our Prophet I'm bragging on him how do you think it's in the Bible of the mighty America because it Jesus did why is it written there is because somebody bragged and testified and wrote it in the Bible I'm glad aren't you glad and that's what I'm going to do when Jesus comes and does something Among Us I'm going to brag on Jesus I'm going to tell of his mighty wonderwork Powers amen that this is not just back in the Bible days but it's right here right now it's for 2025 and it's not going to get less and I'm not going to keep silent about it now brother Brandon said now that's the reason I'm trying to say all that I can and you hear me bragging on Jesus always about Jesus Jesus always never myself it's Jesus you see it's him it's him it's him I have nothing to do with it I'm just his mouthpiece and that's us under our messenger we are the final voice to the final age amen and we are to be his mouthpiece because leod deia God sped it out of his mouth but he has now another mouthpiece in this day and if we brag on Jesus don't accuse us of being like impersonators who use their gifts to exalt themselves when we're exalting Jesus if brother brandom exalted Jesus by telling his wonders we're going to exalt Jesus at the book of Acts was written and told of the mighty works of the Holy Spirit then when the Holy Spirit does his Works among us we're going to publish it among his people for we are writing a book of Acts that's right how can it be written if it's not testified come on the devil wants you to hide your candle in a bush he wants you you know to to to be so afraid of oh I might I might be I I I might be trying to make myself something big listen it ain't about making you something big it's about making him big amen that you know he said oh my I love that I love to brag on him I love to make him big before the people I don't have to make him big he's already big he's so high you can't get over him so deep you can't get under him so wide you can't get around him and yet you got room in your heart for Him won't you receive him how wonderful our Lord is well brother you know all through the Bible they did this even in the Old Testament psalms 105 verse one put it up oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people this is a commandment of God Amen sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk you of his wondrous work oh let's let's talk about his wondrous work let's tell people he's still a Healer he's still a deliverer that he sets captive free listen it'll happen and and not even a man lay his hand on you didn't you hear brother Tim a while ago when I I stood there and said you can receive it right now in your seat and things begin to happen things begin to move off his Mountain right then listen it don't even take an altar call some people need to come to altar spend a Time die out but you can you can make that decision right now immediately you can be as long you know long as you want it or short as you want it you know I spoke with brother Jason tag and I just told him I said you know I don't care what you've been through just go fall in love with Jesus forget about everything else and what this done and what this one said and how this one mistreated you and this and that forget all of that get one that thing on your mind go fall in love with Jesus here he comes to another service or two and sitting back there you know while the word is going forth while the preaching of the word is going forth you know he he walks out and he doesn't even realize there's a change that has happened in me he doesn't even recognize somebody that what's even been done yet and sitting at the table hours after the service his wife said to him have you noticed something Jason what what no what are you talking about you haven't smoked I couldn't go 20 minutes he said without banging my head up against the wall for a cigarette but he said it was gone Not only was that gone but my drinking habit was gone the drugs was gone my desires were changed that's all it takes One Moment In His presence brother Tim did you do that no man can't do that I would be stupid to think I could do that but God is in the midst of his people and we're going to declare his mighty [Applause] Works sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk of his his wonders Works Glory ye in His holy name let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord in his strength seek his face forever more remember His Marvelous works that he has done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth Hallelujah brother brandham tell us in the Hebrew he said how can we escape if we neglect such you neglect to eat you'll die die you neglect to turn a corner you'll wreck you neglect to Milk The Cow she'll go dry you neglect your teeth you'll have all them pulled out certainly you pay for your neglection oh brandom Tabernacle and you visitors let me tell you something now you neglect to testify the glory of God you neglect to give God the praise and the glory you'll find yourself cold and formal and backslid in one of these days you give God praise and that's what happens you know again if we don't tell his mighty works then people don't know to expect his mighty works now I focus on this because if Satan can with his Antichrist Spirit he will try to make this bride cold formal and Powerless and he will take the miraculous from our midst he will try to kill the faith we have he will try to stop the word of Our Testimony that we overcome by and but I'm going to tell you he won't be successful for the bride will be alive and remain to the coming of the Lord and when Jesus comes he will find Faith there will be somebody that will believe him in the hottest fire the worst trials trials oh we're not tell me brother Tim we're not going to have no trials in 2025 out of great Trials Come great victories that's right you can't have healings without sickness you can't see Miracles without situation if everything's going to be perfect in this life we wouldn't need God his great attributes of healer deliver whatever wouldn't be needed now he didn't make us fall so that we'd have to go through this but knowing we would fall he was already a provider and I know during times of hard trials that when the voice of the enemy becomes so loud it nearly drowns out the voice of God listen David's own Brothers was his worst critics and they discouraged him and in his boast in the Lord they they called him a naughty boy told him to get back to his sheep they were just a worthless Shepherd and and he was not to forget it oh yeah that was David's brothers and and I tell you what David's Brothers will try to do that to you come on Amen just say you're just a naughty boy you're just a boy you know get back to your sheep all you are is just a worthless nobody just a shepher that's all you ain't got no business out here in the Army you couldn't whip a flea he would say later he' said by my God I have run through a troop and I've leaped over a wall come on church amen and I tell you don't be surprised when men who are supposed to be brothers and on the same team will ridicule and F fely accuse you and so sometimes you'll have to face Giants alone because no one else will stand with you do you think about it Israel let David go out by himself Saul who towered above them all let David go out by himself he didn't say hey I'll be your armor boy bear boy you got the faith you get out there I'll come up with my armor I'll stand right here by you while you slay that giant no I don't have nothing to do with that you go out there baby you risk your life I ain't got I ain't got I ain't got a dog in this fight they let him go out oh if he wants to make a fool of himself go out and do it but the closer David got got to Goliath I want you to listen to this the closer David got to Goliath the Roar of the giant was even greater you know way back over here on the hill somewhere and him in the distance he can just hear him you know kind of yell out over there you know it must be loud cuz I can hear it here but it's not really loud it's you know he's so far away but when he gets up close the Roar of the giant is even worse it's loud and when you get close to your deliverance the Roar of your giant is going to be louder than ever he's going to scream worse amen and as he approached Goliath Goliath didn't get smaller Goliath got bigger that's right when you're out here and you're you're 200 yards away from somebody they look little but when you get up close you see how big they really are and so you see as he approached Goliath he the bigger he became that's the way it's going to be in your trials you'll come up and you'll face your enemy and Goliath his Roar will be louder and he'll look bigger than ever but to David that didn't matter he thought my goodness the be of the giant the greater the target amen I got more to hit amen and you know when he got up close the giant did exactly what David's brothers did you can show it was Satan and they called him he called him just a boy you're just an old nothing you know am I a dog did You' come out and try to whip me with a flea you know he pointed out David's youth called him just a boy pointed out his weakness pointed out his his lack of training and that's what the devil will do he's a bluff he'll come right out and he'll scream at you and he'll tell you how worthless how no good how faithless and he'll remind you of every every situation in your life that you didn't overcome that's amen and and he pointed out his youth he called him just a boy he pointed to his weaknesses like a trainer he pointed out to his small frame and the Giant's voice was loud it was Satan's attempt listen to me now Satan's attempt to drown out the voice of God yeah brother Tim when you when you you when you the pain increased it was Satan's attempt to drown out the voice of God who said you can be healed you see if Satan attempt to drown out the voice of God but you know you've already I'm talking to you now you've already defeated M Giants many times already your faith in the word and I'll tell you it's like with me I've met with Devils I'm not talking about people I'm talking about de demonic manifestations and they're ugly they're grotesque they're they're filthy they're nasty they have a it's unpleasant oh yeah I've seen them get a hold of people do all kinds of things and it's never Pleasant and I would rather never face another one I would rather never see that again but I'm going to tell you you know even with you and your situations even some of you in your health you know you would rather never be sick again but even but you see Philistines are persistent and even after Goliath's death they came again and again and again read the book The the book of the Kings he defeated Goliath they chased them out of the land and they come again and you think God when will this ever happen when your body's changed that's when you'll cease being invaded that's When Trials will be over that's when prophet IES will no longer be needed that's when Divine Healing will not ever be used again you can hang it up when our bodies are changed until then we need it so it seemed like the battles will never end and it's discouraging God I just got over this and here it comes again I Just Whipped this thing and here's is troubling me again knocking on my door screaming at me again and it's true and I'm going to just tell you you will never listen to me now you will never ever be able to make peace with your enemy I mean Israel's over there and they're over there wishing that they would never get another missile strike can we just go to our homes and sleep in the bed without being woke up 2 3 4:00 two or three times a night and run into our safe rooms but if they're going to possess that land they have to realize the enemy is persistent and they're not going to be happy until every Jew is dead but prophecy is against them come on church God will have a Jewish people of RI that in this last day 144,000 and they can't wipe them out not until God said okay it's time for them to change Dimensions now let me just say he's going to invade your Promised Land again and again and we don't ask for these battles and you know somebody came up to a preacher one time and said Lord Lord I I need patience for brother will you pray for me he lays hands on him said God give this woman tribulation she said tribulation I don't want tribulation I want patience he said you know tribulation worketh patience you know he's going to invade your Promised Land again and again we don't ask for this battle but we must defend the sacred ground that God has given us and just because the enemy regroups and comes again doesn't mean it's all in vain right well brother Tim you can't testify of your wife's healing because she died with a with a brain bleed bet me amen I can testify that time Upon Time God came and God delivered that's right yes sir amen amen you see you can be healed of cancer only for cancer to come again God forbid but it can come again anden other sickness can come again that doesn't mean the healing wasn't bonified it wasn't real that means the enemy has come again but when he comes again the same God that was on your side the first time will be on your side this time that's brother Timothy would testify God said I'm in the fire with you it don't mean it's all been in vain no we saw the hand of God we saw God give eight more years I'm point out to Jerry brother Jerry Shaw one of our deacons there walking out of the service one day anointed by the spirit of God him set him by the door as I would walk out and he went to open the door for me and I laid my hands on him and rebuked that sickness in his body and for three years he was had where he didn't have to have supplemental oxygen so well he died brother Tim he died there with lung problems so he did you're going to have to leave here somehow you're not mean to live here forever but along the way we're going to have healing and deliverance amen amen and God will allow us more time here because our time is not on up up on Earth come on church amen so you see you know again you see you look back at brother Ron we can talk about him five years ago five years ago he was given three months to live with four stage cancer he still got four stage cancer today but we have seen God do Miracle time on time on time again I've seen him come and God give him strength I seen him come and God healed the the the cancers in his eyes I've seen God move time Upon Time After Time we're not defeated that's right and if God forbid but if he would call him home which I don't want him to I'd like him to stay here but if God would call him home we will not be defeated amen you say your prayers were in vain they were not in vain they have kept him alive to this day and he's div fight All Odds to the water the doctors will say you should have been dead a long time ago you are a miracle there's no oh you say well it's it's the Fantastic drugs are given him the drugs are killing him and they testify they testify over and again nobody else we have nobody else we have Ron we have nobody else that has been on this and lived like you have they'll walk in there new doctor with a rep make a report look at him walk back out see if they saw the door right come back in oh are you the patient yes well you don't look like you got cut fourth stage cancer I was expecting you in a wheelchair patients Like You on the deathbed who's doing that God's doing that amen God's doing that now listen but the enemy will come and we'll have dis battleing if he don't attack this way he'll attack that way oh well you're out of the will of God no we're in the very will of of God in this world you have shall have tribulation but rejoice and be glad for I have overcome the world Amen many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them of them all amen that's his promise and yet we're we will fight the enemy as long as there's breath in our bodies and then our battles will be over but until then regroup rest up look back into the word go back in your mind where you killed the bear where you killed the lion and don't be afraid to testify before David David before your brothers before King Saul let the world know this God I serve amen he was with me when I killed a bear he was with me when I killed the lion and I'm drawing from these testimonies to declare that my God is able to bring down this Goliath I don't need your Shield I don't need your sword I just need my God we shall overcome we shall overcome for the Gates of Hell will not Prevail because we are the living bride and he's coming looking for Faith that's and somebody's going to have it oh listen brother brandom says an influence oh I ain't gotten near as far as I wanted to go today but he says an influence he he quotes the scripture he could not do many mighty works because of their unbelief so we must keep focused upon God's Eternal plan and what he wants us to accomplish you see the enemy throws up his fronts to distract us from what God wants done and so God help us God help us not to get sidelined by the trials of life for where we are overwhelmed and we don't see what God is doing I going tell you you know we're targets could I tell you this morning little bride you're an endangered species and there's a Target on your back every godly woman every godly man there's a Target on your back and Satan's got all the guns of Hell trained on you every minister of the Gospel Satan's got a Target on your back and we're shot at and sometimes we're shot at at Point Blank when you don't see how did that not take me down sometime ago you remember I had a dream I had a dream that I was I was taking a road I was you had some equipment some heavy equipment and I was using it to straighten out roads taking making heels level and there there is I was doing that that work which is what we're doing every minister of the Gospel is working with the Forerunner we listen listen let me let stop stop for a minute you know it wasn't just all Roberts and Billy Graham who were angels to Sodom they were just representatives of a spirit that was working of God to call the people out of Sodom come on but there was a many little Baptist preacher that got inspired by that same angel of God that anointed Billy Graham and or Roberts and they would and and they would go with their Bible under their arms and they would start little Baptist churches and they would preach and it's the same message come on it wasn't just them somebody help me realize something I mean it was it was it was an anointing and here we had figureheads men who represented that anointing and it would be men like Billy Graham or Roberts or Roberts that was representing the the faith movement and and they took it and with they blinding they had Miracles and signs and whatever so they couldn't see the door the other had easy believism so they couldn't see the door and many of them jumped on the bandwagon and preach the Prosperity Gospel and whatever and they did it to Blind fulfilling the type somebody sign on just a moment I want you to get what I'm saying amen there were many underneath them that were doing the work of those angels of that anointing that's right preaching the same thing blinding the eyes of some and and calling a a lot out that's right well if that's true with them what about the angel that stayed with Abraham Amen brother Brandon was the he was the the figurehead he was he was like or Roberts and Billy Graham were the Sodom he he was the one we can look at and said there it is that's the son of man revealing himself through human flesh but brother Brandon said that was to be done in the bride body so I want to tell you under that Forerunner there is Ministry that is now here preparing the way for his coming making the path smooth pulling down the heels straightening out the curves I know sometimes you don't like me doing it but that's a part of my job to pull down that Hill pull down lift up those neglected truths amen if we have not been putting enough emphasis on the D Dynamics lift up that neglected truth make the path clear get ready for the coming of the Lord oh yeah we're still doing the work of the Forerunner making the path straight smoothing out the rough places preparing a highway for a God so that his coming will be unh hindered preaching these kind of things a bride will know what you know what she will know their God say what she will know their God and will do exploits so you see we're making a highway for our God and there must be a living bride that stays stead fast upon the word but in this dream as as I was straighten it out it made a group angry and they swarmed around me with angry faces I didn't recognize them I didn't see who they were I don't know they were just people and one walked right up to me in point blank shut me Point Blank and I woke up because it was so loud in my ears and I could hear it resounding an echoing as I woke up and I said God I don't know how they didn't kill me I don't know how sometimes you go through things you get shot at you get shot at you get ridiculed you make made fun of you get you get every kind of things you have a meeting and the young people are people I don't care who they are old they jump and they shout and oh it ain't it ain't a jumping and shouting we love that don't tell us what we already know we know that we wern't born yesterday it was it ain't all in jump and Shout you don't shout to get it you shout cuz you got it amen oh it ain't all in Emotion we know that brother Brandon was you speaking of those things to correct people an age of of people who are in a cycle of elevating emotion over the word of God we are a people with the word you tell me what We Don't Preach amen we preach the seven Thunders are revealed we preach the Seven Seals are open we preach that the book is open and every Divine promise we know predestination eternal security serpy there's none of that we don't preach we preach what the prophet preached so he ain't talking about [Applause] us so therefore we can Rejoice over the word because when we eat it come on somebody it's the wine of Revelation and it causes stimulation on the inside of us the difference between us and that is because ours is not with you know it's kind of like opening a bot a bottle of pop and you find it and you're disappointed has no Fizz and a lot of what being served out there has no Fizz I like mine with fizz in it well okay you want to shake it all out and say all that's past but I don't want I don't want flat Coke and I don't want wine that doesn't have power in it stimulating power I don't want a just a drrive word that doesn't act and doesn't work I want to see it with power in it I want to see it come into new skins and bubble over Hallelujah until they're lack in the upper room where they just say Lord I'm just a big funnel fill me up and they get full and those new skins begin to expand and that begins to bubble out and here they come up bubbling out down out of the upper room speaking in Heavenly languages or in languages that only Heaven could give cuz it didn't come from man dancing shouting spilling over the power of God is limited to your faith that's the only limit it has is your faith so Faith must be preached oh can I finish this up just a little more like David's Brothers they scream out let's scream out we you see brother Tim we we're not to expect what the Zeus of Pentecostals are looking for yeah that's right I don't even say that begrudgingly I say yeah I know that they're looking for a time where there' be a great outpouring they'll empty the hospitals we're already told that's a lie it's not going to be that oh that's a false expectation and of course we don't want what Moses and Elijah's Ministry to the Jews we wants what's promised to the bride amen and I'm not even able to get to these bride promises this morning morning to show you why that she's a living bride and to show you the life that is in her but some Will shout out we can't you can't have Revival now we're laying in the presence of the son and rottening yeah you brought it all right if you ripen you would mature and be exactly like the first grain that was on the day of Pentecost so if you lay in the presence of the word you're not supposed to go bad and WTH you're supposed to change from Glory unto Glory all the greenness of the past ages out and the fullness of the Holy Spirit sealed in yes now so someone shout they shout at us you can't have Revival because Nationwide and worldwide revivals are over well you forgot something there is a bride's Revival come on Amen the brides Revival is not over the worldwide revivals and Nationwide revivals will never be again you you were not expecting Divine Healing campaigns and and and big tents and you know heral and man of the hour this and that we're not expecting that it won't be another repeat of that come on somebody amen but but the bride's Revival is not over and we're not dying we're gaining momentum I want to tell you we are not falling with the voice Fallen World we are rising with Christ we are part of the Ascension not a part of the Fall brother Brandon and how can I overcome he says now I chose this that I that I think that it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die hello we've got to keep in Revival constant Revival every day Paul said daily that Christ should live we should never let that Revival die within us he says I think it's birth pain he said oh they say today you can't have an oldfashioned Revival he said oh yes you can you can have one in yourself how can it die she's described as alive and remain Not Dead brother brandham himself preached so that Apostolic times would come he said in perfect Faith he says we're trying to get the church into the place I wonder ministers are you on the same page as the prophet trying to get the church into the place where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us oh that's just baby stuff brother Tim we're Way Beyond that that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it and I'm not denying that we can go through this building this morning and we can say I've seen this and I've seen that and i' here's this and healed this and delivered this this and set free oh wondrous works that God has done he said we see it have we seen it sir but we want to see more of it how many is with the prophet on that we want to see more of it he said we want it to be such a flow that it'll be a help to us and US flow out to others if you're not hunger to see Apostolic time then you got a different appetite than the prophet of God that's all I can say because I tell you what I believe the real bride has got a hunger for the word amen come on somebody a book has been offered to them said take it and eat it consume it all keep it down amen oh yeah it might be a war on the inside of you and get rid of some cold Creeds and dogmas of man and even message Creeds but I'll tell you what get of that eliminate that Amen Let the word of God come in there and yeah it'll produce bitterness in your stomach and make you get rid of a lot of Creeds and man-made ideas and everything else but eat it keep it down don't throw it out come on Amen because you must prophesy again the bride must be the last prophecy yes sir am the voice of the Resurrection the voice of the Archangel give voice to the angel so that why so the dead in Christ can rise CU they're waiting on you that
