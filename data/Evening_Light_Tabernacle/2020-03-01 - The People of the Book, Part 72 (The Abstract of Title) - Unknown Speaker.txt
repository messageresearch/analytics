world Lord is the closing hours of this world's history are coming upon us as their pledges that have been least released of gardens in her and are going forth and people are dying and troubles of ever hand Lord we know that it's going to require the token the Holy Spirit there to keep back the death angel in this age and this time Lord God physical death is the least of our problems it's the spiritual death that is striking the Lions and I pray God that you today will just help us so God as your children to take the lamb that is provided think of his blood and apply it freshly to our hearts not prepared for this great moment that is ahead surrendering our lives to you we pray in Jesus name and we thank you for it Lord amen amen how how good is our Lord amen god bless you good to have each one of you with us today and I'd like you to turn again with me to Revelation chapter five and we'll we'll read a verse of scripture here actually I have seven verses that we will read this morning and then we will do a little bit of a review from last Sunday and then we will go into some new material as we go along but I want to kind of bring your minds and hearts back to this this topic that I have today we're going to be speaking on the abstract of title so if you own if you look here with me in Revelation 5 and verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither look their own and one of the elders said unto me we'd not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a man god bless you you can be seated certainly our hearts have been set to rejoicing this week as we announced that my daughter Esther and their husband Jeff are expecting a baby and we are so thankful to the Lord for answering prayers and I want to say I appreciate your prayers and all of this and your continued prayers as some G moves toward a given birth somewhere the first of November around that time so we want to thank the Lord for His goodness to us amen and oh I sister Nita sent me a little part from the internet showing that the desert around the the Dead Sea is also having a revival and seeds are coming to life that hasn't sprung forth in years and years and it just shows us the barren has given life I believe that a barren church is given life we're gonna give them we're gonna bring for Jesus Christ back to the earth again amen before he comes he's gonna be manifested fully in bride that formed a man and see the Holy Spirit work in great power and great glory so we appreciate you appreciate your prayers and and your continued prayers for brother Ron Spencer he's doing well and God is is performing a miracle and we're we're glad to be a part of that miracle as I keep saying we're walking in a vision and I believe that we have we are here in the very mind and the very purpose of God and we're here for this day in this age in this time for a great purpose that God is ordained as we look into the scripture this morning and I just begin with just a little bit of review and I'll try not be too long in that but I didn't want to just kind of bring the whole audience and the unseen audience as well up to speed as to where we are in this subject and take it forward from here because as you know with my account writing in a chapter of the book of Acts this last Sunday and spending 45 minutes telling about what the Lord was doing we didn't have a lot of time to get into this subject this morning so we want to carry it forward from here and hoped on hopefully the Lord will just inspire us by the Holy Spirit and inspire you and open up your understanding that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened that you can know the hope of your calling this is a wonderful scripture that we're looking at here as we are I believe that this is very revelant to our day in our time 2000 years ago John saw it of course in symbols and he wrote it in the Bible in a symbolic form as the book of Revelation is mostly symbolic because God held its understanding back unto the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound the mystery of God would be finished we look here at this revelation 5 and we also understand that there is also another portion of its opening and that is by revelation it is by revelation that it is given to a prophet and then finally there will be a that will a literal taking of the book because the believers are that book and will be raptured so it's all symbolic and in speaking of what God will do here in this endtime process and it begins with one sitting on the throne and there is a book that is being held by this one on the throne that is sealed with seven seals it is a book of title but none can claim it it is a deed to an inheritance but there is no man that is worthy who can take it and so we find then that the one up on the throne becomes the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world and becomes a man and as being a man he will be the worthy one that will step forth to claim the book he's the only one that is worthy because every other man was born in sin and under the curse of sin and so he could not redeem his self so therefore no man was worthy to be able to redeem or claim what Adam lost at the beginning because this is what this book contains is the title to everything that Adam lost in the fall Adam once controlled the earth he was the dresser of the garden he did it all by the word as a son of God now he said to this mountain be thou removed he spoke to the trees and moved them by the word he controlled the winds there was no storms because he controlled the atmospheres we find that Jesus did the same when he came to second Adam and so that kind of gives us a portrayal of what the first Adam was before the fall of course when men fell Adam a forfeit did the title deed to the earth but Satan couldn't take it and so because he couldn't take it then the title deed went back in the hand of Almighty God and and the title is the whole evidence that gives rise to legal right of possession our control and so when man lost and forfeited the title deed the earth he forfeited even the right are the title to his own body which was made of Earth and Satan took the body the spirit and the soul of man and corrupted him and man was robbed of his faith and and began to live in a cycle of fear and man's body was made to be in the image of God and it fell from an immortal state to be in mortal and subject to thorns and thistles just as the earth is and of course we're subject to disease and sickness his body never needed medicine never was sick never had a headache never a stomach problem had become the target then of demons and the evil spirits could now come and take residence in the body that wants only house a son of God and and it was now - the body was now to decay and turn gray and old and feeble until it was brought back to the dust and God came down looking for his son and found him in this sad and deplorable condition he was beaten and deformed and robbed of his inheritance but of course Satan couldn't put a claim on the predestinated seed that was in him a man because that was God and those names were in his book so the book of title deed was now in question as to who owned it and Satan had a claim on it because Adam subjected his self to him and became subservient and God had a claim because he was the original owner and had the first claim and so it goes back in the hands of the of the original owner which is God which will wait until a man who is worthy who can come and take it and claim it back for man and and of course um God was determined is he as he looked upon his fallen creation and he said Adam you have been robbed that you have been cast into Satan's prison house you were born to be free but now you're in bondage to Satan but I'm not gonna let it be that way forever but I'll provide an attorney someone someone who can mediate for you before the court and and can get the book of title back but until then the book is going to be held in escrow which is um in the hands of a third party which is God because the escrow is some money and property a deed or bond put in the custody of a third party for delivery to a grantee only after the fulfillment of the conditions specified so in this case the title deed was then given back into the hands of the king on the throne for delivery to a man who was worthy a man who was without sin so this disputed title we find remains in the hands of God until a worthy man takes the book and there isn't a man that is worthy so as we said God steps out of eternity to become a man in order to take the book but the book is sealed and it cannot be open until the seals are removed and every claim against it must be taken off and the removing of it seals are the given of an abstract now an abstract of course is a brief history of the transfers of of a piece of land including all claims that could be made against it so someone must come and pay all the debt that man owes in order for men to take it so cuz there are those claims that are against it and so once the book is open it will give an abstract of title it will show that the claims are now taken off now we wanna pose the question how did the seals get on there to close the book if you notice brother branham tells us in souls in prison now he said it it wasn't for the Old Testament it was this was only for the new because we know that Jesus paid the death of all the Old Testament believers and they were released from sins bondage and the body of corruption to to move from um into it from from the the condition that were as a men who were of the dust who had died and that were changed and transformed that they were raptured if you're if you want to just think about it for a moment this is not going to be the first time that a body changes taking place because the saints of God rose from the dead amen of the Old Testament because Jesus completely and totally claimed the book and he paid the death of all the Old Testament believers and they were released from the holding place of Abraham's bosom to come into the presence of God and so they were raptured what a wonderful thing that is that Jesus his blood has are paid and redeemed all of the Old Testament believers he didn't evil one of them in that holding place there was no sin that was underneath the Old Covenant that was not that was not paid for every one of them had sinned and fallen short of the glory of God every one of them had transgressed the law all the way from from Adam all the way down to the teeth on the cross every one of them was transgressors but Jesus paid it off a man and to prove that the price of his blood was sufficient it lifted him all of those from paradise and change them in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and there they appeared unto thee unto the believers that was there according to the book of Matthew and and so we know that Jesus paid the debt and completely end-to-end totally and and when the book was on when the book of title was was to be given to there we know that Jesus sat down to become the mediator to atone for every name that was in the book because it was still more to be manifested on the earth and so he would dare be the mercy seat he would be the approach to God he would be our way of salvation for every man down through every age and Jesus would remain on that seat of mercy and he does until the last predestinated seat of God is dipped in blood and retained a man and then the rapture takes place and all the dead in Christ from the past 2,000 years will rise from the grave and in a pen again appear to one another and to the living and we will be all changed and be caught up to meet the Lord in the air aren't you dived with that promise this morning what a beautiful redemption story but now when when Paul read the will and the testament remember that every every promise of God was open to us there was nothing that was clouded on the deed there was nothing clouded on the understanding on the revelation every bit of it was open and plain and revealed Paul would read from the way he would actually read from this open book to us he would read it you have been chosen before the foundation of the world you are accepted in the beloved you are predestinated to adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself and those are the disciples they were as I said they were reading from an open book there was water water baptism it wasn't shrouded as to whether you immerse or whether you dip or whether you just going to pour little water on their head or sprinkle something and some little holy water from a rose or something you know it wasn't it wasn't no question about it there was no question over the formula of baptism everyone was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hey man it wasn't a mystery it wasn't hidden it wasn't shrouded it wasn't sealed the understanding was clear and precise and it was open all the early believers believed in one God not a trinity of gods a man they there was nobody confused on whether it was one Lord or two Lords they all knew there was one Lord a man they could trace the Serpent's trail all the way from Eden right to their present time and as Paul revealed as a serpent beguiled Eve I fear that you will be beguiled and lose your virginity as he did and of course we can now see that his fears were not unfounded as the Bible exposes the organized Church as the horror of sitting upon many waters with multitudes of people ruling over them and so in the first stage the Anti Christ though he would begin to ride and he would come as an impersonating spirit and he was posing as Christ on a white horse but it was in Christ at all it was a spirit of nickel Anthon ism a man and he would go to conquer the church and subdue it and to close the promises of God up through the believers and seal it away were that understanding wouldn't be there and then the Antichrist would seal more truths from the church by changed him from the white horse to the red horse now I'm quoting all of this referring to the seven seals of the book of Revelation and the Antichrist would seal more truths away from the church changing from the white to the red with and with the sword he would go out and use them with his power the support of governments and kings and then he would go and stamp out the truth by putting them putting people to the sword and according just to UM just such as some of the smallest estimates out there there were 68 million that were slaughtered during that time and we're that any light of truth and any ray of truth on that was opposing the Roman Church would would actually be put to death and so again that it would be it would be using that to sequester and to seal the truth away somebody with me now and then the Antichrist would seal more truths away as he morphed over and he changes from what from red now to black and then the black horse rider would represent the dark ages and where that the priesthood of Roma would even sell offering for money a measure of wheat for you know their measure of barley representing the the staff of life the bread of life and then doing so the church would sell indulgences which means permission to sins if you notice this great thing what they call here of Mardi Gras that's going on around you and that just means a grand party and what it is is before the fast begins sub it commemorating I think it's son I forget to ask Wednesday or whatever and they're they're getting ready now for Easter to come in so you know all the Catholics how throw a big party where you going to be and you just celebrate and you you you know if you're giving up chocolates for Lent well then you've been jumped Auklet you're giving up alcohol for a few days you binge on alcohol and you do this binge before you go on a fast sounds real spiritual doesn't it but you see they made that something very spiritual and so they they begin their party you know because again they're praying they offer prayers on foreign to pray your loved ones out of purgatory and then and of course all of these things was given given freely by Christ but now the church under that nicholae in his spirit is charging charging money for what Jesus paid for and gave us freely and man and so again finally the the last horse rider rides and he that rides on him is death and he'll follows as a church plunges into the Great Tribulation now sealed also what's the truth of the salvation of the Jews as shown in the fifth seal and then finally was to be a tribulation were under the sixth seal God's judgment would be poured out leaving only the seventh seal represented by silence which holds the mystery of the unfolding of all the endtime events and it unleashes something here because it breaks the silence what has been silenced and held back and the revelation of truths that have been held back to the end time gets released under the Seventh Seal which is which begins the very process of the coming of the Lord now we often think of the rapture as a moment in a twinkling of en't that's the change of the body but the rapture is a process it begins with the shout of voice and in a Trump and these are three things the Lord does as he descends so he does these things by bringing a shout which is a message and that message is to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and then it is a voice of the Archangel we which culminates in the resurrection of the dead in Christ and then the change of the body and then we're caught up to meet the Lord in the air all of that is part of the great rapture event that we're talking about so when we speak about rapture there's there's phases to the things that God is doing and I believe that we are in a very rapturing moment it's an hour of restoration where God is turning the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers where he is bringing the barren Church to life a man that she will she's been who's he been wanting to bring forth Christ back to the earth for 2,000 years remember today we are really under expectation because we see the signs that are that are taking place and the birth planes that are coming around and even the earth is going into travail of birth as it's getting ready to birth a world and by the burning of it and go into a millennial reign where Christ will rule well rule and reign with his bride for a thousand years but as we were saying the seventh seal it breaks the silence it unleashes a chain of events until the bride is raptured and the tribulation sets in where the false churches judge and the deceived church is given white that's the church that goes to the tribulation and then the the 144,000 although Israel let me correct that they're not given white road but they wash the rugs in the blood of the Lamb and then the hundred and forty-four thousand of Israel is sealed in and finally the Millennium begins bringing the fullness of the title possession back to man again as the man Christ Jesus and his bride will rule for a thousand years so this is why the book was sealed although it was open to the early church and they wrote a book of Acts it became closed off and his truth and his mysteries and power was lost but I want you to to understand and let it get cemented in your heart this morning now what we are preaching is not another gospel it is the gospel of Paul being restored back to the church you say brother tm1 the Bible became a new book to brother Branham when the seals was opened that is because he now understood things as it was originally taught it was not a new understanding it was not a new Bible it was not a new doctrine it was not a new truth other than the symbols in the book of Revelation were now made plain and revealed as to who the white the red the black the pale horse riders were and so on but now you remember you remember Paul said the world will be judged according to my gospel and he said if an angel come from heaven and he said if I or even an angel he said I can't change the word of it and he said an angel EB comes from heaven and he goes to change a word of this gospel let him be accursed and man it is not something that can be added to or taken away from it is something that must be believed as it was revealed and opened unto the Apostle Paul when he separated love and grace a man so the world will be judged by my gospel and when brother Branham went beyond the curtain and he too was told he would be judged all he wanted to know all he want to know is Paul is Paul will he be judged the same way because I preached the same thing he did a man and I know if Paul is accepted then I will be accepted hallelujah Amen so you see what we have today is is is not a new gospel but it is a restoration of the same gospel among that Jesus said this gospel of the kingdom must be preached in all the world and then saw the income and today I am so glad to be able to say that we're living in the time the day the hour were the gospel that according to st. Paul is preached again and the Holy Spirit is going behind it confirming the word with signs following hey man now so before the book of title could be opened by the lamb its seals would have to be removed so there had to be a title search so the lamb works on earth through his agent that Elijah the prophet to make a brief history of the transfers of the property including all the claims that were made against it so we can see it then it was taken and it was handed down from from Paul to Iranians to Martin to Columba to Luther - Wesley and then finally to the last age and the last messenger brother Brandon so you see the again he starts with Ephesus and does a title search all the way down Laodicea I'm looking for the claims that Satan had against the church a man the first organization Rome the Trinity of gods of three gods folks baptism of Father Son and Holy Ghost trailing the serpent right down a man and of course we know the call was for a worthy man and we know brother Branham couldn't open the book he wasn't worthy it would be the armor that would open the book because only Christ is the one that is worthy and so the call goes forth o worthy man and there there is much work and much effort of the devil today to try to render ineffective this worthy man and just trivialize him now actually the Church of Rome has been doing this for years they trivialize Jesus by making you pray to Mary and they absolutely did away it's somebody with me that did away with the father himself a man and made him justice angry something that was in the back that we're trying to appease but but I want you to understand again this is what the church has done through the ages has tried to trivialize and to and to and to to take away the glory of Jesus Christ and render ineffective this worthy one now I want to talk about that for a little while because brother Branham said in Daviess in church age he said see what was getting back there that false vine was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right he had taught that the church had to be governed it taught of control over the people but instead of doing it God's Way they simply took a Ardi invested all the spirits of power in their own hands and came out with the holy priesthood standing between God and the people they went right back to the old Arabic system they became analyze now listen they became analyzed for they dispose of his me notorious ship and impose their own and God hated that and the Ephesians hated that and any true believer will hate it too how many true believers we got so we will hate anything that man will do to try to dispose them mediatorial ship of Jesus Christ and then we must recognize him as the only intercessor between God and man and man our only approach to God remember it is the spirit of Rome it is the Roman spirit that is supposed to mediate or a ship and impose their own and the same is true you can watch that same nickel and in spirits even in other movements even those with message titles on them claiming to believe the message because in doing so they try to make it that Christ is no longer interceding and they only interceded for the ignorance of the ages and that once the word is coming he no longer intercedes well he did intercede fragrance but in fact there's still a lot of need for interceding for ignorance because it's pretty ignorant to believe that that's all that he interceded for because he didn't just intercede fragrance he interceded for sin he interceded for your healing not just the in their ignorance of the ages and as long as their sickness we need an intercessor as long as their sin we need an intercessor and as long as there's revelation need to come to you individually you need an intercessor because you're not going to get a revelation except by the Holy Spirit that's the only way revelation can come heals by the Holy Spirit but the problem today is we have men are not led by the Holy Ghost but it is carnal minded man who are pretending to be experts in the message the self imported man are masquerading as preachers and they're really men without the Holy Ghost and they have no true calling a man but are inspired of Satan oh yeah I'm talking very strong inspired of Satan to say that Christ has left the mercy seat and that there's and let me just define it that is nothing more than a spirit of the Antichrist a nickel alien spirit that is trying to take away the role of the worthy one now let me qualify this because you might find an isolated quote that seems to say this but when you examine the subject of all that the Prophet said you can only come to the conclusion that Christ is still the seat of mercy and the only intercessor between God and man and that we need him there to intercede on the behalf of us as sinners not only from the loss but those of us today because of our doubting because of our disbelieving and Men because of us floundering on the promise that he makes up for our mistakes I'm so glad to say that there is an intercessor a man be close as long as you are in these mortal bodies you're going to need somebody there to help you with your carnality a man you're gonna need Jesus you're gonna be able to have to call on him you're gonna have to have them intercede for you a man now again let's get the facts right to be the mercy seat is to be the intercessor and that means you are the sacrifice and there is no preacher there is no group of believers whether we call them bride of church or whatever that can be the in assessor aren't the mercy seat now let's just go to Romans chapter 3 and verse 25 I want to go through some of this and I've already taken longer on my review than what I wanted to so we're kicking over time be prepared Romans 3:25 whom God has set forth to be a propitiation now that word perpetuation is also translated in many versions mercy seat so God set forth Christ to be the mercy seat the place of mercy are the blood of mercy through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God now we know in my definition we first find out about the mercy seat by Moses constructing one in the wilderness the mercy seat in the wilderness Tabernacle was the lid to the Ark of the Covenant were the tablets of stone were put in and it was carried out throughout the wilderness for years and finally have found a home in the temple in Jerusalem blood of Mercy was sprinkled on the mercy seat or the place of satisfaction our appeasement this was done yearly on the Day of Atonement which covered the sins of the people until Jesus sprinkled his blood on the mercy seat in heaven so what I want to get you this talk to you that that again that the this mercy seat is the place of satisfaction is where the penalty of sin is met and the way that is met on this mercy seat now remember without blood it's a judgement seat but when the blood of mercy is put on it it becomes a seat of mercy and it would make an approach to God for the children of Israel now again I just want to bring it down now though then if a bride because people are saying today well you know there's no mercy as he Christ nothing on the seat of mercy anymore he he left that seat of mercy because the seals were revealed but let me just make something very plain to you and bring it down in the morph it down so you see what it is the bride now is the seat of mercy so if the bride a group who calls themself names of sub bride is now the mercy seat or the place of appeasement then where is her blood shed for without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin so then what then has here to offer as an atonement knowledge will never make an atonement come on fruits will never make an atonement it's only Cain's children that tried to make an altar without blood Amanda the true seed of God recognizes it takes the blood of someone innocent to pay the price for my guilt in order that I can have an approach to God this is why Abel brought a lamb he realized something had to die in my place because the day we eat there of that day we die and death now has been ruled upon us all and the only way that I will not die is far is for me to offer a lamb in my place and that has to be my approach to God because without the shedding of blood there will be no approach to God now turn with me to verse similarly to invite for there is one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus so I want you to understand it never was the bride that was a mediator never was the church Church of Rome that was the mediator it isn't your little private group or some preacher that is the mediator come on amen there is but one God these are they're trying to be God that's trying to remove his deity mm but there is one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus no room for a group of people there to be the mediator there's no no no no room for three billion Catholics to be the mediator there and of course you know it's not the three billion Catholics that are the mediator it's their priesthood that's the media and neither is it the bride that they're saying is the real mediator is this preacher in the pulpit that becomes a mediator because he wants to be able to dispense mercy are withholding mercy and this mercy is dispensed and withheld on whether or not you line up with my beliefs now let's get it clear brother branham said the only thing that will back off God his blood and there's only one blood he'll back from and that's his own son and when he sees that's his sons sons blood he'll back off in other word the wrath of God will not come upon you if you have the blood of the Lamb again speaking of the center brother Branham says and in 1963 in April he says he's looking away now to to Calvary where the only only the blood of Jesus Christ can cleanse him only one blood can make that leap across the chasm and that's the blood of Jesus it flows within the chasm and puts him next to God so he's saying there's only one boy a man that that will bridge the gap between you and God the chasm between you and God that brings you back into fellowship but got only one blood now to deny that blood you are you are dead that you are eternally separated from God because there is no hope of salvation without the atonement of Jesus the blood of Jesus Hebrews 9:15 for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament so notice he is the mediator of this book of Testament a man that by means of his death for the redemption of the transgressions that were first under the first Testament that they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance the me reading again for this cause he is a mediator of a New Testament that by means of his death notice his mediatorial ship is by means of him dying in your place and then this is why you can approach to God boldly because Jesus paid your price in full so you can come to the throne of grace and find help in your time of need notice it is a throne of grace our throne of mercy it is not a throne of judgment hallelujah but without the blood is be a throne of judgment and without the blood you can find Grace in the time of needs there's no favor without the blood what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus so some group calls himself the bride as a man say they are the mercy seat then she is the mediator or she is the mediator so what heaven it or what Testament is he the mediator of so what is this new a recently developed covenant if the bride is now the mediator because she would have to have a new covenant so now we don't have an Old Covenant in a new covenant but now we got the new New Covenant the third covenant the only thing that makes the mercy seat not a judgement seat is that there's blood on it atoning so where then where then does the bride have blood to offer the blood of a thousand saints can save us the blood of a million bride members cannot save us in fact the blood of every human that's ever been born except for Jesus Christ will not save you there's only one blonde by which we're saved we are saved by the blood of Christ we have forgiveness of sin through his blood now so again so who is worthy it would take somebody worthy well so what preacher is worthy and what group that names a sub bride is so worthy they can take us away our sins and I'm going to come tell you right now I don't even want their righteousness [Music] amen but this one this one he becomes our sin and he gives us his righteousness the others they the day they may claim to take away our sin but they but again they cannot give us righteousness because only righteousness comes from Jesus himself and man Jesus alone is our approach to God remember the book is in the hands of one no man is worthy until the one on the throne becomes the land it is wrote symbolically as a lamb so we're not confused with two persons of the Godhead but rather this is symbolic of his work that he is doing of redeeming now so again Jesus alone is approach to God go with me to John 14 and 6 jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me so therefore nobody else sees he approach to God only through Jesus somebody with me now Amen Muslims cannot to bring you approach to God Buddha cannot bring in approach to God and may even the Jews cannot bring you an approach to God with all their forms and religious rituals and everything else they cannot bring you to God there is only one that can bring you to God and that Jesus Christ and he is the way he is the truth he is the life and no man comes to the Father except by him he is the only approach to God he would leave the throne to make an approach back to him when we could not go into heaven because of our sins then heaven came down to us hallelujah now if you go with me to Ephesians 1 so I don't have this verse here but in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace a man so Jesus makes it clear he's the only approach to God so how can a group of sainted believers sinners like all mankind be the life that men comes to God by how can the bride be the way that sinners come by how can she be the truth that sinners are saved by now I'm asking this how can she do it alone without Jesus it is only through Christ we can offer salvation it is only through Christ we can remit sins it is only through Christ we can heal diseases there's not any power in any of us on our own to heal diseases amen but there is redemption in his blood there is healing in his blood there is power in his life by man so again I'll conceive me the truth that sinners are saved by it's not her truth is his truth so how can we do away with his meat authorial ship and man become the mediator we can't do it there's only one mediator between God and man that's the man Christ Jesus a man the bride is the truth by being given the truth she is life by being give life a man she is the way by being given the way but without Jesus she is not the way she is be rest she is but a corpse she is just a useless thing a prostitute like the rest of the systems on Nicolaitans spirit come on remember with Jesus with Christ sin Hermits a man then there is redemption to his blood there is forgiveness of sin then his mercy and there is grace hallelujah a man and back to the matter is she only points to the way she's not the way Christ is a man and so again she receives his way his truth and his life it's all of Jesus hey man now I'd like you to turn with me to Romans 8 and 38 for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord hi ma'am now how wonderful is this nothing can separate you from him but I'll tell you you just leave some of these preachers assembly or their church group that they called the bride and you find out how quick right quickly you're damned and going to hell told you can never make the rapture without belonging to them because you know just a little disagreement will separate you from their love you find you fall out of favor real quick with man you can find out you can even find fall out of favor with me but you can't fall out of favor with him come on a man no man can put you out and no man can save you and put you in so no man can make your bride and no man can put you out of the bride salvation is totally of the Lord it's not a man mile all so you don't have to walk on eggshells wondering what day you're gonna make brother Jim mad and he's gonna put you out the bride cuz he don't have the power to put you out of the bride and no other preachers got the power to put you out of the bride only God called you and he elected you and he chose you and before the foundation of the world and what's more he can't change his mind about him hallelujah man you will never fall out of his favor you'll never fall out of his grace you'll never do anything to separate you from his love his love for each bring it down his graceful reach downward man can offering his mercy will endure forever because he's a God that is rich in Nursing I remember seeing you run out of mercy and man run out of mercy and court system run out of mercy but God never runs out of mercy his mercy endures forever he'll never run out of mercy for one of his own God's children play some worship brother Branham says they say today I heard people tell me a man called me not long ago in Beaumont Texas he said mr. Branum if your name is not on our church book you can't go to heaven would you ever think of that don't you believe such a thing as that they think you have to belong to that certain church so you cannot go to heaven that's wrong to believe that is Antichrist and I'll say this if you believe such a spirit you're lost that's a good sign you're lost because it's taking away from what God did you see it's lost people who want to remove Christ mediatorial ship and put it on a group any man God never put his name in any Church I'm finishing the quote he put it in his son Christ Jesus when he and his son became one that's the genuine place of worship no other foundations was laid no other rock now I wonder if some self-described group who calls herself the bride how easy it would be to separate yourself from her love the moment you disagree with a little Pope of that group you'll be separating ostracized and put out of the group but look at Romans 8 and verse 27 the Bible said him he searches he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God so he he makes intercession the spirit makes intercession now so who who else can search the heart but Jesus and who else is the Holy Spirit but the spirit of Jesus a man and who can know the mind of the Spirit but Jesus a man so if a group is Ammar is the mercy seat then she makes intercession according to the whim of some preacher this is as cultish as cultish can be anything that would take away from Jesus Christ but there's something a deed his spirit in this message that wants to remove the deity from Jesus and put the deity on a man or some other little group Hebrews 8 and 6 but now has he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises so again if some group is the mercy see what better covenant is she extended mercy by in fact I just want to ask you what better covenant do we need what can somebody offer me that Jesus hadn't already offered what greater salvation can somebody offer me than Jesus offered what greater healing Kinjo can be offered that what Jesus offers amen so what better promises could she give than Jesus gave the Bible said in 2nd Corinthians 5:21 for he had made him to be sin for us who knew no sin he was sinless one but he became sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so in order to be the mercy seat Jesus had to be made sin for us churches are groups who claim the power to remit sin they in order to do that they will have to die and become sin and die and pay the penalty of sin and I'm just gonna say I don't need him because mine has already been paid a man for the bride to be the mercy seat then she has to be the perpetuation she has to be able to turn away God's anger to be the mercy seat she has to be the giver of blood because that's what Christ had to do to be the mercy seat was give his own blood the blood is a set of all the every member of every bride member that way if it could all be said of the whole world could not save not one sinner there's no power in her blood there is only power in his blood there is no salvation and her name hallelujah I mean you can belong to evening like tabernacle as long as you're have breath in your life but it won't save you you can never miss a service but it won't save you there is no salvation in our name or the name of a local assembly there's only salvation in his name it is him you have to belong to you can belong to this church and still split hell wide open [Applause] Amen but if you belong to Jesus the rapture is yours the Millenium is yours the new heaven and earth is yours everything God has is yours because you are a receiving heir from him hallelujah his name is the only name given among heaven whereby men must be saved brother Branham told us in God's chosen place of worship he never said anything about a sheep he said him in fact he talks about that he said notice it was not a sea lamb it was a he lamb he said it's never her it is him a man him is the meeting place the lamb not the church not her name but his name he didn't put her name anywhere he put his name in him that's why all we do must do in word or deed we must do it all in the name of Jesus Christ if we pray we got to pray in the name of Jesus if we petition we got a petition or ask in the name of Jesus name if we walk we walk in Jesus name if we talk we talk in Jesus name if we baptized we got to baptize in the name of Jesus Christ for all that we do in word or deed do it in the name of Jesus Christ again same message God's chosen place of worship he says death cannot strike where this provided place of God is and that's in the lamb note is this only in the lamb is where death can strike so while they eat lamb the Lord then you ain't got a heart to safety there's only one place where their safety and that's in the lion a man notice he was forbidden Asst he he wasn't he was forbidden Asst - he was forbidden to strike on Israel or the Hebrew priest or any of their denomination all must be in God's chosen provided place or death struck church wherever you are whatever you belong to makes me no difference but there's one thing you must know you've got to be in Christ or your debt you can't live outside of him your church might be alright as a building your fellowship might be alright as man but when you deny the body the blood or the word of Jesus Christ you're dead the miniature do it it's God's chosen place of worship that's where his name is exactly that's where he chose him but his name not in the church but in the son Jesus Christ hey man now of course you know men's mind is a begin to work in contemplating they begin to pose questions like well then but we're justified we never did it in the first place so we don't need an attorney we've been declared righteous and justified we no longer need an intercessor we don't need even a mercy seat in this age we've been declared righteous that we are the pure sinless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ we never did it in the first place the case is dismissed for the tenth so we don't need an attorney you know you know why don't you know what the Prophet said brother Branham said this we are perfectly the case is dismissed there's no more sin to the believer Oh God have mercy if people can't see that there's no more case he that was heareth my word believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come into the judgment but it's passed from death to the life there's the case case is dismissed no more case to it a man and I say amen to that and and of course you know the case is dismissed but here's half hey man you said what we don't need a mediator because my case has been dismissed we don't need a minute says we don't need an attorney no more we're beyond all of that we don't need that well listen here's how on the wings of us no I dove happen to be present when brother Brandon preached this one he said did you know a real Christian doesn't have any sin at all imputed to him David said blessed is the man who God will not impute sin to when you're washing the blood of the Lamb not by make-believe but really the blood of the Lamb God does not impute to you anything that's done because you're under the blood and he doesn't see it there is a blood sacrifice the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life that's all he can look at because you're redeemed from everything else that was done and you're washed in the blood of the Lamb so the case is dismissed because I'm under the blood man the case is dismissed because I got a mercy seat the case is dismissed because Jesus is my sacrifice hey man and what was against me is dismissed because he paid the price and the only way God can see me now is the way he had me in his mind before sin ever entered the picture hallelujah because Jesus hallelujah I turn it did away with the evidence that was against us hallelujah he didn't do it by crookedness he did it as a legal attorney and he did it by paying the price himself I say what an attorney I say what am i turning a man we don't we we were criminals if you're a criminal in our court you're not gonna get some attorney to take your place hey man you're not gonna get some attorney to pay your fine you'll find millions of dollars he's not gonna pay it you'll pay it or you go to jail hey man and we would have went to hell because it wasn't none of these self-made wannabe attorneys in religion that could pay I sit down there was no church group could be a mercy seat and paid the debt against us but I Got News for You Jesus did hallelujah and what he did is he not only did that but he had sponge so the evidence that was against you cuz he hallelujah he didn't just coverton but he acknowledged it by the blood and said you never did it in the first place well I see you now is what you were if my mind before the world began that's how I see you now and that's how I always see you when you pray that's the way that let us see you you might have made a mistake you matter you might have had some doubt or unbelief you might iron some nonsense you know that you shouldn't have said that no maybe I'm not healed maybe I didn't do right maybe I maybe I'm not just you you could've met you can set any kind of nonsense five minutes ago and dip it in the blood and he doesn't see what you did five minutes ago hallelujah everybody sees you the way you were in his mind before the foundation of the world his brother dilates in it knowledge the guilt it knowledge the same there's no saving me Amen honey believers this morning and say there's no shame on me he took my safe he took my penalty he took my sin and there's no save on me he became me brother Brandon said therefore there's no call in you there's no unclean habit in you because that the blood of the Lamb that Dez did this and God cannot impute sin to you after you've got a sin offer and laying there waiting for you what you say well that gives me plenty of room brother branham I can do what I want to you said I always do I mean I'm talking to a group of people to smoke all I won't drink all the won't lust all they won't what's pornography all they won't come on why because the work too has been changed the desire of sin has gone hallelujah and I got plenty room to do what I want to what I want to do I want to serve Him I want to love him I want to keep his Commandments I want to be true to him hey man I want to be in fellowship with him that's what I want to do halleluyah gives me plenty around a mount but when a man can really see what Jesus done for him and turn around and do something contrary to him it shows he never received Christ you ever receive him once a man sin is finished you don't want anymore hey man so this is why God can only see us like we were before the foundation of the world is because he is our mercy seat he is our comforter he is our advocate he is our propitiation he is our sacrifice and his sin clintus and his blood cleanses us from all sin Alleluia so that means the Covenant is yours the land is yours the book is yours hey man the Covenant is the deed do it in the enemy that possesses is claims here must be struck off a mound so here we are as believers here's what we stand we have a mercy seat and Christ is that seat of mercy he is that approach to God you cannot approach him through a church you must approach it to the man Christ Jesus hallelujah a man and then when you find that worthy man and he takes your place as a man remember it was man that lost it and he was not taking the book as God it did not look for a God that was worthy I mean when the sound went out it didn't say is it is there a God worthy is that is there man worthy there has to be a man worthy now once that man takes it God becomes a man to take for us what we couldn't Hey to pay the debt what we couldn't pay somebody with me now a man now then as God does this and takes on the sins of man then he takes the book in his hands and he loses the seals I want you to know he doesn't give you the book which still claims against it he doesn't give you the buff and they're still seals that are unopened that you're not worthy to open because it will take a lama to take the book and to open the seals not just take the belt but to open the seals nobody nobody else could do it but the worthy man now I want to get into you because it is God as a man taking man's place and winning back the title that was lost for man not so he can go back to sit back on the throne with it no he didn't want it for herself he had it is gone look in the Bible I mean there was one sitting on the drowning as God he has the book but it's a man that needs the book but man is sand and gain take the book so God becomes a man and takes the book and then God opens a man this man as God as man tastes the book and opens the seals and as he does oh brother he doesn't leave it in the heavens he rips it off and he hands it down to the seventh angel on earth I meant to reveal the mystery to the entire church so that you would know your debt has been paid and the sin-debt of the ages have been paid and the glass that have been there the death you couldn't go in director with the false baptism you couldn't take come on I'm talking about alive and remain at the coming of the Lord a Boreas church without spot or wrinkle you couldn't go and take a rapture and be the alive and remain would send that on you loser couldn't take it Wesley couldn't do it and they couldn't have a resurrection in a rapture in their age but hallelujah in this day in this time o God has made it possible to take the seals off the book and ever claim that's been against the church you had baptism wrong you've had you had the Godhead wrong you had the original sin wrong you had predestination wrong you had all the marriage and divorce you had it all wrong hallelujah but I'm not gonna leave you in that condition with depth on the church you can't go in the rapture with the debt I've got to pay the price of redemption and I've got to take the blood and apply it there and get rid of the sin debt the false doctrines and has kept the book closed to the believer because when I handed to them it's going to be an open book hallelujah now let's read revelation 10 8 and here we are here's the book that John couldn't even look on that he wasn't worthy to take now John represents in the symbols here he represents the church so now he hears a voice from heaven notice if we would go back to Revelation 10 one you would see my angel come down and his description verse 2 and they had in his hand a little book what open so the book now that was close is now open and an anointing is coming down now this is not the physical return this is not a 900 foot tall Jesus putting his foot on the land and on the sea this is this here is represented as an angel of the Covenant where God becomes his own his own messenger or angel of the cabinet and here he comes down now and he's got a book and it's all back Alleluia he puts his feet on land and on the sea and all the powers there of the cub what's in the sea multitudes nations kindred tongues and people that's what sea means in the Bible though many waters and then upon the land were that there was not many people right here in America it puts there his foot on the land and on the sea a man his feet are as pillars of fire amen Holy Ghost filled individuals his body notice it only shows his head when and when it's displayed in the in disguise and and the sign comes it's only his head there's no body where's his body it's on the earth and you are his feet right here overcoming Satan right here in his this evil age put your feet come on Joshua and I never wear that the soles of your feet tread that I have given to you footsteps mean possession I give you possession over ever spirit whether it comes out of the land or on the sea ever spirit upon the earth I give you possession and authority and power over it a man in a kennel act it cannot break loose and hell cannot break loose until those feet is the earth and a brad goes NACHA then all hell breaks loose on the earth but as long as you are here hell cannot break loose the tribulation cannot come the plans cannot all come we may be seeing pre-tribulation plagues but them true plans of the tribulation cannot come until a bride is raptured and when she's raptured then Satan comes down and he becomes a king and he possesses the nation's but now notice he has in his hand a little book and it's open go back to verse 8 and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and he said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which tended upon the sea and the earth notice how perfect this is now you go take the book you a man no man was worthy John said I wasn't worthy to even look on it much less to loose the seals or to take it but now after it's been done through the mediator you say mediatorial ship is over with well then who is this mediator coming down the women open book and mediating between God and man and bringing it down to man again it is a mediator a man and he comes down now the mighty angel as a messenger of his own covenant he comes and he reveals herself to the seventh angel on earth revelation 10 7 that's where he reveals herself in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he reveals himself so the mystery of God would be finished but then in verse eight I want you to understand that comes a transfer of the title from from Christ to man again now let me tell you what it's a title for it is a title to your new body now really you're not really that concerned about going out here and moving this tree and all of that amen amen what I want to see is this body change that's really where I want the earth to move I mean this is where I want the trees to move around this is a garden I want dressed hallelujah I thought about it the other day all of us old gray-headed man and women and whatever even some of you younger squirts hallelujah in the moment of that body cheese can you imagine we're going to be like a bunch of kids in a new clothes hallelujah I'm going to be strutting a new body hallelujah I'm a beast retina an ageless body I'm gonna be showing off and kicking and running and jumping let's see what I can do we're gonna be a backup bunch of kids stop dress and fine clothes they ain't no finer clothes in the new body we're gonna be Road they're back around in the theophany changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye God is giving you back that Idol who ever promised her is tennis resurrection power it's rapture hour it's the time to deliver all nature where the sons of God rise [Applause] hallelujah a man come on musicians we might as well bring it down what J that will be what an hour the moment you may never seen joy what we're fixin to see hey man you think we're
