B's wife who's a pastor there in Kentucky uh several of families from their church have been coming to our meetings uh brother Tommy Richmond i' brought up on the stage here at our meetings uh goes to their church but she's been diagnosed with Advanced stages of breast cancer is showing to have spread in many parts of her body so she want to remember her tonight how many have a need she want to make known to the Lord and father Lord we just come to you today Lord and invite you here amongst us Lord we just ask father you have preeminence in this place and in this meeting Lord tonight that'll be orchestrated by you and we ask father for this need Lord this pastor's wife this grandmother this um mother of children Lord that's been diagnosed with this disease Lord we're just looking for you to be the healer Lord as you promised you would be in your word we just ask Lord you would encourage your heart today to believe Lord and look to the promises and Lord see that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord that healing will take place in that body and that curs of disease be driven out in the name of Jesus Christ for Lord we ask this because we believe Lord we know that you're able yet more than able and we ask father that you'd move on her behalf tonight as her church is even gathered together tonight just to have an oldfashioned prayer meeting Lord and just ask for the mercies of God in that life we also want to join our voices with them today ask for your mercies Lord we pray and your healing power to be demonstrated in that life we ask it For Your Glory we give this time to you this service we give it to you for your glory and honor and ask Lord you'll be manifested Among Us in Jesus name amen amen we'll let you be seated speak to you for a moment uh just like to say it's good to be home been a minute um uh been away been living out a suitcase actually for about a month and a half and I'm sick of it but uh we're glad to be um be back to the house of the Lord with our brothers and sisters here in evening light Tabernacle I do you know of course come home in a new phase of Life uh we let you be dismissed uh a Pap all and uh you know we left right after the meetings to go and and to welcome a new life into the world I wasn't really expecting to leave before or so soon but actually had plans to uh stay and take care of things at home after the meeting and then fly back to Florida but things begin to change very rapidly with Adriana and the situation there so it looked like that she would actually um give birth before I left so we decided to join sister Ruth and Katie and they're still there uh soaking up the grand the little grandson hugs and everything probably listening to me right now smiling about it but that's okay I'll have my turn again but you know I have decided it's kind of weird to be the same age as old people that's um that's really odd but uh you know we decided to join them and be there and the Lord would see fit that he would be born before we left but you know we actually have been working quite a bit while gone minist at brother Danny's Church you know they've been going through a lot as a church they've had two major hurricanes that hit their area and floodings and wind damage and things they also had a tragic death of a young man in the church so we did everything we could to Tred to encourage them and and to help them while we were there and ministered for them and then would leave and meet brother Tim in Atlanta and we had some wonderful meetings there with Brother David mayor and he he of course sends his greetings back it's a it's a big meeting there in Europe and we're glad to be a part of that but then was able to get back to Florida and then you know dedicate Bennett to the Lord Jesus and it was very special to me is my first baby dedication to ever do and for that to be your first grandchild that means a lot and we're very thankful for that opportunity and thank brother Danny for that opportunity so sister Ruth and I are very happy to welcome a new life into the world and and we're very happy for Ben and Adriana as they enter into this new phase of life and and uh you know he's a keeper and we're going to keep him but uh you know also a lot of things have happened in this last few days you know the elections that have taken place some people may ask you are you shocked uh you think this country now will turn around that we got a real president no it's not going to turn around has been indicted for rejecting Christ uh well I thought surely this would be the one the woman that's seen in the vision well very well was you know people's expectations of how prophecies are fulfilled most of the time don't happen like they thought it would you know you can ask those 2,000 years ago about the prophecy Prophecies of Isaiah and behold a virgin shall conceive and it happened and they missed it but there was an elect group that saw it amen that seen it and so but many times prophecies are fulfilled and the masses miss it because it didn't come how they thought it should have or how it would be and you know if I have anything to say about this election and what's happening in our country all I can say about it is stay ready to go stay ready to go this ain't the time to relax and say well it's going to be okay now no you better make sure you're calling an election sure oh I know if Cala would have got into the White House it' been the churches have been filled up I done seen people comment you know about it well if she gets in that surely means Christ is is returning well it matters not if she gets in or not Christ is returning but you know uh this the way it happens so if it ain't today it'll be tomorrow if it ain't this week it'll be next week if it ain't this month it'll be next month if it ain't this year it'll be next year whatever we need to stay ready to go amen so we thank the Lord for all that he's done in our lives and again very happy to be back amen with you today and so with that we'll just turn to Psalm 103 if you wouldn't stand together for a moment and uh just some things that been on my heart as uh as we of course got the news of sister Donna and and even I don't know if much has been said but sister Elizabeth is going through some testing and things doctors with a lot of questions there and so we're just looking to the Lord for that and so I I I begin to think about amen things and I just want to go to the scriptures here in Psalms 103 and verse one it says bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like eagles also 1 Peter 2 and verse 21 says for even here unto are you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should F that you should follow his steps who did no sin neither was G found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again but when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judges righteously who has own his own self be bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead in sins shall live unto righteousness by whose Stripes ye were healed amen ye were healed God bless you can be this you can be seated I I just been thinking about diseases and I thought about the one disease that the angel of the Lord mentioned was cancer and I want to speak on faith over cancer because seems to be very prevalent in our time that we're living in I know that there's probably everyone in here could either say you know somebody who had cancer or maybe had cancer yourself or or somebody even your family but you know I I I take great courage and what Peter said he said by whose Stripes ye were healed amen not not that you will be healed but you were healed that is already done and I I was looking at this word cancer it's a disease caused by an uncontrolled division of abnormal cells in in a part of the body or it's a practice or phenomenon perceived to be evil or destructive and hard to contain or eradicate and I I was looking at different things you know brother Bram said about cancer and cancer is is a ton of quotes you can go through and uh there's speaking about healing of cancer and then what cancer is and I just was going through them through the last week or so and he says you know what is a tumor what is a cancer it's the multiplication of cells that come from a little backsliding cell now I as I Minister this we got the natural but we also have the spiritual amen there's there's cancers of the body natural but there's also cancers of the Soul spiritually amen a cancer becomes from a bruise a bruised cell usually when it comes from a cell that is bruised all mashed up or in other words that cell is backsliding and something happens in there that fails to get the function of the blood to it right and though there's Satan the author of death which God is the author of Life Satan the altar of death puts a demon in there called cancer now cancer is not its name that's the name Medical Science gave it but cancer that's not his name that's his name is a demon amen the word cancer comes from crab it means legs and things that runs out all these other disease are given medical terms but that little cancer comes in there first it's a spirit then it gets into a backsliding cell or bruised cell or a cell that is not operating right he said I'd like to preach the gospel now for a few minutes if I had time that's what hap that's what can happen in a church when you get someone failing to operate in the church Someone failing pulling off getting indifferent that's a cancer in the church it's a devil in that person that's right that causes the whole church to be sick over the best thing to do is to have a spiritual operation he said but this little cell becomes backsliding and that cancer comes in and that cancer lays there first as a spirit then it forms a teeny cell around it on its own and then that cell becomes another cell until it forms its own life and we know how what is happening amen it begins to sap so much blood till somebody begins to feel sick what is it it's a poison it's death it runs into every little fiber of the body down to the tissue stretching his legs out weeding root around this and around that going down the doctor comes along opens up nothing can be done men the best of their knowledge are saying everything he knows there it is sew the patient back up it's finished there's nothing you can be done you can take that person all apart you can't find it at all there it is a patient hopelessly helplessly and gone then as far as the doctor is concerned amen as far as the doctors is concerned but as far as God is concern concern there's nothing that cancer is nothing more than a toothache amen with God there's no such a thing as an incurable disease you know when when we hear the word cancer what comes with it fear comes with it because a toothache is not normally going to take your life amen but cancer has that fear that is attached because your life is attached to that he said but God can heal cancer the same as he can heal a toothache or anything now I think it's a one I think it's amazing that he named cancer and and we know cancer is like a Goliath it's it's a great enemy to the people Amen in the world but when he names that he don't necessarily name everything under it because we know amen when when the giant is named everything under it is also named in other words if he's showing he has power over the greatest then of course he has power over everything else amen so God is showing us very clearly in this age I know who the giant is and I'm calling him out by name amen cancer is no bad thing for God to heal he can make it well can he do you believe you will all right amen we receive it in the name of the Lord Jesus there's no difference with Christ he's no respector of person young or old cancer or toothache it matters not to him if he's Lord over the matter that's right and I'm here to say he is Lord over the matter he's Lord over your life he's Lord over your you're coming in and you're going out he's the one who puts the date on it there's nothing the devil can do about it amen it's all in God's hands so he's truly Lord over the matter so surely we can trust him no matter what the word is given us what name is given us amen he said Remember the Five Loaves and the 5,000 or how many baskets was took up and in other words like this you seen God provide and do a miracle then can't he do a miracle again yes sir can he do A Mir again in other words like this if he saved you from the life of sin can he not also heal your body if he took that cancer out of your spirit and out of your soul that was there trying to eat the amen amen what was even worse and cancer upon the natural body is the cancer on the soul and if God took care of that in your life some of you was ate up with the cancer of drugs or cancer of alcohol or cancer of smoking or the cancer of whatever amen but God God did an operation on you and he took that out of your life well if that God can do that for you spiritually surely he can also do it for you naturally amen but he wants somebody that'll believe amen do you remember when you was a sinner and he lifted your soul in faith to believe can he likewise do something great for you again yes sir amen hallelujah amen TR trumps thinks he's got to make make America great again can God make you great again can God do something great for you again can't he do a miracle or anything else for you amen he said usually when you take a person in a wheelchair and they think well I'm hopeless no you're not no more harder for God to heal you then than to stop a toothache he's God infinite he's in control amen just put a little faith there and it'll go to work he say exactly Jesus passed by a tree it was no figs he said no man eateth from you from thee ever again and went on they didn't see no difference but down beneath the ground that started dying and within 24 hours when they passed by again it withered and that's the same thing that takes place when a cancer is there and God's spirit curses that thing he said you might go back to the doctrine it looks the same but way down deep it's dying way down deep in you if you accepted Christ as your healer maybe you can only move a finger or you only feel this but God is the job believe what you say shall come to pass and it shall be done if that isn't true then God isn't true amen you know as I said in this day God made sure we knew that cancer was under his Dominion you know brother bam talks about it the angel that called it by name not even cancer not even cancer you know is it was getting along towards 3:00 in the morning he said and I was praying I said God I'll stay right here till I die I'm a minister I don't don't let me be a deceiver you know he's searching why am I seeing these Visions you know the story and and he said if I'm wrong come down and stop it shut it off oh God have mercy he said I cried till my eyes were about swollen shut and I said God I'm sincere I don't know what to do if I I don't want to fail you and he said while I was in prayer all at once I seen a light flickering and I looked I said well somebody's coming with a flashlight can't be a car way back in these woods and I looked and it was spreading out on the floor getting bigger and bigger and I and I looked there and as it spread out and the light got bigger and bigger and turned around I heard something going and brother Brandon illr walking and he's begin to hear footsteps and I looked across the board and I seen under the light was coming down a man's foot and a white robe imagine how I must have felt I said oh my I looked like that and I it walked close closer and when it come into the full light it was a man with his arms folded and he weighed about 200 lb kind of dark complexed Mexican complexion or so you know like a Spanish some sort of dark complexion smooth face no beard had dark hair down his shoulders had a white robe on and his characters you can just talk about it one of it was so Meek it looked again if he had speak the world would turn over amen there must have been a lot of power in that in that in that moment there am me the world would turn over and he walked right up to me just as smooth as he could and I was biting my fingers until it felt like it was about to bleed and I was trying to figure out if this is real or not and I I just couldn't move and and imagine the way out in the wilderness like that by yourself and it's dark and all of a sudden this is what you're see and he said he spoke to me and he saido not fear that's incredible his first words were do not fear yeah and when he said that I knew it was the same voice that I had been hearing since I was a little boy yes sir same voice that was in the Whirlwind the same one that showed me the vision I'd heard him talk before he said it wasn't a imagination it was an audible voice just as you hear mine and a man just as real as I'm standing here I could have shook hands if him raised his hand out he he could have I could have patted him on the side he was just as natural as anyone else and he looked at me and he says do not fear for I am sent from the presence of almighty God to tell you of your peculiar birth and and life that has been IND has been to indicate that you have to take a gift of Divine Healing to the people of the world and if you'll be sincere when you pray and get people to believe you nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer incredible here here he is standing here in this darkness and a light comes and a man steps out and it begins to speak to him I've been sent from the presence of almighty God do not ever forget this message is accompanied by an Angel that's right this Angel is still Among Us he's still here he's still moving he's still orchestrating and he's speaking to you tonight do not fear that's right see God did not intend for you to be sick direct quote God didn't intend for you to be sick God Made You in his likeness he wants you to be well that shouting grounds right there cuz the devil wants to tell you well you're going through this cuz you did something wrong or you did this no God wants you to be well amen he has done everything he can to keep you well yeah he has got his word there he's got a fa allowed Faith to be built in this hour why to he knows sickness is coming he knows diseases are here so he's made a way he's made an atonement he just needs somebody to believe sure Satan's against you therefore the cancer he starts or a tumor whatever it is a germ he begins to multiply like a tumor becomes malignant so forth It's a body just like you're of a body it has a spirit just like you are a spirit only it has no soul but it has a life like you have a life therefore in you in your flesh there's two lives one are you and the other is another being multiplying growing a body just like you grow a body well then what does it do that what is that that is a devil I love how how it just makes it very plain what we're dealing with it ain't it it ain't cancer it ain't high blood pressure it ain't this that it's demons amen as brother Brandon was say it I may go I don't I may still have it here I don't know but it would say Jesus never walked up and said well you know thou thou py or thou this or thou blindness or he didn't he said thou spirit come out of them amen he knew what was behind them see this thing is there and it's a germ of Life by the devil and he's trying to destroy your life and he eats up your bloodstream in different ways as he works upon you therefore I know that they are devils Jesus called them devils and that's what what he says the truth they are the devil a devil's a Tormentor he's here to tear up your body to eat you up to destroy you to shorten your three-core and 10 if he can if he can there you go if he can but Divine Healing amen is here for you yes sir amen the word of God is still the same yesterday today and forever listen if it's ever time that we should believe it ought to be right now well you say well we got better science than we ever had we got better doctors than we ever have and we got just as much death as we ever had if not more he said you know Divine Healing he talks about this Divine Healing died out for a while here a few years ago it just let down it happens through the age of History it's let down so often and during that time cancer broke out wow cancer broke out sicknesses in the church 80% of the people are sick Medical Science he said I salute them they do great things they make medicine to sell I I said to sell all right it's all right for those who want to take it it's all right but look in the phase we got today the best doctors we had we got the best hospitals we've ever had the best drugs we've ever practiced with but we got more sickness than we ever had because we got more unbelief than we ever had that's exactly right only God Is A Healer did you ever notice right in the days when they got all these fine drugs and operations and surgeons and so forth constantly they're building more infirmities for the incurable is that right there's there's never was nothing like that ever come before Master Jesus but he would more than a match for it there's no incurable to him I thought I'd get a little bit more louder amen there's no incurable to him all things are possible nothing too incurable for him and when people begin to cry out God do this do that for us send us deliver thousands of his people dying yearly cancer and so forth but then God hears the cry don't you think it's just as possible for God to send down Deliverance for sick people as he did for people that was in bondage and EV Egypt he's just as kind-hearted to your cry why he listen to their cry Hallelujah come on somebody he promised in the last days he would have a church that these signs would follow them they don't think that that they well they don't think that these are the last days it is isn't the time now for these things to happen yes it is here we've got it it's here and you will see it oh yeah Hallelujah but Divine Healing is let down promises are let go well we got the word well yeah in the word there's healing there's deliverances it's time to believe you know he would saying overcome he says says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people try to say there's no devil it's just the thought don't you believe that there is a real devil he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil you might you must recognize him to be real you must know he's a devil and I thought this was something that you know didn't occur to me when it all happened but our youth camp when those demons showed up my son Andrew said you know the devil's really stupid he said cuz he showed himself to us young people and he said we saw him yeah and he said for me to see a real devil tells me there's a real God amen amen and and and and so the devil is there he's a real devil he's against you Amen to try to overcome you but the god that's in you is greater amen and mightier than he is that's the one that's in you is already overcome that devil and by his grace you're more than a match for him whatever you're dealing with tonight if God be for you who can be against you you're more than a match for him by his grace that's real overcoming when you recognize you look back and say well I'm doing this and I'm oh no no no you're not doing anything you're defeated them but there's no condemnation of them that in Christ Jesus that walk walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize that you've overcome by him and you know that this is a devil you can't say well I I got a sickness and I don't believe it's a sickness oh yeah it's a sickness it's a sickness yeah it's a cancer yes there's no there's no faith there's faith is not denying that there ain't a real devil that's right amen it is a cancer but remember this greater is is he that is in you than he that is in that cancer amen you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he that is in you and you can now overcome by him that's right that's exactly the way the scriptures are written the Bible plainly states they're demons the blind people look at the woman the daughter of Israel she was all bound over and bent and he said which one of you you know having a mule wouldn't loose it you know when how much more is this daughter of Israel who' been bound by this devil stooped over and perhaps maybe arthritis maybe that's what the medical doctors would call it arthritis that's a medical name but Jesus said it was a devil amen today Cancer is a medical name they called it cancer but Jesus would have called it a devil amen of course if anyone with a common school education knows a devil means Tormentor you got a Tormentor in your soul see your pastor you got a Tormentor in your body he said that's what I'm here for epilepsy that's the name the Medical Science has given a man brought to an epileptic to Jesus he said my son has a devil and often times he takes him and throws him in the fire amen he says what is it the devil does that and Jesus cast out the spirit and said come out of him the boy had the hardest fit I guess he ever had fell on the floor fren on the ground amen but they thought he was dead and he said he's not dead and he took him up the devil throw him like that in a tantrum before he left him tore many times it happens today if if a Christian now when they come and the demons been cast from them they'll go worse right away and they'll say oh I failed to get healed he said now you believe what's told you faith comes by hearing hearing of the word of God and God here with his gift confirming his word with signs follow and see what I mean one of the most marvelous things I could think of right now in this little instance just before coming he said back in the first part of my Ministry I don't know what these ministers here tell other things but he said he begins to tell testimony I love testimonies and he said about the third meeting I've had my wife had come down and she was a little backwards you know worse than my mother and you know she was bashful and I told her I want to introduce her and she was afraid to come and and he said she was just bashful and backward a little country girl she came to the Mee and come down the street we've been having at the Tabernacle 3 or 400 maybe thousand more people a big night but this time there were thousands more there and another night there had been people healed and miss miss Hade wardr a cancer had dropped off a man's neck rolled across my foot you remember me telling that and he said and he goes on and he begins to tell about all the different cancers that had taken place and derer discernments at a tell he said I've May seen a man one night with one of these on the side of his nose and it looked like a great seed Ward about like that and on the end of it inside real bloody and red and while I was praying for him the cancer left and no one seen where it went his F face was now smooth and in the meeting I seen a woman come over with a handkerchief over her face and there she was and I began to pray and I thought my lady why is the this vibration is cancer and she moved a handker down her nose was eaten off and the young woman about 38 years old said oh my I she said I've been given up by the best doctors done gone too far and he said but he said but do you believe and she said with all my heart he said will you take my word for what I say she said I will I said let us pray and the vibration stopped I said sister there's only one thing I can tell you you just have to take my word the blessings of God is upon you if you accept and accept my word and believe that I've told you what God has said in my heart you'll get well and about two minutes or two months after that as she came to testify and to show amen two months ago I had no nose but W you to look now it's just as perfect as it could be it say well brother Timothy that was 60 years ago so many people are dying what about I okay I'm glad you asked I asked some brothers for some testimonies we got our testimonies here we we know we've rehearsed them sister Atlanta amen wonderful delivery of of cancer sister Denette PR amen sister jeie Camp sister Wilson I mean there probably no I'm probably missing some cuz in our mind sometimes we think nobody's getting healed it's so big brother Timothy and meanwhile God is doing miraculous things and the devil you know gets to be this spooky thing that we fear so much and the then the angel of the Lord saido not fear for I have been sent from the presence of almighty God Amen and not even cancer that's right brother Ben prit says brother Danny Ward was healed of cancer recently he was diagnosed with aggressive form of prostate cancer after the church prayed with him the numbers begin to drop even before they did radiation and through this through his radiation and prayer he is now cancer free amen years ago he said I had a sister named May Brown in our church in brandville her testimony was that she was healed of skin cancer when I prayed for her she was 90 at her at that time precious sister who was also called out by brother brandham and future home and healed of sinus issues and he sends me the quote lady sitting here looking at me right here at the end of the seat she got Sous trouble she'll believe it God will heal you Miss Brown believe you with all your heart Jesus made you well amen but it wasn't just in brother bram's day but a few years later there was another man standing there with a word of faith and begin to pray over her and skin cancer left her and brother Daryl Ward sent me these he said a sister in Kentucky had a tumor on her breast she was in service at the preaching of the word stood up and began to praise the Lord she went to the bathroom and begin to check herself and the tumor was gone amen a sister in Arizona was sitting in the service with a tumor on her chest and during the preaching of the word she began to praise the Lord and the tumor disappeared and she went back and home took her blouse off and it was all gone a brother was in byc Youth Camp with a tumor in his ear he came up for prayer with the children we had a mass prayer he went to bed and when he woke up the tumor was gone a sister came up in prayer with a tumor on ear and he sent me a a picture of this one I wish I had it here but it's actually a big growth you can see it right there on the back of here and 4 days later it fell off on the floor in her house this ain't just back in brother bram's day it's also in our day amen a brother in our church was diagnosed with nonalcoholic therosis of the liver doctors gave him up he was sitting on the platform and I went by him and I felt led to pray for him he's alive today that's right Jeremy Shriner says many years ago we had a sister with leukemia she desired to be healed and believe for and she prayed to be healed as she went through the communion line and while she was taking it she was completely healed and lived to an old age said my uncle who's passed away on many years ago on now but had a brain tumor he said he was scheduled for surgery for it to be taken out many prayers went up and a vision came over by the to the pastor of his healing and they asked him to do it ask them to do a brain scan again before the surgery and the doctors found no tumor the lord gave the family many more years ago and since he's been taken home incredible testimonies he said my dad has had sto stage four renal cancer and we were told you don't come back from that very often but we believe with the help from the Lord in prayers of the Saints and God using doctors he's still with us today amen amen God is moving even now he's showing us not even cancer not not even cancer Amen brother Ben beard sends a testimony brother Bill McCulla in his church he said I was 67 years old my urologist discovered prostate cancer I've been he' been taking different medicines for many years but it actually cuts the PCA reading by half and after a biopsy he told me that they' found cancer but it wouldn't kill you I told him I said well I know it won't cuz God said he would heal me and I thought God knew this about this before the foundation of the world therefore he provided the healing before it was very ever created in my body that's right he said this is around February March I kept claiming and testifying my healing he said I saw the doctor in April to decide on treatment because brother Bram told us to use doctors they ordered the radioactive seeds and did this in June three months later I had my first PSA test and it came back 07 and cancer free 6 months later 05 and cancer free and the prostate is continually shrinking next appointment is in one year I'm still praising God for my healing amen that's what we got to do we got to praise him why not praise him he's in control that's right just because the doctor said cancer does not mean God lost control just because a doctor said any kind of disease that does not mean God's lost control he's still in control brother Andrew Spencer of course gives a testimony of of his dad's eyes how many's heard that testimony Miracle Man looking to have one eye taken out and another one they starting treatment on and could you imagine the the Mind battles the spirit of fear that would try to set in and the reality that would try to come but that wasn't the reality that happened the reality is God's A Healer yes that's the true reality and between one doctor and another doctor it was gone that's right in our day in Our Moment Mark Spencer brother Mark was diagnosed with colon cancer had to take hard rounds of chemo and skin completely come off his feet till the skin completely come off his feet but today by the grace of God is completely healed of cancer Harold shiffley my uncle was Di diagnosed with colon cancer he prayed to the Lord for healing and if God would heal him he would testify to anyone that would listen and he is able to testify by the grace of God I am healed of cancer he said my teeny which is his grandma was healed of breast cancer while taking communion one night God's A Healer doesn't matter the disease not even cancer why choose cancer choose Faith yeah that's right Amen brother Jason Jackson wrote this say sister Sheila mccomus was healed after prayer the doctor did a surgery on a kidney and found no tumor he told her she prayed too much that's a good thing to be guilty of I don't think you can pray too much is what I hear you do a lot of things too much but you can't pray too much she also at the same time had female cancer the doctor told Brother Frank that he that he had operated on several that day that wasn't as bad and they they wouldn't they wouldn't be alive in 6 months I told him then if God healed the kidney he took care of the female cancer too the doctor opened her up and it was all gone hallu also John Kennedy had skin cancer down to the bone spot on his head and hand after Prayer church he went home and one on his hand fell off with new skin under it sound like brother Bram days don't it amen amen new skin on it went and had one under the hand taken off they said they would have to test it he said no need God healed the other came back no cancer both of these have been at least 12 years ago and still cancer free Sister Hall who owned the Old Camp church is now in Hardy she had cancer in 1948 I believe she was so bad they took the back seat out of the car and made a bed for her took her to the Jonesboro meeting and God healed her she lived till probably 2010 or somewhere in that area cuz God Is A Healer brother Kelly would call me today and and he would begin topress he said sister Unice in our church was healed miraculously of female organ cancer said sister Jen billsburg Advance had Advanced stage of breast cancer going throughout her body and God supernaturally touched her body and now she's cancer free she actually was one that came up for prayer the year I had to go in your place up there when brother Ron was was ministering Brother Kelly's father-in-law had prostate cancer and God healed him supernaturally doctors said later they could see where it was but it was no longer there another brother in his church supernaturally healed of bladder cancer you reckon the devil's getting tired of this it's all right I got some more brother Andrew Glover said a brother in South Carolina was passing blood real bad for some time he finally went to the ER one night and they told him he had cancer his family reached out to me and I drove down to see him to pray for him and after we prayed he got real sick all of a sudden and went into the bathroom he's getting ready to have another test and when he went for that test they come back and said we don't know what happened the Cancer's gone amen hallelujah sounds like brother bradam days it is cuz it's the same God and he's the same yesterday today and forever brother Matt Morris said there's a young girl in his Church Destiny she had tumor as a 12-year-old girl and had surgery to have to have it removed they removed that 8 PB tumor however shortly after her mom started coming to our church on her next visit they found that a return she was diagnosed with help me growing teratoma syndrome GTS it's a rare condition that occurs when a benign tumor grows after chemotherapy for a uh some other tumor devil her mom was prophesied against St against stating that the cause of the return was because she came to our church and they removed what they could and was told he would always come back however I love this after prayer she's never had chemo and no sign of return her last visit was told no need to come back because it's not there no longer and no sign of his returning the doctor said she had bad cells and that it would always produce cancer listen to Bad cells that it would always produce cancer the worst part is because they told her that she lived in fear in periods of depression for many years I always get cancer because I have bad cells I always get sick again because I have bad cells she had to overcome that fear even after two surgeries but the Lord came down and delivered her of the fear and delivered her of the disease I got to thinking about that amen we also came into this world with bad cells cancer in our body and eating up spiritually and we'll always do this and get up always in to come back but God came down on the S that's right and supernaturally done operation in our lives and we ain't got to worry about it no more they ain't no going back that's right they ain't no wor everybody regrowing why because God is God and he don't change he's the same yesterday today and forever yes sir he said and there's arm he say he would put his hand in another person's hand he said it's just like waves he said why does it do that he said because the cancer gets excited the life of that cancer the life of that germ there is excited that spirit that's a spirit stands there let me go back yeah that he said that's a spirit listen to this he said it gets excited because that's a spirit he said why is it getting excited because near here you and I stand something that'll make it leave by your faith key that was given there by your faith he said now I'm going to pray for you because you know you got cancer you've been very nervous and upset I'm not reading your mind but you know what I'm talking about don't you I don't even have to say it but now what I'm trying to do is get this to leave and I'm going to pray and I'm going to have the audience bow their heads I want you to watch my hand if it goes away you're healed there'll be three witnesses that right if it stays you still got cancer now remember I can't make it go that's the reason I ask you to watch you're the you're the one that's got cancer if it goes out there'll be a cancer in large and if this now if this if your faith is all now your faith is all that can make it go that's right now I want you to believe while I pray and I want you to watch my hand and see it moves away and then if it drops down the swelling leaves the vibration there goes is normal then in this hand you're healed if it doesn't you're not you'll see as he goes on and said but it's your faith from here on out your faith but see sight and time is God's worst enemy in Divine Healing sight and time said I doubt whether many people here get it because after a while you begin to feel find the people coming back and saying well I had my healing brother Brenham for two or three days but it it kind of left me I think it's because they don't sit in the don't set the meeting right and people don't understand he said men that come to the platform be totally blind C and Cancers or something over their eyes read this Bible after being prayed for walk down in three or 4 days be just as blind they were in the first place what happened anybody knows when a life has gone out of any flesh it shrinks for a while is that right you kill a deer cow it'll shrink like after it's dead it begins to shrink when a human dies first thing what happens it begins to shrink every every flesh shrinks and when this life goes out of a cell it begins to move down and Shrink it'll do that for about 72 hours then it'll start swelling and he said a little dog get run over there on the road you let him lay in the sun three days watch it'll swell it'll be a bigger dog than it ever was why it had died he said but the life begins to leave it and but it begins to swell and he saids the same thing takes place when a demon is cast out of a sick person the first few days or I feel wonderful but then again they begin to say I'm sicker than I ever was I lost my healing and just as sure as Faith took it out unbelief bring brings it right back again that's as Faith kills it unbelief resurrects it that's why a man said Lord help my unbelief Jesus said when the unclean Spirit gone out of man he walks in dry plac and returns back with seven other Devils the good man of the house isn't standing there to protect that door he come right back in the good man of your house is your faith it says stay away stay away now you watch a patient that's healed ordinarily unless it's an outstanding Mir Miracle or something when Divine Healing takes place one thing and the Miracle another thing but ordinary run of Divine Healing when the unclean spirits cast out a cancer devil when it leaves a person will take something so you can see more visual I say a cataract you know it's a blind person and stand there a few minutes why it shrinks and you're telling them to come back and give them a testimony oh my I can see what's the matter life is gone the body of the Cataract sinking but after few days things begin to sell uh I'm losing my sight again what's happening oh he just worked us up bunch of ho roads just got worked up we need something that'll last yeah he said if you believe me and if you believe that you'll go right back to being blind again but if you'll hold on and say no Lord I believe yes sir amen then what happens the body swells for so long it covers that sight again the cancer in the body will swell you become hurting and aching again you'll get horribly sick terribly sick the big growth of dead flesh and you lay in there dead you go back to the doctor say oh that's nonsense there's cancer laying right there I can see it sure you can see it but it's death Hallelujah he said what happens the bloodstream has to purify the body and every time the heart pumps don't you love going to Dr Jesus and the blood around the body and it picks up the infection and that'll make you sick for a little bit and if you had a chunk of meat hanging somewhere as long as a snake or something big Around Your Finger hanging there and it was dead that dead meat begin to be rot and of course your blood steam stream becomes pumps through there pure but it begins to get infected by all these things because life has gone from that devil he has to leave but people's not instructed they go away they give up and the same devil standing right there to take over again same thing with salvation and deliverance people get delivered of something and the first thing you know the first thing comes up and they feel that Temptation if they'll just stay right there in their Deliverance that devil can't come back right no no so don't you disbelieve stay right with it mean it with all your heart no sir I'll not be moved no matter how sick I get has nothing to do with it the first thing you know it'll start clearing up again everything will be all right then the operation of the doctor would have taken you the same growth land and now has no life in it you say life in it brother brand will it take my life no sir the life is a separate life from yours it just showed you that you're a life and become a being a life become a being you're of God it's of the devil but it is now dead hold hold on to the word hold on to your faith no matter that's why your symptoms can deceive you right well I feel worse and the whole time you're healed well I I don't feel no better and the whole time you're delivered amen we got to stay on the word just like Abraham Abraham you got a baby not yet but it doesn't matter he said I would what difference does it make if I feel feel it see it that doesn't have nothing to do with with he said I would right are you healed no that has nothing that doesn't matter if I feel healed look healed look deliver that has nothing to do with it his word said I was amen that's where you got to be doesn't matter years pass 10 years doesn't matter don't don't instead of Abraham getting weaker he got stronger he knew it going to be more of a miracle all the time because he believed God and he staggered not at the promises through unbelief he said we're going to have it and one morning that womb of Sarah be to swell and little Isaac was born why because Abraham believed his God but it's not by feelings it's not by sight we don't walk by feelings we walk we don't walk by our sight we walk by faith whatever things you ask when you pray believe and you shall receive it God said so it's got to be amen he said you see those little white things running there that's the life of that cancer it's only scared because it knows it's going to have to leave if your faith will believe never thought about cancer being scared of you but we've been scared of cancer it's time we start believing just believe sure I understand some have died with cancer and you say well what about their faith you know all things are in God's timing but they died in faith that's right sister Erica she died with cancer brother Timothy what about her she died in faith I would rather die in faith than die in unbelief amen her faith took her there that's right it was God it was God's timing that's all you can say to that but many times mean we allow things to come upon us and we allow it to take place because of our unbelief when it really wasn't God's timing we allowed oursel to go there because of our unbelief we allowed ourselves to lay there in that sin or that unbelief amen why because we didn't believe his word that's right he said' I might just stop here and give you just a little tip anybody want a tip all right sometimes you may be sitting out there with a cancer or sitting with some disease and you think why me being a Christian would I be in this way why would I be sitting like this if I'm a Christian sometimes God lets things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and then he comes and makes a way through for you that you can say this day the scripture is fulfilled in my life what he promised to do he has done in me cuz greater is he that's in you than he that's in the wheelchair greater is he that's in you than that stretcher greater is he that's in you that's in that cancer greater is he that's in you that's in the affliction greater is he that's anything there is that the devil has to put on you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world this is word he said where's the Goliath who's the Goliath brother Bram that cancer that's eating you up that's right that tumor that's hanging on you that's right them cataracts that crippled arm anything looks at it and says it can't be done the devil says you might as well quit believing you might as well just settle down cuz you'll never no more get well than anything your doctor said so all the rest of them said so you can't get well but C the same Christ that made you stop your drink and smoking lying stealing and saved your life it's the same one who saved you from sin and the devil's grave if God can do that for you he can also heal your body sure he's a Goliath but don't take his boast yes sir amen don't listen to him stand in the name of the Lord Jesus and challenge him to a snow a showdown Hallelujah he said I feel religious positionally in Christ if the believer knows his position he'll have it God's great spirit is here and His Holy Ghost is ready to fall on anybody that'll believe it Hallelujah do you believe it God promised it God will do it you're in Christ God Goliath may be bragging Goliath says you see you was here last night you didn't get healed you feel worse today who is that uncircumcised devil who is that devil that has no relationship with God at all who is that that devil that stands with nothing but a defeated thing behind him his master Was Defeated at Calvary he our our Lord our conqueror he is nothing but a BL we won't believe him no matter what he says that's right down with him Jesus Christ robbed Satan of everything he had he spoiled principalities and powers and Dominion his domain Reigns over the earth and the heavens we're subject of his domain that puts him where he belongs the devil down here and Christ up here the Victor you're Davids you're called You're elected you're anointed you're positionally put in the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Goliath you're [Music] defeated did you hear that you're called elected anointed positionally put in the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Goliath you're defeated the only reason there's a Goliath because there's a David the only reason there's a sickness is because there's a Healer the only reason there's a sin is because there's a savior God's wanting to tell you tonight you don't have to fear anything doesn't matter if it's cancer or anything below it you can have faith and believe and God will bring his word to pass said let's liken that today Palestine belonged to Israel that was their Dwelling Place he said that's their dwelling place for Israel to dwell in this body is yours God gave it to you hello he didn't give it to the devil he gave it to you this is your Dwelling Place God wanted you to have it he said but the devil has moved in with cancer and tuberculosis and different diseases you said well I I I'll take him out I'll do this I'll do that but you know what something happened the pillar of fire has come Among Us the captain of the host of the Lord and every devil that's got the people bound tonight is scared to death hello somebody every devil that's got people bound tonight is scared to death sure they are they're fainting they they they why did those Philistines so forth faint why did Jericho faint because the people that had the promise was on the road to come in yes sir the one that's got the promise amen the people the Covenant people the promise people that is in Jesus Christ has got the promise even at the last days that God to raise this body up and make it perfect and we got the attributes of like right and now so they're scared yeah hello the disease that you're facing is scared tonight the devil that's trying to hone at your doors he's the one that's scared tonight why because it ain't you it's who behind you you've been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ you've been positionally placed into his body by the Holy Spirit there ain't no devil that can stand in front of a redeemed son or daughter of God their father the devil was defeated at Calvary and the captain of the host of the Lord has moved in our midst in the form of the Holy Ghost he's here tonight Hallelujah devils are on the move for Jesus Christ the chief Captain said in my name they shall cast out Devils I like how he said it he didn't say in my name the prophet's going to cast them out no no he said they shall cast out Devils he said they failed to get it 40 years ago but we're coming in now possessing the land the same Pillar of Fire the same Chief captain of the Lord as leading the host of the Lord It's Your Land it's your body let's get that straight it's your land it's your body God gave it to you that's right just as David realized this is my land and name no Goliath has a right to stand on my land and make a challenge at me and say my God God's dead I'm here to tell you my God's Not Dead but I'll Stand in my land and proclaim the promises of God he's the same yesterday today and forever sir he's here to heal he's here to deliver hallelujah it's your land it's your possession the devil's trying to take it over but he hasn't got authority to do it he's trembling tonight but the great world of God's power is moving in the building Satan's trembling yes sir are you with me tonight where you at Satan's trembling oh if we can have faith his heart's about gone it's melted in him why because there's a people on the road to their promise they realize the host of the Lord is moving in no matter how high he's walled it he may have walled it out of the sight of doctors but he hasn't walled it out of the sight of God he might be a great big Bluff to Medical sign but he's not a great big Bluff to our God Amen Joshua the savior Jehovah Joshua means savior he's moving in don't be troubled he's here tonight to take over can we believe that tonight it's up to you tonight it ain't up to me it's up to you tonight on this Wednesday night can we believe the Holy Ghost is here to take over he's here to take over every disease he's here to take over every sin he's here to take over every family problem he's here to take over every backslid and cell he's here to take over tonight take over that devil that's been standing on your promises and saying he can't be healed he can't be well I'm telling you today you can in Jesus name you've already been healed time we take our sword and kick the Devil's Tail cut it off cut his head off cut his arm off just keep swinging till they ain't a devil left it's time we realize who we are amen I think about it tonight amen Israel's over there fighting for their land right now even tonight fighting and pushing back the enemy how much more should the bride of Christ be tired of Satan coming in and taking off captives taking our children captives and taking our land and taking what God given us and taking our health and taking our promises it's time we stand up and say devil this is the last time I'm going to stand on the Promises of God and I'm going to take the sword of the word and I'm going to cut your head off [Applause] oh he says they're trying hard talking about the people sitting there I hope they're getting it I hope you're getting it tonight hope you're trying hard hope you didn't come on a Wednesday night to try easy hope you come to try hard hope they're getting it something to cure cancer something to do these things with but it's so far the devil thinks he's got the bluff on you but when the sword of Christ comes down he can't withstand that he'll chop every Cancer loose he'll raise up the Blind and The Afflicted he's doing it everywhere he's here tonight the great Supernatural Lord Christ The Great I Am The Great Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the land belongs to us the body belongs to us hallelujah amen we amen amen and it all has come to me and I will give him everlasting life and will raise him up in the last day as far as God is concerned it's finished the price is paid you're free that's the trouble with people tonight they don't know they're free that's right true well brother Timothy been going around this a long time he said kind of like old Johnny Crow been tied up for too long just walking around that same old pth but tonight there's a sword to cut the rope Hallelujah there's a kind man that come you know and set old Johnny Crow loose but the problem is Johnny Crow didn't know he was loose walked he man walked away and Old Crow he just kept walking around the same circles see he was untied but he didn't know
