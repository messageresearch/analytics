Lord for all your love all your mercy Lord all your goodness to us father I just pray that Lord as we look into your word tonight that you would just open it up clearly to us Lord that you would bless us as we read it as we study it and Lord that you would just take complete control of this vessel right now Lord that you would speak Lord truly the these notes and thoughts that I've jotted down Lord that Lord there'll be nothing if you don't come and anoint tonight father I just pray Lord that not only myself but that each listener here will be anointed Lord I pray that you'll just touch those that are hurting tonight grieving tonight Lord Lord with the loss of loved ones father I pray that Lord that you'll comfort in the way that only you can father that you'll just move in close and they'll feel your loving arms wrap around them tonight father Lord be with us now we pray in Jesus name amen amen amen if you if you have your Bibles with you and you'd like to turn with me to the Book of Psalms 103 we ever get that come through having some technical difficulties but we'll just go on without it so if we just put the scripture up so as what one thing I want us to look at uh what we're going to look at tonight if I give it a title is his body on Earth responsibility and benefits his body on Earth responsibility and benefits and what I want us to look at is as the bride of Christ tonight we have a great responsibility but with that comes great benefits amen so let's just look at uh Psalms 103 and verse 2 it says bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle amen let's also look together in Mark 16 we're going to read Mark 161 17 and 18 while we're still standing Mark 16 verse1 17 very familiar scripture this is where brother brandham would say that that the true church is Mark 16 in action he said all else is false it has to be says and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up servant serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen I pray the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of the word as you have your seats even right there in our reading how how awesome is it that we can see some of his benefits and he's he's telling us not to forget him and he says he says he forgives all thine iniquities he he heals all thy diseases he says he redeemeth thyy life from destruction he crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies and in in in The Book of Mark he he talks about taking up serpents he speaks of the protection that we'll have and and the healing that we'll have and how that we'll have the ability to recover and and I just want to stop and say for a minute what what a wonderful gospel has been given to us amen and and it's always been wonderful and it's always been powerful and yet we know that down through the church ages much of it had been lost much of it had had had been covered over and hidden and lost and and the church was attacked and persecuted and we know that the false Vine got in and and intertwined itself with the True Vine and and doctrines were changed and things were added and and and other truths were taken out and lost and and so there was this long dark period of time where the power of God wasn't able to operate in its fullness it's not that it didn't operate but it didn't operate in its fullness like like what we have today it was it was a time where there were glimmers of Truth and it was small pieces partial realizations brother Brandon would say and it was a time where men were were probing at the truth and and and you know Through the Ages there were great men with great ideas there were well studied men who spent hours in the scriptures doing their best to understand amen and and many of these ideas as we find studying the message many of them were right and many others were wrong or else they were partial truth or or they were mixed maybe with ideas of Catholicism but the scri the scripture had promised a full restoration amen the scripture had promised Elijah and and it said that Elijah would come and turn our hearts back to the faith again and the scripture promised that there would come a day when the mysteries of God would be finished amen and I believe that we can say tonight assuredly that Elijah has come and I believe we can say tonight that the Mysteries have been finished and I believe we can say tonight by by looking around us that there has been a people whose heart has been turned back to the original Faith back to the original word I I believe these scriptures today have been fulfilled amen the the Mysteries have all been made known and and and and there are there there are people whose Hearts have been turned back and although we we stand now in the darkest of all ages I I'm glad to say tonight that we have light amen yes it's dark all around us but we have light and one thing about light is it's undeniable in darkness and as you go on your testimony your life it shines greater day by day by day the darker the world gets the lighter and brighter your light shines amen because you can't hide light in darkness I think I think we're up and running now I'll just leave it right there for a minute amen your light shines brighter and and and we see even you can see a parallel to this time there in Exodus 10 in in in in Egypt when the ninth plague was darkness and it said that it was so dark that it could be felt it was so dark that it could be felt but Israel had light amen that that's our type tonight we we we see clearly in the scripture that the the truth of water baptism how because we have light in this day we we see clearly the truth of of the sin in the garden how we have that because we have light in this day we see the truth of the godhead we we see the truth of the real baptism of the Holy Ghost we see the truth of Divine Healing we see the truth of Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother Brandon would say that's the Cornerstone of the Bible the Revelation that Jesus Christ does not change I'm thankful tonight to know he doesn't change where he stood yesterday he stands today where he healed yesterday he heals today where he saved yesterday he saves today amen amen and we rejoice in that light we're not wandering around in darkness you you see the result of people wandering around in darkness look at the insanity that's from people wandering with no light but we can Rejoice tonight because we're not wandering around in darkness we're not blind to the event to the events that are happening all around us these modern events going on brother Joe had been made clear by prophecy amen so we have light tonight and we're thankful for that we're we're not guessing at what is true we're not guessing at what is false a prophet was able to come in this day and and sort through the thoughts of men from Days Gone By he was able to sort th through those things and say this was right yeah this was wrong this is a truth that you can hold on to this right here needs to be done away with it's a claim against the church that's a false baptism that has to be done away with you sometimes people like to point out brother Joe well you know brother Brandon wasn't the first person to teach this so and so taught this back in the well yeah it was a message of restoration it was a restoration of Truth it had all been taught before all of it it was a restoration well so and so it already taught something similar to this yes but now because of the authority of a prophet even though it was told in 18 whenever I can look back and go I know that's true because a Vindicated Prophet said it's true otherwise it's just a guess like all the other ones but a Vindicated Prophet came and said truth truth truth error truth truth truth error error error truth and what was his job to tie up all the Loose Ends and he did it and he presented us with a glorious message in this day and because of it we have light amen so we stand today with a restored word and with the restored word comes restored power amen we have a restored power we're a body of Believers today standing on the earth with the fullness of the word brother Bram says the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger of this age in her that's us will be the fullness of the of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that's thus saith the Lord so we are the beneficiaries we're talking about benefits tonight we are the beneficiaries of the greatest message that has ever hit the face of the Earth brother Brown says in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the leosan age its Messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul remember he changes not as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive the prophet in his own name will receive the beneficient effect of that prophet's Ministry how many's received the benefits of the prophet's ministry tonight amen and they that hear him will be blessed I can say that's the truth amen and become part of that Bride of the last day who are mentioned in Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come I'm going to say right now if if receiving the benefits part is true and we can say Amen a and receiving a blessing part is true and we can say Amen then I'm going to go ahead and say Amen to the part that says we are a part of the last day bride standing on the earth mentioned in Revelation 22:17 and I want to put my voice with those and say come tonight all who are thirsty come all who are desperate come if you're sick tonight come if you're hurting tonight come and drink of the Water of Life freely amen we have been fitted from this message beyond words we have seen God move in our midst we've seen him save and heal and deliver we we we receive the the the the greatest of treasures I want to Echo the scripture hold fast that which thou Hast don't let it become common to you this is a great treasure that's been given to us in this day and it's all ours to enjoy Hallelujah as his body we have many great benefits and as his body we also have many great responsibilities and in lots of ways that they go hand in hand and I just want to use this as an example tonight as I looked at it I had to cut so much out because there's so many benefits you can't talk about them all there's really so many responsibilities you can't talk about them all so we just pick a few to kind of make our point tonight because they go together because healing is a benefit that we have as children of God but it's also a responsibility of us in this last day to preach Divine Healing and to stand for Divine Healing in the face of a church world that would say that's for days gone by but by standing for the truth of Divine Healing and believing when others don't believe we reap the benefits from the truth that we stand for amen so it goes together by fulfilling your responsibility you reap the benefits of that responsibility amen we we we benefit from it every role in life is this way in in a home the children have certain responsibilities and they have certain benefits the husband has certain responsibilities certain benefits it's the same in the family of God but usually what you'll find is the less responsibility the less benefits so I'm not shying away today from the fact that he's called us to fulfill all that needs to be fulfilled that he's called us to be the final voice to the final age you say oh that that's a great responsibility it sure is but it comes with great benefits tonight he he he's not going to leave us here struggling and barely getting by he says no I'm going to drop you handfuls on purpose I'm going to take care of you I'm going to heal your sick I'm going to save your children I'm going to bring the Lost back in I'm going to deliver the bound because with that responsibility comes great benefits tonight amen amen in a church service we have a responsibility to create the right atmosphere whenever we come together in the house of God that's right sometimes we don't want to maybe I'll just speak for me maybe y'all show up every time and you are just woohoo yes sir but Joe I'll speak for me sometimes we don't want to sometimes we don't feel like it sometimes our carnality gets in the way but it's our responsibility he says let's believe one place one Accord get the atmosphere right be expecting and God will fill us with the Holy Ghost and send down Powers let's break up the atmosphere and get the atmosphere in a Heavenly worship get the atmosphere right Eagles will be born out of any church anywhere well I don't understand why people ain't being born again in our church get the atmosphere right welcome the Holy Spirit he says get the atmosphere right and Eagles will be born out of any church anywhere I say it's our responsibility to get the atmosphere right but when we do it welcomes him and he comes down and we reap the benefits of fulfilling our responsibility amen Hallelujah he said the same thing about the day of Pentecost he said they had to get the atmosphere right and then there came a sound from heaven we when we want God to move well let's get the atmosphere right let's fulfill our responsibility and then he'll come by and we will reap the benefits of it and I think it's wonderful that everything he does and everything he asked us to do there are benefits that comes with it amen and we as his bride are the beneficiaries of All His blessings we're the beneficiaries of a restored word the beneficiaries of healing the beneficiaries of forgiveness Amen in fulfilling what the word has called us to do then we receive the benefits of that word and because of the age and because of of restoration and because of the fullness that has been restored to us we have the privilege of operating at a higher level than any other age but we also have a greater responsibility than any other age Luke 12:48 tells us says but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of Stripes shall be beaten with you stripes for unto whomever much is given of him shall much be required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask more Church there's been a lot committed to us in this day the entire opening of the word the opening of the seals the Mysteries revealed all the truth brought back into one place and handed to you and because of that much is required there's great responsibility brother BR says now God as the light has begin to shine in the last days he is expecting us a great thing from us because where there is much given there is much required so he's going to require much more of us than he did of the lutherans or the methodists because we walk in a greater light with a greater power with a greater witness than they had now we have a greater witness of the Resurrection we have things more firm more sure than they had more has been given to us than any other age and more is required of us than any other age every other age had a part to fulfill and yet in this age brother Joe our part is all of it well this age had to fulfill this part and and this age had to fulfill this part and he says you I want you to fulfill all of it but don't worry I'm going to give you everything you need in order to do it God never asked you to do anything without providing what you have need to do it he says when I return will I find faith and then he sends a message to turn the hearts to make sure the faith is there that he's looking for that's how he operates he don't send you without providing the provisions that you need in order to make it amen what's he want us to do he wants us to fulfill everything that's been left for us he wants us to finish the work of Christ he wants us to manifest Jesus to a Dying World and we have a great responsibility as the body here on Earth but in fulfilling all that he has called us fulfilled we are the ones who will reap those benefits he says the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because see the church the word the bride and Christ his ministry is in the bride which is his body the celestial body or I mean to say the supernatural body of his here on the spiritual body on Earth his spirit is in there living his life right out until him and the church become one in the wedding sea they become one now I have several quotes here in a row cuz I'm wanting to establish what is it that he's asking us to what is our responsibility our responsibility is literally to manifest Jesus Christ to a Dying World The Works that he did shall you do also he's wanting them to see Jesus Christ in you that's a big responsibility when he begins to reveal himself into the seed form again the same one that went into the ground come back to be the bride just the bride and the groom is the same Flesh and Blood the same Ministry the same things doing just exactly what he done the spirit he says those in the bride do only his will we're going to reference this one quite a bit tonight no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time there's a work for us to do there's things listen we don't just receive the message and kick back and go woo I'm waiting on the Rapture no he said there's things he didn't do that he wants his people to accomplish there's things he wants done and he wants to work through them to make sure it's accomplished we've been called and given a responsibility and the authority to do the same things that he did to conquer how he conquered to overcome the way that he overcame to do only his will everybody amen's real strong till you get to that part cuz that's pretty hard you mean I got to lay down my will yes what about the way mama taught me don't care unless mama taught you the according to his will then that's awesome then I do care but too many times as well Mama and Daddy and the way we think this ain't about that we do only his will what is the will of the father in my life to finish the works that he didn't finish when he was here on Earth Amen to finish the work for this specific time and by accepting this call you accept a great responsibility by yielding to the word and saying yes Lord I want to fulfill all of this it's a great responsibility but we become the beneficiaries of his goodness we become the beneficiaries of all his promises of all his might and all of his authority and all you have to do is yield wait wait I thought there was things I had to do I I had to do all these works well now let's bring it back around because you can't do any of it you can't do any of it you have to yield to his will there there's a line in there let's see if I can find it real quick uh his word she knows it was not well maybe I'll find it in a minute oh there it is they know that it has to be God in them doing the works all right this ain't well I'm doing this and I'm Healing The Sick and I no no no no I'm laying hands on because the word says to and the word is Healing The Sick Jesus is casting out Devils Jesus is delivering Jesus is saving Jesus is filling with the hly Holy Ghost but he's using his bride to once again say this is the truth this is the way this is the life and he's working through a people in this day they know it has to be God in them yes he says we are responsible to God we are he's responsible for his word we either Believe it or don't believe it but he is responsible to make his word right listen I found that he is a faithful and true witness he said I'll never leave you and never forsake you and he's been right there every step of the way so what I'm telling you is I don't know how he's going to do it all I'm going to have church without spot a wrinkle I don't know how he's going to do it but I know that his word can't fail I know that his promises are true and I know that he made the promise I just have to be faithful to him he'll be faithful to the promise he'll be faithful to the word he'll bring it to pass in this day we just got to be faithful to God he's the one that's going to bring it to pass he's the one that does the healing and he's the one that does the saving but he has no voice tonight but your voice that's right he has no hands tonight but your hands he has no feet tonight but our feet you are his body here on Earth and he needs you committed to allowing him to work through you yeah yes he's responsible for his word but if she's bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh you're the body here on Earth therefore you're an extension of him we are extensions of Jesus Christ tonight sometimes well I'm Just a Nobody and and woe is me and nobody cares stop you're an extension of Jesus Christ you're called and chosen for the greatest work that a group of people has ever done on the face of the Earth he thought enough of you why does it matter what you think somebody else thinks or this one thinks or this one said he said I choose you he said you're good enough he said I need you to finish the works of the last [Music] age we're an extension of him and therefore we are an ambassador from him to this world Amen now stop and think for a minute ambassadors and ambassadors represent their home country that tells you right then we ain't from here we're just aliens they represent their home country and they act as a spokesperson for their nation's interest policies and viewpoints their interests their policies and viewpoints I'm going to say it again we don't say what we think we're an ambassador ambassadors don't leave here and go to other countries and tell them what they think they're saying exactly what the most powerful person in the country told them to say we don't go and say what we think we we don't operate on our our ideas because if we operate on our own ideas then then we we we no longer have the power and authority of the country behind us we no longer have that backing a as an ambassador we know the policy of our country we know what he wants done with the word we have thus sayith the Lord or we keep still so think about it the the Ambassador from the United States goes to other country and he knows our foreign policy and when he speaks to to the world leaders on behalf of the United States if they stick to the policy of the country then the entire might of the country stands behind them you talk about a great responsibility to say only what he said to have thus sayth the Lord or keep still but if you speak what the word said then all the authority of Heaven all the authority of God stands behind you what responsibility but what benefits we have tonight when when other ambassadors rise up and say we declare that God don't move like that no more we know the policy is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when emissaries from Hell rise up and say we're going to put cancer on them and we're going to put depression on him we know the policy is by his stripes we are healed and when we stand there and speak what the king said speak his authority will back us up Hallelujah yes sir amen all the ambassadors of of the religious world and of this sinful world and and maybe even of Satan may rise up all that wants and condemn it but he has ambassadors on the Earth today standing for truth preaching the gospel El living the gospel declaring that you can still be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost declaring that he still delivers people from habits of the world declaring that he still Saves The Lost he has an ambassador tonight on Earth doing the works that he did why she is his bride she is an extension of him here on the earth and we go forth standing maybe to mockery maybe to R ridicule and he's just pouring out his benefits on us he's just constantly pouring out his benefits he's pouring out his goodness and he's pouring out his mercy and he heals our diseases and he redeems us from destruction he crowns us with loving kindness he satisfies our mouth with good things he provides us for us he protects us when the enemy comes against us what benefits we have tonight great responsibilities but great benefits I say it's a privilege to serve God tonight it's a privilege to serve the the Lord what benefits he bestows upon us he says and because I live you live also and I live in you and the works that I do John 14:12 The Works that I do will identify myself in you what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be light at the evening time now the the very essence of the message that was sent he is risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we who are the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive that's right we draw benefits by proving to the world he is alive what's our responsibility to show that there's a living God manifesting through our life and as we do it we draw benefits from it hallelujah hallelujah Psalm 68:19 blessed be the Lord who daily Loth us with benefits even the god of our Salvation sa he said forget not all our benefits you know the thing is I looked at that and I'm going way back to our opening verse now but God doesn't like to be forgotten that's right he's not saying just you know to to remember it every time you need it he's saying every single day remember that I'm good to you every single day remember that I take care of you remember that I'm standing by your side remember that I'm going to deliver you quit letting fear come in and creep in remember that I'm here don't forget all that I'm doing for you all that I've done for you all I'm going to do for you remember me remember his benefits we are his ambassadors a people who know what he wants done with the word a people who know what their responsibility is and so what makes us different from a lot of other people is that we're willing to face the word you can't be an ambassador and be unwilling to face the word what does the word say where is my life at does it measure up to the word you have to cope with the word that we we look into the word and deny none of it what it says about how how we should live we deny none of it it's not always easy but we deny none of it what it says about how men should act and live we amen it what it says about how women should act and live we amen it what what it says about the New Birth we amen it to be ambassadors we have to know the policy of the nation that we come from that's right we have a responsibility to the word we must stand for all of the word amen you can't deny any part of the word and still be bone of his bone because he is is the word you can't deny any part of the word and claim to speak for him amen we can't separate Jesus from the word we heard this Sunday brother Jason you can't separate Jesus from the well I just want Jesus I don't want the rest of the rest of this is Jesus the word is Jesus we can't separate Jesus from the word and so we can't separate the bride from the word amen so don't claim to be the body if you don't want the responsibility that's right of John 14:12 well we're the bride well we don't believe that no you can't make the claim of Bride and then deny this portion of scripture and like I said I just picked a couple that we're familiar with you could have picked lots of scriptures that that people say well we don't really believe that well we don't well then quit making a claim that you're the body of Christ verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the word works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father don't claim to be the bride if you don't want the responsibility of Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come now I'm not going to go any further because I just wanted to show this portion because what it shows is that the spirit and the bride are in unity they're saying the same thing they're always going to be saying the same thing we're responsible to stand for what he said to say what he said we we can't be like the denominations who are out there claiming to speak for him but denying parts of the word if we do that we're in no better position we we know what he wants done with the word or we keep still see that keep still part's also a responsibility not to run off and do your own thing keep still until God speaks keep still until God's leadership moves in your life let how can I say this quit giving God credit for things he didn't say well this job's going to you know make it to where I hardly ever come to church but God told me this was for me no he didn't no he didn't well God told me to go down this career path and and you know I'm I'm never going to see my family and I'm never going to be no he didn't you're making God a liar you're making him contradict his own word quit making him contradict his own word we are to be his repres representative saying what he said doing what he wants done and we have a responsibility to represent him well what do you mean by this brother I'm going to go kind of slow through this we have a responsibility if we're going to use the word Christian to live a Christian Life or you're not representing him well amen your actions your words the way you treat people it has a ripple effect both positive and negative for example first your family name oh he's your dad okay that could be good or bad that's an awesome person right there who are you I'm oh that's your dad well that make sense or really you're his kid and then it goes beyond family the church name oh they go to evening like Tabernacle oh those people okay remember you represent way more than yourself you know I talk to my own kids and and I say look I get it kids are going to be silly kids want to have fun they do kids do kid things okay but even in a restaurant you may not be doing anything wrong but make sure you're acting in a way that when people see you they say those are those young people from evening light Tabernacle now what what awesome kids those are look how awesome their act look how polite they are look how considerate they are your actions have a ripple effect Beyond yourself and then it goes even Beyond evening like Tabernacle to the message oh they they believe that Prophet know they should all be positive Ripple effects man they go to eating in like Tabernacle they're from this family they believe in that Prophet I don't understand those things but every one of those people I run into are awesome people they're Christian people people they live a life with standards how wonderful that's the ripple effect that we should have we should be representing him well let your live testimony match the testimony of your mouth that's right keep your word these are basic this is Sunday school stuff forgive people show Mercy to people be honorable in business treat people kind love your friends here's a fun one love your enemies go the extra mile for people don't be greedy live for others brother brandham said eternal life is living for others this is pretty simple thought brother Aaron Eternal life's pretty big deal that's what this whole thing's about eternal life what is it living for others putting others before yourself not being greedy don't don't just talk about it live it don't just talk about it why live it let your life match the testimony of your lips represent this King in a positive light he deserves it this King went to Calvary and he paid the ultimate price that we might have life he came and took the worst beating that we could have healing he he commissioned us and said the works that I do shall you do also and then brother Bram comes and says the truth church is Mark 16 in action we're called to to represent him in a positive light to do the things he called us to do to be a Shining Light to the world that God still lives he still saves he still loves you and look at this life that he's given me don't let your life be something that turns them away from it brother Bram says being brought to into the presence of God when God made a promise God is obligated to that promise and when he brings that promise to pass then people are afraid to face up to the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour we find that everywhere he says and when you see then in this day now the word of God has made these promises of these things that we see happening amen we see happening then we've got the responsibility to either face up to it or get away from it I don't want nobody to leave but I'm just saying the prophet said face up to it or get away from it that's right you just can't stay neutral you've got to do something about it some move has got to be made I'm going say it again he died for our benefit he died for our Privileges and he wants all of them to be flowing through our lives he didn't die for those privileges so we could say it don't matter it does matter he wants you to have those those privileges he died for those privileges he wants healing flowing through our lives he wants Deliverance flowing through our lives he wants salvation flowing through our lives and just as as his life brought Victory and his life testified that the word was truth he wants our lives to testify that the word is truth that there's a living God and he's the same and he'll set you free tonight he wants us reaping the benefits that he shed his blood for not just going along like everything's just common place everything's the same as it always was he wants us enjoying the Privileges that sons and daughters have access to and even more than that he wants you to be willing to fight for those privileges he was willing to die for them he wants a people that are willing to fight for them amen listen to brother Brown talking about this he says we realize as Christians that we live so far under our privilege is that you do not desire us to be like that tired and weary and run down and weakening you desire us to be filled with the spirit of God it's one of the benefits that he died for us he says you don't realize the Privileges that you're living under you don't realize there's many great men many Saints there's thousands of holy men that died and Years Gone by Spirit-filled men who would have love to have seen this day that you're living in let you and I take advantage of it amen don't just set these things aside oh it's the last day oh it's the message of the hour oh there's a body change promise oh we can have healing let's take advantage of it let's take full advantage of it tonight and lay aside our thing and say Lord I want all that you died for I want to fulfill everything Lord I want you to fill my life fill every fi of my being I want everything you have for me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves calling ourselves Christian who believe in great Jehovah the promises that he gives us and the benefits he's got for us and the first little discouragement we throw it away oh my how he must feel when he went through so much and he gave so much when he went to such extremes even in this day in the ministry of Malachi 4 so that we would know our rights so that we would know our benefits and we would know the power of God and we' witnessed it right here in evening light Tabernacle not just in the ministry of William brandom although it was it was great and but even in this church and people you know we've seen the power of God move and yet people will throw it away at the first sign of trouble throw it away when it doesn't happen right away throw it away when it doesn't happen the way they want or the way they expect and it's because people's faith has become paralyzed it's a world of doubt and unbelief and it's a time where people say that the Lord has delayed his coming and they begin people even Christians begin to view promises with skepticism we can't allow the disillusioned those that have become disillusioned to change our expectations during the time of what they call the delay I'm not lowering my expectations I refuse to lower my expectations I'm not I'm not going to make excuses or or or or look for a way to explain these explain things away I'm like brother brandom said let's take advantage of it let's get everything that God promised I'm not going to stop short of a new birth experience I'm not going to settle for a halfway life I'm not going to settle for some deal that the devil makes that maybe your kids will make it at the white Throne judgment or maybe you can have this I'm not going to settle for a tore up marriage and a tore up home I'm going to take advantage of the message of the hour and the word of God and I'm going to take advantage of it and have every promise that God has promised me in this day I may not see it today or tomorrow or next week or next month but I'm going to stand in it and hold on to it and take advantage of it it's my responsibility to God he's responsible to the word hallelujah I say we shouldn't stop short of any promise that he's promised us in this day he said forget not all of his benefits take every one of them I'm going to get what he promised me I'm going to have what he promised me he said it I believe it that settles it I'm going to get every one of them he made the promise he's just looking for somebody to believe it tonight he needs somebody willing to risk it all tonight to lay it all on the line tonight regardless of how things look regardless of what the world says regardless of what your family says regardless of what the church says somebody says Lord I trust you I trust your word I'm relying on you to fulfill your word tonight I'm going all the way problem is brother Joe a lot of people have accepted Pharaoh's offer come on yeah I'll let you go but only go so far only go so far only go so far in your worship only go so far with your family family I only go so far in your witness and people are willing to accept that offer cuz in that offer there's no Red Sea in that offer there's no Starving in the wilderness in that offer there's no bitter Waters in that offer there's no serpents in the wilderness but in that offer there's no Promised Land either there's no Deliverance either there's no healing either in that offer we don't cross over into a body change I'm not accepting that offer tonight I'm going all the way across I to tell you something else too if you've been set free don't take a halfway offer and I've told y'all this before I'm going to say it again to make a point because all it's doing is guaranteeing that you're going to be recaptured you're going to be caught again you're going to be a prisoner again well I broke away from that God delivered me from that but I just like to dabble in this little thing and he broke me free from that but I like to dabble in this you know just CU it you're going to be a prisoner again I said just like in in the old slave days if a slave managed to escape from a plantation he didn't just cross the property line and go woo I'm free I'mma build a house right here sir you fing be caught you better run to a land of Freedom you better run to a place where slavery don't exist you better run to a place where the power of the Holy Ghost will keep you free the rest of your life and when them slave Hunters come and say he's mine somebody stands up and says no he he's free in this land there is no slavery get to a place of Freedom tonight go all the way Hallelujah take all the benefits of the land take them all we have a responsibility the full word is open us and he says take it all come on come on put it in action when you don't take all the benefits of the land they become strange to you amen right you don't recognize them anymore for what they are you don't believe them anymore or believe for them or expect them in your life and it was just an interesting thing that came to me as I was reading this quote from brother brandham he saids there were was I believe it was Gad one of them and perhaps half a half tribe it was Gad the Hal tribe of Manasseh and Reuben Gad Ruben Hal tribe of Manasseh he says they didn't go over into the promised land they stayed on this side now notice something go back and read it I didn't have time to put it in my slides or whatever but the reason they gave Moses for not wanting to go into the promised land is because they had cattle and that this side was better for cattle and they didn't care about all the other promises all they cared about was their cattle cattle we have cattle this is what we want they told me said this land's good for cattle that's what we want this is where we're staying now fast forward Jesus visits that same people remember he goes to the to to gadera it's the land of GAD and look at the results of staying out of the full benefits of God's love when Jesus visits them he went over to Gad and that's where they dwelt that's where they made that's where they come from right there and their attitude was still the same they wouldn't go to the promised land before why cattle why they asked Jesus to leave this time pigs they were still focused on their for the exact same thing he caused their pigs to run and they said get out get out you messed with the pigs he said it cost them a bunch of hogs to have the meeting they asked Jesus to leave their land they didn't want nothing to do with it they had their own ways they had their own churches Cycles still focused on the exact same thing listen get your eyes off the world get your eyes off your finances get the eyes off all these things how can I make more money how can I be more popular how can I get this girl how can I get that boy because if that's what you're focused on you're not going to cross over into the promised land I say seek ye first the kingdom of God get in the promised land then all these things will be added unto you says they had their churches they had their own ways lay your ways down tonight and say Lord I just want to Sur surrender it all to you tonight have your way in my life Lord Jesus they allowed their expectations to be lowered on the journey they just look for a place for cattle we can't allow our expectations to be lowered the world is pumping its venom it's called unbelief and if you aren't careful you get struck and it brings death and it brings paralysis we can't let the world paralyze our faith we got to have our faith paralyze the world listen this he says Lord God now it's you you would not let anything harm your scripture I've seen when there were a half million standing there in Bombay India Hindus Witch Doctors trying to challenge he talks about this all the time you ought to go back and just search it and how you paralyzed them and how you shook that Nation he says some place they couldn't move out of their seat he paralyzed them don't let the world paralyze you amen when our God is given a faith that'll paralyze the enemy he said that's what they're looking to see talking about the world remember we have a responsibility to show the world Amen that's what they're looking to see they don't care about some little pamphlet their God has not has got just as much power as any other one you talk about see but when it comes to something they can see that will dumbfound their gods and stop their witch doctors and paralyze them in their tracks and see then they believe that there is a God that can can act that's the gospel that the Heathen has to have that's all our education and ethics will not work with the Heathen he's got to see something he's got to know that it's right and I say that's not just the gospel the Heathen need that's the gospel evening like Tabernacle needs tonight a God that moves a God that will paralyze fear paralyze anxiety paralyze cancer paralyze that evil spirit of pornography that's trying to come into your life a god that'll stand up and say you're not taking another step and paralyze them right in tracks that's the God we need and when we get that God on the inside of us then we got something to show the world then we got something that they'll look at and say it even stops our Gods Hallelujah we need it we need that same gospel amen we can't sit back and let what we have become common to us Church what we have is special it's a treasure it's life brother brand tells a story of the little boy in the 10- cent store and how his mama couldn't get him to focus on anything and was just staring way off into Yonder she began to panic because she would put everything in front of his face try to get him to respond to it try to get him to move try to get him to acknowledge it and he wouldn't move and brother Brown tells this story several times he just sat there staring she began to panic because nothing would move him he says but you know the church has become more or less like a paralyzed condition all these quotes I'm finish to share come from this story it becomes too common these things well that's just about the condition the church is getting into God shook every kind of miracle and sign before the church and still they sat staring in space just like they didn't know how true that is with the church today God shook every kind of gift he can before the church and they still sit and stare looking for something else Hallelujah that's right God is going to get tired shaking gifts before you after a while sit paralyzed he said Jesus is here now showing himself before you as a living God and the church has become just staring out why we believe oh yes we believe but it's become so common to the people I'm focus in on this quote can't you wake up friends to a fact that it's a living God that's in our midst I'm afraid as said the other night so many gifts has been brought before the church till they sit staring paralyzed it ought to shake the heart of people until they rejoice and be so glad eating like Tabernacle I say God has shaken Us in this day he's shaken us the last few years what sermons have we heard what singing have we heard what ser serves that have shook this place what healings and what deliverances and many times he's moving whether it's in the preaching or prophecy or tongues or somebody singing especially when the power of God moves and some of us sit paralyzed he says it ought to shake the heart of the people the power of God's moving the Saints are singing worships going forth and we sit paralyzed he said God's going to get tired of shaking things in front of your face after a while what what sermons we've heard what powerful moves of God and I say to you it can't become common to us you are blessed people you're a called people and I say he speaks in every single service we got to quit living below our privileges he he died that we can have these privileges quit living in a paralyzed condition when he's already won the victory draw benefits from it face the word tonight put it in action tonight he he he's asking for Eden light Tabernacle to believe he's asking for you to trust amen he asked when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth now I'm going to start bringing this down I'm sorry if it's a little long tonight but we are fit in we're turning the corner for home we have a lot to fulfill we have a lot to manifest and it's going to take Faith Faith to do it Hall it's going to take Faith to do it that's why our heart was turned to the faith but you're going to get as much as you can believe for right all right that's an individual thing am you're going to get as much as you can believe for you've got the faith let me go ahead and clear that you've got the faith but sometimes it sits par paralyzed the faith is there but we can't allow it to be paralyzed we got to turn it loose we got to loose the faith so I ask you this how does faith come by hearing the word of God and then you ask the question why am I dealing with so much doubt why am I dealing with so much unbelief why am I dealing with so much fear and so then I turn the question around what are you hearing what are you feeding on where's the unbelief coming from where's that snake bite of Doubt coming from don't feed on the things that are coming out of the world the whole thing is set up the whole thing is set up to cause unbelief the whole thing is set up to cause doubt when that question comes comes when when those that don't believe try to get in your ear when that serpent begins hissing and whing Eve don't listen to it don't give it a minute Eve go back to the word of God turn away that's faith building up but when you run away from that and get back to the word and listen to that then your faith begins to rise don't listen when that Devil Comes what what what's he doing he the Serpent's coming to see if he can get you to doubt he's hissing to see if he can bring unbelief but we are to testify what the word said not what the serpent says but what happens is when we go against the word it paralyzes our faith right why what the what the scriptures say if your conscience condemn you not so think about it if you just give in a little bit when you know better I'm not saying go live some horrible life but do this and you knew better and do this and you know better better and let this in and you know better and then you fall on your knees and you need Faith to ask for that Miracle says and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God it's not now look what's the solution to that brother repent just repent it's over like that repent of that thing move on and stand before God with a clean conscience repent it's not I'm not trying to make it sound like oh no you let a little thing in you're done for I'm not saying that at all I'm saying that's why you're sitting there struggling say where's my faith what's going on something's in there it needs to be dealt with all right just deal with it just move on from the situation because when we compromise and we begin to blend in with the world and we think this part doesn't really matter and and surely that part was just an opinion even though we know better brother brandham says lot did that and it paralyzed him and it paralyzed his people down there they couldn't see it think about it it paralyzed them where he lost his wife he lost large portion of his whole family it vexed a lot but he stayed why didn't he leave couldn't leave he's paralyzed his faith had been paralyzed but Abraham says Lord you see their hands and may the Holy Ghost which has now told them to raise their hands may he come and set them free from the vibrations of the world till they can get beyond the paralyzed charm of the serpent that the snake bite of sin the enchantments of this modern world will not lure them any longer may they raise their eyes to Christ just now and receive him as their savior just now he says just now and maybe you've been struggling Ling in your faith maybe you've been dealing with unbelief and doubt listen I'm not trying to come down you at Wars against all of us there ain't a person in here that can say I never war with unbelief I never wor without yes we do it tries to make us live below our Privileges and it tries to make us forget the benefits that serpent brings doubt and tries to make us a poor representative but I'd like to remind you and this is going to be our closing point it may take me a second to get through it but this is my closing point I'd like to remind you as we bring this to a close that one of our benefits is found in Matthew 16 and also in Matthew 18:18 I don't have it up there I'll just read it to you Matthew 18 verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven whatever you bind on Earth will be bound in heaven I say tonight it's time to start binding that serpent that's trying to hinder you it's time to bind the one that's been bringing fear and doubt it's time to bind the one that has paralyzed your faith you Let It Strike strike heart strike fear right now in your heart and that serpent comes and makes you afraid and it and it brings fear and it brings anxiety and and it brings depression I say tonight bind him I pray right now that it'll strike down in the hearts of you that's been struggling with things right now Satan has no power over me I've been given the right to bind him he hasn't been given the right to bind me but I've been given the right to bind him I've been given the right to to to tear him down he has no power over you tonight you have power to bind him and you have the power to to loose those to loose those that are bound by him your loved ones amen you say oh it's just me no no no you have the power to to to to loose your children that are bound by the devil to loose your husband to loose a friend to loose those around you that are bound amen y'all know this story I'mma go through it it's a vision brother Brown if you want to read the whole thing because these are in order but I skipped parts and took paragraphs out because it was very long it's in Paradox 1961 he says and I heard the weed smashing down he's having a vision and I looked and here come A huge monster snake crawling through the weeds and I thought now knowing this is Vision then I shall see what this animal or this Beast is and he crawled up on the highway and as soon as I got sight of him I knew it was a Mamba now before we go any further I don't want you to get confused the yell stuff's my own words those some notes I made so that ain't brother Brown there's nothing as poison as a Mamba and the snake of of course represents sin death see and like we already made point and what I have here is we're talking about unbelief what is the only sin brother B says it's unbelief he says and when he hits you you just got a few breaths till you're finished turn real it don't only paralyze but it gets in the bloodstream it gets the nerves everything you just die in a few seconds says and there he was on the highway I thought well this is it so I looked at [Music] him so I looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come but when he got close to me he would run up fast and then he would get slower and slower and just quiver and stop and then something would hold him off he couldn't bite me and he would turn around on the other side and try to approach from this side see see he's going to use different tactics he may even use different people he may use church he may be getting to a family situation to come and strike you all of it to try to paralyze your faith try to weaken your faith the attacks come from here and the attacks come from there and the serpents coming from this side and you feel totally overwhelmed but I'd like to remind you tonight greater is he that is in you greater Is He And he says that snake would come up and it would almost get to him but it just couldn't strike him why greater is he that's in you says then he turned and and looked at my friend in a way he went after my friend and I seen my friend just jumping way up in the air and and over him and over him and over him trying to thing was striking at him and I thought oh if it ever hits him it'll be instant death and it was striking at him like that and I threw my hands up I said oh God have mercy on my brother I said if that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him I'm on the wrong page I'm very sorry there we go and just then the serpent turned to me when I said that and looked at me again and a voice came from above me and said you you've been given power to bind him the worst or any the worst or any brother Aon you don't know what I'm dealing with tonight the worst or any I said if we got any of those enies attacking us tonight that we get ready to bind them right now as we bring this down I want us to get ready to bind them because that's one of the benefits you have as the Bride of Jesus Christ you've been given the power to bind the devil the worst or any he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere I said well God forgive me of my insincerity let me have sincerity and when I raised up my hands to him there was a great something come over me just lifted me up seemed like my whole body was charged with something and I said s in the name of the Lord Jesus I bind you and the serpent of blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and he made that sign like a s capital S made backwards an an sign and it means bind this one or anything below him because he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own self to death around his head and when he made the backwards s that that an sign like a conjunction you see choked it to death and the brother was free what did I say to you it ain't just about you what about your brother what about your children what about your husband what about your and the brother was free and just then a voice came and said you can unbind him also so I said then Satan that I might know notice that I might know I unbind you and when when it did he started coming to life again wiggling and this is the part I want to get down to maybe over a period of time that old man in your life has tried to resurrect right that old man that you thought was completely dealt with has started to wiggle a little bit that old man tries to rise up again that's why Paul said you got to Die daily daily not I died six months ago you better die again today cuz that old man starts to W but brother Aaron I bound it brother Aaron I had Victory I dealt with that thing but then a few miles down the road a few years down the road that thing tries to lift up his head again and come at you again brother we thought this thing was over forever we thought I thought I was beyond this and yet that thing starts to lift up its head and I I I had peace why is this anxiety trying to come back on me I had Joy why is this depression trying to come back on me why is this struggle in my life coming back again I remember when church was my favorite place I I love to come I was loosed and and I was set free and I'd worship and I couldn't wait to get in the house of God I couldn't wait to be with my my brothers and sisters and and now there's something trying to rob me and try to draw me out again it's robbing my passion it's robbing my Zeal it's like a roller coaster I'm up and down good today upset about something tomorrow and the Devil comes in and tells you see you've lost your Victory listen to me you have not lost your Victory the vision said that you might know the vision said that you might know bind him again you are not defeated tonight evening like Tabernacle you have not fail tonight it's just another opportunity bind him again and when he tries to rise up bind him again and when he tries to rise up bind him again that you might know you've been given the power to bind maybe he got loose because of something you did something you said maybe you got cold and he starts to wiggle free and he says bind him again tonight you still have that power he's still subject to you you haven't lost your Victory it's that you might know that in this moment you still have the authority bind that depression tonight bind that anxiety tonight bind that pornography tonight bind that lust Spirit yes you buried it yes you overcame it it's trying to raise up again no sir in the name of Jesus Christ I bind you again tonight Hallelujah he says and I said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ and when it did the smoke flew out of him again and he choked himself right back again and he turned to Crystal what is it brother Aaron the word works every time it worked last time it'll work this time you bound him last time bind him this time it's a benefit of serving the lord Jesus Christ you're going to get attack bind the Devil he's going to come against your family bind the devil and then bind him again bind him every time he tries to rise him up what a benefit we have whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose I'll loose church we have a great responsibility tonight you can stand with me to show a Dying World that there's a living God but in carrying out that responsibility we reap the benefits we must repeat the ministry of Christ we must get away from fear and get away from doubt and become that true ambassador of the throne that knows what his policy is that knows what he wants done with the word brother brandham says an ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ owns belongs to that
