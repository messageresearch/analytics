TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and joshua is standing on the outside looking at that city it's night and he's walking out among the people and he's thinking how am i going to break get in the walls you know maybe he has studied some of the books that moses had brought along on how to win campaigns how to be a egyptian general maybe he studied you know and he looks at some of them and he goes back and and he and he says i i i don't know what i'm going to do i don't know how to get into it there there's got to be a way to that that this book comes open that this land comes open that the walls come down we've got to get into the land amen we we're receiving the holy ghost but there's there's promises that are laying there that belong to us and if we don't get the seals open we're not we're not going to fully see and conquer the rest of the land we're just standing on the edge of it and he's out praying during the night and there he sees a man who has a sword on oh i'm glad he's got his sword drawn it's not in his sheath he's a mighty warrior and this is his battle and he comes out against him he said are you forced against us he said no i'm not not either one i have come as the captain of this army i am the leader and i'm going to tell you how to get into that wall you can throw away your books of the egyptians all your past theology amen as brother breton said i hope people are spiritual i would have made a horrible mistake if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something i was writing down to say i was taken from an old context and i had nothing on it i didn't know this what i don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing it's about i had some old context of things i something i spoke on several years ago and wrote it down and i gathered the context and dr smith and many great outstanding can i in in interject the word and the egyptian teacher and and i gathered and uh and all them and what they believed that and i wrote it down i was speaking to say i've studied from that standpoint and there about 12 o'clock in the day the holy spirit just swept down into the room and the whole thing just opened up to me and there it was of this first seal being opened hallelujah what was it he was getting instructions now on how to to bring down the walls amen and he's told what to do as the captain said this is my battle it's the lamb's rights to open the seals and i'm taking charge this won't be william bran i'm taking the seals off the book this won't come by his understanding this is not man's theology come on this is not a seventh grade kentuckian and his ideas amen this is not are you with me this is this is not something that is his intellectual property amen hallelujah it's not his intellectual property it's not his children's to inherit come on it's not their message it's god's message it don't belong to the branham's come on it don't belong to jeffersonville amen it belongs it comes from the hand of the chief captain it's his message and he said this is my battle i am the lamb and i am opening the seals and i am taking charge hallelujah if you'll get a revelation today of who's in charge of this pride it ain't some man-made system it's the lord jesus christ amen the king of kings and the lord of lords hallelujah i said hallelujah those walls will come down those seals will be open tell you what i want you to do want you to march around at seven days in silence and we did for seven church ages marched around and around you know every day didn't know what to say about it didn't know how to open it every man didn't know the mystery we would we just had to remain silent amen when mighty what this one whispered this and that one whispered that and john what was it matthew henry wrote this and scofield wrote that but nobody knew what they were talking about marching around longing to get in but still sealed out but in the seventh church age on the seventh day on the last day of the march the last day of the journey i want you to march around it seven times as a memorial so we did the first day was ephesus second day smyrna third day pergamos third fourth day satire fifth day sardis sixth day fellow philadelphia seventh day laodicea amen and then we then we learned as we went around in the memorial seven times in the last age amen that the messenger of ephesus was paul and then there was irenaeus and martin and columba and luther and wesley hallelujah and present on the scene was the seventh angel the last messenger come on now amen and so there they were we learned about it as we as we went around observing the walls now amen but there now as we come to that seventh round in laodicea where the restorations of what the fathers had were to be had the silence was broken [Music] with the shout out amen where the sound and the wiles came down come on church what was it it was the sign of the king what was it the lord had descended from heaven with a shout with the message the word had come remember with that shout with that message the walls fell down [Applause] hallelujah say brother tim they're not all down cursed is he that tries to raise up jericho again amount then the seal walls are broken and they were commissioned to possess the land and drive out the inhabitants see we're still in joshua within those walls and the breaking of those seals there was a woman by the name of rahab who had to be redeemed there was a people come on amen right in the middle of the opening of the seals that were going to be redeemed two spies that went over the city and got this gentile woman under the token hallelujah under the token of the scarlet robe and this woman was redeemed as the seals was broken hallelujah and she had been a harlot hallelujah but now when the city falls all of her lovers are dead [Applause] all her past lovers are dead oh you can't marry an israelite you were a harlot where are my accusers where are my accusers my accusers were not dead hallelujah you were justified you were sanctified your name was in the book of life before the foundation of the world and he couldn't leave in sin hallelujah hallelujah she had been a harlot she had lived in sin but now she's washed by the washing of the water by the word and the seals breaks in off of her life and her accusers are dead all her lovers are dead did you notice rahab could not bring seed from the old men of her past as hard as we tried to be a good baptist or methodist or presbyterian or catholic we couldn't bring towards seed from the men of our past our womb was there to catch the seedline of the king amen to be a part of the lion the lineage hallelujah of the king to bring forth [Applause] that token of the scarlet thread saved her completely she married someone uh a captain of the tribe of judah notice she didn't get somebody benjamin or somebody of not to lie or somebody of damn but of the driver judah and she caught the seed that would bring forth the kings and eventually the messiah the king of kings [Applause] hallelujah before she was a harlot but now in union to salmon in union to the traffic jew to come on somebody she once was a harley but no more now she's the mother of the king hallelujah her married hallelujah her marriage to salmon elevated her from a heart to a crane what she would be mentioning the lineage of jesus what was happening someone had to catch the seed to bring forth the king our union with christ elevates the people no matter what your past come on it elevates you no matter what your past was amen you've been washed by the washing of the water of the word and you've been told you never did it in the first place your accusers are dead hallelujah you've been washing the blood and you're a new creator a creature in christ come on somebody elevated for what to bring forth the king
