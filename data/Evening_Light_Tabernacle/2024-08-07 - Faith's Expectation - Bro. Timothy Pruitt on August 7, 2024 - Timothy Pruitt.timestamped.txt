[26:06] glory amen how many loves the Lord
[26:09] tonight amen I was with brother Matt
[26:11] Morris and the church there this weekend
[26:13] and they send their greetings had a
[26:15] wonderful time with them but glad to be
[26:17] back home amen let's let's read in the
[26:19] scripture here behold there was a man in
[26:22] Jerusalem verse 25 whose name was Simeon
[26:25] and the same man was just and devout
[26:28] waiting for the consolation of Israel
[26:31] and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it
[26:34] was revealed to him by the holy ghost
[26:36] that he should not see death before he
[26:39] had seen the Lord's Christ amen God
[26:42] bless you today you be seated amen I
[26:46] just want to speak on a thought for a
[26:48] few moments on Faith's
[26:51] expectations amen I I believe we ought
[26:54] to be expecting things from God Amen I I
[26:57] believe we ought to be living in a time
[26:58] of expectation that any moment any time
[27:02] any day amen our Lord will return and
[27:05] the dead in Christ shall arise and will
[27:07] be changed to be like him and his
[27:09] glorious body I'm looking forward to
[27:11] that time I I really am I I believe amen
[27:15] as you you young people are headed to a
[27:17] meeting I believe you ought to be under
[27:19] expectation amen and expecting the right
[27:21] things not just expecting you know to
[27:23] see a few friends and and to hang out
[27:26] for a little while and and be be at a a
[27:29] camp for a moment and play a little
[27:30] volleyball or basketball but to be
[27:33] expecting something from God and I
[27:35] believe if you are God will be there and
[27:37] meet you according to your
[27:39] expectations you know Moses uh we could
[27:42] go as we started this thought for moment
[27:44] Moses for a while he squandered around
[27:47] and and he you know waffled back and
[27:49] forth on whether he was the deliverer or
[27:52] not or whether he was really sin or not
[27:54] and then he tried on his own and we know
[27:56] the story as he would try on his own on
[27:58] he would kill an Egyptian but God wasn't
[28:01] wanting just one dead Egyptian he was
[28:03] wanting complete deliverance for his
[28:05] people and so he finds himself s out on
[28:08] the backside of a desert and we know
[28:11] what happened there is he came face to
[28:13] face with that Pillar of Fire that was
[28:15] in the bush a Amen brother Brown talks
[28:18] about how it took him to a place of
[28:21] expectation and in a place of a
[28:24] revelation in his heart who he really
[28:26] was as we read about Simeon Simeon had
[28:29] been revealed unto him there was a
[28:30] revelation there given by the holy ghost
[28:33] that he was not going to die till he
[28:35] seen the Lord's Christ and and when
[28:37] Moses met this same Pillar of Fire amen
[28:40] that he got this he got a revelation in
[28:42] his heart to go down to Egypt and to
[28:45] tell pharaoh to let God's peoples go and
[28:48] he became very Fearless he he knew
[28:50] exactly where he was standing and mean
[28:52] God said to him to go tell Pharaoh let
[28:54] him go and that's what he went and done
[28:56] and and you know and God told him that
[28:58] he would come to this mountain again and
[29:00] he would and and so he knew by faith
[29:02] that when he went there that Pharaoh's
[29:04] power would be lost he would not have
[29:06] power over him but in turn God would
[29:08] give him power over the Egyptians and
[29:11] that's exactly what happened and they
[29:12] were brought back to this same Mountain
[29:15] again and brother brand says we know
[29:17] where we're going to and this is we are
[29:19] at the end of The Journey God has promis
[29:22] there's a land beyond the river be
[29:24] Fearless Amen in your testimony if it's
[29:27] revealed to you you you become Fearless
[29:29] you don't care if the whole world what
[29:31] they say who says what you're Fearless
[29:34] he said when it's revealed to you that
[29:36] this is the truth coming from God you
[29:38] can be Fearless about it if if not you
[29:41] can't be but David another one you know
[29:43] he expressed to the whole Israelite Army
[29:46] amen that he had faith in his God and
[29:49] and here Goliath is making his Challenge
[29:51] and David wasn't a very big man or was
[29:53] it wouldn't be the pick you know to go
[29:55] out and fight him he wasn't the match or
[29:57] didn't really have the right weapon so
[29:59] to speak but he it didn't matter maybe
[30:01] maybe there were other people that were
[30:03] more qualified but David had been had
[30:05] been revealed to him that he was going
[30:07] to be king amen and so through that
[30:09] Revelation it gave him Faith to expect
[30:12] this Giant's going to fall amen and I I
[30:15] believe we can have that same
[30:16] expectation when it's revealed to us who
[30:18] we are that we're Sons and Daughters of
[30:20] the most high God then we also can have
[30:23] by Revelation have the same expectations
[30:26] that if we meet a giant and our path he
[30:28] will be just as Goliath amen amen what
[30:31] God will give us what we have need of In
[30:33] Our Moment of trial God will give us the
[30:36] healing we need God to give us the
[30:38] deliverance we need and he said see he
[30:40] said there he was standing upon the land
[30:43] that God had given Israel and there's
[30:45] this boasting uncircumcised Philistine
[30:47] out there he said we'll call him cancer
[30:49] tonight we'll call him whatever but
[30:51] David maybe no kind of match for him no
[30:54] weapon in his hand that would seem to
[30:55] work but he had this little piece of
[30:58] leather it was a goat skin and it been
[31:00] had been revealed to him that this giant
[31:02] was coming down but it was when it was
[31:05] revealed to him Revelation struck and he
[31:07] said the god that took me out of the
[31:09] paws of the bear and took me out of the
[31:12] paws of the lion how much more will he
[31:14] deliver me from an uncircumcised
[31:16] philistin amen he says his his brothers
[31:19] maybe were more than able to do it Saul
[31:22] was more than able to do it but it
[31:23] wasn't revealed to them but they
[31:25] believed it could be done they believed
[31:28] God could do it but it wasn't revealed
[31:30] to them that they could but it was
[31:32] revealed to David see that's a
[31:34] difference right there it's Absol when
[31:36] it's absolutely revealed to you that
[31:38] God's going to heal you you're going to
[31:41] get
[31:42] it amen you're going to get it I don't
[31:44] care what's wrong with you what's the
[31:47] odds against you it may be worse than
[31:49] David and Goliath but if it's revealed
[31:51] to you you are going to receive it
[31:54] notice when it's revealed David became
[31:56] Fearless he said today
[31:58] I'll cut your head off amen he began to
[32:01] speak words that a little boy don't
[32:02] normally speak to a giant but see David
[32:05] was not not depending upon his ability
[32:08] he wasn't depending upon his sling
[32:10] ability he was depending upon his God's
[32:12] ability and he knew the same God that
[32:15] watched over him with the lion watched
[32:17] over him with the bear is the same God
[32:19] had give him the victory over Goliath
[32:21] notice the the Giant on the other side
[32:24] didn't believe it it wasn't Revelation
[32:26] to him neither will the cancer he
[32:28] laughed am I a dog that you would send a
[32:30] kid out here to fight me am I nobody
[32:33] that you'll just send just send anybody
[32:35] to fight me I'll take my Spear and I'll
[32:38] I'll hold you up David and I'll let the
[32:40] birds eat from your flesh amen he had
[32:42] everything on his side seemed like all
[32:45] odds were against David but see that
[32:47] didn't Shake David at all because it had
[32:50] been revealed to him that this Giant's
[32:52] head was coming off amen it' been
[32:55] revealed to him that it was going to be
[32:56] over with and amen as David would let go
[32:59] of that Ro That Rock Amen if God would
[33:01] just speak to your heart tonight you're
[33:04] not going to be laying in that bed any
[33:06] longer you're not going to be sitting in
[33:08] that chair any longer you're going to be
[33:10] well amen you're not going to be in that
[33:12] situation any longer you're not going to
[33:14] be in that sin any longer you're going
[33:16] to be saved amen there wouldn't be
[33:18] anything change your mind about it if
[33:21] that Faith could fall into your heart
[33:23] and bring an expectation to bring it to
[33:25] pass amen until that happened he said
[33:28] every preacher in the world could pray
[33:30] unless it happens that God reveals it to
[33:33] you every preacher in the world can pray
[33:36] sure it would encourage you but the
[33:38] healing power is already in you it's
[33:42] already there amen it don't come from a
[33:44] preacher it comes by
[33:47] Revelation it comes by faith it's not by
[33:50] power not by might but by my spirit
[33:53] sayeth the Lord by Faith by Revelation
[33:56] amen David prove this was work some of
[33:59] them say you know I know you're just a
[34:00] naughty boy what are you doing you
[34:02] should be back up there tending the
[34:03] father's Sheep amen let let me he said
[34:05] but he said let me speak to Saul let me
[34:08] talk to somebody and he said well now
[34:09] son I admire your courage but you see
[34:12] you're nothing but a youth and this
[34:13] man's a Warrior from from his youth here
[34:16] no match for him and he said but I was
[34:18] tending my father's sheep see he was
[34:21] basing what he was about to do on a
[34:24] revelation on what God had done for him
[34:26] an experience amen he said oh brother he
[34:29] said see amen I have an experience he
[34:32] said it's the same if God has revealed
[34:34] to you that he's your healer and and
[34:36] he's your savior amen it's got to be
[34:39] revealed
[34:42] first come on if it's not revealed to
[34:45] you it doesn't matter how many times a
[34:47] preacher lays his hand on you it doesn't
[34:50] matter how many times words are spoken
[34:52] to you but until it's revealed to
[34:55] you Hallelujah this is what we want our
[34:58] young people to have their own personal
[35:00] revelation of Jesus Christ not what Mom
[35:03] and Dad's passed down amen this message
[35:05] is not a learned theology or a learned
[35:08] behavior this message is a
[35:11] revelation and it has to be a personal
[35:14] revelation amen Christ is not a a
[35:16] something that can be handed down
[35:18] generation after generation sure you can
[35:21] learn a bunch of rules and a bunch of
[35:22] regulations all kinds of stuff you can
[35:24] be taught amen but Christ wants to be a
[35:27] revelation to you he wants to be a
[35:29] revelation to your heart and to your
[35:32] life it ain't just about a preacher
[35:33] getting a revelation it's about you
[35:36] having your own personal relationship
[35:38] and revelation of Jesus
[35:41] Christ amen see if if it had he said he
[35:45] had something to base faith on it was on
[35:48] a revelation the same God that delivered
[35:50] me from the Pauls of a lion and a bear
[35:53] will deliver me from that uncircumcised
[35:55] philistin how do you know David I
[35:57] believe it it's been revealed to me he
[36:00] knew what he was talking about because
[36:02] he when the giant said I'm going to feed
[36:05] you to the birds he said I'm going to
[36:07] cut your head
[36:09] off amen he didn't back up when that
[36:12] giant begin to boast at him I mean the
[36:14] giant had been talking to everybody but
[36:16] it came time that the giant was talking
[36:18] to
[36:20] David but when he came down to David and
[36:22] said I'm going to feed you to the birds
[36:24] David didn't back up and said wait wait
[36:26] a minute what am I doing down here no he
[36:28] went forward he said today I'm going to
[36:30] take your head off amen this is what we
[36:33] need is somebody that are not back up
[36:35] when the Devil comes but to go forward
[36:38] amen say no it's been revealed to me I
[36:40] am a Son of God I am a daughter of God
[36:43] this is what God has called me for in
[36:46] this hour in this
[36:49] moment see Samson was caught off guard
[36:51] one day you know a thousand Philistines
[36:54] come up to him and he looked down the
[36:55] ground it wasn't nothing but a jawb
[36:58] but he picked up that old Jawbone dry as
[37:01] it can be and took out all of those
[37:02] Philistines beat him over the beat him
[37:04] over the head with an old dry draw bone
[37:06] of a mule and as far as he said as far
[37:09] as I know not a tooth ever fell out of
[37:11] it and then Philistines helmet maybe an
[37:13] inch thick cuz they beat each other with
[37:16] war clubs back in that day and he kept
[37:19] here's a man to you know to keep a man
[37:21] from beating in the head they wore these
[37:22] big old huge helmets but he took the
[37:24] Jawbone of that mu and beat down a
[37:26] thousand phis
[37:28] and the Jawbone never broke he just kept
[37:30] beating them like that as they come up
[37:32] and the rest of them took off for the
[37:34] Rocks amen he said see he said I want to
[37:37] tell you something work on that
[37:40] pulsation work on that spur the moment
[37:43] like Joshua did like Mary Magdalene did
[37:46] all of those just that moment when
[37:48] something is revealed to you grab a hold
[37:50] of it amen hold on to it that spur the
[37:54] moment yes it was revealed to him and he
[37:57] went to meet those thousands of
[37:58] Philistines he said now what do you
[38:00] think when those Philistines had look
[38:02] come in here that little shrimp you know
[38:04] brother Brown talks about it he said
[38:05] people want to draw him as some big
[38:07] muscular fell some big giant he said but
[38:09] he was just a shrimp little curly-headed
[38:11] mama's boy didn't look like he could do
[38:14] very much but after a thousand they
[38:16] changed their mind amen but it wasn't
[38:19] him anyhow it was a God that was behind
[38:21] him it was the Covenant the Revelation
[38:24] that would been given to him amen that
[38:26] gave him the ability to fight like
[38:29] that come on somebody we're also living
[38:33] under a
[38:35] covenant we are a covenant people amen
[38:37] that has been come to that's what gives
[38:39] us the ability when all Hell Comes
[38:42] against us we'll still stand when we
[38:45] lose on every side seem like we'll still
[38:49] fight cuz we're under a covenant
[38:55] sir boys they was looking at that boy
[38:57] ain't that ridiculous what's he doing
[39:00] what he was doing was expressing to
[39:01] those of Philistines what had been
[39:03] revealed to him by
[39:05] God hallelujah Oh my he grabbed a
[39:08] Jawbone and took off because that what
[39:10] he put in his hand he put that in his
[39:12] hand that's what he believed he could do
[39:13] and by doing so he was expressing to
[39:16] those Philistines what God put in his
[39:18] heart to do amen so you must have that
[39:20] same amen that same expression when you
[39:24] feel God move upon your heart move
[39:28] young people when you feel God tug
[39:32] move amen don't don't wait another
[39:35] service don't wait another moment don't
[39:37] don't put it off to the last
[39:39] service that's a lot of our expectations
[39:41] a lot of times as well Saturday night

[39:45] good service the first service and the
[39:47] rest of them be
[39:49] great you can have the most amazing
[39:51] service the first service and get things
[39:53] with go right with God and everything
[39:55] else will be so wonderful to you
[39:58] Hallelujah but you ought to have that
[40:00] expectation God I'm looking for you on
[40:02] the first service I'm looking for you to
[40:05] move in my life immediately Lord I'm not
[40:08] looking for a day off quit letting the
[40:09] devil put you off in another day amen
[40:12] but this moment this time I'm going to
[40:14] receive something from
[40:18] God but expectations is based upon Faith
[40:23] you have to have faith before you can
[40:25] expect anything
[40:28] Faith come and faith comes by hearing
[40:30] and hearing of the word of God so that's
[40:33] where you must solemnly base your faith
[40:35] on is thus sayeth the Lord amen you must
[40:38] believe it it's God's word that's the
[40:40] only hope you can have that's the only
[40:41] substantial thing you can stand upon in
[40:43] this day is the word of God you can't
[40:45] stand on anybody else's word sure you
[40:48] there's good men in this world but good
[40:50] men can
[40:52] fail but God will never fail amen so you
[40:56] can stand upon his word he's infinite he
[40:58] won't make a mistake he's perfect
[41:00] therefore all of his promises are
[41:02] perfect as he is
[41:05] perfect Hallelujah do you know you're
[41:07] one of God's
[41:09] promises that means you're perfect
[41:11] tonight amen because God's per promises
[41:14] are perfect Amen in the beginning was
[41:17] the word and the Word was with God and
[41:18] the Word was God the word was made flesh
[41:20] and dwelt Among Us the word itself so
[41:23] therefore the Bible is the word of God
[41:25] it it is God himself placed upon
[41:29] paper for no man is any better than his
[41:32] word if we can't take a man's
[41:34] word it just can't have dealings with
[41:36] that
[41:38] man come on a man says he's going to pay
[41:42] you so much money and you he don't you
[41:44] can't have dealings with that
[41:47] man it's just the way it is I'm so you
[41:50] can't can't trust his word well I
[41:53] forgot amen if you got something you got
[41:55] a uh you got a something between between
[41:58] another you ought to take care of your
[41:59] word if you said you was going to do it
[42:01] do
[42:02] it amen but listen men will fail men
[42:05] will forget man men will get other
[42:07] things on their mind and other thoughts
[42:09] and they'll think about a lot of other
[42:11] things and forget all about you but God
[42:14] won't Hallelujah he won't forget about
[42:17] you he won't get other things on his
[42:18] mind he amen his mind is upon you
[42:21] tonight his mind is upon every young
[42:23] person here tonight his mind is upon
[42:25] every married person here tonight his
[42:27] mind is upon every one of his children
[42:32] tonight he won't forget
[42:35] you but here's Simeon as we read the
[42:38] Scripture it was promised by the Holy
[42:40] Spirit he would not see death until he
[42:43] seen the Lord's
[42:44] Christ he had a right to expect
[42:48] it because it had been revealed to him
[42:50] by the Holy
[42:52] Ghost so he had a right to have that
[42:55] kind of expectation
[42:57] amen if God has revealed to you
[42:58] something you have a right to expect
[43:01] it's going to come to pass it may take
[43:03] 25 years but if he said it you have the
[43:06] right to expect it amen Abraham he he
[43:09] was an old man you know when he was 75
[43:11] years old and his wife 65 and the Lord
[43:14] spoke to him and revealed to him he was
[43:16] going to have a baby by Sarah his wife
[43:18] he was sterile she was Barren they'd
[43:20] been that way all their lives but yet
[43:22] God told him it was going to have have a
[43:24] child by Sarah so if God said it he had
[43:27] a right to expect
[43:29] it amen if God said he's going to have a
[43:32] bride without spot without wrinkle we
[43:35] have a right to expect that if God said
[43:38] You by his stripes I am healed I have a
[43:40] right to expect that if he said I'm the
[43:43] Lord God that heals all th diseases I
[43:45] have a right to expect that if he said
[43:48] the promises unto you and your children
[43:51] I have a right to expect
[43:54] that he said it
[44:01] but he asked him to separate
[44:03] himself to receive the promise this is
[44:06] where people get a problem they don't
[44:08] they want the promise but they don't
[44:09] want to separate
[44:11] themselves Abraham had brought a lot of
[44:13] baggage along with him his father-in-law
[44:15] and his his his nephew and all this
[44:18] stuff and it was causing him a lot of
[44:19] grief and a lot of Anguish and he's
[44:21] bringing them all right and the Lord
[44:22] said look you got to separate yourself
[44:24] if you want to receive this are we under
[44:26] the same Covenant as Abraham then don't
[44:29] be surprised if God is asking you to
[44:31] separate
[44:32] yourself separate yourself from those
[44:34] who are who have unbelief in their life
[44:37] separate your well they're they're my
[44:38] friends they're not your friends unless
[44:40] they're lifting you up towards Jesus
[44:42] Christ if they're tearing you down and
[44:44] bringing you down they are not your
[44:52] friends we take God at his word we have
[44:54] to separate oursel from all the things
[44:56] that are contr contrary to that word if
[44:58] we want to receive the promise you know
[45:01] you can't go to people and say how now
[45:03] how do you think I got my
[45:05] healing it ain't what they
[45:08] think it has nothing to do with it it's
[45:11] what you think it's up to
[45:14] you so he was asked to separate himself
[45:18] people get so worried about what other
[45:19] people
[45:20] think come on now young people
[45:23] especially how how do you think I look
[45:27] what do you think about it doesn't
[45:29] matter what anybody else thinks about it
[45:32] matters what he thinks about
[45:34] it amen they get so worried about it
[45:36] they can be accepted in in certain you
[45:39] know groups or this that and the other
[45:41] listen the main thing is the Bible says
[45:43] I've been made accepted in the
[45:46] Beloved that's all that matters amen I I
[45:49] don't it doesn't matter if I'm accepted
[45:51] by this one or that one or somebody else
[45:53] that matters not
[45:57] come on now it ain't about what somebody
[46:00] else thinks or what somebody else has or
[46:02] what somebody else expects what do you
[46:04] expect I want to ask you young people
[46:06] you're about to get on the bus and
[46:08] you're about to go 16 hours and and and
[46:10] and it ain't going to be real
[46:11] comfortable and it ain't going to be the
[46:13] most it'd be nice but it ain't going to
[46:14] be the most comfortable trip you ever
[46:16] been on but why are you
[46:21] going why are you going why why you
[46:23] putting the effort why' you pay the
[46:25] money why you going 16 hours through the
[46:27] night to go are you going just to have a
[46:29] good time or what are you going for what
[46:31] is your
[46:32] expectation are you expecting God to do
[46:35] something for you well if you are God
[46:37] will do what you're expecting him to do
[46:39] are you expecting to be filled with the
[46:41] Holy Ghost well then if you are expect
[46:43] to come back filled with the Holy Ghost
[46:45] are you expecting to be closer to God
[46:47] well if you are expect to come back
[46:49] closer to
[46:52] God it doesn't matter what anybody else
[46:55] thinks amen
[46:58] right we find out that the child didn't
[47:01] arrive until 25 years
[47:04] later but that didn't change Abraham's
[47:08] expectation but instead of growing
[47:10] weaker because it didn't happen the
[47:12] first month or didn't happen the next
[47:14] one or the next year he grew stronger
[47:17] his expectation was
[47:20] greater because it was revealed to him
[47:22] by faith wasn't revealed to him by
[47:25] feeling amen
[47:28] amen listen we we can't get the Holy
[47:30] Ghost by a feeling because your feelings
[47:33] eventually ain't going to be where they
[47:34] were when you're at
[47:36] Camp you get to camp and you you get you
[47:39] under expectations and the atmosphere
[47:41] and things are happening and people are
[47:42] jumping and shouting and car oh that's
[47:44] fine and wonderful I enjoy every bit of
[47:47] it but that's not our
[47:49] expectations our expectations is lives
[47:52] to be changed that when all the jumping
[47:55] and the shouting and the atmosphere is
[47:57] gone amen you're still walking with God
[48:00] 25 years you're still walking with God
[48:02] whatever time we got left up this Earth
[48:04] you're still work Walking with God it
[48:07] doesn't matter if you're in a valley on
[48:08] a hill amen going through a trial going
[48:10] through sickness you're still walking
[48:12] with God that is our
[48:20] expectation Sarah was one month older
[48:22] what be one month or one month further a
[48:24] year it be one year greater and the
[48:27] expectation because God always keeps his
[48:30] word it would be a it be a lot better
[48:33] for her to have a child at a listen this
[48:36] listen to this right here it would be a
[48:38] lot better for her to have a child at a
[48:41] hundred years old than it would be at 60
[48:43] years old
[48:45] what it's a greater Miracle all the
[48:50] time so he never grew weak but he grew
[48:53] stronger now in our time we thought well
[48:55] it' been a lot better if it happened
[48:56] earlier and man she just had a CH but
[48:58] that ain't the way God works
[49:00] sometimes God's time is not our
[49:03] time the way he operates and the way he
[49:06] thinks his as the Bible say his thoughts
[49:09] are much higher than our
[49:11] thoughts because there's a lot of things
[49:13] I would think you know if I was God you
[49:14] know I would do it different but I'm not
[49:16] God some of you have the same
[49:20] thoughts well you know if I was if I if
[49:23] I could make this decision but it ain't
[49:25] us but he's seeing things different than
[49:28] what we can see things we have a limited
[49:31] sight we have limited thoughts we have
[49:33] limited abilities and yes some of ours
[49:36] is greater than others and somebody some
[49:38] people's got greater intellect than
[49:39] other people got but it's still I don't
[49:41] care if you got the greatest brain on
[49:42] the face of this Earth is still a
[49:44] limited
[49:45] brain and it's still nothing compared to
[49:47] what God has and the sight that he has
[49:50] is nothing or that we have is nothing
[49:52] compared to what he has he is seeing
[49:55] from a different place and can see the
[49:57] amen the beginning to the
[50:00] end we can only see one day to the next
[50:03] day we can only see the minute that's in
[50:06] front of our face or the second amen we
[50:08] can't see what's going to happen
[50:09] tomorrow or the next day a or even hour
[50:14] later things can change so quickly and
[50:17] we don't even see it coming but God sees
[50:19] it amen and so God plans for things he
[50:23] he's got things in his plans and and
[50:25] he's moving things and operating way
[50:27] that we can't comprehend but when we get
[50:29] to the other side and we have a body
[50:31] like his glorious body we'll be able to
[50:33] look back and say oh it all makes sense
[50:35] now I see why he did
[50:39] this why this happened this
[50:43] way sometimes it don't go the way we
[50:45] think but it goes the way God
[50:48] thinks so so if we're children of
[50:50] Abraham and we are the Bible said so we
[50:53] being dead in Christ take on Abraham's
[50:55] seed or HS according to the promise
[50:57] we're heirs because Abraham was given
[50:59] the promise now if we are heirs with
[51:00] Abraham then we are Abraham's children
[51:02] the same faith that Abraham had we must
[51:04] have
[51:07] ourselves the same a faith Abraham had
[51:10] we must have ourselves so when God makes
[51:13] a promise just know it's going to
[51:16] happen amen it can't do nothing else but
[51:19] happen can you imagine Abraham and Sarah
[51:21] 75 65 years old amen 201 15 20 years
[51:25] past men OFA
[51:27] and here here he lived with her since
[51:28] she was probably 16 17 years old no
[51:31] children but God Appears and told him
[51:33] what's going to happen you're going to
[51:34] have a child and Abraham expected that
[51:36] to happen because God said so but could
[51:39] you imagine them going down to the
[51:41] doctor and making arrangements with the
[51:44] doctor what would the doctor
[51:47] say man this old fell he done fell off
[51:50] his rocker something's wrong somewhere
[51:53] in his mental makeup every
[51:57] every listen to this every man or woman
[51:59] that takes God by faith and accepts his
[52:03] promises is considered by this world
[52:06] some kind of
[52:08] fanatic because the things of this world
[52:11] is so foolish to God what man calls
[52:14] great God calls
[52:18] foolish but Abraham
[52:20] believed first 28 days after her being
[52:24] passed 15 20 years past minut Paul how
[52:27] you feeling honey no different well
[52:30] praise
[52:31] God we're going to have a baby
[52:34] anyhow so much expectation in the house
[52:37] that maybe Sarah needed some booties and
[52:39] a little blanket and she was expecting
[52:41] something to happen he said and that's
[52:43] the reason it
[52:45] happened hello somebody that's the
[52:48] reason it happened year by year passed
[52:51] on Abraham got stronger giving praise to
[52:54] God and finally it happened why because
[52:56] he expected it to
[52:59] happen Hallelujah and here she was 90
[53:02] years old and he was 100 what do you
[53:04] think about Abraham about to give up no
[53:06] sir we're going to have a baby we done
[53:08] got the co clothes made we got the bed
[53:10] ready we got everything how long you
[53:12] been how long you had them 25 years but
[53:15] God's going to send it
[53:17] anyhow see it's positive God said so and
[53:20] that settles it whatever God makes a
[53:22] decision he makes it for eternity
[53:27] now you know me and you can make a
[53:28] decision in five minutes have to go back
[53:31] and make another
[53:33] one because you was mistaken the first
[53:37] decision we make mistakes like that we
[53:40] pull the trigger sometime and we mess up
[53:42] and this that and the other but God
[53:44] being infinite he don't make
[53:47] mistakes if he makes a decision it's
[53:49] settled
[53:54] forever so if he made it a decision
[53:57] you're my
[54:00] son anybody seen that in the word where
[54:03] God told you you're one of his well if
[54:06] he told you that then it's settled
[54:08] forever amen you're my son see he can't
[54:11] come back and say I was wrong right
[54:15] glory amen somebody can choose you one
[54:18] day and un befriend you one day and
[54:19] unfriend you the
[54:21] next come on somebody we ain't got to go
[54:25] into Facebook and be every life friend
[54:27] you one day and unfriend you the next
[54:29] because of something but if God chose
[54:31] you before the foundation of the world
[54:33] he will not be
[54:36] wrong the devil can do what he wants to
[54:39] he can cover you up your sin he can
[54:41] cover you up with iniquity but if God
[54:44] chose you and I say he
[54:46] did you didn't get put here by accident
[54:49] you wasn't born into the family you're
[54:51] born in by accident but God pre-planned
[54:53] you before the foundation of the world
[54:56] and he's not changing his mind about you
[55:04] now if God makes a decision in the
[55:08] beginning if we believe his word he will
[55:11] make every promise come true then God
[55:14] still is the infinite God to his promise
[55:16] he cannot fail it must be that
[55:19] way you have to hit the
[55:22] spot if you take him at his word you
[55:25] will get there to the Fulfillment of the
[55:28] promise may take 25 years may take
[55:32] longer than what you want may take
[55:34] beyond what you even thought or how you
[55:35] thought it was going to be or how it was
[55:37] going to come to pass but if you'll just
[55:40] keep
[55:41] expecting believing God's go moving even
[55:45] when I don't see him he's
[55:48] working even when I don't know how it's
[55:50] going to happen or how all the parts are
[55:52] going to fall into place and the puzzle
[55:53] is going to come all together and it
[55:55] just seemed like one big mixed up W in a
[55:57] box right now and I don't know how it's
[55:59] going to take place but somehow God's
[56:01] got a
[56:03] plan you may have come come back to God
[56:06] and you feel like that you feel like
[56:07] your life is all muddled up and it's all
[56:10] messed up like a puzzle laying in a box
[56:11] and there's pieces laying everywhere but
[56:13] God has a plan he has a picture of you
[56:17] in his mind before the foundation of the
[56:19] world and the devil may have took that
[56:21] picture and shredded it all up but God
[56:23] knows how to put it back together he
[56:25] knows where every piece goes he knows
[56:27] every part of your life he knows how to
[56:29] put you back and to make you whole
[56:33] again he has a
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:42] plan some some people many ministers can
[56:45] say days of Miracles are passed even
[56:47] message ministers can say that I've
[56:50] heard
[56:51] them God doesn't heal people anymore but
[56:55] if God was ever called on the scene to
[56:58] to a sick man and healed him upon the
[56:59] basis of faith if another sick man comes
[57:02] to him he's got to do the same thing or
[57:04] he acted wrong the first
[57:08] time if you give one the holy ghost that
[57:10] obeyed him in the Bible exactly as he
[57:12] promised there in the book of Acts and
[57:14] he said the promises unto you and your
[57:15] children them that are far off even as
[57:17] many as the Lord Our God shall call if
[57:19] another man meets those same
[57:21] qualifications God is obligated by his
[57:24] word to fill him with the Holy Ghost
[57:26] because if he didn't he made a
[57:29] mistake and if God made a mistake he's a
[57:32] man and not God he's finite like we are
[57:36] but you see as Abraham's children we
[57:38] take God's promise and we hold on to it
[57:40] no matter what takes place we hold there
[57:42] just the same because God said so and
[57:45] it's finished it may not look like it's
[57:48] finished it may not look like it's done
[57:51] we sing the song all the time it's
[57:52] already done that is a statement of
[57:54] faith believe what God Said is going to
[57:58] be finished we may not see it with our
[57:59] eyes right now but by faith I see it
[58:02] already done by faith I see the promises
[58:06] already fulfilled by faith I see my
[58:08] children sitting in church by faith I
[58:10] see myself healed by faith I see myself
[58:17] saved it's got to be by
[58:20] faith Abraham believed that he believed
[58:22] God and took God his word and under
[58:24] expectations
[58:26] he waited 25 years with that expectation
[58:32] getting greater and
[58:36] greater and finally the baby was born
[58:40] because he was expecting
[58:47] it so where they get the term expected
[58:50] mother she's expecting to have a
[58:55] child we're expecting to have a body
[58:59] change we're expecting for prodal to
[59:02] come home we're exp we're expecting
[59:05] cancer to be
[59:07] defeated not hoping we're expecting by
[59:10] faith it's a revelation by God given to
[59:13] us by God that God has in his word and
[59:15] his word cannot fail therefore we are
[59:17] under expectation to see these things
[59:20] fulfilled I'm expecting young people to
[59:23] come back changed and different and
[59:24] delivered and set free and on fire for
[59:27] God can we not expect that even like
[59:30] Tabernacle we ain't sitting them up on a
[59:32] bus to just go have a good time we're
[59:34] sending up up there to receive the Holy
[59:37] Ghost and let me tell you something you
[59:39] ain't got to you ain't got to wait to
[59:40] get on a bus to get it you can get it
[59:42] tonight he's the same God tonight amen
[59:46] that can come according to how you
[59:48] expect him to
[59:50] come if you need Deliverance start
[59:53] expecting him to deliver you if you need
[59:55] salvation start expecting God's going to
[59:57] save me if you need God to put your
[1:00:00] marriage together start expecting God to
[1:00:02] do
[1:00:04] that we ain't sitting around twiddling
[1:00:07] our thumbs and just waiting no we're
[1:00:08] waiting under
[1:00:14] expectation expectation is actually a
[1:00:16] state of
[1:00:17] Readiness knowing that you're about to
[1:00:20] receive what you're looking for
[1:00:28] he said' but see God told him to
[1:00:29] separate
[1:00:31] himself from his all his Kindred he said
[1:00:34] God could never bless him till he obeyed
[1:00:35] fully and as long as his father hung and
[1:00:38] caused him trouble and lot caused
[1:00:40] trouble it wasn't until he separated
[1:00:42] himself and got away from all the
[1:00:44] unbelief and he shook away from all that
[1:00:47] then God came down and talked to him and
[1:00:49] something
[1:00:52] happened Hallelujah
[1:00:57] I was just going over some of the
[1:00:58] services there on YouTube of the last
[1:01:01] couple of
[1:01:02] camps and I remember watched the part
[1:01:05] brother Ben Ericson was leading service
[1:01:07] the first I think it was the first camp
[1:01:08] on Sunday morning he said he said I just
[1:01:11] thought I was going to just do a relaxed
[1:01:13] you know we had that long prayer line
[1:01:15] Saturday night so I thought we just have
[1:01:16] a
[1:01:17] relaxed uh relax song service and sing a
[1:01:21] few songs he said but said I had a real
[1:01:24] moment last night
[1:01:26] he just breaks up and all a sudden he
[1:01:29] just breaks
[1:01:30] forth of how God had delivered him and
[1:01:33] how God had set him free and begins to
[1:01:35] sing a song and the joy of God filled
[1:01:37] the building why because God came and
[1:01:41] changed his
[1:01:44] expectation God met him there at that
[1:01:48] moment and it changed everything listen
[1:01:51] God can meet you
[1:01:56] amen how many how many wants that how
[1:01:59] many wants a Moses
[1:02:01] moment to meet that Pillar of
[1:02:05] Fire how manyan wants that moment like
[1:02:08] even even David had to kill your Goliath
[1:02:11] and Samson had to grab something that
[1:02:14] seemed so insignificant and whoop down a
[1:02:16] thousand
[1:02:18] Philistines this is where we're at we're
[1:02:20] of the same race we're the same people
[1:02:22] so we should have the same expectation
[1:02:25] that's right
[1:02:29] he said and when we get all the little
[1:02:31] disbelieving Spirits away from us where
[1:02:34] we can really take God at his word and I
[1:02:37] don't care what so and so said or so and
[1:02:39] so does God made a promise and I'm going
[1:02:42] to stand right there on it then God will
[1:02:45] go to
[1:02:47] answering then God will go to answering
[1:02:49] remember he blessed him and he kept him
[1:02:51] so forth fed him led him from one place
[1:02:53] to another but he never fully blessed
[1:02:55] him and give the promise until he
[1:02:57] completely separated
[1:03:00] himself from every little thing of the
[1:03:03] world he let his nephew go down to Sodom
[1:03:07] he let the father his father his
[1:03:08] father-in-law or father died then God
[1:03:11] told him rise and look at the land and
[1:03:12] I'll give it to look East North West
[1:03:14] South think that I think that's the way
[1:03:16] if a church a people ever comes to a
[1:03:19] place where they completely separate
[1:03:21] themselves from the things of the world
[1:03:23] then you can look through every promise
[1:03:25] in the Bible it's all
[1:03:28] yours it's like a great big arcave by
[1:03:31] one Spirit were baptized into it some
[1:03:34] people just come down by the Holy Ghost
[1:03:36] baptism and say Well thank the Lord I
[1:03:37] got in thank the Lord I'm here that
[1:03:39] isn't it amen get up and go through all
[1:03:41] the land it all belongs to you that's
[1:03:44] the way when I come into Christ I want
[1:03:46] to look around I want to know how he
[1:03:47] saved me I don't know I want to know
[1:03:49] where he's taking me to that's the way
[1:03:51] it is with Christians today they fail to
[1:03:53] examine every promise that is there it
[1:03:56] is all
[1:03:59] yours but be expecting
[1:04:04] it healing is
[1:04:07] yours salvation is yours Joy is yours
[1:04:12] peace is yours amen every promise in the
[1:04:15] Bible is yours and when a man's filled
[1:04:17] with the Holy Spirit God gave him a
[1:04:19] checkbook amen with Jesus name wrote on
[1:04:21] the bottom of it fill it out don't be
[1:04:24] afraid to write it it out send it in
[1:04:26] he'll send down the Bountiful blessings
[1:04:28] upon you what he
[1:04:38] promised Moses again going back to him
[1:04:41] he's like Lord seemed like you forgot
[1:04:44] about it it's been 400 years but he
[1:04:46] comes into this Burning
[1:04:48] Bush and he hears a voice says I've
[1:04:51] heard their
[1:04:52] cries I've seen their afflictions
[1:04:55] I have come down to deliver them and I'm
[1:04:59] sending you Moses you go tell Pharaoh
[1:05:02] let my people
[1:05:04] go he has seen your
[1:05:09] suffering
[1:05:11] hello well nobody knows what I'm going
[1:05:13] through he has seen your
[1:05:16] suffering he has seen the doctor say I
[1:05:19] can't do no
[1:05:22] more and he'll come down in the form of
[1:05:24] the Holy Spirit to take over if you'll
[1:05:27] let him be expecting him to do that be
[1:05:30] expecting him to do that knowing that he
[1:05:32] promised to do it hold on to his word he
[1:05:34] said he would do it therefore be
[1:05:36] expecting
[1:05:39] it Simeon a man of great
[1:05:42] reputation old sage sitting there had a
[1:05:44] great reputation among the people he was
[1:05:47] an H honorable
[1:05:49] man you imagine an old man about 80

[1:05:56] until I see the Lord's
[1:05:59] Christ you can imagine some of the
[1:06:02] rabbis saying you know that poor little
[1:06:04] fell is just pitiful he can't even

[1:06:16] 4,000 years for the Messiah and he's
[1:06:18] going to see him before he
[1:06:20] dies huh that's the way they look at us
[1:06:23] when they say we're going to have when
[1:06:24] we say we're going to have a body
[1:06:27] change when we say the Rapture is going
[1:06:29] to take place when we say the dead in
[1:06:32] Christ is going to
[1:06:33] rise when we say we're going to be those
[1:06:35] that are alive and remain they look at
[1:06:37] us like we're
[1:06:38] crazy amen that is where it was you know
[1:06:41] I mean goodness Sime and since Eden our
[1:06:43] people have look for the Messiah and

[1:07:27] and you will receive
[1:07:28] it if you meet it according to what what
[1:07:32] he has required God is required to
[1:07:34] answer
[1:07:35] [Applause]
[1:07:39] back Simeon knew it was going to
[1:07:42] happen some of them young rabbis yeah
[1:07:45] just leave him alone he's harmless he
[1:07:46] won't hurt nobody but he's just going
[1:07:48] around
[1:07:50] testifying he's going to see this and do
[1:07:52] that going to live to see the Messiah
[1:07:56] well s what why you reason what what
[1:07:58] makes you say such a thing when David
[1:08:01] looked for him and Elijah looked for him
[1:08:03] and Prophets of all we've looked through
[1:08:05] for and forever age and now days of
[1:08:07] Miracles are passed and everything's
[1:08:09] darkened out 400 years since we had a
[1:08:12] prophet Malachi was here you know and
[1:08:15] and you you're coming to say you're not
[1:08:16] going to die until you see the Messiah
[1:08:18] how you going for I had been it has been
[1:08:20] revealed to me by the Holy Ghost that's
[1:08:23] right this was his foundation
[1:08:26] it has been revealed to me by the Holy
[1:08:28] Ghost this must be your
[1:08:32] foundation your foundation cannot be
[1:08:35] your daddy or your mama or anything else
[1:08:38] or your foundation can't be some kind of
[1:08:39] medical reasonings or medical ideas or
[1:08:42] or psychology that cannot be your
[1:08:44] foundation your foundation has to be the
[1:08:47] Holy
[1:08:51] Ghost there's his
[1:08:54] foundation when the the Holy Spirit
[1:08:56] reveals it to you and it's according to
[1:08:57] the word there's nothing going to stop
[1:08:59] it that's hello somebody there's nothing
[1:09:03] going to stop it when it's revealed to
[1:09:05] you by the Holy Spirit and you look here
[1:09:06] and it's promised in the word now you
[1:09:08] can have all kind of
[1:09:10] ideas and say well the Lord spoke to me
[1:09:12] but if it ain't in the word it wasn't
[1:09:14] the
[1:09:15] Lord I found a lot of people can make
[1:09:17] God the biggest
[1:09:20] liar you get what I'm saying well the
[1:09:22] Lord told me this and the Lord told me
[1:09:23] this and the Lord told me this and the
[1:09:25] Lord never does what they say he's going
[1:09:26] to
[1:09:27] do somebody's
[1:09:30] lying and I got my Su suspicions who it
[1:09:33] really is cuz I know God doesn't lie if
[1:09:37] he says it's going to happen it's going
[1:09:39] to happen and if you have been in that
[1:09:41] situation where you said the Lord's
[1:09:43] going to do this and it ain't happen you
[1:09:44] need to
[1:09:45] repent say God I'm sorry for lying amen
[1:09:49] why because amen because why God ises
[1:09:51] not a
[1:09:52] liar what he says he will do
[1:10:00] people have been revealed for years that
[1:10:02] you know different years what night and
[1:10:04] this this year the Lord's coming the
[1:10:05] Lord spoke to me and this is the year
[1:10:07] and it goes by and it don't happen you
[1:10:09] think they repented no they come up with
[1:10:11] another
[1:10:15] year well the Lord said this is going to
[1:10:17] be this way and the Lord said that and
[1:10:18] it don't ever happen and it goes by and
[1:10:21] it didn't happen instead of repenting
[1:10:23] they come up with other ideas of what
[1:10:24] the Lord said
[1:10:29] if God made the promise though you got
[1:10:32] to stay there no matter what the
[1:10:33] circumstances
[1:10:35] areen if you say well I got cancer I got
[1:10:37] TB it that doesn't have nothing to do
[1:10:39] with it if God reveals to you you're
[1:10:41] going to be healed you stay there God
[1:10:44] keeps every
[1:10:48] promise he said you know there's Jonah
[1:10:50] in the belly of the
[1:10:53] well he said you talking about symptoms
[1:10:56] he had a lot of symptomss he had a real
[1:10:58] case of symptoms he was in the whale's
[1:11:00] belly with his hands and feet tied and
[1:11:02] down in the belly of that well and a
[1:11:04] bunch of vomit at the bottom of a stormy
[1:11:07] sea now he had a lot of symptoms but if
[1:11:09] you looked this way it was whale's belly
[1:11:12] he looked this way it was wh's belly
[1:11:14] vomit
[1:11:16] everywhere he said there's nobody here
[1:11:18] in that bad a shape I don't think but
[1:11:21] you know what he said they are nothing
[1:11:22] but ly vanities that's right amen I
[1:11:26] won't believe them what did he say once
[1:11:28] more will I look to your Holy Temple and
[1:11:31] pray cuz there had been a promise given
[1:11:33] If my people look to this Holy Temple
[1:11:35] and pray they'll hear from the Lord and
[1:11:38] so he had a promise and so he knew it'
[1:11:40] been on that dedication day that Solomon
[1:11:43] dedicated said Lord if th people be in
[1:11:45] trouble anywhere and look towards this
[1:11:47] Holy Temple they will hear from heaven
[1:11:50] and he knew God heard that man's prayer
[1:11:53] and he had faith in it and he was
[1:11:54] expecting God to move amen maybe the
[1:11:57] fish had taken down to the bottom of the
[1:11:59] bottom of the ocean but he was expecting
[1:12:01] God to do something because he had met
[1:12:04] every
[1:12:06] requirement come on somebody God had
[1:12:09] made the promise and he believe it and
[1:12:11] if Jonah under those circumstances could
[1:12:14] have a miracle work like that because
[1:12:16] God Amen from God because it was
[1:12:18] according to his word how much more
[1:12:20] could he do for you if he promised he's
[1:12:23] a Healer he's a deler deler he's a
[1:12:26] satisfier he's a joy Giver he's
[1:12:29] everything that you have need of and so
[1:12:31] much
[1:12:38] more he said how much more can you
[1:12:41] call any kind of disease a lying
[1:12:47] vanity I don't believe
[1:12:52] it sister Jeanie told me one day she
[1:12:55] said I want what I have addressed as
[1:13:00] defeated I don't even want to call it
[1:13:02] cancer I want to call it
[1:13:05] defeated cuz that's truly its
[1:13:09] name come on that'll cause you to look
[1:13:11] at something a lot different won't it
[1:13:13] cancer I don't know sugar diabet
[1:13:19] defeated back broken Calvary just a
[1:13:23] bluff has no abilities whatsoever ever
[1:13:25] unless God has allowed it to happen so
[1:13:28] and if God allows it then it's God's
[1:13:29] will but God also has a will and it's
[1:13:33] his word and his word said by his
[1:13:35] stripes I'm
[1:13:37] Healed so therefore I can look at what I
[1:13:40] have it's not and not call it by the
[1:13:42] name the devil or the doctor wants to
[1:13:44] give it cancer or this that and the
[1:13:45] other some some some name I'm not even
[1:13:48] concerned about that there's only one
[1:13:49] name for the
[1:13:53] devil come on one name for for the devil
[1:13:57] defeated one name for the devil defeated
[1:14:00] one name for the devil defeated amen if
[1:14:03] you look at your enemy as not some big
[1:14:05] giant but a defeated giant if you look
[1:14:08] at cancer not as some big thing but a
[1:14:10] defeated
[1:14:11] thing come on and it allow your
[1:14:14] expectation to build up and your faith
[1:14:16] to rise up that if it's defeated already
[1:14:19] then why do I have to fear it I don't
[1:14:21] have to fear something like that God has
[1:14:23] given me the victory over it God has
[1:14:25] given me peace in the middle of my
[1:14:27] battle that he's going to take care of
[1:14:29] me and I can have this expectation he
[1:14:32] will
[1:14:33] move he will touch he will
[1:14:39] heal what if it don't happen right now
[1:14:42] it'll happen after a while that's right
[1:14:45] if it don't happen today it'll happen
[1:14:47] tomorrow if it don't happen tomorrow
[1:14:48] it'll be next
[1:14:51] week whenever it's going to happen God
[1:14:54] knows cuz God says so there you are now
[1:14:59] you're getting down to where you have
[1:15:03] faith
[1:15:04] hello now you're getting down to where
[1:15:07] you have faith be expecting it what God
[1:15:11] said he would do God will
[1:15:22] do expectations
[1:15:25] whatever you expect is usually what you
[1:15:29] get if you don't expect anything out of
[1:15:31] a service you're not getting nothing out
[1:15:33] of a service if you expect to find fault
[1:15:37] you'll find it if you expect to find
[1:15:40] mistakes yep devil show you
[1:15:43] mistakes he said you heard about a lady
[1:15:45] that prayed for the mountain to be moved
[1:15:47] and got up the next morning looked out
[1:15:48] the window and said just as I expected
[1:15:50] still there
[1:15:56] that's the reason it's still there cuz
[1:15:59] that what that's what she was expecting
[1:16:01] for it to be this quote said you want to
[1:16:05] have an expectation all the way from the
[1:16:07] heart soul body and mind that God is
[1:16:09] going to give you an outpouring of the
[1:16:11] Holy Spirit I feel it it is near us and
[1:16:14] God is willing and ready to give it if
[1:16:16] you expect it that's what you shall
[1:16:21] receive maybe you didn't have no
[1:16:23] expectations getting on this bus but may
[1:16:25] God give you something
[1:16:27] tonight maybe it just Chang say Lord
[1:16:30] lift up my expectations maybe I ain't
[1:16:32] expecting
[1:16:35] enough cuz if I'm going to get what I
[1:16:38] expect I want to expect a
[1:16:41] lot cuz God's
[1:16:43] unlimited he's not just handing out
[1:16:45] little portions here and little portions
[1:16:47] there and little portions here and
[1:16:48] little portions there we get this idea
[1:16:49] that he's the only guy no he's
[1:16:52] unlimited so if you want I be under
[1:16:56] expectation that I'm going to get a
[1:16:58] great outpouring of the Holy Spirit how
[1:17:01] many young people want to expect
[1:17:04] that I'm going to get a great outpouring
[1:17:07] of the Holy Spirit now hold up a minute
[1:17:10] some of you ain't getting on the bus but
[1:17:12] that don't mean you can't lift your
[1:17:14] hands is that what you're
[1:17:17] expecting how how many just open it up
[1:17:20] to the whole floor how many is expecting
[1:17:22] to get a great outpour of the Holy
[1:17:24] Spirit
[1:17:27] how many's Desiring that how many's
[1:17:29] wanting that how many's longing for that
[1:17:32] how many's looking for
[1:17:35] that man if we'll come under that
[1:17:37] expectation sometimes you wonder you
[1:17:39] know when as a song leader you get up
[1:17:40] and from the word go man man the power
[1:17:43] of God's moving songs are going just
[1:17:45] right the specials are lining up just
[1:17:47] right and the power of God comes down
[1:17:48] and just moves and then you can come and
[1:17:50] sing the same songs and do all the same
[1:17:52] things or sing a different song doesn't
[1:17:54] matter what you do bang your head
[1:17:55] against the pull pit and people just sit
[1:17:57] there and look at you I found out I
[1:17:59] really believe it's
[1:18:02] expectations it's a spirit of
[1:18:05] expectation and it comes and it gets a
[1:18:08] hold of us and you might be just getting
[1:18:10] up on a Sunday morning and all of a
[1:18:11] sudden something starts moving on the
[1:18:12] inside of you man God's going to do
[1:18:14] something today I never forget just
[1:18:16] right out here in the dirt amen was
[1:18:18] pushing dirt brother Wayne said the Holy
[1:18:20] Spirit comeing upon him on the Dozer and
[1:18:22] said I'm going to do something
[1:18:23] significant tonight he said he just
[1:18:25] began to expect it he quit worrying
[1:18:27] about needing to study quit worrying
[1:18:29] about what he was going to preach and
[1:18:30] quit worrying about everything cuz God
[1:18:32] said I'm going to do something
[1:18:35] significant I said well I ain't never
[1:18:37] heard that kind of voice well you've
[1:18:38] read the word where he said I'll be
[1:18:40] there where two or three are gathered
[1:18:43] what if he's here he's here to do
[1:18:44] something significant he's here to move
[1:18:47] he's here to touch he's here to heal
[1:18:49] he's here to deliver he's here to fill
[1:18:51] with the Holy Ghost he he's here to save
[1:18:53] he he's here to bring you out out of the
[1:18:55] darkness of this life and into the light
[1:18:57] of the word he's here to move on your
[1:19:04] behalf why can't we have that
[1:19:06] expectation every service God's going to
[1:19:10] do something significant
[1:19:14] today we saw what God
[1:19:18] did we saw him give strength to a woman
[1:19:21] that had a brain bleed and couldn't
[1:19:23] hardly stand on her two on two feet be
[1:19:26] be led into a prayer line and God move
[1:19:28] on her on her life and she raised her
[1:19:30] hands for another two hours standing
[1:19:31] over there on the side of that old
[1:19:33] church and with their hands raised up in
[1:19:35] the air giving praise to God we saw a
[1:19:37] little boy come up being covered up with
[1:19:39] hundreds of warts and just a few moments
[1:19:41] all those warts were
[1:19:43] gone we saw expectations of a little 16y
[1:19:47] old girl what did those expectations
[1:19:49] bring what did it provide what what did
[1:19:51] it produce amen I want my brother back I
[1:19:54] I want him serving God and within a few
[1:19:56] minutes of her expectation here he
[1:20:00] come come on somebody God is going will
[1:20:03] move according to our
[1:20:06] expectation amen so we shouldn't worry
[1:20:08] about what's this and what's that and
[1:20:09] what's going on and get caught up in all
[1:20:11] the the ups and downs but just look at
[1:20:14] what God can
[1:20:16] do if he can heal today or if he healed
[1:20:19] yesterday he can heal today if he saved
[1:20:22] yesterday he can save today if he put
[1:20:24] families back together back then he can
[1:20:26] put families back together today if he
[1:20:28] brought prodical home then he can bring
[1:20:30] prodical home today if God is still the
[1:20:32] same yesterday today and forever so we
[1:20:35] can have the same expectation that God's
[1:20:38] going to move that God's going to touch
[1:20:40] hearts that God's going to change
[1:20:43] lives that God's going to set people on
[1:20:45] fire for his glory and for his honor and
[1:20:48] the Holy Ghost can be poured out Upon
[1:20:50] Our Lives let him fall in this service
[1:20:52] oh God
[1:20:59] expectations what it begins to do and I
[1:21:01] ain't got time to get all into it but it
[1:21:03] actually under expectations it actually
[1:21:06] changes the
[1:21:12] atmosphere if you're expecting a bad
[1:21:15] time you're probably going to have a bad
[1:21:17] time but if you're expecting something
[1:21:20] wonderful something
[1:21:23] good ever heard that song I just feel
[1:21:25] like something Good's about to
[1:21:28] happen I do too I just feel like
[1:21:32] something good is on his
[1:21:34] way how about let's have a bus trip on
[1:21:37] the way up there like we do on the way
[1:21:38] back
[1:21:41] that's let's change them
[1:21:45] expectations giving praise to God and
[1:21:48] Thanksgiving that God's allowed me to be
[1:21:51] called in this generation in these
[1:21:54] moments in these closing moments of time
[1:21:56] to be his son to be his daughter to be a
[1:21:59] young person in this message that can
[1:22:00] hold a banner
[1:22:02] high and wave it and give God praise no
