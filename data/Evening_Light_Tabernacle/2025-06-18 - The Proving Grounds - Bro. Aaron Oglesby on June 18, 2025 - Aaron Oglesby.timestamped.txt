[34:39] evening? Amen. He certainly deserves all
[34:43] the worship, all the praise, all the
[34:46] glory and honor that we could ever give
[34:48] him.
[34:49] I just like to say this. He deserves it
[34:50] here tonight. But he deserves it a lot
[34:52] more than just when we gather here. He
[34:55] deserves a life that praises him each
[34:57] and every single day. It don't mean a
[34:59] whole lot if you praise him here, but
[35:01] tomorrow your life don't praise him. I
[35:04] want my life to praise him every day.
[35:06] Lord, every place I fall short, cover it
[35:08] in your blood. Just Lord, let me be more
[35:10] dedicated. Let me be more consecrated.
[35:12] Let my life testify of a living God in
[35:16] this name. Amen. Can we pray together
[35:18] tonight? Father, how grateful we are,
[35:21] Lord. Lord, for your presence, for this
[35:23] atmosphere that's been created, Lord.
[35:25] Lord, we feel you here even now moving,
[35:27] Lord. Lord, even when we don't feel you,
[35:29] I'm so grateful that your word declares
[35:31] that you're here, Lord. And that's where
[35:32] our trust is. And Lord, I'm just
[35:34] trusting tonight, Lord, that you'll
[35:36] speak, Lord. That Lord, that your your
[35:38] word will be elevated, Father, to its
[35:40] rightful place. Because truly, Lord,
[35:41] that that is, Lord God, our our our
[35:44] absolute is your word tonight. Lord, I'm
[35:47] just asking you'll come and move me out
[35:48] of the way and I just allow you to speak
[35:50] tonight to your people, Father. Lord, I
[35:52] pray that your people will be encouraged
[35:54] and lifted up, Lord, for the battles and
[35:56] the trials that lie ahead. Because
[35:57] truly, Lord, we know, Lord, that as we
[36:00] near the very end of time, it's not
[36:02] going to get easier, Father. But the
[36:04] devil's going to do more and more. But
[36:05] I'm thankful tonight. And I have a
[36:06] promise, Lord, that when he comes in
[36:08] like a flood, you're raising up a
[36:10] standard against him. Father, we look to
[36:12] that standard tonight, Lord. We just ask
[36:14] you to have your way in this service
[36:16] now. Anoint the reading of the word,
[36:18] Lord. Anoint me, anoint the ears of the
[36:20] listener, and have your way. I pray,
[36:21] Father, in Jesus name. Amen and amen.
[36:26] Amen. God bless you tonight. Ain't it
[36:28] good to be in the house of God tonight?
[36:31] Amen. And if if you have your Bibles
[36:34] with you and you'd turn with me tonight
[36:36] to the book of Romans,
[36:38] the eth chapter. The book of Romans, the
[36:40] eth chapter. I'd like to speak to you
[36:42] tonight for a moment on on the thought
[36:45] of the proving grounds.
[36:47] The proving grounds. Amen.
[36:52] Romans 8:17. We'll read two verses here
[36:54] and then we'll also look in first Peter
[36:56] 1 and3.
[36:58] says in verse 17 it says, "And if
[37:02] children
[37:03] then hes of God and joints with Christ,
[37:07] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[37:10] may also may be also glorified together.
[37:14] For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[37:16] present time are not worthy to be
[37:18] compared with the glory which shall be
[37:21] revealed in us." Also in first Peter 1
[37:25] and verse three, we'll read down through
[37:27] verse seven. It says, ' Blessed be the
[37:30] God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[37:33] which according to his abundant abundant
[37:35] mercy hath begotten us again unto a
[37:37] lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[37:39] Christ from the dead, to an inheritance
[37:42] incorruptible and undefiled, and that
[37:45] fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for
[37:47] you, who are kept by the power of God
[37:50] through faith unto salvation, ready to
[37:52] be revealed in the last time, wherein ye
[37:55] greatly rejoice, though now for a
[37:58] season. Now, notice the way the way
[37:59] these two scriptures go. Uh where it
[38:02] says, "Wherein greatly rejoice," it's
[38:04] referring back to verse 5. Okay? You're
[38:08] kept by the power of God through faith
[38:09] unto salvation, ready to be revealed in
[38:12] the last time, wherein you greatly
[38:13] rejoice. But then it says, "Though now
[38:16] for a season,
[38:18] if need be, you are in heaviness through
[38:20] manifold temptation, that the trial of
[38:23] your faith being much more precious than
[38:25] of gold that perisheth, though it be
[38:28] tried with fire, might be found under
[38:30] praise and honor and glory at the
[38:32] peering of Jesus Christ." Amen. I pray
[38:35] that the Lord will add his blessings now
[38:36] as we take our seats this evening.
[38:39] Amen. Ain't it good to be a Christian?
[38:42] It sure is. You know, we look around, if
[38:44] you're paying attention at all, the the
[38:46] world is on the verge of World War II
[38:48] and there's missiles falling from the
[38:50] skies all over the world. And, you know,
[38:53] you may say, "Well, there's always been
[38:54] wars and there's always been these
[38:55] things, but it kind of matters who it is
[38:57] in the war." Okay? Uh, it's kind of a I
[39:00] feel like I lost sound. Let's not do
[39:02] that. Um I I feel like that, you know,
[39:05] that we're on the precipice of things
[39:07] that we need to be making our calling
[39:09] and election sure. You know, as brother
[39:12] Tim dealt with it on on Sunday, you
[39:14] know, it is the combines are coming and
[39:16] and and I believe with all my heart, I
[39:18] I'll never stand up here and believe
[39:20] that any of us are tears or any of us
[39:22] are anything but weed. I just want to
[39:24] encourage us even tonight as we look
[39:26] into this knowing where we stand. Check
[39:28] up. Just check up. I mean, all of us
[39:31] should do that. That's not to anybody
[39:32] else. I I in my heart check up. You
[39:34] know, is is there anything? And and as
[39:36] we look into the word tonight, I want to
[39:38] start with this quote where brother
[39:39] Brandham says, "The cloudy skies and
[39:42] storms of life are no signs of God's
[39:44] disapproval."
[39:45] He says, "His approval of us," and he
[39:49] also says, "Neither are bright skies and
[39:51] still waters signs of his love and
[39:53] approval. His approval of any of us is
[39:56] only in the beloved. His love is
[39:59] elective which he had for us before the
[40:02] foundation of the world. Does he love
[40:05] us?
[40:07] Ah yes. But how shall we know? We shall
[40:11] know because he said so
[40:15] and manifested that he did love us. For
[40:18] he brought us to himself and gave us of
[40:20] his spirit placing us as sons. And how
[40:23] shall I prove my love to him? So first
[40:26] of all, how do we know he loves us? He
[40:29] said so. That settles it. Well, now how
[40:32] do I prove my love? Is it through my
[40:34] works and all my efforts and everything
[40:35] that I No, no, no. He says
[40:39] by believing what he said.
[40:43] And here's the harder one. And by
[40:47] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[40:50] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[40:54] come to pass.
[40:56] believe what he said and conduct oursel
[40:58] with joy in the midst of the trials that
[41:01] he allows to come to pass. Now remember,
[41:04] I want say it again before we go on.
[41:06] We're speaking on the proving grounds
[41:07] tonight. And and I think it's important
[41:09] that we keep this in mind, this quote a
[41:13] as we go through the daily ups and downs
[41:15] of life. Because I don't care who you
[41:17] are here tonight, you have ups and you
[41:20] have downs. We have good days and we
[41:22] have bad days. Sometimes we may have
[41:24] good months and good years and bad
[41:26] months and bad years. That's just the
[41:27] reality of of life. But we're going to
[41:29] go through these things. But fortunately
[41:32] for us as Christians, we have an anchor.
[41:35] When when life is tossed to and fro,
[41:38] when ups and downs, when the bank ain't
[41:39] right, when the job ain't right, when
[41:41] family struggling, we have an anchor
[41:43] that holds no matter what. We're not
[41:46] tossed in to fro. You know, I think
[41:48] about it sometimes. You know, people in
[41:50] the world go through trials just like we
[41:52] go through trials. But the difference
[41:54] between us and them is not that we don't
[41:56] have trials. It's that we have an anchor
[41:57] that holds in the midst of that storm.
[42:00] Amen. So, so as Christians tonight, we
[42:03] we have an absolute that never changes
[42:06] regardless of the situation that we're
[42:09] in. Regardless of your circumstance
[42:12] tonight, he is still God. He is still
[42:15] God tonight for you. And and so my joy
[42:18] tonight should not be determined by how
[42:21] my day went. Our joy should not be
[42:24] determined even how how life is going
[42:26] for us in general. Oh, we don't judge
[42:29] our salvation or our standing with God
[42:31] based on the fact that things are going
[42:33] really good for me right now. God must
[42:36] be pleased with me. Think things are
[42:38] going really good or or God must be
[42:40] upset at me because things are falling
[42:42] apart all around me. That's no sign,
[42:46] Brother Brandham says, of God's
[42:48] disapproval. Well, well, how do I know
[42:51] tonight, Brother Aaron, that God loves
[42:53] me if it's not those things? We know
[42:55] because he said so. And not only did he
[42:59] say it, but he goes on to the next part.
[43:01] But then he manifested it to us. He
[43:05] manifested that love by coming and dying
[43:07] and giving his life for you and then
[43:10] sending back and filling you with that
[43:12] same Holy Spirit. Amen. And then he
[43:14] comes and he he fills you with the
[43:16] spirit and he places you as a son. Don't
[43:19] you love that? Because the the thing
[43:20] about that is it's because he said and
[43:22] it's because of election. So no
[43:24] situation, no circumstance, no storm of
[43:27] life can change the fact tonight that he
[43:30] loves you, that he died for you, that he
[43:32] sent his spirit back for you tonight.
[43:34] Nobody can take it away from you. The
[43:37] preacher don't like you, don't matter.
[43:39] God loves me. People in the church don't
[43:41] like me, don't matter. God loves me. You
[43:44] can't lose that tonight. No trial can
[43:47] change it. No devil can change it. It is
[43:50] by election tonight. God said it. He
[43:53] cannot unchoose you. He can't take his
[43:55] love back from you. You are a recipient
[43:58] tonight of the elective love of Jesus
[44:00] Christ. Hallelujah.
[44:04] Oh. So, how do we know?
[44:08] He said so.
[44:10] and he has proven over and over and over
[44:13] again that his word is true. Rest your
[44:17] soul tonight on what his word is. Look,
[44:19] I'm going to tell you, you can't rest it
[44:21] on a man. You can't rest it on me. I
[44:25] might tell you something with in great
[44:27] intentions.
[44:29] And then forget.
[44:33] You can't rest it on on any minister.
[44:36] You can't rest it on the government. I
[44:39] don't care who the president is, that
[44:40] better not be what you're resting on
[44:42] tonight. But the King of Kings and the
[44:45] Lord of Lords said, "I love you. I gave
[44:48] my life for you. I'm not going to leave
[44:50] you down there in Leodosia, but I'm
[44:53] coming back for you. You can rest on
[44:55] that tonight." Hallelujah.
[45:00] Thank you, Lord Jesus. His word is true.
[45:03] And it's true on your good days. His
[45:05] word is true on your bad days. It's true
[45:08] when you're well and it's true when
[45:10] you're sick because your trial does not
[45:12] change who he is. Hear that tonight.
[45:16] Your trial does not change who he is
[45:18] right now. Regardless of where you're
[45:20] at, he is still the almighty. He is
[45:23] still the unfailing. He is still the
[45:25] healer. He is still your savior. And no
[45:27] matter what, he is always faithful and
[45:31] true.
[45:32] But another thing about trials I want to
[45:34] point out tonight is your trials don't
[45:37] change who you are.
[45:40] We always talk about it don't change who
[45:41] God is but it also don't change who you
[45:44] are. It It's time for us to to slow down
[45:48] for a minute. It's time for us to stop
[45:50] allowing temporary earthly conditions to
[45:54] affect the way that we view ourselves or
[45:57] even the way that we view others.
[46:00] temporary earthly things. And and quit
[46:02] placing so much value on earthly
[46:04] blessings or even earthly hardships
[46:08] or earthly positions or earthly social
[46:11] groups and social circles and friend
[46:13] groups and all that other nonsense
[46:17] and then use those things to devalue
[46:19] yourself.
[46:21] Well, they're special. That's the
[46:24] special group.
[46:26] They have a position. They're important.
[46:29] Things really work out good for them.
[46:31] They They must have the favor of God.
[46:34] They're so blessed. Look at how much
[46:36] they go and how much they do and look at
[46:39] how much they look Look at the
[46:43] I guess I'm a nobody around here. I
[46:46] guess I'm not good enough. We're just
[46:49] forgotten. Look, we could go on and on
[46:50] and on and on.
[46:53] I'm just forgotten around here. See, see
[46:56] the real truth is you you don't have
[46:58] issue with others. You have an issue
[47:00] with where your self-worth comes from.
[47:07] My selfworth and the way I feel about
[47:09] myself will never revolve around an
[47:11] invite.
[47:13] It'll never revolve around who wants to
[47:15] hang out with me and who don't want to
[47:17] hang out with me.
[47:19] what position I have or don't have or if
[47:21] I've preached once in six months or
[47:23] hadn't and got invited here, didn't get
[47:25] invited, my selfworth is not tied to any
[47:28] of that. So, it doesn't affect me.
[47:31] Doesn't affect me in any way. But if
[47:34] those things do affect you, let me try
[47:36] to cheer you up a little bit tonight and
[47:38] turn your attention to where your
[47:39] self-worth should come from. You are a
[47:43] child of God Almighty. You have been
[47:46] bought with a price. You are special.
[47:49] You are powerful. You are important. You
[47:52] are a segene of God. I don't care who
[47:55] hangs out, who don't hang out, who
[47:57] calls, who don't call. You're a segene
[47:59] of God. You're an overcomer. You're
[48:02] taking a rapture. You're an heir to all
[48:04] things. That's all that matters.
[48:07] Let's get our focus away from these
[48:09] temporary earthly things.
[48:12] They don't determine who you are, what
[48:15] you are. We are called and we are
[48:18] chosen. And it's time we start acting
[48:20] like we are called and we are chosen. We
[48:23] are the sons of God. It's time we act
[48:25] like we're the sons of God. Not
[48:27] forsaken, not forgotten, but one that
[48:30] the King of Kings shed his life for.
[48:34] Send a message for in this last day.
[48:38] Tried. Sure.
[48:40] Tested, sure.
[48:43] Hardships, absolutely.
[48:46] but victorious.
[48:48] Overcomers of the age.
[48:51] Second Corinthians 4 tells us we are
[48:53] troubled on every side. We sure are.
[48:57] Every side as individuals, as a church
[48:59] family, as a country, it don't matter.
[49:02] You look around. We're troubled on every
[49:03] side. But don't stop right there. Yet
[49:06] not distressed. We are perplexed but not
[49:09] in despair. Persecuted but not forsaken.
[49:12] Cast down but not destroyed. Why? Why?
[49:16] Because we have a word that says, "I'm
[49:18] not going to leave you or forsake you,
[49:20] but I'll be with you, even in you till
[49:23] the end." I'm telling you, we're near
[49:25] the end, but we ain't at it yet. So,
[49:27] he's still here. He's still with us.
[49:29] He's still protecting. He's still
[49:31] fighting. And when he does leave, we're
[49:34] going with him.
[49:36] Hallelujah.
[49:39] Glory to God.
[49:42] I love that he says that in the quote.
[49:43] How do we know that he loves us? He said
[49:46] so
[49:49] and he manifested it to us. In other
[49:53] words, he says it, then he proves it.
[49:58] God, and we're going to be a theme
[50:00] throughout this. God always proves his
[50:03] word.
[50:05] God always proves his word. And And what
[50:08] about us?
[50:10] How do we prove our love? Well, since
[50:13] we're elected and called and chosen, I
[50:15] guess we get off easy in a flowery bed
[50:17] of ease.
[50:18] No,
[50:20] you're going to have to prove your love
[50:22] by believing what he said. Even in the
[50:24] trial. All right. Even in the sickness,
[50:28] even when the child goes further away,
[50:30] even when the sickness gets worse, even
[50:33] when more friends turn their back,
[50:37] God on the mountain, God in the valley,
[50:41] believe what he says and having a good
[50:44] attitude about trials and tribulations
[50:47] he allows to come your way.
[50:49] In other words, he wants your attitude
[50:52] to reflect that the truth of Romans 8:18
[50:55] that these troubles aren't worthy enough
[50:58] to be counted with the glory that's
[51:00] being revealed in us.
[51:02] In other words, even on my bad day, that
[51:05] glory is still being revealed in me. So,
[51:07] that should be elevated higher than the
[51:10] trial and the tribulation that I'm
[51:12] currently facing right here. And he
[51:15] wants us to reflect that we recognize
[51:17] that that's more important. That we have
[51:19] something to shout about, that we have
[51:21] something to rejoice about. I know we
[51:23] have bad days. Listen, I'm not living
[51:25] with my head in the sand. I have bad
[51:26] days, too. But what I'm saying is that
[51:29] does not change who we are and how we
[51:32] worship and how we recognize we're
[51:34] blessed people. On a worst day, we're
[51:36] blessed. On a bad day, we're blessed.
[51:38] We're called and chosen. We don't have
[51:41] nothing to mope around about.
[51:43] All right. He wants you to recognize
[51:46] that these are troubles that don't
[51:48] change that you are a son of God. So why
[51:50] you sad? Tribulations that don't change
[51:53] the fact that you have eternal life. So
[51:55] why you down about it? I said I love
[51:58] you. Isn't that enough to rejoice in
[52:00] tonight? I said I'm coming back for you
[52:03] and my word's been proven true. Isn't
[52:05] that enough to make you lift your head
[52:07] up on a down day?
[52:10] Amen.
[52:11] He says, "Just believe what I've said
[52:14] and trust."
[52:16] And that's how we will be proven as true
[52:20] when we stand in faith on the promised
[52:22] word. But because these are testing
[52:24] times,
[52:26] that's what we're at. We're in testing
[52:28] times. These are proving times and these
[52:30] are the proving grounds.
[52:33] And because of that, we're going to go
[52:34] through things constantly.
[52:37] We're going to face trouble constantly.
[52:40] You're going to be tried every single
[52:43] day. Psalms 160 or 66:10 says, "For
[52:46] thou, oh God, has proved us." Thou hast
[52:50] tried us as silver is tried
[52:54] continually before it receives a stamp
[52:57] of approval as being sterling.
[53:00] It gets tried. There can be no
[53:01] impurities there. recognize sometimes
[53:04] that the things we go through and the
[53:05] the storms of life, it's not always that
[53:08] it's the devil stirring things up. A lot
[53:11] of times it's the it's the sandpaper of
[53:13] the master sculptor working on that last
[53:16] little place on the stone that needs to
[53:18] be smoothed out. And I don't know, maybe
[53:21] you like sandpaper, sir.
[53:24] But that's an awful feeling,
[53:28] but he wants to get it right. Yeah. And
[53:30] I say, "Lord, I may not like it. It may
[53:33] upset me. It may make my belly bitter.
[53:36] But whatever has to happen, whatever has
[53:39] to happen for me to be ready on that
[53:41] day." I know he says, "All things work
[53:42] together for good." And we we look at
[53:44] situations and go, "How is that good?
[53:46] How is that working for my good?" It's
[53:48] because you're still looking at it
[53:49] earthly and thinking it's supposed to
[53:51] work out for your earthly good. He ain't
[53:52] concerned about the earthly good. It's
[53:54] working out for your eternal good.
[53:57] Everything that you go through is making
[53:59] sure you end up there. That's what it's
[54:02] working towards. That's what it's all
[54:04] about. Hallelujah. He'll try you to make
[54:07] sure that you come out as pure gold.
[54:11] Hallelujah. We are in the proving
[54:13] grounds. But here's the thing. We found
[54:16] out with Job. He ain't scared for you to
[54:19] be tested.
[54:21] He's not afraid of that. He He wasn't
[54:23] scared that Job would fall. He knew the
[54:26] outcome of the trial before it ever came
[54:28] down in Job's life. He knew that Job had
[54:31] a sacrifice. Oh, hallelujah. He knew
[54:34] that Job was coming the way of the blood
[54:36] and that it would hold in the hour of
[54:38] temptation because that's what the blood
[54:41] does. And he knows tonight, look, you're
[54:43] not even working with a representation
[54:45] or a substitute. You're not under the
[54:47] blood of a woolly lamb or a bull or a
[54:50] goat, but you're under the blood of the
[54:52] Lord Jesus Christ, the sinless sacrifice
[54:55] that was accepted. The blood will hold
[54:58] in your temptation. The blood will hold
[55:00] in your trial. The blood will hold when
[55:02] the world's fallen apart. Let Jericho's
[55:05] walls crumble, but there was a scarlet
[55:07] thread hanging out the window that
[55:09] declared, "You're coming out and your
[55:11] family's coming out. You're going to be
[55:13] saved. Let the world crumble. We got a
[55:16] scarlet thread tonight. The blood of
[55:18] Jesus holds us in the hour of
[55:20] temptation.
[55:22] That's what the blood does. Hallelujah.
[55:25] He isn't afraid for his bride to be
[55:28] tested.
[55:30] Because he knows she is word. He knows
[55:33] that she is spiritfilled.
[55:36] And he knew the outcome of this proving
[55:38] before we ever went into the trial.
[55:39] Amen.
[55:42] He already knew
[55:45] earth where we're at is the proving
[55:49] ground. Brother Brown says this. He
[55:51] says, "Every son that cometh to God must
[55:53] first be chasened of God and tried,
[55:55] child trained. There's no exceptions.
[55:58] Every son that cometh and these
[56:00] afflictions are done are brought about
[56:02] to see what attitude you'll take." See,
[56:05] it's God on this proving ground. That's
[56:09] all earth is. He says, is the proving
[56:14] grounds where he's trying to prove you
[56:17] his
[56:19] all earth is is the proving grounds
[56:22] where he's trying to prove you.
[56:25] What is a proving ground?
[56:28] It says it's an environment that serves
[56:30] to demonstrate whether something really
[56:33] works,
[56:35] whether a promise is really true.
[56:39] And ever since the fall,
[56:42] we know when sin entered into the
[56:43] picture that there were there was a
[56:45] promise that was given. A promise of a
[56:47] cure, a a promise of redemption, a
[56:50] promise seed that would overcome and a
[56:53] life that would overcome the curse. And
[56:55] down through the Old Testament, there
[56:57] were glimpses of it. We would see great
[57:00] victories won by God's children. We we
[57:02] would see Job stand so strong and so
[57:05] sure. We we would see the Hebrew
[57:06] children in the fiery furnace and
[57:08] Abraham stand in faith. We would see
[57:11] characteristics of the promise as the
[57:14] seed move down through the ages, but
[57:16] also we we we would witness the
[57:19] characteristics of sin nature and they
[57:21] would rise up in lives as the curse
[57:23] would rear its head up time after time.
[57:26] So, so you would have a man like David
[57:28] who is a man after God's own heart. A
[57:31] man who would win mighty victories and
[57:33] even used as a type of Christ and and he
[57:35] would say, "Thy word have I hid in my
[57:37] heart that I might not sin against
[57:40] thee." And then yet he would fall to
[57:42] temptation with Basheba and then have
[57:44] her husband killed.
[57:47] So you could see characteristics of the
[57:49] promise as it moved down through these
[57:51] lives, but you would still see the
[57:53] characteristics of the fall,
[57:55] characteristics of sin. There were
[57:57] glimpses of the promise, hope of the
[58:00] promise, and even manifestations of the
[58:02] promise in portions,
[58:04] but the full inoculation had not yet
[58:07] come because there was still rule of the
[58:09] flesh, and there was there was still
[58:11] beast nature that was controlling. But
[58:13] Satan knew.
[58:16] Satan knew that the promised seed was
[58:18] coming because don't forget he was
[58:21] standing there when it was promised. All
[58:23] right? He heard it when it was said. And
[58:26] I will put enmity between thee and the
[58:28] woman and between thy seed and her seed.
[58:31] It shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[58:34] bruise his heel. So he knows that
[58:37] there's a seed coming and he's
[58:39] constantly trying to corner it. He's
[58:41] constantly trying to kill it and trying
[58:43] to wipe it out. So, so he slew Abel. So,
[58:46] he kills all the children there in Egypt
[58:48] and and and he destroys the prophets and
[58:50] then he kills all the children that
[58:52] there in in the days of Herod. He knew
[58:55] there was one coming and time after time
[58:57] when he would recognize characteristics,
[59:00] he would destroy it. All right? Or when
[59:02] he would see something that it could be
[59:03] or it could be an avenue that the
[59:05] promise would come, he would step in and
[59:07] he would destroy it.
[59:10] He would chase it and he would crush it
[59:12] and he would think, "I got it. I've
[59:15] stopped it."
[59:17] But thankfully, we can say tonight that
[59:19] promised seed could not be stopped. That
[59:21] promised word could not be stopped until
[59:23] one day it wasn't just a glimpse
[59:25] anymore. It wasn't just a characteristic
[59:27] anymore. It wasn't just a portion
[59:29] anymore. But Jesus Christ stepped forth
[59:32] in flesh. And he was all of those
[59:35] characteristics, all of those portions,
[59:37] all of the word, everything that the
[59:39] promise said it would be, all wrapped up
[59:42] in one human body. He was the promised
[59:45] Messiah. He was the promised word. And
[59:47] now he stood upon the earth. And a
[59:50] declaration is is made of who he is
[59:53] there at the river Jordan. This is my
[59:55] beloved son. And the spirit comes down
[59:58] to dwell in him. And then it begins a
[1:00:00] time of proving.
[1:00:03] It begins a proving time. And would this
[1:00:06] be the one that could live above the
[1:00:08] curse? Is this the one to bring
[1:00:10] redemption and restoration? Is this
[1:00:13] truly the promised seed?
[1:00:16] Because see, there's always a proving
[1:00:19] time to see if the seed is genuine.
[1:00:23] There's always a proving time. And and
[1:00:25] God never shies away from approving. He
[1:00:29] went into the wilderness and it held. He
[1:00:32] faced ridicule and it held. He went to
[1:00:36] Gethsemane and it held. He was spit on
[1:00:39] and it held. They pulled his beard out
[1:00:42] and it held. Listen, he could have
[1:00:44] turned away at any point. He could have
[1:00:46] called thousands of angels at any point.
[1:00:49] But he knew in order for you to stand
[1:00:51] the test. In order for you to make it,
[1:00:54] in order for it to hold down through the
[1:00:56] ages, it had to hold in this moment. It
[1:01:00] had to hold in his hour of temptation.
[1:01:02] It had to hold in his torment. Oh, he
[1:01:05] was beat and it held. He went to Calvary
[1:01:10] and it held with every sin of the world
[1:01:12] on his shoulders. Oh, listen. I want to
[1:01:14] tell you that's the same life that's on
[1:01:16] the inside of you tonight. In your
[1:01:18] trials, it's going to hold. When others
[1:01:21] walk away, it's going to hold. It's the
[1:01:23] same life that he sent back to you.
[1:01:26] Hallelujah. That life faced temptation
[1:01:28] and it won. It faced depression and it
[1:01:31] won. It faced suicide and it won. It
[1:01:34] faced being poor and outcast. It faced
[1:01:37] being deserted by friends. He faced it
[1:01:39] all and it held. He never wavered. But
[1:01:42] that life conquered it all. And that
[1:01:45] life is available to you tonight.
[1:01:48] Hallelujah.
[1:01:50] It faced it all and it held.
[1:01:53] Thank you, Jesus. That's the life we
[1:01:56] have on the inside of us tonight as we
[1:01:58] face the proving grounds. He was broken
[1:02:01] open so that we could be germatized.
[1:02:05] Prophet God says, "And Jesus had to be
[1:02:07] broken open there in order for that seed
[1:02:11] to let forth its life to water other
[1:02:14] seed
[1:02:17] that was coming." He says, "Oh, do you
[1:02:20] see it?" I think I'm speaking to a group
[1:02:22] of people tonight that see it, that
[1:02:24] recognize because of that. Because of
[1:02:26] who he was, because of what it did?
[1:02:29] Because he went to Calvary. Because he
[1:02:31] conquered death, hell, and the grave.
[1:02:33] Oh, don't stop at Calvary. We can't be
[1:02:35] here without Calvary. But what was
[1:02:37] Calvary? What was it? It was a
[1:02:39] preparation for the day of Pentecost.
[1:02:41] Cuz without Calvary, the spirit couldn't
[1:02:44] come back and water the other seeds that
[1:02:46] was coming.
[1:02:48] Hallelujah.
[1:02:50] That seed had to hold. That seed had to
[1:02:54] overcome and yet it had to be broken so
[1:02:57] that that overcoming life of that seed
[1:03:00] could then come on all of us.
[1:03:04] Hallelujah.
[1:03:05] All heaven was watching.
[1:03:09] All hell was watching
[1:03:11] to see if it would hold. It was proving
[1:03:14] time.
[1:03:16] Everyone was watching.
[1:03:18] Will he call the angels?
[1:03:23] Will he speak out? Will he lash out?
[1:03:25] Will he use his power?
[1:03:27] All of hell watching. He says the earth
[1:03:30] shook. He died until the sun would quit
[1:03:33] shining. He died until the stars refused
[1:03:36] to shine. He died until the earth was so
[1:03:38] black you could feel it. He died and
[1:03:40] went to the lowest regions of hell
[1:03:42] bearing our sins. You could go no deeper
[1:03:44] in hell than he went. You could not
[1:03:46] suffer harder than he suffered. You
[1:03:49] could not die dead than he died. But
[1:03:51] brother, on that first Easter morning,
[1:03:53] the toxin went to work. It broke the
[1:03:56] seals of death. It smashed the devil in
[1:03:58] the face. It rolled back the stone. And
[1:04:00] the son of God lived again, and he's
[1:04:02] alive forever more. The toxin worked.
[1:04:05] God put it on his own son to prove it
[1:04:07] that it would work. God has made flesh
[1:04:09] and dwelt among us. That's how God was
[1:04:11] in Christ. God come and took his toxin
[1:04:14] himself in a human body that he created
[1:04:16] himself the son of God. He lived in
[1:04:19] that. He took the toxin. But on Easter
[1:04:21] morning it proved that it held. I'm so
[1:04:26] glad it held. I'm so glad if it held
[1:04:29] then it holds now. I'm telling you the
[1:04:31] storms are raging all around us. But the
[1:04:33] anchor holds. The toxin holds. We're
[1:04:36] safe tonight from all storms. We're
[1:04:39] shielded in the arms of Jesus.
[1:04:42] Oh, the devil had always looked for that
[1:04:44] seed and now he found it.
[1:04:47] Like the old saying goes, be careful
[1:04:50] what you wish for. I love it. Says it
[1:04:54] smashed the devil in the face. It broke
[1:04:57] the chains of death. It brought liberty
[1:05:00] to the bound. Hallelujah. He says
[1:05:03] Satan's always looked for that seed. He
[1:05:05] knowed that seed would be the conqueror.
[1:05:07] He talks about Jesus coming in and the
[1:05:09] devil's trying to bluff him a little bit
[1:05:12] and he says, "You died as a sinner.
[1:05:16] You're in
[1:05:19] hell."
[1:05:22] True enough. But he wasn't going to stay
[1:05:24] long. He was only there to conquer. He
[1:05:27] was only there to prove it worked. He
[1:05:29] was only there so you wouldn't have to
[1:05:31] go there. He was only going to be there
[1:05:33] for a few minutes. Yes, I'm here, but I
[1:05:36] ain't staying long. I've come to take
[1:05:38] over. I've come to loose the captive.
[1:05:40] I've come to take the chains and the
[1:05:42] keys of death, hell in the grave.
[1:05:44] Hallelujah. I'm the blood. Hallelujah.
[1:05:47] The virgin born son of the living God
[1:05:50] whose blood is still wet on the cross.
[1:05:53] Hallelujah.
[1:05:54] It held.
[1:05:58] It held in the beating. It held on the
[1:06:00] cross. And it held in hell. And now hell
[1:06:04] is on earth. and Satan looks at you and
[1:06:06] says, "You're in hell."
[1:06:10] That's fine because we're bone of his
[1:06:12] bone and we're flesh of his flesh. And
[1:06:14] just as he conquered, we're only here to
[1:06:16] prove it works. We're only here to
[1:06:18] conquer. We're only here to take over.
[1:06:20] We ain't staying much longer. You can
[1:06:23] have this old filthy place. We're just
[1:06:26] here until he takes us out. And we've
[1:06:29] got a word. It won't be long now.
[1:06:32] Hallelujah.
[1:06:34] We're here to prove it works. He had a
[1:06:36] word that said, "I won't leave his soul
[1:06:39] in hell." And he trusted that word and
[1:06:41] it raised him up. And we're in hell
[1:06:43] today. But we got a word that says, "In
[1:06:46] a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, this
[1:06:48] mortal shall put on mortality. And I'm
[1:06:51] trusting it tonight. And it's going to
[1:06:53] raise me up out of hell. It already has.
[1:06:56] It's raised us to heavenly places. It's
[1:06:58] raised us above sin. It's raised us
[1:07:00] above doubts and fears tonight.
[1:07:03] Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] Conquering hell even as he conquered it.
[1:07:08] Glory.
[1:07:10] It was proving time.
[1:07:15] There wasn't enough devils in hell, in
[1:07:18] the darkest corner of hell that could
[1:07:20] keep him there. He had been inoculated
[1:07:24] by the same life and the same power that
[1:07:27] is available to you tonight.
[1:07:30] So what's that mean? There ain't enough
[1:07:32] devils can stop this bride. There ain't
[1:07:35] enough devils can stop this rapture. And
[1:07:37] if I go by the way of the grave, that
[1:07:39] don't matter. All hell can't keep me
[1:07:41] from rising. It's a proven seed. It's a
[1:07:44] certified seed. It's proven life.
[1:07:47] Prophet of God says there's nothing can
[1:07:49] keep me from rising. There ain't enough
[1:07:51] devils in hell can keep me from rising.
[1:07:53] There ain't enough nothing nowhere.
[1:07:55] There ain't enough nothing.
[1:07:58] I don't even know what that means, but I
[1:08:00] know it covers lots.
[1:08:04] There ain't enough nothing nothing
[1:08:05] nowhere
[1:08:07] to keep me from rising. I have the
[1:08:09] promise of God. I have the Holy Spirit.
[1:08:12] I got Zoe, God's eternal life resting in
[1:08:15] here. Listen, if you got it, turn away
[1:08:17] from your earthly troubles. Turn away
[1:08:19] from your earthly trials and realize
[1:08:21] there's nothing going to hold me here.
[1:08:24] And if you don't got it, it's available
[1:08:26] here in the house of God. There's a
[1:08:28] fountain open today in the house of
[1:08:29] David. Hallelujah.
[1:08:33] God proves his word.
[1:08:37] This is proven time once again.
[1:08:40] And it is not that it hasn't been proven
[1:08:43] down through other ages and in other
[1:08:45] people,
[1:08:47] but the two seeds or the two vines as it
[1:08:50] were had not reached full maturity in
[1:08:54] the other ages. So it was portions
[1:08:57] battling portions, portions overcoming
[1:09:00] portions or or very specific anointings
[1:09:02] poured out to fight very specific
[1:09:05] attacks.
[1:09:06] And God is not going to be outdone.
[1:09:11] So what I mean by that is in order for
[1:09:13] redemption to have fully taken effect.
[1:09:17] In order for it to have erased what
[1:09:19] Satan did in the garden, it has to fully
[1:09:22] counteract
[1:09:24] what happened there.
[1:09:26] Has to fully counteract it. In other
[1:09:29] words, let put like this. Eve fell
[1:09:33] in perfection.
[1:09:36] She was in perfection and she fell into
[1:09:39] chaos.
[1:09:40] Satan's word caused her to fall in a
[1:09:43] perfect place where there was no sin, no
[1:09:46] evil, no fear, no doubt, perfection
[1:09:51] created by the very hand of God.
[1:09:54] So in order to counteract that, God's
[1:09:57] bride must then stand and overcome in an
[1:10:02] Eden made by the perversion of Satan
[1:10:05] himself.
[1:10:08] And it'll show a complete full
[1:10:10] counteraction of what Satan was able to
[1:10:12] accomplish there in the garden. So in a
[1:10:14] world full of death and dying, in a
[1:10:17] world full of fear and confusion and sin
[1:10:19] and temptation, all the filth that hell
[1:10:22] can spew out in this day, there is going
[1:10:24] to be a bride who proves that she is
[1:10:27] true and that the work of redemption and
[1:10:30] restoration has been total and it has
[1:10:32] been complete. I'm telling you that you
[1:10:35] are standing in the ultimate proving
[1:10:38] grounds. You are standing in the final
[1:10:40] proving grounds. Satan can say, "Yeah,
[1:10:42] yeah, it held in this day and it held in
[1:10:44] that day and it held in that day. But
[1:10:46] what about in my Eden?" And God says,
[1:10:48] "I'm not afraid for this wordorn
[1:10:51] spiritfilled bride to be tried in your
[1:10:53] Eden. I know what she's made of. I know
[1:10:56] what I deposited on the inside of her.
[1:10:58] I've seen it conquer the grave. I've
[1:11:00] seen it conquer hell. I've seen it stand
[1:11:02] every test. You go ahead, Satan, and you
[1:11:05] blow your winds, but she will stand. and
[1:11:09] she will be proven true in the face of
[1:11:12] your Eden. Hallelujah.
[1:11:16] You are a part of those standing the
[1:11:19] ultimate test.
[1:11:23] So yes, you're going to have trials.
[1:11:27] Yes, this church and the bride worldwide
[1:11:30] will have trials and tribulations and
[1:11:33] attacks.
[1:11:36] We will have things we don't understand.
[1:11:38] Attacks from places we don't get. Why
[1:11:40] are they attacking us? Don't matter. Our
[1:11:43] job's just to stand.
[1:11:46] Our job's just to be true.
[1:11:49] And I don't mean to be negative,
[1:11:52] but it's not going to get easier.
[1:11:55] It's not supposed to get easier. Look at
[1:11:58] how that was proven with with Jesus.
[1:12:01] Every step got worse. from the agony in
[1:12:03] the garden to the beating to Calvary and
[1:12:06] finally death. Can it get any worse?
[1:12:07] Yes, he goes to hell. And as we get
[1:12:10] closer and closer, but the thing is in
[1:12:11] all that, what you don't see is is he
[1:12:13] was getting closer to a resurrection and
[1:12:15] to an ascension. So yes, we may be
[1:12:18] descending into darker and darker times,
[1:12:20] worse things, worse situations, and it's
[1:12:22] seemingly even in hell. But that just
[1:12:24] means we're one day closer to a
[1:12:25] resurrection. That just means we're one
[1:12:27] day closer to an ascension. Ascension
[1:12:30] and and a rapture of the church. Each
[1:12:33] day something new. Each day another
[1:12:35] attack. Satan again trying to find that
[1:12:38] seed and crush it. Trying to break you.
[1:12:42] But just like it wasn't stopped down
[1:12:44] through the Old Testament. He couldn't
[1:12:46] stop it in the dark ages. He couldn't
[1:12:47] stop it in Luther's day or Wesley's day
[1:12:49] or at Isuza. He cannot stop the seed
[1:12:52] now. We will not be stopped. Listen,
[1:12:56] even in your stumbles,
[1:12:59] even in your failures,
[1:13:03] stop here just a moment because that
[1:13:05] shouldn't make us get quiet. That should
[1:13:06] be something to make us happy.
[1:13:10] Listen, what I'm f to say that this
[1:13:11] isn't a a denominational view or a
[1:13:14] fatalistic view of predestination to
[1:13:17] what will be will be. So, I can do what
[1:13:19] I want or it doesn't matter how I live
[1:13:22] if I'm predestinated. We know that's not
[1:13:23] the truth. But I want to make it clear,
[1:13:27] your failures in life, your sins, your
[1:13:30] scars, even what you are battling right
[1:13:32] now tonight does not change who you are.
[1:13:36] It does not change who you are. That
[1:13:38] seed that God placed on the inside of
[1:13:41] you is going to come to full
[1:13:43] manifestation. That's his seed. That's
[1:13:46] him on the inside of you. He's not going
[1:13:48] to let that seed be lost. He's not going
[1:13:50] to let that seed go down into feet and
[1:13:52] go down into hell. It's him. The devil
[1:13:56] can maim. He can attack. He can try to
[1:13:58] ruin you. He can destroy this flesh. But
[1:14:01] he cannot get that seed.
[1:14:05] That's why you can't stay cold. That's
[1:14:07] why you can't stay lukewarm. That's why
[1:14:09] when you do something wrong, you have to
[1:14:11] make it right. That seed says fix it.
[1:14:13] That seed says get right. That seed says
[1:14:16] get to the altar. That seed calls to
[1:14:18] your prodals come home. They can't stay
[1:14:20] forever. The devil can maim. He can
[1:14:23] attack. He can try to ruin them. But
[1:14:25] there's a seed that says you got to go
[1:14:28] home. He can't get to the seed tonight.
[1:14:33] Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] He can smud it up. He can poison you all
[1:14:38] he wants, but that seed's going to come
[1:14:40] to manifestation.
[1:14:44] I'm a living testimony that that's the
[1:14:46] truth.
[1:14:49] Sure. Sometimes the level the devil is
[1:14:51] going to land blows.
[1:14:53] Sometimes the attacks seem to get to us.
[1:14:56] And maybe we go through what seems like
[1:14:59] more than our share.
[1:15:02] I mean, I think if we're honest,
[1:15:05] sometimes we look around, it seems like
[1:15:06] people go through more than their share
[1:15:07] sometimes.
[1:15:11] Sometimes I'm like, "Lord, I forgive me
[1:15:14] for not counting my blessings every day.
[1:15:15] I hadn't gone through near what that
[1:15:17] brother's gone through. what that
[1:15:19] family's gone through. I'm blessed. We
[1:15:21] We're all blessed, but sometimes it
[1:15:23] feels like
[1:15:25] more than our share has been poured out
[1:15:27] on us. And and we end up we begin to
[1:15:30] question where where is God? Why isn't
[1:15:33] God moving for me? Why isn't he worked
[1:15:36] on this situation yet? Why isn't he with
[1:15:39] me?
[1:15:41] And I understand those questions. I do
[1:15:43] in in our moments in the darkest of
[1:15:45] nights.
[1:15:47] But I want to ask you this question to
[1:15:49] counter that.
[1:15:51] How do you think you're still standing
[1:15:56] how do you think you're still here?
[1:16:00] Even because all that you've been
[1:16:02] through and all that's been poured out
[1:16:03] upon Do you think you're still standing
[1:16:04] because of you?
[1:16:08] You think I'm still standing because of
[1:16:09] me?
[1:16:11] No. It's because yes, you're in the
[1:16:13] midst of a storm. Maybe your 10th storm,
[1:16:15] maybe your 20th, maybe more than anybody
[1:16:17] else. But in every single storm, he's
[1:16:19] been right there by your side. He's been
[1:16:22] standing there proving that he's
[1:16:23] trustworthy, proving that he's true,
[1:16:25] proving that he won't leave you or
[1:16:27] forsake you. You're still standing today
[1:16:29] because he's still fighting your
[1:16:30] battles. Maybe you got more than others,
[1:16:32] but maybe you'll have a greater reward
[1:16:34] because you won victory after victory
[1:16:36] after victory after victory. and maybe
[1:16:39] I'll just have the opportunity to stand
[1:16:41] by when the crown of life is placed on
[1:16:43] your head and I'll be able to testify.
[1:16:46] Yes, Lord, they went through so much,
[1:16:48] but they stood for you. They were proved
[1:16:50] in the proven grounds and they didn't
[1:16:52] falter. They didn't fail because you
[1:16:55] never left their side. Hallelujah.
[1:17:00] Doesn't matter how bad it gets, that
[1:17:03] seed presses on. God's always got
[1:17:06] somebody that will stand true because
[1:17:10] God proves his word.
[1:17:13] The prophet would tell us then that
[1:17:16] all he claimed to be
[1:17:19] throughout the Old Testament, even as he
[1:17:20] walked upon the earth, he proved by the
[1:17:24] resurrection.
[1:17:27] Said he proved by the resurrection. Had
[1:17:29] he stayed dead, then he wasn't the son
[1:17:31] of God. All right?
[1:17:33] Regardless of what other things had
[1:17:35] happened,
[1:17:37] had he stayed dead, he was just another
[1:17:39] man.
[1:17:40] The prophet tells us, he says, like he
[1:17:43] was the manifestation of the promised
[1:17:45] word of God. I will not leave his soul
[1:17:47] in hell, neither will I suffer my holy
[1:17:49] one to see corruption. He manifested it.
[1:17:52] Every word of God that was promised to
[1:17:54] him, he proved it when he raised on
[1:17:58] Easter morning. He says that's what he
[1:18:01] proved. Hallelujah. That's what Easter
[1:18:03] proved. He wasn't only the word, but he
[1:18:06] was God himself, the dynamics. Notice he
[1:18:09] says God himself the dynamics. So what
[1:18:12] is God? The dynamics in the word that
[1:18:15] made the body of Jesus Christ cold,
[1:18:17] stiff, dead in the grave. Listen, those
[1:18:19] same dynamics, you may be cold, dead,
[1:18:22] stiff, and evening like tabernacle. You
[1:18:23] may not be in a physical grave, but
[1:18:25] you're in a spiritual grave. The same
[1:18:26] thing that raised Jesus Christ from the
[1:18:28] dead will raise you from the dead
[1:18:30] tonight. the same dynamics.
[1:18:34] He says it made that body of Jesus
[1:18:36] Christ shaken to life and rise again.
[1:18:38] Roll away the stone. I am he that was
[1:18:41] dead. So dead till the sun said he was
[1:18:43] dead. The moon said he was dead. The
[1:18:45] star said he was dead. All nature said
[1:18:47] he was dead. And now the whole world has
[1:18:49] to recognize that he's alive again. He
[1:18:52] was not only the mechanics, God's word.
[1:18:55] He was the dynamics to prove it.
[1:18:59] Oh, we're talking about the proving
[1:19:00] ground now.
[1:19:02] If he being the word had to be proven,
[1:19:06] then we're no different.
[1:19:08] We're going to have to be proven as
[1:19:10] individuals. We're going to be have to
[1:19:13] be proven as ministry. This church is
[1:19:15] going to have to be proven for what we
[1:19:17] claim to be.
[1:19:21] It's a word born bride. And if he always
[1:19:25] proves his word,
[1:19:28] even the word in flesh, then we are also
[1:19:31] going to have to be proven.
[1:19:34] And what will the proof of it be?
[1:19:37] The same thing that proved the groom.
[1:19:40] It's going to be the same thing that
[1:19:41] proves the bride. It will be the
[1:19:43] dynamics in the word to make the word
[1:19:47] live. Again, it's not going to be that
[1:19:49] you got your doctrine straight, although
[1:19:51] you will. is not going to be that you
[1:19:53] know every single quote, although you
[1:19:55] will. But will there be dynamics there
[1:19:58] to make that quote live, to make that
[1:20:00] word live, to make a person live an
[1:20:02] overcoming life above sin? Yes, to
[1:20:05] manifest miracles. Yes, to to raise the
[1:20:07] dead and heal the sick and speak with
[1:20:09] tongues. Yes, all those things. Yeah,
[1:20:11] you know, I'm for all those things. But
[1:20:13] what about the greatest miracle? To take
[1:20:15] a ranked sinner that can't that falls
[1:20:18] and falls and falls and that power comes
[1:20:20] into him. the dynamics and makes that
[1:20:23] life live again. Overcoming sin,
[1:20:26] overcoming failures, overcoming a lie,
[1:20:28] evil spirit, lust spirits. That's the
[1:20:31] miraculous. That's the dynamic power of
[1:20:33] almighty God.
[1:20:37] It will be the dynamics in the word that
[1:20:39] makes it live again. Now, he's talking
[1:20:41] about the true seed. They're going to
[1:20:44] see that.
[1:20:47] They're going to get that word and stay
[1:20:49] right with it. proving ground. How do
[1:20:51] you say, "Prove of your love to me.
[1:20:53] Believe what I said."
[1:20:56] They're going to get that word and stay
[1:20:57] right with it. And I'm sending forth the
[1:20:59] spirit to water it. And it'll produce
[1:21:01] just exactly. It'll produce miracles.
[1:21:04] It'll produce the power of God. It'll
[1:21:06] produce. I like that. It'll produce.
[1:21:12] And it will not deny
[1:21:15] half of it.
[1:21:17] It won't deny parts of it. It won't deny
[1:21:23] any.
[1:21:26] I don't care if it was from 2,000 years
[1:21:28] ago,
[1:21:30] a thousand years ago,
[1:21:32] 800 years ago, 50 years ago. It won't
[1:21:36] take anything and deny it and say that
[1:21:38] was for back then.
[1:21:40] It won't deny anything because it's a
[1:21:43] kindred seed with the seed.
[1:21:47] Hallelujah. It's proving time, church.
[1:21:50] It's time to take the gates of the
[1:21:52] enemy. It's time to operate in the power
[1:21:54] of God. It's it I would call it a line
[1:21:57] in the sand time. What are our churches
[1:22:00] proving?
[1:22:03] Forget that.
[1:22:05] Just back up the tape. Not worried about
[1:22:07] other churches. What is our church
[1:22:09] proving?
[1:22:12] All right.
[1:22:14] What is your home proving?
[1:22:17] What is your life proving?
[1:22:24] I Is it crying out tonight with
[1:22:26] undeniable proof that he's alive?
[1:22:30] Undeniable proof that it produces
[1:22:32] overcoming lives? That it produces
[1:22:34] miracles?
[1:22:36] What is it crying out tonight?
[1:22:39] Listen to your prophet. He said his vist
[1:22:41] visture dip in blood. His name was
[1:22:43] called the word of God. He is the word
[1:22:45] of God. He is the quickening power. He
[1:22:47] is the Holy Spirit. The dynamics that
[1:22:50] comes into the mechanics, the words that
[1:22:52] make it live and it all has to work
[1:22:55] together or it just won't work.
[1:22:59] Why aren't lives being changed? Why do
[1:23:02] people set cold? Why do the sick lay
[1:23:03] sick? Because it all has to work
[1:23:06] together or it just won't work.
[1:23:10] It's got to take the
[1:23:14] whole Bible,
[1:23:16] the whole Christ, the full gospel.
[1:23:22] How are we proving even like tabernacle
[1:23:24] that we are who we say we are, that we
[1:23:27] are who he says we are?
[1:23:31] I'm not saying that in a negative way. I
[1:23:33] just want us to think about it.
[1:23:37] It's got to be proven. It's the proving
[1:23:39] time.
[1:23:41] Have we been restored? Are we back on
[1:23:43] speaking terms again? Do we have the
[1:23:46] power of the spoken word back in the
[1:23:48] church? Are the dynamics flowing out
[1:23:52] to prove that I'm not going to say that
[1:23:54] he's here, but are the dynamics flowing
[1:23:56] out of us to prove that we are him? All
[1:23:59] right.
[1:24:02] Because that's the place we got to get
[1:24:03] to. We are him. She is him. Are the
[1:24:07] dynamics flowing out? How's it going to
[1:24:10] be proved true? How we going to make it?
[1:24:11] How are we going to do it? He tells us
[1:24:14] right here. Listen. The teachings alone
[1:24:16] ain't going to do it. Knowing the quotes
[1:24:18] ain't going to do it. But the whole the
[1:24:21] teachings living, the quotes living, the
[1:24:26] word living. How, brother Aaron? By the
[1:24:29] damic power of God making the word
[1:24:32] manifest again. He said, I'm going to
[1:24:35] have somebody standing for it all. I'm
[1:24:38] going to have somebody standing for it
[1:24:39] all. Somebody that will prove his word
[1:24:41] in the closing of time. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:44] Dynamic power proved who he was. And
[1:24:46] dynamic power is going to prove who you
[1:24:48] are.
[1:24:50] Listen, this ain't by accident. We've
[1:24:52] been predestinated for this moment.
[1:24:54] We've been predestinated to meet the
[1:24:56] challenge of the age. and he knew the
[1:24:57] seed would be here just at this time.
[1:25:00] You're not just some nobody. You're not
[1:25:02] just some out in the woods backwoods
[1:25:04] country church. You are the word born
[1:25:06] bride. And in proving the word, he not
[1:25:08] only proves himself true, but by proving
[1:25:11] the word because you're a part of that
[1:25:12] word, it proves you're true tonight.
[1:25:16] You are who you say you are. You are who
[1:25:18] he says you are.
[1:25:21] Oh, glory.
[1:25:23] Satan has tried to stop it ever since
[1:25:25] Pentecost.
[1:25:27] down through the dark ages, killing of
[1:25:29] all the martyrs, filling the church with
[1:25:31] lies and deceit and false doctrines.
[1:25:34] And yet he couldn't stop it and here you
[1:25:36] are. One day it was Jesus that stepped
[1:25:39] out on the scene. Don't let it choke you
[1:25:41] up that one day it was you that stepped
[1:25:43] out on the scene.
[1:25:46] No, not not the fullness in a body, but
[1:25:50] a portion.
[1:25:52] And so one day we stepped out on the
[1:25:54] scene.
[1:25:57] Love this. He says in that gospel light
[1:25:59] of the resurrection,
[1:26:01] the confirmation of the word, how did we
[1:26:03] know he was Christ? Because he proved
[1:26:04] what he talked about. How will I know
[1:26:07] the message of the hour where God proves
[1:26:09] what he promised and he talks about it.
[1:26:11] That is the identification that we are
[1:26:13] beneficiaries with him in the
[1:26:14] resurrection. That he proves it to us.
[1:26:17] That's the identification. He proves
[1:26:19] what he has talked about. What he
[1:26:21] promised to do in Christ, he proved on
[1:26:22] the resurrection. What he promised to do
[1:26:24] in the days of Moses, he proved it. What
[1:26:26] he promised in the days of Enoch, he
[1:26:28] proved it. In all the days of the
[1:26:29] apostles, he proved it. So what's he
[1:26:31] going to do again today? He's going to
[1:26:34] prove it. I say he's already done it. I
[1:26:38] say he's already proven that he moves.
[1:26:40] He's proven that he heals. He's proven
[1:26:42] that he saves. He's proven that he'll
[1:26:44] fill you with the Holy Ghost. He's
[1:26:46] proven that time after time he'll
[1:26:48] deliver you when you fall down.
[1:26:50] Hallelujah.
[1:26:52] So if he's proven it, then we should
[1:26:54] come expecting it.
[1:26:56] I say we should come expecting those
[1:26:58] things. We ought to come with our
[1:27:00] attitude ready to receive. And sometimes
[1:27:02] I say, "Well, well, well, I just I just
[1:27:04] need God to move." Yeah, but you got a
[1:27:06] part to play in order to be able to
[1:27:08] receive when God moves.
[1:27:11] Think about it.
[1:27:14] Many touched him when he was here on
[1:27:16] earth, but because of the wrong
[1:27:17] attitude, they weren't healed.
[1:27:20] There was a lot of people that laid
[1:27:21] hands on Jesus that didn't receive
[1:27:23] nothing.
[1:27:25] But a lady came up with faith expecting
[1:27:27] to receive and touched him.
[1:27:31] And he proved to be true. Think about
[1:27:34] it. Many were in his presence and were
[1:27:36] never delivered. But those that came to
[1:27:38] him hungry, those came that came to him
[1:27:41] in faith, and those that came to him
[1:27:42] desperate. Look at as brother Brown
[1:27:44] talks about this. He says, "Here's a
[1:27:45] woman touched his garment. She was
[1:27:47] healed with a blood issue, but a soldier
[1:27:49] spit in his face and put a crown of
[1:27:50] thorns on his head and felt no virtue."
[1:27:53] It's your approach. Now listen close. I
[1:27:55] think this is very important.
[1:27:58] The attitude is what it takes. And
[1:28:00] that's what it is tonight, dear friend.
[1:28:01] It takes the attitude. We are and
[1:28:04] believe that we are in the presence of
[1:28:06] Jesus Christ. You believe that tonight?
[1:28:11] But it's your attitude that brings the
[1:28:13] results.
[1:28:15] The mechanics is here and so is the
[1:28:18] dynamics. If you just get started,
[1:28:22] God will do the rest.
[1:28:25] Church, I say let's just get started
[1:28:26] tonight. Let's just start expecting
[1:28:29] again tonight. Let's start letting our
[1:28:31] faith rise up. Maybe it's been beat
[1:28:32] down, but let's let it raise up a little
[1:28:34] bit tonight and maybe just get it moved.
[1:28:36] Maybe just a little step and say, "God,
[1:28:38] I just I'm just trying to get it
[1:28:40] started." Prophet of God says he'll do
[1:28:41] the rest. He'll come more than halfway.
[1:28:44] He'll do more than his share. As long as
[1:28:46] he sees a faithful heart, a hungry
[1:28:48] heart, a desperate heart coming to him.
[1:28:50] I want to be desperate tonight. I want
[1:28:52] to come hungry tonight. I don't want to
[1:28:54] miss an opportunity in his presence for
[1:28:56] him to prove his word to me. And I want
[1:28:58] him to be able to use me in order to
[1:29:00] prove his word to others. I want to be
[1:29:02] available. That's what we're here for is
[1:29:05] that his word can be proved through us.
[1:29:09] Hold on to that thought as we bring this
[1:29:10] to a close here. He says, "If his
[1:29:12] children were only take his word so he
[1:29:15] can prove it by you.
[1:29:17] That's the only way he can prove his
[1:29:19] word. He doesn't prove it to
[1:29:20] unbelievers, they can't be proved.
[1:29:24] They can't be proved.
[1:29:27] But you know who can be proved? You can
[1:29:29] be proved. It can be proved that you're
[1:29:31] a genuine seed. It can be proved that
[1:29:33] you're called to this, that you're
[1:29:34] chosen for this, that your name is on
[1:29:36] the Lamb's book of life. He says they
[1:29:38] can't be proved they are unbelievers.
[1:29:41] It's not for unbelievers. It's to him
[1:29:42] that believe. And if he can find
[1:29:44] somebody who will believe his word, he
[1:29:46] will prove his word
[1:29:49] by you.
[1:29:52] He will prove his word by you. And he
[1:29:55] will prove you by his word. Amen.
[1:29:58] Hallelujah. We are in the final test.
[1:30:03] Hallelu. We are in the proving grounds.
[1:30:06] How is it going to prove that this is
[1:30:08] overcoming life? How is it going to
[1:30:10] prove that that that he heals and he
[1:30:12] delivers? How's it going to prove to the
[1:30:13] devil that he has a bride that won't
[1:30:15] fall when Satan's eating
[1:30:18] you?
[1:30:19] So, guess what? You're going to face
[1:30:21] demons. You're going to face trials.
[1:30:24] You're going to get sick. You're going
[1:30:26] to get really sick sometimes. You're
[1:30:28] gonna have brothers turn their back on
[1:30:29] you. But let me get going. You're going
[1:30:32] to find healing. You're going to find
[1:30:33] deliverance. You're going to find
[1:30:35] overcoming. You're going to find
[1:30:36] salvation. And he's going to prove his
[1:30:39] word by his bride standing in Satan's
[1:30:42] Eden in the last day. Hallelujah.
[1:30:46] Glory to God.
[1:30:48] You are going to be proven that you are
[1:30:51] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.
[1:30:54] Oh church, it doesn't matter what he
[1:30:56] does. He can roll a stone over your
[1:30:59] life.
[1:31:00] He can try to change your name, call you
[1:31:03] depression. He can try to change your
[1:31:04] name and call you anxiety, try to change
[1:31:07] your name and call you addiction. He
[1:31:09] don't have a right to name you.
[1:31:12] Ain't one of you in here get a right to
[1:31:13] name my kids. That's my kid. You call
[1:31:17] them what they want. You can nickname
[1:31:18] them what they want. They don't got an
[1:31:19] answer to that. But when I say their
[1:31:21] name, that's when they look up and say,
[1:31:22] "Yes, daddy. I hear my name being
[1:31:25] called." The devil can call you what he
[1:31:27] wants. He can call you defeated. He can
[1:31:29] call you a failure. But he can't stop me
[1:31:31] from rising when he calls my name that
[1:31:34] was put on the lamb's book of life
[1:31:36] before the foundation of the world. I'm
[1:31:39] no longer the answer to those names of
[1:31:41] defeat.
[1:31:43] I'm not responding to that anymore. I'm
[1:31:45] in the proven ground and I'm here for
[1:31:47] one thing. To prove that I'm true and to
[1:31:50] prove that his word is true and he's
[1:31:52] going to prove his word by me and I'm
[1:31:54] going to be proved by his word.
[1:31:57] Hallelujah. There's no failure in your
[1:31:59] trials. There's no failure in your
[1:32:01] troubles. Oh, as long as you're fighting
[1:32:04] and still standing, you're winning.
[1:32:06] You're winning. I said quit letting him
[1:32:09] think just because you're in a battle
[1:32:11] that you're losing.
[1:32:13] Hallelujah.
[1:32:14] He's proving to the devil that you are a
[1:32:18] genuine seed.
[1:32:20] Listen to this. God gave Christ the
[1:32:22] spirit without measure, but he give it
[1:32:24] to us by measure. Christ had all the
[1:32:27] measure, everything. He was Emanuel. But
[1:32:29] you and I are little cupfuls of that
[1:32:32] seed.
[1:32:33] But when the spirit that's in us is of
[1:32:35] the same quality,
[1:32:38] that's all that matters.
[1:32:39] Not as much in quantity, but the same
[1:32:42] quality
[1:32:44] because it's part of the same spirit.
[1:32:48] That's why it can go through hell.
[1:32:50] That's why you can't be stopped. That's
[1:32:52] why you're an overcomer. I'm a nobody.
[1:32:54] Wrong again. You are of the same quality
[1:32:58] as the Lord Jesus Christ. Let that sink
[1:33:01] in. You can't lose. You can't be
[1:33:03] defeated. You can't be overcome. You
[1:33:05] can't miss the rapture. Jesus Christ is
[1:33:08] a part of himself on the inside of you.
[1:33:10] And he's saying, "I'm pulling it back.
[1:33:12] I'm drawing it back. You've proved it
[1:33:15] true. You've proved that you're genuine
[1:33:17] seed of the living God." Hallelujah.
[1:33:22] That's what this seed does. It conquers.
[1:33:25] That's what this seed does. It
[1:33:27] overcomes. That's what this seed does.
[1:33:30] It possesses the gates of its enemy. I
[1:33:33] say there's some gates that need to be
[1:33:35] possessed tonight. There's some grabbing
[1:33:37] hold of gates that's been barring you
[1:33:38] in, keeping you from your joy, keeping
[1:33:40] you from your promises, keeping you from
[1:33:42] your worship. I say take the gates
[1:33:44] tonight, possess the gates of your
[1:33:46] enemy, and let's haul them out of this
[1:33:48] place tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:33:52] The proving grounds.
[1:33:56] Stand together with me, please. I didn't
[1:34:00] mean to say that so forcefully.
[1:34:04] Please,
[1:34:09] you're not going to fall.
[1:34:12] I need you to understand something.
[1:34:13] These tests and these trials and this
[1:34:16] evil bombs, worry, fear, it's not to
[1:34:21] make you fall. It's to prove you. It's
[1:34:23] to prove you are what you say you are.
[1:34:26] And by the way, you can't fall. Prophet
[1:34:30] of God says it's a revelation. She knows
[1:34:32] it. So did Eve know it, but she fell.
[1:34:35] But this one knows it and won't fall.
[1:34:37] She is ordained. Hallelujah.
[1:34:42] She is ordained to not fall. She won't
[1:34:44] fall. She is predestined to it. You
[1:34:48] can't mess this up. You can't mess this
[1:34:52] up. Just yield to him tonight. Say,
[1:34:54] "Lord, I'm yours. Just prove your word
[1:34:57] in my life. Lord, just work through me.
[1:34:59] I just want to, Lord, step into your
[1:35:01] will. You predestined it and I just want
[1:35:04] to stand true in the proving grounds.
[1:35:06] Hallelujah. Tried, tested, suffering,
[1:35:10] but kept by the power of God.
[1:35:13] Hallelujah. Only gold tried in the fire
[1:35:16] shall endure.
[1:35:18] Hallelujah. Play something for me,
[1:35:20] Sister Rebecca. I want to end this with
[1:35:22] a story if you don't mind.
[1:35:26] Not so much a story as much as just a
[1:35:28] factual thing.
[1:35:31] Many of you know, most of you have heard
[1:35:33] the term Navy Seal. You know, the Navy
[1:35:36] Seals are
[1:35:39] considered some of the best of the best.
[1:35:41] I know there's other branches of the
[1:35:42] military, but they're some of the most
[1:35:45] well-known, best of the best there is.
[1:35:47] They go through incredibly hard
[1:35:49] training.
[1:35:52] And it's not to wreck them. It's not to
[1:35:55] ruin them.
[1:35:56] is so when the bullets start flying and
[1:35:59] the situation doesn't go the way it was
[1:36:01] planned, they don't panic.
[1:36:04] This is what we were made for. Brother
[1:36:07] Tim, we stood in the hospital room one
[1:36:08] night and you said, "This is what we're
[1:36:10] made for. This is what we've been
[1:36:12] trained for. This is what we do."
[1:36:16] It's why you go through the training.
[1:36:19] I'll never forget, sister Lena, if I
[1:36:21] messed this up, forgive me. But when she
[1:36:23] first got her diagnosis of cancer, they
[1:36:25] called the family together and I and it
[1:36:28] always just so encouraged me that she
[1:36:30] sat there and said, "Every song we've
[1:36:32] ever sung,
[1:36:33] every sermon we've ever heard, every
[1:36:36] service we've ever been in has prepared
[1:36:39] us for this moment." Amen.
[1:36:43] These battles, these scars, these
[1:36:45] attacks, these wounds, the things we go
[1:36:47] through, the services, the kind word
[1:36:49] that somebody says, the harsh word that
[1:36:51] somebody says, whatever it may be, it's
[1:36:54] not meant to sink you.
[1:36:56] It's preparing you. It's getting you
[1:36:59] ready because you're here to prove I'm
[1:37:01] genuine.
[1:37:03] I'm the real deal.
[1:37:08] I don't mind saying it. You can say it.
[1:37:10] I'm the real deal. I'm called. I'm
[1:37:12] chosen. There's a seat of God on me. I'm
[1:37:15] not backing down. I'm not going
[1:37:17] anywhere. I can't fall. I'm the real
[1:37:20] deal. Not within myself, but he put the
[1:37:24] real deal on the inside of me. And the
[1:37:26] anchor holds.
[1:37:28] You're the real deal tonight. That's how
[1:37:30] you're here. That's why you're here.
[1:37:40] They go through so much training and the
[1:37:42] test and the trials.
[1:37:44] They prepare them for battle, but more
[1:37:46] importantly, it prepares them for
[1:37:47] victory.
[1:37:48] But one part of the training that they
[1:37:50] go through
[1:37:53] to prove that they got what it takes,
[1:37:57] that they're real seals. It's actually
[1:38:00] called hell week.
[1:38:02] It's called Hail Week.
[1:38:06] It's five and a half days of continuous
[1:38:11] operational training
[1:38:13] beginning Sunday night and not ending
[1:38:15] till Friday afternoon. And during this
[1:38:16] whole week, they get three and a half
[1:38:18] hours of sleep. Not a night, three and a
[1:38:21] half hours of sleep during that week.
[1:38:25] They'll get like 10 minutes this night
[1:38:26] and 20 here. And it's usually done in
[1:38:29] about four or five inches of water
[1:38:31] laying on the beach in the sand.
[1:38:35] physical limits are pushed to the
[1:38:36] extreme.
[1:38:38] Most of their time is spent in the
[1:38:40] water, cold, constant training such as
[1:38:43] running, swimming, carrying heavy logs,
[1:38:45] obstacle courses, other forms of PT.
[1:38:48] They say only about 25%
[1:38:51] of those that go in come out.
[1:38:55] But here's the thing I want to get to
[1:38:56] you.
[1:38:58] At any point during the week,
[1:39:01] there's a bell.
[1:39:03] They keep it close by all the time that
[1:39:05] they can go ring three times. One, two,
[1:39:09] three. And it signifies defeat.
[1:39:14] It signifies I can't take it anymore. I
[1:39:18] thought I was a seal, but I'm not. I
[1:39:21] thought I can make it, but I can't.
[1:39:25] And not only is that bell kept there
[1:39:27] very close in reach, but they say the
[1:39:30] instructors intentionally
[1:39:32] taunt them and encourage the candidates
[1:39:35] that are struggling the most. Go ring
[1:39:37] the bell. You know you want to ring the
[1:39:40] bell. You know you're a quitter. You
[1:39:42] know you can't make it through this
[1:39:44] course. You should have never got in
[1:39:46] this course. You're embarrassing all of
[1:39:48] us. Go ring the bell. Go ring the bell.
[1:39:52] And they start describing the relief
[1:39:53] that will come with quitting. There's a
[1:39:56] hot meal waiting on you. You hadn't
[1:39:57] eaten in 4 days. boy, we see you
[1:40:00] quivering. Go ring the bell. Go get a
[1:40:03] hot shower. Go get a comfortable bed.
[1:40:06] It'll end the pain.
[1:40:08] And this approach is part of the
[1:40:10] intense, rigorous selection process
[1:40:12] designed to identify individuals with
[1:40:15] exceptional mental and physical
[1:40:16] toughness. Hell Week is a brutal
[1:40:18] crucible designed to identify those
[1:40:20] candidates with the unwavering resolve,
[1:40:23] resilience necessary to become a seal.
[1:40:25] Now, I read over that last part fast on
[1:40:27] purpose, so you probably didn't catch
[1:40:28] it.
[1:40:30] It did not say that the trials and the
[1:40:32] hardships and the sleep defradation was
[1:40:34] made to weed out the weak. It didn't
[1:40:36] made it wasn't made to to to make people
[1:40:39] look bad. It ain't about the quitters.
[1:40:42] It ain't about the losers. It ain't
[1:40:45] about those that can't stand in the
[1:40:46] proving ground. It said this selection
[1:40:50] process is designed to identify the
[1:40:53] individuals with exceptional toughness.
[1:40:56] It is designed to identify those
[1:40:59] candidates who can become a Navy Seal.
[1:41:02] We're not here to find the weak. We're
[1:41:04] not here to fall down. We're here to be
[1:41:07] identified. I'm going to make it. I'm
[1:41:10] going to make it. I'm staying till the
[1:41:13] end. Devil says, "Ring the bell. Ring
[1:41:15] the bell." I will not ring the bell. I
[1:41:18] will not ring the bell. Oh, but until I
[1:41:21] hear the joy bells ringing, we made it.
[1:41:26] We proved true. We're the overcomers of
[1:41:29] the age. That's why we're here to be
[1:41:33] identified with Jesus Christ.
[1:41:37] Hallelujah.
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:39] born and raised back to life again.
[1:41:45] I was made for Lord.
[1:41:51] Go ahead and praise him.

[1:45:14] was called by
[1:45:17] I was born and raised back to life. Back
[1:45:21] to life again. And I was made.
[1:45:30] Oh. So why would I make a bed in my
[1:45:36] shame when a fountain of grace is
[1:45:40] running my way? I know I am yours and I
