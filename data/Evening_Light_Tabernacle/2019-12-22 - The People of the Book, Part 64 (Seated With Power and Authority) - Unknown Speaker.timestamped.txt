[48:38] greatest gift God gave but let's not
[48:42] present him as a God of history but
[48:45] let's see him as a God of the present
[48:47] he's not a babe in a manger
[48:49] he's a resurrected Lord and as Lord he
[48:53] is champion over ever devil ever disease
[48:56] ever sinned and ever sickness for all
[48:59] have to bow to his name a man and his
[49:03] believers let us be like Israel of old
[49:05] who were led by the cloud of fire
[49:08] prophetic utterance miracles and signs
[49:11] and god-given wonders a man and this was
[49:15] to be accomplished by God selected God
[49:18] ordained and God equipped and God sent
[49:20] men with a whole camp being dominated by
[49:24] a Holy Ghost smooth Amen are you ready
[49:27] to be dominated by Holy Ghost move today
[49:30] hey man I want to just yield my vessel

[49:40] man and let us be recipients of that
[49:42] divine grace amen god bless you thank
[49:45] you for all the wonderful singing today
[49:48] I'm gonna go right back to the
[49:50] scriptures that we have been ministering
[49:53] on numbers chapter 33 verse 53 because I
[49:57] don't believe we got everything out of
[49:59] this we need to get immense I believe
[50:02] that the Lord has another portion for us
[50:04] today we'll also be looking at the book
[50:06] of John chapter 15 so number 33 verse 53
[50:11] when Israel would come to the promised
[50:14] land they would find that this promised
[50:17] land was already possessed but they had
[50:20] to kick out the inhabitants of the land
[50:22] and I want you to understand as we read
[50:25] the scripture today we have our promised
[50:28] land which is the word of God and ever
[50:31] demon of Hell wants to camp down on it
[50:34] and say it's not for you you cannot
[50:36] possess it amen so we come to the
[50:39] promised land and we already see there's
[50:41] a devil sitting right there on there
[50:43] trying to tell you you can have it but
[50:46] I've got a word from the Lord for you
[50:48] and ye shall dispossessed the
[50:52] inhabitants of the land and dwell
[50:55] therein for I have given you the land to
[51:00] possess it why not amazing God an
[51:07] amazing word and it's ever been true hey
[51:13] man then I want to go to John chapter 15
[51:16] verse 7 if you abide in me and my words
[51:21] abide in you ye shall ask what you will
[51:24] and it shall be done unto you herein is
[51:27] my father glorified that you bear much
[51:29] fruit so shall you be my disciples amen
[51:34] god bless you you can be seated we're
[51:38] going to be speaking this morning on
[51:39] seated with power and authority these
[51:44] words that we have read from the book of
[51:47] John if you abide in me and my words
[51:50] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[51:52] and it shall be
[51:53] here and my father is glorified that you
[51:55] bear much fruit so shall you be my
[51:57] disciples these words are the
[52:01] description of every child of God that
[52:05] is filled with the Holy Ghost they are
[52:09] the children of God our fruit bearing
[52:11] men and women of faith not only do they
[52:15] deny the works of the flesh they are led
[52:18] by the spirit and they are not under the
[52:21] law and they're not under sins Dominion
[52:25] in Galatians 5:19 tells us the works of
[52:29] the flesh are manifest which are these
[52:31] adultery fornication uncleanness
[52:33] lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft
[52:36] hatred variance emulations wrath strife
[52:39] seditions heresies envyings murders
[52:41] drunkenness Rebellion's of such like
[52:45] other which I told you before as i have
[52:49] also told you in time past that they
[52:51] which do such things shall not inherit
[52:54] the kingdom of god but you see those
[52:58] that are connected to the vine they bear
[53:02] these fruits verse 22 but the fruit of
[53:05] the Spirit is love joy peace
[53:07] long-suffering gentleness goodness faith
[53:09] meekness temperance all of them
[53:12] describes who you really are
[53:15] the child of God glorifies the father as
[53:18] we bear fruit or we give evidence to
[53:20] abiding in the branch we are a people of
[53:24] Dominion unbelief in all types of sin
[53:28] does not have dominion over us yet we
[53:33] know there are people today who claim
[53:35] the Holy Ghost and yet there's no
[53:38] keeping power in their life and the
[53:41] Bible tells us that would be those kind
[53:43] because it said men would have a form of
[53:46] godliness but denied the power thereof
[53:49] so how can we say that one can commit
[53:52] sins of adultery and fornication or
[53:54] homosexual acts and still have the Holy
[53:57] Ghost when you receive the Holy Ghost
[54:00] the desire of sin is gone because sin
[54:04] nature is dead
[54:06] first Corinthians six and nine it tells
[54:09] you who will not inherit the kingdom of
[54:12] God said the unrighteous shall not
[54:14] inherit the kingdom of God be not
[54:16] deceived neither fornicators adulterers
[54:18] adulterers effeminate nor abusers of
[54:21] themselves with mankind nor thieves nor
[54:23] covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[54:26] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[54:28] of God and now what we have just read to
[54:31] you is every one of these are willful
[54:34] sins and the understand and that was a
[54:39] condition we were all in I'm glad
[54:43] there's a God who forgive us of our
[54:45] iniquities ma'am but but verse 11 says
[54:49] and such were some of you but you are
[54:54] washed but you were sanctified but you
[54:57] are justified which means you are
[54:59] declared righteous in the name of the
[55:01] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[55:05] you know we don't need to make excuses
[55:07] for sins some will take the Bible in
[55:10] Romans 7 where it said that I find the
[55:12] law that when I would do good evil is
[55:14] present with me and that because of the
[55:17] flesh that we have to drag something
[55:20] that is unconverted along with us all
[55:22] you know that then we can't help but do
[55:25] what is wrong but I want you to
[55:28] understand that sin is the result of sin
[55:30] dwelling in you and Paul is not talking
[55:33] about a man in his field with the Holy
[55:35] Ghost but someone who is who is still
[55:38] sold in slavery to sin and one who still
[55:43] has sin abiding within them and this man
[55:46] will say I wanted to write and I delight
[55:49] in the law but I just can't live it with
[55:53] my mind I want to do right but with sin
[55:55] nature of my place I can't do it and so
[55:59] that is a wretched condition that all
[56:01] humanity is in and was in and until
[56:06] Jesus came and this is what Paul would
[56:08] say all wretched man who will deliver me
[56:11] from this body of say
[56:12] here lies the answer I think God Jesus
[56:16] Christ my lord so there is therefore an
[56:21] inoculation for them which are in Christ
[56:23] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[56:26] after the spirit and I'm talking to men
[56:29] and women today that I believe are
[56:31] walking in the spirit now I would like
[56:35] to review or look at Romans say as 6 and
[56:39] verse 1 and let's just read some of this
[56:41] and I've just got some things to lay
[56:44] some foundation on this morning as we
[56:46] get into our subject of being seated
[56:49] with power and authority as a verse 1
[56:52] says what shall we say then shall we
[56:55] continue in sin that grace may abound
[56:57] but how shall we that are dead to sin
[57:00] live any longer therein no you're not
[57:04] that so many of us as were baptized into
[57:07] Christ Jesus were baptized into his
[57:09] death therefore we are buried with him
[57:11] in in by baptism into death that like as
[57:15] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[57:18] the glory of the Father even so we
[57:20] should walk in the newness of life for
[57:24] if we have been planted together in the
[57:25] likeness of his death we shall also be
[57:28] in the likeness of his resurrection so
[57:32] you know this is our very type of
[57:34] baptism you don't you don't bury
[57:36] somebody that is alive you bury someone
[57:38] who's dead and so it's a very type that
[57:42] we fulfill in baptism that we were
[57:44] saying the old man is dead and we are
[57:46] we're bearing him and razan again to the
[57:50] newness of life so he says here I'm
[57:53] knowing that said our old man is
[57:56] crucified with him that the body of sin
[57:59] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[58:02] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[58:05] is freedom from sin now if we be dead
[58:10] with Christ we believe we shall also
[58:11] live with him knowing that Christ being
[58:15] raised from the dead died the more and
[58:17] death had no more dominion over him for
[58:20] in that heat
[58:21] I did he he died under sin once but in
[58:25] that he liveth he liveth unto God
[58:28] likewise reckon yourself ye yourselves
[58:31] to be dead indeed to sin but alive unto
[58:34] God through Jesus Christ our Lord and
[58:37] listen to this next verse let not sin
[58:40] therefore reign in your mortal body a
[58:44] man that you should obey it in the lusts
[58:47] thereof what a word that is given what
[58:53] an understanding that is being given to
[58:56] know that our body is no longer the
[58:59] servant of sin and sin can no longer
[59:03] have rule or reign over you
[59:06] it is no longer the dwelling place of
[59:09] sin nature but it is now the temple of
[59:13] the Holy Ghost
[59:14] so we know that where our sins are
[59:18] cleansed and forgiven and we no longer
[59:20] desire to do things wrong but it always
[59:24] remains this question that comes up
[59:26] every so often does Christian sin well
[59:31] here's what the Bible says in Hebrews
[59:33] 10:26 for if we sin wilfully after that
[59:38] we have received that knowledge of the
[59:39] truth that remaineth no more sacrifice
[59:41] for sins that is if we sin on purpose
[59:47] after receiving the knowledge of the
[59:49] truth the blood doesn't cleanse us
[59:51] there's no sacrifice available to ones
[59:55] that are have been labelled and have
[59:59] received the knowledge of the truth and
[1:00:01] to continue on in sin and keep doing the
[1:00:04] wrong things and evil things there's no
[1:00:06] sacrifice for that the blood is to keep
[1:00:10] those from from sin who is walking in
[1:00:13] faith and man who is overcoming in their
[1:00:17] lives because sin nature is dead
[1:00:19] if we are part of Christ if we abide in
[1:00:22] Christ we do not sin willfully or our
[1:00:25] own purpose so let no man deceive you
[1:00:28] here if you're righteous by the
[1:00:30] cleansing of the blood you
[1:00:32] do what is right if we commit sin
[1:00:35] willfully we're not yet born again but
[1:00:38] we're still at the devil hey man we need
[1:00:41] a cleansing from sin nature and that's
[1:00:44] the very reason that Jesus came was to
[1:00:46] destroy the works of the devil that is
[1:00:50] to destroy sin and it's shameful disease
[1:00:52] our deeds and if we're born again we
[1:00:56] cannot sin because the seed of God has
[1:01:00] been awakened in us and we cannot sin
[1:01:03] willfully because we are born of God and
[1:01:07] there's a new life in us that brings
[1:01:10] harm our very flesh under the control of
[1:01:13] the Holy Spirit this is what he said in
[1:01:15] John 2 and 1 first John 2 and 1 my
[1:01:18] little children these things I write
[1:01:20] unto you that you seem not so why would
[1:01:25] John tell us not to sin if we have no
[1:01:27] power to keep from sinning this alone
[1:01:30] shows who are the children of God who
[1:01:32] still belongs to the devil if someone is
[1:01:35] still willfully sinning he's unconverted
[1:01:37] and sin shall has dominion over him you
[1:01:41] remember there in John 15:7 what we what
[1:01:45] we read if you abide in me if you abide
[1:01:48] in me and my words abide in you look at
[1:01:52] first John the verse first John three
[1:01:55] and six who's ever abided him in him
[1:01:58] sinneth not who's ever sinneth had not
[1:02:02] seen him neither known him little
[1:02:05] children let no man deceive you he that
[1:02:08] doeth righteousness righteous even as he
[1:02:10] is righteous he that committeth sin is
[1:02:12] of the devil for the devil sinneth from
[1:02:14] the beginning for this purpose the Son
[1:02:17] of God was manifested that he might
[1:02:19] destroy the works of the devil who sever
[1:02:22] is born of God did not commit sin for
[1:02:24] his seed remaineth in him and he cannot
[1:02:27] sin because he is born of God in this -
[1:02:30] children of God are manifest in the
[1:02:32] children of devil who does not
[1:02:34] righteousness is not of God neither he
[1:02:37] that loveth not his brother
[1:02:39] so however God knows that we have a
[1:02:43] converted soul
[1:02:45] we still live in a body of flesh that is
[1:02:47] not converted and we're constantly
[1:02:50] tempted to do wrong hey man I'll tell
[1:02:55] you if I would ask you for a hand to be
[1:02:58] raised every person in this building
[1:03:00] would raise if I ask you how many this
[1:03:02] this week has been tempted to do wrong
[1:03:04] you've been tempted to disbelieve and
[1:03:08] then you have been tempted to commit to
[1:03:11] commit something that is sinful synonymy
[1:03:14] but yet sin desire is gone but we still
[1:03:17] walk in the path of this world and sin
[1:03:21] abounds everywhere and man it's like can
[1:03:25] I can I just explain it like a farmer
[1:03:27] would it's like an ax manure along the
[1:03:30] path we see it we avoid it but sometimes
[1:03:34] we didn't see it and we step in it
[1:03:38] we don't do it willfully because it's
[1:03:41] nasty and we quickly clean it off our
[1:03:44] feet hey man but to the believer sin is
[1:03:49] disgusting it's even more disgusting
[1:03:51] than animal manure you don't put your
[1:03:54] foot in it and purpose and if you do
[1:03:57] stepping in accidentally you wash it out
[1:04:00] real quickly and the same with sin a
[1:04:03] true believer will never sin on purpose
[1:04:06] and as we walk in this life all along
[1:04:10] the path Satan is there to trap us we
[1:04:13] sin we didn't pray enough by misuse of
[1:04:16] her time we sinned by allowing things to
[1:04:20] upset us we sinned by having doubts and
[1:04:23] fear we sinned
[1:04:24] hey man and for this we have an advocate
[1:04:28] a man who intercedes on our behalf I'm
[1:04:32] glad to have an advocate Amen that makes
[1:04:35] up for our for our lacks in our humanity
[1:04:39] first on June 1 my little children these
[1:04:41] things write unto you that you see not
[1:04:43] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[1:04:47] with the father Jesus Christ the
[1:04:50] righteous and he is a perpetuation for
[1:04:54] our sin and not only fires only but also
[1:04:58] for the sins of the whole world so
[1:05:01] what's the difference between willful
[1:05:03] sin and a mistake a mistake is something
[1:05:07] you didn't mean to do and was not
[1:05:10] willfully done let me give you some
[1:05:13] examples of willful sin to smoke a
[1:05:16] cigarette I have to sin willfully I have
[1:05:19] to think about it I have to purchase it
[1:05:21] I have to pick it up I have to light it
[1:05:24] i all kinds of steps that i have to go
[1:05:26] through i go through every kind of
[1:05:28] warning every kind of thought telling me
[1:05:31] don't do that don't do that even on the
[1:05:33] package it says don't do that hey man
[1:05:37] you have to willfully unconsciously
[1:05:40] decide I want to smoke a cigarette you
[1:05:43] know using drugs and alcohol you have to
[1:05:45] willfully unconsciously go and buy and
[1:05:47] then inject yourself with drugs or
[1:05:49] alcohol and it man not having sex with
[1:05:52] someone you're not married to this is
[1:05:54] willful sin lying on purpose you think
[1:05:57] about it make up a lie you know
[1:06:00] purposely looking at pornography
[1:06:01] adultery is willful sin and that's
[1:06:04] adultery but but of course this doesn't
[1:06:08] mean that we as Christians never make a
[1:06:11] mistake or do things wrong no it means
[1:06:13] that the Holy Ghost dwells within us and
[1:06:16] our nature and desires are changed and
[1:06:19] the blood then covers all of our
[1:06:22] mistakes aren't you glad for the blood
[1:06:25] it means that the Holy Ghost abides and
[1:06:28] that is our anchor during the hour of
[1:06:31] temptation and in those times he makes a
[1:06:34] way of escape it means it means that he
[1:06:38] abides to convince us of what is sin and
[1:06:41] brings us quickly to obedience to the
[1:06:44] will and the word of God it means that
[1:06:47] every day we crucify and keep dead the
[1:06:49] will of the flesh hey man no ma I think
[1:06:54] as it is that my mind just goes back to
[1:06:57] Eden a moment back in Eden God saw his
[1:07:00] son Adam become a slave to sin nature
[1:07:03] what a horrible day that was sin made
[1:07:08] Adam hide from God
[1:07:10] sin made him insane sin made him make
[1:07:13] excuses and blame even ultimately blame
[1:07:16] God saying the woman thou has given me
[1:07:20] but can you imagine the joy of the
[1:07:23] father that he has today watching you
[1:07:27] overcome a man that you are now a branch
[1:07:30] in the vine when you were once a servant
[1:07:34] of sin that you you you now are no
[1:07:38] longer a slave to sin Romans 8:11 said
[1:07:42] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:07:45] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:07:47] raised Christ from the dead also quicken
[1:07:50] your mortal body by his spirit that
[1:07:53] dwelleth within you 2nd Corinthians 6:16
[1:07:56] says you are the Temple of the Living
[1:07:59] God I'm talking about who you are not
[1:08:01] who you were I'm talking about who you
[1:08:04] are I mean you are the Temple of the
[1:08:07] Living God as God said I will dwell in
[1:08:09] them and walk in them and I will be
[1:08:11] their God and they shall be my people
[1:08:15] obeisance 3:17 says that Christ may
[1:08:18] dwell in your heart by faith you being
[1:08:21] rooted and grounded in love 1st John 4
[1:08:24] and 13 says here but know you that we
[1:08:27] dwell in him and he and us because he
[1:08:30] has given of us his spirit hey man what
[1:08:35] a wonderful thing it is to say I'm
[1:08:37] sealed hey man the Holy Spirit is sealed
[1:08:43] my life and he's in and the devil is
[1:08:47] shut out I don't bomb the devil my body
[1:08:53] don't even belong to him
[1:08:56] my spirit doesn't bond to him nothing of
[1:09:00] myself belongs to the devil in the
[1:09:05] breach between the church Jesus and the
[1:09:07] seals brother Branham said you've always
[1:09:09] heard me saved the people said that that
[1:09:11] what made me do this no no the devil
[1:09:14] didn't do it you just wasn't seal them
[1:09:16] because when you're sealed in he's
[1:09:17] sealed out yeah now you went up to him
[1:09:20] my honey he couldn't get into you
[1:09:21] because the only way to get into you is
[1:09:24] through the same process that you have
[1:09:26] he would have to be saved sanctified
[1:09:28] filled with the Holy Ghost and then he'd
[1:09:30] be your brother so you see he didn't do
[1:09:32] it not all you just went to the
[1:09:34] borderline and come back lusting for the
[1:09:36] things of the world
[1:09:37] you never went all the way in the cane
[1:09:39] and you see across Jordan to death to
[1:09:43] yourself he would also explain this in
[1:09:46] the token message the Bible said he this
[1:09:49] morning God did not commit sin for he
[1:09:51] careth sin for the seed of God a man
[1:09:53] remains in him and how can he send when
[1:09:56] the sinless God is in him and when he is
[1:09:59] in a sinless God how can he send no
[1:10:02] matter what he's done the Bloods covered
[1:10:04] him see he's a new creature now his
[1:10:06] desires and ambitions is of heaven
[1:10:08] because he's changed from a cuckoo bird
[1:10:10] till we his desires ain't the same as it
[1:10:14] once was
[1:10:14] and he displayed it and you say oh I
[1:10:16] believe that and still sinning no your
[1:10:19] deceit see it can't display nothing but
[1:10:22] the token and we know that's the literal
[1:10:24] life of Jesus Christ I'd like to look at
[1:10:28] first John 2:27 and I want to remind you
[1:10:32] from what we were speaking last week
[1:10:34] that this anointing that we have
[1:10:37] received as different from the anointing
[1:10:40] of the Old Testament in that that there
[1:10:42] was not a proper sacrifice it could take
[1:10:45] away sin and then give back his nature
[1:10:49] but about this anointing that you have
[1:10:52] it is a life that abides look at verse
[1:10:55] 27 but the anointing which you have
[1:10:57] received of him abideth in you and you
[1:11:01] need not that any man teach you but as
[1:11:03] the same anointing teaches you of all
[1:11:05] things and his truth and is no lie
[1:11:08] as it hath taught you you shall abide in
[1:11:10] him and now little children abide in him
[1:11:14] that he went he shall appear we mount
[1:11:17] company of to not be ashamed before him
[1:11:19] at his coming we are born again
[1:11:24] how many can say this Lord I'm glad I'm
[1:11:27] born again a man well if you're born
[1:11:30] again Ephesians 2:10 says we are his
[1:11:33] workmanship we are created in Christ
[1:11:37] Jesus to good works and which God hath
[1:11:40] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:11:45] Ephesians 4 21 says if so be that you
[1:11:48] heard him and have been taught by him
[1:11:50] and the truth is in Jesus that you put
[1:11:53] off the former conversation the conduct
[1:11:56] behavior the old man which is corrupt
[1:11:58] according to deceitful lusts and be
[1:12:00] renewed in the spirit of your mind and
[1:12:02] that you put on the new man which after
[1:12:05] God is created in righteousness and true
[1:12:08] holiness Romans 6:6 we read this knowing
[1:12:14] that our old man is crucified with him
[1:12:16] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:12:18] that henceforth or from now on we should
[1:12:21] not serve sin but he that is dead is
[1:12:24] freed from sin and man Colossians 3 of
[1:12:28] mine said senior put off the old man
[1:12:30] with his deeds and put on the new man
[1:12:33] which is renewed and knowledge up to the
[1:12:36] image of him that created him and then I
[1:12:40] would like to look at your church age
[1:12:42] and the revelation of deity God's
[1:12:47] personal revelation of himself to your
[1:12:51] age wrong a Revelation chapter 3 verse
[1:12:55] 14 and to the Angel of the Church of
[1:12:59] Laodicea write these things saith the
[1:13:04] Amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:13:07] beginning of the creation of God so now
[1:13:12] the book of Revelation here are
[1:13:15] revelation of God to this age is
[1:13:18] specific to us that Christ is
[1:13:22] the beginning of the creation of God and
[1:13:25] the truest God condescended from from
[1:13:29] spirit to look to the apne and as the
[1:13:34] thoughts of God was released from the
[1:13:36] word the logos in dude theophany form
[1:13:40] and by the words God framed the world so
[1:13:44] he was the beginner are the author of
[1:13:46] the creation of God there was this was
[1:13:50] not one person creating the second
[1:13:53] person of God but this was because that
[1:13:57] would make God Jesus lower than God had
[1:14:00] a man but these words here the beginner
[1:14:04] or the author of the creation of God so
[1:14:07] we know thirty that Jesus is God he's
[1:14:10] very God he is a creator all things were
[1:14:14] made by him and without him was not
[1:14:17] anything made that was made and he's the
[1:14:20] one who said in Genesis 1:1 in the
[1:14:22] beginning God created the heavens on the
[1:14:25] earth it also says in Exodus 20 and 11
[1:14:28] for six days the Lord made heaven and
[1:14:31] earth the sea and all that is in them is
[1:14:34] and rested the seventh day so there's no
[1:14:36] doubt he is the creator and he was the
[1:14:41] creator of a finished physical creation
[1:14:45] amen so we can see what these words mean
[1:14:47] to have any other interpretation would
[1:14:50] mean God created God so how could God be
[1:14:53] creative when he himself is a creator
[1:14:56] but now he's standing in the midst of
[1:14:58] his church here in the seven days and
[1:15:01] the enemy stands revealing who he is in
[1:15:04] this last stage and he calls himself the
[1:15:07] author of the creation of God and this
[1:15:11] now is not the same creation of Genesis
[1:15:15] one this is a new creation remember the
[1:15:19] Old Covenant had a creation the New
[1:15:22] Covenant also has a creation a map by
[1:15:27] man and this this new creation start
[1:15:30] with de learn
[1:15:32] I Manfred said in the beginning in the
[1:15:36] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:15:40] made flesh somebody with me so the new
[1:15:44] creation would be me would start with
[1:15:47] the word and he would produce sons of
[1:15:51] the word remember that first creation
[1:15:54] would create a life and bringing them to
[1:15:57] the image of God was upon the earth and
[1:15:59] the new creation does the same it begins
[1:16:02] with the word and if from that word is
[1:16:06] persons and out of that word comes more
[1:16:10] sons and more sons and more sons
[1:16:15] Alleluia now so this is another creation
[1:16:20] you can look at your body and you can
[1:16:23] see it's the old order of creation it
[1:16:26] will have to be changed hey man but you
[1:16:32] that have been birth within your soul
[1:16:35] you are not that soul is not of the old
[1:16:38] order of creation that creation is a
[1:16:41] fallen creation that creation is a slave
[1:16:45] to sin that creation is under the
[1:16:48] domination of sin but the new creation
[1:16:51] is not under since - since Dominion
[1:16:54] unbelief cannot stand doubt cannot rule
[1:16:58] it hallelujah are you with me Amanda
[1:17:03] it is of a new creation and that
[1:17:06] creation he started with God coming town
[1:17:10] in a virgin and there would overshadow a
[1:17:15] virgin and then from that from that work
[1:17:19] that he did of that creation out of him
[1:17:22] now would come the rest of his creation
[1:17:25] now isn't that what God did in the
[1:17:27] beginning he unfolded himself from
[1:17:30] spirit untimed to where he would come to
[1:17:33] sin in the word and from word he would
[1:17:36] create all things hallelujah
[1:17:39] hey man and then I have this one this is
[1:17:42] what God does
[1:17:43] he can't dissent and it takes on human
[1:17:45] flats and the word becomes flesh and
[1:17:48] then from that word he will create all
[1:17:50] things my friends you're under Europe
[1:17:55] another creation you're not at the
[1:17:59] creation of failure you're of a new
[1:18:03] creation and then with this creation
[1:18:05] doesn't know the word failure and man it
[1:18:11] is a word it is a creation we're in sons
[1:18:14] of God dominate not we're sons of God
[1:18:18] become dominating this is a creation
[1:18:23] that cast Satan out not a creation that
[1:18:28] comes under his reign a man now so
[1:18:33] brother Branham would say in the church
[1:18:35] age book this is a new creation another
[1:18:38] creation has to do with the church is a
[1:18:40] special designation of himself he is a
[1:18:43] creator of that church the heavenly
[1:18:47] bridegroom created his own bride as a
[1:18:51] spirit of God he came down created in
[1:18:53] the Virgin Mary the cells of from which
[1:18:56] he was born I want to repeat that he
[1:18:59] created the very cells in the womb of
[1:19:02] Mary for that body and it wasn't enough
[1:19:05] for those who spirit just simply to give
[1:19:07] life to human ovum supplied by Mary that
[1:19:11] would not have been or that would have
[1:19:13] been sinful mankind produced in the body
[1:19:15] a man that would not have that would not
[1:19:17] have produced the last atom of him and
[1:19:20] it said lo a body hast thou father
[1:19:22] prepared me so God not Mary provided
[1:19:25] that body Mary was a human incubator and
[1:19:29] she carried the Holy Child and brought
[1:19:31] him to birth it was in God man he was
[1:19:35] the son of God
[1:19:36] he was of the new creation and man and
[1:19:39] God met and joined he was the first of
[1:19:44] this new race
[1:19:45] I want to talk about Jesus for a little
[1:19:48] while a man he was the first of this new
[1:19:52] race he is the head of this new race and
[1:19:56] then this is the god race are you with
[1:20:00] me
[1:20:00] Colossians 1:18 says and she is the head
[1:20:04] of the body the church who is the
[1:20:07] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[1:20:10] hallelujah that in all things he might
[1:20:13] have the preeminence a man 2nd
[1:20:17] Corinthians 5:17 since therefore if any
[1:20:21] man be in Christ he is a new creation
[1:20:25] and all things are passed away and
[1:20:28] behold all things have become new
[1:20:30] a man now therefore you can see that no
[1:20:34] man was of the old order of creation now
[1:20:37] in union with Christ he have become of
[1:20:40] the new creation of God Ephesians 2:10
[1:20:46] says we are his workmanship created in
[1:20:50] union with Christ Jesus under good works
[1:20:54] verse 24 of chapter 4 of Ephesians says
[1:20:57] and that you put on the new man which is
[1:21:00] created in righteousness and true
[1:21:02] holiness
[1:21:03] now I'm establishing you if the word of
[1:21:06] God because this isn't something I said
[1:21:10] about you this isn't something your mama
[1:21:13] said about you this isn't something
[1:21:16] brother Branham said about you this is
[1:21:18] something God said about you
[1:21:21] and that's where your faith has got a
[1:21:24] rasp is in the eternal Word of God now
[1:21:30] this new creation is not of the old
[1:21:32] creation that creates and fell and it's
[1:21:36] not one that's made over we've got to
[1:21:38] the other one and made it into something
[1:21:40] else
[1:21:40] it couldn't be called a creative new
[1:21:42] creation but it's what it is it is
[1:21:45] exactly what it says it's a new creation
[1:21:48] a - another creation distinct from the
[1:21:52] past distinct from the old one because
[1:21:56] the old one doesn't have a shred of
[1:21:58] claim on the new creation hallelujah
[1:22:03] a man he don't deal with us in this
[1:22:06] creation like he dealt with Abraham
[1:22:08] amount of Abraham's issue would come a
[1:22:11] godly soul a lineage but now it's not
[1:22:14] this Abraham and Abraham's race and the
[1:22:17] fleshly lineage but now from his issue
[1:22:20] by the Holy Spirit a man out of every
[1:22:25] kindred and tribe and nation he has
[1:22:28] purposed for himself on new creation and
[1:22:31] he's the first of that new creation he
[1:22:34] was God created in the form of map and
[1:22:37] now by his Spirit he's created many sons
[1:22:41] unto himself God the Creator created
[1:22:46] himself a part of his creation
[1:22:49] Ephesians 1:15 I'd like to look at this
[1:22:53] because it's here we're going to draw
[1:22:55] our foundation for our message today
[1:22:58] therefore always I always have to hurry
[1:23:02] your faith in the Lord Jesus and your
[1:23:05] love for all the Saints do not cease to
[1:23:08] give thanks for you making mention of
[1:23:10] you in my prayers that the god of our
[1:23:13] Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory
[1:23:15] may give you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:23:18] revelation and the knowledge of him
[1:23:21] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:23:23] lightened that you might know what is
[1:23:25] the hope of his calling and what are the
[1:23:28] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:23:29] in the Saints and what is exceeding
[1:23:33] greatness of his power
[1:23:34] toward us who believe according to the
[1:23:36] working of his mighty power which he
[1:23:39] brought worked in Christ when he raised
[1:23:41] him from the dead and seated him at his
[1:23:44] own right hand in the heavenly places
[1:23:46] for above all principalities and power
[1:23:51] and might and Dominion and every name
[1:23:54] that is named not only in this age but
[1:23:58] in that which is to come now I want you
[1:24:02] to notice of this new creation where is
[1:24:05] he placed he is placed to be therefore
[1:24:10] above all principalities and power and
[1:24:15] might and Dominion and every name you
[1:24:19] just think of it whatever name you want
[1:24:23] to say whatever sin you want to say
[1:24:24] whatever disease you want to say
[1:24:27] whatever sickness you want to say Amen
[1:24:30] every one of them every name that is
[1:24:33] named not only for them but for now not
[1:24:37] only for that age but for this age
[1:24:40] hallelujah PO uses the word
[1:24:42] principalities and power to describe
[1:24:45] demons and evil spirits he uses the same
[1:24:48] terminology later in in his letter in
[1:24:52] verse 12 of chapter 6 and several we do
[1:24:54] not wrestle against flesh and blood but
[1:24:56] against principalities against powers
[1:25:00] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:25:02] this age against spiritual hosts of
[1:25:06] wickedness in heavenly places
[1:25:09] so you see Paul is showing us showing us
[1:25:13] that Jesus sits on the right hand of the
[1:25:17] Father and he is far above every evil
[1:25:20] spirit or ever demon or ever fallen
[1:25:25] angel or any kind of spirits of being or
[1:25:29] evil being that exists come on now he is
[1:25:33] seated far above
[1:25:36] our powers hey man now you know in a
[1:25:40] kingdom being seated by the right hand
[1:25:42] of the king is the highest position
[1:25:44] available hey man there's no higher rent
[1:25:47] than this and since the kingdom of God
[1:25:50] is the greatest Kingdom and since
[1:25:53] there's no authority in existence that
[1:25:55] is higher than God then we know that be
[1:25:58] seated at his right is to be in a place
[1:26:00] of unmatched authority this is where the
[1:26:05] new creation is placed with honor
[1:26:08] Master Authority Amen Jesus has absolute
[1:26:13] unconditional authority over every demon
[1:26:18] over ever sin over ever sickness
[1:26:23] hallelujah amen Philippians two and five
[1:26:27] says let the mind that being you which
[1:26:29] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[1:26:32] the form of God thought it not robbery
[1:26:34] to be equal with God but made himself of
[1:26:37] no reputation took it upon him the form
[1:26:39] of a servant was made in the likeness of
[1:26:42] men and being found in the fashion of
[1:26:45] man he humbled himself and became
[1:26:47] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:26:50] the cross a man oh what a day that was
[1:26:54] when God watched earth that had been
[1:26:58] cursed possessed by another men by the
[1:27:03] will of a man who walked down to the
[1:27:06] River Jordan in obedience to the will of
[1:27:09] the father to be filled with the Holy
[1:27:12] Ghost are you with me
[1:27:15] amen look now wherefore God has highly
[1:27:20] exalted him and gave him a name which is
[1:27:24] above every name that at the name of
[1:27:29] Jesus ever needs a bath of things in
[1:27:33] heaven of things on the earth and things
[1:27:37] under the earth hey man I don't care
[1:27:40] where the devil's hiding
[1:27:43] I don't care where he's hiding today
[1:27:45] he's got a bow my knee baby's there
[1:27:49] Shona fighting in heaven over our
[1:27:52] position he's got a bow if he's here on
[1:27:55] the earth tormenting you he's got a bali
[1:27:57] he's in hell he's got acknowledged the
[1:28:00] name of Jesus every knee has to bow a
[1:28:04] man then at the name of Jesus every knee
[1:28:07] should bow in things in heaven thins and
[1:28:10] earth things under the earth and that
[1:28:12] every tongue should confess that Jesus
[1:28:15] Christ is Lord ruler King with authority
[1:28:22] and power to the glory of God the Father
[1:28:26] hallelujah every devil every cancer ever
[1:28:30] affliction every demon he's got about
[1:28:34] the knee to this name and obey no
[1:28:39] exceptions no matter how big the name no
[1:28:43] matter I feared the name no matter how
[1:28:45] many others he's tapping over this Lord
[1:28:49] of ours is champion of champions he is
[1:28:52] Lord of lords his name is above all
[1:28:55] names his name every demon house to bow
[1:28:59] and every tongue has to confess that he
[1:29:01] indeed is the ruler
[1:29:05] he rules over Sam he rules over sickness
[1:29:09] he rules over disease he rules over
[1:29:12] every demon power named him he has to
[1:29:16] bow to the faith of Jesus Christ and
[1:29:20] acknowledge Hebrew Ephesians 1:20 says
[1:29:35] which he walked worked in Christ when he
[1:29:38] raised him from the dead and seated him
[1:29:41] at a sauna at his right hand in heavenly
[1:29:44] places far above all principalities and
[1:29:48] power and might and Dominion and every
[1:29:52] name that is named not only in this age
[1:29:56] but also that which is to come a man we
[1:30:01] know now we know that spiritual things
[1:30:05] are just as real as physical things a
[1:30:09] man let me say that again
[1:30:12] we know that spiritual things are just
[1:30:15] as real as physical things we know that
[1:30:18] spiritual things are superior due to
[1:30:21] physical things for God a spirit created
[1:30:26] all physical things so we know that
[1:30:31] greater is He that is in us then he that
[1:30:36] is in the world
[1:30:37] we know that the greater one is the
[1:30:40] master of sickness he's the master of
[1:30:44] disease he's a master of weaknesses hey
[1:30:47] man now but you you know we many times
[1:30:51] wouldn't you say but that was just for
[1:30:53] Jesus but I want to remind you that it
[1:30:58] was not just for Jesus Jesus Jesus came
[1:31:02] as the head of the new creation for
[1:31:07] there to be many brethren
[1:31:12] hey ma'am this will you see I mean he'll
[1:31:15] already had all of this him as as God he
[1:31:19] becomes man to become the captain of our
[1:31:23] salvation
[1:31:24] I meant to lead us into deliverance to
[1:31:29] give us the victory over sin over death
[1:31:33] over hell over the grave I'm not over
[1:31:37] sickness over disease hey man now I want
[1:31:43] you to as we stop here just for a minute
[1:31:45] and pause on this because well again I
[1:31:48] want to go back and just realize again
[1:31:51] that spiritual things are more real than
[1:31:54] the physical things because every
[1:31:57] physical thing was made from the
[1:31:59] spiritual hey man the Bible said things
[1:32:04] that are made were made but things that
[1:32:06] are not seen hey man so therefore in the
[1:32:11] word which who which which could only be
[1:32:13] seen by the eyes of faith that's the
[1:32:16] only way it can be seen the natural
[1:32:17] senses don't declare the earthly man
[1:32:19] doesn't declare God that's why we're not
[1:32:23] looking for our earth live census to
[1:32:25] declare God we're looking for faith to
[1:32:28] declare him a man now so you see as we
[1:32:33] have read it now I just want to get it

[1:33:43] once weren't walked according to the
[1:33:45] course of this world according to the
[1:33:47] Prince of the power of the air the
[1:33:49] spirit that now works in the sons of
[1:33:51] disobedience among whom we all once
[1:33:55] conducted ourselves and the lusts of our
[1:33:57] flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[1:33:59] flesh and of the mind and we're by
[1:34:01] nature the children of Wrath just as the
[1:34:04] other oh but I like this amen oh my this
[1:34:09] man is high this is a kind of a bleak
[1:34:11] deal we we all look at the love where we

[1:34:16] less fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[1:34:17] and of the mind and words as children of
[1:34:20] Wrath but that's not the end of the
[1:34:22] story but God God I was diving sin but
[1:34:33] God I was sick with disease
[1:34:38] [Music]
[1:34:42] hallelujah don't you realize Church what
[1:34:45] it all is and some of you were doomed to
[1:34:49] death a man who is rich in mercy whose
[1:34:55] mercy that ran out whose mercy is for
[1:34:59] guests day and age in this moment at
[1:35:02] this time that disservice God who is
[1:35:06] rich in mercy for the great love

[1:35:54] Christ you are enthroned and ruling from
[1:36:00] the nether dimension over sin over
[1:36:03] sickness over evil it's not just him
[1:36:11] sitting on the throne that's the first
[1:36:15] of the new creation
[1:36:16] but everyone recreated in Christ Jesus
[1:36:20] sits on the throne with him hallelujah
[1:36:29] as believers we're in the same seat of
[1:36:33] authority that Jesus occupies we are
[1:36:39] with Christ and we are also in Christ
[1:36:42] this is a place that is far above every
[1:36:46] demon ever fallen angel every evil
[1:36:50] spirit and even Lucifer himself
[1:36:55] that's where you're seated over every
[1:37:00] devil over every sickness over every
[1:37:07] disease named him you're higher than him
[1:37:13] [Applause]
[1:37:22] you got more authority than him you got
[1:37:27] more rights than him now
[1:37:33] just as Adam was given dominion over
[1:37:36] every living creature in Eden God has
[1:37:39] chosen to give us his beloved children
[1:37:42] in this new creation a level of
[1:37:44] authority in the spirit realm that is
[1:37:47] above ever created thing somehow another
[1:37:52] you missed that let me go it's over it
[1:37:55] again just as Adam was given dominion
[1:37:59] over every living creature in either in
[1:38:03] this new creation you are also given
[1:38:08] dominion over everything created well
[1:38:15] I'm trying to tell you you are the
[1:38:17] highest order in this creation and
[1:38:22] there's nothing of the old creation that
[1:38:25] is higher than you are not a devil not a
[1:38:29] sickness not a problem not a
[1:38:31] circumstance nothing it's greater than
[1:38:36] where you're sitting for your enthroned
[1:38:39] on this round and your reign from the
[1:38:43] spirit realm
[1:38:44] you're not just of this flesh but you're
[1:38:47] bringing the stress under obedience to
[1:38:50] the Word of God and sickness comes and
[1:38:53] we bring it to obedience a man in sin
[1:38:56] comes and we bring it to opinion that
[1:38:58] temptation come and we bring it to
[1:39:01] obedience because we are a people of
[1:39:04] Dominion we are sin has no power over
[1:39:23] sickness has no power over us
[1:39:26] [Applause]
[1:39:38] the Bible said you are seated there you
[1:39:43] look at the tints of the birds this is
[1:39:45] not something that will happen in the
[1:39:47] future
[1:39:48] this is not something will happen in the
[1:39:50] Millenium this does not say we will be
[1:39:53] seated it says we're already seated this
[1:39:57] is something that has already happened
[1:39:59] and then we are all the new creation and
[1:40:03] we've already been given authority that
[1:40:06] is far above every enemy for above all
[1:40:10] principality and power and might and
[1:40:14] Dominion and every name that is named
[1:40:17] not only in this age but also in that
[1:40:20] wage which is to come we have been given
[1:40:24] Dominion it comes with the new creation
[1:40:29] to Adam he would say you're the highest
[1:40:33] order of creation you're my son I give
[1:40:37] you Dominion to you he says you're the
[1:40:40] highest order of my new creation and I
[1:40:44] give you Dominion hallelujah we have an
[1:40:51] absolute unconditional authority over
[1:40:55] all demons we are in a position that is
[1:41:00] far above them we are though even the
[1:41:03] most powerful and highest rankin we are
[1:41:08] above I mean NEVER powerful and
[1:41:10] highest-ranking forces of evil we're
[1:41:12] above every one of them and this this
[1:41:15] Bible said explicitly says
[1:41:17] principalities and powers and never name
[1:41:20] that is named and he had put all things
[1:41:23] under his feet and given him to be head
[1:41:26] over the church which is his body the
[1:41:29] fullness of him who fills all in all so
[1:41:32] all things are under the feet of Jesus
[1:41:36] Jesus is a head of the church the church
[1:41:39] is his body
[1:41:40] the feet are part of the body
[1:41:42] and all things are under his feet so all
[1:41:46] things are under his body so all things
[1:41:49] are under the church so no wonder he
[1:41:52] said I give you power to tread on
[1:41:54] scorpions and serpents and over all the
[1:41:59] power of the enemy you and the God of
[1:42:06] peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
[1:42:12] hallelujah the Bible you need to believe
[1:42:15] this because it's the Bible and it's the
[1:42:18] truth it's truth whether you realize it
[1:42:20] or not whether you believe it or not I
[1:42:25] mind if you choose to believe it then
[1:42:27] you can you will be enjoying the
[1:42:29] benefits of it brother Branham tells us

[1:42:41] you it has placed you in a position of
[1:42:43] authority it is a free gift that comes

[1:42:52] comes with your birthright a man forever
[1:42:56] born again child of God sits with him in
[1:42:59] power and authority I don't care if you
[1:43:04] were born again with him yesterday
[1:43:05] all right happens today the moment you
[1:43:09] are born again you sit with him in
[1:43:11] authority and power over sin over all
[1:43:17] the works of the devil I'm explaining to
[1:43:21] you that right now you are more than a
[1:43:23] conqueror hallelujah I'm telling you
[1:43:26] right now you're not going to be
[1:43:27] conquered you were sent here to talk I
[1:43:30] am an authority over the devil and
[1:43:33] demons is not something we're working
[1:43:35] toward it'll not something that's
[1:43:37] limited for profits or preachers a man
[1:43:41] it's not a goal or a target that we're
[1:43:43] trying to reach it is true right this
[1:43:46] very minute it is already so
[1:43:50] hi man we don't have to work for it we
[1:43:53] don't have to pray it down I mean it was
[1:43:56] given us too as a gift and God gave it
[1:43:59] to us because of his great love he had
[1:44:01] for us a man not because of the
[1:44:05] hard-working holy living hallelujah
[1:44:10] putting your faith in Jesus there's
[1:44:13] several things happen one thing you are

[1:44:24] you are your diplay righteous and holy
[1:44:26] by God our Father in Romans 5:1
[1:44:29] therefore having been justified or
[1:44:32] declared righteous by faith we have
[1:44:36] peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[1:44:38] Christ the Bible says the righteous one
[1:44:42] shall live by faith they have a faith
[1:44:46] sense they have the ability to believe
[1:44:49] every born-again child of God he is a
[1:44:52] believer he believes that the days of
[1:44:56] miracles are never past he believes that
[1:44:59] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:45:01] and forever
[1:45:02] he believes whatever God says in his
[1:45:05] word he believes it hey man so you see

[1:45:32] beyond the natural man now we are just
[1:45:37] as righteous as Jesus
[1:45:44] hello everybody we are just his
[1:45:48] righteous as Jesus but Jesus never sent
[1:45:52] neither did you in this new creation

[1:45:58] a man the sea cannot sin it abides in
[1:46:03] him a man you you're talking about this
[1:46:07] which is still of the first creation but
[1:46:09] that which is of the new creation it
[1:46:11] don't doubt it don't fear a man it don't
[1:46:16] get confused
[1:46:17] it believes it's a believer hallelujah
[1:46:23] are you with me now you see you see
[1:46:26] Jesus this is what G's made Jesus
[1:46:29] fearless he knew he was righteous man he
[1:46:33] knew Satan had no claim on him the
[1:46:37] prince of this world has come and he had
[1:46:39] no claim on me
[1:46:40] a man so does he had no power over him
[1:46:44] he only can have power over those he has
[1:46:47] a claim over and he doesn't have a claim
[1:46:50] on you because you've been born again
[1:46:52] you're a child of God he can't claim you
[1:46:54] as yours as his child you were his child
[1:46:56] by your first birth but you're not a
[1:46:58] child anymore you are new creation in
[1:47:02] Christ you are born again believer and
[1:47:06] you are righteous as Jesus was righteous
[1:47:09] and holy as Jesus was holy God this
[1:47:16] might have me a runaway Amen but I'm
[1:47:19] talking about who you are because when
[1:47:22] the prat realizes her position the
[1:47:24] rapture will come wouldn't you realize
[1:47:26] the devil has no claim on me he has no
[1:47:29] right to me he has no right to my mind
[1:47:31] he has no right to my body he has no
[1:47:34] right to my soul I don't belong to him I
[1:47:37] not a slave to sin I'm not a slave to
[1:47:40] disease I'm not a slave to sickness I am
[1:47:44] NOT a slave did you hear me I am NOT a
[1:47:47] slave
[1:47:50] I don't belong to the devil I've been
[1:47:54] the original evolved JVM
[1:47:56] but because I was sold in the sin I
[1:47:59] wasn't intended to be that way but I was
[1:48:01] sold in the sentient but Jesus came and
[1:48:04] redeem me and it ain't my right and I am
[1:48:08] free son I've made free is free indeed
[1:48:13] hallelujah I declare you free from sin
[1:48:17] free from sickness today are you free
[1:48:21] from the power of ever demon spirit
[1:48:31] I can stand as fearlessly in the
[1:48:42] presence of Satan as Jesus did
[1:48:48] [Applause]
[1:48:51] hallelujah and I can use my family name
[1:48:55] to kick him out
[1:48:57] [Applause]
[1:49:00] because I have been given via power of
[1:49:04] attorney to use his name because he
[1:49:08] named me so I'm his child we can stand
[1:49:18] as fearlessly in the presence of Satan
[1:49:22] as Jesus stood fearlessly in the
[1:49:26] presence of Satan you see sin makes
[1:49:29] cowards of men but when we realize we're
[1:49:32] the possessors of righteousness the
[1:49:35] righteousness of God then we know we are
[1:49:38] God and we know we have God in us and we
[1:49:42] can spend fearlessly in the presence of
[1:49:44] Satan and command him and he has to obey
[1:49:54] righteousness is the ability of God
[1:49:57] taking possession in us we not only
[1:50:01] stand in the presence of Satan
[1:50:03] fearlessly but we stand before the
[1:50:06] throne of God fearlessly because we are
[1:50:10] conscious of the fact that we are his
[1:50:12] children and then we are born of the new
[1:50:16] creation created by God himself and
[1:50:19] Jesus has given us the power of attorney
[1:50:21] to use his name and act in his stead and
[1:50:24] he said in my name he shall cast out
[1:50:27] devils if we can cast him out we can do
[1:50:30] undo everything he's done we can cast
[1:50:33] him down if we can cast him down we can
[1:50:36] destroy his strongholds we can break in
[1:50:39] a bone
[1:50:39] in fearlessly that will mean his
[1:50:41] destruction in our victory how many's
[1:50:44] ready to have victory over the devil
[1:50:46] this is a day of victory
[1:50:49] a man I'm preaching about a bride who's
[1:50:53] and stick with the word who knows who
[1:50:55] they are
[1:50:56] who is that adopted sons and daughters
[1:50:58] of God who have been positioned and
[1:51:00] ordained and called for this hour to
[1:51:04] meet the devil in his own Eden and he
[1:51:07] can't make us do what he wants us to do
[1:51:13] hallelujah we could be right here in
[1:51:16] signal listen in the first Eden Adam
[1:51:20] could walk with God and there the devil
[1:51:23] had no power over him until he took sin
[1:51:26] nature then power came upon him Amen but
[1:51:30] friends when sin nature is gone and the
[1:51:33] Holy Ghost is there the devil has no
[1:51:35] more power over you you no longer have
[1:51:39] to do what he says
[1:51:40] you say you say you speak you say and
[1:51:45] it'll be done hey man now so therefore
[1:51:51] you are righteous do you believe it
[1:51:55] amen the Bible said that he became our
[1:51:59] sin that we might become his
[1:52:02] righteousness is that the Bible that you
[1:52:07] are the righteousness of God because he
[1:52:10] took your sin another thing you are
[1:52:12] spiritually born again and that was the
[1:52:16] new doctrine of the Old Testament Old
[1:52:19] Testament all heard the New Testament
[1:52:21] the Old Testament had but one birth are
[1:52:23] you with me that's why a child that was
[1:52:26] born an ass with a sinful occasion under
[1:52:29] adultery couldn't enter into the
[1:52:30] congregation Lord for didn't generation
[1:52:32] but that's not so in this generation
[1:52:34] that's not so under this covenant we got
[1:52:37] a greater blood than that and then we
[1:52:42] got a greater blood than that and then
[1:52:44] we've got a new birth now they only had
[1:52:46] one birth you had to be born in a
[1:52:48] certain lineage under a certain way in a
[1:52:50] certain type and that's way that you you
[1:52:53] know you had to be born to to be
[1:52:55] accepted in the kingdom but not in this
[1:52:57] one
[1:52:57] it's not a natural birth it's a
[1:53:00] spiritual birth and I don't care how
[1:53:03] naturally you were born amen this Holy
[1:53:05] Ghost come down breeze out all the coal
[1:53:08] that gives you the titles eternal life
[1:53:10] and nothing can separate you from the
[1:53:12] love of God in Christ Jesus and it can't
[1:53:15] keep you out of a rapture it can't keep
[1:53:17] you keep you from any promise of God it
[1:53:22] is yours the cause of your fire it's
[1:53:25] your inheritance it belongs to you
[1:53:33] the new creation makes us the children
[1:53:36] of Almighty God God is our Father we are
[1:53:40] his children
[1:53:42] you were you were the Bible said in John
[1:53:47] 1:12 but as many as received him having
[1:53:50] to received him then they then he gave
[1:53:53] the right to become the children of God
[1:53:55] to those that believe on his name Amen
[1:53:58] so everyone that received him is born of
[1:54:01] him if you're born of him you I'm you
[1:54:03] have a right to all that heaven is you
[1:54:07] have a right to the inheritance you have
[1:54:09] the right to the throne you have a right
[1:54:12] to Dominion and then you were given
[1:54:16] citizenship with full rights into the
[1:54:18] kingdom of God Ephesians 2:19 says now
[1:54:22] therefore you are no longer strangers
[1:54:24] and foreigners but fellow-citizens with
[1:54:29] the Saints and members of the household
[1:54:32] of God how great is that a man you have
[1:54:38] been given a citizenship with full
[1:54:40] rights into the kingdom of God because
[1:54:44] you're the family of God you're not only
[1:54:46] in the kingdom as a lower a lower person
[1:54:49] you are the royal family Amen you are
[1:54:52] the sons of God I mean you are the
[1:54:55] children of the Most High King you have
[1:54:59] been placed in a position our seat of
[1:55:03] authority that is higher than any
[1:55:05] created being for he says in Ephesians
[1:55:09] 2:6 he has raised us up together and
[1:55:11] made us a sit together in the heavenly
[1:55:16] places in Christ Jesus a man that puts
[1:55:20] every one of us on shouting grounds
[1:55:22] right now
[1:55:23] are you with me Amen every one of us can
[1:55:26] be on shouting grounds because wherever
[1:55:29] he's sitting we're sitting whatever he
[1:55:32] rules over we're ruling over to a man
[1:55:36] his power is our power
[1:55:38] his name is our name his authority is
[1:55:42] our authority his kingdom is our kingdom
[1:55:45] [Applause]
[1:55:46] hallelujah let your kingdom come and
[1:55:49] your will be done in this earth as it is
[1:55:51] in heaven let me bring this body setting
[1:55:55] to what the Word of God says hey man the
[1:56:00] Bible said in Colossians 2:15 and having
[1:56:03] spoiled principalities and powers he
[1:56:05] made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:56:07] over them so you see he spoiled
[1:56:11] principalities and powers and made a
[1:56:15] shoe or show of them openly triumphant
[1:56:19] and then you raise you up on the throne
[1:56:21] with him to rule and reign with him and
[1:56:24] then all this took place the instant you
[1:56:27] received his Holy Spirit amen so when
[1:56:31] the Holy Ghost came this Dominion came
[1:56:33] you with it
[1:56:34] it's something that is given to every
[1:56:36] child every son and daughter of God it
[1:56:39] is an act of his goodwill his grace his
[1:56:43] mercy a man and you did not work to earn
[1:56:47] it it came as a result of your faith in
[1:56:51] Jesus Christ is a free gift is an
[1:56:54] endowment on every child of God Alleluia
[1:56:59] oh brother Branham would say in God
[1:57:02] hiding himself in simplicity he taught
[1:57:05] he talked about the bud and he compared
[1:57:08] it with bleach and he said the blood of
[1:57:11] the Old Testament was little more like a
[1:57:12] paint that just just covered over the
[1:57:15] sin the sin was there but it was hidden
[1:57:17] behind the paint God couldn't see it
[1:57:20] because the blood the animal that atoned
[1:57:21] but he said not this blood this blood is
[1:57:25] not a paint this blood is a bleach
[1:57:28] and this blood it might when applied to
[1:57:31] sin it changes the chemistry a mile all
[1:57:36] the way back until you can't find it you
[1:57:40] can't see it it's not there no more
[1:57:44] I know there used to be something
[1:57:46] written on that wall but it's not there
[1:57:48] no more the bleach took care of it I
[1:57:51] know there was sin written all over that
[1:57:54] man but it ain't there no more the beach
[1:57:57] took care of it hallelujah
[1:58:01] man and it changed every molecule of it
[1:58:04] and it changed it by the benzene seems
[1:58:07] it down to the mediators all the way
[1:58:10] back until your sins land on the head of
[1:58:13] Satan
[1:58:15] so your accuser is packing your sins
[1:58:21] it's not your sins anymore it's their
[1:58:24] sins and you are free hallelujah I said
[1:58:30] you're free and it's not you going to
[1:58:34] hell for your sins it is going to hell
[1:58:38] to the lake of fire for your sins
[1:58:49] so you're the righteousness of God you
[1:58:53] see as he said what's the matter with
[1:58:56] the church had to explain about the
[1:58:57] blood and the blood of this covenant he
[1:58:59] soon there's something wrong my opinion
[1:59:01] we're not coming with the sincerity the
[1:59:03] right thing for that if God could do
[1:59:06] that by the blood of bulls and goats
[1:59:07] which he created created flies and fleas
[1:59:11] and and and and and all of those things
[1:59:14] had called up frogs from there by Moses
[1:59:16] and the blood of bulls and goats and man
[1:59:19] and that only covered Sam they made a
[1:59:20] perpetuation for the sinner but the sin
[1:59:23] was still there only covered over what
[1:59:25] can he do through the blood of his son
[1:59:29] that omits sin and God takes not a
[1:59:32] manufactured bleach but he created a
[1:59:35] blood that takes all sins away and mark
[1:59:39] 11:24 here's where it puts you in
[1:59:41] standing a man understands sitting on
[1:59:45] the throne is not just a sit down job to
[1:59:50] sit on the throne means you are ruling
[1:59:53] [Applause]
[1:59:55] somebody get it it means you are
[1:59:58] actively ruling you are commanding and
[2:00:02] expecting this to happen you are telling
[2:00:06] the demo where to go and he has to obey
[2:00:09] you are changing circumstances you are
[2:00:14] bringing everything septic to the Word
[2:00:17] of God
[2:00:18] hey man and so Deborah you stand he said
[2:00:21] it and he says it takes away all sin and
[2:00:24] mark 11:24 whatever you say now here
[2:00:28] you're on the throne where whatever you
[2:00:31] say to this mountain move and don't
[2:00:34] doubt in your heart but believe what you
[2:00:37] said will come to pass you can have what
[2:00:40] you said Oh where's the Pentecostal
[2:00:43] church at today and then you don't
[2:00:45] realize that confess truly confessed sin
[2:00:51] a missing
[2:00:53] and then if there's no admit to it it
[2:00:55] builds a bridge across the chasm that
[2:00:57] takes a man back in the presence of his
[2:01:00] creator and then makes him a son of God
[2:01:04] brother Branham would later say about
[2:01:06] this very thing and he says and it takes
[2:01:09] even the cows of the way don't ever even
[2:01:13] remember anything between you and him
[2:01:19] the chasms even gone where you were
[2:01:24] separated man and God was separated by
[2:01:27] sin egg man it takes a man back into the
[2:01:30] presence of his creator makes him a son
[2:01:33] of God a man he that believeth on me the
[2:01:35] works that I do shall he do also there
[2:01:38] you are
[2:01:38] verily I say to you if you see this
[2:01:41] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[2:01:43] your heart but believe what you said
[2:01:45] will come to pass you can have what you
[2:01:48] said nor that God is my God revealing
[2:01:51] himself in humility God taken a humble
[2:01:54] sinner and cleansing him by his blood
[2:01:58] and drop him that confess sin into that
[2:02:01] Clorox bleach of the blood of the Son of
[2:02:04] God and putting his own life into that
[2:02:07] man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:09] then he said we got the genuine baptism
[2:02:12] of the Holy Ghost what's wrong with us
[2:02:14] when the type when Elijah dropped the
[2:02:17] robe for Elijah he got a double portion
[2:02:20] of it Jesus said the works that I do
[2:02:22] shall you do also and greater than this
[2:02:26] show you do for I go to my father what's
[2:02:28] wrong Church then he says the sky is
[2:02:36] full of genuine Pentecostal power that
[2:02:41] makes a man or woman a son and daughter
[2:02:44] of God it takes him back in the presence
[2:02:47] of God I know that people don't want
[2:02:49] that Pentecostal power but that's what's
[2:02:52] promised to the church you've got to get
[2:02:54] away from your own thoughts you got to
[2:02:56] get away
[2:02:57] let the mind oh is in Christ being you
[2:02:59] you have to stay there till ever sin of
[2:03:01] fear and Emerson up job has gone from
[2:03:04] your heart and if you're there and God
[2:03:07] doesn't take you and mitt your sins and
[2:03:10] Anna considering the presence of God
[2:03:13] there's something wrong with your
[2:03:14] experience your sins are confessed and
[2:03:17] in the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:03:19] you stand unadulterated a born-again son
[2:03:23] and daughter of God with the life of God
[2:03:26] in you to speak a word of creation let
[2:03:30] this mountain be moved and it will mind
[2:03:33] you now but you know it's possible it is
[2:03:39] possible for sons of God daughters of
[2:03:43] God born by the Spirit of God to have a
[2:03:46] position of authority and not know how
[2:03:50] to use it brother Brennan said and God
[2:03:53] of this evil ages that when the whole
[2:03:55] word of God into our word of God him
[2:03:57] complete was headed up in the human body
[2:03:59] called Jesus Christ and their God made
[2:04:03] me pay for my sins in him there then he
[2:04:06] rose me up raised me up with him in the
[2:04:08] resurrection and now we are seated with
[2:04:11] him with power and authority over every
[2:04:15] devil
[2:04:16] somebody say ever devil oh if you can
[2:04:20] only believe what God is given but if
[2:04:22] you're not seen in the air you don't
[2:04:23] have it and if you are seated there
[2:04:25] don't believe in afraid to move it you
[2:04:26] to move it you'll or to move you'll
[2:04:29] never use it
[2:04:30] but if you're seated there you will use
[2:04:33] it for you are deigned to do what you
[2:04:37] are to do how many believes in an
[2:04:41] ordained people a mass now let me just
[2:04:45] let me just share with you another
[2:04:46] quotation and we'll move on he says in
[2:04:50] question answers on the Hebrews all
[2:04:52] powers and heaven and earth is given on
[2:04:54] my hand going I'll be with you whatever
[2:04:55] you bind on earth I'll buy I'll bind in
[2:04:58] heaven what you loose on earth i loosed
[2:04:59] in heaven he's quoting Jesus oh if the
[2:05:01] great Holy Church only realize its power
[2:05:04] to do these things but there's so much
[2:05:07] doubt and fear and trembling and wonder
[2:05:09] if it will could it happen and as long
[2:05:11] as that exists the church can never
[2:05:13] stand upright
[2:05:14] and when ever talk of fear is vanished
[2:05:17] and the Holy Spirit is completely in
[2:05:19] control of the church then all fears are
[2:05:23] gone and that church has the power see
[2:05:25] what they have everything that heaven
[2:05:28] owns behind them they are ambassadors of
[2:05:32] the throne and absolutely an ambassador
[2:05:35] of the throne has the authority and
[2:05:37] everything Christ ohms belongs to that
[2:05:41] ambassador he said go into all the world
[2:05:43] you're my witness is that the Holy Ghost
[2:05:46] has come on you what is a witness it is
[2:05:48] the powers of heaven that's right in
[2:05:50] your hands he said all why do we sit and
[2:05:53] the church is barren and we set dormant
[2:05:58] is because we don't recognize these
[2:06:01] things hallelujah but I'm telling you
[2:06:07] friends there's a church that it's no
[2:06:10] longer barren she's under expectation
[2:06:14] I'm under expectation this morning I'm
[2:06:17] under expectation for God to come among
[2:06:20] us weep by His Holy Spirit drive out
[2:06:23] every demon power heal the sick cast out
[2:06:26] devils in his name and save the Lost
[2:06:29] that's the kind of God that I serve and
[2:06:31] I am announcing to the devil this
[2:06:34] morning a man that we are sitting on the
[2:06:37] place of authority and we know who we
[2:06:40] are there has been
[2:06:41] and given to a people in this last day
[2:06:44] you are not justified let's go back and
[2:07:08] look at Ephesians 1:15 hope you're not
[2:07:10] tired
[2:07:11] I got a ways to go we're canceling wins
[2:07:17] tonight so I'll bar sometimes from that
[2:07:18] if I mean it say that's brother
[2:07:22] Timothy's time he's not gonna be here
[2:07:28] coz we're dismissing Ephesians 1 15
[2:07:32] therefore I also after I heard of your
[2:07:35] faith in the Lord and your love for all
[2:07:37] the Saints do not cease to give thanks
[2:07:40] for you making mention of you in my
[2:07:43] prayers
[2:07:44] I'd like to hear Paul pray hears his
[2:07:49] prayer that the Lord that the god of our
[2:07:52] Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory
[2:07:55] may give to you the spirit of wisdom and
[2:07:59] revelation in the knowledge of him the
[2:08:02] eyes of your understanding being lighten
[2:08:05] that you may know what is a hope of his
[2:08:07] calling what is the riches of the glory
[2:08:09] of his inheritance in the Saints and
[2:08:12] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[2:08:14] power toward us who believe according to
[2:08:16] the working of his mighty power so know
[2:08:19] Paul's prayer I want you notice he is
[2:08:21] not praying God parappa your power or
[2:08:25] give the people more authority he is
[2:08:29] praying that the people their eyes would
[2:08:32] come open and the spirits will
[2:08:34] understand and be enlightened that they
[2:08:36] can realize what they already have a man
[2:08:41] we don't need to pray for no more faith
[2:08:44] Amen or more power or more authority
[2:08:48] that's actually praying unbelief I mean
[2:08:51] you don't believe what God gave you what
[2:08:53] the Bible says you have if we want to
[2:08:56] pray about this then we need to go to
[2:08:58] praying that God would help us to see
[2:09:00] what he's already given us and learn how
[2:09:04] to use the authority he's provided
[2:09:08] somebody with me now
[2:09:10] a man Colossians 1 and 12 given thanks

[2:09:22] Father who had given us the ability to
[2:09:24] enjoy our share of the inheritance of

[2:09:53] been known to tell the truth hey man I
[2:10:00] want you to look at the next verse what
[2:10:01] is that he had delivered us from the

[2:10:15] now sitting in a kingdom on a throne
[2:10:20] because in whom we have redemption
[2:10:22] through his blood even the forgiveness
[2:10:23] of sin and that's why we sit there
[2:10:26] because we're not we don't belong to the
[2:10:29] devil anymore and we have been

[2:11:01] darkness he has created you in Christ
[2:11:04] Jesus in your soul the nature of your
[2:11:07] soul has been your soul rather which is
[2:11:11] the nature of your spirit
[2:11:13] there has been an overshadowing of the
[2:11:16] Holy Ghost and when it does another son
[2:11:20] is born hallelujah now think about this
[2:11:26] now by the overshadowing of the Holy
[2:11:29] Ghost a sinless boy and on to us a child

[2:11:54] workmanship we are created in Christ
[2:11:56] Jesus to good works which God hath
[2:11:59] ordained before that we should walk in
[2:12:04] them God ordained me to walk in good
[2:12:10] works hallelujah
[2:12:13] Ephesians 4:22 we've read it that put
[2:12:16] off the former conversation the old man
[2:12:18] which is corrupt according to the
[2:12:20] deceitful lusts from me renewed in the
[2:12:23] spirit of your mind
[2:12:24] that you put on the new man which after
[2:12:26] God is created in righteousness hey man
[2:12:29] we put off the old man with his deeds
[2:12:32] perfect faith brother Branham says so
[2:12:34] when a man lives my faith and walks by
[2:12:38] faith
[2:12:39] I mean substance faith he is isolated
[2:12:43] from the entire world and becomes a new
[2:12:46] creature in Christ there you are getting
[2:12:49] into
[2:12:50] material see you're getting a rupturing
[2:12:54] condition now and now this is the
[2:12:59] mystery of the new creation we have come
[2:13:03] into bride material rapturing condition
[2:13:09] by the infusion of his life and his
[2:13:13] faith into us by the new birth I mean
[2:13:17] that's how we that's how we have perfect
[2:13:19] faith Amen it's attributed the gift of
[2:13:22] God the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost always
[2:13:26] has perfect faith it perfectly believes
[2:13:29] the word man we by being born of the
[2:13:32] Spirit are infused with his life and so
[2:13:35] therefore infused with his faith I want
[2:13:38] to ask you if you're born again what
[2:13:40] faith do you have well I've got weak
[2:13:43] faith not if you're born again I've got
[2:13:46] an align so faith not if you're born
[2:13:47] again I got just human trait not if
[2:13:50] you're born again let me read you what
[2:13:53] kind of fates you have Galatians 2:20 I
[2:13:57] am crucified with Christ can somebody
[2:14:00] say man a man nevertheless I live
[2:14:04] I mean he's living a man yet not i but
[2:14:06] Christ lives in me thereby here with me
[2:14:09] amen and the life which I now live in
[2:14:13] the flesh I live by the faith of the Son
[2:14:20] of God who loved me and gave himself for
[2:14:23] me I am living in the flesh the light
[2:14:29] for the Son of God and I have his faith
[2:14:34] dominating faith created
[2:14:38] paid that says the word is true this
[2:14:41] feels every child God with his
[2:14:43] righteousness
[2:14:44] it gives him direct access to the throne
[2:14:47] room to ask anything in his name
[2:14:51] a man and by the throne-room authority
[2:14:55] to demand any demon any sickness any
[2:14:59] disease to lead a man and his word is
[2:15:03] back all heaven is behind the word but
[2:15:06] Burt said the new creation the believer
[2:15:09] is given dominion over every spirit
[2:15:12] every sin every disease just as Adam did
[2:15:16] before the fall you know you got to take
[2:15:20] a look you got to take advantage of your
[2:15:21] legal rights before the throne you have
[2:15:25] the very same spirit that Jesus had you
[2:15:30] have the Holy Spirit as did the Apostles
[2:15:33] a man you possess his faith it is a
[2:15:37] faith that Jesus had but yet now it is
[2:15:40] your faith you have a right to it it
[2:15:44] belongs to you it's the faith of Christ
[2:15:47] you have eternal life you have the same
[2:15:50] righteousness that he had you have its
[2:15:53] value are his very own life in human
[2:15:58] dippel's and you should take advantage
[2:16:04] of your legal rights before the throne
[2:16:08] because you have the the same legal
[2:16:10] standing before God that Paul or any of
[2:16:13] the other apostles had a man God has
[2:16:18] made me greater than all of my enemies
[2:16:22] hallelujah
[2:16:23] look at your neighbor and tell'em God
[2:16:26] has made me greater than all of my
[2:16:30] enemies amen as Joshua had elders to put
[2:16:35] their feet on the neck of the Canaanite
[2:16:37] Kings remember them man he come against
[2:16:40] them that they came against somebody
[2:16:42] took the five kings throw them in the
[2:16:44] cave and said now we're going to fight
[2:16:46] all your defeat all your enemies but
[2:16:47] boys were coming back to deal with you a
[2:16:49] little
[2:16:50] and when the battle was over somebody
[2:16:53] helped me he pulled out all of those
[2:16:56] five kings of the game of knights and he
[2:17:00] said to tell you what I want you to do
[2:17:01] boys I want every one of the elders of
[2:17:03] Israel to take and put their foot on the
[2:17:06] neck of all of these kings and men
[2:17:10] because if you got your feet on the neck
[2:17:12] of the Kings you've got your feet on
[2:17:14] everything beneath them hallelujah amen
[2:17:23] so therefore and then if he set up a
[2:17:26] tread on serpents and scorpions and the
[2:17:29] God of peace will bruise Satan under my
[2:17:32] feet Satan did you hear me Satan the
[2:17:36] biggest the biggest king of them all
[2:17:38] Satan under my feet hallelujah God then
[2:17:43] has put my foot on the neck of the devil
[2:17:47] if I got my foot on the neck of the
[2:17:50] devil everything beneath him is under my
[2:17:53] feet every one of his sicknesses
[2:17:57] everyone is diseases every one of his
[2:18:00] I'm somebody every thing that devil is
[2:18:03] is represented in Lucifer and God has
[2:18:07] put Satan under your feet
[2:18:11] hallelujah I cannot be put to shame my
[2:18:16] sins are gone my weaknesses are routed
[2:18:19] the devil is on the run
[2:18:21] my past is forgiven in fact in this new
[2:18:24] creation I have no sinful past and no
[2:18:27] sin can be attributed to me to the life
[2:18:30] that I now live in Christ I cannot be
[2:18:33] put her shame and when the strength of
[2:18:35] God is mine I am here to put into action
[2:18:41] hallelujah faith in action becomes a
[2:18:43] verb and that Burgas will be I am a
[2:18:47] believer that's a noun but I believe
[2:18:50] that's a verb it's an action word I'm a
[2:18:53] time to use the word as a sword in my
[2:18:56] tongue somebody help me now wait a
[2:19:03] minute you know movie ho as men hold

[2:19:15] creation you held swords with a with a
[2:19:18] hand and this creation you hold a sword
[2:19:20] in your mouth yes and it is the Word of
[2:19:27] God and it is powerful and quicker than

[3:01:15] those wise men went to find the king
[3:01:17] because they saw the star and he said I
[3:01:20] believe there's some more wise men here
[3:01:23] on the earth that are seeing things
[3:01:24] other people can't see so they went to
[3:01:26] Jerusalem and asked nobody could see it
[3:01:28] nobody could tell him nobody knew
[3:01:30] anything about it but they said it's
[3:01:31] there we've seen it we witnessed it and
[3:01:33] he said what happened they had to get
[3:01:35] out from away from the doubters and the
[3:01:38] disbelievers so that God could appear to
[3:01:40] them again
[3:01:43] you say well these are leaving that is
[3:01:45] disbelief falling away from us you get
[3:01:49] ready to see more God to come on the
[3:01:51] scene why because disbelief is being
[3:01:54] pushed out a man that we can only
[3:01:57] believe all things are possible
