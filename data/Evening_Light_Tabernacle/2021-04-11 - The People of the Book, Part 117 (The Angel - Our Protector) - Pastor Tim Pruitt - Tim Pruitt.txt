offer ringing in his ears and some other issues from it our god's a gila amen we're the children of the most high god and until we get our theophany we have divine healing amen sickness comes sickness goes as long as we're in this flesh but one day we're going to change satan won't be able to touch our body no more because we'll have a redeemed one this one isn't redeemed yet it's got a deposit on

janice with us today and we want to welcome them they haven't been here in a while sickness comes troubles come but the lord is always gracious let's go to prayer this morning maybe you've got a desire in your heart you would say god come by my way and speak to me in a special way today father we're your children we have gathered it today in your name and we know where two or more gather you said you would be there in the midst so we can always count on it when we obey you and do what you said when we come together and gather and lord even as we see that day approaching and we forsake not this sembling of ourselves it's a promise a promise that has given us you'll meet with us i pray that you'll not only meet with us but every other person that is across the world today listening in down in the little homes and different places in south africa different places uh down in brazil and and down in south america and lord those in canada they can't meet in in church today and lord there are others in in across america that's got illness and sickness we hear of our brother george smith battling with cobit and been really really sick lord we pray for a special touch for him every hand that reached out to you i pray that you'll meet it today in the name of jesus christ amen and amen god bless you i'm going to let you take your seats thank you very much we appreciate you and we'll probably have you stand again in a moment to read the word but i've got a few little pastoral duties to express how much i love you and how much i appreciate you you are such a wonderful group of people and i want to thank you for uh helping me to host the the the past easter meetings and uh god has moved in a great way in a very special way and and i thank him for it i i tell you he he's god over every situation and i want to i want to encourage those that are you know in other places to just know that you know the revival is not even in light tabernacle it is not tim pruitt it is it is the holy spirit and he is he can be everywhere in the world you invite him to your church he'll be sure to show up because he keeps all of his appointments amen we heard some wonderful wonderful messages while that we were here we heard from of course our brother danny steeman and um he preached um a couple of wonderful messages there on dangerous and then of course the the last one was finishers amen he had he had them little catchy one-line titles but our one word titles and they were but it was wonderful messages that was behind those one words and we were so blessed by it and of course then we we heard a sermon that said from brother andrew spencer there ain't no grave going to hold my body down amen and we were so encouraged and blessed by that and lifted up amen and then we then we heard um from brother ron that same evening brother ron spencer morning is coming we believe that don't we amen we've already heard the prophet of god come out and say shalom amen it means the night is about over and now the morning star as it were that heralds the the coming of this son which is christ he's already went off the scene and is the the last messenger as it was i'm just typing there not necessarily meaning that it's exact but just just using it as a type for now that you know he's already moved off the scene and now the light is about to diffuse all the darkness amen as we move from glory and to glory and then we um then we of course it was finished up with brother danny steeman preaching on finishers i thought it was really neat brother kaelin singh from south africa a fellow minister pastor there he just kind of summed it up like this and he said he said this outpouring is dangerous for the devil knows ain't no grave going to hold the body down because morning is coming and the finishers are on the scene god bless you brother caitlin and the saints there and all of you there that are that catch our services they've been had their church they're not missing their church they don't have their church but they're just joining in with us and we're happy to have them with us as i as i said you know that that um the the um the revival that we are experiencing is not something that belongs to evening like tabernacle or is exclusive here but that revival lies in the promised land of the word of god and anywhere the word is preached you can have revival with signs and wonders and miracles and every other promise of god and my vision of course is that there would be a bride around the world i believe that that's the prophet's vision because he saw her from ever kindred tongue tribe and people and um you know we're here to help and assist but uh we're we're not here to to take the place of other pastors or ministries we're here just to edify the body of christ and and uh so we're we're trusting that that uh everybody can see that the move is on for the bride for that's thus saith the lord amen and that bride is around the world and you know this is not about building up a few mega churches or men's kingdoms kingdom building days are over with the rapture is at hand let me just encourage everybody today that the word is yours and it's in your grasp as a prophet of god that declared and i was there when he said it don't particularly remember it but i was there i got it from the tape later the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord and it hadn't stopped and the devil isn't big enough to stop it i hear brother branham saying in the deceived church by the world he said so revival in our day how can we have it when the revival regular revival giver is bound by the world god won't come in where the world is you can just depend on that you associate with the world then it's all of it when you let the world creep in you go to acting like the world then you're finished but when you cut loose ever fatter from the world and come to god and god will use you until you go to flirting again and here's the only hope that i have this morning to wind this my message up is this while samson was bound a new shock of hair growed out and he says then god sent us another church before the end time with the power of the holy spirit can come into it and to her in the demonstrations of the spirit and mark 16 can follow the church acts 2 4 acts 2 38 all of it will be followed right along with the church signs and wonders accompanying the apostles great signs of his resurrection accompany them while we're in prison surely god's growing a crop somewhere for the last great keel and and so again as we look at this this is brother branham's desire to see that revival around the world and that is our desire i want to just say again how much that we appreciate you and what you have done and uh you know every effort i got compliments on how well the services were conducted the altar calls the uh deacons and the assistance from them and uh the food that was prepared after service that where you send them home with their sack lunches and many other kept people in their homes and was so accommodating to those to give them a place to stay and and then um others who couldn't take people in they cooked good meals and brought them well to my house and to some others i know and really blessed um many of them that stayed and and it was a special help to me and sister karen sister karen has been so blessed to return to health and she can do the cooking around home and she made me my breakfast this morning as she does now all the time and many of the meals during the day but um that that little special help when you had a lot of guests we had three preachers and their wives and others in our home that was um with us so you know you you blessed us in a great way and and lightened our burden and i want to say thank you very much and god bless you let's give you a hand of applause this morning amen we appreciate you very much hallelujah thank you jesus praise the lord god is good all the time isn't he amen now as i've shared those moments why don't we stand and let's um just go to the lord and as we as we read the word we're going to go to exodus chapter 23 and we're going to verse 20. exodus chapter 23 and verse 20. behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way to bring thee into the place which i have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my uh for my name is in him verse 22 now but if thou will indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thy adversaries for mine angels shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites the hittites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the highvites and the jebusites and i will cut them off thou shalt not bow down to their gods now nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and ye shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land the number of days thy days i will fulfill i will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come and i will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto before thee unto thee and i will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the highlight the canaanite the high tide and are hittite and from before thee i will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little i will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land and i will set thy bounds from the red sea even unto the sea of the philistines from the desert unto the river i will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand thou shalt drive them out before thee thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods thou shalt not dwell in thy they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me for if thou serve their god it will surely be a snare unto thee amen may god bless his word today and just make it that word real to your heart amen is so important that we we believe and we receive the word of god amen now we're going to be speaking on today as we have been on the subject it's a very broad subject and actually i went through literally thousands of quotes studying them one at a time and categorizing them and making them into different topics on the angel of the lord and angel of the covenant so this morning we're going to be speaking on the angel our protector if you noticed in this passage of scripture that he read he said i will be an adversary to thy adversary and an enemy unto thy enemy now israel in the first exodus left egypt and they were led by the angel of the covenant who guarded and protected them all the way from egypt to the promised land i'd like to read from exodus chapter 14 and verse one you can read this chapter later because it contains a lot of what we're going to be speaking on this morning 14 and 15 as well and it says in the lord speaking to moses saying speaking to the children of israel that they turn and then camp before roth between middah and the sea over against baal zephan there before it it shall encamp by the sea for pharaoh will save the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness has shut them in and i will harden the heart the pharaoh's heart and he shall follow after them and i will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts that the egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did so now it was in the midst of a great victory that god's people had been literally thrust out of egypt for pharaoh had said get out go and worship your god you know leave my land and go worship and and of course israel had been down in egypt now for 400 years and they were there because of the jealousy toward a brother jealousy is an awful thing amen and and you know it causes a lot of different things it causes um hatred and and and covetousness it causes possessiveness and control and and all of those things it can it can destroy a home it can destroy a life it can destroy a marriage and but but however in this case he was destroying a family it was separating brothers um it would cause them to do murderous acts because of that where they would turn on one of their own and actually going to kill him and then would sell him as a slave and they and it was all because that joseph was a spiritual boy who had dreams and visions from god actually god would use joseph to foretell or prophesy of the coming messiah who would would also be loved of his father i'm speaking of jesus now but he would be hated of his brethren because of jealousy he would be rejected and crucified as i said you know jealousy can cause awful things even jealousies within churches jealousies and ministries we just stop and realize as john the baptist said when when they come and told him the disciples of jesus are is baptizing more than you and all the people are gathered to him and they've left you and he says no man can make of himself anything it's god that gives him positions and places if we could just only realize that even as ministries even as churches there would be no need for the turf wars and the fights and the feuds that goes on but nevertheless um they the the children of israel were now in bondage down into egypt though because of the brother's jealousy joseph was rejected because he was spiritual and he was hated without a cause and they should not have hated him they should have loved him and respected him but instead they were jealous of him and god it's true god dealt with him more than the wrath gifts and callings are without repentance they are something that god puts upon a life that you have as brother branham said it's a divine gift that i had nothing to do with it coming and and it's true with any other gift you really can't make yourself something that you're not you know you you have to be given the gift to be placed in your life and call of god and ordain for that position in place but of course um god gave him spiritual understanding and dreams and interpretations and he he could foretell things that would come to pass now you would think this would cause his brothers to admire him and love him but this provoked them to jealousy you know they call him names like your little holy roller or you think we're going to bow down to you one day when they heard of his dreams and visions and you know the these older brothers who were so great in their own sight they thought they would never ever have to bow down to this man you know but they did they sure did they pleaded for mercy even because but at this moment in time when we were talking about when they sold him down into egypt well he he hadn't come into power yet you see he was only just in the child form but you know let me just say prophecies grow up and when children grow up and a lot of times what you see even in a young ministry don't judge it too hard it'll grow up you know let god determine let god decide let god do the calling let god do the setting down because god raises up man and god sets men down there's a time that he will use them for his bride and then he will move them off the scene but it's not that god is through with his pride he's through using that ministry he wants that certain ministry there in that bride and working on her first season and helping her first season but he'll move him off the scene because he got somebody else that's going to move right into that position and so you know the jealousies of the brothers though caused them to all end up down in egypt now i just say to the brothers across the world today those that might be listening in or hear another time or you know you look on and perhaps you know you there's a little criticism because of our worship and our expression and you know you hear slander words try to slander you by calling you a pentecostal or holy roller they would in days gone by or all kinds of names that they try to make that a bad name and but i'll tell you it's not a bad name my my forefathers were pentecostals oh well i knew that about you brother tim i knew you come from a bunch of pentecostals yes i did i came from peter and james and john and paul amen i came from the upper room and that's where that might go back to in my ancestry amen because i came from there and i can't help it amen i can't help having the joy that's in my heart i can't help having the holy ghost move over me and it just breaks out in another language sometimes i can't help it amen because that's who i am so if you say well you're just pentecostal okay i'm just pentecostal not azusa street although there were some of my brothers in azusa street men like john g lake and men like ff bosworth and men uh men you know that would stand in their time in their dispensation there's also methodists in my background there's a john wesley and george whitefield and many many other men of god there's also lutheran in my background there was a a man by the name one of my kin folks is martin luther who said who broke the yoke of the catholic church and said the just shall live by faith amen but but brothers why get jealous you know you can have it too you know unlike unlike um joseph's brother they couldn't be born again they could only have a natural birth they could only have that naturally but you can have a supernatural birth that will bring back signs and wonders that it will get you away from your dried-eyed confessions your easy believism your shallow experience of just saying i believe the message therefore i got the holy ghost but you see men get dirty filthy jealous when they see god blessing the true bride with signs and wonders and miracles and when they see god vindicating himself watching god heal the sick and casting out devils and speaking with tongues and interpreting tongues are you with me prophesied and all the other gifts of the spirit gifts of healing and workings of miracles but they got to find some way to to because of the jealousy to stone them so they're going to try to find quotes that they can use as stones to kill the move of god this is no different than they did in ages gone by they did this to the pentecostal the azusa street they did this to to the ones there the methodists when they shouted they did this to martin luther they did this to our our forefathers abraham abraham isaac and jacob and all that claim to know the one true and living god amen they cast their stones they with their intellectual mind believe that they are more able to set a church in order better than what the holy spirit can do it amen yeah and i'm no church order don't think i don't i understand i've read it i've listened to it we adhere to it did you hear it what we have in this church is true church order amen and i know that things should be done decently in order but as brother branham said of the woman who washed jesus feet said she elbowed right through there she was going to get there regardless of how vowed she was oh i know it was out of order oh sure god help us to get out of here once in a while the trouble of it is you got too much order get out order i hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved amen that's what we're trying to do we're trying to get out of order long enough for people to get saved [Applause] hallelujah i remember when jesus saved me he said oh my i'll never forget it this little kentucky heart of mine was jumping 90 miles an hour and i wept and i cried and i shouted i didn't care who was standing around i wasn't paying attention to order i was in the presence of jesus and i loved him she wasn't noticing how much order she was in or how much she was out of the main thing was get to jesus there he sat with dirty feet he set without being kissed he wasn't welcome and she wanted to make him welcome she didn't care about their old pharisaic order or their old traditions or denominations she was pressing her way through to jesus god help us to have a revival like that where men and women will allow their their where men and women will elbow their way through the crowds and the denominations and the barriers to the kid in the presence of jesus i don't want to be that way this morning amen that there will be desperate souls that are just elbow their way through the crowd through the criticism through the unbelief through the darkness amen and get to jesus whatever you got to do just get to jesus [Music] now this of course caused the nation of israel to eventually go down to egypt where they became bondaged and then slavery and after joseph's death they settled down to egyptian ways and soon egyptian gods were thought more powerful than jehovah and as brother branham said and you can take a lot of things that i've already said this morning which i didn't quote from i mean i only quoted by memory from there but but they're from the third exodus where he says and where he continues on this same thought of how they got down into egypt they said we don't need the holy spirit to heal the sick we got doctors we don't need the holy spirit to speak with tongues we're all intelligent people and when you do you take right from your framework the lifeline jesus said them jews in this day haven't you read that the stone that was rejected is a chief cornerstone that all the building is setting upon now you see what i mean i'm sure you can catch that that's the reason of now they thought they would never have need of it we don't need speakers with tongues we don't need interpreters of tongues we know we no longer need the old testament prophets to set us in order by the holy spirit we understand it and they've adopted man-made systems to take the place of the holy spirit think about that this is a condition this is what takes a people a movement down to egypt to where they come to place we don't need speakers with tongues we don't need interpretation we're intelligent people now so he said therefore there's a people that's elected that's got their names on the lamb's book of life they can't go for that they are spiritual minded and therefore they can't go for that they can't stand it no matter if their fathers and mothers was lived in whatever organizational church maybe it wouldn't speak right out oh no they won't speak it right out but their actions prove it here is the word and the holy spirit speak it proves it's among those when he gets them gathered together that he still heals the sick and raises the dead and speaks with tongues and casts out devil so it depends on what's on the inside of a person the church feels they don't need the holy spirit the churches to tell you that and men can get up and give such an intellectual talk they can also also make you almost make you believe it now notice intellectual talks so smooth that it would deceive the people it's the gospel it's gospel it's men who can handle the word in such a way that he could almost take any intellectual person if you're just trusting in alex that would condemn the holy spirit and take that the way of man so you see they but there came a time that israel had to leave egypt they had to get out of that group of rejecters over into the promise before the messiah could ever manifest himself to him you see jesus had to come and there had to be a people there in that land to receive him when he come so they had to get out of that group of rejecters to get over into the promised land to get ready for the messiah to come isn't that what we got to do we got to leave the rejecters come on get back in the land of the bible amen get out of it get in the land of the bible are you with me now so the messiah can come because we are not typing anymore we are the anatype of all the types we are the fulfillment of all scripture he said a man he said he said a man a woman marry a man disagreeing with him it'd be some kind of fuss continually but when a man and his wife his girlfriend is a spouse when they are in perfect harmony like one soul and one mind because they're going to be one flesh then when the church can get such harmony with god until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride because they're going to be one hallelujah now you have to leave the land of boston physicians to be with the great physician you have to leave that bunch of people that believes the days of miracles are passed to be with people that believes that all things are possible to them that believe you have to leave egypt's bondage were were they had no signs to follow a pillar fire and a cloud you have to leave the muddy waters of the egyptian mile to drink from the fountain of living waters of the holy ghost that something that never runs dry you have to leave the leeks and the garlics of egypt to eat angels food from out of heaven are you with me amen so you we of us of us are special people who have been particularly called in this day that said come out of her my people come out of traditions come out of dead churches come out of the world get into christ get into the bible get in the promised land of the word of god we have been called for that purpose amen that's what this message calls us to now you wonder why hasn't there been a return before there's been 2 000 years of christianity there's been a lot of labor in the gospel a lot of denominations now a lot of books a lot of creeds a lot of different ideas how come why hasn't there been a return to the promised land of the bible until now genesis 15 16 tells us that he tell god tells abraham i can't give you this land now but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full now bear with me for a moment we have had great revivals of the past there's been the baptists the lutherans the methodists the nazarenes the pilgrim holiness and the pentecostals just to name a few of them the main ones and each have had their chance at the word the baptist would restore immersion the lutherans would restore justification by faith the methodists would would bring sanctification the nazarene shouting and the pilgrimage as holiness and the pentecostals the gifts of the spirit there have been great revivals of the past great moves of god and each one of them believed that this is the day this is the hour this is the time but they ran into roadblocks you know why because the iniquity of the amorites were not yet fulfilled and but god gives nations opportunities to repent before judgment the amorite nation had plenty of time to turn from their idolatry but they despised god's goodness and god's long suffering and refused to repent yeah they had witnesses they could they witnessed that the jehovah god of abraham they witnessed him they've given him a young a young son or son in his wife in his old age they saw the miracle they saw him leaving idolatry and come out to serve the one true and living god they would see it that in a time of famine that god would tell isaac stay in the land don't go out of the land and he stayed in the land and he sowed in the time of famine and in the time of famine he reaped a hundredfold isn't that amazing because a man stayed in the promised land he stayed in the word he got more by staying in the word in a time of famine that he could do it running down to egypt where they had the nile river to water their crops come on somebody amen this is a god who who vindicates his servants and he had vindicated the word over and over and over and over to them they had seen it now but in abraham's day the amorite had not yet come corrupt enough to lose canaan and so it doesn't immediately go to abraham but when it does god uses his own his people to carry out the sentence you send see men can sin brazenly for a short time judgment will surely fall when their evil works are complete as john calvin said when god gets ready to judge a nation he sends him wicked rulers are you with me and god's judgment today is upon the methodists look how they have turned to homosexuals his judgment is upon the baptist the pentecostals he's what's he doing he's calling his elect out of the denomination and leaving them in their wickedness and let me say god's judgment is on this nation he has turned them over to a rebel mind and if you're not careful you get swept away with that reprobate mind that it said that is taken off because it's the mind of satan coming down are you with me satan's about to take over this world you heard me right when the bride leaves chaos breaks over hey man satan comes down he has a better short time and the kingdoms of this world are preparing to crown a satan as their king they're already doing it they're doing it in our universities they're doing it in our schools they're doing it with their curriculums they're doing it with their anna god the antichrist movements somebody help me preach now this is where we are judgment is on this nation a person or a nation can reject the gospel to a point that god rejects them amen and then he curses their conscience that's pretty heavy right there let me repeat it god god can what god will do with a person who rejects his word and his gospel and they can do it to a point that that in turn that god rejects them and when he does he curses their conscience listen don't don't the united states appear in revelation 13. in their number 13. wasn't there 13 original colonies that formed the u.s in their 13 stars and 13 stripes and 13 arrows and the eagles call and i hadn't even began to remember all the 13s even even in some of the titles on your uh uh on on america there then the their letters are 13 long and so on and on and on it's over and over and over again 13 13 13 13 and she's found in the 13th chapter of revelation she raises up like a lamb with freedom of religion she ends up like a beast come on with freedom from religion listen right over in our neighboring country right now over in canada in edmonton is a church there they're not a message group but they're they're believing christians walking in the light they know and they've insisted on meeting together you know they answered the solution they just built a fence around them where they can't even get into their property to keep them from having church that's supposed to be a democratic nation like ours a sister nation ours that's what's happened over in gemara just watch what starts happening in sodom amen we just missed it this week by four to five vote in our supreme court of aware that where that were they ruled in favor of people being able to worship in their homes and gather in their homes do you hear what i'm saying amen this is how close how close we came to losing freedom we we are here in a time like never before and it's going home time and you're either going to take the mind of christ or the mark or the mind of the beast the bible said these are all have one mind and they gave it to the beast and you're seeing the people becoming of one mind i'm i kind of waffle and vacillate between the thoughts was there was this election stolen or did we have that many absolutely crazy insane people [Music] do you hear what we're talking about where the majority now have a reprobate mind no conscience no because you can tell they have no conscience they'll abort them full-term babies and kill them they they would they would you there's all kinds of things that are going on you know men heartless put them by the putting the sick people right into the nursing home to kill the elderly come on all the crazy things that are happening in our nation today things that you know don't make a lick of sense if you got any sense but you see what has it been the iniquity hasn't been full until now we're in the time where it is heaped up starting to run over amen and it happened in that day and god called an exodus to go take over that land amen and god's calling in exodus in this land amen from me from egypt to the promised land now of course as it does now they're getting ready to leave and there's been the token applied and a move of the spirit of god and the firstborn is dying and and the and and uh there you know darin pharaoh calls for moses you'll find this in chapter 8 verse 25 of exodus then pharaoh calls for moses and aaron and said go sacrifice your god in the land in other words stay in egypt and and moses says it's not meat for us to do so we can't do this for we sacrifice i want you to watch the word we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lord we sacrifice the abomination of egyptians before their eyes will they not stone us we will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he hath commanded us now they they're saying we can't worship here we got to go three days journey from egypt we must go to justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost in order to to go into the promised land amen and the and and pharaoh said i'll let you go that you may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away from me you know far away and free from me you see you know again they were there was i'll let you go but only so far you see they here moses realized i can't sacrifice what is the abomination what the egyptians hate we can't worship like that they would stone us and you know they they say uh the days of the the spirit of moving is past they don't want that in the land of egypt that's why we can't worship them because when we worship we kill their sacred cows of easy believism we slit the throat of a religion without emotion and we offer a praise to our god amen and egyptians have no use for the holy spirit and the way it was back then they don't want the original pentecost it would kill their starchy baptist ways they want to sow intellectualize the message and we kill intellectualism now in egypt you're educated to god but when you come three days journey to the baptism of the holy ghost you kill egyptian religion dead amen now you know as i said you know they pharaoh said just go so far and he said you know he said we can't just go so far see moses said we've got to get out of egypt we've got to get out to be able to worship we got to take a three-day journey we got to get to the baptism of the holy ghost and we don't believe in just going so far they've done that in the past they went to justification or they went to sanctification or they went to the gift but there's got to be a people go all the way so we don't believe in a super religion we're not going just so far we're going to take every divine promise of god if there's healing there we want that healing if there's deliverance we want that delivered if there's salvation of our children we want that salvation amen all the pharaoh says but you don't have to have this victory you don't need this freedom you don't have to weep your way to calvary and cry and die out to sin you don't have to go that far just settle down to good old denominational life you know come to church and you know pay your little dues and put your name on the book and you know but but again the sacrifices we offer they are an abomination to the egyptians they can't stand it when we surrender what they consider the best and what they worship tighten your belt up right now you see cattle was considered divine to the egyptians a bull was actually considered to be one of the most divine gods if the hebrews would set a sacrifice a bull in front of the egyptian they would stone them with stones you see you know what you see what we consider uh what we sacrifice or surrender to our god is actually considered divine to the egyptians don't miss this point they actually worship and make a god out of education we don't we use it to further our needs but we don't worship it in fact we surrender it we sacrifice we kill the knowledge of man for the knowledge of god amen brother this makes us despised by the egyptians they can't stand it because education is their god we are people who surrenders education and scientific knowledge for god's word our men give up effeminate spirits and the egyptians will hate you for it come on now amen we give them up or kill or sacrifice a effeminate spirits they want men to be sissies they don't want them to be the head of the house no way they want that killed or they don't want that killed rather why oh isn't he a darling oh my he sports a necklace look at him he's found his feminine side he puts on his shorts isn't he cute and his his hair is like a punk in his closure tight isn't he a darling he done found his feminine side i did mine too about 45 years ago i brought her down to the altar and we became one i'm the masculine she's the feminine we're one amen but when we sacrifice we kill that bull we surrender we give up the world and the things of the world amen first corinthians six and nine emblazonedness on your heart know you not that the unrighteousness shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers with themselves of themselves of mankind nor deeds nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god of such were some of you but you are lost but you are sanctified but you are justified in the name of our lord jesus and by the spirit of our god some of you were that way and each of you worshipped us those gods but you've done come three days journey you came to justification sanctification and the spirit of our god came upon you hallelujah now if it's true that man is not to be effeminate but masculine then the woman is to be feminine she's not to be hard she should be soft the egyptians of the day make the woman hard she is the head of the house she wears the pants ain't no husband gonna tell her not to cut her hair she can be managed if she wants to be she isn't going to be led she's going to lead she will be the marine the warrior the police the mayor the congress governors the the the governor the vice president and the president amen in today's world egypt's gods are portrayed as a weak man and a strong woman and the israelis kill that god they sacrifice it they give it up to god and by giving it up god looks at it as something holy you see no true israelite woman will wear a garment that pertains to man any more than a true israelite man will wear garments that pertain to a woman as brother branham said in the thigh tyrion church age now woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture be submissive to the male that's commanded up a woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat but she'll want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house and if she breaks that image god made for her she is perverted and any man that lets a woman take authority has also broken that image and he has perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertaining to a man or cut her hair she is never to wear garments that pertain to mail or cut her hair when she does she's intruding into the male domain taking authority perverting herself and when a woman invades the pulpit [Music] which is commanded she must not do she shows what spirit she is uh being a dominating female is antichrist and the seeds of the roman catholic church are entered though she may deny this ever so vehemently but when it comes to the word let god be true and every man's word alive amen but now keep this in balance now because no true male will make a woman a doormat she ain't something for you to wipe your feet on she has something to love and to cherish to care for and to nourish amen no no it ain't you say well brother tim you make all the decisions in the house well you know does stop here i am responsible but there ain't nothing we do that we don't do together i don't have a separate bankround from hers you don't have one for me i don't do that i don't go and buy my buy buy a car without getting her approval i asked her to ask her what you know why cause i love her i want to please her it's my joy to make her happy but when it comes down to the where the rubber meets the road i take i take responsibility for the decisions that has to be made in the house we work together i'm not alone she's not alone i'm not by myself she's not by herself we're together in this and any true marriage relationship has to be that way are you with me but a man is to have the image of christ he is to love his wife and give himself for her see your wife going astray where what are you going to do about it you're not going to win her back with an angry look and a fist amen the best way you can do it is be a real man kneel yourself down to an altar somewhere and call on god until god changes the situation [Applause] amen oh that a people would know their god because when they know their god they can do exploits so when we worship we sacrifice we give up to god we kill what egyptian idolizes gods we kill makeup we kill vulgar and moral clothing we kill movies and movie stars we don't worship them and make them divine we kill them we slaughter televisions we surrender up to god pornography that's adultery don't you know amen if you're unmarried it's fornication but we don't we don't worship that amen we kill it we offer that up to god amen we offer our lives to god i'll not join myself for some filthy man or woman out there come on somebody amen i'll not be a slave to sex i'll not be a slave to lust amen we are people of freedom amen and those gods that the egyptians worship we don't worship them here [Music] [Applause] we surrender up drinking smoking doping alcohol i told a man the other day who wrote me and you know was trying to bring up things against the message and i said oh just go on back there and drink your beers and sip your wine and wear your shorts and laugh your way to hell [Music] oh brother tim you didn't tell him that i did because i ain't going where they're going amen hey man we surrender up drinking and smoking and dope and alcohol and rap and rock and roll and country music we don't worship education and science we worship the i am that i am amen oh but pharaoh says don't go too far away you see pharaoh didn't want people going all the way to the baptism of the holy ghost because he knew that that would be their freedom to go all the way into the land hallelujah let me tell you to go all the way to take that three-day journey to get that baptism of the holy ghost it makes it well you can go all the way to a rapture all the way to a body change all the way to the resurrection kind of like after this meeting we just had it's kind of like what they had you know the the the the people the people of israel left that that country and pharaoh looked around and they all looked around and said my goodness what have we done why have we done this that we let israel go from serving us how well why why did we let him go you see the devil don't want to let you go you you know how listen you don't know how often he told you surely you do how often he told you that you were worthless and after this liberty you had during this meeting all of a sudden pharaoh wakes up and says oh why did we let him go i mean the devil told you over and over how worthless you are no good sorry come on that's what he told you over and over and over again amen but god came along and delivered you amen and you left egypt hallelujah but now the devil said you're singing a different truth oh that they were mine they were my kids they were my young people i got news for you devil they never originally ever belonged to you they were gods from the beginning before the foundation of the world god had you in his mind now he's been on your trail hat he's been whispering in your ear had me he's been lying to you over and over again all of a sudden you ain't worthless no more you're worth pursuing [Applause] somebody help me preach now amen all of a sudden you're worth pursuing so now he's on your trail you know demons are stubborn actually stubbornness is a demon spirit amen there is iniquity and idolatry because you worship that spirit and you know you can watch them when they get a hold of a person they'll scream i won't come out or you can't have her you'll hear them in a growl you know i've had them growl at me in a gruff voice saying i won't come out when that girl come on the prayer lie in the prayer line there some years ago at camp now and there she cried the moment that i laid my hands on her and anointed with all she crouched down like a an animal and a and a grotesque look come on her face and a snarl come out of her mouth and she was growling and she was swinging at me i won't let go you know i won't let go i i won't i will not go well you saw what happened didn't you he had to go he didn't come to the wrong youth camp he wants to say i won't come out i won't come out i won't come out he's stubborn but for a believer devils are subject to us we rule them they don't rule us we say go and they have to go [Applause] if we say shut up they gotta close their mouth that's the first thing i did when that girl was scaring all the kids in the in the prayer line there and i could see the look of terror on their face daniel you were there right there right there you know what happened and i forbid her to speak she had to shut up because when the son of god says shut up to the devil why don't you just practice that come on i mean the devil's been talking to you we're telling the chef come on the bible said that that the lord hardened the heart of the pharaoh the king and and that and he pursued after them but said the children of israel went out with a high hand oh hallelujah their emotions must have soared when they walked away from the brickyards amen when their firstborn wasn't was still alive and laughing and playing they left egypt with a high handle we might say that went out on a real high hallelujah they that went out with it would defiantly the word means hallelujah in open resistance actually they went out rebelliously the right time to use rebelliousness that's when it's against that tyrant the devil they went out rebelliously resisting his authority and his control they went out shouting they were saying i'm free and i'm not a slave any longer i'm not a slave to fear i'm not a slave to now i'm not a slave to your thoughts they can't control me i will control them by casting them down but that dumb devil pursued after them it looks like he should have learned long before that you know and that uh that he ain't gonna win he didn't win one of the times and here he comes one more time and god says i've hardened his heart because i'm going to destroy him and i'm going to use you to be the bait are you with me yeah i'm going to use you hey he's using young people in this age to beat the bait to the devil amen come on down here you're not going to get them you're going to find your destruction you're not coming here for victory you're coming here for destruction are you with me amen now listen the enemy was more than a match for them oh yes it was pharaoh had 600 chosen chariots plus the chariots of egypt and satan is more than a match for us don't go to thinking he isn't brother bradley said we know that we know that satan is way more than a match for any human being don't you never try to do it with your wisdom and outsmart him you just can't do it jesus knew this so he said to the church that so satan would not outsmart them a place to be fortified he sent them the holy ghost and the church doesn't claim to be smart they just claim to believe now you're not going to out argue him you're not going to outsmart him but you cannot believe him because that's what you are is a believer so you doubt your doubts and believe what god said is that right amen listen how prophet goes against satan when he prays for a child who is dying with leukemia he preaches an old sermon to a young girl in the greatest battle ever fought in this prayer he said god this child probably is the most sickest person in the building this morning because she can't live without you very much longer she's the most sickened and we are we're agreeing as every soldier standing here and in this group stands the royal seed of abraham you see what he's doing he's positioning us that's the whole thing is positioning before you meet the devil you position yourself amen come on well you say but brother tim you know i got the holy ghost but now the devil is trying to make me doubt it well of course he is that's what he did to jesus as soon as he got the holy ghost god wasn't scared of it he led him into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil come on somebody amen he knew that what he had given him worked that it would not fail is that right amen so what the enemy do he came in and said and question his relationship with god if thou be the son of god this is what the devil comes to you if you were a son if you are really a son prove it to me [Music] you don't owe the devil nothing come on somebody you do not owe him a thing you don't have to prove to him nothing amen so jesus didn't even use his power he didn't go and get anointed again and then let me shout for a moment can i get that feeling i got that that sunday into sunday or that that saturday night when brother ron was free can i get that feeling again he didn't say that he wasn't feeling it right now [Music] he was not feeling it right then you know what he was feeling the dirty rotten evil presence of lucifer himself snarling at his face and if you don't think that was an atmosphere it was my brother tim i i i i ain't feeling what i did no but that didn't change what it gave you [Applause] that don't happen that don't change what happened to jesus on the river jordan when god said this is my beloved son and when you got the holy ghost the other day that's what god was saying come on amen you may not have seen it you may not have heard it but it was there amen you can tell by the effects come on amen what this is my beloved son the son i love now if you're a real father you can tell your children you love them this is what jesus did was told this is my beloved son in whom i am so happy to live in to make my boat in they've surrendered up their lives they yielded themselves to god and i am just delighted to live in them now he goes and the holy spirit leads him into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil not a devil but the devil now most of us maybe i don't know maybe we never meet the devil but we sure meet a devil you could see him in the other round brother branham did one time he said i was laying there and he said i looked over in the corner and he said i felt the funniest spirit and i looked over and there was a a creature it looked like a deformed creature you see because satan lost his original state and he looked like a deformed creature like alley-oop in the funny paper and he was cackling like him going to the barn and he was saying to me you're nothing but a fake and these miracles and you that you say is nothing but a fake well if the if the devil has the audacity to come into the presence of a prophet of god malachi 4 and tell him he's of faith what do you think he's going to do to you he's going to come right up to you and say you just been faking all of this you faked that shot the other day that was you jumped that was you that was you that was you because he's pursuing you all of a sudden you worthless no good thing is something he's got to have back now so how do we approach it we approach him first of all knowing who we are that's why i've told the brothers years ago you know and have advocated y'all put an adoption way over in the future sure adoption change of our body that's the that's the redemption of our body we got that but this adoption that we have received individually as sons is when you receive the holy ghost you shall receive power when the holy ghost has come upon you otherwise people are standing over there hiding behind the organ in our chair somewhere the piano and saying oh my god you know the devil's here and we don't know what to do you know because we ain't got the power yet and we're not adopted yet and you know we hadn't come into maturity yet come on now i you no wonder the devil is buffaloed the churches everywhere they don't realize who they are that now we are the sons of god that you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you come on amen we have the power we're not waiting on the power you misapply things you get you go and look for all the quotes and well brother adam said when the squeeze comes down what's the third pulled them let me tell you something squeeze has been here a long time amen the devil has been squeezing and pressure is everywhere amen but let me tell you there was never time that persecution ever put the power of god in the church amen it's the holy ghost that puts the power of god in the church we don't have to wait on a squeeze we have the power now by the baptism of the holy ghost oh brother tim when when it all comes down well read feast of the trumpets you'll find brother branham changes the turns a corner and says we'll go through none of that that's to the foolish virgin and god gives him as joshua dividing the inheritance gives that portion over to the foolish virgins and to the 144 thousand but he said we get nothing but the rapture it is wonderful to know you will go to the tribulation church and you ain't got to have tribulation to bring the power it never will make you mature what makes you mature is the baptism of the holy ghost that bursts you a son or daughter of god and that gives you the authority what you do is you wrap that rogue around you the baptism of the holy ghost and you take that authority because you got a ring on your finger that he put on there the seal of the holy ghost and you say satan you take your hands off of god's property lose them and let them go i have met a pillar of fire i stood in this prison i have been changed by the power of god and i have a thigh of the mighty angel who is my guardian who blesses what i bless and cleanses what i curse and is an adversary to my adversary and an enemy to my enemies unless he said in this group stands this royal seat of abraham we're marching in on satan now we're not running we're not retreating we're marching in on satan now and might as well get ready to go satan because our armors are gleaming and our colors are screamed streaming and men and women are holding swords marching forward upon you now for this little girl come out of her satan leave that child as the army of the living god we defy you leave her in the name of jesus christ i go lay hands upon her and satan you have bound this child you have done this evil i know you're more than a match for a human being but you're not a match for my lord so i come in his name leave her thou spirit of the devil thou demon of sickness come out of this child that she may go free from this day on i pronounce this in the name of jesus christ and then he says it has been spoken now let it be done you people keep telling me in prayer lines well the devil keeps telling me i have a simple question i want you to answer what are you listening to him for [Music] is satan's word greater than god's well brother tim he reminds me of my past well you're right that's the devil because god can't do that god can't remind once it's been forgiven come on somebody god justifies that means that you are righteous in his sight so if you have a spirit that comes up and reminds you of your past it ain't god and he ain't worth listening to and you can tell when he's lying when his lips are moving once forgiven god's justified that means he makes you righteous in his life let me paraphrase to you what paul said in the book of romans for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be like his son that he might be a firstborn among many brethren and having chosen us he called us to come to him and when we came he declared us not guilty and he filled us with his spirit and gave us right standing with himself and promised us his glory what can we ever say to such wonderful things as these if god is on our side who can ever be against us hallelujah since he did not spare his own son for us but gave him up for us all will these also surely give us everything else who dares accuse us when god has chosen us as his own will god no he's the one who's forgiven us and given us his right standing with his self who then will condemn us will christ know for he's the one who died for us and came back to life again for us and is either seating on our behalf there in heaven who then can keep christ's love from us when we have trouble or calamity when we're hunted down or destroyed is it because he doesn't love us anymore and if we are hungry or penniless or in danger or threatened with death has god deserved deserted us come on now we had a man here preaching this weekend that that what he he was he was given a a down a death announcement on his life are you with me amen you say because of that god is forsaken brother ron no god hadn't forsaken him and he said i'll never leave your forsaken amen yes you know we it does not mean god's deserted us because then you you feel like you got trouble today or there's still life life keeps on happening and it's situa well god's deserted me no he hasn't deserted you you say but i'm looking back and i see millions of egyptians were big chariots at pharaoh's best and they're all coming on yeah they are but i haven't forgotten you i actually called them to this battle because i'm going to get honor on pharaoh hallelujah and god will actually call the enemy come on somebody harden their hearts just pursue you to try to overtake you to try to bring you back into slavery he will actually do everything that allow the devil to do everything he can because he's going to get honor over the devil that you ain't got enough devil you brought your best you have your terrorists you have the smaller cherry you got air the horses you got sword you got manpower but we got god you've got laodicea you got demons you got suicide spirits you got dope you got alcohol you got pornography but we got god and if god be power who can be against us sure you're gonna have trouble yeah certainly we face that we go through trouble and dangers that we face but overwhelming victory desires through christ who loved us enough to die for us come on somebody god pursued you too don't never forgot to forgive that amen not just the devil god pursued you remember because of this great love that he had for you before the world began he said you're my little children and i'm not gonna let you stay in bodies forever because this is the hour of freedom this is the hour of rejoicing it's the hour for people to go out with a high hand rebellious against the devil rebellious against this room [Applause] amen for i'm convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love death can't and life can't angels won't and all the powers of hell itself cannot keep god's love away our fears for today are worries about tomorrow or where we are high above the skies or in the deepest ocean nothing will ever be able to separate us from the love of god demonstrated by our lord jesus christ when he died for us now so the devil tells you he keeps telling you you're in what you what you are in his sight that you're still a slave but what does god say he said you never originally belonged to the devil your mind and you're not only pardoned i want to give this talk to you you're not just pardon you're not just forgiven i mean you cheat me out of money and i forgive you but i still remember it and it may take me a long time to ever trust you again because i remember it right remember that ain't the way god does when god forgives he forgets it is though you've never done it amen you didn't even do it in the first place amen you look but you look and you see the enemy coming like a flood and pursuing you saying oh god oh god oh god the the devil's gonna be victorious now and moses steals the people and says fear not and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you this day for the egyptians whom you have seen this day you will see them again no more i'm telling
