[17:36] Brother Aaron and I, Sister Lydia and
[17:37] Sister Jessica were [music] just at a
[17:39] church this past weekend that I've been
[17:41] going to the last couple years. It's a
[17:42] group of maybe 15 or 20 of their home
[17:45] church. And each of them would love to
[17:47] be seated where you're seated this
[17:48] morning. Great people, wonderful people.
[17:50] Love the message. uh just doesn't
[17:52] [music] quite have the facilities that
[17:54] we have and you know such wonderful
[17:57] people though but at this time [music]
[17:59] holiday season don't take for granted
[18:01] that you're you get to sit next to the
[18:03] person you're sitting with and each of
[18:05] you bring something special to even like
[18:07] tabernacle you bring you and you're
[18:10] unique you're different you're special
[18:12] you're important and we need you this
[18:14] morning in the service brother Tim asked
[18:16] some of you young people to come to the
[18:18] front you've you responded to the call
[18:20] many of you at the front this Morning.
[18:22] Let's have church. [music] Let's close
[18:23] this year out with a bang.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; Can we do that this this weekend, this
[18:27] morning, to say, "Lord, come. Whatever
[18:29] it is that I have need of, you know, my
[18:31] needs, you know the needs that were
[18:32] read. Let's ask God. Let's invite God to
[18:35] come." He said, "He've never seen the
[18:37] word of God taken on human lips ever
[18:40] fell in the mouth of believers." I
[18:42] believe that is true today as it was in
[18:44] the 60s, in the 50s. He's still God.
[18:46] He's still on on the throne. So, let's
[18:48] just go to him in prayer. present your
[18:50] needs [singing] and the needs. Brother
[18:51] Jonathan [music] Middleton, he needs a
[18:52] great touch in his body. He needs to be
[18:54] able to work in his lungs and his
[18:56] asthma, the things that he's dealing
[18:57] with. He's in a battle, but we know the
[18:59] one [music] who conquers, right?
[19:01] &gt;&gt; And he conquered for him. So, Father, we
[19:02] just bow our hearts and our heads to you
[19:04] this morning. God, thank you for the
[19:06] opportunity to come within the walls of
[19:09] this church. Lord, we know that Lord,
[19:11] even like tabernacle is just not [music]
[19:12] made up of the four walls of the the
[19:14] sanctuary and the outer structure, but
[19:17] it's the people, Lord. And your prophet
[19:19] would teach us that Lord, the beauty of
[19:21] the church is the character of its
[19:23] people. And what a wonderful church we
[19:25] have here. What a special group of
[19:27] people we get to rub shoulders with day
[19:29] in and day out, service after service.
[19:32] And Lord, we don't want to take that for
[19:33] granted this morning. Lord, we're very
[19:36] special people of of people that are are
[19:39] blessed to to come and hear the
[19:40] ministering of the word. But not only
[19:42] that, but to get to fellowship with one
[19:44] another with such wonderful and godly
[19:47] people, people that love you, people
[19:49] that reverence you, people that that
[19:51] just recognize that Lord, their walk in
[19:53] their life is not about them, [music]
[19:55] but it's about you and the change that
[19:57] you have made in their lives, in their
[19:59] homes, in their marriages, in their
[20:00] families, and their children. God, we
[20:02] give all the credit to you this morning.
[20:04] Lord, as Paul would say, I planted
[20:07] Apollos water, but God [music] giveth
[20:09] the increase. And Lord, we understand
[20:11] that you planted a great ministry here
[20:13] and you've added to it and Apollos and
[20:15] this one and that one. But God, all
[20:17] together is for the glorifying of you
[20:19] and the edification of your body. Lord,
[20:21] you get the increase. And we're here
[20:23] this morning to say, Lord, increase in
[20:25] our lives, increase in our young people,
[20:28] increase in our homes, increase in our
[20:30] marriages. Lord, increase in our
[20:32] families, increase in our church. God,
[20:34] it's not about man, but it's about you
[20:36] this morning. So, we give you all the
[20:39] honor, Lord. We give you all the glory
[20:40] this morning. And Lord, WE INVITE YOU TO
[20:43] COME AND speak to hearts and speak to
[20:45] lives, Lord. And we petition you to to
[20:47] move on the requests that were
[20:49] mentioned. Lord, Brother John, Brother
[20:51] Jonathan in need of a touch in his
[20:53] [music] body. Sister Alysa in need of a
[20:55] touch in her body. Lord, sister Linda in
[20:57] need of a touch in her body. God, MAY
[20:59] YOU JUST GO TO them this morning as the
[21:01] preaching of the word would go forth.
[21:03] May the healing angel visit them, Lord
[21:05] God, and touch them in THEIR NEEDS.
[21:07] FATHER, LORD, every hand that was lifted
[21:09] this morning, you know the heart that
[21:11] represents that need, God, may you just
[21:14] speak expressly, Lord. [music]
[21:16] May you just come by Eden Tabernacle for
[21:18] a special visitation. Lord, as you
[21:21] visited Abraham on the back side of a
[21:23] desert, Lord, to shows to Sarah that she
[21:26] was included in the promise, won't you
[21:28] come by Sarah again this morning,
[21:29] [music] Lord? Let her see she's included
[21:31] in that promise. Father, we thank you.
[21:34] We we don't take this opportunity for
[21:36] granted, Lord. We just want to worship
[21:38] you now, Father, in spirit and in truth.
[21:40] For we ask these things this morning in
[21:42] Jesus name. Amen.
[21:49] Amen.
[21:51] Hallelujah. Gal.
[21:56] Amen. I didn't know brother Tim had
[21:58] asked some [music] people to move to the
[21:59] front. I should have asked some people
[22:01] to sing some specials.

[22:06] Amen.
[22:08] God is so good to us.
[22:10] Amen. The brothers can take up the
[22:12] offering. You can turn [music] around
[22:13] and shake somebody's hand. Greet him to

[53:25] love to be in the service [music] today
[53:27] I I see brother Jimbo is not present And
[53:29] I pray God wherever he is, you'll send
[53:32] healing virtues to him and bring a
[53:35] deliverance to him. Lord, brother Glenn
[53:38] Tamblingson, lay in the hospital today,
[53:41] call in early, want in prayer. God, I
[53:44] pray that you'll be merciful. You're the
[53:46] healer. You're the provider.
[53:49] Lord, we'll not forget to remember our
[53:51] brother Ron. Lord, God, may you just
[53:54] touch him and heal him and deliver him.
[53:57] You're still Jehovah Gyra, the needs
[54:00] provider. Jehovah Shama, our healer. I
[54:04] pray God that you reveal yourself to
[54:06] your children today in that manner. Oh
[54:10] God, heal us of sin, sickness, and
[54:13] diseases in Jesus [music] name. Amen.
[54:18] Amen. God bless you.
[54:20] Praise the Lord. God bless you. Before
[54:22] you're seated this morning, let's just
[54:24] look into the word of God. Let's go to
[54:26] Romans chapter 7 and I want to read from
[54:30] there and we're just going to get right
[54:31] into the word. We've had wonderful
[54:33] singing today and worship to the Lord
[54:36] and thank you Sister Jessica for another
[54:38] wonderful song today and we so
[54:40] appreciate what the Lord has given us.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God bless each one of you as we
[54:47] worship together today. Romans chapter 7
[54:50] verse one. Know ye not brethren? For I
[54:53] speak to them that know the law, how
[54:55] that the law hath dominion over a man as
[54:58] long as he liveth. For the woman which
[55:01] hath an husband is bound by the law to
[55:04] her husband so long as he liveth. But if
[55:08] the husband be dead, she is loosed from
[55:10] the law of her husband. So then if while
[55:14] her husband liveth, she be married to
[55:16] another, she shall be called an
[55:18] adulteress. But if her husband be dead,
[55:21] she is freed from that law, so that she
[55:24] is no adulteress, though she be married
[55:26] to another man. Wherefore, my brethren,
[55:29] ye also are become dead to the law by
[55:33] the body of Christ, that you should be
[55:35] married to another, even to him who is
[55:37] raised from the dead, that we should
[55:40] bring forth fruit unto God. For when we
[55:43] were in the flesh, the motions of the of
[55:46] sin, which were by the law, did work in
[55:49] our members to bring forth fruit unto
[55:52] death. But now we are delivered from the
[55:55] law, that being dead, wherein we were
[55:58] held, that we should serve in the
[56:00] newness of spirit, and not in the
[56:03] oldness of the letter. Amen. God bless
[56:06] you. You can be seated.
[56:10] You know, we we know the seal of the
[56:12] Holy Ghost is considered as the new
[56:16] birth.
[56:17] And but we're looking here in the Bible
[56:21] where it's actually teaching us that it
[56:24] is also the marriage covenant. It is the
[56:27] invisible union between God and his
[56:30] bride. Now from Romans 7 we understand
[56:33] that Paul's teaching on marriage extends
[56:36] beyond natural relationships
[56:39] and he uses here a spiritual analogy. Uh
[56:44] yet the principle that he presents also
[56:47] upholds the natural law of marriage as
[56:50] he said in Romans 7:3 that if while her
[56:54] husband liveth she be married to another
[56:58] man she shall be called an adulteress.
[57:02] Now, that is a very plain and direct
[57:04] statement and and it leaves very little
[57:08] room for reinterpretation or personal
[57:11] opinion.
[57:13] And and and really it's a serious matter
[57:16] to be found in the condition of adultery
[57:19] whether at the moment of death or at the
[57:21] rapture is eternally dangerous.
[57:25] And and so and that is because that the
[57:29] scripture is unchanging. You just can't
[57:32] change the word of God. As I say
[57:34] sometimes about and especially about
[57:36] marriage and divorce issues, I say,
[57:38] "Well, I I didn't write the rules
[57:41] &gt;&gt; and I can't change them. I have no power
[57:43] to do it."
[57:44] &gt;&gt; So because the scripture is unchanging
[57:48] and it says very clearly that no
[57:51] adulterer shall inherit the kingdom of
[57:53] God. And and I understand that this um
[57:57] may be sometimes um uncomfortable for
[57:59] some to hear, but as ministers, we're
[58:02] not called to preach what is popular.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; We are called to stand uncompromising on
[58:07] the word of God. And what we are going
[58:09] to share today is not directed at any
[58:12] individual, but we're once again seeking
[58:15] to bring balance to the truth that has
[58:18] been neglected.
[58:19] We're bringing down the mountains of
[58:21] traditions and raising the valleys of
[58:24] overlooked scripture. And this is the
[58:27] responsibility of the ministry in this
[58:29] last day as we forun his second coming.
[58:33] And we're part of that people that is
[58:36] called to be in his coming. Now this
[58:39] this subject of marriage and divorce is
[58:42] of course weighty and is sobering. And
[58:44] brother Bradom expressed how difficult
[58:47] it was to have to bring this revelation
[58:50] to the the the people. And when the Lord
[58:53] opened up the mystery to him after the
[58:56] breaking of the seals, it became clear
[58:58] to him that this was not just um
[59:01] doctrinal detail, but it was a really a
[59:04] heaven or hell issue on which nearly
[59:08] every denomination today differs in
[59:11] position. So, you know, you ask one
[59:14] church and you get this opinion and you
[59:17] get this asked another opinion and and
[59:21] and even brother Brandham when he got
[59:24] this revelation, he wrestled deeply with
[59:28] what to say. You know what? What do I do
[59:31] when I have some good men and some
[59:35] wonderful people, women, and in our
[59:38] congregation, some of them married two
[59:40] or three times, lives that are so
[59:43] tangled in relationships that were not
[59:45] joined according to the word of God. And
[59:48] these were sincere people. They were
[59:51] faithful churchgoers, but they were
[59:53] victims of false teaching and cultural
[59:56] influence or incomplete understanding of
[1:00:00] God's design for marriage. So today, as
[1:00:04] we continue to walk in the light that
[1:00:06] has been revealed, we're compelled to
[1:00:09] handle this truth with reverence and
[1:00:12] courage. You know, the subject may be um
[1:00:16] uncomfortable
[1:00:18] um but it's necessary.
[1:00:20] the stakes are eternal.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And if we truly love people, we have to
[1:00:24] tell them the truth.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; You know, not just to condemn them, but
[1:00:28] to warn, to instruct, and to guide
[1:00:32] toward redemption. And and not only
[1:00:35] that, but we have young people that we
[1:00:38] must lead in the paths of righteousness
[1:00:41] and warn of the pitfalls along the way.
[1:00:45] But you know, this sermon today though
[1:00:47] is really not going to be about marriage
[1:00:49] and divorce. So we will cover a little
[1:00:52] aspects of that, but it's going to be
[1:00:55] about marriage responsibility and God's
[1:00:59] design.
[1:01:00] And and it's not just about human
[1:01:02] relationships that we're going to go in
[1:01:04] today, though we will we will use and
[1:01:07] and and speak about human relationship,
[1:01:10] but it's really a mirror of Christ and
[1:01:13] his bride.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; And as we if we get the natural pattern
[1:01:17] wrong, you know, it it means that we may
[1:01:20] be misunderstanding the spiritual union
[1:01:23] as well. So we want to approach this
[1:01:26] subject today very prayerfully and
[1:01:29] humbly with our ears tuned to the word
[1:01:31] of God. Not to tradition, not to culture
[1:01:35] or not to personal emotion, but to the
[1:01:38] word of the Lord for this age.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; AND YOU MIGHT ASK, YOU KNOW, what in the
[1:01:42] world has caused the confusion that we
[1:01:44] have today, you know, about even the
[1:01:48] issues of marriage and divorce and
[1:01:49] remarage and so on. And I'll tell you
[1:01:52] the reason is false teaching
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; and that is the root of it. Many didn't
[1:01:56] wait on the Lord but followed man-made
[1:01:59] doctrines and traditions that
[1:02:01] contradicted the scripture.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus said what God have joined together
[1:02:08] let not man put us under.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; And now I know I want you to notice his
[1:02:13] wording. Not not what man has joined but
[1:02:16] what God has joined. And there is a
[1:02:19] difference because when you get a direct
[1:02:22] revelation that this is your wife or or
[1:02:25] for a woman that this is your husband
[1:02:28] that union is is sacred and it's binding
[1:02:31] for life and no man has a right to
[1:02:35] separate it.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. SO WHAT A MAN JOINS TOGETHER based
[1:02:40] on emotion, lust or convenience, it can
[1:02:43] easily fall apart. But it because it
[1:02:46] wasn't joined by God to begin with.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; And we see this too often in marriages
[1:02:52] today. Marriages that are officiated in
[1:02:54] courtrooms by half drunken magistrates
[1:02:58] or backsliden preachers who follow
[1:03:00] creeds instead of scripture and they
[1:03:03] perform they'll perform any kind of
[1:03:05] union while God's word lies open and it
[1:03:10] is ignored. So let's be clear. WE'RE
[1:03:13] TALKING ABOUT WHAT GOD JOINS TOGETHER.
[1:03:16] Not human arrangements, not legal
[1:03:18] contracts. That's this is a standard
[1:03:22] that Jesus upheld. What God joins
[1:03:25] together. Now, THERE IS A CIVIL LAW THAT
[1:03:28] MUST BE adhered to in our land. And
[1:03:31] there is a moral law that God is going
[1:03:33] to hold us accountable to
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; and they are different. I mean, civil
[1:03:37] laws will permit all kinds of marriages
[1:03:40] and remarages and divorces and so on and
[1:03:42] on and on and give you the legal right
[1:03:45] to do so.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; But God's law is a moral law and God
[1:03:50] will hold you accountable for what's
[1:03:52] written in his word.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; SO, WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE
[1:03:56] NATURAL TYPE AND THE spiritual reality.
[1:03:59] BECAUSE JUST AS A MAN CHOOSES A WIFE IN
[1:04:02] THE NATURAL, SO CHRIST CHOOSES HIS BRIDE
[1:04:06] IN THE SPIRITUAL. Marriage is a type of
[1:04:09] Christ and the church. And and it should
[1:04:12] be approached with discernment AND
[1:04:14] REVERENCE. MARRIAGE VOWS ARE ARE VERY
[1:04:17] SACRED. WE SAY until death do us part.
[1:04:22] AND THAT IS HOW WE ARE TO LIVE. KEEPING
[1:04:24] that vow as a lifelong covenant.
[1:04:28] THEREFORE, CHOOSING A SPOUSE IS one of
[1:04:31] the most serious decisions that a person
[1:04:34] can make. And hearing is the cause of
[1:04:38] broken home. I'll tell you what it is.
[1:04:40] It's a lack of prayer and discernment.
[1:04:44] And today we live in A NATION PERHAPS
[1:04:47] AMERICA may no doubt she has so many
[1:04:50] divorces. I WOULDN'T DOUBT that she
[1:04:52] leads the world in divorce. We claim TO
[1:04:55] BE A CHRISTIAN NATION. YET OUR COURTS
[1:04:57] are flooded with broken marriages, you
[1:05:00] know, and to TO THE POINT THEY DON'T
[1:05:02] EVEN GET MARRIED ANYMORE. They just
[1:05:04] cohabit together because it's too hard
[1:05:06] to separate and divorce and go through
[1:05:08] all the legal work. But even Christians,
[1:05:11] churches today have divorce and
[1:05:14] remarage. And I I just say what a
[1:05:16] reproach. And the reason is men and
[1:05:20] women have drifted away from God. PEOPLE
[1:05:24] ARE CHOOSING HUSBANDS AND WIVES BASED ON
[1:05:27] OUTWARD APPEAL, LOOKS, STRENGTH, charm
[1:05:31] rather than looking for God's will.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY THE RESULTS SO MANY TIMES
[1:05:37] ARE TRAGIC. If men and women would pray
[1:05:40] earnestly before entering marriage and
[1:05:43] sincerely asking God, is this your will?
[1:05:48] NOT NOT MAKE this your will
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; but Lord is this your will
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; too many times Lord let this be her let
[1:05:57] this be him you know God make this
[1:06:00] happen
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; you know you you you should not ever be
[1:06:04] praying like that
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; and you should say God is THIS YOUR WILL
[1:06:08] IS YOUR will for my life
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; AND IF THIS WOULD BE DONE MANY
[1:06:12] HEARTACHES WOULD BE AVOIDED
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; A WRONG CHOICE in marriage can ruin your
[1:06:18] entire life
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; on every single every person that is
[1:06:23] single there there there lies this
[1:06:26] weight of personal responsibility.
[1:06:29] If a man knowingly chooses a woman who
[1:06:33] is not sub suitable to be his wife and
[1:06:37] he does it anyway he bears a
[1:06:39] responsibility for that decision. And
[1:06:42] the same applies to a woman who
[1:06:44] knowingly accepts a man that is not fit
[1:06:47] to be her husband. Once the truth is
[1:06:51] known and once marriage and divorce has
[1:06:54] been revealed, uh we are we are held
[1:06:57] accountable for that which is revealed.
[1:07:00] That is why no one should rush into
[1:07:02] marriage. You shouldn't you shouldn't
[1:07:05] you SHOULD NOT MAKE SUCH A COMMITMENT
[1:07:08] until you have thoroughly prayed
[1:07:11] through. And there have been many you
[1:07:14] know sincere couples though that were
[1:07:17] caught in this condition. You know
[1:07:18] remarrying WHILE THEIR FIRST SPOUSE WAS
[1:07:21] STILL LIVING and and they didn't do this
[1:07:24] maybe out of rebellion BUT BECAUSE THEY
[1:07:26] WERE TAUGHT A MISINTERPRETED THEOLOGY.
[1:07:29] uh they and then they COME INTO THIS
[1:07:32] GLORIOUS LIFE HAVING NOT KNOWN the truth
[1:07:35] and the full truth about marriage and
[1:07:37] divorce had not yet been revealed to
[1:07:40] them. And and when God unveiled the
[1:07:43] mystery of marriage and divorce through
[1:07:45] the opening of the seals, it became
[1:07:48] clear by the word that such individuals
[1:07:50] were living in adultery and AND THE
[1:07:53] RIGHTEOUS REQUIREMENT of the law. I want
[1:07:56] you to listen carefully and closely. THE
[1:07:59] RIGHTEOUS REQUIREMENT OF THE LAW WOULD
[1:08:02] HAVE DEMANDED separation
[1:08:04] in order to be saved or go in the
[1:08:07] rapture.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And and however, THIS IS WHERE GOD'S
[1:08:12] GRACE WAS MANIFESTED.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; IN THAT VERY MOMENT OF JUDGMENT,
[1:08:18] a a provision was was revealed. Uh you
[1:08:22] you you CAN HEAR BROTHER BRANDHAM TELL
[1:08:24] ABOUT IT IN MARRIAGE and divorce. HE HE
[1:08:26] WENT THERE JUST OUTSIDE OF Tucson and up
[1:08:29] on Finger Rock there as he was praying
[1:08:33] about the you know the situation knowing
[1:08:36] what he was going to preach which would
[1:08:39] require men and women who had been
[1:08:42] married incorrectly and not ACCORDING TO
[1:08:44] WORD TO separate in order to be a part
[1:08:47] of the rapture.
[1:08:49] and knowing this day THAT IT WOULD
[1:08:50] DIVIDE FAMILIES AND AND children and and
[1:08:54] and and it would it would bring a lot of
[1:08:56] hurt and confusion.
[1:08:59] Then he as he went there and was praying
[1:09:03] there AT FINGER ROCK, THE PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:09:05] came down. And when it did, it revealed
[1:09:08] to him the grace portion of marriage and
[1:09:12] divorce AND SAID, "BECAUSE OF
[1:09:14] MISINTERPRETED THEOLOGY, BECAUSE OF THE
[1:09:18] WRONG THINGS THAT HAVE been taught,
[1:09:20] incorrect teaching, AND BECAUSE YOU
[1:09:24] DIDN'T KNOW, there is a special grace
[1:09:26] given." AND THAT IS FOR THOSE OF YOU
[1:09:29] CAUGHT IN THAT TRAP UH that that WOULD
[1:09:33] HAVE TO SEPARATE BECAUSE YOU'RE AN
[1:09:35] ADULTEROUS union according to the word
[1:09:37] of God. THEN GRACE ALLOWED IT WHERE THAT
[1:09:42] THEY COULD REMAIN AS THEY ARE but never
[1:09:46] do it again and teach their children
[1:09:50] never to do it.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, brother. We don't just
[1:09:54] have a message of love. No sir, we got a
[1:09:57] message THAT IS GRACE. IT'S A CAPSTONE
[1:10:00] COMING DOWN CRYING GRACE.
[1:10:03] [applause and cheering] GRACE,
[1:10:05] I'm so glad for that grace.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Now, as we are looking at it, I want you
[1:10:12] to understand something. That act of
[1:10:15] grace did not remove the sinfulness of
[1:10:18] adultery, but it did make room for
[1:10:21] forgiveness when approached in humility
[1:10:25] and faith.
[1:10:26] Yet, YET WE MUST BE CLEAR WHEN WE'RE
[1:10:29] TALKING ABOUT THIS. THIS GRACE IS NOT A
[1:10:32] LICENSE FOR FUTURE DISOBEDIENCE.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; WE ARE COMMANDED TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN
[1:10:38] and others, you know, not to repeat
[1:10:40] these mistakes. FOR THOSE WHO WILL MARRY
[1:10:43] CONTRARY TO THE WORD after the truth has
[1:10:46] been shown to them, I'll tell you the
[1:10:48] scripture, THERE REMAINTH NO sacrifice
[1:10:52] for sin.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; For that sin. The only biblical re
[1:10:57] resolution in such a case is repentance
[1:11:00] and separation.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; NOW THE APOSTLE PAUL WROTE in 1
[1:11:05] Corinthians 6, he told us, HE SAID,
[1:11:08] "KNOW YE NOT THAT THE UNRIGHTEOUS SHALL
[1:11:11] NOT INHERIT the kingdom of God." And he
[1:11:13] said, "Be not deceived, neither
[1:11:15] fornicators or adulterers or or
[1:11:17] adulterers shall inherit the kingdom of
[1:11:20] God." But in VERSE 11, HE GIVES US SOME
[1:11:22] HOPE. AND HE SAYS, "OF SUCH
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; WERE SOME OF YOU,
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU ARE WASHED AND YOU ARE
[1:11:30] SANCTIFIED,
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE JUSTIFIED IN THE NAME OF OUR
[1:11:34] LORD Jesus Christ by the spirit of our
[1:11:36] Lord."
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, HOW THANKFUL WE ARE THAT THAT
[1:11:40] GOD had not only restored the truth of
[1:11:43] marriage AND DIVORCE, BUT HE ALSO MADE A
[1:11:46] PROVISION OF GRACE.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. for those WHO WERE ENTANGLED WITH
[1:11:51] IT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU KNOW, even
[1:11:53] though you you were caught in an
[1:11:56] adulterous union by the GRACE THAT IS
[1:11:59] GIVEN, THERE HAS BEEN SUCH MERCY SHOWN
[1:12:04] THAT YOU CAN GO in a rapture. THAT'S WHY
[1:12:07] THIS MESSAGE GIVES you rapturing faith.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a revelation. AMEN. FROM GOD
[1:12:15] HIMSELF. AND SO I'M SO THANKFUL FOR THAT
[1:12:18] TODAY. AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR THAT GRACE?
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; BUT WELL, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK
[1:12:23] ABOUT MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE and go back
[1:12:25] and he said or he can, she can't, this
[1:12:28] and that, the other. What I want to see
[1:12:29] IS THE REAL LESSON THAT PAUL is bringing
[1:12:32] in this analogy of um of a woman who is
[1:12:37] married to husband. In order to be
[1:12:39] married again, her first husband must be
[1:12:42] dead.
[1:12:44] AND PAUL IS USING THIS NATURAL LAW OF
[1:12:47] MARRIAGE TO REVEAL A PROPHETIC MYSTERY
[1:12:50] OF THE CHURCH IN THE LAST DAYS.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; And he begins speaking to them to know
[1:12:55] to them that know the law, SHOWING THAT
[1:12:58] THE MOSAIC LAW held full dominion over a
[1:13:01] person as long as they were alive.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; And and HE GAVE THE EXAMPLE, A WOMAN IS
[1:13:08] LEGALLY bound to her husband as long as
[1:13:11] he lives. That's right.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; If she unites WITH ANOTHER MAN WHILE HER
[1:13:16] HUSBAND STILL LIVES, SHE SHALL be called
[1:13:18] an adulteress.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE HUSBAND DIES, SHE IS FREED
[1:13:23] FROM THAT LAW and can and can be joined
[1:13:26] to another rightfully.
[1:13:28] And and this is where the this
[1:13:31] revelation unfolds as he said in verse
[1:13:34] four of Romans 7. Wherefore, my
[1:13:36] brethren, you are become DEAD TO THE LAW
[1:13:40] BY THE BODY OF CHRIST, THAT YOU SHOULD
[1:13:42] BE MARRIED to another, even to him who
[1:13:45] has raised from the dead. SO HE SAID,
[1:13:49] "NOW YOU, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, YOU
[1:13:51] HAVE HAD A DEATH TO your old husband,
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; the law, AND NOW YOU CAN be married to
[1:13:59] him that was raised from the dead."
[1:14:02] AMEN.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; SO PAUL IS NOT MERELY TEACHING MARITAL
[1:14:06] REGULATIONS. He's declaring our
[1:14:08] spiritual marital status. WE WERE ONCE
[1:14:11] BOUND TO THE LAW.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS OUR FIRST HUSBAND.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; And even THE FOR THE JEWS THAT THAT
[1:14:19] HUSBAND, IT WAS A MOSAIC LAW. It was a
[1:14:21] covenant given specifically to Israel.
[1:14:25] THE GENTILES, HOWEVER, never were under
[1:14:27] that covenant. INSTEAD, ALL HUMANITY,
[1:14:31] JEW AND GENTILE ALIKE, WERE BORN UNDER
[1:14:34] the dominion of a greater principle, AND
[1:14:37] THAT IS THE LAW OF SIN AND DEATH.
[1:14:41] SO NOW TO TO UNDERSTAND THIS, you know,
[1:14:45] every one of us was born with a husband
[1:14:48] that had rule over us. WE WERE SOLD
[1:14:52] BEFORE OUR birth into marriage
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; AND OUR MARRIAGE WOULD BE TO THE LAW OF
[1:15:00] SIN AND DEATH.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; NOW TO GRASP THE FULL WAY TO PAUL'S
[1:15:04] ANALOGY, WE SHOULD WE should uh you know
[1:15:08] we should understand the the the ancient
[1:15:11] concept of marriage and those customs in
[1:15:14] those days. THEY WERE USUALLY ARRANGED
[1:15:16] BY PARENTS.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AND IT WAS MOST OFTEN TO SERVE
[1:15:21] THEIR OWN interest
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; and children had a little to say little
[1:15:26] to say or to you know in choosing their
[1:15:28] spouse and then A DOWY WAS PAID to the
[1:15:31] bride's FATHER AND IT TRANSFERRED the
[1:15:34] the DAUGHTER INTO THE POSSESSION of her
[1:15:37] husband and legally the woman became her
[1:15:42] husband's property
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; and SHE HAD VERY FEW PERSONAL RIGHTS.
[1:15:48] AH, you know, I I can see, you know,
[1:15:50] your hackles already growing on your
[1:15:52] neck. Now, you know, this is un this is
[1:15:54] just the way it was.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Now, spiritually, this mirrors our
[1:16:00] fallen condition.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; THROUGH ADAM'S DISOBEDIENCE, HUMANITY
[1:16:05] WAS SOLD INTO BONDAGE.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; It was m we WERE MARRIED FROM BIRTH TO
[1:16:11] AN UNCHOSEN HUSBAND.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; THE CARNAL NATURE. AND IN THIS UNION, WE
[1:16:17] BECAME THE PROPERTY of sin,
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; RULED BY SATAN HIMSELF,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; AND THIS EVIL HUSBAND PRODUCED A
[1:16:25] TERRIBLE HARVEST OF SIN AND SICKNESS,
[1:16:29] SORROW, SUFFERING, DEATH. IT WAS THE
[1:16:32] FRUITS of a corrupted nature.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS A WOMAN IS BOUND BY THE LAW
[1:16:38] TO HER HUSBAND WHILE HE HE LIVES, WE TOO
[1:16:40] WERE BOUND TO THE RULE OF SIN. BUT
[1:16:43] ACCORDING TO PAUL'S TEACHING, IF THAT
[1:16:46] HUSBAND DIES, that woman is free to
[1:16:49] marry another. AND LIKEWISE, ONLY
[1:16:52] THROUGH THE DEATH OF her old man, the
[1:16:55] sin nature, can we be LOOSED TO BE
[1:16:58] JOINED to covenant with Christ, and only
[1:17:01] then can we bear the fruit under
[1:17:04] righteousness through our union with
[1:17:05] him. SO THE FIRST UNION COULD PRODUCE
[1:17:09] NOTHING BUT DEATH, WHICH IS SEPARATION
[1:17:11] FROM GOD. AND CONDEMNATION. BUT CHRIST
[1:17:15] DIED AND IN THAT DEATH WE ALSO DIED TO
[1:17:19] THE LAW
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; AND NOW WE ARE RESURRECTED IN UNION WITH
[1:17:23] CHRIST AND WE ARE FREE TO BE MARRIED TO
[1:17:26] ANOTHER. WHEN THE OLD HUSBAND IS DEAD,
[1:17:29] THE CHURCH IS LOOSED FROM THAT FORMAL
[1:17:31] covenant and and she is SHE IS LAWFULLY
[1:17:35] THEN UNITED MARRIED TO THE RISEN CHRIST.
[1:17:38] And this new UNION PRODUCES GODLY
[1:17:42] FRUITS.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; And here's THE POINT THAT PAUL IS
[1:17:45] MAKING. WE CANNOT CLAIM UNION WITH
[1:17:48] CHRIST TO BE MARRIED to him and remain
[1:17:52] under the old dominion OF THE WORLD, THE
[1:17:55] FLESH, AND THE LAW.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; ANY MORE THAN A WOMAN CAN live with a
[1:18:00] second husband while the first one's
[1:18:02] still alive,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE SPIRITUAL ADULTERY. AND PAUL
[1:18:06] IS ANNOUNCING THERE MUST BE A FULL
[1:18:09] SEPARATION FROM THE OLD LIFE.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BEFORE THE BRIDE CAN LAWFULLY
[1:18:16] UNITE WITH Christ
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; in Romans 7, YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT JUST
[1:18:20] given a lesson IN IN LEGAL PROCEDURE.
[1:18:23] He's considering the spiritual reality
[1:18:26] AND HE SAYS THE LAW HAD DOMINION OVER
[1:18:28] THE MAN. As long as she liveth, BUT IF
[1:18:32] HER HUSBAND BE DEAD, SHE IS LOOSED.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. That's right.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; You can look back at your past life
[1:18:42] where you were married and united to
[1:18:44] sin.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; But you can look back and say that old
[1:18:48] man is dead.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:18:51] And I have a right to be married to
[1:18:53] Jesus Christ.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and because I'm married to
[1:18:58] him, I am a oh my. Instead of being a
[1:19:01] slave to this law, I am a love slave to
[1:19:05] Jesus Christ.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not because I have to, BUT BECAUSE
[1:19:08] I LOVE HIM.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL TEACHES THE LAW HATH NO MORE
[1:19:14] DOMINION OVER THE CHURCH. THE OLD
[1:19:16] COVENANT, THOUGH ONCE BINDING, IS DEAD
[1:19:18] TO US. AND WE ARE DEAD TO IT THROUGH THE
[1:19:21] BODY OF CHRIST. AND AND AND THAT MEANS
[1:19:24] THAT THE CHURCH IS NO LONGER BOUND TO
[1:19:26] THAT FIRST HUSBAND. AND THOUGH WE AS
[1:19:29] GENTILES WERE NEVER UNDER THE MOSAIC
[1:19:32] LAW, THE PRINCIPLE STILL APPLIES. ALL OF
[1:19:35] US, ALL HUMANITY, JEW AND GENTILE, WE
[1:19:39] WERE ALL BORN UNDER BONDAGE,
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; whether to the law or to the law of sin
[1:19:44] and death. BUT THROUGH OUR
[1:19:47] IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST AND IN HIS
[1:19:50] DEATH AND RESURRECTION, WE ARE RAISED TO
[1:19:53] A NEW LIFE
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; UNDER A NEW COVENANT. AND OUR NEW
[1:19:57] HUSBAND IS CHRIST THE WORD. And he's the
[1:20:01] one THAT GOVERNS US NOT BY EX EXTERNAL
[1:20:04] RULES BUT BY THE INDWELLING Holy Spirit.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; SO WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER THE BONDAGE of
[1:20:11] legal ordinances. I I want you just TO
[1:20:14] THINK ABOUT THE OLD HUSBAND, the law,
[1:20:16] and you know, he was he was pretty mean.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; He had some strict rules
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; and you better follow them.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Under the heavy hand of
[1:20:29] that old husband, the law, the seventh
[1:20:31] day, which is Saturday, was was required
[1:20:35] to be kept as a Sabbath day. AND
[1:20:38] VIOLATORS WERE PUNISHED SEVERELY, EVEN
[1:20:41] TO DEATH.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; JUST BY PICKING UP A STICKMEN.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW IN CHRIST, WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER
[1:20:51] A DAYBASED REST. HE HIMSELF IS OUR
[1:20:54] SABBATH.
[1:20:55] THE HOLY GHOST GIVES US REST. NOT JUST
[1:20:58] ONE DAY A WEEK, BUT A CONTINUAL REST IN
[1:21:01] HIM.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; UNDER THE OLD LAW, THE HUSBAND REQUIRED
[1:21:06] CIRCUMCISION
[1:21:07] WAS REQUIRED FOR EVERY MALE. AND THOSE
[1:21:10] WHO WERE NOT UH WAS NOT CIRCUMCISED WAS
[1:21:13] CUT OFF FROM the covenant
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; outside of the covenant of God.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; But now in our union with Christ, the
[1:21:21] true circumcision is one not made with
[1:21:24] hands. It's done by the baptism of the
[1:21:26] Holy Ghost. And that spiritual seal cuts
[1:21:30] off flesh and places us in Christ.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT ELSE ARE WE NOT SUBJECT TO? I
[1:21:36] mean, there'd be a lot of things I could
[1:21:38] talk about, but let's just let's just go
[1:21:40] down for a minute. We're not subject to
[1:21:41] animal sacrifices
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; and ceremonial rituals,
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE WHY? CHRIST IS OUR
[1:21:49] PERFECT SACRIFICE. WE'RE NOT SUBJECT TO
[1:21:53] THE LEVITICAL PRIESTHOOD BECAUSE CHRIST
[1:21:55] IS OUR HIGH PRIEST FOREVER AND WE'RE NOW
[1:21:58] PRIEST UNTO GOD OURSELVES.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE DIETARY
[1:22:03] LAWS AND UNCLEAN FOOD RESTRICTION
[1:22:06] BECAUSE IN CHRIST NO FOOD CAN DEFILE a
[1:22:09] sanctifying heart.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO FEAST DAYS AND NEW MOONS AND
[1:22:14] HOLY CONVOCATIONS THESE WERE SHADOW AND
[1:22:18] THE SUBSTANCE THE REALITY IS CHRIST.
[1:22:21] RIGHTEOUSNESS BY WORKS. WE ARE NOW NO
[1:22:24] LONGER RIGHTEOUS BY OUR WORKS. WE ARE
[1:22:26] JUSTIFIED OR DECLARED RIGHTEOUS BY
[1:22:28] FAITH,
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; not by our lawkeeping.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND CONDEMNATION WERE THE LAW
[1:22:33] CONDEMN. LET ME TELL YOU, THERE IS
[1:22:37] THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS THIS HUSBAND CHRIST DON'T
[1:22:44] CONDEMN YOU.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; READ ROMANS CHAPTER 8. WILL CHRIST
[1:22:49] CONDEMN YOU? NO. HE DIED FOR YOU.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; He'll freely give you all things.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; He's a loving husband.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He's not holding over
[1:23:01] you do this and you'll die. No, he's
[1:23:03] offering grace. Grace. Amazing grace.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; And you out of love respond to that
[1:23:10] grace. So, WE'RE NO LONGER MARRIED TO A
[1:23:13] HUSBAND WHO DEMANDED OBEDIENCE through
[1:23:15] fear and and um and ceremony, but we're
[1:23:19] now united to a husband who gives us
[1:23:21] love and life and power through the
[1:23:23] spirit. And the old husband that ruled
[1:23:26] the outer man with tablets and stones
[1:23:29] has been replaced. And we have a new
[1:23:32] husband. AND HE WRITES HIS LAWS IN OUR
[1:23:35] HEARTS. AND UNDER THIS COVENANT, WE'RE
[1:23:37] NOT LED BY REGULATIONS, BUT BY
[1:23:40] RELATIONSHIP. AND WE SERVE NOT IN THE
[1:23:44] OLDNESS OF THE LETTER, BUT IN THE
[1:23:46] NEWNESS of the spirit.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; SO JUST AS PAUL IN HIS DAY DECLARED that
[1:23:50] the law no longer held dominion over
[1:23:53] THOSE WHO ARE IN CHRIST, brother
[1:23:55] Brandham under the same prophetic
[1:23:57] anointing, he proclaimed to us in the
[1:24:01] sermon. He said, "THIS IS MY
[1:24:03] THANKSGIVING MESSAGE TO THE BRIDE OF
[1:24:06] CHRIST. You are invisibly united with
[1:24:10] Jesus Christ."
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And he preaches the invisible union.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That and AND IN THAT MESSAGE, HE'S
[1:24:20] TELLING US DENOMINATIONAL SYSTEMS WHICH
[1:24:23] WERE OUR HUSBAND
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; NO LONGER HOLD LORDSHIP OVER THIS BRIDE.
[1:24:30] AMEN.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; AND HE EXPLAINED, "WE WERE ONCE MARRIED
[1:24:34] TO MAN-MADE RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS AND WE
[1:24:37] BORE ITS NAME AND WE CARRIED ITS
[1:24:40] DOCTRINE AND WE LIVED UNDER HIS
[1:24:42] AUTHORITY. BUT NOW THAT HUSBAND, THE OLD
[1:24:44] DENOMINATIONAL WORLDLY CHURCH HAS
[1:24:47] [screaming] DIED TO US AND WE'RE MARRIED
[1:24:49] TO ANOTHER."
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; You may tell you who it is. Christ the
[1:24:53] word.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. This don't marry you to a
[1:24:56] preacher. Come on, somebody.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not placing We're not
[1:25:01] replacing the pope with a new bishop.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. No, no, no. We are married to
[1:25:07] Christ, the word.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; AND IN THE VISION, BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS
[1:25:11] SHOWN A A woman representing the church,
[1:25:14] ATTEMPTING TO RISE INTO HER POSITION.
[1:25:16] BUT EVERY TIME SHE TRIED, SHE WAS
[1:25:19] BEATING BACK DOWN WITH A THREE- CORNERED
[1:25:21] CLUB symbolizing the false and
[1:25:23] oppressive doctrine of Trinity. A
[1:25:26] MAN-MADE INVENTION NEVER TAUGHT BY THE
[1:25:28] SCRIPTURE. IT WAS A WEAPON THAT WAS USED
[1:25:31] BY RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS to keep the
[1:25:34] church in submissions TO CREEDS INSTEAD
[1:25:37] OF THE WORD. And you can you can even TO
[1:25:39] THEM THAT ARE BOUND UNDER THAT LAW. YOU
[1:25:41] CAN SHOW THEM IN THE BIBLE.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; AND THEY ARE BOUND TO [screaming] THAT
[1:25:46] LAW OF THAT HUSBAND,
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT YOU.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU HAVE BEEN SET FREE TO
[1:25:55] SERVE THE LIVING GOD.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE NOT BEAT DOWN BY SOME
[1:25:59] TRINITARIAN CLUB EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO
[1:26:02] RISE UP IN POWER.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. By now, by the revelation of the
[1:26:09] seals and the calling out of the bride,
[1:26:12] we're no longer subject to that
[1:26:14] oppression.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; The system of man is dead
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; to the true believer.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER the
[1:26:22] heavy hand of a pope
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; or a priesthood.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; I mean, OR SOME DENOMINATIONAL
[1:26:29] HEADQUARTERS,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; NOR DO WE HAVE TO SUBMIT TO COUNCILS AND
[1:26:32] CREEDS OR catechisms
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; through THE UNION WITH CHRIST, OUR TRUE
[1:26:37] BRIDEGROOM. WE ARE FREE FROM the edicts
[1:26:41] of men.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; There's no more paying for forgiveness
[1:26:45] OF SINS.
[1:26:47] NO MORE INDULGENCES. NO MORE PAYING TO
[1:26:50] HAVE LOVED ONES PRAYED OUT OF PURGATORY
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; BY ONE OFFERING. HE HAD PERFECTED
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; FOREVER
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; THEM THAT ARE SANCTIFIED.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE NO LONGER HAVE TO GO TO PRIEST
[1:27:04] FOR confessional as a MEDIATOR BETWEEN
[1:27:07] US AND GOD.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE IS ONE MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD
[1:27:12] AND MAN, AND THAT'S THE MAN Christ
[1:27:14] Jesus. And forgiveness NOW COMES
[1:27:17] DIRECTLY FROM OUR HUSBAND.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And I want you TO KNOW IT'S FULL AND
[1:27:23] FREE.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO
[1:27:27] OBLIGATIONS TO MAN-MADE RITUALS AND
[1:27:29] SACRAMENTS OF SALVATION. ALTHOUGH WE'LL
[1:27:32] OBSERVE WATER BAPTISM AND FOOT WASH AND
[1:27:34] COMMUNION and whatever. They they are
[1:27:37] scriptural ordinance, but they're not
[1:27:39] saving rituals.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; WE ARE SAVED BY GRACE THROUGH FAITH.
[1:27:45] NOT BY CEREMONY.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE NO LONGER UNDER THE
[1:27:50] HIERARCHY OF OF SPIRITUAL CONTROL. THE
[1:27:53] FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY IS TO SERVE THE BODY,
[1:27:57] NOT DOMINATE IT.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE BELONGS TO THE BRIDEGROOM.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; CHRIST IS A HEAD OF THE CHURCH, NOT A
[1:28:04] BISHOP, NOT A BOARD, NOT ORGANIZATION,
[1:28:08] NOT A HEADQUARTERS, NO. NOT EVEN ONE AT
[1:28:10] JEFFERSONVILLE.
[1:28:12] creeds and confessions REPLACING THE
[1:28:15] WORD. WE'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THAT ANYMORE.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE IS NOT FORMED BY
[1:28:19] DENOMINATIONAL STATEMENTS. WE DO NOT
[1:28:22] HAVE TO say the apostles creed.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WE INSTEAD DON'T LIVE BY THAT
[1:28:28] CREED. WE LIVE BY EVERY WORD.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; WE WE NO LONGER HAVE DENOMINATIONAL
[1:28:36] NAMES AND IDENTITIES.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE NO LONGER WEAR NAMES LIKE
[1:28:40] BAPTIST OR CATHOLIC OR PENTECOSTAL, BUT
[1:28:43] WE HAVE TAKEN ON THE NAME OF OUR
[1:28:45] HUSBAND.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I I I'm ANNOUNCING TO YOU THE RULE
[1:28:51] OF THE FIRST HUSBAND IS OVER.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; All these religious institutions, their
[1:29:00] traditions, teachings, they all acted as
[1:29:03] our first husband.
[1:29:05] They ruled our spiritual life. They
[1:29:07] shaped our beliefs. They demanded our
[1:29:09] loyalty. BUT NOW THAT SYSTEM IS DEAD TO
[1:29:13] US
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE DEAD TO IT. AND THE BONDAGE IS
[1:29:16] BROKEN. AND CHRIST, OUR HUSBAND, HAS
[1:29:19] PAID THE SIN DEBT ONCE AND FOR ALL.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; AND FORGIVENESS DOES NOT COME FROM A
[1:29:25] MAN, BUT IS FREELY GIVEN TO US BY THE
[1:29:27] BRIDEGROOM. AND WE'RE FREE TO SERVE
[1:29:30] CHRIST AND THE LIBERTY OF THE SPIRIT,
[1:29:32] NOT UNDER THE BONDAGE OF RELIGIOUS LAW.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:36] We no longer answer to headquarters,
[1:29:39] councils, popes, senods, seminaries. Oh,
[1:29:43] listen. I hope Jeffersonville hears
[1:29:45] this.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; We don't answer to them either.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; We answer to the voice of the
[1:29:51] bridegroom.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; And that's not brother Brandham either.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; That's the revealed word for our day.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Sure, he delivered it. God used his
[1:30:06] voice.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; He was not the voice of God. He was a
[1:30:12] voice of a man God used.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Now, AND SO AS BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:30:16] PREACHED, THE BRIDE MUST COME TO HER
[1:30:19] INVISIBLE union with the word. AND WE'RE
[1:30:22] NOT JUST BELIEVE IN A DOCTRINE. IT'S AN
[1:30:24] INVISIBLE UNION BECAUSE IT ISN'T WITH A
[1:30:28] PHYSICAL MAN ON EARTH. IT'S NOT THROUGH
[1:30:30] A EARTHLY CEREMONY. IT'S A SPIRITUAL
[1:30:33] JOINING OF THE SOUL TO THE believer
[1:30:36] of the believer TO TO CHRIST. YOU KNOW,
[1:30:39] NO ONE CAN PHYSICALLY SEE IT, BUT ITS
[1:30:42] EFFECTS ARE EVIDENT.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU CAN'T SEE THE UNION OF CHRIST
[1:30:48] AND HIS BRIDE BECAUSE IT'S SPIRITUAL,
[1:30:50] IT'S INTERNAL, IS REVEALED ONLY BY THE
[1:30:52] HOLY SPIRIT. AND THE REAL UNION IS NOT
[1:30:55] EMOTION, IS NOT SENSATION, NOR IS IT
[1:30:58] INTELLECTUAL UM BELIEF, BUT IT'S AN
[1:31:01] EXPERIENCE. IT'S A LITERAL CHANGE OF
[1:31:05] NATURE WHERE THE OLD NATURE DIES AND
[1:31:09] CHRIST ENTERS.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE ENTERING A MARRIAGE COVENANT
[1:31:13] WITH THE RESURRECTED WORD. CHRIST
[1:31:15] HIMSELF IS NOT IS NOT A CEREMONY with
[1:31:18] rains and DRESSES AND BEAUTIFUL SONGS
[1:31:21] and visible celebration. IT'S WHEN
[1:31:24] CHRIST THE BRIDEGROOM TAKES YOU AS A
[1:31:26] PART OF his bride in covenant by giving
[1:31:29] you his holy spirit.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; And that UNITES YOU WITH HIM ETERNALLY.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, NO UNION WITH THE SYSTEM of
[1:31:39] man. THERE'S NO CHURCH JOINING. THERE'S
[1:31:42] NO UNION UP WITH CREEDS OR MAN-MADE
[1:31:45] DOCTRINES OR ORGANIZATION OR OR MAN-MADE
[1:31:48] HEADQUARTERS. ONLY A PURE WORD BRIDE
[1:31:52] joined to the word group.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL USES THE LAW OF MARRIAGE to
[1:31:58] show this. He says THE CHURCH HAD TO DIE
[1:32:02] TO HER FIRST husband
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; so she CAN BE LEGALLY JOINED to the
[1:32:07] resurrected Christ
[1:32:10] AND SO THAT SHE CAN BEAR THE FRUIT OF
[1:32:12] HIS LIFE, HIS word in this final hour.
[1:32:16] So only ONE HUSBAND NOW, CHRIST AND HIS
[1:32:19] BRIDE, UNITED BY the revealed word,
[1:32:22] invisible now but visible soon at the
[1:32:25] marriage supper.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the true church THAT IS TO BE
[1:32:29] MARRIED IS Miss Grace,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; the elect lady.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; SHE'S A VIRGIN LIKE MARY. SHE'S ELECTED
[1:32:38] TO BRING FORTH CHILDREN BORN BY THE
[1:32:40] WORD.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; COME ON. SHE IS NOT A JUST SELECTED FOR
[1:32:44] A RAPTURE BUT SHE SELECTED CHOSEN
[1:32:48] PREDESTINATED TO BRING FORTH HIS SEED
[1:32:52] LIFE IN THE FORM of children
[1:32:55] who will reflect his the life and the
[1:32:58] nature of their father the word.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand this ain't
[1:33:03] all just about a rapture.
[1:33:06] It's about being married to Christ
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; and bringing forth his children.
[1:33:14] Now, so she's the woman that John speaks
[1:33:18] of in second John to the elect lady. THE
[1:33:22] WORD ELECT MEANS CHOSEN OUT OF THE MANY.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; JUST AS LIKE THERE WERE MANY women in
[1:33:29] Israel, but one virgin Mary,
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; ONE WOMAN ELECTED TO BRING FORTH THE
[1:33:36] BODY OF JESUS CHRIST ON INTO the earth.
[1:33:39] EVEN SO, GOD HAS CHOSEN ONE WOMAN IN
[1:33:42] this age.
[1:33:44] Hear me now. This might sound ex
[1:33:47] exclusive and inclusive or whatever you
[1:33:49] want to call it, but there's there's
[1:33:52] only one ONE WOMAN IN THIS AGE. IT'S HIS
[1:33:57] BRIDE, THE ELECT LADY.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; And like Mary, SHE IS HIGHLY FAVORED OF
[1:34:02] THE LORD. AMEN.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE THAT SHE WOULD
[1:34:08] cons conceive by the overshadowing of
[1:34:11] the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Now, she's not a denomination. She's not
[1:34:18] a system. She's not a mixed crowd. She's
[1:34:21] a called out woman. She's separated from
[1:34:24] all the rest. And through grace, she has
[1:34:27] been chosen, called, espoused, and
[1:34:30] prepared for Christ.
[1:34:32] AND JUST AS A MAN CHOOSES HIS WIFE TO BE
[1:34:35] THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILDREN, THE BRIDE IS
[1:34:37] CHOSEN as his spouse, LISTEN
[1:34:40] TO BE THE BEDDING GROUND TO BRING FORTH
[1:34:43] CHILDREN in his image. Now listen, IT
[1:34:47] IT'S AN UNSPOKEN THING. Are you with me?
[1:34:52] IT MAY BE AN UNSPOKEN THING, BUT WHEN A
[1:34:54] MAN CHOOSES A WIFE, HE IS CHOOSING the
[1:34:58] mother,
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; THE BEDDING GROUND
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; FOR HIS CHILDREN.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD IS CHOOSING A BRIDE,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; HE IS CHOOSING A BEDDING GROUND.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; For his children. Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; She has to be the environment, the
[1:35:17] atmosphere, the place, the bedding
[1:35:20] ground where the word can bring forth
[1:35:23] children.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Now hold tight. Since he is the word,
[1:35:32] SHE MUST BE OF HIS OWN KIND. HE CANNOT
[1:35:34] MARRY something that's not of his kind.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; THE LAW OF GOD IS KIND AFTER KIND.
[1:35:42] SPECIES AFTER SPECIES.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE OFFSPRING OF THIS UNION MUST
[1:35:47] BE CHILDREN OF THE WORD. THEY MUST BEAR
[1:35:50] HIS LIKENESS.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; THESE CHILDREN WILL HAVE HIS ATTRIBUTES.
[1:35:54] THEY WILL HAVE HIS SAME CHARACTER CUZ
[1:35:57] THEY ARE HIS OF THE SAME LIFE.
[1:36:00] AND TO QUOTE THE PROPHET, HE SAID,
[1:36:02] "NOTICE WHAT KIND OF CHILDREN SHE'S
[1:36:04] BEARING. THAT TELLS WHAT her papa their
[1:36:07] papa is, whether it's the first Adam or
[1:36:10] the second Adam. IF THE CHURCH BRINGS
[1:36:12] FORTH THE CHILD OF THE SECOND ADAM, he
[1:36:15] acts like the the he acts the second way
[1:36:18] Adam's way of acting LIKE THEY DID ON
[1:36:21] THE DAY OF PENTECOST. THAT IS THE TRUE
[1:36:24] SECOND ADAM'S CHILDREN. THEIR NATURE IS
[1:36:26] LIKE his and hers. Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; So if you GET IT, SHE'S GOING TO BRING
[1:36:31] FORTH CHILDREN OF THE WORD
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'LL HAVE THE SECOND ADAM'S WAY
[1:36:36] OF ACTING
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; LIKE THEY DID ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Now if the children you that a church is
[1:36:45] producing is not matching Pentecost.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; They are illegitimate to this message.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; They are illegitimate to this Christ.
[1:36:56] That's
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; their denominational offspring even
[1:36:59] though they may not be officially
[1:37:01] denomination.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going to drive this home. I'm going
[1:37:05] to show you first of all a contrast and
[1:37:08] we're going to look at the great
[1:37:11] because in contrast to the virgin bride
[1:37:13] that is chosen of God to bear his sheep,
[1:37:15] produces offspring is another woman in
[1:37:18] the Bible,
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; the great and her daughters.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; They're just like her. They're harlots.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; NOW IN REVELATION 17, JOHN SEES A
[1:37:28] striking vision. He says, "THERE CAME
[1:37:30] ONE OF THE SEVEN ANGELS,
[1:37:33] saying unto me, come hither, and I'll
[1:37:35] SHOW YOU THE JUDGMENT of the great
[1:37:37] that siteth upon many water." And upon
[1:37:39] her forehead was the name written,
[1:37:41] Mystery Babylon, the great, the mother
[1:37:43] of harlots and abominations of the
[1:37:45] earth. Now, this woman was not a literal
[1:37:49] prostitute.
[1:37:51] SHE WAS A SYMBOLIC FIGURE REPRESENTING
[1:37:54] AN UNFAITHFUL CHURCH.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; In the scripture, AS YOU KNOW, IT OFTEN
[1:37:59] uh it often represents the woman
[1:38:02] represents a church and and therefore
[1:38:04] the great represents a religious
[1:38:07] system that claims to be the bride OF
[1:38:10] CHRIST
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; BUT HAS BETRAYED HIM.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; COMMITTING SPIRITUAL ADULTERY BY UNITING
[1:38:17] WITH KINGS AND SYSTEMS OF THE of the
[1:38:19] earth. AND SO WHY IS HE CALLED A
[1:38:23] A is a WOMAN WHO GIVES HERSELF TO
[1:38:27] A man to men that is not her husband.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; She she'll DO IT FOR MONEY, POWER, OR
[1:38:34] GAINS.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; AND SPIRITUALLY, THIS WOMAN, THE CHURCH,
[1:38:39] HAS DONE THE SAME THING. SHE CLAIMS TO
[1:38:42] BE MARRIED TO CHRIST BUT HAS RECEIVED
[1:38:44] THE SEEDS OF OTHERS, CREEDS, TRADITIONS,
[1:38:48] AND DOCTRINES OF MEN.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; I I I just don't get it. You know, when
[1:38:53] you are when you understand these
[1:38:54] things, how you could go out and join a
[1:38:57] denomination after hearing this truth.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; It's written plain in the word.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Instead of remaining a virgin to the
[1:39:05] word, SHE UNITED WITH POLITICAL POWER
[1:39:08] AND HUMAN REASONING.
[1:39:10] SHE NO LONGER PRODUCES CHILDREN OF THE
[1:39:13] WORD, BUT children of confusion, which
[1:39:15] is what Babylon means.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND COMPROMISE and carnality. AND
[1:39:21] THAT IS WHY SHE'S CALLED MYSTERY
[1:39:23] BABYLON, WHICH MEANS CONFUSION BY
[1:39:26] MIXTURE, MIXING TRUTH WITH ERA,
[1:39:29] SCRIPTURE WITH TRADITION, AND MAN'S
[1:39:31] IDEAS WITH WITH GOD'S COMMANDS.
[1:39:35] and and HER DAUGHTERS ARE CALLED IN THE
[1:39:38] BIBLE HARLOTS.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; SO SHE IS THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS. SHE'S
[1:39:44] NOT ALONE. Means she has offspring.
[1:39:47] She's a mother. SHE'S A BEDDING ground
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; for these creeds and dogmas
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; which produce harlots.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Come on. WHO ARE JUST LIKE HER. AND
[1:40:01] THESE DENOMINATIONAL CHURCHES HAVE COME
[1:40:03] OUT OF HER AND YET THEY FOLLOW THE SAME
[1:40:06] PATTERN.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; THEY CLAIM TO be Christian. They use the
[1:40:10] name of Jesus. BUT THEY REJECT HIS FULL
[1:40:13] WORD AND CHOOSE CREEDS AND THEOLOGICAL
[1:40:15] SYSTEMS INSTEAD. AND LIKE THEIR MOTHER,
[1:40:18] THEY TOO RECEIVE another seed. NOT THE
[1:40:21] PURE UNADULTERATED WORD OF GOD, BUT the
[1:40:24] seed OF MAN AND INTERPRETATIONS AND
[1:40:26] IDEAS AND CHURCH THEOLOGIES. THIS MAKES
[1:40:29] THEM SPIRITUAL HARLOTS.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; For they are united with another THAN
[1:40:34] CHRIST, PRODUCING DENOMINATIONAL
[1:40:38] OFFSPRING INSTEAD OF WORDBORN SONS AND
[1:40:41] DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, brother Brandham told us the
[1:40:47] same. He said, um, and why I'm against
[1:40:49] organized religion, he said, remember
[1:40:51] mother Rome was found in her full of
[1:40:53] blasphemous names, a mother of harlots.
[1:40:56] Then if they are harlots, what is a
[1:40:58] harlot? What is a The same thing
[1:41:01] as uh same thing as a harlot. It's a
[1:41:05] woman that lives untrue to her marriage
[1:41:07] vow. AND ANY CHURCH THAT CLAIMS TO be
[1:41:10] the church of CHRIST AND DENIES GOD'S
[1:41:13] WORD, she is untrue to her marriage vow.
[1:41:17] THEN SHE COMMITS ADULTERY BY ADDING
[1:41:20] DOGMA, WHOREDOM WITH the world, HER
[1:41:24] WISDOM INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING CHRIST AND
[1:41:26] THE POWER of his resurrection power of
[1:41:28] the Holy Ghost. She is a mother of
[1:41:30] harlot that has done the same thing.
[1:41:33] Now, so Jesus, HE IS NOT COMING FOR A
[1:41:38] CHURCH BOUND
[1:41:40] BY MAN-MADE CREEDS,
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; BY MAN-MADE TRADITIONS.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; HE'S COMING FOR A WORD BRIDE. HE IS THE
[1:41:48] WORD and no true union CAN HAPPEN UNLESS
[1:41:51] THE BRIDE RECEIVES HIS SEED ONLY.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MARRIAGE COMMITMENT.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. LISTEN, HE'S NOT GOING TO SHARE
[1:42:03] HIS SEED life
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; with any other either.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; His seed is sacred.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody help me preach.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND NEITHER CAN THE BRIDE RECEIVE
[1:42:18] anything but his seed only.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS EVE FELL AT THE BEGINNING BY
[1:42:26] RECEIVING A WRONG SEED IN THE GARDEN
[1:42:28] PRODUCING CAIN, SO MODERN CHURCHES FALL
[1:42:31] WHEN THEY RECEIVED the seed of man
[1:42:34] rather than Christ the word. And every
[1:42:36] church CLAIMING TO BE THE BRIDE OF
[1:42:38] CHRIST. THEY MUST BE PREGNANTATED,
[1:42:42] IMPREGNATED with the seed of the word.
[1:42:44] IF SHE RECEIVES ANY OTHER SEED
[1:42:48] SHE'S A HARLOT IN GOD'S EYES.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; NOW, how are YOU GOING TO TELL BY HER
[1:42:54] OFFSPRING?
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; IF HER OFFSPRING ISN'T LIKE PENTECOST,
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; SHE'S A
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF THEY GO BY MESSAGE
[1:43:04] TITLE.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; THIS THE CHILDREN OF THESE SPIRITUAL
[1:43:08] UNIONS ARE NOT BORN OF GOD'S SPIRIT.
[1:43:11] THEY'RE BORN AS HUMAN SYSTEMS, CREEDS OF
[1:43:13] MAN, ORGANIZATIONAL AGENDAS. THEY MAY BE
[1:43:16] RELIGIOUS. THEY BE MAY BE MORAL. THEY BE
[1:43:19] MAY BE INTELLECTUALLY STIRRED, BUT
[1:43:22] THEY'RE NOT BORN AGAIN BY THE
[1:43:23] INCORRUPTIBLE SEED OF THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:43:26] They're hybrids.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; They're like a mule. They're strong,
[1:43:29] hardworking, but sterile, unable to
[1:43:32] produce true life.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Plenty of good works. They'll
[1:43:36] outwork you. Amen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Activities, programs, tradition,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; but no lifegiving seed.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; That brings forth Christ.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; I I'm trying to get something to you. As
[1:43:49] a church, WE MUST BE THE BEDDING ground
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; of the seed word.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; And produce children
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; like him.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; NOW, SO THE BRIDE IN CONTRAST IS A
[1:44:04] VIRGIN. YES.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; NOT A
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; SHE'S CALLED A VIRGIN.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; She is washed in the word.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; SHE'S IMPREGNATED WITH CHRIST'S SEED.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; SHE'S PRODUCING CHILDREN IN HIS IMAGE.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT MEMBERS OF SOME
[1:44:20] DENOMINATION, BUT SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF
[1:44:22] GOD. SHE REFUSES TO be united with ANY
[1:44:26] MAN-MADE SYSTEM. SHE'S FAITHFUL TO ONE
[1:44:29] HUSBAND. THAT'S CHRIST TO THE THE WORD.
[1:44:32] And the and her daughters ARE
[1:44:34] JUDGED. AND WHAT IS THEIR SIN? SPIRITUAL
[1:44:36] ADULTERY.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; THEY RECEIVE AND DECEIVE THE DOCTRINE OF
[1:44:41] MAN RATHER THAN CHRIST the word.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; And what is the result in offspring?
[1:44:46] Illegitimate children.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Hybrid Christians who bear the image of
[1:44:51] theology, not the nature of Christ.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Somebody with me now.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Now, of course, we we believe we're part
[1:45:01] of that elected group here. And I'd say
[1:45:04] that's true of of those around the
[1:45:07] nations across the world that have heard
[1:45:09] his call. But but YOU REMEMBER HERE'S
[1:45:12] WHY THIS woman is used in in the
[1:45:15] illustration. A woman is used. Now God
[1:45:18] is typing SOMETHING HERE BECAUSE CHRIST
[1:45:20] IS A BRIDEGROOM. THE church is his bride
[1:45:23] and they're in covenant relationship and
[1:45:26] they are just a woman is a type of the
[1:45:28] church. Eve was a type taken from Adam's
[1:45:31] side. REBECCA WAS A TYPE CHOSEN FOR
[1:45:34] ISAAC. Ruth was A TYPE REDEEMED BY BOAZ.
[1:45:38] ESTHER WAS A TYPE ELECTED TO TAKE the
[1:45:41] queen's place. MARY WAS A TYPE CARRYING
[1:45:44] THE LITERAL WORD MADE FLESH.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO GOD TYPED IT ALL THE WAY DOWN.
[1:45:49] AND ALL OF THEM IS POINTING TO ONE FINAL
[1:45:53] WOMAN.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. AMEN.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST misgraced
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; the elect lady,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; ELECTED, CHOSEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:46:05] THE WORLD.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh brother, YOU SEE ALL THE
[1:46:09] SCRIPTURES POINTING TO THIS ONE THING
[1:46:12] AND SHE CAN THAT'S WHY SHE MUST COME
[1:46:15] FORTH BECAUSE SHE IS THE CROWNING
[1:46:18] ACHIEVEMENT OF ALL REDEMPTION.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SHE'S A PART OF HIM. SHE'S A
[1:46:24] MANIFESTATION OF EVERY TYPE AND
[1:46:27] REVELATION SPOKE CONCERNING THE BRIDE
[1:46:29] THROUGHOUT THE AGES.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; She can only express the life of the
[1:46:35] groom
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; because that is her real identity.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; And if she produces something different
[1:46:43] from what he produced, if her life
[1:46:47] projects or reflects another nature,
[1:46:51] then she's not the bride. That's right.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the bride is flesh of his
[1:46:57] flesh, bone of his bone, life of his
[1:47:00] life, power of his power,
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; she is him
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; expressed
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; in bride form,
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; And just as the first woman was taken
[1:47:14] from Adam's side and flesh and spirit,
[1:47:17] you know, flesh and spirit taken from
[1:47:19] the man, SO WAS BRIDE. THE BRIDE is
[1:47:21] taken from Christ. The spirit that came
[1:47:24] from him. The feminine receptive nature
[1:47:27] of worship and submiss submission TO
[1:47:29] FLESH THAT WAS OPENED AT CALVARY from
[1:47:32] which the church receive water, blood
[1:47:34] and spirit. The cleansing and the life.
[1:47:38] AMEN. FROM THIS GOD FORMED THE
[1:47:40] MECHANICS, THE WORDS AND THE DYNAMICS OF
[1:47:43] THE SPIRIT THAT TOGETHER MAKES THE WIFE
[1:47:46] OF THE LAMB. AND SHE CARRIES HIS SPIRIT
[1:47:49] AND CARRIES HIS WORD, THE COMPLETE
[1:47:52] MECHANICS AND DYNAMICS AND THEREFORE CAN
[1:47:54] ONLY MANIFEST WHAT HE IS BECAUSE SHE IS
[1:47:59] HIM IN BRIDE FORM.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; If you IF I COULD GET IT TO YOU, WE LOOK
[1:48:05] FOR THE COMING OF CHRIST AND WE WILL
[1:48:07] MEET HIM IN THE AIR.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER HE COME
[1:48:12] FIRST IN WORD FORM TO A PROPHET TO
[1:48:14] SHOUT. HE COMES SECOND AS VOICE
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; OF THE ARCHANGEL in a bride,
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; the word made flesh and he will finally
[1:48:23] come and manifest himself materially,
[1:48:25] literally
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; in groom form in the meeting in the air.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; But he's got the word has to take on
[1:48:33] flesh.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; And this is invisible union
[1:48:39] not to church system but to the risen
[1:48:41] word Christ.
[1:48:43] Now, so, so the church as we,
[1:48:48] you know, just apply the type the CHURCH
[1:48:51] WHEN SHE TRIES TO UNITE CREED AND DOGMA
[1:48:54] with the pure word of God, she is AN
[1:48:58] ADULTERESS. SHE CANNOT be married to the
[1:49:02] law, whether it be THE OLD TESTAMENT LAW
[1:49:04] or law of sin and death or nor
[1:49:08] DENOMINATIONAL
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; AND BE MARRIED TO CHRIST, THE WORD AT
[1:49:12] THE SAME TIME. YOU CAN'T HAVE two
[1:49:14] husbands.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT PAUL WAS
[1:49:19] TEACHING TO CRY AT CHRIST. The church I
[1:49:21] mean cannot be married to the LAW AND
[1:49:25] MARRIED TO CHRIST at the same time. It
[1:49:27] is spiritual adultery. NOW THIS WAS
[1:49:30] HAPPENING in the early church.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHY PAUL IS DEALING WITH
[1:49:38] THIS SUBJECT.
[1:49:40] HE SAID THERE IS ACTUALLY SPIRITS OF
[1:49:43] ADULTERY IS GOING on
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; in the message community.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; AND IN ACTS 15 WE READ OF CERTAIN MEN
[1:49:53] WHO CLAIMED TO BE believers but was
[1:49:55] still Pharisee at heart.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; And though they HAD OUTWARDLY
[1:50:02] JOINED the early church and but inwardly
[1:50:05] they were still clinging to the law of
[1:50:07] Moses. AND THESE MEN ATTEMPTED TO BRING
[1:50:10] THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH BORN BY THE
[1:50:12] OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY GHOST AT
[1:50:14] PENTECOST BACK UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF THE
[1:50:16] LAW.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; AND AND PAUL FILLED WITH REVELATION. HE
[1:50:22] WOULD NOT ALLOW IT.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I GAVE PLACE TO THEM NOT ONE
[1:50:28] NOT FOR ONE MINUTE."
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE HE HE STOOD THERE TO THE
[1:50:33] GALATIANS. And you READ IN GALATIANS,
[1:50:34] HE'S ALSO DEALING WITH THE SAME THING.
[1:50:36] HE IDENTIFIES IT AS A BEWITCHED spirit
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; saying, "OH FOOLISH GALATIANS, WHO HATH
[1:50:45] BEWITCHED YOU?"
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; He made no bones about it.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD NOT MIX THE OLD system
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; with the new.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE MADE IT CLEAR AND HE CONDEMNED
[1:51:02] THOSE PREACHERS AS FALSE BRETHREN.
[1:51:04] BROTHER PAUL DIDN'T PAY.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; He called them false brothers. He called
[1:51:10] it a bewitching spirit.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; You know that's an evil spirit.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he he flatly in the book
[1:51:19] of Romans, he flatly calls it adultery.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; SINCE IT'S ADULTERY TO STILL BE MARRIED
[1:51:26] TO that law
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; and claiming this grace.
[1:51:31] AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THE NEW
[1:51:33] COVENANT, WE MUST BE DEAD TO THE LAW IN
[1:51:34] ORDER TO BE MARRIED TO CHRIST. AND HE
[1:51:36] SAID, "LORD, KNOW YOU NOT, BRETHREN, THE
[1:51:38] LAW HAD DOMINION OF A MAN AS LONG AS HE
[1:51:40] LIVETH. WHEREFORE, my brethren, YOU
[1:51:42] BECOME DEAD TO THE LAW BY THE BODY OF
[1:51:44] CHRIST THAT YOU SHOULD BE MARRIED to
[1:51:45] another." And he made it personal, too.
[1:51:48] He said, "This ain't just for you. IT'S
[1:51:50] FOR ME. I COUNT IT ALL [screaming]
[1:51:52] AS DONE
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; AND ALL IS LOSS
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT win Christ." Amen.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; SO TO TRY TO EMBRACE MOSES LAW AND THE
[1:52:03] GRACE OF CHRIST IS SPIRITUAL ADULTERY.
[1:52:06] YOU CANNOT [screaming] BE MARRIED TO two
[1:52:09] husband.
[1:52:10] Neither can you serve two masters.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; AND THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES TODAY.
[1:52:16] JUST AS THERE WERE CERTAIN MEN IN PAUL'S
[1:52:18] DAY TRYING TO MIX LAW WITH GRACE, WE
[1:52:22] HAVE CERTAIN MEN TODAY TRYING TO MIX
[1:52:26] DENOMINATIONAL DOCTRINE WITH the
[1:52:28] revealed word of the hour.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; AND MANY ATTEMPT TO HOLD ON TO
[1:52:34] DENOMINATIONAL HEADSHIP, whether it's in
[1:52:37] creed or traditions OR THEOLOGICAL
[1:52:41] EMPHASIS, CLAIMING ALL THE WHILE TO BE
[1:52:44] THE BRIDE OF CHRIST.
[1:52:47] And yet SUBMIT TO DENOMINATION WHILE
[1:52:49] CLAIMING CHRIST IS A BRIDEGROOM. It it's
[1:52:53] it's it's spiritual adultery. And just
[1:52:56] as the early church had to be delivered
[1:52:57] FROM THE LAW, THE BRIDE IN THIS HOUR
[1:53:00] must be delivered
[1:53:04] now listen from the spirit of
[1:53:07] denominationalism. Amen.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; WE WERE DELIVERED A LONG TIME AGO
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; FROM denomination by name.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE delivered
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; from the spirit of denominationalism.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Now, LET ME JUST TAKE A FEW. FOR
[1:53:27] EXAMPLE, YOU YOU CANNOT FORCE
[1:53:30] PENTECOSTAL THEOLOGY UPON THE BRIDE
[1:53:33] BY INSISTING THAT SPEAKING IN TONGUES IS
[1:53:36] the evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT BELONGS TO THE CHURCH AGE
[1:53:42] THAT IS PASSED.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S AN OLD HUSBAND.
[1:53:48] NOR CAN YOU IMPORT EVANGELICAL EASE, I
[1:53:52] call it easy belieism, BY CLAIMING THAT
[1:53:55] THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF THE HOLY GHOST is
[1:53:57] believing the message without having a
[1:54:00] personal experience with Christ.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; The new birth is more than a mental
[1:54:06] ascent.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; It is a supernatural birth. IT IS AN
[1:54:10] ENCOUNTER WITH GOD. AMEN.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; AND THE BRIDE CANNOT BE A HYBRID AND
[1:54:14] NEITHER CAN HER CHILDREN. AND THE BRIDE
[1:54:17] MUST NOT BE A MIXTURE. SHE IS A WORD
[1:54:19] BRIDE UNITED WITH CHRIST THE WORD NOT A
[1:54:22] HYBRID BETWEEN denominations and the
[1:54:24] message.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE CANNOT BE BLENDED with
[1:54:29] Pentecostalism,
[1:54:31] EMOTIONALISM
[1:54:33] OR EVANGELICAL
[1:54:35] INTELLECTUALISM.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; IT MUST STAND ALONE. AND IT MUST BE
[1:54:39] PURE, UNPOLLUTED,
[1:54:42] spirit revealed.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; So let IT LET US DO LIKE PAUL SAID. I I
[1:54:46] COUNT IT ALL THAT LOSS.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT win Christ.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO BE F BEING FOUND FAITHFUL TO
[1:54:54] ONE HUSBAND.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW,
[1:54:59] now Jesus warned
[1:55:02] what happens when we have the wrong
[1:55:04] union.
[1:55:06] He said
[1:55:08] he would throw the church into the bed
[1:55:11] of fornication
[1:55:13] and kill her children with death.
[1:55:18] So her converts die spiritually.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; And if a believer claims to belong to
[1:55:28] Christ yet continues to flirt with the
[1:55:31] world,
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; listen to me now. If sin and worldliness
[1:55:35] OR THE OLD NATURE STILL RULE OVER THEM,
[1:55:38] they're committing spiritual
[1:55:39] fornication.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Christ simply will not share his bride
[1:55:46] with another lover.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; PAUL USES A NATURAL EXAMPLE TO EXPOSE
[1:55:52] the hypocrisy and and and I meant by
[1:55:55] that brother Brandham used that example.
[1:55:58] He said if if if young women were
[1:56:00] engaged and she saw her fi fiance fiance
[1:56:04] kissing other girls and then heard him
[1:56:06] say I love you honey she'd call him what
[1:56:09] he is a hypocrite.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; AND NOW WE CONSIDER THIS. WE'RE NOT ONLY
[1:56:13] IN CASE WE ARE MARRIED TO CHRIST.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; WE ARE HIS WIFE ORDAINED TO BRING FORTH
[1:56:20] CHILDREN OF HIS SPIRIT. SO I WANT YOU TO
[1:56:22] IMAGINE A HUSBAND coming home and
[1:56:25] finding his wife who claims devotion to
[1:56:27] him and him only has spent her her
[1:56:30] affection with another man.
[1:56:33] Now even THOUGH SHE MAY BE OUTWARDLY
[1:56:35] appear beautiful and her heart though is
[1:56:38] divided,
[1:56:40] her love IS NOT PURE, IT DOESN'T BELONG
[1:56:42] TO HIM ALONE AND NO MAN, NO REAL MAN
[1:56:46] WOULD TOLERATE THAT UNFAITHFULNESS. See
[1:56:48] you sisters likewise. Imagine your
[1:56:51] husband returning home not only
[1:56:54] unfaithful but carrying the diseases of
[1:56:56] immoral living.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; You'd recoil in heartbreak and disgust.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS GOD'S CONTROVERSY WITH THE
[1:57:04] MODERN CHURCH TODAY. THE MODERN CHURCH
[1:57:07] IS AFFLICTED WITH SPIRITUAL DISEASES.
[1:57:10] AMEN. FOLKS, DOCTRINES, WORLDLY
[1:57:13] ALLIANCES, DENOMINATIONAL CONTROL,
[1:57:16] LUKEWARMNESS, COMPROMISE.
[1:57:18] Are you hearing me? Amen.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT IS IT? I I'M GOING TO USE
[1:57:22] BROTHER BRANDON'S TERM. IT IS SPIRITUAL
[1:57:25] VENERIAL DISEASE
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; CORRUPTS THE BODY OF CHRIST WITH EVERY
[1:57:29] KIND OF ISM AND WORLDLY INFLUENCE. I say
[1:57:32] God be merciful. Jesus is coming
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; and he's coming for a pure bride.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; One that's found faithful to him.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; And in order to be married to Christ,
[1:57:46] one union has to die.
[1:57:49] That's the law of God that says so. He
[1:57:52] will not live in adultery.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; And creeds are man-made.
[1:57:59] And the word is God breathed
[1:58:02] and they're contrary to one to the
[1:58:03] other.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; And the church SAYS, "WE BELIEVE THIS,
[1:58:07] BUT WE DON'T ACCEPT THAT." NO BRIDE OF
[1:58:09] CHRIST TALKS LIKE THAT.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; THEY BELIEVE THE WHOLE WORD. TO BE
[1:58:12] MARRIED TO CHRIST, SHE'S MARRIED TO THE
[1:58:15] WORD.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD. THE
[1:58:18] WORD WAS WITH GOD. THE WORD WAS MADE
[1:58:20] FLESH. AND CHRIST WAS THE WORD. HE IS
[1:58:22] THE WORD. AND HE'LL FOREVER BE THE WORD.
[1:58:25] AND THE BRIDE IS MARRIED TO HIM. AND TO
[1:58:27] BE MARRIED TO HIM, SHE'S GOT TO BE A
[1:58:28] WORD BRIDE.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; SO SHE CANNOT BE BOUND TO A WORLDLY
[1:58:33] ORGANIZATION AND BE bound to Christ.
[1:58:36] Simultaneously. THE TWO HUSBANDS STAND
[1:58:38] OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER. ONE AS GOD SAID,
[1:58:40] the other's man-made. And God said, "Let
[1:58:43] every man's word be a lie. Let mine be
[1:58:45] true.
[1:58:47] So now
[1:58:49] notice here that she
[1:58:53] BY GOD has been given a verdict
[1:58:57] and the verdict says she is an
[1:59:00] adulteress.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Now you know sometimes sometimes some of
[1:59:06] you recoil because I use the word
[1:59:08] and harlot. God used the word and
[1:59:10] harlot.
[1:59:18] Amen.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; She is an adulteress.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT ADULTERESS WILL GOD TAKE AS HIS
[1:59:26] BRIDE?
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; HE WILL NOT.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; He forbids it. AND THE CHILDREN BORN
[1:59:32] FROM SOME SUCH UNION OR WHAT? THEY'RE
[1:59:35] ILLEGITIMATE.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Not illegitimate to the church system.
[1:59:39] No, they're they're his. but they're
[1:59:42] illegitimate to the word. And that is a
[1:59:44] picture of Leodysa in Revelation 3, a
[1:59:48] denominational hybrid, lukewarm,
[1:59:50] self-satisfied, claiming Christianity,
[1:59:52] denying the power, a form of godliness,
[1:59:55] but rejecting the life that makes the
[1:59:57] bride spotless.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Now, so let's reflect on this a minute.
[2:00:06] Marriage is the oldest institution ever
[2:00:08] given to mankind.
[2:00:11] And before a church, before government,
[2:00:14] before schools or nations, there was
[2:00:16] marriage in Eden.
[2:00:19] AND GOD HAD ENTRUSTED THE woman with a
[2:00:23] serious sacred virtue,
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; a purity that she must guard. Now, this
[2:00:28] is going to get a little tight.
[2:00:31] It'll get, you know, it'll get a little
[2:00:33] bumpy. So, put your seat belts on.
[2:00:36] I pro promise to land you. Okay.
[2:00:42] Now as we look at this,
[2:00:46] God entrusted a woman with a sacred
[2:00:50] virtue of purity. She must guard it.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; AND IF SHE DEFILES THAT VIRTUE THROUGH
[2:00:59] FORNICATION, YEAH, she may be forgiven,
[2:01:03] but she cannot be justified in this
[2:01:06] life. The scar remains as long as she
[2:01:10] lives.
[2:01:16] Now, I want to be clear. When we say
[2:01:20] that a woman who loses her virtue
[2:01:22] through fornication may be forgiven but
[2:01:25] not justified in this life, we don't
[2:01:28] mean by that that she's unredeemable
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; or that she's unfit for marriage.
[2:01:37] We are simply acknowledging two biblical
[2:01:40] truths. One, God forgives sin when it's
[2:01:45] confessed. If we confess our sins, he is
[2:01:48] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[2:01:50] and to cleanse us from all
[2:01:52] unrighteousness.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:55] And as John first John or Mark 3 says,
[2:01:59] there is no sin except blasphemy against
[2:02:03] the Holy Ghost that God refuses to
[2:02:05] pardon. So fornication is not the
[2:02:09] unpardonable sin.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; And but however, here's the other truth.
[2:02:16] Forgiveness does not erase earthly
[2:02:19] consequences.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; And this is what is meant. SHE CANNOT BE
[2:02:23] JUSTIFIED IN THIS LIFE. It means that
[2:02:26] natural consequences remain even after
[2:02:29] God has forgiven her.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Now let's just talk about that for a
[2:02:34] minute because a lot of people get
[2:02:36] confused. They think, "Oh, glory to God.
[2:02:38] I'm forgiven. All the consequences of
[2:02:41] sin is gone." Wrong.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:02:47] There's a law of sewing and reaping.
[2:02:51] Yes.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Whatever you sow,
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; you're going TO REAP.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE.
[2:02:57] DAVID was forgiven for his sin.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; And when he was confronted by the
[2:03:02] prophet, he confessed and the Lord
[2:03:04] responded, "The Lord has put away thy
[2:03:06] sin. Thou shalt not die."
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; However, WHILE FORGIVENESS REMOVED THE
[2:03:11] GUILT AND SPARED HIS LIFE, IT DID NOT
[2:03:14] REMOVE the consequences. Amen.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; The seeds he had SOWN THROUGH ADULTERY
[2:03:19] WITH BASHEBA and the murder OF URIAH
[2:03:23] BEGAN to produce a bitter harvest
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; WITHIN HIS LIFE AND HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; He would even, you know, it would it
[2:03:34] would even be death OF THE FIRST CHILD
[2:03:37] AND THEN FROM THERE a harvest over and
[2:03:40] over and over. I mean, THEY CONTINUE
[2:03:42] PAYING OVER AND OVER AND over
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; from these seeds that was sowed.
[2:03:47] Nathan warned him. This is what he
[2:03:49] warned. EVEN THOUGH HE SAID, "THE LORD
[2:03:50] HAS FORGIVEN YOU. YOU WON'T DIE." HE
[2:03:54] SAID, "BUT the sword will never depart
[2:03:56] from your house. You did it secretly,
[2:03:59] but this thing I will do, I I will do
[2:04:02] this thing before all Israel and before
[2:04:04] the son." And the Bible tells you that
[2:04:08] it came to pass. Look what happened. His
[2:04:10] son Amnen
[2:04:12] raped his halfsister Tamar.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Abselum Tamar's brother led a rebellion
[2:04:20] against David and a bold and shameful
[2:04:22] act. He took his concubines and his
[2:04:24] wives and violated them publicly on the
[2:04:27] rooftop
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; which fulfilled Nathan's prophecy.
[2:04:32] And though David had repented and was
[2:04:34] restored spiritually, the natural
[2:04:36] consequences of his sins continued to
[2:04:39] unfold, affecting his children, even his
[2:04:42] kingdom.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; HE HAD SOWN TO THE WIND, BUT NOW HE WAS
[2:04:47] REAPING THE WHIRLWIND.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; And here's the lesson from this. DAVID'S
[2:04:52] STORY REMINDS US THAT SIN ALWAYS BRINGS
[2:04:55] A HARVEST. YEAH.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU SOW,
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; you you know you sin pays wages.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SIN, YOU'RE GOING TO GET
[2:05:06] REWARDS FROM IT.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT GOOD REWARDS.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; AND EVEN WHEN GOD FORGIVES,
[2:05:13] WHAT WE SOW CAN STILL AFFECT OTHERS,
[2:05:16] ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE CLOSEST TO US.
[2:05:20] And hidden sins MAY BE OUT OF VIEW FOR A
[2:05:23] TIME, BUT it's still a seed in the
[2:05:25] ground.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; You may can hide it good, but it's seed
[2:05:29] in the ground.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; And without true repentance and mercy of
[2:05:33] God, it's going to grow into sorrow.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Forgiveness restores our STANDING WITH
[2:05:38] BEFORE GOD, but it does NOT REMOVE THE
[2:05:40] SCARS or the ripple effects left BEHIND
[2:05:44] IT. THAT'S WHY SCRIPTURE CALLS US NOT
[2:05:46] ONLY TO REPENT but to flee from sin
[2:05:49] altogether
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; knowing ITS COST IS FAR GREATER THAN THE
[2:05:54] PLEASURE.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; AND THE POINT IS WHAT WE SOW WE SHALL
[2:05:59] REAP.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; FOR EXAMPLE, a man can BE FORGIVEN OF
[2:06:03] HIS DEATH BUT HE STILL MAY ALL
[2:06:06] RESTITUTION.
[2:06:08] A MAN PARDONED BY GOD
[2:06:11] FINDS HIS PLACE AT AN ALTAR, GETS A
[2:06:14] GENUINE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST may have
[2:06:17] to go to jail
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; for his crimes.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a woman,
[2:06:27] are you with me?
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; So a woman who has lost her virginity
[2:06:32] cannot return to the physical state
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; of virginity. That's right.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Though her heart can be made clean and
[2:06:41] pure before God
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; has nothing to do with her standing as a
[2:06:46] Christian.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; And this is what is meant by the scar
[2:06:50] remains. It's not a moral stain before
[2:06:52] God because God removes that. But it's a
[2:06:54] natural reality. It just it's something
[2:06:56] you did that can't be undone.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; And I want to get this clear. She's not
[2:07:02] second class.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; She's not unworthy. She's not unfit FOR
[2:07:07] MARRIAGE. GOD FORGIVES. GOD RESTORES.
[2:07:09] God's make new. SHE'S PRECIOUS. SHE'S
[2:07:12] VALUABLE. SHE'S BELOVED BY GOD as any
[2:07:16] other daughter of the Lord.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; And no scripture teaches she's unworthy
[2:07:21] to be a wife or a mother. No sir.
[2:07:24] But I want you to get confession brings
[2:07:28] cleansing and freedom. And that's all
[2:07:31] that's meant here. She acknowledges the
[2:07:33] sin. God forgives the sin. She's
[2:07:35] restored in fellowship with God, but it
[2:07:38] must be confessed to her husband for for
[2:07:42] marriage. And and and I want to say
[2:07:44] something.
[2:07:46] Don't think you boys are getting off
[2:07:47] light
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; because I got word for you too.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Same is true for the man. He too must
[2:07:55] confess.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Marriage should be entered into with
[2:08:00] full disclosure.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:06] But forgiveness does not literally
[2:08:08] restore the physical condition. It's
[2:08:09] only and that's the only sense in which
[2:08:12] justification is not possible in the
[2:08:14] body in this life. So as we look at this
[2:08:19] again, it's important to note and here's
[2:08:23] where I'm talking to you young men that
[2:08:26] purity IS NOT PLACED ONLY ON YOUNG
[2:08:31] WOMEN.
[2:08:33] GOD REQUIRES HOLINESS FROM BOTH SEXES.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Now Paul Paul said in in 1 Corinthians
[2:08:43] chapter 4:E3 and he said this IS THE
[2:08:46] WILL OF GOD. And then HE CONTINUES THAT
[2:08:48] EVERY ONE OF YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO
[2:08:50] POSSESS HIS VESSEL in sanctification and
[2:08:54] honor.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Every one of you. THAT MEANS YOUNG MEN
[2:08:59] TOO. HE MUST HONOR HIS BODY, DISCIPLINE
[2:09:03] HIS PASSIONS. HE MUST WALK CLEAN BEFORE
[2:09:06] GOD.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Come on, church.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; And God doesn't have two standards. One
[2:09:12] for his daughters and one for his sons,
[2:09:14] a lighter one for his sons. You know, he
[2:09:16] doesn't do that. HE SAYS CLEARLY, "FLEE
[2:09:19] FORNICATION."
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; AND THIS COMMAND IS IS TO ALL BELIEVERS.
[2:09:25] A YOUNG MAN WHO MISUSES HIS BODY, HIS
[2:09:28] EYES, HIS IMAGINATION IS JUST AS
[2:09:31] ACCOUNTABLE as any young woman who
[2:09:33] misuses hers.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Now, let's understand why is this so
[2:09:40] important? Because purity protects the
[2:09:44] future.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; A young man who keeps himself pure, he
[2:09:49] honors the woman that he will marry one
[2:09:52] day.
[2:09:54] a young man that keeps himself pure,
[2:09:57] protects his future home.
[2:10:00] He guards his spiritual authority. This
[2:10:03] is real important. He enters marriage
[2:10:06] with a clean conscience.
[2:10:09] And and so he it's very very important.
[2:10:13] And this stands out to me that he must
[2:10:16] protect HIS SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY
[2:10:20] BECAUSE GOD DESIGNED THE MAN TO BE HEAD
[2:10:23] OF the home.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; BUT THE HEADSHIP IS NOT GRANTED
[2:10:28] AUTOMATICALLY.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; BUT HEADSHIP IS EARNED THROUGH
[2:10:33] INTEGRITY, PURITY, AND OBEDIENCE TO GOD.
[2:10:37] AMEN.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; And a YOUNG MAN WHO COMPROMISES SEXUALLY
[2:10:42] WITH THE WOMAN HE HOPES TO MARRY DAMAGES
[2:10:45] THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THAT AUTHORITY.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; AND HERE'S WHY. HE cannot lead her into
[2:10:53] sin and then lead her into spirituality.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; AND A MAN CANNOT GUIDE A WOMAN INTO
[2:11:00] DISOBEDIENCE AND THEN EXPECT HER TO
[2:11:02] FOLLOW HIM IN RIGHTEOUSNESS. AMEN.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; SO IF HE PRESSES HER, IF HE PERSUADES
[2:11:08] HER, OR IF HE JUST SILENTLY ALLOWS HER
[2:11:12] TO CROSS MORAL BOUNDARIES, HE IS FAILING
[2:11:15] IN LEADERSHIP LONG BEFORE THE MARRIAGE
[2:11:18] EVER BEGINS.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN HE SAY LATER SAY, "FOLLOW ME AS
[2:11:24] I FOLLOW CHRIST."
[2:11:27] when he when she remembers a time he led
[2:11:29] her away from Christ.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; A WOMAN MAY FORGIVE AND GOD MAY FORGIVE.
[2:11:36] But here's the secret. Here's the
[2:11:38] glitch.
[2:11:39] Memories of failure weaken trust.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Memories of failure weakens trust
[2:11:53] because why?
[2:11:55] He respects he wounds her respect for
[2:11:59] his leadership.
[2:12:02] A woman's deepest respect from her
[2:12:04] husband comes when she sees his
[2:12:06] restraint,
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; his strength, his self-control,
[2:12:11] and his willingness, his willingness to
[2:12:14] protect her purity.
[2:12:17] And if he fails in that, then she
[2:12:19] realizes HE DID NOT PROTECT ME when it
[2:12:23] mattered most.
[2:12:25] And this MAY NOT EVEN BE SPOKEN ALOUD.
[2:12:27] SHE MAY NEVER SAY THAT TO HIM, BUT IT
[2:12:30] SETTLES into the emotional memory of the
[2:12:32] marriage. AND SHE MAY ACTUALLY LOVE HIM
[2:12:35] DEEPLY, BUT THE AUTOMATIC TRUST THAT
[2:12:38] HEADSHIP REQUIRES WILL BE HARDER FOR HER
[2:12:40] TO GIVE.
[2:12:43] AND HE WILL CARRY THIS GUILT into
[2:12:47] marriage.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; EVEN IF FORGIVEN, THE MEMORY REMAINS.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; And a MAN WHO KNOWS HE FAILED MORALLY,
[2:12:58] this is what he often experiences. He
[2:13:01] will experience insecurity about leading
[2:13:03] spiritually. He will he will have
[2:13:06] hesitation in correcting spiritual
[2:13:08] issues. He will have guilt but
[2:13:11] discussing purity with his children.
[2:13:14] You see that becomes A SHADOW OVER HIS
[2:13:17] CONFIDENCE. He senses WHETHER IT'S REAL
[2:13:19] OR IMAGINE THAT HE THAT HE FORFEITED
[2:13:22] PART OF HIS MORAL authority and the
[2:13:25] enemy then will come. Oh, don't you
[2:13:27] think you don't have an enemy?
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; HE WILL USE THAT FAILURE AGAINST YOU.
[2:13:34] HE LOVES TO ATTACK LEADERSHIP.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; AND ANY MORAL FAILURE BECOMES SOMETHING
[2:13:41] THE ENEMY CAN WHISPER, "Who are you to
[2:13:43] lead this home?"
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; SO GUESS WHAT? WITH THIS CONDEMNATION,
[2:13:49] THE MAN WILL FORFEIT SPIRITUAL
[2:13:51] LEADERSHIP. AND YOU'LL FIND THAT MANY
[2:13:55] times he will feel unworthy and will
[2:13:58] fail TO LEAD HIS FAMILY in devotion and
[2:14:01] prayers.
[2:14:03] And the enemy whispers over again, you
[2:14:07] feel, you failed her once, you'll fail
[2:14:09] against
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; and you're no spiritual example. And a
[2:14:13] compromised past becomes a spiritual
[2:14:17] foothold to the enemy
[2:14:19] that he exploits in moments of conflict
[2:14:23] or temptation.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; And this hurts his own ability to model
[2:14:27] Christ because THEY ARE BY THE WORD TO
[2:14:32] REFLECT CHRIST'S LOVE.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; AND CHRIST LOVE IS A LOVE THAT PROTECTS
[2:14:40] NOT EXPLOITS. CHRIST GAVE HIMSELF FOR
[2:14:44] THE CHURCH. HE NEVER TOOK FROM HER. HE
[2:14:46] NEVER PRESSURED HER, NEVER USES HER.
[2:14:48] WHEN A MAN KEEPS HIMSELF PURE, HE MODELS
[2:14:51] CHRIST. WHEN HE FAILS, HE MODELS ADAM. I
[2:14:55] MEAN FALLEN Adam
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; who went with his wife into sin and
[2:15:00] failed to shield her from it. And when
[2:15:03] you remain faithful to the word though,
[2:15:06] it builds confidence and not shame. And
[2:15:09] a man who keeps his purity enters
[2:15:11] marriage with a clean conscience, a
[2:15:13] spiritual boldness, a moral confidence,
[2:15:16] a sense that of being a protector, not a
[2:15:19] transgressor. And and and AUTHORITY THEN
[2:15:21] WILL FLOW FROM THAT OBEDIENCE.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; And and therefore, he can pray boldly.
[2:15:28] He can speak boldly. HE CAN LEAD BOLDLY.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT PURITY SETS HIM UP for
[2:15:36] lifong respect.
[2:15:39] A woman who marries a man who PROTECTED
[2:15:41] HER PURITY WILL ALWAYS CARRY A DEEP
[2:15:44] enduring respect. He honored God. He He
[2:15:48] honored me. He proved he could lead
[2:15:50] before he ever became my husband. And
[2:15:53] that respect becomes the soil in which
[2:15:56] headship thrives.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Of course, there's forgiveness.
[2:16:08] But you reap what you sow.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; It's a law of God.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; If you sow that which is wrong, you'll
[2:16:16] eat its fruits.
[2:16:18] I'm going to give you a scripture in
[2:16:19] Proverbs 1:29 that's very, very
[2:16:23] something you need to take close to your
[2:16:24] heart. For they that hated knowledge and
[2:16:28] did not choose to reverence the Lord, to
[2:16:31] give honor to his word, the fear of the
[2:16:34] Lord, they would have none of my
[2:16:36] counsel. They wouldn't listen. They
[2:16:37] despise all my reproof. Therefore, they
[2:16:40] shall eat the fruit of their own way. I
[2:16:44] want you to understand, IT AIN'T EVEN
[2:16:45] GOD PUNISHING YOU. YOUR SINS ARE
[2:16:48] FORGIVEN. IS THAT WHEN YOU HATE
[2:16:50] KNOWLEDGE, AND YOU DON'T RESPECT THE
[2:16:52] LORD, YOU REFUSE HIS COUNSEL, YOU
[2:16:55] DESPISE HIS REPROOF AND CORRECTION, THEN
[2:16:57] YOU WILL EAT THE BITTER fruits
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; of your own way.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:05] Now Jesus said, "Blessed are they that
[2:17:06] are pure in heart."
[2:17:09] And purity prepares a man to be a godly
[2:17:12] husband, a father. Purity builds
[2:17:15] character. It a man who controls his
[2:17:18] desire while young, he becomes strong in
[2:17:21] discipline, stable in judgment, faithful
[2:17:23] in marriage, trusted in leadership. The
[2:17:26] same Holy Spirit that keeps a young
[2:17:28] woman chased will keep a young man
[2:17:30] honorable in chase.
[2:17:33] Purity is an expression of love. A a
[2:17:37] young MAN'S PURITY IS A GIFT THAT HE
[2:17:39] GIVES FIRST TO GOD, THEN TO HIS FUTURE
[2:17:42] WIFE AND TO HIMSELF.
[2:17:45] YOU SEE, IT'S A SIGN OF MATURITY and
[2:17:47] reverence. PURITY FOR BEFORE MARRIAGE
[2:17:50] EQUALS FAITHFULNESS AFTER MARRIAGE. A
[2:17:53] MAN WHO RESTRAINS HIS SELF BEFORE
[2:17:55] MARRIAGE IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO STAY
[2:17:58] FAITHFUL AFTER MARRIAGE. THE HABITS HE
[2:18:01] FORMS NOW BECOMES THE CHARACTERS he
[2:18:03] lives with later. SO YOU KNOW BUT
[2:18:07] HOWEVER BOTH OF YOU STAND EQUAL under
[2:18:09] the Christ under the cross if if a young
[2:18:11] man has fallen the same grace that
[2:18:14] forgives a young woman forgives him
[2:18:16] also. HE MUST REPENT. HE MUST CONFESS.
[2:18:19] HE MUST WALK CLEAN FROM THAT MOMENT ON.
[2:18:22] BUT THE SERIOUSNESS REMAINS.
[2:18:25] GOD EXPECTS MEN TO HONOR THEIR BODIES
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; JUST AS HE EXPECTS A WOMAN TO to honor
[2:18:33] theirs.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; So it's something commanded for both
[2:18:41] young men and women is fornication is
[2:18:45] sin for both sexes. Purity builds
[2:18:48] strength and character and future
[2:18:50] faithfulness in both of them. A godly
[2:18:53] man or woman honors God's honors God by
[2:18:56] how they treat their own body. But grace
[2:18:58] is available for anyone who's following.
[2:19:01] BUT LET'S GO BACK TO this
[2:19:05] just for a moment.
[2:19:07] WHAT ABOUT THIS WOMAN?
[2:19:09] WHY IS THIS SO SACRED?
[2:19:14] NOW, now listen, church.
[2:19:17] I know you're really listening, but I
[2:19:19] hope you're not walking out of here like
[2:19:21] a scalded dog.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to whip you. I'm trying
[2:19:27] to instruct you
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; in righteousness
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; so now let's go back TO THE WOMAN. WHY
[2:19:37] IS THIS SO SACRED?
[2:19:41] Because her body
[2:19:43] is the bedding ground
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; for life.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; No woman or excuse me, no animal, NO
[2:19:55] DOG, BEAST, OR BIRD SHARES THIS TRUST.
[2:19:59] Only the woman.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; ONLY THE WOMAN BEARS THE ABILITY TO
[2:20:03] BRING FORTH HUMAN LIFE TO THE EARTH. AND
[2:20:05] GOD GAVE HER THIS STEWARDSHIP. AND PAUL
[2:20:08] USES THIS TO TYPE THE CHURCH. AND THERE
[2:20:11] ARE THREE SACRED TRUSTS OF A woman that
[2:20:15] a mirror to the church that you and I
[2:20:18] want you to keep the church in mind when
[2:20:20] we do it. There is NUMBER ONE A SACRED
[2:20:23] VIRTUE, purity of life. Keep the church
[2:20:27] in mind. Sacred womanhood, her conduct
[2:20:30] and character before men.
[2:20:34] sacred motherhood to honor her husband
[2:20:37] and children. I'm not getting this out
[2:20:39] the air. I'm I'm preaching to you from
[2:20:41] invisible union.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE GIVEN BY GOD. She must not
[2:20:48] betray them.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; If a woman has fallen into sin before
[2:20:53] marriage, she's got to confess that to
[2:20:56] her husband for before the union. Just
[2:20:59] as the church who lived under the law
[2:21:01] MUST CONFESS HER PAST before she can
[2:21:04] enter her into her union with Christ
[2:21:06] Lord. That old husband has to BE DEAD.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU WONDER WHY AIN'T CHRIST MARRIED
[2:21:14] TO ME? HOW COME I SOUGHT FOR THE HOLY
[2:21:16] GHOST?
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; IS THAT HUSBAND DEAD?
[2:21:25] IS A WORLDLY ATTRACTION TO HIM OVER.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Come on now. You can't just divorce him.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; He's got to be dead.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:21:41] as we look at this,
[2:21:44] I want you to get THE CONCEPT. IF THE
[2:21:46] WOMAN HIDES it
[2:21:49] even for 10 years or Brother Brandon
[2:21:52] said or however long and the husband
[2:21:56] retains the God-given right to put her
[2:21:59] away
[2:22:00] for fornication is unclean living.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; And here's a Bible example. Let me show
[2:22:08] you one. Joseph in the Bible, a just
[2:22:11] man, sought to put away Mary privately
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; until God revealed that the child was of
[2:22:17] the Holy Ghost.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; He had a right to put her away.
[2:22:23] Now, so there is sacred womanhood. Her
[2:22:26] conduct for men, you know, he will I I
[2:22:29] want you to understand, you want GOD TO
[2:22:32] REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU, HE WILL NOT
[2:22:34] UNVEIL OR REVEAL HIMSELF TO EVERYONE or
[2:22:37] anyone. JUST HIS BRIDE, NOT THESE
[2:22:41] FLIRTS.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; Now remember, YOU KNOW WHAT THE MESSAGE
[2:22:48] IS? IS GOD WHISPERING HIS LOVE secrets
[2:22:51] to you?
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; And and HE JUST LET HIS church know
[2:22:56] that, you know, to to them. Let them go
[2:22:59] marry who they want to. As many times
[2:23:01] they want to do what they want to live
[2:23:03] the way they WANT TO DRESS THE WAY THEY
[2:23:05] LET THEM DO WHATEVER THAT'S THEM.
[2:23:09] BUT NOT YOU.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; You're married to Christ.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S WHISPERED TO YOU THE LOVE
[2:23:16] SECRETS,
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; WHICH SHOWS YOU YOU'RE HIS BRIDE.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT REVEALING THIS TO THE
[2:23:23] FLATTERERS, ONLY HIS WIFE.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; You're the only one privileged.
[2:23:30] The rest of them, the book is closed to
[2:23:32] them.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; The seals are not open.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:38] And yet they all claim to be the bride.
[2:23:40] But one day their folly will be made
[2:23:42] manifest when Jesus takes his bride and
[2:23:44] sets her up here and said, "This is
[2:23:45] her." And away he goes with her.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; So character matters. Appearance
[2:23:51] matters. Oh my. Oh,
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; I made a promise to myself and I ain't
[2:24:05] going to keep it.
[2:24:11] I'm I'm going to clinch this.
[2:24:14] But Harold helps every devil in hell.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Her character reveals her. A WOMAN IS
[2:24:21] NOT DEFILED NOT or she's defiled not
[2:24:25] ONLY BY THE ACT, BUT SHE'S DEFILED BY
[2:24:27] allowing herself TO BE USED AS AN OBJECT
[2:24:30] of lust. All right.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Now, you can take the HEADSHIP OF
[2:24:36] DENOMINATION, WEAR YOUR SHORTS, YOUR
[2:24:39] TIGHT PANTS, AND YOUR TIGHT AND
[2:24:40] REVEALING CLOTHES AND YOUR MAKEUP AND
[2:24:42] LOOK LIKE A HARLOT AND DRESS LIKE a
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; But you can't in this bride
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SEE, SHE IS NOT YOU'RE NOT
[2:24:51] JUST DEFILED BY THE ACT, BUT BUT BY
[2:24:55] ALLOWING YOURSELF TO BE USED AS AN
[2:24:57] OBJECT of lust. That's
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:25:01] AND THAT'S WHY A HOLY WOMAN WILL NOT PUT
[2:25:03] HERSELF OUT THERE AS AN OBJECT OF LUST.
[2:25:07] NOW, WHY IS WHY IS THIS AN ISSUE TODAY?
[2:25:11] THIS WASN'T an issue hundreds of YEARS
[2:25:13] AGO IS BECAUSE HOLLYWOOD has glamorized
[2:25:17] the lips and passion, sex glands in the
[2:25:20] lip, a kiss of of lustes, ADULTERY, AND
[2:25:23] SEED FORM. AND THAT'S WHY OUR MORALS ARE
[2:25:26] ROTTEN TODAY BECAUSE LITTLE CHILDREN
[2:25:28] HAVE been climatized
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; AND RAISED BEFORE MOVIE SCREENS that are
[2:25:34] filled with fornication and uncleanness.
[2:25:37] AND IT HAS FULFILLED A PROPHECY IN THE
[2:25:39] LAST DAYS.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Now keep the church in view. The church
[2:25:44] HAS BEEN DOING THE SAME THING, KISSING
[2:25:47] AND SLOPPING WITH EVERY SYSTEM BUT THE
[2:25:50] WORD. SHE EMBRACES SCIENCE FALSELY
[2:25:52] SO-CALLED WORLDLY EDUCATION, exalted
[2:25:55] reasoning over revelation, CIVILIZATION
[2:25:58] BUILT ON DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE. I'M I'M
[2:26:00] I am sharing with you from the message
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; and THIS ENTIRE PRESENT ORDER IS
[2:26:06] ANTICHRIST.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; NO, not reading writing and arithmetic.
[2:26:13] No, not that. But but let me tell you
[2:26:15] the spirit that is behind modern
[2:26:18] civilization
[2:26:20] And God will bring a civilization one
[2:26:24] day where there there will be no death.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS PRESENT ONE HAS BEEN BIRTHED BY
[2:26:29] SATAN. This is Satan's Ed.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; And women have LOST THEIR SHAME BECAUSE
[2:26:35] THE CHURCH HAS LOST HER. AND MANY OF
[2:26:38] THEM REFLECT
[2:26:40] THE THE WOMAN LEODYY OF THE CHURCH
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE WRETCHED, MISERABLE, POOR,
[2:26:46] BLIND, AND NAKED.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Yet they're saying they're rich
[2:26:50] increase with goods.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; And we love Jesus.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; AND WOMEN DRESSED TO ENTICE, TWISTING IN
[2:27:00] THE STREET, CLOTHED IN GARMENTS THAT GOD
[2:27:02] FORBADE.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; AND THEY CLAIM VIRTUE TO THEIR HUSBAND.
[2:27:06] AND BUT JESUS SAID, "WHOSOEVER LOOKTH
[2:27:09] UPON A woman to lust after her, they
[2:27:11] committed adultery with her always
[2:27:13] already. Because if she presentth
[2:27:15] herself
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; to be lusted after, she shares in that
[2:27:21] sin.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; TODAY, THE MODERN WOMAN IS STRIPPED DOWN
[2:27:30] TO HER UNDERWEAR.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; YESTERDAY'S UNDERWEAR, THE
[2:27:33] UNDERGARMENTS,
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; STRIPPED DOWN TO THAT, PARADES OUT ON
[2:27:36] THE STREET, GOES to church in them,
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; sings in the choir,
[2:27:44] What is it? IF SHE PRESENTS HERSELF TO
[2:27:46] BE LUSTED AFTER, she shares in that sin.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; So the church presents to the WORLD AND
[2:27:52] SHE'S DRESSED IN CREEDS AND PROGRAMS AND
[2:27:54] POLITICS AND INSTITUTIONS INSTEAD OF THE
[2:27:56] WORD.
[2:27:58] AND WHAT HAS SHE DONE? SHE'S went out,
[2:28:00] you know, building hospitals, erecting
[2:28:02] colleges, join councils of men, and all
[2:28:05] them have their place. But Jesus never
[2:28:07] commanded that. HE SAID, "PREACH THE
[2:28:09] WORD."
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:13] And she has left the word and eml EM
[2:28:16] EMBRACED A CONGLOMERATION OF
[2:28:18] SUBSTITUTES. BUT THE BRIDE IS CALLED TO
[2:28:21] PRESERVE THE WORD TO PRESERVE the spirit
[2:28:24] to remain A VIRGIN. BUT HOLLYWOOD HAS
[2:28:27] STRIPPED THE B THE THE VIRTUE OF THE
[2:28:30] WOMAN TODAY. AND THAT where now WHAT
[2:28:33] ONCE WOULD HAVE CAUSED THEM TO BE
[2:28:35] arrested
[2:28:37] for insanity. Right?
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; AND IF IT WAS INSANE THEN, IT'S INSANE
[2:28:43] NOW.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; And the EVIDENCE OF ALL OF THIS IS MORAL
[2:28:49] INSANITY, MURDER, VIOLENCE.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S REVELATION, PREDICTION,
[2:28:59] RISING FROM THE DEPTHS UNTIL MEN WILL
[2:29:02] CRY FOR THE ROCKS TO FALL ON THEM.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; It's total insanity. and it's marching
[2:29:07] down the street right into the CHURCH
[2:29:09] PEWS. AND HOW did it happen? It happened
[2:29:13] through the same serpent that entered
[2:29:15] Eden. The church became the mouthpiece
[2:29:18] of deception. It's okay.
[2:29:23] Now, I I want you to understand
[2:29:29] the woman don't put on them kind of
[2:29:30] clothes today and say, you know, I'm
[2:29:32] going to go naked today.
[2:29:36] Eve wasn't rebellious. She was deceived.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; And we got a society that's been
[2:29:42] deceived by television,
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; magazines, fashion, culture, social
[2:29:47] media.
[2:29:51] Amen.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; And some of you ladies see this filth on
[2:29:57] social media that some of these girls
[2:29:59] are wearing and Google over it
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; and talk about how beautiful they look
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; when they've dressed like and
[2:30:09] harlots.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Shame on you.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; You embarrass me.
[2:30:20] But you know, they think they're right.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; You know, THEIR LOVER DON'T CARE.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; THEIR JESUS doesn't care.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; You see, they think they're right. Yet,
[2:30:34] they're dead and they DON'T KNOW IT.
[2:30:36] BECAUSE IF YOU LIVE IN SIN, the woman
[2:30:39] who lives in pleasure, YOU KNOW, IS DEAD
[2:30:42] WHILE SHE LIVES. AND THE CHURCH LIKEWISE
[2:30:44] IS DECEIVED AND SEDUCED AND BLINDED AND
[2:30:47] VEILED NOT BY GOD BUT BY SATAN HIMSELF.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; And you can see you don't
[2:30:56] and and
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; let me read you a scripture.
[2:31:03] Let me read you a scripture
[2:31:06] because Jesus spoke about this condition
[2:31:08] himself. Luke chapter 23 27.
[2:31:13] There followed him a great company of
[2:31:15] people and of women that bewailed and
[2:31:18] lamented him.
[2:31:20] But Jesus turned to them and said,
[2:31:22] "Daughters of Jerusalem,
[2:31:24] weep not for me, but weep for yourselves
[2:31:27] and for your children. For behold, the
[2:31:30] days are coming." Watch now. THEY SHALL
[2:31:34] SAY, "BLESSED ARE THE BARREN AND THE
[2:31:36] wombs that never bear." Then they SHALL
[2:31:38] SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS FOLLOWING US TO THE
[2:31:40] hills cover us. For if they do these
[2:31:43] things in a green tree,
[2:31:46] what shall THEY DO IN THE DRY?
[2:31:49] So Jesus warned, listen me now.
[2:31:54] He warned of a time that bearing
[2:31:57] children would even be despised.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; AND WE HAVE ARRIVED AND IT'S BROUGHT
[2:32:03] INSANITY TOO. We live in a very strange
[2:32:06] hour.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to hurry. But we live
[2:32:10] IN A VERY STRANGE HOUR WHERE MANY PEOPLE
[2:32:12] DO over their pets
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; with a the KIND OF AFFECTION AND
[2:32:18] CELEBRATION AND ATTENTION THAT PREVIOUS
[2:32:20] GENERATIONS gave their children and
[2:32:22] THEIR GRANDCHILDREN.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; NOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG with loving
[2:32:25] an animal and owning a pet. I've owned
[2:32:27] many of them and God gave them and and
[2:32:30] they they can be wonderful for
[2:32:32] companionship and care. But but
[2:32:35] something deeper's happening
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; when we have A CULTURE THAT REPLACES
[2:32:40] CHILDREN with pets
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; AND EVEN DESPISES THE IDEA OF BEARING
[2:32:46] AND RAISING CHILDREN.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY IT AIN'T HAPPENING. HOW MANY
[2:32:49] ABORTIONS ARE ACROSS THE NATION?
[2:32:52] THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT [screaming] THE BIRTH CONTROL
[2:32:56] THAT'S GOING ON?
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about something to
[2:32:59] space children and in the marriage and
[2:33:01] what I'm talking about to forbid having
[2:33:03] children.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Today we see couples choosing pets over
[2:33:09] children.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; WE SEE GRANDPARENTS GIVING THEIR
[2:33:13] CHILDREN.
[2:33:14] I you know actually they're grieving.
[2:33:19] grandparents, many of them grieving
[2:33:20] BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN REFUSED TO HAVE
[2:33:22] FAMILIES.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; I read a NEWS REPORT WHERE MANY OF
[2:33:27] PEOPLE WAS NOT GOING TO HOME FOR
[2:33:29] THANKSGIVING
[2:33:31] BECAUSE THEIR FAMILY WAS NOW THEIR PETS.
[2:33:37] IT'S A GENERATION THAT GUSHES OVER FUR
[2:33:40] BABIES,
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN SEES REAL BABIES AS
[2:33:44] INCONVENIENCE, A BURDEN, OR EVEN A
[2:33:47] THREAT TO personal freedom.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; And at THE SAME TIME, MILLIONS OF UNBORN
[2:33:52] CHILDREN ARE ABORTED OR DISCARDED OR
[2:33:55] SPOKEN OF AS TISSUE,
[2:33:58] not persons.
[2:34:01] What has happened to society?
[2:34:05] They have drifted from a God centered
[2:34:08] to self-centered.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible said men would be lovers of
[2:34:14] their own selves without natural
[2:34:16] affection.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; And it means that the GOD-GIVEN
[2:34:20] INSTINCTS FOR FAMILY, for motherhood,
[2:34:22] for fatherhood, and sacrificial love has
[2:34:26] been gone. AND WHEN SELF BECOMES THE
[2:34:30] IDOL, ANYTHING THAT COSTS US TIME or
[2:34:33] energy or responsibility feels like
[2:34:36] bondage.
[2:34:38] And pets offer
[2:34:41] AFFECTION WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY.
[2:34:44] CHILDREN REQUIRE SACRIFICE AND
[2:34:46] DISCIPLINE AND MATURITY, VIRTUES THAT
[2:34:48] OUR CULTURE NO LONGER CELEBRATES.
[2:34:52] AND CONVENIENCE BECOMES MORE VALUABLE
[2:34:54] THAN LIFE. And the modern prize today is
[2:34:59] career over commitment,
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; PLEASURE OVER PURPOSE,
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; AUTONOMY over responsibility.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; But children interrupt self-made plans.
[2:35:12] Pets can be controlled, trained, put
[2:35:16] away, given away,
[2:35:19] or put down.
[2:35:22] But babies must be raised,
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; loved, formed.
[2:35:27] And instead of receiving children as the
[2:35:30] scripture commands,
[2:35:32] children are a heritage of the Lord. And
[2:35:35] said, "Happy is a man whose quiver is
[2:35:37] full of them."
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; And I and I want to speak directly since
[2:35:44] I'm here,
[2:35:46] directly to young couples.
[2:35:49] Don't delay having children.
[2:35:52] YOU HAVE SO MANY years
[2:35:55] of life of which you're fertile
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; where you have opportunity.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; My wife was nearly 30 when she had
[2:36:08] Bethany and when she she ran out of
[2:36:11] energy with her and she said, "If she'd
[2:36:14] have been my first, she'd have been my
[2:36:16] last.
[2:36:21] It wasn't cuz she was a bad child. She
[2:36:23] was a wonderful child.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; It's cuz she had run out of energy.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; Raising a family, a godly family, is not
[2:36:32] only a natural joy. It's both a
[2:36:34] spiritual calling and a moral
[2:36:35] responsibility.
[2:36:38] But today, many couples hesitate. Some
[2:36:40] say we want to be more financially
[2:36:42] secure first. We need MORE TIME TO ENJOY
[2:36:46] LIFE BEFORE HAVING KIDS. WELL, I WOULD
[2:36:49] SAY IT'S WISE to be thoughtful and
[2:36:51] prayerful in YOUR DECISION. BUT I WANT
[2:36:53] you to remember this. You will never be
[2:36:56] wealthy enough, secure enough, or fully
[2:36:59] ready to have children.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; CHILDREN ALWAYS REQUIRE SACRIFICE, BUT
[2:37:04] IT IS A SACRIFICE WELL PLEASING TO GOD.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY'RE NOT A BURDEN,
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; they're a blessing.
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; I KNOW GOD GAVE ME FOUR. WE had two THAT
[2:37:16] WE LOST AND MISCARRIAGE. I wish for and
[2:37:19] I hope one day I'll see them in heaven
[2:37:21] if God permits.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But one day I I looked AROUND AS I
[2:37:26] SAW MINE ALL GROWING UP AND I SAID,
[2:37:27] "HONEY, I wish we'd have had more."
[2:37:31] Because why? Because why? They are they
[2:37:35] are a blessing and and and THEY ARE
[2:37:38] SACRIFICED WELL PLEASING to God. And and
[2:37:42] they shape your character.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, they do. THEY DEEPEN YOUR FAITH.
[2:37:47] THEY REFLECT THE IMAGE OF GOD IN YOUR
[2:37:49] HOME.
[2:37:51] YOU GET TO MODEL GOD
[2:37:53] IN PARENTHOOD.
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. AMEN. DON'T DON'T FEAR OR LET
[2:38:01] CULTURE ROB YOU OF JOY OR OR THE REWARD
[2:38:04] OF FAMILY.
[2:38:06] IF GOD HAS JOINED YOU IN COVENANT
[2:38:08] MARRIAGE, THEN OH, BE OPEN TO RECEIVE
[2:38:11] THE FRUIT OF THAT union
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; and raise CHILDREN WHO CAN CARRY THE
[2:38:16] LIFE OF CHRIST TO ANOTHER GENERATION.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE LIKE THE MODERN SOCIETY WHO
[2:38:22] TREATS WOMEN OR OR treats children as
[2:38:25] obstacles to happiness.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; We've redefined the family. We
[2:38:30] dismantled it
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; because Satan targets the family. And
[2:38:34] when headship was rejected, disorder
[2:38:37] follows. And today, marriage is delayed
[2:38:41] or abandoned. Cohabitation replaces
[2:38:44] covenant. Career becomes identity. And
[2:38:47] pets become children. And this is the
[2:38:50] fruit of a deeper spiritual war. Destroy
[2:38:53] the home. Destroy the future. And right
[2:38:56] now, even in America, our future is in
[2:39:00] danger as a nation because of lack of
[2:39:04] families raising children.
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; AND THEN WE HAVE THE THE RISE OF THIS
[2:39:10] THERAPEUTIC CULTURE. EVERYBODY IS a
[2:39:13] manic depression.
[2:39:15] EVERYBODY IS YOU POPPING PILLS one after
[2:39:19] another. AND OUR CULTURE BELIEVES
[2:39:21] EMOTIONAL COMFORT IS THE HIGHEST GOOD.
[2:39:24] AND THESE PETS, THEY PROVIDE
[2:39:27] UNCONDITIONAL AFFECTION WITHOUT
[2:39:29] ACCOUNTABILITY.
[2:39:32] BUT CHILDREN EXPOSES OUR OWN WEAKNESSES.
[2:39:36] THEY STRETCH US. THEY MATURE US. THEY
[2:39:39] FORCE US TO GROW.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; AND A GENERATION THAT AVOIDS DISCOMFORT
[2:39:45] NATURALLY AVOIDS THE REFINING WORK OF
[2:39:48] PARENTHOOD. And a SOCIETY THAT REJECTS
[2:39:51] GOD REJECTS LIFE. AND WHEN GOD IS
[2:39:54] REMOVED FROM EDUCATION, FROM MARRIAGE,
[2:39:56] from sexuality, FROM MORALITY, THEN THE
[2:39:59] VALUE OF THE HUMAN LIFE collapses
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; and THE SPIRIT OF ABORTION IS THE SPIRIT
[2:40:05] OF PHARAOH AND THE spirit of HEROD IS
[2:40:09] REVIVED AGAIN. IT IS A HATRED OF
[2:40:12] INNOCENT LIFE THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF
[2:40:15] PERSONAL POWER.
[2:40:17] And now YOU EVEN HEAR MESSAGE KIDS
[2:40:20] SAYING, MESSAGE GIRLS SAYING, "IT'S MY
[2:40:22] BODY."
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, it's not A BODY, IT'S
[2:40:26] A BABY.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Not your body.
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; It's a life. You were designed to be the
[2:40:35] bedding ground for that life.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; It's a holy thing that God has entrusted
[2:40:42] you with this virtue.
[2:40:45] Jesus said Satan was a murderer from the
[2:40:47] beginning and the culture of death is
[2:40:49] simply Satan's nature expressed through
[2:40:53] a godless society
[2:40:56] and you know this emotional vacuum then
[2:40:58] of not having children it creates
[2:41:01] surrogates they feel that need brother
[2:41:04] Brandham talked about it in an invisible
[2:41:06] union I I'm getting this from his
[2:41:08] message
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; that people still feel that deep human
[2:41:12] longing for connection
[2:41:13] But without God, WITHOUT FAMILY, WITHOUT
[2:41:15] COMMITMENT, THEY SUBSTITUTE PETS for the
[2:41:18] children they refuse to have. Pets then
[2:41:21] will fill the void that they but they
[2:41:23] cannot create a legacy, a lineage or
[2:41:27] continuation of life. And what is it? IT
[2:41:30] IS NOTHING BUT A PROPHETIC SIGN OF THE
[2:41:33] END TIME. THIS IS THE SAME CULTURAL
[2:41:37] SHIFT THAT HAPPENED in the days of Rome.
[2:41:39] It happened to Greece as they began to
[2:41:43] TO NEAR COLLAPSE. AND NOW THE WESTERN
[2:41:46] CULTURE IS REPEATING THAT SAME PATTERN.
[2:41:50] AND THE RISE OF PET BABIES AND DECLINE
[2:41:52] OF HUMAN BABIES IS A RESULT OF SELF-
[2:41:55] WORSHIP REPLACING GOD WORSHIP.
[2:41:58] CONVENIENCE REPLACING COMMITMENT.
[2:42:01] EMOTIONAL COMFORT REPLACING
[2:42:03] RESPONSIBILITY.
[2:42:05] REDEFINITION OF FAMILY AND GENDER ROLES.
[2:42:07] A CULTURE DEATH REPLACING THE VALUE OF
[2:42:10] LIFE. THE SPIRITUAL BLINDNESS THAT
[2:42:12] REJECTS THE BLESSING of children.
[2:42:15] PROPHETIC CONDITIONS OF THE LAST DAYS
[2:42:17] BEING FULFILLED. THIS FUR BABY IDENTITY
[2:42:21] AND THE RISE OF H AND THE RISE OF HUMAN
[2:42:25] DEGRADATION
[2:42:26] IS WHEN A SOCIETY ELEVATES animals to
[2:42:30] the level of children and then the next
[2:42:33] step is predictable.
[2:42:35] people begin lowering themselves to the
[2:42:37] level of animals
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; and that's why now we see this bizarre
[2:42:43] trend
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; identifi
[2:42:47] you know individuals identifying
[2:42:51] as cats and dogs and fur babies
[2:42:55] demanding litter boxes in schools
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; people wearing collars and tails and
[2:43:01] animal costumes as identity
[2:43:05] teachers being forced to play along with
[2:43:07] this delusion.
[2:43:10] And this is not simply confusion. This
[2:43:13] is spiritual insanity.
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; IT'S A MANIFESTATION OF ROMANS 1:28. GOD
[2:43:19] HAS GIVEN THEM OVER TO A REPETATE MIND.
[2:43:26] NOW A REPETITIVE MIND IS one that has
[2:43:28] lost THE ABILITY TO DISCERN THE
[2:43:31] DIFFERENCE OF WHAT between what is
[2:43:33] human, what's animal, what's sacred,
[2:43:35] what's profane, what is created in God's
[2:43:37] image, what is not. And when you elevate
[2:43:40] humans, you inevitably
[2:43:44] devalue or when you elevate animals, I
[2:43:46] meant you inevitably devalue humans.
[2:43:52] God created man in his image. He gave
[2:43:55] animals for companionship, labor,
[2:43:57] enjoyment, but not for identity,
[2:44:00] lineage, or purpose. And when we have a
[2:44:03] society that exalts pets as children,
[2:44:06] that spends money on animal welfare
[2:44:09] more THAN CHILD WELFARE, CRIES HARDER
[2:44:12] OVER A DOG'S DEATH THAN the abortion of
[2:44:14] a child,
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; then it's only a matter of time when
[2:44:18] people begin to forget what it meant to
[2:44:20] be human.
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; And this is the root OF THIS FUR BABY
[2:44:25] IDENTITY. When you remove God, you
[2:44:28] remove GOD'S ORDER. AND GOD'S ORDER WAS
[2:44:31] GOD, MAN IN his image, dead animals. But
[2:44:34] today, culture has the the order
[2:44:38] inverted in itself. Pets and children
[2:44:42] are optional or inconvenient
[2:44:44] and God's totally out of the picture.
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN DIVINE ORDER COLLAPSES,
[2:44:51] IDENTITY COLLAPSES with it. IF AN ANIMAL
[2:44:54] BECOMES A CHILD, THEN A CHILD CAN
[2:44:56] PRETEND TO BE AN ANIMAL. And this IS THE
[2:44:59] FRUIT OF REJECTING GOD'S CREATED ORDER.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; A generation
[2:45:08] is only they're only
[2:45:12] imitated
[2:45:13] what culture celebrates.
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO WE GOT? ANIMATED MOVIES WHERE
[2:45:21] animals behave like humans.
[2:45:24] Social media glorifying pet centered
[2:45:27] lifestyles.
[2:45:29] ADULTS CALLING dogs my baby and cats my
[2:45:34] grandkids.
[2:45:36] Classrooms forbidding gender terms but
[2:45:38] valid but validating fantasy identities.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; And they indeed will finally ask, well,
[2:45:47] if a pet can be a person, why can't I be
[2:45:49] a pet?
[2:45:51] And the lines blur because the
[2:45:52] boundaries that God created have been
[2:45:54] erased.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; And this is this the sign and the
[2:45:59] symptoms
[2:46:01] of a deep spiritual crisis.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; And this trend is not just
[2:46:08] psychological, it's spiritual.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; It's demonic.
[2:46:14] And it's the same spirit that drove the
[2:46:18] demonic
[2:46:19] of Gatherra to dwell among the tombs
[2:46:22] naked, acting less like human. And
[2:46:25] Satan's aim has never changed. That's to
[2:46:28] destroy the image of of of God and man,
[2:46:32] and make humans to be behave like
[2:46:35] beasts, TO STRIP THEM OF IDENTITY AND
[2:46:38] DIGNITY AND PURPOSE and reason. AND
[2:46:40] DANIEL SAW THE SAME SPIRIT UH RISE in
[2:46:43] the empires, they're represented as
[2:46:45] beast. You see, WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[2:46:48] LEAVES A CULTURE, the beast nature
[2:46:50] rises.
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; And there is a judgment for rejecting
[2:46:56] the truth. BECAUSE WHEN TRUTH IS
[2:46:58] REJECTED, CONFUSION IS THE RESULT.
[2:47:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; THEY PROFESS THEMSELVES TO BE WISE AND
[2:47:05] THEY'RE FOOLS.
[2:47:09] So society
[2:47:12] declares it, oh, it's enlightened. Oh,
[2:47:14] it's enlightened. It's progressive.
[2:47:17] It's compassionate.
[2:47:19] Yet children are told they can be cats
[2:47:22] and wolves and animals and objects
[2:47:26] or the opposite sex and what they were
[2:47:28] born or any identity their imagination
[2:47:31] invents.
[2:47:33] And meanwhile, the same society denies
[2:47:36] there's only two biological sexes,
[2:47:39] that babies in the womb are children,
[2:47:41] that family is God's design.
[2:47:47] They're a generation headed for
[2:47:49] punishment.
[2:47:51] They're a sign of a culture
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; that is under the wrath of God.
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to bring this down to you.
[2:48:03] But in all of that,
[2:48:07] there is a bride on earth
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; WHO IS THE BEDDING GROUND
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; FOR THE SEED WORD OF LIFE.
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; AND SHE IS NOT ABORTING HER CHILDREN
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; AND SHE IS NOT PRACTICING SPIRITUAL
[2:48:23] BIRTH CONTROL.
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; SHE IS NOT CLOSING HER ALTARS.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH. AMEN. SHE IS
[2:48:31] INVITING THE LUST TO COME AND FIND THEM
[2:48:34] AND BE MARRIED TO THE BRIDEGROOM
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; FOR CHILDREN TO BE BORN. SHE IS CREATING
[2:48:40] A BEDDING GROUND WITH AN ATMOSPHERE THAT
[2:48:43] BIRTHS CAN HAPPEN IN.
[2:48:45] [applause and cheering] IS SOMEBODY WITH
[2:48:47] ME NOW? SHE IS BRINGING FORTH A TONGUE
[2:48:50] TALKING LIKE 238 [applause] PRIVATE
[2:48:52] SCREAMING CHILDREN THAT HAS
[2:48:54] INCONVENIENCE THE MODERN CHURCH TODAY.
[2:48:56] [applause]
[2:48:57] BUT BROTHER, SHE LOVES HER HUSBAND AND
[2:49:00] THEY ARE IN THE IMAGE OF CHRIST AND THEY
[2:49:03] ACT LIKE HIS CHILDREN DID ON THE DAY OF
[2:49:05] Pentecost because they are the same word
[2:49:08] and the same seed.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, WHAT AN HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING
[2:49:14] IN.
[2:49:15] &gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN highly favored
[2:49:18] of God AND AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY AN ANGEL,
[2:49:21] the seventh messenger, saying, "You have
[2:49:23] been chosen, you virgin woman. AMEN.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE VIRGIN TO HIS WORD.
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU'VE BEEN BORN AGAIN AND BORN
[2:49:34] AGAIN. YOU WERE BIRTHED A NEW AND YOU
[2:49:36] DON'T EVEN HAVE AN OLD HUSBAND ANYMORE
[2:49:39] BECAUSE IN THIS NEW LIFE, IT'S NOT A
[2:49:41] REMARAGE. IT'S THE FIRST time you were
[2:49:43] married. [applause]
[2:49:48] THEREFORE, YOU ARE THE PURE,
[2:49:50] UNADULTERATED BRIDE IN JESUS CHRIST,
[2:49:53] CHOSEN, ELECTED, CALLED, AND ORDAINED
[2:49:56] FOR THIS HOUR.
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; Bringing forth word children,
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; born of his word.
[2:50:05] &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning?
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Won't you stand with me?
[2:50:14] For those of you that was watching time,
[2:50:16] that was a solid two hours.
[2:50:23] [applause]
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:32] [applause]
[2:50:34] Why don't we sing that song? Can't you
[2:50:36] see why I'm happy?
[2:50:39] I've accepted the word of the Lord,
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; the revealed word that was spoken.
