different this evening we're going to read a few verses and i'll let you be seated and then i have several brothers that's going to help me read the whole chapter of luke for the first chapter and part of the second chapter so we'll just have a christmas reading together amen i'd like to speak to you tonight on the greatest gift the greatest gift luke chapter 1 and verse 1 for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth an order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having a had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to right unto thee in order most excellent theophilus that thou mightest know this with certainty of those sayings which are therein thou has been instructed there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth amen we let you be seated and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless and they had no child because that elizabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years and it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before god in the order of his course according to the custom of the priest's office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord and zechariah said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i'm an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believeth not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season and the people waited for zacharias and marveled that he tarried so long in the temple and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his administration were accomplished he departed to his own house and after and after those days his wife elizabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days were in he looked on to take away my approach among men and in the sixth month of the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored and the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god will give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of judah forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come unto thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears that they leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord and mary said my soul death magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he hath showed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away he hath hope and his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed forever and mary abode with her about three months and returned to her own house now elizabeth's full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son and her neighbors and her cousins heard how the lord had showed great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they called him zacharias after the name of his father and his mother answered and said not so but he shall be called john and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name and they made signs to his father how he would have him be called and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name is john and they marveled all and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and he spake and praised god and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judea and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts saying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lord was with him and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us to perform the mercy promise to our fathers and remember his holy covenant the oath which he swear to our father abraham that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life and thou child shall be called the prophet of the highest for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our god whereby the day spring from our high from on high hath visit us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet unto the way of peace and the child grew and wacked strong in spirit and was in the desert till the day of his showing unto israel and it came to pass in those days there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and the lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wandered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but mary kept all these things and pondered them in our heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as as it was told them and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him unto the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer his sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtle doves are two young pigeons and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he seen the lord's christ and he came by the spirit into the temple when the the parents brought this or brought in this brought in jesus child jesus to do him after the custom of the law then took he him in his arms and he blessed god and said now let us thou serve and depart in peace according to thy word for my eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of the people of israel and joseph and his mother marveled at these things which were spoken of him and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and arising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yea a sword shall pierce through his own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and there was one anna a prophetess a daughter of feng yale the tribe of asser and she was great she was of great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow in about four score in four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fasting and prayer night and day and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord and spake of him to all that looked for redemption in jerusalem and when they had performed all these things according to the law of the lord they returned to galilee to their own city of nazareth and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him amen what a gift to the earth it's more than just a story but it's a reality you know we pause for a moment this time of year to remember there is a reason for this season it's more than just a gift or a tree or a light somewhere but you know obviously you know we understand that today was not the day that he was or this christmas the 25th was not the day that he was born but it was a day a day that should be set aside as we heard sunday to remember when a child was born and this child when it was born would change the world forever amen you know it's amazing that one little child be born in songs after song after song be written after him and and it's amazing you know the time that we live in that in this world that we live in and especially in this season you know it always seems like as evil as this world is around this time it's a little brighter you know people loves a little more and cares more for the fellow man and you know all why because a baby was born and of course it was not just another baby but it was god wrapped in human flesh and love came to earth and not only did that love come to earth it was love it was a love that came looking for me and it came looking for you you know as we would read brother brown would say christ was god's love gift to the world amen how many believes that the greatest gift that god ever could give was his only begotten son that was god's greatest gift and it would say there in john chapter 3 and verse 16 says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already in first john 3 16 i thought it was very interesting 3 16 and again hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren you know he had the power he was god he had the power that he could have compelled come into the world as a as however he wanted to he could have compelled people to bow down he could have compelled people to believe him by his power he had that kind of power but that's not what he wanted that's not what he chose amen i thought it was very interesting that zacharias would see the angel and and he would you know i see all the things there went on as we read in our scripture but yet he would come to this question and many of it many translations translated like this how do you expect me to believe this this was how what he was asking how do you expect me to believe what you've said what what kind of sign can i have amen but see god did it wasn't just he he didn't want to force somebody to believe he wanted somebody to have a heart to believe and so he could have forced he could have made but that's not his way amen he could have filled the world with lightnings and thunders and chariots amen to announce a new king's arrival but he didn't he could assemble the richest and the greatest and the most powerful people upon the earth to witness the arrival of a new king amen but he didn't he could have he could have forced himself but he didn't god never wanted to force himself on anyone that's just not the way he does things he could've but he chose a poor girl from a poor village to give birth to the king of kings amen instead of a palace he chose a stable amen instead of uh the greatest assembly of the powerful he would bring the shepherds he would bring the common people he would bring the common laborers of that day and they were chosen to be the first witness of the birth of a king when god came to earth he came to the least he came to the last he came to the lowest and he came to the lost amen these people witnessed the birth of a king who never owned a home he never held a political office he never made a grab for power it was a simple man from a poor mother from a small town but still considered a great person of interest 2 000 years later amen what a paradox this is amen why was it not because he forced himself to own people to choose him but it was because for centuries men and women had been seeking after god and they found him in this little man or in this baby amen what's remarkable is that while they had been seeking god god had actually been looking for them so that's what happened 2000 years ago was god came down love came down looking for a people he came in the form of man and showed the whole world what god's word love was really like amen on that first christmas god's perfect gift was love now if you want to get aggravated at me for calling him the chris first christmas gift get aggravated at the prophet because that's what he called it he says now if you take the love out of christmas where will you put it what will you do with it what will you do with him if you remove what we you do with him or with love if we remove it from the season what fills people's hearts amen usually starts to show up everywhere amen because what's in your heart that's what you do amen so that's why you see evergreens that's why you see lights that's why you see stars that's why you see nativity scenes that's why you see because it reminds people of the love that came looking for them so long ago hallelujah i'm so glad his love came looking for a people i'm so glad his love came looking for me amen aren't you glad about that he could have left you out there but love began to calm and look after you in the darkest of places in the diet and it chose the poorest of humanity and and the weakest of humanity and it begin to move upon that person you know we could see it like this you know as it must have been a as we break into this for a moment it must have been a little after dark and the sun was going down and the stars had no doubt been out for a little while the light was gone now for two hours or so and you can see this little donkey placing one little tired foot in front of another going up the back seat side of a hill west of bethlehem and he was watching to be very cautious of his little hooves where he had placed him because he happened to be sitting on him with some precious cargo and joseph was leading this little donkey gently along and as this little trio started up the hill and been traveling all day coming from nazareth and here mary was sitting up on this donkey expecting to be a mother at any time way past due maybe but all things are for ordained of god things all things work together for the good that love him it was ordained of god that there would be a a heartless king on the throne a bloodthirsty herod amen it was ordained of god god knew about it and he put him there for a reason and he placed him there in that place of power now herod might have thought he'd done that but god done that amen god knew about the taxes he knew about the brutal government that had no thoughts or mercy on a poor mother or or upon the uh anybody that was crippled or anything like that they he knew about all that was going on he did it for a reason and he's bringing this little baby to a certain place because it's been prophesied that he's going to be born in bethlehem and god's prophecy works together amen he may he allows kings to rise he brings them down he brings them up he allows governments to come up he brings them down whatever what is it what's going on god's allowing it to happen for his prophecy to be fulfilled so we see the time that we live in amen god's allowed governments to rise he's allowed certain presidents to be on the scene he's allowed certain things it's because it's working according to his prophecy amen so he commanded that they should come amen to this place so called bethlehem and you know we can see as they stop there for a moment on top of the heel and kind of to stretch their legs for a moment and they take mary he says joseph tells mary won't you get off the off the mule or the donkey for a minute and he eases her off he would try to be very careful and they're looking out as they just come over that last hill and they're looking at bethlehem and he's looking down there and he sees the bustling of the city it's swell to many times its size because of all the other people coming in and they're being you know for the taxation and the sick and the needy and the bedridden and the leopard and the cancer and the lame and the blind all had to come because of a government's order and herod had been behind it and he's he's placed it to this part and this little party stops for a moment to catch their breath and he sets mary down on a rock he said i can see joseph pick up her tender tenderly in his arms and help her off the mule and and he just puts her down and sits on a nice comfortable place as he could find and they're watching this as people are in and out in the streets and and the crowd and the torches running the yales and and people laying there in the yards and the courtyards and outside the city gate must have been some sight joseph must have said you know mary dear just think just beyond as they're looking at this camp this picture and just beyond right over there was ruth the moab moabite gleaned yonder in the fields of boaz right over there's where david with the slingshot took a line and he took a bear and right over there is where joshua with his gleaming sword that fearless warrior of our people divided the lands and and he's just explaining all that taking place in that area and here they are he turns around and he looks at her and he's looks at her pretty face as this turned towards the skies and he didn't say anymore because he said because in her eyes there was a reflection and there was a star looking back at him through her eyes he knew she was looking at something and she looks at him and says joseph have you noticed that star hanging there and it kind of turned into surprises that you know i haven't noticed it before dear she said well it's been following us ever since the sun went down and i've watched it it must be something to it because i have a most wonderful feeling brother branham interjects right here he says you know god does things like that for his people he shows us a lied or he shows us something just so we know he's near hallelujah this is what he's done in our generation he showed us something he's given us a message a great shining light that is shouting out the king is here just so we know he's near and he's on the scene and no matter what the world has to say our governments has to say he's still here and everything will be all right oh let's just rejoice in this christmas season amen the world's looking at another barrier and they're looking at this and they're looking at that and they're watching governments fall off the mouth but we know we've seen his star amen we've seen the message the message has been heralded and he's here among us and everything's going to be all right joseph might have said something mary like this mayor you know what you know it's kind of funny this is very it's a paradox mary uh we've been under this mandate by the roman government but you know i've never been so happy in my life i don't know why just looking at the city again and where we roamed as boys and girls and back in our teenage and school years i mean i got it there's an excitement about me there's something that's taking place you know at that moment way over in the east somewhere many mile hundreds of miles away maybe a thousand miles away some magis was already on their road they had seen a star and they were coming to worship god's little gift package he was sending to the world just a little while from then and the whole world was going to receive its greatest gift it's ever received this little package wrapped up for the first christmas practice that was ever wrapped in all the world god wrapped it up god wrapped it up the greatest thing that was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in a guard wrapped himself in a christmas package and sent it down to the world what a gift that god would come in humanity and wrap himself and to think he came in such a way a few shepherds saw it a few magis but the majority of the world refused it why couldn't they see it why did they turn it down why is it they don't want it you know some people get so caught up as brother adam would go through many times and talk about the tinsel and the wrapping paper and we'll speak a little bit about that but you know to me some people get all caught up and it's got to be wrapped up just perfect every corner has got to be creased and they gotta measure out just exactly right that's for your ocd people that's not for me because by the time i get it unwrapped it's not gonna look nothing like that and tear right into it because i don't want the wrapping paper i want what's inside amen see many times they they would look at this wrapping paper and it'd be wrapped in a little frame so tall and hair down to his shoulders and looked like just any ordinary rapping looked like it was nothing but inside of it was eternal life [Applause] that's what you want amen we that's what we're after we're not after what's on the outside and that was great and that was wonderful and i'm glad it came but what i want is what's on the inside but here they came in the place it wasn't you know because it wasn't handed to them in the custom they were used to gifts being handed you know that's the reason it's rejected even tonight is because it's not handed to people in the custom they've been used to receiving gifts but god wrapped his own package and he's got a right to do it how he wants to do it just like you do if you want to take time and make them all just pretty exact and right that's great that's wonderful amen but if somebody wants to just wrap it in a walmart sack that's great that's wonderful it's not important what the wrapping is what's important is what's on the inside and by the way brother tim talked about you know carrying on the tradition of brother branham and giving a gift to him every year and be all right to start that here don't forget amen [Applause] the assistant pastor brother neville i thought i'd throw that in there right quick meant to do that at the beginning and i'm short-circuiting every once in a while myself amen but see it was rejected because it wasn't given the way they expected it you know they thought well surely if the king of kings is coming he's going to have an angel salute red carpet's going to come out of heaven it's going to roll right down into the high priest right there to the inner courts or right into the holy of holies and say here i am but that wasn't the way he came amen you know it wasn't the way they expected it it came as a as a baby crying in a dirty manger they was expecting something you know different they was expecting chariots they they were expecting maybe an angel escort or or you know something to happen like that but he said i had said i'm going to give you a sign a virgin shall conceive and you shall bear and she shall bear a child a son and they shall call his name emmanuel that's the sign you shall receive that's the gift i'm going to give you but it still didn't come the way they expected it although it was written in prophecy another thing that didn't come the way they expected because it came by some poor people mary you know and maybe somehow come up with this story she met an angel we know what happened well i mean they told it they told it to jesus later he said you know we're of our fight we're not we're basically told we're not illegitimate we're not born of fornication the pharisees to jesus because what was it referring back back to his birth amen so they was trying to disqualify him but they didn't realize what had happened they couldn't understand that god would come off the paper in the flesh amen see that's the gift he wants he wants to put his life in the flesh not just be a bunch of paper or a bunch of tapes on the wall or a bunch of quotes on your computer he wants to put the gift in flesh that's the greatest gift the greatest gift amen is not just a bunch of paper this is a wonderful gift but it's not the greatest gift it's a bunch of words if it ain't got the life to back it up the greatest gift is the life he said you know it's like this he said when this great gift would come to a church the holy spirit it falls on people but they don't want to humble themself they want the holy spirit with class they don't want it the way god sends it many people wants to receive the holy ghost but they don't want to get it the way they want to get it the way they want to get it he said i'm glad you can't do it that way you have to go the way god sends it and humble yourself so it wasn't wrapped in fine linens it was wrapped in a swaddling cloth it was wrapped with stuff off the back of an ox that would put around their necks to keep it from galling their skin and the ox would the yoke would lay upon it and they're sweaty and it's nasty and this is what he wrapped himself in amen think of it emmanuel the creator of heavens and earth wrapped in rags what a super sign little jehovah crying like a baby god made flesh in a package the god who covers all space all time before there was ever a world or star or molecule wrapped himself in a little package and was laid in a manger amen in a stable where the manure the cattle is sheep and straw and hey and jehovah was laying there crying like a baby they wanted an angel escort and he came wow god's greatest gift wow wow you think the rich would want something to do with that it would pollute them to walk in that stable and kneel down and worship that they couldn't do it brought by a little peasant girl considered a fanatic because of her story by carpenter who probably didn't even know how to read and write maybe didn't hardly know his abcs you'd think that would be something that could give pleasure to the rich and to the high-minded and the denominational of their day no they turned it down flat but not only in that day they do it in this day as well they want a creed they want a dogma they want something wrapped in the tinsel of religion but they don't want the life they don't want the life that comes with it that's the reason why today they don't want the gift of god the united states they don't want the gift of god they don't want that life they want a santa claus they want shiny things they want they want real bright colors of this and that but they don't truly want the life of christ he says he was rejected on that first christmas and he's just as rejected today on this christmas because it disagrees with what they've been taught it disagrees with how they think they ought to act it disagrees with everything of religion he says no wonder there's no room for him in the end it wasn't wrap right it wasn't wrapped in the classical paper it was wrapped as a gift a gift from god sent from god a god that they didn't know nothing about although they claimed they did and they claimed they was looking for him but he came in a way that they thought he was coming a different way from what they thought okay he was coming not according to the creeds and they could not receive god's gift because he was wrapped up like a baby born in a manger come from poor people from a bunch of fanatics and they could not receive them and neither will they receive it today there's no room listen to this he said there's no room for him in the end there's no room in our religious circles today for a holy ghost meeting they don't want it it belittles them in the sight of the classes of of their people it belittles them to think listen to this it belittles them to think that they would humble themselves to come down to an altar and cry and carry there until they're filled with power from on high and to rise up with newness of life but they don't want to sacrifice for that gift the greatest gift you know it is very important you know people think of an altar as a place of just repentance or a place you know because you're backsliding you need to go no it's a altar is a place of worship it's a place of getting making the commitment a communion between you and god and talking things out that's why you don't look down on a preacher who kneels at an altar a deacon a trustee a song leader anybody old elder an elder a young person amen it may not be that they got sins in their life they may just want to talk to god for a moment but listen the key is don't stay there till you feel something stay there until you got something stay there until you know that answer has been given to you and you receive his gift he says why why won't they receive this life he said because they receive the life it'll make women let their hair grow out it'll make women act like they ought to it'll make men throw away their cigarettes and their smoking and drinking and treat their wives and families right but it's too much for them they hold on to a creed of the church instead of receiving god's gift god's christmas gift the greatest gift they rather have a creed than they would a gift they'll gift they'd rather have a paper than the gift they want a paper something that's all tinsel a lot of fuss a lot of but nothing to do about it but the real gift that's on the inside they don't want it he was wrapped in a dirty cloth a swaddling cloth he was wrapped today in the same thing what they call holy rollers and fanaticism and a bunch of heretics it was wrapped in that same cloth he said but i'm glad so glad to raise that cloth off and look and see what's laying underneath eternal life god made flesh and dwelt among us brother brandon would tell the story you can go read it it's a very very interesting story brother wayne lawson brought it to my attention my memory again he would it would tell in another christmas story and god's gifts find their place about a man and a woman that was really poor and they was living in new york city i'm i'm assuming it was during the great depression and they had a little girl and they couldn't hardly she wanted a baby doll for christmas she desired a baby doll so the father was doing everything he could to get her this baby doll and his wife had tuberculosis and in the middle of all this she ended up passing away and he's got this little girl and he's still working and trying to trying to get some money together scratching everything he could to go buy her this little baby doll and she the little girl catches pneumonia and dies the boy the man runs to his house and his grief and he grabs a little tin where he saved up money and he got it all out he ran into the streets and he began to weep and cry and look for a baby doll he finally finds one that he could afford a little raggedy little nothing seemed like but it was something he could buy for her even though she was dead he still had it in him brother branham said he kind of lost his mind so to speak and he just he just gets by as a doll he carries around with him down to the streets trying to give this baby doll to his little girl come christmas night and the parties are going on and things are taking place and the lights are flashing and music's popping and he's walking down crying trying to give this little baby doll to his little daughter the police stops him and said what are you doing said man you need to go home where you where you live and he said well i live with such and says he said you're headed the wrong direction turn around and go back before you die in this cold and he said i got to get this baby doll to my little girl and he just turns and he walks away and the next morning they find the man in the alley dead that little baby dolls put to his heart brother branham picks it up and he says you know what the man had to die to give his love his girl that baby doll he said i expect he gave it to her in another world and he begins to talk about he said how much christ came down that love gift and he wanted to give something to somebody he wanted to give healing he wanted to give deliverances he wanted to fulfill his promise and his word he wanted to do all this but how could he do it he had to die he had to lay himself on a cross and be crucified so out of him to his to his little girl could come love and peace and happiness and joy and healings and deliverances he had to die to fulfill his promise to you that's the greatest gift a man could ever give is to lay down his life and he did it for you and for me he had to die fulfill his promises listen this is the greatest thing a man could ever find was jesus christ if you ain't found him tonight it's the greatest thing you could ever find it's greater than the biggest gold nugget it's because he is the biggest gold you could ever find it's greater than the biggest diamond because he is the biggest diamond you could ever hold he's the most expensive diamond he's the greatest carroted diamond that was ever brought out of the dust of the earth the greatest gold that was ever brought out of the dust of the earth he's a jewel he's a jewel of heaven but he had to be crushed he had to be beaten he had to be whipped and the bible would say he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities that the chastisement of our peace was laid upon him and with his stripes we are healed he had to die so you can receive that healing did he die then receive your healing did he die then receive your joy did he die then receive your deliverance did he die then receive your peace he did it to give it to you he was wounded and bruised and chopped and cut he was pierced in his side blood running out of his back from the strips it's the stripes he was beaten out his beard was pulled off his feet driven with a nail but he embraced the cross think about this he embraced the cross instead of a soft feathered pillow instead of a little pink gown he wore a swaddling cloth do we see what depths of love writers have tried to write it they've tried to express it we sing the song if we with ink the ocean feel and where the skies are parchment made every stalk on earth a quill and every man ascribed by trade to write the love of god above would drain the ocean dry or could the scroll contain the hole though stretched from sky to sky think of it stalks made into quills billions of men's men scribes would write five little letters or four little letters l o v e it would drain the ocean dry this is the love he has for you tonight and the scroll this canvas of the skies couldn't contain it all the love of god how god unfolded himself and became a christmas package laid on straw the first thing he would pelea's head on was a little bit of straw and a dirty piece of swaddling cloth the last thing that would be on his head a crown of thorns and a dirty rag to wipe his eyes and he'd be hit in the head saying if you're a prophet tell us who hit you and he'd be nailed to a cross love love reached out to you love reached out to me when his own children were crying for his blood he screamed father forgive them they don't even know what they do he gave the greatest gift himself but i know how it is even in this christmas season we feel really odd if somebody gives us a gift and we don't have something to give back so what can you give back you he gave you him he wants from you you that's the greatest gift you can give him oh you oh i got dedicated my home brother timothy my house he he gave me and my cars and my job god wants you he wants us in this christmas season he's looking for more human flesh listen to this brother as we bring this on down the random surge we would see jesus he said see these little ladies and young men just teenaged standing here around this altar kneeling down in this great reckless time we're living in what a thing to see them come weeping you just don't know how that pleases the holy spirit he said let's bow our heads a moment in prayer i said to you that's coming here i want to quote some scripture to you your little ladies young your elderly people all together you know what you are tonight your god's love gift to christ jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him first and all the father has given me will come think what you're doing tonight you have passed by coming on this to accept christ you passed from death to life wow what an exchange of gifts you've passed from death to life if you trust me to be god's servant you believe me to be a servant watch this happen i'm going to quote scripture to you what jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that send me hath everlasting life and shall never come to judgment but has done past from death to life think of that think of that jesus said that and just look just think of these little ladies in the city tonight think of these young men and these elderly men in the city middle-aged men and women tonight that doesn't have the opportunity you have god has sent you here and manifested himself before you with you and you with a broken heart come to this altar what are you doing you're god almighty god's love gift he chose you and he gave himself for you that he might take you to himself what an exchange god's gift package wrapped up in the form today of the holy ghost has been extended to us it's been brought to you now it's your turn to exchange your gift what gift will you give him let's bow our heads what do you have for him in this christmas season well brother timothy i've been really busy busy doing what why don't you accept his love gift it's free you don't have to put a dollar an all from plate the only exchange is you are you willing to lay down your life as he laid down his for you in this christmas time what gift do you have under the tree don't you see what gift he had under his tree he had the blood the water and the spirit those elements that make up life are now looking for another rapping another place to be wrapped in humanity he had to die to give you your gift will you die to give him yours i wonder if we just
