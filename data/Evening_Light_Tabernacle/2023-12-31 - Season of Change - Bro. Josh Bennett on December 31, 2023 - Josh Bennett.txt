this morning I believe he's worthy Worthy is the Lamb of God hallelujah hallelujah you know I I was just I was just thinking the other day and has been preaching on out of the Book of John and then come over there in the John 19 and Jesus is standing in Pilot's Hall and and everything that happened to him was for the purpose of humiliation they made a mockery out of him and put a crown of thorns on his head and a robe of of mockery and everything they done was to mock him and he never opened up he never opened his mouth brother brandham said that Satan looked at him and said this could not be the Son of God there just no way there's no way that this that this is the promised one how could he be the Son of God and and allow them to do all these things he said but what he didn't understand he said as a Son of God can go through anything as long as he knows he's in the will of God and Jesus stood there and he didn't even open his mouth and I thought all the humiliation and they looked and then they wouldn't they took him and nailed him on the cross and even the people that was around the cross said if you'll come down we'll believe you and we'll follow you see but I got to thinking about it that Thief even the the thief on the on the one side he said save us and save yourself we'll believe you save us but the other Thief I got to thinking about him and he saw Jesus in his most humiliated time in the most humiliated condition I thought about it I thought you know what his encounter with Christ was not when he was walking on the water that's right his encounter with Christ was not when he was opening up blinded eyes and and raising the dead and all the supernatural thing his encounter with Christ was when he was at in his most humiliated condition but yet there was something in his heart he looked at Jesus Christ in the most humilated condition that he could be be in and he still believed and I thought oh God that's me I'm the thief that was on The Cross by his side and I just want to say Lord remember me amen how many has that attitude this one just remember me Lord amen let's just bow our hearts together Lord Jesus we thank you Lord we thank you for Calvary Lord we know God that we wouldn't be here this morning if it wasn't for Calvary Lord we are what we are by the grace of almighty God no nothing Lord we could boast of Lord it was by your grace lord it's by that Grace we stand here this morning Lord we just thank you God for the price that was paid the victory that's been one Lord as we stand here God and I look out at this congregation I realize as that I'm looking at the purchase of that blood Lord what a what a responsibility it is and I pray oh God that Lord that the Holy Spirit would just come Lord we're inviting you to come I pray God that you would just lead us and guide us and Lord may you take and open up the scripture to us Lord that's what we're asking of this morning Lord we want your presence just to be near Lord we want you to come and walk up and down the Avenues of our hearts and to discern the needs of our lives and Lord I pray that you would Minister Lord because I believe that if if you could just speak a word this morning it would make all the difference L maybe there's a lot of things that we've looked at and Lord notes that we have and whatever more but but God I pray that you would just speak Lord minister to the knes that lays in the body I pray that you would just have your way Among Us Lord when it's all said and done and the last day man has been said we'll be so careful to give you all the glory and all the honor for we ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this morning we're just amen honored to be with you once again and we uh certainly appreciate the invitation to be here and the opportunity we always counted a great honor to um speak to uh the bride or portion of the Bride wherever we are and and so uh we just want to um look into the word this morning if you have your Bibles would like to turn to the Book of Ecclesiastes in the third chapter and uh I want to say once again how much we appreciate uh your pastor and the ministry here at the church and um it's been a great blessing to us and Through the Years through our church back home and so we certainly appreciate each one amen Ecclesiastes the third chapter and I'd like to read from the uh first verse and then I'd like to read also uh one place in the New Testament second Corin Ians chapter 3 but as we look here in Ecclesiastes the 3r chapter in verse one and the Bible says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Ren and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace peace for what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he hath labor I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it and he hath made everything beautiful in his time and also he has set the world in their heart uh in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end amen 2 Corinthians the third chapter just one verse there 2 Corinthians 3 I'd like to read Verse 18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen may God just add His blessings to the reading of the words as you're having your seats this morning I'd like to um speak for uh a few minutes this morning on a the season of change and um I believe that you know uh we're getting ready to change the calendar and so we've we've come to the end of another year and the uh the end of of of this year will just take us into the beginning of the next and and so um we see that you know we're we've come to another change or time of change and I was just thinking remembering back um in June we had our meeting there at the church and we were dedicating the church and brother Timothy had come and and uh was a part of those meetings and and um and he uh he spoke I don't remember what you titled exactly but was it the season of change so it's same title uh but he spoke on that and and uh it was just um it was really just the Lord it was Supernatural because uh what he didn't know was uh just a couple weeks before that I was sitting in my in my office there at the church and I had a calendar there and and uh I was marking the dates on the calendar for the meeting and just you know kind of going over the calendar and putting down different things and so I was marking the dates on the uh uh uh of the calendar for the beginning of our meeting and the first night of our meeting on the calendar it said uh the beginning of Summer and I I I just I just kind of struck me the beginning of Summer and I just wrote uh on that date uh the you know meeting starts and and then underneath that I I wrote um a change or a season of change and and you know or I think I actually wrote a change of season or something along those lines because I it just kind of stood out to me that the meeting was beginning at the chain of a season and and and you know and then brother Timothy come and he preached that uh that message and and the Lord really spoke to our hearts and was just dealing with people and and and and um I remembered back to where the Lord had dealt with me at the beginning of that year at the at the ending of of uh uh 2022 uh the Lord had kind of dealt with my heart on some things and and you know sometimes you you you you preach a sermon and then sometimes the Lord there's it's just something special you come under the burden of something and and you know the ministers will know what I'm talking about you just the Lord gives you something it becomes a burden to you uh and you know that it's going to speak directly to to to the church or to a need or situations and and and that's how the Lord was dealing with me and he was dealing with me in a in the in this uh direction of a season of change and uh you know as I thought about that I thought that um you know everything is changing I mean you know all through our lives everything is changing and and change is hard and we got to be honest this morning most of us don't like change I mean you know if we're honest with ourselves change ain't easy and and we really don't like it because you know we we get accustomed to things and and we get in our routines and so forth and and so change is not easy but yet you can't stop it that's right I mean everything is constantly changing as a matter of fact there's there's only one constant amen there's only one thing that never changes and that's God and His word outside of that everything changes as you know as it's always said the only thing that that don't change is that everything changes because it's just true and and you know even in our in our lives you know our our personal lives you know we we don't stay the same we don't stay the same age I know we wish we could but we don't and we don't look the same and and and you know because we're constantly changing brother Brandon would talk about it he said of how that nature testifies of God he said we find the trees and the leaves go off the trees and and and and then the life that was in the tree goes down into the ground like a grave and it'll stay there until the Wrath of the winter is passed and then it comes back again bringing forth new life it's a testimony that we live again see the sun rises of a morning it's just like a little baby see it's weak and then after a while uh in it time it it goes through the school and then it goes through high school and about noon time it's in its strength but then in the afternoon it begins to turn to the other side and then in the evening it begins to get weak again and it dies amen but that's not the end of the sun it just comes up again the next morning to testify Amen to another generation that there is life amen and and and listen and there's and there's also a resurrection Amen brother bam says you know that that even the amen every day every day the cycle of that day is a testimony to you and I amen that there is life amen after death and there will be a resurrection amen and and he takes the the the the the cycle of the day and the Sun the different phases of the Sun and he ties that with our lives and how that we're born that would be the morning and and we grow and we get stronger but then there's a time that it turns and starts going the other way and we begin to get weak is that right amen he says God's got a time for all things he's got a Time see see there's a time that we plant corn and there's a time that we that we plow and there's a time that we Harvest see and then the the the spring rains come and the and then the drought through the summer and the fall rains and the Snows and and and and and you just can't say well I'll plant my wheat today and then tomorrow I'll go out and harvest it no amen God has a season see he's got seasons for his word he's got seasons in the script scripture where it says that the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick and that's when Jesus uh uh was ministering too see the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick but we find out that God works everything seasonly How We Know by the scripture that the angel come down at a certain season and troubl the water is that right amen see it it was it was the season for healing at that time and that's what brother Brown was saying and he says you got to you got to recognize the seasons you got to because you just can't go out and plant corn anytime you want to amen and let me just say this that's why you young people you got you're in a special time in your life because you're in a planting season see you're you're in a season that you're actually planting seeds that later you're going to harvest because amen the Bible says God is Not mocked whatsoever a man plants that that whatever he SWS that's what he's going to reap see amen so whatever kind of seed you seow that's the kind of harvest you're going to have and let me just say this the only time in your life that you can determine amen what kind of harvest that you want to that you want to reap amen is when you're planting the seeds am mean you can't you know go out and plant seeds and then cultivate in water and if you plant corn you're not going to harvest green beans you see whatever you put in the ground and that's that's what's going to uh uh come forth and that's what kind of harvest you're going to have and that's why it's so important that you seow the right seed Amen in the planting season see others amen here uh this morning we're not in the sewing season of our life amen we're in the harvest season we're actually reaping the seeds that we've sown amen and you can look and I just say this thank God for Grace amen because there's a lot of seeds that I wish I would have never sown and amen I thank God for Grace I I hope that everybody in here amen appreciates the grace of God because amen there there's a lot of things that we would reap that amen listen it wouldn't be so good because we didn't always seow the right kind of seed amen even as Christians that's why amen when you live in a life of sin and you plant those kind of seeds amen listen even after God saved you and fills you with the Holy Ghost many times amen you deal with the scars and the and those things will come up later in your life amen what is it you're harvesting what you planted and that's why amen as a young person you ought to determine in your heart this morning I'm going to plant the right kind of seed so that I'll have the right kind of harvest hallelujah amen I tell you this that's what God done amen God Amen didn't wait to see how it was all going to turn out to determine amen what kind of people he was going to have in the end time or what kind of harvest he was going to have in the Harvest Time amen God already made his determination in the beginning so he sowed the right kind of seed to start with so that in the end amen he would have the right kind of harvest hallelujah amen that's why amen he swed amen with a spoken word which is the Original Seed and God SED the seed of a word bride amen God so the seed of Overcomers God so the seed amen of a Victorious church and that and because that's the kind of seed amen that God put in the ground that's the kind of harvest that God's going to have hallelujah amen but for everything there's a time and there's a season amen watch the prophet of God says amen that that Jesus amen even Jesus speaking he said the f he he he's praying he said the time has come see father the time has come and brother BR said there's seasons for everything do you believe that amen and now you see you sewing a certain season you're reaping a certain season and there's Seasons when uh uh time the time the time comes that it's right for for things to happen amen I love that there amen there's a season that the time comes when it's right for things to happen do you believe that it's just like in our in our own lives and I'm just going to follow the leadership of the holy spirit because to be honest with you I had something completely different but the Lord just kept pulling me back in this direction and and and you know I remember years ago the first time I ever come uh to down here to Louisiana and and come to the church brother Tim told me back in the office he said he he said brother Josh he said don't you get in your mind because this is brother Tim puis church that we don't have no problems or we don't have he said there's problems in this church just like any other church and there's people that need help and there's people that need deliverance and there's people that need healing and and and you know that really helped me as a as a as a as a young pastor at the time uh it really spoke to me because I thought you know what that really encouraged my heart because sometimes you know you you get things in your mind that you know that you know well uh that that church don't have no issues or that church and and and and and you fail to recognize amen that listen it don't matter where you're at or what church you're in or what group you're preaching to there's needs amen because people are there and people are needy and and that's not a you know condescending in any kind of way amen we're just human amen and and that's why amen the holy spirit is dealt with my heart many times amen it's not just about preaching good sermons and putting quotes together and and tying things together amen sometimes we just need to be a real minister of the gospel and let the holy spirit amen speak through us to minister to the needs that are laying in the body and I trust by the help of God that that that we can do that today but but as we look at this because you know we have seasons in our own lives and I want to as we go forward in this service I I I'm going to be using you know us as individuals and then at times I'll be speaking to uh the church because listen you will go through Seasons as an individual and and also the church collectively as a body will go through Seasons listen churches go through Seasons just like you go through as an individual not always on the mountain and churches are not always on on the mountain toop listen every every service that we have we're not always you know in the shout and Revival or or whatever more and that don't mean that the spirit of God has left the church amen it just means you're going through something you see and and you as an individual you're going through seasons in your life and and brother B was talk about in in leadership he said remember each one of us as young uh young and old the first step we ever made in in our life someone had to lead you see that's right and the last step you ever make someone will be leading you somebody has to lead you in the first step was probably ever taken amen he said was probably in the hands of some kind old mother and them hands may be still tonight out there in the cemetery somewhere but that was a hand that held you to to make your first step and then after your mother taught you how to walk and and you made a few steps and fall down and get up and and you thought you were doing great things and she turned you over then to the school teacher and then she began to lead you to an education and how you must do and how you must learn and so forth like that and after the teacher got through with you then you returned back to the father and the father got a hold of you and then when your father got a hold of you he taught you perhaps your business and how to be successful and how to do things right and see your mother taught you how to be a housewife and how to cook and so forth and all this amen but then he says and then after they got through with you then your minister or or the priest got a hold of you and then he asked the questions but he said but but who leads you now amen amen who's leading you now that's the question amen we're all led by something amen we have to be because we're LED amen and so you see what the prophet is saying we're we're we're growing we don't stay children and we don't stay in the same season of our life you know I know by as a parent I didn't want my kids to grow up you know I said I I I said it at the church one time I said we don't want our kids to grow up and I just felt it I said well you know I know some of you do cuz you got 25 year olds still living with you and stuff like that amen you think man you don't know the you don't know my kids I want my kids to grow up but I'm talking about you know I got a a little picture over her on my nightstand beside my bed of my two little girls Levi wasn't even born yet and they're just little girls you know and and sometimes I look over that and I just start crying don't even I can't even help myself I think what in the world happened how do we get here you know how did this happen cuz I didn't want them to grow up I to I told the church a while back I said you know I remember as a as a as a as a young boy growing up in the message and I remember you know we thought the Lord was coming any day I mean we just you know it's just like brother Tim said you know who who would ever thought you know here we are 2024 am mean and and and I remember growing up and and you know I thought the Lord's coming anytime just any day we we just and I remember secretly praying Lord I want to get my license so bad I I just want to drive a car and you know you're you won't tell nobody but just secretly praying just Lord please just if you could just wait till I get my license and then you know I pray and and I got my license got 16 got my license and then you know I thought Lord I want to get married so bad and just secretly pray if I if you could just allow me to to to get married and just you know have this experience and and then I got married and I thought Lord I want a family so bad if I I just want children you know and I'm telling you I'm just being honest with you am me I just pray in that way Lord if you could just T there's just things I you know I would love to do and love to experience amen but then I had children and as they begin to grow up my prayers completely changed I said Lord please come before they get their license you know my prayer completely turned other way and I begin to pray oh God please come before they get married amen amen you see but but but you know as much as we would love to keep our children small it don't matter what you do you cannot stop the change you'll never prevent them from growing up they're going to grow and if you keep keep uh treating them like a child and treating them like a baby you're going to ruin their lives amen listen as they change your relationship with them's got to change how you speak to them and how you handle them it's got to change amen as they're changing see even as we're growing in in the changes of the cycles of our life brother Brown talked about every seven years every seven years your life changes see and then he said seven time seven you see that's a complete uh uh change and it bothers the women and and and Men usually get kind of funny carrying on during that time sometimes they leave their wives and we what is it they're going through a what they call in the world a midlife crisis really what it is is they're having a hard time accepting what they're becoming see and and and and and nobody wants to get old but every but but but you know if you if you continue to live I mean it's just the process you you can't CH you can't change this kind of like brother Homer uh always says brother Homer longor he said the the the only good thing about getting old is some didn't but you know but but you just can't help it I mean if you live if you continue to live you're going to you're going to age you're going to get old things are going to change and so you you know you just can't stop it and brother Brown that's what he's showing every seven years you're going through a cycle of change in your life and I've found that to be true and if you really watch and study it out you'll see that that is so true and then seven times seven he said now that's a complete change it's usually about that time that a woman is going through the the change of life and you can even tie this back to the scripture because in the scripture amen every seven years God had provided a grace to the children of Israel amen and he had something was called the year of release that would happen after every seven years amen you know what that was amen that every seven years was like an A A an amateure Jubilee to the children of Israel amen but that was the grace of God making provision for them amen that even though if they got in a in a condition of slavery or a condition of bondage God made sure he made a way they didn't have to stay there hallelujah amen I'm glad to know this amen this morning amen I don't know what kind of season you're in in your life but I know this amen we all amen you're either going in a trial or you're in the middle of it now or you just come out of one amen but no matter where you're at I can tell you this it won't last forever hallelujah amen you might be in a struggle you might be in a season of Oppression amen but God has provided a Grace hallelujah amen there is a time of release amen and the Jubilee when that Jubilee trumpet sounded that was the grace of God sounding Out amen letting his children know I'll not leave you in bondage I'll not leave you a slave I'll not leave you in oppression amen but in every trial I've made a way of [Applause] Escape what is this showing us amen these things are temporary amen amen if you're in a season amen don't worry it's going to change because Seasons continually change so brother Brown's talking about that and how the cycles of every seven years amen our lives change he brings it to that seven sevens and by the time you hit 50 you know in in that season of life he said it gets real hard that's right he said and he said you know we all go through that and we must remember that it's it it it's that it's things that we must bear with one another and understand those things I I want to just tell you this because I don't know you know I don't know about all y'all problems I don't know what goes on in this church I really don't I don't you know I don't know but I know enough to know this you're going through something and I know that there's been a lot of changes in this church yes and through the years you've moved from you know different buildings and and there's been a lot of changes new people come and and I can I I I know this by experience been pastoring about 12 years now and you know went into little church there and started pastoring and people started coming you know other things was happening in the area and you know um with other churches and you know I'm not to say anything negative about anybody or anything like that but there was just situations and and people needed a place to go and people started coming to church and and you think man ain't that wonderful the church is growing bless God you know everything's wonderful but you found out that it's not always that way Hallelujah because you know when you're growing there's something that's called growing pains and Things become a struggle and new people come in and and older people are are beginning to feel pushed to the side and people are feeling like they're losing their value and and and and I find that in in even in the in the natural course of life you take a mother and her children begin to grow up and she has dedicated her whole life a real mama and she's been a real mother in the home and she's raised them children and she's gave her whole life to them children and as they grow up and leave the house and and they're going out on their own that that little mama she'll begin to she'll begin to feel like she's losing her her uh purpose in life she'll begin to feel like that you know I'm not important any I'm not needed nobody needs me amen I don't have no purpose because amen all she ever knew and all she had ever done was was give her life to raising her children and being a mother and and things of that of that nature amen but but but see what they got to realize is is things are changing amen but they're just as valuable amen they're just as valuable in their position if they can find their position listen listen I I've seen it so many times through the years amen older people in the church as young people come in and and and and you know and they're talented and they got a lot of zeal and a lot of energy and they're willing to work and to do and amen and all of a sudden the older people begin to feel pushed aside and and they feel like well I'm not needed and you know I'm not valuable but listen for somebody's got to be a pillar in the church somebody has got to take that position amen as others go over and cross the river and go over into glory amen somebody's got to be the old oak tree that gives shade and amen somebody's got to be that tie that that strong tie post that that one that we can look to as an example amen so I want to tell every person in this church you're important and you're needed and you got a a value amen you got a position amen and the Church of the Living God is not the same without you that's right but you see as you as we're going through this you know brother Brown talk about a lady I've messed up big time I don't know once I preach long enough you know and I've already I mess up again cuz I said I ain't saying nothing about time in this church I will not be the next Matt [Applause] Watkins so here I am but when I've preached long enough y'all just let me know but you know brother Brown talks about he talked about a lady that come to him one time and she was had been struggling and she went down to a a place and they you know a and they told her she had seven devils and then another person told her she only had five yeah and she wanted to know where the other two went poor woman went Plum gone she nearly just you know almost completely out of her mind sit in the room taking her stockings off and pulled up her feet in the chair and said I ain't ate nothing for several days and I'm not going to eat till I find out what become of those Devils said what are they I said I don't know I never know nothing about it said well one Minister told me I had seven other lady said I had five and and and and she and brother Brown just begin to speak to her amen and he said listen lady he said you come from St Louis she said yes how'd you know it I said your husband's on the police force that's right I said you used to be a lovely housekeeper she said that's right I said recently your house looks like a hog pin I thought man the holy spirit's bold amen she said that's right I said your daughter's over there now taking care of your husband she said that's right who

life and he's telling her these things amen and they told you to come to me yes that's right she said and she said how did you know that I said the holy spirit said so and I said you you ain't got no Devils to begin with she said I haven't I said no lady surely you know your mother went through menopause and it's just menopause it's something natural I said what do you think those hormone shots were for she said I don't know I said it's for the change of life and that's what it is it's not a devil at all it's just your your condition of life and she began to relax my wife was cooking some bacon and eggs and she began to look through the house she said I I feel kind of hungry and she went over there and ate three eggs and a bunch of toast and two cups of coffee and a lot of jelly and she was just as happy as she could be she said brother Bram are you going to pray and for me and cast it away I said cast it away there ain't nothing to Cast Away she said well I never felt so good in my life what must I do I said go straight home Amen to your house and cook your H husband a nice big apple pie amen amen and when he comes home tonight you throw both arms around him and kiss him and sit down amen and tell him you love him like a lady off to that's exactly right amen see amen he said it ain't the pouring of the oil and the stomping and the kicking amen it wasn't that's like listen she didn't need nobody to lay hands on her amen the prophet of God said it was the truth that set her free Hallelujah it was the truth that set her free she went there thinking she had a devil when she was just going through a change and I want to tell you something friends amen a lot of times there's things that come in the church and amen and the church gets a little bit under stress and there's a struggle amen because you're going through a change and if you ain't real careful the devil will come right there and he'll say oh the anointing is gone and amen we've lost our Revival and the church ain't what it used to be and amen and you'll be looking back to the good old days and everybody be telling you oh some something's wrong and the spirit is left and the devil's come in amen when all it is really it's just a change it's just a cycle amen it's just something you're going through Hallelujah and if you can recognize that and believe in your heart amen whether in the good times or in the bad times when I feel God or if I don't feel God when I feel like it or I don't feel like it he's still God hallelujah let me tell the the devil this morning amen this bride has not lost your anointing Hallelujah this message has not lost its power amen we have not lost our Revival no sir amen we're just going through a change and sometimes it's a struggle and sometimes amen amen there's all kind of things that attacks us and we go through things amen but I want to tell you amen it ain't a devil let the truth set you free this morning hallelujah hallelujah recognizing your day in his message he says see it's a time of recognition recognize you got to recognize and the world has recognized Nations have recognized science has recognized the devil has recognized he's recognized listen to what brother Brown said Satan has recognized that it's a time that he can wreck women that he can wreck the church that he can wreck the people he's recognized it because Satan is an opportunist I tell you something he hits you when you're down Satan knows just when to come to you amen that's why amen listen he can recognize amen when a when a when a when a sister is going through that time in her life you watch The Devil come and begin to attack see he be come right there and begin to attack even a brother the same way watch a church you guys know all about it you build a church that's stress it's like it's like trying to remodel a house and live in it and and maintain your marriage amen I don't know if y'all some of y'all maybe never uh yeah he said be careful I better be careful I built two houses amen and and then we built a church amen but I know by experience that that br stress because there's everybody's got an opinion and everybody's you know and and everybody wants to be recognized and oh we could go on and on and on but it brings stress but watch that's just that's just Humanity that's just being human until the Devil comes and attaches himself to that and a spirit starts working and what was just a little disagreement over an opinion of color or or or where wall should be or the kind of lights or whatever is going on Amen then the spirit comes in and that little division right there amen Satan will attach himself to it are you are you following what I'm saying listen friends I tell you what we got to do we we need to recognize Satan and his tactics I've asked my church at home before I said listen how long are we going to keep allowing the Devil to come in Among Us and divide us how long are we going to keep allowing Satan Amen to come in among families and stir up trouble in the church listen friend we are the sons and daughters of the most high God Amen and we have the authority as the sons of God Amen to put the devil in his place Hallelujah and real overcoming is this is recognizing Satan and all his tactics the first thing we need to do is realize this is the devil another lady comes up in a prayer line brother and brother Brown says now lady I suppose you and I are strangers he said I want you to look uh you to look uh to me just a moment not that I'm reading your mind ma'am he said no I'm not I'm just trying to contact your spirit he said yes he said that's very scary they it's it's you get real nervous spells see I seen you drop a dish or something another and he said try and um he said or or or or in your hand you just couldn't hold it there is that isn't that right yes I see you stand by the sink there and place your the place where you turn around to go to your right and the chair was behind you and you kind of staggered over it let me stop here and say something this ain't guess workor this is not somebody uh standing up and saying well somebody in here's got heart trouble or somebody somebody in this church has got a backache anybody can do that friends but look at it that the prophet of God is telling her where you're standing at the sink you drop a plate I see something you turn to your right you stagger over a chair look at the details of what he's saying here listen this is God speaking he said you have uh he said you're very he said I'm sorry he said I see you uh setting around a a whole lot of the time looking out of window kind of like it was dreary weary look that's right what that is Lady it's a time of life for you see it's menopause a change of life he said come here do you believe Jesus Christ can take that from you will you submit yourself to him that's a horrible Spirit just haunts you amen see this is a mixed audience but look amen just since you've been a little girl every every time he's talking about her normal uh cycle of her life there you get a funny feeling and this whole change amen is where the life and Satan is there also see Satan is there also and now right in the middle of this change when it's the worst of all satan would run you insane if he could but God's going to take it off of you Hallelujah and he's going to make you well amen he said now kind heavenly father in the name of Jesus Christ amen may this demon leave this woman and may she walk through the Shadows without fear in her heart leave her and come out of her in Jesus name and then he turns to the sister and says now my sister you can go home and be normal and feel all right now it's all gone for you amen why amen he said you're calm now you're well now go home and be all right because God has made you well amen listen amen listen I love that because it shows amen that that that Satan had recognized opportunity Amen to come and attach himself to a natural condition that this woman was going through a cycle of the change in her life but Satan was going to take advantage of that opportunity but brother she come to the right place at the right time hallelujah amen and Jesus Christ amen delivered her of the oppression oh hallelujah amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen you say but brother I'm not living in the days of brother Brenham listen friends amen William Brenham might not be here this morning but the God that he served the God that was in him the god that knew the secrets of the heart amen the god that set the captive free he is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah he can still heal he can still deliver Hallelujah he can still change a heart change a [Applause] life Lord you know brother brand would even encourage the husbands he says at the time he said that your wife is going through that he said if she was ever your sweetheart he said you let her be then hallelujah see you got to have patience and and and and and and compassion and understanding and I got a thinking about that and I thought about you know even back home my own church you know and I thought about all the changes that's going that that's happened in that church and sometimes it gets frustrating I'm just being honest sometimes it's been frustrating as a pastor it's been very frustrating and you know and and and you know in dealing with the complaints and you know there's been times I felt like I was Pastor in three different churches at one time in one building amen but you know you just get real frustrated and you're and and you're dealing with all these situations and it's easy in that frustration to even uh you know lash out and and and things like that but then I begin to read something like this and the prophet says see when when if you're a husband amen amen you got to be you got to have compassion understanding and amen and and be patient and I got to thinking about I thought oh God I'm thankful that God is patient with me amen when I'm going through my struggles amen when I'm I'm going through the hard times and the disappointing and the discouraging times and amen when I don't feel like a Christian how many how many's glad that God even didn't throw you away how many's glad that God Amen just because he was going through a struggle amen and a hard time and and you got a little discouraged and depressed amen I'm glad that God didn't just throw us to the side and look for another amen but he have patience and understanding and compassion and love and mercy and Grace but see we're going through these Cycles these changes he said let's think of brother BR I'm just going to read a quote to you out of uh the testimony of a true witness he said let's just think of a tree the fall of the year when the Autumn time is is here now when a when a we we take a leaf and that's that's like a a life and we are if we're born again we are a leaf on the tree of life and the tree uh that we see out here in the Woods the life finally leaves and pulls away from that leaf because the season is over for the leaf and the leav of uh of uh the leaves will begin to fall and drop down when the life leaves it see and we're real sure of that we look amen from every window now amen and the Le he's in this is in the fall of the year amen they'll begin to drop he said now that's the body we bury amen but that life that was in that leaf goes back down to where it comes from down there through the tree Amen to the root and it remains there in the root of the tree until another season see for this season the sun is rocked away from or or the Earth is rocked away from the Sun and it's following in its orbit and it goes around amen way away and the cold weather is headed down to the Earth therefore the root holds that life of that leaf until the Earth rocks back around again and then there's no way to ever hide that leaf from coming back it'll come back just as sure as the sun comes back it'll come back amen but it has to wait for another season before it comes back and today that gives us a great testimony as a witness of God of creation amen because that's when we are uh we are in the season of mortal life see right now we're in the season of mortal life raising our children marrying and bringing forth families amen this is a life amen or the season of mortal life amen but when we have been born of above amen when that body returns turns to the dust from where it come and the spirit goes amen for where it come goes up Amen to where it come from Amen to God who gave it amen there will come another season and that season that will come will be the immortal season and when the Son of God Rises with healing in his wings amen it'll be totally impossible to hold those body in the ground any longer they'll come forth in the brightness of the Son of God very nature itself testifies of that if we're Christians and we're born of the spirit death can't hold nothing but victory for us hallelujah because these old corruptible bodies amen Satan still has power over that will drop into dust of the earth amen but when the season Hallelujah this is the wrong season now it's mortal season but when the immortal season is coming when the immortal one comes he will bring with him the immortal Spirits amen that has returned to him from the earth and they shall come forth again in the resurrection for the great Millennium and shall shall Shine for His Glory Hallelujah how many's looking forward to that season this is the season of mortal life but there's another season coming is that right oh yes sir amen amen and we know amen that we're entering into that season now amen let me just say it this way amen amen you know one season don't abruptly end and another one begin amen but there's a a blending of the seasons amen if you're following me amen you know we're not waiting Amen to just for the date marked on the calendar to declare that winter has arrived amen we know it's coming amen because we feel a change in the atmosphere but listen re in just a few days amen amen there's going to be another change and one of them mornings you're going to be sitting on your porch drinking a cup of coffee and you just feel a change in the atmosphere hallelujah amen in about the afternoon a warm breeze will blow by amen and you know then it won't be long amen Spring's going to be here amen because you're feeling the effects of the change the season is changing oh Hallelujah and let me tell you I'm already feeling the effects of the change of a season I feel the warm breezes blowing of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the mortal season is coming to an end Immortal season amen is on the way Hallelujah and it don't matter what you do to try to stop it you can never stop the change Hallelujah let me just tell the devil something this morning devil you come too late to stop the change of my body because my heart's been changed H my soul's been changed hallelujah amen my mind's been changed my speech has been changed Hallelujah and the change has already started on the inside you can't stop this Rapture no more than you can stop your children from growing up are you hearing me you can't stop this rapture listen friends amen I'm going to take the negative and make it so positive amen just like you can't stop amen your hair from turning gray oh I know there's things you can do but amen listen friends it'll never hold amen amen but you can't stop from getting weak and you can't stop your shoulders from dropping and you can't stop all those kind it's just a natural thing that's taking place amen but on the inside Hallelujah there's a change that's already started and the devil can't stop it Hallelujah can I reach back to last night and pick up something listen because we're in the season amen amen this is spiritual food and new season and the season is now let me tell you something Church there was a time amen that the Mysteries was sealed up and Daniel was told don't write it and John was told don't write it amen seal up those things amen seal up the things that the seventh Thunder said seal it up there was a time that it was sealed up but the Bible says amen that the time has come and you go read over in Revelations 10 a mighty Angel comes down out of heaven with a book in his hand and that book is open Hallelujah amen and he said time will be no more or the delay amen has come to an end there'll be no more delay Hallelujah he is tearing and he's waiting and it's been kept a secret because it wasn't a time it wasn't the season amen but this is the season not of the ceing but of the revealing Hallelujah and the word is open yes hallelujah amen and what is it telling us amen we're coming into another season because remember John is your type and John was standing in Revelations 5 and he was weeping John had his weeping season because no man was found worthy to take the book and loose the seals thereof amen people that pondered and pondered and amen why was John crying oh he was crying cuz he couldn't do it or he was crying for this reason amen but the prophet of God comes and said oh no John knew that all was lost except somebody Hallelujah could take that book amen but was John was standing there weeping amen a voice Cried Out amen weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed Hallelujah he's wrestled with and over come Hallelujah and he took the book and Loos the seals and when John saw that book come open glory to God his weeping season come to an end Hallelujah and the man that was weeping begin to [Music] Rejoice hallelujah amen and everything that was in heaven everything on the earth everything beneath the Earth heard John giving glory and honor to the Lamb of God hallelujah he saw his name in the [Applause] book hallelujah amen and it changes heart from weeping to [Applause] rejoicing thank you Lord I show it to you in the scripture another place there two boys walking down the road one day amen and they had sad Hearts the Bible say they were slow of heart Jesus said they were slow fools in slow of heart listen their hearts were sad because the events that was taking place and the circumstances had thrown them into a depression and they were walking discouraged defeated yeah amen downhearted amen with slow sad Hearts but a man Drew near and the Bible said Jesus appeared to them in another form and beginning at Moses what did he do he opened the book and he begin to break the scripture and he begin to reveal who he was out of the word listen friends I want to tell you something the events didn't change the circumstances didn't change the only thing that changed was their understanding because modern events amen become clear by prophecy glory to God Amen and their slow sad hearts become glad amen at the end of the day after they had walked with Jesus and their eyes was open amen this was their testimony did not our hearts burn Hallelujah amen as he talked with us along the way I tell you amen we don't need a change of events amen if you're look at at world events from a natural perspective it'll bring gloom and doom and disappointment and failure amen but I tell you what if you walk with Jesus a little while and let him break the scripture to your heart your slow heart your sad heart will become a Burning Heart hallelujah amen and your weeping days will end Hallelujah and you as John will begin to [Applause] Rejoice it's the season now church I want to tell you you say brother what's all the excitement about what's all the shouting about what's all that rejoicing about I tell you what it's about amen this is the hour this is the time the word has been revealed this is a time for King lamb worship Hallelujah this is a time that everything in heaven everything on Earth Hallelujah let the Angels Rejoice let the children Rejoice let the old man Rejoice let the old Mage Rejoice Let The Strangers in our gates Rejoice Hallelujah the lamb has took the buck he has he has prevailed the seals is off the secret is out the Myster is made known it's the season of [Music] change not tell I tell you what I love about it I tell you what I love about it don't matter what season you're in as an individual it don't matter what you're going through as a church come on church amen in your good days in your bad days if you're sick if you're well if you're old if you're young it don't matter what season you're in this is a season for the Rapture I feel good this morning when the Rapture when when brother when the change of this body happens some of us are going to be old and some of us are going to be young and some of us are going to be sick and some of us are going to be well but when it happens it don't matter it don't matter what your personal season is his season will override your season Hallelujah and you might be laying on a sick bed one moment and the next moment you're standing in a new body GL to God you might be oppressed you might be discouraged amen barely making it to church but all of a sudden a sweep sweep over Hallelujah the season [Applause] changed Hallelujah church I'm telling you this is a time God appointed a time right amen listen he made an appointment with Sarah one day and he said I'm going to visit you according to the time of life I got to read I got to reading that one day and I thought you know what amen God made an appointment with Sarah to change your body and then I I remember something brother Brown said Jesus keeps all his appointments hallelujah amen oh I love that amen because he's made an appointment with us and he's going to keep it and not the appointed time according to the time of life he visited Sarah amen listen friends and I tell you what their their conditions got worse do you imagine God gave Abraham a promise and nothing changed for the better except amen the faith he had in his heart cuz Abraham got older and Sarah got older and they conditions got worse and their bodies got worse is that right amen but you know what I love about the Lord God never changed or adjusted his promise because of their condition God didn't change his word because of their condition by the way they couldn't do it at their best amen even at their very best they couldn't produce it but yet God promised it you know what it tells me brother if God made you a promise he is obligated to make a way to fulfill it and I'm going I want to let you know he'll move Heaven and Earth amen and listen brother Bron even says he said listen they couldn't do it in the bodies they were in God had promised them a son and they couldn't produ it in the bodies they were in amen so instead of God changes his word to match their body he changed their body to match his word hallelujah and let me just say this this morning amen God is not going to change his word to match our conditions amen he's going to change our bodies to match his word hallelujah friends it's not a fairy tale amen this ain't a Walt Disney story amen this is a reality of the word of God we shall be changed Hallelujah and we're in the season of it now I'm going to close right here I ain't got no idea about time amen but I'm going to tell I want to just show you something I got this all right praise God I was I was studying everybody everybody studied the message countdown right and brother Brandon will take and he'll parallel scientific achievement with uh spiritual achievement right and he shows he brings it right through the church and I'm not going to go through the whole message but but I was I was looking at you know how brother Brown would make the parallel with transportation and he shows how the man had moved from the horse and buggy to the automobile to the airplane to the astronaut age and I was studying that a while back and I and I was studying the how and I just got a thinking and you know science is always changing advancing technology is continuing to advance all the time you can't even hardly keep up with it and the phone you buy today it'll be obsolete tomorrow don't worry but you know and all as it advances and and as I got to studying that I run across an article and they said that by the year 2050 humans could outlive the constraints of the physical body this is actual article I'm reading to you says undoubtedly we are currently experiencing an age of shift of technology and advancements breakthroughs are emerging in fields such as AI uh uh uh which is artificial intelligence and it says that and nanotechnologies and and just in the past decade we have witnessed remarkable progress in science bringing us closer to a future where artificial intelligence will be present everywhere in our daily lives we are currently facing the possibility this is from a different article listen to this we are currently facing the possibility of achieve of achieving immortality for humans by 2030 this prediction comes from renowned uh uh scientists and futurists who who have history of making accurate predictions he anticipates that the ongoing progress in genetics robotics nanotechnology will soon have Nanobots that we will soon have Nanobots cursing through our bloodstream dream and which would en enable us to live forever see it's truly remarkable to consider that this could be a reality within just seven years this was in 2023 that this was wrote in just seven years and it says amen that that that in just in that short period of time that humans could reach immortality but you got to understand they're not talking about that you could just live forever in the body that you're in see even they understand that these bodies have absolute limitations in other words they could say with all the advancement of Med medical science and all the medicine they could give you and if you you know followed their instructions and done the correct exercise and ate the right things and drank the right things eventually your body's just going to wear out and they said that they believe that a man could could live up to maybe 150 years and even in the near future amen that humans could live you know reach that threshold of 150 years uh if they would follow these instructions and and live you know clean and eat clean and and and and and you know uh go to the doctor on regular basis and and these things that man could live up to 150 years but but these bodies have absolute limitation I got to reading this article and I thought man amen this is so powerful because science is now talking about immortality amen being in the reach of humanity within the next seven years amen but listen and but yet they know that you can't do it in this body Hallelujah and they also know that it would take a higher intelligence Amen to take us into that immortality and I got to thinking about that and I thought you know what Amen in the parallel Amen in the same thought of brother Brandon parallel and the scientific achievement with a spiritual a achievement where are we at this morning church how close if science is declaring amen that we can experience immortality in the next seven years you know what they're really trying to do amen by Ai and Nanobots and so forth they're trying to capture the real you so that they can transport that into another body so that you can continue to live amen listen and if they're amen they're beginning to say it's within our reach now amen we're almost there what about you and I this morning if science is that close how close are we Hallelujah I say if science is that close I tell you what amen my expectation ain't in seven years it might happen it could happen in the morning Hallelujah you say brother what do you say I'm telling you this we may never see 2024 amen but I tell you what if it don't happen tomorrow I'll look for it the next day and if it don't happen then I'll be looking for it the next day amen because I got a promise and this is a season of change and it's already started and all the devils in hell can't stop it Hallelujah no more than you can stop the Sun from coming up in the morning no more than you can stop the changes amen of the seasons amen and you will never stop the Rapture and the resurrection it's in progress now Hallelujah let's stand our feet amen give God the praise this morning Hallelujah this is your season this is your time Hallelujah this is is our hour amen the season of our change has come oh blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Hallelujah can we just bow our hearts
