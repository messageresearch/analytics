[Music] located in North Louisiana evening light Tabernacle has always helped forth the scripture that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever today we invite you to delve into the scripture with us as the ministry discusses God's truth in our day hello everyone we are back again the ministry team at evening light tabernacle Minden Louisiana we are Bible believing Church that proclaiming Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever proclaiming to God to the world and living God and happy that you've joined us today for this discussion we ended the the last discussion on that Jesus is seeking for worshipers who worship humans sincerity and truth and how that Jesus proclaimed if you hold to my teaching you are really my disciples and then you will know the truth and the truth shall set you free so today we're going to search for our answers in the Bible and Jesus referred to the Bible with complete confidence to his accuracy and his authority so he said for us to search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life they are they to testify of me so all scripture then is is given to us of God do you think the Apostles considered the words that they were speaking with Scripture such as the Apostle Paul is noted that Peter referred to Paul's writings as as scriptures and they do pervert Paul's writings as they do the other scriptures and so they knew that Paul was vindicated and Paul even said that the revelation that he received was not of man but it came from God and he said if an angel preach anything else than what he had already let him be accursed oh so then we then have to go back to Paul's gospel or we're cursed it's exactly correct strong language but didn't call to use that kind of language they said if an an angel came from heaven preaching any other guys or he said I can't change what I said so the Word of God is unchangeable a manner and so we cannot compromise on it if it was true then it's too nice for the histories even say that when Paul after he'd came out from his tutelage or whatnot when he came to Peter that the two of them saw eye-to-eye on doctor you know they were seeing the very same thing so it shows that God doesn't change he's not a god this way to one man under God this way to another they were absolutely in agreement on their doctrine and we know that God used Paul to actually write down almost the entire New Testament to found his church that's where we go back to it if anybody comes and preach another gospel than what I preached let him be accursed because you know Paul was vindicated by God yes to be the instrument by which he used to found the church I think his tutelage that you speak of was a backside of the desert or that you know that in Arabia for three years that he's sat comparing the scripture and and searching descriptors and I think as believers today we have a responsibility to search the Scriptures to see whether or not we are really teaching the teachings of Jesus amen it's important for each and every person in the church to do the same thing not just to swallow down what's coming over the pulpits because a lot of times what we find is there there's a man-made Jesus being preached many times and it's an it's a new Jesus is not the the scripture or is not the Jesus of the scripture you know because you find things that are preached that don't line up with what Paul taught you find things that are freaks that don't line up with the scripture so even though they're claiming is Jesus it's not the Jesus of the Bible but if the people would dig in the scripture and study and search and pray they wouldn't be so easily deceived or led astray because it's right there clearly for them for each Christian in red lettering Jesus said search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they were they that testify of me and when Paul wrote the New Testament he referred to the Old Testament over three hundred times and so he was a word prophet it was established in continuity with the Old Testament giving birth to the New Testament and him again speaking in Hebrews 13:8 he said Jesus Christ the same and I believe that's a powerful word you know it's the same so anytime Jesus has changed he don't change right so he's only changed by man you can own you know and then it goes what brother Aaron is saying it becomes a Jesus of their own making their own believe that fits that fits what they want to believe instead of them changing to fit him him so when it says the same what follows that yesterday yesterday today and forever so is today covered in that statement absolutely so it has to be the same forever as it was the day that scripture was written that's right well you know it's striking to me if not a million books that are written on one book interpreting the Bible and so you know bookstores are full of men's ideas and this man's ideas and that one in commentaries and this and that all the Holy Scriptures and you know again I think that it's important that we come back to the foundation of the church for the church the Bible said is built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets with Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone so it all begins with Jesus yeah and it's built there upon him in any revelation that is not proclaiming Jesus Christ the same in every detail except for his corporal body is of course see the discrepancy that's right it's possible so that's why with it being built off Jesus Satan tries that he's the cornerstone that's why he wants to change where it starts because if he changed where it starts once it gets down here is a way off that's right exactly but you know when God created the world's the Bible said that he did it by faith in God framed the worlds together and all of the galaxies the Sun the Moon the Stars everything the world hangs in its orbit and and the foundations of God was made by his word we don't have to worry about the Sun rising or setting we don't have to worry about the whole winner it continues the same the earth continues the same and if the foundations of creation is sure then surely the foundation of Christianity must remain sure yeah and the Bible says that Isaiah 28 verse 16 therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion a foundation stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation amen he that believeth shall not make haste or not be ashamed he said in Romans Amen I'm so glad we won't be left to shake but actually there there's a God that backs up his word raising oh man no this is where he said you know in Matthew 16 when he came to Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples whom do men say that I the Son of Man no that's a pretty good question even today because you know someone would say you know wow you're John the Baptist or ones in your Alliance or Jeremiah and then so today we have 41,000 difference one saying of who Jesus is he didn't say that yes that's right and so but he's got to come back to that personal question who do you say that the son of man have and that's where that every person must have for his foundation stone personal revelation of Jesus Christ is that true where he met Christ himself you know you go back as we go back to Peter and Paul and you look at the two of them you have one a scholar you have another an ignorant you had one who persecuted the church you had another who denied Christ but you have one have another room experiences you have another stricken down on the road to Damascus they both had a personal revelation of who Jesus Christ was and after that personal revelation their doctors were the same and their faith was the same a and yet they were undeniable the undeniably be able to just found the church and push the gospel and be used of God Peter was for the Jews Paul for the Gentiles and you see the movement God used him and yet want from two different extremes so it's a piggyback off of that you can't have somebody that has a personal revelation of Jesus Christ and another person have a personal revelation of Jesus Christ and come together and they're doctors not lying up and one have this you know this doctor and one have this doctrine if they both met the same crime exactly they'll have the same revelation of who he is exactly well there's got to be one truth then yes yeah so you know that's one absolute and not still the Word of God and we should as the disciples are those that came from the upper room they were all saying the same thing and believing that the same thing having everything in common with John tells us in the beginning was the word the Word was God and the Word was with God then we find later down that the Word was made flesh yeah where is it made flesh in Jesus Christ so he said he would build a church now this is what he said I will build a church and I'm gonna build it on a rock so what is that rock some people think that rocks Peter the Catholic Church says his Peter a man who denied Christ three times well and the erstwhile doing it yeah his church built on on fickle man who can change with their moods or or be upset or be higher or below I don't believe that he would do that that's because they teach you know the succession of the apostolic succession passing down from Peter to the next Pope to the next and of course then you have ever poked changing what the others said and now you got the Word of God that can be changed by fickle men just whatever we decide and according to the times and I would say that the word no matter whether it's 2019 or what it is that the word is still the same exact and it cannot be changed it is an absolute any absolute is a standard that that has been set that the our faith must be built upon the solid rock of the Word of God Peter gave the right response in Matthew 16:16 you know Jesus asking who do you say that I am in his responses thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and we find that jesus replied to him is because of this revelation I will build my church so really then the ever believer his his revelation or the rock that he's built upon his a revelation personally to him of who Jesus is Jesus Christ made known to him personally straight back and so there again that must be the rock the church is built upon is the rock of Revelation of who Christ is exactly so if we can find out who Jesus is and what he did and then the church that he's set forth and be that church then that would be the would surely that he's coming back without spot or wrinkle there's only one church going in the rapture there's only one church that he's coming back for there's only one church spoke in the bible teacher and in order to be saved we've got to be a part of that church amen yeah I mean that's he said I will build my church not churches amen you know it's not 41,000 churches he's built he's built a church right no revelation are we talking about a church building a certain group of people a certain denomination or we looking at a worldwide body that has come together with the same revelation of who Jesus is that's what it is he's got a body around the world as he said people out of every kindred tongue tribe and nation so um but one thing that really strikes me about that whole conversation with Peter in Jesus he said on this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell you know this is a powerful channel a weak powerless church that is run over and blowed by every wind of doctrine but a powerful church who has the signs of wonders the miraculous power and the life changing by a man because what is what is the healing of the body if there's not really a true healing of the salt that's right it's only temporary soul has changed its changed forever that's right so you know for the individual Christ in you makes you the center of the revelation amen so Christ and you makes him the center of the life of the revelation in Christ and the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of the whole thing wonderful so you know this is something that is very important for us to know that the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you yes and so what is it then is it you join the church shake hands with a preacher decided to live by code of rules are recited decree so what is that new part it's a life that Christ live is now living in you Nathan that's right that's exactly right because as we saw there on the day of Pentecost you know it came in like a rushing mighty wind and tongues of fire was spread across the the people you know and their lives was changed and they begin to do the very works that Jesus did 14:12 your the works that I do shall you do also so now what you had there I say instead of instead of one person Jesus walking around with the power of God you know deliverance setting free you had 120 now just like that because they came not only did they come into his presence his presence came into what's he to me it comes right back to the words of Jesus when he said in his prayer he said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has here that these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes notice who is revealed to babes those who are born again you must be born again and so God has himself from the from the schools of learning from the experts of theology but reveals himself to those that are born again this is where he said to Nicodemus you know you must be born again to be able to understand the kingdom of God so it's a personal individual affair with the person that Christ is revealed to them so in that first church brother Tim the Bible said they were one mind one Accord they spake the same thing because the church and the body when I read the scripture seemed to be the self same thing that the body of Christ is the Church of the Living God and that Christ is the head of his own church that means that it's not organized or led by man moved by men controlled by men but it was controlled by God and him alone Astrea men being led of the Holy Spirit and only the revelation of Christ could make them one and one Accord and speak the same you can't legislate that I think a lot of the misconception today though with people in church joining is it's a church I belong to an assembler a body and they get away from that the truly being the church is an individual that we just talked about it's a personal revelation it's an individual he's coming for an individual it's not a what my church believes it's what I believe is my revelation of who Jesus Christ is so he's not coming for building he's not coming for a group of people that are in a certain building but he is coming for individuals who have truly given their life to Christ and so he says as he said this is the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory Israel so that's what we're going to be speaking about even as we come back to our next session we're going to be talking about how that God refers to this church singular it is not churches he has one church there's one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of assaults and then you know his word is true from the beginning amen and so we want to go back to the beginning thank you for joining with the ministry team at evening
