[46:42] you're here in church today may his holy

[46:57] the healing of sister Lana what a great
[47:00] thing that God did the healing of Jared
[47:03] hey man were God saved him from a life

[47:13] hey man we're not deserving of any of
[47:16] them
[47:16] it's just grace a man his mercy and
[47:19] grace to us so god bless you let some
[47:23] stand together as we read the scripture
[47:25] this morning we're going to read from
[47:27] Isaiah chapter 27 and verse 12 I thought
[47:32] it was very striking to me as I was
[47:37] trying to prepare for service up there
[47:39] in Pennsylvania and actually a couple of
[47:43] services there and I just you know to it
[47:48] throughout my day of just preparing my
[47:52] my thoughts and my attention kept being
[47:56] brought back to this to service here and
[48:00] to speak to you today so I believe that
[48:02] God had this very service in mind before
[48:07] the world began and I believe he knew
[48:10] exactly who would be here who would not
[48:12] be here what the need would be who would
[48:14] listen in who would hear this service
[48:16] and the attitude in which they would
[48:19] hear it and today you know we will speak
[48:22] about some things as we close out the
[48:24] year and you know I you know I'm going
[48:29] to approach this maybe as if this was
[48:32] the last sermon I would ever preach
[48:35] because this is the last sermon that
[48:38] outreach this year and not just a month
[48:42] but the year and so you know I will
[48:46] speak some things to you as a
[48:48] congregation I'll speak some things to
[48:51] those who will listen in to throughout
[48:55] the world where it will be maybe those
[48:57] who will be streaming the service and
[49:00] you know will speak some very direct
[49:02] things and so you know if as we speak
[49:08] and and and maybe as we hear I just pray
[49:12] that the Lord give us wisdom to to say
[49:15] the things that is on our hearts today
[49:17] because I have some very direct things
[49:19] to say as we close out the yeren and I
[49:24] said I'm going to approach this as if
[49:27] this was the last sermon I would ever
[49:29] preach and you know I really think maybe
[49:32] that's the way we ought to approach any
[49:36] any time that we come to serve us
[49:39] because we don't know when this would be
[49:41] the last time we will gather amen and so
[49:46] we ought to approach it with some very
[49:48] great sincerity and dedication in our
[49:51] hearts of children there for a mural
[49:54] background today it's it's maybe not
[49:59] real clear um as you as you look upon it
[50:03] but I don't think this scene is really
[50:06] clear to the naked eye anyway and this
[50:09] is a glimpse into the holiest of holies
[50:12] the veil is being lifted back and the
[50:15] high priest is looking in and it would
[50:19] be here that the priest would go in for
[50:22] for the Day of Atonement where he would
[50:25] bring the atoning blood to put up on the
[50:29] seat of Mercy and today I'm going to be
[50:33] speaking on the call back to the
[50:36] original atonement now it is an a
[50:39] retelling of the sacrifice it is not
[50:43] going back to Calvary again and Jesus
[50:45] dying on the cross again but it is to
[50:49] call back to the original atonement
[50:54] which is the blood life of Jesus Christ
[50:57] and we're going to be speaking about
[51:00] that to call back to the original
[51:02] atonement amen so isaiah 27 in verse 12
[51:08] and it shall come to pass in that day
[51:11] that the lord shall beat off from the
[51:14] channel of the river under the stream of
[51:16] egypt and ye shall be gathered one by
[51:18] one o ye children of israel and it shall
[51:23] come to pass in that day that the great
[51:26] trumpet shall be blown and they shall
[51:29] come which are were ready to perish in
[51:32] the land of assyria and the outcasts in
[51:35] the land of Egypt shall worship the Lord
[51:38] in the holy mount at Jerusalem then I
[51:42] would like to go to Leviticus chapter 23
[51:44] and we'll read from the 24th verse and
[51:47] this is where the day of atonement was
[51:51] established and it says speak unto the
[51:55] children of Israel sayin in the seventh
[51:58] month now we carry that that down you
[52:01] know there were seven feast and we are
[52:04] we are here worshiping under the last
[52:06] feast which is the Feast of Tabernacles
[52:08] where we're about to change our
[52:11] Tabernacles our dwelling place and and
[52:15] of course in this was in the seventh
[52:19] month which again represents seven
[52:21] church ages which we are in the endtime
[52:24] age or the seven churches now in this
[52:28] first day of the month you shall have a
[52:30] Sabbath a memorial of blowing of
[52:35] trumpets and holy convocation and then I
[52:39] would like you to back up to Leviticus
[52:41] chapter 16 we'll read from verse 11
[52:45] there and this is instructions to Aaron
[52:49] the high priest and Aaron shall bring
[52:52] the Bullock of the sin offering which is
[52:55] for himself and shall make an atonement
[52:59] for himself and for his house and shall
[53:01] kill via the Bullock of the sin offering
[53:05] which is for himself and he shall take a
[53:09] sensor full of burning coals of fire
[53:13] from off the altar before the Lord and
[53:16] his hands full of sweet incense beaten
[53:19] small and bring it within the veil and
[53:24] he said put the incense upon the fire
[53:27] before the Lord that the cloud of
[53:29] incense may cover the mercy seat that is
[53:32] upon the testimony that he died not and
[53:36] he shall take the blood of the Bullock
[53:39] and sprinkle it with his finger upon the
[53:42] mercy seat eastward and before the mercy
[53:45] seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with
[53:48] his finger seven times so there would be
[53:52] seven sprinklings of blood which again
[53:56] for us there's blood forever church age
[53:59] a man now then back him back up to
[54:04] Leviticus 16 verse 29 we will read a
[54:08] here or going there Leviticus 16 29 and
[54:12] this shall be a statute for ever unto
[54:15] you that in the seventh month on the
[54:18] tenth day of the month you shall afflict
[54:21] your souls and do no work at all whether
[54:24] it be one of your own country or of a
[54:27] stranger that sojourneth among you for
[54:31] on that day shall the pre
[54:33] make an atonement for you to cleanse you
[54:36] that you may be clean from all your sins
[54:39] before the Lord it shall be a Sabbath of
[54:43] rest unto you and you shall afflict your
[54:46] souls by a statue forever amen god bless
[54:51] you you can have your seats hey man just
[54:54] a little more sound up here brother Tim
[54:57] now as we are approaching this today and
[55:02] as you know we have read about the
[55:04] blowing of the trumpets we have read
[55:07] about the day of atonement and of course
[55:11] the Bible would tell us that these are
[55:14] all types and shadows Paul would say
[55:18] they were written to us for an example
[55:21] so God would actually plan out his work
[55:26] of redemption and then he would play it
[55:29] out through the the Jewish race as he
[55:33] would set up a tabernacle on the earth
[55:35] and and he would type out exactly what
[55:39] he would do at Calvary and his work of
[55:42] atonement now as you notice all of these
[55:47] are in the seventh month of the year
[55:50] which would be actually their day their
[55:56] their fall feast in which there would be
[55:58] the three feasts that would take place
[56:00] which would be the Feast of the trumpets
[56:03] and then the day of atonement and then
[56:06] finally the Feast of Tabernacles now
[56:09] there was also for more feasts before
[56:13] that which was a spring feast which
[56:16] would begin with the Passover and the
[56:18] firstfruits and the unleavened bread and
[56:22] finally Pentecost now this of course
[56:25] would in the fall feast would would
[56:30] began a a time first with the blowing of
[56:33] the trumpets now the trumpet is to call
[56:37] the people to assemble themselves
[56:41] together for something and I'm sharing
[56:43] this from the visas of their trumpets
[56:45] sermon
[56:46] we said sometimes it would announced an
[56:48] important person like in Joseph they
[56:52] sounded the trumpet and Joseph was
[56:55] appearing at a symbol of the great
[56:57] trumpet we'll get after a while in
[56:59] Isaiah that says when the great trumpet
[57:01] sounds when that enzyme will be lifted
[57:05] up up there and there come a time when
[57:07] the great trumpet will be sounded and
[57:10] all the nations will gather to Jerusalem
[57:13] and that's when the man the millennium
[57:15] starts the great trumpet so we know
[57:19] we're right here on the very cusp of
[57:23] this great trumpet as it sounds out
[57:28] throughout the land and of course we
[57:31] know as the trumpet begins to sound for
[57:35] Israel to announce to them the coming of
[57:38] their Joseph their Messiah that at the
[57:42] same time there will be it will call the
[57:45] dead in Christ and they will come forth
[57:48] and and then we will see them and we
[57:51] will be changed in a moment in a
[57:54] twinkling of an eye now what a great
[57:56] promise that is this morning that we
[57:59] have as we know that we're living now
[58:02] not in the springtime
[58:04] where there is Calvary the Passover and
[58:06] the unleavened bread and and the
[58:08] firstfruits of the Resurrection and
[58:10] finally on the Pentecost where it comes
[58:14] to - there the day of Pentecost would
[58:16] which would initiate in the coming of
[58:19] the Holy Ghost but we are here in the
[58:22] hours of the finishing of redemption and
[58:25] so we're we're in the evening time but
[58:28] we could say in this the fall time but
[58:30] yet it's a new beginning um this one
[58:34] because these feasts would also
[58:37] introduce to them a new year where that
[58:41] they would come into a new beginning or
[58:43] a new year and this is a time for a new
[58:47] beginning the time for all the ages to
[58:51] be over and that will take place at the
[58:53] literal translation of the
[58:56] I do Christ not before but when she is
[58:59] literally incorporate chorus corporately
[59:03] changed into immortality there the ages
[59:07] will end then we will be caught up to
[59:10] meet the Lord in the air now so these
[59:13] trumpets though that they're also spoke
[59:16] about in the book of Revelation the
[59:18] blowing of the seven trumpets and these
[59:21] trumpets would sound and their purpose
[59:24] is to gather Israel back to their
[59:28] homeland now I want you to remember that
[59:31] we've got actually two things happen
[59:33] that it wants we have God dealing with
[59:36] the Gentiles and finishing up their
[59:38] Redemption we have then God in his
[59:43] beginnings of gather in Israel back to
[59:45] her homeland and then um initiating
[59:50] redemption or bringing Redemption to
[59:52] them and sealing in the 144,000 for them
[59:56] so you see God's doing two things in the
[59:59] end time he's dealing with Abraham's
[1:00:02] seed both the literal seed or the
[1:00:05] natural seed and the spiritual seed the
[1:00:08] royal seed of Abraham so he's doing he's
[1:00:12] doing two things at once and and we got
[1:00:15] to realize then what is our message and
[1:00:17] what isn't our message or else we try to
[1:00:20] become something or try to apply
[1:00:22] something to our lives that we're not
[1:00:24] you see and so again the trumpets sound
[1:00:28] to gather Israel back to their homeland
[1:00:31] and notice it is the call back to the
[1:00:35] atonement they're there come to back to
[1:00:38] they to God for reconciliation now this
[1:00:44] again as I said would bring in a new
[1:00:46] year for them the new beginning and the
[1:00:49] day of atonement was a gracious day for
[1:00:51] Israel each year were they could
[1:00:54] experience a new beginning by being
[1:00:56] cleanse from their sins and restored to
[1:01:01] fellowship with their maker whoa what a
[1:01:04] day that's going to be for Israel when
[1:01:07] that day will be
[1:01:09] from their sins of rejecting the Messiah
[1:01:12] and turning down the Word of God and
[1:01:16] then restored it back to fellowship with
[1:01:19] their maker it reminds us is reminiscent
[1:01:24] of the time of Joseph you know when he
[1:01:26] was rejected by his brethren sold out
[1:01:29] into Egypt and and then well then of
[1:01:32] course comes into power raised up from
[1:01:34] the pit and sat at the right hand of
[1:01:37] Pharaoh there and there on all of them
[1:01:42] his brethren would come and bow down
[1:01:44] before him and yet he was provided for
[1:01:48] them while all along the way until the
[1:01:50] day he finally makes his up known to his
[1:01:54] brother don't you know that's quite an
[1:01:57] our church where that God has been
[1:02:00] waiting a long time to call his brethren
[1:02:04] in and say I am Joseph I am Jesus that
[1:02:09] you crucified but it was done to save
[1:02:11] libel look at all of these that got
[1:02:14] redeemed because of what happened to me
[1:02:18] at Calvary I gave my life it was for
[1:02:21] your good what a day that's gonna be hey
[1:02:26] man now on this day shall the atonement
[1:02:29] be made for you he said in the Book of
[1:02:32] Leviticus to cleanse you from all your
[1:02:35] sins you shall be clean before the Lord
[1:02:39] oh what a day of atonement what a day
[1:02:43] now notice it's not gonna be that wreak
[1:02:46] ihling of the sacrifice it's not even on
[1:02:49] gonna be offering another sacrifice that
[1:02:52] lamb is sufficient a man that lambs
[1:02:56] blood is sufficient we're talking about
[1:02:58] the Lamb of God come on I mean it's not
[1:03:01] going to be offered a new lamb or bring
[1:03:04] it into a new worship but it's going to
[1:03:07] be changing their attitude toward who
[1:03:10] that the atonement that's already been
[1:03:12] given hallelujah well if they will
[1:03:16] recognize their Messiah now this day of
[1:03:20] atonement is one of the most
[1:03:22] solemn and important holy day on the
[1:03:25] Jewish calendar and it was the day where
[1:03:28] the high priest would go in beyond the
[1:03:32] veil and he would he would make an
[1:03:35] atoning sacrifice for the sins of the
[1:03:38] people and this this act of atonement
[1:03:41] would bring a reconciliation between God
[1:03:46] and His people now the call of the
[1:03:49] trumpets which precedes the day of
[1:03:52] atonement was to bring Israel true this
[1:03:56] time of atonement was a time of
[1:03:58] gathering together now remember there is
[1:04:02] another gathering that is going on with
[1:04:04] thee with the royal seed of Abraham and
[1:04:08] are gathered together of course is unto
[1:04:11] Christ is not to one church or one
[1:04:14] denomination or one little theory or
[1:04:16] this or that
[1:04:17] it's a gathered together under Christ a
[1:04:20] man that no matter where you are you
[1:04:23] don't have to belong to evening like
[1:04:25] Tabernacle you don't have to go to
[1:04:27] church here you may never have ducked in
[1:04:29] the doors of this place but if you're
[1:04:31] gathered in Christ and then you heard
[1:04:34] the trumpet call and you've been
[1:04:36] gathered into Christ that's what's
[1:04:38] important I gather it isn't a
[1:04:41] personality our gathering isn't to a
[1:04:44] certain preacher a man a certain
[1:04:47] location I'm shattered is under Christ
[1:04:50] and that Christ is the word are you with
[1:04:53] me now when the trumpet sound in this
[1:04:56] last age it was most it was about to
[1:04:59] fold spiritually literally are you with
[1:05:04] me now spiritually there was spirits
[1:05:08] that was released the Bible tells you in
[1:05:10] in Revelation chapter 9 that it was
[1:05:13] released from the from the river
[1:05:15] Euphrates spirits that were bound up and
[1:05:18] held back that was not allowed to be
[1:05:21] released until the end time and that's
[1:05:24] when 300 million demons come out and
[1:05:28] this age is more affected than any other
[1:05:31] age this is where all the same
[1:05:34] of all the ages pound together and heat
[1:05:38] together right here in this in this last
[1:05:41] day this is where all the evil of the
[1:05:44] world comes together this is where all
[1:05:47] the demons of the world are gathered
[1:05:49] together you know what they're gathered
[1:05:51] for one thing they're gathering for you
[1:05:53] so that Satan will become their king and
[1:05:56] he will become king of the earth the
[1:06:00] Bible said he will reign for three and a
[1:06:02] half years while the bride is in glory
[1:06:05] I'm so glad we don't have to be here
[1:06:07] it's bad enough right now ma'am but just
[1:06:11] cheer up the worst is yet to come and a
[1:06:14] man is not going to get any better it's
[1:06:16] going to get worse and worse and darker
[1:06:19] and darker and that's why we need Jesus
[1:06:21] to come back that is our only hope a man
[1:06:26] though I love it to see young people get
[1:06:28] married and make plans for the future
[1:06:30] but I'm telling you friends our real
[1:06:33] future is not on earth I love a new
[1:06:36] marriage her new job or a new this or
[1:06:39] new that I real hope is the coming of
[1:06:42] the Lord Jesus that's got to be our
[1:06:44] focus that's how we gotta live our lives
[1:06:47] as if yes we're our last day on the
[1:06:51] earth because even if he doesn't come in
[1:06:59] a corporal body today he may come for
[1:07:03] you today
[1:07:05] you have no promise on tomorrow not here
[1:07:10] you're only here a short time and it'll
[1:07:15] soon be over it'll be over soon enough
[1:07:19] more quicker than you realize it was
[1:07:24] only yesterday I got married it was only
[1:07:26] yesterday I started preaching it was
[1:07:29] only yesterday it wasn't no time ago
[1:07:35] like that we're about to celebrate this
[1:07:39] will we coming up 50 years for brother
[1:07:42] Jerry's sister Phyllis it's just
[1:07:43] yesterday flash
[1:07:50] you'll all be over it's only what's done
[1:07:56] for Christ is what's gonna last I'll
[1:08:00] tell you this if there ever was a time
[1:08:01] to put your whole heart into this to put
[1:08:05] away your lukewarmness to have a passion
[1:08:08] for truth a man to live your life for
[1:08:11] Christ and therefore living for others
[1:08:14] how important to see us now as I said
[1:08:19] all of these spirits were released
[1:08:22] it was released against naturally
[1:08:25] against the seed of Abraham there that
[1:08:29] the Jews and and then drove them from
[1:08:32] the places from their comfort zones from
[1:08:35] their places and Germany and Poland and
[1:08:38] Russia and wherever they were in the
[1:08:41] world and put a burning seal in their
[1:08:45] heart we gotta have a homeland there's
[1:08:50] gotta be a place for for the Jews and it
[1:08:54] puts something in their heart and they
[1:08:56] realized this ain't our homeland and the
[1:08:59] same thing happened spirits leader some
[1:09:01] of you spiritual Israel you were sitting
[1:09:04] there comfortable in the denomination
[1:09:07] that you were in but there was something
[1:09:09] driving in your heart I've gotta get to
[1:09:12] homeland I've got to find the place
[1:09:14] where the Bible is freeze where the Word
[1:09:17] of God is true where there can be
[1:09:19] healings and miracles and signs and
[1:09:22] wonders and real salvation something
[1:09:25] that works we got to have some reality
[1:09:30] we gotta have something that is real and
[1:09:33] you see we we were we were driven here
[1:09:38] I don't know about you but that's why I
[1:09:40] feel I'm driven to this place and driven
[1:09:44] to this Bible to this world of God hey
[1:09:48] man now so why why was it all what was
[1:09:55] all this about it was to drive them back
[1:10:00] to Israel to the homeland where that the
[1:10:05] Messiah could be revealed to them are
[1:10:07] you with me and so that day could come
[1:10:11] back to the original atonement now
[1:10:15] that's the whole purpose of the whole
[1:10:17] thing and that's a very purpose we are
[1:10:19] here we are not here to have a nice
[1:10:22] church and I have a little something
[1:10:24] different from everybody else and a
[1:10:26] little different belief from anybody
[1:10:28] else or to have another denomination
[1:10:31] forming a new denomination that's not
[1:10:33] why we're here
[1:10:34] we're here to see the Messiah we are
[1:10:38] here to crown him Lord of lords King of
[1:10:41] Kings man that the headship would be
[1:10:44] Christ amen that we wouldn't be ruled
[1:10:46] over by a pope or a bishop
[1:10:48] remember we be ruled over by the Word of
[1:10:52] God that's the longing that's in the
[1:10:58] heart now just sharing this quote from
[1:11:03] Feast of the trumpets he said now here
[1:11:06] is a calling out time at the sixth seal
[1:11:09] when it's opened the persecution struck
[1:11:12] the Jews in the little standpoint and
[1:11:15] here comes a persecution to the church
[1:11:19] in the ecclesiastical from the
[1:11:21] standpoint because the bride has already
[1:11:24] called the Sabbath's are over and ready
[1:11:27] for the Jews to to be called wear to the
[1:11:30] feast of atonement in other words we've
[1:11:32] decided being over we've reached the
[1:11:34] last church age hey man we're at the end
[1:11:38] of it and we're ready now for the Jews
[1:11:41] and then the gospel of the to turn back
[1:11:43] to the Jews and that they can be called
[1:11:46] to the feast of atonement what to
[1:11:50] recognize the atonement not the more
[1:11:54] chickens and geese and what they've been
[1:11:56] doing
[1:11:57] but the Lamb of God slain from the
[1:11:59] foundation of the world is was gonna
[1:12:01] know that hey man now the day of
[1:12:08] atonement for Israel will be their time
[1:12:11] the recognition of the atonement
[1:12:13] that was already made by the sacrifice
[1:12:18] of the sin offering Jesus Christ it will
[1:12:22] be a day of mourning and a time of
[1:12:26] recognition of the blood that was shed
[1:12:29] now part of this atoning redemptive work
[1:12:32] of the lamb is the blowing of the ram's
[1:12:35] horn which we preached about last Sunday
[1:12:37] which calls Israel - the day of
[1:12:39] atonement but it also calls us back by
[1:12:43] the last gospel trumpet - to the
[1:12:46] Gentiles the seventh angels message it
[1:12:49] calls us back to the original atonement
[1:12:52] now listen to this again and I'm sharing
[1:12:56] this from Feast of the trumpet this will
[1:12:59] be paragraph 291 where he said now those
[1:13:02] same as the two prophets did the same as
[1:13:05] those two prophets they remember the
[1:13:07] Gentile bride is they have a prophet
[1:13:10] called
[1:13:11] Elijah that is to call them out of their
[1:13:14] traditions the bride just the same as
[1:13:18] these prophets called Jews out of
[1:13:20] Judaism to Christ the atonement and the
[1:13:23] Gentiles already knows the atonement but
[1:13:28] it's to call the bride back to the
[1:13:30] original atonement
[1:13:33] hey man when all were all these seven
[1:13:35] Sabbath's that they've got away from and
[1:13:38] call them back
[1:13:39] it's at the end time listen the seven
[1:13:42] churches messenger the seventh trumpet
[1:13:44] messenger is all prophets and now that's
[1:13:48] right injected is 144,000 calling the
[1:13:52] seal switches to the Gentiles it had to
[1:13:54] be the Gentile so open up to the
[1:13:56] Gentiles to see the Gentile church
[1:13:58] that's all we know that's all we
[1:14:01] listened to what's already past we look
[1:14:03] for Jesus and what he saith is the seals
[1:14:06] has opened up to us our past don't you
[1:14:11] realize the coming of those two prophets
[1:14:14] and their message to Israel will open up
[1:14:20] to them their past
[1:14:22] hey man it'll open to them the Messiah
[1:14:25] that they rejected then their prayer
[1:14:28] that all the sins will them and the
[1:14:30] children and then the whole thing that
[1:14:34] that are the persecution the years old
[1:14:37] church there's not many people that has
[1:14:40] been so persecuted as the Jews we talked
[1:14:43] about in the Great Tribulation I had
[1:14:45] three and a half years of tribulation
[1:14:47] are you with me
[1:14:49] remember when you when you talk about
[1:14:51] the Jews it's been 2,000 years of
[1:14:55] tribulation and the Bible said of that
[1:14:59] day of these Tuesday it will never be
[1:15:02] repeated again there'll never be a time
[1:15:04] of tribulation upon a people for 2,000
[1:15:08] years like the Jews
[1:15:09] okay man it's been a horrible time
[1:15:13] they've been scattered dispersed hated
[1:15:17] despised and would have been
[1:15:19] exterminated but God had a plan there
[1:15:24] were names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:26] are you with me a man that had not been
[1:15:29] manifested upon the earth that was a
[1:15:31] part of his great work of redemption
[1:15:34] that the lamb was not only slain for us
[1:15:38] but was slain for them too now so but
[1:15:46] for us what did the seals do it showed
[1:15:49] us the horse riders it showed us down of
[1:15:51] Christ it showed us how the church got
[1:15:55] dispersed through the denominations
[1:15:57] instead of the nation's and
[1:15:59] denominations it uncovered well you know
[1:16:01] that wasn't what we went through and why
[1:16:04] we are here where we're Ted today but it
[1:16:06] did more than that it emitted more than
[1:16:09] just telling us our history but it
[1:16:12] revealed to us Christ again the same
[1:16:15] Christ that was in the book of Acts the
[1:16:18] same Holy Ghost with the same accent the
[1:16:21] same power now notice I want you to
[1:16:27] notice who it calls us back to the
[1:16:29] original atonement it doesn't call us
[1:16:32] back and say the atonement is over
[1:16:34] it doesn't call us back and say the
[1:16:37] atonements no more effective that the
[1:16:39] blood no longer works or that he's no
[1:16:41] longer high priests or that he's no
[1:16:43] longer lam it calls us back to the lamb
[1:16:47] and his atoning blood that's what the
[1:16:52] real message does a man it's cults and
[1:16:55] creeds and dogmas of man that puts you
[1:16:58] away from Christ and his atoning blood
[1:17:00] and man there is only one way of
[1:17:03] salvation that is not Church Jordan
[1:17:06] that's not belonging to denomination
[1:17:09] they that's not balm into a cult or club
[1:17:12] or also a creed or a Dogma a man there's
[1:17:17] only one place of atonement and that's
[1:17:19] in Christ and His atoning blood nothing
[1:17:23] else can wash away your sins nothing but
[1:17:27] the blood of Jesus hey man so you see it
[1:17:32] would call us back to the original
[1:17:37] atonement making the atonement necessary
[1:17:42] in order for there to be a rapture let
[1:17:47] me just say it without an atonement
[1:17:49] there's no rupture without the atonement
[1:17:53] there's no body change when you take the
[1:17:57] atonement away we have no message
[1:18:01] without the atonement there's no divine
[1:18:04] healing without the atonement there is
[1:18:09] no mercy amen
[1:18:12] this is why the original totalement is
[1:18:15] so important that we come back to the
[1:18:18] original atonement now so you see the
[1:18:25] original atonement is what has brought
[1:18:27] us to a bride age and that bright age is
[1:18:32] an Apostolic age somebody help me now
[1:18:36] man as long as Mother it's it's the age
[1:18:40] the apple Stalag age put back into
[1:18:42] effect again so when we're saying come
[1:18:46] - the original atonement that it means
[1:18:48] we come back to an apostolic age again
[1:18:52] to an apostolic message word that the
[1:18:56] book of Acts is continued a man
[1:19:00] hallelujah are you with me
[1:19:02] so the bride age is within the Laodicean
[1:19:05] age and we're called there by the
[1:19:07] messenger of the church out of Azusa
[1:19:10] Pentecost into the Pentecostal
[1:19:14] Ginuwine and that's where it calls us it
[1:19:18] calls us back to the Pentecostal genuine
[1:19:22] to the same atonement they had on the
[1:19:25] day of Pentecost
[1:19:26] hey man I'm going somewhere now brother
[1:19:29] Branham tells us about in the resume of
[1:19:31] the ages as he talks about the seven
[1:19:34] ages and he talks about before the ages
[1:19:37] began that little spot maybe from
[1:19:41] Pentecost to to when the ages began
[1:19:45] somewhere about thirty year period he
[1:19:48] talks about a time where that the church
[1:19:52] was pure and undefiled now that was a
[1:19:58] bride age and when we come down to the
[1:20:02] end of Laodicea at the last of it by the
[1:20:05] prophets message within the latency in
[1:20:08] the age in the seven days it returns
[1:20:10] back to being a bride's age again
[1:20:14] hallelujah were the same gospel that
[1:20:18] Paul preached is what we preach the same
[1:20:22] word we don't deviate you from one bit
[1:20:24] and man the same power the same glory a
[1:20:29] man that was in that Friday he's before
[1:20:32] the defilement is the same ride that is
[1:20:35] in the last day in the last church age
[1:20:39] before we're raptured out of here a man
[1:20:43] a little space of time where God will
[1:20:46] have a bride again ready to be married
[1:20:49] to the groom a bride prepared
[1:20:57] adorned for her husband just and her
[1:21:00] wedding gown
[1:21:01] completing him without spot somebody say
[1:21:06] without spot without wrinkle without a
[1:21:09] blemish or any such thing a man a pure
[1:21:14] bride now so the birth of the church was
[1:21:20] at Pentecost and the first Adam was
[1:21:23] given a bride fresh from the hand of God
[1:21:25] and was undefiled for a brief span and
[1:21:29] so was Christ the last Adam given a
[1:21:32] bride pure and fresh at Pentecost and
[1:21:34] she remained separate and undefiled for
[1:21:38] some time but you know just like the
[1:21:42] serpent beguiled Eve now this is what
[1:21:44] Paul would come in and he would say look
[1:21:47] as a serpent beguiled Eve I'm worried
[1:21:51] about you I'm worried about you that
[1:21:53] you'll accept another Jesus I'm not
[1:21:59] worried that you won't still worshipped
[1:22:00] or that you still alive churches
[1:22:03] I'm worried that you won't know that
[1:22:07] Jesus that's the same yesterday today
[1:22:09] and forever
[1:22:11] but it'll be replaced with a bunch of
[1:22:14] cold Creed's and goblins and apostolic
[1:22:18] on the ideas of the apostolic Creed you
[1:22:24] know so you know you know again you know
[1:22:26] some kind of Creed replaced are you with
[1:22:29] me rather than another rather than the
[1:22:32] real Bible fundamental Word of God I'm
[1:22:36] afraid I'm afraid you'll be beguiled I'm
[1:22:41] afraid there's of seduction coming in
[1:22:44] fact he prophesied that it would be so
[1:22:47] this is found in 2nd Thessalonians were
[1:22:51] that he were that he says that the man
[1:22:53] of sin would be revealed the son of
[1:22:55] perdition
[1:22:56] and the church was so drift until
[1:23:00] finally they would be seen worship and
[1:23:02] the man of sin in the church instead of
[1:23:06] the real Christ
[1:23:10] now you talk about a falling away the
[1:23:14] Bible would declare her in the book of
[1:23:16] Revelation as a church that would stray
[1:23:19] so far he would call her a someone
[1:23:24] who hadn't been true to her husband
[1:23:28] someone who had taken in seeds of
[1:23:30] another man amen seeds of Pope's and
[1:23:35] bishops and ideas and denomination and
[1:23:37] everything else a man now but there when
[1:23:44] she came from the hand of God at
[1:23:47] Pentecost
[1:23:48] under the original atonement she was
[1:23:50] separate and undefiled a bride now he
[1:23:57] said how long discontinued we don't know
[1:23:59] but one day even as he was tempted and
[1:24:01] seduced by Satan so the church was
[1:24:03] contaminated by the interest of an
[1:24:06] antichrist spirit remember the
[1:24:09] Antichrist spirit comes in to defile to
[1:24:12] make her cold and formal and powerless
[1:24:15] and that's what the workings of Satan
[1:24:19] would want to do to you make you cold
[1:24:21] and formal and powerless Oh God
[1:24:27] God hates powerless forsen hey man oh my
[1:24:32] god hates worship without sincerity
[1:24:36] God hates it he would say there is well
[1:24:40] I hate your sacrifices
[1:24:42] can you imagine sacrifices he instituted
[1:24:47] but they become a farm that we're just
[1:24:50] doing it as a ritual and there was no
[1:24:52] sincerity to it God said I hate it now
[1:25:00] finally in Revelation 2 we would find
[1:25:04] the church that first church age he said
[1:25:07] remember from which you've fallen you
[1:25:10] have left your first love so already the
[1:25:14] first that first age was already a
[1:25:16] fallen woman and his Satan had gotten
[1:25:20] the
[1:25:20] before Adam even now Satan seduced the
[1:25:23] church the Bride of Christ before the
[1:25:25] marriage supper of the lamb and and what
[1:25:29] was was it what was it he called her
[1:25:32] fall the deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:25:36] already the first age had turned from
[1:25:38] following the pure Word of God they turn
[1:25:41] from God's demand of a church absolutely
[1:25:43] dependent upon him depending entirely
[1:25:46] upon God to fulfill his word from start
[1:25:50] to finish apart from human government to
[1:25:53] Nikolaev anism
[1:25:54] which is organized in a human government
[1:25:57] within the church which is all
[1:25:59] governments do legislate for the people
[1:26:02] they did exactly what Israel did they
[1:26:05] took the Expediency of human government
[1:26:08] instead of the word and the spirit now
[1:26:12] notice what happened to bride got
[1:26:15] defiled as Eve did and just like Eve the
[1:26:19] church lost her position in the world
[1:26:22] and the church agents start out as a
[1:26:26] church who lost her first love her name
[1:26:30] would be emphasis which means aimed at
[1:26:34] and relaxed
[1:26:35] oh god that's what we don't want to be
[1:26:37] no feasts and age somebody that aimed at
[1:26:41] the high call and then relaxed don't you
[1:26:43] know the danger of the delay that's
[1:26:46] associated with the coming of the Lord
[1:26:48] don't you realize how important that it
[1:26:51] is at you what you know there's that
[1:26:54] word that Jesus uses with this coming
[1:26:57] over and over again watch watch watch
[1:27:00] watch keep your eyes open be alert don't
[1:27:04] go to sleep
[1:27:05] you're not at the world don't go to
[1:27:07] sleep like them be awake you're not of
[1:27:10] the night you're at the day all of these
[1:27:12] have to do with this coming
[1:27:15] don't let yourself get backslidden
[1:27:18] lukewarm cold farmer powers don't allow
[1:27:24] yourself to drift just like in this
[1:27:34] service don't allow yourself to go to
[1:27:37] sleep
[1:27:40] this is your last service keep that in
[1:27:47] mind this is the last service they just
[1:27:54] came to my mind Paul's last sermon he
[1:27:57] preached to midnight so hopefully we
[1:28:01] won't have to go to midnight to get my
[1:28:03] last one now remember remember how I
[1:28:13] want you to go back in your mind and I
[1:28:16] want you to remember how the devil got
[1:28:18] in the book of Acts church you read the
[1:28:23] verse seal and brother Branham tells us
[1:28:25] how he tells us there was a wonderful
[1:28:28] outpouring of the Holy Spirit and it
[1:28:30] fell upon upon the rich and the poor in
[1:28:33] the end the end the and a lot of poor
[1:28:36] people that were just slaves and there
[1:28:39] they begin to they begin to rejoice and
[1:28:42] the truth that they had and they had to
[1:28:45] joy the Lord and there were signs and
[1:28:47] wonders among them that was speaking in
[1:28:49] other tongues and interpretation there
[1:28:52] were healings and miracles and things
[1:28:55] that were happening it was a book of
[1:28:57] Acts church and the matter little dimly
[1:29:00] lit places of course they couldn't meet
[1:29:02] in the synagogue's it wasn't theirs they
[1:29:05] were cast out of there so where they
[1:29:07] were there a little dimly lit places
[1:29:10] there and and then many of them were
[1:29:12] slaves and poor and you know thought of
[1:29:16] as as a lower class of people and so
[1:29:21] then you know that they're seeing this
[1:29:23] joy and these signs and wonders
[1:29:26] they're some of the masters of these
[1:29:28] slaves would see them are so blessed by
[1:29:31] the spirit and God doing signs of wonder
[1:29:33] and they wanted to know that power
[1:29:35] salvation themselves and so some of them
[1:29:40] you know started coming when they come
[1:29:44] into that dimly lit places and the caves
[1:29:46] and the people who are in rags and
[1:29:48] slaves and they're not so celebrities
[1:29:51] and rich people and you know they're not
[1:29:53] dressed the best and whatever the rich
[1:29:56] could not stoop to such as local low
[1:29:59] subculture of these poor people who
[1:30:02] spoke in tongues and prophesied so you
[1:30:04] know what they had to do they had to
[1:30:05] dress it up a mound and that parallels
[1:30:12] today can I just say if Kelly can I just
[1:30:15] talk to you a moment
[1:30:17] can I kind of just say you know spill my
[1:30:20] guts as it were and just just say it but
[1:30:23] there you know that they're parallel
[1:30:25] since day when God purposely chosen
[1:30:27] nobody a seventh grade Kentucky with
[1:30:31] Heights and totes and noted and you know
[1:30:34] didn't have a college degree and he
[1:30:36] wasn't from this seminary they mouth and
[1:30:41] it wasn't classy enough for God to use a
[1:30:45] prophet with the seventh grade education
[1:30:47] whose grammar was hillbilly Asst so they
[1:30:51] had to rise up want to be apostles who
[1:30:54] thought they needed to bring clarity to
[1:30:59] the message to polish it up a little bit
[1:31:02] you know he needed to help to say what
[1:31:05] the thunders were they needed they
[1:31:08] didn't you see he he didn't say it plain
[1:31:11] enough well really he never did say what
[1:31:14] they said he said you know but even what
[1:31:16] they wound up saying but they needed
[1:31:18] something higher something beyond the
[1:31:21] seventh angel in his message so they
[1:31:24] claimed another age that something we
[1:31:27] got something beyond we went around
[1:31:29] higher we went into a bride age there's
[1:31:32] something beyond the seventh age oh you
[1:31:36] know you you back here you're just six
[1:31:39] sealed
[1:31:39] leavers were Seventh Seal believers we
[1:31:41] we got more truth we got more light we
[1:31:44] got more we're we're we're better off
[1:31:47] but let me just tell you you know today
[1:31:50] the fruits of it is shown it was not a
[1:31:52] it was not a return to the promised land
[1:31:55] it wasn't going back to the Bible it
[1:32:00] wasn't going back to the truth of God's
[1:32:02] Word
[1:32:03] it wasn't staying with the message hey
[1:32:06] man but it was it was like Hitler and
[1:32:09] his deceit Toulouse lured the Jews to a
[1:32:12] lake you know he he had that all kinds
[1:32:16] of ploys that he would do to manipulate
[1:32:18] the minds of these people we're gonna
[1:32:21] relocate you out of the ghettos here
[1:32:24] we're gonna give you a better place and
[1:32:26] and you're going to go there and then
[1:32:29] they would that would take them on
[1:32:30] trains and stop and matter place and
[1:32:33] they would give them a holiday for about
[1:32:35] three days and good food nice and they
[1:32:38] were tryin give them pens and papers
[1:32:40] they write all their friends and
[1:32:42] relatives we're doing good you know we
[1:32:44] read their treatments nice and we had
[1:32:47] good food today and my you know their
[1:32:50] grill rolled out the red carpet for us
[1:32:52] not knowing they were going to the death
[1:32:56] chamber not knowing there was being fed
[1:33:01] a lie but oh they would have feast and
[1:33:06] celebrations for a moment only to be
[1:33:09] left loaded up again like cattle taken
[1:33:13] down to place and stripped of their
[1:33:15] humanity see what a return to the
[1:33:23] promised land
[1:33:24] it was another concentration camp worse
[1:33:27] than the ghettos worsen listen worsened
[1:33:32] in a nomination to come out of you know
[1:33:36] was and it was just another mood to
[1:33:39] stuff out faith in God and place it in a
[1:33:41] personality cult and to traditions of
[1:33:46] man and traditions as a you know can be
[1:33:49] a long-established belief and that long
[1:33:52] as that
[1:33:52] believe we need a man to rule over us we
[1:33:55] need a bishop we need an apostle
[1:33:57] we need an overseer and this this
[1:34:00] apostle would lord it all over all the
[1:34:02] other ministers in the churches he
[1:34:05] become the the great apostles even
[1:34:08] greater even greater or equal to or
[1:34:11] greater than Moses on greater than a
[1:34:14] vindicated prophet I don't know how we
[1:34:18] take a man that maybe had a miracle or
[1:34:20] two or prophecy or something come to
[1:34:22] pass and compare it with a prophet who
[1:34:25] had miracle after miracle and sign after
[1:34:28] sign and the angel of God and
[1:34:31] vindication come on church hey man I'm
[1:34:36] not talking about some my brave for a
[1:34:38] deaf person and they were healed I've
[1:34:41] had that happen where that rule we had
[1:34:43] in our meetings in Germany a little lady
[1:34:45] come with her hearing aids and said I
[1:34:48] don't need this who can I give them to
[1:34:50] because I was healed by the glory of God
[1:34:53] today as I was there in the shower I
[1:34:55] began to hear children's voices and I
[1:34:58] begin to hear the shower run and I
[1:35:01] realize my healing has come and I don't
[1:35:03] need these hearing aids because I'm
[1:35:05] completely well but I'm not talking
[1:35:08] about of someone who has had a bad ears
[1:35:12] and they got healing I'm talking about
[1:35:14] going into the into to Little Rock
[1:35:17] Arkansas into the school of the death
[1:35:21] and a hundred and fifty-two healed in
[1:35:24] one day I'm not talking about a little
[1:35:34] miracle once in a while
[1:35:36] their science followed them that believe
[1:35:38] we can get you to believe science and
[1:35:40] follow a man you can get a Catholic now
[1:35:43] Catholic to believe even the the Word of
[1:35:46] God of Christ being the healer gotta
[1:35:48] heal the Catholic God's no respect to
[1:35:50] person he finds faith he'll heal but
[1:35:53] we're not talking about a little healing
[1:35:54] we're talking about God vindicating a
[1:35:57] message in this last day are you with me
[1:36:01] a man and now you know it wasn't long
[1:36:05] you know
[1:36:05] wasn't long what's the spirits that
[1:36:07] exalt himself it wasn't long you know
[1:36:10] until it becomes the voice of the
[1:36:12] Archangel then next he becomes Michael
[1:36:15] himself and the next thing you know when
[1:36:18] he's gone his followers they got a new
[1:36:20] one better so one of them one of them is
[1:36:22] Elohim the others the Holy Ghost that is
[1:36:27] the results of following men and it
[1:36:34] doesn't produce a rapture doesn't reduce
[1:36:37] raptured faith it causes disillusionment
[1:36:40] hurt confusion despair
[1:36:46] hey ma'am no see you know here here we
[1:36:51] go you see what is it it's the worship
[1:36:53] of a man giving him the headship instead
[1:36:56] of the Word of God now that wasn't
[1:36:58] enough we had the parousia tradition
[1:37:00] that went forth and a teacher become
[1:37:03] greater than the vindicated prophet they
[1:37:06] called it that the bride aged but it was
[1:37:08] another oz which just this teacher was
[1:37:12] needed to dress up the message in order
[1:37:16] to do so that wound up even denying the
[1:37:18] deity of Jesus Christ
[1:37:20] may Jesus lower than than Godhead and
[1:37:24] turned turned their movement into dead
[1:37:26] to death camp where there's no spirit no
[1:37:29] anointing just dry teaching without
[1:37:33] power and today they're just another
[1:37:36] little denomination bound even tighter
[1:37:39] that denominations and yeah and you
[1:37:43] think that you're in some Fridays
[1:37:45] because of the tradition you know
[1:37:48] tradition is is not just something
[1:37:50] long-standing that can be one one
[1:37:52] meaning event but a tradition as a
[1:37:54] doctrine that's not scriptural but just
[1:37:57] accepted as fact just based on a theory
[1:38:00] and you think you can just cherry-pick a
[1:38:03] few little quotes then you pick together
[1:38:06] and come up with something brother
[1:38:11] I'll tell you what you come up with you
[1:38:12] come up with another oz we call it every
[1:38:15] time
[1:38:16] remember this here brother branham would
[1:38:19] tell us in god of this evil aids
[1:38:20] remember it was an unpardonable sin
[1:38:23] three times in the Bible for persons to
[1:38:25] add one word of their own interpretation
[1:38:28] to God's Word
[1:38:29] after he had been vindicated the truth
[1:38:32] and I'll tell you it's been vindicated
[1:38:33] to be the truth in the Garden of Eden
[1:38:36] one word at it calls death when Balaam
[1:38:41] added the word you know we're all the
[1:38:43] same god never forgive that and everyone
[1:38:46] in Paris in the wilderness except the
[1:38:48] three that God brought out and Jesus
[1:38:51] said there everyone dead that's
[1:38:52] eternally separated they're all cold
[1:38:54] never was forgiving it was an
[1:38:57] unpardonable sin never forgiving them oh
[1:38:59] my flee it children of the evening
[1:39:02] lights a man fleeing where are we gonna
[1:39:07] go to what happened to the Jews when
[1:39:11] they finally got out of Oz with those
[1:39:14] that survived those that got out of the
[1:39:16] death trap Gramps what did they where
[1:39:18] did it go they couldn't go back their
[1:39:20] homes they didn't have homes they can go
[1:39:23] back and settle in Germany that wasn't
[1:39:25] their home no more they've been uprooted
[1:39:27] there are the houses torn down their
[1:39:29] cities rightful their their place is
[1:39:32] confiscated where could they go that can
[1:39:36] go to one place it was something in
[1:39:39] their heart there's gotta be a homeland
[1:39:41] for the Jews you said where can we go
[1:39:45] brother Jim where can we go I'll tell
[1:39:47] you where to go go back to the homeland

[1:39:57] the Word of God get back to above the
[1:40:00] backstrokes get back to truth amen let's
[1:40:06] suggest with the same today what about
[1:40:08] the message what about the dress even
[1:40:18] then you have other personality cults
[1:40:20] they want to rise to overlord us to tell
[1:40:23] us only to play tapes in our churches
[1:40:26] then other personality cults arise
[1:40:29] tell us what kind of music we can play
[1:40:31] and control Holy Ghost worship
[1:40:34] hey man I'm like that I'm like the
[1:40:37] Hebrew children
[1:40:38] I won't bend I won't bow and I won't
[1:40:41] burn hey man I've got a I've got an
[1:40:46] announcement I just want to say because
[1:40:49] you you think all day you're just
[1:40:51] talking about you your local your your
[1:40:54] local problems and your your your to
[1:40:56] your some movement problems let me tell
[1:40:59] you it's a problem whether you're in the
[1:41:01] charismatic round was the Pentecostal
[1:41:03] round the Baptist round everybody is juk
[1:41:06] in four position you see the attitude of
[1:41:10] it is who's going to be the greatest
[1:41:11] among us and we ought to know who should
[1:41:14] be the greatest among us about kingdom
[1:41:18] building and their kingdom it's about
[1:41:21] God and his kingdom
[1:41:24] being Lord of Lord and King of Kings but
[1:41:31] I've got an announcement for all of them
[1:41:33] ever personality cult in Christianity
[1:41:36] that there is today that are vying for
[1:41:38] position I got a I got an announcement
[1:41:41] for you take a number and get in line
[1:41:45] you know there's been many of them
[1:41:53] before you and there will be many
[1:41:56] getting the line behind you but when you
[1:41:59] when you get to the front of the line
[1:42:02] you're going to be told this so listen
[1:42:05] when you get to the front align you're
[1:42:07] finally there to get your physician
[1:42:10] brother branham tells us in Christ's a
[1:42:13] mystery as he as the head was taken up
[1:42:16] from the grave so must his body follow
[1:42:19] him to Eden ain't no preacher taking us
[1:42:23] there ain't no bishop taking us there
[1:42:25] Amen but follow him indeed and therefore
[1:42:29] the body I'm is part of the body cannot
[1:42:32] recognize any other headship but the
[1:42:36] headship of the word
[1:42:38] hallelujah no denomination can put
[1:42:41] anything to it for whosoever will add
[1:42:44] one word away from her or take one word
[1:42:47] away from it or add one word to it it
[1:42:49] took away your dead hybrid right there
[1:42:52] she's back here
[1:42:53] that's testimonies in her hands up
[1:42:55] filthiness of her fornication speared
[1:42:57] committing them spiritual adultery
[1:43:00] against some very words she claims to
[1:43:02] believe a man I'm just going to say to
[1:43:05] take any man as your husband that but
[1:43:07] Christ is adultery too may take anybody
[1:43:15] as you're a leader except the Holy Ghost
[1:43:17] is adultery against God
[1:43:24] sure a pastor is a leader of an assembly
[1:43:30] posture is is a head of a local body but
[1:43:36] he's not your head your head at the head
[1:43:39] of every man is Christ and the head of
[1:43:44] every woman is the man this is Bible and
[1:43:48] our head is Christ is that right and as
[1:43:53] pastors we lead the people by feeding
[1:43:56] them the word a man so he said therefore
[1:44:01] it's the word or nothing that's right
[1:44:03] he's the word how do you know he's the
[1:44:05] word is venda he the word is vindicated
[1:44:07] he the word improperly vindicated is the
[1:44:11] headship the head of the church so I
[1:44:13] just ask worship indication a man he is
[1:44:19] properly identified vindicated by his
[1:44:22] own spirit being in it in the church
[1:44:24] itself the person suing for himself in
[1:44:28] vindication is direct proof to the to
[1:44:31] the entire body you don't need Creed's
[1:44:33] then denominations as terrorists but the
[1:44:37] headship itself recognized in the body
[1:44:40] but personal identification see identify
[1:44:43] himself proves the headship to the body
[1:44:47] then we are united
[1:44:49] under one vindicated headship and that
[1:44:52] is Christ the Word of God not under any
[1:44:56] church hey Mac he would tell again in
[1:45:03] the message God's only provided place of
[1:45:05] worship
[1:45:06] have you noticed ever three years a
[1:45:08] great meeting what takes place a
[1:45:10] denomination this is twenty years and no
[1:45:13] denomination deer died lamb may it never
[1:45:15] do that if I go in this generation make
[1:45:19] the people who believe this message
[1:45:20] never stand still for a denomination
[1:45:25] you've got right in your track remember
[1:45:29] that the very hour
[1:45:30] you mentioned denomination among you I
[1:45:33] don't care how sincere you are take man
[1:45:35] for your leader instead of the Holy
[1:45:38] Spirit to confirm this word that's the
[1:45:41] alley you die so we want to die that's
[1:45:46] all we got to do just become a part of a
[1:45:50] another personality cult and I'm gonna
[1:45:55] just tell you you know even then you got
[1:45:59] to remember your head is Christ you know
[1:46:08] a lot of people want to give their
[1:46:10] headship over to a pastor you are to be
[1:46:15] led by the Spirit of God yourself you
[1:46:20] should pray over the church that you go
[1:46:22] to a man because churches carry spirits
[1:46:27] and you should choose by by revelation
[1:46:32] and so where you go to church and you do
[1:46:35] it to find a place that will feed your
[1:46:37] soul that you can raise your children in
[1:46:40] the admonition of God whether it be an
[1:46:42] atmosphere the Holy Ghost air where the
[1:46:45] power God can move out and Savior
[1:46:47] children like he saved you dear God you
[1:46:52] know we knew it took atmosphere for us
[1:46:54] to be saved and
[1:46:56] why do we want to deny atmosphere for
[1:46:58] our own children we want to squash the
[1:47:04] songs and squats the worship and squelch
[1:47:06] the praise sprouts the shoutings quasi
[1:47:09] amens oh my goodness church we want to
[1:47:13] create an atmosphere
[1:47:15] remember Souls can be saved where
[1:47:18] sinners can live their way to Calvary
[1:47:20] where that God can have the preeminence
[1:47:23] we don't want to be a bard we don't want
[1:47:25] to be dad we will have the power of God
[1:47:28] unto salvation that when our sick needs
[1:47:31] healing there's a healer there with our
[1:47:33] children our loss when there's a Savior
[1:47:36] there well there's a need and the body
[1:47:38] doesn't need supplier there oh you know
[1:47:49] we have them we hear teachings today
[1:47:53] where the pastor claims to be the
[1:47:57] husband the husband of the church and
[1:48:01] they teach the pastors the husband of
[1:48:03] the individuals and assembly and then
[1:48:06] they begin to take it further
[1:48:08] it's adultery to listen to anybody else
[1:48:10] but then this is another form of popery
[1:48:19] you'd have been better off to stay out
[1:48:22] where you know at least 34 million that
[1:48:25] you know three or four about $3 billion
[1:48:28] that believes like that
[1:48:30] you did better better stay off like that
[1:48:34] out in an ism somewhere then to come
[1:48:37] under that but your brother Branham
[1:48:40] would make a statement and what's what
[1:48:42] what what men do with agendas he talks
[1:48:46] about Lot's wife she started out as an
[1:48:48] overcomer but she never did overcome oh
[1:48:50] she left the denomination she did she
[1:48:53] walked out of Sodom with a lot but when
[1:48:55] she she wanted to go back have her hair
[1:48:58] cut you know what it means she had to go
[1:49:00] back she couldn't she couldn't stand the
[1:49:02] test she had to go back again to see
[1:49:04] what the rest of them was doing oh you
[1:49:06] know I had some good friends down
[1:49:08] after all and and I tell ya you know
[1:49:10] this might be just a little movie I
[1:49:12] don't know whether it could be right or
[1:49:14] not I only got this man's word for it
[1:49:16] though he's my husband but yet
[1:49:18] then he says your pastor is your husband
[1:49:22] spiritually speaking you see now whether
[1:49:24] it could be right or not I don't know
[1:49:26] maybe this revelation wasn't right maybe
[1:49:29] his revelation wasn't right and and then
[1:49:31] he said if you're not perfectly
[1:49:32] satisfied you're not perfectly know that
[1:49:35] it's the Word of God then you can't go
[1:49:37] then you've got to be really sold out
[1:49:39] you got it no not just say well I see
[1:49:41] others do it I see a sign so if you're
[1:49:43] looking this in context he's speaking
[1:49:46] about lot and his wife lot and his wife
[1:49:50] Lot's wife didn't listen to the
[1:49:53] leadership of her husband instead she
[1:49:56] says I don't know whether it could be
[1:49:58] right or not I only got this man's word
[1:50:01] for it though he's my husband then
[1:50:03] brother Brennan said of this woman and
[1:50:05] referenced a lot in his wife your pastor
[1:50:09] is your husband spiritually speaking he
[1:50:12] not telling us that the that your pastor
[1:50:16] is your husband he's telling the that
[1:50:20] would the women using Lot's wife that
[1:50:22] you have a priest in your home who is a
[1:50:27] pastor of that home and that pastor is
[1:50:31] your husband the husband of the family
[1:50:34] the shepherd of the family the priest of
[1:50:36] the family come on
[1:50:38] hey ma'am your husband is your pastors
[1:50:42] fiercely speaking now that's what he's
[1:50:46] telling now so yeah passwords a head of
[1:50:50] a local church but he's not a head of
[1:50:52] the Bride of Christ and he's not your
[1:50:55] head
[1:50:55] and he's definitely not your dictator a
[1:50:59] man he leads the people by feeding them
[1:51:02] the word a man I you know how how I
[1:51:06] can't understand how a man could
[1:51:09] relinquish the headship of Christ to
[1:51:12] another man you know not to mention
[1:51:16] allow another man to serve headship over
[1:51:19] his wife can you imagine there
[1:51:21] that some some men will live today will
[1:51:24] leave a church and when they leave the
[1:51:27] church the pastor sells well now because
[1:51:31] he's left us he's dead now you just go
[1:51:34] get married again it's happened and
[1:51:39] these pastors a serf headship over the
[1:51:43] women in order to control the men and if
[1:51:47] the husband disagrees and goes to
[1:51:48] another assembly and I guess that he's
[1:51:50] considered dead and the women that just
[1:51:52] can go get remarried again breaking up
[1:51:56] homes somebody's going to answer to God
[1:52:00] for this nonsense
[1:52:02] hey man oh brother I you know I don't
[1:52:05] know you may want a pastor to tell you
[1:52:07] what kind of color cards it's a drive or
[1:52:09] what models are driver how much debt
[1:52:11] that you can incur we do do that you may
[1:52:13] want a pastor like that be you picked
[1:52:15] the wrong place I really don't care what
[1:52:18] color you drive and I really don't want
[1:52:26] to be bothered with the details of all
[1:52:27] your stuff I would love rather you get
[1:52:32] in love with Jesus Christ and that you
[1:52:35] know the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:37] and you pray over your decisions rather
[1:52:41] than come to me to make them cuz I ain't
[1:52:44] gonna be your Holy Ghost
[1:52:47] hey ma'am but notice now the atonement
[1:52:53] brings you back to where the head of
[1:52:57] every man is Christ and the head of the
[1:53:01] family is the man these are well what if
[1:53:05] I don't have a husband well in your head
[1:53:06] is Christ that's just that very simple a
[1:53:09] man who just goes right up to the next
[1:53:11] level if you don't have a husband you're
[1:53:13] unmarried you're a widow your widower
[1:53:15] your you've been divorced for whatever
[1:53:17] your condition is you know you that your
[1:53:19] head is Christ you've got a head all of
[1:53:23] us got a head a man and you're your
[1:53:27] husband your husband the man there is
[1:53:29] not a dictator somebody can help me get
[1:53:33] this done a man he's not
[1:53:35] be a dictator over the family he is to
[1:53:38] lead them by pointing them to the word
[1:53:40] not just not high his own whim and
[1:53:43] dictatorship but also considering the
[1:53:46] needs of the family hey man I'll be off
[1:53:51] this chain fit in a moment we'll preach
[1:53:53] something we'll get into some other
[1:53:55] things but while I'm while I'm cleaning
[1:53:57] up just let me clean because you know
[1:54:00] this message brought us from chickens
[1:54:03] and ducks and geese to from false
[1:54:08] worship and worship of man and worship
[1:54:12] whether idolatry is what it is I meant
[1:54:16] back to the power of Pentecost back to
[1:54:21] Napa starlit Fridays they meant back to
[1:54:25] divine healing back to living God a man
[1:54:29] not some form or tradition with no power
[1:54:32] over a man or power in it but in this
[1:54:37] right age you want to leave me somewhere
[1:54:40] there's no worship there's no holy ghost
[1:54:42] that ever moves on a person and they get
[1:54:45] so overjoyed they speak in other
[1:54:47] languages you there's no divine healing
[1:54:49] there there's no faith no atonement my
[1:54:51] blood you want to leave me there that's
[1:54:54] a ghetto that's where we're stripped a
[1:55:00] man were stripped of our Christianity
[1:55:03] and it's relying upon a Pope a bishop
[1:55:07] now you see the homeland was closed off
[1:55:13] to the Jews but the trumpet called it
[1:55:17] back hey Ben and let me tell you the
[1:55:22] same thing when we look at our homeland
[1:55:24] which is the Bible and now we're going
[1:55:26] to revelation 5 in our thinking and now
[1:55:29] the book is sealed off the homeland
[1:55:33] that's to our homeland in it amen
[1:55:35] is sealed off with seven seals and man
[1:55:39] but and so therefore was closed off to
[1:55:42] us and Paul's gospel closed
[1:55:47] tell us but what happened they meant God
[1:55:51] the Lamb took off his seven seals and
[1:55:54] revealed why we were out of the homeland
[1:55:58] and how come we got scattered out here
[1:56:01] in order that we can find our way back
[1:56:06] not to a closed book but to an open book
[1:56:11] not to a closed homeland but to our
[1:56:15] homeland back to an original atonement
[1:56:20] so the trumpets this trumpets call
[1:56:23] Israel back to their Bible homeland and
[1:56:26] the seven seals open our homeland back
[1:56:30] to us again
[1:56:32] now so it gathers them back
[1:56:36] the trumpets gather Israel to their
[1:56:38] homeland and the six trumpets have
[1:56:42] sounded and have gathered him back as a
[1:56:44] nation I think sometimes we fail to
[1:56:48] really see the significance just look at
[1:56:53] our counterpart there over there they're
[1:56:59] building up the wastelands the deserts
[1:57:04] are beginning to bloom like a rose and
[1:57:07] then there's life that is coming out of
[1:57:09] dry places somebody with me I met green
[1:57:13] pastures or a brand being brought forth
[1:57:17] revival is happening as there they are
[1:57:22] getting their land and reclaiming their
[1:57:25] promise that's our counterpart and but
[1:57:29] it's only a side then on the other side
[1:57:32] there is another group of people a royal
[1:57:36] seed of Abraham that are going back to
[1:57:40] the forgotten places the dry places Oh
[1:57:45] hallelujah call it back oh you might be
[1:57:49] weary
[1:57:50] you might bend whipped around by the
[1:57:53] devil you might have been in the ghetto
[1:57:55] you might have been disturbed in every
[1:57:57] way but all come back back there is a
[1:58:02] hole man the is open for you if you
[1:58:06] need he lives in the homeland that dry
[1:58:10] place can bloom beginning you need
[1:58:12] salvation that dry place can bloom again
[1:58:15] water can come down in the latter rain
[1:58:19] and bring it to harvest bring
[1:58:23] fruitfulness in your life so it was to
[1:58:26] gather them back now the seventh trumpet
[1:58:31] breaks the silence to Israel to where
[1:58:37] they recognize the Messiah and the
[1:58:43] seventh seal is a breaking of the
[1:58:45] silence which brings about the coming of
[1:58:48] the Lord the revealing of the Messiah
[1:58:51] now listen listen church not the
[1:58:54] revealing of another preacher but to
[1:58:57] reveal Ana Christ this messenger did not
[1:59:02] for run another one another preacher to
[1:59:06] come another apostle to come he was to
[1:59:09] forerun Christ coming are you with me a
[1:59:13] man and they would come first as the
[1:59:16] anointing word to restore his back to
[1:59:19] original doctrine again back to the
[1:59:23] original atonement again somebody with
[1:59:25] me now now that's what it was father it
[1:59:28] was to bring a restoration back to that
[1:59:30] first but it isn't it will never and has
[1:59:36] not and will never be successful unless
[1:59:38] it produces the corporal return of the
[1:59:43] Lord Jesus Christ that's what this
[1:59:47] message is to produce a rapture not one
[1:59:51] that's an imagination just a spiritual
[1:59:53] lifting up but something that translates
[1:59:56] you from this dimension to another
[2:00:01] so you see the breaking the sounding of
[2:00:06] that trumpet you know it breaks the
[2:00:12] silence it's like a trumpet does you
[2:00:15] know everything you'd be all quiet
[2:00:16] little sitting that stupid blows when it
[2:00:20] blows is breaking the silence that right
[2:00:24] now so again it breaks the silence for
[2:00:28] them when that seventh trumpet blows it
[2:00:31] breaks as it makes known as Joseph makes
[2:00:35] known himself to his brother
[2:00:38] now Joseph has been silent all of these
[2:00:42] years
[2:00:43] hey man now we know he's been working
[2:00:46] because we've been we've been privy to
[2:00:50] some things in the book and we found out
[2:00:53] under the fifth seal are you with me and
[2:00:57] Amanda when the fish seal was open we
[2:01:00] found some of his brethren that had died
[2:01:04] for the testimony that they held for the
[2:01:07] Word of God and they were martyrs I
[2:01:11] meant don't don't you imagine what the
[2:01:14] water day is going to be with them two
[2:01:18] prophets because that veil how he's been
[2:01:22] with you all the time
[2:01:24] you mean during the Holocaust yes that
[2:01:27] was him
[2:01:28] you mean during it yeah it was his hand
[2:01:31] lean your back getting your hand up
[2:01:33] roots through out of these countries and
[2:01:35] bring you back to your homeland
[2:01:37] it was his tender ham hey man it was him
[2:01:40] working all the time what about all
[2:01:42] those who are martyred
[2:01:44] they didn't believe on Jesus data they
[2:01:46] had no Messiah oh I'll show you look
[2:01:49] over here under this fifth seal they
[2:01:51] were given robes you meet my grandmother
[2:01:56] my great granddaddy who stood for Zion
[2:01:59] and stood for the Word of God and
[2:02:01] believed like they did and everything
[2:02:03] else and they they didn't know Jesus was
[2:02:06] the Messiah and yet they're given white
[2:02:10] yeah that's God's grace that's God's
[2:02:13] mercy to us you see this is what let
[2:02:17] those two prophets will do and they will
[2:02:20] reveal this Messiah who's been working
[2:02:23] with them all the time just like Joseph
[2:02:26] was given back the money given back to
[2:02:29] they given giving all the things and
[2:02:31] provide him for them all along the
[2:02:33] journey a man he's been providing for

[2:03:51] done something about it for I was
[2:03:53] wounded for your transgressions

[2:03:58] chastisement of your peace is on me and
[2:04:02] with my stripes you were healed I say
[2:04:05] what a mighty God what a savior to care
[2:04:08] so much for us amen here you will come
[2:04:12] I'm Joseph now listen these words and
[2:04:16] the trumpet is to call them back to that
[2:04:20] atonement
[2:04:22] see the atonement they reject it and
[2:04:25] they reject they reject it so our eyes
[2:04:29] could be opened theirs was closed and
[2:04:32] during these times these seals open the
[2:04:35] trumpets blue and now the blowing of the
[2:04:37] trumpet just before the Messiah because
[2:04:39] he got to be in Palestine
[2:04:41] you remember God had the hardened
[2:04:42] Pharaoh's heart to run them out of Egypt
[2:04:44] he hardened Stalin Mussolini and all of
[2:04:47] that to get them backed into the
[2:04:48] promised land where the 144,000 is
[2:04:51] supposed to be and for the first time
[2:04:54] for thousands of years 2500 years that
[2:04:57] Israel is a nation with its own flash
[2:04:59] its own army and all considered in the
[2:05:03] UN and first time you spend the oldest
[2:05:06] fly that's ever flown on earth is at
[2:05:08] this time flies again the six point
[2:05:12] style Damon and he said he would lift
[2:05:15] that ensign in the last days when she'd
[2:05:19] be coming back hey man we're at the end
[2:05:22] there's just no doubt about it we're
[2:05:25] here I mean can say amen to that
[2:05:28] and that now the Jews are not scattered
[2:05:32] under a German banner or enzyme they're
[2:05:37] not under the flag of Oz witch or polish
[2:05:41] banner are a Russian banner come on
[2:05:45] wherever they were scattered but they've
[2:05:47] been gathered under the inside of the
[2:05:51] Star of David Oh hallelujah God took
[2:05:58] that which was despised and rejected
[2:06:01] they would have to wear that that start
[2:06:04] identify them and it will become a star
[2:06:08] of shame and despise and I rejected the
[2:06:12] null downcast people and he took it and
[2:06:17] lifted it up come on now and makes it
[2:06:20] now a flag a banner to all the world an
[2:06:25] enzyme that God has not forgotten his
[2:06:28] people
[2:06:29] that is working and bad work in spite of
[2:06:32] everything that's been going on God's
[2:06:34] been behind the scene the whole time
[2:06:37] working things out for their good
[2:06:40] now as a 1112 says and he shall set up
[2:06:44] an enzyme for the nations and shall
[2:06:47] assemble the outcasts of Israel and
[2:06:50] gather together to his first of Judah
[2:06:53] from the four corners of the earth
[2:06:57] noticed us all then he says and I say a
[2:07:02] 18 and verse 3 all ye inhabitants of the
[2:07:06] world in dwellers on the earth see when
[2:07:10] he lifted up an in sign on the mountains
[2:07:13] and when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye so
[2:07:18] let me just say it today we as a Gentile
[2:07:21] bride
[2:07:22] we are not gathered under a Methodists
[2:07:26] or Baptists or denominational banner
[2:07:28] let's say of one a tape only or return
[2:07:31] ministry or to soul or seventh under a
[2:07:34] parousia where we were once scattered
[2:07:37] but we're under the banner of the
[2:07:40] headship of Christ hallelujah amen
[2:07:45] they even say in Song of Solomon 2 and 4
[2:07:47] he brought me to his banqueting house
[2:07:51] how many have been brought to his
[2:07:53] banqueting house a man a place where
[2:07:56] there's provision a place where there's
[2:07:58] a seven-course menu a place where all
[2:08:01] seven seals are open a place where the
[2:08:04] Word of God that can be preached freely
[2:08:07] and uninhibited
[2:08:08] he brought me to his banquet and house
[2:08:11] and his banner over me is love
[2:08:17] hallelujah his banner over me his love
[2:08:21] unchecked plot for his banner this motor
[2:08:24] man that his banner over you is without
[2:08:27] God so loves you he wanted a pride he
[2:08:33] wanted a people for his namesake and he
[2:08:36] chose you hallelujah praise the Lord
[2:08:44] hey man Christ a mystery he says don't
[2:08:49] you fail this the body therefore cannot
[2:08:54] recognize any other headship but the
[2:08:58] word because the head is connected with
[2:09:01] the body and the head is the word and
[2:09:04] it's the same word one headship
[2:09:07] therefore denominations Holy Fathers
[2:09:10] everything else is dead dumb you say
[2:09:12] brother Tim that's a bad way to say that
[2:09:14] Paul said I kill everything I know is
[2:09:17] dumb he studied under Gamaliel had all
[2:09:21] kinds of theology and he said I counted
[2:09:23] all his dumb that I might win Christ and
[2:09:26] then the body recognizes only one thing
[2:09:30] the word and he's here today in his word
[2:09:37] manifesting the same thing she can't
[2:09:39] recognize another headship
[2:09:41] there's no bishop no nothing she can she
[2:09:45] recognizes one headship that's Christ
[2:09:48] and Christ is the word he says oh I love
[2:09:52] that yes sir
[2:09:53] now when the seventh and the last
[2:09:57] trumpet sounds for the Gentiles the last
[2:10:00] trumpet sounds for us the bride is
[2:10:03] caught up and taken out just like
[2:10:07] Joseph's wife was dismissed to the
[2:10:10] palace he said they everybody go forth
[2:10:12] from me and he reveals herself to his
[2:10:15] brother and under that same trumpet
[2:10:19] Moses and Elijah distinct as it calls us
[2:10:22] up the dead from seven ages and we are
[2:10:29] translated as it Chrisette knows is
[2:10:33] somebody with me now
[2:10:34] Isaac could send out the
[2:10:37] masses turns right over into the Jews
[2:10:41] and continues right on in Redemption
[2:10:46] hallelujah a man
[2:10:48] notice under that trumpet Moses and
[2:10:51] Elijah those two witnesses shown in
[2:10:54] revelation 11 will bring them from the
[2:10:56] traditions of a little lamb now listen
[2:11:00] don't use our fervent they know it
[2:11:03] without the shedding of blood there's no
[2:11:04] remission of sins they know they hadn't
[2:11:07] had bloodshed they know that they hadn't
[2:11:09] had a temple in effect they know all
[2:11:11] they've had all of these years was the
[2:11:13] words of the rabbi and their tradition
[2:11:15] and everything but they know they need
[2:11:17] to get ready to welcome the king so
[2:11:20] they're talking about building the
[2:11:21] temple and they're trying to breathe a
[2:11:22] red heifer for the waters of separation
[2:11:25] they're trying to produce a lamb and
[2:11:27] they're trying to get the menorah and
[2:11:29] they're trying to get all the artifacts
[2:11:31] because they said one day one day the
[2:11:36] temple will be rebuilt but can you
[2:11:41] imagine why those Jews those 144,000 and
[2:11:46] Elijah and Moses will be hated remember
[2:11:51] Moses and Elijah we use them because
[2:11:53] it's the law in the prophets which
[2:11:55] represents the whole Old Covenant and
[2:11:57] they're coming to him and showing them
[2:11:59] everything you know the a prophecies
[2:12:03] that Jesus was given of Jesus there's
[2:12:08] not enough zeroes that could line up
[2:12:10] around the world to make the odds of
[2:12:13] those eight prophecies coming to pass
[2:12:15] without a supernatural God bring in all
[2:12:19] of those prophecies to pass but their
[2:12:26] eyes have been bonded and they are over
[2:12:32] there celebrating literal Sabbath's we
[2:12:38] got those in Christendom that does that
[2:12:40] too you know there's there there's
[2:12:42] Sabbath day people good people they just
[2:12:47] don't understand
[2:12:49] Jews are good people they just don't
[2:12:52] understand you know we wouldn't we were
[2:12:55] in Israel we had two sets of elevators
[2:12:58] we had one set it was for the Sabbath
[2:13:01] and when you step on it you know you do
[2:13:06] not have to push a button because it
[2:13:09] just takes you to the next floor till it
[2:13:11] gives up the top and then you know and a
[2:13:14] you know stops it every floor and lets
[2:13:15] everybody off so you know you get on the
[2:13:18] Sabbath one on the Sabbath day it's it's
[2:13:21] kicked in and designed so you don't have
[2:13:23] to push a button cuz it would be work to
[2:13:26] push a button and put eighth floor so
[2:13:29] you just have to get on it at first
[2:13:32] floor step up here it opens at first 2nd
[2:13:36] floor 3rd floor 4th floor 5th floor till
[2:13:39] it finally gets the 8th floor and if
[2:13:41] that's the top then it'll go back down
[2:13:43] to 7th and 6th and all the way back down
[2:13:47] that's the Sabbath elevators so they
[2:13:51] have a little Sabbath but they're going
[2:13:54] to be told
[2:13:55] it ain't a little Sabbath anymore but
[2:14:00] the Sabbath is the Holy Ghost and it's
[2:14:04] the rest worrying the weary are called
[2:14:06] the rest and once you get the Holy Ghost
[2:14:08] and then you are real Sabbath keeper
[2:14:11] you've entered in your rest you no
[2:14:12] longer labor and salmon you home
[2:14:15] hey man and then there will be changed
[2:14:18] from the literal Passover of the literal
[2:14:20] lamp - hallelujah
[2:14:23] the real Passover the Lamb of God that
[2:14:27] takes away the sin of the world and
[2:14:30] they'll be taken away from all of these
[2:14:33] that were only symbols and types now
[2:14:35] listen they're going to be hated by the
[2:14:37] rest of them they will be killed the
[2:14:42] Bible says so amen under the souls and
[2:14:45] the all tree said wrestle wild to your
[2:14:47] fellow brothers are killed like you are
[2:14:48] there will be killed for their testimony
[2:14:52] Moses and Elijah will be killed and
[2:14:55] resurrected and raptured amen and so
[2:15:02] will the hundred forty
[2:15:03] 4,000 cuz somehow they're in the
[2:15:04] Millennium somebody help me preach now
[2:15:09] you think you're the only one with a
[2:15:11] resurrection or rapture you think you're
[2:15:13] the only one with an I'll add your
[2:15:15] profit amen God's got this whole scene
[2:15:18] to play out with Israel come on
[2:15:21] oh man where he does exactly like she
[2:15:24] did for you took you from from from the
[2:15:27] laws of do's and don'ts of Old Testament
[2:15:31] keeping where roads types and shadows
[2:15:33] and feast and New Moon's and brings you
[2:15:36] right into where you see the true
[2:15:39] atonement the Lamb of God that was slain
[2:15:44] bring you in out of traditions now so
[2:15:51] before the seventh trumpet sounds to
[2:15:53] reveal him to the Messiah to the Jews
[2:15:56] and the last trumpet resurrects the dead
[2:16:00] in Christ it happens that the last truth
[2:16:02] doesn't it there is an Elijah a prophet
[2:16:06] to the Gentiles that calls us from
[2:16:08] traditions and points us back to the
[2:16:11] true atonement now it isn't that God
[2:16:15] makes a new atonement but rather that he
[2:16:19] simply changes our attitude in our view
[2:16:22] of the atonement in other words veils of
[2:16:26] tradition now because there's no wooly
[2:16:29] veil over this one or no no big heavy
[2:16:31] veil but it's a heavy veil of traditions
[2:16:34] of man that have been put on over the
[2:16:37] atonement over the mercy seat but in
[2:16:41] this day God sends a message come on
[2:16:44] to unveil that God not to take away the
[2:16:49] mercy see but to reveal the mercy seat
[2:16:53] not to take away the blood but to point
[2:16:56] us back to the bad hallelujah bringing
[2:17:03] us back to the atonement you know what
[2:17:07] this will do with Israel it will cause
[2:17:09] them to go into a state of repentance
[2:17:12] those Jews were lured hey man they were
[2:17:18] more morena to you in the Bible but you
[2:17:22] see this is this is why Italy oh to see
[2:17:24] an age that zeal of the hour is to
[2:17:27] repent allow the traditions to move back
[2:17:35] where you can see the real atonement now
[2:17:42] the atonement which is also known as Yom
[2:17:47] Kippur which is some in Leviticus 23 27
[2:17:51] that it provides the day of confession
[2:17:54] is the highest of all holy days that on
[2:17:59] the tenth day of the seventh month shall
[2:18:01] be a day of atonement so it would happen
[2:18:05] as the Gentiles are having their last
[2:18:07] church age it would it would it would
[2:18:11] bring them bring us to where the Jews
[2:18:14] will come into a day of atonement it
[2:18:17] also brings us to an atonement it shall
[2:18:20] be a holy convocation unto you and you
[2:18:23] shall afflict your souls and offer an
[2:18:26] offering made by fire unto the Lord so
[2:18:30] the Jews have been called back in their
[2:18:32] homeland to recognize the atonement or
[2:18:35] what the lamb has done for them what
[2:18:40] he's already done now remember coming
[2:18:43] back to this atonement it doesn't it
[2:18:47] doesn't reveal to us some new form of
[2:18:49] healing some new salvation it just
[2:18:52] reveals to us what he's already done hey
[2:18:58] ma'am healing is something he already
[2:19:01] did you just got to realize the
[2:19:04] atonement provided and then salvation is
[2:19:08] something he's already did and then you
[2:19:11] come in to the altar he's only accepting
[2:19:13] what he already did are you with me so
[2:19:16] now again the Bible said it will mourn
[2:19:19] for the one day appear so let's go to
[2:19:21] Zechariah 12 in verse 10 amen
[2:19:27] and I will pour upon the house of David
[2:19:30] and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the
[2:19:33] spirit of grace Oh hallelujah the
[2:19:37] returns in the atonement pours out the
[2:19:40] spirit of grace amen not the spirit of
[2:19:45] no mercy come on church not judgment but
[2:19:49] the spirit of grace are you with me I
[2:19:52] pour upon the house and David on the
[2:19:54] inhabitants aru's the spirit of grace
[2:19:56] and of supplication and they shall look
[2:19:59] upon me whom they have pierced and they
[2:20:06] shall mourn for him as one that mourneth
[2:20:09] for his only certainty and shall be and
[2:20:11] bitterness for him as one that is in
[2:20:14] bitterness for his first bond and that
[2:20:17] day there should be a great mourning in
[2:20:19] Jerusalem as a morning of had women in
[2:20:22] the valley of megiddo and the land shall
[2:20:25] mourn every family apart the family of
[2:20:29] the house of David apart their wives
[2:20:31] apart the family of the house of Nathan
[2:20:33] apart their wives apart the family of
[2:20:35] the house to leave our partner wives
[2:20:37] apart and the family of Semmy our
[2:20:39] partner wives apart and all the families
[2:20:42] that remain every family apart and their
[2:20:46] wives apart they're just going to go
[2:20:49] into mourning when they realize oh we
[2:20:52] killed the Messiah now Church that's no
[2:20:59] different from you we Gentiles we come
[2:21:04] back to the homeland the Bible to the
[2:21:06] original atonements not something of
[2:21:08] geese and ducks and everything else you
[2:21:11] are insignificant
[2:21:12] offerings but it's a time to afflict our
[2:21:15] souls it's a time of mourning and
[2:21:19] realize my sins put him on the cross
[2:21:24] that's what really salvation it is when
[2:21:28] you realize yourself I'll pick this
[2:21:32] see that for me ma'am he was wounded for
[2:21:36] my transgressions
[2:21:37] I had senseless he took my penis he
[2:21:41] didn't deserve the beatings he got he
[2:21:44] took mine by this I'm healed delivered I
[2:22:00] say what a mighty God I said what a
[2:22:03] savior so here we come back to flicked
[2:22:09] our souls with Gentiles why we made
[2:22:13] three gods out of one we took a we took
[2:22:16] a Trinity baptism instead of the only
[2:22:18] way they baptized in a Bible which is in
[2:22:20] the name of Jesus Christ there's not one
[2:22:22] place in the entire Bible where anybody
[2:22:25] was ever baptized in any other way than
[2:22:27] in the name of Jesus Christ we come back
[2:22:32] to the original atonement we come back
[2:22:36] it's a day of repentance where we
[2:22:37] realize I was wrong that I realize now
[2:22:41] all my chickens and ducks now listen
[2:22:45] when they come they're gonna look at
[2:22:47] these red heifers so that won't do no
[2:22:48] good that lamb won't do no good this
[2:22:51] menorah won't do no good
[2:22:52] none of this Sevilla's any value there's
[2:22:55] only one thing that's a value and that's
[2:22:57] a lamb the one we pierced and it will be
[2:23:02] to them like chickens and ducks
[2:23:06] worthless as a sign atonement are you
[2:23:11] with me
[2:23:11] and that's how creeds and dogmas were
[2:23:15] they never provided anything they were
[2:23:19] worthless as chickens and geese to take
[2:23:22] away our sins or to change our lives
[2:23:26] that shows you how worthless he
[2:23:28] so-called revelations are that have no
[2:23:31] acceptable blood to provide an atonement
[2:23:34] a man atonement with our blood is a
[2:23:37] chicken and a duck
[2:23:41] j-man it's a worthless offering it's
[2:23:45] worthless worship it's a false religion
[2:23:50] it's a schemes offering now but notice
[2:23:57] but for the last in the 7th Trump there
[2:24:01] is a profit to appear before the
[2:24:03] Gentiles to call the people back to the
[2:24:07] original Pentecostal doctor hallelujah
[2:24:12] now that's what our message is to do
[2:24:14] produced to bring us back to our
[2:24:16] original Pentecostal doctor back to the
[2:24:21] gospel Paul preached a ma'am now in
[2:24:26] revelation 11 we find the Ministry of
[2:24:29] Moses and Elijah calling the Israel out
[2:24:33] of Jewish tradition it's just the same
[2:24:35] as a message called a bride out of
[2:24:37] Pentecostal tradition and remember Moses
[2:24:41] and Elijah to call Israel out of their
[2:24:44] old atonement of the lamb sheep and
[2:24:46] blood and goats and sacrifice to the
[2:24:48] real living sacrifice to the world a man
[2:24:53] so even as their last prophet reveals
[2:24:56] Christ to the Jews I last seal reveals
[2:25:00] Christ to the Gentiles
[2:25:02] it breaks the silence of what he's been
[2:25:05] doing for the seven ages no and it's to
[2:25:08] call the bride out of Pentecostal world
[2:25:11] it can rug tradition to the genuine
[2:25:14] atonement not not a new atonement but a
[2:25:17] genuine attempt now bear with me just a
[2:25:20] moment now I want you to us to realize
[2:25:23] you see as a brother branham and say let
[2:25:26] me just share you this quote because
[2:25:27] this is where I'm gonna jump off from
[2:25:29] and the seven angels message under the
[2:25:33] same trumpet same everything exactly the
[2:25:36] same seventh seal as to what call the
[2:25:39] people the bride out of Pentecostal and
[2:25:43] world tradition
[2:25:45] now call about a tradition long-standing
[2:25:47] traditions of having bishops and Pope's
[2:25:49] and and hierarchies and and overlords
[2:25:53] and overseers and and pastors for head
[2:25:56] and all these other thing are you with
[2:25:58] me to bring you back to the headship of
[2:26:01] Christ the word a man to the genuine
[2:26:05] atonement the word Christ has he said he
[2:26:08] says impersonated it's for sana fide in
[2:26:10] his word here made flesh among us
[2:26:12] science proved it by pictures the church
[2:26:15] knows it the world around we firmly saw
[2:26:17] it we firmly know it for he never told
[2:26:20] us one thing and thus said the Lord but
[2:26:22] what has been the truth is that right is
[2:26:25] that right hey man what has been de but
[2:26:29] we every time it was been the truth he
[2:26:33] did not I say down there on the river as
[2:26:35] John the Baptist was sent so will this
[2:26:40] message now I want you to stop a moment
[2:26:48] let's reflect we're at the end of the
[2:26:50] year now but let's reflect back even
[2:26:54] more let's go beyond these years let's
[2:26:58] go back to the Ohio River for the 1933
[2:27:04] the angel of God came down before
[2:27:08] hundreds of people a light a voice rang
[2:27:12] out as john the baptist was sent to
[2:27:15] forerun the first coming of christ
[2:27:17] you're sent with a message to forerun
[2:27:20] the second coming of Christ
[2:27:22] I'm going to say it it's not in vain
[2:27:28] hey man the word has come but it's going
[2:27:31] to be more than the word there's coming
[2:27:34] down coming to the almighty the corporal
[2:27:37] return of Jesus Christ and we're right
[2:27:40] here hey man oh it could be in these
[2:27:43] next few hours it could be next year I
[2:27:45] don't know when it will be but I know
[2:27:48] this I want to live today as if he were
[2:27:50] coming today cuz he's coming for
[2:27:54] somebody oh man but that's John the
[2:27:57] Baptist now I want you to look again
[2:27:59] think again what happened with Jack Nora
[2:28:02] now that was right here live Tabernacle
[2:28:04] I went there as a boy you know we got
[2:28:07] people that were in those meetings raise
[2:28:10] your hands raise your hands that was in
[2:28:12] the 1 2 3 4 you know and then myself
[2:28:16] there was an amine brother different
[2:28:19] ones it was in that meeting no you know
[2:28:24] I know I was there
[2:28:27] I was in there I was I was there I was
[2:28:31] there on the wings of us no I dove I
[2:28:34] heard the wondrous things I I witness
[2:28:38] many their eye witness people that I
[2:28:41] knew people that I laid my head on her
[2:28:44] lap as a young boy being called out told
[2:28:48] her name what does condition was the
[2:28:52] situations that they were in I saw the
[2:28:54] Messiah kind but Jack Nora was even more
[2:28:58] privileged than I him and Gordon Lindsay
[2:29:02] they saw the atonement coming in full
[2:29:07] effect are you with me
[2:29:11] the same atonement the originally told
[2:29:15] me they saw it coming in full effect I
[2:29:18] know I ain't got time for all of this
[2:29:20] let me just hit some points just a
[2:29:22] moment Jack Moore would scream out human
[2:29:27] him and and and Gordon Lindsey would
[2:29:31] write which is now a book of history in
[2:29:34] a messy and a book called man sent from
[2:29:36] God and I knew Jack more upset during
[2:29:39] his
[2:29:39] certs have listened to service at preach
[2:29:41] I've heard him speak and Jack more
[2:29:43] Reuters account and the him along with
[2:29:46] Gordon Lindsey and they screamed out
[2:29:48] Bible days are here again why because
[2:29:53] they were seeing the atonement coming in
[2:29:57] full effect
[2:29:59] free of creeds and dogmas amend not bad
[2:30:05] not being brought by denominational
[2:30:07] preacher who was who was veiled with
[2:30:10] some is immerse ISM but oh one who was
[2:30:13] commissioned by God to break the veil of
[2:30:16] tradition well that we could see the
[2:30:19] atonement in full effect he would scream
[2:30:31] out he raped his account as he screamed
[2:30:35] out as people came from all over the
[2:30:38] hills came to them his meetings come to
[2:30:43] the meetings on the first evening
[2:30:45] brother Brandon's visit there he said in
[2:30:47] our large frame Tabernacle this building
[2:30:51] was so congested we could hardly get in
[2:30:54] that had never happened on the first
[2:30:56] night of any meeting but this was a
[2:30:57] Branham meeting it was a steady stream
[2:31:00] of traffic that had wound its way
[2:31:02] through Arkansas yields and Louisiana
[2:31:04] valleys that day reverently tracing the
[2:31:07] path of this twentieth century prophet
[2:31:09] whose prayers
[2:31:10] oh listen whose prayers the listened his
[2:31:15] prayers was what on the atonement to the
[2:31:21] back come on to the sacrifice to the
[2:31:26] Lamb of God whose prayers could cause
[2:31:30] diseases to be accursed broken homes to
[2:31:35] be reunited drunken father's to repent
[2:31:39] prodigal sons to return feuding churches
[2:31:43] to stack arms and make peace and
[2:31:45] lukewarm Christians to be rekindled by
[2:31:48] the fire of their first love
[2:31:51] that's what happens when you get your
[2:31:54] eyes back on the atonement a man it'll
[2:31:57] cause fathers to repent and prodigal
[2:32:01] sons to return and broken homes to be
[2:32:04] reunited and food in turn sister stop
[2:32:07] harms and make peace and lukewarm
[2:32:09] Christians to be rekindled by the fire
[2:32:12] of God
[2:32:13] I say God let us look beyond the crease
[2:32:16] let us look beyond the tradition let's
[2:32:19] see the mighty garden veiled and that's
[2:32:22] what I happened when you gaze on him
[2:32:25] when your gaze turns off the men in my
[2:32:30] church and my kingdom and my dissin my
[2:32:33] dad and we're the great one and he
[2:32:36] becomes the great one I say they went on
[2:32:42] to say yes Bible days are here again
[2:32:45] here's a man who practice what we preach
[2:32:49] and I'm gonna just come back around to
[2:32:52] this right now it's time we start
[2:32:54] practicing what we preach that we don't
[2:32:58] just talk about a God of healing we
[2:33:00] practice bringing a God of healing on
[2:33:04] the scene so we don't just preach a
[2:33:09] revival we are the revival then we don't
[2:33:13] just preach submissive but we become the
[2:33:17] life of this word lift out of our lives
[2:33:21] oh I wish you'd get with me in my last
[2:33:24] sermon this year pour your heart into it
[2:33:27] a man may it be said we're a church that
[2:33:33] practice is what we preach we don't only
[2:33:36] preach the glorious salvation with the
[2:33:40] provenance of the Holy Ghost but we
[2:33:42] practice that we'd only only preach the
[2:33:44] promise of divine healing saying God can
[2:33:47] but we practice that knowing that God
[2:33:50] will hey man how many would like to see
[2:33:53] a god that will instead of just a God
[2:33:56] that can
[2:33:57] oh man it's time that we look to a real
[2:34:00] living God has offered the atonement and
[2:34:04] it only happens when the veil of
[2:34:07] traditions are pulled back I'm just
[2:34:15] going to tell you when now those things
[2:34:18] happened that affected men of his
[2:34:20] generation men of his generation got a
[2:34:27] look at the atonement and it changed
[2:34:33] their views it changed their view of a
[2:34:38] God that can that a God that will a God
[2:34:42] that was at the pastor God of the
[2:34:43] present till God who used to but now
[2:34:46] does it again I mentioned jack code
[2:34:54] before Jack Cole came under that
[2:34:57] anointing when he saw the wondrous
[2:34:58] working power that came by the coming of
[2:35:01] the message remember is john the baptist
[2:35:06] was sent to forerun the first coming of
[2:35:08] christ you're sent with a message to
[2:35:12] forerun the second coming of Christ and
[2:35:14] that message showed that the that the
[2:35:19] atonement was in full effect full of
[2:35:24] grace full of mercy if it was healing
[2:35:30] and it was deliverance and it was
[2:35:33] salvation everything that was needed was
[2:35:37] in the atonement if you needed it he
[2:35:40] prefer God provided it for it with the
[2:35:43] sacrifice at Calvary come on now church
[2:35:46] is that what brother Tim we're past that
[2:35:48] now know this message brings us back to
[2:35:52] the original atonement it approaches to
[2:35:56] some other atonement it Hortis us back
[2:35:58] to the original atonement to the
[2:36:01] original bad - the power of Christ now
[2:36:08] the message was
[2:36:10] as it unfolded the first part of that
[2:36:13] message now remember this message was
[2:36:15] two 4runners coming and the first part
[2:36:18] of that message was the atonement is in
[2:36:21] effect there's never anywhere that the
[2:36:26] last part of the message is is not of
[2:36:28] effect in fact it points us back to an
[2:36:33] atonement that's in effect now the
[2:36:38] message that was in effect
[2:36:40] revealed that God was a healer and that
[2:36:46] he was healing now are you with me now
[2:36:50] to do this even there was all kinds of
[2:36:53] traditions it was over days of miracles
[2:36:56] are past that only happened in the
[2:36:57] Apostles day God doesn't do that now all
[2:37:00] kinds of traditions even people's
[2:37:05] unbelief clouds it you know that many
[2:37:10] times your own unbelief clouds of mercy
[2:37:12] seat and all you can see is that that
[2:37:15] gray cavern of our belief that foggy
[2:37:19] evil spirit between you in the atonement
[2:37:23] but oh if you could just take the sword
[2:37:27] of the word and cut through that
[2:37:29] darkness and let the bail be torn you
[2:37:34] would see a god rich and mercy you would
[2:37:37] see of God who's presently right now to
[2:37:40] heal you of every disease to save you
[2:37:44] from your sins
[2:37:46] Jack Cove this man's faith would be
[2:37:49] anointed he had scales over his eyes -
[2:37:56] he was an assembly of God preacher at
[2:37:59] the time and remember I only just say
[2:38:04] something remember Malachi 4 was not to
[2:38:08] turn us into a faithless powerless
[2:38:10] people Malekith or was said to inspire
[2:38:15] us to believe
[2:38:16] and the true message preached and
[2:38:20] demonstrated with will make the blood
[2:38:23] atonement more real it'll turn you back
[2:38:25] to the real atonement now Jack came
[2:38:29] under that anointing and he believed God
[2:38:32] for healing and delivers it it made Jack
[2:38:35] proactive in the new dispensation where
[2:38:39] that the atonement was was being
[2:38:43] reconfirmed remember not a killing of
[2:38:49] the sacrifice but but a reconfirming
[2:38:56] of the atonement then a new killing of
[2:39:00] the Lamb but bringing us back to the
[2:39:03] original atonement and what the Lapp did
[2:39:06] for us do you remember the story I told
[2:39:09] it already several times us this year
[2:39:12] bear with me once more but he went to
[2:39:15] meeting as a skeptic it was a man that
[2:39:18] was with note blind he had no eyeballs
[2:39:22] and he had heard of William Branham and
[2:39:27] he'd heard that he could discern the
[2:39:29] secrets of the heart he'd heard of his
[2:39:31] miracles being done but he was a skeptic
[2:39:34] can you imagine a Pentecostal preacher a
[2:39:37] skeptic that God was currently healing
[2:39:41] delivered sounds like a lot of message
[2:39:44] preachers still a skeptic they've never
[2:39:48] seen the atonement Jack scoffs you know
[2:39:53] when he heard brother Branham tell this
[2:39:55] boy this man with no eyeballs
[2:39:58] he told him said you can't see now but
[2:40:02] in three days eyeballs will form in your
[2:40:04] head and at the end of the third day
[2:40:08] you'll come back seeing and Jack sitting
[2:40:11] there said hey bigger crowd as this is
[2:40:13] anybody could say that this man to get
[2:40:15] lost in the crowd and nobody I know it
[2:40:18] so he just coughed he was sitting by the
[2:40:21] door it was the door where brother
[2:40:24] Branham would exit brother Branham would
[2:40:26] walk by him take him by the knee as he
[2:40:29] went by
[2:40:30] just stood there for a minute and prayed
[2:40:32] softly and he said to him you're not
[2:40:36] sick said you're just worn down from
[2:40:39] preaching meetings and don't be so
[2:40:41] skeptical of this you're doubting
[2:40:43] whether this was of God or not I want to
[2:40:45] tell you this is of God and we're both
[2:40:47] fighting the same devil go on and
[2:40:51] continue in your revival for you were
[2:40:53] called to pray for the sick oh he said
[2:40:57] that really shook him and rejoiced in
[2:40:59] his heart to realize I have a part in
[2:41:02] this and then I not only see there that
[2:41:06] Tolman tendrá that is working but I've
[2:41:08] got a part in this and he decided to
[2:41:11] return back to the meeting in three days
[2:41:13] to see if he couldn't find this blind
[2:41:15] boy he found him in the meeting there he
[2:41:19] was blind
[2:41:20] still doesn't blindness could be but now
[2:41:23] he had eyeballs eyeballs had formed in
[2:41:27] his head and he said about the evening
[2:41:31] time he all of sudden jumped up and
[2:41:34] began to run all over the building
[2:41:36] shouting the glories of God I can see I
[2:41:38] can see I can see
[2:41:40] because sight had now come into those
[2:41:42] blind eyes I said and what's been with
[2:41:46] our eyeballs why because there's a
[2:41:48] creator in the atonement hallelujah
[2:41:55] heals a provider whatever that heat is
[2:41:57] he's the provider
[2:42:00] Chuck became so inspired I want you to
[2:42:04] know something he became so inspired
[2:42:07] until he became fearless and faith
[2:42:10] I meant to the point he actually became
[2:42:13] reckless he just said well God said it
[2:42:16] it's in the word so I believe it's that
[2:42:18] I'm an active on it you know brother
[2:42:20] Branham talked to him he said I I
[2:42:22] thought so much and brother Jackson he
[2:42:24] had Bulldog faces to hold on for healing
[2:42:27] he said he would somebody bring up
[2:42:29] crutches he would have an axe their own
[2:42:32] and and or on the platform and for he
[2:42:35] even prayed for me it smack him into
[2:42:37] pieces hey mom
[2:42:42] he said that he said if they wouldn't he
[2:42:45] said if they wouldn't walk away they
[2:42:46] would have to call away till they got
[2:42:48] enough faith hey man he had a little
[2:42:52] anvil there is that he'd settled the
[2:42:54] pulpit there on the and there he would
[2:42:57] use this little handle with a little
[2:42:59] hammer and people come up with glasses
[2:43:01] and then to be preferred for the eyes he
[2:43:04] take them off and he'd beat him with
[2:43:06] that on that angle and sold over on the
[2:43:09] side he was believing God this is how
[2:43:14] much it convinced Jack I wonder has the
[2:43:18] message of the atonement convinced you
[2:43:22] that on somebody how much has it
[2:43:28] convince us that this word is true until
[2:43:32] we become fearless in our pain that
[2:43:36] we're not just satisfied to see one
[2:43:38] miracle but we want to see miracle after
[2:43:41] miracle we want to see healer after
[2:43:43] healer we want to see deliverance after
[2:43:45] deliverance why because our faith is
[2:43:50] back in the atonement you can you can
[2:44:00] search these things out yourself but
[2:44:02] there's testimonies one man was in a
[2:44:05] wheelchair and he came in the prayer
[2:44:08] line Jack Jack was a big man great big
[2:44:12] man you know so he looked down at him in
[2:44:17] that wheelchair and he grabbed him up
[2:44:19] out of that chair and he held him up and
[2:44:22] he said in the name of Jesus Christ run
[2:44:26] and the man crumpled to the floor well
[2:44:31] Jack reached down and he got him again
[2:44:33] and he he picked him up and he said I
[2:44:37] said in the name of Jesus Christ read
[2:44:40] that and he let him go and he crooked
[2:44:43] through the ground again this time jack
[2:44:47] can picked him up again he said I didn't
[2:44:50] say fall
[2:44:52] said Romney in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:44:54] and he spun him around and kicked him in
[2:44:56] the rear and he went off running around
[2:44:59] the build and killed by the glory of God
[2:45:04] hallelujah that was a man whose faith
[2:45:07] got turned whose battle adds a profit
[2:45:12] through this eyes back on the atonement
[2:45:14] and he can make that wooden scripture
[2:45:18] work now you know Jack looks like a
[2:45:24] solved there sometimes his own faith
[2:45:26] would waver and it wasn't Jack Coe it
[2:45:29] was a healer you know there was there
[2:45:34] was one man that was in the prayer line
[2:45:36] it was so hideously crippled up and
[2:45:40] deformed the jack whenever time he'd get
[2:45:44] up Jack Allah sent him back to the end
[2:45:45] of the line the ever time he'd finally
[2:45:53] pray and they'd get up but he'd get up
[2:45:55] to again he thumbed go back to the in
[2:45:56] line prayed again a bunch of people he
[2:46:00] finally gets up to end of the line
[2:46:02] here's this hideous man this hideous
[2:46:05] condition horrible shape and jackman
[2:46:10] finally there was nobody behind him he
[2:46:13] was the last person and he stuck with
[2:46:16] him now and he looks at him and he said
[2:46:19] he prays said god what am I gonna do and
[2:46:23] God spoke to Jack you're not the healer
[2:46:27] I am you know that's our problem
[2:46:31] sometimes we get the thinking is us and
[2:46:35] how we pray but it ain't us he's the
[2:46:39] healer not us hallelujah
[2:46:43] he's the one who's the healer he's the
[2:46:45] one that's a deliverer
[2:46:46] you know I heard of a testimony here's
[2:46:50] some time again you know of a man that
[2:46:52] was in a wheelchair paralyzed he was in
[2:46:55] the prayer line and it went way into the
[2:46:57] night and Jack became weary and said I'm
[2:46:59] not leaving the platform said I can't
[2:47:03] pray for no more I'm physically done
[2:47:05] and the man he said he was just a few
[2:47:09] people from being the next in line and
[2:47:13] you know here his hopes was dashed Jack
[2:47:22] went over there and he said but I tell
[2:47:25] you what I can't stand here and pray for
[2:47:28] anymore people but this is what I'm
[2:47:30] going to do and he draws a circle with
[2:47:32] his foot and he goes all around there
[2:47:36] drawing this circle with his foot he
[2:47:38] said now I'm going to go but Jesus will
[2:47:41] still be here and in every person who
[2:47:45] passes through this circle is going to
[2:47:46] be healed and so he said there they
[2:47:52] pushed me through that circle it is that
[2:47:54] I can't explain it but there's a power
[2:47:56] God that hit me and out of that
[2:47:58] wheelchair I came running all over the
[2:48:01] building years ago and I never been in a
[2:48:05] wheelchair it's time you see a living
[2:48:36] God is in our mess
