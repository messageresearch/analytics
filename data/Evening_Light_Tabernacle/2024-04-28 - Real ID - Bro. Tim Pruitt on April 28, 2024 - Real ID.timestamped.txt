[56:25] Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 and we
[56:29] want to read together this morning the
[56:31] word of God we welcome you today in his
[56:35] lovely name and praying that he will
[56:38] bless you from on high amen Philippians
[56:42] chapter 2 and verse 5 let this mind be
[56:46] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[56:50] who being in the form of God thought it
[56:52] not robbery to be equal with God but
[56:55] made himself of no
[56:57] reputation and took upon him the form of
[56:59] a servant was made in the likeness of
[57:02] men and being found in fashion as a man
[57:06] he humbled himself and became obedient
[57:10] unto death even the death of the Cross
[57:13] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[57:17] him and given him a name which is above
[57:20] every name that at the name of Jesus
[57:23] ever knee should bow of things in heaven
[57:26] and things in Earth and things under the
[57:29] Earth and that every tongue should
[57:31] confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory
[57:35] of the Father God bless you you can be
[57:38] seated amen but may he bless his word
[57:41] today amen we are we're going to speak
[57:44] this morning on a little subject that I
[57:48] as I thought of different things to
[57:50] title this today as we know brother
[57:54] brandham spoke many many times about
[57:56] identification and identified
[57:59] Masterpiece and and different different
[58:02] sermons like that and I I just thought I
[58:05] would speak on this this morning and
[58:06] just call this real
[58:09] ID amen you know we're we're in the
[58:11] Third Exodus and as we have been
[58:14] speaking about the token and as the
[58:17] blood of the Lamb it
[58:20] identified every Israelite dwelling as a
[58:24] follower of the message You Could See
[58:27] Clearly there was a market distinction
[58:30] between the Egyptians and their dwelling
[58:33] and Israel and their dwellings and of
[58:36] course it was the blood upon it that
[58:39] identified it and so must the Holy
[58:42] Spirit and his word be our
[58:46] identification amen that we must be
[58:48] identified in the word and the word must
[58:51] be our identification we must be
[58:54] identified by the blood for we must be
[58:56] born of that blood and we know that in
[59:00] that day the token or the blood was a
[59:02] token a sign or an
[59:05] identification and it identified that
[59:08] the worshipper had slain the lamb and it
[59:11] that of course had previously had
[59:14] accepted the lamb first and then um
[59:17] slain the lamb and then applied the
[59:20] blood as a token as a sign to his
[59:24] dwelling and and that that he was not
[59:27] ashamed he didn't care who saw it he
[59:30] wanted everybody to see it and it was
[59:32] placed in such a position that everybody
[59:36] passing by could see that token nobody
[59:39] had to wonder whether that was an
[59:41] Israelite dwelling or whether it was
[59:43] identified with the message of the hour
[59:46] it was identified by the blood upon the
[59:50] upon the upon the doorpost and upon the
[59:53] the lentil and today you know of course
[59:56] um you know today identification is very
[59:59] very important before you can travel on
[1:00:01] a on a plane or you're required to have
[1:00:04] what they call now real ID your
[1:00:08] identification has to be proven and they
[1:00:11] were use different sources not just one
[1:00:14] but a birth of records and proof of
[1:00:16] citizenship and proof of residence and
[1:00:19] all you know they're they're looking for
[1:00:22] proof that you are who you say you are
[1:00:26] and to say you are a Believer is not
[1:00:28] enough your your
[1:00:30] identification has to be
[1:00:33] verified amen we we're about to get on a
[1:00:36] flight to glory and you must have real
[1:00:39] ID the blood the Holy Spirit of the
[1:00:42] perfect lamb Christ
[1:00:45] identifies that we are dead to ourself
[1:00:47] and we have been identified with our
[1:00:50] sacrifice and the lamb through the his
[1:00:53] blood the spirit and the person becomes
[1:00:56] identified together that you know the
[1:00:58] sacrifice and the believer both
[1:01:01] identified together as as one so you see
[1:01:05] it it shows us that um as I said you
[1:01:09] know that when they applied the blood of
[1:01:12] course that was a reproach in that day
[1:01:14] they uh you know sheep or lamb was an
[1:01:18] Abomination to the Egyptians so it was a
[1:01:21] reproach in that day to take the life of
[1:01:24] that blood and then of that lamb and
[1:01:26] place it upon the doorpost and you know
[1:01:29] that was um uh a scorn it was uh
[1:01:33] ridiculed it was um it was hated by the
[1:01:37] Egyptians but they wanted everybody
[1:01:40] passing by to be able to
[1:01:42] see that the token had been applied you
[1:01:46] know some want to be a secret Christian
[1:01:48] I reminds me of like a couple of young
[1:01:51] men who were in college and one was
[1:01:54] saying man I have been so persecuted for
[1:01:57] my faith the professors the students
[1:02:00] have all just ridiculed me and made fun
[1:02:03] of me and said how about you and the
[1:02:05] other replied oh no I I've had no
[1:02:07] problems I I've never even told anybody
[1:02:09] I was a
[1:02:11] Christian you know really it shouldn't
[1:02:13] be something we have to
[1:02:15] tell it ought to be something that is so
[1:02:19] on our lives that identifies us that
[1:02:23] there's something different about that
[1:02:25] man or
[1:02:26] something different about that woman
[1:02:28] they're not like everybody else there
[1:02:30] there there's a mark of Distinction upon
[1:02:33] them you know and so many wants to be a
[1:02:36] Christian and do it secretly and I don't
[1:02:39] want my associates to know uh you know I
[1:02:42] want to be a Christian but I don't so
[1:02:44] and so to know well you know that's not
[1:02:46] real Christianity Christianity has to
[1:02:50] display its token publicly or at the
[1:02:54] office or on the street Street or
[1:02:56] whether it's trouble around or whether
[1:02:58] it's good times anytime in church
[1:03:01] everywhere it must of it must publicly
[1:03:05] display the token and the token of
[1:03:08] course is the blood and and it must be
[1:03:11] applied and without it the Covenant is
[1:03:15] not even an effect you know before
[1:03:17] judgment fell before anything happened
[1:03:20] they had already been uh they had
[1:03:24] already been redeemed for by faith they
[1:03:27] had applied the blood you see it would
[1:03:29] have been too late to wait until after
[1:03:32] the Wrath had fallen there would be a
[1:03:35] time where you wouldn't even have any
[1:03:37] blood to be applied it would not even be
[1:03:40] effective and seeing the Destroyer with
[1:03:43] those big black wings dropping down from
[1:03:45] the sky like like smoke settling over
[1:03:48] Egypt and there were screams coming from
[1:03:51] every dwelling and every house the
[1:03:54] Destroyer was was was not looking to see
[1:03:57] if they had a collection of Moses books
[1:04:00] in their house it was not looking to see
[1:04:03] that they had Eagle belt
[1:04:06] buckles you know that would identify
[1:04:08] them with a certain group or that they
[1:04:11] were wearing the certain label of a
[1:04:13] certain denomination you know that on
[1:04:15] the outside there was something that was
[1:04:18] um you know a poster that that
[1:04:21] identified them themselves with some
[1:04:22] kind of church but when the death angel
[1:04:26] came and and the the destroyer and these
[1:04:30] screams were coming from everywhere he
[1:04:33] was looking for real ID the proof you
[1:04:37] see the proof that the blood in our case
[1:04:39] that the holy spirit is there and
[1:04:42] without it the death angel of course
[1:04:45] would pack you out now Satan is after
[1:04:49] the
[1:04:49] church he will do everything he can to
[1:04:53] destroy it you know he will use those
[1:04:56] even who identify themselves as message
[1:04:59] Believers to destroy the church you know
[1:05:03] like balam always looking for flaw
[1:05:05] always looking for a fault you know you
[1:05:09] know someone can do more
[1:05:11] damage they can do more damage inside of
[1:05:14] a church you know than what than what a
[1:05:17] what the Vatican itself can
[1:05:19] do exactly right if an edict came from
[1:05:22] Rome that was passed against us you know
[1:05:24] what it would do it caus us all just to
[1:05:26] cling together amen bind together but
[1:05:30] when someone even within our ranks Rises
[1:05:33] against the church he's identified
[1:05:35] himself as a Believer he can destroy
[1:05:38] more than what the pope could ever do
[1:05:41] you see filled with poison he could
[1:05:43] start through the church and picking off
[1:05:45] weak ones it's the serpent it's death
[1:05:49] and brother brandom saw it as a as a
[1:05:51] black mamba instant death and you see
[1:05:55] Satan hates us he's no friend of the
[1:05:59] church he he hates the church he hates
[1:06:02] the ministry he hates this message and
[1:06:06] he'll do whatever he can to destroy even
[1:06:09] and discredit even years of faithful
[1:06:13] Ministry if he can't make a pastor to
[1:06:15] sin he will try to find some fault that
[1:06:18] he can exaggerate where that you know
[1:06:22] confidence is lost in that Ministry
[1:06:24] he'll kill the pastor's influence so
[1:06:28] that his ministry can no longer be
[1:06:30] effective you know there's more than one
[1:06:32] way to kill a man than taking a gun and
[1:06:35] shooting him just kill his influence and
[1:06:38] that's why you as a as Believers must
[1:06:41] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:06:44] Spirit Paul said that wolves would come
[1:06:47] in and sheep clothing using false
[1:06:50] ID and and they would not spare the
[1:06:54] block now here we we even see it in the
[1:06:57] church ages no sooner than Christ leaves
[1:07:00] the scene and the Holy Ghost Comes Here
[1:07:03] Comes death riding in the first age and
[1:07:06] here he comes riding on a white horse
[1:07:09] impersonating Christ you know first it's
[1:07:12] a spirit and and then it gets into some
[1:07:14] of the people and some you know sometime
[1:07:18] you know it even gets in some of those
[1:07:20] that it gets in even becomes officials
[1:07:23] in the church you know Judas Judas was
[1:07:26] seemingly a nice guy he was a sound
[1:07:30] seemed like a real believer and he
[1:07:32] warmed his way right into leadership and
[1:07:34] the next the next move he comes to kill
[1:07:37] with the sword to bring a betrayal and
[1:07:40] and the next move you know his horse
[1:07:42] becomes dark as as truth is
[1:07:45] distorted and and finally when it's too
[1:07:48] late you find out it was death all the
[1:07:51] time you see it's important that you
[1:07:54] know
[1:07:56] who you are and it's also important that
[1:07:59] you know what is
[1:08:01] yours what belongs to you as a Believer
[1:08:04] it's important that you also discern and
[1:08:08] withstand the Antichrist spirit that
[1:08:11] you're going to have to look for real ID
[1:08:15] to see what you know whether they're
[1:08:17] really what they say they are anybody
[1:08:20] can make claims but but we got to be
[1:08:24] real in this hour
[1:08:26] amen you know so it's important to know
[1:08:27] who you are it's also important to know
[1:08:30] that you know who you are and that you
[1:08:34] know what is yours you see brother bam
[1:08:38] told us again that this age will suffer
[1:08:42] in with an identity
[1:08:45] crisis and he would he would call it
[1:08:48] spiritual
[1:08:49] Amnesia that the that the church would
[1:08:52] actually forget who they're supposed to
[1:08:55] be
[1:08:56] and what they are supposed to do and
[1:08:59] what lays within their realm of power so
[1:09:03] you see this would be the work of
[1:09:05] antichrist and and this is what you see
[1:09:08] even among the world today is is a a
[1:09:11] real identity crisis everybody is trying
[1:09:15] to be something that they're not or you
[1:09:17] know pretending going on or you know um
[1:09:21] if they're not something that they want
[1:09:23] to be well then they will paint
[1:09:25] theirself up like a barn to prend there
[1:09:28] something else it's it's it's an age of
[1:09:31] where you know true identity is really
[1:09:35] lost and people are in an identity
[1:09:38] crisis so you see it's it's a is a time
[1:09:42] where you know uh where as brother
[1:09:45] brandham described this Amnesia he said
[1:09:47] a man or woman could get it and and um
[1:09:50] you know they still have the same
[1:09:52] education the same background
[1:09:55] same knowledge and things that they had
[1:09:58] as far as that but they don't know where
[1:10:00] it came from and don't know who they are
[1:10:02] don't know where they belong and of
[1:10:04] course that's Amnesia and sometimes we
[1:10:07] forget who we
[1:10:10] are and sometimes in doing so we'll
[1:10:14] forget even who people that we love
[1:10:20] are sort of like the elderly man who was
[1:10:22] telling about a good restaurant
[1:10:25] and he he had just went to it the day
[1:10:27] before and someone asked him well what
[1:10:29] was the name of the restaurant and he
[1:10:31] tried and tried and tried to remember
[1:10:33] and he said well finally he said well
[1:10:35] you know you'll have to help me here
[1:10:36] said um um um let's see um what what
[1:10:40] what's the name of that flower that
[1:10:42] smells so good you know they give it at
[1:10:44] Valentine's and someone said a rose yeah
[1:10:48] yeah that's it so then he called out to
[1:10:51] his wife said hey Rose what's the name
[1:10:53] of that restaurant we ate at yesterday
[1:10:58] you see that's a horrible thing when you
[1:11:01] can't even remember who your wife is or
[1:11:05] which are your
[1:11:06] children it gets in you know where that
[1:11:09] you can't identify you know you have
[1:11:11] this memory lost and and I find with
[1:11:15] every move of God Through the Ages they
[1:11:18] start out with a youthful
[1:11:21] Vision but as the movement ages they
[1:11:25] forget why they
[1:11:27] sacrificed they forget why they even
[1:11:31] separated and and become this
[1:11:33] consecrated group they forget the glory
[1:11:36] and The Wonder of what God had done
[1:11:39] among them and then it becomes difficult
[1:11:42] to remember when we had when we had a
[1:11:45] god of Miracles and we forget the
[1:11:48] outpouring of the spirit and how it was
[1:11:52] to feel His blessings and know his power
[1:11:55] and we forget the excitement and the joy
[1:11:59] of the word being revealed and it just
[1:12:01] becomes uh you know it's a secondary or
[1:12:04] nothing to us you know it's kind of like
[1:12:07] the Methodist movement it forgot the
[1:12:10] sawest trail where men wallered in their
[1:12:13] te tears they forgot how the spirit
[1:12:16] moved and until men and women would
[1:12:18] actually fate be so overcome by the
[1:12:22] power of God until they would pour water
[1:12:24] on them and soon it became just a form
[1:12:29] of I believe to the message I I
[1:12:32] subscribed to the Methodist beliefs and
[1:12:35] that's what we are and it became just a
[1:12:37] formal religion and they forgot their
[1:12:42] Beginnings they they forgot the you know
[1:12:45] the what the men who were persecuted to
[1:12:48] John Wesley who would who would stand
[1:12:50] and preach and and the power of which it
[1:12:53] was preached and he
[1:12:55] they've so forgot it until that even in
[1:12:58] Methodist churches the preachers no
[1:13:00] longer preach with that same power they
[1:13:03] lost that power they lost the identity
[1:13:08] that they originally had when they
[1:13:09] started out and they become just another
[1:13:12] formal religion and another daughter to
[1:13:15] the you know it's an awful thing
[1:13:18] when we when we think about movements as
[1:13:21] they Age and what happens to them and
[1:13:24] and how they forget where they come from
[1:13:28] how that God moved how the angel of the
[1:13:31] Lord was present how the pillar of fire
[1:13:35] was there and then when it goes missing
[1:13:38] from the church they give you know well
[1:13:40] you know that that's just the way that
[1:13:42] it is they they forget what they used to
[1:13:47] be and they lose their original
[1:13:51] identity and they take on a another
[1:13:54] identity an identity of another movement
[1:13:57] of another with a form of godliness that
[1:14:00] denies the power thereof you know you
[1:14:04] know again men can get in this in such a
[1:14:07] way that when they will uh when they
[1:14:09] drift away from God you remember there
[1:14:12] was a king in the in the Bible his name
[1:14:14] was Nebuchadnezzar who exalted himself
[1:14:18] and and um God let him God let him go
[1:14:21] for a while and then you know here
[1:14:24] because have so exalted himself he was
[1:14:27] brought down he got got to the place he
[1:14:30] thought he was an animal he lived out in
[1:14:33] the wilderness he ate grass like a ox
[1:14:36] his hair grew grew down his body like
[1:14:39] eagle feathers and had a heart of a
[1:14:41] beast in him you see he forgot he was
[1:14:45] King here he was King of Babylon but now
[1:14:49] this comes and takes over him where he
[1:14:52] can't identify with with who he is
[1:14:55] anymore he is now you know in his mind
[1:14:59] the Beast and and on all fours and
[1:15:01] eating grass and and whatever and and
[1:15:04] brother brandham tells us he said that's
[1:15:07] so easy today sometimes what the
[1:15:09] Christian church is we act like the
[1:15:12] world and it shows we got spiritual
[1:15:15] Amnesia because you don't act like a
[1:15:17] Christian you see you receive the heart
[1:15:19] of the world and it causes this so the
[1:15:22] church will will suffer this Amnesia
[1:15:26] because they will be caught between two
[1:15:30] opinions as as brother random talked
[1:15:33] about this and he talked about two
[1:15:35] classes of people and I just want to
[1:15:37] deal with this for a moment he talked
[1:15:39] about two classes of people one was the
[1:15:42] fundamentals and the others was the
[1:15:44] Pentecostal and he said the fundamentals
[1:15:47] positionally studies the scriptures and
[1:15:49] figures out and said we are sons of God
[1:15:52] and they believe that but they have no
[1:15:54] faith with it
[1:15:56] so here's one opinion then you see again
[1:15:59] here's the Pentecostals he said there
[1:16:02] got a lot of faith and they don't know
[1:16:04] their
[1:16:05] sons so here there you know people CAU
[1:16:08] between two
[1:16:10] opinions some on one side over here that
[1:16:14] that positionally they know what the
[1:16:16] word says they know what the word
[1:16:19] promises they know that they're sons of
[1:16:21] God they're born again by the spirit of
[1:16:24] God but they don't have any faith to go
[1:16:26] with it they can never put it into work
[1:16:29] the other you know is claiming faith and
[1:16:32] power and you know and and and the
[1:16:35] manifestation of God but they don't know
[1:16:38] who they are you see you see they know
[1:16:42] the principles of Faith but they don't
[1:16:44] know their position in the word it's
[1:16:47] like a man that's got money in the bank
[1:16:50] and he can't write a check and the other
[1:16:52] man he he can write a check but he ain't
[1:16:55] got no money in the bank so you see it's
[1:16:59] caught between two opinions you know can
[1:17:01] you imagine the poor fellow who has lots
[1:17:04] and lots of money in the bank but don't
[1:17:06] know how to access it he's forgot how to
[1:17:10] write a
[1:17:11] check remember this was Nebuchadnezzar
[1:17:14] Nebuchadnezzar was king he had a two at
[1:17:18] his command all the resources of Babylon
[1:17:21] but he forgot who he was
[1:17:25] that's right amen he got caught he got
[1:17:27] caught there in in and there was in that
[1:17:31] situation acted like an animal rather
[1:17:34] than a king you see again can you
[1:17:37] imagine the poor fellow who's got lots
[1:17:40] and lots of money in the bank but don't
[1:17:43] know how to access it he's forgotten at
[1:17:47] how to write a check the other knows how
[1:17:48] to write a check but he's forgot he's
[1:17:50] air to all things
[1:17:55] oh can can you imagine that I I think
[1:17:58] how horrible that that would be to a
[1:18:00] people who are the people of the
[1:18:03] book who have access to every Divine
[1:18:07] promise amen who who can look and say
[1:18:10] well the word says we're this and the
[1:18:12] word says we're that and here's our
[1:18:14] position and we we're sons of God but
[1:18:17] they don't know how to access the
[1:18:20] power amen oh brother random always long
[1:18:24] he said if I could just get the two of
[1:18:26] them
[1:18:28] together I believe what the that's what
[1:18:30] real ID will do it'll bring the two
[1:18:33] together it'll make you know every
[1:18:35] promise of God is real every promise of
[1:18:39] God is there it was a posited Calvary
[1:18:42] amen it is mine amen the promise is not
[1:18:46] coming it's already here just let me
[1:18:48] right out to check
[1:18:55] if you could ever get the two together
[1:18:57] this is the right
[1:18:59] mind until men and women could realize
[1:19:03] that you that's been truly baptized in
[1:19:05] the Holy Spirit and you have the token
[1:19:08] that you have a right to every
[1:19:10] Redemptive blessing that God promised
[1:19:13] everything that he promised is yours so
[1:19:16] you hold your token that's the Holy
[1:19:17] Ghost over your unwavering Faith as you
[1:19:21] pray and over his word now it's like the
[1:19:24] those with spiritual Amnesia I get
[1:19:27] amazed at it I get amazed at where we
[1:19:31] are as our movement
[1:19:36] ages you know we we forget where what we
[1:19:42] have I I hear some preaching you know oh
[1:19:46] you know cap off the Pyramid of my life
[1:19:49] with Divine love as as if it's something
[1:19:53] coming anden something that lies ahead
[1:19:56] that you know don't put that as a
[1:19:57] carriot on the
[1:19:59] stick Divine love is God's nature and it
[1:20:03] comes by receiving the Holy Ghost the
[1:20:06] Holy Ghost is perfect love and only
[1:20:09] Divine love can be perfect love and that
[1:20:12] has to be God and the token is a sign
[1:20:15] the real identification that the
[1:20:18] Capstone amen the ultimate the Supreme
[1:20:22] sign has come down upon you that the
[1:20:25] Capstone has come it's not something
[1:20:27] that you're going to grow into it is
[1:20:30] something that has been enjoyed to you
[1:20:33] by receiving the Holy
[1:20:35] Ghost amen if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:20:38] today you don't have to wait on Divine
[1:20:41] love to come that's what you receive God
[1:20:44] is love and the Holy Ghost is God and
[1:20:47] when you have been joined with him you
[1:20:50] have Divine love just put it to work
[1:20:56] you got it you can forgive your enemies
[1:20:59] you can love those that hate you you can
[1:21:02] say good things about those who can't
[1:21:04] say something good about you you got it
[1:21:07] it's in you it's possible sir you have
[1:21:12] it amen you have it love will cover a
[1:21:15] multitude of
[1:21:17] sins love will cover a multitude of
[1:21:21] faults amen come on and you got it
[1:21:25] just let it go work you've got the Holy
[1:21:28] Ghost let me see your hands you have
[1:21:30] Divine love release
[1:21:33] it release it release it in
[1:21:37] forgiveness release it in
[1:21:39] healing release it when a sinner comes
[1:21:42] that is seeking God that you love that
[1:21:47] Soul amen you love that so you you have
[1:21:51] such a love for the gospel that you say
[1:21:54] and you cry for the Abominations done in
[1:21:57] the
[1:21:57] city release it you got it you have it
[1:22:03] it's come if you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:22:06] have it use
[1:22:10] it amen well somebody did me wrong
[1:22:14] brother Tim I can't come to church no
[1:22:16] more why don't you just release the love
[1:22:18] you
[1:22:21] got God had to love you when you were
[1:22:24] unloving
[1:22:25] so did
[1:22:28] we amen you see you see they don't
[1:22:33] recognize that the Holy Ghost for
[1:22:35] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:37] you and God who is love are sealed and
[1:22:40] United together as one and you have his
[1:22:46] nature we are not waiting for this we
[1:22:49] have received this we can release love
[1:22:54] love that will cause a feeling for the
[1:23:00] lost love that will have a desire for
[1:23:04] the sick to be
[1:23:07] healed amen it was love that made
[1:23:11] brother randam have compassion for the
[1:23:13] blind man and enter into his suffering
[1:23:16] you see he wasn't just a number in the
[1:23:18] prayer line he was a poor suffering
[1:23:21] mortal in need and brother brandham you
[1:23:24] know kept going looking at this man
[1:23:26] until he had he released the love for
[1:23:31] him he needs shoes my shoes won't fit
[1:23:34] him he's too big for my coat he's in
[1:23:37] rags this poor man you know all he went
[1:23:41] down to all the things he could he could
[1:23:43] do for him and couldn't do anything but
[1:23:46] he had something he could
[1:23:48] release amen you got some love to let go
[1:23:52] of Amen if people let go of their love
[1:23:55] there wouldn't be no criticism of a
[1:23:57] prayer
[1:23:59] line if people let go of the love of God
[1:24:02] there wouldn't be no criticism for an
[1:24:03] altar call they would want souls to find
[1:24:08] Jesus amen they would know that God had
[1:24:11] done something in my life I want it to
[1:24:13] happen to
[1:24:15] everybody amen if you really had the
[1:24:18] love of God in your life you wouldn't
[1:24:19] close the door of mercy and say you were
[1:24:22] the only way
[1:24:24] you got to come by
[1:24:28] me you see Som have adoption is
[1:24:32] something based on
[1:24:33] earnings something that is impossible to
[1:24:36] get something you don't know how to get
[1:24:38] or when you got it something that you're
[1:24:41] working for adoption is the token it's
[1:24:44] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost sure
[1:24:48] if the if the birth is C characterized
[1:24:51] as as just believing or even
[1:24:53] sanctification then adoption is not the
[1:24:56] new birth but a adoption like the Holy
[1:24:58] Ghost comes when a person surrenders
[1:25:01] their life completely to the will of the
[1:25:04] father amen it's you know tell me
[1:25:07] anything
[1:25:08] else when else is it that when when
[1:25:11] other than when you are adopted and
[1:25:13] placed as a son that you get the robe of
[1:25:16] the Holy Ghost that you get the ring of
[1:25:19] authority on your finger that you have
[1:25:21] the power to use the name of Jesus
[1:25:24] Christ amen you see again you see when
[1:25:28] the the Holy Ghost comes when a person
[1:25:31] completely surrenders his life to the
[1:25:34] will of the father and and it's
[1:25:36] spiritual Amnesia to say well I have the
[1:25:39] token but but now I I need to to have
[1:25:43] the power to to become adopted you know
[1:25:46] I I got to have that you see you don't
[1:25:49] know who you are if you have the true
[1:25:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost you are placed
[1:25:54] in the
[1:25:55] body amen you are placed as a son you
[1:25:59] are recognized as a child of God a Son
[1:26:02] of God Amen and I I as I and I quote
[1:26:06] from the token message we have been
[1:26:08] given the supernatural Supreme token and
[1:26:12] all that was foreshadowed has been given
[1:26:14] to this generation has been given the
[1:26:17] token now we have the Holy Ghost is our
[1:26:20] token and it is our identification that
[1:26:23] we've accepted the death of the Lamb Not
[1:26:25] only was Jesus just human life to come
[1:26:28] back on us but it was God himself
[1:26:30] manifested in flesh that brought back up
[1:26:33] on us the adoption of sons that now we
[1:26:37] are Sons and Daughters of God that's the
[1:26:41] token amen if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:26:44] you have been adopted plac in the body
[1:26:48] position amen you have the power release
[1:26:52] it amen amen amen you have the same
[1:26:55] power they had at the gate called
[1:26:57] beautiful that was released at Silver
[1:26:59] and Gold Have I None but I have
[1:27:02] something I've got something I can
[1:27:04] release
[1:27:07] something oh the church needs to realize
[1:27:10] we need to be releasing not binding not
[1:27:14] holding back not binding Mercy but
[1:27:17] releasing Mercy not binding salvation
[1:27:20] but releasing salvation not binding
[1:27:23] healing but releasing healing we got
[1:27:28] it it ain't coming it's here so well
[1:27:32] we'll wait for the persecution well I
[1:27:34] tell you what you
[1:27:36] know the the next thing for us is a
[1:27:41] Rapture not the
[1:27:43] persecution so well when we get that
[1:27:45] we'll have the third pull no we already
[1:27:47] have the third pull we're not waiting on
[1:27:49] it but people have forgot that it was
[1:27:52] the opening of the word the revealing of
[1:27:55] those Seven Seals that put the word put
[1:27:58] the book in your hand ask what you
[1:28:02] will amen release
[1:28:06] it as brother brandom talked about these
[1:28:08] two classes I've always found two
[1:28:11] classes of people one's a fundamental
[1:28:13] positionally he knows where he is in
[1:28:15] Christ because of the word but he
[1:28:17] doesn't have any faith in what he's
[1:28:19] doing he hasn't received the Holy Spirit
[1:28:22] and then I find the Pentecostal many of
[1:28:25] them has received the Holy Ghost but
[1:28:26] don't know who they are just like a man
[1:28:28] who's got money in the bank and can't
[1:28:30] write a check nothing can write a check
[1:28:32] and don't have money in the bank if I
[1:28:34] could get the two together if I could
[1:28:36] get the Pentecostals to realize who he
[1:28:39] is and come back to the real full word
[1:28:43] of God with that baptism of the Holy
[1:28:45] Ghost it set the world a fire again with
[1:28:47] a new Pentecostal Revival well then
[1:28:50] what's wrong with a new Pentecostal
[1:28:52] Revival it we could just get the two
[1:28:55] together if we could just get rid of
[1:28:57] those who have the Holy Ghost to realize
[1:29:00] amen who I am as a
[1:29:03] son amen identify myself in the
[1:29:06] scripture and realize the message was
[1:29:09] sent to me it's not brother Brandon's
[1:29:12] message it's my message amen this is my
[1:29:15] message this is my Ministry this is my
[1:29:18] word and it's mine to
[1:29:21] use amen we need to know and this hour
[1:29:24] sometimes we want to talk about the
[1:29:26] great Mysteries of the word and and yet
[1:29:29] can't figure out how to apply it how do
[1:29:32] I get the word to work for me I need
[1:29:35] healing but because of no faith to
[1:29:37] access it it's like being bankrupt no
[1:29:40] money there no power there that's an
[1:29:43] awful place to be in yeah we used to
[1:29:46] have Miracles but not now we you know we
[1:29:51] we need the Holy Ghost to cause us to
[1:29:54] live right but we can't have it and
[1:29:57] people sit in spiritual poverty because
[1:30:00] we have forgotten how to write the
[1:30:06] check we forget God we forget where we
[1:30:10] come from that's right we forget our
[1:30:13] origin that's right we forget we forget
[1:30:17] our
[1:30:18] beginnings and the god of our
[1:30:22] beginnings and we tend to become then
[1:30:24] secular in our
[1:30:27] beliefs stale in our spiritual walk
[1:30:31] stagnant in
[1:30:32] lukewarm because we forget who we are
[1:30:36] you know it's like Israel of old you
[1:30:38] know God by his grace he chose Israel
[1:30:41] from all the families of the earth you
[1:30:43] have been
[1:30:45] chosen of all the families of the earth
[1:30:48] God chose
[1:30:50] you you are not here by happen stance
[1:30:56] you are the chosen of the Lord never
[1:31:00] forget who you are
[1:31:02] chosen elected
[1:31:06] precious my
[1:31:08] delight his
[1:31:11] Joy come on the apple of his
[1:31:14] eye that's who you are and Israel forgot
[1:31:18] you know what God had did for them that
[1:31:21] God had done that he he had give them
[1:31:24] their choice lands he'd give them houses
[1:31:27] they never had to build he gave them
[1:31:30] Farms they never had to buy he gave them
[1:31:33] food they never planted he gave them
[1:31:37] Wells they had never dug he gave them
[1:31:40] victories they never won he gave them
[1:31:44] Grace they never
[1:31:45] merited amen he did that for his chosen
[1:31:50] people amen the Bible said he found her
[1:31:54] in a field as a little girl sitting in
[1:31:56] their own blood and he washed her and
[1:31:57] cleaned her up and and and after God
[1:32:00] showed all these mercies to her and she
[1:32:03] got rich she forgot about where those
[1:32:05] things came
[1:32:06] from you know it reminds me of our
[1:32:10] nation
[1:32:11] America you know America is suffering
[1:32:14] with this with the same disease it's a
[1:32:16] great this is a great picture of the
[1:32:19] USA because you see we are a great
[1:32:23] powerful people millions in numbers now
[1:32:25] but we forgot where these things came
[1:32:30] from Israel had the same B bad case of
[1:32:33] it if after God had been good to them
[1:32:35] and give them these Heathen lands and
[1:32:37] made them a separated people and
[1:32:40] separated them to himself and he as he
[1:32:42] said I I took a vine out of out of Egypt
[1:32:46] out of another country and I planted it
[1:32:48] over here and I made it grow and I made
[1:32:50] it fruitful but the vine forgot where
[1:32:53] where its blessings come from and he
[1:32:56] says so is God's people in these last
[1:32:59] days has forgot what a testimony of
[1:33:02] being a Christian means and this Amnesia
[1:33:04] that has come upon the people they can't
[1:33:07] identify themselves they forgot all
[1:33:09] about it they forgot his Holiness they
[1:33:11] forgot his law women were living like
[1:33:13] the rest of it I just want to say don't
[1:33:15] take your freedom for
[1:33:18] granted today we have leaders in our
[1:33:20] country that like the vice president who
[1:33:23] is not even connected to America at
[1:33:27] all her mother's from India her dad is
[1:33:30] from Jamaica her family has no
[1:33:32] connection to America to Heritage they
[1:33:35] have been G given Liberties and freedom
[1:33:38] that they cannot identified
[1:33:42] with you see it's like brother brandham
[1:33:45] said to be in America when I'm born here
[1:33:48] in this country I become a citizen I I'm
[1:33:51] identified with this nation all it is I
[1:33:54] am all that has been I am for I'm
[1:33:57] identified as American I I have to take
[1:34:00] all its shame all its Glory whatever it
[1:34:03] is I am identified with it I want you to
[1:34:06] get it he said I'm identified as an
[1:34:08] American citizen than all it was I am
[1:34:11] all it is I am I must be a a part of it
[1:34:15] I if I'm American citizen I'm a part of
[1:34:18] America and he said I must never forget
[1:34:21] this if I want to remain a true American
[1:34:24] citizen I must remember what I am what
[1:34:28] my nation is I'm identified with my
[1:34:31] nation to forget her to or to fight for
[1:34:35] her or die for her or to to stand for
[1:34:38] all she is I must stand for it what my
[1:34:41] nation is I am what it stands for I
[1:34:44] stand for to be a loyal American I'm
[1:34:47] ready to die for it fight for it stand
[1:34:49] for it do anything there is I'm a part
[1:34:52] of it you can't pick on without picking
[1:34:54] on me when you say something against it
[1:34:57] you say it against me for I am an
[1:34:59] American to say it against you as an
[1:35:01] American what they say against this
[1:35:03] nation they say against you for you're a
[1:35:04] part of it don't you never forget it
[1:35:06] when you do then you got amnesia and
[1:35:09] remember you're no more American citizen
[1:35:12] when you can't become a part of it you
[1:35:15] must be what America is you must be also
[1:35:18] I must be partakers of this is my nation
[1:35:21] I must be partakers of what is I am what
[1:35:24] she was I am no matter what she was I am
[1:35:28] still what she was to be an American I
[1:35:31] landed on Pilgrim Plymouth Rock and with
[1:35:35] her with the forefathers I was a part of
[1:35:38] her I rode with Paul R to warn her of
[1:35:41] her dangers if I'm a real American
[1:35:43] citizen I landed on Plymouth Rock I rode
[1:35:47] with Paul Ria to to warn her of her
[1:35:50] danger you know what I'm meaning I cross
[1:35:52] the icy Delaware with George Washington
[1:35:55] with his barefooted soldiers I was there
[1:35:58] I'm identified with this nation what he
[1:36:00] did there was a part of me what I do now
[1:36:03] is a part of him I was identified with
[1:36:05] Washington at Delaware to be American I
[1:36:08] am identified with him and his stand
[1:36:11] crossing the Delaware's fighting
[1:36:14] battles but you look today that don't
[1:36:17] describe the majority of
[1:36:20] Americans what is what is happening in
[1:36:23] our country
[1:36:24] Coles well you know is in what is
[1:36:27] supposed to be the places of Higher
[1:36:31] Learning we have protest against
[1:36:36] Israel we have protest
[1:36:40] against the only
[1:36:43] democracy in in the Middle
[1:36:46] East we have protest against that
[1:36:49] because you see they're trying to do
[1:36:52] everything to destroy
[1:36:54] the very fiber of our nation of our
[1:36:58] freedoms you know but but I want to just
[1:37:01] say about Israel for a moment have we
[1:37:05] forgotten the promise given to the Seed
[1:37:07] of Abraham I will bless those who bless
[1:37:10] you and him that dishonors you I will
[1:37:13] curse and in you will all the families
[1:37:15] of the earth be
[1:37:17] blessed and I want you to say the same
[1:37:20] is true of spiritual Israel the bride of
[1:37:22] Christ I will bless those who blesses
[1:37:25] you and him that dishonors you I will
[1:37:28] curse and in all the families of the
[1:37:31] Earth in you will all the families of
[1:37:33] the earth be blessed do you realize that
[1:37:36] you do I'm talking about you the bride
[1:37:39] of Christ not just here in this building
[1:37:41] but around the world is what is holding
[1:37:43] off the Wrath that is coming upon the
[1:37:46] Earth do you realize you being here
[1:37:49] holds back the Judgment of God do you
[1:37:52] realize here that you are the only Grace
[1:37:55] the world has right
[1:37:57] now and that when we are raptured out of
[1:38:00] here hell will break loose and Satan
[1:38:02] there will come down and take over the
[1:38:04] Earth completely you are the little the
[1:38:07] little Last Stand of Hope for the nation
[1:38:11] for the world the hope is not in a new
[1:38:14] president you are the
[1:38:16] Hope amen you are the hope as long as
[1:38:19] you are here amen wrath is held off the
[1:38:23] holy spirit is here but when he lifts
[1:38:25] his holy spirit we're going to go with
[1:38:28] him and you can tell the holy spirit is
[1:38:31] lifting from the nation it's lifting
[1:38:33] from homes it's lifting from families
[1:38:36] it's lifting from schools amen it's
[1:38:38] lifting from churches yes even message
[1:38:41] churches the holy spirit is lifting but
[1:38:43] I'm telling you this friend I don't want
[1:38:46] to be departed from that spirit I don't
[1:38:48] want nothing to separate me from the
[1:38:51] Holy Ghost when he Le I want to leave
[1:38:55] with it when he goes up I want to go
[1:39:00] to I have decided this old world ain't
[1:39:04] my world let them have it for a little
[1:39:06] short season amen I'm going away and I'm
[1:39:10] going there onto there to marriage
[1:39:12] supper of the lamb and I'm returning
[1:39:15] back with him and acts Revelation
[1:39:17] chapter 19 with him as he shown in the
[1:39:21] power of the word coming back and we'll
[1:39:23] take it over for the millennial
[1:39:26] Reign
[1:39:30] Hallelujah but you realize Israel is the
[1:39:33] anointed of the Lord don't lift your
[1:39:34] hand against him the Bible said in 1
[1:39:38] Corinthians 16:22 he let no man oppress
[1:39:41] them he rebuked Kings on their behalf
[1:39:44] said saying do you know touch not my
[1:39:47] anointed and do my prophets no
[1:39:50] harm amen oh yeah let me tell tell you
[1:39:53] that same word speaks of the bride of
[1:39:57] Christ be careful what you say against
[1:40:00] her be careful how you rail against her
[1:40:04] because to touch his anointed is to
[1:40:06] touch
[1:40:07] God
[1:40:09] amen amen oh you see well I tell you
[1:40:13] what I'm bright too let me just tell you
[1:40:15] something when I was when I was raising
[1:40:18] my family and even right now you know
[1:40:21] but but when I was raising my family
[1:40:23] family my children were all my children
[1:40:26] but one couldn't pick on
[1:40:28] another one couldn't persecute another
[1:40:32] one couldn't hurt
[1:40:35] another they did they had daddy to
[1:40:37] answer
[1:40:38] to and I'm just going to tell you the
[1:40:40] same thing well you know you you cannot
[1:40:43] you cannot hurt one member of the Bride
[1:40:46] without hurting
[1:40:49] Christ amen if you belong to God he'll
[1:40:51] chastise you if you don't but you just
[1:40:53] going your
[1:40:55] way but re remember this brother Bram
[1:40:58] tells us in the Ephesian age he said no
[1:41:00] matter how just and upright a Christian
[1:41:04] is before the public and how gracious he
[1:41:07] is to his F fellow man doing nothing but
[1:41:10] good let him confess Christ as his
[1:41:13] Savior and acknowledge the operation of
[1:41:16] the gifts of the Holy Ghost and tongues
[1:41:18] and prophecies and healings and miracles
[1:41:20] he will be condemned the Spirit of this
[1:41:24] world hates the spirit of God and
[1:41:26] because it can't overcome the spirit of
[1:41:28] the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel
[1:41:32] in whom the spirit of Truth
[1:41:36] dwells so it can't destroy the Lord it
[1:41:39] tries to destroy the
[1:41:42] vessels now Jesus said that signs would
[1:41:46] identify
[1:41:48] Believers here's how you're going to
[1:41:50] know Believers these signs will follow
[1:41:53] them to be a believer you must have the
[1:41:57] true anointing but you see the world
[1:42:00] will hate
[1:42:01] you yes amen like the blood on the
[1:42:05] Israelite dwelling it will be a sign of
[1:42:08] disc scorn of scorn it will be a sign of
[1:42:12] that that is mocked made fun
[1:42:19] of
[1:42:21] hated disdained
[1:42:23] ridiculed that's right
[1:42:27] now let me tell you today we have a new
[1:42:32] Calvary the word of God is crucified
[1:42:35] from
[1:42:37] pulpits Brother bradam talked about it
[1:42:40] he said the most holy places there he
[1:42:42] receives his heart as pierces a new
[1:42:44] Calvary where's it found at in the holy
[1:42:46] places the church where he's crucified
[1:42:48] from the pastors you Hypocrites you know
[1:42:50] better than that I'm not angry but
[1:42:52] something in side of me a Stern God has
[1:42:54] been thoroughly identified among you
[1:42:56] where did he get his fears at in his
[1:42:58] side where did he get his feares on
[1:43:00] Calvary where does he get it today in
[1:43:02] the Pulpit where did they come from
[1:43:04] Jerusalem where did they come from the
[1:43:07] denomination you know every movement
[1:43:09] becomes its own Jerusalem you got to
[1:43:11] come here to get it only here is where
[1:43:13] salvation
[1:43:14] is and that's what brother Brandon was
[1:43:16] talking about the
[1:43:18] Jerusalem the ones who claim to love him
[1:43:21] that's who did it that's who desert day
[1:43:23] his second Calvary where he receives his
[1:43:26] pieres against the word that's what
[1:43:28] pierces who is he he's the word where is
[1:43:31] his pierce the hardest from the pulpit
[1:43:33] in the Holy in the holy places just like
[1:43:35] it was then so I've got a right to I
[1:43:39] indite this generation I've got a right
[1:43:41] to do it as a minister of the Gospel
[1:43:44] with signs and proving that he's God
[1:43:46] I've got a right to bring indictment
[1:43:49] against this generation CA his hardest
[1:43:51] spear points has been right from the
[1:43:54] pulpits where they've criticized and
[1:43:56] said don't go out to hear that stuff
[1:43:59] that's of the devil right in the place
[1:44:01] that's supposed to love
[1:44:03] him and the Very signs Jesus said would
[1:44:06] take place the word of God is sharper
[1:44:08] than the two-edged sword the word a
[1:44:10] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:44:11] heart is called the devil we from the
[1:44:13] pulpits the holy places oh God how can
[1:44:16] he look down just Mercy that's all just
[1:44:18] Grace we we can't do nothing else but
[1:44:21] head for judgment think of it is heart
[1:44:23] is pierces come from the pulpit that's
[1:44:26] where his new Calvary is they
[1:44:31] crucify him the word at the pulpit how
[1:44:34] they do that by their forms of godliness
[1:44:37] crowned from The Audience by scoffers he
[1:44:41] got a crown of thorns scoffers pierced
[1:44:44] from the pulpit crowned by the scoffers
[1:44:47] is he crucified aresh Stripped by
[1:44:51] man-made Creeds teachers of the
[1:44:53] denominations against his word they
[1:44:55] strip it in shame and and condemn it
[1:44:58] Jesus said in vain do they worship me
[1:45:01] and said they in vain don't do no good
[1:45:04] who do they worship they worship the
[1:45:06] same God there was worshiping that same
[1:45:08] God in his first crucifiction and it was
[1:45:10] vain worship and it's the same thing
[1:45:12] today in vain they build these
[1:45:14] denomination in vain they build
[1:45:16] seminaries in vain they have these
[1:45:18] Creeds teaching for Doctrine the
[1:45:20] Commandments of man denying the word of
[1:45:22] God they're guilty of crucifying the
[1:45:25] Prince of Life teaching man's doctrines
[1:45:27] for his word in vain they worship
[1:45:31] me so you see that's exactly what it
[1:45:34] would be so lost the
[1:45:38] identity of the of the Messiah until in
[1:45:42] that hour of Darkness They Crucified him
[1:45:46] I wonder today if it won't even happen
[1:45:49] that there will be those who crucify
[1:45:52] their own
[1:45:55] Revival the Holy Spirit working among
[1:45:59] the people amen and it's not a it's not
[1:46:02] a Revival that's made by man it's not a
[1:46:05] Revival that come from even and light
[1:46:09] came from the evening light but not from
[1:46:10] this Tabernacle not from this church the
[1:46:12] Revival came because Seven Angels Came
[1:46:16] From
[1:46:17] glory and the book was taken and the
[1:46:21] Mysteries revealed
[1:46:23] and it open up to us the entire
[1:46:26] Covenant are you with me church amen it
[1:46:30] open it all up for us every word of God
[1:46:34] word that every promise is
[1:46:37] ours Hallelujah I I like to emphasize
[1:46:40] every
[1:46:41] promise say well brother Tim we don't
[1:46:43] believe in altar cause I said every
[1:46:46] promise well we don't believe in prayer
[1:46:48] lines every promise we don't pray we
[1:46:51] don't believe in in Gifts of Spirit ever
[1:46:53] promise we don't believe on the the
[1:46:56] Thunders and the mysteries of God ever
[1:46:59] promise ever prise belongs to us now we
[1:47:03] realize Jesus said in Mark 16 when he
[1:47:07] sent out a commission that those who got
[1:47:12] the commission would receive a
[1:47:16] confirmation of their commission and
[1:47:18] that confirmation that they were truly
[1:47:21] sent was these signs shall follow them
[1:47:25] that believe amen now he didn't say they
[1:47:28] might follow or they could follow or or
[1:47:31] they maybe will follow he said go into
[1:47:34] all the
[1:47:35] world now people want to chop the
[1:47:37] commission off say it's all already over
[1:47:39] let me tell you it's only
[1:47:42] begun today we picked up where the book
[1:47:45] of Acts left off they had the commission
[1:47:49] the original
[1:47:50] commission and you you read in in
[1:47:53] invisible Union of the Bride where
[1:47:54] brother bradam said that denominational
[1:47:57] Church World cannot take these Seven
[1:47:59] Seals therefore they cannot fulfill the
[1:48:02] Great
[1:48:04] Commission amen it's something he said
[1:48:06] it has been revealed to the
[1:48:08] undenominational
[1:48:10] bride so guess who fulfills a Great
[1:48:13] Commission is now in
[1:48:16] effect if it ever was in effect back
[1:48:19] then it's an effect now maybe down
[1:48:21] Through the Ages they lost vision of it
[1:48:24] but it's been brought back again come on
[1:48:27] Jesus said this gospel must be preached
[1:48:29] in all the world and then the end will
[1:48:32] come amen and this gospel could not be
[1:48:35] preached until it was
[1:48:38] restored God sent a message of
[1:48:42] restoration so now it has to we have a
[1:48:45] commission and that commission is now to
[1:48:48] all the world every creature this is
[1:48:51] where brother bradam would always taken
[1:48:53] every creature and he said if it hadn't
[1:48:55] reached it commission isn't
[1:48:58] over amen we're still
[1:49:02] Commissioned Don't Matter How wounded
[1:49:04] how embattled we're still commissioned
[1:49:07] we got a job to do we got to work to
[1:49:10] finish and and of course the
[1:49:12] confirmation of that commission is that
[1:49:15] these signs was to follow to approve the
[1:49:21] identification so well brother Tim the
[1:49:23] seals are open to us well then where's
[1:49:25] the
[1:49:27] signs well we don't seek them okay but
[1:49:29] they
[1:49:33] follow amen I ain't about seeking them
[1:49:36] I'm I'm about seeing that they
[1:49:38] follow amen when we believe they
[1:49:41] happen come on these signs should follow
[1:49:43] them that believe when we believe they
[1:49:45] happen in my name they shall cast out
[1:49:48] devils in my name they will speak with
[1:49:50] new tongues
[1:49:52] amen come on church this is the word
[1:49:55] that is given to us it is our
[1:49:58] promise we lay hands on the sick they
[1:50:01] shall recover oh brother Tim we're in
[1:50:03] the dirt pool we don't we don't believe
[1:50:05] in laying on the hands that's you that's
[1:50:07] not me I'm in the third pull and I
[1:50:10] believe in all the
[1:50:13] word third pull is the opening of the
[1:50:15] word it's the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:50:18] there not some magic something that's
[1:50:19] going to happen in the future it's
[1:50:21] already Among Us it's already been
[1:50:23] Vindicated it is this message you don't
[1:50:26] have to wait on the squeeze to come you
[1:50:28] don't have to wait till you're
[1:50:29] persecuted you don't have to wait till
[1:50:31] you're good enough the third pull is
[1:50:33] right here is the word that has been
[1:50:35] delivered to you in this hour and it
[1:50:37] just takes somebody to believe it and
[1:50:40] when they believe it speak it and when
[1:50:43] they speak it it'll
[1:50:45] work I don't care how it is if it's
[1:50:48] laying hands on the sick if it's casting
[1:50:50] out Devils if it's speaking with new new
[1:50:52] tongues whatever it is it
[1:50:57] works now the Bible tells us the gospel
[1:51:00] did not come in word
[1:51:03] only but through Power manifestations of
[1:51:06] the Holy Ghost so our message is not
[1:51:09] just a word only message as far as
[1:51:13] letter it is the word which is the
[1:51:16] spirit it's the Holy Ghost taking the
[1:51:18] word and making it
[1:51:20] manifest you see it must must be
[1:51:24] demonstrated so you know as brother
[1:51:26] bradam said now I'm only defending what
[1:51:28] Jesus said he said these signs have
[1:51:30] follow them that believe Jesus said in
[1:51:33] John 14:12 barely verely I say to you
[1:51:35] that's absolutely absolutely I say to
[1:51:37] you he that believeth on me the works
[1:51:39] that I can that I do shall he do also
[1:51:42] and how can a man believe he's sent from
[1:51:45] God and then turn around and deny the
[1:51:48] very commission that God said would that
[1:51:52] would be the identification of every
[1:51:54] person somebody say every person that he
[1:51:57] sent out so he said how can a man say
[1:52:00] there's no such thing as a baptism of
[1:52:02] the Holy Ghost how can a man say there's
[1:52:04] no such thing as Healing The Sick how
[1:52:07] can a man say there's no such thing is
[1:52:08] speaking in tongues and casting out
[1:52:10] Devils when that was the very
[1:52:13] credentials that Jesus pinned onto every
[1:52:17] believer that he sent
[1:52:20] out amen that's the The Authority amen
[1:52:24] now you know you can go to a seminary
[1:52:27] you can go to Bible schools you will get
[1:52:30] credentials and you will get a paper
[1:52:32] that identifies you as having received
[1:52:35] their diploma and you have went through
[1:52:37] their school of
[1:52:39] learning right that's their
[1:52:41] identification but that's not the
[1:52:43] identification a Believer amen the
[1:52:46] identification when God sends a man is
[1:52:49] these signs shall follow them that
[1:52:53] believe that he sent from God this has
[1:52:56] to be the
[1:52:58] identification you can say well brother
[1:53:00] Tim I believe the message okay if you
[1:53:02] believe then work's the
[1:53:04] signs
[1:53:06] amen remember we we have been this age
[1:53:10] this generation has been
[1:53:13] indicted has been indicted for not
[1:53:16] having the
[1:53:19] identification let me read it from the
[1:53:21] indictment he said God proved himself
[1:53:24] alive God has proved that this is his
[1:53:26] word how have you what have you got but
[1:53:29] a bunch of dogmas and Creed how where
[1:53:32] can you show the Living God because you
[1:53:34] turn down the word of life that would
[1:53:36] have given you these things yes sir oh
[1:53:39] wow what an hour that we're now living
[1:53:41] there saying oh I call you Peter said
[1:53:44] you took my Wicked hands and crucified
[1:53:46] and slain whom God raised up having
[1:53:49] loose the Pains of death because it was
[1:53:51] not possible he should be hold and
[1:53:52] through your Creeds and organization
[1:53:54] denomination with your former godliness
[1:53:57] still talking your former godliness you
[1:53:59] denied the power of his resurrection but
[1:54:02] the hour has arrived that the last days
[1:54:05] are here when God promised according to
[1:54:08] Malachi 4 that he would raise up in the
[1:54:11] last day and would turn the hearts of
[1:54:13] the children back to the original
[1:54:16] blessings and the Pentecostal faith of
[1:54:18] the fathers and you can't deny it and
[1:54:21] you can't withstand it now I condemn you
[1:54:24] guilty and challenge you and indict you
[1:54:27] before God that with Wicked selfish
[1:54:30] denominational hands you have crucified
[1:54:32] the word of God before the people and I
[1:54:34] call you guilty and ready for judgment I
[1:54:38] call the same thing that Peter did he
[1:54:41] called repentance of that
[1:54:45] generation I call repentance to this
[1:54:48] generation repentance back to God come
[1:54:51] back to the original truth of the word
[1:54:53] come back to the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:54:54] come back to the Holy Ghost cuz God gave
[1:54:57] change it when he when God said these
[1:55:00] signs shall follow them that believe he
[1:55:02] has to stay with that through all
[1:55:05] through eternity it's his word when you
[1:55:07] say shake hands take communion something
[1:55:10] like that or something some on that
[1:55:13] Creed or something on that idea any man
[1:55:15] any drunkard any unbeliever can do it
[1:55:18] but any impersonator any prostitute can
[1:55:20] do it they take communion have for forms
[1:55:22] and things like that you can do it but
[1:55:24] Jesus said this will be the
[1:55:26] identification these signs shall not
[1:55:29] they may be they will in all generations
[1:55:32] to them that believe in my name they
[1:55:34] will cast out Devils they will speak
[1:55:36] with new tongues and take up serpents
[1:55:38] and drink deadly things it won't harm
[1:55:40] them lay their hands on the sick and
[1:55:42] they shall recover heal the sick raise
[1:55:45] the Dead cast out Devils as freely as
[1:55:47] you receive freely
[1:55:50] give this was our original
[1:55:52] commission we can never forget where we
[1:55:56] came
[1:55:57] from what was originally given to us now
[1:56:01] of course signs and wonders Miracles
[1:56:03] tongues gifts no that's not our only
[1:56:08] identification amen we must have
[1:56:11] christlikeness because you see Devils
[1:56:14] use false ID
[1:56:17] also so they also can speak with tongues
[1:56:23] amen and so you know but remember that's
[1:56:27] false
[1:56:29] ID
[1:56:30] that's amen you see you say well I
[1:56:33] shouted well muhammadans Buddhist
[1:56:36] everything else they shout too that can
[1:56:39] be false
[1:56:41] ID amen Colts Clans everything SC they
[1:56:44] scream holler at a baseball game you
[1:56:46] know again it's a devil presenting false
[1:56:49] ID to try and discredit it the real move
[1:56:53] of the
[1:56:54] spirit amen but but when Christ is
[1:56:58] identified in you you are
[1:57:01] Christlike amen the word Christian means
[1:57:04] to be Christlike and there is your
[1:57:09] identification amen and so we're
[1:57:12] identified with him by living for him in
[1:57:15] our lives now as brother brandom said in
[1:57:19] the message token if it's in you and you
[1:57:21] say well I don't steal and I don't lie
[1:57:23] and well that's just good that's just
[1:57:26] something you can quit you can quit
[1:57:28] stealing you can quit lying a good moral
[1:57:30] man does that I keep the Ten
[1:57:31] Commandments they did that before Jesus
[1:57:34] died amen but the thing of it is Christ
[1:57:37] Living in
[1:57:39] you not coming from external rules of
[1:57:44] Commandments or I'm going to reform and
[1:57:46] do
[1:57:47] better but Christ Living in you and
[1:57:50] Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same
[1:57:52] yesterday today and forever proving that
[1:57:54] God has raised up him up for us from the
[1:57:58] dead according to his promised word and
[1:58:00] it is identification that Jesus Christ
[1:58:03] is living today and we accept his
[1:58:06] sacrificed blood that he gave his life
[1:58:08] the token seal of the Holy Ghost is our
[1:58:10] promise Ephesians 4:30 said grieve not
[1:58:13] the holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:58:15] sealed unto the day of redemption being
[1:58:17] baptized by this token into the body of
[1:58:21] Christ 1 Corinthians 12 now we are
[1:58:24] subject to gifts of the Spirit that's in
[1:58:26] there the world don't believe in gifts
[1:58:29] that church don't believe in gifts but
[1:58:31] God's word says there are gifts and it
[1:58:33] only takes only that token to identify
[1:58:37] those
[1:58:38] gifts amen so you said now so so he goes
[1:58:42] right on and he brings it right down and
[1:58:44] he says now here you have the authority
[1:58:46] of a Believer as an identified child of
[1:58:50] God if Satan puts his hands on you and
[1:58:54] he tries to Temp you into something you
[1:58:56] hold your token in your hands and show
[1:58:59] it death

[1:59:22] a redeemed child of God the blood the
[1:59:26] Holy Ghost is on my life and the Death

[1:59:36] and you can command it sickness flee I
[1:59:40] am a redeemed product of the Holy
[1:59:47] Ghost if you say you're Christian and
[1:59:49] the identification of Christian the
[1:59:52] Bible Christian is not worked in you
[1:59:54] then there's something wrong see because
[1:59:56] these signs shall follow them that
[1:59:59] believe brother bradam preached a sermon

[2:00:05] and he talked about the church again
[2:00:08] what was it they forgot that's
[2:00:11] right here he had been identified among
[2:00:14] them here he was in their
[2:00:19] boat there he is with us amen amen but
[2:00:23] in the crisis they
[2:00:25] forgot they had some
[2:00:28] Amnesia and in that moment they forgot
[2:00:31] his
[2:00:32] power over over evil spirits if he can
[2:00:36] control the evil spirit in the nature of
[2:00:39] Mary Magdalene he can control the evil
[2:00:42] spirits in the nature of that water and
[2:00:45] the
[2:00:47] winds they
[2:00:50] forgot you see he had been
[2:00:53] identified and they had identified with
[2:00:56] him but in their trial in their moment
[2:00:59] they had a crisis an identity crisis
[2:01:02] they forgot he was among them amen I I
[2:01:07] wanted to say this to you the pillar of
[2:01:08] fire has not left the

[2:08:43] something it is good for
[2:08:45] anything take and use it you got an
[2:08:49] enemy amen amen don't don't strike at
[2:08:52] him a little bit hit at him till he's
[2:08:56] consumed show you mean business I want
[2:08:59] the enemy gone completely that's what's
[2:09:01] the matter with a lot of people come
[2:09:03] down to the altar they want to beat just
[2:09:05] a time or two you know and go back to
[2:09:06] their seat listen you know you you might
[2:09:09] you beat a little couple of times you
[2:09:11] know that's might be how much Victory
[2:09:13] you have why don't you beat on it until
[2:09:15] you know that enemy's dead that he he's
[2:09:19] so pulverized he'll never have control
[2:09:21] over me again I'll never be a slave to
[2:09:25] that
[2:09:25] thing amen but you see the
[2:09:28] identification of a scripture Christian
[2:09:31] brother bradam told us over and over
[2:09:33] again these signs shall follow them that
[2:09:36] believe now how can you call yourself a
[2:09:38] Believer and deny those words how can
[2:09:41] you do it and deny any words you can't
[2:09:44] do it you're not a Believer therefore
[2:09:46] signs can't follow because you just
[2:09:48] accept what you want to believe and the
[2:09:50] rest of it you don't believe it
[2:09:53] amen now so you see when the but comes
[2:09:59] the point comes the point that we become
[2:10:03] as the Bible said EAS and Zion we become
[2:10:07] comfortable with where we're
[2:10:11] at and we you know we we we don't want
[2:10:16] anything spiritual anymore we don't want
[2:10:18] nothing to to jar us out of of our
[2:10:21] comfort zone we get comfortable where
[2:10:23] we're
[2:10:24] at so we don't want thus sayth the Lord
[2:10:28] you know we want to just say we're a
[2:10:30] Christian and just go about our life and
[2:10:32] live however maintain our commission our
[2:10:36] our our confession that we're a
[2:10:38] Christian
[2:10:40] until sometimes we can't even identify
[2:10:43] with the supernatural
[2:10:46] anymore now I I want to just say to you
[2:10:49] I I want I I want it be I want it to to
[2:10:53] be where we have sons that are led by
[2:10:58] the
[2:10:59] spirit and I'm not talking about some
[2:11:01] super duper thing God showed me this and
[2:11:03] God showed me that and it's all a bunch
[2:11:05] of hoop
[2:11:07] nonsense but I'm talking about real
[2:11:09] leadership of the Holy Ghost where men
[2:11:12] and women are directed by the Holy Ghost
[2:11:16] and and they can identify with
[2:11:18] Supernatural things but of of course
[2:11:21] When sin disease afflicts us you know we
[2:11:24] we really can't see what God is doing
[2:11:28] the Supernatural and the preaching of an
[2:11:31] ordained messenger from God never stirs
[2:11:35] anymore it get it gets a point that it
[2:11:37] scorned and laughed at remember I want
[2:11:39] you to remember part of the
[2:11:42] Rapture if you study the Rapture sermon
[2:11:45] the first part the first half almost
[2:11:50] half of the Rapture that brother Brandon
[2:11:53] preaches on the Rapture sermon is he
[2:11:56] deals with there will be scoffers in the
[2:11:59] last
[2:12:02] days now I want you to remember
[2:12:05] this because that's very much a part of
[2:12:09] rapture
[2:12:11] hour if there were no scuffers we could
[2:12:14] say there is no
[2:12:17] Rapture because the Bible tells you in
[2:12:20] the last day scoffers shall
[2:12:23] arise so it is a sign it is an
[2:12:26] identification of the last days that
[2:12:29] there would be that there would be these
[2:12:31] times go ahead and answer it hello no
[2:12:34] it's not Jesus hang
[2:12:36] up so you see but but here again there
[2:12:40] will be scoffs in the last days you know
[2:12:44] where where there will be where they
[2:12:46] don't want to hear that don't hear such
[2:12:49] stuff as that they want don't want to
[2:12:51] hear about the power of God and the
[2:12:54] working of the Holy Spirit you know look
[2:12:57] look at the identity crisis that is in
[2:13:00] the world today look at the The
[2:13:03] Rage of the
[2:13:05] tattoos and they're for
[2:13:09] identity you know to show off for to
[2:13:12] express
[2:13:14] Rebellion or to identify yourself with
[2:13:17] some rock group or some cult you know to
[2:13:22] it it identifies as one who says to God
[2:13:25] I don't like how you made
[2:13:29] me you know it identifies you as one
[2:13:32] outside of
[2:13:34] Christ now I believe you can be born
[2:13:37] again repent of
[2:13:38] that and and I'm sorry your your past
[2:13:41] sin marks and everybody will look and
[2:13:43] see
[2:13:44] yeah but I also
[2:13:47] believe I also believe that even our God
[2:13:50] can remove that
[2:13:57] I remember a little girl in our youth
[2:14:00] camp a young lady that came and she'd
[2:14:03] cut herself so many times cuz she had
[2:14:06] scars across her
[2:14:07] wrist and she sat in the Youth Camp
[2:14:10] service and she said I'd love to raise
[2:14:13] my hands up and praise God but everybody
[2:14:16] would see my
[2:14:18] scars and they you know it's it
[2:14:21] identifies me with my past and my
[2:14:24] shame but oh I want so bad just to
[2:14:28] worship him and she just said just going
[2:14:31] to forget about my scars and what other
[2:14:34] will think and what they will see and
[2:14:36] and my past just rais my hands and
[2:14:40] worship him and she raised her hands and
[2:14:42] started worshiping God and all the scars
[2:14:45] went
[2:14:48] away yeah that happened right at l a
[2:14:52] camp it can happen again and again but
[2:14:56] you see they're looking for
[2:14:58] identification you see again your your
[2:15:01] spiritual attitude toward God's word
[2:15:04] identifies you as where you're standing
[2:15:06] you can say all you want to I'm a
[2:15:08] Christian and then you you have this
[2:15:10] attitude about church and going to
[2:15:12] church being subject to a pastor being
[2:15:15] subject to the word of God and you know
[2:15:17] you have this attitude you can say all
[2:15:18] you want to is a Christian your actions
[2:15:21] identify you as who you really are
[2:15:24] you're a
[2:15:28] fake you have false idea you're trying
[2:15:31] to get on the plane with a wrong
[2:15:36] identification you see again because a a
[2:15:39] real child of God can't wait till the
[2:15:43] church doors are open to get in there
[2:15:45] and worship their
[2:15:47] God Amen you see that will be an
[2:15:52] identification as an eagle they will
[2:15:54] gather where the carcass of the word is
[2:15:57] preached because that identifies
[2:16:02] Eagles amen I I just want to say it here
[2:16:05] we we we don't we don't serve up
[2:16:08] something that that has got maggot
[2:16:10] maggot Eden and something of a day pass
[2:16:13] we have the fresh meat of the word that
[2:16:17] is being preached here and where it's
[2:16:19] preach Eagles
[2:16:22] gather amen they gather there where
[2:16:24] where they can get blood all over them
[2:16:27] oh I like it when you get the Holy Ghost
[2:16:29] all over you brother Joe when you start
[2:16:31] worshiping when you start eating amen
[2:16:34] and this amen comes out what is a little
[2:16:36] blood here and Hallelujah and somebody
[2:16:39] jumps about in his seat they're getting
[2:16:41] all covered with the blood and the blood
[2:16:43] begins just just to get they're
[2:16:47] identified with what they are eating
[2:16:51] I'm an
[2:16:52] eagle I don't eat the caring of the
[2:16:54] world so well brother Tim there's Eagles
[2:16:57] I'll eat carrying let me tell you if
[2:16:59] anything will eat if they're
[2:17:01] starved I used to raise register Dairy
[2:17:04] goats and you couldn't get a goat to
[2:17:05] drink out of a mud butle they wanted
[2:17:08] their water
[2:17:09] fresh they would go and smell out of it
[2:17:11] and they had any kind of contamination
[2:17:13] it they'd walk away from it but if you
[2:17:16] starved them
[2:17:21] like the old man said about him you know
[2:17:24] he had a pack of dogs said Well mine's
[2:17:27] expensive what about yours no I my ey I
[2:17:30] feed them pretty cheap what do you feed
[2:17:33] them turnup
[2:17:34] greens I grow turnip greens for them and
[2:17:36] they eat turnup
[2:17:39] greens my dog would never eat turnip
[2:17:42] greens he said I wouldn't either after
[2:17:44] but but after two weeks he did
[2:17:52] starving things will eat
[2:17:55] anything starving Eagle will eat on
[2:17:59] anything amen a Thirsty Goat will drink
[2:18:02] out of a mud puddle I seen them do it in
[2:18:04] Africa I said My Goats won't do
[2:18:06] that I have to change their water five
[2:18:09] times in a
[2:18:10] show because they won't drink it and
[2:18:14] they didn't drink it they didn't produce
[2:18:15] milk they didn't produce milk they
[2:18:16] couldn't
[2:18:17] show so you see you see there again but
[2:18:21] what we have is is is the pure fresh
[2:18:25] meat of the
[2:18:27] word we ain't got the last bull out of
[2:18:31] the Vatican that by the way that's what
[2:18:33] they call it Papa
[2:18:34] bull amen we ain't got the last bull the
[2:18:38] latest bull out of the Vatican we have
[2:18:40] the Holy
[2:18:42] Ghost we have fresh Mana from
[2:18:45] Heaven amen we've got Mana amen that is
[2:18:48] kept in the presence of God in the kind
[2:18:51] of Glory that never breathes worms or
[2:18:54] stinks amen and we are identified with
[2:18:57] that kind of word and that kind of
[2:18:59] message and that's what we want we want
[2:19:03] it where the Holy Ghost is all over the
[2:19:05] word
[2:19:07] [Applause]
[2:19:08] amen now what about our message and this
[2:19:12] messenger are we so set in our educated
[2:19:17] ways and we you know made the message
[2:19:20] for just sophisticated
[2:19:23] people that we forgot how to
[2:19:28] shout we
[2:19:30] forgot how to sh oh they shout at ball
[2:19:32] game yeah they do but they shout at
[2:19:34] church

[2:19:43] but they dance in church too believers
[2:19:47] do amen you know goodness I I've heard
[2:19:49] message preachers scold other preachers
[2:19:52] said if you move two foot away from the
[2:19:55] pulpit that's just Pentecostal
[2:20:00] Showmanship they forgot what kind of
[2:20:02] Preacher Brother brandom
[2:20:04] was by the way I happen to be in his
[2:20:06] meeting so I know a little bit about it
[2:20:09] but here's here's his description he
[2:20:11] says I haven't got very many Pulpit
[2:20:14] manners according to the I guess the
[2:20:16] Theology of the day so I get I get a
[2:20:19] little unruly
[2:20:21] and I think I I jumped on the pulpit
[2:20:23] like that and grabbed the microphone in
[2:20:25] my hand and sat there with my feet
[2:20:26] swinging off preaching as hard as I
[2:20:29] could and I come to myself I I didn't
[2:20:31] know what I was doing in a few minutes I
[2:20:33] got lost again and I found myself down
[2:20:36] in the middle of the aisle rolling up my
[2:20:38] trouser leg I don't know why but I would
[2:20:42] really like to stay there a while that's
[2:20:44] one thing I'd like to say was somewhere
[2:20:47] that I was sure enjoy myself and I lived
[2:20:49] up with that several
[2:20:53] days hallelujah I think we have
[2:20:57] forgot I think we have forgot how
