[39:27] all over this building lord representing
[39:30] needs and
[39:31] situations in our lives lord we truly
[39:34] are a needy people
[39:36] but we serve a great god for our needs
[39:39] lord we just thank you for the healings
[39:41] that you brought in our midst
[39:42] lord and the deliverances and lord the
[39:45] angel of god that walks among us

[39:50] tells us everything's going to be all
[39:52] right god what a confidence that is the
[39:55] lord
[39:56] we just ask that you would take these
[39:58] words and these thoughts lord
[40:00] and our insignificant lord and humanity
[40:04] father under your control and for your
[40:08] glory in jesus name
[40:10] amen amen let's turn to second
[40:14] corinthians 10
[40:15] and also romans 9. amen
[40:19] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[40:23] amen i said it's good to be in the house
[40:25] of the lord
[40:26] amen i just
[40:30] so enjoyed the easter weekend meetings
[40:34] and
[40:35] and the outpouring of the holy ghost
[40:37] upon our lives
[40:38] it's a place we really enjoy being
[40:41] humanity's
[40:42] presence amen then
[40:45] wednesday night last wednesday night
[40:47] just wonderful and sunday as well i was
[40:50] away at brother jason jackson's uh
[40:52] church as
[40:53] his youngest daughter got married and so
[40:56] he was part of that wedding and
[40:58] and uh brother danny steven minister
[41:00] there that sunday had a
[41:01] wonderful time there as well and bring
[41:04] his greetings back to you
[41:06] amen so let's just look at this second
[41:08] corinthians 10 and verse 4
[41:10] it says for the weapons of our warfare
[41:12] are not carnal
[41:14] but mighty through god to the pulling
[41:16] down of strongholds
[41:18] casting down imaginations and every high
[41:20] thing
[41:21] that exalted itself against the
[41:23] knowledge of god
[41:25] and bringing into captivity every
[41:28] thought
[41:29] to the obedience of christ also romans 9
[41:32] and verse 13.
[41:34] as it is written jacob have i loved
[41:38] but esau have i hated amen let's
[41:42] let you be seated this evening
[41:46] i'd like to speak to you again on
[41:48] casting down imaginations
[41:50] and also on the stronghold of formalism
[41:54] on the stronghold of formalism we we
[41:57] spoke on this the last
[41:58] time like to continue this thought and
[42:01] you know
[42:02] as a scripture says as christians or as
[42:05] believers
[42:06] we're to cast down imaginations
[42:10] you know mind battles that comes in our
[42:11] mind and wars against us
[42:13] and and you know maybe different avenues
[42:17] that he can come
[42:18] at you but we know that we are to take
[42:20] those thoughts and those thoughts any
[42:22] thought that does not line up with the
[42:24] word of god is not
[42:25] god's thoughts and so we're to cast
[42:27] those thoughts down and
[42:29] every high thing that exalted itself
[42:31] against
[42:32] the knowledge of god in other words even
[42:34] if our own mind our own intellect would
[42:36] try to exalt itself above the word of
[42:39] god
[42:39] we are to bring it back down into the
[42:41] place that it belongs
[42:43] and bring it into captivity every
[42:45] thought
[42:46] can somebody say every thought every
[42:49] thought to the obedience of christ
[42:52] now we're living in a world that is not
[42:54] obeying that scripture
[42:56] their thoughts and their thinking is on
[42:58] evil continually and they're
[42:59] exalting the things of of hell the
[43:02] things of the
[43:03] of the dimensions of hell above the word
[43:06] of god
[43:06] and and there and and they're bringing a
[43:08] certain atmosphere
[43:09] into the world that we're living in and
[43:11] we can read about that
[43:12] in second timothy 3 and verse 1 and i'm
[43:15] going to read out of the amplified
[43:17] because it's very
[43:18] interesting here it says but understand
[43:20] this that in the last days will come or
[43:23] set in perilous times
[43:25] of great stress and trouble that is hard
[43:28] to deal with
[43:29] and hard to bear for people will be
[43:32] lovers of self
[43:34] and utterly self-centered lovers of
[43:37] money and aroused by inordinate
[43:40] greedy desire for wealth proud and
[43:43] arrogant
[43:44] and contemptuous boasters they will be
[43:46] abusive they will be blasphemous they
[43:48] will be scoffers
[43:50] disobedient to parents ungrateful unholy
[43:54] and profane they will be without natural
[43:56] human affection
[43:58] callous and inhuman relentless
[44:01] a meaning of no truth or appeasement
[44:05] they will be slanders false accusers
[44:07] troublemakers
[44:08] intemperate and loosened morals and
[44:11] conduct
[44:12] uncontrolled fierce and haters of good
[44:16] they will be treacherous betrayers rash
[44:19] and inflated with self-conceit they will
[44:22] be lovers of sensual pleasures and vain
[44:24] amusements more
[44:26] than and rather than lovers of god for
[44:29] although they hold a form of piety
[44:32] or true religion they deny and reject
[44:36] and are strangers to the power of it
[44:38] their
[44:39] conduct belies the genuineness of their
[44:42] profession
[44:43] avoid all such people and turn away from
[44:46] them
[44:47] amen so we see a people whose minds have
[44:50] went to the place to where
[44:51] they no longer can control their
[44:53] thinking they no longer control their
[44:55] thoughts
[44:55] until they they become a very abusive or
[44:59] proud or are arrogant or blasphemous
[45:03] or are scoffers and and become false
[45:06] accusers and troublemakers and
[45:08] and all the things that take but yet
[45:10] having a form of godliness
[45:13] you know that kind of puts it in a
[45:15] different language or a different
[45:17] thought because in our minds
[45:18] we would look at those people and we
[45:20] would think of them as being those out
[45:22] on the streets and doing all the writing
[45:24] that's going on
[45:25] amen but these are actually people who
[45:27] have
[45:28] all these issues and all these things in
[45:30] their hearts and their lives
[45:32] but yet having a form of godliness
[45:35] and you know and having a form that
[45:36] their religion is just
[45:38] a formality it's a a formality i'm i'm
[45:41] going to
[45:42] appease my christian duty you know i'm
[45:45] going to
[45:45] go and do something for the lord you
[45:47] know i
[45:49] it was a it's kind of it's kind of a
[45:51] almost
[45:52] it's so so crazy it's humorous in a way
[45:54] but there was a man that actually used
[45:56] to attend a message church and
[45:58] and he had disappeared on the weekend
[46:00] and they asked him
[46:01] you know what where were you okay
[46:03] everything all right and he said yeah
[46:04] he said i've been serving the lord real
[46:06] hard so i took a weekend off and whit
[46:08] got drunk
[46:10] that's that's you know their their
[46:12] thought of spiritual
[46:14] religion or our religious duties amen we
[46:17] want more than that
[46:18] amen and so you know these kind are very
[46:21] carnal
[46:22] although they put on the air of being
[46:24] spiritual
[46:25] and yet in their hearts they're very
[46:27] carnal and their minds are very carnal
[46:29] but yet on their mouth as they would
[46:31] speak you would think maybe there's a
[46:32] very spiritual person
[46:34] but if you would look on the inside you
[46:36] would see really what the darkness
[46:38] that's really on the inside of them
[46:40] and very you know and these same people
[46:42] are very quick to judge
[46:44] but they don't want to be judged you
[46:46] know they're very quick to see a
[46:48] moving of the holy ghost and god falling
[46:50] upon the hearts
[46:52] of me of love sisters or brothers and
[46:54] they're very quick to look at that
[46:56] and say that's an evil spirit but on the
[46:58] inside of them
[46:59] they don't want to be judged they don't
[47:01] want god to have preeminence in their
[47:03] lives
[47:04] on the inside of them they have all of
[47:05] these carnalities
[47:07] and and this carnality brings to the
[47:09] forefront
[47:10] complexes and pride that is what guides
[47:13] them
[47:13] and yet all in in the pretense of
[47:16] religion
[47:17] and but if their religion is more about
[47:19] themselves and how they think
[47:21] god should operate and if god didn't
[47:23] come through the channel of their
[47:24] humanity or their complex
[47:27] or their human restraint then it can't
[47:29] be god
[47:30] but god don't always work that way
[47:33] god goes beyond our thinking he goes
[47:35] beyond what we thought in our little box
[47:38] as it would be and he goes around that
[47:40] many times and he
[47:41] what we call blows our mind amen it goes
[47:44] past what
[47:45] you know what we can think or ask and
[47:46] i'm grateful to serve a god like that
[47:49] i'm glad i don't serve a god that's only
[47:51] he's only he can only operate the way i
[47:53] want him to operate or
[47:55] he won't only can move the way i feel
[47:56] like he should move but
[47:58] he can go wherever he wants to however
[48:00] he wants to
[48:01] fall however he wants to and god can
[48:04] move upon hearts and lives very
[48:06] freely and i wanted god like that but
[48:08] you know
[48:09] i saw this statement that i thought was
[48:10] very interesting it says formalism
[48:13] is an impersonal outlook which misses
[48:16] the point
[48:17] where the things of god are concerned it
[48:19] actually diverts people's attention and
[48:22] affection
[48:22] from from what's important to what's
[48:25] unimportant
[48:27] it diverts their attention from the wine
[48:30] to the wine skins
[48:32] amen from the movement of the spirit to
[48:34] what to their own feelings or
[48:36] what they're comfortable with or their
[48:38] comfort zone listen
[48:39] god wants you to get out of your comfort
[48:41] zone
[48:43] he wants you to get out of what you
[48:45] think is in order or what you think is
[48:47] church order
[48:48] or you know you know even brother
[48:49] branham would talk about he said i hope
[48:51] you can get out of order
[48:52] just long enough to get long enough to
[48:53] get saved but people are so caught up in
[48:56] their own thinking and their own
[48:58] concepts of what
[48:59] order is and many times it's according
[49:02] to their complexes or
[49:03] it's according to what they think or
[49:05] their own human failures
[49:07] or their own human understandings but we
[49:09] can see the spirit of formalism
[49:11] all the way through the scriptures we
[49:13] talked about it in cain and abel
[49:15] as abel and cain would begin to worship
[49:17] and and abel's offering was
[49:19] accepted by god because of a spiritual
[49:21] revelation
[49:23] but cain looked at that and he had the
[49:25] opportunity to go get a lamb
[49:27] he had an opportunity to offer the same
[49:29] sacrifice because god said you know
[49:31] if thou does well you will be accepted
[49:33] god gave him the opportunity to have
[49:35] that same kind of worship
[49:37] but he refused it and in doing so and
[49:39] not only did he refuse it
[49:41] he would take it and he would take a
[49:43] stone and he would kill
[49:44] abel right there at that altar and you
[49:46] know we see it
[49:47] all the way down to the scriptures we we
[49:50] read about it here as we in this script
[49:52] very short scripture that we read
[49:54] about jacob and esau in in the scripture
[49:56] would say jack jacob have
[49:58] i loved and esau if i hate him you can
[50:00] watch the same spirit of formalism
[50:03] go right on town all the way down
[50:05] through balaam all the way down
[50:07] even to judas all the way down to the
[50:09] church ages all the way down to the
[50:11] ending of the
[50:12] age and we see it though working in the
[50:14] people
[50:15] and and it's trying what is formalism
[50:17] trying to do is trying to stop
[50:19] the moving of the spirit of god it's
[50:22] trying to hinder the freeness of the
[50:23] spirit of god
[50:24] it's trying to put it in a certain chain
[50:26] or a certain box
[50:28] in a certain realm and that's the only
[50:30] way it can operate but god doesn't
[50:32] operate that way
[50:33] god will fall down in 120 amen in the
[50:36] upper room and get them so drunk that
[50:38] people would think they were drunk on
[50:40] some wine
[50:40] amen but see it was beyond their human
[50:43] ability and their human thinking
[50:44] but it was how god had orchestrated it
[50:47] and how god wanted to do it
[50:48] and i'm so thankful he's a god that
[50:50] he'll do what he wants to do
[50:52] even even if it isn't what we want or
[50:55] even if it isn't what somebody else
[50:57] wants but god
[50:58] can move beyond the walls of human
[51:00] thinking
[51:01] beyond the walls of human understanding
[51:04] but we see
[51:04] you know it's amazing we see a world
[51:07] that's so quick
[51:08] to judge a situation and we see
[51:11] it it's not you know it's not no more
[51:13] innocent until proven guilty
[51:15] it's guilty until maybe you didn't do it
[51:18] you know and we see a world so quick to
[51:21] cancel people
[51:22] you know with this council culture and
[51:24] totally silencing anything that's sane
[51:27] or
[51:27] anything that's a sensible voice and
[51:29] that spirit of judgment
[51:31] wants to come into the church of god and
[51:34] he wants to judge the spirit of god and
[51:36] he wants to judge the
[51:37] fruits of the spirit and it wants to
[51:39] judge the manifestations of the spirit
[51:41] and wants to judge it very quickly amen
[51:44] without even seeing what the fruits of
[51:46] it is
[51:50] and meanwhile you know these same ones
[51:51] have sins and unbeliefs and
[51:53] and they have and and they have sins but
[51:56] yet they're holding stones
[51:59] you know uh you know it was a man one
[52:02] time went to a a
[52:04] brother and and actually
[52:07] you know the you know him very well if i
[52:09] called his name
[52:10] and he went to his church on on a sunday
[52:13] and he came from a
[52:14] another church that was real formal
[52:17] and didn't have a whole lot of worship
[52:18] in it and he sat there and criticized
[52:20] their worship
[52:21] and criticized their music and
[52:23] criticized what was going on and
[52:25] you know and again the brother the
[52:26] pastor takes him out to uh
[52:28] to eat there afterwards and begins to
[52:31] talk to him and he begins to open up to
[52:33] him and tell him about what's wrong with
[52:34] his church and what's wrong you know to
[52:36] the pastor
[52:36] you got this wrong in your church you
[52:38] got that wrong and the music was
[52:40] rock and roll and all this stuff and
[52:42] this pastor looks at him
[52:44] and says on a certain certain day at a
[52:46] certain certain time he was looking at a
[52:47] certain certain website
[52:51] he said his head just dropped see they
[52:53] have sins but they got stones
[52:56] and they want to stone the people of god
[52:58] and just like cain did against abel
[53:01] because
[53:02] you know what is it they don't want
[53:03] their sins judged
[53:06] amen but you know as we see though the
[53:08] carnal is once again
[53:10] rising up against the spiritual church
[53:12] of god
[53:13] and is trying to kill the influence of
[53:15] the spiritual church of god
[53:17] they're mocking the spiritual movement
[53:19] of the holy ghost
[53:20] they're mocking the moving of the holy
[53:22] ghost they're mocking the moving of
[53:25] that the god could fall down in a
[53:27] congregation
[53:28] and someone could speak in tongues and
[53:30] someone interpreted they're mocking that
[53:32] they're making fun of that they're
[53:34] mocking amen a man getting up behind a
[53:36] pulpit and beginning to pray
[53:38] and the anointing of god fall upon his
[53:40] life and they begin to say
[53:42] things under the unction of the holy
[53:43] ghost and they're mocking that
[53:46] what is it it's the carnal church rising
[53:48] up
[53:49] against the supernatural church
[53:54] brother brandon would talk about this in
[53:56] the ephesians and summery and age about
[53:58] the carnal and the spiritual
[54:00] and he would talk about the cycle of
[54:01] revival and death has never
[54:03] failed he said you talk about the last
[54:06] move of god
[54:07] and the in the spirit when men and women
[54:10] dressed like christians and they went to
[54:11] church
[54:12] and they prayed all night and they took
[54:14] the street corners
[54:15] they weren't they were not ashamed of
[54:18] the manifestations of the spirit
[54:21] they left those old dead churches and
[54:24] worshipping homes
[54:25] or old store buildings they had a
[54:27] reality
[54:28] but it wasn't long to a time they began
[54:30] to get enough money
[54:31] and they built fine new churches they
[54:33] put a choir instead of singing them to
[54:35] god for themselves
[54:36] they put gowns on the choir they
[54:38] organized a movement and ran it by man
[54:41] oh my they soon began to read books it
[54:44] wasn't fit to read
[54:45] and they let down the bars and the goats
[54:47] come in and took over
[54:49] and the cry of joy was gone the freedom
[54:52] of the spirit of god was gone
[54:54] but they kept with a form
[54:58] they kept with the form but the fire has
[55:01] died down
[55:02] and the blackness of ashes is all that
[55:05] is about
[55:06] lift oh it's a form of what used to be
[55:10] and how it used to be
[55:12] you know i'd never forget it when we had
[55:14] that that family camp over there
[55:16] for the first of those few years and in
[55:19] the nazarene camp and i believe it was
[55:20] one of the very first years one of the
[55:22] men that was working there
[55:23] came and was part of our one of our
[55:25] services and sat there right there in
[55:27] the back and just cried and cried
[55:29] goes out and tells one of our deacons
[55:30] said we used to have services just like
[55:33] this
[55:34] you know they had a marker there on that
[55:35] place i believe it was a buddy robertson
[55:37] that ministered there they used to have
[55:39] the movement of the holy ghost
[55:41] they used to have the manifestations of
[55:43] the spirit but they began to clamp down
[55:46] on it and say well
[55:47] this is out of order this is not this is
[55:49] not what we want
[55:50] they didn't want their lives judged no
[55:52] more they didn't want god moving freely
[55:54] they didn't want god casting out devils
[55:57] in their lives
[56:02] you know somebody wants to say that well
[56:04] that's an evil spirit well i i agree we
[56:06] had some evil spirits here
[56:10] they manifested out in lives but they
[56:12] were everyone cast out
[56:16] that's what the power of god does
[56:19] amen but you see he said he goes in the
[56:22] sumerian
[56:23] church age he says the church has
[56:25] departed
[56:26] from what she originally was she's now a
[56:29] hybrid
[56:30] the church nominal is a hybrid people
[56:33] say i'm a baptist
[56:34] it wasn't so in the beginning i'm a
[56:36] methodist it wasn't so in the beginning
[56:39] now it's a i'm a message believer let's
[56:42] don't make that just a cliche
[56:45] that's more than just a form that's a
[56:47] life
[56:48] [Music]
[56:51] it wasn't so in the beginning instead of
[56:53] the straight word of god
[56:54] instead of spirit-filled men in the
[56:57] church who were led by spirit given
[56:59] revelation there were now creeds and
[57:02] bylaws and educated guesses
[57:04] of educated men learning has taken the
[57:07] place of revelation
[57:08] reason has taken the place of faith
[57:11] program has taken the place
[57:13] of spontaneous praise in the holy ghost
[57:16] oh now we see what the problem is
[57:18] it gets in the way of our programs we
[57:20] want to sing two songs take up the offer
[57:22] sing two songs and have a minister come
[57:24] out we got a program
[57:26] what about the holy ghost let him get
[57:29] beyond your program
[57:32] let him get beyond what you expect on a
[57:34] wednesday night or a sunday night
[57:36] let him get beyond what we think we get
[57:38] so programmed
[57:41] you know we got to get up on monday and
[57:42] do this on that we program you know we
[57:45] programmed on our phones we're
[57:46] programmed on this
[57:47] we're programmed on that program pro god
[57:49] doesn't do
[57:50] programs he doesn't do man-made creeds
[57:53] and man-made dictations
[57:55] and men make dogmas and man-made ways of
[57:58] how to run a service
[57:59] got to go right beyond all of that
[58:06] it wasn't so from the beginning he says
[58:08] but the whole specie has changed
[58:10] it's become a hybrid church the church
[58:14] becomes hybridized
[58:16] will it produce pure christians it can't
[58:19] the seed or the life that brings
[58:21] christians to birth
[58:22] is not in them like brings forth
[58:26] like brings forth like that's right
[58:30] so i mean if you want god to bring forth
[58:32] god you've got to have god there
[58:35] you know a dog brings forth a dog cat
[58:38] brings forth a cat human brings forth a
[58:39] human
[58:41] that can be debatable sometimes but
[58:43] that's supposed to be what's supposed to
[58:44] be
[58:45] humans bring forth humans
[58:48] god brings forth god amen
[58:51] but he says light brings forth light so
[58:54] baptist
[58:55] brings forth more baptists and they act
[58:57] like baptists
[58:58] methodists bring forth more methodists
[59:00] and they act like methodists
[59:04] that's why we see people amen continuing
[59:07] right on
[59:08] they said well i'm a messy believer but
[59:09] they're continuing right on as a baptist
[59:15] they got their programs i got the way
[59:18] it's supposed to be and how god's
[59:19] supposed to act
[59:20] how god's supposed to orchestrate things
[59:22] and it apparently doesn't matter if i
[59:24] come to church when the doors are open
[59:25] i'm a baptist
[59:29] yeah i'm a methodist i got my message
[59:34] but apparently god has changed his
[59:35] methods and this no longer matters
[59:37] you know about our dress and the way we
[59:39] act and the way you know but i'm a
[59:41] methodist
[59:42] you're showing who you really are you
[59:44] may come to this church
[59:46] but you're showing who you really are
[59:49] amen methodists they act like methodists
[59:52] not one is known by the power of god nor
[59:54] can they be for is not there
[59:56] they are known by their ceremonial
[59:58] worship of god and their creeds and
[1:00:00] dogmas
[1:00:00] he's going to talk about a hybrid you
[1:00:02] know the most famous hybrid in the world
[1:00:04] it's been for with us for ages is a mule
[1:00:07] it's a and it's a cross between a donkey
[1:00:09] and a horse
[1:00:10] he's a funny kind of animal he cannot
[1:00:12] produce himself
[1:00:13] he has no life that can do that yet talk
[1:00:16] about work
[1:00:17] he can outwork anybody
[1:00:21] but he's stubborn oh man
[1:00:25] maybe we need to preach on the stubborn
[1:00:27] the stronghold of stubbornness
[1:00:30] amen a lot of you wouldn't be living
[1:00:32] with devils as long as you have you
[1:00:33] wasn't so stubborn
[1:00:35] because there is a power here to cast
[1:00:37] him out
[1:00:40] amen because we got to get beyond our
[1:00:42] stubbornness and our
[1:00:43] our wills and our wants and our way it's
[1:00:46] not about what we want
[1:00:48] it's about all he wants
[1:00:56] stubborn you never can trust him oh
[1:01:01] he's a perfect pitcher good lands to go
[1:01:04] along a lot of ways with that help me
[1:01:05] lord
[1:01:06] he's a perfect pitcher of a hybrid
[1:01:08] religion a cross between between truth
[1:01:10] and darkness
[1:01:12] for the horse is a true type of the true
[1:01:14] believer
[1:01:16] and he says mix them and you have a
[1:01:18] sterile
[1:01:20] formal religion
[1:01:24] it hasn't the seed of life it is dead it
[1:01:27] can
[1:01:28] talk about truth but it can't produce
[1:01:30] truth
[1:01:32] it doesn't have god in its myths yet it
[1:01:35] gathers together it talks about god
[1:01:37] all the while systematically denying
[1:01:40] the power of god they will deny the word
[1:01:44] in the very name of the lord
[1:01:46] and there's never any hope for them
[1:01:49] it talks about religions and organized
[1:01:51] religions how they died they'll never
[1:01:53] come back
[1:01:55] he talks about it and it reads the
[1:01:56] scripture in exodus the 13th chapter
[1:01:59] 13 verse he said ever firstling of an
[1:02:01] ass thou
[1:02:02] shalt redeem with a lamb and thou shalt
[1:02:04] not redeem it then thou shalt break its
[1:02:06] neck
[1:02:06] and all the firstborn among men among
[1:02:09] thy children thou shalt redeem
[1:02:10] he says see the donkey can be redeemed
[1:02:13] every
[1:02:14] miserable sinner can be redeemed
[1:02:18] by the blood sacrifice of jesus christ
[1:02:21] or in rejecting christ be rejecting
[1:02:23] himself but you
[1:02:24] don't redeem the mule there's no
[1:02:27] redemption for him
[1:02:28] there's no blood for him there can't be
[1:02:30] because a mule takes refuge in the
[1:02:32] church
[1:02:33] while the donkey takes refuge in the
[1:02:35] blood the mule has no seed in him that
[1:02:37] can be quickened
[1:02:38] but the donkey has seed
[1:02:46] oh they had seminaries they filled them
[1:02:49] with professors
[1:02:50] who taught the word of god in order to
[1:02:52] destroy it
[1:02:54] he said he read an article
[1:02:57] it was written by an unsaved businessman
[1:03:00] now listen that unsafe businessman not a
[1:03:02] christian
[1:03:03] he said he was amazed at the churches
[1:03:05] and he could not understand them
[1:03:07] he said they had seminaries filled with
[1:03:09] professors who taught the word of god in
[1:03:11] order to destroy it
[1:03:13] now then this man could not figure that
[1:03:15] out he was a paul bite he said that he
[1:03:17] could
[1:03:17] understand the atheists or the
[1:03:19] communists or the free thinker or
[1:03:21] somebody else doing that
[1:03:22] but when the church itself destroyed the
[1:03:25] word of god
[1:03:26] it was tantamount to the premeditated
[1:03:29] murder
[1:03:30] he said there is your hybrid religion
[1:03:32] wake up america for it's too late
[1:03:35] and i'm here tonight to say it's too
[1:03:36] late america
[1:03:40] he said when the church gets away from
[1:03:41] the word it will believe
[1:03:43] anything and when you get away from the
[1:03:46] word you'll believe
[1:03:47] anything is okay anything is all right
[1:03:51] because while you have left the absolute
[1:03:54] without the absolute you have nothing to
[1:03:56] hold yourself with
[1:04:00] that's right
[1:04:05] so going back to the ephesian church age
[1:04:09] again
[1:04:11] he talks about how what had happened
[1:04:14] there they had left their first love
[1:04:18] but he says i want you i want you to
[1:04:20] understand something that the sp
[1:04:22] must realize that the spirit is not
[1:04:24] speaking to just
[1:04:26] the original saints at ephesus alone
[1:04:29] this message is to the entire age it's a
[1:04:33] message to all generation in that span
[1:04:35] and it ke and his history keeps
[1:04:37] repeating itself
[1:04:39] in the generations of israel we see
[1:04:41] revel revival in one generation
[1:04:43] only the fires the fade
[1:04:47] what have we seen we've seen a revival
[1:04:49] taken place
[1:04:51] now it's up to you to keep that revival
[1:04:55] to keep adding another log to the fire
[1:04:57] to keep adding to it not
[1:04:59] not let it diminish in any way but keep
[1:05:02] saying god i want more of you
[1:05:05] i believe that ought to be every desire
[1:05:06] i don't care if you've been in and
[1:05:08] serving the lord for five minutes or 50
[1:05:11] years 100 years whatever it is
[1:05:13] every day ought to say god i want more
[1:05:15] of you
[1:05:17] amen i've got to have more of you i i
[1:05:20] got to have more of you revealed unto me
[1:05:24] he said well you'd see it burn down and
[1:05:26] god would like to fire again and
[1:05:29] go on you start out with truly born
[1:05:32] again believers the next generation
[1:05:34] comes along
[1:05:35] they're no longer just plain christians
[1:05:37] they've taken on a name
[1:05:38] baptist methodists they're not
[1:05:40] christians
[1:05:41] so you have to be born of the will of
[1:05:43] god not the will of man but you said
[1:05:44] these folks are
[1:05:45] all coming together now by the will of
[1:05:47] man he said well what happens
[1:05:50] the original fire had died down
[1:05:53] the fervent desire to please god was
[1:05:55] gone
[1:05:56] the passion to know his word was gone
[1:06:00] the cry for the reaching out in the
[1:06:02] spirit
[1:06:05] god i want you to move i i need you to
[1:06:08] cry
[1:06:09] for reaching out in the spirit it all
[1:06:10] begins to fade and instead of that
[1:06:12] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:06:14] god
[1:06:15] it's cooled off and become formal
[1:06:18] that's what happened back there in the
[1:06:20] ephesians they were getting a bit formal
[1:06:22] the abandonment to god was dying out and
[1:06:25] people were beginning to
[1:06:26] be too careful about what the world
[1:06:29] thought of them instead of what god
[1:06:30] thought about them
[1:06:35] and it's very easy when you see people
[1:06:37] that's worried about what the world
[1:06:38] thinks about them
[1:06:40] sisters start painting their face start
[1:06:42] cutting their hair
[1:06:44] men start wearing these all kind of fads
[1:06:47] and fashion why because you're worried
[1:06:48] about what the world thinks about you
[1:06:51] not about what god you're you don't
[1:06:53] paint your face to go meet god
[1:06:56] you do it to meet men
[1:07:02] but we get to where we care less about
[1:07:04] what god cares about us and more what
[1:07:06] the world cares about us
[1:07:08] and it shows in our attitude and so you
[1:07:11] know you
[1:07:12] think well my kids my kids are doing
[1:07:14] these things what
[1:07:16] where did it come from
[1:07:20] you know i was challenging a church one
[1:07:22] time i said you know you want your
[1:07:23] children to have spiritual worship and
[1:07:25] to worship god and to live for god
[1:07:27] i said that all starts with you parents
[1:07:32] and your attitude towards christ will
[1:07:34] have an everlasting effect upon your
[1:07:36] children
[1:07:38] but when mamas are going around what
[1:07:40] daddy says and destroying the structures
[1:07:42] of home
[1:07:42] amen you can't expect anything different
[1:07:46] the bars have come down and satan is
[1:07:48] coming into your home
[1:07:53] when it thinks more of conforming to the
[1:07:55] world instead of conforming to god
[1:07:57] it isn't long until you see them stop
[1:07:59] doing things they used to do
[1:08:00] and start doing things they wouldn't do
[1:08:02] initially they change their manner of
[1:08:04] dress
[1:08:05] their attitudes and their behavior they
[1:08:07] get lacks which that's what ephesus
[1:08:09] means
[1:08:10] relax drifting we're going back to our
[1:08:13] scripture here
[1:08:15] jacob have i loved esau have i hated why
[1:08:18] was this
[1:08:20] before these boys was even born
[1:08:24] god saw what was there on the inside of
[1:08:26] them
[1:08:28] amen the the the placing that was there
[1:08:31] and the seed that was there and jacob
[1:08:34] was born with this
[1:08:35] inherent desire i want the birthright
[1:08:39] i want everything god has for me
[1:08:42] i don't care what i gotta lose i don't
[1:08:44] care what i gotta do
[1:08:45] i don't care what what if i gotta die i
[1:08:48] can care less
[1:08:49] i want what god has for me
[1:08:52] but he saw the formal church amen the
[1:08:55] carnal believer
[1:08:56] he was willing to sell it out for
[1:08:58] peanuts
[1:09:04] a bowl of soup
[1:09:08] now mom my wife she loves soup me it's
[1:09:11] not my favorite thing to eat
[1:09:12] dead of winter maybe i like it every
[1:09:13] once in a while but it sure wouldn't be
[1:09:15] something i'd trade for
[1:09:18] maybe a steak you know if i see salt
[1:09:21] soup are you kidding me
[1:09:25] but it shows you how how trivial people
[1:09:29] will give
[1:09:30] right take
[1:09:34] in exchange for eternal life
[1:09:41] what are you getting well brother
[1:09:44] timothy i got a
[1:09:45] i got a drawer full of makeup and i i
[1:09:47] got these clothes and
[1:09:48] i got my hair cut like i wanted and i
[1:09:50] got my pants like i wanted i got my
[1:09:52] hairstyle like
[1:09:53] soup
[1:09:58] oh come on now nothing but soup
[1:10:02] nothing but porridge that's going to
[1:10:04] fall into the ground
[1:10:06] and be gone and decayed one day we're
[1:10:08] talking about eternal life
[1:10:11] and the spiritual church will say god i
[1:10:13] want all you got i don't care if it
[1:10:16] cleans my closet out
[1:10:18] i don't care if it cleans my car out i
[1:10:20] don't care if it cleans my life out
[1:10:22] i want all you got
[1:10:33] he longed for the birthright no matter
[1:10:35] what he had to do to get it
[1:10:38] just so he got it
[1:10:43] he didn't care how he had to get it that
[1:10:45] birthright is what he wanted no matter
[1:10:47] how he got it just so
[1:10:48] so he got it if you had to get down the
[1:10:51] altar scream and cry and boohoo and snot
[1:10:55] if that's what it took i want it amen
[1:11:05] listen to this right here he said some
[1:11:06] of them say brother branham
[1:11:08] them people down there boohooing at the
[1:11:10] altar and crying and crying i don't want
[1:11:12] it that way
[1:11:13] well you won't get it
[1:11:20] he said there was a colored brother down
[1:11:22] in the south one time was always happy
[1:11:24] his boss said what makes you so happy at
[1:11:27] the time boy all the time boy
[1:11:30] he said i got that heartfelt religion
[1:11:32] boss
[1:11:33] he said yeah there's no such a thing
[1:11:37] he said you made one mistake as far as
[1:11:40] you know
[1:11:41] there's no such a thing
[1:11:45] [Laughter]
[1:11:47] hallelujah the holy ghost don't fall no
[1:11:49] more like that brother timothy made a
[1:11:50] mistake
[1:11:51] as far as you know the holy ghost don't
[1:11:53] fall at that anymore
[1:11:55] amen people don't get drunk like that no
[1:11:57] more brother timothy as far as you know
[1:12:00] they don't get drunk like that no more
[1:12:02] but as far as i know
[1:12:04] and what i've witnessed gone still the
[1:12:06] same yesterday
[1:12:08] today and forever
[1:12:11] hallelujah as far as you know he don't
[1:12:14] steal heal
[1:12:15] and he don't still say and he don't
[1:12:17] steal forever
[1:12:18] but as far as i know he still does
[1:12:23] as far as you know he don't show himself
[1:12:25] visible
[1:12:26] but as far as i know he still does
[1:12:38] hallelujah he knew different because he
[1:12:41] had the experience
[1:12:50] you know i mean people are very quick to
[1:12:52] pass judgment on something
[1:12:57] some girls get drunk and they get what
[1:13:00] we call out of water
[1:13:02] and they pass judgment on that well my
[1:13:04] you know my generation was taught better
[1:13:08] maybe your generation needs to be taught
[1:13:10] how to receive the holy ghost
[1:13:14] how to be subject to a husband
[1:13:17] how to be subject to a pastor get those
[1:13:20] things right then talk about your
[1:13:21] generation
[1:13:24] i'm saying that very specifically
[1:13:30] but as far as you know god don't act
[1:13:32] that way
[1:13:38] i say let's wait and see what the fruits
[1:13:40] are
[1:13:41] because it is the spirit of god is going
[1:13:43] to bear the spirit of god for the fruits
[1:13:45] of god
[1:13:51] he said one day he said i want to get
[1:13:53] some of that heartfelt religion
[1:13:56] he said well when do you want it he said
[1:13:59] right now he said well let's go get it
[1:14:05] it ain't got to be a specific service it

[1:14:22] tonight
[1:14:23] you want deliverance from that spirit
[1:14:25] let's get it tonight
[1:14:28] we're still in the delivering business
[1:14:33] we put limitations on god our community
[1:14:36] puts
[1:14:36] limitations on god but with a god that i
[1:14:39] serve
[1:14:40] has no limits he has no power
[1:14:43] no limit to his power he has no limit to
[1:14:46] his healing he has no limit to his
[1:14:49] love glory to god he is god and he
[1:14:52] changes not
[1:14:53] no matter what man may say
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:14:59] hallelujah so they walked out to the
[1:15:02] outside and he said hey there's a hail
[1:15:04] off right there it's real nice and
[1:15:06] comfortable
[1:15:07] so the wife won't hear me or anything
[1:15:10] he said that's the way people want it
[1:15:13] they want to you know hand them on a
[1:15:14] platter
[1:15:15] where they can be comfortable god wants
[1:15:18] you to get out of your comfort zone
[1:15:23] that's what laodicea is all about be
[1:15:25] comfortable
[1:15:28] lukewarm you know be comfortable we
[1:15:31] don't want it too hot we don't want it
[1:15:33] too cold
[1:15:34] be comfortable
[1:15:40] that brother said old brother said you
[1:15:42] don't get it there
[1:15:44] no you won't get it there
[1:15:47] he said well went down to a stall
[1:15:51] i said what about here there's a nice
[1:15:53] horse to haul some great
[1:15:54] horses here will we get it there nope
[1:15:58] we'll get it over in a corn crib nope
[1:16:01] where'd he get it he said follow me
[1:16:04] said he went out to the barnyard pulled
[1:16:06] up his pant legs and walked out in the
[1:16:08] pigpen
[1:16:10] so he got up to the knees and the knees
[1:16:12] in the mud and the slop said come on out
[1:16:13] here
[1:16:14] that's where you get it he said i don't
[1:16:17] want to come out there he said then you
[1:16:18] don't want it yet boss
[1:16:21] you don't want it yet but when you get
[1:16:23] ready it'll be here for you
[1:16:27] hallelujah all god needs is a willing
[1:16:31] vessel
[1:16:32] they say god no matter how it comes and
[1:16:34] how he may be chills it may be
[1:16:36] crying it may be snot it may be dancing
[1:16:39] it may be just sitting there and i can't
[1:16:40] say a word
[1:16:41] i don't know how to be but no matter how
[1:16:43] it is i want it
[1:16:46] i whatever i got to go through i want it
[1:16:48] no matter where i got to go i want it
[1:16:51] i want christ in my life more than
[1:16:53] anything in this world
[1:16:59] wasn't the point that he had to be in a
[1:17:01] pig pen to receive it
[1:17:02] he had to be willing to do anything to
[1:17:04] get it
[1:17:07] getting past his formalities and his
[1:17:09] comfort zones
[1:17:10] and what he thought the way the spirit
[1:17:12] of god ought to operate and say god
[1:17:14] well however it is i just want to be
[1:17:16] willing
[1:17:22] but he talks about the spirit of that
[1:17:23] birth
[1:17:25] of those two boys that are still
[1:17:26] represented in the world today coming to
[1:17:28] a head
[1:17:29] the spiritual believer and the carnal
[1:17:31] believer
[1:17:33] no one could say there wasn't both
[1:17:34] religious they were
[1:17:36] they didn't say they didn't say that one
[1:17:38] served an idol and they once served god
[1:17:40] they both served
[1:17:42] god
[1:17:44] but he said not everyone that saith lord
[1:17:46] lord will enter in
[1:17:49] you know he'll come they'll come to him
[1:17:50] said lord did we not do miracles in your
[1:17:52] name did
[1:17:53] did we not do these mighty works and
[1:17:56] he'll say depart
[1:17:56] from me for i never knew you
[1:18:01] what he knows everything that happens he
[1:18:05] knows every flea that batsons die
[1:18:07] he knows every hair on our head or they
[1:18:11] used to be on our head
[1:18:12] he knows everything
[1:18:16] he knows every tick he knows ever the
[1:18:19] most minor detail he never knew
[1:18:22] no you never allowed me to be your lord
[1:18:26] relationship i never knew you
[1:18:35] well he knows i come to church sure he
[1:18:37] does
[1:18:38] but has he known you yet has there been
[1:18:41] a real relationship a life change
[1:18:47] some of your fathers today maybe said i
[1:18:49] want this revival in my home
[1:18:50] let it start with you mamas let us start
[1:18:54] with you
[1:18:59] let god know you
[1:19:02] see he said if jacob had one thing that
[1:19:05] he wanted because according the word
[1:19:07] the blessings and the good things laid
[1:19:10] in the birthright
[1:19:13] jacob that was his only objective the
[1:19:14] only thing he had in mind
[1:19:16] i've got to have that birthright and
[1:19:18] esau
[1:19:19] was ashamed of it he despised it but
[1:19:22] jacob wanted it regardless of how he got
[1:19:25] it
[1:19:25] he wanted it that's the way the super
[1:19:28] spiritual believer is today
[1:19:29] he doesn't care how much you laugh at
[1:19:31] him how much fun you make
[1:19:33] how ridiculous he has to act to the
[1:19:35] carnal mind his only
[1:19:37] objective is the birthright he wants to
[1:19:40] get to god
[1:19:42] because he's born in him to get to him
[1:19:45] hallelujah i can't help but do what i do
[1:19:48] because it's born in me
[1:19:50] to get to him there's a seed on the
[1:19:53] inside of me
[1:19:54] that said i've got to get in that
[1:19:55] presence
[1:20:00] jacob means to planter and deceiver
[1:20:05] but he comes into the position
[1:20:06] possession of the birthright
[1:20:09] which led him into the presence of the
[1:20:10] angel
[1:20:12] and he was changed
[1:20:16] carnal change then it was called not
[1:20:19] longer jacob
[1:20:20] but israel a prince with the lord who's
[1:20:23] wrestled with him
[1:20:26] the carnal believer you know as long as
[1:20:27] i go to church as long as i
[1:20:30] you know do my duties what difference
[1:20:31] does it make he said that's the esau
[1:20:34] group
[1:20:36] he still makes fun he still despises the
[1:20:39] birthright
[1:20:39] he doesn't care for it but jacob loved
[1:20:42] it
[1:20:44] the spiritual man today and the
[1:20:45] spiritual woman today that's elected
[1:20:47] predestinated of god to come to eternal
[1:20:49] life
[1:20:49] if they have to sell everything they got
[1:20:52] if they have to take their name off for
[1:20:54] every church book in the nation
[1:20:55] they still want that birthright it's the
[1:20:58] only thing that matters to them get that
[1:21:00] birth right
[1:21:01] no matter how what level they have to
[1:21:03] come to if they have to get down the
[1:21:05] altar cry
[1:21:06] boohoo if they have to run it through
[1:21:08] the place go back and make things right
[1:21:10] sell what they got
[1:21:11] give everything away become a pilgrim
[1:21:13] and a stranger it doesn't matter
[1:21:15] they want the birthright that's all
[1:21:18] that's
[1:21:18] interested in the birthright he said
[1:21:21] don't blame them
[1:21:22] they can't help it they were
[1:21:24] predestinated to that
[1:21:26] elected to that hallelujah
[1:21:29] i thank god for his election i think
[1:21:32] about it every day he could have put me
[1:21:34] on any continent he could have put me in
[1:21:35] any family but he put me in a family
[1:21:38] that believes the word of god
[1:21:42] be raised in a spiritual home in a
[1:21:44] spiritual atmosphere
[1:21:45] amen of seed of god place on the inside
[1:21:48] of me
[1:21:49] not by my natural birth
[1:21:51] [Applause]
[1:21:53] by election
[1:21:56] listen young people it wasn't by chance
[1:21:58] you was put in this church
[1:22:00] it wasn't by chance you was putting the
[1:22:02] family you was put in

[1:22:06] father that's not by chance
[1:22:08] god orchestrated that god placing people
[1:22:12] can make fun
[1:22:13] they can do whatever they want to god
[1:22:15] did that
[1:22:17] amen and if god did it there ain't
[1:22:19] nothing the devil can do about it
[1:22:29] listening and watching the chosen i
[1:22:32] thought it was very interesting
[1:22:36] how the philip would tell matthew as he
[1:22:38] was dealing with all of his complexes
[1:22:41] in his ways weird ways and strange ways
[1:22:47] i don't know if matthew was really like
[1:22:48] that but i know there are people that's
[1:22:49] really like that
[1:22:52] he's trying to figure it all out and why
[1:22:54] would god choose me
[1:22:57] and philip was telling me don't matter
[1:22:58] why
[1:23:00] it matters that he did
[1:23:05] the devil wants you to get hung up on
[1:23:07] why
[1:23:08] why did this happen why is it why am i
[1:23:11] like that
[1:23:12] what matters is god predestinated me
[1:23:15] and he elected me and he called me for
[1:23:18] this place
[1:23:19] and for this purpose
[1:23:22] that's all that matters
[1:23:26] it doesn't matter why i'm like this why
[1:23:28] why that's the devil trying to get you
[1:23:30] into that
[1:23:30] what matters is god said you're mine
[1:23:34] god said you're my daughter you're my
[1:23:35] son you're my child
[1:23:37] that's all that matters
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:45] but we see it as we talked about all the
[1:23:48] way back to the garden of eden
[1:23:50] one of wisdom and one of life
[1:23:54] one of carnal one of spiritual
[1:23:58] cain and abel both of them religious one
[1:24:00] of them desired life eternal
[1:24:02] and he offered to god by faith a more
[1:24:04] excellent sacrifice
[1:24:06] he said it's the perfect type of the
[1:24:08] church today
[1:24:09] the church spiritual and the church
[1:24:12] natural
[1:24:14] cain and abel he said there's no doubt
[1:24:17] but what i'm talking to both classes
[1:24:19] right now
[1:24:21] perhaps by tape we'll talk to tens of
[1:24:23] thousands of them
[1:24:24] but look the church natural just the
[1:24:27] church is just a church carnal
[1:24:30] they'll never be able to get above that
[1:24:33] little thing
[1:24:34] i'd go to church i'd join church
[1:24:37] i'm doing the best i can that's all god
[1:24:40] requires
[1:24:43] that's the same thing cain did he went
[1:24:46] and done the best he could
[1:24:49] he said god take it or leave it
[1:24:53] i don't i don't i don't want to have
[1:24:55] cane religion
[1:25:00] lord i go to church i've met the best
[1:25:03] one i can find
[1:25:04] i pay my dues i do what's right here's
[1:25:07] the best i can do
[1:25:09] i help pay some widows bills i i give
[1:25:12] children clothing
[1:25:13] them's all right nothing against that he
[1:25:15] says but that's all that's it that's all
[1:25:18] if you want it take it if you don't you
[1:25:20] don't have to take it he said that's the
[1:25:21] attitude
[1:25:22] of the church carnal today but the
[1:25:25] church spiritual
[1:25:27] able by revelation by grace he seemed
[1:25:30] beyond that
[1:25:31] and by faith he offered god a more
[1:25:32] excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:25:34] and it testified of his righteousness
[1:25:37] the same place took place in ishmael and
[1:25:39] isaac
[1:25:39] ones of the flesh one was of the spirit
[1:25:41] one was of the bond's woman one was of
[1:25:43] the free
[1:25:44] woman it happened the same thing with
[1:25:46] israel and moab two great churches
[1:25:47] coming together
[1:25:48] israel was wanting to go to the promised
[1:25:50] land church spiritual
[1:25:52] jacob's people israel on the road esau's
[1:25:55] people met the moab a powerful church
[1:25:58] great leader of the church balaam came
[1:26:00] down to curse them but he found he could
[1:26:02] not curse them
[1:26:03] he failed with the blindness of his eyes
[1:26:05] to see
[1:26:06] the predestinated plan of god
[1:26:10] and to see the pillar of fire that was
[1:26:12] among them
[1:26:18] here israel comes up to the promised
[1:26:20] land headed to it
[1:26:23] believers believers
[1:26:26] and here's moab not infidels believers
[1:26:29] actual believers in the same god that
[1:26:31] israel had
[1:26:32] come out to try to curse but they
[1:26:35] couldn't do it
[1:26:37] great nation here that israel was just
[1:26:41] trying to get to the promised land
[1:26:42] balaam bill's altars we heard about it
[1:26:44] here in our meetings baylor balaam
[1:26:46] offered seven sacrifices of clean bleach
[1:26:48] israel offered seven sacrifice they were
[1:26:50] as far as they could take it ritually
[1:26:52] moab was just as religious as israel was
[1:26:54] esau just as religious as jacob was cain
[1:26:57] just as religious as abel was
[1:26:58] but it was the election that's what
[1:27:00] holds he said how blind of esau's
[1:27:03] children spiritually speaking the
[1:27:04] moabites
[1:27:05] looking down upon israel look at them
[1:27:07] they're they're just a
[1:27:08] they're they're not a denomination
[1:27:10] they're a bunch of renegades they live
[1:27:11] in tents
[1:27:13] we're a great nation they've done evil
[1:27:15] they have no organization
[1:27:16] they just wigging around following the
[1:27:18] prophet but they failed to see the brass
[1:27:20] serpent
[1:27:21] they failed to see the smitten rock
[1:27:23] going before them they failed to see
[1:27:25] that called out
[1:27:26] elected group following the divine order
[1:27:28] of god to the promised land
[1:27:30] that's the way it is today
[1:27:34] they say it's a bunch of holy rollers
[1:27:37] they say it's a bunch of fanatics they
[1:27:40] say it's just a bunch of pentecostals
[1:27:43] they say that it's just all of this it's
[1:27:45] nothing of god
[1:27:47] but they fail to see the pillar of fire
[1:27:49] world
[1:27:52] they fail to see the angel of the lord
[1:27:53] stepping out and speaking
[1:28:04] he said jacob he said the reason he
[1:28:07] chose to find that birthright
[1:28:10] and he wanted to get it because he knew
[1:28:14] that that birthright held all the
[1:28:16] blessings
[1:28:20] the holy ghost entitles you to
[1:28:22] everything
[1:28:24] healings deliverances joy
[1:28:28] unspeakable and full of glory amen all
[1:28:31] the things
[1:28:32] it held life he didn't care how it come
[1:28:34] just so he got it
[1:28:35] that was the main thing let me go on
[1:28:39] down here
[1:28:44] it's a wonderful sermon now you can go
[1:28:45] and listen to it been listening to it
[1:28:47] here and receiving and acting
[1:28:50] but i just want to we're going to get
[1:28:52] into a couple things for you just bring
[1:28:54] it down
[1:28:56] but there's a true anointing true
[1:28:58] anointed and a false anointing
[1:29:02] and it's followed that once again carnal
[1:29:05] spiritual
[1:29:06] uh you know human abilities
[1:29:10] god abilities it's the twins of every
[1:29:12] revival
[1:29:14] and and brother brother brandon would
[1:29:15] preach a wonderful sermon that would
[1:29:16] bring a lot of clarity to this because
[1:29:18] it would br
[1:29:18] there's a lot of questions that can
[1:29:19] arise in mind because you know people
[1:29:21] can get anointed with the holy ghost but
[1:29:23] yet not have the holy ghost
[1:29:26] and do things and work signs and
[1:29:28] miracles and all those things that can
[1:29:29] take place
[1:29:30] he said see it's not false jesus is this
[1:29:32] false christ
[1:29:33] they believe they're anointed but they
[1:29:35] know they're not jesus yes too plain
[1:29:37] if a man went up and said look at my
[1:29:38] scars look at my brow i'm jesus well
[1:29:40] that you know that'd be wrong
[1:29:42] but jesus said to them gods would appear
[1:29:44] he said they would appear false christ
[1:29:46] or false
[1:29:46] anointed once he said remember i've
[1:29:49] always told you there's three classes of
[1:29:51] people three races of people
[1:29:52] ham sham and javid three races three
[1:29:54] classes make believer
[1:29:56] believer and unbeliever it's always been
[1:29:58] and always will be there was moses the
[1:30:00] believer
[1:30:01] there were jane janus and james the
[1:30:04] unbelievers
[1:30:05] and there was balaam the make believer
[1:30:07] remember the unbeliever the
[1:30:08] denominational church they don't believe
[1:30:10] in any signs at all
[1:30:11] the cold formal starchy church in the
[1:30:14] world
[1:30:15] the denomination but the make-believer
[1:30:17] is that shuck
[1:30:19] he might believe in signs my belief in
[1:30:22] some things
[1:30:23] but it puts a hold on god
[1:30:27] he said notice and this is was striking
[1:30:30] to me as i read this because
[1:30:32] i've actually witnessed this in these
[1:30:34] last few meetings i've been in
[1:30:36] he said notice how bold these
[1:30:39] unbelievers
[1:30:40] and these make-believers are they're
[1:30:42] bold
[1:30:45] he said look even as satan he said he
[1:30:47] stood right up in the presence
[1:30:49] of the true word and said it is written
[1:30:53] it is written why does satan do that
[1:30:55] because he knew he didn't know the word
[1:30:56] for that
[1:30:57] he knew the word he knew the word was
[1:30:59] for that hour but he doubted this humble
[1:31:01] man
[1:31:02] being that word he said if thou be i
[1:31:05] the son of god i know the son of god is
[1:31:07] coming if thou be he'll give you angel's
[1:31:09] charge see
[1:31:10] he said see do a miracle let me see you
[1:31:12] do it see he said see the unbeliever
[1:31:14] make believer
[1:31:15] amen the believer look at judas right
[1:31:17] among them same time make believer
[1:31:19] but he said how bold they are they'll
[1:31:22] say now don't pay no attention to that
[1:31:24] nonsense
[1:31:26] it's just a bunch of noise
[1:31:29] this is where the prophet of god is
[1:31:30] putting these statements at
[1:31:33] just a bunch of noise there's nothing to
[1:31:35] it
[1:31:37] it's all in your mind
[1:31:41] see what i mean stand right in the
[1:31:43] presence of the word and say it
[1:31:48] i'm not too sure some have not stayed
[1:31:50] set right in the presence of god
[1:31:52] and looked at the movement of the holy
[1:31:54] ghost and blasphemed
[1:31:58] and caught in an evil spirit
[1:32:04] the prophet of god had more wisdom than
[1:32:06] that
[1:32:07] you know he would he would see something
[1:32:09] to break out and this woman began to
[1:32:11] break out in the dance
[1:32:14] and he would look at it and he can get
[1:32:16] very critical in his heart
[1:32:18] and he'd criticize it he'd make
[1:32:22] the thoughts that come through his mind
[1:32:23] they're turning my church into a tavern
[1:32:26] bar room because apparently it wasn't
[1:32:28] very much an order
[1:32:31] apparently it was way out of water
[1:32:36] he said but i wouldn't say anything he
[1:32:39] said because
[1:32:41] they might be right and i might be wrong
[1:32:48] and then before the whole you know the
[1:32:49] story ends he's up there up there
[1:32:51] dancing along
[1:32:52] just right out in the wild dancing
[1:32:58] but people are very bold to get in the
[1:33:00] presence of god and call it an evil
[1:33:02] spirit
[1:33:04] i would wait till i sing the fruits of
[1:33:06] it
[1:33:09] i can tell you this i've seen this evil
[1:33:11] spirits and they're pretty easy to
[1:33:13] identify
[1:33:15] and they begin to speak out and they
[1:33:17] begin to do things that's uncommon
[1:33:20] and you realize that's an evil spirit
[1:33:22] it's easy to identify
[1:33:25] but sometimes god will act in ways and
[1:33:27] do things and anoint and move
[1:33:30] and it's god and people are very bold to
[1:33:33] say some things against it not realizing
[1:33:35] their voice in their own complexes
[1:33:38] and they're voicing their own humanities
[1:33:40] and if they're careful they blast faith
[1:33:50] he said see in the god of this evil age
[1:33:54] he would talk again about the
[1:33:56] the church the age of the seat
[1:33:59] he said all the way from the garden of
[1:34:00] eden all the way down there's never been
[1:34:02] an age now so deceptive now is this age
[1:34:05] false prophets will rise and show signs
[1:34:06] and wonders if possible
[1:34:08] to deceive the very elect if possible he
[1:34:11] said now
[1:34:11] just a cold formal starchy churches and
[1:34:14] so forth
[1:34:15] a made man-made theology that wouldn't
[1:34:17] elect would not ever
[1:34:19] pay attention to that notice that
[1:34:23] but it's up there almost like the real
[1:34:24] thing just leaving out one word is all
[1:34:27] you have to do
[1:34:28] the promise of the aids very great time
[1:34:30] christians everywhere take heed
[1:34:32] to the hour that we're living in he said
[1:34:34] what would god call a people out of this
[1:34:35] evil age for
[1:34:37] he wants a bride when she's made
[1:34:38] manifest been tried been proved
[1:34:40] amen to satan that she gonna stand no
[1:34:43] matter what goes on no matter what
[1:34:44] happens
[1:34:45] she's going to stand he said see the
[1:34:48] seed that fell on the ground it comes
[1:34:49] through the carriers all the way down to
[1:34:51] the church ages
[1:34:52] the same way the seed or the seed fell
[1:34:54] on the ground and eden same way that
[1:34:55] ends up in the last days
[1:34:57] he said just the gospel when it was fell
[1:34:59] on the denomination that
[1:35:00] nazi and rome it ends up in a super
[1:35:03] organization
[1:35:04] he's just just the same the seat of the
[1:35:06] church fell back there in the first
[1:35:08] age down into the ground it went with
[1:35:10] signs and wonders and living christ
[1:35:12] among them
[1:35:12] it'll end up in the last days under the
[1:35:15] ministry of malachi 4
[1:35:17] restored back again to the original
[1:35:19] faith that was once given in the first
[1:35:22] age
[1:35:24] same signs same wonders same god same
[1:35:27] manifestations
[1:35:29] same power same healing same
[1:35:31] deliverances
[1:35:33] same everything
[1:35:36] god's not coming from a for a cold
[1:35:38] church
[1:35:40] he's not coming for a formal church
[1:35:44] this church the church god is coming for
[1:35:48] has the fire of god in her
[1:35:53] because it's written there in the in in
[1:35:56] the church ages there in the revelations
[1:35:58] he that walks in the candle sticks we
[1:36:00] know the candle sticks
[1:36:02] seven licks going down into one base the
[1:36:05] original fire
[1:36:05] lit that amen and they would go from one
[1:36:08] age all the way to the next stage the
[1:36:10] same original fire the same original
[1:36:12] holy ghost same god working same sign
[1:36:14] same wonders
[1:36:15] so he's coming back for a church with
[1:36:17] the fire of god in it
[1:36:20] the light of god moving in it the signs
[1:36:23] and wonders being made manifest
[1:36:25] the spirit the manifestations of the
[1:36:27] spirit at work
[1:36:30] did you hear me it ain't an evil spirit
[1:36:33] it's a manifestation of the holy spirit
[1:36:36] at work and it does not matter how many
[1:36:39] ministers say it don't work no more
[1:36:41] you know that which is perfect has come
[1:36:43] so that which is part is done away with
[1:36:46] do you understand what that means we've
[1:36:48] been taught very well
[1:36:51] we have the perfect so we have all
[1:36:54] that's in the perfect
[1:36:56] so we don't just have part no more we
[1:36:58] have all of it
[1:37:00] we have something that's worth being in
[1:37:03] a revival about
[1:37:06] listen we see a bunch of world that's
[1:37:08] being they're
[1:37:09] being lifted up into a revival amen
[1:37:12] they're out in the streets they're
[1:37:13] knocking down
[1:37:14] doors they're in a revival of evil and a
[1:37:16] revival of sin
[1:37:18] don't you know there ought to be a
[1:37:19] church of the real church the church of
[1:37:21] the living god
[1:37:22] also in a revival also in a lifting up
[1:37:26] we're not going down into the ground
[1:37:27] church
[1:37:28] we're going up and he's not coming back
[1:37:32] for a formal
[1:37:33] church or a formal person
[1:37:36] he's coming back for fire
[1:37:40] miss barrios
[1:37:48] he said when a man or woman is set under
[1:37:50] creeds in cold form of religion
[1:37:52] if he's ordained to be a son of god and
[1:37:55] he sees the word of god preaching his
[1:37:57] power
[1:37:58] and god vindicates it he's an eagle
[1:38:01] to begin with he'll run to it as sure as
[1:38:04] two plus two is four
[1:38:08] he can't help it because his very nature
[1:38:11] loves the word of god
[1:38:14] and he's not going to sit under some
[1:38:16] dead creed and some
[1:38:18] dead dogma but he's going to move to the
[1:38:21] light
[1:38:23] he hears the eagle scream
[1:38:32] he said the book of he said the true
[1:38:34] christ in the true church is the
[1:38:35] continuation
[1:38:37] of the book of acts but the book of
[1:38:40] revelation shows how that antichrist
[1:38:42] spirit
[1:38:44] will come into the church
[1:38:48] and defile it make it lukewarm
[1:38:52] formal and powerless it exposes satan
[1:38:56] revealing his works attempted
[1:38:58] destruction of god's people
[1:38:59] and the discrediting of god's word right
[1:39:01] down to the time he's cast into the lake
[1:39:03] of fire
[1:39:04] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:39:06] knows
[1:39:07] that if the people get the true
[1:39:10] revelation of the true church and what
[1:39:12] she
[1:39:12] is and what she stands for and that she
[1:39:16] can do the greater works
[1:39:18] she will be an invincible army
[1:39:21] and satan will be powerless before her
[1:39:26] hallelujah
[1:39:31] i wonder how many today would say lord i
[1:39:33] want all of you

[1:40:12] life
