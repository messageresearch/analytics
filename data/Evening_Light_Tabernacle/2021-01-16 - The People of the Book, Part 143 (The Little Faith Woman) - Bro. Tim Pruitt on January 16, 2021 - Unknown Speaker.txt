pray and the mosquitoes got the biting and the thorns got the punching and all that but if he knew he could ever break through into that presence just got to let go and let jesus amen there's a lot of you been asking for a breakthrough it's your moment this morning amen let go and let jesus let go and let jesus have your issues and your problems and your situation amen cause you've ever given that presence it'll make everything right it'll heal you it'll bind up the broken heart if you could ever get that prayer [Music] hallelujah amen because if you knew how what i knew you would push with everything you got amen that song was for reason this morning the way it was done for a reason this morning god's wanting to show you if you'll be persistent be perseverant you'll get through to where you need to be hallelujah amen everything may seem to be in chaos and out of order and you're worried about it you're tore up about it let go i wonder this morning if you'll make a pledge to yourself i'm letting go this morning i'm letting go of everything around me i'm letting go of my past i'm letting go of every situation i can't control anyhow and i'm giving it to jesus and i'm saying god you're on the scene this morning you're here to touch me you're here to lift me up you're here to encourage me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now let's worship him as we get ready for the word this morning i get joy when i think about what he's done for me i get joy when i think about you see that you don't i know what he's done oh you see that you don't know like i know for me and i get happy when i think about all these oh when i think about what he's done for me [Music] is [Applause] [Applause] thank you for what you've done for us thank you for your grace lord thank you for your mercies amen praise the lord you hear me okay out there all right now you do praise the lord amen am i good to be in the house of the lord my the presence of the lord is so wonderful how he comes and moves to his people bringing deliverance we just his brother timothy was reporting we had so many deliverances since last sunday in the prayer line and then in the service is following god has been doing some mighty wonderful things amen we can testify what he's done for us just hearing from sister diane this morning this sister diane siminelli she had coveted like symptoms they took tests but she never got results but nevertheless uh today last night the healing angel passed by and all of that's going away and she's rejoicing today sister jeannie camp is reporting the same that it's all just the the the symptoms are all just subsiding and leaving god's a healer came by sister linda oglesby's there and took away a sciatic condition she'd been suffering with for for days i'll tell you you can expect the what is man calls impossible because with god there is nothing impossible and with you as a believer there's nothing impossible all things are possible only believe now i'm going to go into a sermon today a service and you will think brother timothy and i've been collaborating and talking he didn't even know what my title was to just a few moments ago and we not spoke a thing but as it unfolds today you'll see that he caught the very channel of inspiration so as we go to the lord today if you've got a need in your heart in life and i know there's many many listen in the end there's situations up in johnson city where they're not able to have church snowstorm come in over brother ron's dumped a lot of snow there they don't have service this morning they're joining them with us many others are tuning in today from around the world and god knows what your situation is what your problem is you don't even have to be here physically in this building because there's somebody that is greater than a physical presence he's omnipresent he's there for you and whatever need that you have as the holy spirit sweeps across the land today and speaks to heart and lives let him speak to you let him reveal himself through the word let him reveal i want to heal you more than what you even think i want to show myself real to you more than what you even think i want to give you the holy ghost more than what you can even desire it i want to give you every divine blessing it is yours you just reach out and receive it today amen the word preach has to be mixed with faith in them that hear it so mix it with faith today as we talk to the lord now if you've got a knee raise your hand to him father with their heads bowed they raise their hands because they're not raising it to me they raised it to the almighty god who is more than able who is more than a conqueror who conquered death hell and the grave oh god who defeated every sickness when he rose up on that third day [Music] who took with him to hell every trouble every problem that we could ever have as our sins was laid upon him and he is a scapegoat descended down into the regions of the lost and of the damned and he overcame death hell in the grave rose again triumphant and we're not preaching just a crucified christ today but a risen christ and we are here to show for the power of his resurrection in this hour and this time to this people and more than that lord more than just a resurrection and then ascension and you went away but you came back again on the day of pentecost to come and dwell your people to empower them that they could overcome in mortal bodies yes lord we live in this flesh but greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world so therefore we overcome the world the flesh and the devil oh god we'll even overcome death itself because like you we're more than conquerors i pray now father that you'll bless your people heal them even as the word goes forth may that quickening power just reached down into their heart and that faith reach up and take a hold of the promise for their healing and for their deliverance in the name of jesus christ we ask him amen and amen god bless you turn with me to luke chapter 18 and we'll read from verse one amen we appreciate the musicians and songs that were sung amen comes from dedicated hearts and consecrated lives we appreciate that luke chapter 18 verse 1 and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought to always pray and not to faint satan there was in a city a judge which feared not god nor neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the lord said hear what this this unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him though he bear along with them and i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth god bless you can be seated i'm going to be speaking this morning on that little faith woman and in a little while i'll read a quote from god of this evil age from which i will will take my title from today but the bible lets us know that its promises are only to those that diligently seek him and the jesus would tell us that from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffered violence and the violent take it by force and other translations will say it this way and from the days of the john the baptist until the present time the kingdom of heaven has endured violent assault and violent men cease it by force as a precious prize a share in the heavenly kingdom is sought with most ardent zeal and intense exertion and then again another translation says it this way from the moment john stepped onto the scene until now the realm of kingdoms heaven's kingdom is bursting forth and passionate people have taken hold of his power amen so if you look in this you can you can see even from the words of jesus of of how that a woman was coming to the judge with a persistent faith in believing and knowing that the judge was going to answer his her request and again you know as we read the the realm of heaven's kingdom is bursting forth and i thought about it as i read that of how that is burst forth in this age like in 1906 it came with an outpouring of the holy ghost on azusa street and a passionate people took hold of its power as i passed through the countryside the other day i went into rural areas right up on the edge of arkansas and well it actually was at three creeks just um on just across the border and i thought of other other times that i've read some of the historical uh events of this area and how that the holy ghost had moved and and um people had had responded to the call of god and there was little churches that raised up are these fanatics called pentecostals and and so now as i as i was coming to a tree of three creeks i looked there and i saw um an assembly of god church no doubt a remnant of what was left over from that revival and and then and of course as you come down to cotton valley there's two of them and that little small hamlet of a town but nevertheless it just shows you that that um even from that revival there were passionate people at that time that took a hold of his power and over and over again it has burst forth into this last age where it's happened again in in 1909 when the pillar of fire hung over a little baby crib and in a cabin in rural kentucky and then a greater portion would happen again in 1933 on the ohio river and would scream out as john the baptist for run the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of christ then in 1946 it materialized in the form of an angel and from there it burst forth into healing and then discernment and then again of the seven angels would burst forth from other dimensions and bring the revelation of the seven thunders that are contained in the seven seals and even brother branham would make note of this and seed not air with the shock he said at the opening of the seven seals revelation 10 the full word is born in the manifestation again i want you to pay attention to that because again he speaks that the full word is is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of god in full strength as it was when he was here on the earth manifested in the same way doing the same things as that it did when he was here on earth again hebrews 13 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so it is bursting forth from the from the forerunner even until now and i'm going to just tell you passionate people must lay hold on it and when violent men sees it by force as a precious prize a share in the heavenly kingdom is sought with most ardent zeal and intense exertion again brother branham was told um very clearly by a prophecy given through danny henry where it was spoken french and another um interpreted and and uh it was interpreted that a huge portion of heaven awaits you and i just want to say to you today this is what awaits us all is a huge portion of the heavenly realm heaven consists of his word and the word not just the theology but the word in his power amen a huge portion of heaven awaits you and and there are violent men men and women with a passion with a drive on the inside of them that are pressing amen they're exerting everything that they have they're pressing them into the spirit realm they want more of god than they have ever had they're experiencing more of god that ever they are not satisfied with just church energy they're not satisfied with just sitting on a pew but they want to know god in his fullness and there's a rapture to be acquired and to be attained there's a body change there's the resurrection of the saints that lay right before us this is a great hour that we're living and remember when we're speaking about the kingdom of heaven we're not we're not talking about the sweet by and by amen we are speaking of the holy ghost that is the heavenly kingdom that's the heaven that we acquire now that portion of heaven is in the holy ghost a huge portion then of the holy ghost is ours to be the bride we share with christ in this supernatural kingdom and it requires that violent men and women lay hold on what is theirs and that take hold of the heavenly realm for the full word has now come and been born into manifestation now jesus likened us to a persistent woman who will never give up if you notice this parable is given and that jesus is liking in the kingdom of heaven he is likening us to a persistent woman to a woman who will never give up this is hers this is her inheritance amen and so she has no earthly husband to attain it for her but she's not given up on it she's pressing through she's going to attain it and he realizes you know with this woman she will not give up she will not quit until i'm offense of mine enemy i tell you that ought to be you today when you look at your enemy i will not give up until my enemy is defeated until i have complete victory on him and i get back what he stole from me amen i will not sit down i will not be blessed i will not be complacent remember i will press in with everything that i got until i trained everything the word of god described for me to have the bride must be a persistent woman who lay holds on the promise now satan wants to try to make us now just all word and no spirit or all spirit and no truth that's right because he wants to change us from true worship now there was a time that the church in the azusa state was in danger of taking the anointing and its emotion and rejecting truth let me say that again there was a time that the church in the azusa stage was in danger of taking the anointing and its emotion and rejecting truth you find this laodicea he will be rejected is that right standing on the outside the church knocking trying to get in so you hear the prophet warning against taking the emotion and the anointing only and rejecting the word so during those times we learned how that the true genuine anointing could anoint false seed amen but the anointing was never the problem you hear what i'm saying it was the seed that was a terror the anointing is vital it is important for without it the seed can never germinate or come to life so it was never the anointing that was the problem the rain was sent for the wheat the problem was there were terror rejoicing in it too that's right amen now so again don't ever strike at the anointing strike at the vault seed who is responding to the anointing but yet yet our fault seed bringing forth a false doctrine the warning against taking the spirit only or the emotion is not valid in our case i i want that to go across the land i wanted to go right here in this church the warning against taking the spirit only or emotion only is not valid in our case we are not rejecters of the word amen amen we have embraced the world the whole world we have been we have not rejected the open book we believe we are artist believers fervent believers solid believers and we believe all the word amen so the warning against taking the spirit only our emotion only is not valid in our case it's not even talking to us whatsoever because we're not about to trade the word for some emotion amen but neither do we want the word without power amen because the true word will always have power so so again as i said we have not rejected now it is just as dangerous to reject the anointing as it is to reject the word true worship must be done in spirit and in truth you see those who true worshipers who who are the true worshipers worship in spirit and in truth not just one or the other or one without the other but both of them now the word without the spirit kills it brings death the letter kills but the spirit gives life is that right so yeah you can find where brother branham corrected both he corrected taking the word without the spirit and he condemned having preachers without anointing amen he condemned um he condemned salvation without an experience confessions without tears he called them dried-eyed confessions he condemned churches without miracles saying if god be with us then where are the miracles amen he told us over and over again that preaching was not teaching but demonstrating the word with his power he spoke against churches who were mourned saying jesus wasn't there because anywhere jesus is there's noise [Applause] yet at the same time he warned against bubble dancing with empty emotion while rejecting the word he condemned heaven miracles although all the while denying truth because he referred to jesus word saying many will come to me in that day saying we have done many mighty miracles in my name and yet they were workers of iniquity he condemned jumping and shouting while not living the life amen but he said it's all right to jump yes amen then but just jump as as high as you live well i say if you're living that high then that's all you can jump if you're living this high that's all you can jump if you're living this high that's all you can do if you're living this high you got a long ways to jump amen but i want to say it again we are not word rejecters you tell me one word we reject and neither will we reject the spirit and its anointing in fact our problem around the message today is not having the dynamics without the word amen it's because we went off the opposite direction of warning just theology of the message while rejecting the dynamic power of the holy ghost in fact brother random told us that too much stress was on the mechanics and not and nothing on the dynamics those are his words he said it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to to manifest to bring to pass that this is gasoline so the church must be one that has both the dynamics and the mechanics now this is what he proved as he says and it is the rising of the sons what easter proof he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word notice not just the word but god himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of jesus christ cold still dead in the grave to life again and roll away the stone i am he that was dead he was so dead till the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize he's alive again and he was not only the mechanics god's word but he was the dynamics to prove it and he being a part of being the groom and the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him i want you to listen and it can only be the manifestations wait wait manifestations say it with me manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations that any other spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as a man and woman or one and the woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side they both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him put together and made mechanics and dynamics now all he said and he said until the church of the people all these easter bunny ceremonies big churches and fineries in other words denominational theories and fiction it will all fail and pass away but until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride amen for he said john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also i'll give him charge a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics and the world will not be able to withstand it i'll raise him up at the last day that's the easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without dynamics no good neither is dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around on this pistons you've got spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire by it'll only come it'll only work as they come together amen so one will sit still and one will go up i don't know about you but i want to be the one that goes up amen then in order to do it the dynamics of this church will be what a refilling of the holy ghost that we only worked in small measure while while the the body was growing up but now we come to the full power of the holy ghost to full power to where it will raise the dead change our bodies and translate us from this dimension to another amen now so again he says it won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come when the dynamics come that's the fire is made to connect that octane and the gasoline and when that explodes this causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's a real power of god mechanics with the dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickens it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things and he is the word is the father living the father sent me so send i you as the father fired me and pushed me into everything i do only that which is pleasing to god as he sent me so send i you with the same mechanics and it takes the same dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the dynamics will take place paul said the gospel came to us not in word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move there you are it came to us in that manner amen that's the way it's got to be here in this last day in the same manner the dynamics and the mechanics together amen remember not words and rejecters not anointing rejecters amen amen but both of them together hallelujah what it does it causes a combustion amen something bursts forth the power rises up out of that church amen now when he went to calvary remember he went with you in him god never had separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are the one same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride amen how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the grim come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to proven it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she would be in the last day don't you have to return to malachi 4. what is it amen returning back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers amen don't you have to be manifested like she was in the days of sodom so shall it be with the son of man the word is revealed don't the world have to be exactly like it is isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of god made known to us yes amen now throughout the bible there are stories of women who would persist and i want you to remember they are prophecies but looking at the bible is historical or nice story or the story the genealogy of the jewish people it's your genealogy amen is prophesying of you of an end time people amen and so again i'm going to repeat the they they were prophecies let me repeat these quotes brother branham said and him being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him and it can only be this only thing could be is the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the other revelations others spoke of the bride so you see though sarah didn't know it she was talking about she was prophesying of an end time people no ruth didn't know it she was doing more than just fulfilling a few pages in the bible come on church it's more than just the history of the ancient church or ancient israel and the king line it's our line it's our word it's i promise it's our prophecy this is thus saith the lord concerning the people in the last days now as we're saying this the same word then that spoke of the groom also spoke of the bride so then how can you deny john 14 12 being to the bride of christ amen the works that i do so you do also greater than these how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't she wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even proven it by raising himself up from the day of afterwards that don't the bride have to do the same thing don't you have to raise up in resurrection you see the word cannot be without manifestation other words otherwise it's just a creed or a dogma or historical or a nice story it has to have manifestation to be word there has to be the gasoline there the word full octane power amen the word born into full in the full manifestation amen but it has to have manifestation in order for it to be word now jesus asked this question when i return to earth will i find faith there's got to be a great church full of faith and god did things in our age to stimulate faith to cause us to believe amen now so this this is exactly where we're at and not only that but our faith is dead without manifestation you see your faith must be known by its works amen this is why we're putting the emphasis not just on having faith but also the works that accomplish that faith faith bringing the word into manifestation see jesus never did say would i find righteousness or well i find people living good there's going to be thousands of millions of multitudes without number that have washed the robes in the blood of the lamb and made them white amen good people that that were over in the white throne judgment they're they're giving life they're led into living waters amen but jesus asked when i return will i find faith amen and brother branham said some somebody they say oh i got faith he said well faith without works is dead will i find somebody who will stand at my word and say every word is right [Music] amen oh yes every word is right i say amen to every word brother branham says when he was corrupting the emotion while they're rejecting the word i say amen and praise god to every time that he speaks about emotion amen and rejoicing in truth amen and accepting the word but you see but but but you see your faith without works is dead faith well i find someone who will stand and say every word is right don't just preach to me one side of this every word is right that will live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen now he said uh i'm not scared whether this one says so or that says so or nothing i believe in god i'm accepted i'm standing right there on it that's the thing god's preparing a church to be saved just as he did in the days of noah and that ark and the body of christ today is that art amen so you see down to the ages we find in the bible the faith of god within these women that prevailed and so it is faith and and the anointing that satan wants to kill so notice this you know he he he of course comes and attacks the word but the way he attacks the word is by coming against his power amen because he knows that a powerless gospel will never defeat him so what satan will come along and do he after the word is revealed he'll take the knowledge of it to kill with it and he will exalt the knowledge over the supernatural revelation that brought it so in christ the mystery brother brandon said what is the denomination trying to do exalts itself like luther they so call themselves the church the bride which they are in revelation 17 spoke of the false bride above they exalt themselves above christ's little flock the bride lucifer thinks and exalts himself above the humble word of god's truth by the knowledge of the revelation and it's placed himself by seminary education and theology until they've got themselves up and if you don't belong to their group then you're an outwash so this is what the devil does he comes along and exalts he hears the word preached and he takes the revelation that is now knowledge and exalts that knowledge over the supernatural revelation amen so you see this is what he wants to do take knowledge any and exalted over revelation you see revelation brings knowledge what happened when the opening of the seven seals happened it brought us knowledge didn't it brought us knowledge of who the horse rider was it brought us knowledge of how they changed their colors and what that meant it brought us knowledge about the souls under the altar brought us knowledge about the multitude without number and 144 000. it broke the silence of the seventh seal right amen so you see revelation brings knowledge but revelation can only come by the spirit and it's anointing and when it comes it's wine and it's stimulating and there is a whole lot of difference of difference between receiving knowledge and revelation because when it is revelation it is a whine of stimulation and there's a warning that comes out from the spirit that's hurting not the oil and the wine you touch doubt you're cursed if you touch the oil in the wind if you touch the stimulation that is to accompany revelation amen that you're under a curse from almighty god do not touch the oil and the wine use the warning of the spirit to satan it's the warning of the spirit to every preacher don't you dare try to serve this up without the oil in the wine because without it it's death is a hybrid knowledge it's the passing on of knowledge that comes from intellectual men and teaching rather than the holy spirit now you see as i said revelation brings knowledge but once it's revealed satan can take the knowledge of the revelation and exalt it over the revelation itself so all of a sudden having the knowledge is greater than the revelation which is supernatural revelation doesn't come from from being schooled and learned or being taught revelation comes from the holy ghost quickening the word to your life are you with me now so once revealed satan can take the knowledge of the revelation and exalt it over the revelation itself then you have knowledge without revelation truth without life and word without power amen [Music] word without manifestation that's right a letter that kills yes this is what people want to do today preachers are guilty of taking the word and trying to kill the anointing now the revelation came with power it came from seven mighty angels it was not a learned knowledge day by day in the presence of the pillar of fire the seals were taken off the book it was not a teaching it was a supernatural revelation and remember after the revelation came then satan took the knowledge and built denominational camps with it deity camp return ministry camp thunder camps perugia camp two soul camps and now the tape only camp amen just personality cults why because that's the way the devil does exalts a personality instead of the word instead of god personality calls by taking the knowledge of the revelation and exalting it over the word which is spirit jesus said the words i speak they are spirit and life so it produces a group of people with knowledge of it without the revelation of it and when it does it produces a dogma instead of the holy spirit and people receive an organizational spirit that then fights against the holy spirit and this produces hybrid children mongolizing the offspring now but in all of this there is a woman that has more than a knowledge of the truth amen that wants more than anything the life of the truth and she is not satisfied with empty promises amen she's not satisfied with empty promises unfulfilled promises this is the way this woman was she had a promise and she's coming to the judge i've got a promise i've got a right to be here but he wasn't going to give it to her until she was persistent and jesus is telling the same thing it's going to take a persistent woman to lay hold on these promises otherwise the promises will remain empty unfulfilled without manifestation it'll be a word without life a letter that kills that makes another dead church that's right now this is this is a quote from the second coming 1955 and and i want you to i want you just to take this to heart right now the gospel is not going out and teaching the bible that isn't the gospel it is written in the scripture that the word didn't come through just the word only but through the power and demonstrations of the holy spirit the gospel that is the word but the letter killeth the spirit giveth life now seed laying here on the pulpit is just a seed until it dies and becomes germatized it'll never do anything so the seed the word here has to be made manifest in order to be the gospel watch now the seed the word has to be made manifest in order to be the gospel word without manifestation is not the gospel and remember the gospel must be preached in all the world so that him can come so therefore it must be manifested a word is the expression of a thought it has to be a thought for it can be a word so god in the beginning gave the thought of what it would be he spoke the word for it to be we we receive the word and it produces what god thought it was the word is the gospel in seed form so now we have a seed but no life in it well there's life but it's potential life that's right right and it can only come when the water and the atmosphere produces the light so again it's gasoline without fire somebody somebody found a wheat germ or wheat seed in one of the pyramids in egypt and i understood that they planted it and they got in the right atmosphere and it it made up it came up and produced but it laid there for thousands of years thousands of years lifeless without life without power with because it had no manifestation until it was it come in the atmosphere and the water came upon it which is the spirit to dramatize it and make it life now brother bradley said if you asked me in your country and they gave you and they have anchored trees or oak trees said would you give me an oak tree and i give you an acre you have an oak tree potentially but it's in the seed form you can't say you have absolutely got a tree until the seed has produced a tree well preaching the word is the anchor but making it live is the gospel right if he promised the holy spirit that's the word and receiving the holy spirit is making it live manifesting and if he promised these blessings by the word then accepting the word and producing what he said what it said is the gospel go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and the very next line is proof that teaching of the word won't wouldn't do it that just teaching the word would not do it said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast their out devils evil spirits speak with new towns take up serpents drink deadly things that would not harm them lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now that's the gospel and theology and teaching has substituted that place now if we're not careful this is where we come to in this end time another group of people who substitute for the word for the true gospel theology and teaching amen now but in all of this there is a woman can you hear me prophesied in the scripture amen that she is persistent to not have the word that are unfulfilled words to not have empty promises amen and she'll go before the judge hallelujah we know who the judge is the supreme judge the weak one she will go before him and say give me my mountain give me my promise give me my word give me my healing give me my deliverance give us the holy ghost give us young people that are filled with the spirit give us and we're not giving up we'll keep coming until we get it [Applause] and seek and keep on seeking until it's given to us amen not just satisfied we're just becoming another denominational there is a woman let me read about her and god of this he believes but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride the person here there here somewhere else or out there some of your tennessee and virginia over in wherever you're at across the world over in south africa and africa and uganda or wherever you're at listening today amen or whether you're listening or not if you're part of the bride you're it amen you are there this person here their little faith woman that lives by faith amen believes the word of god obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she's watching for it she's a part of that word and she's watching for her life to manifest that word hallelujah i believe there's a little faith woman in that spelling this morning she's just locked out amen this one here that one there back in the mezzanine or up there in the back they've been a little fake woman a man that is waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed watching foreign she is part of that word and watching for her life to manifest that word she's not satisfied with just empty promises brethren can you see that i hope that didn't go over you and he tries it again saying it this way the body is waiting for which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm or make it alive and he said that's what she's waiting for no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way she feels out that that way and she knows it's going to happen and then it happens and then she wakes up and god said let there be and she come forth just like the first one come forth so you see there she is waiting in love looking expecting she hasn't given up amen listen i haven't given up on a rapture i've been preaching in 52 years now been expecting a lot longer than that but i haven't given up on it i haven't given up on being a part of it amen to build their lives and remain at the coming of the lord hallelujah amen i haven't given up on any divine promise i'm waiting in love to see it manifest but it isn't complacent waiting i'm before the judge saying even so come lord jesus amen you opened up the seventh seal and and the the mysteries have been revealed and the prayers of the saints released a man that said they even so come lord jesus and you're bringing about the end time and i see it happen hallelujah i see things happening amen even where we're at right now you're chafing against it you're worried about it all of the attacks of the enemy and the covid situation and the politics and the roughness of our country but it's all a part of the plan of god but now let me finish the quote because in this you'll see you're either that little faith woman or your children of disobedience children of rebellion because just as there is a woman that is persistent there is a woman persisting and rejecting rejecting his headship rejecting his authority rejecting his power she don't want him she don't want his children because the only kind the word can bring forth oh brother i knew you'd go there yes i did i just did the only kind of word can bring forth amen is those tom speaking acts 238 blabbering screaming youngest hallelujah children that are born of the word not born of the church but in the part of the word their spirit [Applause] children of disobedience disobedience means rebellion brother brandon said i looked it up in the dictionary to be sure rebelling rebellion guess what the revealed word of god like cain revealed rebelled against abel's revealed revelation vindicated god that it was righteous and came rebelled against it and slew his brother if that spirit isn't there today to fight against the movement of the holy ghost the pharisees with their own denominational knowledge of what the word was selected hand-picked men rebelled against the vindicated word of god made manifest for that day jesus christ and killed him that's right that's what the children of disobedience is is a rebellion against the word of god now you see where there are old days of miracles this past jesus christ is not the same yet there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost all that stuff is nonsense see rebellion they don't have to say two things just have one just just rebel on one that's all that's rebellion right there they can't say you have you don't have eyes you you don't have ears you got to take the whole body the whole word and the holy spirit says come out of her be not partakers of her denominational dogma as he laughs and scorns at the word of god in this day for god is not malt just remember she'll get it don't be worried she will get it the bible galatians 6 7-9 said god is not mocked whatever man sows that he will also reap they can't mock and make fun and say these things and get by with it like a bread on the water it'll return but there has to become a woman a little faith woman it has to be she's prophesied and not one word of god will ever fall to the ground just as sure as the manual came a virgin conceived even so the same promise applies to pride in this end time amen what's now there has been churches churches brides bride churches brides rights but there's got to come one hey man there's got to come a real bride there's got to be one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection and until we come that place until we find that place what does it good do it good to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or a lift or a a simonized job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a dynamics to make it work and you don't have the message until you have the dynamics because without the dynamics the message is only a theology a lifeless word now in the evidence of the resurrection brother branham talks about the evening time i like this because we named our church after the evening light a tabernacle a dwelling place for the evening light so let me say this with humility let me say this with a broken voice but with a broken heart too it's evening time the bible says it'll be light in the evening time there will be a day that it won't be neither day or night or night or day the prophet said it'll just be hearing the word with no manifestation hearing the word with no manifestation just a gloomy foggy day but in the evening time the light will shine again it'll be light and this in this evening time that we're now living with christ through his ministers has preached the gospel for 2000 years but this is the evening light and the evening lights was the manifestation of the resurrection hallelujah so isn't it something that right here in the middle where the king is being rejected like he was 2 000 years ago there's a resurrection taking place a resurrection first out of dark denominationalism and then a physical resurrection of the dead in christ without manifestation people are just in a fog of theology because there's no life to what you're preaching it's not even the gospel they turn the message into a dead creed now i just want to say that is not our problem we have been hearing the word we we have been hearing the word with manifestation the manifestation today though about many it is it is the real problem there there is no manifestation with the word that's being preached the word is preached without manifestation the manifestation of cleansing from sin is missing although they receive a knowledge of the truth can quote the seals and tell you this and this greek word but they can't live right amen to continue living in sin blaming it on their flesh amen as if the flesh is greater than the holy ghost don't blame your flesh blame your lack of experience this is why men and women are still living in sin is because the flesh is not killed out amen and there they still have as they still have all these lust of the flesh that are being manifested because there is no spirit of god in them to control it so brother tim we always have this flesh you will you do it's always a problem it is it isn't converted that's true but you're converted amen and greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world come on church amen although they receive a knowledge of the truth the manifestation of gifts and miracles is non-existent healing is almost non-existence tongues are scorned interpretation prophecy despised discernment of spirits missing although the word has been taught it's only theology unless the spirit is there to give it life you see the word does not profit unless it's mixed with faith amen all all of god doing what he did in this day and hour sending a prophet giving us a message is all without profit unless somebody mixes it with faith amen it'll just be hearing the word with no manifestation that's the reason for the fog and the gloom because of this and that no one can see clearly but let the evening light shine it's the manifestation of the resurrection a living god amen so brother bradham said this and it is the rising of the sun because i live you shall live also and i live in you and the works that i do john 14 12 the works i do will identify myself in you what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be light at the evening time what does that mean god will restore a church to faith again amen just like he did to sarah who never got it until she became persistent until she judged him faithful who had made the promise until the angel came with the visitation and turned her heart to believe it and that's what this message was to do turn your heart to believe it he had to get her believing before she could receive the seed until then she's always believing it was for somebody else that hagar will take it give it to a bonds woman do it out here in denominations somewhere you know they can but i can't but god will restore a church now one such woman in the bible was tamar yeah he ever read the bible some strange stories in the bible but they're more than strange stories and prophecies in those days a child was a woman's worth it was her life to not have children was considered a disgrace in the bible we read of the the women that would use desperate measure to catch the seed and remember this woman tamar is mentioned in the bible you know when the light of judah was about to be extinguished and the seed line for the king was about to be put out amen the light of judah was about to be put off put out completely and without that there would be no king and without that there would be no messiah hallelujah but there is a faith that rises up in a woman you may not think it's faith i i'm not nothing with faith but something was moving on the inside of her a drive a passion hallelujah amen and and that right at the moment when the light of judah was about to be put out hear this woman rises up hallelujah somebody's got to catch the seed somebody's got to bring the life somebody's got to rise that'll believe er the son of judah from whose lineage was to come to king and the king messiah died because of his wickedness leaving tamar widow so she's given to her brother onan to raise up seed and he did wickedly and he died and then judah's younger brother was with our excuse me uh the younger son was withheld from her and if you read the story she goes to great length hey man see you talk about a woman persistent yes come on amen amen you wonder sometimes what was driving her there was prophecy to be fulfilled amen it was more than a human desire it was god's desire bring forth that seed break for that life yes can't you see what i'm talking about amen it's more it's more than human effort it's more than men and women's and well i just want to be a part i just want and i'm going to try i'm trying to put past my best effort there was something supernatural moving upon chamar [Applause] i've got to catch that seed i've got to have that life i know it's strange thinking to us in this day but it's it's exactly the way it was judah's younger son had been withheld from her and she begins to devise a plan she snares and traps judah himself into giving her the seed amen what was this passion within that woman or within the women of that time to bring forth i i've got to have more than empty promises you you gave me error as a husband but it was an empty promise you you gave me on it as a as a as a as a promise but it was an empty promise so what did she do she went to june and said give me that seed hey man she actually had to go and and become as a harlot and sit along beside the way after his wife had died it looks crude it even looks wicked and it crosses human mind and it's way out of your thinking but there was something driving that woman i don't care what it takes i don't care what they call me i don't care what i have to do i've got to have that seed that the king has got to come forward and i'll tell you the same thing in our day at our hour friend they may want to call you fanatic they want to call you emotional they want to say it's something scriptural it is some clues and it ain't right and everything else but i'll tell you there's a drive with the other pride he left in this last day i'll do whatever i can hallelujah i'll snare him up love the way i'll catch a hold of his garment but he will come into me i'm gonna bring forth his life whatever it takes i gotta have more than empty promises we've got to have the life i've got promises i've got word i've got a contract i had a marriage i have i have the kinsmen redeemer vows i've got all of that but i've got to have that life there's another woman by the name of rahab rahab in the bible is a woman who received the message from the spies she was as rotten to the core as she could be that right young beautiful woman a heathen to start with prostitute on the street amen see you know i wonder wonder what in the world was driving this woman all this time again it seems strange it seems crude that's right but here's a woman a harlot could you imagine god did this he sent his he sent his messengers to a harlot this is where he sent her to a harlot a woman desirous a woman with a drive an ambition and when she finally found these men there she said you know she she heard that god he was not an idol that said dumb a man or decoration of creeds but you know a lifeless god that we worship like baptism methodist and presbyterian crucified savior but there she she wanted a god who lived among his people and anointed them with signs and wonders followed them and she had heard about it she had dreamed about it oh if there was some way to know that god if there was some way to be a part of that people if there was some way a drive within this woman an ambition joshua two at nine she reveals her heart she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you that land i know the lord has given you the land i know his promises are true and your terror is falling upon us come on church quit thinking about this terrible devil out here amen the devil is recognizing come on he's recognizing the power in this bride and her terror is falling upon him [Music] hallelujah amen she said you're making devils triple you're making them shaking their boots you're you're making them they're they're shutting up the walls they're afraid they're scared of you this is a whole different testimony than what they had of the 12 spies those other 10 said that giants are bigger than us here now you're finding out what the devil's really thinking i mean you see this is what he's afraid of he's afraid of that woman rising in faith so he does everything he can to discourage her it's not for you it's not the hour you see it's not the season for miracles god doesn't do that anymore all the while the devil knows come on amen your terror is falling upon us amen and that all the inhabitants of the land faint hey we're devils are fainting because of you you know why because you're you've got the gospel and it's more than words because in my name you will cast out devils come on you lay hands on the sink and they shall recover amen we will we will possess the land every man in the land your terror has fallen upon us and the inhabitants of the land faith because of you for we have hurt that god still does miracles that he healed a sciatic nerve last night hey man he put a little baby's bones back together there didn't have to have to have rods in her arm last monday come on amen that he's healing those with covet and sickness and diseases and troubles amen and even those that lost their taste and smell gets them back because we're going to recover all hallelujah is there a people in this hour let's let we'll return her off we're going to get our children back we're going to get our wife we're getting our husbands we'll get every [Applause] the devils have heard how the strength rises in the people so he wants to raise up sam alex and other naysayers and say you can't build this wall you can't restore this city you can't bring us back to the city of our god you'll never have a restored church but i tell you there's a word against your satan it said i will restore saith the lord and there's a little faith woman a little faith woman that believes that hallelujah we've heard how the lord heals cancer we have heard we have heard the devil knows brain bleeds were stopped [Applause] amen we the devil knows amen amen the devil knows he had no power to take sister karen's life [Applause] the devil knows he didn't do it amen but she was answered to the other side hallelujah you hear what i'm saying about [Applause] we have heard how the lord drowned up the waters of the red sea for you when you come out of egypt what you did to the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan shah on the nog whom you utterly destroyed we heard what you've done to devils before we're we're really afraid and as soon as we heard these things our heart did melt neither did there remain any more courage than any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven and an earth of heaven above and earth beneath i just come to realize this little woman faith had come in her heart i've got a revelation that that jehovah are you with me he is god in heaven above and the earth beneath hallelujah because of your god because of your trust in him because of your faith in him hallelujah amen our hearts have melted

blue ass let me find that one that can restore all i want more than empty promises the story of how a woman travailed a spirit who would not give up until she brought forth a prophet is that right amen there there she was year after year going up a cry within her heart she would not give up she would not give up on the promise of a son but the promises cannot be turned to me empty that's the way it's gonna be for you with for your healing amen the promise will not return unto me empty god will do what he said he would do [Applause] come on church amen i believe that i stood there actually

helped me preach the evening light it's the time the fog is removed it's the time of manifestation [Music] there it hannah's hand upwards and of prayed at i prayed they asked me to lead in prayer i was so moved by that moment even the scriptures that i had read and i even the psalms and it would it seemed like it would be taken right from hannah's own prayer in that songs that i'd read and now i'm hearing these words again it's written on a on on a on a plaque these whole words all over again and i'm looking at them again my heart has moved and they asked me to lead in prayer and i prayed oh god for the barren among us to give life hallelujah amen i called the name of bethany who had been trying time after time miscarriage after miscarriage was it four miscarriages five the number of

happened she had two beautiful boys but there she was seeking desiring life i know it's promise i know it's the word and i'll not give up on it and there i prayed for her as a bearing womb hallelujah and we got a little brook here this morning as a trophy where god answered that prayer [Music] hallelujah amen we prayed for candace yes amen we asked god to give cabinet candace a child amen right

the bride of christ be anointed with faith to accept the promise of god [Applause] hallelujah these are women of faith i've been preaching about let the musicians come and i am speaking about the church the bride of christ who the woman must have a passionate faith to bring forth to see the life of christ it's more to them than receiving the word as far as doctrines go they must have the life manifest hallelujah they must have that life manifested maybe you can look at your life this morning and say there's been some barrenness in my life oh god anoint me this morning anoint me strangely anoint me the way you strangely anointed these women of the past anoint this bride this morning that ought to be the prayer of this church and annoying us to bring forth the king brother branham would say our faith isn't right we're hearing the message god has given us intellectually seeing the signs he showed us proven it by the bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so conveyed down why don't you say shine on me lord can you play that shine on me let the light from the lighthouse let this evening light shine on me [Music] this word should be my moment now [Music] a barren church we've been bearing 2 000 years [Music] we had a promise given [Music] promises got confirmed with signs and wonders voice out of heaven saying [Music] voice out of heaven said [Music] this message will forerun the second coming of jesus christ the pentecostals caught it in their meetings they were the church then don't
