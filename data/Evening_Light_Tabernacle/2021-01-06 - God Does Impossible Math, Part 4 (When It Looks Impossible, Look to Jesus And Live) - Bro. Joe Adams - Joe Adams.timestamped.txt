[16:23] we just commit this service to you
[16:25] tonight lord we thank you for
[16:27] the opportunity we thank you lord for
[16:28] this church
[16:30] we thank you for the people and the
[16:32] ministry that we have surrounded here
[16:34] lord
[16:34] lord it goes beyond the four walls of
[16:36] this building father
[16:38] this is a universal worldwide ministry
[16:40] lord and
[16:41] we we're partakers of that tonight each
[16:44] of us
[16:44] have a part to play and lord we want to
[16:47] do our part tonight
[16:49] and we just asked lord you just come by
[16:51] and move
[16:54] moving every heart moving every life
[16:56] those on the stream lord move there as
[16:58] well
[16:58] father we just committed a service to
[17:01] you now lord in jesus name
[17:03] amen if you have your bibles tonight
[17:04] we'll have you turn to hebrews 12.
[17:07] we're going to look here in verse 1 and
[17:09] verse 2. hebrews 12 verse 1 and verse 2
[17:12] and i want to speak to you tonight
[17:13] so i want to pick back up on god does
[17:16] impossible math remember when we spoke
[17:18] about god does impossible math the very
[17:20] first time
[17:21] we want to think about the math problem
[17:23] as being a problem
[17:24] and a lot of times we don't have the
[17:26] necessary answer because some of the
[17:28] problems can be so difficult
[17:29] but i want to subtitle this tonight when
[17:32] it looks impossible
[17:34] look to jesus and live so when it looks
[17:37] impossible too
[17:38] impossible for you it's never too
[17:41] impossible for him
[17:42] so we're going to look here tonight in
[17:43] hebrews 12 it says wherefore
[17:46] seeing we we also are compassed about
[17:48] with so great
[17:49] a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[17:52] every weight
[17:53] and sin of unbelief which so do easily
[17:56] beset us and let us
[17:58] run with patience that word patience
[17:59] there is hooper monet means
[18:01] steadfast endurance let us
[18:04] run the race with patience that is set
[18:07] before us
[18:08] looking unto jesus the author and the
[18:11] finisher of our faith
[18:12] who for the joy was set before him
[18:14] endured the cross despising the shame
[18:17] and he sat down at the right hand of the
[18:18] throne of god
[18:20] you can have your seats this evening
[18:25] now we find that we're here this is the
[18:29] second service of our new year
[18:32] we can certainly say that there's
[18:34] probably a lot of anxieties that we're
[18:36] all facing what's going to happen in the
[18:38] political system
[18:39] here in on january 22nd or sometime
[18:42] around there or
[18:43] you know what's taking place in georgia
[18:45] today as far as the election there
[18:47] so we found that there's so much that we
[18:49] don't know
[18:51] and there's so much that we've already
[18:53] come through and if if we take our focus
[18:56] and our attention as believers and
[18:57] that's all that we put our focus on
[18:59] and that's what we always put our
[19:01] attention on that i'm afraid we're going
[19:03] to miss the visitation of the lord
[19:05] i'm afraid that if that's all we can see
[19:07] and yes
[19:09] you know it looks impossible how we're
[19:10] going to get out of this you know will
[19:12] there be a republican in the party and
[19:13] all these different things
[19:14] but i want us tonight to not think about
[19:17] who's going to be in the white house or
[19:18] who's going to be in the political
[19:20] systems or anything of that nature
[19:22] or if there's going to be another
[19:23] pandemic and you know the covet is
[19:25] already
[19:25] uh mutated and it's it's spreading even
[19:28] faster and stronger and it's got worse
[19:30] side effects
[19:31] and more people are dying starting out
[19:33] we don't want to consume ourselves with
[19:35] fears and anxieties of the world i want
[19:37] you to take your eyes
[19:38] off of those things tonight and i want
[19:40] us to put our eyes back on jesus
[19:44] so we finally the prophet of god will
[19:46] tell us in the message the end time
[19:48] he says you always talk about how bad
[19:51] the world is
[19:52] and we can surely say man that seems
[19:54] like the talk of the town right
[19:56] he says how wicked the world is he said
[19:58] this true
[20:00] but look how great the church is getting
[20:03] all the time
[20:05] so astounding letting your attention and
[20:07] your focus go to how bad the world's
[20:09] getting
[20:09] won't you turn it on the devil and say
[20:11] devil it's getting bad out there
[20:13] but look how powerful this church is
[20:15] getting
[20:16] look how powerful the bride is getting
[20:18] more and more
[20:20] he said when the world's getting
[20:21] wickeder and wickeder and wickeder
[20:24] their church is getting more powerful
[20:26] and powerful
[20:27] all the time the church that you tonight
[20:31] is getting more powerful and powerful
[20:33] all the time
[20:35] then he says in redemption by power he
[20:37] says you're always pointing
[20:39] how wicked the world is getting but you
[20:41] fail to see
[20:42] how powerful the church is getting
[20:46] at the same time say she's rising up
[20:48] standing on the field
[20:50] oh she's a little flock but brother god
[20:52] is with her
[20:54] and she's gonna try them just as certain
[20:57] as christ
[20:57] rose from the dead amen god's church
[21:00] shall
[21:00] never fail you hear that this evening
[21:03] god's church
[21:04] shall never fail so when you face the
[21:06] enemy tomorrow morning
[21:08] and he's coming he's lying about you and
[21:10] he's telling this on you and he's in
[21:12] your face
[21:13] ridiculing you about this and beating
[21:14] you down about this you let him know
[21:16] god's church will never fail
[21:21] he says she's going to triumph just as
[21:22] certain as christ rose from the dead
[21:24] amen god's church shall never fail the
[21:26] gates of hell
[21:28] shall not prophet against it it showed
[21:29] that they would be against it
[21:31] but they cannot prevail their church
[21:34] is going to triumph through the blood of
[21:36] jesus christ
[21:38] with the victory march he goes i'm
[21:39] positive of this one thing
[21:41] that god will have a church without spot
[21:45] wrinkle or blemish
[21:48] oh aren't you thankful god sent us a
[21:50] messenger
[21:51] tell us what we got to look forward to
[21:54] you know there's so many out there right
[21:56] now
[21:56] they're looking at what's going on in
[21:58] america and they're judging the world by
[22:00] what's taking place
[22:02] and the american political system has
[22:04] become a worldwide embarrassment
[22:06] and everybody understands the end time
[22:08] is at hand
[22:09] but the prophet of god said end time
[22:11] people must meet end time conditions
[22:14] i say bring it on lord because we're
[22:17] ready and the endtime people
[22:18] has been given a promise of an end time
[22:20] rapture
[22:23] but the bible tells us we are to run
[22:25] this race
[22:26] this conflict this contest that we're in
[22:30] with endurance with with steadfast face
[22:33] looking unto jesus
[22:36] not looking at the race not looking at
[22:38] the contest not looking
[22:40] at the problem not looking at political
[22:42] systems not looking at rise or cobra 19
[22:45] or whatever else
[22:46] but looking unto jesus
[22:51] and in the message his wonders to
[22:53] perform brother branham will begin to
[22:55] speak about
[22:56] mary and joseph and how
[23:00] that that only that could only happen at
[23:02] a certain time in history
[23:05] it could not happen in any other time
[23:09] here he was joseph a godly
[23:12] a real son of god and he was told to
[23:15] take mary or he was going to take mary
[23:16] to be his wife but
[23:17] he found out that she was already
[23:20] pregnant beforehand
[23:21] and he was mindful to put her away but
[23:24] brother brown said the supernatural came
[23:26] to him
[23:27] and told him joseph don't fear to put
[23:30] her away
[23:31] that thing that's inside of her that's
[23:32] conceited is conceit of the holy ghost
[23:35] and and so it began to work on joseph
[23:38] and he said in those days he said if
[23:40] there would have been a king other than
[23:42] king hare that he said he would call him
[23:44] that uh cold-hearted king
[23:46] he said that murder heartless
[23:48] bloodthirsty if there have been another
[23:49] king on the throne
[23:50] it would have never taken place
[23:54] and think about this church and we all
[23:55] know about world war ii and we know
[23:57] about the nazi and
[23:58] the nazi campaign against the jews but
[24:01] that had to take place
[24:03] in a particular moment in time to get
[24:05] god's and laundered people back in their
[24:07] homeland
[24:08] and we find the things that are taking
[24:10] place today it's at an appointed time
[24:13] god has put his right man on the throne
[24:15] to do what to
[24:16] usher in not the satanic kingdom but to
[24:19] usher in the kingdom of god where this
[24:21] bride takes a rapture
[24:25] god is bringing us all together and if
[24:28] we sit
[24:28] spiritual dumb well we don't we can't
[24:31] look beyond
[24:32] the trial or we can't look beyond what's
[24:34] going on and we can't look beyond what
[24:35] the chaos that that america is coming
[24:37] into
[24:38] let me tell you church this is what it's
[24:39] supposed to be
[24:42] it has to be this and in that time if
[24:46] there would have never been a hair that
[24:47] would have never been a taxation
[24:50] mary and joseph would have never went to
[24:51] bethlehem but they had to go to
[24:53] bethlehem because it had to fulfill
[24:55] scripture
[24:57] so every precept of god's eternal word
[25:00] has to happen
[25:01] according to the time schedule and we're
[25:05] right on time
[25:07] because he's right on time the thing is
[25:10] take your eyes off what you're looking
[25:12] at around you and put your
[25:14] eyes back on the promise
[25:17] the world's getting wicked brother joe
[25:18] absolutely but look at the bride
[25:21] look at the bride look at the
[25:23] manifestation of the supernatural
[25:26] that's being performed in and through
[25:29] the body
[25:34] oh let me tell you probably god will say
[25:36] he says look know this
[25:38] if god is leading the way what
[25:40] difference does it make
[25:43] god will protect you to your destination
[25:47] oh did you hear that little church god
[25:49] will protect you to your destination
[25:52] he says there's no dangers when you're
[25:54] walking with the lord he goes i would
[25:56] believe easily that there
[25:58] was a host of ten thousand angels
[26:00] walking there around
[26:01] that little man and that donkey she was
[26:04] just as safe as she could be speaking
[26:06] about
[26:07] about uh mary there she was just as safe
[26:11] as she could be that may have been
[26:12] robbers all down the street and here
[26:14] he was had a pregnant wife on the donkey
[26:16] leading them down to bethlehem
[26:18] he wasn't concerned about the robbers he
[26:20] wasn't concerned about
[26:21] what he was going to face when he got to
[26:23] bethlehem he knew one thing
[26:24] he said we got to go and be taxed and so
[26:26] when he do he
[26:27] obeyed the word and when you obey the
[26:31] word you do
[26:32] you don't have to have one fear because
[26:35] god will protect you to your destination
[26:37] so i ask you tonight what difference
[26:39] does 2021 make
[26:40] what difference if there is another
[26:42] virus what difference is there more
[26:44] rise or civil unrest what does it matter
[26:46] to the body of christ
[26:47] god is going to protect us into the
[26:50] destination
[26:52] that's one thing i realized a couple
[26:54] years ago when i when i went over to
[26:56] monroe and tried to buy a phone from my
[26:57] daughter and that man held a knife up to
[26:59] my throat
[27:00] god his hand was upon my life
[27:04] and as i looked to my son i said it
[27:05] shows you that god that the satan can't
[27:07] do anything to you but whether
[27:09] god allows it to happen and the god that
[27:12] we serve is greater than the enemy that
[27:14] threatens us each and every day but the
[27:17] bible will tell us we're compassed about
[27:21] with a great cloud of witnesses
[27:24] i can just see him standing over the
[27:26] eternal banister the grandstands looking
[27:28] over that banister
[27:30] cheering us on keep pushing keep running
[27:32] keep moving forward and i say like paul
[27:35] we need to lay us out every weight of
[27:37] sin every weight of unbelief
[27:40] everything that's driving our attention
[27:42] and grabbing our minds and making us
[27:44] doubt the promise
[27:44] and laying aside and run this race
[27:47] tonight
[27:48] let's look at 2021 without
[27:50] redetermination we're going to serve god
[27:54] we're going to live for god we're going
[27:55] to persevere we're going to press on
[27:57] no matter what we face in this life god
[27:59] is for us
[28:01] so who can be against us
[28:05] need to lay aside all the weights of
[28:06] complexes
[28:09] all right get quiet it's okay we all
[28:11] have them but lay them aside
[28:14] lay aside your grudges tonight
[28:18] lay aside your past regrets or your
[28:20] failures lay aside the weights of your
[28:22] fears
[28:23] lay aside depression pornography anxiety
[28:26] lay it all aside tonight
[28:29] and let's put our eyes back on jesus
[28:32] turn your eyes from the disappointments
[28:34] that you faced in the heartaches
[28:35] that you had in 2020 and let's look at
[28:39] 2021
[28:41] and let's just focus our eyes tonight
[28:44] on him on his promise on the god that
[28:48] does the impossible
[28:51] this message becomes so real to me
[28:53] because there's things in life that we
[28:54] face that we need a god as brother john
[28:56] said the other day with skin on it
[28:58] we need a god that's bigger than our
[29:00] trials we need a god that's bigger
[29:02] than our impossibilities we need a god
[29:04] to come by and reassure
[29:05] us that he's greater and he's bigger and
[29:08] that all
[29:09] things are possible if you can only
[29:12] believe tonight
[29:15] the word here look means to turn the
[29:17] eyes away from other things
[29:19] and fix them on something so turn your
[29:23] eyes away from all these other things
[29:24] tonight
[29:25] and let's fix them on jesus let's turn
[29:28] our eyes away from politics and turn our
[29:30] eyes away from medical science because
[29:32] man they're so confused with this cover
[29:33] 19 it took them nine months to figure it
[29:36] out
[29:36] and they still don't have everything
[29:38] figured out they're constantly changing
[29:40] their
[29:40] their point of view of this one and that
[29:42] one and this and that
[29:44] 14 days 10 days seven days wear a mask
[29:46] don't wear a mask it helps it doesn't
[29:48] help
[29:48] we're just so confused but if our minds
[29:51] and our attention are put back on him
[29:54] we don't care we can go and kiss covet
[29:56] in the mouth and never get it because
[29:57] why because our eyes are focused on him
[29:59] now i'm not telling you to do that but
[30:01] i'm just telling you we could
[30:05] we need to put our eyes back on the
[30:07] supernatural
[30:09] see brother you talk a lot about
[30:10] supernatural you're an emotional kind of
[30:12] guy i'm sorry i am
[30:14] i don't believe in being a boring church
[30:18] i mean if i want to go to a boring
[30:20] church i go to a morgue
[30:23] and i don't like going to morgues i've
[30:25] never been there but i don't have a
[30:26] fancy to look at dead people
[30:28] and nor do i think i need to waste my
[30:30] time coming to church on a wednesday
[30:32] or sunday and thus just coming to a debt
[30:35] service
[30:36] i think we should enjoy serving god i
[30:38] think we should
[30:39] be expecting god to move i think every
[30:42] service we should come with an
[30:43] expectation
[30:44] will this be my service will this be my
[30:47] moment
[30:47] will this be my hour will this be my
[30:50] turn where god comes down
[30:51] in the supernatural and touches me
[30:57] see we need to look put our eyes on the
[30:59] supernatural i know there's others that
[31:01] don't want to believe in the
[31:02] supernatural that's fine don't let them
[31:03] believe
[31:04] they can believe what they want to
[31:05] believe but for me and my house we're
[31:06] going to believe that god does them
[31:08] miraculous
[31:10] we're going to believe in that and
[31:11] brother bannon was saved but brother god
[31:13] always listen now
[31:14] for those that don't believe in the
[31:15] supernatural this is the message
[31:17] escape hither come quickly 1958 he says
[31:21] brother god
[31:21] always vindicates himself by being in
[31:24] the camp with supernatural signs and
[31:26] wonders
[31:28] god always makes himself known he's
[31:31] supernatural
[31:32] and he cannot be anything or work any
[31:35] other way
[31:36] but through supernatural
[31:40] well we don't believe in altar calls and
[31:43] you don't believe in god
[31:45] we don't believe in divine healing you
[31:47] don't believe in god
[31:48] we don't believe in the movement of the
[31:50] spirit where you don't believe in god we
[31:52] don't believe in speaking in tongues
[31:53] well you don't believe in god
[31:56] because god is supernatural and that
[31:59] word supernatural
[32:00] means it goes beyond the existence of
[32:02] the visible
[32:04] i'm gonna tell you we've seen a lot of
[32:05] supernatural take place and even like
[32:07] tabernacle
[32:09] there's a lot of things that god came by
[32:10] to let you know he's on the
[32:12] he's on the uh on the on the on on the
[32:15] well i can't even speak can i
[32:18] but he's on the scene that's what i was
[32:19] looking for god's on the scene tonight
[32:22] he's on the scene for your need
[32:24] many times we look at our neighbors and
[32:26] well my neighbor got blessed
[32:28] and we get all down and out my my
[32:29] neighbor god bless let me tell you when
[32:31] your neighbor gets blessed that should
[32:32] make you happy you say why brother joe
[32:34] because they'll let you know god's on
[32:36] time god's in the service and you may be
[32:38] next
[32:40] oh if he hit your neighbor what about
[32:42] you he's right there
[32:47] god is supernatural we should expect a
[32:49] supernatural
[32:50] in the message of the token the prophet
[32:51] of god will say i'm looking for a time
[32:53] to break forth
[32:55] of the spirit of god in these last days
[32:57] that we're living that we're now living
[32:59] in
[32:59] for another surge of the holy spirit
[33:03] now notice the healing revival is over
[33:07] it's ended but the problem of god was
[33:10] looking back toward it
[33:11] i'm looking for another surge of that
[33:14] the manifestations of signs and wonders
[33:18] he says now i'm looking for another
[33:20] surge of the holy spirit into the church
[33:22] for a rapturing faith just before it
[33:25] comes
[33:26] and everything is sitting straight in
[33:28] order for that and i believe that we're
[33:30] now
[33:30] at the time that the word should have
[33:33] preeminence i believe that the time
[33:35] is to lay aside all our creeds and our
[33:37] thoughts and come
[33:38] back to the word so he's on an
[33:42] expectation
[33:43] for a surge of the holy ghost he's not
[33:46] expecting god to drop down in every
[33:48] service and everybody jump up and speak
[33:50] in tongues and run around the church
[33:52] but what he's in what he's expecting is
[33:55] for signs and wonders to surge in
[33:58] and move upon the people and it'll no
[34:00] longer be a one-man ministry
[34:01] where one man has all the power and it
[34:04] seems like it's all coming through that
[34:05] one man
[34:06] but the bible says that we shall do the
[34:08] greater works and he's saying sirs we
[34:10] shall see jesus not jesus justin a
[34:13] prophet
[34:14] but jesus and his bride signs and
[34:16] wonders following the supernatural
[34:18] because the body of christ believes the
[34:20] word of god
[34:24] excuse me for getting a little excited
[34:26] but see he was expecting for another
[34:28] surge of signs and wonders
[34:30] the miraculous being performed i think
[34:33] he'd be happy with even like tabernacle
[34:35] of what's been produced here oh cancer
[34:39] is being defeated
[34:42] parkinson's disease being defeated blind
[34:45] eyes
[34:47] being healed brain bleeds
[34:50] stopped oh
[34:53] let me read you let me read a couple
[34:56] testimonies from my last time i was out
[34:58] in arizona
[34:58] if y'all don't mind me sharing this with
[35:00] you said sunday night i was feeling
[35:02] very sick and i went out i went out of
[35:04] the service this is from brother aaron
[35:05] gara's daughter
[35:07] i sat in the chapel but i ended up
[35:08] missing a good portion of the sermon as
[35:11] brother joe spoke on the pool of
[35:12] bethesda
[35:13] i prayed about how my own lack of faith
[35:15] and desire to be healed
[35:16] from gluten issues and i pray that the
[35:19] lord will start the work and toward the
[35:20] end of the service i went downstairs and
[35:22] i waited in the back
[35:24] brother joe had come to the back and he
[35:25] greeted me and he
[35:27] he stayed standing in the back and i was
[35:30] still feeling pretty bad and i thought
[35:31] to
[35:32] to ask him to pray for me or the thought
[35:34] to asking to pray for me kept coming i
[35:36] didn't want to disturb him
[35:37] but it kept coming and he's right here
[35:39] just asked and i finally did and i told
[35:40] him
[35:42] that i just didn't have faith to believe
[35:44] and i was feeling that it was
[35:45] insignificant
[35:46] and i could just deal with it you know
[35:47] that's what the devil wants you to
[35:48] believe you just can deal with it
[35:50] don't worry you don't have to come up
[35:51] you don't you can just deal with it just
[35:53] deal with your own issue
[35:54] you don't have to have nobody lay hands
[35:56] on you or anything like that and pray
[35:57] for you
[35:58] and she says he told me that i didn't
[36:01] have to
[36:03] he said he told me that i didn't have to
[36:04] ask that if i believed that
[36:06] that he would have faith for me as
[36:08] brother madam said that he and i said
[36:10] yes and
[36:11] so he began to pray and in his prayer he
[36:13] said that
[36:14] he said that us standing in the back
[36:16] together was not a coincidence
[36:19] that it was inspire and it inspired my
[36:20] faith and i realized that the pressure
[36:23] and the pain was gone and i began to
[36:25] rejoice
[36:26] praising and thanking god for what he
[36:28] had done and what he was doing it's now
[36:30] been close to two weeks
[36:31] with me eating wheat almost daily i felt
[36:34] very sick the following saturday but
[36:36] rebuked it and ate it again
[36:37] and again and it left me and i'm
[36:39] completely healed and i'm daily thanking
[36:41] and praising lord he said and she ends
[36:43] it with this
[36:44] and should i add it's been eight years
[36:46] that i've struggled
[36:47] with gluten issues but in one moment's
[36:50] time
[36:52] in the presence of the supernatural then
[36:55] there was another brother brother ed
[36:56] dougal
[36:57] in the same service came up he says i
[37:00] i've had a severe hip and back pain for
[37:02] over 40 years due to a football injury
[37:05] i could hardly walk or bend over to put
[37:06] my shoes on and my socks
[37:08] i felt the presence of the lord nudging
[37:10] me to go through the prayer line but i
[37:12] resisted because i felt that god could
[37:14] heal me where i am
[37:15] that's a lot of us in it and that's okay
[37:18] god can't heal you where you are but
[37:20] there's sometimes you need a god with
[37:21] skin on it
[37:23] he was after several moments i felt the
[37:24] lord nudge me again to go through the
[37:26] prayer line and i came up
[37:28] and i was in lots of pain and after
[37:29] praying i walked back to my seat
[37:31] still in pain but i came back to the
[37:33] evening service and the pain had
[37:35] subsided a lot
[37:37] sunday night i slept for the first time
[37:39] in a long time without pain
[37:40] and i got a good night's sleep i worked
[37:42] all day monday without any pain at
[37:44] all god has completely healed me and now
[37:47] i'm pain-free after 40 years
[37:52] supernatural signs and wonders following
[37:56] the believer
[37:59] sir as we will see jesus
[38:02] we will see jesus manifesting an even
[38:05] like tabernacle
[38:06] and i'm looking at jesus right here
[38:08] tonight those that can believe for the
[38:10] supernatural
[38:11] those that can believe from the
[38:12] prodigals those that can believe for
[38:13] their healing those that can believe
[38:15] no matter what impossibility you face
[38:18] take your eyes off the impossible and
[38:20] put your eyes on jesus tonight
[38:25] well abraham says now i believe that
[38:27] we're now at the time that the word
[38:29] should have
[38:30] preeminence that word there means
[38:32] superiority
[38:33] and if the word is going to have
[38:35] preeminence that means that we got to
[38:36] have the letter
[38:37] and the spirit married together the two
[38:39] got to be unified together
[38:41] and if this the word is to have
[38:42] superiority then it must manifest and
[38:45] produce exactly what it says
[38:49] and it's going to take your faith to put
[38:52] that word in action tonight
[38:54] it's going to take your faith for the 10
[38:57] winners
[38:58] it's going to take your faith brother
[38:59] daryl brother ron sister erica
[39:02] it's going to take your faith to put
[39:04] that word in action
[39:07] he's a god that heals we've seen it time
[39:09] and time again
[39:11] and i want you to know it's not just for
[39:13] the apostles it's not just for the
[39:14] disciples
[39:15] it's for you it's for this church it's
[39:17] for your family
[39:19] it's for your your home whatever it is
[39:21] god is ready to do it tonight
[39:23] if you can believe so i ask you in 2021
[39:26] what are you looking for
[39:28] and what are you looking to are you
[39:31] looking to everything that's going on
[39:32] that cnn and fox news and everything is
[39:35] just
[39:35] throwing at you and throwing at you and
[39:37] throwing at you are we looking
[39:39] to the word of god are we looking to
[39:42] this year could be the year
[39:43] that we actually truly see the coming of
[39:46] the lord
[39:47] because our human minds can't fathom how
[39:49] can it go much further
[39:51] so i asked you what are you looking
[39:55] if you look to jesus you're looking to
[39:57] the author in the finish of our faith
[40:00] you're looking to the one that's the
[40:01] giver of life you're looking to the one
[40:03] he's the waymaker
[40:05] and i believe he's made a way for many
[40:07] of us tonight
[40:08] he's a miracle worker and he's performed
[40:10] a many a miracle and even like
[40:12] tabernacle
[40:13] he just performed one for you guys the
[40:15] other night
[40:16] see that's the god that we serve see
[40:18] when you look to jesus
[40:20] you look to the supernatural
[40:23] but here is the thing church tonight you
[40:25] got to recognize
[40:26] no matter how small or how insignificant
[40:30] the supernatural is or appears to be you
[40:32] got to recognize that to be him
[40:36] we turn our bibles tonight to first
[40:38] kings 18
[40:39] ch verse 41. so first kings 18 and verse
[40:42] 41
[40:49] so we have to be able to recognize jesus
[40:53] when he appears in his supernatural
[40:56] element
[40:57] and we find here in in first kings 18
[41:00] and 41 it says elijah said to ahab get
[41:02] up
[41:02] or get thee up eat and drink for there
[41:05] is a sound
[41:06] of abundance of rain i like how god does
[41:09] it
[41:10] you know they've been in the three and a
[41:11] half year drought they were tired of it
[41:13] but god had come down and told this
[41:15] prophet there's a sound of abundance of
[41:17] rain you go tell king ahab
[41:19] to get up to drink to eat cause it's
[41:21] about to come a storm
[41:24] and we think we've had a lot of rain in
[41:25] louisiana in which we have but we ain't
[41:27] had rain like they got rain
[41:29] and he says now so ahab went up and to
[41:32] eat and to drink and elijah went up to
[41:34] the top of mount carmel
[41:35] and he cast himself down upon the earth
[41:37] and he put his face between his knees
[41:39] what was he doing he was looking unto
[41:41] jesus
[41:43] he began to pray begin to seek god and
[41:46] he said to his servant
[41:47] he says go up now look toward the sea
[41:50] and he went up and he looked and he said
[41:52] there is nothing
[41:53] you know how many times have we gone up
[41:55] how many times we've come to a service
[41:57] looking for god
[41:58] and there was nothing come on church
[42:01] how many times we come with an
[42:02] expectation and we left disappointed and
[42:05] there was nothing
[42:06] but what did elijah tell him he said go
[42:08] back up there again hazel you go seven
[42:10] times and on the seventh time he says i
[42:12] see a cloud rising out of the sea
[42:14] it's a small of a man's hand and the
[42:17] prophet of god said
[42:18] that's the sound of abundance of rain
[42:20] and if you could just recognize all
[42:22] church
[42:22] let me tell you if you can recognize
[42:24] when a little sister begins to call out
[42:26] to god
[42:26] in a service that's the sound of the
[42:29] abundance of rain
[42:31] god is passing by or when our sister
[42:35] begins to speak in tongues and call out
[42:37] oh that's the sound of abundance of rain
[42:40] god is moving
[42:41] in the church in the supernatural realm
[42:45] but you got to recognize it you got to
[42:48] recognize
[42:49] that's that's of god
[42:52] could you just think let's think of how
[42:53] unbelievable look at that little hand
[42:56] huh wing it had rain in a year three and
[42:58] a half years it's so hot
[43:01] and there is a cloud that's all you can
[43:03] produce is a cloud that big
[43:07] you gotta do better than that that's how
[43:09] unbelief
[43:11] but elijah had faith because god had
[43:14] already told them
[43:16] there's a sound coming there's a sound
[43:19] coming into the church
[43:20] it's the surge of the supernatural
[43:23] there's going to be more of what we've
[43:24] seen
[43:26] there's going to be more of what we've
[43:28] been witnessing in this tower
[43:30] it's not just going to be here and even
[43:31] like tabernacle there's going to be
[43:33] testimonies around the world because why
[43:35] because that little cloud became a
[43:37] massive thunderstorm
[43:39] let me tell you that's all that elijah
[43:41] needed to know what that little cloud
[43:43] can rain down upon a nation and let me
[43:45] tell you church tonight
[43:47] all it takes is one little child of god
[43:49] with faith to believe
[43:50] it'll rain down the presence of god in a
[43:53] church service
[43:54] and it'll impact your family from many
[43:56] generations if you can just take god in
[43:57] his word tonight
[43:58] and put your eyes on him
[44:03] elijah he was looking for something to
[44:06] come to bring help to the people
[44:09] and god told them if they would repent
[44:11] something would happen
[44:13] and he was looking and he sent his
[44:14] servant up go up and look
[44:16] something is going to happen three and a
[44:18] half years no rain no cloud not even do
[44:21] fallen
[44:22] but he said go look you come to service
[44:25] sunday and didn't get anything
[44:27] go look
[44:30] you come tonight and it appears maybe
[44:33] you're not getting anything
[44:35] go look
[44:38] you come on sunday morning come looking
[44:41] if you don't get it on sunday come to
[44:42] the next wednesday service looking
[44:45] looking with your eyes i want to see
[44:47] jesus i'm going to see
[44:49] jesus there's a sound of abundance of
[44:51] rain let me tell you the problem of god
[44:53] will say listen
[44:54] tell you what let us do he says let's do
[44:57] like elijah
[44:58] let's get the things right let's get
[45:00] back to god
[45:01] then elijah put his head down and he
[45:03] prayed and he said god he cried out god
[45:07] sent rain and i said that should be our
[45:09] prayer tonight
[45:10] god send the supernatural rain down of
[45:12] your words tonight
[45:13] give us eyes that can see give us ears
[45:15] that can hear
[45:16] give us hearts that can receive and give
[45:18] us the spirit to rejoice
[45:20] in your presence tonight let us not be
[45:22] some old crap down
[45:23] nobody don't want to worship god or
[45:25] worry about what somebody's going to
[45:27] think about
[45:27] lord let us be free to serve you tonight
[45:32] let us be free to worship you you
[45:34] deserve our worship
[45:35] you deserve our praise god don't let me
[45:38] be hell
[45:38] oh god don't let me be held responsible
[45:41] for sending you in the corner
[45:42] and not making you welcome tonight
[45:47] notice now elijah said i hear the sound
[45:51] of abundance of rain go tell ahab to
[45:54] gird up his loin and go
[45:56] go to jezreel because there's a great
[45:57] rain coming but unbelief would say huh
[46:01] if that's all you can see and take it
[46:02] back
[46:04] if that's all church is you can have it
[46:08] if it's all cells and no anchors you can
[46:10] have it
[46:12] it ain't all cells and no anchors
[46:15] this word has got an anchor that can
[46:17] hold you in your time of your worst
[46:18] storm
[46:19] here to hold you like a hell brother
[46:21] gary you may be here tonight just
[46:23] bumping against the ground
[46:24] bum bum bum but you let that bump grab
[46:27] hold one time
[46:28] that's all it takes all unbelief want to
[46:31] tell you well there's no god out there
[46:32] and there's no supernatural
[46:34] and god doesn't do miracles anymore but
[46:36] let me tell you you get on the back side
[46:37] of the desert one time
[46:39] and you meet god and god becomes
[46:41] personal to you there ain't enough
[46:42] devils in hell can explain away god from
[46:44] you then
[46:45] because you've tasted and you've seen
[46:47] and you've rejoiced
[46:48] and you witnessed and you accepted the
[46:50] supernatural and it's changed your life
[46:57] unbelief would have picked that up and
[46:59] throwed it away well that's all you can
[47:02] send me
[47:03] for what did elijah do at the very first
[47:06] wheel turn
[47:08] he said i hear the sound of abundance of
[47:10] rain no cloud no bigger than that
[47:12] that would do how's that going to water
[47:14] a nation why
[47:15] if it's god if it's if it's the clouds
[47:18] it's so hot in them skies
[47:20] he goes down would have been vaporized
[47:22] the vapor would have went away like that
[47:24] but as soon as elijah saw the first time
[47:27] the first little teeny movie said i hear
[47:30] the sound
[47:34] sometimes church i just want you to clue
[47:36] in when we hear like sister atlanta does
[47:38] at times not every service
[47:40] but there's times she grins to call out
[47:42] to god
[47:45] that's the first little move a lot of
[47:47] times that's the first little move
[47:53] we think well that's just her and that's
[47:54] just who she is no that's not her and
[47:56] that's who she is
[47:57] she's not that kind of person but what
[48:00] is that that's a sign to this church
[48:01] that god is here
[48:03] and god is moving and somebody doesn't
[48:06] care what you think about it
[48:08] because they're hearing the sound of
[48:10] abundance of rain
[48:11] and if you would stand where she's
[48:13] standing and where she stood
[48:15] several years ago faith with a a disease
[48:18] that was threatened to take her life let
[48:20] me tell you
[48:20] she rejoices in that sound because she
[48:22] knows and she's testified
[48:24] that there's a god on the scene that's
[48:26] bigger than cancer
[48:28] oh let me tell you if god can take care
[48:30] of cancer for her
[48:31] and deliver her within two months what
[48:33] can that same supernatural god
[48:35] do for you tonight he can save the lost
[48:38] loved ones
[48:38] he can heal the sick body he can deliver
[48:41] from the torment spirit
[48:42] because why all you got to do is
[48:44] recognize the supernatural
[48:46] in whatever element he decides to come
[48:54] notice now brother ram said that elijah
[48:57] was looking
[48:58] for the supernatural
[49:01] he was looking for he came expecting
[49:04] god to move a lot of times i think we
[49:09] come just to come
[49:11] but let's come in 2021 with an
[49:14] expectation
[49:15] for god to move for lebron i mean excuse
[49:18] me brother tim's been preaching on
[49:20] sincerity
[49:21] let us come with an expectation to be
[49:24] sincere at home to pray and to
[49:26] to pray for the services to pray for the
[49:28] ministry to pray well for what god is
[49:31] doing and what god
[49:32] wants to do in this church
[49:35] in your home in your life
[49:39] so we find here that cloud was all that
[49:42] elijah needed
[49:45] and this service may be all that you
[49:47] need tonight
[49:48] to recognize that there's a sound of
[49:50] abundance
[49:52] there's a sound of abundance oh he says
[49:54] we're looking for the coming of the lord
[49:55] we look at the holy ghost following the
[49:57] last days
[49:58] we look at signs and wonders we watch
[50:00] what's taking place
[50:01] don't you see he goes what are you
[50:02] looking at that's exactly what god said
[50:05] would take place
[50:05] he said let faith grab it you see
[50:08] everything that's going on around us
[50:09] that's exactly what god said would take
[50:11] place
[50:12] let faith grab hold of it if the world
[50:15] is getting in their position
[50:17] shouldn't we also get in ours
[50:20] shouldn't we also be under a great
[50:22] expectation
[50:24] that god is about to do exactly what he
[50:27] said he would do
[50:29] he says watch elijah when he escaped
[50:31] notice now
[50:32] we look here in first kings 18 and 46
[50:35] said the hand of the lord was on elijah
[50:38] and he girded up his loins and he ran
[50:40] before ahab
[50:42] to the entrance of jezreel now ahab had
[50:45] a chariot he got on his chair
[50:46] and he ran down well before uh
[50:50] elijah cut off a mount carmel but we
[50:52] found that the spirit of the lord was so
[50:54] strong upon elijah's life
[50:55] that he girded himself and he ran before
[50:58] the horse
[50:59] and before the chariot of ahab and he
[51:01] began to run into the city get them
[51:03] get the rainbows ready for i hear the
[51:05] sound of abundance of rain what are you
[51:07] saying brother joe i'm hearing you
[51:09] tonight
[51:09] church if you just hear the sounds
[51:11] tonight get the rain barrels ready
[51:13] prepare for your miracle
[51:14] believe for the empire get ready to see
[51:16] god pour it out
[51:17] upon the church tonight
[51:21] i hear the sounds of dry bones
[51:25] rattling i hear the sound brother johnny
[51:29] send you in tissue and bones becoming
[51:32] back together in a mighty army being
[51:34] formed
[51:34] i hear the sound of those old those old
[51:37] chains that held you down
[51:39] falling to the ground i hear the chains
[51:41] of prodigals coming home
[51:43] i hear the chains i hear the bride
[51:45] speaking under the inspiration of the
[51:47] holy ghost
[51:48] i hear the sound of impossibilities
[51:50] fading into realities
[51:53] oh it'll sound tonight i heard the sound
[51:56] of people
[51:56] rising up in faith believing that you
[51:59] don't face an impossibility
[52:00] because all things are possible for them
[52:03] that believe
[52:07] but we find if we're not careful
[52:10] they'll try to explain the supernatural
[52:12] away from you
[52:14] they'll try to steal it away from you we
[52:17] find peter when he went to dorcas
[52:19] and he put everybody else out
[52:22] and he went in and prayed with her and
[52:23] he grabbed her by her hand and raised
[52:24] her up
[52:26] see unbelief was safe she was just in a
[52:30] coma
[52:32] and see when you explain the problem of
[52:33] god will say when you explain the
[52:35] supernatural out of the bible
[52:37] you're explaining away the very god that
[52:39] you worship
[52:41] when you explain the supernatural out of
[52:44] the bible
[52:47] you explain away the very god that you
[52:49] claim to worship
[52:53] and then the message of satan's eden
[52:56] for the brahman is referenced in satan
[52:57] he said now satan or he's
[53:00] he says he would exalt himself above the
[53:02] most high
[53:04] he would extend above the clouds and the
[53:06] stars and he would sit there like god
[53:08] and be above the most high and brother
[53:11] bam will say he
[53:12] has succeeded in carrying out his
[53:14] threats
[53:16] he has certainly had a marvelous success
[53:18] in carrying out his threats
[53:20] by what by the people letting him
[53:24] explain
[53:25] away in every age the value of the word
[53:27] to that age
[53:30] satan says i'm going to do this and i'm
[53:32] going to do this and i'm going to do
[53:33] this
[53:35] and preachers have allowed him to
[53:37] explain away the supernatural
[53:41] but there's preachers tonight that
[53:43] refuse to allow him
[53:44] to explain away the supernatural there's
[53:47] preachers in this message that don't
[53:48] believe in the movement of the spirit
[53:50] they don't believe in a prayer line they
[53:51] don't believe in an altar call they
[53:52] don't believe in tongues they don't
[53:53] believe in young people getting on the
[53:54] anointing and running around
[53:56] they make a a a folly about that or
[53:58] ridicule us
[53:59] and say these things they don't believe
[54:01] in the discernment of the spirit anymore
[54:03] they want to put all that on one man if
[54:06] you put all that on one man then you
[54:07] deny the word of god
[54:10] because job gave a promise that i will
[54:12] pour out my spirit
[54:14] and i believe today we're living in that
[54:16] time but the problem is that the people
[54:19] allow the enemy to explain away the
[54:21] power
[54:22] or the value of the word for that age
[54:26] miracles they say that there's days and
[54:28] miracles has passed god don't move like
[54:29] he did in the 40s and 50s
[54:31] that was only for brother branham and
[54:33] they make concessions in this concession
[54:34] in that concession
[54:35] but don't you ever church don't ever let
[54:38] anyone explain the value of this word
[54:40] away from you
[54:44] we need a god that's able to move
[54:48] we need a god that's not limited by your
[54:50] unbelief
[54:51] we need a god that's able to show up
[54:53] when you don't even want them to
[54:56] we need a god that will do a seating
[54:58] abundantly above all that you can even
[55:00] ask or think
[55:02] we need that god here tonight they want
[55:05] to explain and brother brown would say
[55:06] look we've got intellectual giants in
[55:08] the world today that can almost blame
[55:09] everything away
[55:10] you go talk to some some theologian he
[55:13] can explain it all away from you or some
[55:15] intellectual guy
[55:16] some infidel they can explain it all
[55:18] away from you they they can put it all
[55:19] together but if you ever get on the back
[55:22] side of that desert and meet god one
[55:23] time
[55:24] let me tell you a young person you can
[55:26] drift through life only so long you've
[55:28] got to have that encounter
[55:31] you can only play church for so long you
[55:33] can only be a good christian for so long
[55:37] but if you ever get back on the backside
[55:39] of that desert
[55:40] and meet him in that burning bush
[55:43] because it has
[55:44] exactly what you have made up you want
[55:47] victory over pornography
[55:48] get on the back side of the desert
[55:52] you want victory over complexes and
[55:53] family strains being passed down
[55:55] get on the back side of the desert look
[55:58] for a supernatural god
[56:00] look for god is able to break those
[56:02] family ties and break those family
[56:03] curses off your life
[56:05] look unto jesus the author and the
[56:08] finisher
[56:09] of your faith brother brown say where
[56:12] there's a supernatural god there's going
[56:14] to be supernatural things happening
[56:16] because he's supernatural
[56:20] see satan wants you to back up
[56:23] he don't want us to believe for the
[56:25] impossible
[56:27] he wants you to settle for a sofa
[56:30] religion
[56:33] that's what he wanted for moses you just
[56:34] go so far
[56:36] but i think god had a moses on the on
[56:39] the scene at that time says we're not
[56:40] going
[56:41] so far this is where we're going we're
[56:43] going all the way we're leaving
[56:45] and matter of fact moses we're not going
[56:46] to leave a child behind
[56:48] we're not going to leave our family
[56:49] behind we're not going to leave grandma
[56:51] behind we're not going to leave grandpa
[56:53] behind
[56:53] we're not going to leave a hoof behind i
[56:56] mean where's that kind of people tonight
[56:58] say we're leaving this world we're not
[57:00] going to leave our young people behind
[57:02] we're not going to leave a son behind
[57:04] we're not going to leave our daughters
[57:05] behind
[57:06] we're not going to leave the old people
[57:07] behind we're going all the way
[57:09] we're going to take that rapture because
[57:12] god's promised it for us
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:17] but satan wants you to just go so go so
[57:20] far
[57:21] you don't have to believe in healing
[57:22] just settle for medication
[57:26] we got more people on antidepressants
[57:28] today
[57:30] i talked to a young black guy yesterday
[57:31] about a tree job
[57:33] he said man i'm so i i'm on medication
[57:35] for anxiety
[57:37] and all this i said well there's a
[57:39] better physician out there for you than
[57:40] that
[57:41] he said where i said jesus
[57:44] i said man he'll take that anxiety away
[57:46] from me
[57:48] he goes you mean i said you don't have
[57:49] to live on medicine all your life
[57:53] no there's a great physician
[57:56] but see that's the lie of the enemy you
[57:57] have to live on medication
[58:00] you have to live with your pain you have
[58:03] to live with this
[58:04] or you have to cope with this satan
[58:07] don't want you to be delivered
[58:10] he wants you to cope with your enemy or
[58:12] cope with your demons you don't have to
[58:14] cope church
[58:15] we got a promise land in the word if
[58:17] they lay hands on the sick they
[58:19] shall recover and we look we've been
[58:22] we've been anointed and we've been given
[58:24] the authority to cast satan
[58:26] out i mean there's no reason that a
[58:28] child of god should sit bound in a

[58:33] present with an anointed ministry
[58:35] to do exactly what the word said has to

[1:05:21] of her hand and the vibration wouldn't
[1:05:23] stop
[1:05:24] and i started to pray for the girl again
[1:05:25] and it did not leave her
[1:05:28] he says then i looked at the girl and i
[1:05:29] said well that's strange i asked jesus
[1:05:32] again to heal her
[1:05:33] and it just held right on well there's
[1:05:36] something wrong
[1:05:38] i looked at her like that and i just
[1:05:39] looked at the girl she was probably
[1:05:40] about five foot two or three inches tall
[1:05:42] and i seen the girl
[1:05:43] right back across the stage that way it
[1:05:45] went right across the stage
[1:05:46] and i seen a little girl 14 years old
[1:05:49] standing there she
[1:05:50] had long flats hanging down her back
[1:05:52] little checkered ribbons and i said
[1:05:54] when you were 14 you were long plastic
[1:05:56] and she said yes sir
[1:05:59] i said when you was 14 years old you
[1:06:01] took the wrong road on a road that's
[1:06:03] wrong she's
[1:06:04] you had a baby by a man that was before
[1:06:05] you were married she said yes sir
[1:06:07] that's right i said and i said you
[1:06:10] married the man but you didn't love him
[1:06:12] that's right
[1:06:12] you left him that's right then you got
[1:06:15] with a religious cult and they had to me
[1:06:17] they had you marry another man that's
[1:06:18] right you didn't love him and you left
[1:06:20] him that's right
[1:06:21] you're married to another man that's it
[1:06:24] and this
[1:06:25] she goes and he said you was once a
[1:06:27] christian and you've gone back and you
[1:06:29] backslidden on god she said that's right
[1:06:30] and she staggered like that
[1:06:32] and was going to fall back to the floor
[1:06:34] and when she did she screamed and god
[1:06:36] forgave her
[1:06:37] and gave her hearing back to her and she
[1:06:38] received the baptism the holy ghost
[1:06:39] standing on a platform like that
[1:06:41] standing there just all at once
[1:06:45] notice then he turns back to the patient
[1:06:47] that was in the wheelchair or the
[1:06:50] and he says i seen the little girl
[1:06:52] sitting in the chair just as plain as
[1:06:54] i'm looking at the gentleman here
[1:06:55] rise up out of the chair only she was
[1:06:57] dressed different than she was sitting
[1:06:59] here and she went walking down through
[1:07:01] the aisle and it looked like
[1:07:02] she was just waving her hands and saying
[1:07:04] thank god thank god
[1:07:06] and i washed it till it faded out and i
[1:07:08] looked at the little girl and i said
[1:07:09] sister jesus the son of god has heard
[1:07:12] your prayers and he's healed you
[1:07:14] stand on your feet and that girl hadn't
[1:07:17] walked since she was eight years old
[1:07:19] and up she got out of the wheelchair and
[1:07:21] she and there she stood
[1:07:25] and there she went through the building
[1:07:27] glorifying god
[1:07:29] and they moved the wheelchair back and
[1:07:30] the glory of god swept over the building
[1:07:33] everywhere
[1:07:33] and the people began to rise and throw
[1:07:35] their crutches
[1:07:37] and their canes and walking he said what
[1:07:39] is it this is the point i want to make
[1:07:41] what is it
[1:07:42] he says that doesn't heal the people to
[1:07:44] tell you what's wrong with you
[1:07:47] but here's what it does friends it
[1:07:49] brings the realization of the
[1:07:51] supernatural god
[1:07:52] working in our midst oh
[1:07:56] one revelation or one discernment after
[1:07:58] the next discernment one supernatural
[1:08:00] divine intervention after the next
[1:08:02] it doesn't heal you to tell you what's
[1:08:04] wrong with you but what it does to it
[1:08:06] brings a realization
[1:08:07] that there is a supernatural god working
[1:08:10] in our myth
[1:08:11] so why do we tell you service after
[1:08:13] service that there is a god that can
[1:08:15] defeat cancer
[1:08:16] there is a god that can defeat brain
[1:08:17] fleas there is a god that can restore
[1:08:19] hair on a little girl's head
[1:08:21] is to bring the realization that a
[1:08:23] supernatural god
[1:08:24] is visited even like tabernacle and if
[1:08:27] he can do it for them
[1:08:28] he can do it for you he can meet your
[1:08:30] need tonight
[1:08:31] if you can believe if you'll put your
[1:08:33] eyes back on jesus
[1:08:35] oh it's the realization that god is
[1:08:38] supernatural
[1:08:39] and he wants his people to believe in
[1:08:41] the supernatural
[1:08:46] he's not a dead god he's a living god
[1:08:52] brother ron he's a living god and what
[1:08:55] he did for sister atlanta
[1:08:57] prepare for your miracle sister erica
[1:09:00] prepare i hear the sound of abundance
[1:09:04] of rain i hear the sound
[1:09:09] of the enemies chains falling
[1:09:13] but see church we gotta say like mary
[1:09:17] be it unto me you may not be able to
[1:09:20] figure it all out
[1:09:22] but that doesn't matter be it unto me
[1:09:25] and once you recognize the supernatural
[1:09:28] god
[1:09:31] and that he cares for you
[1:09:34] and that you're his child there's not
[1:09:37] enough
[1:09:37] devils in hell can make you back up off
[1:09:41] the promise
[1:09:43] but you got to realize you don't belong
[1:09:46] to the enemy
[1:09:48] you never had you never will you belong
[1:09:50] to god
[1:09:51] and because who you are and your
[1:09:54] position
[1:09:55] in the body there ain't a devil in hell
[1:09:57] it should torment you
[1:09:58] we should be tormenting satan
[1:10:02] think about if we flip the script on him
[1:10:04] tonight
[1:10:05] some of you coming here dragging in
[1:10:07] because you've been tormented all week
[1:10:09] and we're only at hump day
[1:10:12] come on how many is that true don't
[1:10:15] raise your hands
[1:10:16] everybody be raising their hands
[1:10:17] standing up having a rejoicing fit
[1:10:19] but no we come sometimes on a wednesday
[1:10:21] i came dragging and i told brother tim
[1:10:22] said it's been a rough day at the office
[1:10:25] and we have those days but what if we
[1:10:27] come with an expectation
[1:10:30] on the 6th of january 2021
[1:10:34] that i'm going to meet god not that i'm
[1:10:36] going to meet god but god is going to
[1:10:38] meet me
[1:10:40] this is my service this is my need
[1:10:44] some of you been praying for your
[1:10:45] children for a long time this is my
[1:10:47] service
[1:10:48] i'm taking my eyes off the condition i'm
[1:10:50] taking my eyes off of what i've been
[1:10:52] looking at
[1:10:53] i'm taking my eyes off of them going
[1:10:54] further and further and further in their
[1:10:56] life getting more wasted and more sorry
[1:10:58] and more
[1:10:59] degraded the whole time i'm going to put
[1:11:00] my eyes back on the promise god i gave
[1:11:02] them to you on the cradle roll
[1:11:04] now i'm asking that you move right now
[1:11:06] here tonight
[1:11:08] there's not enough devils in hell can
[1:11:11] defeat you and get you to back up once
[1:11:13] you recognize a supernatural god
[1:11:16] is for you tonight we could go on and on
[1:11:19] but let me just skip down and start
[1:11:21] bringing this to a close
[1:11:24] notice
[1:11:27] when lathros was in the grave
[1:11:31] martha she met jesus she didn't berate
[1:11:34] him for not showing up
[1:11:36] on time she went out to him and fell
[1:11:39] down and said even now lord
[1:11:41] whatever you ask god though my brother's
[1:11:44] dead
[1:11:45] though his body's embalmed though he's
[1:11:47] in a tomb
[1:11:48] and though he stinketh whatever you ask
[1:11:51] god right now god is able
[1:11:55] she took her eyes off the problem she
[1:11:58] took her eyes off the tune
[1:12:00] she took her eyes off the situation
[1:12:06] because she recognized she was in the
[1:12:07] presence of the only one
[1:12:10] that could speak life so no matter how
[1:12:14] far that loved one of yours has gone
[1:12:18] they're never too far gone by what the
[1:12:19] voice of god can't call them back
[1:12:22] lathers come forth
[1:12:26] notice a man that had been dead four
[1:12:27] days you know martha may have thought
[1:12:29] well he's finally going to come and
[1:12:30] preach his funeral he didn't have no
[1:12:32] expectations of preaching a funeral
[1:12:34] he said your brother's going to rise
[1:12:36] because i am the resurrection
[1:12:38] and the life and if we can have that
[1:12:40] same faith for our loved ones
[1:12:42] even now lord even tonight lord
[1:12:46] whatever you ask god god to do it
[1:12:51] so the impossibilities church
[1:12:54] and possibilities are made real when we
[1:12:56] take god at his word
[1:12:59] and possibilities fade out when we put
[1:13:02] our focus on god i preach
[1:13:04] in 2020 the first service don't lose
[1:13:06] your vision
[1:13:08] thinking 2020 was going to be a great
[1:13:10] year i think we all lost our vision
[1:13:12] in regards to what 2020 was worth but we
[1:13:14] never lost our vision of jesus
[1:13:17] and i come back tonight once again the
[1:13:20] first of the years they put your eyes
[1:13:21] back on him
[1:13:23] take your eyes off all the chaos around
[1:13:25] us but brandon would say it like this he
[1:13:28] said god
[1:13:28] wants you to do the miraculous
[1:13:32] i don't feel like it brother joe that's
[1:13:34] beside the point
[1:13:36] he wants you to do it anyway well it's
[1:13:37] not my nature
[1:13:39] well you can either change your nature
[1:13:40] and take his nature
[1:13:42] or what god wants you to do the
[1:13:45] miraculous
[1:13:46] he wants you to believe the miraculous
[1:13:49] and by accepting it by faith you prove
[1:13:51] what you believe
[1:13:53] he is god wants you to take his word for
[1:13:57] it he speaks it
[1:13:58] and god has has said it all heavens and
[1:14:01] earth will pass away
[1:14:02] but my word will not pass away
[1:14:06] as i close on these last two quotes or
[1:14:08] last two stories here
[1:14:10] we all are familiar with the story of
[1:14:11] the man who had a son who was dying with
[1:14:13] black
[1:14:14] diphtheria the brotherhood said the
[1:14:16] young man was unconscious for two days
[1:14:18] and
[1:14:18] he went round and round with the doctor
[1:14:20] before the doctor finally allowed him to
[1:14:21] dress them up like a
[1:14:23] you know kind of like they do today you
[1:14:24] got to put on all this ppe protect your
[1:14:26] personal protective equipment to go into
[1:14:28] the room to see a covered patient
[1:14:30] i mean you look like you come out of a
[1:14:32] sci-fi movie
[1:14:34] and so we find the same story here but
[1:14:36] we get down and brother brown said the
[1:14:38] nurse
[1:14:39] she she kind of made a comment you know
[1:14:41] how some nurses are
[1:14:44] not tori of course or david or some of
[1:14:46] the nurses we have here but
[1:14:47] she said you know your son is dying
[1:14:51] you know you get someone a little smart
[1:14:52] that little nurse don't have no
[1:14:54] conscience of god you know he's dying
[1:14:58] probably said yeah she did that for my
[1:15:00] per my benefit
[1:15:02] he said well he may be but we believe a
[1:15:05] god that heals
[1:15:07] you know it's kind of that reminds me
[1:15:09] and i put myself in this scene because
[1:15:10] when i went to the doctor when sister
[1:15:12] karen's at the er
[1:15:13] and he showed me her scan he said she
[1:15:15] can live five minutes or five more years
[1:15:17] but she won't have a quality of life
[1:15:18] and something just flew out of me right
[1:15:20] i said we're going to believe god's
[1:15:21] going to do the impossible then
[1:15:25] and i ask you church did he
[1:15:28] did he is he still doing it tonight
[1:15:32] every day she gets stronger better her
[1:15:35] hair is growing back longer
[1:15:36] every day god's still doing the
[1:15:38] supernatural
[1:15:40] so we find brother brown says now i just
[1:15:41] kind of turned she just kind of turned
[1:15:43] her little painted lips up looked
[1:15:44] sideways
[1:15:45] i said let us pray and uh and brother
[1:15:47] brown his prayer is the lord
[1:15:50] who made heavens on earth you said
[1:15:51] whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:15:53] pray
[1:15:53] believe that you receive them and it is
[1:15:56] also written if you shall say to this
[1:15:58] mountain be thou removed and
[1:16:00] not doubt in your heart but believe that
[1:16:02] what you say
[1:16:03] shall come to pass you shall have
[1:16:05] whatsoever you say
[1:16:06] that is your word and that's what we're
[1:16:08] doing lord and i say i lay hands upon
[1:16:11] this boy
[1:16:12] and i condemn that death in the name of
[1:16:14] jesus christ
[1:16:16] raised up the whole father raised up he
[1:16:17] wiped his tears
[1:16:19] from underneath his glasses and he took
[1:16:21] the mother by his arms and he said
[1:16:22] mother just think in the glorious
[1:16:24] he's going to live now notice the father
[1:16:27] didn't put his attention in his eyes on
[1:16:29] his son who was dying
[1:16:31] but he put his attention on the promise
[1:16:35] the boy's just as far gone just barely
[1:16:37] breathing
[1:16:38] and the wife said oh and that wonderful
[1:16:40] fred isn't it wonderful
[1:16:42] he's gonna live now notice their
[1:16:44] confession was in harmony with one
[1:16:46] another
[1:16:47] our son is going to live he's going to
[1:16:48] make it through this and that little
[1:16:50] nurse
[1:16:51] the little nurse just looked up she
[1:16:52] didn't know what it was all about she
[1:16:54] said
[1:16:54] you do understand that the best doctors
[1:16:56] we got in this country has said
[1:16:58] that that child will be dead within the
[1:17:00] next five hours that's just like the
[1:17:01] devil in it
[1:17:03] i want to come rain on your parade but
[1:17:05] devil
[1:17:06] i hear the sound of abundance
[1:17:09] of rain i said i hear the sound
[1:17:12] of abundance of rain she said that
[1:17:15] cardiogram she said it went all the way
[1:17:17] down and
[1:17:18] never in medical history when it ever
[1:17:20] dropped does it ever come back again
[1:17:23] that old father walked over there put
[1:17:24] his arms around that little nurse
[1:17:26] he said honey i feel sorry for you
[1:17:29] that's my kind of man i feel sorry for
[1:17:31] you you're looking at this
[1:17:32] chart this machine because that's all
[1:17:34] you're trained to look at
[1:17:36] she's and he said yeah you're looking at
[1:17:38] the machine but i'm looking at a divine
[1:17:41] promise and he says and that's what god
[1:17:43] made and the prophet god said and it
[1:17:44] depends on what you're looking at
[1:17:46] i'm gonna tell you tonight church nurses
[1:17:48] and doctors they're trained to look at
[1:17:51] mris and cts and blood pressures and cat
[1:17:54] scans and all those things
[1:17:55] but the bride of christ she is trained
[1:17:57] to look at the supernatural
[1:17:58] she is trained to expect god to move in
[1:18:01] the service
[1:18:01] she's been trained she's got over 40
[1:18:04] years
[1:18:05] in the ministry of the supernatural
[1:18:07] seeing the movement of the spirit
[1:18:09] recognizing the small hand of god
[1:18:12] when it shows up oh yeah
[1:18:15] it's their business to understand
[1:18:18] medical science
[1:18:19] it's our business to keep our focus on
[1:18:22] the promised word
[1:18:24] it's our responsibility to look to the
[1:18:27] word of god and believe
[1:18:28] for the impossible last quote i promise
[1:18:33] there in south africa reason there was a
[1:18:35] man who never had a pair of shoes on his
[1:18:38] feet he was born to
[1:18:40] missionary parents and he had the
[1:18:42] foreign feet club feet that's where his
[1:18:44] feet were

[1:19:35] his under his arm
[1:19:36] and he came clubbing through that and
[1:19:38] clubbing through that but he had faith
[1:19:40] that the god he served was gonna do
[1:19:42] something for him
[1:19:43] and he said i saw the crippled healed i
[1:19:45] saw the blind eyes being open

[1:22:43] and he may get scars on brother philip
[1:22:47] but there's a realization he won't turn
[1:22:49] me down

[1:22:54] impossible

[1:23:18] please he's here
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:24] as i was in arizona there was a prayer
[1:23:26] line we had a prayer line i began to
[1:23:28] pray for different ones and
[1:23:29] brother aaron garrett's sister came up
[1:23:31] for his sister-in-law
[1:23:34] in the prayer line waiting for her turn
[1:23:35] to be prayed for and she said she felt
[1:23:37] something just keep coming up inside of
[1:23:38] brushing up against her
[1:23:40] and she looked to think somebody's just
[1:23:41] bumping against her
[1:23:43] but the spirit of god was just moving
[1:23:44] back and forth down that aisle
[1:23:47] moving back and forth down that aisle
[1:23:51] moving upon different hearts upon
[1:23:54] different lives
[1:23:56] for that dougal 40 years living with
[1:23:59] pain
[1:24:00] delivered brother aaron's daughter eight
[1:24:03] years dealing with gluten issues
[1:24:05] delivered his sister-in-law i can't he
[1:24:08] actually just text me the other day and
[1:24:09] telling me exactly what the lord did for
[1:24:11] her
[1:24:11] it's countless church and that's not to
[1:24:14] brag on brother joe that had nothing to
[1:24:15] do with brother joe
[1:24:16] just being a willing vessel to be used
[1:24:18] of god but it's the people's faith
[1:24:20] to operate the gift and the prophet of
[1:24:23] god said if you can get the people to
[1:24:24] believe you
[1:24:26] nothing will stand before their prayer
[1:24:29] not even cancer
[1:24:32] so whatever your need is tonight we
[1:24:33] serve a living
[1:24:35] god and nothing is impossible
[1:24:40] nothing is impossible
[1:24:43] that young man looked at his crippled
[1:24:45] feet
[1:24:48] you know he probably got tired of
[1:24:49] looking down seeing his deformed feet
[1:24:51] and no doubt the enemy probably said you
[1:24:53] know what you'll never walk
[1:24:54] look at you you'll never walk straight
[1:24:57] he took his eyes off his feet
[1:25:00] and he saw the realization of the
[1:25:02] supernatural
[1:25:03] he said if god can do that for that one
[1:25:06] if he can do it for that one
[1:25:07] if he can do it for that one oh he's not
[1:25:10] going to turn me down
[1:25:13] and he ran and ran and ran
[1:25:16] and ran
[1:25:20] i wonder if we can let god move here
[1:25:21] tonight
[1:25:24] what could he do for you
[1:25:27] what could he do for you tonight
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:32] all things are possible if you can
[1:25:35] believe let us just bow our heads for a
[1:25:36] brief minute
[1:25:42] father we thank you lord tonight and
[1:25:44] lord i know
[1:25:45] many times as i preach lord i get beyond
[1:25:48] myself or just the excitement and the
[1:25:50] emotion of your word i thank you lord
[1:25:53] and i just learned to
[1:25:55] operate in the gift you've given and i
[1:25:56] just trust tonight father
[1:25:59] trust tonight in your supernatural
[1:26:00] element lord that you're still a god
[1:26:03] who was able to discern and move and
[1:26:05] elevate faith
[1:26:06] and bring the people into the realm of
[1:26:08] the supernatural that we can realize
[1:26:10] that
[1:26:12] that there's a living god in our midst
[1:26:14] he's not a god of history
[1:26:16] but what he'd done in the past he's he
[1:26:18] can do the same today
[1:26:21] we're asking lord as you open up blinded
[1:26:23] eyes do that again tonight
[1:26:24] you he'll feet do that again
[1:26:26] tonight you saved from cancer and
[1:26:29] and cursed cancer and drove it out of a
[1:26:32] sister atlanta's body we ask that you'll
[1:26:33] do that
[1:26:34] again tonight lord you see brother ron
[1:26:37] he's in a great need father
[1:26:39] fighting this demon of cancer for many
[1:26:40] months now
[1:26:42] but god we're asking the same god that
[1:26:44] moved on behalf of sister atlanta
[1:26:47] we ask that you'd move on behalf of
[1:26:48] brother ron tonight
[1:26:50] sister erica tonight lord says just
[1:26:52] cynthia tonight father
[1:26:54] may you move in the power of your word
[1:26:56] father and may their faith be elevated
[1:26:59] and if god can do that for her he won't
[1:27:02] turn them down
[1:27:04] so lord we're just asking and we're not
[1:27:07] only asking but we're believing father
[1:27:10] because you commissioned us to believe
[1:27:12] and believers stand on the word of god
[1:27:14] heavens and earth will pass away
[1:27:16] but your word never fail so as we stand
[1:27:20] here tonight at the closing of the
[1:27:21] service
[1:27:25] father many many may be here tonight
[1:27:27] sickness may have ravaged their body but
[1:27:29] the word would tell us
[1:27:31] there's a commission that we can lay
[1:27:32] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:27:36] lord if there's a tormenting spirit may
[1:27:38] be tormenting
[1:27:39] the believer there's a commission to the
[1:27:41] body of christ tonight that
[1:27:44] we can cast that demon away father we
[1:27:47] don't have to live in torment we don't
[1:27:48] have to live in despair and anxiety and
[1:27:50] worry and fear
[1:27:51] we're your children lord
[1:27:55] and we're going to look to the
[1:27:56] impossible tonight
[1:27:58] we're going to look beyond the
[1:27:59] impossible and we're going to look to a
[1:28:01] god
[1:28:02] that's able to do exceeding abundantly
[1:28:05] above all that we can ask or think
[1:28:07] father i pray that the word now will
[1:28:09] just settle in the heart of the believer
[1:28:10] lord
[1:28:12] you'll anchor their faith father in the
[1:28:14] rock of ages
[1:28:18] god as we face 2021 may we face it with
[1:28:20] a
[1:28:22] greater determination lord realizing
[1:28:25] that we've been highly favored
[1:28:28] and it's time for us to be more sincere
[1:28:30] and a greater expectation
[1:28:32] to witness to move another spirit lord
[1:28:35] my hands are raised tonight father to
[1:28:38] make that decree to you tonight
[1:28:41] many times we let things get in the way
[1:28:42] father
[1:28:44] maybe not sinful things but pleasures of
[1:28:47] this life lord and
[1:28:48] i ask that lord we have a greater
[1:28:50] commitment tonight to you
[1:28:52] to your word let our eyes be able to see
[1:28:56] that still
[1:28:56] small or hear that still small voice in
[1:29:00] our eyes see that small
[1:29:01] cloud rise up from the surface
[1:29:05] so you begin to move on this heart and
[1:29:07] that heart and recognize
[1:29:08] that god is here so we just commit this
[1:29:12] service to you now lord
[1:29:14] i just pray your blessings be upon each
[1:29:16] and every one of us father we love you
