[13:07] amen
[13:08] amen all glory and honor and praise
[13:10] given days
[13:12] [Music]
[13:13] we have a couple of requests and
[13:17] also a little testimony
[13:20] my daughter Nina sent
[13:22] she had injured her finger
[13:25] and had not been able to put a ring on
[13:27] her for some time now
[13:28] and she said I always wanted to wear my
[13:31] wedding ring on the right finger and I
[13:32] kept asking the Lord to heal it and he
[13:35] goes I kept trying it was too swollen
[13:38] there's been some time now she goes but
[13:40] the other day I put it in and it slipped
[13:42] right in and she goes I'm just so happy
[13:43] that the Lord answers
[13:46] you know sometimes we're we're looking
[13:48] for something big but they're the simple
[13:50] things that God does for us daily and
[13:52] appreciate that and and a prayer request
[13:56] um
[13:57] sister Martha is asking for her dad and
[14:01] and her husband there and his wife I'm
[14:04] sorry I got that get that right
[14:07] um they've been possibilities of
[14:09] tornadoes around where they're at and
[14:11] just protection and keeping them sister
[14:14] Angela mentioned in Alberta all the
[14:17] fires that they're having and it's
[14:18] affecting some of the Believers
[14:21] and then in Israel we see what Israel is
[14:24] going in
[14:24] [Music]
[14:26] it's hard to understand this but the
[14:28] safest place to be is in Israel because
[14:31] they have a God that watches over them
[14:33] and not a wonderful and he watches over
[14:35] the same way but still our heart reaches
[14:38] out to our brothers and sisters so if
[14:39] you'll stand with me
[14:42] he is more than able to watch over to
[14:45] keep brother Jeremy if you would come
[14:48] and open in prayer and remember these
[14:50] requests and if you have a need say Lord
[14:53] remember me
[14:55] I've been going through some
[14:57] things in my body but Lord is still
[14:59] mindful of that
[15:01] I've been doing a little bit better
[15:02] maybe
[15:03] I believe the lord gave us just reading
[15:06] something about some of the
[15:08] natural vitamins I've been taking I
[15:11] might have been taking too many of some
[15:13] and that had did some of the side
[15:15] effects so I believe the Lord watches
[15:17] over us and takes care of us
[15:20] [Music]
[15:24] let's pray
[15:26] gracious Heavenly Father we just counted
[15:29] another honor and privilege to come be
[15:32] with your elect
[15:33] and learn about your word Lord draws
[15:37] closer tonight bless the musicians plus
[15:40] the speaker that brings the word
[15:43] bless the congregation Lord
[15:45] Lord we need you
[15:48] draw us closer to you
[15:51] accept our praise
[15:54] and our sacrifice for coming
[15:56] midweek service Lord
[15:59] it's hard but we
[16:01] [Music]
[16:04] then thank you Lord for giving us
[16:07] strength
[16:08] be around others
[16:10] and your precious name
[16:14] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[16:19] [Music]

[16:23] deal with this oh somebody

[22:25] foreign
[22:29] [Music]
[22:41] if you want to if
[22:44] it's good to know the Lord isn't it
[22:48] First Timothy
[22:52] um chapter
[22:53] you know
[22:55] I believe it's chapter one I didn't put
[22:57] the chapter down let's maybe open our
[22:59] Bibles and look that up
[23:02] First Timothy
[23:04] [Music]
[23:09] I I was telling brother Dan I was just
[23:12] looking at it
[23:13] where Paul is
[23:16] saying here
[23:18] [Music]
[23:21] and I didn't write the verse down so the
[23:23] brothers are
[23:26] verses 12 to 17 so let's find that real
[23:30] quick here
[23:32] [Music]
[23:39] it's where Paul says Ah he says now unto
[23:44] the king eternal
[23:45] [Music]
[23:47] if you could find that here I didn't
[23:49] write the
[23:51] what chapter
[23:54] First Timothy one
[23:56] okay
[23:58] yeah
[24:00] and I just began to read that and I
[24:03] didn't realize that what Paul was
[24:05] speaking about is what brother Dan would
[24:07] be speaking of tonight
[24:09] this is Paul saying I thank
[24:11] Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled
[24:13] me for that he counted me faithful
[24:16] putting me into the ministry
[24:18] who was before a blasphemer and a
[24:21] persecutor an injurious
[24:23] but I obtained Mercy because I did it
[24:25] ignorantly and in unbelief and the grace
[24:29] of our Lord was exceeding abundant with
[24:31] faith and love which is in Christ Jesus
[24:34] this is a faithful sane and worthy of
[24:37] all acceptation that Christ Jesus came
[24:39] into the world to save Sinners who I am
[24:42] chief
[24:43] I wonder how many times Paul went that
[24:46] through his mind how could I have
[24:47] persecuted God
[24:50] he had to live with that but he realized
[24:52] that God's forgiveness how be it for
[24:55] this cause I obtain Mercy that in me
[24:57] first Jesus Christ might show forth all
[25:00] long-suffering for a pattern to them
[25:02] that should Hereafter believe on him to
[25:05] life Everlasting now unto the king
[25:08] Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise
[25:11] God be honor and Glory forever and ever
[25:15] amen I was sharing it with brother Dan
[25:18] and he goes well that's ax Paul I said
[25:20] yeah you're right just hadn't thought of
[25:23] it just share a little testimony and
[25:25] work yesterday there's a young man I've
[25:29] mentioned in Indian young man well he's
[25:31] older than I thought he was he just told
[25:33] me he's in his 40s he looks like in his
[25:34] he's in his 20s
[25:36] and I hadn't seen him for a while and we
[25:37] got into the same house we're both
[25:39] working so we got to talking with him a
[25:42] little bit
[25:43] and we began to talk about forgiveness
[25:45] and and accepting forgiveness
[25:48] and that was my thought to him is you
[25:52] know you have to accept it and there's I
[25:55] told him there's only one sin in the
[25:57] scripture that the Bible says there's no
[25:58] forgiveness to
[26:00] and that is if you blaspheme God
[26:03] I said you say he's not God
[26:05] I said but everything else is forgivable
[26:08] so we got to talking to a little bit
[26:10] about then I could see it was hurting
[26:11] because he was making comments but I'd
[26:13] fail the Lord I said we all fail him no
[26:16] it's not as a righteous one
[26:18] and it came to mind where
[26:20] the man that had run from the battle
[26:24] and he his best friend had gone to
[26:26] President Lincoln and asked for pardon
[26:29] for him and Lincoln just wrote it on a
[26:32] piece of paper and said this pardon this
[26:34] man
[26:35] and when his friend took it to him he
[26:37] said you're you're fooling me it always
[26:39] says this would be an official
[26:41] stationary would be it would be said by
[26:43] some dignitary it would be
[26:46] so he the man lost his life
[26:49] and then it was taken to court and the
[26:51] Court ruled a pardon is not a pardon
[26:53] unless it's accepted as a part
[26:57] and each one of us have got to believe
[26:59] that Lord you have forgiven me I can
[27:02] come into your presence
[27:04] and I just it made my heart glad and
[27:06] when he when he we got ready to leave I
[27:09] had to leave the job site he came over
[27:11] and he gave me a big hug and he said I
[27:13] just so needed that today
[27:15] and I said Lord you know we hadn't seen
[27:18] each other so I go from there to the
[27:19] next house down the road a little ways
[27:22] and I walk in and there's somebody in
[27:24] the that I don't recognize and he's
[27:26] taking some of the doors from our
[27:27] cabinets
[27:28] so I question him
[27:30] and he said well they're broken they're
[27:31] no good I said I know but why are you
[27:33] taking them I got to order them again I
[27:34] said well who are you because I have no
[27:37] idea who this guy is
[27:39] and he uh he says I I work for this
[27:41] company and I said well this is not your
[27:43] house your houses are across the street
[27:45] where two different companies working he
[27:46] said no you guys work for us
[27:49] I'm looking I said I've never seen you
[27:51] in my life you're a about a 20 year old
[27:53] kid that was my thought who are you
[27:56] so we got to talking and he walks out
[27:58] with the parts but he told me of another
[28:00] house so I go down to the other house
[28:02] and he's now taking Parts out of that
[28:03] house too
[28:04] and my first thought this guy's trying
[28:06] to steal stuff
[28:07] but I see his van his van is for the
[28:10] company that does cabinets
[28:12] but he picked up so sorry so I reached
[28:14] over and I said these are not yours
[28:15] don't take them and he got right into my
[28:18] face and said don't you ever touch
[28:19] anything or try to pull anything out of
[28:20] my hand got into my face right here and
[28:23] I walked out after then I said a little
[28:24] bit a few minutes ago I was testifying
[28:26] about the grace of God and over here I
[28:27] wanted to hit that guy
[28:29] and I had to say Lord help me he watches
[28:33] over us all the time you know and I
[28:35] appreciate God just teaching us lessons
[28:37] every day you know
[28:40] and sister Shirley I'm glad you can
[28:42] smile
[28:43] brother Jonathan said the sister that
[28:45] smiles all the time I said sister
[28:47] Shirley always smiling appreciate that
[28:50] but life is just beautiful you no issues
[28:53] no problems right so you can smile no
[28:55] you're like the rest of us but you love
[28:56] the Lord how many loves the Lord Jesus
[28:58] today he's good to all of us isn't he
[29:00] amen
[29:01] it's so good to know that I told Brother
[29:05] Dan for what happened on you know the
[29:07] robbers were there in the middle of his
[29:09] sermon
[29:10] when he stopped and as I said brother
[29:12] Dan my stomach turned as hard as yours
[29:14] when I was watching
[29:16] I said how could that happen
[29:18] but God is good he took control of the
[29:20] service and he does that for his
[29:21] children
[29:23] so as brother Dan prepares to come out
[29:25] here and sing a couple more songs
[29:28] you love him amen I'm amazed that he
[29:32] loves me

[32:41] that he was going to read that scripture
[32:43] in first Timothy
[32:44] and we were back there and the scripture
[32:47] he read was actually a uh Paul
[32:50] testifying of Acts chapter 9.
[32:54] where he was struck down on the road to
[32:57] Damascus and and everything everything
[32:59] changed
[33:01] I am

[34:09] for them
[34:11] um Jeremy and Angela God bless you
[34:15] um so yeah we'll be
[34:17] we'll be doing that on Friday night and
[34:20] that starts I believe we put on there at
[34:22] six o'clock
[34:23] so everybody's welcome
[34:25] um
[34:27] Paul
[34:28] on the road
[34:30] to Damascus
[34:32] he was he was struck down on this road
[34:34] he was going to destroy the new converts
[34:37] to keep this new ministry this new way
[34:41] to keep it isolated in this city of
[34:45] Jerusalem and it was starting to to
[34:47] spread out and a light Shone on Paul the
[34:51] light that Paul said was brighter than
[34:52] the sun blinded him he fell on his back
[34:57] blind and then the Lord Jesus spoke to
[35:00] him
[35:01] and he after the Lord had spoke to him
[35:04] and gave him his commission he stayed in
[35:06] Damascus he stayed blind there for three
[35:08] days brother Cedric God bless you I just
[35:11] saw you back there it's good to have you
[35:12] my brother
[35:14] um didn't he eat or drink for three days
[35:17] then a brother named ananias comes to
[35:21] him ananias sees the vision about going
[35:23] to this Saul of Tarsus and praying for
[35:26] him so ananias comes he prays for him
[35:30] Saul is healed of his blindness and then
[35:32] ananias baptizes him then he has a meal
[35:36] with the disciples and then we will
[35:39] start here in Acts chapter 9 verse 19
[35:43] and let's read it
[35:46] says this
[35:47] and when he had received meat
[35:50] he was strengthened
[35:51] then Saul was certain days with the
[35:54] disciples which were at Damascus and
[35:57] straightway he preached Christ in the
[36:00] synagogues
[36:01] that he is the son of God
[36:05] very important right away
[36:08] look at Paul's Ministry back then Saul
[36:11] he hadn't changed his name yet Saul's
[36:14] Ministry back then look at what he's
[36:15] preaching he preaches Christ and it may
[36:19] seem simple
[36:21] just just to preach this Jesus but it
[36:23] wasn't simple we uh we had a prophet
[36:26] teach us that Christ is the mystery of
[36:30] God revealed he is everything and I can
[36:34] imagine this Saul preaching Jesus Christ
[36:37] from Genesis all the way to the end of
[36:40] Malachi that's all he had to choose from
[36:43] right there and I could see that he was
[36:45] just probably going through each
[36:47] scripture and and each book and bringing
[36:51] him out there
[36:54] but all that heard him were amazed and
[36:56] said is not this he that destroyed them
[36:59] which called on his name in Jerusalem
[37:01] and came hither for that intent that he
[37:04] might bring them bound into the chief
[37:06] priests
[37:07] but Saul increased the more in strength
[37:10] and confounded the Jews which dwelt at
[37:13] Damascus proving that this is the very
[37:16] Christ
[37:19] now
[37:20] this next verse
[37:22] I kind of rushed through the last one
[37:24] and we have time today tonight
[37:27] verse number 23 and after that many days
[37:31] were fulfilled
[37:33] after that many days were fulfilled the
[37:35] Jews took counsel to kill him now after
[37:39] studying this
[37:41] over the over the past few days and as
[37:43] much as I've studied the book of Acts
[37:45] there is a time when Paul
[37:49] he he refers back in the book of
[37:52] Galatians he refers back he said that I
[37:55] went to Arabia for three years
[37:59] now I believe
[38:01] and I I think I'm right
[38:04] this is that time that Paul actually
[38:08] left
[38:09] and he left for three years here let's
[38:12] uh turn to Galatians chapter one and I
[38:16] want to tell you what I'm referring to
[38:17] here
[38:18] verse 11.
[38:21] now you know who the author of Galatians
[38:23] is
[38:25] can you guess
[38:27] Paul
[38:28] but I certify you Brethren that the
[38:32] gospel which was preached of me is not
[38:35] after man
[38:37] for I neither received it of man neither
[38:40] was I taught it but by the revelation of
[38:43] Jesus Christ now this was important to
[38:47] Paul
[38:48] that he gets this across he's saying hey
[38:50] I didn't learn this in the synagogues I
[38:53] didn't even learn this from the
[38:54] disciples I learned this from Jesus
[38:59] Christ himself very important to Paul
[39:02] that he's he's saying that hey I got
[39:04] this not from somebody else but I got it
[39:07] straight from the source
[39:09] which is Jesus Christ
[39:12] for ye have heard of my conversation
[39:15] in time past in the Jews religion how
[39:18] that beyond measure I persecuted the
[39:20] Church of God and wasted it again
[39:22] brother Aaron just like in first Timothy
[39:24] chapter 1 where he was referring to Acts
[39:27] chapter 9 here in Galatians he's
[39:29] referring to Acts chapter 9.
[39:33] and it profited in the Jews religion
[39:35] above many my equals in my own Nation
[39:38] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[39:41] traditions of my fathers but when it
[39:43] pleased God who separated me from my
[39:46] mother's womb and called me by his grace
[39:49] to reveal his son in me that I might
[39:52] preach him among the Heathen you know
[39:54] who the Heathen is we've established
[39:56] that right anybody right amen anybody
[39:59] that's not you
[40:01] immediately I conferred not with flesh
[40:06] and blood
[40:08] I didn't go ask my pastor
[40:10] I didn't go ask my Rabbi I didn't go ask
[40:13] the high priest I didn't confer was FL
[40:16] with flesh and blood neither when I up
[40:18] to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles
[40:20] before me I didn't go to James and John
[40:23] and all of them that walked with Jesus
[40:25] but I went into Arabia and returned
[40:30] again unto Damascus
[40:32] then after three years
[40:35] I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and
[40:37] Abode with him 15 days but other of the
[40:41] Apostles saw I nun save James the Lord's
[40:44] brother
[40:45] so there's a time about three years
[40:47] here when Saul of Tarsus studied the
[40:50] scriptures and prayed researched until
[40:53] he was sure about this testimony now
[40:57] remember he got knocked down the Lord
[40:59] Jesus spoke to him said Saul Saul why
[41:02] persecute us thou me he said who are you
[41:04] Lord and he says I'm Jesus whom you
[41:06] persecute
[41:07] he was testing that brother Paul he had
[41:11] this testimony he had this experience
[41:13] but he had to go back and test it with
[41:17] the word
[41:19] it shows really to me it shows why
[41:24] Jesus trusted that Apostle so much to
[41:27] write most of this new testament
[41:30] here because he took such great care he
[41:34] wanted to be right let me read this
[41:37] quote to you something brother Branham
[41:38] said
[41:40] and you know I'm thinking about
[41:42] how much
[41:45] faith
[41:47] and
[41:48] um confidence the Lord hadn't had in
[41:51] Paul to write these letters see Paul may
[41:54] not have known it but the Lord was going
[41:56] to make Paul's letters New Testament
[41:58] Canon I mean this was absolutely
[42:03] the word of God that Paul was writing
[42:07] now here's what brother Branham says
[42:08] about this he says see where he was
[42:10] what a thing it must have been for Paul
[42:13] see all that he had been trained to do
[42:16] was vice versa so now with all the
[42:19] education he had it was just become not
[42:23] to him
[42:24] now he knew that he had experienced he
[42:28] knew that he had an experience so here's
[42:30] another good lesson for us that
[42:32] experience alone isn't enough
[42:37] important
[42:39] experience alone isn't enough it's got
[42:42] to be an experience according to the
[42:45] word of the Lord
[42:47] so him seeing this and know that it is a
[42:51] great something than that someone else
[42:53] somebody else had received it before him
[42:56] he took three years and six months down
[42:59] in the desert in Arabia taking the Bible
[43:02] as it was then the Old Testament and
[43:04] going down there to compare this
[43:07] experience that he had and to see if it
[43:11] was scriptural
[43:13] wow
[43:15] put yourself
[43:17] in Saul of tarsus's in his shoes
[43:22] you are knocked down
[43:25] the Lord speaks to you changes your
[43:28] whole life
[43:29] you're you're smitten blind you're blind
[43:32] for three days then you go and this this
[43:35] man of this new cult that you've been
[43:38] persecuting he comes he prays for you
[43:40] you're healed immediately and then you
[43:43] feel inspired and you you go and you
[43:45] even start preaching
[43:47] and then
[43:48] you say wait wait
[43:50] I got to make sure that I'm right
[43:53] how many would would really take that
[43:56] time not just I'm gonna go pray about it
[43:58] this weekend three years
[44:01] more than three years he he went down
[44:03] and got away from everybody and went
[44:06] down to this other place and prayed
[44:09] there and and searched the scriptures so
[44:12] he would know beyond any doubt that this
[44:16] experience that I have lines up
[44:18] perfectly with this Bible
[44:22] the Mormons are a group that
[44:25] one of the things they'll do some of my
[44:28] best friends growing up are Mormon still
[44:30] close with them fine fine people one of
[44:34] the things that they tell you is
[44:37] take this Mormon Book of Mormon take
[44:40] these things that we teach this teaching
[44:42] of Joseph Smith and and this Revelation
[44:45] take this and you pray about it
[44:49] and then you pray about it and then God
[44:51] will give you an experience
[44:54] to justify what this new faith is
[45:00] sounds good doesn't it makes sense it's
[45:03] false
[45:05] it's false because it doesn't line up
[45:07] with this word right here
[45:10] and it's another thing it's false
[45:12] because they're not saying go try to
[45:14] line it up with the scriptures they're
[45:16] saying you go and seek you go seek an
[45:19] experience and guess what millions of
[45:22] them
[45:24] not thousands hundreds Millions have had
[45:28] that same that experience
[45:30] to where they now say well I prayed
[45:34] about it and now I believe this Book of
[45:37] Mormon and I'm Mormon
[45:40] because they had an experience but it
[45:43] doesn't line up with this Bible
[45:46] but look Paul look at what Paul did Paul
[45:50] had this incredible experience that I
[45:52] mean
[45:53] it was it was on par with Moses
[45:56] Paul has this experience and yet Paul
[45:59] the the man of Great Character that he
[46:02] was he says no I'm gonna go check this
[46:04] out
[46:06] three over three years
[46:08] can you imagine what a man
[46:11] I mean so so often with us it's like I
[46:13] don't have time I got to get out I got
[46:14] to start preaching I got to do this I
[46:16] have my commission wait a minute
[46:19] stop
[46:20] check it with the word don't seek
[46:24] validation don't seek Vindication go
[46:27] back and check it and see if it lines up
[46:30] perfectly
[46:32] then after these three years
[46:34] and Arabia Paul comes back
[46:38] and spends two weeks with Peter
[46:41] Galatians 1 18 then after three years I
[46:44] went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and
[46:46] Abode with him 15 days
[46:48] so there he is with Peter now he's he's
[46:51] saying okay I've got this all lined out
[46:54] from Genesis all the way here through
[46:58] Malachi which was the last book they had
[47:00] and everything in between and he says
[47:02] it's lined out now I want to go talk to
[47:04] this man that have walked with him
[47:07] that had that had gone around and
[47:10] preached and saw him preach the gospel
[47:12] and all the Miracles that he he had done
[47:14] I'm going to spend two weeks 15 days
[47:18] with this man would you have not loved
[47:20] been a fly on the wall in that
[47:22] conversation
[47:23] Peter and Paul
[47:26] talking I can imagine Paul saying well
[47:29] what did he do when this happened
[47:31] and then Peter said oh we were on the
[47:33] boat and and he stood up on the on the
[47:36] bow of the boat and he said peace be
[47:38] still you know Paul was like yes it's
[47:41] him it's this Messiah that we have
[47:44] always wanted
[47:45] and just really just digging in and just
[47:49] listening to Peter
[47:52] you know and
[47:54] and for
[47:57] like
[47:59] for a pastor
[48:01] for someone that leads the church who
[48:04] would I want to have
[48:06] would I want to have someone that had
[48:08] come up
[48:09] say in in a certain way of thinking or
[48:13] have been educated According to some
[48:15] denomination and and had all of these
[48:18] credentials and just and then just
[48:20] brought it and then started preaching
[48:22] what he had learned or what I want
[48:25] someone that said you know what I'm
[48:26] going to test it
[48:29] and they say oh well you're a doubter no
[48:32] no
[48:32] this word is more important to me
[48:36] than just to take something that I've
[48:38] been taught my whole life
[48:40] I want to take it and I want to really
[48:43] understand it and compare it to this
[48:46] Bible and to make sure it is right
[48:51] those are the kind of leaders we need in
[48:53] church not someone that just thinks
[48:56] about A good sermon and and and then
[48:58] lines it up and and brings it out but
[49:01] someone that has really
[49:03] spent the time and has got themselves
[49:05] out of the way like this Saul of Tarsus
[49:08] and really put it before the Lord and
[49:12] said Lord
[49:13] I'm gonna forget everything I've ever
[49:14] knew just just like he did here and I
[49:17] just want what what you want me to know
[49:22] so let's go back
[49:24] to Acts chapter 9.
[49:28] this was a silent time
[49:32] those three years
[49:33] in Paul's life
[49:36] but at the end of this chapter we're
[49:38] going to see that plenty of stuff is
[49:40] going on
[49:41] Acts chapter 9
[49:43] where are we at verse 24. so in verse 23
[49:47] he probably returned
[49:49] from his three-year sabbatical I guess
[49:52] we could call it and after two weeks
[49:54] with Peter now he's back Saul of Tarsus
[49:58] is back on the field but they're laying
[50:01] in weight was known of Saul so so what
[50:04] happened is
[50:05] is they were going to Ambush him
[50:08] but they're laying in weight was known
[50:10] of Saul and they watched the gates day
[50:14] and night to kill him then his disciples
[50:16] took him by night and let him down by
[50:18] the wall in a basket
[50:19] obviously they're in a walled City and
[50:22] when Saul was come to Jerusalem he is
[50:24] saved to join himself to the disciples
[50:26] but they were all afraid of him and
[50:29] believe not that he was a disciple
[50:34] foreign
[50:35] this word of Saved means to try
[50:38] so when when Saul was come to Jerusalem
[50:41] he tried to join himself to the
[50:43] disciples
[50:45] that's sad
[50:47] you think about that he tried to
[50:49] fellowship with the church
[50:52] he wanted to he said hey friends you
[50:55] know I believe the same as you do it
[50:57] okay
[50:58] you stay away
[51:00] I feel this man overcame more than just
[51:03] about anybody in the book over on this
[51:06] side he had the Pharisees and the
[51:08] Sadducees they wanted to kill him
[51:11] and then over on this side he had these
[51:14] Disciples of Jesus
[51:16] these these these men and women of the
[51:19] way as it was called
[51:21] loving the Lord Jesus and out doing
[51:24] Miracles and and spreading the gospel
[51:26] and thousands were being converted all
[51:28] over and they're like you stay away
[51:30] we don't want anything to do with you
[51:32] either we don't really believe that
[51:34] you've converted
[51:35] and there's Paul in the middle yet he's
[51:38] stuck with it
[51:39] what a man
[51:41] stuck with it he knew his he knew his
[51:44] Revelation was sure he had spent the
[51:46] time
[51:47] he had spent the time in prayer he knew
[51:49] and yet both sides were against him
[51:52] right here
[52:00] you know
[52:01] I've seen people had a genuine desire to
[52:04] serve the Lord
[52:05] especially
[52:07] a lot of times it's it's young people
[52:12] and the Lord starts dealing with them
[52:14] they may be in there about 20 years old
[52:17] which is a lot of times when it starts
[52:19] 20 21 18 somewhere around there and the
[52:23] Lord starts dealing with these people
[52:25] with these young people
[52:27] and then
[52:29] they start trying
[52:32] and I'll tell you what church people can
[52:35] be so discouraging
[52:38] and they'll start condemning them
[52:41] they'll start they'll start talking
[52:43] about them and here you have a young man
[52:45] or a young woman who's who's they're not
[52:47] where they should be of course but
[52:49] neither am I
[52:50] where I should be either and I'm up here
[52:52] preaching I'm trying
[52:54] I'm getting better every day and and so
[52:56] are you are you and you should be but
[52:59] then there's these young people they'll
[53:01] come and they're doing their best
[53:02] they're trying and then they get
[53:04] condemned
[53:06] and it just drives them away how many
[53:08] times have I seen it how many times have
[53:10] I seen it at Youth Camp
[53:12] whether whether they'll have an
[53:15] experience and then instead of being
[53:17] greeted by love especially by the elders
[53:20] in the church they're greeted by well
[53:22] now you have to do this and this and
[53:23] this and they're agreed to buy a bunch
[53:25] of rules
[53:26] those rules friends come from the inside
[53:29] out
[53:30] that Holiness it comes from the inside
[53:34] out that love is what can bring those
[53:38] people in
[53:40] and I've seen it I've just seen it too
[53:43] many times
[53:45] but I thank God for a man of real
[53:46] courage like Paul Saul of Tarsus is this
[53:49] sign who stood up
[53:51] against that attitude
[53:53] and
[53:55] he put his own reputation
[53:57] on the line let me let me go back
[53:59] there's this man I want to go back to uh
[54:02] um
[54:05] no let's start at 27. there was a man
[54:08] that put his own reputation on the line
[54:11] which is verse 27 in Barnabas
[54:13] and he brought him to the apostles
[54:16] and declared unto them how he had seen
[54:19] the Lord in the way and that he had
[54:21] spoken to him and how he had preached
[54:23] boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus
[54:27] now remember Barnabas as I said last
[54:28] time Barnabas is this guy that that he
[54:32] was greatly respected in the
[54:34] congregation he had sold a piece of land
[54:37] that was probably worth a fairly large
[54:39] sum of money and he gave it all
[54:42] to the work of the Lord
[54:44] and
[54:47] he this man had had a good reputation
[54:50] so he took Barnabas took his reputation
[54:53] and he laid it on the line for this man
[54:55] named Saul of Tarsus and that's really
[54:58] to me in reading the Scriptures it looks
[55:00] like that's really how Saul started to
[55:02] be accepted
[55:05] I want to do the same
[55:08] how important is it
[55:10] to all of us a friend that would stand
[55:13] for us
[55:14] a friend that would go to battle for us
[55:16] doesn't matter if if we've messed up
[55:19] we've sinned we've done something dumb
[55:22] or or
[55:25] made a fool of ourselves
[55:28] it really feels good to have somebody
[55:30] that loves you
[55:31] have some somebody to put their arm
[55:34] around you and say hey I'm your friend
[55:36] no matter what
[55:37] thick or thin and I'm going to stick up
[55:40] for you when you're not here I'm going
[55:42] to go to battle for you just like this
[55:43] man Barnabas did for Saul
[55:46] and he was with them coming in and going
[55:49] out at Jerusalem now
[55:52] so so now if Saul is accepted and he's
[55:55] going in and out now let's go to acts 22
[55:58] for a minute
[56:00] and start with verse 6.
[56:03] now this is later on Paul is giving a
[56:06] testimony of what happened on the road
[56:08] to Damascus and this one they're pretty
[56:11] close they're not exactly the same as we
[56:14] just read in in Acts chapter 9 but Saul
[56:18] many many years later is recounting this
[56:21] verse 6 and it came to pass
[56:25] that this is Paul speaking that as I
[56:29] made my journey and was come nigh unto
[56:31] Damascus about noon suddenly they're
[56:33] shown from Heaven a great light round
[56:35] about me and I fell to the ground and
[56:38] heard a voice saying unto me Saul Saul
[56:40] why persecute us thou me
[56:42] and I answered who art thou Lord and he
[56:45] said unto me I am Jesus from Nazareth
[56:47] whom thou persecute us
[56:49] and they that with me they that were
[56:52] with me saw indeed the light and were
[56:54] afraid that they heard not the voice of
[56:57] him that spake to me
[56:59] I mentioned that in the last service and
[57:01] I said what shall I do lord and there is
[57:04] the Christian
[57:05] you give your heart to the Lord
[57:08] and it's not Lord what will you do for
[57:10] me it's Lord what can I do for you
[57:14] and the Lord said unto me arise and go
[57:16] into Damascus and there it shall be told
[57:18] the of all things which are appointed
[57:21] for thee to do
[57:22] and when I could not see for the glory
[57:25] of the of that light being led by the
[57:27] hand them that were with me I came to
[57:30] Damascus and one ananias a devout man
[57:33] according to the law having a good
[57:35] report of all the Jews which dwelt there
[57:37] came unto me and stood up and stood and
[57:40] said unto me brother Saul received thy
[57:42] sight
[57:43] in the same hour I looked upon him now
[57:46] that testimony is pretty much the same
[57:48] as what we read in Acts chapter 9.
[57:52] now listen to this
[57:54] and he said the god of our fathers hath
[57:56] chosen thee that thou shouldest know his
[57:58] will and see that just one and should
[58:01] just hear the voice of his mouth
[58:04] for thou shall be his witness unto all
[58:06] men of what thou has seen and heard and
[58:10] now why tarryest thou arise and be
[58:14] baptized and wash away thy sins calling
[58:17] on the name of the Lord again
[58:20] close pretty close to Acts chapter 9
[58:23] slightly different but about but about
[58:26] the same and you know it's it's a
[58:28] perfect example let me stop right there
[58:30] for a minute it's a perfect example of I
[58:33] see the brothers except especially
[58:35] people criticize brother Branham because
[58:37] he'll tell tell a story different
[58:39] differently over time
[58:41] and and they say well because he told it
[58:44] differently then it must not be true
[58:47] now right here we see a story that has
[58:50] been told fairly differently over time I
[58:54] believe it's told three times in the
[58:55] book of Acts twice by Paul and once by
[58:57] the original author Luke
[58:59] but just because it's told differently
[59:02] doesn't mean that it's different
[59:05] I was I was uh hunting one time
[59:09] and we I was hunting with my cousins
[59:13] and we we found this um skeleton of this
[59:17] deer
[59:18] and it had a mountain lion claw stuck in
[59:23] the the leg
[59:25] it was the neatest thing so this this
[59:28] mountain lion when it killed the deer it
[59:30] must have yanked out its claw so then I
[59:33] was hunting with my cousins
[59:35] and we we were going we noticed that
[59:38] there was a lot of fox
[59:40] scat in the area
[59:42] and they they go on the top of rocks to
[59:44] mark their territory
[59:46] and then
[59:49] another time uh well and then I was
[59:51] honey with my cousins and
[59:54] my cousin
[59:56] shot this deer the first time he'd ever
[59:58] been out with a bow
[1:00:00] and he'd shot like one time in the
[1:00:02] backyard and he pulls back and he kills
[1:00:05] this this whitetail deer which I've
[1:00:08] hunted for how many years and I've never
[1:00:10] been able to kill a whitetail deer with
[1:00:12] my bow
[1:00:14] so I tell those three stories
[1:00:17] but they're all the same story
[1:00:20] because on on that trip we had found
[1:00:23] this carcass of this deer it had a lion
[1:00:24] claw in it I was telling them about
[1:00:27] these foxes and how they marked their
[1:00:29] territory and then at the end my cousin
[1:00:32] uh Kyle kills this deer
[1:00:35] so just because I may tell this story
[1:00:37] differently it's still the same story I
[1:00:39] just leave out certain details and add
[1:00:41] certain details at different times and
[1:00:44] that's what is in this book of Acts when
[1:00:46] Paul is telling these stories sometimes
[1:00:49] he's leaving out details and sometimes
[1:00:51] he's putting in details they all
[1:00:53] happened but he's saying them because of
[1:00:56] his audience and he wants to focus on
[1:00:59] certain things like if you're a
[1:01:00] biologist I would tell the story about
[1:01:03] the fox you know and and just the
[1:01:06] different things like that
[1:01:08] so
[1:01:09] this wasn't
[1:01:11] this this part of acts right here wasn't
[1:01:14] recorded in the original testimony of
[1:01:16] Acts chapter 9.
[1:01:19] verse 17.
[1:01:21] a verse of chapter 22.
[1:01:23] thank you and it came to pass that when
[1:01:27] I was come again to Jerusalem even while
[1:01:30] I prayed in the temple I was in a trance
[1:01:34] now this is referring back to Acts
[1:01:36] chapter 9 that what we're studying right
[1:01:38] now but this is like 30 years later he's
[1:01:41] telling the story
[1:01:42] and it came to pass
[1:01:45] that when I was come again to Jerusalem
[1:01:48] even while I prayed in the temple I was
[1:01:51] in a trance and I saw him saying unto me
[1:01:54] make haste and get thee quickly out of
[1:01:57] Jerusalem for they will not receive thy
[1:02:00] testimony concerning me
[1:02:03] strange that they would receive Peter's
[1:02:05] testimony
[1:02:06] those same people but they wouldn't
[1:02:08] receive Paul's testimony so again look
[1:02:11] at the resiliency
[1:02:13] of Paul these people we don't want you
[1:02:17] but here's Peter
[1:02:19] and he's out and he's preaching the
[1:02:21] gospel and Paul may have been saying hey
[1:02:22] I have a PhD I studied this I went three
[1:02:25] years I understand all this there's no
[1:02:27] way that Peter can quote the scriptures
[1:02:29] like I can quote and yet they're like
[1:02:31] but we want Peter and we don't want you
[1:02:34] Paul
[1:02:39] and I said Lord
[1:02:41] they know that I imprisoned and beat in
[1:02:43] every synagogue them that believed on me
[1:02:45] and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen
[1:02:47] was shed I also was standing by and
[1:02:50] consenting unto his death and kept the
[1:02:52] arraignment of them that slew him now
[1:02:54] we're back to Acts chapter 8.
[1:02:56] and he said unto me depart for I will
[1:02:59] send the far hence unto the Gentiles
[1:03:05] so now let's go back to Acts chapter 9.
[1:03:08] this is really neat I read that for a
[1:03:10] reason I don't mean to bore you I read
[1:03:13] that for a reason
[1:03:18] there we go
[1:03:21] Acts chapter 9
[1:03:24] verse 29.
[1:03:28] and he spoke and he spoke boldly in the
[1:03:30] name of the Lord Jesus and dispute
[1:03:32] disputed against the grecians but they
[1:03:34] were they went about to slay him
[1:03:37] now these grecians brother Lyle pointed
[1:03:40] out that these grecians and other
[1:03:42] translations are called hellenists
[1:03:44] they're just Greek speaking Jews
[1:03:46] which when the Brethren knew
[1:03:50] they brought him down to caesarea and
[1:03:52] sent him forth to Tarsus
[1:03:56] now
[1:03:57] this
[1:03:59] caesarea
[1:04:01] I'm gonna I'm gonna skip that caesarea's
[1:04:03] uh
[1:04:05] um I was gonna gonna tell where this
[1:04:07] place is and then verse 31.
[1:04:10] then had they the church had the
[1:04:13] churches rest all throughout Judea and
[1:04:15] Galilee and Samaria and were edified and
[1:04:17] walking in the fear of the Lord now let
[1:04:19] me go back I skipped something I'm sorry
[1:04:20] I got confused here
[1:04:22] there's a place
[1:04:27] that
[1:04:28] Saul
[1:04:30] there's a place that in the previous
[1:04:32] that I just read that Saul it was made
[1:04:34] known to Saul
[1:04:36] that this plot that was against him
[1:04:40] so then what I just read is what Saul is
[1:04:44] saying later he said that I saw a vision
[1:04:47] and and I understood what it was that
[1:04:50] they were going to do to me there
[1:04:54] verse verse 28.
[1:04:57] and he was coming in and going out of
[1:04:59] Jerusalem
[1:05:08] verse 29 I'm sorry and he spake boldly
[1:05:11] in the name of Jesus and disputed
[1:05:13] against the grecians but they went about
[1:05:15] to slay him
[1:05:17] which when the Brethren knew they
[1:05:19] brought him out down they brought him
[1:05:21] down to caesarea and sent him forth to
[1:05:23] Tarsus now all the just all of a sudden
[1:05:26] the disciples
[1:05:27] and remember what I said about the
[1:05:29] difference between a disciple and
[1:05:31] apostle
[1:05:32] a disciple is anyone that believes Jesus
[1:05:35] you're with me an apostle is someone
[1:05:39] that believes Jesus
[1:05:41] but they're sent out on a mission they
[1:05:43] have a purpose to go out to do the work
[1:05:46] of the Lord
[1:05:49] and
[1:05:51] that's how Peter and John they could be
[1:05:53] disciples and they can be Apostles now
[1:05:56] Saul is also considered one of these
[1:06:00] Hellenist Jews and how do we know that
[1:06:02] because he came from a place called
[1:06:04] Tarsus which is outside of Israel
[1:06:09] so they sent him back to his hometown of
[1:06:12] Tarsus and now sawing Saul is going to
[1:06:15] be out of the picture for a while until
[1:06:16] chapter 13 in in Antioch now let me let
[1:06:19] me just sum up everything that I said
[1:06:21] and I just threw a whole bunch of
[1:06:22] information to you so so Saul goes and
[1:06:27] he goes and he separates himself for a
[1:06:30] while he goes to Arabia then he comes
[1:06:32] back and he spends 15 days with Peter
[1:06:36] and then he goes out and he's he's
[1:06:38] preaching and he's he's winning souls to
[1:06:41] Christ
[1:06:42] but then there's a time of quietness and
[1:06:47] that is right here that we don't see
[1:06:49] Saul anymore
[1:06:50] we don't see him in fact according to my
[1:06:53] Bible remember if you have a Scofield
[1:06:55] bible
[1:06:57] in the middle of the pages there you
[1:06:59] have the dates according to my Bible
[1:07:00] it's seven years
[1:07:03] until we see Paul again
[1:07:07] it says here then the then had the
[1:07:09] churches rest all throughout Judea and
[1:07:11] Galilee and Samara so Paul's gone
[1:07:15] and now we go back to Peter
[1:07:19] and walking in the fear of the Lord in
[1:07:21] the comfort of the Holy Ghost they were
[1:07:22] multiplied
[1:07:24] now remember I said that this is a
[1:07:27] pivotal time in in the book of Acts
[1:07:30] where you have you have Paul he gets his
[1:07:32] commission he he gets everything square
[1:07:34] and now he leaves and he goes across the
[1:07:38] Mediterranean to these Greek speaking
[1:07:40] Jews and he starts preaching there and
[1:07:43] now the book of Acts is going to go back
[1:07:46] to the Judea here back to Jerusalem and
[1:07:50] back to all of this area of Israel
[1:07:52] remember Paul's left now
[1:07:54] and now for the next span of time we're
[1:07:58] going to stay right here in Israel and
[1:08:03] we have Peter preaching again
[1:08:07] and it came to pass
[1:08:09] as Peter passed through all quarters he
[1:08:12] came down also to the saints that dwelt
[1:08:14] at Lita now Lita is on the coast
[1:08:18] so Jerusalem is not on the coast but if
[1:08:20] you go north and west all the way to the
[1:08:22] coast then you'll get to this place
[1:08:24] called Lita again it's in Israel
[1:08:28] and there he found a certain man named
[1:08:30] Enos which had kept his bed eight years
[1:08:33] and was sick of the palsy so this man
[1:08:36] had been in his bed for eight years he
[1:08:38] was crippled he was maybe like a
[1:08:42] Parkinson's type disease or something
[1:08:43] like that and Peter said unto him
[1:08:46] Enos
[1:08:48] Jesus Christ maketh the whole arise and
[1:08:51] make thy bed and he arose immediately
[1:08:54] and all that dwelted Lita and seren saw
[1:08:57] him and turned to the Lord now
[1:09:01] what I wanted to get to here was look at
[1:09:04] the difference
[1:09:06] between the two ministries of Peter and
[1:09:08] Paul
[1:09:09] Paul is this educated man who can take
[1:09:13] the scriptures and make them in such a
[1:09:15] way to make the people believe and
[1:09:18] here's Peter over here Peter doesn't
[1:09:20] have the education he may not have the
[1:09:22] Charisma that Paul had but Peter goes
[1:09:24] over here and he's healing people
[1:09:26] and they're seeing all of these Miracles
[1:09:29] and they're like wow I'm going to turn
[1:09:30] to the Lord because of this man Peter
[1:09:33] now Peter was sent here to these people
[1:09:35] that needed that type of thing
[1:09:39] the ultimate goal the ultimate goal for
[1:09:42] both of them
[1:09:43] is to get the people to Christ
[1:09:45] that is the most important thing it
[1:09:48] doesn't you know as I said last time you
[1:09:51] can you can get sick and then you can
[1:09:53] get healed but you're gonna get sick
[1:09:55] again
[1:09:56] the whole thing with healing and and all
[1:09:59] these Miracles is to help us but it's
[1:10:01] the main thing is to point us to Christ
[1:10:04] to show us that Christ is alive and
[1:10:06] that's what Paul was doing over here
[1:10:08] Paul is studying the scriptures and he's
[1:10:11] laying them out and people are coming to
[1:10:13] the Lord wow just like the eunuch did
[1:10:16] in in the desert poll ex or um Philip
[1:10:20] explained it and he gave his heart to
[1:10:22] the Lord now you see over here Peter's
[1:10:24] doing Miracles and they're giving their
[1:10:26] hearts to the Lord that's the ultimate
[1:10:27] goal for all of it
[1:10:30] now there was a japa a certain disciple
[1:10:33] named Tabitha
[1:10:35] which is by interpretation is called
[1:10:37] Dorcas this woman was full of good works
[1:10:40] in alms deej Deeds which she did
[1:10:43] Tabitha is the Hebrew name and Dorcas is
[1:10:48] the Greek name
[1:10:50] again remember who the author is
[1:10:54] the author of this book Luke he's not
[1:10:58] the conservative
[1:11:01] um old-fashioned Jew
[1:11:04] Luke's not afraid to mention the sisters
[1:11:06] in neither either his gospel or his book
[1:11:10] of Acts that's why you see many of the
[1:11:12] sisters more
[1:11:13] in the book of Acts and in the Book of
[1:11:15] Luke
[1:11:16] and she must have been a this Tabitha
[1:11:18] must have been a very special lady
[1:11:21] in because so many people loved her and
[1:11:24] so many people were crying at her
[1:11:26] funeral and she was had all these acts
[1:11:28] of Charity which is alms Deeds it's the
[1:11:30] same thing as as giving to the poor and
[1:11:33] it came to pass in those days that she
[1:11:35] was sick and died whom when they had
[1:11:38] washed they later in an upper chamber
[1:11:43] now when it says that they had washed
[1:11:46] her that is the Jewish ritual of
[1:11:49] preparing a body to be buried
[1:11:52] so she died
[1:11:54] and of course mourned and then they take
[1:11:57] the body they wash it
[1:12:00] and then they Anointed with uh with the
[1:12:04] spices and the ointments that they
[1:12:05] Anointed with then they put it in the
[1:12:07] grave before the uh it sounds gross but
[1:12:11] before the body like starts stinking and
[1:12:13] and it corruption sets in
[1:12:16] so they were at that point here
[1:12:21] and
[1:12:22] listen to this verse number 38.
[1:12:27] and for as much as little was nigh unto
[1:12:30] japa
[1:12:31] and the disciples had heard that Peter
[1:12:33] was there they sent unto him two men
[1:12:36] Desiring him that they would not delay
[1:12:38] to come to them this is very interesting
[1:12:42] this sister's dead
[1:12:45] but they knew that Peter was kind of
[1:12:47] nearby
[1:12:50] and they must have remembered
[1:12:52] now I can't prove this in the scripture
[1:12:55] but they must have remembered they had
[1:12:58] maybe heard the story or
[1:13:01] Maybe
[1:13:02] someone was there that remembered this
[1:13:05] story of this man Jairus this man Jairus
[1:13:09] was a priest with Jesus so Jairus is
[1:13:12] jairus's daughter was sick he came to
[1:13:15] Jesus and he said Lord would you come
[1:13:17] and pray for my daughter she's very sick
[1:13:19] so Jesus starts on the way and there's
[1:13:22] Miracles that happen on the way over to
[1:13:24] jairus's house is when that he was
[1:13:26] walking along and the the young lady
[1:13:29] with the blood issue
[1:13:31] that she came and she touched the very
[1:13:33] Hem of His Garment and she was healed
[1:13:36] and he turned and he said who touched me
[1:13:37] you know the story so he's walking and
[1:13:40] then it comes back she's dead
[1:13:44] so Jesus is he continues on and he says
[1:13:47] no she's not dead she sleeps so he
[1:13:49] continues on and he goes to this house
[1:13:52] and there's everybody crying and
[1:13:54] mourning and all of this and he goes in
[1:13:56] and he puts everybody out
[1:13:59] except for Peter and James and John and
[1:14:04] the mom and the dad
[1:14:06] so he goes in there and he goes in and
[1:14:09] he says
[1:14:11] uh talitha forgot exactly what he said
[1:14:14] but young lady arise
[1:14:16] and she rose up
[1:14:19] a miracle now listen to the way that
[1:14:23] this scripture in the book of Acts when
[1:14:26] Peter comes listen to this
[1:14:30] then Peter arose and went with them
[1:14:33] and when he was come they brought him
[1:14:35] into the upper chamber and all the
[1:14:37] widows stood by him weeping and showing
[1:14:39] the coats in the garments which dork has
[1:14:41] made while she was with them
[1:14:43] again this Tabitha called Dorcas she
[1:14:46] must have been a very very special lady
[1:14:49] now
[1:14:50] what I'm quoting here is Luke chapter
[1:14:52] eight what I just told that story about
[1:14:55] Jesus going to Jairus daughter but Peter
[1:14:58] put them all forth he put them all out
[1:15:01] and he kneeled down and he prayed
[1:15:04] so Peter was like hey I've been in this
[1:15:06] situation before I was there
[1:15:09] Jesus came in and he put out all of
[1:15:12] those other people he came in and I got
[1:15:14] to stand there and I got to watch this
[1:15:16] and Jesus rose this young lady up
[1:15:19] now this book of Acts it's like a mirror
[1:15:22] of the Gospel
[1:15:24] the the very same things happen in the
[1:15:27] book of Acts that happened in when Jesus
[1:15:30] was here now listen to this
[1:15:33] but Peter put them all forth put them
[1:15:35] all out and kneeled down and prayed and
[1:15:38] turning him to the body
[1:15:41] said
[1:15:42] Tabitha
[1:15:44] arise
[1:15:46] and she opened her eyes and when she saw
[1:15:49] Peter she sat up
[1:15:51] and he gave her his hand and lifted her
[1:15:54] up and when he had called the Saints and
[1:15:57] widows presented her alive
[1:16:01] mirror
[1:16:03] of Luke chapter 8.
[1:16:06] exactly the same it was the same It Was
[1:16:11] the Same Spirit
[1:16:13] that was in Jesus
[1:16:15] that went to jairus's daughter that Rose
[1:16:18] her up look at that Spirit was now in
[1:16:21] this man Peter and Peter went in and did
[1:16:24] the exact same thing
[1:16:28] and what's amazing to me is those
[1:16:30] disciples call them after she was dead
[1:16:34] they called him
[1:16:37] and it was known throughout Joppa and
[1:16:40] many believed in the Lord
[1:16:42] and it came to pass that Isaiah carried
[1:16:44] many days in Joppa that he he tarried
[1:16:47] many days in Joppa with one Simon a
[1:16:50] Tanner
[1:16:52] now in Acts
[1:16:55] chapter 9. as I said this is a pivotal
[1:16:59] time
[1:17:00] this is when that we have
[1:17:05] Jerusalem and the Jews and the message
[1:17:07] going around there and then it starts to
[1:17:10] kind of Squirt out to the areas around
[1:17:12] there and then it it gets to Damascus
[1:17:15] and then we have Paul step on the scene
[1:17:17] now we have a transition period from
[1:17:19] chapter 9 to chapter 12 or chapter 13
[1:17:24] when things really start to shift
[1:17:29] and it's amazing shift that happens
[1:17:33] right here
[1:17:34] and we look back
[1:17:37] we see that
[1:17:38] now we have really these two great
[1:17:42] Servants of the Lord and I'm wrapping up
[1:17:45] if the musicians want to come we have
[1:17:47] these two great Servants of the Lord
[1:17:50] going out
[1:17:53] and preaching the gospel we have this
[1:17:56] period of quietness we don't really know
[1:17:58] what's going on for about seven years
[1:18:01] that Saul of Tarsus he goes out away
[1:18:05] from from Judea to the to the Greeks
[1:18:09] to the greek-speaking Jews and also to
[1:18:14] the Gentiles and now we have Peter just
[1:18:19] primed to see a major shift
[1:18:23] in the whole Ministry
[1:18:25] and this major shift
[1:18:28] is what we call the Gentile dispensation
[1:18:34] and it's all starting right here and
[1:18:39] things something is going to happen in
[1:18:42] this next chapter in Acts chapter 10
[1:18:45] that is really going to just solidify
[1:18:49] that and change everyone especially as
[1:18:52] Peter's way of thinking
[1:18:54] because the Lord is going to instruct
[1:18:57] him now all right now we're going to
[1:19:00] move in a different direction
[1:19:02] you're with me and that is Acts chapter
[1:19:05] 10. so Acts chapter 9 we see this we see
[1:19:09] the Apostle Paul we see we see him
[1:19:11] change we see him go out and study and
[1:19:15] the most important thing that I want
[1:19:16] everyone to get
[1:19:18] tonight is what I said about him going
[1:19:22] and studying for these for these three
[1:19:24] years
[1:19:25] and how that he had this great
[1:19:28] experience but yet he had to check it
[1:19:32] with this word and even as great of a
[1:19:36] theologian as he was and how well he
[1:19:37] knew it he still it was such an
[1:19:40] important decision that he had to make
[1:19:42] sure that it lined up with this Bible
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:47] well
[1:19:48] we got through Acts chapter 9.
[1:19:51] it's uh it's a great book
[1:19:54] I enjoy it so much I uh sorry I got I
[1:19:58] got uh a little bit confused there
[1:20:01] before but I was I was wanting to bring
[1:20:03] out that it was so neat to me that that
[1:20:07] in the beginning of Acts it says that
[1:20:09] that it was made known to Paul and then
[1:20:12] later he said that I saw a vision
[1:20:15] and the Lord warned me to go out
[1:20:17] sometimes you wonder why it's like Lord
[1:20:19] why did you warn him why don't you just
[1:20:22] wipe it away
[1:20:23] why don't you just kill him
[1:20:25] but it's just God's way he has his way
[1:20:27] of doing things and one thing that in
[1:20:30] the book of Acts that I'm seeing more
[1:20:32] and more that's a theme
[1:20:34] is God uses different people
[1:20:38] it's not all just one Prophet or or one
[1:20:41] person that's doing everything this holy
[1:20:44] spirit is spread out and they really
[1:20:47] they work together
[1:20:49] like the disciples let Paul out on the
[1:20:51] basket over the wall and he got to
[1:20:54] safety he he's just he's having
[1:20:57] everybody really work together and and
[1:21:00] this gospel starting to spread and now
[1:21:03] in this next chapter we're going to see
[1:21:05] wow
[1:21:07] big big

[1:27:04] coming out tonight we've
[1:27:07] read God's word your brother Brown said
[1:27:11] one one thing is
[1:27:12] one of my favorite things that he ever
[1:27:14] said he said that if I could just read
[1:27:19] a scripture out of the Bible I know that
[1:27:22] it would never be for naught that the
[1:27:25] people will have heard the word of God
[1:27:27] and I feel the same way
[1:27:30] and uh I also
[1:27:33] feel that I want everybody to have high
[1:27:36] expectations for this weekend
[1:27:38] for Mother's Day I know the Lord as I
[1:27:42] said the Lord did something
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:44] um really powerful
[1:27:46] up in there's some witnesses here up in
[1:27:49] Phoenix and I want to give the testimony
[1:27:52] of that
[1:27:54] and I think it'll be a blessing to you I
[1:27:56] think that you'll probably be able to
[1:27:58] apply it to your own lives
[1:28:00] and it just helped me
[1:28:04] really helped me to understand that that
[1:28:08] believe that we're doing something
[1:28:09] really special
[1:28:11] I believe God's with us
[1:28:13] and I just I have a feeling that this
[1:28:18] weekend is going to be a special weekend
[1:28:21] maybe this Sunday will who knows maybe
[1:28:24] the Lord will come I'm looking for him
[1:28:27] tomorrow if if we don't make it to
[1:28:29] Sunday it'd be fine but I think it's

[1:28:38] expectations this weekend and it'll be a
