amelia gonzalez this evening so it's a fairly lengthy one and i may not read it all but i'll just paraphrase it sister amelia she's knows of a couple sisters young ladies in their 20s and they're both pregnant one of them is her granddaughter one of them is dealing with a one of the [Music] organs in the body is only functioning at 30 percent i believe at the heart maybe and the doctors are recommending to both of these mothers to abort their babies one's six months along and so sister amelia says she's just asking for salvation and healing for both of them she says god answers prayer amen we know god answers prayer brother [Music] god bless you all this evening it's a privilege to be gathered together in the name of the lord jesus christ to be able to unite our hearts together in prayer to the one that we love the one that brings us salvation the one that brings us healing the one that answers prayer let's just go to him together lord jesus we are so grateful for this opportunity that we can have to be siblings in christ to join our hearts and our minds and our thoughts together to lay aside the thoughts and the pressures and the problems of this world that's around us lord the suffering and the pain and the just the insanity that we see lord jesus help us to just draw closer to one another and closer to you lord i pray that you'd answer this prayer that's

bearing with me to singing some new songs as david says you sing a new song to the lord i suppose sometimes we sing these songs that are written by contemporary christian musicians but maybe we don't have too many message believers writing new songs either so sometimes we use those other ones but if they're a blessing you know we just go on amen we're going to take one right out of the hymnal though this point he lives he lives christ jesus lives today man you serve a risen savior amen well some of you do amen amen i serve a rise and save he's in the world today i know that he is living

[Music] on amen god bless you all it's good to see each one of you let's open the service in a word of prayer and invite our lord jesus [Music] our lovely savior and god almighty lord [Music] we pray that you would join us tonight and lord that there would be a touch for each one that maybe a question on the heart or maybe a prayer answered or a healing that's needed that you would step on the scene lord we humbly invite you to come amongst us father help me help me to present this lord in the way that i believe you gave it to me in jesus name amen god bless you all you may be seated sister emilia that was a noble request my sister we um sometimes things get hard and and as human beings we get things all mixed up and and we make mistakes and we suffer for those mistakes but if we put them in the hands of the lord he is able to untie the knots and he's able to make something good out of something so difficult so we'll be praying that uh of the prayer request that you put in that was you right sister millionaire that put that in about the two girls okay well we'll keep those in prayer he's able to untie the knots you know we messed things up but how many times have i messed things up and he straightened out everything and and made it all for his glory i had a good service this morning i i was i was really blessed i i loved sister lydia's song oh it was such a blessing about the prayers and and then brother john your song was they they were so different from each other but oh they were just equally as beautiful and just really a blessing thank you both of you for for doing that well john we're going to miss you i don't like that you're leaving we might flatten the tires of that bus you've been here longer than i have it's uh we're gonna miss you we're gonna miss you you and your family um you all are a real blessing to us oh yeah i was telling my wife when i left i'm leaving i'm going to take off for a couple weeks i'm going to see my kids my babies in jeffersonville um i was telling stephanie this morning when we left i said you know this is the first time i've ever been with a group of people that i didn't want to leave i i just even for a couple weeks i was like honey i don't want to leave them i just love seeing them at service i i love being with them um and i like going to church and i think that the more we grow in the lord the more that we'll want to be in this building and the more that these pews will fill up and i look forward to i look forward to great things ahead of a lot of hope a lot of hope for what's what's going to happen in the future i i started kind of a little series i guess it was i preached on nehemiah chapter 8 a few weeks ago and how the role of the ministry as perfectly described in nehemiah chapter 8 he starts and they read the book of moses remember and they all stood up and and then the ministers they helped the people to understand what was just read and it could be read in the bible maybe on a tape you know we listened to brother branham i didn't quite understand that and it's our role maybe not to bring a new message but to to help explain the message that's already been brought i know brother greene i heard brother bran i'm talking about brother green the other day and he said brother greene said that brother greene said that it's not my role to bring a new message but but just to concentrate on what's already been brought brother brown thought that was a noble thing and i feel the same way that we have a message it's been brought and now let's just really dig into it and understand it first then i spoke on the serpent seed and now the serpent seeds misunderstood it's you have two young people and they're in the garden of eden and god wanted them to prosper he loved them they were his children and they they were youth you know they were they were young people and he said just don't do this one thing and as young people are first thing that they do well why not you know you know and then they start wondering well why can't i do that even like a little kid don't go outside well then he wants to go outside you know what whatever it might be and then and then they made this mistake and then god makes a way for them as a father and he loved his children and he made away from them and he slowly killed this lamb and he wrapped up their nakedness their shame and then that was the first place that we see a sacrifice and then we see a sacrifice all of these years until our lord jesus came and then god gave that sacrifice as the perfect sacrifice and then we then on the next one we had uh some baptisms here which uh spurred some questions and it should talking about baptism okay well what about this one about that so i had some questions about that so i ministered on baptism and i what had happened as a prelude to that is our brother peter mcfadden um back there i don't see him but brother peter was witnessing to a young jewish man and this young jewish man accepted the lord jesus christ as his savior and peter was counseling him on these things and i felt on my heart not knowing that peter was dealing with this young man named david and i felt on my heart to preach on baptism because of the questions that we had received because of the baptism that was here and the lord has a way of tying in again all he places the puzzle pieces just perfectly so i texted brother peter and i said hey i'm going to be ministering on baptism because i know he had been worth witnessing to this young man well the young man came his name is david i recognize him in the service and i preached about how baptism comes with a name and that that's part of it and baptism what is one requirement for baptism is a confession of the lord jesus christ that is paramount to baptism i accept the lord jesus christ as my savior i believe he is the son of god and then there is a promise that goes along with that baptism which is the filling of the holy spirit am i right acts 2 38 of course and then talking about that i gave two examples do you remember i gave a a seek that some of the brothers in jeffersonville had witnessed to he uh a sikh from india like a hindu they're different but uh in in that part of the world and uh i gave kind of kind of the failure there where these brothers had pushed him to be baptized and they asked me to baptize him and when i talked to him i asked him if he had accepted the lord jesus as a savior and he said no he hadn't then i said i'm not going to baptize him so then they baptized them anyways and it turned out it was a train wreck because the the man moved in with one of the brothers and started stealing from it and then finally they kicked him out but then i gave another example of the good way and that was a brother joseph ayers a friend of mine brother rome you know where's brother rome there you are you know brother brother ayers right you remember brother harris of course brother ayers had uh had it on his heart he gave his heart to the lord jesus and he had it on his heart to be baptized and so brother ayres had asked a few different brothers to baptize him they said no because he smoked cigarettes well brother collins who was living here in tucson at the time he brings brother heirs up to sabino canyon and baptizes him and then to make a long story short that was the last cigarette brothers heir smoked so it was it was just it was a nice little testimony and not knowing what you're saying well this brother was sitting up here he tells brother peter okay i want to be baptized and i want to be baptized in sabino canyon so two days later brother peter brother lyle brother john borland back there and me go up to baptize this young man in the name of the lord jesus christ in sabino canyon freezing cold but they didn't shiver a bit brother peter brought him into the water and brother peter baptized him and it was just a wonderful day wasn't it so then afterwards sister heather makes us breakfast at her house so we all the gang comes and and we are eating breakfast at sister heather's house and giving testimonies and and uh this young man david he's was born i believe in jerusalem a translator into hebrew spanish and english very much a jew so he and brother lyles kind of spoke the same language they were singing hebrew songs and you know we were doing like a lot of people doing church and just kind of you know moving your mouth like you know no words are coming out so then so then brother-in-law and then we switched a couple that we knew but we're fellowshipping around the table and the the name of god came up and brother david said and i believe it was brother peter that witnessed him he's about bad baptism he said as soon as i saw that there was a name associated with baptism i knew it was right so we started talking and it spurred the conversation of talking about the name of god in the old testament and if real quick uh have you turned in your bibles to job chapter one this isn't my subject but it will lead into my subject if you look let's say uh let's go to verse six it says now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord now notice that lord notice it's all caps now i'm going to give you a little bible lesson that all caps is the name of god and it is spelled and brother lyle can give the explanation it's spelled y-h-w-h you are not permitted to pronounce that name out loud if you are a jew so and you find now all throughout your bible you will find in certain things that are all capped sometimes it's god usually it's lord and when you see that it's that y h w h it's called the tetragrammaton or something like that um and it's the name of god so as our brother david was talking he was saying that that he was breaking down that name and he was saying that it is past tense the first part of it present tense the middle of it and future tense the end of it so then brother john immediately says when he says that brother john says the same yesterday today and forever oh man it was beautiful even jesus christ even way back in the old testament he's testified even with the name of god and you see when the new testament comes along that name all caps lord it disappears it's mysteriously gone you know brother branham's revelation jehovah of the old testament this yahweh this yh vh this this mysterious god there he is made flesh and out in front of us all right so what a what a blessing that that was to um be there bro it was just i was i was on fire i was so excited that uh when we were talking about about those things and um so then i got another question and it's from someone i know to be a prayer warrior and um but first before i get into the question second timothy 3 16 says all scripture is given by inspiration of god and profitable for doctrine so if it's written in this bible then it's good for doctrine we can preach about it now we have to know what it means first we can't go into this haphazardly but we uh we're okay to minister on these things and this this um question came up and i knew the answer when the sister gave me the question but as i was praying for it i saw that it got a lot deeper and if you go to job 1 6 it says this now there was a day when the sons of god came to the to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it now flip over to job 2 verse 1. and again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord and the lord said unto satan from whence cometh thou and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it now that word satan is a hebrew word and it means accuser and as i was researching this and praying about this i thought about saint john 14 and 15 and christ the holy spirit is the comforter so we have the opposites here we have the accuser that comes here before the lord and then later on we have the comforter that comes the question that my sister asked was who were these sons of god that came to offer themselves very very deep question somebody that has a lot of understand i don't think that she would want me maybe to to say who she is sister sheila you don't mind if i say no i can't no okay i won't i won't tell anybody but what a question what what what a tremendous question and um first of all they come here and satan among is among them it doesn't say satan is one of them let me let me read this quote from from um sirs we would see jesus now there's always three classes of people every meeting has them every city has them every church has them that is unbelievers make believers and believers that's exactly right it's the it's always been that way it is yet today every congregation every assembling together even when the sons of god came up before god there he was so when we're when we're studying these things if i don't immediately know if i can't just really know it by the scriptures of course god sent us a gift in this day a great gift a gift that should not be neglected and that is god sent a prophet according to scriptures and friends sometimes we we look at brother branham and we say we say oh well you have to be careful about looking at a man brother wasn't that a great story that that brother told about the elk hunting and it's just a man well god uses men and with brother branham it's not just a man it's god speaking through a man so when we don't understand these scriptures we have a gift in the tapes and and going to the voice of god product the table and look for these things it's it's the first thing that we should do when we think that we have a revelation is look and see let's see what the prophet said about it so towards the end of the book of job chapter 38 let me read another scripture here sister shirley and you might like this one too 38 verse 4 where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou has understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations have fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy now i'm going to make an assumption i'm going to make the assumption that these sons of god are the same sons of god as in verse chapter 1 and chapter 2. i looked back at all the different translations it looks like the very same ones and there's some as i look to other comments on this there's some of the theologians that say oh well well these are angels um if uh if you go to hebrews chapter one it says this and you don't have to turn no i'll read it real quick it says for under which of the angels said he had any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will beat him a father and he shall be my son right here paul is saying or the author of hebrews is saying that angels are not sons of god we are sons of god and there was one virgin born begotten son of god so let's go to our first quote here spiritual amnesia so we see that many scholars think that these are angels i would differ notice and he is in me and i in him notice then every christian that's a real genuine christian christian was with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we are identified in the immortal realms with god 10 million years before the world ever was formed i was back there with him if i got eternal life i was there with him i was identified with them when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy so was i sister shirley i believe i was there i believe we were there we can't understand it we i'm not i'm not saying that there's some sort of pre-existence doctrine or anything like that but i do believe that i was in jesus christ and i believe that i was there with those sons of god let me go on adoption number two uh brother let's start at the let's start at the scripture adoption number two having predestinated us having predestinated them unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to his own pleasure to the praises of his glory you got it right there yeah keep on going down there right before 149 go to 149. oh do you get it to the praises of his glory that he could set there in the eternal ages that is to roll on and his children would scream abba father abba father and the angels say what they talking about what are they talking about so beautifully displayed in the prodigal son i was lost this is my son he was lost and now he's found he was dead and he's alive again bring forth the fatted calf the best robe a ring and put it on his finger and let's no wonder when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy when they seen the plan of salvation god putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world yeah that's something to shout about praise the lord and i believe again i was there the serpent's seed brother branham's praying he says this he says dear god the great and mighty god who formed all things by the power of his spirit and has brought jesus christ his only begotten son who freely died for we sinners the just for the unjust to reconcile us back into this marvelous fellowship that we have again with god as we are taught in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when god in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through jesus thank the lord again serpent seed brother branham says this i want to ask you who is this job 27 38 he said where was you when i laid the foundations of the earth when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy who were those sons of god that was shouting for joy jesus told them that i had joy with you before the foundation of the world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of eternity i believe we were there and another thing you know i was i was talking to him earlier about how much that i don't want to leave you you know i i i don't want to leave this little group and i feel like if we were with christ and we are in christ together then we were with each other we don't remember that of course and and i don't know that brother bernard i i can't say this for sure but i do believe that we were together i believe that we had fellowship in christ you know eternity doesn't start right here eternity it goes as far this way as it goes that way so it's as far behind us as it is in front of us we are not as brother braham said we are not creatures of time we don't understand these things our minds can't understand eternity now i think it was well paul said he said eye has not seen an ear is not heard the joy for those that love god and i think it's the same way we don't understand many of these things of god isaiah said my ways are not your ways my thoughts are not your thoughts our thoughts are not god's thoughts he's greater than us but we were with him and i believe very very strongly that we were together in christ eternity that way and eternity this way i was as i was praying about this sister shirley i loved the question and it meant a lot to me and i was as i was praying about it i said lord how will this help the congregation this isn't a trivia you know this isn't me getting up here and saying oh this is i bet you didn't know this oh that's nice no that's that's not the way church is it we have to apply it to our lives brother aaron i i think i used one time i used um the analogy of google maps you know you get on your computer and you get on there and and you grab the little guy and you have the map down in front of you and you're looking at the map like this and you grab the little guy and you drop him on the street view and he wiggles his arm and he lands and then he looks around and you can see the street and all of a sudden you are on that street and that's how this bible is we can take ourselves and we place ourselves in this word and then then we are men then we can do the will of god and then we can not only receive what we have need of but we can also be servants to others and we can do it right not make mistakes so i was praying about it and i didn't uh i didn't really know how is this how is this going to bless the people how will this encourage the people in the position that we're in now and i believe the lord laid something on my heart and i i could be wrong i don't uh i don't like to say lord told me something there's many times that i get a revelation and i believe it comes from god but then i always have to check that revelation i always have to pray about that revelation because it can seem so real and yet be wrong so i was studying and meditating on this and praying on this and i believe the lord did give me the scripture if you turn to matthew chapter 8 with me now remember we have a representation i believe that i just proved from what brother branham said what job said that there is a representation over on the other side somewhere we call it heaven somewhere over there daniel evans is represented and then i saw jesus in this sermon he makes reference to the same thing we'll start with verse 1. at that time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven look at we already have a dispute here we you know i want a position i want to be the pastor no i want to be the deacon i want to be this you know everybody wants it for themselves and even like when our children or many of us are dads when our kids are fighting it doesn't matter to us who's right with our kids you know they're hollering and they're fighting it's like peace stop well he did this i don't care it doesn't matter just just peace and here's what jesus says and jesus called a little child unto him and he set him in the midst of them and he said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as this as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven brother aaron i believe ministered this morning he talked about that we are nothing but god is everything and then we we should become humble and as innocent as a child and then and then we'll enter in whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such as a such little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he would drown in the depths of the sea friends we should be careful what we say we may very well be talking about someone that has a representative representative in heaven and i'm going to get to that and i'm going to prove what i just said watch our tongues do everything in love woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs that offenses come but woe unto that man by whom the offense cometh wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from me it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet and be cast into everlasting fire let me tell you jesus christ preached holiness he preached living a holy life he didn't preach legalism if he would have preached legalism he would have a set of rules you know your hair needs to be this long his skirt needs to be this long you have to do your face has to look like this your brothers you have to wear your pants like this and your tie like this he would have given us a set of rules he didn't do that but he said if your hand causes you to sin which is what he was talking about an offense cut it off that's how important it is and if television causes us to sin get rid of it if the internet causes us to sin get rid of it jesus wasn't preaching a rule a set of rules but if those things are causing us to sin get rid of it and who did he put the decision on not not the pulpit he put the decision on the individual if thine eye if any pluck it out and cast it from me for it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes and be cast into hell fire take heed now listen to this take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven notice that these children had a representation at that time in heaven so he says don't offend one of these these little ones because right now somehow someway some people call it theophany body some people call it a celestial body it's it's a little bit above my pay grade to understand all these things i believe them and i love them and so many people tell me oh it's this and this thank you i don't i still don't understand it but i do believe it i do believe that there is some sort of a representative up there for daniel evans in the presence of god now just like there was for these kids for the son of man is come to save that which was lost how think he if a man have a hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray that he not leave the 90 and 9 and goeth into the mountains and seek that which one that which has gone astray one thing we have lost friends in the so-called message of the hour one thing that i think has faded brother wilson is our love for lost souls and our burden for lost souls jesus right here says that there's 99 sheep be like oh fine i'll just keep my 99 let the one go and get eaten by wolves no that one is the one that that shepherd is focused on go and get that sheep what if that sheep is your son or your daughter what if that sheep is your grandson or your granddaughter what if that sheep is your husband or your wife that sheep is the focus of jesus of this sermon right here we cannot neglect those oh amen where was i where am i verse 12. i was just rejoicing over that that verse that scripture the 99 are in they're in the pen they're okay but when that one gets out friends this whole church should mobilize and go get them and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the 90-9 which went not astray even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee and go go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou has gained thy brother now here we get into the lesson that i want to give friends what's the first thing we do when somebody wrongs us do we tell the brother or the sister no we go tell everybody else jesus said go to you and him alone am i right that's a hard thing to do and if you do you've gained your brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if you still neglect to hear them tell it to unto the church but if you neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen and a heathen man and a publican verily i say unto you whosoever whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven once again we see a connection between earth and heaven there is there is something going on between here and there oh again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am in the midst of them jesus is saying that we should have unity unity is important and peter it wasn't computing he didn't get it maybe peter's was stuck in the old testament for a little while and and he didn't understand this and he says he says wait wait a minute wait a minute teacher hold on a second and he says this then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times look at all what this guy has done to me and you want me to forgive him seven times jesus answered jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until 70 times seven i was uh when i worked at voice of god we were we were in the mail room the power went out in the building so we were uh all of our computers are off so we all kind of congregated in the biggest room in the voice of god building in jeffersonville it which is the mail room and there's tables out there and we were all sitting on the tables and fellowshipping kind of waiting for the lights to come on and brother brother joseph branham and brother billy paul branham they were sitting on a table um kind of to where we could all see them and brother joseph says he says billy tell us something about daddy tell us something about brother brown what was he like brother billy says he says i was the closest person to brother branham on earth he said i traveled around the world with him he said i was with him everywhere he went he said we talked private we drove countless hours in the car going to meetings and he said even me who knew brother branham more than anyone else even i did not know his friends from his enemies think about that the person closest to him did not even know brother branham's friends from his enemies who he liked and who he didn't like uh yeah i'm gonna give a i'm gonna give a demonstration i need a volunteer um daniel i'm not gonna pick brother lyle i'm not gonna pick brother aaron because this might come back to haunt me in later sermons from you brothers brother daniel come on come on up here let's get up let's get up here high so everybody can see you i don't think they can miss me yeah maybe i should have got somebody smaller all right okay hold that this here this tube is your mouth all right what's inside of this tube is your words all right got it everybody understand the tube is his mouth what's inside of the tube is his words all right you good open your mouth the tube [Laughter] i'll take the i'll take the cap all right all right now somebody cut you off on the road and you say a couple of choice words give it a squeeze all right oh that's a good one all right so now um you're in church and uh brother daniel evans says something that you really don't agree with i was like yeah that's a little bit brother aaron says something that you really don't agree with oh please he's a little dot um [Laughter] you get really you get upset at something that you hear that uh one of your friends says about you he this person says something about your girlfriend or something all right okay now now we have we have that now we we show the people right here all right these are my brother daniel's words okay i'm gonna give you that back now put the words back in the tube put the two toothpaste back in the tube that's not gonna work can't do it no so you can't put the two space toothpaste back in the tube and neither can you put your words back in your mouth once they come out they are out there for everybody to see you can repent for them but you can't get them back all right thanks brother those are your words man i i don't wanna do it no i'll take it it's okay and we can't friends we're in this battle together we get we have we get upset with each other but we can't let those words come out of our mouth let's um let's turn to james chapter 3. james was a pastor james was the pastor of the church in jerusalem he's probably the first real message pastor that we see in the world he was probably the first christian pastor he was the he was the head of the church in jerusalem and then the apostles peter and john and them they had other roles but james here and if you read his book he's looking after his people and he's trying to keep his people on target here james chapter 3 verse 1 my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in the word the same is a perfect man able also to bridle the whole body now the pastor is introducing correction to his congregation behold we put bits in the horse's mouths and that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they may be so great are driven of fierce winds yet they are turned about with a very small helm whether so ever the governor listed you know what he's talking about a big ship just that little rudder steers that whole ship even so the tongue is a little member and boasted great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and is set on fire of hell comparing our very words to hell we need to use caution because those people we are speaking about may have a representation up in heaven for every kind of beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we god even the father and and therewith we curse we curse we men which which are made after the similitude of god we can speak evil friends and uh we could be speaking the truth and still be speaking evil out of the same mouth perceived blessing and cursing my brother and these things ought not to be so not not not so to be that the fountains send forth the same place sweet water and bitter can a fig tree my brethren bear olive berries either a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh if you think i'm talking about somebody else i'm not i'm talking about the person wearing your shoes and my shoes and i'm speaking to myself here who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness and wisdom as you saw as you just witnessed my testimony from brother billy paul about brother branham but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace what words for my brother the pastor let's go to the book of jude i'll start with eight jude is just one chapter likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses does not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuked thee the angel michael archangel coming against this the very root of all evil this satan the accuser and here is michael and yet michael's not running him down behind his back michael's not bringing accusations against him when we bring accusations against each other against the pastor against the congregation even michael himself didn't bring an accusation against satan he was careful and how much less should we do it against each other but these speak evil of those which they do not know which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves they don't understand the whole story you know they may they may see just on the surface and it looks bad so then they go and run it down they say things as as our brother daniel here that squirts the other two but you can't get that back even when you realize you're wrong you can't get those words back these are spots there we go these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about with winds trees whose fruit wherewith without fruit twice dead and plucked up by the roots raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom has reserved the blackness of darkness forever and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints to execute judgment upon all and convince all that are ungodly among all among among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against them jude again is telling us to watch our tongue ephesians chapter 4 verse 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers again we cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube and grieve not the holy spirit whereby you're sealed until the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one another to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake has forgiven you what's sweetness that we should have i um i know that that we're going through a time in the church and going through it for some time and it's kind of building up to to to ahead and i wanted to give a testimony of some of the experiences that i've had one experience in particular is um i don't know 20 2015 or whatever it was there was an incredible turmoil in jeffersonville at the branham tabernacle and we would be in church and the church started filling up there were things going on there was there was fighting among the people there was there was fighting with the pastor with with the brand of tabernacle with voice of god recordings there was there was strife so where we were all sitting in the in the church listening to a tape we're all tape people were part of that denomination and we were listening and as brother branham would say something if it agreed with what you thought about the church amen and then over here brother branham would say something we agreed with this side amen it became an amen battle between the two with brother branham's words i know it's ridiculous but it happened and it can happen here we need to be careful so then the fighting continued and i saw and friends my wife can testify that i was sick this was a miserable time this was a miserable time for all of us with the fighting and the lack of love and the lack of understanding and saying things as i said saying things against people that have a representative up there one of god's children on both sides doing that it got to the point where the um the pastor saw that things were going to change so what do you do is took the vote out of the hands of the people we're not going to vote anymore because there's going to be some changes and he didn't say that but he said well you know i found in this quote over here that that maybe we shouldn't vote oh man this half oh you know it was really bad you know in this half just kind of okay you know it's that's good it's it's it's from brother branham and it just got to be really confusing it was it was a really hard time for all of us and the fighting that went on and eventually it kind of got resolved but not really there was too many words there was too much toothpaste that squirted out that tube and it hurt people and there was no love let me tell you this there was no love associated with those problems it was a miserable miserable time i was i was absolutely disgusted i saw how people would use somebody that maybe had a bigger mouth than than some of the other people yeah and you know that's what happens and you tell oh you tell this person well here's what we're going to do we're all going to write a letter you know and everybody send their letters in so then you have this half and they all send their letters in okay and you have all these letters and then you have all the letters and they take the letters they didn't even open they threw it right in the garbage didn't care what the people said and it was just it was a fight it was a fight everybody had one side or the other and you were forced to choose and it was i was sick i was absolutely sick seeing this politics and using different people and it eventually died down but uh i don't ever want to see something like that even on a small scale here we can't friends we are in this together and we love each other now we can't we can't stop if uh if we do nothing then nothing's going to happen all right we have to do something we have to move forward but we have to move forward in the spirit and in love i really appreciated our brother bernard frank the last morning i felt like brother bernard had the wisdom and he came here and as i was listening to him my mind was on the ministry and my mind was on the different offices in the ministry the pastor and evangelist and the teacher and i saw brother bernard but bernard's a pastor but he was acting the other morning as an apostle an apostle comes in and he says here's what you're doing here's what you need to do and here's what the word says and then he leaves it and then he goes on his way and i saw i was i was so blessed brother bernard by the things that you said i thought they were done in love and i thought they were done in wisdom and now we take what he said we are the sovereign authority here whether bernard's not brother bernard came in as an apostle and he made his suggestions now it's up to us what are we going to do and the only way that we can accomplish things is if we are together in unity and love with one another and we're not spraying the toothpaste everywhere because you can't stick it back in the tube it's out and it hurts you can repent and you can be forgiven but you still did it and we do not have the ability that god has and be able to forget it it sticks right here let's go to galatians galatians chapter 2 verse 11. paul speaking he had a disagreement with peter no they didn't agree on everything and you know what it's okay am i right brother and we may not agree on stuff but that's okay if we handle it right and we do it in love galatians 2 11. but when peter was come to antioch i was stood under the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from james james remember i said he was the pastor in jerusalem so these brothers are coming from jerusalem here a certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision fearing the jews now he was eating with the gentiles he was doing something that jews didn't do and the other jews disassembled likewise with him in so much that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimilation but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of the gentiles and not as the jews why compel us thou the gentiles to live as do the jews he's saying that these people are different you know remember what i said we're not legalists you know we are holiness but we're not legalists but see what paul paul is our example he didn't just roll over paul stood up for the word and if there's an error in the church all right whether it be in voting and doctrine or whatever that may if you really feel it on your heart then you need to address it but you need to address it in the right way don't squirt the tube of toothpaste out you go to where it needs to be addressed don't cause problems remember do everything in love no paul did that to peter now watch how much of a christian peter was let's turn to second peter ii peter i feel bad when i read second peter ii timothy because second peter is the last words of our brother peter before he was going to go to the cross before he went to the cross and he didn't even feel worthy of the lord so he said crucify me upside down and the words in this book of second peter this letter he was about to go to the cross second timothy paul is writing to timothy and he was about to go to the guillotine he was about to die so he had his closing statements in second timothy but here in ii peter peter peter says this and you can see he loves the people so much peter says this he said wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless an account that the long-suffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood paul's pretty deep he's saying yeah yeah paul's paul man he talks really deep he's sometimes he is hard to understand but he says this he says which they that are unlearned and unstable rest that word rest means wrestle those unlearned and unstable wrestle with what paul said as do also the others as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction brother wilson peter goes to far as far as right here to say that paul's words are scripture brother lyle the the sadducees or the pharisees probably swallowed those for lacqueries on there the phylacteries are those those things those boxes they put on their their heads you know i guarantee they're like what you're calling this brother paul's word scripture and this is the brother that just rebuked peter but look at the christianity in peter he's right all right and then we go on ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the heir of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory both now and forever amen peter didn't hold any grudges against paul he loved paul for that correction i'll close with first peter chapter 4. sister sister if you want to come to the piano again peter's writing he's writing for the people he's not writing to promote himself he's writing this for the people he says this but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch under prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins use hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to him to whom be praised in dominion forever and ever amen beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as them as though some strange thing happened to you we can say the same friends here don't think it's strange because we're in this situation right now whatever the situation may be it may be maybe in this church it may be a situation sister amelia that you're dealing with your family whatever that situation may be don't think it's strange that we're there brother peter if you want to come up don't think it don't think it's strange [Music] but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad with also with exceeding joy if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a bitty busybody in other man's matters yet if any man suffer as as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on on this behalf for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god friends judgment does correction begins right here and if we're not receiving correction from from church if we're if we're not getting this from the word then we just go along we need to hear these things and i was so blessed by brother bernard and he said he said many things that that i had to check myself lord am i right am i right in the way that i think and the first thing i did was go right back to this beautiful book and write back to the message that god's prophet gave us which is the same thing i did when we had the problems at the branham tabernacle i went right to the word what did brother branham say that was his church what did he say about the voting and the choosing of the pastors and the deacons and those things and friends we need to be going to those things ourselves you know what i've heard so often when we're waiting for a pastor maybe the pastor is waiting for you maybe that pastor is waiting for us everyone here to get ready we need to be ready we need to be digging into this book we need to be digging into prayer and we need to be together we need to be be together like we were sister shirley maybe before the foundation of the world maybe we fellowship [Music] and i think that if we were together then
