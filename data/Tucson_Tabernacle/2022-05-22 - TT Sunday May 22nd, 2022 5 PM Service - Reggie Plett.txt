be back in the house of the lord i i gave everybody here fair warning this morning uh and so i'm grateful to see that there was a few who decided to come back and i appreciate that you know i failed to mention we've got so many friends here in tucson and and it's just so nice to see each and every one you know the dougals have always been very special to us they've been coming up to flagstaff for so long and um i just every time i see brother and sister dougal smiling faces it just warms my heart and i feel like i'm i'm just a pre-teen all over again just a child when i look up and i see them but also my dear friend brother david fontenere and his family came this morning i was not anticipating that and i did not want to put any pressure on you brother david to do that that wasn't what i was wanting to do by letting you know i was in town i sincerely just wanted to get together at any moment you would spare us and and he's back this evening again with his family and i'm very thankful for that and i would ask i know sister sharon please let us be friends after this but i know you play you wouldn't have a song no song for us no well i still want us to be friends after this service is over so don't if we do get together please let's let it be friendly if you have your bibles and you'd like to turn with me in the bible in the book of zechariah chapter 9. my sister sarah doesn't know this but redeemer is one of my favorite songs and i was so thankful when i heard you singing that i thought oh my who is that sister sarah singing and and uh i since we first heard that song from nicole c mullen uh every time i hear that song the chills run up my back and and i think oh thank god i know my redeemer lives today and um i'm so glad that we don't just gather in a church for a dead service and and and just to get together to talk about uh dead religion or a dead god but we serve a living god who is very much alive and and and i pray very present here with us tonight before we would read maybe we could just bow our heads and start this service with the word of prayer our precious lord lord jesus you're so lovely you're so wonderful to us and lord this day god we've committed it to you lord we are believing that lord the word of god that is being ministered around the world today by believers we are believing that lord you are very present and that god you're still answering prayer that lord jesus you're you're still calling men and women uh to the light of the word of god in our day and lord i'm just thankful god to be alive to let the words come from my mouth that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever lord i pray that you would help me lord as long as i have breath in my lungs lord to be a witness of that that god you save that you heal that god you deliver that god you are a more than just a father or or a spirit that is a long way off but god you are a brother you are a friend god you are a savior and lord i would want the world to know that and i know it to be true we pray god that you would take the preeminence in this service this evening the lord you speak to our hearts and that god we would be able not perhaps just by feeling or emotion only to feel your presence here but i pray that deep down in our soul that god we would know that you spoke to us tonight this would be our desire we would just want to give you this service and lord ask that you would direct it in whichever way you would desire lord we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen zechariah 9 and verse 9 says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a cult the full of an ass amen may god had his blessing to his word you can be seated this evening this evening i have a title a message for daughters and before any of the men or boys would get up and walk out of this service um because you feel like you would have no part into this i want you to know um just to maybe engage you a little bit you men that would be here you boys that would be here um this uh is not simply just a message for uh for the female um but we realize that in in the bible a a woman is always a representative of the church and um there's many churches that are represented are represented in the word of god when god is speaking to different um different women in the bible and it's our job to rightly discern and rightly divide the word of god and so we've got to be able to divide the word of god and take our part the part that that represents us and we can apply that to our lives and then we can take the other representatives that maybe do not represent us like for instance these daughters of jerusalem would be speaking to the jewish the jews the jewish people but when we see this talking about the daughter of zion we're taught that the daughters of zion is always a representation of the bride of jesus christ and we know that that bride of jesus christ just like joseph had a bride was a gentile bride and so we've got to be able to rightly divide that so so men and and boys tonight i would tell you that that when we speak of daughters we're also speaking about boys as well so boys and girls are both included in this and and so i want you to feel uh safe that this is not just simply a message to the ladies of the church you this is not a free pass this does not give you license to get up and go play basketball um when we look at the scripture rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout out of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a cult the full of an ass this was a prophecy and this prophecy was fulfilled when jesus came riding into jerusalem upon an ass upon a cult and the people that were looking for jesus those that were looking for the messiah to come and that had recognized that jesus was the fulfillment of those scriptures they begin to rejoice and they begin to cry out and they begin to tear the palm branches off of the trees and they would lay them in the road in front of that little donkey and while jesus was riding into jerusalem on his way to the crucifixion and they began to shout and when they ran out of palms they took their coats off and they began throwing their coats in the road and they began to sing hosanna hosanna the the lord god in the highest and they begin saying these things about jesus and those that were not looking for jesus thought what is this this is strange we don't understand this why would they say this and those that perhaps knew this prophecy perhaps knew that there was to be a messiah but did not acknowledge jesus as that messiah they were even angered and they began to say keep it down and and they told jesus tell them to be quiet and he said if i if i tell them to hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out now everybody here is either a daughter is the product of a daughter is married to a daughter or is hoping to marry a daughter or has a daughter or will one day have a daughter and so this message to daughters and i will i will say this i i had a brother there at arizona believers church in phoenix helped me with these slides and so when you see the little the little emblem there that arizona believers church down there in the right hand corner just know that that there was a brother that goes to arizona believer's church to help me put this together and so also i send greetings from arizona believers church and from brother aaron mcgeary and the saints there but i want to look at this scripture in genesis chapter one and again we we we touched on it this morning a little bit and i just want to maybe bring it right back up to speed because i told you that that service this morning would would lead or tie right into this service this evening and so when we look at genesis chapter 1 and verse 27 it says so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them so this is when god first created man or what the i believe that's the hebrew word adam which actually speaks of mankind adam the first man and we find uh genesis tells us here that when god created this man male and female created he them this one being was both male and female in one one form and so consequently we see that when god formed the first man and we think of him as adam he also created himself his his daughter his first daughter and later he separates that spirit and he cr he pulls from adam a rib and he forms himself another body and adam calls that woman for she came from man and so she was called woman and later after she gives birth he's she is given a name eve the mother of all living but when god first created this being it was both a male and female it was a spirit being adam now uh we're living in such a strange time in this dark age that the world would like to take that and and we've seen how they love have loved twisting you know men being women and women being men and and and and or pick whatever you would like to be a toaster or an animal or whatever you'd like but but this is just the pure word of god and that's what we're looking at we don't want to get wrapped up in what the world is is trying to mimic from god but when god created man he created him a son and when he gave him his son a wife god was gaining himself a daughter he'd gotten for himself a daughter and in genesis chapter 2 and verse 18 it says the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him and help meet for him so as i said this morning we see that after each day that god was creating after he'd created the light and and separated the darkness from the light and he called the the the light day and the darkness night and after each day that god goes through the creation he says it is good it is good it is good and at the end he says it is very good but now we see in chapter 2 the lord saying it is not good it is not good that the man should be alone i'll make him and help me for him and i would say this that as i'm presenting this sermon tonight to the church to the daughters of god i would also when these when i'm looking in these scriptures and i'm seeing the things that the prophet of god is saying in my mind and in my heart i'm also thinking what what could i say that i would want my daughters my daughters to know something that would benefit my own daughters so i've got i'm the father of of two daughters and two sons my daughters being the the eldest and so they'll probably exit the home first we don't know i we don't know dad may hold him back but um what what would i want my daughters to know what can my daughters draw from the word of god and what could i say that i would want to encourage my daughters in and when i see here that god said it's not good that man should be alone god is only reflecting something that's within him that perhaps god sees it was not good for him to be alone and therefore we see when god first created one of the first things he created was the angels and that was to gain worship so that there would be worship but but more specifically and more intimately god desired a family and so now we see not just angels but mankind coming into the picture and this mankind coming into this picture for fellowship and i remember i think it was my father-in-law maybe you all know him for the gerald hughes he's a pastor and i remember him using this example and i it always stood out to me and he said you know i believe that we can look into the message of the hour and through the stories and or the life that brother branham lived we can draw examples for for the believer and i say amen to that and then he demonstrated something he pulled a story and i thought boy that is that's really striking and i thought i really like that and i feel like it's applicable so i'll share it with you the story he he presented to me was the story that when when brother branham uh had uh i guess disobeyed god if you would um he god had desired for him to go into minister to the to uh the pentecostal people and uh his mother-in-law said you you're not taking my daughter to that bunch of trash and and he didn't and we know what happened the flood came and his his wife sister hope got sick and and she said to him while she was sick on that bed billy you know where we went wrong don't you and he said yes i do she said we should never listen to mama and she said you go you go preach to those people you go preach this message to those people and she passes away and and he's the the tragedy of losing his wife is just overwhelming but he's because of the emergency of the flood that's happening he's continually having to work it was just i think from my best understanding it was just a matter of days and he gets the call maybe it was hours your daughter's dying your daughter sharon's dying so he rushes to the hospital and i believe it was brother sam adair the doctor who said billy you can't go in there you you know she's got i think tb or something and and you could contract that and then and then you're going to be around billy paul and then he could get that and get sick and die you can't go in there and he he he seems to somewhat agree and as soon as sam turns he goes in he goes in to see sharon anyway and and he you know the story every time i you hear it it just breaks your heart you just can't help but just we that she's suffering so hard the flies are he said the blowflies are in her face and her eyes are crossed from the suffering so hard and then he sees that sheep drop down that god wouldn't answer his prayer even and how the devil came and even whispered how could how could you love god and how could you say god loves you and he loses his daughter and after losing his daughter the tragedy is so great each i believe each person when they hear that story your heart just breaks and you think oh god how could that how could a man live and that's the question brother branham was asking himself with my wife gone and my daughter gone what's the point of living so he goes home and he gets a pistol and he that pistol back and he tries with everything he can to take his own life and the gun will not go off and he throws the gun down and it goes off and he then he's praying to god you won't even let me take my own life and he's at work then i don't know if days weeks later months i'm not sure but he's up on that power line and he sees the shadow and it looks like the cross and he just thinks lord just let me go home and he goes to grab that 10 000 volt line and he just wakes up at the base of that power line and the story that was demonstrated to me was when you hear a story like that and you think what's the why would god do that why would god allow that and and when my father demonstrated the story he said notice he was so lonely without his wife and his baby what was the point of living and god god desired that we were to have somebody that adam it was not good that he be alone and god desired a family so much that the prophet of god in the church age book said that the very heart purpose the sole purpose of god's existence was to have a bride of his own choosing was a family was to have sons and daughters that is the very purpose of god's existence and so when i look and i i i realize that that i'm jumping all the way to the end into the punch line but the very purpose of this message is a message for daughters here it is from the smyrnian church age the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world sometimes we ask the question why am i here what's the purpose of my existence and you should be asking the question what's the purpose of god's existence it's you you are his purpose i put this scripture here because i've got a story behind it but i've only highlighted the second half of this scripture ruth 4 15 for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath borne him i remember i hope you don't mind me sharing a purse some personal stories with you and i hope my family isn't too terribly embarrassed by me telling personal stories they should be used to it by now but i remember when sister grace and i were found interest in each other and and we were uh both had the same the same goal the same mindset to serve the lord with all with everything that was within us and that we weren't um neither one of us were looking to at the stage in life that we were the age we were to just have a friendly relationship and just a cordial boyfriend girlfriend sort of thing we both had agreed that if we were to enter into uh any sort of a relationship it would be for the intent the sole intent of marriage that we didn't want to we didn't want to we didn't want to go a long way of trying to figure that out we just if we're doing this is what we're going for and so we would she being in south carolina and i'm here in arizona two thousand miles distance and back then uh cell phones were hardly a thing that existed that's not true but for us they were my dad had one i think in a bag in his truck but you they were like a hundred dollars a minute or something like that but anyways we didn't we had cell phones but they were very old and so we didn't talk in in even when we did wanted to talk her her father my father-in-law uh decided once a week for 30 minutes that could be your phone time and so we resorted to a lot of letter writing and and emails the best that we could but we would be praying lord are we meant to be are we meant to be married god we want your perfect will show us in the word show us when we're listening to the tapes god speak to us to confirm that we are meant to be married we would we would pray diligently and seek god and and of course every message i'm picking out is love and anything to do the kinsmen redeemer and anything that had to do with a man and a woman getting married those were the ones i was going to listen to first and it was like and i felt like i'd already it been confirmed to me she's supposed to be your wife and and i would ask her well how do you feel what is the lord showing you i believe we're meant to be together and i remember thinking well lord what why doesn't her dad get it god opened his eyes and and i guess being young and and naive i don't want to use the word dumb in front of our children but really it's really what it was but i just you know being young and maybe arrogant or something i didn't feel like i was but maybe that's what it was i don't know it's real easy to do that once you're older but you know i'm thinking why would he why would he not want to just hand his daughter right over to me i mean what is his problem why can't he just you know and and the idea the dream for every young man that's that's grown up sleeping under these pews here in the a message believing church every dream of every young man is the idea that he's going to go to his future father-in-law the man that he's daughter he's dating the daughter and he's just gonna walk up to her to that man and he's just gonna say you can have him bill you can have her you can have her bill and but you know changing out the name you can have a reg oh thank you of course we're the chums right but that's not how it works most of the time i didn't work for me and the end story is we ended up getting married i don't know if you knew the happy ending but we were married and it worked out well then it came time where we found out we're gonna have a child our first child we're gonna have a child well i was so excited you know and the thought to me was this is so great i i mean do i start buying the footballs now you know the baseball glove because me and my son we're gonna go and do this and then week i think 20 comes along and and they say oh you got to go to the doctor and find out what you're having and it was a human and and i'm going oh yeah well of course let's go to the doctor and hear him say it's a boy let's just go let's just say yeah that's what we're gonna go and congratulations you're going to have a daughter and i thought what no that's not how that's supposed to work it's a boy what do i what i don't what do i have use of what use do i have of a daughter what do you do with a daughter i don't even know what they can't hardly catch you know i i just don't how is this gonna work out and i was so taken back and i think even my wife noticed it and was like you're not happy and i was like no i am of course i'm happy i'm happy and i'm trying to you know convince myself that i am happy and then we had our daughter and the doctors you know it's traumatic experience for any man to be there just warning any men that have not been it's very traumatic and they take the baby over to here and they're sucking the you know to stuff out of its mouth to get it and it's and you want to come and hold your daughter and you're hey yeah yeah you go over and here is this little tiny bundle of joy and the second they put that baby in my hands there's this magic invisible lasso that daughters have and they wrap it right around the heart of dad and it's daddy's girl and immediately immediately i thought of my father-in-law and i thought now i understand why he wouldn't just hand his daughter right over to me and say here you go you know just she's all yours and it all became clear to me what that whole responsibility of being a dad to his daughter was and when i read this scripture for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee is better to thee than seven sons hath borne him i will be honest if you'd asked me if you were if i was writing the book of reg 415 b would say a dozen sons i wouldn't have traded 12 boys for the one girl that i had i wouldn't have traded it that one girl was meant more to me than if i'd had 12 boys now this is from the message the kinsman redeemer i should maybe hide that so you can't see that but i want to tell you there's a there is a difference between boys and girls when you have sons and daughters and with sons i remember our oldest son isaiah i i can promise you he'd never seen any anything any any sort of a cartoon anything uh he hadn't watched any hunting programs with dad or i promise nothing and i can remember when he was just a few months old him picking up a hanger on our bed and aiming that hanger and going and i thought how does he know that how does he how does he put that together the hangar and the arrow and shooting how does he know that none of my daughters ever did that they never did it they never they may have danced with a hanger but they did not use the hanger like a gun or or a bow and arrow and i say that to say this when when when you have your boys and you go to church and you raise them up in church and you ask the boys who's your favorite bible character the answers are almost always the same david sampson shamgar anybody that kills philistines anybody that'll kill a philistine that's a boy's favorite character jesus moses boys i know my bible jesus wasn't killing philistines i'm just saying those are the typical answers that is given by boys but when you have daughters the answers are usually always the same girls who's your favorite bible character esther ruth mary sarah rebecca those are typically the ant those are the answers you get from daughters well it always seems the girls always seem to say things like i think it's unfair i think there's more examples for the boys in the bible than there is girls i say well just enjoy the examples that are given in in there and i want to look at what brother branham says here in the kinsman redeemer and he speaks of of two of those characters ruth and rebecca and he nails both at the same time and you'll find there's many many times brother branham does mention rebecca and he and he uses the same example concerning rebecca but let's notice what he says here in the kinsman redeemer well lord if you'll just bless me and do this for me i'll do so and so that's not a decision now he's speaking as if that would be us well lord if you'll just bless me and do this for me i'll do so and so that's not a decision god i don't care what you do with me i'll go anyhow if i die all right live or die whatever if they laugh at me make fun of me don't make any difference i'll go anyhow that's clean cut decision like rebecca made before she even seen isaac remember she'd never seen isaac but she'd heard from a messenger all about isaac and when she was asked the question will you go be married to this man you've never seen she real quickly they said look let's not ask let's let's ask the girl herself will you go be married to this man and real quickly the bible says quit quickly she said i'll go. and brother branham is saying i like that i like that when the when the when the uh opportunity is presented for a believer will you serve this jesus christ that you've heard so much about will this this jesus be your lord will he be your savior he says i like when a christian when a believer can make a clean cut decision and say i'll go i'll serve him her parents said let the girl answer the girl she is of age let her answer she said i'll go clean cut decision quickly she made she claimed to it that's what ruth did orpah went back they journeyed on ruth in her heart not knowing where she was going but a type of the church we sojourn like abraham pilgrims in a strange land among strange people and i say i i brought this out for for this purpose i'm so thankful when my when my daughters say my favorite story is is esther my favorite story is ruth i like ruth well then i want to prod a little bit and say well why what about him what well i like that brother branham says what i like about s or what i like about ruth and what i like about rebecca was the clean-cut decision they made i'm gonna break this lamp by the end of this service i'll back up they made a clean-cut decision i'll go ruth ruth said i'll go where you go i'll go let your people be my people your god my god where you die i wanna die there do not let me separate from you naomi and as a father with two daughters there's nothing there's i should i say one of the things that i a lesson a deci something that i want my daughters to have in their life is a clean cut decision for jesus christ not because mom does not because dad does but them themselves make that decision i will live i choose to be a christian i choose that that's that's the first step we want for believers is don't do this wishy-washy thing of today on sundays and wednesdays i'll serve jesus but give me my mondays tuesdays thursdays fridays and saturdays that i can go and live in the world no no that's not that's not a healthy relationship you know brother branham said one time many people will choose will will choose jesus christ as their savior but very few will receive him as lord and lord is a lordship over you is him having having the preeminence the having him having the control in a man or a woman's life a surrendered life to christ there's a story there's a couple stories in the bible and there's one story that i think is used more than any other story in the message of the hour and that is the story of the woman at the well and it's it's a story that's used i believe probably more times than any in the message of the hour for for the purpose of demonstrating the sign of the messiah because we recognize that the same god that was able to tell nathanael that thou art a a an israelite in whom there is no guile and and nathanael said how do you know me he said i saw you before philip called you i saw you praying under the tree and nathanael knowing that that was miles away that jesus himself was not physically there how could he see that but that through a vision god showed him nathanael and then we we we see also him doing this to simon to to peter calling him simon thou art simon the son of jonas and and and him using this on to the jews demonstrating the sign of the messiah and then we see it with this woman the samaritan at the well and how that he begins talking with her to catch her spirit and we realize that once he catches her spirit he he identifies a problem in her life and that problem in her life was a marital problem and he tells her about this marital problem and when he begins to spell out to her this marital problem she recognizes that this must be now if you take your scriptures and you will run it back she says thou thou must be a prophet but brother branham points out and you can you can discover this yourself if you'll take the hebrew and you'll take that reference it's not a prophet but the prophet thou art that prophet and that prophet is a reference back to deuteronomy where god says to moses that i will raise up a prophet like unto thee moses and him shall the people hear and this was the first this was the prophecy of the messiah and the jews recognized that they recognize that that is a reference to the messiah well this samaritan is using that reference of that prophet that that messiah and jesus says i am he that speaks to you now we see that that that that example is used because of the sign of the messiah but what we what i would like to recognize and brother branham points this out when he is talking about the representation or the seed gene of god that is in a man or a woman that was placed that god had before the foundation of the world you can discover this in ephesians chapter one the predestination and foreknowledge of god and that before the foundation of the world god put your name on a book and so before the foundation of the world god had representation of you you had representation in god and then god sowed that seed and that seed through generations how brother branham talks about how that god foreordained that your great-grandparents your grandparents your parents would would all come together to form you and that god desired that in you there would be one of those seed genes he talks about that representation and he just happens to say that this woman at the well had one of those seed jeans inside of her and he said now look at the priest the priest's life that was there in that city his life was so clean he followed the laws that were written by moses and david he followed those laws to a t to where you couldn't put a finger on his life but his heart was as black as the smutty walls of hell but this woman whose life seemed to be tarnished seemed to be ruined her outside condition seemed to be black as the smutty walls of hell yet in her heart it was pure it was clean and it had one of those seed gene representations in her heart so that when the word of god spoke to her and said i am that messiah and begin to tell her the very things in her life she recognized this is of god and when she recognized that he said i come to give you water that you can't draw from this well but i'll give you waters of life springing up from inside of you and these are waters of eternal life she believed his words she believed what he was saying was true and when she believed it and received it for herself she was manifesting that she was a daughter of god all along we see the same in mary magdalene we we see these examples throughout the bible when you see these women whose lives seem to be tarnished yet they were willing to to receive the word of god in their life so as we look through these characters in the bible these different daughters that are spoken of in the bible they're placed there to draw our attention for the church to identify the church to identify the bride but before we can identify the church we must properly identify the bridegroom and if we can properly identify in the word of god the bridegroom then then we can properly place the bride in her place because she does have a position but if we only focus on the position of the bride and we we fail to properly identify the bride groom and put him in his rightful place we will we will run off into a tangent and run off on a bunny trail and we'll draw worship away from god and that is what satan desired at the beginning satan the most beautiful of all the cherubims desired uh does his his end desire was to receive the very worship that was due to god and the way he could do that was to first draw the worship away from god and then through time that worship in turn could be turned and he could pull that worship and attention to himself that's a sermon in itself we're not going to go there but i'm but something that even though i'm i'm i'm preaching a sermon here about a message to daughters we must always remember that when identifying the daughters and when recognizing who we are in the word of god we must first recognize who he is and give him the preeminence now there's not only characters in the bible that we would desire our daughters to identify with these esthers these ruths these rebeccas these marys this woman at the well we we we we like that our daughters would identify but the scripture is also it gives us enough examples of daughters that we we that are are clearly put in the scripture to be examples of what we don't want our daughters to be and i think it's good to have that balance if we just simply said now you need to be like that you need to be like that you need to be like that well what do they not need to be that might help that law of contrast might help clarify what they ought to be and so we look at characters like jezebel and we see that jezebel also had a daughter named athaliah that's how i pronounce it if you like to pronounce it another way atholize how i pronounce it and jezebel being married to ahab jezebel brought idolatry into the ten tribes of israel now the two tribes of that were of judah they stayed clean and they had a king jehoshaphat and he was always when ahab would say we should join forces we should join forces jehoshaphat would say well have we consulted god about this have we consulted we should consult god about this and he was very he was very uh word oriented and seeking the will of god jehoshaphat well jehoshaphat had a son jehoram and this was very common that nations would would would intermarry to strengthen relationships help strengthen nations themselves and jehoshaphat's son jehoram ended up marrying ahab and jezebel's daughter athaliah and when he did the same idolatry that jezebel brought into israel athaliah brought it into judah there's a real beautiful picture of that in the church age book brother branham talks about this and he brings it in and it's very rich and very full and i would encourage you to go and and and seek that out but for the sake of time i want to move on another daughter that we see is herodias and her daughter now herodias if we if you'll remember this is in the new testament now we see her uh in a an unlawful union with i don't remember if it was herod and john the baptist is crying out against it this is wrong this is wrong this is wrong and herodias gets her daughter to go dance before this king and he says if you if you'll dance i'll give you whatever you want so then she dances and it pleases the king so much he says what is it that you want and she talks to her mother and she says i want the head of john the baptist on a platter now i think any fathers in here i think you would say i don't want my daughter to be like that that is not what i want my daughter to be we read in revelations chapter 17 about this woman called mystery babylon and the bible calls her a great and it said that she was a daughter that she had daughters she was the mother of harlots so we see her daughters following right in the same line as the mother now these are the examples that we could set before our daughters that i would set before my daughters and say now this if we look at this these scriptural examples i don't want you to end up like this and so contrarily i would want you to be like somebody like esther and what we're seeing is in in in the life of jezebel and ethelia and herodias her daughter in and this mystery babylon and her daughters is this unholiness it was very unholy ungodly ungodliness and when we read a scripture in isaiah chapter 3 and verse 16 it says moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet it paints a pretty vivid picture in our mind that oh my this is so ungodly and immediately when i read this scripture and i get to that part of mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet i'm immediately drawn to a story brother branham tells about his mother who had a dream i believe it was his mother that had this dream and she saw this he saw this woman maybe it was brother brandon they had this he saw this woman and she's walking along and she's wearing high heels and she's claiming to be the church and she's walking with high heels and she begins and says she's mincing as she goes and he says that's what high heels do they cause a woman to mince he says she's mincing as she's going and she's climbing this hill and as she's climbing this hill the the path gets narrower and narrower and she's and this woman can is is convinced and says i can walk that i can walk it and as she's walking it and the path gets narrower because of her mincing in those heels she can't walk it and she falls off these cliffs into hell and so now we've got this image and and when you hear something like that immediately i'm running home and i'm telling my daughters no high heels whatever we do give me give me your shoes we're chopping we're chopping we gotta stay like whatever you do stay away from that image and so the thing one again one of the things that i would desire a message that i would want for my daughters is a message of holiness is a message of clean living to be clean and i believe when when we approach the subject of holiness when the world thinks as soon as you use that word we're taught you're talking about a dress code holiness because you can go amongst the baptists and the pentecostals the charismatics and when you say oh they believe in holiness they know that really what you're saying is a dress code a way of dressing and i believe that we have been taught scripturally that holiness is a way of life and that when you even look at the word holiness it comes from the same word as sanctification and that sanctification is to be clean and set aside for service to be used in service but it's to it's come out and be separate it's that separation from worldliness now that that applies to a dress code and brother branham says don't ever quit preaching that but it starts with a life style and i believe that in holiness if the life and the the heart of my daughters and the heart of the daughters of zion if their heart if their necks are not stretched out and they're and and they're not walking in haughtiness with wanton eyes you won't have to worry about the dress it follows a life and i like to use the contrast from these examples of these women whose lifestyles was ungodly and and and we can see in jezebel it reflected also in her being the only woman in the bible to put makeup on her face and that makeup she put on her face was to meet a man jehu it was to please him it was to please jehu but when we see this the contrast in my opinion is esther the story of esther and you'll find in the story of esther that when she when when when king ahasuerus puts away vashti from being queen and he calls for all the young maidens of the land to come and who will be the next queen and it comes to this point where he's going to call each of these girls in before his presence and and he's going to they're each going to try to find and win favor with the king well when it comes time for esther to come before the king they call her up and they say esther it's your time to go before the king she goes to the chamberlain she goes to the king's messenger and she goes before him and she asks him you tell me what i should wear before the king her desire was not well i think he'll be pleased with this well i believe he'll like this she didn't even bother with that she went to somebody that knew the king and she said you tell me what would please the king and whence when she dressed in the apparel that the chamberlain suggested that she wear and she went before the king the scripture declares that she found favor before the king and i just love that story because for my daughters i've told them this and i tell all the young people that i can when when they when they want to know the testimony and they want to know about uh serving god and and how do you know when god is calling you in and and know all these things that are in my life that are pulling in my life music and and and whatever else it would be i always my answer is always this you fall in love with jesus christ i mean head over heels in love with jesus christ and when you do that it'll take care of all of the rest that's which which is exactly what jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you but i tell you fall in love with him fall in love with jesus to where you just can't do without your bible you just couldn't live without you know any sort of involvement you want you want god to be a part of it when you can fall in love with him then everything else in your life it'll lie now the music the whatever issues that you would think that you've got the other cares of life they'll go away or they'll fall in line second corinthians chapter 6 says and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty so as i said this morning i i would i would always want to preach something that will that we can walk in tomorrow or tuesday like we walk in it on a sunday we can walk in it on friday night as if we're walking in it sunday morning and i use the word practical purpose i believe that the gospel should have practical purpose in our lives and that's my desire for my household for my children is that this isn't uh uh a message that my daughters can never attain to just you gotta you gotta get a little bit higher we i call it the golden carrot and i think you've probably heard me mention that before it's where you put that stick and that carrot right in front of the donkey and it just keeps him going forward and he's constantly trying to eat that carrot but he can't ever get to it because it's tied to a stick and it's always before but it's it's this thing that's constantly if you just come up a little bit higher no no no a little bit hot no higher no a little bit higher and you can never attain to that and i believe that god came in this hour that god sent us a message that brings practical purpose to the believer that the church for too long was shrouded in this you can never attain you can never attain oh if only you could if only you could see what i'm seeing if only you could see what i'm seeing and the believers going when am i ever going to see what you're seeing i believe god sent a prophet to say let's look into this do you see what i'm seeing i believe you are i believe you do so when we look at this practical purpose i'm coming to a close i want to i want to read to you something that's in the questions and answers and i believe that it speaks to our practical everyday life this is in questions and answers number three in 1964. the question is asked would you please explain first corinthians chapter 7 verse 1 and 9. and brother branham when he goes to read the scripture he asks brother neville can you grab that scripture and and then he all he reads is verse 9. this is all he reads but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn brother brahm says all right that's just for the dirty living instead of a man a boy girl or something or another when they're going together and they know that they should be married go ahead and get married i think you'd understand what i mean don't you see so i think we understand what he's saying here too that's for the that's that's for uh the ungodly the for the dirty that's just for dirty living instead of just living a dirty life you should just get married don't just live a dirty little life there because it's not right you see that's your sister in one sense where if you're a christian now if it's the world it's the world dog eat dog but this girl that you're going with that's your sister too that will be the mother of your children that will come don't live a dirty little life around her show that you're a real christian gentleman live like a christian gentleman ought to see and treat her like your sister and when you get married still treat her that way and you women live the right way to your husband and you husbands live the right way to your wives be real real nice and respect one another just with and your family relations and so forth like that let it be just as reverently and godly and agreed with among you and everything as it can be don't never push and shove and be dirty and vulgar i'd like to invite the musicians to come at this time now i've hided lighted this part but look what he says here understand talk to your wife if one nature is to you and another nature to her talk it with her so now we're right back to the genesis account you've got one nature men and she's got another nature you don't have the same you have different natures and we've got to try to understand that husbands and wives we have to try to work that out it was real easy for me to say surely i'm not going to have a daughter what do you do with daughters i'm only going to have sons that's the only possibility that there is for me well god knew better and when i got a daughter i couldn't treat her like a son she was a daughter she had a different kind of a nature and it was up to me to figure that out to understand the nature difference and we want to be like that remember this morning the value of the spoken word we want to put that into practical purpose in our own homes talk it with her you try to do the same thing to him sister and the same way understand one another and be real christian gentlemen and real christian ladies and brother and sister with one another always remember you're god's children and you're from a royal family you're a royal blood there's no better blood in the world than yours that's right and a royal blood shows itself that's what it is it's royal all believe that say amen yes sir show what you are i'm a son of a king i'm the son of the king my wife's a daughter of a king how would i treat that king's daughter how would she treat that king's son see what i mean be real genuine that's one more thing that i would want to be a message for my daughters be real genuine a real christian genuine brother aaron said as we were dismissing this afternoon did you hear him he called you sons and daughters of god something like that that's what he just said you are a son of a king you are the daughter of a king now if you'll notice the scripture in zechariah 9 9 says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee now if you were just a bystander just somebody was a part of the kingdom and the king was coming you'd rejoice because that would be your king but when that king is your dad that's a different feeling altogether that's a different relationship altogether when this says thy king cometh that's your dad sisters girls you're a daughter of a king and you want to know why those people could rejoice like they were when jesus was riding in their king their dad was coming into jerusalem now in the message what is the attraction on the mountain it's the only message that i could find where brother branham takes the scripture of zechariah 9 9 and he expounds on it he's the only one i could find now i could stand corrected and i'd be happy to but it was the only message i could find where he expounded on that scripture and and just think of the the title of the sermon what is the attraction on the mountain and it's talking about how that jesus was up on the mount of olives and how that he was crying out the very same words that david cried out joel jerusalem jerusalem i why why has suffered i would have how oft would i have hovered thee as a mother in with her brood and he's crying out these things and this scripture through the prophet of zechariah the prophecy comes forth rejoiced thy king cometh to thee he's coming riding upon a cult he's coming on a donkey riding unto you and the people that caught it how they begin to rejoice our king is come this is the great king and he was their daddy too he was their daddy and in this message what is the attraction on the mountain brother branham is demonstrating what was the attraction that these people were attracted to it was they were recognizing those people that were shouting hosanna were recognizing that the word of god that which had already been spoken was coming to pass at that moment that this is sensational what is happening right now scripture that has been spoken hundreds of years ago is coming to pass and i'm in the picture i'm part of it it's so you can imagine then the heightened reality and the excitement that the people that could recognize that were feeling at that moment brother branham at the end of that message and he and he's and he goes down through history and he shows you know what was the attraction uh uh on the mountain with moses well it was the people recognizing god scumming and speaking to them and being a deliverer and calling them out and he goes through and he's talking about throughout the bible history what was the attraction that drew the men and women of god it was the word of god coming to pass and brother branham then at the end he says this same prophet who spoke of the first coming of jesus christ speaks to us of the second coming and he points us over into zechariah chapter now brother branham starts at verse 4 and he reads down to verse 9. i'm going to read simply verses the second half of 5b to 7 and it's how can we what is the attraction that is attracting us believers today what is the attraction that's attracting us mother branham as we read this together and the lord my god shall come and all the saints with thee and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light brother branham begins to point out this is the evening time we're in the last of the gentile church ages and it is at the time of the last church age that the second coming of god will come it's at the end of that seventh church age it shall not be light nor dark it's an evening time but it shall be light in the evening time and we as believers when we read that scripture and we read those verses and when we hear the message of the hour we begin to recognize that this is the evening time and that the very next thing that we are looking for is the second coming of the lord that's what is attracting us to this message that's what attracts us to the word of god is the anticipation and that that promise that has been in the scripture that one day there's a the lord is coming again to get a bride [Music] the same the same the same prophecy and the same prophet who says rejoice o daughters of zion your king's coming unto you he tells us believers at the end time that we too can rejoice tonight because we're living in the final days before the coming of the lord and if we can keep the anticipation and looking for the coming of the lord one of these days will be a part of that in the end time evangelism brother branham says this and this is my last slide now we're going to end right here by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture that would be my message for my daughters that girls all these things that that daddy's been preaching all these things that daddy and mommy have been pointing to and and doing our best to live for is to point you to that event called the rapture we want you to be ready for that we want you to be ready now it's true from the time they're very little the girls they love putting on these long gowns and playing wedding like this is the day of the wedding and who's gonna be and they have to grab cousins and whoever else to be the bridegroom and they're going to play with whoever they can get the cat or whoever is going to be the groom but they're going to do a wedding and it's something that you look forward to as a father that oh one day you know my daughter and you know walking down that aisle and you know my daughter happy my daughter living happy with that but ultimately as believers it is only a small fraction of what we're desiring and that is that marriage supper where there is that union with the real bride of the real bridegroom jesus christ that's what we're living for that's what i want from my daughters i believe that this message this message the message of the hour is a message for daughters of god [Music] and i i'm happy to be represented in that as a man i can tell you that i'm happy when i read about these these women in the bible who are willing to make clean-cut decisions who are willing to to be like esther and do only that which would please the king it's just when i read those things it's my heart that cries out as a man oh god let me be that let me be that i i i love the stories of the ox goat and and the acts of faith you know overcoming the enemy and wiping out the enemy but i don't want i don't want great exploits done in my life [Music] if all it does is point to me i want whatever i'm doing whatever happens in my life if if there's any testimony to be given if there's any glory to be given let that glory be to jesus christ and it's these daughters that give such a clear representation of that when we read our bibles church i would tell you this is a message for daughters whether that's the daughters of jerusalem or the daughters of zion you rightly divide the word of god for yourself and you find yourself in the word of god when you when you see that that is a representation of everything that is within you that is crying out you hold on to that believe god for it let us stand together [Music] as we bow our heads in prayer now is that opportunity when we can see the heart purpose of god his very existence is to have a bride of his own choosing that that the whole purpose of this message was you a relationship with you that you were in him in the beginning and that when god pulled you from his bosom [Music] you were always a part of him and it was not good that he would be alone and though the voice that we want to hear the only voice we want to hear is the voice of our beloved jesus christ speaking to us i want to let you know that his desire is to hear your voice is to hear you to have a relationship to hear you talk back to him when he demonstrates his love for us i think it would only be right for us to express back to him we love you lord thank you lord we worship you lord we give you praise god lord we surrender again god take all of me oh daddy abba father he wants us to he wants to hear us it's not a this was not a bible written as a monologue but this was a dialogue this was a message for the daughters of zion to rejoice to go ahead and proclaim with your lips go ahead and use the spoken word to praise jesus christ to give him glory to give him honor to give him the preeminence and i believe that if we can begin to express by spoken word the thanksgiving with our lips the sacrifice of thanksgiving i believe it would go before god as the sacrifice and the offering that abel offered there at the east part of eden so i would encourage you and i would invite you as we pray tonight that you would use the spoken word to give him the praise he deserves heavenly father lord thank you for this message lord thank you that you've called sons and daughters lord we thank you that you not only sent your spirit to be with us and to speak to us but you said that you would be in us that god you would walk within us and that god you would be god within us and that we could be called sons and daughters and that you would call us unto yourself lord as you've called these men and these women sitting here in this place lord we want to be sure to give you praise for what you've done in our lives lord we're so thankful to be called sons and daughters of god and lord we would pray that those that are hearing this fresh for the first time in their life or lord perhaps they're familiar with it but they've they've never really received that for themselves i pray god tonight if they would say tonight i believe that and i will receive that for me i believe lord jesus if we could surrender lord those that would be fresh and new to this that lord when they examine the word of god and they see that it's the truth and they would open their heart and say i desire to be called a son of god i desire to be called a daughter of god lord i pray that you would not disappoint but that once again lord you would fill them and grant them over and abundantly what they could ask or think [Music] lord i pray that those that would not know the baptism of the holy ghost that god tonight they could experience that baptism and they could know what it is to have that separation and to know what it is to live in holiness that they could live a life without the wiles of the world they could live a life without the traps and lord without with without the influence and addiction of alcohol or or or or or nicotine or or or or lord that even uh god's social media and and and and hollywood and and the thirst for the things of the world god you can take those desires out like you've done so many times before and you can fill that place with the love of god [Music] and lord not just the love of god but that there would be a love for god the lord that that place that we used to go to when we would say i can't lay it down i can't seem to get rid of this one day we woke up and said you know i have no more desire for that but only to please the father god i pray that you would grant that to every man woman boy and girl in this place lord jesus i pray tonight that as you bring this message for your daughters the message of this hour for the daughters of zion i pray lord god that you would make our homes better homes you would make our relationships better relationships that husbands and wives could be real genuine [Music] that children and parents could be real genuine they could talk they could understand one another lord as they begin to desire to only only seek out the word of god for their lives and the will of god for their lives i pray god that you would transform the homes that you would transform the church that you would transform our communities and our neighborhoods god you would change our job sites lord you would transform the phone conversations we would have [Music] that lord we could be an encouragement to another man or another woman that may not know that they are a son and daughter of god i pray that god you'd grant it that you'd use each vessel here lord that they would be able to use the spoken word to be an encouragement and to be a a appointing to the word of god and to jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever grant this i pray in jesus christ's name amen be like jesus [Music] to be like jesus on earth i long just to be like him [Music] and all through life's journey from earth to glory [Music] i only ask just to be like him one more time oh to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth thy lord to be like him and all through life's journey from earth to glory i only [Music] be like him that song i have a maker [Music] i have a maker a form my heart before even time began my life was in his hand does he know your name tonight oh he knows my name and he knows my every thought oh he sees each tear that falls and he hears me when i call now listen to this next verse oh i have a fall o rejoice church he calls me his son oh he'll never

him so well he had ordered a salad at the place there and didn't really pay attention and then he was waiting for his salad but i thought he wanted a salad plate so i said get the salad plate and he filled himself up with a salad and about halfway through the salad they delivered his plate full of salad but you did all right didn't you you know a god that cares for us he really does and as of course he's talking about girls and i don't know nothing about that um but i do remember the day naomi was born and i held her in my arms for the first time i had to be the proudest daddy there was there's just there just was nothing better we never had a boy's name that we agreed on i wanted benjamin aaron she wanted aaron joseph never happened but we had girls names you know but i hope you to mine for a couple moments here mama would say go ask your daddy why not when they would have a question especially as they got into their teenage years and they would say daddy mom said to ask you why this and this and my answer was because you didn't know your daddy when he was teenaged you got to know your daddy later we all go through this life of growing up but the grace of god never leaves his children but i told my wife coming this way i don't know what brought up the subject but i said how can these this royal family speak speaking especially of of england and all that's going on with possibility of the queen passing away and i thought who would want to live under all that and when he was preaching the answer came if you're of royal bloodline that's who you are [Music] how many are

it was brother evil frank that was visiting jeff jeffersonville and staying with brother branham's neighbor at the house there and he was going to get the opportunity to to meet brother branham and i believe it was sister woods that lived next to brother brother branham one of the neighbors there she had made a pie and she said i'm going to take this over to brother bill because they called him brother bill so she takes a pie over and and when he come she comes back the brother asked her and what was the prophet of god doing when you got there and you have this thought he was you know receiving visions from heaven and revelations and all and she told him he had his the apron on and he was helping sister meaty wash the dishes [Music] uh you know a perfect do you realize a man in love with his wife would do something like that and he became me so that i could become like him because he loved us loved us so much he took on flesh he walked us and he said i understand how you're feeling brother loyal i've gone through that myself brother eddie i understand that because i've been there daddy looks at his daughters and says oh if a man ever looked at my daughter and thought of

him by grace and he took my place so that i'll his love could take him he became me so that i might become him by grace [Music] by this shall all men know you are my disciples when you have love one
