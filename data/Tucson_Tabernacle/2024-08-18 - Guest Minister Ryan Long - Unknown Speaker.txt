[53:57] morning to me it's not just a song it's
[54:00] not just lyrics written it's by cry to
[54:03] the Lord this morning Lord whatever it
[54:05] takes to get me ready whatever it takes
[54:07] to to prepare me Lord would you do it
[54:10] this morning Lord I I just I don't want
[54:12] to play games anymore I don't want to
[54:14] mess around I just want to be
[54:16] surrendered to him I want to be prepared
[54:18] by him how many feel the same this
[54:20] morning how many feels like they just
[54:22] need the Lord to just come in and do
[54:24] just a little bit more preparation this
[54:25] morning
[54:27] [Music]
[54:28] you know I think that's what he wants to
[54:30] see I think he wants to see believers
[54:33] who not just believe him but need
[54:36] him and I think that's the god that we
[54:38] serve this morning and I just
[54:41] appreciated I just appreciate the spirit
[54:44] here this morning the spirit with the
[54:45] people and the music and just the
[54:48] direction that God takes and you know
[54:50] it's just at this point I think we could
[54:52] say it's it's been good to be in the
[54:54] house of the Lord amen you you know to
[54:56] come into His
[54:57] presence like maybe I just walked out
[54:59] the door and just felt the presence from
[55:01] the worship of the people and there's
[55:02] there's there's healing like we just
[55:04] saying in that presence there's
[55:06] Deliverance just in the presence of God
[55:08] um you can be free you can not only be
[55:11] free but he can take you up just a
[55:13] little higher than where you're at right
[55:14] now if we really just surrender to him
[55:16] this morning I I just ask would would
[55:18] you want to do that this morning yes
[55:20] would you want to just be taken a little
[55:22] bit higher by him to a place maybe
[55:24] you've never been before
[55:26] and and I I want to ask you something
[55:28] maybe just a little bit different this
[55:30] morning would you would you just do me a
[55:32] favor would you if you have a need if
[55:35] you have just something that's on your
[55:37] heart maybe it's for yourself maybe it's
[55:39] Deliverance maybe it's healing maybe
[55:40] it's it's for a little more of God maybe
[55:44] it's not for you maybe it's for someone
[55:46] else maybe your family member somebody
[55:48] that you have in your mind and I know we
[55:50] all have needs we all have things and
[55:52] sometimes we put them to the side and we
[55:53] go on with our day but we feel them
[55:55] there
[55:57] we hear them we it affects us when we
[55:59] try to go to sleep I I would ask that
[56:01] you would just have that need before you
[56:03] this
[56:04] morning whatever that might be for you
[56:06] just hold it in your heart hold it in
[56:09] your mind and just put it right before
[56:10] you this morning because we serve a God
[56:13] Amen who can meet that need this
[56:16] morning and I don't want you and I don't
[56:19] want to walk out of this building still
[56:21] holding on to a need that's
[56:23] unfulfilled and I believe we serve a god
[56:26] I believe he's real he's just as real
[56:28] today as the Bible that I read him about
[56:31] him he's he's that same God today and if
[56:33] you have something and you put it before
[56:36] the Lord I believe he wants to do that
[56:39] for you and I believe he wants it more
[56:42] than you want it I believe he's just
[56:44] waiting for us this morning to take our
[56:46] need even though he knows it and to say
[56:49] Lord here's what I have need of this
[56:50] morning and Lord not tomorrow but I need
[56:54] it today amen it's life and death I need
[56:57] it today Lord and watch him come on the
[57:00] scene this
[57:01] morning I want to read the scripture
[57:03] real quick and then I'll let you be
[57:05] seated it's Psalms
[57:07] 46 it says God is our refuge and
[57:13] strength how many's found him to be your
[57:15] Refuge yes how many has had no strength
[57:19] and somehow God got you through yes it
[57:23] wasn't wasn't your strength that did it
[57:25] right when you were the weakest is when
[57:27] he came along God is our refuge and
[57:31] strength and he's a very present help in
[57:35] trouble
[57:38] amen let's just bow our
[57:40] heads Lord we want to just surrender to
[57:43] you fully this morning Lord not just
[57:45] have Lord Another Sunday morning service
[57:49] it's good Lord that we gather together
[57:50] Lord it's good that we sit we sing Lord
[57:53] we hear somebody speak but Lord can this
[57:55] just be a different service this morning
[57:57] Lord Lord could there be someone Lord
[58:00] that's just so desperate for you this
[58:01] morning that Lord they could come back
[58:03] to this day and say that was the day the
[58:06] Lord did something for me that was the
[58:09] day the Lord made a difference in my
[58:11] life that was the day I had a need on my
[58:13] heart that only he knew and only he
[58:16] could fulfill and he did it for me that
[58:18] day Lord may it be just different than
[58:21] another Sunday in and Sunday out service
[58:23] Lord May there be a stake driven down in
[58:25] the ground today Lord by somebody in
[58:28] here Lord by some believer who is Lord
[58:31] despite our weakness and our failures
[58:33] not afraid to take you out your word
[58:35] Lord would you just come and Lord speak
[58:38] to us this morning set aside all of our
[58:41] thoughts our distractions Lord maybe
[58:43] before church and after set those aside
[58:46] Lord Lord the the incompetence Lord of
[58:50] myself Lord as a speaker set that to the
[58:52] side Lord would you just come and speak
[58:55] lip to ear to your people this morning
[58:58] in Jesus name amen you may be seated and
[59:01] I just want to say it's good to be in
[59:04] the house of the Lord this morning it's
[59:06] good to be with you here in Tucson this
[59:08] morning I talked just briefly with
[59:10] brother Dan yesterday over text and he
[59:13] said to make sure that I greeted the
[59:15] people there for him isn't it good that
[59:18] uh the Lord allows you know sometimes
[59:20] our our leaders get a little bit tired
[59:22] isn't it good that the Lord allows them
[59:24] to get a little bit of rest
[59:26] I pray that he comes back
[59:29] invigorated refilled
[59:32] energized and it's good that there's a
[59:35] church that is still here Sunday morning
[59:38] when the pastor's not here
[59:40] amen amen it's a good thing I'm sure he
[59:43] uh I don't know if he's going to watch
[59:44] it but I'm sure it'll be good for him to
[59:45] look out and see the Believers that that
[59:47] aren't coming because brother Dan's here
[59:50] they're coming because they need
[59:52] something from the Lord you're coming
[59:54] because you you're coming because you
[59:56] want to be here I hope amen and and and
[59:59] I I I wasn't real sure what to speak on
[1:00:01] this morning but um we're just going to
[1:00:03] surrender to the Lord and and and
[1:00:05] surrender our thoughts and our hearts to
[1:00:07] the Lord and and I really do pray that
[1:00:08] you would keep your need before you this
[1:00:11] morning and if you're somebody that
[1:00:13] doesn't have needs first of all I I'll
[1:00:15] be a little bit envious of you I'll
[1:00:18] admit but if you don't have a need for
[1:00:20] yourself certainly you know somebody
[1:00:22] that has a need of something and if you
[1:00:24] could just keep them before you this
[1:00:25] morning I want to just approach a
[1:00:28] subject that's well you've if you've
[1:00:30] heard me before it's real simple it
[1:00:31] doesn't get very complicated brother
[1:00:33] Aaron I don't know the the how to to
[1:00:37] preach a a deep and complicated message
[1:00:39] I just know the simple word of God and I
[1:00:41] just like to talk to you about that this
[1:00:43] morning there's a scripture I was going
[1:00:44] to have you turn to a scripture but if
[1:00:46] we could maybe without the the slides or
[1:00:49] maybe without our bibles if we could
[1:00:51] just say this scripture I I think I
[1:00:53] learned this back in Sunday School uh
[1:00:55] how many knows the scripture Hebrews
[1:00:57] 138 okay without looking at it without
[1:01:00] opening your Bibles maybe let's not put
[1:01:01] on the screen probably the most preached
[1:01:03] message and brother brandom's uh
[1:01:05] messages Hebrews 138 would you just say
[1:01:09] that with me this
[1:01:10] morning Jesus Christ the same go
[1:01:15] ahead one more time Jesus
[1:01:20] Christ amen amen that's the truth that's
[1:01:24] the truth it's not just us reciting
[1:01:26] scripture it's a truth but I I'd like to
[1:01:28] talk to you about now I I it was a
[1:01:31] little bit of a
[1:01:32] trick I tricked you just a little
[1:01:35] bit I want to talk to you about the most
[1:01:37] forgotten word in the
[1:01:40] Bible and it's in Hebrews
[1:01:43] 138 and if you turn to it you may say
[1:01:47] brother you're just like grasping at
[1:01:48] straws for a message but I believe every
[1:01:50] single word in the Bible is relevant I
[1:01:53] don't believe that God just put words in
[1:01:54] there to put words in there it says
[1:01:56] Jesus Christ the same
[1:01:58] yesterday
[1:02:00] and
[1:02:03] today and
[1:02:06] forever Jesus Christ the same
[1:02:08] yesterday and
[1:02:11] today and forever and when I say it and
[1:02:14] I think almost every time I've heard
[1:02:15] brother brandom say it he says it's
[1:02:17] exactly like we just said it a minute
[1:02:18] ago so I'm not saying this wrong I'm
[1:02:20] just saying there's significance to this
[1:02:23] word
[1:02:25] and I I I know you might be thinking
[1:02:28] it's just a word what difference does it
[1:02:30] make but I think it makes a huge
[1:02:32] difference in the scripture because it's
[1:02:34] in there for a reason in fact it's it's
[1:02:36] in there and I'm not an English teacher
[1:02:39] uh if there's any in here you'll
[1:02:40] probably be ashamed of my English but I
[1:02:42] know that's not even how you form a
[1:02:43] sentence the way we say it was the right
[1:02:45] way Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:02:47] today and forever that's how it should
[1:02:49] be grammatically correct and yet the
[1:02:51] Bible puts another word in there it says
[1:02:54] and today and I I believe that the that
[1:02:56] it's that way because it's trying to
[1:02:58] draw our attention to what that
[1:03:00] scripture is trying to
[1:03:02] say it's trying to draw our attention to
[1:03:05] uh something about the scriptures
[1:03:07] different than just the way we would
[1:03:08] just say it and and I want to read you
[1:03:10] something that brother brandom says
[1:03:12] throughout all the message if you wanted
[1:03:14] to go look it up maybe you look up the
[1:03:16] words looking
[1:03:17] forward and as soon as I start to tell
[1:03:19] you this if you if you're at all
[1:03:21] familiar with the message you you'll
[1:03:22] know what I'm going to say because
[1:03:24] brother Ram says it many many times says
[1:03:26] man is always praising God for what he
[1:03:29] has
[1:03:31] done and looking forward for what he
[1:03:34] will do and ignoring what he's doing
[1:03:39] come
[1:03:40] on and this is tied directly to Hebrews
[1:03:44] 138 that's and now I want you to just
[1:03:47] listen he say I think that's the
[1:03:49] condition our church is getting
[1:03:51] into God shook every gift that he
[1:03:55] promised in the Bible have we not seen
[1:03:57] every gift in this Bible come to pass
[1:04:00] now if you haven't seen every gift let's
[1:04:02] stop right there and I want you to know
[1:04:04] that that God has brought every gift
[1:04:06] that's in this Bible to pass whether it
[1:04:08] be here locally in the church whether it
[1:04:10] be in a in in a Ministry maybe in
[1:04:12] another church maybe it be in the
[1:04:14] ministry of William brandham but God has
[1:04:15] brought every single gift in this Bible
[1:04:17] to pass and it's not just I I got news
[1:04:20] maybe you know this but it's not just
[1:04:22] for
[1:04:23] yesterday you know the god of William
[1:04:25] brandom is the god of today I I know
[1:04:29] that's big news right everybody knows
[1:04:31] that but sometimes we sometimes I act as
[1:04:34] though the god of William brandom is the
[1:04:37] god of
[1:04:38] yesterday and I forget that he exists
[1:04:40] today and the same exact thing he did
[1:04:43] back then he'll do today and brother
[1:04:45] says God shook every gift he promised in
[1:04:47] the Bible before us and we still stare
[1:04:50] into
[1:04:53] space anybody ever done that in church
[1:04:55] yeah I'm not going to say anybody's
[1:04:57] doing it
[1:04:58] now but and we still stare into space as
[1:05:03] we're looking for something
[1:05:06] else you ever come to church with a need
[1:05:09] on your heart and you leave with that
[1:05:10] same need
[1:05:11] unfulfilled and sometimes you don't even
[1:05:13] remember what was said in that service
[1:05:15] you just what what was it just staring
[1:05:17] into space dwelling on the problem or
[1:05:20] thinking about tomorrow or thinking
[1:05:22] about work or thinking about
[1:05:24] stress he says it's seems to be a
[1:05:26] spiritual condition of the church that
[1:05:28] they fail to see the hour that they're
[1:05:31] living they're looking for some
[1:05:33] sensation or something way off in the
[1:05:37] future man is forever doing that he
[1:05:40] always blesses God for what he has done
[1:05:43] looking forward for what he will do and
[1:05:45] ignoring what he is doing you fail to
[1:05:48] see the hour that we're living in and
[1:05:51] this scripture that God is the same
[1:05:54] yesterday and and today and forever to
[1:05:57] me draws attention to what he is doing
[1:06:01] today and and and I know this is just
[1:06:04] it's just about a basic as it gets but
[1:06:06] just if you just stay with me this
[1:06:07] morning brother M says this that's as
[1:06:12] good as the devil wants them to be now
[1:06:14] you could say Okay I I misunderstood the
[1:06:16] scripture maybe I didn't read it that
[1:06:18] way but I'm going to be good now but I
[1:06:19] want let's just take it another level
[1:06:21] deeper that the devil has he has a
[1:06:24] strategy yeah
[1:06:26] amen anybody ever come across his
[1:06:28] strategy he has a plan to try to get you
[1:06:32] away from God okay here's his strategy
[1:06:35] it's not my words it's the words of the
[1:06:36] prophet he says that's as good as the
[1:06:38] devil wants them to be very
[1:06:41] religious Scholars and Educators watch
[1:06:44] what the devil's strategy is you would
[1:06:46] think the devil's strategy to tell you
[1:06:48] God's not real but that's not his
[1:06:51] strategy well that that he's a good God
[1:06:54] but you know he doesn't care about you
[1:06:56] that's that's not his strategy why
[1:06:59] because we've come a little bit farther
[1:07:00] than that right maybe the devil would
[1:07:02] try that and we would say I I know that
[1:07:03] God's real so he's going to he's going
[1:07:06] to update his strategy here's his
[1:07:08] strategy coming from a prophet says
[1:07:11] he'll prove to you what he has done he's
[1:07:16] talking about God
[1:07:18] now and prove what God is going to
[1:07:23] do and have you ignore what he's is
[1:07:26] doing so Satan will come to you and tell
[1:07:29] you yes that is the god you serve that's
[1:07:33] the god you serve see what he did back
[1:07:35] there you know I always thought about
[1:07:36] this uh anybody ever hear Brother random
[1:07:39] say so much about the days of Miracles
[1:07:42] are passed right days of Miracles passed
[1:07:44] I never brother Aaron ever heard anybody
[1:07:46] in my life say the days of Miracles are
[1:07:49] passed so I thought okay well that maybe
[1:07:50] that was a battle that was going on back
[1:07:52] then but really what Satan is doing is
[1:07:54] saying that the days of
[1:07:57] Miracles listen to me now that the god
[1:07:59] that you serve that has done what he's
[1:08:02] done in the Bible is for
[1:08:05] yesterday yes it was true yes I can't
[1:08:08] prove to you that that those thoughts
[1:08:10] were not discerned that those people
[1:08:12] that they weren't healed that they
[1:08:13] weren't delivered I can't prove to you
[1:08:15] that but as long as he can get you to
[1:08:17] say that was the god of yesterday he's
[1:08:20] got you wow he's got you he can't maybe
[1:08:24] prove to you that God's Not A Healer but
[1:08:26] if he could just say you know what that
[1:08:27] was great back then when God healed
[1:08:30] you and get you to ignore what God is
[1:08:33] doing today or if he can say you know
[1:08:36] what you just keep praying you keep
[1:08:38] praying and you know what one day God
[1:08:40] will bring you that Deliverance I'm so
[1:08:43] tired of that devil that is a devil that
[1:08:46] is saying that you say oh no we need to
[1:08:48] be patient I I'll have a quote for you
[1:08:50] that says you can have you can have
[1:08:51] patience you can have all these things
[1:08:53] and yet the devil can still tell you
[1:08:55] that tomorrow is when you'll be
[1:08:57] delivered that tomorrow is what is when
[1:09:00] you'll get what you need God is a good
[1:09:02] god he's a faithful God he'll deliver
[1:09:05] you he'll heal you as long as you can
[1:09:07] just wait for him to do it and that's
[1:09:09] not what God says God says call upon my
[1:09:14] name call upon my name and I a very
[1:09:18] present help in time of trouble a very
[1:09:21] present help is not tomorrow it's not
[1:09:24] yesterday it's right now and this it
[1:09:27] doesn't get more simple than this but I
[1:09:29] think sometimes we forget these things
[1:09:31] because I I I know I forget them because
[1:09:34] sometimes I just let the devil tell me
[1:09:36] that God is a good god and that God will
[1:09:39] lead me God will deliver me and God is
[1:09:41] trying to do it right
[1:09:44] now and I put it off for tomorrow
[1:09:49] on it says in Matthew take therefore no
[1:09:53] thought for the
[1:09:56] tomorrow this is right out of the
[1:09:58] scripture you could say I don't know I
[1:10:00] need to think about tomorrow Matthew
[1:10:01] says do not think about tomorrow for the
[1:10:05] tomorrow shall take thought for the
[1:10:07] things of
[1:10:09] itself looking to yesterday and I think
[1:10:13] it's perfectly fine I think it's
[1:10:15] perfectly fine to read our Bible this is
[1:10:16] this is a book of things that happened
[1:10:19] yesterday that happened in our past when
[1:10:21] I put on a tape or I listen to a I
[1:10:23] listen to a message or I read a message
[1:10:25] it's talking about things that happened
[1:10:26] yesterday and I think that's perfectly
[1:10:28] fine to go back in the word and see what
[1:10:32] happened yesterday but if you doing that
[1:10:35] to just view what happened yesterday
[1:10:37] you've lost the point of why we have a
[1:10:39] Bible you've lost the point of why God
[1:10:41] allowed a messenger to be recorded onto
[1:10:44] tapes and onto CDs and whatever it might
[1:10:46] be he didn't do that so you could you
[1:10:49] could just read about a god of history
[1:10:51] and say well that was a great God I wish
[1:10:53] I was in those prayer lines that same
[1:10:55] God that was in those prayer lines is
[1:10:57] present before you
[1:11:00] today and and and and he doesn't need to
[1:11:03] have I'm going to tell you this he
[1:11:04] doesn't need to have a prayer line to do
[1:11:06] exactly the same thing that he's
[1:11:08] done that's the God that I serve I don't
[1:11:10] I don't know what the god you serve is
[1:11:12] but the God that I serve doesn't need to
[1:11:14] have a prayer
[1:11:15] line he could just with the Bible says
[1:11:17] with his finger cast out the
[1:11:20] devil you could have a a a need on your
[1:11:23] heart and not ever voice and God could
[1:11:26] say I hear you and I'm going to give you
[1:11:27] what you have need
[1:11:29] of and I know this not from reading
[1:11:32] about it I know it from
[1:11:34] experience I know it the few times I I'm
[1:11:37] not preaching to you something that I've
[1:11:39] I I've conquered I'm preaching to you
[1:11:41] something that I struggle with is to
[1:11:43] take a God out of history and make him a
[1:11:46] present day God and the few times that I
[1:11:48] have done it the few times I've
[1:11:50] surrendered my thoughts he has come on
[1:11:53] the scene and he's done exactly the same
[1:11:55] same thing that he's done in the Bible
[1:11:57] it it's not just the god of William
[1:11:59] brandham it's my
[1:12:01] God it's it should be your
[1:12:06] God a lot of times looking to the Past
[1:12:08] though what happens Satan can he always
[1:12:11] wants us to try to look at the past to
[1:12:13] look at and to distract
[1:12:15] us from what's going on
[1:12:18] today he'll make you look to the past I
[1:12:20] don't know maybe this doesn't apply to
[1:12:21] you but it applies to me and it applies
[1:12:23] to a lot of people I've spoken to he'll
[1:12:25] make you look to the past to yesterday
[1:12:27] and look at all the hurt that you've
[1:12:29] gone
[1:12:30] through now maybe somebody hurt you
[1:12:32] maybe your mom hurt you maybe your
[1:12:33] father hurt you maybe a a close friend
[1:12:36] hurt you maybe a church hurt
[1:12:40] you and and and heaven forbid but it
[1:12:43] happens maybe even somebody in the name
[1:12:46] of the message hurt you
[1:12:49] wow does it
[1:12:51] happen amen I I know I know I'm speaking
[1:12:54] to real people I know I'm speaking to
[1:12:56] people that go through this have gone
[1:12:58] through this and will go through
[1:13:01] this that's what he wants you to focus
[1:13:04] onow carry the hurt over and when you're
[1:13:07] so hurt you can't see the god of
[1:13:12] today and and the hurt is real the hurt
[1:13:15] is real it's not made up he's not
[1:13:16] reminding you of some fake thing that
[1:13:18] you didn't feel no the hurt's real the
[1:13:20] Betrayal is real and you can't see God
[1:13:23] today because your heart and your mind
[1:13:26] and your focus and your feelings are all
[1:13:28] on things that happened
[1:13:32] yesterday maybe it's a life that God
[1:13:34] pulled you out of anybody been pulled
[1:13:36] out of a life Amen brother somebody been
[1:13:38] pulled out of a life right here right
[1:13:40] there and he'll remind you of that life
[1:13:43] that you've been pulled out That's what
[1:13:44] Satan does remind you oh you haven't
[1:13:46] really been pulled out of that life I
[1:13:48] know what I'm talking about this morning
[1:13:49] that's what he does you haven't really
[1:13:51] been pulled out of that life you are
[1:13:53] still that same person what do he do and
[1:13:55] he's keeping your heart in
[1:13:57] yesterday to try to get you to ignore
[1:14:00] and not see what God is wanting to do
[1:14:03] for you
[1:14:05] today and he's quick and he's good at
[1:14:07] what he does and as soon as something
[1:14:10] happens anybody anybody make a mistake
[1:14:12] there should be some amens right all
[1:14:14] right amen anybody make a
[1:14:17] mistake the moment you make one where
[1:14:19] does s Satan take you
[1:14:22] back he takes you back oh you made a
[1:14:25] mistake and you said you were delivered
[1:14:27] you said you were through that you said
[1:14:29] you were past that you said you gave
[1:14:31] that over to God the moment you fall he
[1:14:33] does that why he's trying to take you
[1:14:36] back to
[1:14:38] yesterday and he'll tell you oh that's
[1:14:40] that's the god of yesterday well maybe
[1:14:42] you just didn't pray to that God CU he's
[1:14:43] a good God the problem must be with you
[1:14:47] and he's trying to get your focus off of
[1:14:50] today wow and look at yesterday
[1:14:57] why are we still allowing him to do this
[1:15:01] to take us to the past to take us to a
[1:15:04] god that certainly was a good god
[1:15:06] yesterday but if he can keep our minds
[1:15:09] there if he keep our Focus there and and
[1:15:11] and keep us in the hurt that happened to
[1:15:13] us and I want to tell you this not
[1:15:16] planning to say this but maybe the hurt
[1:15:19] is still there because you haven't
[1:15:21] forgiven
[1:15:23] somebody and so Satan takes you back to
[1:15:26] a hurt that still lives in you that's a
[1:15:28] real hurt because that hasn't been made
[1:15:30] right yet and you know God will take
[1:15:33] that same opportunity to say oh yeah you
[1:15:35] know why that hurt is still there
[1:15:36] because you haven't forgiven
[1:15:39] somebody I I know this the I know it's
[1:15:42] the truth because I've lived
[1:15:45] it I've held on to things I've held on
[1:15:48] to hurts I want to tell you this morning
[1:15:50] I there was a certain situation I won't
[1:15:52] go into details there was a situation
[1:15:54] where I was 100%
[1:15:56] wronged you know sometimes you but
[1:15:59] sometimes you can go I was like I was
[1:16:00] like
[1:16:01] 5050 right nobody's nobody's ever been
[1:16:04] there 5050 I know there's some married
[1:16:06] couples in here come on
[1:16:09] now well that fight was about 60% my
[1:16:12] wife and 40% me so you know she needs I
[1:16:17] this is just truth right she needs to
[1:16:19] come and apologize first you don't have
[1:16:22] to say Amen but it's the truth sometimes
[1:16:24] right right and and if somebody isn't
[1:16:27] married don't worry you'll get there and
[1:16:30] and and sometimes we do that even and
[1:16:31] I'm just trying I'm not trying to make
[1:16:32] light of our problems but you know
[1:16:34] sometimes we just get an attitude of
[1:16:36] well that person has never come to me
[1:16:39] and made it right and as soon as they do
[1:16:42] I'll forgive
[1:16:44] them who's carrying around the
[1:16:46] hurt they aren't they aren't carrying
[1:16:50] around the hurt you are and from
[1:16:53] something that someone else might have
[1:16:55] done to
[1:16:56] you and no forgiveness happening you
[1:17:00] will fail to see a god of today that's
[1:17:04] just really what it boils down to you
[1:17:06] will not be able to see you might feel
[1:17:08] good in service I'm not saying that I'm
[1:17:10] not saying you won't feel his presence
[1:17:12] but I'm talking about a God who makes
[1:17:15] changes to you I'm talking about a
[1:17:17] Difference Maker that's who I'm talking
[1:17:19] about that is the kind of God that will
[1:17:21] say well I saw so and so being blessed
[1:17:23] and I saw this and I heard about this
[1:17:24] meeting over here where this is
[1:17:26] happening why isn't that happening in my
[1:17:31] life and you can't let go of the past
[1:17:33] because you can't let go of the
[1:17:35] hurt and I want to tell you that there
[1:17:38] are this this this situation that I was
[1:17:41] in I was sitting there trying to study I
[1:17:43] might have told you this testimony but
[1:17:44] I'll I'll just tell you again I was
[1:17:46] sitting there trying to study on a
[1:17:47] Sunday afternoon and and H it was like
[1:17:50] it was just like I was hitting a wall
[1:17:52] and this this hurt that somebody had
[1:17:54] hurt me was like years and years passed
[1:17:56] and the Lord brought it up right before
[1:17:57] me right when I was sitting there like
[1:17:59] Lord why can't why can't I why won't you
[1:18:01] open your Bible to me why is this just
[1:18:02] like a a blank slate you everybody feel
[1:18:04] like that when you prayed amen amen it's
[1:18:08] real you ever feel like your your your
[1:18:09] prayers just go and bounce right off the
[1:18:11] sky and come right back down and
[1:18:13] sometimes you don't even want to pray
[1:18:14] anymore because that feeling is a good
[1:18:16] feeling Lord why aren't you hearing me
[1:18:18] and then the Lord brought up right
[1:18:19] before me brought up oh there's a
[1:18:21] situation you have to make right and
[1:18:22] right before the Lord I said Lord that
[1:18:24] person has not apologized to
[1:18:27] me I was I was
[1:18:31] wronged and the Lord spoke to me as
[1:18:33] clear as day in my heart he said you
[1:18:35] have something to make
[1:18:38] right and right then it was one of the
[1:18:41] hardest things I've ever done I picked
[1:18:43] up the phone and I called this
[1:18:45] person I said hey we had a conversation
[1:18:48] a few years ago and they remembered
[1:18:51] it and you know you said this and it I'm
[1:18:55] just being real with you this morning I
[1:18:57] hope it's
[1:18:58] okay uh I didn't plan on telling you
[1:19:00] this but I told in my heart you know
[1:19:02] what I wanted to say you hurt
[1:19:05] me and I responded this way because then
[1:19:08] I could let that person know I was still
[1:19:11] hurt and it was like the words were not
[1:19:14] permitted to come out of my mouth to say
[1:19:15] that I said I said this to you and I
[1:19:19] shouldn't have said
[1:19:21] that and I'm sorry would you forgive me
[1:19:25] me and they said yes I forgive you and
[1:19:28] I'm just I'm being I'm being real in my
[1:19:30] heart I thought okay brother Aaron now
[1:19:34] they're going to make right what they
[1:19:36] did I've opened up the communication I
[1:19:39] made that first step I made the really
[1:19:40] hard step of saying I'm sorry when I
[1:19:43] really didn't think I did anything but
[1:19:45] the Lord revealed to me I had this is
[1:19:48] the opportunity now for them to say
[1:19:49] sorry and they said okay thank you have
[1:19:52] a good day
[1:19:55] and that was it and I I left there I
[1:19:57] just was looking at the phone like wait
[1:19:59] a minute that was that was the moment of
[1:20:01] healing that was the moment of
[1:20:02] reconciliation that was the moment that
[1:20:04] the Lord was going to make this thing
[1:20:05] right it still to this day has never
[1:20:07] been made right but I have a peace that
[1:20:10] I didn't have before I have an Avenue to
[1:20:14] the Lord that I didn't have before maybe
[1:20:16] that person will never come and say you
[1:20:18] know what but you know what I have from
[1:20:19] my heart forgiven them am I've forgiven
[1:20:22] them in fact I'm to the point where I
[1:20:24] don't I don't care if they ever say
[1:20:26] sorry for it because I've genuinely from
[1:20:29] my heart forgiven it and that took years
[1:20:31] years and years and years and I'm
[1:20:33] telling you I tell you that one
[1:20:34] testimony because it's the good one but
[1:20:36] for that one there's probably five other
[1:20:37] ones where I'm still holding on to stuff
[1:20:40] no really I I I I struggle sometimes to
[1:20:42] just wow you know Lord help me forgive
[1:20:45] that person you can't you can't fake it
[1:20:47] you can't fake forgiving somebody you
[1:20:49] can't do it you can't Bluff anybody
[1:20:51] tried to do that and then that person
[1:20:53] comes in and you you you know that thing
[1:20:55] and your heart Rises up right you know
[1:20:57] that little thing that comes up and it's
[1:20:59] like oh there they are Lord I've
[1:21:01] forgiven them but you you haven't right
[1:21:03] if you can't go up to them like they're
[1:21:05] your brother or your sister and talk to
[1:21:08] them and hug them you you haven't
[1:21:09] forgiven them and and I wonder if that
[1:21:12] little thing which is actually a big
[1:21:15] thing keeps you in the
[1:21:19] past and you were probably undoubtedly
[1:21:22] undoubtedly you were wronged but you
[1:21:23] have to let it go
[1:21:28] it's hindering not that person it's
[1:21:30] hindering
[1:21:32] you I heard it saying that
[1:21:37] that that bitterness which is what that
[1:21:40] causes is like drinking poison and
[1:21:43] expecting the other person to
[1:21:46] die and it's true it's it's the the the
[1:21:50] unforgiveness doesn't poison them it
[1:21:52] poisons you and it's in and it's it's I
[1:21:55] would you if you have something like
[1:21:57] that would you let it go this
[1:21:59] morning I know you can't just go okay
[1:22:01] I'll let it go I know it takes some I
[1:22:03] know it takes some heart cleaning out
[1:22:06] but would you be willing to do that this
[1:22:09] morning on it's hard it's
[1:22:13] hard and
[1:22:17] and I want to tell you that God is a
[1:22:19] present
[1:22:21] help which means you can't really do
[1:22:24] that
[1:22:26] but if you if you ask God God would you
[1:22:28] go with
[1:22:30] me I got to make a phone call right now
[1:22:33] God would you be with me in that phone
[1:22:34] call you know he'll be there with
[1:22:39] you another
[1:22:41] thing I I I just don't really know where
[1:22:44] to go but another thing that Satan does
[1:22:47] for for you know we have a lot of new
[1:22:49] Christians we have a lot of Christians
[1:22:50] that have been in Christians maybe for a
[1:22:52] couple years we have a lot of people
[1:22:54] that have been Christians a long
[1:22:57] time I don't want to put years to it
[1:23:00] but there's some people been been I I I
[1:23:03] grew up in the message I haven't been a
[1:23:04] Christian my whole life because I didn't
[1:23:05] give my heart to the Lord but I grew up
[1:23:08] in this message and a and and another
[1:23:10] thing Satan likes to do he likes to take
[1:23:13] those those Warriors those those
[1:23:15] veterans the people that have been
[1:23:16] around for a while and he likes to keep
[1:23:19] you in the past where your experience
[1:23:21] happened
[1:23:25] because no doubt you've had an
[1:23:26] experience with the Lord no doubt you've
[1:23:28] had an experience with the Lord no doubt
[1:23:30] you can say this day I gave my heart to
[1:23:33] the Lord and this day he filled me with
[1:23:35] his Holy Ghost and if Satan can just
[1:23:37] keep you in that
[1:23:40] day you miss what's going on
[1:23:43] today if he can just keep your mind in
[1:23:47] your experience with God he's not going
[1:23:48] to try to tell you you didn't have an
[1:23:49] experience with God he can't he can't
[1:23:53] because you have something inside that
[1:23:54] says no no I had an experience so what
[1:23:56] he'll try to do is he'll just try to
[1:23:58] take that you're filling with the Holy
[1:24:00] Ghost that happened at a place in the
[1:24:02] past and that was a good God just
[1:24:04] concentrate on that and miss out on a
[1:24:07] filling of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:11] today yeah you can get quiet but it's
[1:24:13] but it's exactly what he does I raise my
[1:24:16] hand 10 years you know sometimes a
[1:24:17] preacher will come or or the pastor will
[1:24:19] come and you know anybody want to raise
[1:24:21] their hands and I found that the people
[1:24:24] who rais their hands the least are the
[1:24:26] people that have been in the message the
[1:24:28] longest that's what I found not all the
[1:24:30] time not with every single one but I
[1:24:32] found that the most I I would say I'm
[1:24:35] you know what I can put myself in that
[1:24:37] crowd would that be okay I I've been I I
[1:24:40] think I've been a a Believer for a long
[1:24:42] time the hardest people to get to get a
[1:24:45] response out of are the people that have
[1:24:46] been there the
[1:24:48] longest oh it's not about a response
[1:24:50] brother once you mature in the word
[1:24:52] you come on now that's not even that's
[1:24:55] not the Bible that we that's not the
[1:24:56] Bible and that's not the message we got
[1:24:58] to take all of the message yes there are
[1:25:01] quotes that say you know it's not about
[1:25:03] sensation it's not about jumping it's
[1:25:04] not about shouting right but you can't
[1:25:06] just take those quotes and then throw
[1:25:08] away the other ones that says when the
[1:25:10] Holy Spirit comes through the building
[1:25:12] and if it passes over you and there's no
[1:25:15] response if you can't stand up he says
[1:25:17] you're
[1:25:19] dead you can't raise your hand he says
[1:25:21] you're dead oh you can't tell me I'm
[1:25:24] dead I've had an experience yes but
[1:25:26] you're still back in the past when that
[1:25:29] experience happened and not and not
[1:25:31] today in an everpresent God who says
[1:25:34] that was great I did that for you but I
[1:25:36] want to do something new for you
[1:25:39] today I want to make you a new Christian
[1:25:41] I don't care if you've been a Christian
[1:25:43] 10 years 20 years 30 years I want to do
[1:25:46] something new for you
[1:25:48] today and he is not only wanting to do
[1:25:51] that he's here to do it wow
[1:25:55] he's not coming he's here why because
[1:25:58] we've invited him we've made him welcome
[1:26:00] he's here you feel his
[1:26:04] presence and then leave in fact you
[1:26:07] can't leave the same
[1:26:09] way sometimes we leave
[1:26:12] worse because we don't let him come in
[1:26:15] and make a
[1:26:16] change are you still eating off the Mana
[1:26:19] from
[1:26:22] yesterday that's a question for for
[1:26:25] maybe those of us have been around are
[1:26:26] you still living off the experience of
[1:26:30] yesterday are you still are you still
[1:26:32] trying to eat what the Lord did for you
[1:26:35] in a day gone past or has he done it for
[1:26:38] you new this
[1:26:39] morning or do you know all the word do
[1:26:42] you know all the word and it's just so
[1:26:43] hard to hear
[1:26:44] anything I I I'm just going to say this
[1:26:47] I might not make friends but this is the
[1:26:48] truth I know because I battle this are
[1:26:51] is it so hard to hear something new that
[1:26:53] you're like oh I never heard heard that
[1:26:54] before or do we just know it
[1:26:56] allow do we just know it all oh I heard
[1:26:59] a message preach like this 10 years ago
[1:27:01] yeah but what if it's the Lord today
[1:27:03] saying I need to bring into remembrance
[1:27:06] something to your mind because you're
[1:27:08] living in the past or you're living in
[1:27:10] the future and I'm a present God today
[1:27:12] who wants to do something for you
[1:27:15] today has your experience started to dry
[1:27:19] up oh that doesn't happen to me brother
[1:27:21] it happened to David
[1:27:24] David killed
[1:27:26] Goliath slew Goliath as a as a teenager
[1:27:30] became king with stood Saul defeated
[1:27:33] armies and got to a point in his life he
[1:27:35] said Lord renew my
[1:27:38] heart Lord I've lost the joy of the
[1:27:42] Salvation that you gave me so long ago
[1:27:45] restored unto me Lord David and here I
[1:27:49] think I'm exempt from it here I think
[1:27:51] I'm so special sometimes that I can't
[1:27:53] lose sight
[1:27:54] not of What the Lord Has Done I lose
[1:27:57] sight of what he's doing thinking about
[1:27:59] what he did does that make sense I lose
[1:28:02] sight of what he's doing today this
[1:28:03] morning right now because I'm thinking
[1:28:06] about oh you did this for me back
[1:28:11] then the church at Ephesus we want talk
[1:28:14] about we want to talk about maybe you
[1:28:16] say you know what I I I'm I'm into
[1:28:18] deeper things than this brother the
[1:28:19] church at
[1:28:20] Ephesus this is in the message now Paul
[1:28:23] took them into the deep things of the
[1:28:25] word he says I took that church I I I
[1:28:29] could preach to that church things I
[1:28:31] could never preach to the
[1:28:34] Corinthians amen that's what William
[1:28:36] Bram said he says oh Paul taught them
[1:28:39] things they he he couldn't teach those
[1:28:42] things to the Corinthian Church but he
[1:28:44] taught it to the Ephesus Church he
[1:28:45] brought them so deep into the word he
[1:28:47] says but there was a problem he says the
[1:28:50] Ephesus Church in fact God says I have
[1:28:53] something against you because you left
[1:28:57] or lost your first
[1:28:58] love and what was that first love he
[1:29:01] says that first love was a present day
[1:29:04] giving control to the Holy
[1:29:06] Ghost that's what it was it what what
[1:29:09] love did they they they knew about God
[1:29:11] they knew about the word they knew about
[1:29:13] deep things but they lost the ability to
[1:29:16] give God what was happening today
[1:29:19] instead they had control of it they had
[1:29:21] control over uh I'm just going to preach
[1:29:23] now how long the service should go oh
[1:29:26] how long the minister oh he's been over
[1:29:28] he's been 46 minutes oh we've sang eight
[1:29:31] songs and still seven songs I've heard
[1:29:33] this from I've heard this from people so
[1:29:35] I know it's true so much control over
[1:29:37] the service that God has
[1:29:40] none and not doing it out of
[1:29:42] maliciousness or bad intent oh we're
[1:29:44] doing exactly what's in the word yes but
[1:29:46] maybe God wants to do something for you
[1:29:49] today that you will have to set aside
[1:29:52] not the word but your thoughts of the
[1:29:54] the word your way of doing what the word
[1:29:57] says and and if you can't do that I
[1:30:00] wonder if we've left our first love of
[1:30:03] giving Over
[1:30:05] Control I'm I'm tell you right now I'm a
[1:30:08] I am a control
[1:30:09] freak we don't have any of those
[1:30:12] right amen I see I saw a couple hands of
[1:30:15] some honest people I got to have control
[1:30:18] over things it is so hard for me to
[1:30:19] surrender control it just is and God
[1:30:23] needs
[1:30:24] the
[1:30:26] control and then I wonder sometimes why
[1:30:28] I'm not being uh delivered why I'm not
[1:30:31] getting uh not just saying it getting
[1:30:34] what I what I'm praying for because
[1:30:35] sometimes God doesn't give you what you
[1:30:36] pray for and it's for your benefit but
[1:30:39] sometimes I don't feel him I don't see
[1:30:41] him working in my life and here I am
[1:30:43] with all the control in my hand Lord you
[1:30:46] need to come I've prayed I've done this
[1:30:48] I have all the control and God just
[1:30:50] saying I just want you to let go of that
[1:30:52] and watch me show up
[1:30:55] let go of control watch me show up don't
[1:30:57] worry about how long it's been don't
[1:30:59] look at your watch and I'm not going to
[1:31:00] be too much longer but but but but just
[1:31:04] a routine we have a routine well I'm
[1:31:07] going to go to church this day and this
[1:31:09] other day I'm going to go to church and
[1:31:10] then Monday turns into I got to think
[1:31:12] about work and I it's it's a routine and
[1:31:15] somewhere in that God is
[1:31:17] lost well I I didn't receive him today
[1:31:20] but you know what church is Wednesday
[1:31:21] May I'll get him Church there's a a
[1:31:23] refilling of the the Holy Ghost Monday
[1:31:25] and Tuesday and Thursday and Friday and
[1:31:28] Saturday when there are no church days
[1:31:30] there's a God who wants to refill you
[1:31:32] those days
[1:31:33] too because it's so easy to just put God
[1:31:36] off into the future or put him into the
[1:31:39] past oh that was a great service how
[1:31:40] many went to the C me I know there's a
[1:31:42] couple people went to the camp meetings
[1:31:43] last
[1:31:44] weekend couple of the sisters it's I'm
[1:31:48] still rejoicing from those camp meetings
[1:31:50] but if I have the mentality that whoa I
[1:31:53] got to go to one of can't mean to get
[1:31:54] the Lord I've missed the point of the
[1:31:56] Lord I've missed it all right we got to
[1:31:58] have a special speaker come and speak
[1:32:00] for us we got to have some weekend
[1:32:02] meetings no we do
[1:32:03] not you don't even have to go to church
[1:32:06] you could sit down with them in your
[1:32:08] house in your car I don't care where you
[1:32:09] at and he can be an everpresent help at
[1:32:12] that moment as long as amen that's what
[1:32:15] he does as long as you're not a go
[1:32:17] thinking of oh God what you did last
[1:32:19] time and those meetings was so great yes
[1:32:21] but what about today he's that same
[1:32:23] exact today oh we got meetings coming up
[1:32:26] in a week I'm just making up a date you
[1:32:28] may not have meetings but oh we got
[1:32:30] these meetings come I'm going to get
[1:32:31] such a feeling God said I'm here right
[1:32:33] now to fill you right
[1:32:36] now right but the devil's trick is to
[1:32:39] get us to put him into tomorrow or put
[1:32:42] him into
[1:32:45] yesterday he says this in the Ephesian
[1:32:47] Church agus says there's something I've
[1:32:48] got against you and that is you've left
[1:32:51] your first love you've left that love
[1:32:53] that you you once had for those good
[1:32:55] oldfashioned Holy Ghost meetings and you
[1:32:58] begin to kind of slide backwards into
[1:33:00] that
[1:33:01] formal and he says
[1:33:07] nonsense I got a long quote I'm going to
[1:33:09] read it if it's okay I'll try to go
[1:33:10] through he says see they lost their
[1:33:11] first love that's what's the matter with
[1:33:13] the first church too formal they can't
[1:33:15] say Amen no
[1:33:17] more oh I said it from my heart brother
[1:33:19] yeah but sometimes God just wants to
[1:33:21] hear you if you'll Surrender Your will
[1:33:24] and accept his
[1:33:25] will it's not about shouting amen that
[1:33:28] doesn't make you a better Christian but
[1:33:30] if you're not doing it because you're in
[1:33:31] control there's a
[1:33:35] problem oh my goodness it breaks some of
[1:33:37] the makeup
[1:33:39] up see they don't have it no more that's
[1:33:41] Pentecost they never had it to begin
[1:33:43] with he says I'm talking about Pentecost
[1:33:45] it's sickening
[1:33:48] brother but we want a birth out of this
[1:33:51] thing got to bring death before you can
[1:33:54] have a birth see it's the truth if God
[1:33:57] had that against that church he'll have
[1:33:59] it against this one
[1:34:01] too oh it's good to read the Bible oh
[1:34:04] man that was Ephesus right oh the
[1:34:06] Ephesus that's putting God in the
[1:34:08] past that we got to read that as though
[1:34:12] that's
[1:34:13] us we have to read it as though it's a
[1:34:16] current day this to me is not a history
[1:34:20] book this is not a history book although
[1:34:22] it talks about things thaten happened
[1:34:24] before me this is a this is literally a
[1:34:27] blueprint of what's going on with me
[1:34:29] today the good and the
[1:34:33] bad watch this he says you left your
[1:34:35] first love I've got it against you I
[1:34:37] have something against you that's my
[1:34:38] complaint this is he's saying this is
[1:34:39] what God Said you once had a great time
[1:34:42] but you let the world begin to creep in
[1:34:45] and you started acting a little formal
[1:34:47] it's funny how he says that we start
[1:34:49] acting formal because we let the world
[1:34:51] creep in when I think sometimes we start
[1:34:53] acting formal because we think we're in
[1:34:56] control we think it's proper we think
[1:34:58] it's the right thing to do we think it's
[1:35:00] respectful we think it's reverent and he
[1:35:02] says you're formal because you let the
[1:35:03] world creep
[1:35:06] in and acting a little formal you still
[1:35:08] holding my hand watch this you're still
[1:35:11] holding my hand and I'm not saying this
[1:35:13] to anybody who's saying that you're
[1:35:15] you've forgotten God you've turned your
[1:35:17] back on God watch what he says you're
[1:35:19] still holding my name and you're still
[1:35:21] doing the things that's right that makes
[1:35:23] you feel good you've got a lot of
[1:35:25] patience and so forth and you labor but
[1:35:28] you're like a
[1:35:29] mule you labor and you work see my my
[1:35:33] you've left Grace faith and power and
[1:35:37] swapped it for labor and
[1:35:42] works well I tell you brother brandom I
[1:35:44] help every widow woman I can well that's
[1:35:46] a good thing I commend you for that but
[1:35:48] where's that first love you used to have
[1:35:52] mhm he says where's that that Joy you
[1:35:54] used to have as David once cried oh Lord
[1:35:57] restore to me the joy of my salvation
[1:35:59] where is them all night prayer meetings
[1:36:02] on and tears on your cheeks my goodness
[1:36:05] the Bible's even Dusty and got cobwebs
[1:36:07] on it you read old love stories and news
[1:36:11] and things and you might say oh I don't
[1:36:13] I don't I don't even have any of those
[1:36:16] books on on right you don't have to have
[1:36:20] a book on your shelf about a love story
[1:36:22] or news right right here you put it
[1:36:24] right in your hand yeah come on on I
[1:36:28] don't have time to read my
[1:36:31] Bible I'm preaching to myself now I
[1:36:33] don't have time to pray now if you're
[1:36:36] not swiping like that that's probably a
[1:36:37] good thing but but if you know what I'm
[1:36:39] talking about you know what I'm talking
[1:36:41] about you read old love stories and news
[1:36:44] and things and things that oughtn't even
[1:36:46] to be allowed published put out for a
[1:36:48] trash can and we Pentecostal people he
[1:36:50] put himself in that we Pentecostal
[1:36:53] people
[1:36:54] pick them up and just Loft over them
[1:36:56] like a bunch of flies on a garbage can
[1:36:58] what we need is to get back to our first
[1:37:01] love a love and a hunger for God of
[1:37:06] today that's what it is it's it's not
[1:37:08] that you've lost your love for God it's
[1:37:10] that you lost you I'm not telling you
[1:37:12] what you've lost now but if you struggle
[1:37:13] with this if you if you see what I'm
[1:37:15] talking about I think we've love we've
[1:37:17] lost our love for him
[1:37:21] today it it it takes a
[1:37:24] desperation a a desperation that says
[1:37:27] God if you don't come right now I won't
[1:37:30] make it till
[1:37:33] tomorrow tomorrow doesn't matter because
[1:37:35] I won't live to see tomorrow unless you
[1:37:37] come right now and watch God honor Faith
[1:37:40] like
[1:37:43] that we've lost sight of them though
[1:37:45] we've taken control of the church
[1:37:46] service with our ideas of how it should
[1:37:48] go we we've talked about
[1:37:50] this um and if you hear this and you say
[1:37:54] and you believe me and you say okay I've
[1:37:56] done that I want to give God
[1:37:58] preeminence I I don't want to I don't
[1:38:00] want to do that then you're going to
[1:38:03] face the next tactic of the
[1:38:06] devil you might have gotten over one
[1:38:08] you're going to face the next one and
[1:38:10] that is let the Holy Spirit have control
[1:38:13] of you starting
[1:38:17] tomorrow that's what the devil will do
[1:38:20] you know what that's a good thing you're
[1:38:21] trying to do that's a beautiful thing
[1:38:23] you're trying to do you're going to give
[1:38:24] God control that's good he's a good god
[1:38:27] let's start that
[1:38:30] tomorrow you want to start having prayer
[1:38:32] in your house start that
[1:38:35] tomorrow anybody ever I know you have
[1:38:38] but I I I just it came to me
[1:38:40] recently anybody ever been talking with
[1:38:42] somebody and somebody says you know I
[1:38:44] just really need prayer for this and you
[1:38:46] say I'll pray for
[1:38:48] you anybody you know what I'll pray for
[1:38:52] you
[1:38:53] and how many has forgotten to pray for
[1:38:55] that
[1:38:57] person I I I wonder if I could just
[1:38:59] challenge myself and challenge you this
[1:39:02] morning if you're talking to somebody
[1:39:04] and you know they need prayer or they
[1:39:06] ask you for prayer why don't you pray
[1:39:07] right then with
[1:39:09] them why do we have to say you know what
[1:39:11] I'll pray for you I I've been on the
[1:39:13] phone with somebody and it was the it
[1:39:14] was one of the best things ever done to
[1:39:16] me I just said you know you know what
[1:39:17] pray for me brother I I I I'm I'm
[1:39:20] battling this I'm going through this and
[1:39:22] here's what I expected him to say say
[1:39:23] all right I'll pray for you no problem
[1:39:25] he says well let's just pray right now
[1:39:26] over the
[1:39:28] phone and you know the Lord's delivered
[1:39:30] me of that battle I was going through
[1:39:32] right then on the phone because somebody
[1:39:36] not me but somebody else refused to put
[1:39:40] God into later on today or tomorrow or
[1:39:43] the next day they said no he's he's not
[1:39:45] a god of those things he's a God today
[1:39:47] right now let tomorrow take care of
[1:39:50] itself and if you want change if you
[1:39:52] want to give control over to the Holy
[1:39:54] Spirit maybe you've been keeping it
[1:39:56] don't wait till tomorrow to do it that's
[1:39:58] the next tactic of the devil oh that's a
[1:40:00] good thing that the the Pharisees and
[1:40:02] the Jews we know this they were looking
[1:40:05] for a messiah but they were looking
[1:40:08] ahead for him to come and he was right
[1:40:10] there with him and they missed out on
[1:40:13] him not because they weren't looking for
[1:40:16] him they weren't looking for him
[1:40:19] today it's not enough to believe that
[1:40:22] the the problem isn't looking forward
[1:40:25] it's looking forward and placing the
[1:40:27] things that God has for you in tomorrow
[1:40:30] and that's why I said maybe keep that
[1:40:32] need before you today oh God will you
[1:40:34] know what I believe he'll give me this I
[1:40:36] believe he'll do this that's okay but
[1:40:38] what about
[1:40:39] today what about changing the way that
[1:40:41] we think about
[1:40:44] uh God wants to do these things for you
[1:40:47] more than you want
[1:40:49] them how many want how many want a fresh
[1:40:54] not yesterday's Mana a fresh anointing
[1:40:57] of the Holy
[1:40:59] Ghost then God is here to do that for
[1:41:01] you
[1:41:03] today maybe there's somebody who doesn't
[1:41:05] want that that's fine but if you want it
[1:41:08] and you surrender and you don't put it
[1:41:11] off till
[1:41:13] tomorrow he'll do that for you today he
[1:41:15] says this you can talk of the comfort of
[1:41:18] Christ give ones and say that a comfort
[1:41:20] he will give in the ages to come and you
[1:41:23] can refuse the comfort that he has for
[1:41:26] you right
[1:41:28] now see it's on the same basis that we
[1:41:31] find that it'll become a great thing he
[1:41:32] says that's even become in Pentecost in
[1:41:35] the churches it's become into our Realms
[1:41:37] that they're always promising something
[1:41:39] that they never get
[1:41:43] to it's always every fellow has a
[1:41:45] different sensation and whether it's
[1:41:47] scripture or not and they're promising
[1:41:49] something that they never go get until
[1:41:53] it seems like they get to a place where
[1:41:54] there doesn't seem to be any
[1:41:57] sincerity the people don't get down to
[1:42:00] the real kernel of
[1:42:03] sincerity the very English word of
[1:42:05] sincerity has lost its value to the
[1:42:08] people and I I just want to say this I
[1:42:11] don't know what you've heard but I I I
[1:42:13] lost the value of sincerity because I
[1:42:16] listen to Somebody preach only part of
[1:42:19] the message and the part of the message
[1:42:22] that they picked out is where brother
[1:42:23] Braham says oh you can be sincere and
[1:42:25] been sincerely lost and go to
[1:42:28] hell and what was it was used for it was
[1:42:31] used to preach against sincerity because
[1:42:34] this particular person struggled with
[1:42:36] sincerity and I listened to it and for
[1:42:39] years and years I thought oh being
[1:42:41] sincere is okay but but you can be
[1:42:45] sincere and be lost and go to hell that
[1:42:47] was what was plugged plugged into my
[1:42:49] mind and what I lost was sincerity
[1:42:53] yeah and
[1:42:55] sincerity is the ability to take God and
[1:43:00] make him a god of today because you
[1:43:01] can't be you can't be sincere about
[1:43:04] tomorrow and you can't be sincere about
[1:43:05] yesterday sincerity comes from right
[1:43:09] now if somebody's talking to you you
[1:43:12] know whether being sincere or not
[1:43:13] because you know if they're really
[1:43:15] really present in what they're saying to
[1:43:17] you if they really believe what they're
[1:43:19] telling you right then you can sense
[1:43:21] sincerity from somebody
[1:43:23] but if if if they sound like oh yeah you
[1:43:25] know what you're you'll be healed no
[1:43:28] you'll be okay you'll be healed that
[1:43:30] doesn't sound very sincere right because
[1:43:31] they're putting God off into the future
[1:43:34] but if somebody says you know what I
[1:43:37] know what you're going
[1:43:38] through let's stop what we're doing
[1:43:41] right now and I'm going to kneel down
[1:43:43] with you and we're going to pray right
[1:43:44] now and I won't get up and you won't get
[1:43:47] up until God comes right now that's
[1:43:50] sincerity and you know what that gets
[1:43:52] res
[1:43:53] results it's not just about faith he
[1:43:56] says it's about being sincere with your
[1:43:58] faith and Faith the Bible says calls
[1:44:01] those things which are not which means
[1:44:04] it takes things that are in the
[1:44:08] future they haven't happened yet let's
[1:44:10] just list off some of them I I don't
[1:44:13] want to be cliche but let's list off
[1:44:15] some of the one healing Deliverance Holy
[1:44:18] Ghost those things that the devil would
[1:44:21] like to put into the future faith calls
[1:44:24] those things and says that they
[1:44:27] are it takes things that are not because
[1:44:31] they will be down the road oh I'm going
[1:44:32] to get that Deliverance down the road I
[1:44:34] believe for my healing down the road but
[1:44:36] faith says no that's now that's what
[1:44:38] real Faith does it takes things that
[1:44:40] that are not and says they are present
[1:44:44] tense faith is not satisfied that God
[1:44:48] will bring something to pass one day
[1:44:53] faith is only satisfied when it calls
[1:44:55] the things that God has for you into a
[1:44:58] present day
[1:45:01] situation and it connects you Faith
[1:45:03] connects you to a god of tomorrow and
[1:45:06] makes him an everpresent God of
[1:45:09] today and I I think and if he can just
[1:45:11] the devil can just get you to believe
[1:45:14] that God will heal you tomorrow he's one
[1:45:17] I don't I hope you can catch that if he
[1:45:19] can just get you to believe that he'll
[1:45:21] deliver you tomorrow
[1:45:23] he's got
[1:45:26] you how many wants the Holy
[1:45:30] Ghost if he can get you to believe that
[1:45:32] the Holy Ghost will come to you tomorrow
[1:45:35] or the next service or when you get good
[1:45:37] enough or when you get cleaned up or
[1:45:39] when the right preacher comes or when
[1:45:40] the right atmosphere is here he's
[1:45:43] one because God has the Holy Ghost
[1:45:46] according to this word for you
[1:45:49] today in your present condition he has
[1:45:53] the Holy Ghost for you
[1:45:57] today I do not I I do not want to be
[1:46:00] caught looking forward to a
[1:46:03] Rapture come on now if you're looking
[1:46:06] forward to a Rapture you won't realize
[1:46:09] it when it
[1:46:12] comes and and I want to be seeking I
[1:46:16] want to be expecting a Rapture today
[1:46:21] today because if we're really doing that
[1:46:23] if we expect and desire and want a
[1:46:27] Rapture I'm just going to say this a lot
[1:46:29] of people don't want a Rapture today and
[1:46:31] we know why because we're not
[1:46:33] ready is that the truth or
[1:46:36] no maybe if you don't want a Rapture
[1:46:39] today it might be because you're not
[1:46:41] ready for
[1:46:44] it but if you're seeking one expecting
[1:46:47] one today then your life will fall in
[1:46:51] line to be ready for a Rapture today as
[1:46:54] long as we can put it off for tomorrow I
[1:46:57] believe we live in the last days I
[1:46:59] believe we live in the last days it's
[1:47:00] according to the word but today could be
[1:47:03] the last
[1:47:05] day and how many times have we heard
[1:47:07] that over the years all the time right
[1:47:10] and one day it will be the last
[1:47:12] day there will be no tomorrow for me to
[1:47:16] prepare to be ready to go into a Rapture
[1:47:19] it will be gone and I will have missed
[1:47:21] it and the Bible says it comes
[1:47:23] as a thief in the
[1:47:26] night if you're not looking for it to
[1:47:29] happen today if you're not expecting it
[1:47:31] today if God is a good god who will
[1:47:33] Rapture you tomorrow you will miss the
[1:47:37] Rapture that's blunt but that's the
[1:47:40] truth he says man is always giving God
[1:47:43] praise for what he did do always looking
[1:47:46] forward to what he do and ignoring what
[1:47:48] he is doing that's the way they miss
[1:47:51] it they look back and see the great
[1:47:54] thing that he has done but they fail to
[1:47:56] see what a simple thing he used to do it
[1:48:00] with and then they look forward and see
[1:48:04] a great thing coming that's going to
[1:48:07] happen and nine times out of 10 it's
[1:48:11] already happening around
[1:48:13] them that's not my word that's his word
[1:48:16] god hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:48:17] revealing himself in the same 63 nine
[1:48:20] times out of 10 it's already happening
[1:48:23] right around them and it's so simple
[1:48:26] that they don't know
[1:48:28] it you might say it's not that simple uh
[1:48:32] the word of God tells us
[1:48:35] differently it is
[1:48:38] simple but we complicate
[1:48:41] it we make it mysterious we make it a
[1:48:45] thing and you know why I think we do
[1:48:47] this I I'm not telling you we're bad
[1:48:48] people I'm just telling you it's a
[1:48:50] nature that we have to fight you know
[1:48:52] why we make it complicated and we make
[1:48:53] it mysterious because then we can put it
[1:48:55] off to another
[1:48:57] day this is something so great that I
[1:49:01] hope one day to attain it you see what
[1:49:04] the devil has caused us to do to take
[1:49:06] the greatest thing and put it off for
[1:49:09] another
[1:49:11] day and God standing there with every
[1:49:14] Redemptive promise for you wanting to
[1:49:17] give you every single thing that he has
[1:49:19] in this Bible and might put them off
[1:49:22] until tomorrow
[1:49:24] is he a god of yesterday yes yes he's
[1:49:28] the same God that's that scripture he's
[1:49:30] the same God is he a god of tomorrow yes
[1:49:33] I'm not telling you he's not those
[1:49:35] things but he's a god of right
[1:49:38] now and I I don't want to be convinced
[1:49:42] any longer by a whisper in my ear that
[1:49:45] the thing that I desire is good just
[1:49:48] wait for
[1:49:50] it it's good that you want that now just
[1:49:53] wait for
[1:49:55] it I'll close with this he says in this
[1:49:58] he says brother brandom and God will you
[1:50:02] can never
[1:50:03] exhaust God's love and mercy to
[1:50:07] you you
[1:50:10] say he puts this in quotations and I I I
[1:50:13] had to laugh at it when I heard it
[1:50:14] because I think I've literally said this
[1:50:16] in prayer he says well I hate to bother
[1:50:19] you so much father
[1:50:23] anybody ever feel like they prayed to
[1:50:25] God a little bit and asking for too much
[1:50:26] or or Lord I'm so sorry to come to you
[1:50:29] again and ask for
[1:50:32] forgiveness I know you just forgave me I
[1:50:34] I know I told you that I wouldn't do it
[1:50:36] and here I am again asking forgiveness
[1:50:39] again for the same exact thing and devil
[1:50:42] will tell you oh
[1:50:45] again well he already forgave you for
[1:50:47] that I think you're you're good to go
[1:50:49] take you to a god of the past you know
[1:50:51] what he's a good God just do well re you
[1:50:54] know do well and he'll forgive you down
[1:50:56] the
[1:50:59] road well I hate to bother you so much
[1:51:02] father he wants to be bothered that
[1:51:06] way that's brother brandom's words he
[1:51:09] does don't ever think that you could
[1:51:12] ever ask too much of
[1:51:16] God I believe the scripture said you
[1:51:18] have not because you ask not and you ask
[1:51:20] not because you believe not he wants us
[1:51:23] to ask and believe that our Joys would
[1:51:25] be full he wants you to ask
[1:51:29] abundantly he says ask for big
[1:51:33] things don't limit your faith to some
[1:51:37] listen now do we believe in faith the
[1:51:39] size of a mustard seed Faith the size of
[1:51:42] a mustard seed the Bible says can move
[1:51:43] mountains that will do you no good if
[1:51:46] you think about oh eventually that
[1:51:48] Mountain's going to move no I'm looking
[1:51:50] for a mountain to move today
[1:51:55] he says don't limit your faith to some
[1:51:59] little Mustard
[1:52:02] Seed get on out here to some other kind
[1:52:05] of faith and move out in big things big
[1:52:08] things is just as easy to receive as
[1:52:12] little
[1:52:13] things and big things for God are just
[1:52:16] as easy to do as little
[1:52:18] things why because he's the same God
[1:52:24] you just have to believe that's all and
[1:52:26] you've got to have faith and know
[1:52:29] exactly how to use it and it'll be all
[1:52:31] right you can put it right to work don't
[1:52:33] put it to work tomorrow put it right to
[1:52:36] work and it'll be just fine could you
[1:52:38] imagine talking about God exhausting
[1:52:40] God's love and power and benefits for
[1:52:43] you could you imagine a little bitty
[1:52:45] fish about that long way out here in the
[1:52:47] middle of the ocean say now wait a
[1:52:48] minute I better consider this thing I
[1:52:51] better drink of this water sparingly cuz
[1:52:53] I might run out someday a little fish
[1:52:56] about that big in the middle of the
[1:52:57] ocean out there well that could easily
[1:53:00] be
[1:53:01] done more easy than you could ask too

[2:03:52] would you share the testimonies of the
[2:03:54] two healings that you shared with us
[2:03:56] last
[2:03:57] night is a present day
[2:04:01] God I think there was some here at that
[2:04:03] camp they could witness to some of these
[2:04:05] you can continue playing s
[2:04:07] Lou we had a meeting last
[2:04:11] week there in Ohio they had a prayer
[2:04:15] line and uh the first I think uh those
[2:04:19] that that were there know there was a
[2:04:21] young man that that was uh they were
[2:04:23] kind of wrestling messing around and
[2:04:26] broke his ankle fractured it in two
[2:04:29] places just completely bent over his
[2:04:31] ankle sideways and this happened
[2:04:33] Thursday or Wednesday night or Thursday
[2:04:35] morning and they took him to the
[2:04:36] hospital sure enough scan show broken
[2:04:40] put him in a cast he was for 2 three
[2:04:42] days just walking around um with
[2:04:46] crutches we had a prayer line Saturday
[2:04:48] night and it's it's it's not
[2:04:52] it's not because there's any Minister
[2:04:54] there or any certain person there it's
[2:04:55] because God was
[2:04:56] there and it's because there was an
[2:04:59] expectation of people that Lord I need
[2:05:03] you right now and that young man went
[2:05:05] through that prayer line and he got to
[2:05:07] the end of the prayer line and he sat
[2:05:08] down and he took his cast
[2:05:10] off and he started jumping up and down
[2:05:13] he started walking around and for the
[2:05:15] rest of that week and never never even
[2:05:18] limped God literally healed a bone like
[2:05:21] that
[2:05:24] that's a God that's a God that I serve I
[2:05:28] think that's the god that you serve and
[2:05:30] the other one is is personal to me and
[2:05:33] is uh my daughter and she gave this
[2:05:34] testimony Wednesday night at our church
[2:05:37] but my daughter had had a she had a cyst
[2:05:39] on her hand a a a large painful lump for
[2:05:43] about five months on her hand and we had
[2:05:45] taken to the doctor and the doctor said
[2:05:47] you know you're going to have to have an
[2:05:48] operation it's it's it's hardened it's
[2:05:51] it's calcified I can't just take this
[2:05:53] liquid out of there you have to go in
[2:05:55] for more scans and you have to schedule
[2:05:57] a surgery my daughter went through that
[2:05:59] same prayer line she tell me she's like
[2:06:00] I didn't think about the pain in my hand
[2:06:03] she's like I've lived with it for four
[2:06:04] five six months it's it hurts it hurts
[2:06:06] to the touch she's like I never even
[2:06:08] thought about it she came through the
[2:06:09] prayer line and Something Told her look
[2:06:11] down at your
[2:06:12] hand and she looked down and it was
[2:06:14] completely gone
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:22] there was no
[2:06:23] bruise there was no blemish there was
[2:06:27] you couldn't even tell where it was at
[2:06:29] before and I was a witness on Friday I
[2:06:32] saw it because she came up to me and
[2:06:33] said it was just it was in pain more
[2:06:35] than normal I saw it on Friday and
[2:06:37] Saturday it was gone and she said I
[2:06:40] never even went through the prayer line
[2:06:41] with that on my mind and and I just told
[2:06:43] her that's the
[2:06:45] benefits of being a child of
[2:06:48] God that even things that you don't ask
[2:06:52] for even maybe even something you don't
[2:06:54] even know that you need not only will he
[2:06:57] answer your prayers he'll give you on
[2:06:59] top of
[2:07:00] that and originally she didn't you know
[2:07:03] she was a little hesitant maybe to go
[2:07:05] through the prayer line but she gave
[2:07:07] control to God she gave control to him
[2:07:10] and just said I'm going to I'm going to
[2:07:12] go get hands laid on we believe in it
[2:07:14] and that's what God did for her and
[2:07:15] that's the God that I serve
[2:07:17] today and I know he's just as real today
[2:07:20] as he is a week ago as he was then in
[2:07:23] that meeting as he was 50 years ago in
[2:07:25] brother bram's meetings I I I I if I
[2:07:28] didn't believe that I couldn't get up
[2:07:29] here and I couldn't talk to you if I
[2:07:30] don't believe that same God and I know
[2:07:32] you do too let's
[2:07:35] just keep them before us today I know
[2:07:38] you believe in the same God I do let's
[2:07:40] not be
[2:07:42] tricked into putting it off till
[2:07:44] tomorrow that's all I'm saying let's not
[2:07:46] be tricked in just God you were good
[2:07:48] yesterday you're going to be good
[2:07:49] tomorrow but I need you today amen those
[2:07:52] are those two testimonies I told them
[2:07:54] last night I hope that's okay to share
[2:07:56] [Music]
[2:08:00] [Applause]
[2:08:02] so he's the same yesterday
[2:08:06] today and
[2:08:09] forever I never looked at that and today
[2:08:13] it's easy to look at the god of the past
[2:08:15] and think of the god of the
[2:08:17] future I'm not guaranteed tomorrow I
[2:08:21] have today that's right let him be
[2:08:24] present
[2:08:26] today I know if I say raise your hand if
[2:08:29] you have a
[2:08:30] need there'd be very few hands that
[2:08:33] wouldn't get
[2:08:33] raised oh brother the need is so small
[2:08:37] it's still in
[2:08:40] need if you can believe
[2:08:42] [Music]
[2:08:45] stand you've already done something to
[2:08:48] claim that
[2:08:50] promise that's right
[2:08:52] if you can believe God to touch you
[2:08:53] right now raise both
[2:08:57] hands and see if God won't won't begin
[2:09:00] and you know what the thing to do is
[2:09:02] begin to thank him yes that's right
[2:09:04] you've already done it that's right it
[2:09:06] was already taken care of by his stripes
[2:09:10] you were
[2:09:11] healed he's not saying hold on I've got
[2:09:15] to go see if I still have the remedy
[2:09:17] it's already been done amen you can have
[2:09:21] what you have need of if you can
