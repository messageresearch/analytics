[52:03] ago
[52:05] that
[52:07] um my uh I was able to to marry the love
[52:10] of my
[52:11] life and I was thinking about that
[52:14] yesterday morning we we have a 25 year
[52:16] anniversary coming
[52:17] up and uh I got up early in the morning
[52:21] and I checked the news and and I had a
[52:24] we have a trip plann to
[52:26] Israel and and
[52:30] uh we were uh we've been excited about
[52:32] it got the the places rented got the
[52:36] hotels rented or the condos rented and
[52:38] got the tickets and all this and I and I
[52:41] opened up the U my iPad yesterday and I
[52:44] looked at the news and I saw that there
[52:47] was this great war that had
[52:52] started and every there was hundred
[52:55] hundreds of people killed already there
[52:56] were hostages taking and all of this and
[52:59] I must admit and I hate to say it but I
[53:01] must admit my my first thought was oh
[53:04] great what about my
[53:07] anniversary and and I thought we have
[53:10] this big highrise rented um in Jerusalem
[53:14] and it's overlooking the old city of
[53:16] Jerusalem and I just couldn't wait to
[53:18] get up there and show Stephanie this and
[53:20] there's a b big window there and my
[53:21] first thought was I guarantee you
[53:23] there's this Palestinian with a rocket
[53:25] launcher looking at that big building
[53:27] saying I think I can hit that and and
[53:30] then after a while I thought
[53:33] Lord this is a serious thing and like
[53:38] like most people in the world today
[53:40] first thing I thought of was I thought
[53:41] of myself
[53:43] greetings God God bless you welcome
[53:46] coming with the with the Salazar family
[53:48] it's good to see you um I was first
[53:52] thinking of
[53:53] myself and and all of this and how often
[53:58] especially we Americans how often we
[53:59] think of ourselves
[54:02] before anything else in the world and I
[54:06] was as I was looking at this in this big
[54:09] war it's the first time in 50 years that
[54:13] Israel has declared
[54:17] war and we look at what's going on there
[54:20] and we know we've been told that Israel
[54:23] is God's time
[54:27] so thinking of of the The Killing and
[54:31] the death and all that's going going on
[54:33] there I know I think what is
[54:37] wrong with these people why do they have
[54:41] this Lust For Blood and this hatred for
[54:45] these Jewish people and I know that
[54:47] there's two sides to every story but
[54:50] there is an unnatural
[54:52] hatred for the Jewish people it happened
[54:56] we saw it with Hitler when he and Stalin
[54:58] when they killed millions of them and I
[55:01] thought what is this that's going
[55:05] on and my mind went back to
[55:09] Jesus and Jesus was prophesying before
[55:13] his second coming he says as it was in
[55:17] the days of
[55:18] Noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[55:21] man son of man so shall it be when we
[55:24] see the second coming of
[55:26] Christ so you look at what was going on
[55:29] in Noah's time and there there was
[55:33] violence the Bible says violence had
[55:35] spread the Earth killing and so much so
[55:39] that that God looked down and and he
[55:41] said that that he grieved him that he
[55:44] had ever even made men to see what was
[55:48] going on now look at what's going on
[55:50] over there in Israel and then just this
[55:52] lust for killing as as many as we can
[55:55] kill as fast as we can kill kill them
[55:58] kill them kill them and you think wow
[56:00] this is exactly what Jesus prophesied
[56:03] was going to come to
[56:05] pass and then he said also in those days
[56:08] of Noah that they were eating and
[56:11] drinking and marrying and giving in
[56:14] marriage they were going along just the
[56:16] way that that they had always gone not
[56:18] have a care in the world not living for
[56:21] the Lord just just living their lives
[56:24] and and God flooded the
[56:27] Earth and destroyed all the people
[56:30] except eight people that came into the
[56:32] ark seeing that these times are
[56:37] supposed to repeat themselves and then
[56:41] Jesus goes on in Matthew or in Luke 17
[56:44] and he says and as it was in the days of
[56:48] lot so shall it be in the coming of the
[56:52] son of man we look what happened with
[56:55] lot God rained
[56:58] down fire from heaven and destroyed
[57:02] these sinful cities because of their
[57:05] sexual immorality and and the way that
[57:08] they live their lives and the disgusting
[57:10] nature that they had and we look at the
[57:14] the time of lot which was the time of
[57:18] Abraham and we see that these immoral
[57:23] people they ruled
[57:25] lot was afraid of them if you didn't
[57:28] know if if you read the story lot was
[57:31] intimidated by this mob that came to his
[57:34] house and he was the governor of the
[57:37] city and Jesus said that these times
[57:41] would repeat again in the last
[57:45] day looking at what's around us and and
[57:50] looking at the violence that's going on
[57:52] in Israel I thought it'd be good before
[57:55] I really get into my sermon it'd be good
[57:57] to maybe give a history on these Jewish
[58:00] people and where they came from and I
[58:03] think that you'll
[58:05] see that the handwriting is on the wall
[58:09] of what's about to
[58:11] happen it was 6,000 years
[58:14] ago right at the
[58:17] dawn of
[58:19] mankind that God had created man and
[58:24] created him a
[58:25] wife and there they are in the Garden of
[58:29] Eden and they fell into
[58:33] sin God tells Adam and Eve he says that
[58:38] I've created all of this for you and
[58:40] enjoy everything that's here but just
[58:43] don't eat of the fruit of this one tree
[58:46] just don't do this one thing because if
[58:49] you do that then you will
[58:52] die so
[58:55] goes on as human nature is maybe the
[58:58] Curiosity of what he was talking about
[59:01] happened we know that Eve fell and then
[59:03] she caused Adam to fall and then God was
[59:07] looking at them looking for them in the
[59:09] Garden of Eden and he saw that they were
[59:12] hiding in the in the bushes there and
[59:14] that they were
[59:17] embarrassed and God saw that they had
[59:21] sinned so God goes and to atone for that
[59:26] sin to cover their nakedness to cover
[59:29] their sin God goes and he kills an
[59:34] animal probably I would think that it
[59:36] was a
[59:37] lamb he kills this animal to cover their
[59:44] sin to
[59:46] stay to put off the wrath of God because
[59:50] remember he said you will
[59:53] die so so he takes this and he he he
[59:56] makes he he he kills this animal and he
[59:58] makes the very first sacrifice we've
[1:00:02] heard of sacrifice the Jewish sacrifices
[1:00:05] that is the very first sacrifice that
[1:00:07] was ever made and it was God that made
[1:00:08] it
[1:00:10] himself then time goes on and I want you
[1:00:12] to remember the numbers as I speak time
[1:00:16] goes on and I just talked about Noah and
[1:00:19] how God had destroyed the the Earth and
[1:00:22] then then they they after no they
[1:00:24] multiply again and then they build this
[1:00:27] Tower of Babel and it's just sin is
[1:00:29] covering the Earth
[1:00:31] and it there was violence and there was
[1:00:34] sin and immorality and there was
[1:00:36] idolatry idol
[1:00:39] worship and then 2,000 years after that
[1:00:44] original
[1:00:46] sin there came a
[1:00:48] man that stood against
[1:00:51] idolatry there came a man that God God
[1:00:55] spoke to he saw this great character in
[1:00:57] The in this man named
[1:01:01] Abraham God speaks to this man and he
[1:01:04] makes a covenant with his Abraham
[1:01:07] Abraham and his wife as you know they
[1:01:09] couldn't have
[1:01:10] children God makes this Covenant with
[1:01:13] Abraham he says Abraham I will create in
[1:01:19] you Nations and if you look up at the
[1:01:22] stars your deed will be more than the
[1:01:25] stars of the sky and here's a man that
[1:01:27] had never even had
[1:01:29] children and he says from you will come
[1:01:33] this line and this nation that any this
[1:01:37] nation will not only be the greatest
[1:01:39] nation ever but it will bless all the
[1:01:42] other
[1:01:43] nations a promise to this man
[1:01:47] Abraham so
[1:01:52] Abraham he had met
[1:01:55] this man that had told them these
[1:01:59] things was God King and talked with
[1:02:04] Abraham
[1:02:06] himself in this mysterious
[1:02:10] man called
[1:02:12] mzc and how mzc had come and talk to
[1:02:15] Abraham under this oak tree and Abraham
[1:02:17] knew that this was God God had appeared
[1:02:21] once
[1:02:22] again to a man 2,000 years after the
[1:02:28] original Abraham has a son named
[1:02:32] Isaac then he has another son or then
[1:02:35] Isaac has a son named
[1:02:38] Jacob and in this man Jacob God gives
[1:02:42] him 12 sons and these Sons create from
[1:02:47] these Sons God makes this greatest
[1:02:50] nation ever he changes this man's
[1:02:53] Jacob's name to to
[1:02:55] Israel and through the children of
[1:02:59] Israel God creates this great nation
[1:03:03] that is blessed beyond measure and as
[1:03:07] time goes on this man Jacob named Israel
[1:03:10] he says that through you
[1:03:13] Israel that through your
[1:03:17] lineage will come the Redeemer of
[1:03:21] mankind will come the sacrifice that
[1:03:26] will atone for the sins
[1:03:28] like was set forth in the Garden of
[1:03:32] Eden but this one won't be something to
[1:03:36] just stay the wrath of God this will be
[1:03:39] the Redeemer that will take all the sins
[1:03:42] of mankind upon himself called the
[1:03:46] Messiah as time goes
[1:03:49] on from that 2,000 years then the time
[1:03:52] starts ticking and it goes goes on to
[1:03:55] this man
[1:03:58] David who becomes this great king of
[1:04:02] this newly formed nation of
[1:04:04] Israel and then God says that that this
[1:04:08] man David was a man after his own heart
[1:04:11] and through this man's lineage this man
[1:04:14] David's lineage that he will bring
[1:04:16] another king of Israel that King is that
[1:04:19] same one that was spoken of earlier was
[1:04:21] the very
[1:04:23] Messiah and then as time goes
[1:04:28] on the prophets begin to
[1:04:32] prophesy they prophesy about this coming
[1:04:35] Messiah how this Redeemer this kinsman
[1:04:37] redeemer is going to come year after
[1:04:41] year decade after decade hundreds of
[1:04:43] years
[1:04:44] pass and
[1:04:46] then what we call the Old
[1:04:50] Testament
[1:04:52] closes with a prophet
[1:04:55] the very
[1:04:57] last
[1:04:59] words in the Old Testament Malachi
[1:05:02] chapter 4 it says this for behold the
[1:05:04] day
[1:05:05] cometh that shall burn as an oven and
[1:05:07] all the proud yay and all that do
[1:05:09] wickedly shall be
[1:05:11] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[1:05:13] burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts
[1:05:15] that it shall leave them neither root
[1:05:17] nor Branch but unto you that fear my
[1:05:20] name shall the son of righteousness
[1:05:21] arise with healing in his wings and you
[1:05:24] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[1:05:26] the stall and ye shall tread down the
[1:05:28] wicked for they shall be ashes Under The
[1:05:30] Souls of your feet in the day that I
[1:05:33] shall do this sayeth the Lord of hosts
[1:05:36] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[1:05:38] which I commanded unto him in Horeb for
[1:05:40] all Israel with the statutes and
[1:05:43] judgments behold I will send you Elijah
[1:05:46] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:05:47] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[1:05:50] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[1:05:52] to the children and the Heart of the
[1:05:54] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:05:59] and smite the Earth with the
[1:06:03] curse almost 2,000 years had passed
[1:06:07] since this man
[1:06:09] Abraham this man
[1:06:11] Malachi prophesies this then 2,000
[1:06:16] years after Abraham comes the
[1:06:19] Fulfillment of all of the prophecies
[1:06:24] about this Lamb of God one of the
[1:06:27] prophecies was a virgin shall conceive
[1:06:29] by the prophet
[1:06:31] Isaiah and
[1:06:33] then this
[1:06:35] virgin named Mary has a
[1:06:38] child his name is
[1:06:42] Jesus and he
[1:06:46] redeems all of Israel of their
[1:06:50] sins yet he came to his own own people
[1:06:55] but his own people this country that
[1:06:57] we're seeing out there didn't receive
[1:07:00] him it was a very strange thing the one
[1:07:02] that they had been praying for the one
[1:07:04] that' be looking for the one that they
[1:07:05] had prophesied would come he comes and
[1:07:09] the ones his own
[1:07:11] people didn't even receive him they said
[1:07:13] he was
[1:07:14] false and it because of their way of
[1:07:16] thinking it was because that they had
[1:07:18] gotten ingrained sin so much had covered
[1:07:21] the Earth this time before it was
[1:07:23] idolatry
[1:07:24] and it was it was immorality this time
[1:07:27] sin had covered the Earth so much and
[1:07:28] now it was a self-righteous
[1:07:31] Holiness stubborn spirit that was there
[1:07:35] and that was the spirit that said we
[1:07:37] won't receive
[1:07:39] him so
[1:07:42] then these this
[1:07:45] man his disciples and those that
[1:07:47] believed him began to preach his
[1:07:50] message around
[1:07:52] Jerusalem around Israel the places that
[1:07:55] we're looking at
[1:07:58] now and God
[1:08:02] caused what's called a slumber he call
[1:08:05] caused a
[1:08:07] sleep to come upon the Jewish people and
[1:08:11] upon the Jewish Nation it's written here
[1:08:14] in Romans 11 verse 7 one of these
[1:08:18] Apostles is speaking one of these
[1:08:20] Apostles that was that really got the
[1:08:24] message out of Jesus Christ This Man
[1:08:26] Paul who was the one who spearheaded the
[1:08:30] message going out across the
[1:08:32] world he says
[1:08:35] this he says what then Israel hath not
[1:08:39] obtained that which he seeketh
[1:08:41] for but the election hath obtained it
[1:08:45] and the rest were
[1:08:46] blinded according as it is written God
[1:08:49] hath given them the Spirit of
[1:08:51] Slumber eyes that they should not not
[1:08:54] see and ears that they should not hear
[1:08:56] unto this
[1:08:58] day and David saith let their table be
[1:09:02] made a snare and a trap and a stumbling
[1:09:05] block and and a recompense unto them and
[1:09:08] let their eyes be darkened that they may
[1:09:10] not see and their bow and bow down their
[1:09:14] back all way I say then have they
[1:09:17] stumbled that they should
[1:09:19] fall God
[1:09:22] forbid but rather through their
[1:09:26] fall salvation is come unto the
[1:09:31] Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy
[1:09:34] now if the fall of them be the riches of
[1:09:37] the world and the diminishing of the
[1:09:39] riches of the Gentiles how much more the
[1:09:42] fullness and as I
[1:09:44] stated 2,000 years had passed so there
[1:09:47] was 2,000 years from Adam to God
[1:09:50] visiting Abraham and starting this great
[1:09:53] nation
[1:09:54] of Israel and then from from Abraham to
[1:09:58] Jesus was 2,000 years and then we see
[1:10:01] God move away from this nation Israel
[1:10:05] blinded them as the Bible says caused
[1:10:07] them to fall
[1:10:10] asleep and he goes to this group of
[1:10:13] people that were never considered one of
[1:10:17] God's God's people they're always
[1:10:19] considered
[1:10:21] heathens in the Old Testament so God
[1:10:24] goes to those people and then the
[1:10:28] message starts spreading around the
[1:10:31] world this message of Jesus Christ a
[1:10:34] redeemer and he wasn't just to the
[1:10:36] Jewish people he was to us too and we
[1:10:39] can have our sins
[1:10:41] forgiven it was CA called the Gentile
[1:10:44] dispensation many of you have heard that
[1:10:46] word but that's a dispensing or a giv
[1:10:50] out giving out of the Gospel to the
[1:10:53] Gentile group with the Jews over here
[1:10:58] blinded
[1:10:59] sleeping not seeing all of
[1:11:04] this we go we go through and there's
[1:11:08] throughout history we see people like
[1:11:11] irenius and Martin and and and these
[1:11:15] Great Men of God St Patrick and these
[1:11:21] men and John Wesley and Martin Luther
[1:11:23] these men that continued spreading this
[1:11:27] Gospel of Jesus Christ and it just went
[1:11:30] around the
[1:11:31] world expanded and expanded and expanded
[1:11:36] until now when it's stopped for the
[1:11:41] first time in 2,000 years the Christian
[1:11:44] church was once this great it started to
[1:11:49] shrink less people coming to church less
[1:11:54] people wanting salvation less of a
[1:11:58] desire for to to have their sins
[1:12:01] forgiven and that's where we stand today
[1:12:04] Christianity is
[1:12:06] shrinking God is beginning to turn his
[1:12:12] eyes from them from
[1:12:15] us back to his promised people which are
[1:12:19] the Jews there was a
[1:12:21] man one of the greatest Jewish rabbis in
[1:12:25] modern history lived in Jerusalem he was
[1:12:28] born in around 1900 back then you don't
[1:12:30] know exactly when you're born brother
[1:12:33] brandham said even brother brandham even
[1:12:34] said he didn't know exactly when he was
[1:12:36] born he said it's marked by something
[1:12:38] like that's when the big oak tree fell
[1:12:40] is is the year that that uh he was born
[1:12:44] this man named Rabbi Yak
[1:12:48] kaduri he's considered a prophet in
[1:12:52] Israel
[1:12:54] he's born around 1900 he died in January
[1:12:57] of
[1:12:59] 2006 2
[1:13:02] 100,000 people lined the streets of
[1:13:06] Jerusalem at his
[1:13:08] funeral that's how much he was respected
[1:13:11] and regarded as a man of
[1:13:14] God before he
[1:13:17] died he took a piece of
[1:13:19] paper and he wrote on
[1:13:22] it
[1:13:24] that God has told me who the Messiah
[1:13:26] is he sealed
[1:13:29] it and he said don't open it until one
[1:13:33] year after I
[1:13:34] die that was in
[1:13:38] 2006
[1:13:41] 2007 they take this man of God they take
[1:13:45] this note that he
[1:13:48] wrote they open it
[1:13:52] up
[1:13:55] Yeshua Jesus is the Christ and he is
[1:13:59] returning
[1:14:04] again we see this is a respected Rabbi
[1:14:08] no they didn't all they didn't all
[1:14:09] believe it we see that the focus is
[1:14:15] beginning to change to these
[1:14:18] people this Jewish
[1:14:21] nation and we look at
[1:14:25] us and we get so many people they get
[1:14:28] caught up in the
[1:14:31] Jews the Jews are an alarm clock they're
[1:14:35] a Time piece and when your alarm clock
[1:14:38] goes off in the morning don't just sit
[1:14:41] there and stare at
[1:14:44] it that's not going to do you any
[1:14:47] good get up get up and get to work you
[1:14:52] got to go am the alarm is telling you

[1:15:01] day and look at this it's 5:30 wow it's
[1:15:05] time to get
[1:15:08] up
[1:15:10] Timothy Paul's last
[1:15:13] letter Paul the last thing the Apostle
[1:15:15] Paul
[1:15:16] wrote he was just about to go to his
[1:15:21] execution and Paul writes this
[1:15:24] to Timothy for the Gentile
[1:15:28] Church 2 Timothy 3:1 he says
[1:15:32] this this know also that in the last
[1:15:35] days perilous times shall come for men
[1:15:38] shall be lovers of their own
[1:15:42] selves it seems so normal to us for men
[1:15:45] should be lovers of their own selves men
[1:15:49] this word men means people they shall be
[1:15:52] lovers of Their Own own
[1:15:54] selves Instagram
[1:15:56] Snapchat
[1:15:58] Facebook putting a shrine up of
[1:16:02] themselves so everyone could see can see
[1:16:06] it loving
[1:16:09] myself covetor and boaster pl proud
[1:16:12] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:16:14] unthankful
[1:16:15] Unholy without natural
[1:16:19] affection truth
[1:16:21] Breakers think about what just happened
[1:16:23] in Our House of
[1:16:24] Representatives what an odd thing never
[1:16:27] happened before in the history of the
[1:16:28] United
[1:16:29] States they kick out a
[1:16:32] speaker for the vote of a few people in
[1:16:36] his party and you have another party
[1:16:38] that is so divisive they will not budge
[1:16:42] neither of them neither side will budge
[1:16:44] so this group of of Representatives
[1:16:48] decides that they are going to kick out
[1:16:51] this speaker and what had happened the
[1:16:55] speaker and the former speaker had made
[1:17:00] an agreement and she made him a
[1:17:02] promise she said if there's any problems
[1:17:06] she said we will stand with you being
[1:17:09] the Democrat
[1:17:11] side so when the vote comes up before
[1:17:14] the house what does she do and what do
[1:17:16] they all do they break their
[1:17:20] Covenant nope we're going to kick you
[1:17:22] out
[1:17:23] we're going to stand with the other ones
[1:17:26] truce Breakers false accusers
[1:17:30] incontinent losing their temper at every
[1:17:32] little thing you can't tell me what to
[1:17:36] do fierce despisers of those that are
[1:17:40] good traitors heady high-minded lovers
[1:17:43] of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:17:46] God let me just ask you don't have to
[1:17:49] raise your
[1:17:52] hand
[1:17:54] I don't think yeah no probably
[1:17:56] not how many people spend more
[1:18:01] time looking at things on YouTube that
[1:18:04] are not of God than you do looking at
[1:18:06] things that are of
[1:18:08] God how many people here ask yourself
[1:18:12] how much time do I
[1:18:14] spend time that I have I can do whatever
[1:18:18] I want how much time do I spend looking
[1:18:20] at something that is not of God versus
[1:18:23] looking at the things that are of
[1:18:26] God judge
[1:18:29] yourself having a form of godliness but
[1:18:31] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:18:34] away for of this sort are they which
[1:18:37] creep into houses and Le lead captives
[1:18:39] silly women Laden with sins and led away
[1:18:41] with divers lust ever learning and never
[1:18:44] able to come to the knowledge of the
[1:18:46] truth and there has never been a
[1:18:50] generation until now that had so much
[1:18:54] access to the knowledge as we do
[1:18:56] anything I want to
[1:18:58] know I ask
[1:19:00] Google and that guy wow he tells me
[1:19:05] everything that I want to know ever
[1:19:09] learning and never able to come to the
[1:19:12] knowledge of the
[1:19:16] truth that's what Paul is writing to
[1:19:19] Timothy saying hey these times are
[1:19:21] coming it's so common us it looks so
[1:19:23] normal to us because we grew up in it or
[1:19:27] it's just it's just slid right in but it
[1:19:31] should be the alarm clock going
[1:19:34] off something's
[1:19:36] happening this thing over in
[1:19:39] Israel this may not be it but you see
[1:19:44] the spirit as it was in the days of
[1:19:47] Noah the violence was everywhere and the
[1:19:50] hatred for these people they won't stop
[1:19:53] until those Jews are
[1:19:56] dead
[1:19:57] why it's a warning
[1:20:00] sign it's a sign that God is on the way
[1:20:05] that this second coming of Christ is
[1:20:08] right at
[1:20:10] hand and as I said before it's easy to
[1:20:13] get distracted with Israel I went over
[1:20:16] there and and I was just looking around
[1:20:20] I was like man it looks feels like the
[1:20:23] sun's
[1:20:24] brighter it feels like the food tastes
[1:20:27] better it feels like just everything it
[1:20:29] just feels better here and I can see
[1:20:33] that someone could get caught up with
[1:20:36] that and they start looking at Israel
[1:20:38] and then they that becomes their focus
[1:20:41] and then they want to try to be
[1:20:44] that we are not most of us
[1:20:48] Jewish we're
[1:20:51] Gentiles that isn't for us it's
[1:20:54] different and we are different people
[1:20:57] but what it is is it's an alarm saying
[1:21:00] get ready but as I said don't just stare
[1:21:02] at the alarm
[1:21:03] clock get up and do something get up and
[1:21:07] get to
[1:21:09] work I had a
[1:21:11] friend Jewish old Jewish man that had
[1:21:16] given his heart to the Lord and and one
[1:21:17] of the most influential people on me
[1:21:20] that in my whole life and he was from
[1:21:24] Jerusalem he lived there for a long time
[1:21:26] he gave his heart to the Lord he he
[1:21:27] heard about brother brandom's message
[1:21:29] and he started believing that and he had
[1:21:31] just this message just became his life
[1:21:35] and he and I were talk Talking we talked
[1:21:37] very
[1:21:38] often and he'd tell me he'd say why do
[1:21:43] you want to be
[1:21:45] bride he said the Jews are Jesus's
[1:21:51] Brethren and and I was like you know I
[1:21:53] never thought about
[1:21:54] that but I want to be
[1:21:57] bride and he's said oh you're you know
[1:21:59] you're you're you're just the Gentiles
[1:22:01] you're descendants of
[1:22:03] ham I was like
[1:22:06] ham he say
[1:22:10] ham and he you get upset at the Gentiles
[1:22:14] he said this book he said this new
[1:22:17] testament he said it's a Jewish book he
[1:22:20] said they're all Jews Matthew Mark Luke
[1:22:24] J John maybe not Luke but at least
[1:22:27] partially John Peter Paul they're
[1:22:32] Jews and he says why did he go to the
[1:22:35] Gentiles he said and he quote Romans he
[1:22:37] said they were blinded he said but it's
[1:22:39] coming back to the
[1:22:41] Jews and we would he and I would we had
[1:22:45] spirited conversations and and he' he'd
[1:22:48] say why do you want to be
[1:22:50] bride and I was like well
[1:22:53] you get to live in the
[1:22:55] palace with the
[1:22:57] bridegroom no no he says no you be his
[1:23:01] Brethren why would you want to be so it
[1:23:03] was it was a different way of thinking
[1:23:05] and the Jewish people have a different
[1:23:08] way of looking at things look at
[1:23:12] Abraham God says I'm gonna destroy it
[1:23:15] could you Siri said I heard me talk
[1:23:19] about
[1:23:20] Abraham sorry she there
[1:23:23] everywhere if it's not Google it's Siri
[1:23:26] maybe they'll get
[1:23:28] married
[1:23:31] but we we look at these things and and
[1:23:36] we are different people look at Abraham
[1:23:40] look at the way that Abraham was God
[1:23:43] says I'm going to destroy Sodom and he's
[1:23:46] like what about if you found
[1:23:48] 50 what about if you found 40 30 20 10
[1:23:53] you and
[1:23:54] me we're not going to talk to God that
[1:23:58] way Lord yes what can I do to get my
[1:24:02] family out of there that's our attitude
[1:24:05] but the Jewish people and the gentile
[1:24:07] people they look at things differently
[1:24:09] and we shouldn't try to be
[1:24:12] them but now this time is changing from
[1:24:16] the Gentile dispensation and it's moving
[1:24:19] it's going to move back to the Jews and
[1:24:22] the alarm clock is going off and as I
[1:24:25] said don't just stare at the alarm
[1:24:28] clock it's not going to do any good to
[1:24:31] just stare at it turn it off and get
[1:24:34] up the alarm clock's telling you every
[1:24:37] morning Monday through Friday or
[1:24:39] whatever it is you got to get up and go
[1:24:41] to work and that's the same with us we
[1:24:45] see what I just read in second Timothy
[1:24:49] it's a sign of what's Happening
[1:24:52] happening in the world today another
[1:24:55] sign I read Malachi 4 there is Jesus and
[1:24:59] Jesus himself says this John the Baptist
[1:25:03] that was sent they come to Jesus and
[1:25:06] they said they said
[1:25:07] hey we read
[1:25:10] Malachi and we thought that uh Elijah
[1:25:13] was supposed to come
[1:25:15] first you know what Jesus says he says
[1:25:17] he did come and you missed
[1:25:19] him to turn the heart of the father
[1:25:22] fathers to the
[1:25:24] children and he left out the other part
[1:25:26] of Malachi
[1:25:28] 4 the part about about the walking out
[1:25:31] on the ashes of the wicked and burning
[1:25:33] as as an oven and all that hasn't
[1:25:35] happened yet Jesus left part of that to
[1:25:37] go to
[1:25:40] today to turn the heart of the children
[1:25:44] back to that of Peter and James and John
[1:25:49] back to receiving that Holy Spirit
[1:25:52] and we see wow this is happening has
[1:25:57] happened in our time it's another alarm
[1:26:00] clock that's going off but don't stop
[1:26:02] and just stare at the alarm clock it's
[1:26:05] telling us something get up and get to
[1:26:10] work be up and
[1:26:16] doing
[1:26:18] I I look
[1:26:21] at the there's so
[1:26:23] much there's so much to
[1:26:26] do there's so many people that need they
[1:26:30] need us I
[1:26:32] was the other day I was talking with I
[1:26:35] think I was talking with um maybe
[1:26:37] Stephanie forgot who it was but we're
[1:26:40] talking about this time and getting to
[1:26:45] the finish
[1:26:47] line and I was I said it's like all of
[1:26:50] us let's say all of this in
[1:26:52] in this church or let's say just this
[1:26:55] row here and me we're all chained
[1:26:58] together and we've got to get across the
[1:27:01] finish line down
[1:27:03] there I can only
[1:27:06] go as fast as the slowest person that's
[1:27:10] chained to me and the F the fastest
[1:27:13] person can only go as fast as the
[1:27:15] slowest person we have to get all
[1:27:18] together and get across this Finish
[1:27:23] Line the Bible
[1:27:26] says
[1:27:28] that those of us that are strong should
[1:27:31] bear the infirmities of those that are
[1:27:35] weak so if we're all coming to an end
[1:27:39] that we're coming to the end of this
[1:27:40] Gentile dispensation when God's going to
[1:27:42] turn his his eyes from us if you knew
[1:27:46] that it's going to happen I suggest that
[1:27:49] you start getting people picking them up
[1:27:51] and carry I'm going across the Finish
[1:27:54] Line because if you don't whether we're
[1:27:57] chained or not there's going to be a lot
[1:27:59] of people that don't make
[1:28:01] it if we see this alarm we see God's
[1:28:04] alarm going off let's get it
[1:28:10] moving there this
[1:28:13] church there are many people that should
[1:28:16] be
[1:28:17] here that need to be here that you all
[1:28:20] know that would benefit from knowing the
[1:28:24] Lord that would benefit from fellowship
[1:28:26] that would benefit from each other
[1:28:27] there's many people that you know that
[1:28:30] need to be here what if his eyes turn
[1:28:33] and time's over you've lost them you've
[1:28:36] lost
[1:28:37] them because you didn't pick them up and
[1:28:39] carry them across the finish line I'm
[1:28:40] not saying they have to come to this
[1:28:42] church this is just our church but they
[1:28:45] have to get to
[1:28:46] Christ but before you can get them to
[1:28:50] Christ before that you can pick pick
[1:28:52] this person up and carry them you have
[1:28:55] to be right first I have to be right
[1:28:59] first it's like if you see somebody out
[1:29:02] there in the in the ocean that's
[1:29:04] drowning and you swim out there to save
[1:29:08] this
[1:29:09] person you're out there the water's deep
[1:29:11] what's the when you grab a hold of them
[1:29:13] what's the first thing they're going to
[1:29:13] do they're going to push you
[1:29:17] down and if you're not ready you're
[1:29:19] going to drown you have have to be
[1:29:22] trained you have to be right you have to
[1:29:26] have swam you have to know how to swim
[1:29:28] you know have to know how to take care
[1:29:31] of someone that's out in the
[1:29:33] ocean and then you can help them you can
[1:29:37] talk calm
[1:29:39] down I'm gonna help you just roll over
[1:29:42] on your back and I'll swim you back to
[1:29:45] shore but if you don't know what you're
[1:29:47] doing first thing that they're going to
[1:29:48] do is they're going to push you down
[1:29:49] you're both going to
[1:29:50] drown so we have to
[1:29:55] know before we get out there in that
[1:29:58] deep water we have got to be in the
[1:30:01] place that we should be we have to have
[1:30:03] What's called the new
[1:30:05] birth we have to have What's called the
[1:30:07] holy spirit that Spirit of Christ that
[1:30:10] was in the earth back in the in the
[1:30:13] disciples that this man Elijah his
[1:30:17] Spirit was going to return us back to
[1:30:19] that that same Spirit has to be in US so
[1:30:22] that we are able to do something because
[1:30:24] the time's getting short the alarm went
[1:30:26] off we don't have enough
[1:30:28] time I feel so bad for
[1:30:30] um sometimes brother Arie and sister
[1:30:33] Rachel
[1:30:35] because I'm always like hey we we need
[1:30:38] to we need to do this um and I want I
[1:30:40] want to have this and there's sister
[1:30:42] Rachel back there and and and and I
[1:30:45] think I wonder what what she's thinking
[1:30:48] it's always one thing after the next
[1:30:50] after the next and I could just see I
[1:30:53] could just hear the thoughts and I wish
[1:30:55] he would chill out it's stressing me out
[1:30:59] or maybe not in those
[1:31:02] words but I feel like we don't have
[1:31:04] enough
[1:31:05] time I feel like we got to get it
[1:31:08] done I feel like the time is ticking the
[1:31:11] alarm clock went off and we got to get
[1:31:14] these souls in in any way we
[1:31:17] can we got to teach them about Jesus
[1:31:20] Christ if it's going to get you across
[1:31:23] the Finish Line we'll carry you if we
[1:31:26] have
[1:31:28] to then once we get right once we've
[1:31:31] learned how to
[1:31:33] swim then God will place gifts into the
[1:31:36] church I don't have time to read it 1
[1:31:39] Corinthians chapter
[1:31:41] 12 it shows us that there are different
[1:31:46] gifts that are placed into the church
[1:31:49] and each person has his or her special
[1:31:54] gift that God brings into the body to
[1:31:58] make it whole Paul likened it to the
[1:32:00] body he said you you have toes and you
[1:32:02] have a nose you have
[1:32:06] ears he might not have created you to be
[1:32:08] this but the body is not complete with
[1:32:11] all of these people in there all of the
[1:32:15] gifts operating in in unity you might
[1:32:19] say well what's my my
[1:32:23] gift you got to get with Christ first
[1:32:26] and learn to
[1:32:27] swim then give your heart to
[1:32:30] him and then you won't Elevate yourself
[1:32:34] you won't be trying to draw attention to
[1:32:35] yourself as the world teaches us to do
[1:32:37] but you'll follow the Master's
[1:32:40] orders I had a friend I remember when I
[1:32:43] was in junior high this um there's this
[1:32:48] guy named Wyatt
[1:32:49] goodier and uh Wyatt um is an odd Odd
[1:32:55] Fellow um but uh I think we're in
[1:32:58] seventh grade Mr claude's class in
[1:33:00] seventh grade was science class so Mr
[1:33:03] Claude tells us he said and we're
[1:33:05] talking about the anatomy and we're
[1:33:07] talking about physiology and how your
[1:33:09] body works and and involuntary responses
[1:33:12] versus voluntary responses and breathing
[1:33:14] and heartbeats and all that and he saysi
[1:33:16] want everybody to do this he said I want
[1:33:17] everybody to hold their breath as long
[1:33:20] as they can
[1:33:23] so we're like okay great and he says I
[1:33:25] want to show you what it does so there I
[1:33:26] don't know there's 20 or third 30 of us
[1:33:28] in the class so we all take a big breath
[1:33:31] and we start holding our
[1:33:33] breath
[1:33:34] and you we we start pounding on the desk
[1:33:38] and and most of us cheated I took a
[1:33:41] couple breaths and and then I drew some
[1:33:44] attention to myself like you know and
[1:33:47] then and and everybody else was doing it
[1:33:49] and then finally everyone
[1:33:52] had given
[1:33:55] up but the instructor the professor he
[1:33:59] looked out across the audience and he
[1:34:01] said there is one person in this class
[1:34:05] that's doing it
[1:34:06] right and we all looked around and
[1:34:09] everybody was just sitting
[1:34:10] there and he pointed to Wyatt
[1:34:14] Goodyear and Wyatt was sitting at his
[1:34:17] desk like just normal his chest was
[1:34:23] moving up and down like he was breathing
[1:34:26] his nostrils were flaring like he was
[1:34:30] breathing and Mr Claude said look at
[1:34:33] him we all look over at him and he says
[1:34:36] he looks like he's breathing doesn't
[1:34:39] he look yeah he say he's not he says
[1:34:44] that's the that's the response of his
[1:34:47] body to having a lack of oxygen it's
[1:34:50] trying to get oxygen into the body so
[1:34:53] we're like whoa and here's poor Wyatt
[1:34:56] and he's still not breathing so then
[1:34:59] finally Mr Claud says okay Wyatt you can
[1:35:02] breathe
[1:35:04] so I was looking at that and something
[1:35:06] inside of me said remember
[1:35:08] that that it's the ones like me and and
[1:35:12] like all the other kids in the room we
[1:35:14] were drawing attention to ourselves but
[1:35:16] there was one that took it
[1:35:18] seriously and you may not have seen him
[1:35:20] doing it
[1:35:22] but he was living that life he was doing
[1:35:27] exactly what the professor said what the
[1:35:28] master said and sometimes you may not
[1:35:31] think and anybody's watching you may not
[1:35:34] think that that you're
[1:35:36] important but in all of that class the
[1:35:40] professor singled him out as the one
[1:35:42] that was doing it I asked him later I
[1:35:45] said hey Wyatt I said uh how'd you do
[1:35:47] that and he's like oh yeah he says my
[1:35:49] brothers and I used to have a con
[1:35:51] contest on who could hold their their
[1:35:53] breath the longest and and the first one
[1:35:55] to pass out lost I
[1:35:58] like definitely a marketable skill um
[1:36:02] good luck with that in the future but it
[1:36:04] made a it made an impression on
[1:36:08] me I think
[1:36:11] that we when we find our gift when we we
[1:36:16] start operating in the Lord's perfect
[1:36:19] plan then we will
[1:36:23] see our Ministries each of us and let me
[1:36:25] tell you everyone in the building has a
[1:36:28] Ministry don't think you don't but you
[1:36:32] do and your
[1:36:34] ministry if you would dedicate your life
[1:36:37] to him if you would put him first then
[1:36:39] God would operate in that Ministry Satan
[1:36:43] will try to hinder hinder you and he'll
[1:36:46] try to he'll try to shut you down he'll
[1:36:48] try
[1:36:48] to everything else in the world he'll
[1:36:51] come against
[1:36:53] you but if you will dedicate your life
[1:36:56] to him if I will dedicate my life to him
[1:36:59] then he will use us and my point in
[1:37:04] saying all of this is we're seeing the
[1:37:07] alarm clock going
[1:37:10] off and this Spirit of
[1:37:13] Slumber that's upon all of us it's all
[1:37:17] good everything's going to be okay I'm a
[1:37:20] Christian
[1:37:25] exactly what was happening in Noah's
[1:37:27] time change put God first in your
[1:37:34] life look at that alarm clock don't jump
[1:37:37] up and down and rejoice because it's
[1:37:40] 5:30 in the morning it's time to get up
[1:37:42] and go to
[1:37:44] work get up and go to work see that and
[1:37:49] operate in the calling that he is given
[1:37:51] each of you that he has given me or let
[1:37:54] me tell you there will be
[1:37:58] people that don't come to the Lord
[1:38:02] because of our laziness I believe God
[1:38:05] has a plan in all of it but I don't want
[1:38:07] to be guilty of
[1:38:09] that I don't want you to be guilty of
[1:38:11] that and I certainly don't want the
[1:38:13] people who would
[1:38:15] be understanding the Lord that would
[1:38:17] have a relationship with the Lord I
[1:38:19] certainly don't want those people to be
[1:38:21] left behind because of my own
[1:38:25] laziness this Gentile dispensation is
[1:38:29] closing how many years was it from
[1:38:33] Abraham from from Adam and Eve to
[1:38:36] Abraham 2000 how many years from Abraham
[1:38:39] to Jesus 2,000 how many years from Jesus
[1:38:42] to
[1:38:44] here
[1:38:46] 2,000 it's time the
[1:38:50] alarms are going off whether you
[1:38:53] believe what I say or not these things
[1:38:56] line
[1:38:58] up and the time is late the alarm clock
[1:39:01] is going off so now what do we
[1:39:06] do there's a
[1:39:09] prayer that the Apostle Paul who started
[1:39:12] really this Gentile
[1:39:14] dispensation that he prayed in Ephesians
[1:39:17] chapter
[1:39:18] 3 and it's one of the most beautiful
[1:39:22] things I've ever seen and I see the
[1:39:24] heart of Christ in this
[1:39:30] man Paul
[1:39:33] is
[1:39:35] seeing all of these people maybe that
[1:39:37] he's led to the Lord and he's he's
[1:39:39] writing to this group in
[1:39:41] Ephesus loving these
[1:39:44] people now watch what the man of God
[1:39:47] says Ephesians chapter
[1:39:50] 3:14
[1:39:52] is
[1:39:54] praying for this cause I bow my knees
[1:39:58] under the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:40:00] Christ of whom the whole family in
[1:40:03] Heaven and Earth is
[1:40:06] named that he would Grant you according
[1:40:09] to the riches of his glory to be
[1:40:13] strengthened with the might by his
[1:40:16] spirit in the inner
[1:40:19] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[1:40:23] by faith that ye being rooted and
[1:40:26] grounded in love let me tell you
[1:40:30] something I'll stop right there the
[1:40:31] musicians can prepare I'll stop right
[1:40:34] there for a moment rooted that you being
[1:40:37] he's praying that you would be rooted
[1:40:39] and grounded in
[1:40:42] love all the sermons I could preach all
[1:40:46] of the testimonies I could give all of
[1:40:49] the doctrine I could tell you it would
[1:40:52] come to not if it wasn't for
[1:40:55] love remember in in uh a few weeks ago
[1:41:00] we were at our
[1:41:02] camp and there was there was these boys
[1:41:04] that were there that were just causing a
[1:41:06] ruckus and just just being a pain in the
[1:41:08] neck they weren't part of our
[1:41:11] group
[1:41:12] and I got ticked off
[1:41:16] atam and my first thought was to get
[1:41:21] these kids out of here they're causing a
[1:41:24] problem I want these boys
[1:41:27] out and some of you were there and
[1:41:30] witnessed this brother Paul you were
[1:41:32] right there and I was fired up man and I
[1:41:38] I said I want you three boys over here
[1:41:40] right now and they're like the dad was
[1:41:43] over there and I set them three down and
[1:41:45] I said I'm sick and tired of this that
[1:41:48] was
[1:41:49] Dan but then brother
[1:41:52] Daniel started to come out a little bit
[1:41:55] and I said do you boys understand why
[1:41:58] we're
[1:42:00] here and I started talking to them
[1:42:03] started telling them
[1:42:05] testimonies about the Lord and how good
[1:42:07] he is and what I've seen in my life and
[1:42:10] what my family has seen and telling them
[1:42:14] listen you
[1:42:15] boys this is really this is the most
[1:42:18] important thing that can do in your
[1:42:22] life is give your heart to the Lord and
[1:42:25] as and as it went
[1:42:28] on I made a
[1:42:30] decree I said you boys are part of our
[1:42:33] camp
[1:42:34] now and I said I want you to respect all
[1:42:38] these other kids and I want all these
[1:42:39] other kids to respect
[1:42:41] you and when we have a when we have an
[1:42:44] event I want you boys there you boys are
[1:42:47] now part of
[1:42:49] us many of you kids remember the
[1:42:54] kids they participated in our events
[1:42:57] they were very respectful after that
[1:43:00] they even came to the service on Sunday
[1:43:02] morning and the one boy as hard as you
[1:43:05] can be two boys that as hard as you can
[1:43:08] be I look out and I see the one with his
[1:43:10] head bowed and the tears coming down and
[1:43:12] I look at the other one and he walks up
[1:43:14] to Daniel my son and he just gives him a
[1:43:17] big
[1:43:18] hug love
[1:43:21] conquers all I could have kicked them
[1:43:24] out but what good would that have done
[1:43:27] what good would that have done those
[1:43:30] Souls that Christ May dwell in your
[1:43:33] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[1:43:36] grounded in love may be able to
[1:43:38] comprehend with all the saints what is
[1:43:41] the breadth and the length and the depth
[1:43:45] and the
[1:43:47] height and to know the love of Christ
[1:43:51] which passes which passes knowledge that
[1:43:54] ye might be filled with all the fullness
[1:43:56] fullness of
[1:43:58] God now unto him that is able to do
[1:44:00] exceeding abundantly above all that that
[1:44:03] we ask or think according to the power
[1:44:06] that worketh in US unto him be glory in
[1:44:09] the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[1:44:12] all ages this one too Without
[1:44:16] End you know I
[1:44:19] wish it's all was reading that yesterday
[1:44:21] and
[1:44:23] preparing I was sitting in my chair and
[1:44:26] I was reading that and I said Lord I
[1:44:30] wish a man or a
[1:44:34] woman who really knows you who really
[1:44:40] loves
[1:44:41] you who really knows how to pray I wish
[1:44:46] that person would pray that prayer over
[1:44:49] me
[1:44:51] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[1:44:55] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:44:57] in love may be able to comprehend with
[1:45:00] All Saints what is the breadth and the
[1:45:02] length and the depth and the
[1:45:05] height and to know the love of Christ
[1:45:08] which passes knowledge that ye might be
[1:45:12] filled with
[1:45:14] all of the fullness of
[1:45:18] God what
[1:45:21] what a prayer that the Apostle prayed
[1:45:24] before the
[1:45:25] father Lord that they would know you
[1:45:28] that they would know how big you are
[1:45:30] that they would know everything about
[1:45:32] you and that you that they might be
[1:45:35] fulfilled with all the fullness of
[1:45:39] God what a statement how many of us in
[1:45:44] this room how many of us pray like
[1:45:47] that how many of us pray for each other
[1:45:50] like that
[1:45:52] it's a lesson to
[1:45:54] me I
[1:45:57] pray
[1:45:59] that many of you pray the same for me
[1:46:03] and I'll pray the same for you let's bow
[1:46:06] our
[1:46:13] heads the first
[1:46:16] step would be
[1:46:18] baptism as the Apostle Peter laid forth
[1:46:22] the first step would be the
[1:46:24] baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:46:28] Christ for the remission of sins for the
[1:46:31] taking away of
[1:46:33] sins heard that there's a

[1:46:59] back to know

[1:47:33] understanding and all that the world has

[1:55:16] that that they want to go through with
[1:55:18] this and she said well I went to another

[1:56:26] fail but the blood of Jesus Christ will
[1:56:30] cover any sin it'll wash it away in the
[1:56:33] sea of God's forgetfulness there is no
[1:56:36] more
[1:56:37] sin this baptism represents the washing
[1:56:41] away of every sin that's ever been
[1:56:45] committed and your commitment to do
[1:56:48] it is saying that I'm going to accept
[1:56:50] him as my savior even with everything
