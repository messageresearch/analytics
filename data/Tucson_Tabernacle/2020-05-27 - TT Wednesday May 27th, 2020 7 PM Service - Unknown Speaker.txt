and some of us can watch them and so that was her fear was so the money evening inspired me the pressor plan and was all spring she she said God who knows change and she said that this is what he needs to do the network they talked about putting a catheter and really which is easier new but in this report we're here you just wait down on your chest wall right into the Penguins next to your heart so it's not something that just thought you'd be here and it didn't work so the doctor said I'm going to give you surgery but potassium level had a Crystal Eye to the point and all these changes so that's when the nitrous to be sure there's other churches requirement they and all and she just asked for prayer and then about four o'clock that she's in surgery we waited almost not very well he asked your father your mother if it's okay to do this she'll say I'm old enough [Music] as I began to look at you know if we've been doing service on Serena this still ties into that look Sunday afternoon we were really mad a pitcher and SME were speaking with someone that needed some encouragement north and as we finish we pray for my brother Matt was praying I'm looking down turbulent water [Music] [Music] it's really small so my but yesterday it's the time we'll bring them here to me and this one is speaking about children but watches are you encompassed with needs this very moment and almost over with difficulties trials and emergencies they are reminded by the vessels giving you an opportunity to see him move and see them do something but when you go it takes a matter of jeans don't want to so it is this finding and if you've got right the understood their meaning they could become opportunities opportunities for receiving blessings and deliverances [Music] vessels family beforehand interpreter keep still be still to do nothing that he does not himself command you to give him a chance to work and it will surely do so and the very trials that threat to overcome with as good as what a source god bless apply his riches in glory what a channel Christ Jesus is your sweetness replace all your beats over against his riches and lose sight of the farmer in the presence of the batter when you beginner behind what he has how about ways which and it says his exhaust which treasures don't open to you and all of our gold and draw upon it in the artists simplicity effects and you will never application to the creature stream or [Music] who has so if you're set just enter your netid your soul in the evening dress if you're perplexing this dress remember me I'll be with you always even to the end of the world all things work together for good to them that love the Lord so just statement one man broke a photo my anchor holes in the bed what is it well it's something that shuts off from here from there and as I started to read and read how much time were focused on that here all that I've seen all this is happening right here but behind the veil the anchor holes and so he's saying it shut off from here to there any actors on the inside blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of error salvation purchase of God he says nature child you know that God told me to bring me up so that's amazing I want the assurance of coming out I want to say it all set that big dark channel that set before each one of us every time our heartbeat we go must step closer than a big dark it's called death but when I come to the end of my journey to my heart stopping and B I don't want to be covered I want to wrap myself in the world knowing that when he calls from me money calls from the lung today I'll come out that's amazing that's now when you thought physician you got a benefit to baby crying forget not all his benefits waterfall what a beautiful reading we have there under consideration and we mess sometimes some of the things sometimes a focused on what's happening baby doesn't see but he said I'll never leave you if you go look into the messaging you see let's go get some scriptures here sheriff you this year going to Psalm 62 versus five my soul wait thou only one time specific objects for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved in god is my salvation my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times you people pour out your heart before him God is with us he trusts in him at all times even when the situation [Music] [Music] so I said this pour out your heart before God is a reference marks and then of course Psalms 23 it probably one of the most read scriptures off the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside still waters he restoreth my soul and then if somebody will tell you we're going this way but be careful there's robbers there speaks there's there's people that are you know all kinds of things there's lions and tigers [Music] [Music] mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over and then finishing with it surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and as I look at that last line and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever if he is in here you are darling in the house of the Lord forever sometimes we put it well we'll go to the tabernacle that's a house of the Lord we'll go to this no you are the house of the Lord I will do well that will be part he'll be with me he'll never leave me sometimes we put it too far away sometimes we don't include ourselves in there and then in Psalms 27 13 and 14 and this this the Psalms had been in my mind in my heart and I hadn't put it in my notes and a brother posted him for me exactly the scriptures that came up on my on my what I was doing in it they were they were he had posted them so 27 13 14 I would have I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living or David said I would have despaired I wouldn't even want to enjoy I would have given up I would have thrown my hands unless I had believed I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living or I had almost given up my hope of seeing the blessings of the Lord in the land of the living he says wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait I say on the Lord and and what is waiting in entail subjecting ourselves saying Lord I want to go this way now I want to go that way and I think this would be the best but I'm gonna wait for your direction I'm gonna wait freely and brother green used to tell us you don't pay attention s-- twice by the third or fourth time you start paying attention because you know what happens when you don't know you know how that works and then Peter says in chapter five and six and submerge the six and seven humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time humble yourselves be willing to say not my will but thy will I don't have to get my way in this God I'll take your way he said to be he says and he will exalt you because you want to be exact no he'll lift you up we get we look at that word and we think exalt is to be made in front of everybody everybody worship you know he will do the lifting you don't have to do it yourself he will do it he will place you in them a place you go and maybe the place he has you seems insignificant seems the least notice part until it's missing the little nut that holds that thing together where it does like this well it's just there but until it falls off and the part doesn't work everybody's going where's that nut he's right here sometimes but sometimes we're looking Wow that one gets a glory and I want to be that part and I want to do this but God has a part for every one of us and a place for every one of us this is casting all your care upon him for he cares for you you know we carry our cares we got a backpack we got a footlocker we've got a wheelbarrow we got a truck and trailer and we just depending how much cares who want to take with us Lord I'm going out to visit you but I'm bringing all my cares because that's what I'm comfortable in because that's what I know and God says cast your cares on me for he cared for you then Jem says it this way in for chapter 4 and 7 submit yourselves therefore to God submit say Here I am Lord I give myself resist the devil and he will flee from you it's kind of funny how will we say the old Lord I'm being I'm being bugged by the devil he won't leave me alone and he said we'll have you submitted yourself have you yielded yourself are you willing to let go the steering wheel are you willing to take your foot off the gas are you willing to let go of the reins and let God have his way now the the the when I was looking at this and this that happened on on Sunday I began to thank think of a three Hebrew children Shadrach Meshach Abednego and we know the story of them and so we'll just pick up the latter portion of it chapter 3 verses 13 to 18 and they had come they had been taken captive all right with Daniel and and they had proved themselves they had they had had eaten their own diet they were fun to be fair they were they were better scientists they were better whatever the it called for you know and even the the princes and the and the leaders of their under neck endeavors noticed it what a difference between these you know so so we know Nebuchadnezzar makes that that that Idol that statue and it's of Daniel because he was pleased by what Daniel said and if we're not careful we'll take somebody that has blessed us somebody has helped us and let me just be honest a pastor a prophet and we'll idolize him and then God will cause that person to fail so that you can take your eyes off and look to God and sometimes the disappointment overwhelms us but it's the best thing that could happen to you because then you'll turn your eyes and look upon God because he'll never fail you so here is neck then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring sanrak Shadrach Meshach Abednego and they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake unto them and said is it true no Shadrach Meshach and Abednego do you not serve my God's nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if you be ready that at the time you hear the sound of the cornet the flute harp sackbut thus altering the dulcimer and all kinds of music you shall bow down and worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not he shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands what a challenge what words that he uttered and had no idea what he was telling it was challenging really really you're gonna go against me and you think your God is gonna deliver you yes he's proof faithful he's never failed I know he will he keeps his word so here's their answer yeah Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter we're not going to mince the word so we're not gonna go around we're not gonna try to put it sweetly to you we're just gonna say no pretty straightforward if it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from this burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O king and then here it is but if not he says be it known unto thee O king that we will not serve thy God's nor worship thy golden image which thou has set you've got to come to a place in your life where I said I will cast myself at the mercies of my god and also understand but if he chooses not to I will still cast myself into his hands if you'll let go and let God he might take you in a way that you didn't think was the right way this pathway looks better this way looks shorter but he has a reason and a why now sometimes we don't give our kids the why sometimes we don't even give them the reason we just tell him to do it I had my two nieces were at the house today and they were outside and I forget where we were leaving the church and and they said something about going and I said no you can't leave until you count all the rocks in the gravel of the driveway right there and they stopped she stops and give me a look now you can ask the girls how many time I did that to them when they were little dad can we go to the can we go over a bit soon so I said we need to count the gravel and the driveway to make sure we haven't lost any just about 25,000 pieces travel there and for the longest time Rachel would stop and look at me like are you serious dad she doesn't do that no more but what if God asked you to stop and count the blades of grass for a while would you be like these three and said we'll do it when you realize everything that God has for me has a purpose in a place and you would find out at the end of the accounting of the grass that he had a purpose in the place for it it might not make any sense to you but God has a reason why he does what he does and we have to stand forth so they said but if not we're still not gonna bow down we're still not gonna give it we're gonna trust in him to the end Abraham it's been 25 years Abraham he said it I still stand on it God said so and we've been talking about this for how many years since Jesus ascended I will come back to take you home it's been over 2,000 years but he's coming back and he's promised he said I will come back to take you home with me again we have to take that attitude even if not Lord you know what's best for me you know what's best for me and then let's go to mark and look at mark chapter 4 35 to 41 these are these are things we all know I don't think there's anything in the Bible that is well I didn't know that was in the Bible maybe on one Scripture but pretty well those of you that have read the Bible and have been around here but they were human they were people just like us they had the same thoughts the only thing that really they couldn't do back then is they couldn't pick up a telephone and call and and like I did today and send out the prayer requests everywhere and you know they had to word of mouth and it took time and all thank God today in five minutes the whole country could be notified and it's a blessing to have others praying for you but if there's only one God still hears that so they and they say and that same day glasses on so I can read this and the same day when the even was come he says saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side and I there's been many a sermons preached on that but still think about it God had never failed them he had never lied to them he had never done said something that it didn't happen so if they would have been listening let us pass over them to the other side they would've said let's go there would be no hey God said so we're going and when they sent away had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there was also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and I always this and I'm sure you've heard it if he's laying on the pill sleeping why should we be worried because he's definitely not worried but we're looking at it and we're saying why are you sleeping in the middle of this storm that's their thought because that's how the answer him they said and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pill and they awake him they didn't come out God Jesus Jesus no I'm sure they came and tugged and pulled and get his attention now no and they said unto Him master carest thou not that we person aren't you even concerned about us you're asleep and we're about ready to drown we're about this ship's about ready to go down and he arose and he rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was great call I don't know I could see him getting up and going come on guys again okay I'm sure that you got exasperated with him sometimes come on guys I've done this over and over what what's your fare what's your worry I've already said we're passing over to the other side and he calls the sea and he turned out of them why are you so fearful and how is it that you have no faith lord help us sometimes and they feared it exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind in the sea obey Him what manner of man is this don't care what the circumstances he has control over every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord so why we really fear why are we afraid we say Lord says go you go I'll go with you I'll never leave you sometimes though well not sometimes all the time the troubles is right about here some people say how big is the problem I say I don't know at seven or eight inches maybe whatever this width is it's not a big problem it is the problem you get to reasoning thinking working there getting all concerned the scripture tells us be still it doesn't mean stop don't move it just says rest don't be anxious don't work at yourself let God be God and he'll do he'll take it at Matthew 6 and we'll read some of the verses out of chapter 6 we'll read 19 to 21 to start you can read that whole that whole chapter and he's just expressing and teaching so much through there he says lay not up for yourself treasures upon earth where moth does the rest must and moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal that's where our concern gets sometimes with what we have done here and what we got here and we're afraid we're going to lose it that it if God says leave it he's got something better for you simple is that because he would not give you this that's what he does remember God can take 10 cents of the dollar and do a whole lot more than you can do with 90 cents of that dollar he's proved it over and over and over he takes three fish and five loaves and feeds 12,000 with leftovers so why do we fear that he says but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through or nor steal because where your treasure is there will your heart be also that which you treasure most that you spend time with most that you that's where your heart is that you know and and and it's okay wish if there's something we do it's okay to enjoy it something wrong with that myself sister Angela and and the sisters play the piano the Oregon and and we've talked about it there's just something it just isn't it's just so nice when the blessing that the presence of the Lord is you almost feel like you could leave the instrument alone and it would worship there's some times that probably people hearing you're saying would you leave that instrument alone give our ears a little you know they're just sometimes it doesn't work but you know you could take that and and and sister Lily will be playing the piano and and that song is in your heart and she starts playing it she's not mine reading that's the presence of the Lord just moving amongst he says where your heart is and if you can come in with that attitude my heart my desires first for you Lord and watch how things begin to change and watch how things begin to happen many times I've told sister Lily I said I didn't go to that song but the next song you played was the next song that I had in my heart to sing and we didn't sing or she started with a song that was already and I'm not saying never because every once in a while I would tell her can you play this song or we do that song but most the time it isn't it's what God puts in her heart it's what God puts in your heart you come due to a service and you have a desire in your heart you have a need in your heart and someone gets up either prays sings a song reads the scripture of the minister ministers any ministers right down to where you're at he says put your treasure there put your heart there in that and then he says in verse 25 will we just skip down to verse 25 go through 29 and he says therefore I send to you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on it's not the life more than the meat in the body more than raiment then he says behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them are you not much better than they mama likes to feed the birds out in the back we have some feeders out there and and they come and sometimes they come up there and they come up to the feeder and they look in the window and say come on guys you're behind there's no feed in the feeder I'll tell hey they're out there chirping because you haven't ever filled it up they've gotten used to it but he said well God used me he still fed them didn't he however he's going to do it they don't come by and say here's 25 bucks so you guys buy us another big bag of feed no they don't but however God's doing you know he's gonna get it done which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these if God can do that with the natural things how much more can he do with his spiritual how much more can he do in your life - cause the lilies to grow in your life - cause the raiment the holy arraignment in your life whatever is needed how much more he says he he'll take care of us he's never left us and will never leave us alone Philippians chapter 4 and we'll look at four verses six and seven he says be careful for nothing now don't read that wrong it doesn't say to be reckless when you take that word be careful for nothing the original translations don't be full of cares that's really but they turned around said be careful for nothing don't get so involved in the cares of life that you're full of that don't have time for the other he says be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God or another way to say it be careful nothing in nothing be anxious or is having no distressing anxiety about everything being full of care but in everything instead of anxiety just lay the case before God and trust him to do all things well let your requests be made known unto God and he says three elements enter the up into the appeal to God prayer which is the outpouring of the soul supplication estate the stating of our wants our desires our needs Thanksgiving we must always come to God not in a complaining spirit both a thankfulness for his present mercies Lord I'm coming and I'm sorry but I've talked to you three times and you have an answer I would never say that brother but your attitude says that when Oh Lord how long when are you gonna do this I've asked you over and over when you you bless my neighbor but you haven't blessed me at where are you lord I never say that our actions speak that way at times we forget to be grateful and thankful in our prayer in our supplication and then he says and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus and the peace of God the calm heavenly repose that tranquility of Spirit which God only can give which surpasses all understanding which none can comprehend save he that receiveth him sometimes you can't explain it but you know it you cut it how can you be so at peace about it I can't say well you do this this this and this and this and that'll equal peace I just say it's God in my life he's the one that does it I can't explain it to you but I know it shall keep shall guard as a garrison does a city your hearts your affections your minds your understandings and all the various workings of them through the spirit and power of Christ Jesus in the knowledge and the love of God without our guard set on them likewise the purity and the vigor vigor of our affections cannot long be preserved as much as we desire we want to keep ourselves pure before God we cannot do ourselves all have sinned and come short of Allah Laurie God not anything I could present to him is of any value of myself nothing good we try we do our best but if that's what we're presenting to him were no different than Cain who came up and said I got all my fruits and I laid them before you but we come like Abel and said I'm nothing but I know that it took the life of an innocent one and I present that to you and that's what he says so you're accepting my death for you on Calvary you're accepting the shedding of my blood you're accepting the work that I did it yes then you're accepted you're accepted in the beloved because he was at first born of God he was the accepted one he says again without a guard set on these the purity and the vigor of our affections cannot long be preserved set in your hearts and another way he said and the peace of God that peace that comes by putting all in the hands of the one who is able and willing to deliver which it passes beyond all understanding whenever we fully trust the Lord there comes a peace that is understanding of those who have never experienced it they shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus the peace will be a guard which will keep the heart and thoughts holy and pure when there's a sweetness when there's a purity when there's a why would you want to offend it why would you want to break it now Lord when when it's like this I never want to come out of this atmosphere because the other atmosphere is no fun the other atmosphere is a challenge the other atmosphere is hard but I want the peace of God that passes understanding maybe I can't even put it in words but let my life that is the conversation that people need hear and see the very life of it then a couple more quotes hearing I believe and I skipped these but they would be the first ones or the Jeremy from cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to read sin from our lives what a title the cruelty of sin what it does the picture of the Marlboro Man fur for some of you who hadn't seen that picture you're too young because they took it away but some of us remember driving down the highway and there's that big billboard with the Marlboro Man a cowboy dressed in the boots and smoking tomorrow and just looking like all of a man and that's how they presented it but the cruelty of sin look at his picture at the end of life what it really did to him brother Brahim says throw your arms around the Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee while the near old waters roll while the tempest still is high hide me o my Savior hide me let the world do whatever they want to let the theologians do whatever they want to I don't want theology what I want is Jesus Christ in my heart I want to understand you Lord I want to be able to explain you I want to know every definition about you Lord so I need to go to this study and I need to go to this revelation and I need to go no I just want to know him to know him is to love him why people are toss so tossed about I seen that old ship setting there rocking back and forth and some waves that would go in and some waters that would go under and everything and I said wonder why that is and the fellow sitting said it's not a it's got a sea anchor on it therefore the ship can't sink and I said it can go through the wave but it can't sink as its anchored and I said oh praise be to God we got an anchor some ways we can go over some week go under but regardless if the anchor holds it isn't the ship doing the holding he said it's the anchor doing the holding it isn't what I am or what I will be or what I was it's what he is now and what he did for me and you it ain't what I can do but what he has done my anchor holds and grips that solid rock brother branham said behind the veil and joseph meeting his brethren did we I don't know that we read that one did we I believe we started with that one didn't we who has seen the other side of the storm so if you're sick just anchor your soul into Haven arrest so if you're perplexed and distress remember he said I'll be with you always even to the end of the world if he said it he keeps his word and he said all things work together for good for good to them that love the Lord Romans 8 so just stay right there one man wrote a poet wrote my anchor holds within the veil what is available it's something that shuts off from off here from there and the anchor is on the inside of the veil you don't see how it's going to be but you know what there's something that's got a hold of you this got to hold up it's got to hold up there again it's within the veil knowing what's behind that veil when when that that the priest the high priest went in behind the veil and the offering had been done the sacrifice the people on the outside that knew what was taking the place we're rejoicing they were happy because they knew that for another year their sins were not held against them they were forgiven so when you know what's going on behind the veil there's a shed blood there's a life of God you're a happy person but you know what you can go behind the veil today it's open in fact you need to go behind the veil to meet him the anchor holds and grips a solid rock it never fails CSIS on the other side of the storm sometimes a storm it's tough it's hard it's it's it's I don't know if you ever do and I don't know why I do this sometimes but I'll my wife will say why are you watching that and I'll watch replays of the tsunamis yeah I don't know why sometimes either but I'll watch what happened to people and I'll see the part I'll watch videos of large waves that ships are going through it usually happens at night when it's dark outside but I look at him when I say but the ship is made to go through that storm it's made to do that we weren't made to be overtaken by a tsunami but we were made to go through the storms of life and and you see some of things landslides and everything fire forest fires and all and you know just watching the destruction at all what I said but there's a God who cares there's a God who watches over us there's a God who never fails who keeps his words sometimes we get caught up in the emotions of life and the cares of life in in all that we're seen all around us in God says cast your burdens give of them willingly but Lord if I don't keep my hand on it a little bit I feel like it's out of control I feel like if my hands not a little bit on this channel you remember brother Greene's testimony when he was coming down from Flagstaff and that voice spoke to him and said if you really trust me take your hands off the steering wheel and they said that car came down the highway from Flagstaff he took his hands off the steering wheel and his hands off the gas pedal and the car came down went around people and did everything God was showing him I can drive this car a whole lot better than you can but we won't hold onto it wait the the passenger sometimes is having a harder time than the driver you know the the ones that take the student drivers out I don't know how they do it now don't go don't go ask my wife cuz she uh she did most of the training one day we were I think it was Elizabeth that I was I had taken her out to drive because she was going to go to college and he learned to drive and she's making a turn and she's not turning very hard and she's going right at a telephone pole and I just said you better finish that Turner you're gonna hit the pole and she finished the turn and we didn't hit the pole and then she turned around she goes had that been mother she would have been screaming her head off I said yeah but I don't scream like your mother I said the inside was screaming I'm glad the one that watches over us has seen the end already and knows exactly what's going to happen he's got it in control caster cares even when you're looking at the storm and you're looking at the raging river he's got a net to catch you he's got a net to protect you give yourself over willingly to him then you're gonna say I should have done this a long time ago Lord we we thank you that it doesn't depend on our own abilities and our own mind to figure all this out into to get all the equations and make sure they come out the end result is exactly as we think it should be more but you set laws in motion you set these things and they haven't failed you said Israel as long as the Sun rises in the sets in the evening my mercies will watch over you you gave us all these promises Lord and they've never failed they never come short father and we can we can hang our eternal destination on budget what your words are help us even in our fears in our hard times when we're wondering what will be the resultant to cast our cares on you to be willing to like the three Hebrew children and say I will cast myself into that furnace knowing my God will deliver me but even if he chooses not to deliver me I will still cast myself into that Lord let us be willing even when we're looking at the storm the raging river and we realize Lord that you've put a a safety net there you have a way to catch us and watch over us hard help us to surrender our wheel our thoughts our being in a way father that you could have preeminence and then let the peace of God that passes all understanding even our own understanding sometimes we couldn't explain it would be like that little spring that brother Branham walked up to and he he's talking to and he said if it could answer me and I would tell it asking why are you so happy why are you bubbling up is it because the birds come by and drink of you and the animals me and he says no if a good answer it's just that it's within me and it's coming out Lord let that peace of God be that way in our lives Lord may we all to it we ask in Jesus Christ me amen sometimes it's hard but he doesn't fail and I thank God for my brothers and my sisters who are here to encourage one another to help one another to carry the burden you know it may weigh a hundred pounds and you carry it by yourself you're carrying all hundred but you have somebody else and then the load is lighten it's half and it breaks down and thank God for one another has we help one another so let go and let God let go and let God had his wonder forward let go and let God had his way your sorrows will vanish your night turn today let go and let God have his way let's race at the key little bit go and let God have his wonderful way let go God have his word your sorrows will
