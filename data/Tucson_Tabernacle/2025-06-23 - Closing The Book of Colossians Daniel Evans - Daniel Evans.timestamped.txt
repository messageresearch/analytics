[7:20] so
[7:22] your spirit leads me on
[7:26] the power of your love.
[7:32] The power of love, the greatest love
[7:35] that power that there is.
[7:38] Even what you see, the electricity and
[7:40] all that, without God, all of that is
[7:43] useless.
[7:45] It'll come to its end. But his love is
[7:48] eternal. It's perfect. And that's the
[7:51] love he loves you with.
[7:54] And he said, you know, I'll give my life
[7:56] for you. Amen. How many appreciate that
[8:00] today? It's so good to know that he
[8:02] cares for us.
[8:06] Elizabeth Gary, my sister-in-law, she
[8:08] asked to pray for Bianca deeds. She's
[8:10] not been feeling well today. And I know
[8:13] that brother Sean, your dad is he's out
[8:16] in on the airplanes that they do the the
[8:19] deliveries and all. And seems like every
[8:22] time we hear a plane, it goes down.
[8:26] But God watches over his.
[8:28] How many knows that God watches over
[8:30] you?
[8:31] He knows who you are. He knows where you
[8:33] are. So if you have a need and you would
[8:35] say, "Lord, remember me."
[8:38] God knows what that is. But you know,
[8:40] commit it to him. Give it to him. Don't
[8:42] tell him how to do it. Just say, "Lord,
[8:45] I give it to you. You know what's best."
[8:47] Lord, as we as we bow our heads and our
[8:50] hearts before you and the service starts
[8:54] this evening, Lord, and we want to give
[8:56] you all honor and all glory and all
[8:58] praise, Lord.
[9:00] Sometimes we look at ourselves and and
[9:03] we we find ourselves so short and just
[9:06] struggling with this and and the things
[9:08] Lord that we want victory over and we
[9:11] want. But Lord, each one of those
[9:14] trials, each one of those things has a
[9:15] purpose and ask to draw us close to you,
[9:19] to have us call on your name, Lord,
[9:22] because you desire to draw nigh to us,
[9:25] Lord. for Bianca there at home and Shawn
[9:29] and his job as as he's flying across
[9:31] country and each one of them each one
[9:34] today Lord that has a need Lord every
[9:36] hand and heart here Lord is speaking
[9:39] with brother Jordan and as he he's gone

[9:44] you would be with him and brother Jude
[9:45] as they travel doing the work they're
[9:48] going to be doing Lord you would take
[9:49] care of the family at home Lord and this
[9:52] evening Lord we just ask you to have
[9:54] your way as our brothers minister your
[9:56] word,
[9:58] Lord. And what is your word? It's the
[10:00] power of your love made manifest, made
[10:02] real, Lord. We thank you for that. So,
[10:05] we just commit the rest of this service
[10:07] to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[10:15] You can be seated. We're going to sing
[10:16] another song and then Sister Hope has a
[10:18] special after that.

[15:57] I come to
[16:00] the garden.
[16:07] While the deer
[16:10] is still on the roes
[16:14] [Music]
[16:17] and the voice
[16:20] I hear
[16:23] falling on
[16:25] my ear.
[16:31] I find
[16:34] discloses
[16:39] and
[16:41] he walks
[16:44] with me and he talks
[16:49] with me
[16:51] and he he tells
[16:54] me I am
[16:57] his love.
[17:02] And the joys
[17:05] we share
[17:08] as we tear
[17:12] their
[17:13] no
[17:16] has ever
[17:25] heard
[17:29] His
[17:31] voice
[17:35] is so sweet.
[17:38] The birds hatch their singing
[17:46] and the melody
[17:51] that he gave
[17:54] to me.
[17:59] My heart
[18:02] is real
[18:08] and
[18:10] he walks
[18:13] with me and he talks
[18:18] with me
[18:20] and he tells

[19:07] around me
[19:10] before.
[19:15] But he lives

[20:17] as ever.
[20:25] and the joys
[20:28] we share
[20:31] as we cher
[20:36] no other
[20:40] has ever
[20:43] known.
[20:48] [Music]
[20:50] [Applause]
[20:55] Amen. Thank you, Sister Hope.
[20:57] I want to sing the love of God. Um,
[21:02] this song typically is about the love of
[21:04] God and the love that he has for us. But
[21:05] I was thinking this morning when brother
[21:07] Lyall was talking about charity and
[21:10] the love of God and
[21:13] know the love of God in us for one
[21:14] another and how great it is if we have
[21:17] charity and love for one another. Um, so
[21:20] I want to sing this song.
[21:24] The love of God
[21:31] is greater
[21:33] far
[21:37] than Tom.
[21:44] in it until
[21:47] [Music]
[21:50] it goes beyond
[21:55] [Music]
[21:56] the highest
[21:59] star
[22:02] [Applause]
[22:03] and it reaches
[22:05] to
[22:06] [Music]
[22:09] the Lord's
[22:16] The guilty pray
[22:19] [Music]
[22:23] down with pain.
[22:28] God gave his son
[22:35] to me.
[22:41] his
[22:42] child.
[22:47] He break
[22:53] and
[22:55] fall.
[23:00] [Applause]
[23:05] Oh love of God,
[23:11] how rich
[23:13] [Music]
[23:25] strong.
[23:29] It shall forever
[23:35] hold you.
[23:41] The saints in me
[23:44] [Music]
[23:53] could be with me.
[23:59] The ocean feel
[24:03] [Music]
[24:13] [Applause]
[24:17] where every star
[24:20] [Applause]
[24:23] on earth
[24:25] [Applause]
[24:29] in every way.
[24:35] describe
[24:36] my dream
[24:41] to write the love
[24:44] [Applause]
[24:47] of God
[24:52] would bring me
[24:56] [Music]
[25:04] Mark
[25:06] the stroll.
[25:10] Come take the Lord.
[25:16] Stra.
[25:19] [Music]
[25:28] Oh love of God.
[25:34] How rich and true.
[25:39] I'll be your
[25:44] [Music]
[25:47] strong.
[25:51] It shall forever
[25:58] hold
[26:03] the saints in me.
[26:11] [Music]
[26:15] Let's pray.
[26:18] Father, we're grateful once again to
[26:20] come among your children, your your
[26:24] believers.
[26:26] Lord, we pray that you'd be with us
[26:28] tonight
[26:29] as we go through these scriptures and
[26:32] finish this book from the Apostle Paul,
[26:36] this letter. We pray Lord that
[26:39] everything said would be pleasing to you
[26:43] and Lord the same spirit in which it was
[26:45] written would come forth from the pulpit
[26:48] tonight we ask Lord may your will be
[26:51] done we pray in Jesus name. Amen. God
[26:54] bless you and be seated.
[26:57] I'm uh
[27:00] thankful to be here tonight. We're going
[27:01] to have a we're going to have a good
[27:02] time tonight. It's um we're going to
[27:04] have a little bit of a different
[27:06] service.
[27:07] Um, I will uh finish up the book of
[27:12] Colossians. There's a there's a few
[27:13] sentences left and then um Brother Lyle
[27:18] is going to speak and is going to
[27:21] introduce
[27:23] um the the
[27:25] context of the book and and where it was
[27:27] written. And he's going to give us a
[27:29] foundation on this book of Colossians.
[27:32] And then I'm going to read the entire
[27:35] book and it'll probably take 10 minutes
[27:38] or so and out of the New Living
[27:41] Translation, just an easily understood
[27:45] common language translation so we can
[27:49] get how the church at Colasse felt when
[27:53] this letter was first read to them. I
[27:56] think it's going to be a really
[27:57] interesting service. Um, first I want to
[28:02] make a couple announcements. Um,
[28:07] the uh, so we finally we have our carpet
[28:10] ordered and uh, we can see we getting
[28:13] some painting done and it looks like we
[28:16] should start carpet installation
[28:19] uh, next month. So hopefully we'll be
[28:22] finished with then I think that we will
[28:25] be pretty close to finished with the
[28:26] sanctuary once we get the carpet
[28:28] installed. We still have some some work
[28:30] back there in the sound booth. Um and
[28:32] then some we still have some work on the
[28:34] walls. If if you see Lionel Salazar,
[28:38] I want everyone here, if you see him,
[28:41] put out your hand and thank him for the
[28:43] hard work that he's done and and
[28:45] texturing the walls. He's he came here,
[28:47] he didn't want to get paid for anything.
[28:49] He's just um
[28:51] a labor of love for the church. So, make
[28:54] sure Yeah.
[28:59] Make sure you greet brother Lionel and
[29:02] tell him thank you because it uh he he
[29:05] does a really good job. He's very
[29:07] meticulous. Um so, I really appreciate
[29:09] it. I know I know you do, too. Another
[29:13] thing I'd like to do with the church is
[29:16] this has been on my heart. It's been on
[29:17] my heart for like well since I've become
[29:20] pastor now almost two years. I would
[29:23] like to have a service dedicated about
[29:29] once a month on answering questions
[29:33] that's on the congregation's heart. And
[29:36] uh it's just been it's just been getting
[29:37] stronger and stronger. And a lot of
[29:38] times you have this, you know, with me,
[29:40] I'll have a lane brain idea and it's
[29:43] like it sounds really good. It's like,
[29:44] oh, we're going to do this. And then
[29:47] I've learned now in my old age, I'm
[29:50] going to be a grandpa.
[29:52] I you are going to hear that a lot from
[29:55] now on, but now I've learned to pause
[30:01] and to seek the Lord on everything and
[30:05] and just wait. And sometime that
[30:07] emotion, that excitement, it kind of
[30:09] goes away. It fades. But this I uh it's
[30:13] just kept getting stronger and stronger.
[30:15] And then as uh as we were leaving today,
[30:18] uh sister Stephanie, brother Tony were
[30:21] the last ones to leave. They greeted me
[30:22] and on their way out, we talked for a
[30:25] little while. And sister Sister
[30:26] Stephanie said, "How have you ever
[30:28] thought about answering some of the
[30:31] questions that's on the congregation's
[30:33] heart?"
[30:34] She said, "You know, you may assume that
[30:38] the congregation understands things and
[30:40] you may refer to it." She said, "But it
[30:43] would be nice if if there was something
[30:45] on the people's hearts that they could
[30:46] write down a question and then you could
[30:48] address it maybe on a Sunday night or a
[30:50] Wednesday night." And I was like, "You
[30:50] know what? Other people have said it.
[30:53] It's been on my heart. Now I think that
[30:55] we should move forward in doing it." Do
[30:57] you do you like that idea? Do you think
[31:00] And you'll have to contribute. you.
[31:02] You'll have to I don't want to not have
[31:05] any questions, you know, and then I'll
[31:08] make some up. Um why doesn't anybody
[31:11] have any questions? And then I could
[31:13] answer that one. Um but no, I would I
[31:16] think it would be good that we could
[31:18] answer
[31:20] um we could devote maybe a service a
[31:24] month or even more, who knows, to doing
[31:26] that. And uh, Brother Lyle and I are
[31:28] gonna wrap up this next series that
[31:32] we've been on. And um, this may take the
[31:36] place of one of those services that we
[31:38] do on Wednesday night or we may do it on
[31:40] Sunday at night. I don't know. I'm very
[31:42] very open to suggestions that you have.
[31:44] And I I'm really I'm excited about it. I
[31:47] want to hear what what the congregation
[31:49] what's on their minds, what uh what they
[31:52] may not understand or may they may ask
[31:54] why, you know, why do you use so many
[31:56] different translations of the Bible.
[31:58] What are the different translations of
[31:59] the Bible? Um, who were these people in
[32:03] the New Testament? Who are these some of
[32:04] these people that you that I might refer
[32:06] to and you might not know who they are?
[32:09] Anything really anything on your heart?
[32:12] Feel free to ask and I'd like to have
[32:15] some time obviously to study them and
[32:18] get ready for them before I answer. So,
[32:20] we'll uh I'll I'll I'll say more on that
[32:23] uh coming up. This let's wrap up this
[32:27] letter to the Colossians. The letter was
[32:30] written about 60 AD. It's written by the
[32:34] Apostle Paul and I've as I've introduced
[32:38] it every time I've said that Paul did
[32:41] had never met most of these people in
[32:43] Colasse. So therefore, Paul did not
[32:45] start the church. Colasse was a smaller
[32:50] city in the area. The cities of like
[32:53] Leodysia were much bigger. Colassi was
[32:56] small. So the congregation was also
[33:00] probably very small. I'll bet you it was
[33:02] about the size of maybe this
[33:03] congregation that we have here, maybe
[33:06] even smaller. The congregation that we
[33:08] have here may have been about the size,
[33:11] it's even bigger than the church at
[33:12] Ephesus that started. So, it's um yeah,
[33:16] I'm talking about here tonight on this
[33:17] Sunday night with with the few of us
[33:19] that are here. So, it was it was a
[33:21] fairly small
[33:24] uh congregation. We assume the pastor is
[33:28] a man named Epapris and he came to visit
[33:31] Paul in prison. But it's strange, he
[33:35] doesn't take the letter that Paul writes
[33:37] back to the people.
[33:40] This may have been because Epaparis was
[33:43] imprisoned at the same time Paul was. Or
[33:46] it could have been that he had he had
[33:49] other uh things to do or he was he was
[33:52] caught up away in something else. But it
[33:54] was delivered by a na man named Titicus
[33:58] who I'm going to I'm going to mention
[34:00] when we close out this letter. And Paul
[34:03] mentions uh I didn't count exactly but
[34:05] uh 8 n 10 people in the closing of his
[34:09] letter. So we've got to right up until
[34:12] this point to the very end of the letter
[34:15] to Colasse. And now we are going to read
[34:18] basically the people that he
[34:19] acknowledges at the end. It's actually
[34:22] really interesting.
[34:24] Let's go to Colossians
[34:26] the last chapter. Chapter 4 verse 7
[34:29] verse. I think we left off in verse six.
[34:32] So verse seven,
[34:34] Colossians, thank you.
[34:37] On my state shall Titicus declare unto
[34:40] you, who is a beloved brother and
[34:43] faithful minister and fellow servant in
[34:44] the Lord, whom I have sent unto you for
[34:48] the same purpose, that he might know
[34:50] your estate and comfort your heart. So
[34:53] Ticus, Ticus, he's the one that's
[34:56] delivering the letter, and he's a
[34:58] minister of the gospel. Remember this is
[35:01] a new faith.
[35:03] So everyone is
[35:06] I mean it's it's been maybe around for
[35:08] the the religion had started maybe 40
[35:11] years earlier with Jesus but um it is or
[35:16] less but it it now it is just starting
[35:18] to form. So we have these new ministers
[35:20] also getting out on the field. Verse
[35:23] number nine. So Titicus he's this
[35:25] minister and he's delivering the letter.
[35:28] Verse number nine, with Onesimus, a
[35:30] faithful and beloved brother, who is one
[35:33] of you, they shall make known unto you
[35:36] all things which are done here. Now,
[35:40] right there is a mouthful and you could
[35:42] just might just read over it. Do you
[35:44] know who Onesimus is? There's this book.
[35:48] There's this letter that Paul wrote to
[35:50] this man named Phileiman.
[35:53] The letter to Phileiman was concerning
[35:57] this man Onesimus. Onesimus was a
[36:00] runaway slave from Phileiman. And
[36:03] Phileiman Paul is like, "Hey,
[36:08] charge whatever he owes you to me and
[36:12] accept Onesimus as one of your own." So
[36:15] the whole letter of Phileiman is about
[36:16] this man Onesipus. Ones Onesimus and
[36:19] he's mentioned right here. And what's
[36:23] really neat
[36:25] with Onesimoth Onesimus
[36:28] a faithful and beloved brother who is
[36:32] one of you.
[36:35] He was a slave
[36:37] and now
[36:39] he's he's the subject of this. Paul
[36:42] mentions him. So Paul vouches for
[36:45] Onesimus. Again, showing that Paul, like
[36:48] I mentioned earlier this morning, that
[36:50] Paul is firm on the premises that all
[36:54] Christians are created equal and God is
[36:57] not a respector of persons, bond or
[37:00] slave.
[37:02] And even though this man Onesimus was
[37:04] really technically a criminal, runaway
[37:07] slave, somehow when we when we go
[37:09] through the book of Phileiman, it's it's
[37:10] really amazing. runaway slave that meets
[37:14] Paul and gives his heart to the Lord and
[37:17] then goes back to Phileiman with this
[37:21] letter in hand and probably hoping man I
[37:24] hope I don't get I mean the punishment
[37:27] was probably death for a runaway slave
[37:31] so Paul is saying that this Onesimus
[37:34] he's one of you he's equal to you
[37:37] Aristarus
[37:39] verse number 10 Aristarus My fellow
[37:42] prisoner salutes you and Marcus sister's
[37:47] son to Barnabas
[37:49] touching whom you have received
[37:51] commandments. If he come to you receive
[37:54] him. Aristarus is mentioned in the book
[37:56] of Acts and he's one of Paul's traveling
[37:59] companions.
[38:00] Marcus is famous.
[38:04] Marcus, the King James says Marcus is
[38:07] Barnabas's nephew. Okay. Other
[38:10] translations say he's the cousin. So,
[38:15] it's one of those things that's
[38:16] difficult to nail down in the Bible, but
[38:20] the the point is is he's related to
[38:22] Barnabas. And this is important in the
[38:24] book of Acts. This is the same Marcus,
[38:29] Mark,
[38:30] who most scholars say wrote the Gospel
[38:33] of Mark.
[38:35] This is also the one that Paul probably
[38:37] the one that Paul had the dispute with
[38:39] in the book of Acts. Remember he kind of
[38:41] got cold feet and Mark leaves the trip
[38:45] and Barnabas was upset with Paul when
[38:49] Mark when Mark wants to come back and
[38:51] Paul's like no he left us before.
[38:55] So this is that same one and right here
[38:57] Paul is vouching for Mark or Marcus in
[39:01] the Greek. Later on, Paul pays Mark
[39:05] after in the book of Acts, Paul pays
[39:06] Mark great respect, saying that he's
[39:08] helpful in the ministry. Verse number
[39:11] 11, and Jesus, which is called justice,
[39:15] who are of the circumcision,
[39:17] these are my fellow workers under the
[39:19] kingdom of God, which have been a
[39:20] comfort unto me. Jesus was a common name
[39:25] back then. It's the Greek translation of
[39:29] the Hebrew name Yeshua, Joshua. Very
[39:33] common name back there. This is the
[39:35] Greek pronunciation of that Hebrew name
[39:40] Josh Joshua. And that was Jesus's name.
[39:44] And this man has the same name as Jesus.
[39:47] And he's the apostle here is saying now
[39:49] this is Jesus who is called justice.
[39:51] That's that's the one who are of the
[39:53] circumcision. They're Jews. These are
[39:56] these only are my fellow workers under
[39:58] the kingdom of God which have been a
[40:00] comfort unto me.
[40:02] Epaparis
[40:04] who is one of you a servant of Christ
[40:07] salute you always laboring fervently for
[40:12] you in prayers that he may that you may
[40:14] stand perfect and complete in all the
[40:17] will of God. This is the pastor of the
[40:19] church of Colasse. And Paul is saying in
[40:22] his letter, he's he's greeting you. He
[40:25] loves you. He's always thinking about
[40:27] you. He's praying for you. And that is
[40:29] why really a lot of um Paul is saying
[40:33] that he greets you, but he's not sending
[40:35] the letter. That's why a lot of scholars
[40:36] think, well, he probably was imprisoned
[40:38] because this was really a persecution, a
[40:42] start of a really bad persecution
[40:44] against the Christians.
[40:46] For I bear him record that he has hath
[40:49] great a great zeal for you. This is our
[40:51] pastor. And them that are at Leodysa and
[40:54] them in Hierropolis. So Leodysa is close
[40:59] to Colasse.
[41:01] Luke the beloved physician and Deus
[41:06] greet you. This is the same doctor, this
[41:08] man Luke who wrote the Gospel of Luke.
[41:11] He wrote the book of Acts and he's the
[41:15] beloved friend and traveling companion
[41:17] of Paul, the beloved physician Luke.
[41:21] Now, and Deeus, Deeus,
[41:25] tragically in second Timothy, Deeus
[41:28] backslid and Deeus left the faith and
[41:34] fell in sin of the world.
[41:38] We know that with Paul's last letter
[41:40] that he ever wrote, which was in second
[41:41] Timothy, that Deeus had forsaken him
[41:44] loving the world.
[41:47] And that's about five years or so after
[41:49] this letter is written. So tragic. Deus
[41:52] is he's on point here. But he backslides
[41:56] and uh we don't know whatever happens to
[41:59] him after that. Verse number 15. S
[42:03] salute the brethren which are in
[42:04] Leodysia and Memphis and the church
[42:07] which which is in his house. Leodysia
[42:11] um is a city and it's there's a church
[42:14] in that city. Um interestingly here the
[42:20] um this person Memphis
[42:24] um
[42:25] the King James and the New King James
[42:29] uh talk about this person
[42:32] and Memphis and then they use the
[42:36] masculine pronoun here and Memphis and
[42:39] the church which is in his house.
[42:42] Most other translations more other
[42:45] modern translation use the feminine
[42:49] from the feminine version here where
[42:51] it's Memphis and the church in her
[42:53] house. It's one of those things we
[42:56] simply don't know.
[42:59] And you can look at the reg original
[43:01] Greek uh and you cannot tell is this a
[43:04] man or a woman. Some translations say
[43:07] it's a man. Some translations say it's a
[43:09] woman. Um it it's
[43:12] not a problem with the Bible. They just
[43:16] they don't know. But the the fact is
[43:17] there's a church in this person's house.
[43:20] And the translators really have no way
[43:22] of knowing. Verse number 16. And when
[43:25] this epistle is read among you, cause
[43:28] that it be read also in the church of
[43:30] the Leodysans
[43:32] and that you likewise read the epistle
[43:36] from Leodysia.
[43:39] Another very very interesting thing. So
[43:41] we have this neighboring city much
[43:43] bigger city than Colassi called
[43:44] Leodysia. And it says that hey take this
[43:48] letter that now that I have sent you and
[43:51] now you read that in this other church
[43:54] in Leodysia and take the letter that I
[43:57] sent to Leodysia and read or someone
[44:00] sent to Leodysia and read that in your
[44:04] church in Colasse. What letter
[44:08] is he talking about? This letter to the
[44:11] Leodysans.
[44:14] The fact is we don't know.
[44:16] It could be there really two viable
[44:19] possibilities. It could be that this is
[44:23] a letter that was lost, which is many of
[44:26] them. This is a letter that was sent to
[44:29] the Leodysans from Paul or Apollos or
[44:31] one of the uh apostles to Leodysia that
[44:34] never was recorded, never was put in the
[44:37] canon of the scriptures. Or
[44:40] it could be a letter that we are all
[44:43] familiar with. Let's turn really quick
[44:46] to Revelation chapter
[44:49] three.
[44:51] Revelation chapter 2 and chapter 3
[44:55] are letters written to churches like
[44:58] this. Leodysia,
[45:00] Ephesus, Smyrnia, the church at Smyrnia,
[45:03] the church at Thotyra, the church at
[45:06] Pergamos, the church at
[45:10] Sardis, the church at Philadelphia, and
[45:12] the church at Leodysia.
[45:15] Revelation chapter 3, that church, that
[45:18] letter that was written to the
[45:19] Leodysans,
[45:22] it's and this may be the same one. It
[45:24] may not, but I'll read it quickly. It's
[45:26] only a few verses.
[45:28] Says, "And unto the angel of the church
[45:30] of Leo, of the Leodysans, write these
[45:32] things, sayeth the Amen, the faithful
[45:34] and true witness, the beginning of the
[45:36] creation of God. I know thy works, that
[45:38] thou art neither cold nor hot. I would
[45:40] that thou work cold or hot." So then,
[45:44] because thou art lukewarm, and neither
[45:46] cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my
[45:48] mouth, because thou sayest, I am rich,
[45:51] and increased with goods, and have need
[45:53] of nothing, and knowest not that thou
[45:55] art wretched, and miserable, and poor,
[45:57] and blind, and naked. I counsel thee to
[45:59] buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[46:02] thou mayest be rich and and white
[46:05] reignment that thou mayest be clothed
[46:08] and that thou and that the shame of thy
[46:10] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[46:14] eyes with Isav that thou mayest see. As
[46:17] many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be
[46:20] zealous, therefore, and repent. Behold,
[46:24] I stand at the door and knock. If any
[46:26] man hear my voice and open the door, I
[46:28] will come in to him and will s with him
[46:31] and he with me. To him that overcomemeth
[46:33] will I grant to sit with me in my
[46:36] throne, even as my even as I also
[46:40] overcame, and am set down with my father
[46:43] in his throne. He that hath an ear, let
[46:47] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[46:51] churches.
[46:53] the letter to the Leodysans. Was that
[46:56] this letter that the Apostle Paul says
[46:58] read to the Colossians? We don't know.
[47:02] Could be,
[47:04] maybe not.
[47:07] They're both uh in Asia Minor. They're
[47:09] they're all all those churches are down
[47:11] in that same place.
[47:15] And verse number 17 in Colossians
[47:18] chapter 4.
[47:20] and say to Archipus, "Take heed to the
[47:24] ministry which thou hast received in the
[47:25] Lord that thou fulfill it." We don't
[47:27] know who this man Archipus is, but he
[47:30] could be the pastor possibly of the
[47:33] church at Leodysia.
[47:35] We don't know, but it comes right after
[47:37] he mentions that and that
[47:41] is a possibility there.
[47:44] The last verse, this the salutation by
[47:49] the hand of me, Paul. Remember my bonds.
[47:53] Grace be with you. Amen. So Paul's
[47:56] writing this from Rome where he was
[47:59] eventually beheaded.
[48:02] And so he closes he closes this book,
[48:06] greets these greetss these people and uh
[48:10] then gives it to this man to go and to
[48:14] read to the church. So now we'll we'll
[48:17] move forward with our service. I I
[48:20] wanted to close out and and explain who
[48:24] these people were that he was greeting.
[48:26] And now I would like to, brother Lyall
[48:29] is going to lay a foundation for us
[48:32] reading the whole book, the whole
[48:36] letter. And it's going to be really neat
[48:38] because it's going to be like this is
[48:40] how it was. They were anticipating
[48:42] reading this before. I thought I asked
[48:45] brother Josiah. I said, "Hey, do you
[48:46] know any Jewish songs?" You know, so we
[48:48] could kind of get the feeling. The
[48:51] problem is they're not Jewish people
[48:54] here. there there were gentile people,
[48:56] but there was probably some Jewish a lot
[48:58] of Jewish influence there. So, I asked
[49:00] Brother Josiah if he could sing um one
[49:04] or two songs that could be kind of lay
[49:08] the foundation for brother Lyle here.
[49:33] Let's try something a little different.
[49:36] We're all going to start clapping before
[49:37] the music starts. Okay. So, I'm going to
[49:41] step away from the microphone.
[49:46] [Applause]
[49:52] Don't speed up.
[50:00] [Applause]
[50:05] Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
[50:09] for brothers to dwell together.
[50:13] Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
[50:18] for brothers to dwell together

[52:01] [Music]
[52:01] [Applause]
[52:11] Hopefully I'm not too far in LA.
[52:17] Good evening.
[52:19] You know, when I was a kid, and I was, I
[52:23] love to read mysteries. What happened?
[52:26] What are the clues? How was it resolved?
[52:29] When I was young, I read all the Hardy
[52:31] Boy books. When my vocabulary expanded a
[52:35] bit, I was ready to advance beyond
[52:37] juvenile stories. I read Sherlock Holmes
[52:39] and and Agatha Christie. Well, tonight,
[52:42] our pastor is going to share with us a
[52:44] message from Paul that contains a great
[52:46] mystery, not greatly mysterious, but
[52:50] great like great art. Before brother
[52:55] Daniel shares it with us, let's
[52:57] establish some context. Let's imagine
[53:00] life in the mid 1st century AD.
[53:05] Let's imagine we're in a small city many
[53:07] miles from the coast of western Turkey.
[53:10] The town is Colasse.
[53:14] Now, it's hard to make a leap of almost
[53:16] two millennia, but stepping back in time
[53:19] isn't. We do it all the time.
[53:23] You hear a plane flying over, you look
[53:25] up. There's no plane where the sound is
[53:28] coming from. So you judge the direction
[53:30] the sound is moving and then look ahead
[53:32] in that direction and you see the plane.
[53:35] Light travels faster than sound. So what
[53:39] we see and what we hear are already in
[53:43] the past by the time we experience them.
[53:47] Well, fasten your seat belts. The sound
[53:50] is going really slow and we're going to
[53:52] journey almost 2,000 years in the next
[53:55] few minutes.
[53:57] You've already noticed I'm not using any
[53:59] slides to show you a map or a view of an
[54:02] ancient site. There were no projectors
[54:05] where or or rather when we are going.
[54:08] Imagine you have no cell phone. There's
[54:12] no internet, no computer, no recorded
[54:16] music, CDs, cassette players, vinyl
[54:20] records, wax cylinders.
[54:23] There's no movies, no videos,
[54:27] no photographs,
[54:29] no dishwasher, no washing machine, no
[54:31] clothes dryer, no telephone. No one has
[54:35] any of these things in the entire world.
[54:38] No credit cards. That's a good thing. No
[54:41] ATMs,
[54:43] no grocery stores,
[54:46] no cars,
[54:48] no smoothly paved roads,
[54:50] no railroads, no airplanes,
[54:53] no indoor running water, hot or cold, no
[54:56] indoor plumbing at all. No toilet, no
[54:59] shower, no bathtub,
[55:02] no sink,
[55:04] no glass windows,
[55:06] no fans, no air conditioning, no heater,
[55:11] no thermostats,
[55:13] no natural gas,
[55:16] no electricity.
[55:18] The average person might have a change
[55:20] of clothing,
[55:22] maybe two, no more.
[55:26] No razor to shave. Oh, I wouldn't miss
[55:28] that, I guess. No scissors to trim or
[55:31] cut.
[55:32] Very limited opportunity to bathe.
[55:36] People smell.
[55:38] I mean, they really smell.
[55:41] Hygiene, disease are not yet linked.
[55:45] Public health is poor.
[55:47] No hospital ERS, no real doctors, no
[55:51] nurses, no antiseptic,
[55:54] no chiropractors
[55:56] have a toothache, there's no dentists,
[56:00] there's no toothbrushes, there's no
[56:02] toothpaste.
[56:04] The vast majority of the population
[56:06] works in agriculture. Larger farms are
[56:08] worked by sharecroers or slaves. There
[56:11] are no tractors, no combines, no pumps
[56:15] for irrigation.
[56:17] Taxes are really high. Public officials
[56:22] are almost universally corrupt.
[56:25] Justice is handled by a person most
[56:27] others beside despise who openly
[56:30] practice favoritism, cronyism.
[56:33] Harsh punishments are meed out for the
[56:35] most minor offense, real or imagined.
[56:39] Capital punishment is common. Its
[56:41] administration is swift and public.
[56:45] Men typically married at the age of 12
[56:47] or 13 or 14. Girls often at 11 or 12. If
[56:53] you survive to age 10, you'd you'd
[56:55] probably live to your late 40s or 50s. A
[56:58] few might make it longer. There are no
[57:01] pain medications, no allergy shots, no
[57:05] preventive medicine.
[57:07] Children commonly die before the age of
[57:10] three. Women often die in agony during
[57:14] childbirth.
[57:15] Outbreaks of pestilence are common.
[57:19] The streets are mostly unpaved, though
[57:21] there is a magnificent system of paved
[57:23] roads throughout the empire to allow the
[57:26] efficient movement of the oppressive
[57:28] army. So, a smaller professional army
[57:30] can enforce the will of the emperor and
[57:32] keep the conquered lands suppressed.
[57:36] With few exceptions, in Colasse, you are
[57:39] among the conquered, among the
[57:41] oppressed.
[57:43] There are no public schools. You cannot
[57:45] read or write or do even simple
[57:46] arithmetic. There's no eyeglasses to
[57:49] help you see hearing aids to help combat
[57:52] deafness. There's no social security.
[57:55] There's no retirement, no voting. You
[57:58] have no say in your government. Living
[58:02] quarters are small and simple.
[58:06] And cities, they're crowded.
[58:09] To be sure, there are some cities and in
[58:12] every region there are temples and
[58:13] public buildings all the more to be
[58:15] admired because of their scarcity.
[58:19] The religion of the society is paganism.
[58:22] It's the worship of a whole pantheon of
[58:24] gods, the local area god and and a host
[58:27] of other gods or goddesses who seek
[58:29] their own pleasure. They're capriccious,
[58:33] impulsive, unpredictable, often cruel.
[58:38] You were taught to appease them through
[58:39] sacrifices and gifts to the temple
[58:42] priests.
[58:44] You work seven days a week, dawn to
[58:47] dusk, and you have done so since age
[58:50] seven or eight. You look forward to the
[58:53] occasional festival marked with excess
[58:56] of all kinds. There's no concept of an
[58:59] afterlife. There's no creator. This
[59:02] life, harsh, brutal, often cruel, is all
[59:07] there is.
[59:09] There's a small synagogue where a race
[59:11] of people from the province of Judea
[59:13] worship their invisible god whose name
[59:16] they refuse to pronounce. They claim
[59:19] they are his chosen ones, but they're
[59:21] just as oppressed as everyone else. What
[59:24] benefit is it to be chosen by their
[59:26] deity?
[59:28] This is there's a small splintered group
[59:30] of Judean people as well as others who
[59:32] claim a Messiah, a deliverer
[59:34] commissioned by their God has has come
[59:37] to save them from punishment after death
[59:38] and instead give them a happy life after
[59:40] death.
[59:42] Some claim he was actually God,
[59:45] but he was killed in a painful,
[59:47] humiliating way. There's there's a rumor
[59:49] among some that he rose from the dead,
[59:51] but he seems to have disappeared in a
[59:53] fog or a cloud or something after a
[59:55] while, and nobody's seen him since.
[59:58] Many claim he's returning soon. The
[1:00:01] followers of the way, as they call
[1:00:03] themselves, have no temples. They meet
[1:00:06] in the houses of their better off
[1:00:08] members, the ones with larger houses. A
[1:00:11] few of them have been tutored and can
[1:00:14] read.
[1:00:15] Colasse itself was once at a major trade
[1:00:18] crossroads, but the Romans built a
[1:00:19] better road and bypassed Colasse several
[1:00:22] decades ago. The town has been in
[1:00:24] decline ever since the bypass was built.
[1:00:29] There are other towns nearby. Leodysia
[1:00:31] and Hieropoulos.
[1:00:33] Colasse has cold water springs and
[1:00:36] Heropouloolis has hot springs. They both
[1:00:38] draw some wealthy travelers. Leodysia
[1:00:41] has neither. Its water is lukewarm.
[1:00:45] The nearest major city is Ephesus, some
[1:00:47] hundred miles to the west.
[1:00:51] We've seen Colasse here through the eyes
[1:00:53] of a typical pagan inhabitant. Now,
[1:00:55] let's see it from the perspective of a
[1:00:58] recent convert to the way.
[1:01:02] A gentile named Apaparus heard of a man
[1:01:05] named Paul in Ephesus some years ago and
[1:01:08] was able to meet him. Apapris later
[1:01:10] returned to Colasse began to tell people
[1:01:12] about Jesus, the Jewish Messiah. His
[1:01:15] efforts enjoyed some success. There's a
[1:01:17] small fellowship that meets when they
[1:01:19] can in his or others homes, including
[1:01:22] that of Phileiman, a wellto-do
[1:01:24] businessman and slave owner. He had a
[1:01:27] slave named Onimus who ran away some
[1:01:29] time ago.
[1:01:31] There have been some traveling teachers
[1:01:33] that have come through town with all
[1:01:34] sorts of revelations, visitations,
[1:01:38] philosophies that they claim are from
[1:01:40] God. Your your background is is is
[1:01:43] pagan. You're uncertain of these things,
[1:01:45] but some of them sound okay.
[1:01:48] You have to ask questions and try to
[1:01:51] remember the answer since you can't
[1:01:52] write anything down to refer to later.
[1:01:56] Are we back in mid first century
[1:01:58] Colasse? Now,
[1:02:00] word has reached you this evening. We're
[1:02:02] going to meet because Phileiman has had
[1:02:04] two messengers arrive at his home
[1:02:07] bearing two parchments written by Paul
[1:02:09] himself.
[1:02:11] Paul.
[1:02:12] One is a private note to Phileiman.
[1:02:16] Imagine being personally recognized by
[1:02:18] the great man himself.
[1:02:21] And the other is directed specifically
[1:02:24] to our small fellowship.
[1:02:27] Tikius, Paul's messenger, is going to
[1:02:30] read the letter to us. After a bit of a
[1:02:33] walk, we're here. The space is not
[1:02:36] large. We're a bit crowded. The
[1:02:39] weather's warm, not much of a breeze
[1:02:42] today. The mosquitoes are very hungry.
[1:02:44] Biting flies are numerous from the barn
[1:02:47] next door.
[1:02:48] Phileiman introduces Tyius, Takius, and
[1:02:52] Oniminus, the messengers who brought the
[1:02:54] parchments from Paul. Sh. Quiet now.
[1:02:59] Tikius is about to read the letter to
[1:03:01] us.
[1:03:09] I think
[1:03:11] that as this man read this letter to the
[1:03:15] church,
[1:03:17] he might have said that you probably all
[1:03:19] heard of Paul. He's this man that
[1:03:22] persecuted Christians
[1:03:24] that condemned them to death and prison.
[1:03:28] And this man was on the road to Damascus
[1:03:32] and was struck down by a great light.
[1:03:35] and went blind.
[1:03:38] And the actual resurrected
[1:03:41] Jesus Christ spoke to this man directly.
[1:03:45] And this man is the one that wrote this
[1:03:47] letter.
[1:03:50] And I think that it's a great honor for
[1:03:52] us here today that we can read the same
[1:03:56] letter that's been preserved.
[1:03:58] the letter to the Colossians and I think
[1:04:01] also the letter to us here at the Tucson
[1:04:05] Tabernacle.
[1:04:08] It reads like this. This letter is from
[1:04:11] Paul
[1:04:13] chosen by the will of God to be an
[1:04:15] apostle of G of Christ Jesus from our
[1:04:18] brother Timothy.
[1:04:20] We are writing to God's people in the
[1:04:23] city of Colasse who are faithful
[1:04:25] brothers and sisters in Christ. May God
[1:04:27] our Father give you grace and peace.
[1:04:31] We always pray for you and we give
[1:04:32] thanks to God the Father of our Lord
[1:04:35] Jesus Christ. For we have heard of your
[1:04:37] faith in Christ Jesus and your love for
[1:04:40] all of God's people, which come from
[1:04:42] your confident hope of what God has
[1:04:46] reserved for you in heaven. You have had
[1:04:48] this expectation ever since you first
[1:04:50] heard the truth of the good news.
[1:04:54] The same good news that came to you is
[1:04:57] going out all over the world. It's
[1:04:59] bearing fruit everywhere by changing
[1:05:01] lives just as it changed your lives from
[1:05:04] the day that you first heard and
[1:05:05] understood the truth about God's
[1:05:08] wonderful grace.
[1:05:10] You learned about the good news from
[1:05:12] Epapris, our beloved coworker. He is
[1:05:15] Christ's faithful servant and he is
[1:05:17] helping us on your behalf. He has told
[1:05:21] us about the love for others that the
[1:05:24] Holy Spirit has given you.
[1:05:27] So we have not stopped praying for you
[1:05:29] since we first heard about you. And we
[1:05:32] ask God to give you complete knowledge
[1:05:35] of his will and to give you spiritual
[1:05:38] wisdom and understanding.
[1:05:41] Then the way you live will always honor
[1:05:43] and please the Lord and your lives will
[1:05:45] produce every kind of good fruit. All
[1:05:48] the while, you will grow as you learn to
[1:05:51] know God better and better. We also pray
[1:05:54] that you will be strengthened with all
[1:05:55] his glorious power. So you will have all
[1:05:58] the endurance and patience you need. May
[1:06:00] you be filled with joy, always thinking,
[1:06:04] always thanking the father. He has
[1:06:06] enabled you to share in the inher the
[1:06:09] inheritance that belongs to his people
[1:06:11] who live in the light.
[1:06:14] For he has rescued us from the kingdom
[1:06:16] of darkness and transferred us into the
[1:06:18] kingdom of his dear son who purchased
[1:06:22] our freedom and forgave our sins.
[1:06:26] Christ is the visible image of the
[1:06:30] invisible God.
[1:06:32] He existed before anything was created
[1:06:34] and is supreme over all creation. For
[1:06:37] through him God created everything in in
[1:06:40] the heavenly realms and on the earth.
[1:06:42] And he made the things that we can see,
[1:06:45] the things that that he and the things
[1:06:47] that we can't see, such as thrones and
[1:06:49] kingdoms and rules and authorities,
[1:06:52] rulers and authorities in the unseen
[1:06:54] world. Everything was created through
[1:06:57] him and for him.
[1:07:00] He existed before anything else. And he
[1:07:03] holds all creation together.
[1:07:12] Christ is also the head of the church
[1:07:14] which is his body. He is the beginning
[1:07:18] supreme over all who rise from the dead.
[1:07:21] So he is first in everything.
[1:07:25] For God in all his fullness was pleased
[1:07:28] to live in Christ. And through him God
[1:07:31] reconciled everything to himself. He
[1:07:33] made peace with everything in heaven and
[1:07:35] on earth by means of Christ's blood on
[1:07:38] the cross.
[1:07:41] This includes you.
[1:07:45] This includes you
[1:07:48] who were once far away from God.
[1:07:51] You were his enemies,
[1:07:53] separated from him by your evil thoughts
[1:07:56] and actions.
[1:07:58] Yet now he has reconciled you to himself
[1:08:01] through the death of Christ in his
[1:08:03] physical body.
[1:08:05] As a result, he has brought you into his
[1:08:08] own presence and you are holy and
[1:08:11] blameless as you stand before him
[1:08:13] without a single fault.
[1:08:17] But you must continue to believe this
[1:08:19] truth and stand firmly in it. Don't
[1:08:22] drift away from the assurance you
[1:08:23] received. From the assurance that you
[1:08:26] received when you heard the good news.
[1:08:28] The good news has been preached all over
[1:08:30] the world. And I, Paul, have been
[1:08:31] appointed as God's servant to proclaim
[1:08:34] it.
[1:08:35] I am glad when I suffer for you in my
[1:08:38] body. For I am participating in the
[1:08:40] sufferings of Christ that continue for
[1:08:42] his body, the church.
[1:08:46] God has given me the responsibility of
[1:08:47] serving his church by proclaiming his
[1:08:50] entire message to you.
[1:08:54] This message was kept secret for
[1:08:56] centuries and generations past, but now
[1:08:59] it has been revealed to God's people.
[1:09:01] For God wanted them to know that the
[1:09:04] riches and glory of Christ are for you
[1:09:07] Gentiles, too.
[1:09:15] So
[1:09:19] we tell others about Christ
[1:09:23] warning everyone.
[1:09:27] Sorry I I I Paul's writing is a bit
[1:09:30] messy and a bit large.
[1:09:34] Verse number 27. For God wanted them to
[1:09:37] know that the riches, if you know your
[1:09:39] Bible, you know what I'm talking about.
[1:09:42] Paul wrote in large letters because he
[1:09:44] couldn't see
[1:09:46] very well. For God wanted them to know
[1:09:48] that the riches and glory of Christ are
[1:09:50] for you Gentiles too. And this is the
[1:09:53] secret.
[1:09:55] Christ lives in you.
[1:10:00] Brethren, can I read that verse again?
[1:10:04] This is a This message was kept secret
[1:10:06] for centuries and generations past, but
[1:10:09] now it has been revealed to God's
[1:10:11] people. For God wanted them to know that
[1:10:14] the riches and glory of Christ are for
[1:10:17] you Gentiles too. And this is the
[1:10:20] secret. Christ lives in you.
[1:10:25] This gives you assurance of sharing his
[1:10:28] glory.
[1:10:30] So we tell others about Christ, warning
[1:10:32] everyone and teaching everyone with all
[1:10:34] wisdom and that God has given us. We
[1:10:38] want to present them to God perfect in
[1:10:40] their relationship to Christ.
[1:10:48] That's why I work and struggle so hard
[1:10:50] depending on Christ's mighty power that
[1:10:52] works within me. I want you to know how
[1:10:56] much I have agonized for you and for the
[1:10:59] church at Leodysia
[1:11:01] and for many other believers who have
[1:11:02] never met me personally. I want them to
[1:11:05] be encouraged and knit together by
[1:11:08] strong ties of love.
[1:11:13] I want them to have complete confidence
[1:11:15] that they understand God's mysterious
[1:11:17] plan which is Christ himself.
[1:11:23] In him lie hidden all the treasures of
[1:11:27] wisdom and knowledge.
[1:11:31] I'm telling you this so no one will
[1:11:35] deceive you with well-crafted arguments.
[1:11:38] For though I am far away from you, my
[1:11:40] heart is with you and I rejoice that you
[1:11:42] are living as you should and that your
[1:11:44] faith is Christ in in Christ is strong.
[1:11:48] And now just as you just as you accepted
[1:11:51] Christ Jesus as your Lord, you must
[1:11:54] continue to follow him,
[1:11:57] let your roots grow down into him and
[1:12:01] let your lives be built on him.
[1:12:05] Then your faith will grow strong in the
[1:12:08] truth you were taught, and you will
[1:12:11] overflow with thankfulness.
[1:12:15] Don't let anyone capture you with empty
[1:12:17] philosophies and high sounding nonsense
[1:12:19] that come from human thinking and from
[1:12:21] the spiritual powers of this world
[1:12:23] rather than from Christ.
[1:12:27] For in Christ lives all the fullness of
[1:12:30] God in a human body.
[1:12:33] So you also are complete through your
[1:12:35] union with Christ who is the head over
[1:12:38] every ruler and authority. When you came
[1:12:40] to Christ, you were circumcised,
[1:12:43] but not by the physical procedure.
[1:12:46] Christ performed a spiritual
[1:12:48] circumcision, the cutting away of your
[1:12:50] sinful nature, for you were buried with
[1:12:52] Christ when you were baptized.
[1:12:56] And with him, you were raised to new
[1:12:58] life because you trusted the mighty
[1:13:00] power of God who raised Christ from the
[1:13:02] dead. You were dead because of your sins
[1:13:05] and because of your sinful nature was
[1:13:08] not yet cut away.
[1:13:10] Then God made you alive with Christ for
[1:13:13] he forgave all our sins.
[1:13:15] He canceled the record of the charges
[1:13:18] against us and took it away by nailing
[1:13:21] it to the cross.
[1:13:30] In this way he disarmed the spiritual
[1:13:32] rulers and authorities. He shamed them
[1:13:35] publicly by his victory over them on the
[1:13:37] cross.
[1:13:42] So don't let anyone condemn you for what
[1:13:45] you eat or drink
[1:13:47] or for not celebrating certain certain
[1:13:49] holy days or new moon ceremonies or
[1:13:51] Sabbaths.
[1:13:53] For these rules are only shadows of the
[1:13:55] reality yet to come. And Christ himself
[1:13:58] is that reality.
[1:14:03] Don't let anyone condemn you by
[1:14:04] insisting
[1:14:07] unpas self-denial or the worship of
[1:14:09] angels saying saying they have had
[1:14:11] visions
[1:14:14] about these things and their sinful
[1:14:16] minds have made them proud
[1:14:19] and they are not connected to Christ the
[1:14:21] head of the body for he holds the whole
[1:14:23] body together with its joints and
[1:14:25] ligaments and it grows as God nourishes
[1:14:28] it nourishes it. You have died with
[1:14:31] Christ and he has set you free from the
[1:14:34] spiritual powers of this world. So why
[1:14:36] do you keep on following the rules of
[1:14:38] the world such as don't handle, don't
[1:14:41] taste, don't touch? Such rules are mere
[1:14:44] human teachings about things that
[1:14:47] deteriorate as we use them. These rules
[1:14:49] may seem wise because they require
[1:14:51] strong devotions, pious self-denial, and
[1:14:54] severe bodily discipline, but they
[1:14:56] provide no help in conquering a person's
[1:14:59] evil desires.
[1:15:02] Since you have been raised
[1:15:04] to new life with Christ, set your sights
[1:15:06] on the reality of heaven,
[1:15:09] where Christ sits in the place of honor
[1:15:12] at God's right hand. Think about the
[1:15:14] things of heaven, not about the things
[1:15:16] of the earth.
[1:15:20] For you died to this life
[1:15:23] and your life is hidden with Christ in
[1:15:25] God.
[1:15:27] And when Christ who is your life is
[1:15:29] revealed to the whole world, you will
[1:15:32] share in all his glory.
[1:15:35] So put to death the sinful earthly
[1:15:37] things lurking within you. Have nothing
[1:15:39] to do with sexual immorality, impurity,
[1:15:42] lust, evil desires. Don't be greedy for
[1:15:45] a greedy person is an idolattor
[1:15:47] worshiping the things of this world.
[1:15:49] Because of these sins, the anger of God
[1:15:51] is coming. You used to do these things
[1:15:55] when your life was still part of this
[1:16:00] world.
[1:16:02] But now is the time to get rid of anger,
[1:16:06] rage,
[1:16:07] malicious behavior, slander, dirty
[1:16:10] language.
[1:16:12] Don't lie to each other. For you have
[1:16:15] stripped off your old sinful nature and
[1:16:17] all its wicked deeds. Put on your new
[1:16:20] nature and be renewed as you learn to
[1:16:23] know your creator and become like him in
[1:16:26] this new life. It doesn't matter if you
[1:16:28] are a Jew or a Gentile, circumcised or
[1:16:31] uncircumcised, barbaric, uncivilized,
[1:16:34] slave or free. Christ is all that
[1:16:36] matters and he lives in all of us.
[1:16:41] Since God chose you to be the holy
[1:16:43] people he loves, you must clothe
[1:16:45] yourselves with tenderhearted mercy,
[1:16:48] kindness, humility, gentleness,
[1:16:52] patience. Make allowance for each
[1:16:54] other's faults, and forgive anyone who
[1:16:57] offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave
[1:17:00] you, so you must forgive others.
[1:17:03] Above all, clothe yourselves with love
[1:17:09] which binds us all together in perfect
[1:17:12] harmony. And let the peace that comes
[1:17:15] from Christ rule in your hearts. For as
[1:17:18] members of one body, you are called to
[1:17:21] live in peace
[1:17:23] and always be thankful.
[1:17:26] Let the message about Christ in all its
[1:17:29] richness fill your lives. teach and
[1:17:33] counsel each other with all the wisdom
[1:17:35] that he gives. Sing psalms and hymns and
[1:17:39] spiritual songs to God with thankful
[1:17:42] hearts. And whatever you do or say, do
[1:17:46] it as a representative of the Lord
[1:17:48] Jesus, giving thanks through him to the
[1:17:51] to God the Father. Wives, submit your to
[1:17:55] your husbands as is fitting for those
[1:17:58] who belong to the Lord. Husbands, love
[1:18:00] your wives and never treat them harshly.
[1:18:04] Children, always obey your parents, for
[1:18:07] this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not
[1:18:10] aggravate your children or they will
[1:18:11] become discouraged. Slaves, obey your
[1:18:13] earthly masters in everything you do.
[1:18:17] Try to please them all the time, not
[1:18:19] just when they are watching you. Serve
[1:18:21] them sincerely because of your reverent
[1:18:24] fear of the Lord.
[1:18:27] Work willingly in whatever you do as
[1:18:31] though you were working for the Lord
[1:18:33] rather than for people.
[1:18:35] Remember that the Lord will give you an
[1:18:37] inheritance as your reward and that the
[1:18:40] master you are serving is Christ.
[1:18:47] Let me read that verse again.
[1:18:50] Remember that the Lord will give you an
[1:18:52] inheritance as your reward and that the
[1:18:55] master you are serving is Christ.
[1:18:59] But if you do what is wrong, you will be
[1:19:02] paid back for the wrong that you have
[1:19:04] done. For God has no favorites.
[1:19:07] Masters, be just and fair to your
[1:19:10] slaves. Remember that you also have a
[1:19:13] master in heaven.
[1:19:22] Devote yourselves to prayer with an
[1:19:25] alert mind and a thankful heart. Pray
[1:19:28] for us too.
[1:19:30] That God will give us many opportunities
[1:19:32] to speak about his mysterious plan
[1:19:34] concerning Christ.
[1:19:38] That is why I am here in chains. Pray
[1:19:41] that I will proclaim this message as
[1:19:43] clearly as I should. Live wisely among
[1:19:46] those who are not believers and make the
[1:19:49] most of every opportunity.
[1:19:52] Let your conversation be gracious and
[1:19:54] attractive so that you will have the
[1:19:56] right response for everyone.
[1:20:00] Ticus will I give will give you a full
[1:20:03] report of how I am getting along. He is
[1:20:05] a beloved brother and a faithful helper
[1:20:07] who serves with me in the Lord's work. I
[1:20:11] has sent him to you for this very
[1:20:13] purpose to let you know how we are doing
[1:20:16] and to encourage you. I am also sending
[1:20:19] Onesimus a faithful beloved brother, one
[1:20:22] of your own people. He Anticus will tell
[1:20:26] you everything that is happening here.
[1:20:30] Aristoarkus
[1:20:31] who is in prison with me sends you his
[1:20:34] greetings and so does Mark Barnabas's
[1:20:38] cousin. As you were instructed before,
[1:20:40] make Mark welcome if he comes your way.
[1:20:43] Jesus, the one we call justice, also
[1:20:45] sends his greetings. These are the only
[1:20:48] Jewish believers among my co-workers.
[1:20:50] They are working with me here for the
[1:20:53] kingdom of God. And what a comfort they
[1:20:56] have been.
[1:20:58] Epaparis, a member of your own
[1:21:00] fellowship and a servant of G of Christ
[1:21:02] Jesus, send you his greetings. He always
[1:21:06] pray. He always prays earnestly for you.
[1:21:08] asking God to make you strong and
[1:21:10] perfect, fully confident that you are
[1:21:13] following the whole will of God. I can
[1:21:16] assure you that he prays hard for you
[1:21:19] and also for the believers in Leodysia
[1:21:22] in Hierropolis.
[1:21:24] Luke, the beloved doctor
[1:21:26] sends his greetings and so does Deeus.
[1:21:29] Please give my greetings to our brothers
[1:21:31] and sisters at Leodysia and Nympha and
[1:21:33] the church that meets in her house. And
[1:21:35] after you have read this letter, pass it
[1:21:37] on to the church at Leodysia so they can
[1:21:40] read it too. And you should read the
[1:21:42] letter that I wrote to them.
[1:21:45] And say to Archipus, be sure to carry
[1:21:49] out the ministry of the Lord, the
[1:21:51] ministry that the Lord gave you.
[1:21:54] Here's my greeting
[1:21:56] in my own handwriting. Paul,
[1:22:00] remember my chains and may God's grace
[1:22:03] be with you.
[1:22:06] The epistle of the Apostle Paul to the
[1:22:10] church at Colasse.
[1:22:17] I feel like maybe I shouldn't even
[1:22:19] preach anymore. I should just read.
[1:22:22] How beautiful are the words of the
[1:22:25] Apostle Paul.
[1:22:27] I appreciate
[1:22:29] the uh the translation, the New Living
[1:22:32] Translation. It makes it very easy to
[1:22:34] understand. It's not the um my primary
[1:22:38] Bible, but it's u it's it's a nice
[1:22:42] um real world, real life um
[1:22:45] conversational Bible.
[1:22:48] And I I do appreciate
[1:22:52] I believe it's the same spirit that when
[1:22:55] I was reading felt like it was the same
[1:22:58] spirit that maybe Paul wrote it and it
[1:23:00] just felt good. So he was he was
[1:23:03] encouraging us. He's encouraging us to
[1:23:05] stay straight. Stay straight with the
[1:23:07] word. Do you love the word?
[1:23:10] Do you love the book of Colossians?
[1:23:13] Do you remember? Do you will you
[1:23:15] remember it now? What it's about and who
[1:23:18] wrote it and um that Paul never even met
[1:23:24] those people, but he still had a burden
[1:23:25] for him and he loved him. God bless you,
[1:23:28] brother. Michael, you could close.
[1:23:32] Oh, is it you?
[1:23:34] No, Josiah's got another one. Yeah. I
[1:23:38] love these these like I don't know what
[1:23:41] you call them, but these Jewish sounding
[1:23:43] songs,
[1:23:47] E minor.
[1:23:51] You should know this one.
[1:23:54] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[1:23:59] my heart, I will dance like David
[1:24:04] dance.
[1:24:07] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[1:24:12] my heart, I will dance like David dance.
[1:24:20] I will dance.
[1:24:23] I will dance.
[1:24:26] I will dance like David dance.

[1:24:43] dance. When the spirit When the spirit
[1:24:47] of the Lord comes upon my I will sing. I
[1:24:52] will sing like David sang.
[1:24:58] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[1:25:03] my heart, I will sing like David sang.
[1:25:11] I will sing.
[1:25:14] I will sing.
[1:25:17] I will sing. Like David said,
[1:25:23] I will sing.
[1:25:27] I will sing.
[1:25:30] I will sing like David.
[1:25:34] I will shout. And when the spirit of the
[1:25:38] Lord comes upon my heart, I will shout
[1:25:44] like David shouts.
[1:25:48] And when the spirit of the Lord comes
[1:25:52] upon my heart, I will shout like David
[1:25:59] shouts. Hallelujah. Oh, I will shout.
[1:26:04] I will shout.
[1:26:07] I will shout like David. Shout.
[1:26:14] I will shout.
[1:26:18] Shout.
[1:26:20] I will shout like David. One more time.
[1:26:24] When the spirit When the spirit of the
[1:26:28] Lord comes upon my I will dance. I will
[1:26:33] dance like David dance.
[1:26:39] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[1:26:43] my heart, I will dance like David
[1:26:49] dance.
[1:26:51] I will dance.
[1:26:54] I will dance.
[1:26:57] I will dance like David.
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:02] [Applause]
[1:27:04] I will dance.
[1:27:07] I will dance.
[1:27:10] I will dance like David dance.
[1:27:16] [Applause]
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:18] Oh, praise God.
[1:27:21] Brother Josiah, we got to sing it again.
[1:27:23] That was just Praise the Lord.
[1:27:26] Ah, brothers and sisters, I love God's
[1:27:31] word.
[1:27:33] I love the Bible. If we could just get
[1:27:36] in that spirit, that same spirit that
[1:27:39] Paul wrote those epistles, the same
[1:27:42] spirit that the gospels were written,
[1:27:45] the same spirit that was upon those in
[1:27:47] the book of Acts, if we could just get
[1:27:49] in that spirit, in that same spirit that
[1:27:53] anointed David to write the Psalms, in
[1:27:56] the same spirit, as the Bible says right
[1:27:58] at the beginning, the same spirit that
[1:28:00] moved across the face of the deep,
[1:28:04] that Holy Spirit, the same spirit that
[1:28:07] fell at the day of Pentecost when the
[1:28:09] tongues of fire were over at 120 in the
[1:28:11] upper room. When that if that same
[1:28:14] spirit could just fall upon us,
[1:28:19] oh,
[1:28:20] it is the desire of my heart and I
[1:28:22] believe that that will lead to the
[1:28:24] rapture
[1:28:26] of the bride to meet the bridegroom.
[1:28:30] Praise God. Brother Ron, if you would
[1:28:32] come up and close. Brother Josiah,
[1:28:34] please one more time.
[1:28:37] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[1:28:41] my heart, I will dance like David.
[1:28:46] [Applause]
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:28:48] And when the spirit of the Lord comes
[1:28:52] upon my heart, I will dance like David.
[1:29:00] Yes, I will dance. Dance
[1:29:04] I will dance.
[1:29:07] I will dance like David dance.
[1:29:13] I will dance.
[1:29:16] I will dance.
[1:29:19] I will dance like David. Dance. I will
[1:29:23] dance. Yes, I will dance.
[1:29:27] I will dance.
[1:29:30] I will dance like David.
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:36] I will dance.
[1:29:39] I will dance.
[1:29:42] I will dance.
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:47] [Applause]
[1:29:49] Praise God. Feels good.
[1:29:52] Just dance.
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:58] Yeah. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:01] It's the word. Where do you stop? You
[1:30:04] can't. You can't. You just have to
[1:30:06] pause.
[1:30:07] Can we pray?
[1:30:10] Lord, it's it's it's been good that
[1:30:12] we've been here tonight. Amen. We have
[1:30:15] listened to your word and I believe it's
[1:30:17] been brought in the right spirit that
[1:30:19] was given him. So we pray we'd take the
[1:30:23] spirit of the word and we know you are
[1:30:25] the word Lord and that we are to become
[1:30:28] the word and our hearts are just
[1:30:32] as as we ponder these thoughts that
[1:30:36] that Apostle Paul the first church age
[1:30:39] messenger that he started writing these
[1:30:42] these revelations about a deeper walk
[1:30:45] with Christ that they were not aware of.
[1:30:48] And no doubt, Lord, that when these
[1:30:51] words were read to these people, they
[1:30:54] go, "My,
[1:30:56] we didn't know that." Yeah. Amen. We
[1:30:58] didn't know that. Oh, yeah. How they
[1:31:00] must have rejoiced. Yes. Amen. That they
[1:31:03] were learning more things. They had
[1:31:05] heard, but one that had an experience
[1:31:09] and a reputation, Lord, that they could
[1:31:11] take what he said. And Lord, as as that
[1:31:14] word is written, I I pray, Lord, that
[1:31:17] each and every one of us would not take
[1:31:18] it for granted, but our hearts would
[1:31:21] remain young
[1:31:24] as a child. We've learned a new thing,
[1:31:26] and it excites us, Lord, that we
[1:31:30] I personally, Lord Jesus, I I am so glad
[1:31:35] for your word and your revelation, but
[1:31:39] I'm reluctant, Lord, as as I pause
[1:31:45] Is it appropriate, Father, that we say
[1:31:48] some things, but
[1:31:50] you told Nicodemus, you must be born
[1:31:53] again.
[1:31:55] We know your spirit fell on David. Amen.
[1:31:58] But Lord, he was not born again. He
[1:32:02] wasn't.
[1:32:04] A new thing you did, Lord, in this
[1:32:06] generation. That's right. Oh my.
[1:32:10] a new thing you did and you were
[1:32:13] revealing yourself through your prophets
[1:32:15] and your your Holy Spirit, Lord, that we
[1:32:20] can be new creatures in Christ,
[1:32:23] that we can rise up above these these
[1:32:27] carnal temptations, Lord. That your word
[1:32:31] says that we can be like you.
[1:32:34] And we believe this by faith. We don't
[1:32:37] look upon ourselves, Lord, but we trust
[1:32:39] you and your calling and your choosing.
[1:32:44] And Lord God, we are just so grateful.
[1:32:47] Our hearts are overwhelmed.
[1:32:49] And I pray, Lord, that I never lose the
[1:32:51] joy of my salvation.
[1:32:55] I just tonight, Lord, I am so glad and I
[1:32:58] pray each and everyone will just stop
[1:33:02] for a moment and just realize how
[1:33:04] precious these times are that one day
[1:33:08] we'll look back and say, "My, wasn't
[1:33:10] that a wonderful time in in the Lord?"
[1:33:13] So, let's be a present of mine and just
[1:33:16] give you thanks tonight, Lord, for what
[1:33:17] you've done for us right now. It's good.
[1:33:20] Yes. Go with us, Lord. each and everyone
[1:33:23] to their own homes and let them ponder
[1:33:25] these words. Lord, let them wake in the
[1:33:28] night and think upon these things. Wake
[1:33:31] in the morning and rejoice.
[1:33:34] Oh God, we are so glad. We are not
[1:33:37] creatures of fear. For we know love has
[1:33:40] cast out this fear. And we love you. We
[1:33:43] love your word and we love your people.
[1:33:45] Thank you, Lord. We have nothing to fear
[1:33:48] but only you, Lord. And your fear is a
[1:33:51] holy fear. Father, so teach us to fear
[1:33:54] you, Lord. We pray, Father, that you
[1:33:57] would continue being with each and
[1:33:59] everyone. We thank you for this time
[1:34:03] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:34:06] Amen.
[1:34:08] I have a question. If I was one of the
[1:34:11] ones in the congregation, can I have a
[1:34:13] copy of that?
[1:34:15] Wouldn't you want a copy of that? Yeah,
[1:34:17] that's what a scribe is for. Absolutely.
[1:34:19] Yeah. Praise God. And then you know what
[1:34:22] he said is right. That's the same
[1:34:24] spirit.
[1:34:26] Hey, can I get a copy of that
[1:34:30] and then they wrote a copy and then they
[1:34:33] wrote another copy and then another
[1:34:35] copy. Start distributing them and then
[1:34:39] and then the the letter to the
[1:34:40] Corinthians. They said, "Hey, can I get
[1:34:42] a copy of that one?" The first and the
[1:34:43] second letter. Can I get a copy? Yeah.
[1:34:46] starts copying that and dispersing
[1:34:49] the word of God throughout the world.
[1:34:52] Oh, can I get that testimony from Mark
[1:34:56] about the life of Jesus Christ? I want
[1:34:59] to get that copy. Oh, I want the one
[1:35:01] about from Luke, the one that was
[1:35:04] researched so well. I want I want the
[1:35:06] one from Matthew, the one that was with
[1:35:08] him, the tax collector.
[1:35:11] the same spirit that brother Ron just
[1:35:12] said
[1:35:14] and the gospel ran around the world.
[1:35:16] Brother Josiah asked me a question
[1:35:19] and this is just a beautiful thing.
[1:35:22] He said what language did they speak
[1:35:25] when Jesus was here
[1:35:27] and I said they probably spoke well they
[1:35:29] spoke a number of languages but they sp
[1:35:31] probably to each other they probably
[1:35:32] spoke Aramaic which was the common
[1:35:36] tongue.
[1:35:39] Then he said, "Well, why was the New
[1:35:42] Testament written in Greek
[1:35:45] if they spoke in Aramaic?" And I said,
[1:35:48] "Brother Josiah, you have asked a
[1:35:50] wonderful, wonderful question.
[1:35:53] It was written in Greek
[1:35:56] so that the whole world could understand
[1:35:58] it." And not just the Jewish people. The
[1:36:02] whole New Testament
[1:36:05] is an evangelical
[1:36:08] evangelistic
[1:36:10] document that is meant to go around the
[1:36:13] world and copied and and and spoken and
[1:36:16] done exactly with what we did today,
[1:36:18] brother. That's why it was written in
[1:36:21] that language so everybody including us
[1:36:24] Gentiles could receive it. Amen. Praise
[1:36:28] God. You have one more song with
[1:36:30] Michael.
[1:36:34] Oh yes.
[1:36:36] Oh yes.
[1:36:39] I'm a child
[1:36:41] of a king.
[1:36:45] His royal
[1:36:47] love
[1:36:49] now flows in my
[1:36:54] eyes.
[1:36:57] is riches
[1:36:59] and cloud
[1:37:01] can see.
[1:37:04] Praise God.
[1:37:06] Praise God.
[1:37:09] The child of the king.
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:16] Oh yes.
[1:37:18] Oh yes.
[1:37:21] I'm a child
[1:37:23] of the king.
[1:37:26] His roses
[1:37:32] in my
[1:37:36] life
[1:37:38] is rich
[1:37:40] and fant.
[1:37:44] Praise God.
[1:37:47] Praise God.
[1:37:49] I'm a child of the king. Are you a child
[1:37:54] of the king? Who's a child of the king?
[1:37:57] Rebecca, you're a child of the king.
[1:37:58] Silas, you a child of the king. I am.
[1:38:01] I'm a child of the one that we spoke
[1:38:02] about tonight. Praise the Lord. We got
[1:38:05] to sing it one more time. One more time.
[1:38:07] Oh yes.
[1:38:09] Oh yes.
[1:38:11] I'm a child
[1:38:14] of the king.
[1:38:17] His
[1:38:19] blood
[1:38:22] flows in my feet
[1:38:31] and found
[1:38:35] you. Praise God.
[1:38:37] Praise God.
[1:38:40] I'm a child of the king.
[1:38:45] Dismiss, brothers and sisters. God bless
[1:38:48] you. Keep that book of Colossians. Keep
[1:38:52] it dear to you. It's deep. It's just
[1:38:55] full of meat. Good old gospel meat. Keep
[1:39:00] it close to your heart. Brothers and
[1:39:01] sisters, God bless you. We will um if
[1:39:03] the Lord's willing, I will minister on
[1:39:06] uh probably wrap up the life of Saul
[1:39:10] this Wednesday. And then we have a a
[1:39:13] guest speaker. I believe Ryan Long will
[1:39:15] be ministering for us this coming
[1:39:17] Sunday. God bless you, brothers and
[1:39:19] sisters. You're dismissed.
