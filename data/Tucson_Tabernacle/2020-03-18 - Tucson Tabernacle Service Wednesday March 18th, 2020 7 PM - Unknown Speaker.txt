could just read a little passage of Scripture there was an encouragement to me its Amos 5 verses 1 to 4 I read it just before I came out and it was an encouragement to me maybe it'll be an encouragement to you it says here ye this word which I take up against you even a lamentation a house of Israel the Virgin of Israel has fallen she shall no more rise she's forsaken upon her land there is none to raise her up for thus saith the Lord God the city that went out by a thousand to leave by a hundred and that which went forth by hundreds to leave by ten to the house of Israel it doesn't sound like much of an encouragement there sounds pretty bleak but this verse for jumped out to me he said for thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel Shiki me and ye shall live that's a pretty plain promise there's many people that will survive these days of this panic but they don't know true life that's in Christ but if we'll just seek him well we'll have life and life eternal so it was real blessing to me let's sing greater is He that is in me [Music] me [Music] like Rory [Music] bible tells us in some we go [Music] overcome greater Z Jerzy that that is an on the day of pentecost russian [Applause] blew into [Music] I'm so bad I've got it too graters either [Music] Raiders [Music] that's the truth on the wings of a dove No [Music] he serves [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] God senses sign [Music] Jesus Farsi [Music] k2 he was born in May [Music] region from he must aside all the ways [Music] the wings of us God sends his pores [Music] oh I have [Music] I cried for you [Music] Oh [Music] all the ways [Music] No [Music] - so Smith to trust in Jesus just to take is just to now save Jesus Jesus how I trust him [Music] - oh how sweet these crazy [Music] Jesus [Music] Oh [Music] amen Oh for grace to trust him we got a prayer request sent him so we'll mention a couple here Rebecca Fett Kevlar and for those of us have known her for some time she was Rebecca Joukowsky Cherie arrested for the boyfriend prayer for the boyfriend of her sister-in-law whose name is Chris Chris fell off a ladder 12 foot ladder and had skull fracture in two parts below both clavicles are broken in he has seized several times after the fall he's been in ICU on a ventilator and sedated and cat that's her sister-in-law told a Sunday afternoon that the accident they were planning to get married they were going to elope and then they are now closing down all visitors visiting hours do that due to the kovat so she'd been she had to leave this morning and won't be able to see him for at least two weeks she'll be able to check in with the nurses but that's it so she was requesting that we would remember that and also yesterday when my daughter Sarah came home after dialysis she was a little alarmed or a little apprehensive as is that not all the folks that are normally there going through treatment were not there so made her worried that that maybe this was affecting the possibility of treatment for some of those who desperately need it so she asked me she said tomorrow can you have the church pray about those that are going through treatments or a shut-ins she's specifically men at her meant herself sister Maryanne Salmeron Oh our sister Kelly Batman and I'm sure there are others and things like that so she requested prayer and then she went home and just a little bit after that she sent me a text and it had a quote of the prayer of the message she started listening to so I asked where the Jeremy if he could put it up as brother Brandon was preparing any prayed and he said we would pray for each and every individual and especially for those who are shut-in and cannot get to the services anywhere today go and be with them and may this Easter find a riddle easter for them erasing from the bed and a new health that they have never known before in life Granite Lord so it just it just encouraged her heart in those those are here and maybe even those at home would like to stand right now as will bow our heads and we'll believe we'll take God at His Word as we pray and if there is a request or a need those that are watching and listening and just believe it as we take it before the Lord as we we come to you Lord is you knowing all things there's nothing father that it would catch you by surprise and Lord we know through reading in the scriptures and and through the testimonies and our own experiences you're you're a healer Lord you heal all our diseases all our infirmities you're your God that has an answer to all the questions or there is nothing impossible for you just ask us to to ask and believe Lord so we're asking Lord for this this man named Chris Lord in the family that's involved in his fall Lord that in all this they would turn to you and look to you Lord and as as you would meet with him Lord it would just change our hearts towards you Lord and my daughter Sarah asking for those that there are in her in the same treatment and our sisters that are going through treatment and all these things Lord but your prophet had prayed this prayer Lord and we pray the same prayer Lord be merciful and each one Lord listening in and hearing it has a need Lord that you would go to them now Lord and may they believe and accept and confess what I mean of today Lord we thank you for it Norton now as we prepared to Minister the Word of God today we just ask you to have preeminence Lord letters let us kid ourselves a sign and let something be said Lord through the inspiration that you've placed in my heart Lord to share Lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever and there is no fear Lord we have that confidence even the songs that brother Peter was was singing with the congregation Lord how we have someone we can trust and we can lean on Lord and we can look up for a Redemption draweth nigh we ask it in Jesus Christ amen so be it appreciate the goodness of the Lord in His grace let's read that first Scripture brother Jeremy and proverbs chapter 12 verse 25 I was looking through and just looking for scriptures on this along this line and it says heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop but a good word make you fit glad and I I looked at another translation it says anxiety anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down but a good word maketh it glad so we have the good word of the Lord today so that's good you may be seated so those that are listening in or being streamed in God bless you and you be praying and you be pulling and you'll be asking God to speak also to what your need is and where you're at and that the Lord would speak to us and brother Branham says in a message God provided a way of healing and it was I read this the other day and I had some things this thought on my heart as to look at some of these scriptures and seeing some of the promises that God has given us and I was listening to a portion of brother Branham was was ministering and it was from the message God's provided way of healing he says let me pass something here quickly as our time is going listen he says did you know that the Bible predicts that in the last days that there'll be a germ warfare that diseases will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the Holy Spirit but the angel or who had charged over these plagues was given orders to touch no one on whom the mark was why how much kind of teachers have we got to be brethren to get the church in order to be in that condition immune my arms are sore now from where the doctors has punched needles in to try to inoculate me from yellow fever and so forth I told them I didn't need it but they wouldn't listen to me but I'll tell you what God's going to do God's got a serum and it's called the Holy Ghost and when that serum goes in it will inoculate inoculate you and he says hallelujah and I know without a doubt we have the Holy Spirit so we have that serum we have that in us and so as I was looking at this and and and looking at some of the scriptures brother Branham says in the message principles the principles of divine healing and I found a few places where he makes a statement in different times he says now listen just a moment the Word of God will defeat the devil any place anywhere anytime on any condition when Jesus was here on earth the father was in him God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself we believe that all the fine qualities was was of the father was in him but when he met Satan look how he did it he brought it in your reach and yours yours and all of you see he never used his great gift and he says he went to the Word of God and said it is written so we can take the Word of God because it has been written it hasn't been given to us in second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 and it says for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind not the spirit of fear and today as we see what's going on today in in the in the condition and every day if you're looking at the news or you opening up there's an update after an update there they're talking about the CDC the center of Disease Control and who the World Health Organization their recommendations what we should do what's coming up and you know you can hear from from doctors with great reputations and others who think they know as I was driving in this this afternoon there's evening coming into church and I was thinking Lord how should this come along I you know how should I not just read the scriptures in quote but what is it and I just began I looked out as I got onto the freeway and there's a rainbow down that I said well first of all God is mindful of us we can look at there was a rainbow there and everybody else going down the road I don't know if they looked at it but I did and it meant something to me I said father you're alright you're aware of these things and I began to think of that in the CDC and the WHO and I said but you know and let me just share this with you I got a chance today to talk to a specialist and and this specialist is he's not one could I say it's proud or boast on himself in any way that is not true in fact he can boast on himself because his words are true they've never failed and he's a specialist of specialists he he understands the simplest infirmities what we would say oh it's just a call door just a cut is just an abrasion or something like that to what stumps the doctors today and you know it was actually an opportunity to talk to him today and and was kind of nice cuz he knows me by name - and I know him by name - we happen to be very good friends in fact he told me he loves me he told me he cares for me in fact my condition and my well-being is in his personal care and brother branham called it blessed assurance not necessarily insurance but he called it blessed assurance I have this blessed assurance blessed assurance Jesus is mine so in talking to him and I was telling this to brother Peter a little bit I was saying Lord I don't know how to start this and how to how'd it go but this is just what he started telling me says you can talk to me you can ask me I can share with you I can you know and the opportunity to speak to the physician of physicians to the counselor of counselors to the Prince of Peace and actually have him sit there with you and he says hey it's not just a 15 appointment minute appointment it's for eternity in this where we're in this together if we could say that so it was a comfort to me that just to know that we can talk to him and David said in Psalms 23 verse 4 David says and these are scriptures we all know yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and you know there's times we have to walk should we call it through this through the valley of the shadows through the valley of questioning and and sometimes that walk is right here in our own mind we're concerned we're wondering you know they're saying that this is really affecting the elderly and there was a time when I would look oh that's those people down there but now I'm having to look in the mirror a little bit say oh that's me too but you know he said though I walk in the valley of shadow of death I don't have to fear I don't have to be afraid you guide my steps you show me thy word is a lamp unto my feet and it shows me the way to walk so brother Branham says in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone so then a Satan always tries to coat the word went back and told him when he put him on the pinnacle of the temple and setting and he said it is written and he defeated Satan on the Word of God that shows that you can defeat Satan on the word of God no matter the Word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any condition if it's in the belly of a whale or if it's in the lion's den or it's on the bed with a cancer or slain under yonder bleeding to death in an automobile accident the Word of God will defeat Satan anywhere and the weakest Christian can use it it's your god-given privilege to do it amen so just looking at David said I'm walking through this valley but I don't have to fear God has been there we know this footprints in the sands of time and we look at it and we the story that's written with it and it says God where were you I only see one set of footprints at this time and God tells them they were mine I was carrying you through that that time and sometimes when we feel all alone he says I will fear no evil thy rod and thy staff they comfort me you know just sometimes someone coming by putting their arm around you or maybe if if you raise some children and you're going and you just reach with a hand and you help them along and they look back and the smile on their face and their comfort of like mom and dad here with me I don't have to be afraid it's the same thing with the Lord he reaches down and lets us know he with us Psalms 27:1 the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid and and sometimes we take whom and we might put that well of this person of whatever situation of whatever comes against us I don't have to fear you're gonna die I saw something written that somebody wrote and they posted it and and they were talking as as in in a way where they're saying watching the people today how they're reacting and in everybody trying to go and find all the supplies and and stalk them and get ready and they said I kind of laughed because you're living going through what I lived through every day because I am a person filled with the anxiety this is how I live my life daily I am always anxious I'm always nervous I'm always afraid and I'm seeing you act that way today and I it made me stop and I said Oh for the peace of God and and that comfort we get out of God's Word when he says I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be in you with you to the end of the world he says of whom of what shall I be afraid yeah and then in Psalms 34 for Davis says again I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears an anxious moment may come your way but as soon as you can get a hold of yourself I don't have to fear I don't have to be afraid he has delivered me from all my fears again in putting the whole armor of God brother Branham says we see you Lord we know we're at the end time and the people need strength Satan is charging at then and I'm putting the Word of God in their hands right now in their hearts we defeat Satan with this word come out of these people in the name of Jesus Christ look at their hands look at their faith God look at their hands look at their faith God Satan you're defeated leave them in Jesus name come out had cheer you by the Living God and you know there's so many of us today and and I say yes because I include myself well that was brother branham he had such faith but brother Branham said the weakest Saint on their knees causes Satan to tremble and there sometimes we argue who the weakest saint is because we're all trying to be the weakest saint that's me but it doesn't matter if you war or not second weakest third weakest we all can put him to a running David said that he says I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears there is nothing to to be it and you know fear is a strong spirit it's a very strong spirit those of you that maybe have have had to have that experience or have gone through something where you've been gripped by fear it can in mobilize somebody literally where they can't move they can't they react them you might have seen a video or something where somebody got scared and they're just there motionless frozen and then you see others who are the the scare is not even done and they're a mile down the road already running hard and and you've probably seen them when they prank somebody and do that they do it for laughs well the person they got pranked isn't laughing that's the person cause them right and sometimes Satan will come by that way and try to do because all it is is a prank he doesn't have power over you he doesn't have authority over you that's God's place and all he is doing too is trying just to pull something on you and wants you to get you to freeze or run off in another direction but if you can stand on the Word of God stand your ground and say no to it a simple thing that that granddaddy works in his dream when he he says he's Satan comes at him and begins to to boo at him and he saw himself shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and getting smaller and smaller and he finally said to himself if I hear one more boo I'm going to disappear so he said boo back and sometimes that first boo is just a little boo boo and he noticed it had a reaction so he said boo a little bit more and then boo a little bit more and then bill a little bit more and then just watch Satan shrink down to nothing and we can do the same thing it was a lesson God was showing him and that lesson can be I stand on God's Word Satan you're a liar God's Word I'm not standing my own ability I'm not standing because I'm the overcomer I'm standing here because the overcomers in me and his word is in me and God's Word defeat Satan anywhere anytime anyplace in any condition so we got to stand on that David says in Psalms fifty-six three and four what time I am afraid I will trust in thee if you go through through the Book of Psalms you see David on one side I can I can run through a troop and leap over a wall and on another side where he's saying at what time I am afraid I will trust in thee because I have found you have never failed me you've never left me you know he stood before Goliath and and had he not had the bear in the lion he would have wondered about Goliath but he said the same God that delivered that beer in my hands and delivered that it was going to take you down today he didn't say hey I'm so strong now I can tell you he said that same God that did that is now taking you down it's been guarded so David realized that and we think sometimes he was he was such a great man he was such a powerful man but read all of them songs read all of through the life of job read all and the Bible is very accurate in the description of it all they were like us they had their days they had their times but God's Word never fails never has never will verse 4 in God I will praise His Word in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me you know though God's laid me job said I will trust him with these eyes I shall see my Redeemer there was there was something about that putting their trust in God then he says in 94 19 Psalms 94 19 in the multitude of my thoughts within me like comforts do you like my soul and you know how the multitude of thoughts can become double multitude and triple multitude and non-stop sometimes the little thing that started like this suddenly is this big and then suddenly it's it's it's a simple illustration that we've heard where they went to a football game and they had a huddle and this person has already caught up in the in the conflict of his mind and all and they're having a huddle and that person looks down and says oh no they all huddled up to talk about me and you say I'll come on but hey in the multitude of my thoughts he says thy comforts delight my soul what is God's comforts his word that's how he his comfort he's come and he's taken his word and he is has given it to us he's laid it out to us not only that but he's also showed us that it lives that it's a life that it's not just words in a book but it's something as as Peter and John found out now that same life that was in Jesus was in them and they said look upon us such as we have now in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk you know who was brother Nash that came down he remember a few years back and he was he was I don't remember what country it was he was in and they took him over to the hospital the Heart Hospital and he walks in and he comes in and they begins to pray for some of those folks and he began to pray for everyone in that that Heart Hospital where it was that and he made it sound like a very poor place so not probably weren't at the type of Heart Hospital that we would go into it but more just probably just more a lot of beds with people suffering but he prayed for every single one of them and then he leaves and then he returns later and there was a young lady at the door and she comes up to him and she says do you remember me and he looks at her and says no I don't she says you remember that when you walked in there was one thrown on the floor with no hope and you prayed for me that's me to where if I remember right he said the mayor of the city asked him if he would come and pray for everybody because everybody that he pray for walked out of that possible well was that brother Nash oh is that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today I'm forever you know you say well I'm insignificant I can't oh just a simple word is you're one of God's children I can't reach out and touch somebody David said like like comforts delight my soul in in in this thought as we were have we had the videoconference with brother Matt yesterday and we're discussing how we were going to proceed and brother Lyle Johnson said something out just some ideas and some things and he finished with prayer for one another and even if we're not all in there in the same place there that doesn't mean you can't go over to somebody's house and pray for them you know does it have to know any child of God who has God in them has that same authority they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover they shall anoint with oil and they shall be made well only the priests only in the minister no every child to go out so we have these promises we do not need to fear we do not to be need to be afraid we not need to have be held captive by those chains Psalms I mean Deuteronomy 29 five and six and this one I just wanted to show how Jehovah is telling Israel it's 29 five and six maybe if I didn't give you that one I'll read it here and I have led you 40 years in the wilderness he said your clothes are not waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot I'd like to find those clothes makers and those shoe makers wouldn't you buy one pair of shoes and never have to buy another pair again but no this was Jehovah God this was the guy one who kept his promise who was with them he says you have not eaten bread neither heavy drank wine or strong drink that ye might know that I am the Lord your God he tells them I'm the one that's done this for you and geez Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now deuteronomy 31:6 again a promise of the lord here he says be strong and of good courage fear not how many times in the scriptures does Jesus use it fear not there are two spirits in this world there's a spirit of love which is God and there's a spirit of fear what you say if it's something that is driving you by fear holding you by fear intimidating you by fear that is not the Spirit of God God does not condemn God come VIX he goes into your heart and says son daughter child that's not good for you Satan thing goes and it says see you're not a son of God you're not a child of God or else you would have done those things or else you wouldn't had those thoughts or you in the back - like that God says hey you are my child I don't appreciate Jack let's work on that there's a lot of difference on how you do that even how you when you're dealing with your own children how you talk to them what attitude you deal with them as parents sometimes we get angry we get mad and we blow up but when we can talk to them in a way that's encouraging that is a strengthening and and tell him look I'm not mad at you I want you to learn from this I let's make this an experience to grow with that's how God works Satan says all your useless God doesn't even love you anymore and he dominates by a spirit of fear so he says be of good courage be strong in a good kid and fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he that it that do Duff go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee he can say one one at one paragraph and cover more that I could promise in a million years and keep it and never fail it you know it's you know brother Branham says we defeat Satan with the word and what we're telling you or we recording - is the word of God it does not change it's not any weaker today it's not been diluted in no way is it any less than the day he spoke it's no less when he says do not fear as when he said let there be light it's a promise of God do not fear therefore he puts love in your heart so you don't have to fear now watch this here in 63 God hiding himself in simplicity and I'm glad he does that because I'm a pretty simple person and it takes some simplicity so I can understand it he's not so educated was such high words with but he can if he needs to be but he can come down to your level he says so he went I mean let me read this so he went so he sent the be of death to sting him and as the bee began to hum around him you know beasts insects have stingers and death has a stinger but you know if an insect ever stings deep it pulls its stinger out so if it ever anchored in a man ignored him and if he had just been an ordinary man a prophet he had stung many a prophet and he died but when he stung that one he lost his stinger he did not have no more stinger of that god he anchored his flesh and in a manual and it pulled the stinger out of death Satan has no death no power of death no authority for death that's in God's hands because a stinger was left in cotton and you know and I thought about it and I said why is why is he the physician of physicians why is he the master of every situation because he went through everything in one of the situations he went through every sickness he went through death he went through hell he went through grave he went through all of it for you and from here you say I have a cold he had a cold you said I have a headache he had a headache he had injured he had insult he had wounds he had every bit of it in fact he died with every sin of mine on him he felt it he cried out father father why has thou forsaken me he understands loneliness he understands separation because he went for it for you and for me so here he says he took that stinger of death out of saying he buried it in himself therefore death has no power over you and I there's a resurrection promise there's even a promises for those who will not taste death Joshua 1:9 again he tells us have not I commanded thee be strong and of good ear of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with you whither so ever thou goest because he's been there before he walked that path he went down to that place he walked all the way down to the well on the side there so he could meet with that woman by the way he went over to Simeon's house that great Pharisee or a high priest who he was knowing how he was going to be treated no he was gone but he went anyways because there was a prostitute woman that was going to me but he went anyways he put himself in a place to be ridiculed to be criticized to be gazed at to be made fun of to redeem one of his to reach out to one of his he says here again he says for the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou goest he's walked this place he's been there before did not the Bible say at 12 years old that he confounded the wise the scholars the teachers he went to school now his school might have been a little different than our school but he learned the Bible says he learned through experiences he was subject to temptation as we are and he learned any overcame in Isaiah 41:10 he tells us fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God they put your name right there I'm Peter Scott for the our knees God I'm sister Holly's gone Holly right didn't get it wrong I'm sister Lily Anne is gone but your name in there brother Matthews God brother Jeremy is gone but the Jordan is gone but your name right there I am by God I will strengthen thee yay I will help the yay I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness there's nothing to fear you know and when you have experienced that you know it to be the truth brother was a brother Tim that ministered last Sunday when he was talking if he doesn't go back to those places in your life where you know you where you know that was God there was not a shadow of a doubt that was gone and sometimes you just go and you walk back there and you say like he told Jacob go back to that place cuz that was gone I think back some of my experiences over time and I say that was God that was God being being delivered from a burden one time as a young man when we first came from California we were in a prayer meeting and my heart was so heavy but I didn't know what it was it was just a burden upon me and we were in prayer meeting and suddenly one of the brothers stood up and said we need to pray for this brother and we're all with our eyes closed and praying and seeking God and didn't know who he was talking to he's got such a heavy burden on him right now and next thing I know of some hands are laid up on my shoulder and he begins to pray for me I didn't even know what the burden was I just knew I had a heavy burden and he began to pray for me and suddenly and this is how I can describe it it was if somebody had been sitting on my shoulders and suddenly it was released and gone it was completely gone and I began to cry and worship the Lord and I remind myself when I feel tired and when I feel a burden I say God you're still the mighty God you're still that God that delivers and you're still the the God that come and can minister to us in a sweet quiet way you're also the God that can reach over and catch our attention in a good swift shakin sometimes hey I need your attention now pay attention now each one of us and we're reminded he says be Jesus I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness he comes any ministers to us that way and I like that when he brother Scott was was talking about Tim's sorry was ministering that way just saying remind yourself sometimes go back to where you last met him if you have a Menem for awhile say hey Lord I'd like to have this experience again I'd like to have you come I like to have some fellowship with you lamentations 357 he said thou drew us near thou came here you came here in the day that I called upon thee and you said fear not how did he address Mary fear not don't be afraid fear not it's caught this is caught he says you drew near on the day that I called upon thee and I you told me you don't have to fear you don't have to be afraid there can be a peace about this now let's go to Matthew a few more scriptures here let's go to Matthew chapter 6 and we'll go from 26 to 34 and this was another thing that it was in my heart now saying Lord were anxious about these days were anxious were already seeing the effects of this coronavirus and already the loss of jobs and yesterday I had a couple of homeowner appointments to take care of after in the lived in homes and I report them then to the service contractor for that company and her name is Nicole and she used to be my csr of the cabinet company and then when she moved to town she went to work for these folks and so I know her quite well and we work together so I call her and let her know these jobs are done so she said thank you very much he said was starting tomorrow we are canceling all homeowner appointments we do not want anybody going into anybody's homes and take something in with them or go into somebody's home and get sick from something they have so all homeowners appointments are cancelled as of right now and some some days that's two thirds of our work on some days it's minimal now I'm a salaried employee from the company I'm there's two of us the other one that works with us is a peace worker or a subcontractor and we give him work so I called him yesterday and I said ever all the jobs are in my my half a town today we split town in half so I said to him I said do you want to do any work or do you want the day off and he says I don't get paid if I don't work I said okay then I'll split it with you guys you know I'm the one that delegates the work so we split it and in then it but it realized now because he told me if I don't work I don't get paid and you could hear it his voice I've got to work he's older than me he's I think he's 63 64 and he's telling me his body's giving out on him because he's been doing this for so long and I could hear the fear in his voice but God says behold the fowls of the air for they sow not they don't get up at 6:00 in the morning because got to be at work at 7:00 and they gotta work til or else they're not gonna get paid they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them and he says are you not much better than they that's his words to us and then let's continue that which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature we can't make ourselves a bigger better by your own thinking we might think we can but we don't and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field and how they grow they don't toil they don't struggle neither do they spin yet I say to him that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these and all that Solomon did in all it did and it was this kingdom was glorious he goes but these simple lilies have more glory in them he says let's continue on wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you O ye of little faith Jesus I say Lord help down my unbelief there sometimes I'm questioning there sometimes I'm wondering but your word says you'll not forsake us you'll meet us therefore take no thought let me say it this way therefore don't get anxious and worried saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink I just went to Walmart I just went to Costco and there was nothing on the shelves Lord I'll let him take it back I said well you know there was 12,000 once out there and I was ministering to them and they were hungry and there was just a couple of fishes and a couple of loaves of bread and I looked at it and I said more than Edith and he began to give and to give and to give and to give and there wasn't any less of it because when they finished they gathered up baskets of it left more than if he says wherefore if God so clothes the grass of the field I'm sorry take therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or withal shall we be clothed he told them he says you went through those forty years your shoes never wore out and your clothes never wear I'm the same yesterday today and forever so here he's telling him the same thing again he said for after all these things do the Gentiles seek and I said you know I'm a Gentile I'm not a Jew in the natural but I said for after all these things do don't seek who get in line at two o'clock in the morning at a Costco and spend their whole day in line to hopefully get in something and they're anxious and they're fighting and all but my family father knows that what you have need he knows all those things and he can take one and make it ten and I'll prove it to you he said give me a tenth and see if I don't bless him and then he says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you I was at the store the other day I had stopped on the way home to get pick something up at the Family Dollar I think that they opened right by the house and then I heard somebody say what are you doing a narrator I was my daughter Elizabeth and I said well I came in to get something and she goes why should have told me I was just at Walmart I could have got it for you I said well you know you were it woman so she goes around the corner and this family dollar they still hand rolls a toilet paper so she says I'm gonna grab a couple of packs because I see them here and I'll take them so we have them and there was another gentleman there and he looks up and he goes I guess that's a smart idea it's not what I came for but I guess that's a smart idea and I'm thinking I said so what's this crazy thing did everybody assume we came in there was some for us and even he got some nothing to worry about I think the fear God said he would profile God said he would me it reminded me of this brother branham was with that group of men and they were travelling and the vehicle ran out of gas and brother Branham says what do you have he said we just got this jug of water and he said give it to me it goes back to when they asked Jesus at the the marriage here in Cana and said go ask him there's no wine is it bringing fill him up with water brother Brown just takes that same promise and he pours it right into the gas tank because now let's get in let's go now did it turn into gas or did God make that vehicle run on water does it make a difference the vehicle went he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought of these things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof don't stay up all night worrying about tomorrow rather Lord I lay my down myself down to rest I commit myself to you I'm going to trust in you for that that's God's Word and he remember you can take god cause where that satan and defeat him every time Saint John chapter 14 go to verse 1 and then we'll go to verse 27 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me let not your heart be troubled don't let it get so anxious don't let it get so nervous don't let it begin to beat so hard and you feel it's going to blow out of your body he said believe in God believe also in me he says and then we'll go down to 27 because he says peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as a world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid that's what he's saying fear has no place in God not this type of fear fear in the sense of respect and reverence yes but fear being afraid like Adam and Eve when they were afraid and they ran from the presence of God but the the angel comes up to Mary and says fear not don't be afraid of what I have the news I have for you is something this world has desired that the earth is groaning all creation has been waiting on this since the fall for unto you this day a savior is born so he says let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid let's go to Philippians and let's take this attitude Philippians chapter 4 verses six way be careful for nothing be being nervous about nothing be troubled about nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving brother branham has taught us that when you you go and you ask God for some and you believe it then you begin to thank him for answering for meeting he also says praise and thankfulness waters that promise and brings it to grow thank you Lord for my heading thank you look for me to my knees thank you for making with us one dollar match that all the way to ten because I needed to hit God is able to do all those things he said but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus sometimes you don't know why but he never I said figure out why he just said take him at his word and rest in that and then he finishes with verse eight finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of are of good report if there be any virtue any strength in it and if there be any praise think on these things he tells us what how to take our attitude in this time and change it and make it where you can lay down at night go to sleep and you can get up in the morning with a smile in your face and you can go to work and know that God is with you he said think among these things what is true what is honest what is just what is pure it's God's Word God said he'd be with me he would never fail me he'd meet all my needs and sickness he has already held me in trouble he's already delivered me I can talk to him I can have a consultation with him I can have a with a physician of physicians and if I've got a question he knows all the answers I've said this many a times if you're in school and you're having trouble with a specific topic maybe it's in English maybe it's math maybe it's a science he's a God to put it all together he knows every language it exists he knows how it all works talk to him about it brother Greene I remember his testimony when he was in South America and he had just finished ministering and he this it was quite a collage convention and his sister comes up and and he knew that they had come and they would come up and give him nice gifts and they wanted to show their appreciation so he went down to where she came up to the alternative they listen to and she begins to talk to him in Spanish and he begins to answer her in English and the brother said I thought you didn't know Spanish she said well she was talking to me in English she goes she doesn't know English he goes well I don't know in Spanish but he does so brother green heard it in English and she heard in Spanish he's still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed you know he's the God so these things these things are true these things are lovely these things are of a good rapport think on these things and then Peter first Peter chapter 5 verse 7 says will sum it up with this on the scriptures here first Peter 5:7 casting all your cares upon him for he cares for you Lord I I'm not able to bear this I'm not able to hold it up I'm not able my shoulders are stooping my legs are tired is been he said cast your cares on me well let me bear them for you because I do care for you you're one of mine here my children he says on that view so this great doctor of doctors the one who who not only went or could I say it didn't go to school to study about it didn't spend time in the seminary to learn the word didn't but rather he was the Word made flesh he was but he did that by experience in the sense that he bore it upon himself he chose to do it so he could walk in my place and your place and understand when they thought there was a shortage he increased it when there seemed to be no way out he made a way in fact when there was no doorway he just went through the wall he's the same yesterday today and forever testimonies overtime that we have heard and we have we've got to witness or we've got to share that he's still the same yesterday in every situation in every country um we talk about the Peter walking on the water Jesus walk in the water there's a testimony of I believe it was in Africa there was a large group of believers going over to service and they walked they had to walk and they got to a swollen river and they said now we can't go to service this and the brothers said the disciples walked on water Jesus walked on water come on and they walked across the river well I understand because these Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he changes not a friend of my father's he was driving his car up through the hills and they had been ministering that day and they were headed back home and it got very foggy and somehow or another the car slipped and he went off the side of the road and it was hanging half off the side of the road down to fall down the side of the cliff and he was terrified because his wife and the children in the car didn't want to move and he hears a tap on the window and he turns around he opens the window and the man says call him by name he said I'm on don't worry about it we'll take care of it for you next thing you know this is the cars picked up put back on the road and they were gone then he thought they even knew who I was they called me by name he's the same yesterday today and forever he can take a situation and say peace be still and the winds and the waves will be he's still the same yesterday today and forever her sister Lily would come up come up to the piano here do you believe that do you claim it do you say his promises are for me they are for me I'll put my name right there every promise in this book is mine every chapter every verse every line no matter what the situation is a matter what the doctors say no matter what God's Word is more than able it's let's pray together Lord we thank you for this word as we heard your prophets say as we read the quotes Lord where he said God's Word will defeat Satan every time in any place in any situation no matter what happened because your word never fails Lord and we're standing on that we as mortal men sometimes we do get afraid sometimes we do get nervous sometimes we get do get anxious Lord are our vision can be limited at time but if we'll take your word and open your word and let the Holy Spirit inspire it to us we will see that we don't have to be afraid we don't have to fear we don't have to work living away Lord where we're controlled by all these emotions and ain't anxieties and things but rather than peace of God covers us the grace of God goes with us the strength of God is in us Lord because you're an issue said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world I will fail I keep my promises Lord you are faithful you keep your word and we thank you for that guard now may your name be praised in worship those listening and order may be on the stream Lord whatever they have need of right now Lord may they just turn and cast their cares upon you and and cast away the fear and say yeh Lord though I walk through the valley of shadow death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff comfort me and David ended it this way surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell looking for that piece of God [Music] Oh [Music] but I'm hurting when I'm not strong but I'm going through this cover me when all seems hopeless I can't see the end of the tunnel cover me even when my faith is gone and I'm questioning we all go through times like that let the peace that passes all understanding all that I can figure let it pass gonna cover me cover me because you're still Jehovah John [Music] [Applause] [Music] and lowing [Music] let's sing it one more time as a compression of our faith [Music] [Applause] [Music] from every disease from Jehovah [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] 'we want to worship you we want to preach we want to tell you that we love you Lord and we appreciate you the Father we're just going to do our best in order give all our effort to confessing what your word says and standing on that and giving you honor and carry our lives our men are our attitude our be how we are Lord with that in our mind with that inner or the Lord you're with us we don't have to fear we don't have to be afraid or and the peace of God that passes all understanding [Music] and until then my heart will go on scene until then with joy I'll carry on hold on okay brother Matthew wants to post a video message here so they're gonna try to set it so it would also be under whatsapp let's see what this is hello and God bless you I greet you in the name of the Lord it's very hard to believe how rapidly things have changed for all of us in these last just two weeks and then I would be greeting you by way of a video message I think there's no question that we're living in a time that is unparalleled in history it's a time when the whole world is shaking the world's living in an atmosphere of fear anxiety and complete uncertainty I'm so glad tonight that its second Timothy 1:7 says that we haven't been given the spirit of fear but of power love and of a sound mind we've received Shalom it's so wonderful to know that Shalom is a word that means peace means harmony the means wholeness and completeness tranquility we don't fear the devil and I'll say that we're not going to participate in the atmosphere of panic a fear that we're seeing run rampant in the whole world today it's hard to believe that a virus that only has a 1% mortality rate has literally brought the world to its knees stock markets all of the systems of economy are shaking right now with the virus with a 1% mortality rate imagine if next year there's something worse with a higher rate makes me say like the songwriter said then I cry on Rock of Ages high thou me as of now I'm sure you're aware that we've been asked by President Trump to do everything we can to curb the spread of this virus he's requested I'm sure that you're aware that we don't gather in groups of more than 10 people the governor of Arizona and also the mayor of Tucson has declared a state of emergency I want to be clear that and point out that no one is asking us to deny our faith to deny our God so I believe that we owe this a Christian which brother branham said is living for others to help in every way we can to stop the spread of this virus I want to emphasize a couple of things to you that this isn't as some as suggesting a time of persecution it's not religious persecution it's also not a tribulation or plague because perhaps your hasn't happened because I'm here because you're still here this isn't as some has suggested the squeeze what's clear from the word is that the bride receives the squeeze and the pressure in an ecclesiastical way while other men have said it's Israel who receives it in a physical way brother Branham says and questions some answers so clearly that the bride won't go through that persecution but she'll be raptured but the church will what we face and the squeeze that we face is an ecclesiastical squeeze which is banned the anointing of God it's banned the gifts of the Spirit it's divine healing it's banned prayer lines and altar calls and worship in the spirit we don't need to fear corona virus we need to fear that virus as I already stated in the text to the whatsapp group that as we go through this time and until we get past this we'll be meeting with a small group of ministry musicians song leaders audio-video personnel and we'll be live-streaming our services to you through video and their telephone hookup which I'm very thankful that we have we're asking you that you don't come to church during this time but that you assemble yourselves with your family along with those who maybe don't have the internet capabilities I'm asking you to reverently stream the services until further notice I want to encourage you to make it a solemn assembly with reverence with prayer as I believe we're in a very serious time I believe this is just a sign of the time of course the situation that we see is ever-changing it's very fluid so I'll say to look for new announcements to be made often as we update you on how we'll continue and how we can convene in person again and when we can convene in person again and be all together I want to end this by encouraging you to view this no different as the children of Israel did in Goshen as they quarantine themselves in their own homes but a notice they didn't just close the door and hide in fear but they actually had Communion and worship it was a time of eating the word so I say to you seize this opportunity with your families I'm seizing it with mine this is the time more than ever before to listen to the message to read your Bible to reestablish the family altar in your home have worship and singing and create an atmosphere that the Holy Spirit is pleased to dwell in which is applying the token so I say to you apply a fresh coat of blood to the doorpost of your home and in your hearts and resolve to being a time of Passover during this time I'm United with you in my faith against this demon spirit that they've labeled Cova 19 we believe and we're taught we have a token we have rights and the word to stand against it and to curse it from our families and from our homes and if we get sick as with any sickness we believe in divine healing and we stand upon that we believe that we can receive healing that there's an atonement the same atonement that saves us also heals our body I'm not sure at this point right now as I record this if I'll be able to travel this weekend I'm still praying and asking the Lord for direction in that decision so I would ask you to pray for me I cover your prayers at this time it's very possible the domestic travel ban will be put in place I'm not sure it reminds me very much of the Apostle Paul in in first Thessalonians the Apostle Paul says wherefore we came unto you I Paul again I would have came unto you but Satan hindered us so if this happens we'll be ministering to you via a live stream streaming of a video and a phone hookup which I'm very thankful brother Jordan has already set up for us so we'll be streaming that from here and Buford to you and and and know this that I'm standing with you in faith and I encourage you to stand with me and in this time to stand against this demon spirit and to conduct ourselves as Christians I'm committed to you during these troublesome times and Lord willing we're gonna see you very soon look for what's at for further announcements I'll be streaming the services and I'll be in prayer with you god bless you hello and god bless you I greet you in the name of the Lord it's very hard so how should we conduct ourselves what is our attitude I say with my heart I'll go on singing with joy I'll carry on [Music] [Music] to [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] they're strong [Music] well [Music] Oh to [Music] well [Music] [Applause] [Music] well [Music] okay [Music] god bless each one of you those that were here those that were listening in or watching through the video god bless each one of you be comforted in God's Word strengthen one another love one another take a moment every once awhile to just check up on 100 say sure hey we're thinking of you were praying for you is there anything we can't do it sometimes in distance prayers and the prayer is a factor so god bless you until we meet again just make that promise until then as we go but [Music] aha yes [Music]
