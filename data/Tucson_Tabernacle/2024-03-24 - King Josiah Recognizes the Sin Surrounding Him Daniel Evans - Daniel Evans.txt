blessing to have everyone that uh will come and visit us we always appreciate that I was um before we get into our scriptures I was talking with Daniel um my son and we're we're close and we uh we Fellowship a lot and Daniel was giving me a testimony oh it's good to see the numer girls I'm glad so Daniel took took these girls on like a 15 M hike yesterday and sister Lily over there so it's good to see everybody survived and made it um we uh yeah they uh sometimes you bite off a little bit more than you can Che I know I have with my son before um but Daniel and I were talking the other day and Daniel was telling me about a testimony that someone that he works with had given him and she talked about church is she here okay she talked about church and she told Daniel she said she says one of the reasons that so many young people are leaving today so many young people don't go to church anymore that that they don't really want much to do with religion they might say they're a a Christian just just to say it but they don't necessarily want to be want to give more and she said it's because that Christianity that the Bible has become like a book of stories to them it's become just Daniel and the Lion's Den and no and the Ark and David and Goliath and it's has morphed into almost a bunch of fairy tales and and they have left out the teaching that is is held inside the Bible and it's now it's just like any other story and they not coming to church they don't understand that there are very very powerful lessons that are in the book lessons life lessons that are to be learned and to be taught and in and Daniel telling me that that was on my mind all week and and then with Brother on Wednesday night I was really blessed by Brother Lyle in our Wednesday night bible study when he spoke on 2 Chronicles and just the stories that are in there and how these this Bible should be applied and and he told the story about this King Josiah which I'm going to get to here in a little bit and all week thinking on on that testimony that Daniel said and how the enemy likes to get in and he likes to take away our fellowship he likes to take away our reading of the word I was I gave the testimony Wednesday night that when I'd go to the tire shop or anywhere else that I knew I was going to have some time I'd bring this book with me and anytime I had some time to wait I would open open it up and I I'd read it if I was on an airplane I was traveling or if I was really anywhere I could open this Bible and start reading but now this Bible has been replaced by this right here on and now we we have entertainment with us all the time we have something to do all the time because we can just look at our phone and now we can read our Bibles and we can listen to sermons and and do these things but we don't do it enough enough when you have your phone how much what percentage of your time is spent studying your Bible on your phone versus other things the devil's very very Sly in what he does and really I see that his ultimate goal is to take the word away from the people because it it's a constant correction and if they don't know the word if they haven't been in the word then it it divides up a family in in first John it the the Apostle says he says children it is the last hour it is the end time and he says as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming so now many antichrists have come already and therefore we know that it's the last hour John says he says these antichrists are already here what's he talking about brothers and sisters they're very very common I'd be willing to bet that almost everyone in this congregation has witnessed that very thing but it doesn't a lot of times we don't recognize it because it doesn't come these antichrists don't come in the way that we think that they should come we think that it should be the pope and walking down the aisle and and doing doing these great things but what it is is it's planting a seed of discrepancy in us and it's always something that separates us from the Lord Jesus it's something that the enemy puts in there and it could be a pastor it could be a prophet it could be a priest it could be anything and you say that you have to come through this to get to Christ and then it becomes Antichrist because there is only one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus wait I was last night I was studying and that TV show I Love Lucy kept coming to my mind and you know we look at that show and how many times have we heard brother brandom talk about I Love Lucy and it's like oh you know he just made this thing just to be this terrible show and we look at it now and we say oh you know it's just it shows you how bad the days are today because look at how innocent that show was back then and how much brother Bram talked about it but it was not innocent it was the farthest thing from innocent first of all it made a man the head of the household it made him look like a buffoon always making fun of him and joking about him and and and their neighbor that that he was this this stupid person and the wife was the boss and and it started making fun of the family unit and not only that but this show I think it was probably the first time was on every single day and it was on the same time at prime time every day and what it did is it started to repace that family time that all the families had and they would come together maybe they would eat supper or they would read their Bibles this show comes in and it replaces that and not only does it replace that but on Wednesday night the people wanted to see the show back then there wasn't there weren't any DVRs or there was no internet there was any of that if you missed I Love Lucy man you were stuck you didn't get to see it anymore and then they were the I think this was one of the First shows that had reruns so when the season was over then they went back and just played it over again and now they it looks so common to us but what it was it was to break the ice for the future and remember Satan's been around for a long time and one of Satan's biggest strengths one of the things that he is the best at is he is very patient and he knows if he can just slip in a little bit here here and there then it'll start taking hold and eventually and he's got all the time in the world eventually it will come to the place that he wants it which the Bible says that he is the God of this evil world of this world so when I Love Lucy he started with with getting the people to start focusing on this show rather than focusing on each other rather than focusing on going to church and and coming together and but if you look at it at least the families were together they got together and they watched this television show and now it's not that way now Satan started with that and he and he's continued on and now they all we all go to our rooms or sit on the couch and we have this right here and we all have our own little things going on and now we don't even fellowship with each other with our families he has taken that away like I said at least with the television we all got to be in the same room we all got to kind of laugh together and joke together but now he got his way and it separated the people and he did it with church even recently just in everyone here was alive just a couple years ago with Co he sends this disease into the world that's that starts killing people and once's the first thing we do we stop going to church and then we get lazy wow and when it's no longer a thing anymore the churches are much smaller now and it's because the people kind of like staying home they like doing their own thing when we see these things the Bible teaches us Hebrews chap 10: 23 we when we see these things start to happen these signs of the times that come before us the Apostle says this let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider what consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching so he's saying in the last days he's warning us that in the last days you're going to see this separation among the people I mean it's separation in our homes it's separation in the same room it he's taking away that fellowship and he's saying don't neglect that don't stop coming together don't stop doing our our young young people's things brother Jordan and sister Martha put on something for the Youth yesterday that was just tremendous we had this big thing of Goliath and we got to tell the kids a story about about David and Goliath and they got to act it out and I guarantee you they'll never forget now the details of that story and the main thing though was it brought them all together and we should take every opportunity to do it not just here at church is very important you know now it's like okay I don't have to go to church I can just stay home and stream that's good to stream it's good to listen to sermons on YouTube but that is not going to church that's not assembling yourselves together that's just staying home and not reading your Bible and listening to YouTube and it may be something very good but that doesn't count that's why communion is so important we need to come together and there's many like in this church there's some elderly people that can't come to church so we go we should go to them serve them communion so we can get that little bit of Fellowship so we can assemble ourselves together very important especially as the Apostle says as you see the day approaching there are going to be signs that we see that are going to show us the end is very [Music] near and when we see those signs as we see today when we see those signs don't neglect the assembling of ourselves together come together as much as we can here in church with a group outside of church whenever we can come together I um thinking about this I Love Lucy and what it started I was I travel sometimes and and when when I'm when I'm in the hotel I always turn on the the Box you know and and I want to see something so so I look at it and I you know flip through all these crazy channels and and I can't find anything but one of the things that I notice is how liberal and how just irreverent and dirty the shows are today and even not only that but some of the the things that I grew up with have been so defiled and corrupted that today they're just it's it's disgusting like this company called Disney and what they have done I mean he used to be Pinocchio you know don't lie I that's I got scared to death just like when I saw that when I was a little kid I was like you know he lied again and the Darkness of it and out on the boat and all that scared me to that but it was a good story Snow White the Lion King what a what a good wholesome thing now it has just been it's been corrupted and what it was is here comes the enemy and remember he's patient and he starts slipping things in I want to read something to you and um this is why I wanted the kids to come in a little bit later says this there's this uh this woman named um Latoya Ravenel and she was an executive producer for Disney's television animation she's way she was way up there a couple years ago she did an interview and she talked about how Disney is moving and she says this she says she says she she talked about her Progressive ideas and that how they how Disney the company defied her negative expectations instead of then the article says this instead of vetoing her pitches for lgbtq friendly Easter eggs now an Easter egg is a a subtle thing that happens in the background of a scene or even over references Disney gladly accepted and included them she claimed in my little pocket of Proud Family Disney TVA the showrunners were super welcoming to my not at all secret gay agenda maybe it was the that way in the past but I guess something must have happened at Disney and then like all of that momentum that I felt that sense that I don't have to be afraid to have these two characters Kiss in the background I was just wherever I could added queerness no one would stop me and no one was go was trying to stop me this is dizzy I grew up watching all the classics they have been a huge informative part of my life but at the same time I worked at small Studios most of my career and I'd heard Whispers And I heard things like they won't let you do this at Disney but then my experience was baffing baffing the opposite of what I had heard she said this is a executive at this company Disney that I used to let my kids watch when when they were when they were babies she knew this the influence that Disney had on her upbringing and she wanted to use that same platform to influence the Next Generation and move in a certain direction and to introduce things that were not traditionally accepted in society and that's the world we live in today slowly these things become normal and they're ingrained in our society and the only brothers and sisters the only weapon that we have against it is our family unity and he's taking that out and our family altar I Love Lucy way back started taking that out our home Bible studies where Dad and Mom we sit around and we talk about this book Church slowly taking that out with Co do you see the direction that it's going especially as we see the day approaching I believe it's recorded many times how Israel how they would stray and they would start worshiping Idols we've been going through from Genesis all the way now down to Second Chronicles and it's this thing that keeps happening they keep they they do okay and then all of a sudden I idolatry idolatry Creeps in do you think that they know that they're worshiping Idols as we were talking about before service do you think these Hebrews these Israelites and all that had happened with Moses and everything do you think that as this this these teachings of of balum and all all these these false prophets do you think that they knew that they were idolators or do you think that they thought that they were still Hebrews message believers they still thought that they were genuine Believers but the enemy Creeps in and he slips this stuff in before us brother ly as I said taught on 2 Chronicles on Wednesday and he finished with this this young King Josiah and the same thing had happened with Josiah as it happened as what I've talked about has happened right now except it's worse now but the same thing happened with Josiah and as I said earlier Daniel's testimony of how of of this woman how this Bible has become just a bunch of stories and not Doctrine to teach our families it's a shame so this Josiah he he became King when he was eight years old obviously an 8-year-old can't rule a country but he was in line for the kingdom and he was crowned King at that that time and he grew into this position as king and he did a good job and one of the things that Josiah noticed is he noticed that the temple was in bad shape he noticed that there was a lot of things that that he needed to fix the door jams were probably falling down and and it was just it wasn't the way it should be so Josiah tasks these contractors he says let's get this thing fixed so they they get together and this guy runs the jobs and they start working on it and they needed to be able to pay the bills they had to pay the contractors so Josiah tells them go look in the in these different rooms so they go and they're looking for for the church treasury they're looking for money to to fund to pay these contractors to do the work and they found something that had been lost for many years this is one of the saddest things that I've read in the Bible and I really believe that we have come to this same point that Josiah came to 2 Chronicles chapter 34 verse 15 and hilaya answered and said to schaen the Scribe I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord and hilaya delivered the book to shapen I have found a Bible in the church that's odd but that's what happened this was the pentat this was the first five books of the Bible this was the Bible in their age and tell me this how could a church get so far away that they don't read the Bible anymore wow that they're going to read other things for the church they're going to concentrate on things that are not in this book They're going to concentrate on things that maybe make the people feel good or maybe lift the people up we're going to read about the sin that was there a little bit later but it started really because a generation had passed or a certain amount of years had passed and they were still worshiping this was still church but they stopped concentrating on the Bible and they started concentrating more on the doctrines of their day so then as time went on the Bible got set on the Shelf got replaced with YouTube or got rep replaced with quotes or something else and they slowly but Sur surely they pushed Satan pushed the Bible out second Timothy chapter 4 says this I charge thee this is the Apostle Paul speaking to Timothy and giving him this last bit of correction before Paul left I charge thee therefore before God and the and Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing in his kingdom this time is coming he's saying preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears so they're going to find a church that preaches what they want to hear and if they can't influence the pastor in their Doctrine then they'll go and find another church wow and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned to fables how could that happen Paul here is is saying that this is going to happen so how could how how could that how could it be needs to be entertaining it needs to be interesting needs to tell stories rather than bringing correction and good teaching but watch thou in all things endure Affliction do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry Paul is trying to warn Timothy to stay diligent to the word and help other people stay with the word because and and he's warning and he Paul may not have known it but God knew it when Paul wrote that letter that it was going to be eternally preserved in the Bible and and there would be generation after generation reading these warnings and now we today are reading these warnings and I ask you to put yourself now in this young man Josiah's place this King back to f 2 Chronicles 34 and schaen carried the book To The King and brought the king word back again saying all that was committed to thy Ser servants they did they did it they they do it' and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers into the hand of the workmen remember they were doing a renovation then shapen The Scribe told the king saying hilaya the priest has given me a book and shapen read it before the King this is the writing of Moses this is the Bible that he's reading to the king and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes he had never heard the Bible from the pull pit it had been replaced and when Josiah heard it for himself then he saw he looked around and he KN he saw what this book says and he saw all of the sin that was surrounding him he saw homosexuality he saw Idols hanging on the walls he saw that Moses had been replaced with something else and in ignorance of the word had had come I wonder why it's so important to me that we have these Wednesday Bible studies is because we have to know this word or then we'll become just like the Israelites here who were it's like okay well I'm a believer I'm this and that but you don't know what the Bible says because you haven't been reading it nothing can replace all of the the streaming services and all that cannot replace a a quiet time with this book opened and studying it and then if you don't understand something get on your knees and pray about it it's not just someone explaining it to you when you take when you let the pulpit or when you let anything else replace your time in this book you are hurting yourself it's a blessing to be able to read the Bible and Ponder on these things and struggle through him and and try to understand them it's one of the greatest blessings reading the Bible is trying to understand what it's saying and the King verse 20 and the King answered and the King commanded hilaya and ayim the son of schaen and abdden the son of Micah and shapen the Scribe and asah the servant of the Kings saying go inquire of the Lord for me and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the Wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord and to and to do this after the book to do after all that is written in the book The King is saying we have messed up really bad here look at all that's going on when I read the Bible we have left these precepts that the prophets have brought and we have gone into something other than the book and hkaya and they that the king had appointed went to Hula the prophetess the wife of shalam the son of tath the son of hazra Keeper of the Wardrobe now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college and they spake to her to that effect and she answered them thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel tell ye the man that sent you to me thus sayeth the Lord behold I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and it shall not and shall not be quenched so here's the prophecy that went forth to give this back to this King and he he had read this he said thank God that he had it he read it and he says we are we are messing up this is not the way God wanted it there is something about a man or a woman that has enough guts that has enough courage in them to stand up and say you know what I was wrong I didn't understand I took someone else's word for this book and I was deceived remember the false prophets that I was talking about I took someone else's word for this instead of getting it for myself same thing happened to this man Daniel in um when he was in Babylon um when Daniel was in Babylon he was taken out as a young man and from Jerusalem when Nebuchadnezzar came in they pulled all of these young people out and they stuck them in this worldly environment called Babylon the Bible talks much about this Spirit about about this city of Babylon and a lot of times it seems like to me it seems like it's Hollywood it really does it's all about the pump and it's all about about um how well everybody is known right and I was um I was on YouTube I'm preaching against YouTube but I was confess I was on YouTube yesterday and I saw this video of this lady and she was dying of cancer and she had the oxygen with her the oxygen was in her nose and her last request was that she could go to a Taylor Swift concert and then it showed her in this Taylor Swift concert and there she is with her friend and she's crying and she's saying oh my God oh my God oh my God what in the world has it come to that so then you know there's this algorithm that of course it another one pops up and there's this guy and he's like 40 and he's walking down the street and there's this woman that looks just like Taylor Swift I think she was made up to look like her she's walking this way and this man looks at her and he says oh my God Taylor Swift and she's like well no I'm actually not he's like oh and he starts crying he says I can't believe I get to meet you and she's like well it's not actually he's like oh I'm just so happy I can't she's like well it's it's not actually and he's like and he's just crying and and he and she gives him a hug she's like well you know it's okay and then it's funny but here's this grown man weeping because he sees this famous person weeping like brother Josiah weeping like if we're worshiping wow and how you know some of these songs you get touched and you just can't help but the tears coming out and you just love the Lord so much and and then you see over here the devil has got it to the place when they're doing the same thing at a Taylor Swift concert am I being hard on Taylor Swift it was it's ridiculous so you know we have this this Super Bowl you know so the next morning on Monday morning I'm like oh wonder who won the Super Bowl you know so I get on there f it was I don't know Fox News or whatever it was and the ridiculous article about the Super Bowl was about Taylor Swift and her boyfriend that's playing on in professional football I had to read down three or four paragraphs before I could figure out who won the game it was about this woman this singer this pop star so started looking in to her music Remember music is worship yes it was designed for worship these feelings that you feel when you're worshiping God the devil he changes it and he gives the people the same feeling when they're in these concerts when they're walking down the road listen to this listen to what many of our young people and old people alike are listening to listen to these lyrics this is one of her songs they all warned us about times like this they say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by Blind Faith why do you have to put that in there but we might just get away with it religions in your lips even if it's a false god we'd still worship we might just get away with it the altar is my hips even if it's a false God we still worship this love and we are listening to this person our young people are listening to this the world is listening to this wow and we're worshiping wow and it's coming into our lives it's coming in into our our families to where people are Weeping when they see her Prophet with Daniel was living in this kind of environment he had been he and thousands of others as I said were taking out were taken out of Jerusalem and they he was there for like 67 years in Babylon in this in this awful place he was an old man and he opened his Bible and he's reading his Bible he's reading out of the book of Jeremiah and he sees wait a minute it I see where I am I see what's going on around me Daniel 9 chapter one in the first year of dasas the son of aerus of the seed of the mes which was made King over the realm of the calans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by the books by books the number of years he was reading his Bible yeah and he had a revelation whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem So Daniel here he's reading out of the 29th chapter of Jeremiah and he's like wait a minute Jeremiah said we were only going to be in Babylon 70 years and he had been there like 6768 years wow so when he read that let me read Jeremiah 29:10 really quick for thus Jeremiah says this for thus sayeth the Lord after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place meaning Jerusalem So Daniel reads that and he says the prophet told us that we would only be there 70 years then Daniel says this and I set my face unto to the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confessions and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned wow and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts from thy and thy judgments neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our King our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land and then if you skip down to verse 21 he says this yay while I was speaking in prayer so there he is he's saying this word says all of this is about to end and he's praying like Lord show us more what are we supposed to do and while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel the Angel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give the skill and understanding he read his Bible prayed about it and then the Lord showed him where he was another place place in Daniel it says that knowledge will increase in the last days for 6,000 years this hasn't happened until now now anything that I want right I can Google it wow anything that I want to know and even more you know what happened to me this morning I left my house brother John got like to into my driveway message pops up on my phone 26 minutes to the Tucson Tabernacle it's like how'd you know I was going to the Tucson Tabernacle it's this artificial intelligence and it's keeping tabs on on all of us and it's you know with this thing it's like it pops up it's like 28 28 minutes to work every morning when when I leave you talk talk about knowledge will increase I mean it's going faster and faster and faster and artificial intelligence how much data is being collected on me every day and guess who has access to every little bite Satan does yes true just like he always has and he will take this and use it against us Luke chapter 23 Jesus was on his way to the Cross verse 27 brother I don't know if I gave you this this scripture but I want to read it Luke uh 23:27 Jesus was carrying his cross and he was going up to golgatha and there and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him but Jesus turning unto them said Daughters of Jerusalem we not weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in the which they shall in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bear and the paps which never gave suck you're blessed not to have a child how many unborn children are killed in the United States today in one day when Moses was born the Egyptians were killing thousands of babies and then God brought judgment on Egypt when Jesus was born they were again killing babies and God brought the first coming of Christ and today you hear oh you're too young to have a baby you won't get to follow your dreams you won't to get you won't get to get your career blessed are the wombs that never bear and today today there are far more unborn babies dying than there were in Egypt or in Israel you cannot deny that that is a sign of the coming judgment that's the so I ask if we're in Josiah's place and we see these things Josiah what are you going to do about this what am I going to do about it there's signs that are all around me so what am I going to do let's go back to this prophecy of hula the propheus 2 Chronicles 34:26 and as for the king Judah as for the king of Judah who you sent who sent you to inquire of the Lord so shall ye say unto him thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel concerning The Words which thou Hast heard because thine heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before God we don't know how much Josiah sinned he probably did a lot but because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself when you heard his words against this place when you read the Bible and against the inhabitants thereof and humbled thyself before me and did rent thy clothes and weep before me I have even heard thee also sayeth the Lord look at the the repentance look at how God values a sincere repent repent of heart behold I will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all of the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same so they brought the king word again then the king sent and gathered together all the Elders of Judah and Jerusalem and the King went up to the house of the Lord and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites and all the people great and small and he read in their ears the book wow all the words of the book of the Covenant that was found in the house of the Lord and the King stood in his place and made a covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord and to keep his Commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the Covenant which are written in this book book Josiah used his influence he used his position it might be the position of of a mom or a dad it might be the position of a of a friend or a deacon or a trustee or a pastor whatever God has given us to influence others use it like Josiah did and Josiah took away all the Abominations out of all the out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel and made all that were present to in Israel to serve even to serve the Lord their God and all his days they departed not from following the Lord they departed not from following the Lord the god of their fathers amen so Josiah he read in this Bible he had his own understanding he read in this Bible he prayed about it he asked others to help him and he got the interpretation of the word and then he implemented it a perfect example for all of us because we are surrounded by the enemy and he used something like I Love Lucy wow this little harmless show to start the ball roll in and then now we see as I said we see Disney and the evilness the people don't want to see that but there is a higher power a lower power pressing them to put the shove this stuff down our throats so then we just take it like oh it's just normal it is not normal right these things are sin and if we just allow it then it just it'll become part of our Lives we need to get back we need to return we hear so much about Malachi chapter 4 do you ever read the book of Malachi you should it's only four chapters what was going on in the Book of Malachi they were just they were living lukewarm they weren't paying their ties they were they were using these sacrifices that weren't the best of the flock like they should they were just didn't really care about God a perfect example of a lukewarm age that is today and that is the Book of Malachi Malachi chapter 4 says this for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Bur Branch there is coming a judgment is what Malachi is saying but unto you that fear my name shall the shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayeth the Lord of hosts musicians can come remember watch what the Lord speaking through his Prophet Malachi says he says remember you remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in horb for all Israel with statutes and judgments he's saying remember the same God remember the same Bible that Josiah found and it changed his life now you remember it and you fear my name and fear my word respect my word behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children fulfilled and John the Baptist and the Heart of the children to their fathers the heart of these people back to the word because it's strayed so far that Spirit brings us back to this Bible lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse think about it do we really believe put yourself in Josiah's Place do I really believe that all of these things that I was talking about just now do I really believe that they're the sign of the end do I really believe that this Malachi has been fulfilled do I really I you know I really think that very few people do because if we did we would know that this time is at hand and we would be like Josiah we fall down our knees say Lord forgive us or like Daniel did he fell Lord forgive us we're sinful People Help Us Lord but instead here's the enemy and he just made it apathetic it's just we don't care it's not that important but if we really believed it it would be important brothers and sisters I'll read one more scripture Peter second Peter chapter 3:8 he says this but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise what he said is going to pass the whole the day cometh that shall burn us in heaven it's going to happen as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us wordss not will willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the ele and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up sounds like Malachi 4 doesn't it just what I just read seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of the Lord wherein the heavens being on F fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat behold the day cometh th shall burn as an oven as I just said and all the proud and all that do wicked shall be burned up nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless it's a warning it's a warning that Josiah had he read he read his Bible and he said look at at all of these things that are happening in the world today Luke 17 as it was in the day of no days of Noah there was violence all over the world look what just happened in Russia these men came in and shot all of these in innocent people killing over a hundred of them why violence what did those people do to these people just to kill people Jesus said that as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be when he comes again as it was in the days of lot what was going on in lot it was Sodom Disney was rising up and teaching these things to the people and then it got common to them and they thought it was just normal to have all this sin surrounding them as I said it is not normal don't let it be normal normal I understand people make mistakes I understand people have weaknesses that other people don't don't have I understand that but don't say it's okay whatever sin it is don't just say it's all right because everybody else is doing it it doesn't work but if you got anything from my sermon this morning don't neglect this book don't let someone else just feed you what they think it means you sit down as Josiah he listened to this Bible and then he was able to look around and see all the sin that was around him and then he used his influence and said this this is going to change Daniel did the same thing he read the Bible and he says we're about to get out of here we're about to go home Jeremiah prophesied it's going to be 70 years and we're almost there get ready use your influence as these brothers did to get your families ready to get your neighbors ready to get your fellow church members ready to get your friends ready everyone that you can use that influence as these brothers did and let's get out of here and don't fall into this stuff that this woman Taylor Swift you know what I'd love to see I'd love to see that girl give her heart to the Lord Jesus and give a testimony imagine how much that would mean to the World Imagine how much weight that would have I've heard brother Brandon pray he said he prayed for Judi for um Elvis [Music] Presley and I pray for the same thing for her it would be wonderful if she could give a testimony and the influence that she has if she could give a testimony of how Jesus Christ saved her life and changed her life I would love to see that jiah I give myself [Music] away I give myself so you can use me I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me here's my am here I stand

last days it never happened until now all of this celebrity and and all of these things good that that are going on the enemy just wants to get in establish himself and then he is patient and he can turn the whole ship and he's very very good at it don't please don't listen to that music it's not going to do you any good spend the time that you would spend listening to that music and listen to some worshipful music amen listen to something that's that's going to get you closer to the Lord and not have you worship the God of this evil World same thing with what you watch saying that the eyes are the gateway to the soul be careful what you see keep your eyes eyes on God keep your eyes on the things of God because it is going to happen as Peter said that he said one day was with God is a thousand years and a thousand years of one day but it's still going to happen and it looks like it's going to happen in our days it really does it's never been like this I know everybody's said that for for Millennia but it happened in our day I feel like Josiah opening my Bible and saying look at all of this going on it's all written right here and I don't want to use my [Music] influence say
