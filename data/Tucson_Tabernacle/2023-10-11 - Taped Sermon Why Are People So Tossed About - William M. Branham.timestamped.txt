[28:47] done in that place that all eyes are
[28:50] upon right now in Jesus Christ's name
[28:54] amen I have you remain standing for for
[28:58] just a moment
[29:00] um I
[29:03] was thinking about as I see what's going
[29:06] on in Israel I was thinking about time I
[29:09] was there a few years ago and I
[29:12] was sitting there and I was looking at
[29:15] the foundation of the Temple Mount and I
[29:17] was looking at all the giant stones that
[29:20] were pulled down the Big Blocks that
[29:22] were pulled down they were laying down
[29:24] in front of the the um Foundation there
[29:28] for what used to be Solomon's
[29:31] Temple and I was thinking lord I can't
[29:33] believe I'm here and looking up was once
[29:37] a stairwell that went up to get on the
[29:39] Temple
[29:40] Mount I looked at that I said Lord Jesus
[29:44] Christ himself walked up those stairs
[29:46] walked up to this place that I'm at
[29:49] right now and
[29:52] then prophesied that not one stone will
[29:55] be be left upon another and I I looked
[29:57] there and there's all this these piles
[29:59] of stones that happened soon after he
[30:03] prophesied that and as I was sitting
[30:05] there a young man came it was on yam
[30:09] kapor that I was there and a young man
[30:11] came and he sat down next to me and he
[30:13] was studying to be a
[30:16] rabbi and uh he just had a lot of lot on
[30:20] his mind and we started talking
[30:23] and remember I made this statement to
[30:25] him I asked about the Messiah and I
[30:28] asked him some questions and
[30:32] um I asked I told them I said I said
[30:35] brother I
[30:36] said all of these
[30:39] prophecies that are prophesied to take
[30:42] place they will
[30:44] happen I said
[30:46] but you don't have to interpret any of
[30:50] these
[30:51] prophecies the
[30:53] interpretation of a prophecy is the
[30:56] Fulfillment of that
[30:58] prophecy and how many people how many
[31:00] all of us we look at things starting to
[31:03] happen and we start to try to place them
[31:05] into history and we try to interpret the
[31:07] prophecies and all that it is not our
[31:09] place brothers and sisters because you
[31:11] know what we'll be wrong and it's wrong
[31:14] every time how many times have I heard
[31:17] when Russia goes down and gets goes down
[31:19] there to get the
[31:21] oil oh over and over and over every time
[31:25] Russia and oil is mentioned in the same
[31:26] sent
[31:27] there's a prophecy about that you know
[31:29] what it's not up to us to interpret any
[31:31] of this it's us up to us to believe it
[31:34] and to pray and to be in the right place
[31:38] so when these things happen that we are
[31:42] in the right place and on the right
[31:45] side my Bible
[31:48] says pray for the Peace of
[31:52] Jerusalem and that is our
[31:54] role and
[31:57] see some of the things that are
[31:59] happening and and it is prophesied one
[32:03] day that all countries would come
[32:04] against
[32:05] Israel it's going to happen one day the
[32:09] prophet said it and uh I just I pray for
[32:13] the people there that the Lord will give
[32:14] them strength there's a lot going
[32:17] on and uh as I said on Sunday morning
[32:22] it's our alarm clock that we need to
[32:25] wake up and we need to get our lives
[32:28] right with the Lord and we need to
[32:30] witness to as many people as we can to
[32:33] get them in to this body of Jesus Christ
[32:38] because that door it looks like is
[32:42] closing and it's our role not to
[32:45] interpret everything that's going on but
[32:47] it's our role to see it as a sign and as
[32:50] a warning which is what prophecy is for
[32:53] a warning and to get ourselves right and
[32:56] to get get others right so we can all
[32:59] cross the finish
[33:00] line This sermon that we're going to
[33:02] hear
[33:04] tonight
[33:05] is I think brother Brandon preached a
[33:08] sermon one time said why am I so
[33:11] misunderstood this is one of those
[33:12] sermons I really thought it would be
[33:15] good for all of us to
[33:17] hear Brother brandom
[33:20] mentions and he says in the sermon that
[33:23] this is the first time he's told it
[33:24] publicly he mentions a vision that he
[33:28] had and it's a tremendous vision and
[33:32] it's a tremendous prophecy but I've seen
[33:36] as many of you
[33:38] have over and over
[33:41] again this prophecy and this Vision
[33:45] interpreted this way interpreted that
[33:48] way starting a a sect of the message
[33:52] over here and another sect over here and
[33:54] and another one over here and it's as I
[33:57] said friends it is not up to us to
[34:00] interpret what this Prophet said leave
[34:03] the prophesying to the prophets leave
[34:05] the interpretation to God and let us
[34:08] just believe it I pray that it'll be a
[34:11] blessing to you tonight to hear this and
[34:14] I want you to notice as brother Brandon
[34:17] as he gives this
[34:20] prophecy and gives us this Vision then
[34:24] he begins on his sermon and and watch
[34:28] his excitement grow and grow and grow as
[34:33] he gets deeper and talking about the
[34:36] Lord Jesus and how how he he talks about
[34:39] how Jesus can help us and how Jesus does
[34:41] he does everything that we need and you
[34:44] see the prophet he just his excitement
[34:48] grows and grows and grows and it
[34:51] just it shows us his Focus was on one
[34:55] thing and one thing only and that is
[34:57] Christ Jesus in this
[34:59] day and I I thought it would be good did
[35:03] I lose my song leader I thought it would
[35:05] be
[35:06] good to brother you can stay down you
[35:09] can you can stay I thought it would be
[35:12] good to um for us as a body of
[35:17] Believers to hear this
[35:20] tape and to see where it all came from
[35:24] and it's like five minutes
[35:27] and then listen to The Prophet what he
[35:30] puts the emphasis on so let's let's sing
[35:33] only believe and let's remain standing
[35:36] until brother brandom uh
[35:38] stops praying and says amen then we can
[35:41] be
[35:48] seated
[35:50] oh
[35:54] be all the things are
[36:00] possible
[36:02] only
[36:06] believe
[36:08] only
[36:12] be
[36:14] oh
[36:18] be all things are
[36:23] [Music]
[36:24] possible
[36:25] only

[39:46] notice was up in the air I am so wly
[39:51] safe from sin Jesus so sweetly abides
[39:55] Within
[39:57] I'm so happy for that today for you and
[40:01] now I believe if Sister here on the
[40:04] stretcher is just a little bit in the
[40:05] sun if she if she want to be moved over
[40:08] maybe I don't know where it's bothering
[40:10] her or not and I noticed her hand also
[40:12] up so wondrously saved from sin Jesus so
[40:17] sweetly abide within oh isn't that
[40:21] marvelous when Jesus of Nazareth can
[40:24] come into our hearts and bless us and
[40:27] make us what we ought to be used to be a
[40:30] little song we used to sing years ago he
[40:33] makes me what I ought to be his grace
[40:37] can cleanse and set me free something
[40:39] like that how marvelous it
[40:42] is now just before we start into teach
[40:46] the Sunday
[40:47] School uh as my lot this morning to come
[40:50] and teach Sunday school and it made me
[40:53] feel good to come in the back door and
[40:54] see him putting the birthday off
[40:56] offerings up here that remind me a long
[40:58] time ago when Tabernacle was first being
[41:01] in its cradle days and just like old
[41:05] times to hear the pastor blessing the
[41:07] people for the coming years of their
[41:09] life and giving thanks for what God had
[41:12] graciously done for them
[41:15] now uh I think I owe to this
[41:20] Tabernacle the the reasons why and to be
[41:23] the first place that I have make this
[41:26] announcement of
[41:31] anywhere yet it's typed out and ready
[41:34] for mail but I think that I would want
[41:38] to quote it being the New Year not that
[41:41] it's New Years but it's the new turn of
[41:45] time I believe we're living in a
[41:49] very uh wonderful glorious day of
[41:54] opportunity when people peoples at this
[41:57] day living to see the Shadows of the
[41:59] coming of the Son of
[42:02] God I I believe with all my heart that
[42:06] the world is going to burst now into the
[42:09] greatest Revival that was ever known or
[42:11] is going into the darkest chaos that's
[42:13] ever been known in
[42:16] history and uh I it's a it's a great
[42:20] time of people to make a decision on
[42:23] what they're going to do and if there
[42:25] happens to be someone here today who
[42:27] hasn't made the decision right for
[42:30] Christ I trust that it'll be this
[42:31] morning somewhere in the service that
[42:34] you in your heart say yes Lord this is
[42:37] the day when I take my make my decision
[42:40] to serve you the rest of my life amen
[42:44] it's a wonderful day I'm sure that over
[42:48] our eyes has been just a veil even
[42:51] believers who we can't see just what's
[42:54] going on around us you see and and many
[42:57] times spiritual Le people are
[42:59] misunderstood and and they don't to the
[43:03] peoples of the world because it's such a
[43:05] strange and an odd life to live a full
[43:10] surrendered life to the Lord
[43:13] Jesus now a few weeks ago I had promised
[43:19] the Lord eight or about 10 years ago
[43:22] when I left in 1946 when I left the
[43:25] Tabernacle
[43:26] that I would serve him with all my heart
[43:29] in these campaigns knowing that it was
[43:31] going to be a great disturbance out
[43:34] there because and a lot of money
[43:37] included and everything like that so I I
[43:42] knew that usually in reading that man
[43:45] who get the Lord bless them just a
[43:47] little bit there's about three major
[43:51] things that usually brings a minister to
[43:54] back to the rut
[43:56] and I noticed from them one of them was
[43:59] money women popularity and those three
[44:03] things I notice in the scriptures that
[44:05] were it money was a prophet balum who
[44:09] sold out his gift to go on account of
[44:13] money when Bic offered so much money
[44:16] many of you acquainted with the story
[44:18] The Samson it was DEA the woman who woed
[44:21] him in her lap until he give away the
[44:23] secrets of the Lord to her and Saul it
[44:27] was popularity he was a prophet the
[44:30] Bible said he was numbered with the
[44:31] prophet and through popularity he wanted
[44:34] to be big and above someone else he fell
[44:37] by this and this is the three major
[44:39] causes that I see in the Bible that
[44:43] cause man to fall and I asked our
[44:45] heavenly father to please sh let me shun
[44:48] at all times those things especially
[44:51] those three major things and kept the
[44:54] covering over them I made a promise
[44:55] promised to God that I would never uh
[44:58] beg for money in the meetings and I made
[45:00] a covenant with him if he ever got to a
[45:03] place where he didn't Supply my needs in
[45:05] the meeting just passing the collection
[45:08] plate which I knew it would take tens of
[45:10] thousands of dollars to do it and great
[45:13] massive meetings and then I I told him
[45:16] that I would leave and come home off of
[45:18] the field this he miraculously did
[45:21] without making one stress at any time
[45:24] for money or press three or four
[45:26] managers lost their jobs because of
[45:28] making a little press for money which I
[45:30] would not permit it I don't believe in
[45:33] it the people around the city here might
[45:36] think well the lord gave us a little
[45:38] home up there that was taken up in one
[45:39] night that uh someone think well he's a
[45:42] multi millionaire I wish you only knew
[45:44] the truth see you no different from that
[45:48] that I could have been that's right but
[45:50] I not even begging but just people come
[45:53] say I'll give you this brother brand but
[45:54] I refuse this
[45:56] I don't want it I want nothing to do
[46:00] with it it's it's filth I I want my
[46:03] inheritance to be above up here and I
[46:06] knowing this the day by day the gray
[46:09] hairs is coming into my head and and I'm
[46:13] not the little boy that I was that
[46:14] started preaching here 23 years ago see
[46:17] and I know one thing that no matter how
[46:19] much you got at this what would have
[46:21] profited a man if he gained the whole
[46:23] world and then lose his soul amen so
[46:26] I've seen that cursed thing the last few
[46:29] days ministers and people calling a
[46:32] different family disasters and things A
[46:36] lady called me the other night she said
[46:37] I won't tell you my name my husband is
[46:39] one a well known healing evangelist on
[46:43] the field and said I caught him right in
[46:46] the act of living in adultery with an
[46:48] 18yearold girl and he he confessed to me
[46:50] that he had been doing it for two years
[46:52] said what shall I do brother brandom and
[46:54] I said lady I don't know I said I pray
[46:57] for my brother his soul and such as that
[47:00] we tried to shun him and he he
[47:03] miraculously met me and helped me until
[47:07] about the last couple meetings and my
[47:10] last meeting in California alone in the
[47:12] last two meetings I went $155,000 in
[47:15] debt that they said you have to beg you
[47:19] have to tell the people they want to be
[47:20] begged I said that's not my promise to
[47:22] God so man said I underwrite it I said
[47:25] that isn't my promise to God so to keep
[47:27] my promise as I would to my fellow man I
[47:30] did to God and I didn't want to tell my
[47:33] wife and boy on the road home come
[47:35] California stop in the Evangelistic
[47:38] Services I said I'll go back I rest up a
[47:41] few days and see what the Lord Jesus
[47:43] says and nothing else I'll come down
[47:44] help brother Neville Pastor the
[47:45] Tabernacle I said I'll I'll do something
[47:48] preach the gospel and go to work like I
[47:51] used to do patrolling on the lines the
[47:53] Public Service Company or something and
[47:55] preach on let him have Sundays uh
[47:58] morning or Sunday night and I'll take
[48:00] the other service and him have Wednesday
[48:01] and I'll have Tuesday or something like
[48:03] that or I said we'll go right ahead with
[48:05] the services and I said I'll get me a
[48:07] job and go to work I did I got me a job
[48:10] brother Woods back there moving hous me
[48:12] so I just went to work got me a job it
[48:15] hurt my wife Billy they said Billy said
[48:18] Dad I'm sure you're doing wrong I said
[48:19] no I'm doing right I keep my promise see
[48:22] I told him I said my promise no matter
[48:24] what it is this a man is not as good as
[48:27] his word I don't want to you can't trust
[48:29] him because he's not no
[48:30] good and so
[48:32] um one thing a person must always be
[48:36] that's honest be tell things so that
[48:39] that you can go back and tell it a
[48:41] million times it'll be the same thing
[48:43] you see just be honest no matter if it's
[48:45] bad or whether it's good be honest and
[48:47] if it's against you say it anyhow or
[48:50] keep still don't say it at all see and
[48:53] so then uh I I feel that that way that
[48:56] God will bless an honest heart and
[48:58] knowing the position that I stand in to
[49:01] defeat sickness and stuff for people in
[49:04] prayer to the Lord Jesus according to
[49:06] his
[49:07] Divine uh word and his uh and his
[49:11] calling that I must be honest in heart
[49:14] to do that because the devil knows
[49:17] whether you are or not he won't pay I
[49:19] don't care how loud you holler how much
[49:21] you make up he won't pay attention to
[49:23] you amen that's right but God
[49:26] will if you're honest so I said I'll
[49:29] tell him when I get to Arizona after
[49:31] left California I didn't have the nerve
[49:33] so I after I said I will in New Mexico
[49:36] and on and on on until I told them come
[49:38] right down here in Indiana well they
[49:40] they understood it pretty well really
[49:42] didn't get it too well he said Daddy I
[49:44] think you're making a mistake but I went
[49:46] home tired weary upset crying went to
[49:50] bed that night and at your wife got to
[49:52] sleep went in the room knelt down said
[49:54] dear Jesus Jesus I don't know what I'm
[49:56] going to do here I am right back where I
[49:58] started from again see I guess I made a
[50:02] failure by two hours the man he appeared
[50:05] to me and he showed me a vision of such
[50:08] a panoramic view of people I never seen
[50:11] I was talking to my wife in The Vision
[50:14] now you people that know me know I'm not
[50:16] a fanatic I don't say these things L
[50:19] they the truth that's right and I I seen
[50:23] it and I seen brother arganbright stand
[50:25] there and I went up to him he said
[50:26] brother Billy said we give out all the
[50:28] prayer cards and everything's ready now
[50:30] for the meeting we got a away take in
[50:32] and out I said thank you brother ARG

[50:35] Brethren and there's another brother
[50:37] preaching I said who's he they said they
[50:40] put him up and I said who's they and
[50:42] they just turned around walked away and
[50:44] the man made just dismissed the audience
[50:47] let them all go and I said oh he
[50:48] shouldn't do that because there is
[50:50] there's no alter call oh he said another
[50:53] fellow spoke up and said we done talk up
[50:54] the offering
[50:56] I said when is the offering more
[50:58] important in Souls before Christ and at
[51:01] that the angel of the Lord taking me out
[51:04] then and he take me to a real bright
[51:07] stream of water the most beautiful blue
[51:10] water and great fish was swimming around
[51:12] them he said I will make you a Fisher
[51:15] and he said Now cast your lure into the
[51:17] water when you do pull it slow first
[51:20] time next time just give it a little
[51:22] jerk not too hard and the next time
[51:25] that's your hook for the catch and I
[51:27] started throw my line in the water I
[51:29] pulled it everybody again to rejoicing
[51:31] and saying that's wonderful that's
[51:32] wonderful I got all excited and jerked
[51:35] it hard on the next one I I pulled a
[51:38] fish and allil out of the water what it
[51:40] was is a little bitty fish and it just
[51:42] about size of the lure and I got my line
[51:45] all tangled up and I straightened out my
[51:47] line and the man which was talking
[51:49] behind me walked around in front of me
[51:51] dressed in Palestinian clothes and a
[51:54] turban on his head he had white robe he
[51:57] said brother Bram that's
[52:00] it I said I know I didn't do right I
[52:03] said I jerked it when I want to he said
[52:06] don't get your line tangled up in these
[52:07] kind of times and I said well I'm
[52:10] running as straight as I can I'll be
[52:12] very careful and he said now the first
[52:15] time I spoke with you you put your hands
[52:19] on the people and told them what was
[52:21] wrong with them and the second pull why
[52:24] when you did you would know the secrets
[52:26] of your hearts and I made you sear
[52:29] before the people but she was always
[52:31] trying to explain it you ought to have
[52:33] done that said you made a public show
[52:36] out of it I said I'm very sorry and he
[52:40] taken me from there and I seen a great
[52:44] huge tent I never seen such a a tent it
[52:48] was packed in line everywhere with
[52:49] people and I walked out to the looked
[52:53] like I was standing above the people
[52:54] looking down where just made an alar
[52:56] call and hundreds and hundreds of people
[52:58] were weeping and rejoicing after they
[53:00] had accepted the Lord Jesus as their
[53:04] Savior and I look and then I heard a man
[53:07] get up and say call the prayer line and
[53:09] people begin to line up over on this
[53:10] side the left from where I was looking
[53:13] down towards the platform and the line
[53:15] all the way up and down the street for a
[53:16] prayer line I noticed to my left which
[53:19] would have been to my right if I was on
[53:21] the platform a little wooden building
[53:24] and I se that light that all they have
[53:27] the picture of you know it's always in
[53:29] the meeting I've seen that light leave
[53:32] me and go to that building and go in
[53:35] that building and a voice said to me

[54:05] these things and many of you know that

[1:00:39] towards Jesus Christ just as certain as
[1:00:41] we're setting in the church today in His
[1:00:44] Marvelous word now the 19th Chapter or
[1:00:48] oh I beg your pardon it's the the 10th
[1:00:50] chapter of Hebrews and the 19th verse
[1:00:54] verse I want you to listen close as we
[1:00:58] read having therefore Brethren boldness
[1:01:02] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[1:01:06] of
[1:01:08] Jesus How Wonderful by a New and Living
[1:01:11] Way which he has consecrated for us
[1:01:15] through the veil that is to say through
[1:01:17] his flesh and having a high priest over
[1:01:20] the house of God let us draw near with a
[1:01:23] True Heart and with full Assurance of
[1:01:27] Faith having our conscience sprinkled
[1:01:30] from Evil and our bodies washed with
[1:01:33] pure water may the Lord Jesus just grant
[1:01:38] this answering to the word you like the
[1:01:42] word faith cometh by hearing hearing the
[1:01:48] word of God now just for the teaching
[1:01:53] service now for perhaps the next 30 to
[1:01:56] 40 minutes let's go right straight into
[1:01:58] the word now our faith cannot rest upon
[1:02:04] nothing a Christian has to have his
[1:02:07] faith has to have a solid resting
[1:02:10] place you know
[1:02:12] that and the only resting place that a
[1:02:15] Christian a true born
[1:02:19] Christian can rest his faith or hers is
[1:02:23] up on the unmovable word of
[1:02:28] God it isn't built upon the shifting
[1:02:31] Sands of man's Theology and and
[1:02:34] doctrines and upon some church
[1:02:38] affiliation but a True Believer his
[1:02:41] faith is rest
[1:02:42] Solly
[1:02:44] un un shifting as he approaches the word
[1:02:49] of
[1:02:50] God I was saying somewhere maybe here a
[1:02:54] few nights ago I wanted to preach so bad
[1:02:57] I preached to my wife in bed till
[1:03:00] 12:00 just telling her of how glorious
[1:03:03] Jesus was a text come in my heart it
[1:03:06] kept burning me so great till I just
[1:03:08] couldn't rest with it now I just said
[1:03:10] honey I want to preach to you a little
[1:03:12] while amen she roused up by Grace she
[1:03:19] listened I said the Christian faith is
[1:03:23] based Solly up on
[1:03:26] rest right a Christian is not tossed
[1:03:30] about a Christian doesn't run from place
[1:03:33] to place a Christian doesn't fuss and
[1:03:36] fume and worry about things a Christian
[1:03:40] rests amen it's all
[1:03:42] over all finished for the believer at
[1:03:47] calary right oh sickness May Cal and
[1:03:51] disappointments but the Christians that
[1:03:53] rest knowing this that God's able to
[1:03:56] keep that which he has
[1:03:58] performed knowing that no matter what
[1:04:01] the thing is and how it looks there's
[1:04:04] neither sickness sorrow death there's
[1:04:07] neither starvation or anything that can
[1:04:11] separate us from the love of God that's
[1:04:13] in Jesus Christ amen we're at rest Just
[1:04:17] Let The Old Ship toss any way she wants
[1:04:20] to the Anchor
[1:04:22] hold I come by a heart Harbor one time
[1:04:25] and seen that was flying in the plane is
[1:04:27] great coming down low there's a big old
[1:04:29] ship there the sails that been let down
[1:04:31] you know and oh what a storm on the sea
[1:04:34] my she was talking and I seen that Old
[1:04:36] Ship sitting there rocking back and
[1:04:38] forth in some ways that would go in and
[1:04:40] some ways it would go under and
[1:04:42] everything I said wonder why that is and
[1:04:44] the F setting said it's got a sea anchor
[1:04:47] on it therefore said the ship can't sink
[1:04:53] said it can go through through the
[1:04:55] wave but it can't
[1:04:57] sink that because it's
[1:04:59] anchored all praise be to
[1:05:04] God we got an
[1:05:06] anchor some ways we can go over some we
[1:05:09] go
[1:05:10] under but regardless if the anchor holds
[1:05:14] it isn't the ship doing the holding it's
[1:05:16] the anchor doing the holding amen it
[1:05:19] isn't what I am or what I will be or
[1:05:22] what I was it's what he is now and what
[1:05:26] he did for me and you amen it ain't what
[1:05:29] I can do it's what he has done my faith
[1:05:32] doesn't anchor in what the coming
[1:05:35] meetings will be my faith doesn't rest
[1:05:38] in only any ability that I would have or
[1:05:41] upon what church I should jarn or what
[1:05:44] people I should associate with my faith
[1:05:47] anchors and rest entirely upon the
[1:05:51] finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:53] all already been received God Justified
[1:05:57] him for raising from the dead this is my
[1:06:00] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and
[1:06:02] God raised him up from the dead for our
[1:06:07] justification no wonder the poet said
[1:06:09] living he loved me dying he saved me
[1:06:13] buried he carried my sins far away
[1:06:16] Rising he justified freely forever
[1:06:19] someday he's coming oh Glorious Day the
[1:06:22] Christian rests in that that hope upon
[1:06:25] the stormy sea there'll sure storms rise
[1:06:28] all kinds of troubles but we're anchored
[1:06:31] that's all it'll never sink it can't
[1:06:35] sink
[1:06:36] now I've noticed many Christians in my
[1:06:41] life to be up and down I've wondered
[1:06:45] about that and without preaching such a
[1:06:49] text as this out in the other churches
[1:06:52] to where I go I thought best to deliver
[1:06:56] it to my people here at the
[1:06:59] Tabernacle upon why are people so tossed
[1:07:03] about you find them people who seem to
[1:07:06] be very
[1:07:08] religious seems to have such a deep
[1:07:11] desire and daily they search and hunt
[1:07:15] and seek for God and never come to any
[1:07:19] settlement of any kind to where they
[1:07:22] could ever be settled are Anchored In
[1:07:26] Christ and this I have learned to be in
[1:07:31] experience that it is
[1:07:34] people of
[1:07:36] intellectuals now speaking this there is
[1:07:39] two different types of
[1:07:41] Christianity seems strange but I would
[1:07:44] not say two different types I say two
[1:07:47] different
[1:07:48] phases would be a better word to use not
[1:07:50] two types two phases the same
[1:07:52] Christianity but two two phases of
[1:07:55] it and one of them is an
[1:07:58] intellectual or a mental conception of
[1:08:02] what God has said in his word and of
[1:08:05] Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and
[1:08:09] the other is an experimental experience
[1:08:13] that God has given the man in his heart
[1:08:16] amen the one
[1:08:18] intellectually is a hunger he he's
[1:08:22] feasting on God
[1:08:24] but his his Feast doesn't hold
[1:08:28] out the other one seems to have Victory
[1:08:32] all the time there's nothing bothers
[1:08:35] them they're just as solid and anchored
[1:08:37] as they can be no trials no storms
[1:08:40] bothers them at
[1:08:42] all but they seem to have something
[1:08:45] about them that people who are
[1:08:48] Christians and trying to live for God
[1:08:50] admire that type of
[1:08:52] Christian and I've often wondered Lord
[1:08:55] what is it that these people has that
[1:08:58] others crave so much for and yet seem to
[1:09:01] fail to get
[1:09:03] it and I know that's a great question in
[1:09:06] all of our hearts who have served
[1:09:08] Christ and I've never seen a person yet
[1:09:10] that ever once come to him except they
[1:09:14] afterwards they life never seemed right
[1:09:18] to them anymore if they ever left Christ
[1:09:21] I was speaking yesterday to a little
[1:09:24] man who told me of a minister walking
[1:09:27] back and tearing up his preaching papers
[1:09:29] and throwed him into the trash box and
[1:09:31] said I'm through with it and the
[1:09:32] following Sunday got a case of beer and
[1:09:34] sat in the place and drank it couple of
[1:09:37] weeks after that Lay Dying on the
[1:09:40] bed if I had time I'd explain that how
[1:09:43] that works in the Bible but that'd be
[1:09:46] all of the
[1:09:47] text but that's another subject how that
[1:09:51] Satan come in and took the person God
[1:09:53] had to take his child home that's all
[1:09:55] all could happen but now to see this
[1:09:59] hungering for people and yet not able to
[1:10:03] reach it and many of our teachers and
[1:10:06] schools has brought in much Theology of
[1:10:10] telling the people well it's because you
[1:10:12] didn't shout because you didn't speak
[1:10:15] with tongues or because you didn't have
[1:10:18] these kind of
[1:10:19] gifts which I have nothing in part or to
[1:10:24] say against such things but allog
[1:10:27] together you find these people when they
[1:10:29] do shout or speak with tongues or some
[1:10:32] other emotion they still don't seem to
[1:10:35] be the person that they should be now we
[1:10:39] have know that to be
[1:10:41] true and I've often wondered myself just
[1:10:44] what could be done in that kind of a
[1:10:46] state of mind for the
[1:10:49] person so finding it so simple in the
[1:10:52] word of God
[1:10:54] we are try to explain it in order now to
[1:10:57] do this after seeing the intellectual
[1:11:01] part of the mind and the Soul which is
[1:11:03] in the heart now you truly have two
[1:11:08] different mental
[1:11:09] faculties you have one of them that's in
[1:11:12] your head by your brain and the other is
[1:11:15] operated in your heart which is called
[1:11:18] your
[1:11:19] soul your spirit and your
[1:11:22] soul
[1:11:24] now they are very much in disagreement
[1:11:27] many times when the head seems to say
[1:11:31] something the soul wonders at it if it's
[1:11:34] not right but when it comes into the
[1:11:36] soul the head seems to step back there's
[1:11:40] been things that's happened to you that
[1:11:42] you knew was going to be yet you could
[1:11:45] not explain why and there's no reason
[1:11:47] you couldn't explain it out but yet you
[1:11:49] just accepted it and it happened just
[1:11:51] that way that's when something happens
[1:11:54] down here in the great meetings of the
[1:11:57] vast fields of the campaigns I've
[1:11:59] noticed many people coming to me and
[1:12:02] saying oh I have all faith brother
[1:12:05] brand and interally they are right here
[1:12:11] but in their hearts it isn't there if it
[1:12:14] was they wouldn't be on the platform to
[1:12:15] be prayed for for a help of faith if
[1:12:18] they had
[1:12:19] Faith now we'll have to go back and get
[1:12:22] a type to bring this picture out to you
[1:12:25] this morning as children and I want you
[1:12:27] to notice closely I believe and tiing
[1:12:32] especially to to people it's
[1:12:36] uh it's easier for them to understand to
[1:12:40] illustrate it it's good to teach
[1:12:42] children and we're all children amen we
[1:12:45] we're just Adolescence in God who would
[1:12:48] here like to say I'm an adult grown up
[1:12:51] in God all we are not we're just just
[1:12:53] little babies in God that's right now we
[1:12:57] want to try to get this to a place where
[1:13:00] we can see exactly what God is
[1:13:03] doing so let's go back now to the Old
[1:13:06] Testament to get a view of this and
[1:13:08] we'll take it by the children of
[1:13:11] Israel when they were crossing the the
[1:13:14] Red Sea and come over into the promised
[1:13:17] land God by Sovereign Grace each night
[1:13:21] rained down Mana Out of Heaven and the
[1:13:25] peoples would go and eat take this mana
[1:13:28] and make it into bread or cakes or
[1:13:30] something and would eat this bread which
[1:13:33] sustained their life in the
[1:13:36] journey and we find out that many times
[1:13:40] if they left the Mana lay just a little
[1:13:42] too long on the ground it would uh it
[1:13:45] would
[1:13:45] melt run
[1:13:47] away just like uh Frost or something on
[1:13:51] the ground it it didn't hold
[1:13:55] now we see that that same thing is
[1:13:58] happening in
[1:14:01] Christianity many people before
[1:14:05] 9:00 get hungry you have a lot of
[1:14:10] Campground uh what would I say
[1:14:13] Campground
[1:14:15] Stars many people go to the service and
[1:14:19] rejoice and shout and praise the Lord
[1:14:22] while the SP of God is falling all
[1:14:25] condemnation left their heart and as
[1:14:28] soon as a day or two add to the reviv
[1:14:31] they find themselves back in that old
[1:14:34] grind
[1:14:36] again yet they're eating
[1:14:39] Mana many people come to Christ which
[1:14:42] has never been able in the Pentecostal
[1:14:46] world to make the Pentecostal people see
[1:14:50] this fundamental
[1:14:52] truth
[1:14:54] it's so hard because each church has its
[1:14:58] Doctrine and they hear their Pastor
[1:15:00] daily and evangelist speak something
[1:15:03] they say oh well I got it that what
[1:15:04] difference does it make but they fail to
[1:15:07] get this
[1:15:09] truth now I've often spoke and do yet
[1:15:14] and believe this great faith or
[1:15:17] fundamental truth that Jesus Christ said
[1:15:20] he that heareth my word
[1:15:23] amen and believeth on him that sent me
[1:15:27] ha everlasting life Hallelujah and shall
[1:15:30] not come into condemnation but has
[1:15:32] passed from Death unto
[1:15:36] life you see
[1:15:38] it he that Hearth my
[1:15:43] word oh I wished I could sink it into
[1:15:46] every
[1:15:47] heart St John
[1:15:49] 5:24 he that Hearth my word and and
[1:15:53] believe
[1:15:56] us on him that sent me
[1:15:59] have eternal everlasting life and shall
[1:16:04] never come into judgment but already
[1:16:06] passing death un
[1:16:09] life that's his
[1:16:12] word what do you have to do
[1:16:15] believe here Faith cometh by hearing
[1:16:18] hearing by the word and believing and
[1:16:22] applying
[1:16:24] and
[1:16:26] resting you see it the word says so hear
[1:16:32] it your heart says so believe
[1:16:36] it and your whole being rest in it it's
[1:16:41] finished heith cometh by hearing Jesus
[1:16:44] said the
[1:16:45] word he Hearth my words believeth on him
[1:16:48] and sent me half
[1:16:50] Eternal never ending oh always existing
[1:16:55] life isn't it
[1:16:58] marvelous every existing life and shall
[1:17:01] never
[1:17:03] perish but has already passed from Death
[1:17:08] unto
[1:17:09] life has PR passed from
[1:17:13] separation onto Everlasting
[1:17:16] presence
[1:17:18] amen already when he was an alien from
[1:17:22] God
[1:17:24] you've ceased from being an alien now
[1:17:26] you're a
[1:17:28] child from Death unto
[1:17:31] life from Darkness unto
[1:17:35] days from Mortal to
[1:17:38] Immortal from corruption to uh
[1:17:43] incorruption from weary unto
[1:17:48] Joy from Death unto
[1:17:51] life and
[1:17:54] resting
[1:17:56] fully upon thus sayith the
[1:18:00] Lord not upon
[1:18:03] feelings mental
[1:18:06] emotions
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:08] Theory upon some unknown something that
[1:18:12] somebody has said to you that has no
[1:18:16] basis upon someone say when you come
[1:18:19] join our church it'll be
[1:18:21] finished but upon on the word of God the
[1:18:25] human soul rest
[1:18:27] solid God said so that settles it makes
[1:18:32] it
[1:18:34] real now let's go quickly to the Second
[1:18:38] Step what makes these people go out on
[1:18:42] the ground and eat the
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:44] banner and
[1:18:47] then before night
[1:18:49] come many of them got hungry
[1:18:53] and people go to the meeting there's
[1:18:56] just many people who goes and turns the
[1:18:58] radio on and Hears A good sermon and
[1:19:01] rejoices many of them goes to church and
[1:19:04] they hear a good sermon and they go home
[1:19:06] and rejoice but what is that thing
[1:19:10] then that comes in and takes it all away
[1:19:13] from you the first little difficult that
[1:19:19] rises truly if you're hearing the word
[1:19:23] and your soul is rejoicing in the word
[1:19:27] it's the holy spirit that you're
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] eating see I believe that you believe
[1:19:34] onto everlasting
[1:19:37] life I believe that that you acceptance
[1:19:40] of the Lord Jesus gives you Everlasting
[1:19:44] eternal life when you believe it then I
[1:19:48] Believe by one Spirit then you're
[1:19:51] baptized into the the body of
[1:19:55] Believers we're going to get to it in a
[1:19:57] few minutes of God will you believe unto
[1:20:02] life he Paul said pass into the upper
[1:20:06] coast of Ephesus finding certain
[1:20:08] disciples he said have you received the
[1:20:12] Holy Spirit since you have
[1:20:16] believed see your faith anchors you in
[1:20:20] Christ that's intellectual
[1:20:24] you believe it you accept it you say
[1:20:27] that it's right you recognize it to be
[1:20:28] the truth and you're a Christian and
[1:20:31] you've got everlasting life by believing
[1:20:34] it you've entered to God you're on the
[1:20:38] campground man is are falling and you're
[1:20:40] eating
[1:20:42] it and did you notice the strange thing
[1:20:46] that was a mixed multitude eatting the
[1:20:48] same
[1:20:51] manner people who are sinners who does
[1:20:55] not accept the Lord Jesus can still
[1:20:59] enjoy the seeing the moving of the
[1:21:03] miracle of God Healing The
[1:21:05] Sick can rejoice in people doing
[1:21:09] right can open their hearts and rejoice
[1:21:13] in a
[1:21:13] sermon that's preached under the
[1:21:17] anointing and that's the same type of
[1:21:21] man that the Christian is
[1:21:27] eating you see
[1:21:29] it then you always remember my Doctrine
[1:21:34] here at the Tabernacle you have to
[1:21:35] follow God and trees because he's
[1:21:37] perfected in
[1:21:38] it now we wonder why and then we find
[1:21:42] out that this Mana would vanish it would
[1:21:44] come on the ground then vanish and come
[1:21:47] again and vanish every day some of it at
[1:21:51] 9:00 they were gone I met people who'
[1:21:54] stand in the church and just
[1:21:58] rejoice and see them go outside the
[1:22:01] church and maybe Monday or Tuesday
[1:22:04] one just living un behaving becoming to
[1:22:10] a
[1:22:12] Christian and the man or woman whoever
[1:22:15] it may be return again and shake your
[1:22:18] hand and say I don't want to do those
[1:22:21] things
[1:22:24] you feel sorry for
[1:22:26] them you seen people accept Divine
[1:22:30] Healing and say oh yes I see it it's in
[1:22:33] the word oh thank you Lord I believe
[1:22:36] it and they'll go all right for a few
[1:22:40] days and the first little storm
[1:22:43] Strikes Back To Go
[1:22:46] Again you've noticed it and it's true
[1:22:50] and the people can't help it
[1:22:53] so what's it all about what causes these
[1:22:57] things to
[1:22:59] happen now let's
[1:23:02] notice now we
[1:23:04] notice that this manner when it fell God
[1:23:08] sending it down to provide life for the
[1:23:11] children of Israel in their
[1:23:13] Journey then God told Moses and Aon to
[1:23:17] go make a great golden
[1:23:19] pots and to fill it full of of uh mana
[1:23:24] and to put it in the Holy place or the
[1:23:29] holiest of holy places by the ark this
[1:23:34] Mana was to be set by the
[1:23:38] ark and there it never failed it never
[1:23:44] got old it never lost its
[1:23:47] sweetness it was always good inside
[1:23:51] there did you you ever meet a person
[1:23:54] that's been in there and is tasted and
[1:23:57] living on this Mana you can meet him on
[1:24:01] Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday

[1:24:19] he's living under the glory of
[1:24:23] God he never gets hungry he never has to
[1:24:26] go to church to get buil up he he's just
[1:24:29] always full of
[1:24:31] God people go to church and they'll
[1:24:34] shake their hand in church and laugh and
[1:24:35] call your brother outside the church
[1:24:39] they pull a little business
[1:24:41] deal that wouldn't be just exactly
[1:24:44] straight for personal gain I don't say
[1:24:48] that people are here in a tabernacle but
[1:24:50] I say there
[1:24:51] is
[1:24:53] there's things that people would do and
[1:24:56] they get different a least little thing
[1:24:58] or bring that old Tipper back
[1:25:00] again that's
[1:25:02] selfishness open up an ear to hear
[1:25:05] gossip or do something of that
[1:25:08] type that person has never entered into
[1:25:12] this poot in
[1:25:14] here they're outside there're truly
[1:25:16] eating the same kind of
[1:25:18] [Music]
[1:25:20] matter they've been brought into the
[1:25:24] camp and there's where in the camp of
[1:25:26] the field is where the people got the
[1:25:31] Mana and they're in there and that Mana
[1:25:35] that they eat is the same Mana this man
[1:25:37] eats here they both have the same
[1:25:41] pasture they both read the same
[1:25:44] Bible but one constantly stays true and
[1:25:48] humble and the other guys ups and downs
[1:25:51] are going like this is in and
[1:25:53] out both of them eat the same man but
[1:25:56] one has entered in and the other is
[1:25:59] still
[1:26:01] out both of them are believers under
[1:26:04] eternal
[1:26:05] life but one is baptized with the Holy
[1:26:09] Spirit in the kingdom of God and the
[1:26:11] other is outside eating the same
[1:26:14] mana and the people has been telling us
[1:26:17] that you have to shout to get in here
[1:26:19] you have to speak with tongues to get in
[1:26:21] here you have to do all all these things
[1:26:23] but we find out that those things don't
[1:26:28] work I see people shout that wasn't I
[1:26:31] don't hardly think I have no way of
[1:26:33] judging you shouldn't I've seen people
[1:26:36] shouting that Liv any kind of
[1:26:38] aive I've seen people dance in the
[1:26:41] spirit up and down their
[1:26:43] halls and come back out and living
[1:26:48] horrible I've seen both men and women do
[1:26:50] that I've seen men men and women dance
[1:26:53] in the spirit and speak with tongues and
[1:26:55] Shout that had a temper like I don't
[1:26:58] know
[1:26:59] why there's something
[1:27:02] wrong and yet they enjoy the blessings
[1:27:05] of
[1:27:06] God they believe in him they have faith
[1:27:10] in him but it's only in this outer Court
[1:27:14] it never has come to the inner
[1:27:17] Court they've never got from here down
[1:27:20] here amen
[1:27:22] that's what's the matter with the the
[1:27:24] the churches
[1:27:25] today I hope you see it oh my when I can
[1:27:31] see a preview of it it makes me
[1:27:36] Rejoice
[1:27:38] seeing that our anchor holds within the
[1:27:41] veil the Bible said he that
[1:27:45] overcometh will I give a white
[1:27:49] stone and a new name
[1:27:52] that no one knows but he
[1:27:56] himself don't make any differ what
[1:27:58] people
[1:27:59] say you know
[1:28:02] yourself when you've been brought into
[1:28:05] the inner
[1:28:06] Veil no one could tell you any different
[1:28:10] not because you join church because you
[1:28:13] did this or that but something just
[1:28:14] tells you you got a
[1:28:18] stone amen that's in the heart not a
[1:28:22] hard Stone a soft one this Stone makes
[1:28:26] your heart soft instead of
[1:28:29] hard in
[1:28:31] Ezekiel in old times when the laws were
[1:28:35] put into the Tabernacle in the ark the
[1:28:38] laws of God Ezekiel spoke of another
[1:28:42] time now the people there's two classes
[1:28:45] of people today them same crisis that's
[1:28:47] trying to do something to say
[1:28:50] themselves each one says I'll go to
[1:28:52] church every Sunday that's very good I
[1:28:56] want to be religious that's very good
[1:28:59] that's still under the
[1:29:02] law but when the other by going to
[1:29:06] church and being good is not something
[1:29:08] that you do yourself it's something in
[1:29:10] you doing it for
[1:29:12] you the holy
[1:29:14] spirit in your
[1:29:16] heart now I notice in this
[1:29:20] intercourse these people that live
[1:29:22] inside here seem to have always Fed Up
[1:29:27] always feeling good Ezekiel said I will
[1:29:31] write my laws a new and put it in their
[1:29:35] hearts amen for the law used to be on
[1:29:38] stones in the ark and the Ark represents
[1:29:41] the
[1:29:42] heart that I will put my new law in
[1:29:47] their hearts in the
[1:29:50] ark the heart is the Abode of God and in
[1:29:54] the Old Testament God dwelt In His glory
[1:29:57] over the
[1:29:59] earth and the heart is the
[1:30:03] ark God dwells not in the head in the
[1:30:06] heart God's not known by theology God's
[1:30:10] not KNN by mental conception God's known
[1:30:14] by an oldfashioned stifi Born Again
[1:30:18] experience that's in the human
[1:30:20] heartall yet men and women live a good
[1:30:23] life and love God by mental
[1:30:26] conceptions but the real hiding places
[1:30:30] in the heart hid with Christ and when
[1:30:34] Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your
[1:30:36] heart he is in you with your
[1:30:39] temperament and he's living his own life
[1:30:42] to his own will through
[1:30:45] you

[1:30:50] right Christ so yielded you are that
[1:30:55] Christ speaks the kind of words he'

[1:31:00] would think through you he does the kind
[1:31:03] of works he would do through you you are
[1:31:06] yielded and

[1:31:22] gain not me that liveth anymore but
[1:31:25] Christ that liveth in
[1:31:28] me Christ Living in the individual soul

[1:31:36] lips and thans through the Mind sees
[1:31:38] through the eye acts through the
[1:31:41] temperaments
[1:31:43] Hallelujah and the things of the world
[1:31:46] has passed
[1:31:48] away how can it be anything but sweet
[1:31:51] and pleasant all the time oh Hallelujah

[1:36:51] of us could ever be it was a role to

[1:36:57] world and you can feel as he's preaching
[1:37:00] you can feel the love that he has in his
[1:37:02] heart and you can feel that the
[1:37:04] correction that he gives us but it's all
