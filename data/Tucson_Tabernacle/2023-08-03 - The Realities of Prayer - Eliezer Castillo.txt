works [Music] so now we'll pray over Lord we thank you and we might do it backwards but Lord you're always right Lord we appreciate that bless each heart that he was willing to give and in whatever Lord sometimes we we might just have that might in our pocket but you saw Lord that when that's that sister gave that little mic and you said that meant more Lord so what everyone has given Lord to the use Lord of what is is good for the body of Christ for this building whatever it might be needed for Lord we just committed to you and put it in your hands and thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God loves a cheerful Giver so even when sometimes it's hard to smile while you do it God will bless you there's been times when you've looked in what you have in your hand and say Lord and God looks at it and says it's like two fishes and I've got six thousand people to feed and he says more than enough more than enough amen amen not to believe we had one more verse to that song

a need as we sing it one more time if just asking Heal Me Oh Lord and I will save me [Music] you are the one I praise amen I liked what brother Aaron said that where everybody's talking about climate change but the church is looking for a change in this body and then the dead in Christ shall rise we'll see those that have gone on the dead in Christ shall rise rise first and those of us which are alive and remain shall not hinder those which are dead which sleep and then we will all go together and meet the Lord Jesus in the air it's gonna happen friends and it's going to happen a lot faster than climate change is going to happen we have uh brother Kenny Phillips if you would if you would come and bring the prayer requests that we have I'm going to mention some prayer requests and if you would bring those before the Lord first I want to greet our visitors God bless you all brother Jeremiah good to see you again my friend God bless you Sister Stephanie brother Tony God bless you good to have you and the family here um I think I mentioned brother Kenny sister Rachel God bless you I'm serious sister Donna God bless you I lost there you are it's next to sister Rachel God bless you um

all our loved ones today the ones with thee your problems the ones that stand in need our ministers he brings forth a word Lord just one word from you is worth more than anything he can say God speak through him this day give us your will in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] again we'll sing Amazing Grace but Aaron if you could lead us again dear friend brother Eli someone that I have a lot of confidence in and I pray that you came here this morning expecting because you won't be disappointed the Lord I believe is going to speak to his sheep this morning and I also want to mention to is if you have something on your heart if you have an ailment if you need prayer for something I believe maybe the Lord's leading that we would have prayer after this service today so at the close of service prepare yourself and we will have have prayer for the sick after service God bless you all over there [Music] I once was nothing [Music] amen God bless each and every one of you I greet you all in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's always pleasure to be here and to fellowship with each and every one of you in in the worship and Adoration of our Lord Jesus Christ I just I'm so honored to be here to be behind the sacred desk and and for the confidence that our our pastor brother Daniel Evans has I I don't take that lightly at all I feel you know even coming in here I could feel the presence of the Lord I know somebody brought their liquor fire somebody came here believing not because uh we're gonna sing or worship or we're going to hear a man but because there was going to be a supernatural thing happen in this place um and every time we come into this place every time we assemble together we know that there has to be something happen in our lives something has to happen every time we have that little expectation we know that God is going to appear on the scene amen so I came here expecting trusting in the Lord that he has something in store for us amen um let us go straight to the scriptures if you would like if you would like to turn with me to Luke 11 chapter 11 and verse 1 and we're going to be reading Luke 11 1 and then we're going to jump to Matthew 6. verses 5. to 13. whenever you have it just go ahead and say Amen I spoke to brother um Octavio yesterday and he made sure to tell me to greet brother Daniel and the church all of Jericho Tabernacle they just um enjoy our brother Daniel and his ministry and and um we're just so thankful for that amen all right let's uh go to 11 1 of Luke it says and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he seized one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples and if you would like to turn with me to Matthew 6 5 and 13 5-13 it says now now they asked him this question Luke and and right away right after those scriptures or right after those verses Jesus says okay this is this is the template this is how you pray and he began to to to say the prayer Our Father which art in heaven and Luke he he shows them uh or he or in Matthew Matthew shows a different way of what Jesus said when he was about to talk about the Lord's Prayer he says when thou prayests thou shall not be as Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in synagogues and in corners of streets that they may be seen of men verily I say unto you that they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to the Father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in in secret shall reward thee openly what a beautiful promise he said Our Father which is in secret he will see your secret prayer and he will reward you openly but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as heathens do for they think that they shall be heard for their um for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what ye have need of before you ask him isn't that amazing he already knows what you need he just needs a little petition he needs you to go and confess it to him but he already knows your heart and we have to remember that um and then also says after this manner there therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread forgive us our depths as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful that you've allowed us to be here once again father that we can be under your presence Lord unworthy as we are father but yet we want to give you all the honor and the glory Lord Jesus we come here for more of you father each and every person that has arrived in this place father you know their heart father you know their motive and their objective and you know that that many of them are Desiring more and more of a closer walk with you father God lord and you said ask in my name and and it shall be done for you if ye abide in me and my words and you ask whatever you want Lord so we come here asking father petitioning our needs unto you father knowing it's all for your honor and Glory I father I ask that you just bring your Holy Spirit and and have the preeminence father we subject ourselves into thee father we ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen you may be seated um it's such an honor like I said just to be here and to fellowship with each and every one of you um my sermon today it's a very simple one it's a very simple topic but I had it impressed in my heart for quite a while um it's the realities of Prayer there's realities in prayer and and a lot of times we it becomes very religious right it becomes a very monotonous thing and it's almost a sacrifice to go and to shut yourself away with God and and speak to in in natural you speak to nothing you're just there and it's quiet and you're you're trying to make conversation with something that might be there that's the natural way of thinking about it and a lot of times it's easy to get into that monotony and speak and not really know what you're saying but Jesus says don't don't do any vain babblings don't be don't try to make your prayers nice it's a prayer is a heartfelt thing I've heard a brother say you don't pray with your lips you pray with your heart so no matter what our prayer says outside it's the heart that God is looking at and and the Bible says he says he is already he already knows what you need before you even ask him but he needs you to go to the source and knock on the door and be persistent and ask him every single day until your petition is recognized but remember as you pray remember that God has already known your petition before you even ask before you even ask God God is already there saying son ask me and I'll do it and I I try to understand why why does God want us to ask him and I started to think about I don't know why in my life I always encounter people that want to um I don't know if debate or or go against the word and and believe me they are well studied the people that I talk to they're not these like uh they just don't know these people know the Quran they know the book of Buddha the monk book and they've read the Bible three times and and they know all of these things so when they go they have their ammunition and a lot of times one of the most common questions that I get is is that if God is so good why why is he allowing that little child to starve why is he allowing that that baby to to have cancer and he never knew sin why is all those things happening and of course people have their their ideas I'm not going to go and I'm not going to tell you all these things but they have these questions and then they also have a rebuttal if they if they say well you know what God allows those things and it's actually um sin that allowed all those things to happen and that's why we're going through those things and then they say well why does that happen and then we hear of a divine intervention over here so also why can God answer a prayer here or answer um divinely over here but yet over here he doesn't do it here and for me I ask myself I say why does God need us to pray when he already knows what we need when that person is starving out there the homeless out there is is suffering out there he already knows their need but he needs a connection from Heaven to Earth and I think that's the biggest difference between divine intervention here and nothing here it's the a matter of who's intervening on Earth who's pleading with God on Earth because God his license to the Earth is you in in the beginning God God created everything and for some reason I'm jumping my notes like crazy but I'm just gonna go with what God wants here but in the beginning God created everything and if you notice when he created the beast from the field he says let us create Beasts of the Earth so so their source was the Earth and what sustained him was their source which was the field that they came from when he said let us create whales and these great creatures he said out of the water these that was their source of their creation was out of the water out of the Dust he grabbed the dust and he began to create those things that were already on the ground that were already in the water all those minerals all those things he already created it but when he came to man he didn't do that he didn't say let us create man from this or from that he said let us create man in our image that was a spirit man so what is the source of man what is the source of our whole being is God the source of the whale is the water the source of the Beast is the field but the source of man is God himself so he created a spirit man and then right when he created it and he said let him have dominion over this Earth let him have that Dominion so then he he created man just from him then he said now you're going to rule over the Earth and whenever he was going to allow him to rule over the Earth he said let us form him now out of the Earth Earth out of the dirt so this man was a spirit man yet he connected him to the very thing he was going to have dominion over so now this man is connected to God and he's connected to the dirt and and God allows that to happen because that is God's legal or licensed way to work in this earth because he didn't say let us have dominion no he said let them but my spirit's going to be in them and that's how I work through them because they are part of me and as they dwell and they have dominion I am working through them but it was it was sin that separated all those things and what happened was sin separated the dirt from the spirit where God's spirit could not even if it touched the mountain nobody better touch it only only sanctified people could go into the temple they couldn't even see his Pillar of Fire they were so scared they said let God not speak to us brother Branham said he is two mysterious his spirit so he needed a body he needed you and I so that he could work through those things and so whenever something needs to take place like healing when death is knocking at the door when it seems like things will not change and it's getting worse and worse and worse whether it's sin whether it's it's a sickness there has to be a divine intervention where does that divine intervention come Lord help my brother Lord help me Lord and what happens there is a connection that happens in our lives the God is licensed to say now it's my turn now I get to move because God has or man has called unto me now I can move through him because he connected that way of course there was many things that happened that allowed us to have that of course it was Jesus Christ it says whenever he was baptized the Dove came down and said Heaven and Earth kissed but Jesus paved that way so that whenever you need that comforter whenever you need Jesus Christ all you have to do is call upon his name and he's quick to answer but we have to believe that that that's a reality that's that's it right there if I don't believe that's what all the devil's trying to do is make you disbelieve the word when he get he's attacking the word oh he's attacking my home he's attacking my dog he's attacking this no he's attacking the word and when he attacks the word it causes you to disbelieve when he attacks your your body when he attacks your children what he's making you do is disbelieve the word of God but you we have to stay in that constant communication now Jesus was the greatest human being on Earth there was no man like Jesus Christ people people try to separate the Divinity of God in that man but God says or brother Branham said no he was he was a God man yes he did cry when Lazarus died but he was the same one that said Lazarus come out yes he was the one that was dying but he was the same one that Rose the third day he was the greatest man on Earth the greatest man and and you know what I don't know how I would have reacted if I was there to see him say to the blind sea to see him say to the leper be clean to see him walk on the water I don't know if I would be foolish enough to even say Lord how did you even do that look teach me how to do that I don't know what I would have said but you you get those questions Lord how do you do how did you do that maybe we would have asked him teach us how to do that Lord teach us how to how how to speak and things happen teach us Lord teach me how to speak your word teach me to have that spoken word as brother Branham called it but whenever the disciples after seeing all these things he saw Jesus prayed and when he saw Jesus pray their question wasn't teach us how to walk on the water teach us how to heal the sick he said teach us how to pray Lord my mind is why at that question you're with them for three and a half years and you ask him teach us how to pray I think they had a revelation the Bible says that he was before the sun hours before the sun even came up he was in a secluded place praying for hours in hours says that he would go up to a mountain in a secluded place and pray not in front of everybody not in front of his disciples he would go alone and pray the greatest man on Earth prayed he only had three and a half years of ministry and and he spent his time in prayer I just wanted to use understand that just so that we don't think prayer oh man I don't think I have time oh man that's an investment prayer is an investment he had time to pray and he spent hours and hours and hours in prayer and then in the morning when they would finally wake up he said ah let's go to the town ah let's go let's go to Jerusalem let's go here and whenever he would go and see the leper he'd say be clean the leopard was clean whenever he'd see the blind he said see and they would see they would go and they say oh my daughter is dead oh she's just sleeping rise up my goodness and maybe in their mind they they said man he is spending seconds with man but doing this thing doing this thing all by himself he spends hours and I heard a brother say he says you know what we have to spend hours with God in seconds with man that's why he was able to say those things do those things why he was in connection with God prayer began to be a reality in his life to to where he he's the definition of prayed up he's the definition of preventative maintenance he is that definition a lot of times chaos strikes in our homes and we're there on our knees Lord what are we doing we're cleaning up the mess we didn't have preventative maintenance we're there on prayer and prayer and prayer and prayer and prayer Lord fix this problem that I could have maybe fixed a long time ago but we're here trying to clean up clean up the mess because we weren't in contact with God hey I'm I'm to blame there's many times where I was unprepared for things that were there signs were there but when everything fell I said oh my goodness I could have I could have fixed all of this with just a few little words of Prayer but because I was so busy in my life and things were happening in my life I forgot to give God the glory you spend hours with God you'll you'll spend seconds in your situation or you'll know why that situation is happening you'll be calm in the storm because you know Lord I've been with you Lord I've been praying and I know whatever is happening whatever is taking place I know it's all for your honor and your glory but it's because you're in prayer every single day so they asked him teach us teach us how to pray now um another thing I want to point out is is they asked him teach us how to pray prayer is a learned activity we don't just give our heart to the Lord and then we just know how to talk to the savior it's something that we have to ask God lord teach me how to pray Lord brother Branham whenever he gave his heart to the Lord what did he do he well let me write him a letter how do I get in contact with this person what do I have to write write him a text message where do I go what social media do I go to brother Brandon tried to write him a letter then he went to where he went to a spot and and he he's like okay well they I see them fold their hands I see them get on their knees he didn't know how but when that desperation began to rise up he says I don't know how to talk to you Lord I know there's a special way to talk to you but I need you then God stopped listening to the letter stop listening to the formalities he began to listen to his heart and his Hearts cry and when he heard that God was on the scene but Lord teach me how to pray because prayer isn't this just this little conversation like we would have prayer isn't just oh I gotta go talk to my buddy of course you can be comfortable that way but you're going to the almighty God you're coming into his presence you got to know that things are going to take place when you begin to speak not just from your lips but from your heart you have to know that it's not a small talk because because Jesus even told him he said didn't you say Lord Lord but your heart was far from me man I could talk all day and yet I'm still thinking about yesterday at work I could be doing all that but God wants our full Uninvited undivided attention he wants our heart to be poured out because he doesn't care what we say he doesn't care what we do he cares about the heart's desire just like that child that was an orphan his mother and his father passed away he was living with a cruel man and one day this man's walked by and he sees this little kid saying his ABCs a b c d e f g he says what is he doing son he must have thought son you're doing it all incorrect he said what are you doing he said you know what my mom died my father died and now I'm living with this man and I'm I'm praying for this cruel man but I my mom used to pray but I don't know how to pray so I learned the ABCs so that I can say all the letters in the alphabet and God can formulate what's in my heart it's not the words you say it's what's in your heart the Bible even says that there's things that we can't even utter that our mob our words we can't even express it maybe we have so much pain maybe we have so much need that I I don't know what to say but yet the Holy Spirit comes and with groanings that we don't understand he goes to the father with that petition and he says I know exactly what she needs I know exactly what he needs without even saying a word he just wants you to go and and cry out to him and say Lord I need you and God will take all that broken up English broken up Spanish whatever you speak he'll take that and he'll formulate to to a sweet smelling savior to the to God he'll bring that petition even brother Branham says when you pray under that name of Jesus Christ it's no more you it's no more e like I still praying as Jesus Christ himself petitioning saying Lord I need something and when you pray in that name watch out mountains watch out problem watch out sickness it has to move it has to change but you have to believe he says abide in me in my words in you that means you have to be in constant communication constant dwelling in Christ abide in me how can I say Lord Lord I need this and he says man you're not even abiding in me your father your heart so far from me yet we say Lord Lord Lord I need this Lord I need that brother let me tell you this whenever you abide in Christ you begin to pray his word pray his promises over your life not even knowing maybe it sounds selfish yet God's saying you're praying what I already spoke and I have to honor my word brother Branham says in in perseverance he said you must first find the will of God before you can do the will of God first you have to find it how do we find the will of God you must first know what his will is in the matter and then don't turn it loose as the lady said today she was trying to get beyond that sound barrier then the plane just picks up picks up speed and goes on Unlimited when it passes the sound barrier brother Branham says well when you can pray until you pass the doubt barrier then you're running free you can go on then you're there's nothing can bother you then because you're running free past the unbelief it's done it's been settled it's all over when you get Assurance in your heart that it's going to be that way you're as happy as it already happened brother we what happens we have to find that will of God we another word in other words we have to find the mind of Christ we have to find the mind of God in the matter of Our Lives whether it's financially whether it's spiritually whether it has to be done with your your family your children whatever it might be find God in the matter many times as human beings we try to find the hand of God instead of the Mind what is the hand it's the works we follow the works we follow the Miracles we follow those things but when you find the mind of God you find his ways you find what he truly thinks about your situation what he wants to do with you there's a brother that said an amazing quote and uh man I'm gonna hold that to me he said more work is done by prayer than work itself we try to find the hands of God we try to do the work we try to do this but sometimes God says you know what you got to invest time in prayer and when prayer is done then the work becomes a whole lot easier it becomes a way open for you God shows what you need to do in your life so prayer is you get more work done than work itself and the only way you can find his ways is by prayer find his will is by prayer he he says brother Branham says an expectation he says what a man calls great God calls foolish and what man calls foolish God calls great so what we've got to do is get back into the program of God and find out after all what God wants us to do and the only way I know to do it is prayer that's the only way we can find that what God wants us to do he says prayer is the key that that's the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings man I don't take that lightly brothers and sisters he says there there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer will change the mind of God did you know that it did it it and it did do it one time now that's that's a mouthful for me that prayer changed the mind of God now like I said God needs us God created man in his own image he needs us so that he can act on Earth and the way he does it is by this divine intervention of Prayer so that he can change his mind that's something but uh we've got to remember that we are spirit and we are dirt and a person that is not in communication with God we begin to be governed by the dirt we've got to remember that that we need that constant communication of the source the the beasts the animals they need that source of the dirt the whales they need that source of the water but we Are Spiritual creatures inside this clay and if we can cut communication with God we begin to be governed by our bodies governed by our own thoughts governed by our own feelings governed by what the world wants us to be governed by but it's by the Holy Spirit we need to be governed by the part there is a partnership between you and God and that is prayer this is this is how the only way a child can reason with God now these things these things are are a lot to me because God for me he doesn't change his mind for me you cannot reason with God but yet brother Brandon was saying God can be changed in his mind also you see scriptures where Abraham reasoned with God it said he reasoned with him with his son and he reached him with him inside for Sodom and Gomorrah he said God God said I'm going to destroy all of them Abraham said well what if there's 50 righteous he said okay I won't destroy it for 50. and and Abraham he was bold Abraham didn't say okay I'm gonna stop there he said what about 40. okay 40. what about 30. 30. 20 10 he said 10 and he walked away but he reasoned with God he changed his mind God says I'm going to destroy all of them but Abraham said if there is 10 please don't do it God says Ah okay so there's there's a way that that you can change God's mind how my mind I think how can I change God's mind brother Branham says in the message presuming he says all right so Israel God Called Moses out and said I am going to destroy the whole nation just step aside he's telling Moses step aside Moses I know you love them but I got to destroy all of them they messed up this time Moses interceded thrown himself in the breach you're doing that for your children you're doing that for the sickness that is trying to take over your life you're doing that so that you can receive the Holy Ghost so you can have a more fulfilled life you're interceding Moses interceded throwed his self in the breach now listen to this it was Christ in Moses does God change his mind this is God all the time you get you abide in Christ so much that you begin to pray his word to him you don't even know you're doing it when you get so much in his will you begin to preach back to him his word God cannot fail in his word he said it was Christ and Moses you see God would have killed the whole world one time for sin but Christ throwed himself in the breach for the whole human race brother Branham says man there was one time I I thought Jesus loved me and God hated me or he was mad at me he realized that Christ was the very heart of God it was God the whole time what amazing thing he says and and and Moses says you made a promise God this is him reasoning with God you made a promise that you would take them to a land that's right what did Moses do to God when it looked like God was going to do something contrary he throwed the word in his way amen oh I love that now I feel like shouting just talking about it you see to put the word in the way God cannot walk over his own word said you promised to do it you said you would take him to a good land that was flowing with milk and honey I told them what you said and here we are we are in your hands that was Moses talking to God if ye abide in me and I and my words abide in you hear what he says if you abide in him and his words abide in me then ask why because you're speaking his word then God begins to use you it's never God changing his mind it's God using the human body the child of God to divinely intervene in this world when you you think oh God I'm unworthy God's saying I'm going to use him today oh God help this person help this man that I saw him at Walmart and he wasn't doing good not knowing that it was predestinated for you to speak that word for that child that child of God it was predestinated for you to pray for your children Lord why does all these things happen not knowing you're the one standing in the breach and it's God Christ in you speaking back to his word I think that's beautiful I think I think that's prayer becomes more real to me you're not just talking to the air there's a god with his attention fully on you the worst thing to have is talking to somebody and their mind is somewhere else God's not like that God's not saying oh I got to do with this and I got to deal with this what do you want son no he put all of his attention to you if I'm boldly to say not because I'm special or not because I'm somebody because it's Christ in me and all he's doing is he's aha to his own word he's saying Amen to his own word and he says amen it's being fulfilled amen you're speaking my words that's all it is our prayers that is inspired by the Holy Spirit become decrees to God not selfish petitions of personal gain James he says ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may be consumed upon your own lusts he's basically saying you you ask and you don't receive because your motives and your objectives are selfish we have to abide in him and his words in us and then when we pray I'm not saying that we can't pray personal prayers but in the end of the day it's all for the honor and the glory of God but when we go and we look at our personal and we're like oh I want to do this for a personal game that leaves God outside how can God fulfill that prayer how can God say oh I got you I'm going to help you when all he can do is listen to his own word listen to his own decree your prayer becomes the word of the Lord to him and as far as I know the word when it was spoken the logos came out it became an agent when God would speak an agent or a spirit would come out and do the things that he would speak brother Brandon says our words our tongue either holds death or life our words so we could either speak death or we could speak life what I see on that is there's two parties or two things that are anxiously waiting for what we say either death and what controls death or life and life his name is Jesus Christ he says he is the great high priest and he's waiting he's sitting there waiting to be sent out that logos when you speak and you say Lord help this logos goes out the intercessor gets your petition and goes out but there was there was one time and I hope this story it's very um it stands out where where this woman walked up to the platform with brother Brown it was actually on video and he begins to discern and God begins to use him in a mighty way and and when he was done she started to walk but then the spirit caught something he said wait wait wait hold on hold on I see a dark shadow over you he said ah it was a lie it was a lie oh your pastor said this your pastor said that you're a witch it was a lie they're just words words that can't hurt us right what was it death waiting for those words to come out saying come on send me and when we speak when we gossip about one another spirits come out and when he began to say you're a witch you're a witch a dark shadow overshadowed her this is just not words here there were Spirits behind his words to where it tormented her and he said stop believing those lies you're not a witch go on come on so if that can happen imagine good words praying for one another I know he's struggling I know I saw her she's struggling I saw her at the store she she was an acting very Christian like Lord help her instead of instead of anything else you go and you speak good words it says that a prayer of a mother even when she passes away is still intervening for that child your words they never they never end Jesus said God says my words will not return to me void that means they have to produce what has been said and whenever we pray whenever we talk for one another our words will not come void because we believed in the word we believed it just like Jesus or God believed in his own word when he said let there be light there was light maybe it could have took billions of years but there had to be light God wasn't stressing over his own word God believed in what he said and he allowed the process to take over and whenever we pray for one another allow the process to take over and believe that one another will be all right because there's an agent his name is Jesus he's been sent to go and intercede he's the only one the only high priest that can go between us and God and say Here's this petition here's this accept it Lord your prayers are more real than our physical being is your spirit who you truly are is more real than us standing here and God he will answer you even before you even speak God's already working on it God's already cooking God's already sending angels out God's already planning things and he's just waiting on you to get down on your knees and pray God was already working and and Daniel went and prayed and he prayed and he prayed and he prayed for three weeks he prayed the angel had to come and said man I was already out when you first spoke your first word I was already working on your situation now Danny wasn't praying a selfish prayer he was preaching or praying thy kingdom come kind of Prayer those are the prayers that we want when Jesus says praying like this he didn't say pray this prayer he says let me give you a blueprint let me give you a template and the first thing he said is our father that is Abba Father dad Papa God God father Our Father which is our which is in heaven your name be holy holier than anything thy kingdom come that's the first prayer Lord before my daily bread before my daily issues before anything that's going on in my life Your Kingdom Come Lord let your will be done Lord and God has to take place in your life because we're asking for his kingdom we're asking for him and what is his kingdom it's for God to dwell in his people you are the kingdom of God you are that Holy City John says or the angel told John you want to see the city or you want to see the bride he showed a city you're that City you're that temple of God that God wants to work through but we have to make that effort to say Lord your kingdom come your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven and and I tell you his will has to be done when you begin to plead his promises your will is his will when you plead his word your will is his will and God's legal right to act is through you God has to work and then you can get up and then you can get up and spend seconds in those issues you don't have to it said by the Finger of God the Devils were cast out not because we're somebody no we're connected to a lifeline it's God's divine intervention and God's divine intervention starts with prayer we have to be in constant communication everyone throughout the Bible that's what they had to do they kept constant communication when I started to look at this I said man every single man of God was in constant communication but all we see is the hands all we see is the the Red Sea be pulled apart all we see is whenever Elijah called down fire but if you look a little deeper first God had to speak to Moses first God had to have a communication with him before Moses could be this great prophet that we call great this this David that was a great king man you got a bunch of Psalms showing his prayers behind his life when he was in the greatest point of his life and when he was at the lowest he still kept communication that's the key we're human I'm human sometimes we're not living the High Life a lot of times sometimes the devil takes over in your life sometimes there's a backsliding that takes place but the thing that I can tell you is keep constant communication don't break that lifeline that's where we fail that's where when we don't when we fail to get back up when we fail to to say Lord I know you can help me I know I've I've got an answer for what I did Lord I know the consequences are coming but don't let me go don't let me lose Lord not don't let me not feel your presence with me Lord I know I messed up but fix it whether I have to hurt whether I have to go through things Lord just do something but Lord I'm not letting you go a lot of times the devil will put something in our mind to it say just give up you think he's going to listen to you now you think he'll do he'll still answer he answered David why because he had the True Heart of repentance he had the true heart that he loved God no matter how faulty of a person he was and and we're not holy we're only Holy by the righteousness of God by believing his word and because we believe in his word he will pick us up and he will help us out he will answer our prayers I know there's many needs here I've got many needs but there's a God here that wants to show himself through you all you have to do is believe brother Branham his song for every time he would go up to the pulpit 99 of the time was only belief preach the Seven Seals preached deep messages but only belief all things are possible to them that believe that's all we have to do we we don't we can't separate our prayer life from God from our works especially those that God has called you to do something great in the ministry called you to be a singer for the Lord somebody that plays an instrument for the Lord yeah you've got gifts but that's not what God wants God wants you to keep communication brother Branham said the gift is not what you do it's how much can you submit to the Lord of God how much can you submit to a man when you can submit to him then he can use the gift and you know what every single person in this place has a gift you have a gift for your family you have a gift at work you have something that God wants to use you through but we have to submit ourselves unto him amen let us stand to our feet I pray that um these words you can meditate on these words that prayer you can't fake prayer we can fake Church we can fake worshiping we can fake everything but prayer alone with God now you're coming into the presence of the one that knows everything about you you're coming into the presence of of the of the one that knows your truest and rawest form of you I can put on a smile you can put on a a nice suit a smile but nobody knows what's really going on inside but when you get into that Hour of Prayer you're you're going into the presence of the one that knows all about you then your words your lips it doesn't matter he's looking at your motive and your objective of your heart and for me that's comforting that's comforting that somebody knows me in all of my faults all of my issues you might we might hide it with a smile we might hide it with something but God knows how messed up we are sometimes how much we doubt yet we want to be the strong person sometimes how much how much we really hurt even though we we want to be the light in our family how much the sickness affects us how much it affects us to see our children a certain way whatever it might be God knows it so when we enter into this prayer don't don't you don't have to worry about who's behind you who's on the side who's in front of you there's a presence that knows everything and you know what the funny thing is he still loves you and every fault and every issue and everything he still loves you that is powerheads all right brother Evans if you like to pray foreign [Music] of the spirit if there's a request upon your heart raise your hand [Music] Lord look at Power out apart across this audience and
