[36:04] good evening
[36:06] you've never heard me say that before
[36:08] have you somebody's
[36:10] little child one time said oh I know
[36:12] that's the one that always says good
[36:13] evening
[36:15] well I I really appreciated the word
[36:18] this morning
[36:19] um brother Aaron didn't know it but it
[36:22] was a perfect lead into some of the
[36:24] things that were on my heart to share
[36:25] this evening
[36:26] and even some of the verses he used at
[36:29] first I thought
[36:30] oh and then I thought yes so uh but I've
[36:35] got a couple of things I want to say
[36:36] please please be seated and and I just
[36:39] want to talk to you for just a moment
[36:40] and then and then we'll get started
[36:42] because because tonight's a little bit
[36:44] shorter than usual so I've got a little
[36:46] extra time to just chat with you
[36:48] but uh you you may
[36:52] um you may be aware
[36:54] that uh 100 years ago
[36:58] this week
[36:59] and 100 years ago
[37:02] this month
[37:03] there was a there was a guy that was
[37:05] digging around in uh in Egypt
[37:09] in in Luxor and the Valley of the Kings
[37:12] and he was looking for something
[37:15] he was looking and looking he'd been
[37:17] looking for years for something that he
[37:19] thought it's there but no one had ever
[37:22] found it and it was a bit of a mystery
[37:25] and so they started digging on November
[37:28] 1st 1922
[37:30] and they were digging in an area that's
[37:32] just kind of a pathway in this Valley of
[37:34] the Kings in an area where the workman's
[37:36] Huts ruins or those used to be and they
[37:38] one of the guys dug a little bit and
[37:40] they found a step
[37:42] under the dirt
[37:44] oh they got a little excited and over
[37:47] the next couple of days that was
[37:48] November 3rd when they found that step
[37:50] by November 4th they didn't cover 12
[37:52] steps in a landing
[37:54] and thought Oh this might be it so this
[37:58] fellow Harvard Carter he sent back to
[38:00] England to Lord carnivan the fellow that
[38:02] was financing this Expedition
[38:04] and said come I think we found it
[38:07] so they got their like on November 23rd
[38:10] this guy and his daughter and and his
[38:12] wife and so forth and they finished
[38:14] digging down the 16 steps and they found
[38:16] this this door this passageway and it
[38:19] had been broken through into the past
[38:22] and they dug a little further and and on
[38:24] on November the 26th some accounts say
[38:27] November 25th but on November 26th they
[38:30] came to a door that had been sealed
[38:32] and it looked like it hadn't been broken
[38:35] and they punched a little hole on a
[38:37] corner of the door and stood back in
[38:39] case it was any bad air in there and
[38:41] they got this iron bar and poked it
[38:43] through to see if there was a bunch of
[38:45] rubble or something and they didn't
[38:47] contact anything without iron bar so it
[38:49] made the hole a little bit bigger
[38:51] they got a candle and they held it up in
[38:54] case any
[38:55] bad stuff came out right and no bad
[38:58] stuff and he got the candle through
[39:00] there
[39:01] and it was dim
[39:03] and his eyes took a little while to
[39:06] adjust
[39:08] and when they adjusted
[39:10] he saw a treasure he saw a gold and he
[39:13] was asked do you see anything
[39:16] and he said yes
[39:19] I see wonderful things
[39:21] and that's why we're here tonight
[39:23] because if God Will Open the Eyes of our
[39:26] heart then in the dim flickering light
[39:28] of the candle that will be holding up
[39:30] this evening looking through that little
[39:31] peephole of the word
[39:33] we'll be able to see wonderful things
[39:36] I'm here tonight because I'm expecting
[39:39] wonderful things and I trust you are too
[39:46] last time I spoke with you
[39:48] We examined some highlights from the
[39:50] Epistle of Paul the letter to the
[39:52] Ephesians
[39:54] we explored some of the promises how
[39:56] they applied to each of us
[39:58] personally
[39:59] and individually we put our names in
[40:01] there
[40:02] we learned how to not grieve the Holy
[40:05] Spirit what to avoid
[40:08] and what to practice
[40:10] tonight I want to share another lesson
[40:12] from this writing of Paul
[40:15] but first if I could ask you to please
[40:17] stand I'd like us to approach the Lord
[40:21] before we approach the word
[40:24] Lord Jesus
[40:26] our hearts are full we've sung songs of
[40:29] worship and praise and it's not just the
[40:33] musicians and it's not just brother
[40:34] Peter but it's each person that is here
[40:36] tonight lifting their heart and worship
[40:39] and praise and thankfulness and
[40:41] adoration to you Lord the lover and
[40:44] savior of our souls Lord Jesus we pray
[40:47] tonight that you'd speak to us through
[40:49] your word Lord that that these thoughts
[40:51] Lord that I I believe that are from you
[40:53] Lord that they would be a blessing Lord
[40:56] that whatever mistakes I might make in
[40:58] in saying things that people will hear
[41:01] and they'll hear from you help me to be
[41:04] out of the way to just step aside Lord
[41:06] that we can behold wonderful things and
[41:10] we thank you in Jesus precious name
[41:17] tonight
[41:18] we'll explore a bit more
[41:20] from that letter
[41:24] what it means and what it does not mean
[41:27] to be an imitator
[41:29] of Christ
[41:31] this works better Lyle if you turn it on
[41:34] yeah
[41:36] before we turn to Ephesians I'd like us
[41:39] first to turn to the book of beginnings
[41:41] Genesis it may seem like a strange
[41:44] introduction to a major theme of
[41:46] Ephesians
[41:47] but you're accustomed to that sort of
[41:49] thing by now from me right this is
[41:52] nobody's counting but this is the 80th
[41:54] time that I've stood behind her to talk
[41:56] to you
[41:57] for context
[41:59] God has created Abraham Adam excuse me
[42:02] and subsequently formed Eve they were a
[42:05] couple they're charged with filling and
[42:08] managing the Earth
[42:10] they're living in the Garden of Eden
[42:11] they have fellowship with God they are
[42:14] directly his creation his children made
[42:18] in His image
[42:20] Even Adam they're not always at the same
[42:23] place at the same time
[42:25] Satan seizes this opportunity when
[42:28] they're not together to communicate with
[42:31] Eve and to try to interfere with the
[42:34] plans of his arch enemy
[42:37] Yahweh he speaks to a creature known as
[42:41] the serpent the Serpent's not yet a
[42:44] reptilian snake the serpent is a what we
[42:47] think of as a hominid at this time a
[42:49] human-like creature
[42:51] capable of intelligent thought
[42:53] genetically very similar to humans
[42:59] think of Neanderthals to to get an idea
[43:01] of this sort of relationship I'm not
[43:03] claiming neanderthals were the creature
[43:05] called The Serpent
[43:06] I'm just using them to illustrate when
[43:08] you think of this person this this
[43:10] creature communicating with Eve it
[43:12] wasn't a snake hissing through a tree
[43:15] it's quite possible that Adam and Eve
[43:18] had conversations with this class of
[43:19] creature in the past Adam named him
[43:22] so Eve isn't shocked that this
[43:25] particular individual is able to
[43:26] communicate or even carry on a
[43:28] conversation
[43:30] Genesis 3 1 tells us the creature was
[43:32] subtle and the King James English and
[43:35] this means it was crafty it was shrewd
[43:39] it was cunning
[43:41] The Serpent and Eva are talking about
[43:43] God's admonition to not partake of the
[43:45] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[43:47] that's in the midst of the garden
[43:49] he says she's not to eat or even touch
[43:51] it or she would die
[43:53] let's pick up their interaction in
[43:55] chapter 3 verses 4 and 5.
[44:00] and and the serpent said and now we know
[44:03] of course it was Satan
[44:04] it entered into the creature referred to
[44:06] as a serpent he's speaking through the
[44:08] serpent and he said unto the woman unto
[44:10] Eve
[44:11] no you won't you shall not surely die
[44:16] that was Lie number one
[44:18] and he goes on to explain why he's
[44:20] making this statement God knows that in
[44:24] the day you eat thereof then rather than
[44:27] death
[44:28] eyes will be
[44:31] oh this is true based on verse 7 the
[44:33] eyes of them both are open he was
[44:35] appealing to vanity
[44:37] he was appealing to curiosity
[44:40] letting her in on what appeared to be a
[44:43] secret
[44:46] and you shall be as gods
[44:50] and the Hebrew it says you will become
[44:52] Elohim that's the same word that's
[44:54] translated Lord
[44:56] that was Lie number two
[44:58] knowing
[45:00] Good and Evil
[45:01] God called the tree of knowledge of Good
[45:03] and Evil in Genesis 2 17. so this
[45:05] assertion rang true so it's mixing
[45:08] things that are true things that sound
[45:10] true and contradicting the truth all in
[45:13] the same general appeal
[45:16] please be seated
[45:18] let's take a closer look
[45:21] at what we just read
[45:25] the first lie
[45:28] ye shall not surely die
[45:31] we see that Satan was disarming a
[45:34] defense that the Lord had put up to
[45:37] protect Humanity
[45:39] let's look at Genesis 2 verses 15 to 18
[45:42] to get the context of this warning from
[45:45] God
[45:46] the Lord God took the man
[45:49] which he had created in His image
[45:52] and put him in the Garden of Eden
[45:56] to dress it
[45:58] and to keep it
[46:00] Man was created to work
[46:02] not relax
[46:05] Ed
[46:06] Sly and the Lord God suggested
[46:10] hinted
[46:12] he commanded the man saying of every
[46:15] tree of the garden thou mayest freely
[46:18] eat and we assume this includes the tree
[46:21] of life because he says in the very next
[46:23] verse but of the tree of knowledge the
[46:26] sole exception the tree of knowledge of
[46:29] Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[46:31] for in the day thou eatest thereof
[46:34] Thou shalt surely die
[46:36] not I'll kill you but
[46:40] you'll die
[46:42] and the Lord God said it's not good that
[46:45] the man should be alone I'll make him
[46:47] and help meet for him a suitable
[46:49] companion to help him
[46:52] we see that God told Adam to avoid the
[46:55] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[46:56] before Eve was created
[46:59] before Eve was taken from the man
[47:02] God said don't do this
[47:04] there's a penalty
[47:06] that penalty's death
[47:09] you'll be committing suicide if you
[47:12] disobey
[47:14] so and Eve's conversation with the
[47:16] serpent she's repeating what her husband
[47:17] told her God had said now maybe it's
[47:20] some subsequent time God spoke to even
[47:21] told her the same thing we don't know
[47:23] there's no record of that
[47:25] oh that was your husband that told you
[47:27] that
[47:29] so the serpent said
[47:32] listen to me
[47:34] there's no penalty
[47:37] God's not protecting you
[47:40] he's trying to protect himself from you
[47:44] he's trying to use you
[47:46] keep you under his thumb
[47:49] he didn't argue that God had not really
[47:51] said to not eat the fruit he argued
[47:54] about why God had put this restriction
[47:57] in place
[47:58] he denied that there'd be a bad result
[48:01] the stated consequence was just a smoke
[48:03] screen for God to protect the secret of
[48:05] his own power from the humans hey
[48:08] maybe Adam was misquitting the warning
[48:10] it's just hearsay right he went on to
[48:13] appeal to her Pride her intellectual
[48:16] curiosity
[48:18] and the day you partake of the Forbidden
[48:20] thing not only will you not die rather
[48:23] your eyes will be opened
[48:26] your husband's out doing gardening
[48:28] you're here having a conversation about
[48:30] the things of God Adam will love you
[48:32] even more
[48:34] trust me on this I know here
[48:40] when I was a senior in high school
[48:42] in one of our classes we had a
[48:44] discussion about the Bible and religion
[48:47] one member of the class was an atheist
[48:49] he summed up and updated the Serpent's
[48:51] argument when he got up and said
[48:53] no no God didn't make Man In His Image
[48:56] man made God In His Image
[48:58] many people believe this today and in
[49:01] many cases it's true
[49:03] people make their own Gods
[49:06] Satan couldn't make that statement to
[49:08] Eve she along with Adam had fellowship
[49:12] with God and the cool of the evening she
[49:15] knew by experience that God was real and
[49:19] powerful and kind and loving
[49:22] she knew that but the appeal of the
[49:24] Serpent's argument
[49:26] you'll be just like him
[49:28] he'll be equal to him
[49:30] was enough to persuade Eve
[49:34] faced with her disobedient act Adam
[49:36] loved her enough to follow suit
[49:39] you shall be his gods
[49:42] Divine beings
[49:44] this is literally
[49:46] the oldest Temptation in the book
[49:50] well let's move on to Ephesians
[49:52] chapter 4
[49:54] that's what we left off last time but
[49:56] this time we'll start at verse 20.
[49:59] Paul has appealed to his readers to be
[50:01] kind to be thoughtful and so forth he's
[50:04] decried the wicked nature of man giving
[50:07] examples of common Behavior among the
[50:09] Pagan practices that his readers once
[50:12] followed
[50:14] and he's
[50:16] and he says but ye have not so learned
[50:18] Christ to do these carnal things is not
[50:21] the lessons you learned from the
[50:23] anointed one from the Messiah if so be
[50:27] that you have heard him and have been
[50:29] taught by him if you've paid attention
[50:31] to what you've been instructed by and
[50:34] about him as the truth is in Jesus
[50:38] that she put off
[50:39] remove
[50:41] step out of concerning the former
[50:44] conversation the former way of life the
[50:47] old man
[50:48] the old sinful nature which is corrupt
[50:52] the word there's actually rotten
[50:55] according to the deceitful lusts the
[50:58] deceptive desires the way the serpent
[51:02] appealed to Eve
[51:04] Paul goes on be renewed in the spirit of
[51:08] your mind
[51:09] made new in your thoughts and attitudes
[51:13] and that she put on
[51:16] clothe yourselves with
[51:18] step into the new man The Godly nature
[51:23] which after God which like God is
[51:25] created in righteousness
[51:28] and true holiness
[51:31] let's look at that verse 24 and uh and
[51:34] the NIV and in the Amplified Bible and
[51:37] to put on the new self
[51:39] created to be like God in true
[51:42] righteousness
[51:44] and holiness
[51:46] put on the new nature
[51:48] the regenerated self created in God's
[51:51] image god-like and true righteousness
[51:55] and holiness
[51:57] to all three translations tell us it by
[52:00] putting on the new man being dead to
[52:03] self
[52:03] we are to become god-like in His image
[52:08] so was the Serpent's appeal wrong
[52:11] are we to become as gods
[52:16] well we're created in the image of god
[52:18] let's look at some some commonalities of
[52:22] these two Natures of God's nature in
[52:24] man's nature we're created in His image
[52:27] we have similarities like like God we're
[52:29] spiritual
[52:31] we have potentially Everlasting Souls
[52:34] we see this in both the Old and New
[52:36] Testament in the Bible let's look at
[52:38] Daniel 12 for example Daniel says and
[52:42] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[52:45] the Earth
[52:46] shall awake
[52:48] some to everlasting life
[52:51] some to shame an everlasting contempt
[52:55] we see that a portion of humanity will
[52:58] have eternal life
[53:00] and therefore they already have it if
[53:02] it's Eternal that's why I said we are
[53:04] potentially like God in this regard
[53:07] sadly
[53:08] not everyone will receive this benefit
[53:10] of faith
[53:12] Jesus said in John 5 verily verily I say
[53:16] unto you
[53:18] he that hears my word
[53:20] and believes on him that sent me
[53:23] has
[53:24] present tense
[53:26] already has everlasting life
[53:29] and shall not come into it speaking of
[53:32] the future and not come into
[53:34] condemnation
[53:36] but is
[53:37] present tense is already passed from
[53:40] Death where he once was unto life
[53:44] which he now possesses
[53:47] so here Jesus is clarifying who they are
[53:50] that will have life Everlasting
[53:52] those that believe in God through Christ
[53:55] thus if we're in Christ we possess life
[53:59] Everlasting
[54:01] eternal life
[54:02] the life of the life in God
[54:06] now
[54:08] today
[54:10] tomorrow
[54:12] ever
[54:13] life
[54:20] a second characteristic we share with
[54:22] God
[54:23] we have Minds
[54:25] we think
[54:27] and we reason
[54:28] again from both old and new and Isaiah 1
[54:31] God is making a case against the
[54:34] wickedness of Judah
[54:36] but he holds out hope to the surviving
[54:39] Remnant we read in verse 17 learn to do
[54:42] well
[54:44] judgment
[54:45] relieve the oppressed
[54:47] judge the fatherless
[54:51] for the Widow
[54:53] come now
[54:55] and let us reason together
[54:58] saith the Lord
[55:00] though your sins be a Scarlet
[55:03] they'll be white as snow
[55:05] though there'd be red like Crimson they
[55:07] shall be as wool
[55:09] to reason together is to discuss to
[55:12] share
[55:13] to learn we see God's willing to meet
[55:16] with us on this level
[55:18] to reason with us
[55:21] to answer our questions
[55:24] and there's a benefit to us if we do
[55:26] this
[55:27] in Philippians chapter 2 Paul tells us
[55:30] let this mind be in you
[55:33] which was also in Christ Jesus
[55:38] who being in the form of God thought of
[55:40] not robbery to be equal with God because
[55:42] we know he was God but made himself of
[55:46] no reputation
[55:48] and took upon him the form of a servant
[55:51] and was made and the likeness of men
[55:53] Paul's not saying we should exalt
[55:55] ourselves to be equal with God
[55:57] we know Jesus was God himself veiled in
[56:00] human flesh
[56:02] rather Paul's saying if we have the mind
[56:04] of Christ
[56:06] will humble ourselves
[56:08] and serve one another
[56:11] in our day we're taught the greatest
[56:13] battle we'll fight will be the internal
[56:15] struggle
[56:17] right here within our mind
[56:20] faith
[56:21] that Sixth Sense fighting with what we
[56:25] experience in the physical world through
[56:27] our five natural senses filtered through
[56:29] our internal processes of Reason emotion
[56:32] imagination and so forth
[56:35] Eve's battle submitting to God's
[56:37] Authority versus becoming independent of
[56:40] that Authority
[56:42] continuing our short list we saw the
[56:45] potential of eternal life
[56:47] of a mind that can reason
[56:50] moving on a third attribute that we
[56:53] share with the Divine is that we're
[56:55] relational
[56:56] we give and receive love
[57:00] from the Old Testament let's look first
[57:03] at examples of God's love to his people
[57:05] from David we read in Psalm 36 verse 7.
[57:10] how excellent is thy loving kindness oh
[57:14] God
[57:15] therefore the children of men put their
[57:18] trust under the shadow of thy wings
[57:22] we see the love of God
[57:25] coupled with his kindness
[57:27] and our response to that combination is
[57:30] Trust
[57:31] faith
[57:33] in Jeremiah 31 we read verse 2.
[57:37] thus saith the Lord
[57:39] the people which were left of the sword
[57:41] found Grace in the wilderness even
[57:45] Israel when I went to cause him to rest
[57:49] the Lord hath appeared of old to me
[57:52] saying yay I have loved thee with an
[57:57] everlasting love
[58:00] therefore with loving kindness
[58:03] have I drawn thee
[58:05] at the period of old in other words this
[58:09] is a consistently displayed attribute of
[58:12] God towards his people
[58:14] and In this passage we see that his love
[58:17] to us
[58:18] is Everlasting
[58:20] it's an ending we can depend on it being
[58:24] there always it's not fickle it's not of
[58:29] the moment
[58:31] similarly
[58:32] the people's love towards God
[58:35] this time from Moses the basic tenet of
[58:39] Judaism it's called the Shema
[58:42] in Hebrew it's an imperative it's a
[58:45] command it says listen
[58:47] give ear
[58:49] understand
[58:51] pay attention
[58:55] here o Israel
[58:58] the Lord our God
[59:00] is one Lord
[59:02] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[59:05] with all thine heart and her most being
[59:09] with all thy Soul the nephesh the life
[59:13] and with all thy might
[59:15] vehemently
[59:18] notice something here
[59:21] the first verse the command to Israel
[59:24] the nation
[59:26] collectively is to pay attention
[59:28] recognize the Lord our God is one our
[59:31] God
[59:33] recognition of him as a nation
[59:35] and as a people but the next verse
[59:39] is to each individual in that nation in
[59:44] our case each member of the body of
[59:47] Christ
[59:48] that group of the chosen that called out
[59:50] and and and the King James English
[59:53] Dakota Jacobian prose the language of
[59:56] the court of James 400 years ago the
[59:59] word you or ye is a plural it's a second
[1:00:02] person plural but thee thy thine is the
[1:00:05] second person singular
[1:00:09] so while the nation is collectively
[1:00:11] called on to recognize the Oneness the
[1:00:14] unity of God himself each individual
[1:00:19] is called on to love the Lord
[1:00:21] with the heart
[1:00:24] soul
[1:00:25] and strength
[1:00:27] Jesus quoted this in in Mark 12 we read
[1:00:30] in verse 28 one of the scribes came in
[1:00:33] Matthew 27 we understand he was a lawyer
[1:00:37] so okay brother Peter lawyers are good
[1:00:39] people
[1:00:40] and having heard them
[1:00:42] Jesus in a group of Sadducees reasoning
[1:00:46] together and perceiving that Jesus had
[1:00:49] answered them well he asked Jesus which
[1:00:51] is the first commandment of all which is
[1:00:53] the top which is the most important
[1:00:56] and Jesus answered him
[1:01:00] with that fundamental tenet of Judaism
[1:01:02] with the Shema he said the first of all
[1:01:05] the Commandments is here o Israel the
[1:01:08] Lord our God
[1:01:10] is one Lord
[1:01:13] and it continues Thou shalt love the
[1:01:16] Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:01:19] with all thy soul
[1:01:21] and he adds
[1:01:23] with all thy mind
[1:01:25] and with all thy strength this is the
[1:01:28] first commandment Jesus added with all
[1:01:30] thy mind as he was conversing with the
[1:01:32] Scribe who echoeded back to him and said
[1:01:34] yes Lord with all the understanding
[1:01:39] so this isn't just rote memorization oh
[1:01:43] I've got to recite Deuteronomy 6 4 5. no
[1:01:47] no it's not memorization or words to
[1:01:50] recite it it's not like children in a
[1:01:52] classroom that that might stand as
[1:01:55] they're very little and don't really
[1:01:56] understand what they're saying and put
[1:01:58] their hand over their heart and say I
[1:01:59] pledge allegiance to the flag of the
[1:02:01] United States of America and to the
[1:02:04] Republic for which it stands one nation
[1:02:06] under God indivisible with liberty and
[1:02:10] justice for all teacher it's recess time
[1:02:12] can we go out and play
[1:02:15] no no
[1:02:16] but it's like those of us who have
[1:02:19] served in the military
[1:02:20] making a pledge and putting our lives on
[1:02:23] the line
[1:02:24] our bodies In Harm's Way
[1:02:26] to defend and protect the nation our
[1:02:29] homes and families our values
[1:02:32] with understanding
[1:02:34] of the potential cost
[1:02:38] with all my mind
[1:02:40] means to understand
[1:02:42] to grasp
[1:02:43] and to mean it
[1:02:45] to truly and completely love the Lord
[1:02:51] now I'm sure it's clear to each of us
[1:02:53] our love towards God isn't some
[1:02:56] arbitrary burden you better love me or
[1:02:58] else
[1:02:59] it's a correct response
[1:03:02] to his love for us
[1:03:05] the command in Deuteronomy was issued
[1:03:08] after God through Moses had rescued the
[1:03:11] nation from slavery
[1:03:14] bondage in Egypt he destroyed Pharaoh's
[1:03:18] Army Before Their Eyes Moses lift up
[1:03:21] your stick and destroy the army of the
[1:03:24] superpower
[1:03:26] he provided he guided them
[1:03:28] supernaturally through a lifeless
[1:03:31] Wilderness if you've ever seen a place
[1:03:33] like the Sinai
[1:03:34] they're nothing there but gray rock
[1:03:36] there's not even dead things providing
[1:03:39] food when there was no food
[1:03:41] water
[1:03:45] in the New Testament we have many
[1:03:47] examples of Love relating to God and to
[1:03:51] each other
[1:03:52] here's a very familiar section of the
[1:03:55] Gospel of John Jesus is communing with
[1:03:58] Nicodemus one evening a Pharisee from
[1:04:01] the Sanhedrin notice that these aren't
[1:04:03] the words of John the narrator
[1:04:06] the words of Jesus
[1:04:08] they're in red letters
[1:04:12] Jesus
[1:04:13] is telling Nicodemus
[1:04:16] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:04:19] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:04:22] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:04:24] have everlasting life for God sent not
[1:04:27] his son to the world to condemn the
[1:04:28] world
[1:04:29] but that the world through him might be
[1:04:31] saved
[1:04:32] now this is how John has recorded these
[1:04:34] words for us I think in context with
[1:04:36] Nicodemus it might have gone a little
[1:04:38] bit like this Nicodemus
[1:04:42] take it deepest God loves you so much
[1:04:45] he prepared and sent me
[1:04:48] so you could have faith in him
[1:04:50] through me
[1:04:52] and my friend
[1:04:54] by that Faith you won't be destroyed
[1:04:57] indeed you'll possess life eternal
[1:05:00] Nicodemus God didn't send me to condemn
[1:05:04] you
[1:05:05] sent me to save you
[1:05:09] I wonder how Nicodemus looked back on
[1:05:11] that evening
[1:05:13] a one-on-one session
[1:05:15] with the very Messiah
[1:05:18] God and flesh
[1:05:21] we have the responsive love of his
[1:05:24] people back towards God again Jesus
[1:05:26] speaking to his disciples in John 13
[1:05:28] verse 34 he says
[1:05:31] a new commandment I give you that you
[1:05:34] love one another
[1:05:35] as I have loved you that ye also love
[1:05:38] one another
[1:05:39] by this shall all men know that you're
[1:05:41] my disciples if you have love one to
[1:05:43] another
[1:05:45] we look at this sometimes and say I
[1:05:47] wonder what he's really saying here
[1:05:50] loving each other isn't a new
[1:05:52] commandment
[1:05:54] love your neighbors yourself what's he
[1:05:56] what's new
[1:05:58] what's new is the degree
[1:06:02] as I have loved you
[1:06:05] you must love each
[1:06:10] this kind of love
[1:06:12] is the testimony to the world around you
[1:06:15] that your followers of me
[1:06:19] well let's see it in the Old Testament a
[1:06:21] familiar passage from Leviticus 19 Verse
[1:06:24] 18
[1:06:26] Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any
[1:06:29] grudge against the children of thy
[1:06:31] people
[1:06:32] but Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor is
[1:06:33] thyself I'm the Lord that's telling you
[1:06:36] this
[1:06:38] we're very familiar with this verse
[1:06:40] as it applies with the nation of the
[1:06:43] chosen
[1:06:45] bearing the grudge against the children
[1:06:47] of your people but a few verses later
[1:06:49] verses we don't often read it's expanded
[1:06:53] it's emphasized it becomes the basis for
[1:06:57] what we call the Golden Rule treat
[1:06:58] others as you wish to be treated
[1:07:00] it's not a pair of verses we often hear
[1:07:02] a reference but Leviticus 19 verses 33
[1:07:06] and 34.
[1:07:08] if a stranger
[1:07:11] not one of your own not one of Jacob's
[1:07:14] descendants a gentile sojourn with thee
[1:07:17] in your land you shall not Vex him you
[1:07:20] shall not oppress him
[1:07:22] don't give the home of this guy on the
[1:07:24] street corner a hard time
[1:07:27] but the stranger
[1:07:29] that dwelleth with you
[1:07:31] dicks around
[1:07:32] makes us home among you
[1:07:34] shall be unto you
[1:07:37] as one born among you
[1:07:39] and thou shalt love him
[1:07:42] as myself
[1:07:44] there's not one set of laws for the
[1:07:46] citizens in a different set of laws for
[1:07:48] people that aren't citizens which was
[1:07:50] quite A New Concept at that time
[1:07:53] but the same laws and attitudes are to
[1:07:55] apply to everyone
[1:07:57] and he tells them why
[1:08:01] For You Were Strangers in the land of
[1:08:03] Egypt remember how you were
[1:08:06] Outsiders mistreated pressed into
[1:08:10] slavery remember this don't treat others
[1:08:13] as you were treated but treat them as
[1:08:17] you wish to be treated
[1:08:18] and remember who is it this telling you
[1:08:21] to do this I am the Lord your God
[1:08:26] Jesus said as much to that scribe that
[1:08:29] we read about in Mark 12 go back to
[1:08:31] verse 30 when he's replying he says Thou
[1:08:33] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:08:35] heart with all thy soul with all thy
[1:08:38] mind with all thy strength
[1:08:40] this is the first commandment
[1:08:42] but Jesus went on
[1:08:44] he said the second is light the second
[1:08:46] is similar the second is the same in
[1:08:48] effect it's namely this Thou shalt Love
[1:08:51] Thy Neighbor
[1:08:53] as thyself
[1:08:55] there's none other commandment greater
[1:08:57] than these and Matthew's account in
[1:08:59] chapter 27 he has in verse 40. um these
[1:09:02] two Commandments hang all the law
[1:09:05] and the prophets
[1:09:07] and we know later when Jesus was asked
[1:09:09] well love your neighbor so who's my
[1:09:11] neighbor
[1:09:12] Jesus tells the parable
[1:09:14] of the Good Samaritan
[1:09:17] remember Samaritans were living under
[1:09:19] segregation
[1:09:20] they had nothing to do with the Jewish
[1:09:22] people
[1:09:23] and the Jewish people had nothing to do
[1:09:24] with them
[1:09:26] the woman at Jacob's Well
[1:09:28] challenged Jesus about this when he
[1:09:30] simply asked for a drink of water
[1:09:32] and she was not only a Samaritan but was
[1:09:36] an outcast among the Samaritans
[1:09:41] life
[1:09:42] intelligence
[1:09:44] relationship let's look at a fourth the
[1:09:47] last characteristic we'll look at
[1:09:49] or moral
[1:09:51] able to discern
[1:09:53] right from wrong
[1:09:55] an example of this is found in Solomon's
[1:09:57] Prayer to the Lord when he became king
[1:10:00] over Israel First Kings 3 verse 7.
[1:10:03] Solomon's praying
[1:10:06] he says and now
[1:10:09] oh Lord my God thou has made thy servant
[1:10:13] in other words he's talking about
[1:10:15] himself King instead of David my father
[1:10:18] in the place of my father
[1:10:21] but God I am but a little child
[1:10:24] I don't even know how to go out or come
[1:10:26] in
[1:10:29] Solomon's humbling himself he's the king
[1:10:31] he's humbling himself before God
[1:10:34] he said and thy servant is in the midst
[1:10:38] of thy people
[1:10:39] which thou has chosen a great people
[1:10:43] that cannot be numbered or counted for
[1:10:45] multitude give therefore
[1:10:48] thy servant
[1:10:49] an understanding heart
[1:10:52] to judge thy people
[1:10:54] that I may discern between good and bad
[1:10:58] for who's able to judge this thy so
[1:11:01] greater people
[1:11:03] this is a heavy response responsibility
[1:11:05] lord I can't do it
[1:11:07] enable me to carry it the way that only
[1:11:10] you can enable
[1:11:12] and we read the speech please the Lord
[1:11:16] that Solomon had asked
[1:11:18] this thing
[1:11:21] Solomon desired to rightly judge when
[1:11:24] judgment was required his prayer
[1:11:26] indicates that such discernment between
[1:11:28] right and wrong was possible
[1:11:31] that it was an attribute of God that God
[1:11:33] could bestow
[1:11:34] strengthened and Rich
[1:11:37] we know the result Solomon's wisdom his
[1:11:40] ability to judge and discern was
[1:11:42] unmatched in the ancient world
[1:11:45] in the New Testament example Paul wrote
[1:11:48] to the Hebrews now in this case he's
[1:11:50] scolding them
[1:11:51] for their lack of spiritual growth
[1:11:53] Hebrews 5 12.
[1:11:56] for when for the time you ought to be
[1:11:59] teachers
[1:12:01] you have need that one teach you again
[1:12:04] which be the first principles of the
[1:12:07] Oracles of God
[1:12:08] are become such as have need of milk and
[1:12:10] not of strong meat everyone
[1:12:13] that uses milk is unskillful in the word
[1:12:15] of righteousness he's a babe
[1:12:18] who's talking about nursing here they
[1:12:20] didn't have dairies and milk bottles and
[1:12:22] all the rest of that but strong meat
[1:12:26] belonged to them that are of full age
[1:12:29] mature
[1:12:30] even those who by reason of use
[1:12:34] have their senses exercised
[1:12:37] to discern both Good and Evil
[1:12:41] Paul indicates this sort of discernment
[1:12:45] comes with exercise
[1:12:47] I I don't know how many of you exercise
[1:12:50] regularly
[1:12:51] I don't know how many of you don't but
[1:12:54] uh but but I know that uh sometimes when
[1:12:57] you do that you make a mistake you slip
[1:12:59] you fall you pull a muscle you you
[1:13:01] dislocate something
[1:13:03] so if we're exercising in order to
[1:13:07] develop this discernment we're going to
[1:13:09] make mistakes
[1:13:11] which is yet another reason
[1:13:13] that we should be kind and forgiving to
[1:13:15] each other
[1:13:16] as we grow in Grace and Truth
[1:13:21] so let's take a look at these we have
[1:13:24] just some shared attributes that we sort
[1:13:26] of picked here that
[1:13:28] spiritual
[1:13:30] Everlasting Souls intellectual
[1:13:33] ability to think and reason relational
[1:13:38] we can give and receive love
[1:13:41] moral
[1:13:43] discern right from wrong
[1:13:46] we see we have attributes in the human
[1:13:48] character that mirror or at least
[1:13:50] resemble attributes of the Divine
[1:13:53] we were after all created in His image
[1:13:57] so we're back to the question
[1:14:01] was the statement made to even the
[1:14:03] garden correct
[1:14:05] are we to become gods
[1:14:09] I think there's a huge difference
[1:14:11] between the appeal of the serpent
[1:14:14] and the assertion of Paul
[1:14:17] once again
[1:14:19] from Ephesians 4 from the NIV to put on
[1:14:22] the new self
[1:14:24] created to be like God and true
[1:14:26] righteousness and holiness
[1:14:29] this verse tells us to be god-like and
[1:14:32] righteousness
[1:14:34] and holiness
[1:14:37] Paul's telling us to put on the new man
[1:14:39] is saying that we're to take on God's
[1:14:43] nature by submitting to his authority
[1:14:49] the enemy of our souls
[1:14:52] tempts us to take on God's Authority by
[1:14:55] rebelling against his nature
[1:14:58] complete opposites let me repeat that
[1:15:01] Paul in telling us to put on the new man
[1:15:04] is saying we're to take on God's nature
[1:15:07] by submitting to his authority
[1:15:12] Satan tempts us to take on to replace
[1:15:15] God's Authority in our lives by
[1:15:19] rebelling against his nature
[1:15:22] we're not called to be a God we are
[1:15:26] called to be Godly
[1:15:29] there's a huge difference
[1:15:31] David tells us in this Psalm Psalm 4 3
[1:15:34] we know that the Lord has set apart
[1:15:38] chosen selected him that is Godly for
[1:15:42] what
[1:15:44] for himself
[1:15:46] therefore David says the Lord will hear
[1:15:49] when I call unto him
[1:15:53] Paul tells Titus
[1:15:55] in verse 2
[1:15:57] I'm sorry chapter 2 verse 11.
[1:16:01] for the grace of God that bringeth
[1:16:03] salvation has appeared to all men
[1:16:09] that denying ungodliness and worldly
[1:16:13] lust taking off the old man
[1:16:16] we should live soberly righteously and
[1:16:20] godly that word means piously devoutly
[1:16:24] reverently in this present world
[1:16:29] here again we see we are to fight that
[1:16:32] portion of our nature which is ungodly
[1:16:35] Wicked not god-like that we should live
[1:16:39] a Godly life a life that reflects as
[1:16:43] brother Aaron told us this morning I
[1:16:46] know the sun somewhere because I See the
[1:16:48] Light reflecting off the moon we're to
[1:16:50] have a life that reflects
[1:16:52] the nature of God
[1:16:56] we sometimes sing a worship song
[1:16:58] to be like Jesus
[1:17:01] this is not claiming that we want to
[1:17:03] replace Jesus
[1:17:05] to become God and rule the universe
[1:17:07] That's what Satan wants to do
[1:17:10] it's saying we want to take it on Jesus
[1:17:12] nature
[1:17:13] to reflect his attributes in our lives
[1:17:18] Paul talks about this in Ephesians 5.
[1:17:22] he says be therefore followers other
[1:17:26] translations say imitators
[1:17:29] of God
[1:17:30] copy him follow his example is dear
[1:17:34] children imitate their father
[1:17:37] I'm sure that Asher imitates Amos quite
[1:17:39] a lot
[1:17:40] and walk in
[1:17:43] live a life filled with love
[1:17:46] as in the way that Christ also hath
[1:17:50] loved us and hath given himself for us
[1:17:53] an offering and a sacrifice to God for
[1:17:56] us so that it became a sweet smelling
[1:17:58] Savor of fragrance
[1:18:03] were to be imitators
[1:18:05] but not imitations
[1:18:08] allow me to explain
[1:18:10] an imitator is one who studies and
[1:18:13] mirrors someone else
[1:18:16] a disciple if you will we should mirror
[1:18:19] we should reflect Christ
[1:18:22] for example when I bake bread
[1:18:25] I try to imitate the work of the master
[1:18:27] Baker whose instructions I try to follow
[1:18:30] so my product will be as good as it can
[1:18:33] be
[1:18:34] I don't claim to be a good Baker of
[1:18:36] bread but I try to imitate
[1:18:39] someone who is I try to understand his
[1:18:42] methods and follow his lead
[1:18:45] I try to imitate not replace him
[1:18:50] we should be an imitator
[1:18:52] of Jesus
[1:18:54] but we are not to be imitation Jesus's
[1:18:57] an imitation to something artificial or
[1:19:00] fake an imposter
[1:19:03] 30 years ago
[1:19:05] I frequently traveled to Japan as part
[1:19:08] of my work
[1:19:09] while there I often need to go to a
[1:19:11] restaurant
[1:19:13] and the typical restaurants of Japan in
[1:19:15] the 1990s the windows face industry
[1:19:18] would have displays of delicious looking
[1:19:20] foods
[1:19:22] yum
[1:19:24] but they weren't Foods
[1:19:26] they were made of plastic
[1:19:28] they looked real
[1:19:30] but they lacked that sweet smelling
[1:19:33] saver
[1:19:34] they had no nutrition
[1:19:36] probably toxic
[1:19:38] imitation
[1:19:40] fake
[1:19:41] and no I never tried to taste one either
[1:19:46] the menus were often laminated with
[1:19:49] colorful pictures of various Foods
[1:19:52] nothing written in English
[1:19:54] to order I'd point to the picture that
[1:19:56] represented the food I wanted perhaps
[1:20:00] tempura or sushi no no tempura
[1:20:05] I wasn't indicating that I wanted to eat
[1:20:08] a photo of tempura nor did I want the
[1:20:11] plastic tempura that was in the window
[1:20:13] I wanted a real meal of what that image
[1:20:17] represented
[1:20:19] just as we
[1:20:21] should represent Christ
[1:20:24] not that anyone would want to be like me
[1:20:26] but that they would want to follow the
[1:20:28] Christ they see represented
[1:20:31] in me I'm just the picture in the menu
[1:20:35] illustrating Christ not the plastic
[1:20:38] display in the window pretending to be
[1:20:41] him
[1:20:43] let me tell you a story on myself
[1:20:49] excuse me
[1:20:53] in February 1972
[1:20:57] Heather and I traveled to New Zealand to
[1:21:00] attend the Willing wedding of Philip
[1:21:02] Searle that's Howard searle's next older
[1:21:04] brother you that know Howard that's been
[1:21:06] here
[1:21:07] Philip was marrying Margot Hill
[1:21:10] we spent several weeks in that beautiful
[1:21:12] country
[1:21:16] one time
[1:21:18] we were visiting with brother red Cyril
[1:21:21] that's Howard's dad a man that brother
[1:21:23] green called his pastor
[1:21:25] we were visiting with brother swirl in
[1:21:27] his home
[1:21:29] and he admonished me
[1:21:32] he said when you see a rose
[1:21:35] you want to step close to it okay
[1:21:38] inhale its fragrance
[1:21:41] but not all roses have a fragrance
[1:21:44] those that don't
[1:21:45] disappoint
[1:21:47] he said Heather's life had a fragrance
[1:21:52] but he looked at me and said brother
[1:21:53] Lyle
[1:21:54] yours has no perfume
[1:21:57] he was kindly but pointedly
[1:22:01] telling me that I was a poor example of
[1:22:03] a Christian
[1:22:05] if I was in that Japanese menu you
[1:22:07] should black out that picture
[1:22:10] he was right
[1:22:13] we had prayer together as I recall
[1:22:16] I pray things have improved in my life
[1:22:18] in that regard in the 50 years since
[1:22:21] that meeting
[1:22:22] that I have become an imitator
[1:22:25] and not an imitation
[1:22:29] uh
[1:22:30] I had more that I thought to share with
[1:22:32] you but I kept hitting a brick wall and
[1:22:35] I take that as the Lord telling me stop
[1:22:38] it's enough to digest and apply for one
[1:22:41] meeting
[1:22:42] so we'll close by reading a few more
[1:22:44] verses from Ephesians 5 if the musicians
[1:22:47] would kindly come
[1:22:51] he therefore followers of God as dear
[1:22:54] children walk in love as Christ hath
[1:22:57] also loved us and hath given himself for
[1:23:00] us an offering and a sacrifice to God
[1:23:02] for a sweet smelling Savor skipping down
[1:23:05] to verse 15.
[1:23:07] see then that you walk circumspectly
[1:23:10] examining things from all angles
[1:23:13] not as fools
[1:23:15] but is wise
[1:23:17] redeeming not wasting but profitably
[1:23:21] employing the time because the days are
[1:23:24] evil wherefore be ye not unwise but
[1:23:28] in other words be wise
[1:23:31] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:23:34] is
[1:23:35] be not drunk with wine wherein is excess
[1:23:38] but be filled with the spirit lose your
[1:23:41] self-control by being full of the Holy
[1:23:43] Spirit like those in the upper room on
[1:23:45] the day of Pentecost these are not full
[1:23:47] of new wine as you suppose
[1:23:50] but they were full of the spirit
[1:23:52] speaking to yourselves
[1:23:54] not bickering arguing accusing offending
[1:23:58] but speaking to yourselves in Psalms and
[1:24:02] hymns and spiritual songs singing and
[1:24:05] making melody in your heart
[1:24:07] to the Lord
[1:24:09] giving thanks from time to time
[1:24:13] giving thanks always for the pleasant
[1:24:16] things
[1:24:18] for all things unto God and the father
[1:24:21] and the name of the church
[1:24:23] and the name of the prophet
[1:24:25] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:30] here's a huff tough one a hard one
[1:24:32] submitting yourselves to one another
[1:24:36] and the fear of reverence toward
[1:24:39] God
[1:24:41] and so
[1:24:43] brother Aaron comes to closest service
[1:24:46] to conclude let's sing
[1:24:48] to be like Jesus to be imitators of
[1:24:52] Christ
[1:24:53] with understanding
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:24:59] to be like
[1:25:02] Jesus
[1:25:05] to be like
[1:25:08] Jesus
[1:25:11] on Earth
[1:25:14] long
[1:25:15] to be like him
[1:25:20] all through life's journey
[1:25:25] from Earth to Glory
[1:25:31] I only I
[1:25:35] asked
[1:25:37] to be like
[1:25:39] him
[1:25:42] to be like Jesus to
[1:25:47] be like
[1:25:58] to be like him
[1:26:03] all through life's journey
[1:26:08] from Earth to Glory
[1:26:14] I only hear
[1:26:19] to be life you'll stand with me let's
[1:26:22] sing it as a prayer
[1:26:24] to be like
[1:26:27] Jesus
[1:26:30] to be like Jesus
[1:26:35] on Earth I long
[1:26:40] to be like
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:45] all through life's journey
[1:26:50] from Earth
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:27:01] to be like him
[1:27:08] God bailed himself in flesh
[1:27:14] and he walked on this Earth
[1:27:18] and he gave
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:22] that body that wanted himself
[1:27:25] the same responsibility that he gave
[1:27:28] that gives us
[1:27:31] I believe to show us that it can be done
[1:27:38] you know sometimes in the Scripture it
[1:27:40] shows where Jesus got angry
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:44] he chased him out of the temple with a
[1:27:47] with a rope
[1:27:50] and and there were times that he got
[1:27:52] angry or got upset with his disciples
[1:27:57] because he wore flesh
[1:28:00] so he could understand that
[1:28:03] but in the greatest decision that ever
[1:28:05] came that he had to make was

[1:38:38] place
[1:38:40] and I can usually go and I just can go
[1:38:42] down the benches
[1:38:44] because a lot of you sit in the same
[1:38:46] places
[1:38:47] and I'll Call Your Name by bench

[1:39:13] and those that have lost loved ones and
[1:39:15] just go down and sometimes I get a long
[1:39:17] drive from one work spot to another and
[1:39:20] I'll use that time to pray
[1:39:22] I'll keep my eyes open when I pray just
[1:39:24] for the safety of everybody else
[1:39:27] but it's just something that we do
[1:39:29] because we are part of the family of God
[1:39:33] and God's family is bound together in
[1:39:36] that love and that bless that blessed
