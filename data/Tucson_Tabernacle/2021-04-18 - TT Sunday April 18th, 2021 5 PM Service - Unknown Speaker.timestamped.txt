[47:43] musicians
[47:44] appreciate that we
[47:48] there's a couple of scriptures we didn't
[47:50] read in
[47:51] in the order i kept looking at the time
[47:54] and kind of
[47:55] saying i want to be done by this time so
[47:59] and then this afternoon i just
[48:02] came to the back here and i was just
[48:05] talking to the lord and
[48:07] and he brought something to my
[48:09] remembrance to add to
[48:11] to today so let's just read
[48:15] it's uh isaiah 65
[48:18] 17 and then you may be seated after this
[48:23] isaiah 65 17.
[48:28] he says for behold i create a new
[48:31] earth and the former shall not be
[48:34] remembered
[48:36] nor come into mind amen you may be
[48:39] seated
[48:39] god bless you brother gnats good to see
[48:43] you
[48:44] you kept your word yesterday in the uh
[48:48] minister's meeting he said i'll come by
[48:50] and see you tomorrow evening so
[48:52] amen thank thank you brother in it
[48:56] i was talking to brother peter and
[48:58] something else from yesterday's
[49:00] ministers meeting i asked him brother
[49:02] peter have you ever heard of stone soup
[49:05] and he kind of said hmm not too sure so
[49:08] i said well let me tell you about stone
[49:09] soup
[49:10] how many know about stone soup all right
[49:13] a couple of people don't
[49:14] so the brother just used it in an
[49:17] illustration it was a
[49:19] man he was coming through town old town
[49:21] just walking down the dirt road and
[49:24] all he had was a stone and a pot
[49:28] and he was hungry so he got to the edge
[49:30] of the the town and he made a little
[49:32] fire
[49:32] set the stone on it the pot in there
[49:34] filled it up with water and put a stone
[49:36] in it and began to stir it
[49:40] and and here here's the key he looked
[49:43] like he was enjoying it
[49:45] okay he was getting there stirring it
[49:48] okay
[49:49] first person comes by and just oh what
[49:51] are you doing he said
[49:52] i've got stone soup in there have you
[49:54] ever had any
[49:55] you ought to try it but you know what
[49:57] would really make it good
[49:58] is if you by chance had a carrot and you
[50:00] tossed it in there
[50:02] that'd really help it taste better so he
[50:05] had more
[50:05] folks that would come and buy it and
[50:07] each person that came by he asked them
[50:09] they'd ask what it is he goes well it's
[50:12] stone and carrot soup now
[50:14] but if you had some cabbage that would
[50:16] make it even better
[50:18] by the time it was all said and done it
[50:19] was a good vegetable soup
[50:23] and the brother used that he said come
[50:24] and bring your part
[50:26] and add your part today and we can enjoy
[50:29] this together so
[50:30] it reminded me of that today each one
[50:33] bringing their lick of fire
[50:34] each bringing their portion each
[50:37] bringing their amen and hallelujah
[50:39] it makes a good time together here so
[50:42] the other scripture
[50:46] was um brother
[50:49] jeremy the other one you told me i
[50:52] missed the heavens declare the glory of
[50:55] god
[50:57] and the firmament show his work
[50:59] handiwork
[51:00] you know the scripture before that we
[51:02] had just read was for behold i create a
[51:05] new heaven and a new earth
[51:07] and the former shall not be remembered
[51:09] nor come into mind
[51:11] but you know we look at that heaven
[51:15] that earth but what about this
[51:18] and having them create you allowing him
[51:22] to create a good atmosphere about you
[51:25] you inviting him you making yourself
[51:28] making him welcome you're saying here i
[51:30] am lord
[51:31] and he says the heavens declare the
[51:35] glory of god
[51:36] and the firmament show and i just want
[51:38] to say let
[51:39] this part of that also show the same
[51:42] of his handiwork so
[51:45] we were we had just finished there with
[51:48] um
[51:50] psalms 23 talking about the atmosphere
[51:54] that david
[51:55] created the lord is my shepherd
[51:58] i shall not want there goes that
[52:01] feeling of not having he maketh me to
[52:04] lie down there's that
[52:05] atmosphere of rest and he begins to
[52:08] create
[52:09] an atmosphere about him
[52:12] surely goodness though i walk through
[52:14] the valley i will fear no evil
[52:17] thy rod thy staff they comfort me he's
[52:19] creating a wonderful atmosphere about
[52:21] him
[52:22] so i was thinking about that and in
[52:25] prayer and i said lord you know
[52:27] just talking to him a little while this
[52:28] this afternoon
[52:30] and i appreciate that he's never busy
[52:34] i appreciate that he has
[52:37] everybody on the main line but he can
[52:39] talk to each individual
[52:41] he knows you by name he knows your
[52:42] situation
[52:44] he doesn't say who are you again that
[52:47] happened a few times yesterday
[52:49] god bless you brother aaron good to see
[52:50] how you doing i'm like god bless you
[52:52] brother but who are you again
[52:54] you know we have a tendency to forget
[52:56] and you know
[52:58] they were wearing the name tags and that
[52:59] helped a lot
[53:01] you know but he just reminded me
[53:04] something
[53:04] let's go to um luke
[53:09] chapter one we'll go from 26
[53:12] to 41. and i felt the lord
[53:15] impressed on this on me
[53:18] strongly about watch this atmosphere
[53:21] that was created
[53:23] so luke chapter 1 we'll start with verse
[53:26] 26.
[53:28] well known scripture
[53:31] luke started starts it and the birth of
[53:34] jesus christ was on this wise but
[53:39] let's go is here and on the sixth month
[53:42] the angel gabriel was sent from god unto
[53:45] a city
[53:46] of galilee named nazareth to a virgin
[53:49] espoused to a man whose name was joseph
[53:52] of the house of david and the virgin's
[53:54] name was
[53:55] mary and the angel came in unto her
[53:59] and said hail mary thou art highly
[54:02] favored
[54:03] the lord is with thee blessed art thou
[54:07] among women what a greeting
[54:11] what a greeting that he would speak to
[54:14] you
[54:14] that same way you are blessed
[54:18] among all that are on this earth
[54:21] i've been going through the the fifth
[54:25] seal now and there are paragraphs
[54:28] starting about
[54:30] 225 to about uh 280 or so brother
[54:34] branham is is really getting into israel
[54:38] those souls crying out from under the
[54:41] altar
[54:42] but there's a portion of grace
[54:46] that is so manifested there and he types
[54:49] it
[54:49] of course we know they see times it with
[54:51] joseph and his brethren
[54:54] and the blinding of their eyes
[54:57] so that you and i would have a chance
[55:01] brother branham says o see the grace
[55:04] of god undeserving
[55:08] nothing good should not even have been
[55:10] included
[55:12] that's right but he chose you and me and
[55:15] that so
[55:16] here he is he is working on
[55:19] that here he said thou art blessed earth
[55:22] among women and when she saw him she was
[55:25] troubled at this saying and cast in her
[55:28] mind
[55:29] what manner of salutation should this be
[55:34] maybe some scriptures maybe something
[55:37] maybe isaiah
[55:40] behold a virgin shall conceive clicked
[55:42] in the back of her head
[55:44] and something's going on could this be
[55:46] that
[55:48] but she's married she's human no it
[55:51] couldn't be me
[55:52] no who am i to deserve such a thing
[55:57] but watch and the angel said unto her
[56:00] fear not mary don't let
[56:04] that become the atmosphere you create
[56:06] fear
[56:09] she says he tells her fear not for thou
[56:12] has found favor with god
[56:16] why mary because god she found favor
[56:19] with god
[56:20] put your name in there because i have
[56:22] found favor with god
[56:25] he knows me by name he
[56:28] calls me and i answer because he loves
[56:32] me
[56:32] because of his grace let's go on here
[56:37] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[56:39] womb and bring forth
[56:41] a son and shall call his name
[56:44] jesus again maybe mary's mind goes back
[56:48] to
[56:48] emmanuel god with us
[56:52] i don't think he chose mary because she
[56:55] had no idea what was going on
[56:58] mary because she there was something in
[57:00] her
[57:01] that would respond okay
[57:05] he shall be great and shall be called
[57:07] the son of the highest and the lord
[57:09] shall give him
[57:10] give unto him the throne of his father
[57:13] david
[57:14] and he shall reign over the house of
[57:16] jacob forever
[57:18] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[57:21] it's an eternal kingdom mary
[57:26] lord i want to get into that kingdom
[57:29] i want to be part of that eternal
[57:31] kingdom
[57:33] just uh the last couple of days
[57:36] in in in england was it prince philip
[57:40] that passed away
[57:41] almost 100 years old you saw you see the
[57:45] change
[57:46] in the natural kingdom but in this one
[57:49] it's a eternal kingdom with
[57:52] no end you know everybody's wondering
[57:56] well who's going to take his place who's
[57:57] going to become this
[57:58] who's going to have this but god's word
[58:01] tells us
[58:02] we will abide with him forever and ever
[58:05] we will be part of him
[58:06] we there's no end to that kingdom but
[58:09] here it is he says
[58:11] let's go on to the next verse then
[58:14] said mary unto the angel how shall this
[58:17] be
[58:18] seen i know not a man angel
[58:22] mary is still looking at it and she's
[58:23] saying wait a minute
[58:26] you're giving out a promise but
[58:29] everything i know it has to be done
[58:31] this way this is all we've ever known
[58:34] and the angel answered her and said oh
[58:36] mary you disbelieving unbeliever
[58:40] no he didn't he said the holy ghost
[58:42] shall
[58:43] come come upon thee and the power of the
[58:46] highest shall
[58:47] overshadow thee therefore all also that
[58:51] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[58:54] shall be called the son of god
[58:58] tell me what did the work the holy ghost
[59:03] it takes the holy spirit to get into
[59:07] the right atmosphere but there was a
[59:10] still a part
[59:11] mary had to play and behold thy cousin
[59:15] elizabeth
[59:16] she has also conceived a son in her old
[59:18] age
[59:19] and this is the sixth month with her who
[59:22] was called
[59:23] barren and then he explains to mary for
[59:25] with god
[59:26] nothing shall be impossible
[59:30] so he's now telling mary i'm going to
[59:32] show you something mary
[59:34] i'm going to prove to you everything
[59:36] that i'm i'm not going to leave you
[59:37] hanging there mary
[59:38] you're going to know this is true
[59:42] so mary when she hears it she says
[59:45] behold
[59:46] the handmaid of the lord be it
[59:49] unto me according to thy word
[59:54] there's the key to creating to allowing
[59:57] that
[59:58] behold thy servant behold thy handmaid
[1:00:02] be it unto me according to your word
[1:00:06] lord i just don't know i'm not worthy
[1:00:10] i'm not good enough how could it be i've
[1:00:13] done this mary didn't stop there she
[1:00:15] said
[1:00:16] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:00:20] and then the angel departed from her
[1:00:23] and mary arose in those days she
[1:00:26] remembered what the angel said
[1:00:28] behold thy cousin elizabeth and went
[1:00:31] into the hill country with haste
[1:00:34] into the city of judah well i'm going to
[1:00:37] go see my cousin elizabeth but i've got
[1:00:39] a couple other things to do we'll get
[1:00:40] there eventually
[1:00:42] no it says she made a beeline she went
[1:00:44] straight
[1:00:46] and entered into the house of zacharias
[1:00:48] and saluted elizabeth and
[1:00:50] watch the atmosphere it had created
[1:00:54] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[1:00:57] heard the salutation of mary
[1:00:59] the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:01:01] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[1:01:04] what did peter and john do when they
[1:01:06] came down
[1:01:08] after the day of pentecost and they were
[1:01:11] on their way to the temple
[1:01:13] and they met the need they were first
[1:01:15] responders like we
[1:01:16] we said alms can you help me
[1:01:20] and immediately they turned and said
[1:01:21] we're going to the temple we're going to
[1:01:23] pray
[1:01:24] we'll come back later and we'll see what
[1:01:26] we can do with you no
[1:01:28] that kingdom was living in them already
[1:01:30] that
[1:01:31] atmosphere was bound they said hey look
[1:01:33] upon us
[1:01:35] such as i have i give unto you i don't
[1:01:38] have silver
[1:01:39] i don't have gold i don't have a medical
[1:01:41] degree i don't have this
[1:01:42] but such as i have in the name of the
[1:01:45] lord jesus christ
[1:01:46] rise up and walk that's
[1:01:50] what it creates that's but mary had to
[1:01:53] say
[1:01:54] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:01:58] if you haven't said that today's a good
[1:02:00] day to start
[1:02:05] so so we know that creating an
[1:02:07] atmosphere
[1:02:09] living in a good atmosphere um
[1:02:12] taking control of the atmosphere around
[1:02:14] you
[1:02:15] not letting another atmosphere control
[1:02:17] you sometimes you walk in
[1:02:19] out on the job site um
[1:02:23] you have two or three crews working a
[1:02:25] house and each one has their radio
[1:02:27] and it's blasting this one is playing
[1:02:29] mexican music this one's playing
[1:02:31] something else
[1:02:32] every once while i walk in and
[1:02:33] somebody's got a good christian radio
[1:02:35] going on
[1:02:36] sometimes there's even some preaching
[1:02:38] going on and man it's just
[1:02:39] just a whole lot easier to go work in
[1:02:41] there but most of the time it's just
[1:02:43] blasting music
[1:02:44] and it creates a hard atmosphere to work
[1:02:46] and me being spiritual and all and
[1:02:48] loving the
[1:02:49] the folks i say lord can you cause the
[1:02:51] rating to break right about now
[1:02:53] can we unplug the radio but you know i
[1:02:56] found that he's greater than that
[1:02:58] i began to think about him began to and
[1:03:01] pretty soon it
[1:03:02] you don't even notice it anymore or you
[1:03:04] can let it
[1:03:05] control you amen that's your choice
[1:03:07] there so
[1:03:09] so we're looking at that and he's in and
[1:03:12] and seeing an atmosphere created so so
[1:03:14] now the disciples
[1:03:18] the disciples have been with jesus for
[1:03:20] three and a half years
[1:03:23] and and i know there were some rough
[1:03:24] times there were some hard times
[1:03:27] jesus operated them jesus had to tell
[1:03:30] them jesus had do some things
[1:03:32] they didn't understand everything but
[1:03:34] they knew there was something different
[1:03:36] about this man
[1:03:38] when he come by and he called them by
[1:03:40] name knew who they were
[1:03:42] when he told peter castanet on the other
[1:03:45] side
[1:03:47] when he said to nathanael behold an
[1:03:49] israelite whom there is no guile
[1:03:51] what a difference in this man could this
[1:03:55] be
[1:03:55] the very messiah when he stands in front
[1:03:58] of the tomb and says
[1:03:59] lazarus come forth roll the stone away
[1:04:03] let him come out
[1:04:05] i am the resurrection and they're
[1:04:08] watching this happen
[1:04:12] but when he's coming to his death
[1:04:15] when he's coming to giving his life
[1:04:19] peter and all the other disciples said
[1:04:21] it said peter and the others said
[1:04:23] will go with you will not deny you
[1:04:28] if you read the scripture says all of
[1:04:29] them said the same
[1:04:32] but when it came down to that where were
[1:04:34] they jesus looks at peter and he says
[1:04:37] peter
[1:04:37] you're going to deny me three times
[1:04:43] he did and to take to stop
[1:04:46] for a minute what was the atmosphere
[1:04:49] like brother lyle covered that pretty
[1:04:50] good the other night
[1:04:52] the atmosphere of fear of wondering
[1:04:55] of questioning peter said let's go back
[1:04:58] to
[1:04:58] fishing like we used to be let's just go
[1:05:01] back
[1:05:02] what we used to know we know that pretty
[1:05:06] good
[1:05:08] but on the day of pentecost
[1:05:11] here's the key acts two one through four
[1:05:18] a change of an atmosphere not only the
[1:05:22] atmosphere around them
[1:05:23] but the atmosphere in them and when the
[1:05:26] day of pentecost was fully come
[1:05:29] they were all with one accord in one
[1:05:31] place
[1:05:32] okay it took some time approximately 10
[1:05:36] days
[1:05:37] to get in one accord in one place
[1:05:42] and it can take it's some work
[1:05:46] it's some humbling of self it's some
[1:05:48] saying not my will
[1:05:50] but thy will be done i'm willing to let
[1:05:52] this go
[1:05:53] i'm willing to sacrifice myself
[1:05:56] for the blessing on others coming down
[1:05:59] to that place
[1:06:01] the very master who knelt down at their
[1:06:03] feet and washed their feet
[1:06:05] coming down to that place coming over to
[1:06:08] one another in there and say you know
[1:06:10] philip or you know whoever
[1:06:13] the different disciples you remember
[1:06:15] when this happened and that happened
[1:06:17] and i i i kind of got upset with you i'm
[1:06:19] sorry
[1:06:20] would you forgive me creating an
[1:06:23] atmosphere and coming into
[1:06:24] one accord yes well the holy spirit
[1:06:27] would be able to come in
[1:06:29] and pour itself in one accord in one
[1:06:32] place
[1:06:32] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:06:34] heaven as
[1:06:35] of a rushing mighty wind and it filled
[1:06:38] the house where they were sitting
[1:06:41] and there appeared unto them cloven
[1:06:43] tongues
[1:06:44] as a fire and it sat upon each of them
[1:06:47] and they were
[1:06:48] filled with the holy ghost and began to
[1:06:50] speak with other tongues
[1:06:51] as a spirit gave them utterance
[1:06:55] to each individual
[1:06:59] peter didn't stand up and say when he
[1:07:01] began to speak and said now the holy
[1:07:03] ghost came upon me
[1:07:05] therefore i'm the leader of this group
[1:07:07] and you have to do what i
[1:07:09] say it was to each individual
[1:07:13] brother branham tells us the coals of
[1:07:15] fire
[1:07:16] each one being a coal of fire and and
[1:07:19] and getting together
[1:07:20] and creating a great warmth a great fire
[1:07:25] where when they get out as individuals
[1:07:28] you begin to get cold
[1:07:30] you begin to lose that heat around you
[1:07:32] but when you draw an eye to one another
[1:07:34] and you create a good atmosphere the
[1:07:37] holy spirit can move
[1:07:39] the holy spirit can begin to deal the
[1:07:41] holy spirit can talk to you as
[1:07:43] individuals
[1:07:45] because he does he does
[1:07:48] you know it's somebody says well i
[1:07:50] really enjoyed when the brother
[1:07:52] ministered this
[1:07:53] it spoke to my heart and somebody else
[1:07:55] has and when he said this part over here
[1:07:57] it spoke to my heart
[1:07:58] and somebody else said i i just didn't
[1:08:01] seem to catch it until the very end he
[1:08:03] said this
[1:08:03] and oh my that did bless me everybody
[1:08:07] got that portion they needed and some of
[1:08:10] you are fortunate because you got the
[1:08:11] whole thing for you
[1:08:13] but that which you need god provides
[1:08:17] amen they were filled with
[1:08:20] the holy ghost and boy did the
[1:08:23] atmosphere change after that
[1:08:26] those disciples
[1:08:29] who were who were afraid who were
[1:08:34] hiding who who said i don't know him
[1:08:37] even cursed
[1:08:38] who ran away who didn't believe the
[1:08:41] sisters when they told him
[1:08:43] he has risen we have seen him now
[1:08:45] they're out there and they're saying let
[1:08:47] us get out and get this gospel
[1:08:48] this living god to everybody let
[1:08:52] us when when the when the the saddest
[1:08:54] pharisees
[1:08:55] the them took them and beat them and
[1:08:57] striped them and said do not preach in
[1:08:59] his name
[1:09:00] and they turn around said who should we
[1:09:01] listen to to man
[1:09:03] or to god when these disciples are
[1:09:07] are being crucified when they're being
[1:09:09] they're ending their life
[1:09:10] they're saying crucify me upside down i
[1:09:12] don't even deserve to be crucified like
[1:09:14] my lord
[1:09:15] look at the change that came in upon him
[1:09:19] filled
[1:09:20] with the holy ghost but still men and
[1:09:23] women
[1:09:25] it did not make them angels
[1:09:28] it gave them overcoming power in this
[1:09:31] life
[1:09:32] and this and that's what we need because
[1:09:35] this is a life we have to bear
[1:09:37] you know peter and
[1:09:41] paul has to come in and correct peter
[1:09:45] when paul comes in and he says peter why
[1:09:47] are you acting like that
[1:09:49] over here you were with the gentiles on
[1:09:51] this but now they come
[1:09:52] you run over here with the jews and he
[1:09:54] and he calls him out on that
[1:09:57] paul and silas went together and mark
[1:09:59] and barnabas went together
[1:10:00] why because there was contention among
[1:10:02] them
[1:10:04] who's the greater lord hey
[1:10:08] we're human we are but the holy ghost
[1:10:11] in you that individual experience that
[1:10:15] infilling in your life
[1:10:18] is the overcoming power it's the one if
[1:10:20] you'll surrender quickly
[1:10:22] and let that atmosphere change talking
[1:10:26] with sister nadine words and i've shared
[1:10:29] this
[1:10:30] i did some work in her house one time
[1:10:33] and and i was there for two days and she
[1:10:36] just began to share her experiences
[1:10:40] with brother brown and you know that one
[1:10:43] of the the most common things you heard
[1:10:44] about brother branham was
[1:10:46] when he would walk in the humility and
[1:10:49] the sweetness of it
[1:10:50] just changed the whole atmosphere
[1:10:53] not walking in like i'm in charge of
[1:10:55] this you got no
[1:10:56] just a sweetness good evening friends
[1:11:01] called them all friends he didn't say
[1:11:04] for those of you who agree my message
[1:11:06] are my brothers the rest of you you're
[1:11:07] out
[1:11:08] he called them friends well she talked
[1:11:12] about him coming over
[1:11:14] because he would brother branham would
[1:11:17] drop brother joseph off there at the
[1:11:18] house
[1:11:20] sam him and brother bobby were good
[1:11:22] friends and she would care for
[1:11:24] and he said brother branham always had a
[1:11:26] kind word something nice to say
[1:11:28] something encouraging and when he left
[1:11:31] you felt like
[1:11:32] he made you important and he was not
[1:11:35] important
[1:11:37] he didn't come in and say well i'm the
[1:11:38] prophet of the god you owe me this honor
[1:11:40] me respect me this
[1:11:43] but sister nadine knew who he was so she
[1:11:46] did it anyways
[1:11:47] there's the key each one doing their
[1:11:50] part
[1:11:53] say not my will but thy will be done
[1:11:55] saying you first
[1:11:57] honor my brother honor my sister well
[1:11:59] while you're honoring your brother
[1:12:00] sister somebody's honoring you
[1:12:02] it's the body feeding itself
[1:12:05] you know sometimes and it's easy and i
[1:12:07] understand
[1:12:09] we have people we love people that mean
[1:12:11] a lot to us then
[1:12:12] and we honor them and there's nothing
[1:12:14] wrong with that
[1:12:16] but in god's side you're worth just as
[1:12:18] much as the next one next to you
[1:12:21] he gave his life fully and freely for
[1:12:23] you
[1:12:24] you say oh brother aaron i'm i'm no good
[1:12:27] look what i've done
[1:12:29] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:12:31] glory god that's right
[1:12:34] a little sin caused his death as much as
[1:12:36] a big sin caused his death
[1:12:38] the shedding of his blood the stripes on
[1:12:41] his back
[1:12:42] a cold and cancer both of them caused
[1:12:45] stripes on his back
[1:12:48] for everything sometimes you say well
[1:12:52] i'm not worthy that brother that sister
[1:12:54] she deserves better than me
[1:12:56] and that brother and that such are
[1:12:57] saying i'm not worthy i'm not worthy
[1:12:59] that one deserves more
[1:13:00] and better than me brother branham
[1:13:03] brother
[1:13:04] brother branham the lord jesus humbles
[1:13:07] himself and he kneels down before his
[1:13:08] disciples and washes
[1:13:10] their feet and says you call me master
[1:13:14] and lord and he goes i am
[1:13:17] but i've humbled myself willingly and
[1:13:20] washed
[1:13:21] your feet the work
[1:13:24] of the holy spirit in our lives
[1:13:28] because we can't do this without him as
[1:13:31] hard as we try
[1:13:32] we will fail somebody
[1:13:36] will get you just about that time when
[1:13:39] you think you got it made
[1:13:41] and they'll remind you you're human real
[1:13:43] quick
[1:13:45] and you come back and say lord have
[1:13:47] mercy on me i've done something wrong
[1:13:50] there was a brother who who used to
[1:13:52] attend to church in hell brother
[1:13:54] he's passed away brother paul noriega
[1:13:58] he felt that in the calling of his life
[1:14:01] was to pull on my ear i'd be sitting
[1:14:04] down like there where
[1:14:05] brother enoch is or something that
[1:14:07] brother paul would walk by and just
[1:14:09] reach over and do this to me all the
[1:14:11] time
[1:14:13] you ever heard of terms of endearment
[1:14:15] that was brother paul's to me
[1:14:18] first couple of times i got a little
[1:14:20] upset with him
[1:14:22] but i realized he was just saying hey
[1:14:24] brother good to see you
[1:14:25] a little different than some other
[1:14:27] people
[1:14:29] see how do you receive it how do you
[1:14:32] take
[1:14:34] you could be offended you could be heard
[1:14:35] you could say hey brother paul noticed
[1:14:37] me
[1:14:37] thank the lord for that we did that
[1:14:41] i change the atmosphere real quick for
[1:14:42] myself
[1:14:44] sometimes simple things really help us
[1:14:47] you know but to see it's god's great
[1:14:51] mercy
[1:14:54] so let's look at a couple of quotes here
[1:14:57] that we didn't get to
[1:14:58] let's
[1:15:02] the first quote there from divine love
[1:15:08] we've heard brother branham preach us
[1:15:10] quite a bit quite a few messages about
[1:15:12] that
[1:15:13] love yeah and the bull we know that he
[1:15:17] was crossing that that field
[1:15:20] and and he goes the bull came to me just
[1:15:22] just as hard as he could
[1:15:25] no fear i wasn't a bit more afraid than
[1:15:28] i would be a brother neville sitting
[1:15:30] right here
[1:15:32] just a pure holy love in my heart what
[1:15:35] did it do
[1:15:36] it created an atmosphere and that bull
[1:15:39] run right into that atmosphere
[1:15:42] it wasn't a barbed wire fence it wasn't
[1:15:45] a chain-link fence
[1:15:46] it was an atmosphere that had more power
[1:15:51] to stop a charging bull than a fence did
[1:15:56] it could take not only stop the bull but
[1:15:59] change it
[1:16:02] they could take somebody with a hard
[1:16:03] heart with a mean intention
[1:16:06] and they run into the atmosphere and
[1:16:08] they fall on their knees and say
[1:16:10] god forgive me save me help me
[1:16:14] that's that atmosphere it says
[1:16:18] not 10 from me before he stopped and
[1:16:21] throwed his feet out
[1:16:22] he looked right here so defeated with
[1:16:24] the most
[1:16:25] mech look on his face and turned around
[1:16:27] and walked over there and laid down
[1:16:29] and i passed within five feet what is it
[1:16:32] when divine love is projected sovereign
[1:16:35] grace takes over
[1:16:37] at that time you know
[1:16:40] to imagine that happen it takes
[1:16:45] god in a man
[1:16:49] as hard as you want to do it on your own
[1:16:53] i'm waiting for brother dan roberts to
[1:16:55] come after me and i'm going to love him
[1:16:56] so hard he's going to stop
[1:16:58] it doesn't work that way
[1:17:01] unless me and brother dan plan it
[1:17:03] brother dan come at me and then fall at
[1:17:05] my feet please so the people will be
[1:17:07] impressed
[1:17:08] well you'll see through that fallacy
[1:17:10] right away but when there's a
[1:17:12] true love of god presence of god
[1:17:16] about brother brandon would say don't
[1:17:18] fear it don't fear it don't be afraid of
[1:17:20] it
[1:17:20] it's him he's right here
[1:17:24] and people would enter into that
[1:17:25] presence and boy did it change
[1:17:28] things he says
[1:17:33] hebrews chapter 2
[1:17:36] blessed be that tie that binds our
[1:17:38] hearts with christian fellowship
[1:17:40] the love of god when he rose he wasn't
[1:17:44] finished yet
[1:17:45] he had some more work to do the bible
[1:17:47] said he ascended
[1:17:49] on high and gave give gifts unto men
[1:17:52] there was an atmosphere hung over the
[1:17:54] earth of darkness
[1:17:56] of gloom of death and weary
[1:17:59] the prayers couldn't come up be because
[1:18:02] the atonement wasn't made
[1:18:05] but he broke through that veil he opened
[1:18:08] up the way
[1:18:09] he broke the veil of sickness he broke
[1:18:12] the veil of sin
[1:18:13] he broke the veil of weary he broke the
[1:18:16] veil of depressed
[1:18:17] and broke every veil and made a highway
[1:18:20] for the wayfary men
[1:18:21] walking up the king's highway every one
[1:18:25] of those
[1:18:26] he broke that atmosphere so we could
[1:18:29] enter into
[1:18:30] his atmosphere and watch
[1:18:33] you can see yourself at times right
[1:18:34] there
[1:18:36] and said it's been it's been broken
[1:18:39] i can enter into the presence of god
[1:18:42] i can walk into the holy of holies and
[1:18:45] commune with him
[1:18:46] and hear back from him i can leave my
[1:18:49] rod there and come back in and it is
[1:18:51] bearing fruit
[1:18:53] because he's alive he's the same
[1:18:55] yesterday today and forever
[1:18:59] from souls that are in prison now
[1:19:03] oh our hearts beat high and of great
[1:19:06] anticipation
[1:19:07] waiting for that hour to arrive with
[1:19:09] that
[1:19:10] all fears vanish from us we have nothing
[1:19:13] to fear nothing to dread
[1:19:14] we look forward to the promise that the
[1:19:17] eternal god has made us
[1:19:18] and we know that it's truth that's why
[1:19:21] we live we
[1:19:22] live for that that hour that time when
[1:19:24] this mortal shall be changed
[1:19:26] and we shall be made like him and there
[1:19:28] will be no more sickness
[1:19:30] no more sorrow no more heartache oh
[1:19:33] it'll be all over then
[1:19:35] and with joy of heart we in faith
[1:19:38] and courage we look forward for
[1:19:42] that day
[1:19:45] the veil was rent in two
[1:19:49] therefore we had access back to him
[1:19:53] hebrews 11 6 tells us
[1:19:56] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:20:00] god
[1:20:02] so is his word true can you take a hold
[1:20:06] of him and say
[1:20:07] i'll lay my life on his word on his
[1:20:10] promise
[1:20:10] and i'll not back off of it though god
[1:20:13] slay me yet i'll trust him
[1:20:15] these skin worms though they enter my
[1:20:17] body
[1:20:18] yet these eyes shall behold and behold
[1:20:20] my redeemer liveth
[1:20:22] job crying out calling out before the
[1:20:25] holy ghost even come
[1:20:27] but seeing a living god working
[1:20:32] the testimony of a true witness
[1:20:36] let's go ahead and just this but without
[1:20:38] faith it is impossible to please him
[1:20:40] for he that cometh to god must believe
[1:20:42] that he is
[1:20:44] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:20:47] diligently seek him
[1:20:49] lord i need you right now but i've got a
[1:20:51] lot of things to take care of so can you
[1:20:53] just wait there for a bit
[1:20:56] lord it's sunday so i'm going to go
[1:21:00] seek you in church today but the rest of
[1:21:02] the week is my time
[1:21:04] oh brother and i never say that but what
[1:21:06] about what our actions say at times
[1:21:09] those that diligent seek them those that
[1:21:11] put the effort
[1:21:12] those that spend the time those that
[1:21:15] seek his face
[1:21:16] continually but not
[1:21:19] without believing that he is
[1:21:23] that he exists that he's everything he
[1:21:26] said he is
[1:21:27] that he keeps his word
[1:21:30] because if you can't believe that you
[1:21:32] can't draw night to you
[1:21:34] but if you can take him by faith and you
[1:21:36] seek him he is a rewarder
[1:21:39] he will give you the blessing he will
[1:21:41] give you the infilling
[1:21:42] he will fill your cup till it runeth
[1:21:44] over
[1:21:47] and the joy of the lord is your strength
[1:21:50] the testimony of a true witness
[1:21:57] for as i said at the beginning of the
[1:21:59] message father
[1:22:00] as the least lights go back to the root
[1:22:02] where it come from
[1:22:04] and wait for another season we know that
[1:22:06] we're nearing
[1:22:07] another season he says we feel the
[1:22:10] changing of
[1:22:11] the atmosphere the spiritual atmosphere
[1:22:15] the day is about to break and we'll wake
[1:22:18] in a great
[1:22:19] a great millennium for we we
[1:22:22] which are alive and remain shall not
[1:22:24] hinder them which
[1:22:25] are asleep for we say this by the
[1:22:28] commandment of the lord
[1:22:31] that the trumpet shall sound and the
[1:22:34] dead in christ shall rise and we shall
[1:22:36] be
[1:22:37] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:22:40] eye brother branham was speaking of that
[1:22:42] atmosphere back then how many times if
[1:22:46] you're reading through the message in 61
[1:22:48] 62 all the way up to 65
[1:22:49] especially where he says i just don't
[1:22:52] see anything else there is but the
[1:22:54] coming of the lord
[1:22:56] everything seems to be half fulfilled
[1:22:57] and that desire that draw that
[1:22:59] that pull even so come lord jesus
[1:23:04] the mighty conqueror
[1:23:09] there is so little spoke of this
[1:23:11] ascension it's one of the greatest days
[1:23:13] when he ascended up because all over the
[1:23:16] earth
[1:23:17] since the day in the garden of eden that
[1:23:19] sin was committed
[1:23:21] all heaven was shut off from mankind
[1:23:24] satan is the prince of the power there
[1:23:26] that's right
[1:23:27] why art thou fallen from heaven oh
[1:23:29] lucifer no man could see unto glory
[1:23:32] no man could understand because the
[1:23:34] power is just above it heaven means
[1:23:36] atmosphere
[1:23:38] and then all those powers were shut off
[1:23:40] from mankind
[1:23:42] because of sin but when he died
[1:23:47] and rose again and come up
[1:23:51] what happened then all of it
[1:23:55] was broke all of it was open when he
[1:23:58] rent
[1:23:58] the veil in twing it says
[1:24:02] we had access back to what adam and eve
[1:24:05] had
[1:24:07] you know i was listening to to this man
[1:24:10] and this kind of brought this thought
[1:24:12] i think it was brother robert figured oh
[1:24:14] that forwarded
[1:24:16] he's a kind of a scientist and a
[1:24:19] christian
[1:24:20] and he was taking time to disprove
[1:24:23] scripturally disprove um
[1:24:28] not i was going to say the creation
[1:24:29] evolution and showing
[1:24:32] in scripture and what they have shown
[1:24:35] how wrong it is
[1:24:37] when they built this and said look at
[1:24:39] what this was look what this was
[1:24:41] and they discovered that some of the
[1:24:43] bones don't even belong to human they
[1:24:45] belong to animals and
[1:24:46] but they won't back off from it he's
[1:24:48] selling and he's using scriptures
[1:24:51] he's also making you laugh he's a little
[1:24:53] bit a little funny
[1:24:54] but he's saying watch what god said here
[1:24:56] watch what the word of god says here
[1:24:58] watch what this says
[1:25:00] he says they have found these evidences
[1:25:04] in the earth they've discovered it
[1:25:08] they just can't say we're wrong there is
[1:25:11] a god
[1:25:12] up there so it kind of started this
[1:25:15] god creating an atmosphere in the garden
[1:25:18] of eden
[1:25:20] a place where he set his first creation
[1:25:24] adam and eve a place that was
[1:25:28] rest there was light there was peace
[1:25:31] now it says adam and eve kept the garden
[1:25:35] the alarm didn't go off at nine o'clock
[1:25:37] in the morning time to get up i will
[1:25:40] work till
[1:25:41] six and that's the end of the day no
[1:25:43] they went out and they dressed the
[1:25:44] garden they
[1:25:45] you know moved this the way brother
[1:25:47] branham explains it adam
[1:25:48] i need a little more shade over here
[1:25:50] well let's just take that tree and set
[1:25:51] it over here
[1:25:53] creative power they were sons and
[1:25:55] daughters of god
[1:25:57] going back to an atmosphere like that
[1:26:00] hard to believe sometimes
[1:26:02] but it's true get into the presence of
[1:26:05] god one time and you'll see how true it
[1:26:07] is
[1:26:09] what a great and mighty god he is
[1:26:12] how he delivers how he changes a heart
[1:26:16] how he takes a situation and turns it
[1:26:18] around completely
[1:26:19] when there was hatred and meanness and
[1:26:21] vileness
[1:26:22] when there was one who had taken the
[1:26:24] money as a tax collector
[1:26:27] and when he when god comes into his home
[1:26:29] and gets into his heart he said
[1:26:30] i will repay back up to four times
[1:26:34] that's a change that's not a man saying
[1:26:37] i'm going to do these deeds to be good
[1:26:39] that's a change of the heart of a man
[1:26:43] i think it was elizabeth that talked
[1:26:44] about that in sunday school class today
[1:26:46] and
[1:26:47] and the kids played out the skit and one
[1:26:50] of the boys got on his knees
[1:26:52] to play the part and literally repented
[1:26:54] on his knees in the class
[1:26:56] elizabeth said boy that just to see that
[1:26:58] the young man took it and made it real
[1:27:00] lord i'm sorry forgive me
[1:27:03] all when god gets into a person's heart
[1:27:06] and changes it
[1:27:08] it's not works anymore that's something
[1:27:10] that god does
[1:27:15] let's go to the scriptures back finish
[1:27:18] up with the scriptures now
[1:27:24] i think we finished off
[1:27:29] right after psalms 23
[1:27:33] and then acts 2.
[1:27:36] we'll go right after acts 2. he says but
[1:27:39] rather seek ye
[1:27:40] the kingdom of god and all these things
[1:27:43] shall be added unto you
[1:27:45] fear not little flock for it is the
[1:27:47] father's good pleasure
[1:27:49] to give to give you the kingdom
[1:27:52] sell what you have give alms
[1:27:56] provide yourselves bags which wax not
[1:27:58] old
[1:27:59] a treasure in the heavens that faileth
[1:28:01] not whether
[1:28:03] where no thief approaches neither does
[1:28:05] moth
[1:28:06] corrupt he's telling them seek the
[1:28:09] kingdom of god first
[1:28:11] look into that atmosphere because in
[1:28:14] that atmosphere
[1:28:15] everything is possible
[1:28:19] in the other atmosphere there's doubt
[1:28:22] there there's
[1:28:22] a hesitation there's wondering
[1:28:27] this day yes i can i can run through a
[1:28:29] troop and jump over all
[1:28:31] and tomorrow you're running the other
[1:28:32] way and hiding
[1:28:34] but you get into the kingdom of god and
[1:28:37] then you're like peter and john that
[1:28:38] says such as i have
[1:28:40] in the name of jesus christ i give it
[1:28:42] unto you
[1:28:46] let's continue on the scriptures there
[1:28:48] for we know
[1:28:50] that if our earthly house of this
[1:28:51] tabernacle were dissolved
[1:28:53] we have a building of god and house not
[1:28:55] made with hands
[1:28:57] eternal in the heavens for this we groan
[1:29:00] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[1:29:04] with our house which is from heaven
[1:29:08] lord and sometimes i find myself
[1:29:12] saying even so come quickly lord jesus
[1:29:17] but then i checked my attitude as why
[1:29:20] i'm saying that
[1:29:23] uh some bills are due some payments are
[1:29:26] owed
[1:29:27] some i got to go ask for forgiveness
[1:29:30] i've got to go repent
[1:29:32] i've got to go take care of something so
[1:29:35] i'm saying lord would you come right
[1:29:36] about now and then we won't have to deal
[1:29:38] with it
[1:29:39] but that's not the right attitude he
[1:29:42] says
[1:29:43] live on this earth as christians do
[1:29:46] that which is right live brother branham
[1:29:49] said
[1:29:50] like he's coming today
[1:29:54] plan like he's not coming for a hundred
[1:29:56] years but
[1:29:57] live like he's coming today
[1:30:01] ready if he should call you today you're
[1:30:04] ready to go
[1:30:05] if he should not call you for another
[1:30:07] 100 years you're still ready to go today
[1:30:10] but you have the spirit of god man
[1:30:13] living in you
[1:30:14] growing through you causing you allowing
[1:30:17] to you
[1:30:17] to live each day he says for we grow for
[1:30:21] this we groan
[1:30:22] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[1:30:25] with
[1:30:25] our house that body which is eternal
[1:30:29] it's our desire
[1:30:33] and then peter tells us this
[1:30:37] peter ii peter 3 13-14 nevertheless
[1:30:41] we according to his promise look for new
[1:30:44] heavens and a new earth
[1:30:46] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[1:30:49] beloved seeing that ye look
[1:30:51] for such things be diligent that ye may
[1:30:54] be found of him
[1:30:55] in peace without spot and blameless
[1:31:01] search me o god know my heart today
[1:31:04] lord i bow my heart before you i confess
[1:31:08] anything wrong cleanse it wash it
[1:31:12] i'm not going to be able to do this in
[1:31:14] self-righteousness i'm not going to be
[1:31:16] able to do this in my works
[1:31:18] but you said you would do it in me if i
[1:31:21] yield myself to you
[1:31:23] you know to see the different examples
[1:31:26] as we were talking about brother branham
[1:31:28] there and
[1:31:28] sister sister nadine she said there was
[1:31:32] just something about him
[1:31:35] that made you feel special made you feel
[1:31:38] wanted
[1:31:38] made you feel like you were important
[1:31:43] i owed a debt i could not pay and he
[1:31:46] paid a debt he did not owe
[1:31:49] i needed someone to wash my sins away
[1:31:54] i now can sing a brand new song amazing
[1:31:57] grace
[1:31:59] christ jesus paid a debt that i could
[1:32:02] never pay
[1:32:06] you know him that way today have you
[1:32:09] experienced that in your life
[1:32:11] he's forgiven you he's cleansed you he's
[1:32:13] washed you
[1:32:15] you stand before him in his
[1:32:17] righteousness
[1:32:18] and therefore you can enter into his
[1:32:20] presence
[1:32:21] in in a veil of white cleansed and
[1:32:24] washed brother branham talked about the
[1:32:27] time that he walked into that restaurant
[1:32:29] that little place he said and
[1:32:30] and he saw the sinful actions of those
[1:32:32] about and his heart just got
[1:32:34] he got angry got upset and i said god
[1:32:36] how can you stand this look at that
[1:32:38] filth
[1:32:41] and god takes them outside and just says
[1:32:43] let me show you something real quick
[1:32:45] here
[1:32:46] he said and brother bam sees the sin
[1:32:49] going up
[1:32:50] and hitting that blood barrier and
[1:32:52] bouncing off
[1:32:53] and brother branham said is this my sin
[1:32:57] and jesus tells him yes
[1:33:00] and boy did that change his attitude
[1:33:03] immediately
[1:33:05] he went back in and he said i need to
[1:33:07] offer them
[1:33:08] that same blood that same forgiveness
[1:33:11] that same
[1:33:12] opportunity that's a change of nature
[1:33:15] that's a change of atmosphere in just a
[1:33:18] few minutes
[1:33:20] somebody going back and said brother god
[1:33:23] is merciful
[1:33:25] god is good god is forgiving god is kind
[1:33:29] how do i know because he's done it for
[1:33:31] me
[1:33:33] can you recommend him to somebody else
[1:33:36] let me put this way does your life
[1:33:38] advertise him
[1:33:41] or is it only when you speak words
[1:33:46] or does all around you is there an
[1:33:47] atmosphere that brother braham says a
[1:33:49] christian
[1:33:50] carries about them and it affects
[1:33:53] others and they come up to you and say
[1:33:57] there's something different about you
[1:33:59] will you pray for me
[1:34:01] will you and they begin to ask they
[1:34:04] begin to draw
[1:34:06] from you life
[1:34:09] jesus tells his disciples as he's going
[1:34:11] they're going through
[1:34:12] towards samaria he says i must go
[1:34:15] this way you you boys go over there and
[1:34:17] get some food
[1:34:20] i'm gonna go see he didn't tell him this
[1:34:22] but he knew i'm gonna go see a woman at
[1:34:24] the well
[1:34:27] he also knew who she was and
[1:34:30] and and uh and her her uh
[1:34:33] what what this the description of her
[1:34:35] would have been if somebody told you who
[1:34:37] she was
[1:34:38] jesus don't you know about this woman
[1:34:41] she's had five husbands
[1:34:43] the one she's not with it's not even
[1:34:45] hers she has to be at the well at this
[1:34:47] time because
[1:34:48] she lives such a life and jesus said i
[1:34:51] know i gotta go talk to her
[1:34:54] i gotta go deal with her amen and she
[1:34:56] sits down and he goes now woman
[1:34:59] let me tell you how sinful you are no he
[1:35:02] opened the conversation
[1:35:04] woman draw give me a cup of water
[1:35:08] that's what she was doing she was
[1:35:09] drawing water she didn't say a woman
[1:35:11] start a fire make me
[1:35:12] make me something to eat he said draw me
[1:35:14] a cup of water and she looks at him and
[1:35:16] says you obviously don't know who i am
[1:35:18] because you wouldn't ask me you you
[1:35:20] would be seen with me right now and boy
[1:35:22] you would be labeled as a
[1:35:24] as you know somebody not to be around
[1:35:27] and he says no
[1:35:28] i'm here for a reason because if you
[1:35:31] knew who i was
[1:35:32] you would be asking me to draw water and
[1:35:35] give it to you
[1:35:37] that's right and if it's jesus in you
[1:35:41] isn't that water there also shouldn't it
[1:35:44] be able to be given to others
[1:35:46] shouldn't it be able to be shared such
[1:35:48] as i have i give unto you
[1:35:51] sometimes it's amen and sometimes it's
[1:35:53] only
[1:35:55] the musicians would come
[1:35:59] sometimes we have to sing search me oh
[1:36:01] god
[1:36:02] and know my heart today see if there be
[1:36:05] some wicked way in me
[1:36:08] sometimes it's praise and worship
[1:36:11] god accepts it and hears it all so
[1:36:16] maybe play that song search me oh god
[1:36:18] this powerhead
[1:36:21] lord we've ministered your word today as
[1:36:24] you gave it to us
[1:36:28] an atmosphere about us a presence about
[1:36:31] us
[1:36:34] you said your word is a lamp unto our
[1:36:36] feet
[1:36:37] it guides each step that we take
[1:36:40] lord we have a destination that we're
[1:36:42] headed for
[1:36:44] we have in our hearts something we're
[1:36:47] looking to
[1:36:47] lord let your word with your presence
[1:36:52] go for us lord and may we follow that
[1:36:54] way as our prayer lord
[1:36:57] see if there be something that we still
[1:36:59] have to make
[1:37:00] right see if there be something that we
[1:37:03] just need to
[1:37:04] make sure it's okay lord something that
[1:37:07] maybe it causes that
[1:37:08] presence to to just move off to one side
[1:37:13] search our hearts
[1:37:16] that allow you to lord to walk close to
[1:37:18] us as you drew up to those walking
[1:37:21] towards the mass you saw their hearts
[1:37:24] were heavy you saw their heads were down
[1:37:26] you overheard their conversation
[1:37:30] what it must have been like lord and you
[1:37:33] came to talk with them
[1:37:35] draw night to each one of us today we
[1:37:37] pray
[1:37:38] in jesus christ's name oh sir
[1:37:50] i know my heart
[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:10] know my thoughts
[1:38:14] i
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:38:28] somewhere
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:56] oh
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:05] revive all comes from
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:38] our
[1:39:41] thou wilt supply our
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:08] maybe while you're sitting there just
[1:40:10] about your hands close your eyes for a
[1:40:11] moment
[1:40:14] humble your heart before the lord just
[1:40:15] say lord is there something in me
[1:40:19] something that has caused that
[1:40:20] atmosphere to be a little disturbed
[1:40:24] brother branham says sometimes we can
[1:40:25] offend the holy spirit it'll just fly
[1:40:27] off to the side
[1:40:29] he won't leave you just waiting for you
[1:40:32] to say
[1:40:32] i'm sorry lord maybe something that god
[1:40:36] brings to your heart to your mind right
[1:40:38] now and say
[1:40:39] lord i'm sorry forgive me for that
[1:40:42] i want to do better than that maybe if
[1:40:46] we just bow our heads and we'll just
[1:40:47] talk to the lord about
[1:40:49] i don't know but you do i would look
[1:40:52] over my own heart right now and say lord
[1:40:54] i'm failing here i was wrong at that
[1:40:58] but you search even deeper then maybe
[1:41:01] show us something that is
[1:41:03] that's hindering us to allow you to have
[1:41:06] that full liberty lord
[1:41:08] and we would quickly say i'm sorry lord
[1:41:11] let's make it right let's ask for
[1:41:13] forgiveness
[1:41:15] therefore we can have the presence of
[1:41:17] the lord to be
[1:41:19] with us and be like david at that point
[1:41:22] as he said
[1:41:23] just a joy the joy of the lord is my
[1:41:26] strength
[1:41:27] the peace of god that covers us lord a
[1:41:30] sweetness in our life lord jesus
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:34] let it be because it's what you desire
[1:41:36] as you would come down in the cool of
[1:41:38] the evening and
[1:41:40] talk with abraham with adam and eve
[1:41:43] and say how is it today my children how
[1:41:45] was it today
[1:41:46] and just have a wonderful time lord may
[1:41:49] we come to that same place lord

[1:42:16] and i know that is
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:40] and i know that
[1:42:43] it's the presence of
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:43:16] and for these
[1:43:23] our blessings

[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:52] thank you lord

[1:45:01] and to be grateful for it and then the
[1:45:04] scripture tell us
[1:45:06] to be ready to give an account for that
[1:45:09] hope that lies within you
[1:45:10] to be able to share not only in the
[1:45:13] atmosphere but then taking and giving it
[1:45:15] in words
[1:45:16] you would like to have that atmosphere

[1:45:23] cleanse you he'll wash you
[1:45:25] he'll make you a new person amen

[1:45:31] school for this
[1:45:32] i didn't study for this i just
[1:45:34] surrendered to him
[1:45:35] and that's what he did for me how many

[1:45:52] sometimes the kids get a little
[1:45:56] like we were when we were kids probably
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:45:59] and sometimes the atmosphere changes
[1:46:01] quickly
[1:46:03] brother branham said as quick as you can
[1:46:06] just settle it down real quick and say
[1:46:09] okay

[1:46:13] right quick as you can say i'm sorry
[1:46:16] quick as you can say honey i love you i
[1:46:19] didn't mean that
[1:46:20] and watch the attitude change i i i
[1:46:23] think of this

[1:46:35] pie or something and she said i'm taking

[1:46:41] i remember writing
[1:46:42] frank he's like waiting for the sister
[1:46:44] to come back because she wanted
[1:46:46] he wanted to know what was the prophet
