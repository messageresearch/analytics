[23:32] if you fail come back to this tape again
[23:36] i don't know how much longer i'll be
[23:37] with you remember this is the truth of
[23:40] thus said the lord it's the truth it's a
[23:43] scripture
[23:45] like the seven
[23:47] mysteries of the seven last seals the
[23:50] mysteries of them the seals have done
[23:52] been broken every age had come down
[23:54] and there they left a lot of scattered
[23:56] and god not willing that it should be
[23:58] scattered he comes back and picks up
[24:00] those things those doctrines that
[24:01] started and brought it on out and
[24:03] revealed the whole thing
[24:05] same thing he's doing now in revealing
[24:07] the mystery of christ
[24:09] how he was god's threefold purpose for
[24:11] the church
[24:13] oh my let him not reveal reveal webster
[24:16] says is to make no one
[24:19] make noise and especially webster says
[24:21] in divine truth that revelation means
[24:25] revelation
[24:26] it is christ's way of making himself
[24:29] known to his church
[24:31] now we're going to say now brother
[24:32] braham you're just saying this no we
[24:34] won't say just say this
[24:35] i notice
[24:37] he made himself known to peter now if
[24:39] you want to mark this down and we if you
[24:41] want to read it we'll read it if you
[24:42] want to
[24:43] and
[24:44] um uh matthew 16
[24:47] 15 and 17
[24:49] are quoted
[24:50] when they come from the mount
[24:51] transfiguration
[24:53] he says who does man say i the son of
[24:55] man am
[24:57] some says oh they think you're elijah
[24:59] and some says you're one of the prophets
[25:01] jeremiah or some of them
[25:03] but that wasn't what he asked he said
[25:05] who do you think that i am now
[25:07] now there's a church he's talking to
[25:10] what does man think i am today he's a
[25:13] philosopher this social religion he's a
[25:16] good man
[25:17] we believe his teachings right it's a
[25:18] subject to be lived by i think it make
[25:20] us all better if we did we already have
[25:22] our churches or our so forth that's a
[25:25] santa claus like a santa claus story
[25:27] it's not expressions of some church that
[25:30] we should express some it's a life that
[25:32] you don't live yourself that he comes in
[25:34] you and lives by itself and you become a
[25:37] prisoner to any human intellectual being
[25:40] at all you're led by the spirit how do
[25:42] you know now you say i might know i was
[25:44] losing my mind maybe a mass loses his
[25:46] mind does that but if you have the mind
[25:48] of christ christ expresses himself
[25:50] through you
[25:51] shows that it's him and not you've not
[25:52] lost your mind
[25:56] some people under illusions of things
[25:58] goes out and becomes insane well that we
[26:00] know that's wrong that's the devil
[26:02] trying to impersonate the real thing
[26:03] before he gets here
[26:05] always the bogus
[26:07] but a real man is to lose his own
[26:10] thoughts and his own thinking not come
[26:11] up blindly
[26:13] like that no sir you come up with your
[26:15] right senses
[26:17] and christ takes you over and expresses
[26:19] itself and out to the world you're an
[26:21] insane person
[26:22] now if you're insane you're actually
[26:24] insane then there's nothing the devil
[26:25] can't take you in complete control he'll
[26:27] make you do everything contrary to this
[26:29] word but when christ takes you over
[26:31] he'll express that word right through
[26:32] because it's him he is the word
[26:35] and then you can see the expression of
[26:37] christ not some illusion of some sort
[26:39] but a real genuine christ expressing
[26:41] himself right through you
[26:43] how beautiful now watch
[26:46] he said who do you say i am he's asked
[26:48] in the church he's 12
[26:50] out of the millions of that day he asked
[26:52] 12 his church
[26:55] in the millions in the days of noah he
[26:58] asked eight
[27:01] amen and he said as it was in the days
[27:04] of noah so will it be in the coming of
[27:05] the son of man
[27:08] where eight souls were saved i don't say
[27:10] go be eight save now i don't get that
[27:12] all wrong i never said that i don't know
[27:14] how many people be saved and that that's
[27:16] the that last moment to to rapture that
[27:19] little group it'll be a small group i'll
[27:21] tell you that or straight is the gate
[27:22] and there is a wave a few there will be
[27:24] they'll find it
[27:26] but when the great ransom body through
[27:28] all ages comes up man that's going to be
[27:30] a great throne there revelation 7
[27:32] expresses great number which no man can
[27:34] number through all the ages has come up
[27:36] down it's walked in the light of the
[27:37] bible as far as it was revealed to them
[27:40] and now we know that wesley had more
[27:42] light than luther did we know a
[27:43] pentecost outshine wesley see certainly
[27:46] does because it just gradually let loose
[27:48] as it did down through the prophets and
[27:49] so forth it was perfectly made known to
[27:51] godhead bodily in christ and now the
[27:54] christ in the church is just being made
[27:56] known the whole thing is a revelation of
[27:57] god to take eve back to her right
[28:00] position again with her husband
[28:02] noticing god is the husband
[28:04] of the church and the church is his
[28:06] bride
[28:07] now
[28:08] peter
[28:09] when he calls said
[28:11] thou art the christ the son of the
[28:12] living god now watch blessed art thou
[28:15] simon bar jonah says which means son of
[28:17] jonah see
[28:19] blessed art thou
[28:20] for flesh and blood never reveal this to
[28:22] you
[28:25] you never learned it from some school
[28:29] but my father which is in heaven has
[28:32] revealed you
[28:34] notice what he said to him upon this
[28:37] rock
[28:39] that's peter the predestinated seed of
[28:43] god that will receive this light and
[28:45] give me the keys to the kingdom
[28:47] upon this rock of revelation
[28:51] of who jesus christ is
[28:54] he's a full manifested god
[28:57] upon this rock not a father son and holy
[29:00] ghost and him being the second person
[29:03] up on this rock i'll build my church
[29:07] and the gates of hell will never shake
[29:09] it down never prevail against me
[29:12] i'll build my church upon this a
[29:15] revelation of jesus christ
[29:18] look
[29:18] christ in you makes him the center of
[29:22] life
[29:23] of the revelation
[29:25] see
[29:26] christ's life in you makes him the
[29:30] center of the revelation amen
[29:33] christ in the bible makes the bible the
[29:35] complete revelation of christ
[29:37] christ in you makes you the complete
[29:39] revelation of the whole thing
[29:41] see what god's trying to do
[29:44] what is the new birth then you'd say
[29:45] brother brown what is new birth it is
[29:47] the revelation of jesus christ
[29:49] personally to you
[29:51] amen
[29:53] not you joined the church you shook a
[29:54] hand you done something different you
[29:56] set a creed you promised to live by a
[29:58] court of rules
[30:00] but christ
[30:02] the bible
[30:04] he is the word that was revealed to you
[30:08] and no matter what anybody says
[30:10] what takes place it's christ
[30:14] pastor priest whatever it might be it's
[30:16] christ in you that is
[30:19] a revelation that the church was built
[30:22] upon you say well i'm a lutheran i'm a
[30:24] baptist i'm presbyterian that don't mean
[30:27] don't mean that to god
[30:29] not a thing not a snap of your finger
[30:32] what is it it's christ
[30:34] being revealed
[30:35] and he is the word
[30:37] and when the word is revealed it
[30:39] expresses itself
[30:41] see that's god's purpose for jesus
[30:43] christ was to express himself
[30:46] to take his own laws and live by his
[30:48] laws con and fulfill his law by death
[30:54] christ god died in flesh
[30:57] in order to condemn
[30:59] uh sin in the flesh
[31:01] that he might bring to himself a
[31:03] glorious bride redeemed back that will
[31:06] believe only in the word of god and not
[31:08] swap it like eve did for intellectual
[31:10] conceptions of man
[31:12] amen sin
[31:14] that's christ's idea that's god's idea
[31:17] the new birth reveals this and if a man
[31:20] says he's born again
[31:22] and try to place these promises of
[31:24] christ in this last days to some other
[31:26] age making him christ gesture but not
[31:28] today
[31:30] then that man or that person
[31:33] has been in a delusion by satan
[31:36] and if that man says that he believes
[31:38] that and it doesn't manifest itself
[31:40] through him jesus said in mark 16 these
[31:42] signs shall follow them to believe and
[31:45] all the world's ever aged
[31:46] casting out devils and speaking with
[31:48] tongues and and all these great
[31:50] manifestations of gifts that would
[31:52] follow that they shout not they may be
[31:54] they ought to they will
[31:57] and heavens and earth will pass away but
[31:59] his word won't
[32:00] so it's christ expressing himself in the
[32:03] individual whether he's intellectual or
[32:05] whether he's he don't know his abcs half
[32:08] the apostles didn't know it
[32:10] but they know christ they never taken
[32:12] heed to peter and john knowing if they
[32:14] had been out of some seminary they said
[32:16] they'd taken he notices they've been
[32:18] with christ when they healed the lame
[32:19] man thing at the gate
[32:21] they know they had been with christ
[32:24] the new birth is christ
[32:26] is a revelation god has revealed to you
[32:30] this great mystery and that's a new
[32:32] birth
[32:33] now what are you going to do and get all
[32:34] that group together
[32:37] where the revelation is perfectly in
[32:38] harmony
[32:40] and god expressed it through his word by
[32:42] the same actions the same things that he
[32:44] did making the word manifest oh if the
[32:46] church only knew its position
[32:49] it will one day
[32:50] then the wrath shall go
[32:52] when it knows what it is
[32:54] now
[32:55] notice you say brother brandon but that
[32:57] is oh yes it is too it is the truth did
[33:00] you notice paul never knew jesus
[33:02] physically
[33:04] paul never knew him the only way that
[33:06] paul knew him was by a revelation
[33:09] by a vision is that right
[33:11] paul only knew jesus by the revelation
[33:14] just like peter did
[33:16] peter had seen in flesh but he didn't
[33:18] know him by flesh
[33:20] because jesus said so flesh and blood
[33:22] didn't reveal it to you even my own life
[33:24] didn't reveal it to you but my father
[33:26] which is in heaven has revealed the
[33:27] thing to you that he is the word of god
[33:31] and upon this rock i build my church
[33:34] peter didn't know him by flesh
[33:36] man walked and handled him and
[33:37] everything else paul had something
[33:39] greater than any of the apostles did
[33:41] see they said well i
[33:43] i've got more of a revelation you paul
[33:45] because you know i'll walk with him i
[33:47] went fishing with him one day
[33:48] i heard him talk he sat in a boat with
[33:51] me and actually told me let's go over
[33:52] here and fish in this place we get more
[33:54] fish and we did it
[33:55] see we see him do things but paul saw
[33:58] him after he was dead
[34:01] buried
[34:02] rose again and expressed himself in the
[34:04] pillar of fire that led the children of
[34:06] israel
[34:07] knowing paul being a jew would never
[34:09] call that lord unless he had seen the
[34:12] expression he was back the same
[34:13] yesterday and forever he said paul in
[34:15] other words i'm the same god today that
[34:17] it was yesterday here i am in the same
[34:19] light the pillar of fire that moses
[34:21] talked to in the burning bush
[34:23] no wonder he could separate the law from
[34:25] grace over in the book of hebrews
[34:27] he met that same pillar of fire he said
[34:29] i'm jesus whom you persecuted
[34:38] expressed himself in vindicating himself
[34:41] the same revealing the mystery of god
[34:43] that's been a hit since the foundation
[34:45] of the world
[34:48] sin
[34:49] paul only knew him about knew him by
[34:50] revelation
[34:52] peter knew him by revelation he walked
[34:54] with him talk with him therefore you can
[34:56] set this word
[34:57] i just said that he was the word
[35:00] now a scholar can sit down and read that
[35:02] word well he can just tie your mind up
[35:04] in any way
[35:05] he if he wants to do it because he's
[35:07] smart brilliant
[35:09] get a catholic priest
[35:10] or not so much as that as a real good
[35:12] trained theologian in the bible
[35:14] brother a baptist or a presbyterian or
[35:16] something he'll make you think that you
[35:18] don't know nothing
[35:19] when it comes to talk why
[35:21] see
[35:22] because that he has
[35:25] noted him in the flesh
[35:27] the word
[35:29] but the only way you're saved is by
[35:31] knowing by revelation
[35:33] if i can take i take the presbyterian
[35:35] doctrine and tie you pentecostal you
[35:36] want to i take the baptist doctrine and
[35:39] show you pentecostals a million things
[35:40] that you know nothing of them ryan
[35:43] but that's not it that's not his church
[35:46] that's not his church his church is
[35:49] himself
[35:50] revealed
[35:52] amen do you see it and expressed
[35:56] by the word itself that he is god
[36:00] how can you say father son holy ghost
[36:02] and be baptized tonight amen
[36:07] how can you say you know jesus christ
[36:08] he's the word well it's not a scripture
[36:10] in the bible there is not a place where
[36:12] anybody was ever baptized in the name of
[36:14] father son holy ghost
[36:16] and you and you jesus only people just
[36:19] using the name jesus for baptism i'm
[36:21] personally acquainted with four or five
[36:23] jesus is myself
[36:26] so you see what your denominations lead
[36:28] you into
[36:30] that's the darkness the expression of
[36:32] cain
[36:33] who brought fruits instead of blood
[36:35] amen but the revelation come through the
[36:37] blood
[36:39] through jesus christ who is the blood of
[36:41] god creating blood in the womb of mary
[36:45] and paul knew him by revelations that's
[36:46] how we know him today is only the only
[36:48] way you can do it now say i'm methodist
[36:50] that means nothing i'm baptist that
[36:52] means nothing
[36:53] i'm catholic that means nothing but by
[36:55] the revelation
[36:57] that god has revealed the word to you
[37:00] he is the word
[37:02] and the word how you know it's revealed
[37:04] it lives itself and expresses itself
[37:06] through you
[37:08] oh
[37:09] churches has long forgotten
[37:11] that great revelation
[37:14] that's right revelation of the truth
[37:16] they have forgotten they went to now
[37:18] when luther raised up he was a great man
[37:21] he had the revelation of that day
[37:23] but what happened a bunch of ricky's got
[37:24] in flat top haircuts as we call him
[37:26] today and ricketts and all of them they
[37:28] got around there and uh and uh and the
[37:31] first thing you know it's their uh
[37:33] that's expression if you only only knew
[37:34] the numerology of the bible you know
[37:36] what elvis or ricky means to the
[37:38] scripture
[37:40] just like why did jesus say there's
[37:42] nothing to that your name there isn't
[37:44] that name could only come in this last
[37:45] days
[37:47] for this last days people
[37:49] why did jesus change abram's name to
[37:51] abraham man
[37:52] sarah to sarah
[37:54] why did you change um a saul to paul
[37:58] why did you change simon to peter
[38:01] and so forth you see it certainly means
[38:04] something that name cannot be spoken
[38:05] till this day
[38:07] that's the reason we got this hellish
[38:09] thing we got in the earth today
[38:11] because of such things the whole human
[38:13] race is corrupted it's it's gone
[38:18] that's why it is notice now he was all
[38:20] right he was in his days
[38:23] luther and he had the revelation as soon
[38:25] as he left look what they did wesley had
[38:27] a message look what it did the old early
[38:29] pentecostals hadn't looked like they did
[38:31] they got a bunch of man together it's
[38:33] not exactly the same thing that god by
[38:35] grace sent israel a pillar of fire
[38:39] a prophet a sacrifice and showed himself
[38:42] among them and brought him out of egypt
[38:44] across the red seas and they wanted a
[38:46] law
[38:47] so they could have great dignitaries
[38:50] they could have something to do into it
[38:51] and what did they do they was left in
[38:53] the wilderness for 40 years to wander
[38:54] and not one of that organization ever
[38:57] went over
[39:00] and joshua the only two stood out and
[39:01] said we're able to take it to look at
[39:03] the word of god
[39:04] every one of them died in the wilderness
[39:06] and jesus said they were eternally gone
[39:09] right after it showed his blessings and
[39:11] power their ages like luther wesley and
[39:14] so forth
[39:16] did he
[39:17] said our fathers eat man in the
[39:18] wilderness she said and they're everyone
[39:20] dead that's eternal separated from god
[39:24] their carcass is perished in the
[39:25] wilderness
[39:27] they're dead
[39:29] i'm the bread of life that come from god
[39:31] out of heaven they couldn't see it they
[39:33] just couldn't see it all right church
[39:35] has long forgotten it
[39:36] they accepted intellectual
[39:40] uh message
[39:41] intellectuals membership knowledge
[39:44] instead of the revelation of the truth
[39:46] of the word
[39:48] now look here they say today do you
[39:50] believe that god commissioners go into
[39:51] all world heal the sick and preach the
[39:53] gospel and cast out devils oh oh yes i
[39:56] suppose that right but you see
[39:58] a lady told me the other day she said
[40:00] well all the churches are in harmony i
[40:02] said there isn't one of them in harmony
[40:03] with the other
[40:05] amen
[40:06] there's catholics standing there i said
[40:08] how about you you're a methodist and
[40:09] that's catholic
[40:11] are you in harm in one another
[40:13] i said this pope conrad united together
[40:15] that's a good thing for all that kind of
[40:16] people but the church of god has nothing
[40:18] to do with it
[40:21] it's out from the whole
[40:22] bunch yes sir you want to unite that
[40:25] together and one believes in something
[40:27] the other methodist takes franklin the
[40:29] baptist taking person and both of them
[40:30] denying the holy ghost and his fullness
[40:32] of the power they said we receive the
[40:34] holy ghost when we believe
[40:35] the bible said have you received the
[40:37] holy ghost since you believe
[40:39] there's a difference
[40:40] that's right
[40:41] see
[40:42] and they say we're the catholic church
[40:44] we started early we did this the methods
[40:46] say we are based upon the bible jesus
[40:48] said these signs shall follow them and
[40:50] believe now where's that
[40:54] works that i do shall you do all so
[40:55] every creature every person that
[40:57] believes in him now where is it at
[40:59] that's his words heavens and earth will
[41:01] pass away but my word shall never fail
[41:04] now where's it at right oh it just shows
[41:07] what is it it's a hybrid condition
[41:10] look here you take a big fine grain of
[41:12] corn it's hybrid
[41:14] and you take a hybrid corn it's a pretty
[41:16] corn
[41:17] but you plant it what do you get a
[41:19] little stalk comes up like this and
[41:20] turns yellow and wheels down
[41:22] that's where every denomination is once
[41:24] hybrid with man's words mixed with god's
[41:26] word it'll come up to the signs and
[41:28] wonders and what jesus said about
[41:30] believing the word it turns yellow and
[41:31] say we can't accept it go back just like
[41:33] all them other spies that it went over
[41:35] look at canaan they come over there and
[41:37] say oh we look like grasshoppers sodom
[41:38] we can't take them the amalekites so all
[41:40] these what they're going to do and they
[41:42] went back and caleb and joshua being
[41:44] thoroughbreds amen by the word of god no
[41:47] god said i give you that man
[41:49] they said we're more than able to take
[41:51] it amen
[41:53] it depends on where you're born from if
[41:55] you're born to the word of god god's
[41:57] word has a preeminence is in his church
[42:00] that's what he died for that's his
[42:01] purpose that he might uh be able to
[42:03] achieve to have his premise working in
[42:05] his church
[42:07] let the word of god shine forth first no
[42:10] matter what anything else looks like i
[42:12] don't care if the intellectual says this
[42:13] that it has nothing to do with it god's
[42:15] word said so and we were more than able
[42:17] to take it
[42:18] if i preached that my church the
[42:19] minister told me said i'd be preaching
[42:21] the four posts in the church i said i'd
[42:23] preach that
[42:25] god's word said so we can do it god said
[42:28] do it
[42:31] amen amen oh
[42:33] yeah they excuse themselves for this see
[42:35] that's why
[42:37] they're blind to the message of the end
[42:39] time
[42:41] this last days when god is proving
[42:43] himself
[42:45] they try to class it as some kind of a
[42:47] spiritist
[42:49] or some uh
[42:52] oh what would i call it some mental
[42:54] an illusion
[42:56] or
[42:57] something on that order see they they
[42:59] try to make it something that it is and
[43:01] just like they did when he was here when
[43:03] jesus is here they called him beelzebub
[43:05] a fortune teller
[43:07] now they say it's kind of like a mental
[43:09] telepathy thing when they know that he
[43:11] could stand there and look upon the
[43:13] people and discern the very thoughts is
[43:15] in their heart the bible said so
[43:17] well does not hebrews the fourth chapter
[43:19] says the word of god is quicker and
[43:20] sharper than a two-edged sword and
[43:22] concerned the very thoughts of the mind
[43:23] and he was that word and when that word
[43:26] is permanence in the man the same thing
[43:28] takes place again
[43:30] for it is the word
[43:31] amen
[43:35] see how you can stumble over this
[43:38] they're so perfectly plain see
[43:40] all right that's why they're blind same
[43:42] as it was in the days crisis on earth oh
[43:45] my
[43:46] they staggered the same way they said
[43:47] he's bills above yeah they said he could
[43:49] do it so they said he's just a he was
[43:51] born a legitimate child kind of an odd
[43:53] fella he just got possessed for some
[43:55] devil he's a he's a samaritan over there
[43:57] and he's got a devil in him that's how
[43:58] he does that
[43:59] jesus said i'll forgive you for that is
[44:02] he calling the word of god the works of
[44:04] god
[44:04] an evil spirit he said i forgive you for
[44:07] that but someday the holy ghost will
[44:08] come
[44:09] one word against it will never be
[44:11] forgiven neither in this world or the
[44:12] world that is to come or that great day
[44:15] it will not be forgiven so i see that's
[44:17] written plain in the scripture so when
[44:19] people come to that day no matter how
[44:21] intellectual how big a denomination they
[44:23] belong to it's condemned they have to be
[44:26] they blasphemed the holy ghost calling
[44:28] it holy roller in something that had an
[44:30] un
[44:31] tasty name or something like that and
[44:33] god's church had to bear it all the time
[44:36] even paul before griffith said in the
[44:37] way that's called heresy which means
[44:39] crazy that's the way i worship the god
[44:41] of my mother that green international
[44:43] scholar had to come to that place in a
[44:45] way that's called heresy why it was
[44:47] revealed to him that killed our fire
[44:49] hanging before him said i'm jesus the
[44:51] great god that was in the wilderness out
[44:53] with moses i am he and it's hard for you
[44:56] to kick against the preacher when paul
[44:58] said i know that life was laying at
[45:00] stake he said the way it is called
[45:02] heresy that's the way i worship the god
[45:04] of our father it was called that because
[45:06] it was revealed to him what the great
[45:08] truth of christ was and today people say
[45:12] it's a denomination it's jesus christ
[45:14] the new birth revealed in you
[45:16] and he has a premium and it says that he
[45:18] might express his words and anything
[45:19] that he's promised in his last days he
[45:21] can bring it to pass to his body as he's
[45:23] working hey man it's just exactly the
[45:25] word of god made manifest notice
[45:29] all right same as in the days of christ
[45:32] god holds a key to this revelation of
[45:34] christ himself
[45:37] you believe that
[45:39] schools of theology can never find it
[45:41] jesus said so if you want to read it now
[45:43] in saint matthew 11 25 and 27
[45:47] i thank the old father god of heaven's
[45:49] earth that thou s hid this from the eyes
[45:50] of wise and prudent reveal it to babes
[45:52] such as would learn amen see
[45:55] see
[45:56] i don't care look at them scholars of
[45:57] that day
[45:58] those jews very fine man they're
[46:01] organizations
[46:03] of pharisees sadducees and herodians and
[46:05] whatever they might be see all the great
[46:07] organizations and jesus said you're
[46:09] blind
[46:11] you lead the blind
[46:13] isaiah speak of you you have ears and
[46:15] can't hear an eyes that you can't see
[46:18] because isaiah said this in the spirit
[46:20] therefore the god of heaven has blinded
[46:23] your eyes you're doing like eve did
[46:25] accepting the intellectual side and know
[46:27] nothing of the spirit of god
[46:29] therefore won't they all fall in the
[46:31] ditch
[46:32] both the leader and the blind too
[46:34] the leader will fall with the blind
[46:36] because he's blind also the leader fall
[46:39] as blind leading the blind they both
[46:41] fall in the ditch and god also holds
[46:44] this king
[46:46] expressed the same thing in the previous
[46:47] scriptures a while ago when i read it
[46:49] when he said uh who does man say i the
[46:51] son of man am
[46:52] and peter said the art the christ the
[46:55] son of the living god he said blessed
[46:56] art thou simon
[46:58] a son of jonathan
[46:59] flesh and blood never revealed this to
[47:01] you
[47:02] my father which is in heaven upon this
[47:04] revelation here alone
[47:06] i'll build my church the gates of hell
[47:09] will never prevail against it see now
[47:11] you see so therefore there's no school
[47:13] no theologians no teachings of the bible
[47:16] among any school that knows anything
[47:17] about it they cannot know nothing about
[47:19] it's impossible for them to know
[47:20] anything about it god has hid the senses
[47:23] of anointing from the very elected
[47:25] teachers and everything else it's a
[47:26] personal individual affair with the
[47:28] person that christ has revealed to them
[47:30] and if you say it's been revealed to me
[47:32] and then the life that christ produced
[47:34] here in the bible that same life is in
[47:36] him does not produce itself in you then
[47:38] you've got the wrong revelation
[47:41] if i put a life of a pumpkin into the
[47:44] life of a pear tree it would bear
[47:46] pumpkins or other fruits you shall know
[47:48] them
[47:49] exactly right if the first you put out a
[47:53] tree a grapevine and it put out a bunch
[47:55] of grapes the first shoot it put out
[47:56] broke grapes the next brought out lemons
[47:58] and nixon brought out pears and next
[48:00] brought out apples
[48:01] there's some kind of a grafted a fairy
[48:03] in there it's bearing its own life
[48:05] every denomination will bear life of
[48:06] itself but if that original vine ever
[48:09] puts out another uh uh shoot it'll bear
[48:12] grapes like it did the first time if the
[48:15] life the life of jesus christ ever puts
[48:17] out another body of believers it'll bear
[48:19] the fruit that the first one did they'll
[48:21] write a book of acts behind it because
[48:23] it'll be the same the same life praise
[48:26] god
[48:27] see what i mean
[48:28] you just can't get away from it it's the
[48:30] life of christ in you being injected in
[48:32] you by the holy spirit itself living its
[48:34] life through you
[48:36] blind leaders of the blind notice god
[48:38] holds this key alone
[48:40] no theologian can tell you it's not
[48:43] known it's hid from them they know
[48:45] nothing about it so the schools when you
[48:46] say i got a phllld you only make you're
[48:49] to me now i believe into god and to any
[48:52] real true believer that means you're
[48:53] just that much farther away
[48:55] it's backed off
[48:56] god is not known by education he's not
[48:58] knowing about how to explain it god is
[49:00] known by simplicity and of revelation of
[49:03] jesus christ is the most illiterate
[49:04] person
[49:06] see not your theology it's a revelation
[49:09] of jesus christ upon this rock i'll
[49:11] build my church no other rocks accepted
[49:14] no other things accepted no other roman
[49:16] rock nor the protestant rock nor other
[49:18] school nor there nothing but on exactly
[49:21] the revelation of jesus christ through
[49:23] the new birth he borns in there and he
[49:25] injects his own life and your life is
[49:27] gone and the life of christ is
[49:28] projecting itself through you with the
[49:30] preeminences to the people that they see
[49:32] the very life and works and signs and
[49:34] wonders that he did is doing the same
[49:36] thing through you
[49:37] outside of that the rest of us not even
[49:39] called to it all
[49:42] watch god's great revelation unfolding
[49:46] by lack of this revelation
[49:48] is why we have so many
[49:50] different divisions among us and so much
[49:54] mockery so much uh division among us
[49:56] that because the people like that
[49:58] revelation
[50:00] they like that revelation the teachers
[50:02] paul after his great revelation of
[50:04] christ said in first corinthians the
[50:06] second chapter be sure to read that as
[50:09] you write it down watch
[50:10] oh he said i ever come to you with
[50:12] wisdom look at that man who did have the
[50:14] wisdom
[50:15] but look at that man who had the
[50:16] scholarship i'd never come to you with
[50:18] them kind of a word first corinthians
[50:20] the second chapter of first corinthians
[50:23] oh let's just read can you stand a
[50:25] minute let's read this first or two i'd
[50:27] just like to read it so you you wouldn't
[50:28] be can get even the people on the tape
[50:31] to turn back to it anyhow give them a
[50:32] chance first corinthians the second
[50:34] chapter listen to this great apostle
[50:36] here paul the intellectual servant of
[50:39] god let's look at here i paul when i
[50:42] come to you came not with excessively a
[50:45] speech of wisdom
[50:47] declaring to you the testimony of god i
[50:49] never said i i'm dr so and
[50:52] so for i am determined not to know
[50:55] anything among you save jesus christ and
[50:58] him crucified
[51:00] and i was with you in weakness and in
[51:02] fear and much trembling
[51:04] my speech and and my beseeching was not
[51:07] with any enticing words of man's wisdom
[51:11] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[51:13] power of the power
[51:15] there see there's a gospel
[51:18] jesus said go you know the world preach
[51:20] the gospel
[51:22] didn't say go teach he said go preach
[51:25] in other words demonstrate the power and
[51:27] these signs shall follow them just
[51:29] teaching doesn't do it it takes the
[51:31] actual spirit itself demonstrating these
[51:34] signs listen to this
[51:37] that your face should not stand in the
[51:39] wisdom of man but in the
[51:41] power of god
[51:43] oh my see to change the man
[51:46] none of what i can explain away and say
[51:48] he's not the same when he is the same if
[51:50] i do that it shows to me
[51:52] it's surely a man tell me that which
[51:54] showed me he don't have the revelation
[51:56] the threefold revelation of god hey
[51:59] now in high bid and weakness among you
[52:01] that are perfect yet we're not with the
[52:04] wisdom of the world but
[52:06] all the
[52:07] princes of this world that come to
[52:10] naught but we speak the wisdom of god in
[52:14] mystery see the threefold mystery of god
[52:18] even the hidden wisdom
[52:20] which god ordained before
[52:23] the world unto
[52:25] our glory
[52:27] which none of the princes of this world
[52:31] knew none of the priests rebuy rabbis
[52:34] pardon me or anything knew anything
[52:35] about it
[52:36] for had they known it they would have
[52:39] not crucified the lord of glory you said
[52:41] you're wrong about rabbis and preachers
[52:43] there who crucified him amen
[52:50] save time because we got uh uh just
[52:53] not getting late yet but we just got
[52:56] plenty here to say if the lord will help
[52:57] us now
[52:59] lack of this now and paul this great
[53:01] intellectual man never tried to express
[53:04] his great theological terms upon the
[53:07] people he humbly
[53:09] accepted the word of the lord and he
[53:11] lived the word so it expressed he lived
[53:14] so it was so godly until they seen jesus
[53:16] christ in him so much so they wanted his
[53:18] handkerchief
[53:19] to take and laid upon the sick
[53:22] there's the life of christ
[53:24] i watched something oh you see elijah
[53:27] done that long time ago ladies stick but
[53:28] oh that was the days of elijah
[53:30] now the world thought that the
[53:32] intellectual priests and things and
[53:34] churches that they thought that but the
[53:35] unbelievers they no different
[53:37] they seen the revelation of christ that
[53:39] was in elijah the same thing was in paul
[53:41] expressed the same kind of life because
[53:43] he was a prophet
[53:45] he foretold things that happened exactly
[53:47] the way it was and they know that was
[53:48] god's identification of a prophet
[53:50] and they know that he was god's prophets
[53:52] you couldn't shake them from it at all
[53:54] even when they seen peter foretell those
[53:56] things and come to pass they said just
[53:57] let his shadow pass over me
[53:59] amen that's the church
[54:02] that's the ones that believe it yes sir
[54:05] it was revealed by why paul say because
[54:07] i i got a ph.l.d and so forth they
[54:11] believe me no he said i forgot all those
[54:13] things the wisdom of mans that had to
[54:15] die now i know him in the power of his
[54:18] resurrection that's what i come to you
[54:19] at for the demonstration of god's power
[54:22] what was it making jesus christ the same
[54:23] yesterday and forever the same works
[54:26] that jesus did paul did the same and
[54:27] they seemed god the great father that
[54:30] had demonstrated in the burning bush had
[54:31] demonstrated to paul and here it was
[54:33] being demonstrated and he's the same in
[54:35] every age god's threefold manner
[54:37] yesterday today and forever what
[54:40] redeemer in his church for eminence in
[54:42] the coming kingdom
[54:44] amen you see it
[54:46] just as perfect as it can be oh notice
[54:49] the holy ghost is the only revealer of
[54:53] the divine revelation of christ
[54:58] there's no school can do it
[55:00] no scholar can do it no man how well
[55:03] educated how godly or anything else is
[55:05] no man can do it
[55:09] i could sting hard here
[55:12] how many christians born again raise up
[55:14] your hands filled all the ghosts all
[55:15] right here we go then
[55:17] all right notice and he will only do it
[55:20] to the predestination
[55:26] all the father has given me will come
[55:28] and no man can come except the fathers
[55:30] give him to me
[55:32] first look at that present this man's
[55:35] belgium he's a fortune teller he's a
[55:37] devil that little woman walking around
[55:39] there living with six husbands
[55:41] she lived with five and had the sixth
[55:42] one then and jesus said go get your
[55:44] husband come here she said i have no
[55:46] husband said yes you've got six you've
[55:48] had five and the one you're living with
[55:49] now is not your husband she said sir
[55:52] what that light struck that seed
[55:55] when he shut down priests and said this
[55:56] man is a fortune teller see no life
[55:58] there hybrid could come up as far as the
[56:00] organization but died from their own but
[56:02] this woman's not a hybrid
[56:04] he said sir i perceive i can see your
[56:07] big pretty eyes shine up like that tears
[56:09] running on her cheeks sir
[56:11] i perceive that you're a prophet
[56:13] i'm looking for a messiah and when that
[56:16] messiah comes he'll do this very same
[56:18] thing he'll tell us these things he said
[56:20] i'm he oh lord she left her
[56:22] there he is see a man who's told me the
[56:24] things what was it that light struck
[56:26] that seed
[56:28] that life was there to come forth same
[56:30] thing today
[56:31] but the theologian said now wait just a
[56:33] minute i'll find out it's so-and-so
[56:35] pastor moody settered
[56:39] what's pastor moody got to do with this
[56:41] this day
[56:42] pastor moody lived in his day but not
[56:44] now
[56:47] certainly
[56:48] luther lived in his day but not in the
[56:49] day of wesley
[56:51] wesley in his day not the day of
[56:52] pentecost
[56:54] pentecost leaving their day but they're
[56:56] a long ways from this
[56:58] we're in the last hour sure there are
[57:00] organizations and scruples up proves
[57:02] that it's not there the word has never
[57:04] been correctly vindicated just only in
[57:06] his strength
[57:07] seeds denominations and it make
[57:09] denomination put that old gypsum weed
[57:11] seeds in with that genuine wheat died
[57:14] right out
[57:15] crop went to jameson all right
[57:17] green bars and nettles
[57:20] went all back to that it died right out
[57:22] then they broke the field up and started
[57:23] over again playing some real seeds and
[57:25] some of them come up and choked it out
[57:26] but then god said in this last days he'd
[57:29] bring out our people
[57:31] washing his blood
[57:33] and they were predestinated to be there
[57:35] they've got to be there god said so and
[57:37] it would reveal and the very sign i was
[57:41] malachi 4 and what he would do restore
[57:44] back again
[57:45] bring back in the last days these great
[57:47] things that he promised it bring the
[57:49] revelation what is what c to do malachi
[57:52] 4 was to bring back the faith
[57:55] of the fathers to the children see
[57:57] that's right bring that same thing the
[57:59] same pillar of fire in on the scene the
[58:02] same signs the same wonders the same
[58:04] jesus making him the same preaching him
[58:06] the same vindicating him the same
[58:08] yesterday today and forever i will
[58:10] restore saith the lord all the years
[58:12] that the methodist worm and the
[58:14] caterpillar worm and the baptist and the
[58:16] catholic and all them words eat that
[58:17] faith down to become a denominational
[58:19] stump where there's no seeds left in
[58:21] there but i will restore again saith the
[58:24] lord all the years for all the signs and
[58:27] wonders that they've forsaken i'll take
[58:28] it right back to that original tree
[58:30] again and i will restore it saith the
[58:32] lord
[58:33] that prophet was a vindicated prophet
[58:35] his word has to come to pass
[58:38] amen
[58:39] the holy ghost alone is the revealer of
[58:42] the divine revelation of christ
[58:44] and has been in all ages remember all
[58:47] ages who did the word of the lord come
[58:49] to
[58:50] prophet alone
[58:52] that's right is that right amen and the
[58:53] prophet had to be vindicated first
[58:56] not because he said he was a prophet
[58:58] because he was born a prophet and proved
[59:00] to be a prophet and everything he said
[59:02] was exactly on the word and come to pass
[59:04] then everything else let go see
[59:07] it was the word of the lord came only by
[59:09] the holy ghost the bible said the man of
[59:10] old moved by the holy ghost amen
[59:13] wrote the word
[59:15] look
[59:16] john the baptist would never had known
[59:19] jesus if it hadn't had been for the holy
[59:21] ghost pointing him out
[59:24] that ryan
[59:26] john the baptist that great prophet
[59:29] that come forth and said there's one
[59:30] standing among you right now
[59:32] an ordinary man standing here somewhere
[59:34] that's the lamb of god yeah
[59:37] john said that i bore record i bear
[59:39] record i saw the spirit of god the holy
[59:42] ghost descending from heaven like a dove
[59:45] and it went upon me and a voice said
[59:46] this is my beloved son
[59:48] whom on please what was it the holy
[59:50] ghost that i'll pour him out
[59:52] that's the only way you know him today
[59:55] only way you'll get the threefold
[59:56] revelation of god is for the holy ghost
[59:58] and the only way it can ever be is
[1:00:00] you're predestinated to see it if it
[1:00:02] don't you'll never see it
[1:00:05] if you're not predestinated to see it
[1:00:07] you'll never see it cause that light
[1:00:08] confession will go away make fun of it
[1:00:11] and explain it away for some
[1:00:12] intellectual conception when the very
[1:00:14] god himself manifested himself and
[1:00:16] proven it see but if it ain't up on you
[1:00:18] to see it you won't see it god never
[1:00:20] just said i'll choose this one choose
[1:00:21] that and but he knew by his reasons he
[1:00:24] could procrastinate because he's
[1:00:25] infinite and he he knows er he's
[1:00:27] infinite so therefore he knowed
[1:00:29] everything he know the ending can tell
[1:00:30] the end from the beginning he's god we
[1:00:32] can't do that he's not god
[1:00:35] yes sir he's infinite
[1:00:38] all right john would have never known
[1:00:40] him no sir had the holy ghost not
[1:00:42] pouring out see how god hides his
[1:00:45] mystery
[1:00:47] to the high educated and everything look
[1:00:49] every one of them people say and
[1:00:51] simplicity reveals it to whom he has
[1:00:53] predestinated to see it
[1:00:57] look here others standing by never even
[1:01:00] seen the duh
[1:01:02] they never heard no voice
[1:01:04] for it was always sent to that
[1:01:06] predestinated seed predestinated
[1:01:09] certainly was procrastinated
[1:01:12] well isaiah 712 years before he was born
[1:01:15] in the spirit raised up out of these
[1:01:17] human senses and said there's a voice of
[1:01:19] one crying in the wilderness prepare the
[1:01:20] way of the lord
[1:01:28] all the prophets of the old testament
[1:01:30] that mainly that great prophet standing
[1:01:31] at the end of the age
[1:01:34] he was predestinated certainly he was
[1:01:39] malcolm i saw him too
[1:01:42] jesus said if you can receive it this is
[1:01:43] he who is spoken about sam a messenger
[1:01:45] before my face malcolm 3 to prepare the
[1:01:47] way before me
[1:01:49] see sure he was predestinated to see
[1:01:51] that message no wonder he could look at
[1:01:52] her and see that dove coming down that
[1:01:54] light that was in the wilderness with
[1:01:56] israel coming moving down the god
[1:01:58] himself saying this is my beloved son in
[1:02:01] whom i'm pleased to dwell in god and man
[1:02:03] becoming one
[1:02:05] i bear witness john said i'll be happy
[1:02:08] the only begotten of the father amen i'm
[1:02:10] a witness of it
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:13] there you are
[1:02:15] simplicity with an old preacher his
[1:02:18] father his father was a great theologian
[1:02:20] you know he come out of a school looked
[1:02:22] like he went back to his father's
[1:02:23] denomination
[1:02:24] that wouldn't be in the will of god
[1:02:27] when god touched him at his birth back
[1:02:28] there and he received the holy ghost
[1:02:30] three months before he's born
[1:02:33] yes sir
[1:02:34] when mary went up there and little john
[1:02:36] was six months old in his mother's womb
[1:02:38] and had never done little muscles that
[1:02:39] never moved yet and mary was afraid the
[1:02:42] little muscles were growing but she
[1:02:43] couldn't feel no alive
[1:02:45] elizabeth his mother other and when mary
[1:02:47] came up and grabbed her and hugged her
[1:02:48] put her arms laid hands on her
[1:02:52] what's up
[1:02:54] god has spoke to me
[1:02:56] now i'm going to have a baby too
[1:02:58] are you and joseph mary no mary how can
[1:03:01] this be the holy ghost shall overshadow
[1:03:03] me
[1:03:04] now be created in me
[1:03:06] amen and i shall call his name jesus
[1:03:09] he'll be the son of god and as soon as
[1:03:11] that word jesus spoke little john began
[1:03:13] to leap
[1:03:15] [Applause]
[1:03:20] the mother of my lord the mother of my
[1:03:23] lord over my health
[1:03:26] comes the mother of my lord for as soon
[1:03:27] as your salutation come into my ears my
[1:03:29] baby leaped in the womb for joy
[1:03:31] don't worry he didn't want no seminary
[1:03:34] something to indoctrinate him or
[1:03:35] something he had a important job
[1:03:38] he was a man of the wilderness
[1:03:41] went out into the wilderness and waited
[1:03:43] god told him out there so now a reveal
[1:03:45] to him oh there's your revelation again
[1:03:48] i'll tell you who he is you're a prophet
[1:03:50] the words to you you know who you are
[1:03:52] you've got to come that answers a
[1:03:54] question from last sunday
[1:03:56] you know who you are john keep yourself
[1:03:58] quiet don't say nothing
[1:04:00] wall out there
[1:04:01] and when you see this one
[1:04:03] there'll be a sign coming from heaven
[1:04:05] like a light a dove will come down
[1:04:08] that'll be him when you see him that's
[1:04:10] the reason when jesus walked out in the
[1:04:11] water john looked already seen that dove
[1:04:13] coming down he said behold the lamb of
[1:04:15] god there he is
[1:04:17] he's the one that'll take away the sin
[1:04:18] of the world jesus would walk right
[1:04:20] straight out the water to him and two
[1:04:21] eyes of john met them two eyes of jesus
[1:04:24] they were second cousins by flesh
[1:04:26] mary and elizabeth were first cousins
[1:04:28] their eyes met one another there was god
[1:04:30] in his prophet
[1:04:32] damn man
[1:04:33] john said i need to be baptized of thee
[1:04:37] why come now to me jesus said suffer to
[1:04:39] be so now
[1:04:40] but remember thus said be who with us to
[1:04:42] fulfill all righteousness why did john
[1:04:44] do it because he was the sacrifice john
[1:04:46] was a prophet he know and the sacrifice
[1:04:49] has got to be washed before he's
[1:04:50] presented
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:53] and then he baptized him when he lowered
[1:04:55] the heavens open oh my god
[1:04:58] that dog come down upon him and the boy
[1:05:00] said this is my beloved son
[1:05:02] in whom i'm pleased to dwell in king

[1:05:21] others stand there didn't hear nothing
[1:05:22] about it the holy ghost alone reveals it
[1:05:24] same when he reveals himself
[1:05:28] to paul
[1:05:29] another predestinated seed that was paul
[1:05:32] going around he mike said if i get a
[1:05:33] hold of that bunch

[1:10:56] manifested in the fullness deity himself
[1:10:59] standing on earth
[1:11:01] god in his fullness to die for the sin
[1:11:05] of the people that he might bring to his
[1:11:07] church a sanctified life that he might
[1:11:11] have the premise and fullness in his
[1:11:13] church to manifest every promise in
[1:11:16] these last days that he promised for the
[1:11:18] last days
[1:11:19] see
[1:11:20] what was listen now all right uh just
[1:11:22] pinch yourself a little bit what what
[1:11:25] was jesus manifested for to show
[1:11:28] god
[1:11:30] he was god
[1:11:32] he had to be
[1:11:34] no man could die no prophet could die
[1:11:38] he was god he was the god of the
[1:11:41] prophets
[1:11:42] he was a prophet he was a king he was
[1:11:45] the history he was he that was to come
[1:11:47] he that was he that is and he just be in
[1:11:49] this day
[1:11:51] the same yesterday and forever
[1:11:53] he was manifested for that purpose and
[1:11:56] through that purpose he achieved a
[1:11:58] church
[1:11:59] that he the fullness of god might bring
[1:12:02] to pass every promised word of god in
[1:12:04] these last days when he gets the
[1:12:07] premise in the church
[1:12:09] the position his place in the church
[1:12:12] jesus said he that believeth on me the
[1:12:15] works that i do shall he also even more
[1:12:18] than this shall he do for i go to my
[1:12:20] father see that was his purpose there
[1:12:23] was a manifestation and now today he
[1:12:26] wants to get somebody that can so see it
[1:12:29] that they can let the word see jesus so
[1:12:32] seen it
[1:12:33] so we're so perfectly born for the day
[1:12:36] until god expressed every move that he
[1:12:38] made
[1:12:40] he was god's revelation
[1:12:43] god revealed
[1:12:45] now he's sanctified with his spirit and
[1:12:48] blood a church that he might make every
[1:12:51] promise in this last day be revealed now
[1:12:54] i see he could go back and pick up what
[1:12:56] these other fellows has left off here in
[1:12:57] the last days about his holy spirit
[1:12:59] reveal all the mystery of the seven
[1:13:00] seals
[1:13:02] he's expressing himself that's his
[1:13:04] purpose
[1:13:06] that's why he died
[1:13:08] that's the second fold of his threefold
[1:13:09] manifestation
[1:13:11] first you express himself in christ then
[1:13:12] express himself to the church and the
[1:13:14] same thing christ was the word
[1:13:18] and the church becomes a word when it
[1:13:19] lets the word go through them but when
[1:13:21] they accept the hybrid denomination how
[1:13:23] can the word go through it right now
[1:13:25] and it's grounded
[1:13:28] and it causes short blows of views
[1:13:31] but when the current is flowing freely
[1:13:33] the word of god it expresses itself the
[1:13:35] works that i do shall yield ye also
[1:13:38] and in the last days it shall come to
[1:13:40] pass behold i send you elijah the
[1:13:42] prophet
[1:13:43] and he shall turn the hearts of the of
[1:13:46] the children back to the faith of the
[1:13:48] fathers and in there there would be a
[1:13:50] time come forth when he could express
[1:13:52] himself in fullness of his godhead deity
[1:13:54] through his church have the preeminences
[1:13:57] in this church oh my what the anointed
[1:14:00] man now the anointed people
[1:14:02] oh my to bring back the anointed
[1:14:05] bride and the bridegroom anointed by why
[1:14:07] accepting what eve turned down in adam
[1:14:10] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:14:12] word because he said my word is spirit
[1:14:16] anointed with the word what he turned
[1:14:18] down he comes back and we accept
[1:14:21] see how that hybrid condition again just
[1:14:23] exactly what he done eve he told eve
[1:14:25] don't you do this and don't you do that
[1:14:26] and you can do this and that and satan
[1:14:28] said oh you know
[1:14:30] but she turned around and listened to
[1:14:31] him
[1:14:32] but the even the last day is not going
[1:14:34] to do it because she predestinated not
[1:14:36] today
[1:14:38] god's going to do it he knows he'll have
[1:14:40] he said his spot church should be there
[1:14:42] without spotter or wrinkle
[1:14:44] she's gonna stand there in the splendor
[1:14:46] of him his word made manifest she'll be
[1:14:49] a token to the world she'll be in the
[1:14:50] she'll be something to the world the
[1:14:52] world can look and say well the rest was
[1:14:53] ah she's a holy roller she's the second
[1:14:55] cousin she don't belong to our group i
[1:14:57] know that's a good thing
[1:14:59] she belongs to this group up here
[1:15:01] a man said a day to me saying talk he
[1:15:03] said well what denomination do you
[1:15:04] belong to i said none what none i said i
[1:15:07] belong to a kingdom
[1:15:10] how do you join that you don't join it
[1:15:11] you're born then
[1:15:13] what kingdom is that i said the mythical
[1:15:15] body of jesus christ by one spirit we're
[1:15:17] baptized into this body born of his
[1:15:19] spirit and we belong to a kingdom and
[1:15:21] our lives are not americans we're not
[1:15:23] germans we're not nothing we're
[1:15:24] christians we are settled and walk in
[1:15:26] the spirit our love slave from the
[1:15:28] things of the world and our rights to
[1:15:30] the world we sold out and bought this
[1:15:31] pearl of great price and walked and let
[1:15:33] the holy spirit manifest itself that's
[1:15:35] what his real church is
[1:15:36] that's what you are what i am if we let
[1:15:38] ourself go and serve god and by his word
[1:15:41] and not watch some creed says
[1:15:43] notice
[1:15:44] the anointed man the christ himself here
[1:15:48] god has made known but now look but but
[1:15:52] now why
[1:15:55] he has the premises
[1:15:57] god fully manifested in jesus christ
[1:16:01] god's great secret of his revelation
[1:16:04] this great light of revelation has
[1:16:07] always blinded the wisdom of this world
[1:16:11] in the days of jesus christ when he's
[1:16:13] here on earth they had blinded and he
[1:16:15] said well you even make yourself god
[1:16:18] you make yourself equal with god
[1:16:20] he was not only equal with god he was
[1:16:22] god himself
[1:16:24] see they don't get it
[1:16:27] by the way some of you might i've heard
[1:16:29] infidels one time told me that jesus
[1:16:30] never did say he was the son of god he
[1:16:32] sure did you certainly did you just
[1:16:34] don't know your bible
[1:16:36] what did you say to a woman as well
[1:16:38] i think what do you tell her i know
[1:16:40] messiah cometh
[1:16:42] and when he comes he'll do these things
[1:16:43] he said i'm he
[1:16:44] it speaks to you
[1:16:47] and to paul also in different one notice
[1:16:50] but now the church has the premise god's
[1:16:52] great secret has always blinded the
[1:16:54] wisdom of the world they can't get it
[1:16:56] they just don't understand it satan
[1:16:58] don't understand it now the rest of them
[1:16:59] understands it but just those who are
[1:17:01] predestinated to understand how god and
[1:17:04] christ are one they'll make him three
[1:17:07] every time
[1:17:08] they certainly will notice next secondly
[1:17:12] the manifested christ in you the hope of
[1:17:14] glory that great manifested god in
[1:17:17] christ now christ manifested in you will
[1:17:19] hurry look
[1:17:21] what was once god's great secret
[1:17:24] great mysterious secret in his mind
[1:17:27] is now put in the hearts of the believer
[1:17:31] that is the body
[1:17:32] of christ
[1:17:34] what was god's once great secret in his
[1:17:36] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:17:38] is now made manifest
[1:17:42] oh i'm i'm sure we don't we don't get it
[1:17:45] well i can't see it the way i ought to
[1:17:47] and i'm sure you don't see but god's
[1:17:50] great mystery what the eternal god
[1:17:53] had as a mystery has now been unfolded
[1:17:56] in jesus christ and give it right down
[1:17:57] to his church
[1:17:59] what was once in god's minds now in the
[1:18:00] body of christ
[1:18:02] jesus making love to the church's bride
[1:18:05] whispers secrets to her you know how you
[1:18:07] tell your wife things you know the
[1:18:08] little girl you're going to marry you
[1:18:09] love her so much you just tell her the
[1:18:11] secrets and get her up next to you and
[1:18:12] love you and everything you know how it
[1:18:14] is that's what god christ is doing to
[1:18:16] the church he's letting to know the
[1:18:17] secrets just the secret
[1:18:19] not these flirters i mean he's wise all
[1:18:22] right now look
[1:18:24] by having the revelation of a secret
[1:18:26] made known to them by his grace
[1:18:29] how the grace of god people i know it i
[1:18:32] hope you don't think this sounds
[1:18:34] personal to a bunch of people or this
[1:18:36] that but the secret that god is sharing
[1:18:38] with the whole church if they would just
[1:18:39] receive it
[1:18:41] it doesn't mean just me or just you it
[1:18:42] means the church that he he's trying to
[1:18:44] get into and you say well why don't they
[1:18:46] receive it they can't receive it
[1:18:48] he said again he said these things and
[1:18:50] how could it because isaiah said they
[1:18:52] can't see him
[1:18:53] and he's always said the prophet paul
[1:18:55] said in the last days that people would
[1:18:57] be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:18:58] more than lovers of god truth breakers
[1:19:00] false accusers incontinent and despisers
[1:19:02] are those that are good heady
[1:19:03] high-mindedness having a form of
[1:19:06] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:19:08] from such eternal way for this is the
[1:19:11] kind that goes from house to house and
[1:19:12] leads silly women laying away with
[1:19:14] divers lust with shorts and bobbed hair
[1:19:16] and everything else led away with divers
[1:19:17] lust and say it's all right oh they're
[1:19:19] crazy out there don't feel see never
[1:19:21] able to come to the knowledge of the
[1:19:22] truth
[1:19:24] and these men resisted into james and
[1:19:26] james with stood moses able to produce a
[1:19:28] church and produce a group of people
[1:19:29] just about
[1:19:30] only will be made manifest when jesus
[1:19:32] takes his pride and sets her up here and
[1:19:34] said this is her and way he goes
[1:19:36] therefore they will be made known look
[1:19:38] at having the revelation of this secret
[1:19:41] made known to them by his grace look
[1:19:43] when this great revelation revealed
[1:19:47] mystery
[1:19:48] is made known to you
[1:19:50] then you denounce all the things of the
[1:19:53] world amen
[1:19:55] now i'm going to come back once again
[1:19:57] as i was saying i'm pointing to it the
[1:19:59] tape satan
[1:20:00] and those that are going across this
[1:20:02] tape goes across the world see
[1:20:04] you women that claim you've got the
[1:20:06] baptism of the holy ghost and not the
[1:20:08] audacity to let your hair grow out
[1:20:11] when the bible condemns it and said a
[1:20:13] woman's a man's got a right to put away
[1:20:15] his wife in divorce if she bobs her hair
[1:20:17] honored before god to do so the bible
[1:20:20] says she cuts her hair she dishonors her
[1:20:22] hand
[1:20:22] and it's a common just know what any old
[1:20:24] common thing is for a woman to even pray
[1:20:26] with bob there
[1:20:28] wearing shorts and these slacks and
[1:20:30] things the bible said any woman that'll
[1:20:32] or you say it put on a garment that
[1:20:34] pertains to a man it's an abomination to
[1:20:36] god filthy dirty like an old stinking
[1:20:40] bathroom somewhere see oh my the filth
[1:20:42] in god's nostrils and then you try to
[1:20:44] pray or offer up prayers and such a
[1:20:46] thing is that god refuses and turns it
[1:20:48] away
[1:20:50] well you say now wait a minute brother
[1:20:51] brain you're talking about the old
[1:20:52] testament he's the same yesterday today
[1:20:55] and forever it's a full revelation of
[1:20:57] god god ever says anything you can never
[1:20:59] change it he over magnifies it not
[1:21:01] changing the law was magnified not
[1:21:04] changed magnified whosoever commits
[1:21:06] adultery shall be guilty of death but
[1:21:08] whosoever now magnified looked upon a
[1:21:10] woman to lust after her he never changed
[1:21:12] the commandment he magnified it
[1:21:14] remember the sabbath day and keep it
[1:21:16] holy one day in the week now he
[1:21:18] magnified it
[1:21:19] oh rest comes from keeping the spirit of
[1:21:21] god precept upon pre-sipping line up
[1:21:24] online here a little in there a little
[1:21:25] whole face that was good for with
[1:21:27] stammering lips and other tongues will i
[1:21:29] speak to these people and that is the
[1:21:30] rest
[1:21:31] that's a refreshing from the presence of
[1:21:33] the lord yet they would not hurt and
[1:21:35] wipe their heads and walk away through
[1:21:37] their denominations
[1:21:39] this is a refreshing the magnifying the
[1:21:42] sabbath day to you sabbatarians and so
[1:21:44] forth oh my you don't change he
[1:21:46] magnifies it
[1:21:49] hell is spreader gates to receive them
[1:21:51] now you can see now the end time message
[1:21:55] why it's rejected can you now
[1:21:58] no denomination
[1:22:01] but the revelation of his mystery
[1:22:04] see
[1:22:05] no denomination
[1:22:06] the revelation god's not known by
[1:22:08] denomination he's known by revelation
[1:22:10] look
[1:22:11] god in his body christ and christ in his
[1:22:14] body the bride
[1:22:17] and god may manifest in christ
[1:22:21] christ may manifest in the bride
[1:22:24] and as god took from the body of adam
[1:22:27] the woman and she fell
[1:22:29] then god is stuck from the body of
[1:22:31] christ his flesh his body which is his
[1:22:34] word
[1:22:35] is bringing the bride out
[1:22:39] [Music]

[1:22:48] and every woman will understand that
[1:22:52] she's a second eve
[1:22:54] but she's not breaking in
[1:22:56] and
[1:22:57] spawning her skirts
[1:22:58] of purity and holiness to her husband
[1:23:01] she'll stay with his word regardless of
[1:23:03] what anybody said you can have all the
[1:23:05] economical moves you want to and all the
[1:23:07] affiliations and you're going to bring a
[1:23:08] persecution on pretty soon and shut up
[1:23:10] all the churches you see that and
[1:23:12] churches like this who's not
[1:23:13] denomination they'll use them for
[1:23:14] storehouses and if any man goes and
[1:23:16] offer a prayer for anybody else that
[1:23:18] don't belong the economical movement be
[1:23:19] shot on the spot yeah man it's already
[1:23:22] that lutheran minister of the head of
[1:23:23] this sense right you're right here in
[1:23:25] your magazines right don't make any
[1:23:28] difference what they say that church
[1:23:30] will stand true enough
