he's the great sh [Music] shepher all myy God is [Music] he bow down before him love and adore him his name is wonderful Jesus my [Music] Lord amen just to be able to to say that name and and have be able to use that name if I could say try to try to give the words to that when you use that name the only name and it has an effect and it has a power people use that name in a way that they they put it down they they they use it in the wrong manner but you and I can use it in in a maybe a similar situation I would say you know I can use my name my girls might say well my father's name is Aaron and he said I could do this may not you might not saying that but what they're saying and it has a certain effect maybe they would go well my dad said it was okay and they would say well who's your dad and they would say well that's a okay I know him it's all right but to say I say in my father's name and Jesus what a power what an authority we have and I appreciate that today let's bow our heads here Lord what a wonderful name almighty God would wrap himself up in flesh be born as a babe grow up in a in a life to go through the things that we would go through learning obedience by the things he suffered [Music] coming to a place where you would yield yourself Lord there at Gethsemane at that rock Lord when you realized that everything that had been that you had come for was coming for that time for fulfillment Lord but you still had to yield yourself and say not my will but thy will be done Lord and we are the recipients of that today that Grace that Mercy Lord but you said as as you were speaking to your disciples you said I must go away Lord and their hearts were sad they say why are you going away he because if I don't go away he said then this comforter can't come I can't come and dwell in you I could just be around you be by you but this way I can be in you so Lord we appreciate that today and we love you for it Lord we yield ourselves we surrender our being to you now in Jesus Christ's name amen while you're standing we'll read the first scripture in uh thank you musicians 2 Corinthians 4: 17 and 18 and then you may be seated now Paul says it this way for our light afflictions and some of you might argue with me that your afflictions aren't very light sometimes but when you think what he went through and what he suffered in your place Paul says for our light afflictions which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal amen you may be seated you know you would say well brother if you were going through my afflictions you wouldn't think they're light but you also realize God will never put nothing upon you you cannot bear but we give you the strength and the grace to go through it and you say well you know God didn't do that I did it to myself but he was aware of it it didn't catch him by surprise I'm not saying sometimes we don't get ourselves into the troubles we get into but God's aware fully aware of it so I didn't hear any brother Peter mentioned any prayer requests but sister Amelia had put one if you don't have the WhatsApp you might have not seen it for her her daughter Eva who's been going through some physical problems and she was saying that she went to the doctor and they did some tests on her so let's remember her in prayer but also sister Amilia told me for her salvation for her to turn her heart completely to God and yesterday on I believe it was brother Robert Figaro posted on Facebook there's a family that sings they may be part of wo a a Spanish family they sing both Spanish and English and they they feature them sometimes uh on on on YouTube some of their songs and everything but they had put in a prayer request that there had been an accident the family is an accident and the youngest daughter was killed on the in the accident didn't didn't say the age or anything but the pictures that they posted it was it was a young family it looked like she would have been maybe not ENT teenss definitely younger than that so um let's just remember the Lord knows who they are and I I sometimes when I hear that news I try to imagine or put myself in their place but I really can't until you go through it you don't really know but that's why he went through what what he went through so that when you and I would ask or talk to him about it he would say I understand I Can Be Touched by the feeling of your of our infirmities you might say well you know was he ever spanked did he ever get his ears pulled I don't know but he was a child he was taken care of you know the same way I'm sure there was times that Mary and Joseph got impatient with him and maybe they had to remind each other of his special birth and of the things they went through but as humans you know sometimes we get a little frustrated we get a little upset and um and then Lord help us to say we're sorry you know to go back and make things right is when you hold those things in your heart you hold those things in yourself and they begin to fester and they begin to they begin to trouble you they begin to to to cause you to get weak and and and you know and they'll affect your relationship with God which will affect your relationship with your brother and your sister you know and and there I hear people and you see people say I can do this by myself I don't need anybody you get around them get talking to them after a little bit you find out they're usually pretty sad people they're usually going through a hard time they're just trying to be brave and tough about it but you know if we'll just surrender ourselves and just say not my will but thy will be done he has he has a a perfect plan for you a complete whole plan for you with best intentions Jeremiah tells us I know my thoughts that I have toward you and the Angus you know I say well I know sometimes that you might have some good thoughts about somebody and then they do something and boy it kind of changes your thoughts for a moment you know but his never changed is never changing and I sure appreciate that so what brother Peter spoke last Wednesday night and what some of what brother Dave gadman spoke I had already had some thoughts in my heart I had got a brother sent me a quote with a scripture and it just spoke to me and it started a a series of you know thinking about it this ties into that scripture and brother brandham said this I've experienced that and it just starts to build into a thought and um I had just mentioned it to my wife she's the only one that I said you know this this is kind of what's on my heart right now and then listen to what brother Peter said and even though we weren't in service we we heard it and being here with brother gadman especially when he got into let's fight and it was challenge you let's fight what he was saying let's stand in this and let's let's take possession of what God has given us and brother Peter talking about cold and hot and being the U I don't want to call him a scientist that wouldn't be the word but I know some of the the stuff that he's done and and how he was able to explain some of the processes in all and those of us who who passed science because we we had a good science person sitting next to us you know and I it's honest I'm being just honest about it um you know it didn't make a whole lot of sense I I struggled through algebra and my cousin who went to school with me got so bored with algebra because there was nothing exciting about it that he quit doing math and he failed the class and when they gave out the awards that year in in in high school for the top math student his name was mentioned of one who could have but because he got so bored it was so simple it had no excitement and to me I just blowing brain fuses all the time trying to figure it out you know but I thank God that he doesn't look at our ability well this one's good enough to handle but he himself dwells in you I want to read a quote in brother Jeremy I didn't give you this quote because it was one at the last minute I read it and brother brandom says this in 1949 and and and you could hear the excitement in his voice when he beginning to see and this was on the voice of God quote of the day which I try to read them every day and see what scriptures and and just different things that different people post and I see a scripture or quote I'll read it just to see there's something there but it's it's from the deity of Jesus Christ preached in 49 he says and that same power that same Christ and the Hallelujah let the fundamentalists let them who deny the power of God say it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world into existent is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost you know being raised in a Pentecostal Church our idea of the Holy Ghost really was a little different it was a lot of tongues and a lot of emotion and a lot of you know that's what you know growing up at especially in the latter part uh or or even brother brandham said in 56 he says America you've turned your heart I remember in the mid-60s and as a young man I began to see the the U the stuff that wasn't genuine anymore you know when God gives you the Holy Ghost it's genuine because it's him but people have have made their ideas and things like that and to see some of the things we saw but brother bam says here it's that same creative power in you the Holy Ghost he that's right men and wom it's time we found out who it's time we find out who you are the devil is trying to hide hide you back tell you you're some little coward down something he says you're not you are Sons and Daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God lives in you in Mortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being amen okay now so that fits perfect with my thought even though it was last night because the quote that the brother sent me it made me think I need to deny my own thoughts and say what God said because sometimes you hear something in the scriptures you hear something that is preached and you say Amen man I that's I know that's a truth but me but you don't know my situation you don't know what I'm going through and you immediately water down lessen the effect you don't lessen the word of God you lessen the effect it has in you that's what ends up happening you know um and and then you're saying if you're not careful and and brother Brown says you've made of the the scripture tell you made the word of God of none effect but God says my word shall not return void so God's word is effective it doesn't fail it's true he's faithful he's the amen so so we see that and then we say but why isn't it happening in me why am I struggling through that and I understand we're we're robed still in flesh and the scripture tells us that Jesus had to Humble himself had to say no to the flesh so if he had to say no to the flesh then so do we as brother Peter was talking about that hot and cold and I had these thoughts and I'm listening and I brother Peter doesn't know what when I say my goodness and you could see yourself at places like that you say wow how did I get to this place how did I you how did I end up here you know and and um you realize okay but God doesn't leave you there it says behold I stand at the door and knock if If any man would open the door I will come in and Su with him now and he will do it without he said If any man would do that if any being now I was listening to the message hidden life and brother brandom is talking about getting into that third part behind the curtain you know you have the three parts coming into the Tabernacle there but the holies of holies is where God dwelt now you came into the first part you observed you washed you prepared you came into the second part where the light was but if that's as far as you went you didn't get to what God desired and that was to get into the holy of holies behind the curtain now he rent the veil in two we know that to open the access so that you and I could get in there because before that it was the high priest only a a man walked in uh uh you know uh that was called of the the the tribe specific one Aaron being the first the first high priest and then the lineage followed and brother brandom in Hidden life he strongly talks about that dead uh almond stick that that Aaron had with him got left inside the holy of holies and when that high priest came back and it it had life had returned to it it had budded and it had brought forth fruit a dead limb you know so he's talking you know you look at yourself maybe you're looking at yourself and man I'm just I'm just a whole pile of nothing I just don't see well let's look to see where we're at let's see if we've gotten into that that behind behind that curtain going through there and gotten into the place where there is life where God chooses to meet now we also know he's placed it in his name brother BR says God's provided Ed place of worship it's not a physical building anymore it's not Tucson Tabernacle it's not brandom Tabernacle it's not this church that church it's not sunset Mountain or Sabino it's you in Christ it's wherever you are because he's there too you know and and you can have an effect of the surroundings as as brother Peter started saying the only real peace that I have is in you and I never thought of the the other and I don't know if you were heard it that way their only real Joy or was that just coming fresh when you were singing it or somebody else I never heard it that way maybe they do sing it but the only real Joy the only real strength the only real hope everything I have lies in you Lord then why do we go look elsewhere you know I after going through some of the things I went through and you know being sick and the effects of the diabetes and all that and um I I would drink you know I would drink one or two do peppers a day it was my uh my cold coffee some people would drink coffee I drink you know and after I got sick I'd walk by them and part of me would say get another one another part of me would say no you don't want to go through that again you know and it's been to a little over two years now and I can walk by him there is no temptation there but there still is some Temptations for some of the other things too you I would love to say exempt I I've way back but no you've got to walk in a way every day say no to the things that are not of God say no to the thoughts that are contrary to his word and say yes to what he says if if I would title this I'm going to title it deny your own thoughts because sometimes our thoughts are contrary to the word of God and then we question the Lord why and he just he he'll tell you if he would talk to you in plain English he well he just told me I can't do it no I didn't say that no that was your thoughts God you're you you're faithful you're wonderful you're just marvelous you're great but only in brothers so and so or sisters so- and so because oh they love the Lord but not in me Lord I'm struggling I'm this I'm and you begin to look at yourself and you begin to make the word of God of non effect in your own life and I know I've been there and it's a daily struggle Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this the things that I should be doing and want to do I find myself not doing the things that I shouldn't be doing I find myself doing frustrated you know waking up in the middle of the night and I wish there was sometimes a way you could click and turn off the dreams or the thoughts and just sleep but sometimes you can't they flood you I'll read some scriptures where the scriptures tell us God is greater than that David tells us in the Psalms God is greater than that and and Paul's telling us in in Corinthians we're looking to that which is unseen we're looking not at that which is around us which we we can comprehend with our our physical being and when reality what we comprehend with our physical being is so little and compared to what is available and what is out there brother brandham says in the message looking at the Unseen we'll read a couple of quotes here we won't be too long tonight looking at the Unseen now here he he's talking to the congregation there he says look how many here for the first time they was ever in one of my meetings raise your hands pretty near half the audience they've never been in the meetings how many here that's sick and needs prayer for their bodies won you raise your hand well all of us at times would say Lord I need you maybe a physical healing maybe a mental healing maybe a spiritual healing some type of healing something I'm going through you know and you know brother Brandon would be preaching and and brother Brandon was God's the The Voice God used for this day and age Elijah had his time Elisha had his time John joh the Baptist had his time and God chose brother brandom and and and to when we listen to that we realize it's God speaking to us not brother brandham speaking to us he had to yield himself he had to surrender himself he had to take that so we have to do it the same way and he's and he's telling because he would stand there he would preach the and just lay it out before the people and then he would say now if what I've told you is the truth he'll come and back it up but then he would wait he says you know what I'm waiting for it's him because brother man could not do this alone and neither can you and I and then all of a sudden he would say he's here and there's a complete different a change you know if if you all alone and you've got some maybe if you're you're one guy and there's three guys against you and they're standing front of you and threatening you all and and you you you want to take care of yourself but then all a sudden three or four your brothers show up right behind you and say we're with you oh boy all a sudden your chest gets up and say come on we're ready well that was brother Brandon he knew that alone he could not do it but with the angel of the Lord standing there nothing would could get past you you you can sometimes encourage yourself and just read some of the prayer lines just listen to some of the things he's saying there and watch God moving and he's the same yesterday today and forever he changes not he's he's speaking to one and he's talking about the that he goes that devil and that is crying out to help and the devil and that one over there he said why because God was standing there and then he turns around he says look he said the Holy Spirit just fell on that one right there and I know he catches somebody's thought and he says what the one that tells me there's sickness couldn't show me the Holy Ghost falling down it was the same it was God doing those things so here he's telling me he says look now he says oh dear precious brother sister please listen to what I've just said don't look at your disease you can never get well don't look to your Affliction look to Jesus he's the one he said you say brother brandom if I could rest assure that he was here if if I knew that he was here I'd be willing to accept him in every Power would you do that raise your hands if he was positive that he was here you could accept him just raise your hands all that say that I'm positive here well what would he do if he was here and God allowed over and over to be recorded for us to see it but that's not all it was going to be God brought it so that you and I could have the same experience because you walking down you at home you at work you wherever you're at if Christ in you and you're standing there and you're his mouthpiece and you're his hands and you're his eyes and it's the same as he's here now I can therefore Speak oh he said brother that's was for the brother brand no that's for every son and daughter of God and watch what Jesus says here when he does when he takes and he says talks about the Prodigal Son the one that was going to go out and if I understand the word prodical also ones who would go out and spend their riches foolishly it ties into that that's why he used that word so the father knew what the son was going to go do he was not surprised by it obviously the son had done certain things around the house that the dad knew you know as you're raising your children as my my mom and dad raised me they knew things that you know I would do and I learned things that they would do both ways it's how it is your co-workers you know their certain the way they lean to do it just as you get to know them so the father goes lets the son go knowing the son is going to get himself into some trouble but he didn't disown him but he has another son at home who never caused any trouble but he didn't have the best attitude as it came to show at the end so the Father Knows those things about us he knows the road you're going to travel he knows the steps you're going to take and he knows the lessons you're going to learn and you say Lord why did I have to learn him so hard because brother Lyall never had to learn him this hard and brother lyall's looking at at brother Merl and saying why the Lord why do you have to give me a heart brother Merl didn't have to learn him this heart and brother Merl will pass each one of us are the things we go through for one for each another you know but it's part of the body of Christ some of the parts of your body physical body feel more pain than others some are a lot more sensitive some a lot of part you you you hit yourself certain place and immediately you feel it some sometimes you hit yourself and you don't know you hit yourself do you see the SCAR or the bruise this part knew it got hit but this part didn't register but sometimes you're already feeling the pain when you're watching that that ball flying at you you know you're already feeling it you're so just it we're all different we're all part of the body of Christ so brother random says you know on that he's saying I'm positive he's here because God said so speak to the Rock and it shall give forth his water brother Braham says here it depends on what you look at if you look to your Affliction you'll never go any further but if you look at the promise of God you've got every right to every Redemptive blessing that God promised in his word is yours if you're good if you behave yourself if you meet I didn't say that they're yours I was thinking of the song brother Matt had to sing the last time he was here is um your grace still amazes me they're singing and one of the girls said Dad that's an old song and uh you know some of these songs we sing and yeah they were old they were written in the 80s that's so old you know but I was thinking how old is Grace when did Grace start it just thought that Pro that he was slain came from before the foundation of the world Grace was already working because that's what motivated him be like and I started go J if if you look at the pro you got every right to every Redemptive blessing that God promised in word is yours right the Christian always looks at the Unseen things every Redemptive blessing of God is unseen the here's the whole armor of the Christian love joy faith longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience it's all unseen forces that work in the heart of the believer amen that's right we look at things we do not see if we are the children of Abraham then we don't walk by sight we walk by faith for Abraham walked by faith and called those things which are not as though they were because God said so now I'll ask you personally you can answer this verbally with your hand raise yourself how many believes God said so okay how many believe God said so to you personally it's good for everybody but it has to be come right down to you personally because brother Lyle could enjoy seeing me eat I don't know maybe not he might want to eat with me but I'm just saying some people make food look delicious you watch them eat they seem to be enjoying it they're having a good time you're like man and and then other people are in a hurry to get done because they got to go do something they're just you know one of the young guys that I work with I remember his his father had passed away so it just him and his mom and Mom would make the same lunch for him every day and he was happy with it a meat burrito a thing of Kool-Aid a thing of salsa and a bag of chips and it was the same thing every single day we worked together for 10 years or more I never saw it change but he enjoyed it in front of me every time watch him he' didat just smile on his face and just good I was like man I've got to have one of those but it was him he was enjoying it there was another uh guy that worked with us and here's the two extremes he bought one big frozen pizza and he baked it and he took two pieces from that frozen pizza every day the cheap package of cookies the cheapest one from Walmart the 99 Cents took two of those and a glass of cool-aid every day and it never changed he didn't look so happy eating but he ate it one day I asked him he said the reason I do this is because my wife is back in Nebraska taking care of her mom I'm paying my house payment and their house paint me he says I got to save every penny I got that's why he was doing it he did it for his love for his mother-in-law and his wife not because he loved the cheap cookies and the sweet but my friend Joe loved the food you know but you have to have fall in love with God it's wonderful to see somebody else being blessed it's wonderful to see the joy of the Lord moving amongst the people and and sometimes standing on this side looking back either you're ministering or you're song leading or you're playing the music and you see the Lord moving it's a joy to see people praising the Lord smiling worshiping clapping it's you know just it brings joy to your heart but if that's all you're doing you're not getting too much out of it it's a joy but you need to experience that also yeah he said so God said so from the message Arius a secret believer now this one's a little long one we read it one night the disciples was waiting on him down by the seashore and they took off ahead they thought oh well we can make it anyhow we will go out into the sea and they rode off out and went off without Jesus now there's I skipped some portions so so just kind of short that's what's matter with a lot of families around here and everywhere else you think you can row across the sea of life without Jesus but you'll find out there there will be trouble in the little bark before you get too far you can't stem the tides of life without Christ he says there they was out but I love this oh my when I think of it now he knew they went off without him but you notice he climbed upon the hill and he watched them out in the sea and he seen the devil catch him out there in that little whirlwind and began to dash the boat up and down but his eyes was on them and he was watching for them maybe the devil has caught you out somewhere and he give you a disease or some sickness or your backslid or something like that but remember he climbed the ramparts of glory and setting on high His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he watches me he is from Everlasting to everlasting God he doesn't change what he did that back then he still doesn't the same you know he steps up and he watches you he sees where you're at he knows we're having the meeting tonight he knows how concerned each one of us are about it he knows your interest in him he knows your interest in the Kingdom he knows where your heart is so he watches over his word he gave the word and he watches over it you know my wife my wife likes to plant flowers and this time around around when she plants his little seedlings that come up in the plant them in the winter for spring and Asher and and Chloe helped her plant them you know and they get all excited about everything but saying she'll say oh I forgot to water them will you go water them for because she's watching waiting for that little sign of that little those buds coming out and once they started coming out you should see my wife how excited she gets now I don't get quite the same excitement that she does because I know I have to get in there and weed everything she doesn't want in there you know but it's part of of what we do but the joy of it and then when they begin to bear fruit and they begin to or flowers and and the grandkids come over and Chloe goes out in Asher and they go the flowers the yellow flowers red the joy of it to see that and God gets the same uh response to himself when he begins and he watches over where and he begins to see it grow in in you begins to see it manifest begins to see it flower the joy of it he makes sure he get water he makes sure the ground is good he makes sure that all the processes and nutrients are given to it why to bring forth that which that seed is he says and as the waters pushed on and while Jesus spoke and said be not afraid of his ey now he's he's out now on Peter said if it's you Lord give me just a little little test and ask and you shall receive Lord Try Me Lord test me I don't know how many actually say that but he'll I'll say okay but be like job and said I shall then come forth as gold he says you know and and ask and you shall receive and he gave him the test and when he tried to do it in himself he failed and every other man will fail he got his eyes off Jesus and he began to look how big the waves was and he began to see the waves were contrary and he began to sink and every man that will look at his Affliction after being prayed for is sure to sink you don't look at your Affliction you keep your eyes on the promise Giver the Lord Jesus Christ who never fails keep your eyes on his word he's the one who promise he watches over it to perform it he keeps it in the hollow of his hand in the depth of his heart heart it's bedded his words his words has to be true get your mind off your sickness off your trouble keep your eyes on Jesus boy that's a good quote to read but Lord help me to do it I put my hand up there Lord help me to do that you know you would say man brother Brandon was so inspired what a wonderful thing but go read some of the other quotes some of those things he shared about his own person personal life he was a man just as much as you and I were and he had to he yield himself surrender himself and say not my will but thy will be done now we take the scriptures here we read in in Corinthians 4:7 chapter 41 17 18 for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for it or as a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory when you can look past and look at the end results remember the the story that brother brandham relates quite often about the the young boys that were competing for that Schwin bicycle and I still remember when Schwin bikes were a name but as kids you wow he's got a Schwin bike that cost a whole lot more money than the one I got you know that was a brand that there was and brother bam uses that and he says and to ride up on that board cross over on the narrow plank without falling off and all the best Riders went first and they all fell off and the young man that they all looked at say he doesn't have a chance he made it to the other side so they asked him what was the secret you know how did you manage to stay on that plank he said I never look down at the circumstances I never looked down at what was going but I kept my eyes on the prize that was before me and because of that that did not have the effect on me that it had on you because you know when you start walking on a narrow path and you start looking down you start seeing how far it is and how far you could fall boy your confidence on that trail disappears like that but you watch some of those folks they walk right through it like if they were walking on a 10- foot wide path and they had a a chain hanging up from the side of the mountain and they seem so confident because they're not paying attention to the circumstances what how narrow the path looks to them but rather they're taking each step and going forward I remember we we came through Arizona in 1972 on our way back from a trip the dad took us on and we stopped to see the Grand Canyon and dad said let's hike it and I was 12 years old or going to be 12 that year and my younger brother so south rim we went down and we went all the way down to what do they call that g Indian Garden that's the Springs down there and that's about as far as I got and that was downhill still had to come back up dad and my brother went to overlook the river and on the way back up dad just said follow me I'll set a pace we'll walk quarter of a mile we'll rest for a bit we'll walk a quarter of Mile but watching different hikers going back up and some coming down ladies in high hills not recommended at all people that came down without water not recommended at all a young a young a couple young guys that took their mother down and she tired and they went back up and left her at the bottom um this all happen on that that trip we had um a gentleman older gentleman and his son with full backpacks and all and they came walking up and they went right past us just like if they were going downhill and we're going uphill so Dad offered and said you guys need some help we'll help you carry that and dad turned around goes no we started on the north rim yesterday and I think we can finish this rim and they just kept on going and I'm already thinking man I'm going to climb up on his backpack and let him haul me out you know and then there was two young girls and I would say probably college girls same thing and dad made the same offer you need some help and they said the same thing oh we started a way down 25 miles from here he said we're almost done dad say let's just make it to the next Bend let's just make it to the next Bend hey we got up to the top now ask me if I'll do it again probably not but where was your what was your goal what was your I set on what was the end result now I remember as we were making the last bends and I could see the end some strength came back to me that I hadn't found for the last three miles and I want wanted to run to the Finish hey we're almost there hold steady don't give up now just deny your own thoughts and say this is what God said this is what God says so again while we look not at the things which are which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal now let's just make an age comparison my dad's 84 I'm gonna be 61 my youngest daughter Rachel's 31 Chloe's four we all have different perspectives at the same thing dad's looking back at most of it now and saying hey you can make it you can make it I already been there I've got here I'm looking back at a lot but I still see some ahead of me and Rachel is about getting to the middle of it and looking at both sides and Chloe is looking at it says boy I've got a lot to go do we're all looking at the same path what's your perspective of it where are you on that Journey we ought to encourage one another brother sister I've been there God will was faithful he never left us he always watched over us he met every need come on come on let's put our arms around we we don't leave the wounded soldiers on the side we pick them up and we bring them with us says so the things which are not seen those are Eternal now we'll go to Psalms and out of this we'll do our scripture lesson tonight Psalms psalm 16 veres 1-1 David now we we know all about David's life because David wrote a lot about it he laid out his heart quite a bit laid out and even God speaks so much of David as a brother Matt Matthew spoke to us and he compared David and and Solomon David was a man after God's Own Heart but you and I looking at it from our side whoa aser made a lot lot of messes didn't he he sure made a lot of mistakes well so have I but great is his faithfulness when you think when he was there at Gethsemane and he's come now to what he was brought what to fulfill what he was born on Earth for that Plan of Redemption all that God had planned from before the foundation of the world the decision has to be made then will I or will I not father let this cup pass from me father is there some other way to perform to get this done without me having to shed my own life and shed my own blood but he said not my will but thy will be done and for me he was bruised for me he was broken for me he was ripped apart raise your hand if you know it was for you too for me he was he was as a scripture Isaiah says you didn't even recognize him he was so beaten I think it was brother Nathaniel Johnson the ones that spoke a few times and gave such a description of the whipping and the beating and the cutting the bruising and the breaking the part that he did and the father's looking at him and he's saying it's not enough yet it's not enough yet no 30 5 whippings would not be sufficient he would have to have every single one the blood would have to be shed every one of the scriptures would have to be filled before he said it is sufficient it is finished why for me for you every part of it he had already seen the scripture and David uses it here I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption so he had to he had that expectation that he had already said this destroy this Temple and I will raise it in three days speaking of himself not the temple they were looking looking at the prophecies and when he cries out it is finished he knew it had all been taken care of it was accepted in my stad and your stead so here David is speaking and he says in verse one preserve me oh God for in thee do I put my trust H for in thee do I take refuge in thee do I cast myself in thee do I let you have preeminence all of it Lord because I trust you I can't trust myself because today today I'm gung-ho and go and tomorrow I'm not or maybe right now I am and in the moment I'm no longer we can change quickly wake up in the morning feeling fine you wake up and you get a phone call and you get some news and boy your countenance change your heart breaks something happened you were expecting some good news You're Expecting but you get something opposite of that and suddenly changes but he never fails he says oh my soul thou H has said unto the Lord Thou Art my Lord my goodness extendeth not to thee David is saying here he says my soul thou has said unto the Lord Thou Art my Lord but nothing good have I done to return it back to you to deserve it as you look at some of the translations do some you realize some of the wording and I like to do that because sometimes you might think it's saying this but this is what he's trying to say and you know God allowed brother brandom to show us so many times he would say this is what but this is what God was telling and that's what the reason of the holy spirit in your life because he can tell you this is what I mean this is what I mean he says nothing good have I done to deserve this Lord there's nothing that you would say well I owe this to David because he's good at this David is saying I don't have that he says at all nothing to offer you that way outside of Here I Am Lord and God says come unto me and I will give you rest he didn't say come but you got to be holy you got to prepare you got to do this you got to do this you got to meet all these standards and then I'll know he said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden so you got troubles you got baggage you've got problem but he said come unto me anyways but to the saints that are in the Earth and to the excellent in whom is all my delight he said none of my good nothing that I have good to offer is for you Lord because you need it because it's the only way no but what he's saying but what I have done here what I'm sharing is for those who will read this who will hear this to the saints that are on the the Earth and in in my heart to do so but you know that's Christ speaking through David but David is sharing these words to encourage one my brother to lift up my brother to you know and and it's not to make God great he's great already we worship and adore him it doesn't make him greater in the sense no but it we are giving him what he deserved we are doing it you know in in appreciation to him that's what David is saying but to the Saints to my brother and my sister this is why I'm saying this is what I'm doing so they can be encouraged in it also and then he says this and it's a strange scripture to me right in the middle their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another God I wonder how David knew that by experience Maybe by watching what happened by seeing somebody else's life by going through it himself and brother Peter talked about some Gods lukewarm and cold oh I would never go serve a god like that or I would never go serve this God and put a you know a name I'd never go serve the trinity in him but what else have you put between you and God because that becomes a god what is occupying your time what is causing that to happen and not all of it is bad you got to go to work but to some work becomes their God you know I I I worked with enough people to to see that just it was never enough never enough I got to have that last dollar got to have that last dollar it was just never enough and you've heard this and I've mentioned it too never at the end of somebody's dying days they say oh my I spent way too much time with my family I should have been a whole lot more at work but you hear the other way around I spent way too much time away and not enough time with them he says their sorrow shall be multiplied that H hasten after another God that drink their offerings of blood their drink offerings of blood will I not offer and I I just want to bring that a little bit to our language will sweat have you've heard we'll sweat blood we'll give all our toils we'll give something but it's for our own good for our own benefit to get what we want and David said I won't do that I've tried it it's not satisfying nor take up their names into my lips now we could put the names of different gods there but you go down in your life and see what those names are in your life what are the things that occupy a lot of your time what are the things you know and and it it's to our shame a lot of this um there's uh people that you hear and you know and there seems like their Joy was to talk about their afflictions how much pain they were in how hard they were having how good it just seems like that's all they did they wanted your sympathy they wanted your sorrow they didn't really want healing though I don't know I think I would rather take my healing and end that conversation right about in I'm the Lord God that Health all thy diseases by thy stripes we ye are healed by my stripes he says and people get caught up in this and that and this nonsense and that he says look I won't take those names up I won't spend my time in that it robs me of my energy it robs me of my strength it robs me of my time it robs me of my family and it definitely robs me of my time with God he says their sorrows let's go to verse five now he says the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup I want God in all of that I want him Jehovah the Lord God Almighty and as and today our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ thou maintain my lot that which you have planned for me when you take my lot this is my lot this is what God has ordained for me this is the what David is saying you maintain it you care for it you take care of it you make sure it comes to pass you know we could look at that in the in the natural uh maintain your own lot keep your own yard clean you know we would look at it that way some do some don't but if you own this piece of property and you want to sell it you're going to spend some time getting it ready for sale he says he maintains us everything that he has for us everything about us and Us in it David is saying you maintain this it's not me you that which you saw for me that which you gave to me you will be sure that I get it another way he says it it's let me here he says let me get back to that here says so he said we should not be worried about tomorrow because God is our support and stability you're maintaining everything of us I don't worry about tomorrow I just live from day to day I don't borrow from his troubles hey today's got sufficient not look for tomorrows H the lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places God has given you a portion he's divided it if could I say just like he did it with the tribes of Israel they had their portion they have place he says God maintains or the lines of following are in a pleasant places God has for you every good thing and then he saysi have a goodly Heritage he says the places Fair are the places marked out for me I have a noble Heritage nobility that which belongs in the Royal palaces when we think about somebody Noble we usually talk about the Kings and the queens and all of that that goes around with that nobility you know um and and he's a king of kings he's the Lord of Lords and you're his wife you're part of the bride of Christ David is saying I have a goodly Heritage all that God has promis I Will Bless The Lord I will give him honor I will give him glory I will exalt him in all of this he says who ha given me counsel and I really like this he has given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night Seasons my thoughts you the the word the Reigns is is is then there is his thought he says he says um when you look at the night season as I was reading that thinking about it how many times has God woken you up with something putting something in your heart giving you a good dream answering you a question placing a scripture placing a song I know he's done it for me many of times even this afternoon I was after I got home from work I was resting and just some songs came to my heart just I wasn't saying about but they were part of my thinking process and it reminded me of the scripture he says the Reigns or the thoughts the action you give me good ones you allowed that to happen you know because you can get caught up in your own thoughts and the fear of it all but David is saying he says you also instruct me in the night SE even while I'm sleeping the dreams and the thoughts and the impressions and in The Nearness of God around you how many times has he done that for you he says I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved right hand refers to strength an anchor a solidness he says I Look to Him First in all things not third not second not forth okay Lord now I've got some time for you I had to get all of this done and this done and this done first okay Lord now I got some time for you and then you realize this and this didn't work out or had you looked to him first he might have said leave those alone they won't be good for you he says Look to Him First on all things in every situation and in all circumstances Look to Him First Lord I commit this day to you I commit my thoughts I commit my actions whatever it's going to be I commit it to you first Lord I remind myself and I even brother bam says many times he loves to re be reminded of his word he loves for you to challenge him God you said and he says I did watch me do he says so you commit it to him you give it to him first all my plans all my ideas all my thoughts Lord Lord I need to go through bring them through this first do they fit within this or are they outside of the God's work I have these ideas I have these Ambitions I have I have this I like to do and there's nothing wrong with that brother brandham tells us he says plant your crops do the things you do like he's not coming for a hundred years but live like he's coming today unfortunately most of it goes the other way they live like he's not coming for a hundred years but only plann for one day you see the failure and the opposite of what God wants us today because he is your strength he is amen and then in verse n he said therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh shall also Rest In Hope even when God puts you at peace even this part can be at PE you take what God's word says about you and watch when you begin to confess what God says about you because you can start confessing the opposite I don't feel good I hurt I'm tired I'm weary nobody likes me and boy does the mood change quickly you know it's we laugh about it but you know they say at the football game and the person that went to the football game had this this little thing about nobody liked him everybody had something to say so as soon as they huddle up it gets that idea that the Huddle they're talking about him now we laugh about it but if we're not careful we can get ourselves into that place oh that person that that person walked right by me didn't even say hello they must be upset me and then next thing you know you're upset and the person the next time you see them they say hi I haven't seen you in a while maybe their mind was elsewhere when they you know was one of the things I'm standing at the door and people are coming in saw it all the time some would come in God bless you brother and it's good to see you others walk right in the door without a word and the next time they came in hey good to see you brother and how you doing you know I could be hurt or I could just say God bless you brother good to see you too what was your action what was your we had a brother that was helping us and I told him I said one of the things you're going to need to learn as you as you start to help us is you're going to hear things and you're going to find out things and you're going to see things about others and you have to be bigger than that I said because they will happen those things do happen and you know I I as as you guys know I'm one of the most serious person you ever met I think I even laugh at my sleep sometimes but there was a sister coming in and we got along fine and she was coming in with another sister at the door and I won't say the names but neither one are here so and I opened the door for them to come in and um the sister in front I looked back at the sister behind her and I said sister if this sister hadn't been here with you I would have never opened the door for you and she knew me already she just started laughing the other sister around turned around and she surprised me she goes oh brother give it to her just give it to her she deserves it we had a good laugh but there's others that I would have never done that to because who knows how they would have reacted and brother Peter was just a young boy brother Jerry was helping back there also myself and brother Jerry brother Al Peterson was kind of coaching us just just teaching us you know being a mentor to us brother Peter's I don't know four or five years old maybe and brother Jerry had him back there and there was nobody at the door and brother Jerry goes now he said Peter son I need to show you he says when they come up to the door just at reaching push it back and they'll fall over and he started saying all these things and I've never seen this sight of brother Jerry and Peter I remember Peter's face he's looking at his dad like are you serious father and I'm standing and Jerry has just got the straightest face and he's talking about he's I want to put all of it because somebody might get mad at brother Jerry for what he said and and he's saying all these things and right about then a real big brother one of the bigger Brothers of the church come walking up and I reached over and I opened the door and as he walked by I told Brother Peter when a brother this size is walking you don't do anything to him because he'll throw you out the door himself and then brother Jerry started laughing he go brother you've never seen that sight of me have you I thought it would be fun for Peter you see a lot of things you hear a lot of things how are you going to react to them how are you going to do again here's therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh shall also Rest In Hope Lord I seen these situations but I'm looking at what you said I'm looking at what you've given to me and in that will I even this man will be satisfied right in that he says and then he says this now we know Christ was going to fulfill this for thou will not leave my soul in hell but you know what I have that same promise to me neither WIIL thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption Paul says it this way so when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory de oh death where is I sting oh grave where is th Victory because he did it for you you have that promise and this is what David is saying my heart rejoices in this job looked at it differently the first book written in the Bible job looks at it a little differently he says I've see the the flower come up in Spring I see it grow through the summer and in Fall it begins weather and in Winter it dies but I see it come back up in Spring and he speaks of the leaves he speaks on but what happens to man I've seen them put in the grave over and over and I've never seen one rise again there is a Resurrection coming and then job cries out something in job cries out I know my redeemer liveth and with these eyes eyes I shall see him we're looking at thou will suffer not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption you are part of him when he died you died when he arose you arose you can take these scriptures and apply them to yourself I love it where Paul says oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory then he says th thou will show me the path of life for in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand are Pleasures forever more you will make clear to me the way of life if he's sitting next to you if he's living in you if he's with you and you've got questions you got something you understand and you talk to him he can make it clear he can make it plain Jesus says father I thank you for hiding this from the wise and The Prudent those that think that they could do it on their own by their own understanding by their learning by their books and have revealed it to babes such as would learn who would say teach me Father show me father let me see it your way he says you'll make it clear where you are Joy is complete when you're filling down when you're filling without Joy take a quick inventory where is God in this because if he's with you there should be a joy there does that means you don't suffer does that mean you don't have pain no but Paul I Paul says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me because where he is is joy in your right hand or in in your strength in all that you that's the the right hand is speaking of the power the glory nothing can defeat the right hand of God there's Pleasures forever and ever all that he imagined all that he desired all that he wanted for you he's accomplished he will do show the thought deny your thoughts and take God at his word Lord I I'm struggling through this but your word says you're my strength you're my help Lord my body is is going through a hard but by thy Stripes I am healed Lord my mind is a a in a turmoil but you said you're my peace you're my joy Lord I I I I'm I'm having trouble getting along but you said love covers a multitude of sins Lord and your love is in me you said because of your presence in me I can love another one if if perfect love as brother Bram talked about perfect love and he talks about that and he's talking about walking across that that pasture and that bull comes out and he said something in him took over the situation and spoke to that bull and that bull rested down on him is he not the same yesterday today and forever what about a situation at home what about a situation between a brother and a sister a husband a wife a mother father and children sometimes they can get hard sometimes they can get tough but let the love of God L because it's Christ in you already take over that situation you know I I say this to my shame but it was a lesson to be learned I had preached a message on love and fear had preached a couple of them this was some years ago and we were talking about having the love of God and when it's fear and this you know that's Satan's work because God doesn't work with fear Fe God works with through love but love is corrective love can be strong love can be gentle you know brother bam talked this way you know Johnny's playing in the middle of the street and the cars are coming Johnny get out of the street oh because I love him so much I don't want him to get hurt at my yelling well get him let him get run over by the car it would show you really didn't love him that much brother R said no you would go out there You' grab him you would drag him in out and I thank God he's done that to me at times when he's reached down and taken Me by here and dragged me out of that situation because he did love me he does love me he cares for me but other times it's just a sweet gentle word where he tells you he loves you you let the love of God and and and I had i' preach that you know and brother green head said some things to me when I just first started ministering and he's encouraging me and and helping us to grow in this and and he said brother Aaron he goes he just told me goes that was a masterpiece he said but I will tell you there all won't be masterpieces sometimes you'll struggle through a sermon you'll feel like you didn't deliver it so I was encouraged and then that very next week a situation came up at home and my reactions were not good and I regret to say I put my hands on one of my daughter and I threatened her and right about that time that message came ringing right back through me what did you just preach I opened the door I went to the house and I took off down the road crying saying God I failed and God said no you didn't I put you to the test and now you've learned now you learn God puts you to a test because he loves you because he cares for you because he knows you are gold he's not looking for gold gold is in you he's going to bring it out and who what is gold it represents God it's Christ in you the hope of glory deny your own thoughts say Lord I'm not going to I'm not going to rest on how I'm thinking right now I'm going to rest on what your word says in fact I'm going to take your word and open it begin to read it over this I'm going to go to Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures you know he he prepares a table in the presence of my enemy surely goodness and mercy shall follow me that's God's word he says I will not leave Thee I will not forsake thee Lord I'm feeling alone but your word says and I'll take it but your word says over what my thoughts are and I would say Lord help us if the musicians would make their way up I would say Lord help us to say no to what is contrary to the word of God and say yes to the word of God at all times brother Bram says as quick as you can catch yourself and make it right because we do at times get ourselves into trouble but he said don't let it linger don't let it go on as quick as you can catch yourself and say I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry let me take what you said let me turn my heart at what you said let me meditate on the things that have life in amen Lord help me I put my hand up Lord help me to be that way all the time let me take you at your word let's bow our head lord it's it's hard at times to deny our thinking to deny our thoughts to deny our desires because they're not all bad sometimes our thoughts are are Pleasant our heart's desires are good and we we enjoy that time Lord but Lord sometimes we're resisting we're fighting we we're trying to tell you Lord but but Lord the way I'm thinking is how I really feel but you know that Lord but you said to confess your word your word will not return void it is not in effective if I confess my ailments and my pains and that's what I I I give life to but if I can confess Isaiah 53 if I can confess greater is he that is in you if we can go back and said it's deity in us she is Mrs Jesus Christ the word of God tells us that then this flesh can be put into subjection for greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world Lord in our times in our Hard Times Lord let us look to your word let us comfort oursel with
