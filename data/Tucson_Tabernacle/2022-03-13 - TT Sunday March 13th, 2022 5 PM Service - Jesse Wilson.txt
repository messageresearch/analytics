him throughout eternity and throughout eternity i'm going to praise him amen but think about philippa sometimes it's hard after an hour to sing but you'll never exhaust the praise to god he's going to be worthy of every bit of it you can't even think in those terms but that's what it is it's going to be every time you just look turn and look at him oh lord you're worthy oh lord i love you and you're going to see your brother and sister and say the same thing oh brother sister i love you the same too it's good to be in the house of the lord today amen so we had announced that brother jesse wilson would be with us and he brought his security guard escort caretaker um oliver brother eliaser is always good to see you god bless you and i'll go and give you a little plug if that's okay he's a good mechanic too [Music] and uh for a small field give you his phone number now he's helped a lot of brothers out i just recently found out of the work he did as a mechanic and then as i heard oh yeah he helped us he helped us so that's good that god puts those gifts in the body of christ to help one another if he'll stand with me our brother jesse wilson i had asked him i mentioned to you so quite some time ago possibly when i heard he was ministering and participating and helping out and i said so he uh he said he would and he talked to brother caleb and brother caleb said maybe i should better get a little experience under your belt and i thought that was good i think because he wasn't hardly nervous at all when he walked in so that's a good thing so i just know that god saw this day he said he has part of a testimony sharing some things that god gave to him so if he'll pull and draw god will minister to us so amen amazing grace how sweet this in oh amazing [Music] grace how sweet the sound for it saved her rage like me i once was lost one more time amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved [Music] i once was lost but now [Music] amen god bless you tonight it's real privileged beer tonight thank you musicians i'm not going to sing and they already probably know that i don't know keys so i just sing whatever i can and try to make a joyful noise to lord amen before we get started i got a little bit of a testimony to read and then just a little bit of a thought i want to talk about tonight but if you'll bur if you'll turn to your bibles to john 14 12 and then we're going to go to matthew 12 25. surprising i'm actually talking a little slow usually i'm really really really fast an hour long sermon usually takes me about five seconds so try to make it a little long but not too long tonight amen amen john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and the greater works than these shall he do because i go into the father unto my father amen excuse me let's go over to matthew 12 25 amen and jesus know their thoughts and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand amen just pray for a moment please dear heavenly father i have notes in front of me and every time lord i get to talk about you lord i don't want to talk about me i don't want to talk about basically my life lord before meeting you the lord i am standing here as a testimony once again follower to say you are truly a wonderful god and i am eternally grateful to you lord for the opportunity lord to talk about you and father you saw me in a state lord that you knew i couldn't get out myself but an amazing grace you had lord to me and thank you father once for again for saving me so lord as i begin to talk about you lord please be in every aspect of the service lord for your honor and glory lord what i'm here for in precious name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated now our church is a little small and i'm used to a lot of noise so if you say amen hallelujah it's not going to deter me if god determines to take over the service and we start worshiping that's all fine i'd rather you hear from god tonight and not for me amen let me get my handwriting over here brother ellie's here i'm telling you this is this is terrible i gotta get my laptop and start typing this stuff up again let's start with a testimony i guess we said skip all the part right like when i was born and all that stuff we need to skip ahead a little bit okay we don't have that much time so 18 years old i moved out on my own i moved out of my house and i lived on my own but every night i remember when i was living now i'm wearing purple sometimes it means power but i'm going to be very transparent is that okay you're going to hear a lot of things that you're going to look at me and say he did what he did those things i can't believe he was that bad of a sinner that prayer i just said that was from my heart and there's others that will testify that i was a worldly guy okay i came to this church my grandfather was the pastor here everyone knows that but i'm not just one of grandsons i'm seven of his grandsons amen but the only times i remember coming here was a young kid when i used to sleep on the pew but ever since i was a young man 18 i've been on my own and since 18 to about 27 i didn't attend church about two times i think i came here once to see my my grandfather or my grandmother sing me a song and she reminds me that she sang me a song and i don't remember it so see i'm telling you that's how bad i was i was not ready to serve god i was not ready to be in the house of god i was not ready to be of service to god amen so i joined at 18 i went right in the military it was like 18 and then four days before i turned 19 i was in boot camp because every night in high school when i was living on my own my own house remember i'm not with my parents i'm on my own paying my own bills every night i was doing the things that worldly guys teenagers tend to do everything mom and dad tell them not to do everything that will get you in trouble i was pretty much chasing after that but every night there was a loneliness in my heart thinking going out there and i remember looking at the the full moon no moon stars asking god i know you exist but why am i here if i'm doing all these wrong things then why are my still breathing right now so i kept looking for a purpose but as you heard the scripture i said a house divided will fall so how can i be doing what the devil wants me to do what i thought was a great life but yet now on the other side over here i'm saying god will you help me a divided house amen so i went into the military i didn't know what to do my cousin's like let's join the military let's have a purpose let's go be the best we can be amen so i said okay let's go do that so i went through basic training went through ait got in the normal army i know there's some military friends here so you know exactly what we're talking about here soon and my whole purpose in life was military everything i did was to be the best i didn't want no wife i didn't want no kids my purpose in life was to travel the world train with the best and become the best i felt really short of that but i tried i tried my best i still don't like running two miles but i tried amen but after eight years those two mile runs every monday morning but after eight years three deployments i thought everything i was doing good i mean i've been around the world about seven times kind of sounds like my grandfather but he was doing a better purpose than what i was mine was something that was a great purpose but it was for the government it was for you it was like i had a purpose and if i died that's the contract i signed amen that's what my purpose was so i thought i was happy but eight years three deployments later i saw friends committing suicide overseas overseas in the war zone now i'm single not married no kids like i have nothing back at home so if i'm dividing the purpose i have a purpose that's what i keep focusing on but when i started seeing that happening i'm like something is not right there's not going to be a military tangible ptsd and everything but i started realizing that someone started talking to me that maybe this is not what you should have been doing maybe eight years of what you've been doing there's another optical illusion that i got that i thought i was doing that i thought was the thing to do but after i saw that i got out it took me over a year to try to be a person again when you're in the military and you have someone always want to know where you're at your hair cut is your beard trim like this would get me in trouble i mean i even trimmed it a little bit but i like having a little beard your hair touching your ears like you had to be on point all the time so when i got in the military for a year it was really hard for me to me to understand that i'm my own person now i can do whatever i want but remember i said back in high school before i won the military i just fell back in the trap again i thought i was gonna be happy again doing the same thing i was doing eight years prior it took me over a year before i realized that something is still not right after a year of doing what i wanted i tried school i tried college if i cried it's okay don't worry i'm okay it's just you know they're always here unfortunately kids if you can avoid the things your parents are telling you there's a reason so you don't have to keep remembering this stuff and won't come up to badly especially when you're trying to tell everyone about your testimony but after that i tried scuba school i tried college i try to do whatever i thought was best i was on the verge of going broke all the money i couldn't accumulated was about to run out about to lose my car i don't have a house remember i'm still on my own i'm arguing with my mom i'm arguing with my sisters they're trying to give me help i'm telling them words i'm not going to say but you get the thoughts i'm a 27 year old man trying to tell them i still know better than you please hold your peace it wasn't until i was about to lose everything that i moved back here because i was like i'm gonna lose everything at least my family is putting up with me and all the stuff i was going through and during that time i went through college i was able to get a good degree but then i hit what's called transitional depression as you know my grandfather died i broke up with someone i was dating with and i also moved from an apartment to a house now it doesn't sound like a big deal but when those three things hit you at once it's called transitional depression so i was in the house doing whatever i wanted living out in miranda i had no accountability i'm still doing what i want to do still trying to figure out why am i unhappy i have pool league i have a nice car i have a house i have i thought i had the world of goods i i thought i was doing good again but i'm still sad it wasn't until a young woman invited me to church again worldly i'm going to be completely transparent and i told her you need to stay away from me because i am not a guy you should talk to interact with because the thoughts that i have are not what you think is going to happen if i start coming around and going to church i'm not going to go any further than that okay all right but they kept inviting me to go to church kept on vitamin church i'm like no i don't want to do that my life is happy but at home it's not so after that depression really hit me i'm like i'm not gonna go to church it's not gonna happen it got down to one day after my grandfather passed i'm at home after work and i just sat there and i made this confession because i was thinking about going to church and i said lord if you do not act on the scene right now if i go to church and nothing changes that gun i have with the bullets in it that will do the job i'm going to use it you hear what i said i was going to end it i have a car a home i have a life i thought was good but yet here i am telling god first off i'm telling god what what i'm gonna do like i'm threatening god first off again that's just a true confession i said if nothing changes i will end it and there's no one that's going to stop me because there's no one at home to stop me my family's not involved i go to and from the bars i go wherever i want i can do this anytime i want so i tried i came to church one time to here but transitional oppression with another profession now coming here remembering my grandfather is not here hit me like a ton of bricks so i went back home and i was like god nothing happened here we go but then my phone rang and my mom says hold on why don't you go over to amazing grass tabernacle just try it one time and that's when i met the brothers from the church and brother caleb duron now i know brother cable was here again i didn't know the back history i didn't know all that she said he was just a minister with her grandfather just go talk to him see if he can help you now you know his past is testimony i'm gonna leave it there and just say the first words he said to me after service was i'm not better than you i am you i was like what do you mean you're a pastor of a church like you're a shepherd like you go to church and then i started talking to them in a while on basis talking to the brothers i'm like what did he mean by that so god put someone in my life that had gone through the same worldly life doing what he wanted almost exact same age like our life stories are so close together it's pretty scary the things i was doing the things that he was doing we wanted to do whatever we wanted to but we both knew that there was something inside that needed to change so we're seeing amazing grace that is a lot of people just seen that song just to sing that song but there has to be grace there has to be a god because he knew i was going to end it so i felt led to get re-baptized so now a change is starting to happen to me but i want to tell you honest truth i was still not living right even though i'm starting to attend church i'm still doing that i'll call the bars what i still wanted to do on sunday i'm a good guy but when i get home i'm not who you think i am sitting next to you in the pew there's a lot of times that i'm still repenting over that thinking i knew better when i went to church doing the things i was still doing being around some of you bringing that spirit in but now i've learned that spirits on me could have jumped to you so i apologize to you if you ever met me and you thought something bad it probably wasn't you it was probably me carrying around that luggage because i didn't know how to repent so brother caleb and me talked and at the time we were redoing the bathroom so i started coming around and we were redoing the bathrooms of the church and he made a comment because i want to get re-baptized he's like well it's a long walk from the church like basically from his office get baptized over to the fellowship hall it's probably if you haven't been over to our church it's probably from this front step maybe to that back wall it's really not that far but something inside of me because i had a longing to get re-baptized i said jesus walked further than that for me startled he was like first off he was like where'd that come from and i was like i don't know but it was inspiration because i knew remember when i was talking to god the same time slowed down god i need to change or i'm going to end this this is still here so when we got to get baptized i think there was three that day it was i think everyone had their camera out because they knew i was struggling they knew i was going through something and everyone saw me walk into the water and it all hit me at once they prayed a prayer and i left it all there in that baptism every pain every hurt all of this was just overflowing because i got baptized here's one before but i did it for a different reason so if you need to recess what we call it that's what i went through i went through a reset because i was getting serious about god there has to be a change in me there has to be service to you because everything else i've tried doesn't work everything got better everything than god just wonderful life changed nope why because i got baptized i confessed like it says in the scripture i confess that jesus christ is my lord and i asked him for forgive me and then i got baptized but what was awaiting me at home was the old habits and the life that i knew that when i got home i had a certain time of when i was gonna do things when i was gonna crack a beer open when i was gonna play video games do everything else still not reading my bibles still not paying attention to guys still not giving them my time but remember i committed with my mouth to god saying i will serve you i asked him to forgive me so that i can serve him i said i am yours lord i am yours can you put up that uh the sermon quote by brother branham when i was preparing the notes for this i just preached on this a couple weeks ago but i didn't know again how wonderful i still know i know how wonderful god is let me back that up i didn't know that when i read this um at the church how now i can tie this in and say i wasn't serving god so why weren't things going right watch what he says you ready we're going through three fast this is uh what's the one title of it yeah i have heard but now i see it's 65. she says now the sick people that's in the building they're crippled people or you have a need of god when you can get that type of revelation that you are justified when you are actually justified in asking the thing that you're asking for and believe he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him seek after him there's nothing can ever separate you from the faith that's anchored to you see but first it has to be revealed to you someone come not long ago a group of men some of them listening in tonight and told me said i kept telling them go to kentucky there's oil down there i knew it was i had seen it in a vision well brother is it demos demas is that i say right okay huh dms okay demons excuse me and them didn't go for a long time after a while finally they said after texas had moved and they said now we're going down i said you ought to have went a long time ago but they didn't do it he said i made a great mistake in that by not doing that brother branham i said if you had went down there you'd have had it all well they wouldn't listen to it then the first then for then before we left that night the place where we were having lunch the holy spirit showed me a great crack in the earth and then that was full of oil and these overflows in kentucky was just a little beads beds of oil that were pumping from but this one came from the mainstream and i said better demos it's there so they went to searching for it said go down and tell us where where the oil is i said oh no no no see we don't use the gift of god for commercial no no we he could tell me where it was at but i don't have any need of it i wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him see if i had need of it i believe i'd ask him he'd had he'd enough to ask or sorry skip that he'd tell me but first you see your motives and objectives have to be right now that's not my testimony remember my testimony was lord i want to serve you but then i started doing the things i want to do still but see he wrote i had made a commitment to god and this right here struck me when it said that no we don't use god's grace we don't use if he gives you a gift for your own purposes even though brother i'm saying if i had asked for it if i knew i needed of it then god would deliver it amen where was i but first you see the muslim judge had to be right you have to have reasons for this god don't give you those things just because you have just because you ask and you cannot ask in face unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of god see if you want to be well what do you want to be well for see if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling god what do you want to do with your life when you get healed see there's got to be you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of god and then there's and then when the faith is revealed to you and god by summer and grace places that faith in there then it's over see now see i read that because then i started realizing i didn't know about brother brenham i didn't know about his tapes i didn't know all about that but now here we are six later six years later in service of god that i preached about this and now i'm giving you a testimony i'm like well duh if i'm not doing what god wants to do if i'm not doing as well of the lord then how can i expect things to go right so let's jump back back in the past again so i started doing the things i wanted to do again so i went out i'm doing the things i want to do and then i got busted by the law because i was doing the things i thought was right yet i confessed that i was a christian going to church and i was doing what i thought that god what god want me to do how many times i've heard a lot how many times have you heard someone well i'm just going to bar to be a testimony listen to the greatest battle ever fought he covers that you walk into bars you walk into those clubs gentlemen clubs i'm not going to explicit but you think going to those that you think you're going to make someone's life change in there you really better know what you're doing and god better tell you that you need to go those places because that fight that you're about to get in is going to be overwhelming because i can testify to it so i got in trouble man that's not fun those fines the court dates lawyers all that stuff that had to get involved and man did i feel stupid going back to church because here i am i just got baptized here i am testifying god's good but i'm now in jail you know and having to go through all the legal procedures even after this the brothers were like they didn't give up on me they said hey there's a camp coming up they've had testimonies there let's why don't you go with us and just get away for a while let's just see you know what will happen so i said sure whatever i have to lose i've already embarrassed myself i've already crushed basically the testimony that i just had now i'm in a bigger fight of my life so i go to the camp up there was it white mountains yeah hebert that camp went up there in that camp with her brothers and i'm looking for something the whole way up there i'm driving on temporary license the whole way i'm driving up there and i'm asking him how do you find god how do you find the holy spirit how do i get close to god and by the time like three hours in there to like brother austin he's like will you just stop and i'm like what he's like i think you're looking too hard so we get to our cabin i'm thinking about what he said he's like it's not going to be the same for you as it was for us what god will do for you when you seek after him is going to be different than the way i experienced it so we took a nap we went to that night service and 300 kids i think it was filled i've never been to something like that before a whole church event before so we get there and me and ellie's here is in the front and there's kind of like a sadness on the camp you know because these are new kids coming in and they're getting pulled they're getting pulled to the worldly ways instead of going to christian ways and brother caleb miller look at me and they're like this something's not right we have to energize this we have to talk like we have to talk we have to be basically the pillars like we need to praise and worship god so that's what we did the entire time the kid gets up there preaches he's like what is it going to take for you to be serious with god one of the brothers from phoenix i think it was b3 at the time it was b3 i'm in the very front see about right here he comes from all the way from the back because you can feel something's moving but again i've never felt the spear before i've never been for the holy spirit i didn't know at least i didn't know i had been filled before if i did as a kid but he walks from the back to the front just seeing his hands up something sparked to me and i was like i want that whatever is calling on him right now in front of 300 people because remember i'm military trained i'm special op trains i did everything you think of the military did with some of the most elite forces and now i'm going to stand up in front of 300 kids at church service that's a pillow swallow because i had too much pride but seeing that surrender caused something to stir inside of me saying that's what you've been chasing so brother caleb says who else is going to stand up and i was the second person down on my knees or at least between the tears that's all i could tell was that i was on a bench just crying out to god so brother caleb is talking about it and there's more just coming up to altar he says who wants the holy spirit raise your hand he also asked some other brothers will you go touch your friend if they're here to get filled with the holy spirit i'm already on my knees i can't even i barely can barely breathe you know i'm a mess let's just say i'm a disaster i'm a mess but this is a good disaster this is the surrender of my life that i have been looking for for months testimony from my brother over there he said that when he came up to me and brother came up asking the holy spirit and i put my hand up i actually touched his hand he said i was freezing cold sounds familiar doesn't it i'm pretty sure there was a prophet that lived that my grandfather testified of his testimony that when he walked up on the stage that he stepped into something that felt like a freezer and the prophet told him that won't hurt you because it won't right don't be afraid it won't hurt you so someone inside me says i love it when you can relive that moment something hit me i was so cold that the next five hours i can't remember what happened we're singing spanish we're speaking in english i don't know what they're saying but we're in so much worship there's so much love that you can't tell what's going on we are going around praying for every person there is asking to be touched we are touching them i'm even praying for our pastor praying for others i'm getting prayed for we're so like just filled the holy spirit is going around there that hundreds of kids got delivered that night that was my first holy ghost experience we even got back in the vans and we drove all night i think eliezer was on one van and i was in our van and i was so filled so happy so like that's what i have been looking for was that joy because it wasn't in the world it's not in the world i can tell you it's not money fade popularity all stuff is not going to make you happy but when you get sincere with god and you make that commitment to surrender to him and this is not a one-time thing every time i have to be reminded that when i go to church the mortgage the rent all that stuff all that stuff needs to be in the past i can't bring that in the church because the spirit that i'm looking for i want that touch again and again and again and again so after that let's get through stuff really kind of quickly me and i'll start talking i'm still i think i was better wasn't i don't know maybe just a little bit better a little bit better i thought i was still doing better and i saw my family go after trial after trial after trial and i'm like why is this happening and i went over to the petersons for dinner most times we had those conversations me and brother arne has conversations at dinner table i'm like what are we missing why when we are laying our hands on people why when we're praying for people why are they not what's not changing sister was going through cancer for years even twice now she's passed away but why so i got along with god a couple weeks ago you've heard hadassah my wife's testimony that she got to the point where she couldn't even walk she fainted a couple times i had to catch her put on the couch i'd take her to the hospital because we're praying for her but we didn't know like what is going on here so i got in my truck and sister rachel and grace and lily they all came over i can't talk highly enough about them about that family they came over almost every day for days because we have a little baby boy and i have to work from home i think i drive everyone crazy when i do that but they came over and prayed with her and they were making us dinner and they're doing everything they can to be a supportive family they have family across the country praying for him and i'm sitting there being like what am i doing wrong i'm a husband i should be able to lay my hands on her she should recover right now what am i missing so i got in my truck our truck her truck if she asked you it's her truck her truck and i went out and got along with god and i was like that's i wasn't like where that came from excuse me i asked god i'm about to preach tomorrow night my wife's at home what am i doing wrong i'm missing something that's where this thought came from okay let's go to matthew 15 21-28 i don't know what time it is but i promise i'm getting close it just started okay we go back to when i was born yeah no okay gotta have fun when talking about god it's just you gotta have fun you gotta really just being transparent with you has helped me a lot and thank you guys for accepting all my past and baggage and everything i brought along with me so matthew 15 21-28 it's all right yes yes then jesus went hence and departed into the coast of tyre incident and beheld behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried on him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievely fixed vexed with a devil nice one but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me do you see what's happening right here canaanite is a gentile we're gentiles she's talking to the creator in human form saying lord i have need of you and he's saying i am not here for you to me that's just being honest that would kind of deter me a little bit like okay he's not going to help i've heard everything about him but now he's not going to help me but watch how she keeps going but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus entered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour he didn't go to her house he didn't lay hands on her daughter all he said and think about this it's the word saying the word that what have you asked for will be given to you because of your faith amen next one matthew 8 5-13 is there a tissue side effects of crying and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him centurion as all know this story right very famous story besieging him is saying lord my servant life at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus said unto him i will come and heal him so now jesus is saying to a gentile i will come and heal him this is the wonderful part ready watch this the century answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should have come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed amen keep going right the 13 for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he'd do with it when jesus heard it he marveled and he said to them that follow him verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel and i say unto you that many shall come the east from the east and from the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out in our outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou has believed so it be done unto thee and his servant was healed in a safe self same hour do you want one more i'm glad you asked didn't ask but i'm gonna say it anyway john 4 46-54 jesus came again into the cana of galilee where he had made the water wine side note on that everyone know that scripture we made water into wine did he touch the water he didn't huh interesting and there was a certain old man whose son was sick at capernaum when he heard that jesus was come out of judea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death then said jesus unto him except you see signs and wonders you will not believe the mon the nobleman said unto him sir come down here my child die jesus said unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth of course we're going to ask when then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the selfsame hour the fever left him so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and then himself believeth in his whole house this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judea into galilee he didn't go their houses he didn't lay hands on them they just believed what they had heard about jesus and what he the authority he had to be able to speak the word and they would recover do you know who else did that do you know who's famous or who's famous who's familiar with the three squirrels oh i saw some light bulbs go off gotta remember that story can i share it with you this is the last thing and he thought well how could it be remember he's out in the wilderness he's supposed to go meet some other brothers for lunch but he said how could it be because the lord's telling them if thou speak this mountain shall be removed and he's thinking on that scripture lord tells them i thought well how could it be he said i said he said speak and it will be that way don't doubt it and i was talking to somebody setting way on the woods no squirrels been there for three days there's no squirrels there and i was sitting in a sycamore thicket squirrels don't even come anyone that hunt scrolls know they're not in sycamore and i had been sitting there and wind blowing real hard about the 10 o'clock in the morning and i was thinking again and it said you're hunting and you need squirrels just the same as abraham needed a ram i thought that's always told me the truth but this sounds funny and i got it from there i was sitting looked around where is that person that was talking to me nothing wind is blowing real hard and i thought could i have fell asleep and dreamed that no i wasn't asleep i was setting up against the tree there watching supposed to pick up brother wood and brother satman back there just in a little bit around 10 o'clock in the morning farmer was all out there working gathering corn i heard again say you were hunting unique game how many do you need and i thought now i don't want to overdo this who's done that you need something from god you're like lord i just need this much sometimes we just remember that we need to ask for exactly what we need because the god that created the heavens earth with his fingers and his hands he has everything you need of amen you're hunting your game how many do you need i thought now i don't want to do this i'm just going to ask for three three squirrels i want young three red squirrels i want them he said then speak about it i love it and i said i am going to get you three young i'm going to get three three young red squirrels he said which way will they come really so you're asking for three squirrels and lord saying well where are they gonna come from now he's being very specific right what a test of faith that is right there well i thought i went this far there's something talking to me here just the same as you hear me talking and god in heaven with this bible over my heart knows that's the truth and he said i s and he said and he and i said well i picked out a ridiculous place an old dry limb hanging out over there about 50 yards where my rifle was shot in i said the first one will be right there and there he was i rubbed my eyes and looked back i turned my head and thought i don't want to shoot a vision so i looked around the game and there set the squirrel i threw up through throw it up a throat i throwed a shell up in my gun aimed up and i could see his black eye young red squirrel i thought i might be i might be sleeping i'll wake up in a few minutes see i'm dreaming about this well i leveled down shot the squirrel and it dropped off the limb i thought well i don't know i thought well should i go over there and look for it and i walked over there and there it laid i picked it up and blood ran out of it a vision don't bleed you know so i picked it up and it was a squirrel i got real numb all over and i looked around and i said god that was you i said thank you for this now i'll go out and so lord he gave me one squirrel i'mma and he knew it was real he thought i was sleeping he found out it's a real squirrel amen he says i'm done but here the next part he said this is god telling the prophet but you said wow do you doubt what you said you said you get three now where the next one come from i thought well if i'm dreaming i'm gonna continue on so i said i picked up i picked out an old post over there off a tree that was all wrapped up with this here poison ivy you never get a squirrel in that so i said the next one will come right out of that poison ivy and there sat down there sat that young red squirrel looking right at me i set my gun down rub my eyes turn around again i thought there he sat turned his head sideways i shot the squirrel and then i started going home not just once but twice he's trying to leave but here comes the lord here comes god saying you said three do you doubt what you said i said no lord i don't doubt what i said for your confirming this is the one scripture has taught me not if i say but if you say now if jesus said it but if you say it yourself wow and i thought somehow i've broken into that channel and i know he's here because i'm almost beside myself i thought is it up there now this is my favorite line right there 149 and i thought someone broke into the channel and i know it because he's here because i'm almost beside myself this is my favorite part i thought i'll make this one ridiculous so god is honoring his word that he spoke out and now the prophet is challenging the lord saying let's see how far god can go which we've already testified god can do everything as long as you believe it amen she says i'll make this one ridiculous sure enough now i gotta find out my notes i said there'll be a red squirrel come down off that hill come right down this way and right by me and go out and sit on that limb and look down there at that farmer that is very very very specific if you said that and that happened with testimony right so here he goes he came down the hill went right out and sat and looked at that farmer and i shot him but of course here comes the devil saying said to me you know what the woods is just full of them now and i sat there till 12 o'clock and not another thing happened it goes to show that when god he's the very creator of the heavens and the earth so every time i was challenging god saying if you don't act i'm gonna do this if you don't do this i'm gonna do that how wonderful is mercy to look past all my human side i was trying to think of a polite word but so when i give you this testimony and i'm wrapping up now that's just another testimony saying that i have been far side doesn't matter left or right away from where god wanted me at and somehow not because i'm perry greene's grandson not because of the military service i did not because i was saving peoples around the world not because of anything i did but it was god knew a long time ago that there was going to come a point when jesse needed him to act and when i needed him to act he kept faithful to what he said so that i can say the same jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the same jesus that my grandfather saw the holy spirit that was in the prophet that some of you saw is the same god same holy spirit that you just sing songs about and did we talk before service i think you did three immediate songs when you came out was about the holy spirit wasn't it two or three i don't take coincidences when i'm back there writing these notes in my chicken scratch and i'm talking about i knew he was gonna finish up talking about the holy spirit and then this young man comes out here and starts singing about the holy spirit that's not a coincidence to me that is god saying no matter where you go or testify i'm still going to be the same jesus that you're relying on every day to stay alive matthew 18 19 again i'm saying to you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that you shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven so when we spoke for hadas healing when the hospitals didn't know what they were doing well i shouldn't say they're doing when they didn't know what was going on and they had theory after theory and everything kept on getting delayed and every time we pray saying lord we can't wait three months we need to happen now we lord we need answers now lord can you act on the scene appointments guy moved up to two days her white blood cells started going up but they hadn't done anything yet so i knew that when we were speaking her health when everyone was believing saying lord your word said we ask that you'll heal her we ask lord that we're in service to you lord be the same god today now she's walking around she just drove up to prescott she's with my wife my son up there having a blast visiting family but now we're just cancelling appointments because they can't find anything wrong with her that's a testimony amen there is a song i want to sing but i think i'm just going to turn the servers back over you brother but there's that song that says something keeps holding me now every day when i'm getting battled and now that i have spoke this now twice i know i'm going to be challenged i know the devil is going to come after me because he's not happy that we are so close to going home he knows so close that he's about to lose everything that he's going to fight every single one of you every single one of us doesn't matter where you go to church doesn't matter your longtime believer or short time believer like me or i should say short term believer six years like me he's gonna fight you just remind your mind let these words soak in ask what you will you need god to battle this battle for you ask it it's not going to be too much for god so thank you for your time i really appreciate and love you all i just want to say it's been an honor to speak here as thank you for the opportunity to go so god bless you all [Applause] [Music] something keeps holding me something keeps holding me every day [Music] guiding me constantly [Music] something keeps holding me and you know what that something is that's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and you know i just heard just a little portion of it i didn't know most of this but something in my heart said there's a testimony there and this was before sister hadas is healing there's just something of the change that god can make in somebody's life you're going 100 miles in that an hour that way and he'll turn you around and he'll bring you back home because you're one of his and i would say to you brother and sister who has a daughter a son a child a sister a father a mother that seems like there's no hope all you just heard about a god that is the same yesterday today and forever and can turn a life around and bring them back you ought to be able to believe right now you'd ought to say lord i can speak your word and you'll bring it to pass whatever it is [Music] he's not a god that has limits he's not a god that says well no wait a minute i got to research that again is that doable brother branham tried hard to make it hard for god god took him and said just speak just speak just speak what it'll be brothers i'm running your son you can speak what you want he's still god he doesn't change whatever it is that you need god for he can do it if you can believe it don't be afraid to confess it don't be afraid to speak it i know my testimony [Music] sitting there elk hunting and that same voice began to speak to me and say you're here for something you're here for something and my reaction was that was for brother branham that was for brother random three times i told god that was for brother brent but i'm glad that he said speak what you need amen and i did the same thing i said up on that hill up there let it come out let it come down let it run right from here and go back i turned around and there's the elk right on the hill and that's where i shot him and the other elk that was with him ran down and ran right in front turn around and ran back and it was about two hours later to realize exactly what i asked for i got amen he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen amen what do you have need of this statement what do you have need of oh but that's really not that important really then why is it in your heart why are you desiring it why are you asking for it if it's important enough for you to desire it to want to draw closer to god then it's important enough to ask brother joe what is it that you want you can ask god and he'll meet you he's the same yesterday today and for i challenge you to believe it you know brother branham said the holy spirit spoke to him and said beware of these three things said women popularity and money he said that's a trap but he never told him you can't ask for anything he said just beware of that don't go in that direction look for that which would profit the soul him walking through oral roberts of the university there and he's looking at it and he's saying my you didn't have enough confidence in me to give me this and he walks out and god says no i gave you myself he says i am your portion which would be better which would be the best of it all to have god the creator of it all that would say speak when you have that character you would speak nothing a mess oh what a mighty god we serve could you just believe that right now brother bobby rourke was here one time [Music] and i believe it was sister johnson sir lois who had had been dry had never had saliva in her throat and brother bobby spoke to her right here in the fellowship hall and she said it came so hard i was drowning me the saliva i had gout in my left foot and he said stand up on there and that part that hurts you move and talk to god i was standing about where sister barbie yarbrough is and i did that i never had pain there again he's still god he's the same yesterday today and forever if you can believe say i will i will ask and i will believe it oh just whatever it is you have me lord you this tester i i didn't know what it was going to be lord but you placed it on my heart there's somebody here lord that has got that faith today that's taken hold of and say lord i will ask i will speak what i have need of lord and then begin to praise you and worship you and thank you for it lord lord let your just be that faith lord whatever it is that someone needs today lord we appreciate that lord in jesus christ's name amen how many appreciate that today oh to be re-encouraged that he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever [Music] too bad sister green couldn't
