[35:45] way nobody has come here to listen to
[35:47] lyle johnson if if i'm the person that's
[35:49] speaking lord we should just shut off
[35:51] the microphone and get back to singing
[35:53] but lord we want to hear from you so
[35:56] lord i just pray that you'd help me to
[35:57] be a channel lord that your thoughts
[35:59] could be expressed tonight in a way that

[36:05] lord jesus we're gathered here to

[36:14] our soul and lord tonight i can't help
[36:16] but think of the problems that are
[36:18] happening in ukraine and pray lord that
[36:20] we have brothers and sisters over there
[36:22] lord they're not only there we've got
[36:24] brothers and sisters in belarus and in
[36:26] russia lord and throughout europe and
[36:28] lord it's not just our brothers and
[36:30] sisters but the human suffering that's
[36:32] going on lord i pray that you would
[36:34] have your will and all of this
[36:37] we thank you in jesus precious name amen
[36:43] please be seated i'll have you stand up
[36:45] again to read the opening verse but i i
[36:48] just you know my heart this evening is
[36:50] heavy because of what's happening in
[36:52] europe
[36:53] it's nothing new
[36:55] dictators and despots
[36:57] make war wreak destruction cause havoc
[37:00] misery every generation or so in every
[37:02] part of the world
[37:04] such evil has occurred throughout
[37:06] history in america we're often isolated
[37:09] from these events we send our soldiers
[37:11] overseas to keep the wars over there so
[37:13] they don't come on our shores
[37:16] we see about
[37:17] what's happening in ukraine and we think
[37:20] oh my this is so sad
[37:23] and then we switch off the news and
[37:24] think what are we cooking for supper
[37:26] tonight we go on with our lives
[37:28] but the people there can't switch it off
[37:31] they have to live through it
[37:37] but we have to remember
[37:39] we're in satan's eden
[37:41] what we're witnessing are the fruits of
[37:43] sin
[37:44] of unbelief
[37:46] but it doesn't make them less painful to
[37:48] endure
[37:50] we're often reminded to look up
[37:52] to expect a rapture
[37:54] a carrying away of the faithful
[37:57] that will witness the resurrection and
[37:59] shortly after slip away
[38:03] but it's much more than a last-minute
[38:05] rescue or evacuation plan
[38:07] for us to avoid the unimaginable
[38:10] physical
[38:11] spiritual psychological toll for those
[38:14] who remain on earth and the midst of
[38:16] what we call the great tribulation
[38:18] we need to ensure
[38:20] that our motive
[38:21] for being a part of that is pure
[38:25] it's to be with the lord not to escape
[38:28] destruction
[38:30] we must have compassion on those that
[38:32] suffer
[38:33] this evening i want to encourage each of
[38:36] you
[38:37] as well as warn you and remind you
[38:41] please stand with me now as
[38:43] we read tonight's topic verses we'll
[38:45] read two passages together
[38:48] first from the gospel of luke
[38:51] chapter 4
[38:52] starting at verse 25.
[38:56] the setting is nazareth in a synagogue
[38:59] on a sabbath
[39:00] being handed a scroll jesus has just
[39:02] read from isaiah chapter 61. everyone's
[39:06] waiting for him to comment on this
[39:07] reading
[39:09] it may have been the expected reading
[39:10] from the prophets with what's called the
[39:12] half torah on that particular sabbath
[39:15] or not we don't know i i was unable to
[39:18] find it being part of any half torah
[39:20] reading in modern jewish liturgy i i was
[39:22] looking to find out what time of year
[39:24] was this
[39:25] but regardless
[39:27] it's what he did read to them that day
[39:29] now you've got it in the king james in
[39:31] your hand i'm going to read this
[39:32] particular couple of verses in the niv
[39:36] jesus is now addressing that
[39:37] congregation he says
[39:39] i assure you
[39:41] there were many widows in israel
[39:44] in elijah's time
[39:46] when the sky was shut for three and a
[39:47] half years
[39:49] and there was a severe famine throughout
[39:51] all the land that extended beyond the
[39:53] borders of israel
[39:56] yet elijah was not sent to any of them
[39:59] not any
[40:01] not one not even one of the many
[40:04] suffering widows in israel
[40:06] instead where did you elect you go
[40:09] but to a widow
[40:11] and zerefat
[40:12] and the region of sidon
[40:15] to a foreigner
[40:16] and a foreign land
[40:19] well let's read the account that jesus
[40:21] was referring to if found of course in
[40:23] the old testament
[40:25] jesus bible
[40:26] the tanakh
[40:28] please turn in your bible to first kings
[40:30] the 17th chapter and i'll use the king
[40:32] james version to make it easy to follow
[40:35] and this portion is a bit lengthy so
[40:37] please
[40:38] feel free to be seated
[40:44] the context is this
[40:47] elijah had recently declared a drought
[40:50] that would last three and a half years
[40:53] he'd been living next to a small brook
[40:55] called terret a tributary of the jordan
[40:58] ravens had bringing been bringing him
[41:01] bits of food to eat
[41:02] but now
[41:04] due to that very drought the brook and
[41:06] dried up
[41:07] let's join elijah there
[41:10] the word of the lord
[41:11] came unto elijah
[41:14] saying arise
[41:16] get thee to zeraphat which belongeth to
[41:18] zidane
[41:20] now that's in modern-day lebanon
[41:23] it's well outside the boundaries of the
[41:24] portion of canaan that was
[41:26] prescribed to the
[41:28] uh to abraham
[41:30] and dwell there
[41:32] this isn't a short visit this isn't a
[41:34] weekend meeting you're going to have
[41:35] there elijah you're going to live there
[41:37] for a while
[41:38] behold
[41:40] i've commanded more ravens
[41:42] no
[41:43] no i've commanded a widow woman there
[41:47] and there's no indication that this
[41:48] wooden woman was jewish
[41:50] if you recall
[41:52] jezebel
[41:54] was a daughter
[41:55] of the king of this same zidane
[41:58] and she was married to ahab
[42:01] the king of israel
[42:03] behold i have commanded a widow woman
[42:05] there
[42:06] to sustain thee
[42:09] he's spoken as if he's already commanded
[42:11] this widow woman but we find out in a
[42:12] couple of verses she didn't seem to know
[42:14] anything about this
[42:17] so he arose
[42:18] and went to zarephath i'm going to be a
[42:21] while here please go ahead and take your
[42:22] seeds
[42:24] well where is theraphat where is zeiden
[42:27] oh well here's a
[42:28] map this map gives us an idea of the
[42:31] distances
[42:33] it's a journey of at least 80 miles from
[42:36] that brook
[42:37] to
[42:38] sidon it's probably more like a hundred
[42:40] if you're not being carried by a raven
[42:42] and have to go on the ground
[42:44] elijah had to travel across it by foot
[42:48] in a hot
[42:49] dry
[42:50] dusty place no uber
[42:53] no buses
[42:54] no chariot or donkey
[42:56] walking alone
[42:59] at least four days probably six or more
[43:03] and he was the guy
[43:04] that most people blamed for that drought
[43:08] and for that famine
[43:10] after all he'd called for it and that
[43:12] was the official government position
[43:14] king ahab called elijah the one who
[43:16] troubles israel
[43:18] when they met at the end of the drought
[43:20] so as elijah journeyed the people he
[43:22] encountered were probably not very
[43:25] friendly
[43:27] they didn't physically attack him
[43:30] they realized he was the only one that
[43:32] could end the drought
[43:35] and when he came to the gate of the city
[43:38] behold
[43:39] the widow woman was there gathering
[43:41] sticks
[43:42] small dry branches from parched trees
[43:44] good kindling
[43:46] easy to burn thanks to that drought
[43:49] and he called to her
[43:51] now
[43:52] he must have looked a sight
[43:54] trudging through a hundred miles
[43:56] without a bath
[43:58] tired
[44:00] sore
[44:02] dirty
[44:03] smelly
[44:05] scruffy at
[44:06] best pitiful really
[44:09] he called to her and said
[44:11] fetch me i pray thee a little water and
[44:14] a vessel that i may drink
[44:17] throat dry
[44:19] voice scratchy
[44:20] pat hadn't rained in a long time water
[44:22] was precious
[44:24] and here's this widow woman gathering
[44:26] sticks not somebody gathering them for
[44:28] her not even her son
[44:31] maybe he was too infirmed to help
[44:34] or too weak or too young
[44:37] she may have been fairly young herself
[44:39] perhaps having lost her husband to the
[44:40] effects of that very drought and
[44:43] subsequent famine we we don't know
[44:47] and as she was going to fetch this drink
[44:51] probably taking pity on this
[44:53] half dehydrated stranger that's asking
[44:56] for help
[44:57] he called to her and said
[44:59] and bring me please a morsel of bread
[45:02] with that water in your hand
[45:06] bread
[45:07] water
[45:08] jesus identified himself with both of
[45:10] these
[45:13] and she said
[45:16] as the lord thy god
[45:18] notice she knew of the god of israel
[45:22] but did not identify him as her god
[45:25] or our god
[45:27] as the lord thy god liveth
[45:30] i have not a cake i don't have any bread
[45:33] but a handful of meal in a barrel
[45:36] a little oil
[45:38] in a cruise
[45:39] and and look i'm gathering just two
[45:42] sticks here
[45:43] that i may go and dress it for me and my
[45:46] son
[45:47] that we may eat it
[45:49] and die
[45:52] and elijah
[45:54] acknowledging her desperate plight said
[45:56] unto her fear not
[45:58] go and do as thou hast said
[46:04] but make me thereof a little cake first
[46:07] and and bring it unto me and after
[46:10] make for you and your son
[46:14] she might have rolled her eyes at this
[46:16] point
[46:17] how coarse and unfeeling
[46:20] to demand from the last morsel
[46:23] from a starving widow
[46:26] he's treating her a bit like a servant
[46:28] or a slave seems to be dismissing her
[46:31] need
[46:32] in favor of his own
[46:34] i can see her drawing her breath getting
[46:36] ready to lash out in some manner why why
[46:38] are you the very nerve but but before
[46:40] she could object he goes on to say
[46:44] for thus
[46:45] saith the lord god of israel
[46:47] the barrel of meal shall not go empty
[46:50] neither shall the cruce of oil fail
[46:53] until the day that the lord sends rain
[46:55] upon the earth
[46:58] talk about a test of her faith
[47:01] and obedience she's being asked to risk
[47:04] everything
[47:05] i think of the widow tossing her mites
[47:08] in the temple treasury
[47:10] she decided that she and her boy were
[47:12] going to die she was at the end of the
[47:13] rope she'd given up hope
[47:15] but it's still an act of supreme faith
[47:18] in the word of a prophet who had called
[47:20] the drought
[47:21] and thus the famine in the first place
[47:24] and now she
[47:26] is being asked to help him
[47:31] i think she may have felt a bit like
[47:32] ananias in acts 9
[47:35] he was told to go pray for saul's
[47:37] healing
[47:38] the very guy who had caused so much
[47:40] trouble
[47:41] to the believers in jesus
[47:45] probably while he was celebrating with
[47:46] others that the lord had struck down
[47:48] this menace to the faith an answer to
[47:50] their prayers to stop this demon of a
[47:52] man hallelujah thank you god for
[47:54] answering our prayers shutting down this
[47:56] man's soul praise god
[47:59] you can be sure they were praying for
[48:00] that
[48:01] and what does god tell him
[48:04] i want you to go help him
[48:06] oh no no i don't want you to just help
[48:08] him i want you to heal him
[48:14] well
[48:15] let's get back to elijah
[48:19] and she went
[48:21] and did according to the saying of
[48:23] elijah notice he said go make something
[48:25] for me
[48:27] and bring it to me
[48:28] and then go and make something don't
[48:31] make something for all three of us
[48:33] right
[48:35] so what happens
[48:37] she does that
[48:39] and what happens when she goes back
[48:42] there's more meal and more oil than
[48:44] there was when she left
[48:48] he and her house
[48:50] did he many days
[48:53] uh oh
[48:55] can you imagine the gossip
[48:58] that nasty israelite desperado elijah
[49:01] fleeing prosecution from his government
[49:03] he's moved in with the widow larkin
[49:05] they're shacked up together in her late
[49:07] husband's house how shameful of them
[49:10] both
[49:11] right people are people
[49:13] reading on
[49:15] the barrel of meal wasted not
[49:18] neither did the cruce of oil fail
[49:20] according to the word of
[49:22] elijah no
[49:24] no the word of the lord which he spake
[49:27] by elijah
[49:29] it wasn't elijah's word
[49:32] it was god's word
[49:34] spoken through his prophet
[49:36] somehow
[49:37] she recognized it
[49:39] she might have heard of elijah
[49:42] but probably never met him before had no
[49:44] idea what he looked like he didn't walk
[49:46] up and say here's my here's my id here's
[49:48] my driver's license check the picture it
[49:50] says right there elijah tishbyte right
[49:53] no
[49:54] no
[49:55] she he didn't have any picture id she
[49:57] had no idea who he was from from a
[49:59] wanted poster that might have been in
[50:00] the post office or something
[50:05] there was no facebook posting
[50:08] these are sobering verses
[50:11] not ones that make you want to jump up
[50:12] and shout or dance or cry for joy they
[50:15] portray human misery
[50:17] suffering
[50:19] and
[50:20] god's seeming hardness
[50:22] to ignore the plight of so many of his
[50:25] chosen
[50:26] the sons and daughters of israel
[50:29] instead
[50:30] he sends his prophet to help
[50:32] and be sustained
[50:34] by a gentile
[50:37] of the people
[50:38] of the hated jezebel
[50:43] consider the situation in elijah's time
[50:47] elijah was commanded by god to invoke a
[50:50] drought ultimately lasted three and a
[50:52] half years
[50:53] they didn't have deep wells
[50:55] no irrigation pumps
[50:58] no grocery stores or frozen food lockers
[51:00] no container ships plying the waters of
[51:02] the mediterranean to bring food to them
[51:04] from distant lands no desalination
[51:07] plants no railroads no 18 wheelers on
[51:10] interstate highways
[51:13] we've not experienced famine in america
[51:15] in our lifetimes
[51:17] the temporary shortages of some foods
[51:19] and other supplies in our supermarkets
[51:21] at the onset of the pandemic
[51:23] we're nothing
[51:24] we really have no concept
[51:27] of how devastating such weather extremes
[51:29] were
[51:30] for an agrarian society largely based on
[51:34] subsistence farming
[51:36] we're only just now starting to
[51:38] experience the first of a crescendo of
[51:40] calamities due to weather extremes as
[51:42] the earth's climate changes
[51:45] floods and drought brother dan right
[51:48] wildfires hurricanes
[51:50] tornadoes
[51:52] for these people
[51:54] and these were people
[51:56] they're not imaginary these are not
[51:57] fictional people from a storybook or
[51:59] some character in a hollywood movie
[52:02] these people it was a period of extreme
[52:05] hardship
[52:07] sickness
[52:08] death
[52:11] jesus audience was familiar with this
[52:13] sort of thing they existed under the
[52:15] oppressive heal of roman occupation
[52:18] and he reminded them that shabbat of the
[52:21] story of elijah and the widow
[52:24] now remember ahab was a wicked king
[52:27] there was widespread idolatry and lack
[52:29] of faith in god at that time
[52:32] and notice though elijah had been
[52:34] sustained probably for well over a year
[52:36] and possibly as many as three by the
[52:39] miraculous wheat and oil through that
[52:41] widow
[52:42] he despaired
[52:44] that he was alone in israel
[52:47] maybe the fact that she was a foreigner
[52:50] helped feed that despondency
[52:52] we soon find him hiding out in a cave
[52:56] let's read from
[52:58] first kings 19
[53:00] familiar passage
[53:03] we read and it was so when elijah heard
[53:05] it
[53:06] heard what
[53:08] a still
[53:10] small voice in the midst of earthquakes
[53:12] and winds and all sorts of things
[53:16] he's in this cave so he wraps his face
[53:19] in his mantle
[53:20] and he went out and stood at the
[53:22] entering into the cave
[53:24] and behold there came a voice unto him
[53:26] and said
[53:27] what are you doing here elijah
[53:30] having a pity party are we
[53:33] and and he said
[53:35] i've been very jealous for the lord of
[53:38] posts because the children of israel
[53:40] have forsaken thy covenant
[53:42] thrown down thine altars
[53:44] slain thy prophets with a sword
[53:47] i
[53:48] even i only am left
[53:51] and they seek my life
[53:53] to take it away
[53:56] well the lord responds to elijah gives
[53:58] him directions what to do to anoint
[54:00] certain guy to be king and so forth
[54:03] and then
[54:04] skipping down to verse 18 he gently
[54:06] reminds him of something something that
[54:08] he just may not have been aware of
[54:10] yet i have left me
[54:12] seven thousand
[54:14] in israel
[54:16] all the knees which have not bowed down
[54:18] to all
[54:19] every mouth which hath not kissed him
[54:24] i want us to consider those seven
[54:26] thousand tonight
[54:28] that's the title of tonight's message
[54:30] the seven thousand
[54:33] they were faithful to the lord
[54:35] they kept his word in a time of apostasy
[54:39] in the midst of false teaching
[54:42] compromise
[54:43] idolatry
[54:45] with the government
[54:47] led by ahab and jezebel whose policies
[54:49] encouraged them to leave the faith
[54:52] of the bible it's a book of fables and
[54:55] contradictions
[54:57] and instead
[54:58] to pursue pleasure
[55:00] if it feels good do it
[55:02] forget lent it's carnival time very like
[55:06] today
[55:07] here
[55:09] in america
[55:10] in tucson
[55:12] yet these faithful ones
[55:14] had to endure the drought
[55:17] brought on by the apostasy of the nation
[55:19] of which they were apart even though
[55:21] they had no say in the matter
[55:24] they lived right
[55:26] they did right
[55:27] they worshiped the lord
[55:29] endured scoffing
[55:32] ridicule
[55:33] persecution
[55:35] didn't elijah list among his complaints
[55:37] that the nation had slain the prophets
[55:38] and torn down the altars
[55:41] yet somehow
[55:43] these had survived or at least 7 000 of
[55:46] them did perhaps there were more for
[55:48] some had passed away perished through
[55:49] that three and a half years
[55:52] we don't know
[55:54] we're not told
[55:56] but we can be sure
[55:58] there was widespread disease
[56:00] suffering
[56:01] misery
[56:03] despair
[56:04] and death
[56:06] and added to all of that was this
[56:08] drought
[56:09] this famine
[56:10] no rain meant no crops
[56:13] no crops meant no harvest
[56:15] there was no preceding time of plenty
[56:17] there was no joseph storing grain
[56:20] no food
[56:22] death by starvation
[56:26] can you hear them crying in despair
[56:29] god
[56:30] why are you doing this to me i've kept
[56:33] your word
[56:34] i've held my head high in the midst of
[56:36] all this idolatry why am i being
[56:39] punished
[56:41] why did you command your prophet to seal
[56:43] up the heavens lord i'm so hungry
[56:47] my wife and children are starving what
[56:49] have i done
[56:51] how can i appease you
[56:53] david said he'd never seen the righteous
[56:55] forsaken remaking bread but lord i am
[56:57] begging you for bread
[57:00] help me god help me
[57:03] i can hear their cries they're real
[57:05] people
[57:06] it's not realistic to think that the
[57:08] seven thousand somehow avoided suffering
[57:12] that their plots of land miraculously
[57:14] had rain and their apostate neighbors
[57:16] did not
[57:18] they weren't in goshen they were in the
[57:20] land of promise
[57:22] they were obedient to the lord
[57:24] and they were suffering
[57:28] we sometimes think of abraham's pleading
[57:30] for lot in sodom
[57:32] i imagine they did too in genesis 18
[57:35] abraham said oh let not the lord be
[57:38] angry i will speak yet but this once
[57:42] maybe ten will be found there
[57:45] and the lord said
[57:46] i will not destroy it for ten's sake
[57:50] and the lord went his way as soon as he
[57:52] left communing with abraham and abraham
[57:54] returned unto his place we know that the
[57:56] lord rescued four
[57:57] there weren't even ten
[57:59] there were four yet he pulled them out
[58:01] before destruction fell
[58:04] and here we're not talking about ten
[58:07] or four
[58:08] we're talking about seven thousand
[58:11] but abraham's ten
[58:12] speaks to us of the of the of the
[58:15] rapture of the catching away being
[58:16] pulled out of the destruction the final
[58:18] destruction that falls on our planet in
[58:20] a baptism of fire but elijah 7 000 i
[58:23] think speaks to us today
[58:26] of our present time of the church ages
[58:29] of what we often refer to as the last
[58:31] days the time that leads up to that
[58:33] rapture
[58:35] let's turn to ii timothy
[58:37] chapter 3
[58:40] paul's telling timothy this know also
[58:44] that in the last days
[58:46] perilous times shall come
[58:48] men shall be lovers of their own selves
[58:51] covetous
[58:52] posters proud
[58:54] blasphemers
[58:56] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[58:59] without natural affection truce breakers
[59:02] false accusers incontinent fierce
[59:05] despisers of those that are good
[59:07] traitors heady high-minded
[59:10] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[59:12] god
[59:14] having a form of godliness but denying
[59:16] the power thereof
[59:19] from such to turn away
[59:22] and we know we're living in those very
[59:24] times that paul warned of
[59:26] not just of a general unsaved population
[59:28] but also among those that profess to be
[59:31] part of god's family
[59:33] and not just here
[59:35] but not just now
[59:37] we believe we're in the last the seventh
[59:39] age of the church
[59:41] we have no idea how long that age will
[59:43] last
[59:45] it could end before our service
[59:46] concludes this evening
[59:48] it might go on for years
[59:51] or decades
[59:54] no one knows when
[59:56] brother branham expected 1977 to bring
[59:59] the end
[1:00:01] other places he expressed that he
[1:00:02] believed would never see the conclusion
[1:00:04] of the 20th century
[1:00:07] so the point
[1:00:08] isn't when
[1:00:10] it'll happen when god deems it to be the
[1:00:12] right moment he doesn't owe us an
[1:00:15] explanation
[1:00:16] he doesn't need our approval
[1:00:18] so then what is the point
[1:00:21] the point is that we
[1:00:22] need to always be ready
[1:00:26] weren't those words brother green's
[1:00:28] final admonition to us the last dream he
[1:00:30] shared with us
[1:00:32] be ready
[1:00:35] be
[1:00:36] ready don't get ready
[1:00:38] for the rapture brother while
[1:00:41] certainly
[1:00:42] but also
[1:00:44] for our final breath
[1:00:47] whenever that may be meanwhile
[1:00:50] expect testing
[1:00:52] character building
[1:00:53] and evaluation
[1:00:55] but aren't we in the last days aren't we
[1:00:57] told the rapture could be any moment now
[1:00:59] yes
[1:01:00] yes and i believe we're very close
[1:01:04] but there's a balance to that
[1:01:06] the church has always been in the last
[1:01:09] days the day of pentecost was in the
[1:01:11] last days as peter quoted joel regarding
[1:01:13] the infilling of the holy spirit
[1:01:15] acts chapter 2.
[1:01:18] jesus disciples
[1:01:20] tried to pin this time down when they
[1:01:22] asked him recorded in matthew 24
[1:01:27] and as jesus sat upon the mount of
[1:01:29] olives
[1:01:30] the disciples came unto him privately
[1:01:33] saying tell us when shall these things
[1:01:36] be
[1:01:37] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:01:39] and of the end of the world
[1:01:42] i wonder why human nature is such that
[1:01:45] we always want to predict tomorrow
[1:01:47] what's the weather going to be tomorrow
[1:01:50] we're told one of the strategies of
[1:01:52] satan is to get us
[1:01:54] and despair about yesterday
[1:01:58] or be so worried or focused on tomorrow
[1:02:02] that we do nothing today
[1:02:04] the serenity prayer of alcoholics
[1:02:06] anonymous comes to mind god grant me the
[1:02:08] serenity the peace to accept the things
[1:02:11] i cannot change
[1:02:13] like yesterday
[1:02:15] the courage
[1:02:16] to change the things i can
[1:02:18] today now
[1:02:20] and the wisdom
[1:02:22] to know the difference
[1:02:24] so the disciples
[1:02:26] were just being human
[1:02:28] they wanted an inside track on the
[1:02:30] future when will these things be
[1:02:33] what did jesus reply
[1:02:36] what were the signs
[1:02:38] deception
[1:02:40] wars rumors of wars famines
[1:02:44] disease
[1:02:45] earthquakes
[1:02:47] persecution
[1:02:49] betrayal
[1:02:52] things that have always been as long as
[1:02:54] humans have been on planet earth or at
[1:02:55] least as long as there have been more
[1:02:56] than three
[1:02:58] in other words
[1:03:00] life will simply continue until it
[1:03:02] doesn't as it was in the days of noah
[1:03:06] that's why he says it comes as a thief
[1:03:08] in the night
[1:03:10] regarding the when
[1:03:12] he told them
[1:03:14] of that day and hour knoweth no man not
[1:03:16] the angels of heaven
[1:03:18] but my father only
[1:03:21] i couldn't tell you because i don't know
[1:03:23] and he says a few verses later watch
[1:03:25] therefore
[1:03:27] be ready
[1:03:28] for you know not what hour your lord
[1:03:30] doth come
[1:03:32] now the disciples were persistent
[1:03:34] after the resurrection and just before
[1:03:36] the ascension they asked him again
[1:03:39] and he told them again acts 1 6 when
[1:03:42] they therefore were come together they
[1:03:45] asked of him saying lord will thou at
[1:03:47] this time restore again the kingdom to
[1:03:50] israel
[1:03:52] and he said unto them
[1:03:54] it's not for you to know the times are
[1:03:57] the seasons
[1:03:58] which the father
[1:04:00] had to put in his own power
[1:04:02] not just the day or the hour but not
[1:04:04] even the times or the seasons
[1:04:07] that's why things didn't end in 1977
[1:04:10] that's why we're here in the 21st
[1:04:11] century
[1:04:12] it's why all christians from the
[1:04:14] apostolic days until
[1:04:16] us assembled here this very evening have
[1:04:18] been convinced the lord jesus return in
[1:04:20] their lifetime
[1:04:22] i'm not saying that as a scoffer i
[1:04:24] believe that he is coming soon
[1:04:26] and he's certainly coming sooner than he
[1:04:28] was in their day
[1:04:30] but going back to matthew 24 with all
[1:04:33] the warnings and indicators in his reply
[1:04:36] to their question of when
[1:04:39] jesus put it this way
[1:04:41] therefore
[1:04:43] because these signs these events that i
[1:04:45] just described to you are ongoing
[1:04:48] be he also
[1:04:50] be always
[1:04:51] ready
[1:04:53] for in such an hour as you think not
[1:04:55] the son of man cometh
[1:04:58] in other words knowing the signs of the
[1:05:01] end doesn't actually prepare you for it
[1:05:03] according to jesus it'll take you by
[1:05:05] surprise if you're alive when it occurs
[1:05:07] the ye that he's speaking to
[1:05:10] are his closest followers
[1:05:12] his disciples
[1:05:14] the very ones who asked and to whom he's
[1:05:16] addressing his reply
[1:05:20] are you one of his followers
[1:05:23] if so then jesus is speaking to you he's
[1:05:26] speaking to me here and now in this
[1:05:28] verse
[1:05:29] therefore
[1:05:30] be ye also ready
[1:05:34] we must always be ready not
[1:05:37] just preparing
[1:05:39] we should be about our father's business
[1:05:43] we should be redeeming the time
[1:05:45] dying to self
[1:05:47] loving one another praying
[1:05:51] worshiping
[1:05:53] gathering together
[1:05:56] but notice
[1:05:58] he included a promise to us in all of
[1:06:00] this
[1:06:02] an exceedingly reassuring one in verse
[1:06:04] 13
[1:06:05] but he
[1:06:06] that shall endure unto the end
[1:06:10] the same
[1:06:11] shall be saved
[1:06:13] endure what
[1:06:15] until the end of
[1:06:16] what we'll get to that
[1:06:19] the fact that those close to him asked
[1:06:22] jesus these questions indicates that
[1:06:24] they had forgotten or
[1:06:26] perhaps were ignoring something he'd
[1:06:27] emphasized to them earlier back in
[1:06:30] matthew 6
[1:06:33] he told them
[1:06:34] he talked about the birds of the air he
[1:06:36] talked about the flowers of the field
[1:06:39] he told us that your heavenly father
[1:06:41] knows what you have need of he said but
[1:06:44] here's what you're supposed to be doing
[1:06:46] seek ye first
[1:06:48] the kingdom of god
[1:06:50] and his righteousness
[1:06:52] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:06:54] you
[1:06:55] don't seek an order to collect the added
[1:06:57] things it's hypocrisy check your motive
[1:07:01] check your objective
[1:07:04] take therefore
[1:07:06] because of this take no thought for the
[1:07:08] morrow
[1:07:09] don't ask when shall these things be
[1:07:12] for the morrow shall take thought for
[1:07:13] the things of itself
[1:07:16] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[1:07:18] thereof
[1:07:20] seek ye first the kingdom of god and his
[1:07:23] righteousness
[1:07:24] well let's read that promise again this
[1:07:26] time from mark's account
[1:07:28] he shall be hated of all men
[1:07:31] for my name's sake
[1:07:34] but he that shall endure unto the end
[1:07:38] the same
[1:07:39] shall be
[1:07:40] saved what does it mean to endure
[1:07:44] if we
[1:07:45] you know look up the greek and go to
[1:07:46] strong's it's he's going to tell us that
[1:07:49] this particular word means to remain
[1:07:52] to undergo
[1:07:54] to bear trials
[1:07:57] to have fortitude
[1:07:59] to persevere
[1:08:01] abide
[1:08:03] endure
[1:08:04] patiently suffer
[1:08:07] terry behind
[1:08:08] and modern colloquial english
[1:08:10] we'd say
[1:08:12] to hang in there
[1:08:14] webster defines endure as an
[1:08:17] intransitive verb to continue in the
[1:08:18] same state like the style endured for
[1:08:21] centuries kind of like my tie i suppose
[1:08:24] to remain firm
[1:08:25] under suffering or misfortune without
[1:08:28] yielding
[1:08:29] or as a transit of an action verb to
[1:08:32] undergo especially without giving in
[1:08:35] to suffer
[1:08:37] to regard with acceptance or tolerance
[1:08:39] for example he could not endure noisy
[1:08:42] children or wiles sermons
[1:08:45] what about to the end
[1:08:47] again from strong's it means to set out
[1:08:50] for a definite point or goal
[1:08:53] the conclusion of an act or state
[1:08:57] termination
[1:08:58] endure to the end whether the end is the
[1:09:00] rapture whether the end is
[1:09:02] passing to that other dimension through
[1:09:04] the doorway of death
[1:09:07] we all look to the raptures the catching
[1:09:09] away the final act
[1:09:11] but we shouldn't think of it as a way
[1:09:13] out we in our lifetimes
[1:09:15] may not be caught up like elijah we may
[1:09:18] have to endure through the build up to
[1:09:20] it
[1:09:20] like the seven thousand
[1:09:23] this situation this this endurance it's
[1:09:26] not a bride versus church thing
[1:09:29] it's life it's in living today
[1:09:32] not in yesterday
[1:09:33] not in tomorrow
[1:09:36] paul told timothy
[1:09:37] 2 timothy 4 he said
[1:09:41] for the time will come
[1:09:43] when they will not endure or put up with
[1:09:46] or receive sound doctrine
[1:09:49] sound doctrine
[1:09:50] thank you brother frank for this i
[1:09:52] really enjoyed reading it
[1:09:55] sound doctrine but after their own lusts
[1:09:58] their own desires
[1:10:00] they shall heap to themselves teachers
[1:10:03] having itching ears
[1:10:05] they want to hear what they want to hear
[1:10:08] the way they want to hear it
[1:10:09] don't confuse me with the facts my
[1:10:11] mind's made up
[1:10:13] and they shall turn away their ears from
[1:10:15] the truth
[1:10:17] and shall be turned unto fables
[1:10:19] to unsound doctrine
[1:10:22] the truth is being proclaimed
[1:10:24] but they'll refuse to listen to it
[1:10:27] instead they listen to fables and deep
[1:10:29] revelations
[1:10:30] and believe them
[1:10:33] paul's warning timothy that someone in
[1:10:34] the church would find sound doctrine too
[1:10:36] hard to bear
[1:10:38] unwilling to endure the life that
[1:10:40] obedience to the gospel requires the
[1:10:43] people would drift to whatever they
[1:10:44] found that eased their discomforts while
[1:10:47] still claiming
[1:10:48] to be following the truth
[1:10:51] and they'll find heaps of those teachers
[1:10:56] they won't be hard to find
[1:10:58] and not just in some distant future like
[1:11:01] our day
[1:11:02] paul expected it to be during timothy's
[1:11:04] lifetime remember paul wasn't
[1:11:06] consciously saying i'm writing the bible
[1:11:09] and these people are going to be reading
[1:11:10] it 2000 years he's pending a letter of
[1:11:13] advice and warning and encouragement
[1:11:16] to one that he looked upon as his own
[1:11:17] son
[1:11:19] warning him encouraging him
[1:11:22] but there's another element of endurance
[1:11:24] that paul shares with him found in the
[1:11:26] next verse
[1:11:28] watch thou in all things
[1:11:30] endure afflictions
[1:11:32] do the work of an evangelist
[1:11:34] make full proof of my ministry
[1:11:37] if i could paraphrase that he's saying
[1:11:39] timothy my boy
[1:11:41] you're gonna have to put up with all
[1:11:42] this nonsense and hurt and rejection
[1:11:46] but hang in there buddy
[1:11:48] be faithful to your calling in spite of
[1:11:50] it and in the face of it
[1:11:53] don't give up
[1:11:54] never waver
[1:11:56] be steadfast
[1:11:58] endurance
[1:12:00] implies patience
[1:12:04] hebrews 12 a very familiar passage
[1:12:07] wherefore
[1:12:08] seeing we also i can pass to bout with
[1:12:11] so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:12:14] let us lay aside every weight
[1:12:17] the sin which death so easily beset us
[1:12:20] and let us run with patience
[1:12:22] the race
[1:12:24] that is set before us
[1:12:26] i'd like to emphasize this just a little
[1:12:27] bit
[1:12:29] taking from various translations the
[1:12:31] king james the niv the complete jewish
[1:12:33] bible nlt nasb amplified bible this is
[1:12:37] paul's conclusion
[1:12:38] after laying out a list
[1:12:40] of those who we often call the heroes of
[1:12:42] faith in chapter 11.
[1:12:45] therefore then
[1:12:47] since we are surrounded by such a huge
[1:12:50] cloud of witnesses
[1:12:51] who have borne testimony to the truth
[1:12:54] let us strip off and throw aside every
[1:12:57] encumbrance
[1:12:58] every unnecessary weight
[1:13:00] rid ourselves of every obstacle
[1:13:04] everything that hinders
[1:13:06] every impediment
[1:13:07] everything that slows us down
[1:13:10] and that sin which so readily and deftly
[1:13:13] and cleverly clings to and entangles us
[1:13:17] easily hampers our forward movement
[1:13:19] trips us up
[1:13:21] let us run with patient endurance and
[1:13:23] steady and active persistence
[1:13:26] perseverance
[1:13:27] the god-appointed course of the race
[1:13:30] that set before us
[1:13:32] we spoke about this race a while ago
[1:13:34] it's your individual race
[1:13:38] we aren't promised coddling
[1:13:40] we're not promised physical comfort
[1:13:42] we're promised comforting
[1:13:45] by the comforter
[1:13:47] the holy spirit in our lives
[1:13:50] the coddled don't need comforting and
[1:13:52] encouragement
[1:13:54] the suffering the weary
[1:13:56] the wounded
[1:13:57] they do
[1:13:59] do you have times in your life
[1:14:01] when you're in a cave
[1:14:03] perhaps of self-doubt or fear
[1:14:06] the lord comes and asks
[1:14:09] what are you doing here lyle
[1:14:12] i've been there many times
[1:14:16] i'd like to share a testimony with you
[1:14:19] one that i've not shared before
[1:14:22] i was drafted into the army
[1:14:25] in december 1972.
[1:14:28] in mid-1973 i was ordered to fort
[1:14:31] campbell kentucky
[1:14:32] i was assigned to b troop
[1:14:35] second squadron 17th calvary a component
[1:14:38] of the 101st airborne division the
[1:14:41] screaming eagles
[1:14:43] a very pregnant heather and i along with
[1:14:45] our 11 month old son samuel
[1:14:48] drove to kentucky
[1:14:51] we were desiring fellowship
[1:14:54] and knew of no message churches in the
[1:14:56] area
[1:14:57] somehow we ended up corresponding with
[1:14:59] sister helen borders
[1:15:01] and she sent us a letter and
[1:15:03] go down highway 68 towards elkton when
[1:15:07] you come to a quarry on the right look
[1:15:09] on the left there's a little road that
[1:15:11] leads behind mr case's barn and you'll
[1:15:13] find a church back there
[1:15:16] okay
[1:15:19] i was at this time
[1:15:20] feeling like i had failed the lord
[1:15:24] people i had confidence in were
[1:15:25] convinced that i shouldn't be in the
[1:15:27] army
[1:15:28] and they let me know it
[1:15:30] i was feeling
[1:15:32] very downcast
[1:15:33] this is mid-1973
[1:15:36] 1977 is hanging over our heads there's
[1:15:40] three and a half years of uncertainty is
[1:15:42] is the rapture going to be in 1977 or
[1:15:44] three and a half years sooner than that
[1:15:46] or since 1977 being january 1st or
[1:15:49] december 31st or
[1:15:51] was i an outcast has god rejected me
[1:15:55] i'm ripped away from the congregation
[1:15:57] and stuck in western kentucky somewhere
[1:15:59] with a bunch of soldiers
[1:16:04] well at that tiny country church
[1:16:07] pastored at that time by a brother billy
[1:16:10] fuller
[1:16:11] we met a family that was driving over a
[1:16:14] hundred miles each way to have
[1:16:16] fellowship
[1:16:18] paul and mary risley some of you may
[1:16:19] remember them when they were here in the
[1:16:21] 70s and 80s and their two young children
[1:16:24] paul and debbie
[1:16:26] they had only recently come into contact
[1:16:28] with and embraced the message
[1:16:31] how did that happen paul's dad
[1:16:34] psy risley was a spiritual man
[1:16:37] a solid christian for many decades
[1:16:41] and the lord spoke to him
[1:16:43] in dreams
[1:16:45] think of joel 2 28.
[1:16:50] for example when the grizzlies first
[1:16:52] received a few tape recordings of
[1:16:54] brother branham's sermons they were
[1:16:56] wondering about it
[1:16:58] something excited them but
[1:17:00] they were this is is this you so they
[1:17:03] talked to psy
[1:17:06] they shared with him
[1:17:08] so i had a dream
[1:17:11] and he told them
[1:17:13] you'll find the truth so and so miles
[1:17:15] south of booneville indiana now i don't
[1:17:18] recall the number
[1:17:20] but it was precise it was an exact
[1:17:23] number
[1:17:25] so they drove to the town square of
[1:17:27] booneville where lincoln studied law
[1:17:30] and started driving due south monitoring
[1:17:33] the car's odometer at that precise
[1:17:35] distance
[1:17:37] when the odometer had the exact reading
[1:17:40] the precise reading
[1:17:42] that matched psy's dream they stopped
[1:17:44] and looked where they were
[1:17:47] they were at the foot of their own
[1:17:48] driveway
[1:17:49] in yankee town indiana where they had
[1:17:52] just received the tapes
[1:17:55] those were the kinds of spiritual dreams
[1:17:57] that cy risley had
[1:18:00] well a couple of weeks after we met the
[1:18:02] grizzlies at brother fuller's church
[1:18:04] so i came to a sunday service with paul
[1:18:06] and mary
[1:18:08] and he acted a little odd when he met me
[1:18:11] collapsed my hands
[1:18:14] became a little emotional
[1:18:16] remember
[1:18:18] i was in a spiritual valley at this time
[1:18:21] doubting
[1:18:22] struggling
[1:18:23] fearful
[1:18:24] do i even have the holy ghost
[1:18:27] what am i doing here in the army
[1:18:29] i was drafted i didn't join lord you
[1:18:32] could have kept me out
[1:18:34] and people that i have confidence and
[1:18:36] said that i shouldn't be in here is this
[1:18:38] punishment why didn't you do that lord
[1:18:40] am i an outcast
[1:18:42] i was struggling
[1:18:45] turns out
[1:18:46] syde recently had a dream
[1:18:49] might have even been the night before i
[1:18:51] don't remember exactly though he had
[1:18:53] never met me
[1:18:55] he saw in that dreamy young man dressed
[1:18:57] in a certain patterned plaid shirt
[1:18:59] brother aaron
[1:19:01] and the lord told him
[1:19:03] he has the right spirit
[1:19:05] and that sunday morning the first time
[1:19:08] we ever met
[1:19:10] i was wearing the shirt
[1:19:12] that he'd seen
[1:19:13] in that dream
[1:19:16] well you can imagine we were both a
[1:19:17] little emotional when i heard that
[1:19:20] it still brings emotions when i recall
[1:19:22] that moment
[1:19:24] the overwhelming flood of reassurance
[1:19:27] i needed the encouragement
[1:19:29] a few weeks later i'd be summoned late
[1:19:32] at night three o'clock in the morning
[1:19:33] the phone rings report to fort campbell
[1:19:35] there's a war the yom keeper awarded
[1:19:37] just started and we were in the rotation
[1:19:39] to
[1:19:40] intervene if that was required
[1:19:43] god saw fit to encourage me just when i
[1:19:46] needed it
[1:19:48] when my barrel of meal seemed empty
[1:19:50] my crews of oil nearly dry
[1:19:53] and at the same time help and encourage
[1:19:55] another a few months later
[1:19:58] as sly lay in his deathbed heather and i
[1:20:00] were privileged to spend an hour or two
[1:20:02] with him
[1:20:03] singing as he waved his hands to the
[1:20:05] song that we sang
[1:20:07] a bittersweet time
[1:20:09] precious memories
[1:20:11] i felt like i was part of that seven
[1:20:13] thousand
[1:20:15] even now
[1:20:17] when i get discouraged when i think or i
[1:20:19] know that i'm just not doing my part
[1:20:23] doubting
[1:20:24] wondering
[1:20:25] i sometimes recall that sunday morning
[1:20:27] in the summer of 1973
[1:20:30] when i met psy risley
[1:20:33] and i still draw encouragement from it
[1:20:34] not to dwell in the past or on my faults
[1:20:37] and weaknesses and failings but comfort
[1:20:38] and strength to carry on
[1:20:40] to get up
[1:20:42] to get out of the cave
[1:20:44] to continue to be part of that seven
[1:20:46] thousand
[1:20:48] there's other personal testimonies i'd
[1:20:50] like to share with you maybe over time
[1:20:51] i'll have that opportunity
[1:20:53] i'm sure many of you have similar
[1:20:55] experiences something
[1:20:57] that
[1:20:58] when you recall in moments of doubt or
[1:21:01] despair
[1:21:02] you can say like paul wrote to timothy i
[1:21:06] know whom i have believed i'm persuaded
[1:21:10] that he's able to keep that which i've
[1:21:12] committed unto him
[1:21:14] against that day
[1:21:17] my brother and my sister we are called
[1:21:19] to endure
[1:21:20] to be steadfast
[1:21:22] to watch and pray
[1:21:24] to be like paul
[1:21:26] part of that seven thousand
[1:21:29] and that's what was on my heart to share
[1:21:31] with you this evening
[1:21:32] to encourage you
[1:21:34] to hold fast
[1:21:36] and to be ready
[1:21:38] always
[1:21:39] to be
[1:21:40] ready jesus words he that shall endure
[1:21:45] unto the end
[1:21:47] the same shall be saved
[1:21:50] thinking of jesus words
[1:21:52] i'm reminded of a song
[1:21:55] the race by lanny wolfe
[1:21:58] the chorus is the part i remember the
[1:22:00] best
[1:22:02] i'll put the words up
[1:22:04] i'm no singer i'll just read them but
[1:22:06] maybe after the second verse we can try
[1:22:08] and sing the chorus together
[1:22:10] some of you may know it certainly better
[1:22:12] than i
[1:22:13] i tried to keep it a bit short tonight
[1:22:15] so we could worship for a while
[1:22:18] isn't that what he wants from us
[1:22:20] to draw nearer
[1:22:23] many souls have started out
[1:22:26] to run this race
[1:22:28] many feet have stumbled trying hard
[1:22:32] to keep the pace
[1:22:34] at times my steps have grown so weary
[1:22:38] as i watch others
[1:22:40] pass me by it makes me wonder
[1:22:43] who will make it
[1:22:45] is there hope
[1:22:47] for such as i
[1:22:49] it's not the one who runs the swiftest
[1:22:52] nor the one who shines for a day
[1:22:55] but the one who endures to the end
[1:23:00] he
[1:23:01] he shall be saved
[1:23:03] a crown of life is waiting
[1:23:06] for those
[1:23:07] who make it in those who've run the race
[1:23:10] with patience
[1:23:12] casting off
[1:23:13] the weights of sin
[1:23:15] it doesn't matter when we've started
[1:23:18] or how long the race has been it's the
[1:23:21] end that's so important
[1:23:24] i just got to make it in
[1:23:27] not the one who runs the swiftest
[1:23:30] nor the one who shines for a day
[1:23:33] but the one who endures to the end
[1:23:36] he shall be saved
[1:23:38] maybe we can try and sing that
[1:23:41] not the one
[1:23:44] who runs the swiftest
[1:23:48] nor the one
[1:23:51] who shines for a day
[1:23:56] but the one
[1:23:59] who
[1:24:00] endureth to the end
[1:24:05] he
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:08] he shall be saved
[1:24:13] not the
[1:24:14] one who runs the swiftest
[1:24:21] nor the one
[1:24:24] who shines for a
[1:24:28] day but the one
[1:24:34] who endorsed
[1:24:37] the end
[1:24:40] he
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:49] [Music]
[1:24:56] nor the one
[1:25:00] who shines
[1:25:05] but the one
[1:25:09] who endureth
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:24] you know
[1:25:25] a race
[1:25:28] it's always to the one who crosses the
[1:25:30] line first
[1:25:32] that gets the prize
[1:25:35] but when you run as a team
[1:25:37] making cross-country
[1:25:39] it's the five
[1:25:41] that cross the line with a combined
[1:25:43] score
[1:25:45] and the higher the score
[1:25:47] the lower the place
[1:25:49] or the further back
[1:25:51] because if you run
[1:25:53] first second third fourth and fifth and
[1:25:55] you add those numbers that's the lowest
[1:25:57] amount numbers and if you run five
[1:25:58] through ten well you've got higher
[1:26:00] numbers
[1:26:02] and that's the
[1:26:04] running that i did was cross country
[1:26:06] so we'd start looking to see who was
[1:26:08] placing where maybe they weren't winning
[1:26:10] but if he could get past that one
[1:26:12] he could get our team to win
[1:26:16] and that was a different type of race
[1:26:20] but to each individual has been given a
[1:26:22] call and a place
[1:26:24] and a race to run
[1:26:27] but we can encourage one another
[1:26:29] we can strengthen one another we can say
[1:26:32] don't give up
[1:26:33] come on keep running
[1:26:37] i like that testimony
[1:26:39] the preciseness of god
[1:26:42] right in front of your driveway
[1:26:46] but
[1:26:48] i didn't have my phone on but set it
[1:26:50] down next to me there and it turned on
[1:26:53] and somebody sent me this
[1:26:56] and it's joshua 23 14.
[1:26:59] they sent it to me before service i'm
[1:27:01] looking at the time now
[1:27:03] if we can get that up joshua 23 14.
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:13] let's am i reading it right here
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:19] okay
[1:27:21] you know with all your heart and soul
[1:27:23] that not one of all the good promises
[1:27:26] the lord your god gave you has failed
[1:27:29] every promise has been fulfilled not one
[1:27:33] has failed
[1:27:36] without fail god went to the very end to
[1:27:39] make sure it was all completed
[1:27:43] and
[1:27:45] by a show of hands who is here in 77 at
[1:27:47] the meetings
[1:27:50] few of you
[1:27:51] i was here as young men
[1:27:53] and the fear that swept
[1:27:56] the congregation in that service
[1:27:59] as a brother stood up and spoke in
[1:28:01] tongues
[1:28:02] and another one prophesied saying we're
[1:28:04] down to or this was
[1:28:06] december 18th through 24th with the
[1:28:08] meetings
[1:28:10] and the brothers
[1:28:11] got up and and said this is the last few
[1:28:14] days you better be ready you better get
[1:28:16] ready now we're down to our last couple
[1:28:19] days before the lord comes
[1:28:21] because of what brother randomly said
[1:28:23] about 77 and what people
[1:28:25] took it to be and mean and somewhere
[1:28:28] between what was it 125 135 people
[1:28:32] somewhere in that place
[1:28:34] were rebaptized or baptized that night
[1:28:37] including myself
[1:28:40] by the fear that set upon us
[1:28:44] now after the brother
[1:28:45] finished
[1:28:46] interpreting the message brother graham
[1:28:49] stood up behind the pope and he said
[1:28:50] brother i judge you enthused
[1:28:53] but not inspired
[1:28:55] but the fear had run through the
[1:28:57] church
[1:28:59] there doesn't have to be fear
[1:29:03] but there is an assurance that god keeps
[1:29:05] his word
[1:29:07] and you and i are just to run this race
[1:29:10] to the end
[1:29:12] if he says make me
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:15] give me a cup of water and make me that
[1:29:17] bread
[1:29:19] he says and yours will not fail do what
[1:29:21] he says to do he says to do
[1:29:24] because
[1:29:25] this scripture just they send it to me
[1:29:27] and it says he has not failed on a
[1:29:29] single one of his promises
[1:29:33] i know i can testify and down in hard
[1:29:35] times god has spoken to me
[1:29:38] to me
[1:29:40] because he knows who i am
[1:29:42] and each one of you should have that
[1:29:44] assurance in your life that god knows
[1:29:45] who you are your place and he'll talk to
[1:29:48] you
[1:29:50] whether it's through somebody else
[1:29:52] speaking to you what god wants you when
[1:29:54] he gives you a dream or he personally
[1:29:56] comes and visits you
[1:29:58] i'll testify will you testify with me
[1:30:00] that god would do that for you
[1:30:01] amen stand on this stand
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:08] i
[1:30:10] i know what's been in my heart for the
[1:30:12] last week or so
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:16] and that's just to take what god has
[1:30:18] said and stand on that
[1:30:22] and it's
[1:30:24] the words that go he did
[1:30:26] will you
[1:30:29] that's what's been ringing out he did
[1:30:32] will you take them
[1:30:34] when he said and he he nailed there
[1:30:37] at gethsemane and he said father
[1:30:41] is there a way to go around this
[1:30:44] what's about to happen
[1:30:46] can we do this a different way
[1:30:49] and then he humbled himself he says but
[1:30:51] not my will
[1:30:52] but thy will be done
[1:30:55] and then he said i he had his faith
[1:30:58] steadfast to jerusalem
[1:31:01] and that's just what he did
[1:31:03] will you that's what's been asking me
[1:31:04] will you do the same thing
[1:31:08] let's just bow our hands
[1:31:11] lord
[1:31:14] we're in a time and
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:19] part of our our cry and our desire is
[1:31:22] even so come quickly lord jesus
[1:31:26] but sometimes i wonder if we do that as
[1:31:28] an escape
[1:31:30] as uh i don't want to deal with this
[1:31:32] anymore
[1:31:33] just get me out of here
[1:31:38] but as i was you know lord as i was
[1:31:39] thinking that the other day and i was
[1:31:41] just saying lord
[1:31:43] when is that cry how is that cry how
[1:31:46] should it be made
[1:31:48] because the scripture says even so come
[1:31:50] quickly lord jesus
[1:31:53] but then my heart went what but what
[1:31:54] about those who have not heard
[1:31:57] what about those who have have not made
[1:31:59] their heart right lord to give them an
[1:32:01] opportunity also to be ready
[1:32:05] but lord help us to be ready let each
[1:32:07] one of us hear under the
[1:32:09] sound of brother lyle's voice that you
[1:32:11] used to speak this today
[1:32:13] to be ready to be prepared to endure to
[1:32:15] the end lord
[1:32:18] sometimes we just throw our hands up and
[1:32:19] say i just don't want to do it anymore
[1:32:21] lord and you know that
[1:32:23] because you even asked the father there
[1:32:25] was a way to go around this
[1:32:27] but you said not my will but thy will be
[1:32:29] done may that be our purpose
[1:32:32] in our heart today
[1:32:34] we pray in jesus christ's name
[1:32:37] amen
[1:32:39] let's worship him he's worthy of all
