[Music] oh [Music] is [Music] amen how many made that reservation amen how many know that the price has been paid already amen he was wounded for our transgressions [Music] isaiah chapter 53 verses four and five if you could put that out as we bring the needs [Music] surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken cementing of god and afflicted we didn't know that it was for us we thought he was being punished by god but he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed that's a promise of god and he keeps his word so we'll stand on that we do have some needs to bring to your attention and let's continue to remember our brother julio figueroa spoke to his family this morning and brother julio has stopped taking the chemotherapy it had been affecting him quite severely doctors told him it was a brave move but it's something he should do and sister his daughter sister grace told me that he started eating again and he's feeling much better so god knows how to heal because he's already provided and sometimes we want it done a certain way but god knows how he's going to do that [Music] i got a text from brother tony ramirez and he's been having some complications with his blood pressures and things and just asked that we would remember him in prayer and then just continue remember brother al peterson brother arne mentioned that he was still having some difficulties but was doing better so let's continue to remember brother al and also if you got the whatsapp you saw the request for brother dan roberts was taken to the hospital and then the praise that the the cut had had healed itself and this morning brother ed text him and brother dan said the doctor said he would be in the hospital six more days before he could be released but the healing process had already begun so we're praising god and we're thanking him for that we'll do that and this morning also sister amelia had asked for prayer and sister connie carey and to be anointed with oil and brother dan has has chose to do that at the end of service and our sister connie had requested some of your sisters to come up and stand with her in prayer so that would be perfectly fine so we'll do that at the end of service i spoke to both of them and let them know so if you'll stand with me raise your hand and say i have a need i have a desire and i raise my other hand because i believe the lord he's a healer he was wounded for my transgression he was moves for my iniquities lord we we raise our hands because we do have needs lord and but we know that you supply all our needs lord so with one hand we raise and we say lord i need you and with the other hand we say thank you lord for meeting our needs lord we believe you know every desire every heart maybe we couldn't put it in words maybe we couldn't write it down just something inside of us is crying out lord but we just know that you've taken care of him we thank you for it lord we ask it in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated a couple of praises from our sister elizabeth guerra my my sister-in-law says i would like to thank the lord for his goodness and the saints for their prayers i successfully completed my training so amen i've always said ask him he'll do it yeah it's the same i'd also like to congratulate my mom and dad 66 years of marriage yesterday i appreciate that a good testimony to the family talking to i think it was sarah yesterday a little bit and she said to have the marriage of my grandparents for 66 years and the marriage of my parents for almost 42 years what a blessing sometimes we take things for granted but god sure is good and merciful to us we appreciate all that he's done for us and he's never left us never been a time that we were left alone to drift on our own but he's watched over us he's cared for us so i think that so just uh make an announcement how we're going to be proceeding forward here for the next month to the end of march maybe into early april we had a meeting with brother daniel andes yesterday myself brother jordan brother ed and brother arne to discuss how we would like to go forward so brother daniel is going to be with us today tonight and wednesday and he will be assuming the duties of a pastor to begin so that we can begin to know him and and see how what his heart is and he can begin to know how we are even more then he has the following two weekends he has some obligations that he has to take care of it's already made in ministering for brother dale smith up in flagstaff next weekend and the following weekend is brother brad burch's birthday so he's part of that's his pastor so it's part of that and then he will be coming back and staying with us through the end of march possibly into early early april and assuming and starting today assuming the role of an interim pastor so that we have that opportunity to work with him and and share those things so you keep him in prayer and again i remind you god has never left us sometimes we wonder what are you doing lord and he says i'm performing what i have desired for you and bringing it to pass so we will be having communion service tonight and foot washing we have made the arrangements to for individual cups and things just to to and speaking with brother daniel about these things to do it in a way that is as safest as we can so he said something and i'm just gonna it just caught me yesterday because communion time comes and i've heard many say well i've i've got to check my life closely i've got to and and people get nervous about it but he put it in a way that maybe i never thought about this way and he said if you're not ready for communion you're not ready for the rapture it puts it in a place so get ready pretty simple get ready all that you can do to be ready be ready so we'll let brother daniel take the service here if we'll stand but that that's how we've chosen to proceed as the congregation voted last sunday night let's get moving forward so trust in the lord you'll be in prayer you'll be in prayer it's for your benefit also so amazing grace how sweet the sound how many knows it's god's grace to us [Music] i want was amen god bless you you may be seated god bless you musicians didn't they do a good

girl where they at raise your hands god bless you i was so blessed by your special in the back room god bless isn't it good to see young people serving the lord amen i wanted to thank the lord again for touching brother dan roberts that amen how the lord touched him and he didn't have to have that emergency surgery our god is a healer he is the same yesterday today and forever i know the remedy tells us that life is the healer and life has to work its thing but they were going to have to have that emergency surgery our sister sarah i think she sat in the parking lot all night friday night they wouldn't let her back in they didn't know if they had that surgery if they might just let her in for a little bit so it was a big deal to her and we're thanking the lord that he delivered our brother and healed him and he's he's still healing him amen he's still working blessed be the name of the lord and i just wanted to say thank you to the brothers that have invited me that brother ed and brother aaron and brother arne and brother jordan had called and invited us to come and trust the lord to do things among us amen i believe he's already started to do things among us amen my wife this is my wife shannon if she'll maybe sing a song for us [Music] i have you right here in my hands [Music] and for your life i have a plan leading every step you take you're right here in my hands

hands man you believe all things work together for good you know it's the truth whether we believe it or not got to get to the place that we believe the word of god amen is it all right if i walk down there i i feel like i'm so far away from you all i like to be close to people and and i just uh i don't know how this morning this will if i could just talk to you maybe not preach to you is that okay sometimes i see people that want to be a minister and i say you know paul never had a microphone in his hand and most of his ministry was in a prison down in a dungeon somewhere in his mind he thought i'd be a much better preacher if i wasn't in this dungeon but he wrote most of the book the new testament so as that song said god's doing something amen he's got our lives are in his hands let's just pray together heavenly father lord we love you today and lord as the song says we're right in your hands father we love you and we just commit our lives to you and pray lord as we would talk a little bit this morning that you would take the scriptures that we read the thought on our heart and as i express my heart lord i pray that you would just help us father and strengthen us you know where each one of us are in our lives i pray you'd help us now in jesus name amen amen it's good to see some of our friends if i start mentioning all our friends brother wilson hembree god bless you and our sister i know brother howard cyril well he's a good friend of ours and his sister yarborough god bless you i could go down the road just start mentioning all of you brother johnson brother lyle and sister heather god bless you i know you've been working hard for the lord god bless you it's good to see brother peter this morning i just saw him briefly and so i just i want to thank the brothers again for inviting us and and we talked about some things and i i just thought we'd maybe talk about a couple things if that's okay i want to tell you who i am i'm just a sinner saved by grace i'm i believe jesus christ died on the cross for our sins he's my savior i believe god sent a prophet because the bible said that he would send a prophet just before the coming of the lord he was sent elijah the prophet that's why we believe this message because the bible said it would come and we believe it got to believe the bible so i'm 52 years old my wife is 52 years old i we've been married 33 years we're not to the 66 yet brother larry but we're coming if the lord tarries we've got three boys we've raised three boys most of you know william he sings and my son ethan he's married he just had his second child and then i've got an older son isaac and he just had a first grandchild i've lived in jeffersonville area 51 years i moved there when i was 2 years old so i've lived there most of my life when i was 2 years old we moved there as i said and and i started attending the branham tabernacle my father started working at the spoken word in the uh so for 35 years my father was a transcriber from the the sermons brother random to the book so 35 years he did that and the table app and those things now they took that text and scanned it and put it in the computer that we search and use it now that was my father's a lot of his original work and when i was 17 years old i started working for the spoken word and working with brother joseph branham for 13 years i gave my life to help brother joseph take this message around the world because i believe this message god sent this message behold i jesus christ jehovah the old testament is jesus of the new jesus christ sent to me elijah the prophet and i believe that because it's written in the bible so i gave 13 years to help brother joseph do that i appreciate brother joseph branham what he's doing around the world to take this message to the people i don't have the ability or the resources to do it so i say god bless my brother he's sending that around the world may god bless him recently so we started helping brother burgess when we were young we were 19 years old we got it started helping brother brad burgess when i was 19 he had started a church had it for a few years and so we started helping him my wife and i and she became the sunday school teacher i think for 26 27 years 28 years she was a sunday school teacher i teach the sunday school class now she teaches 5-10 i speak preach teach 10 to 15. and so just recently the lord's put on our heart to minister more and to minister the word of god we've been involved in a lot of things in support and in our church and and so we've had the burden to preach more i don't know where that is if that's evangelism or if that's at my home church or if there's at another church and so i'm just trying to take one step at a time to follow the lord and so when the brothers called me and said would you consider helping us for a little bit we prayed about it and we met with the brothers yesterday and i want to say i didn't call them they called me so i this is not like brother daniel they called me and said would you come so that's why i'm here today and so we talked and i've just got a little window with my work and things that we could take some a few weeks here and maybe just try to be here and you could get to know me and i could get to know you i can tell you i only have one motive as a minister and that sees souls prepare their heart to go in a rapture to me that's what a minister's job is to have people prepared to meet the lord jesus christ and so i've never pastored before i don't know our heart has been with the young people in our church and so we very young age got in they actually evicted us out of our house because my wife was having so many tutoring students they were homeschooling and piano students they said you can't have this many people at your house and and so they kicked us out we said we're gonna have them at our house and so we had them and so now today a lot of those young people one is the head deacon the other deacon his wife is one that we helped the piano players the one that my wife gave piano lessons so god has blessed those efforts and i don't know and i was as the brothers i just was very candid with the brothers yesterday and just said you know i think it's only fair that we maybe do this for a period of time and then we maybe just withdraw ourselves and you all pray and we pray i believe god works on both ends and if the lord would have us to continue then god would put it on both of our hearts and if it would we would go a different direction and you just say hey you're too much of an evangelist for us we want to settle you know then then we would just pray is that fair would you raise your hand is that prayer if you agree with me we just take some time i believe god works on both ends of the line however and i might mention some things through there through my message that you know as a shepherd to guide us through sometimes we're in a pandemic now we've never been through one of these before i think i haven't i know brother branham if you go back and study in 1957 he went through one he was in a he read it he came out west to go hunting he loved to go hunting he said we got so sick we didn't even take our guns out we just put our guns back in he drove back to indiana and he was sick with the flu i forget which one of the flu's maybe you've studied it but it's 1957 he mentions it twice that he got it and he just you know got it got and he moved on god was his healer and i believe god is our healer do you believe that how many of my friends got sick he didn't say you wouldn't get sick he said i'm the lord heals all of your sicknesses and all of your diseases we don't live in fear we live in faith amen however i do believe that at some age a person is more susceptible and i believe if you feel that you need to make wear a mask or don't shake hands you want to do a fist bump feel free you don't is that is that okay in each one just do what you feel is best kind of for you i think that's that's fair to us and each one of us we should have that respect for one another the brothers we talked about having communion the bible tells us there's only three ordinances that jesus left for us one was water baptism one was foot washing and one was communion so the brothers the elders were together and saying how can we make this possible and so they may be a little bit different i think when jesus was serving the wine the objective was to take the wine and to put it into their body and take the bread and put it into their body so maybe a little bit different the brothers have talked and have the individual cups that we'll use tonight and just try to be aware of our surroundings and minimize our exposure so they've taken some precautions and i think it would be good as they'll all be together and take communion the other thing that we talked about this morning is as we go or yesterday as we go through a time as a church family sometimes you go through things as a family you don't tell everybody and maybe your husband or wife and you retreat and and and you go through it and you pray together and you work through it and then you come back out and you minister and you do those things and so as a church family as we go through these things i'm not interested in everybody in florida and new york and flor and africa knowing what we're going through is that fair so the brothers have streaming to those that are a part of our church and we talked about when the service is going on those that want to live stream or be on the phone and see and be a part of the church they're welcome to and then maybe just take that so it's not public it's not a public link so that anybody that at the church time would want to either be in the service or virtually join the service they could but then it wouldn't be available after that you know we go through this time and i share my heart to you i'm not interested in florida and new zealand and everybody talking about what we're going through we're going through it and we'll go through it and we'll get through it amen is that fair so talk to the the elders they if you have questions about that you know it's back home we talk about things that said man we're just trying to get through this thing and when it first came out the pandemic and a lot of things going on and said man we're just trying to get through this we're doing the best that we can i don't know even what the laws are here back home we had indiana kentucky you go to church in kentucky we lived in indiana and kentucky and indiana the governors were shutting down and back and forth and i said man they can't even figure out the health professionals can't figure it out i'm just trying to get through this tell me what to do i'll do it but we're just trying to get through it amen that's like life i was born one day i'm gonna die one day and i'm just trying to get through it and i was a sinner back here i'm a preacher here right and there was this man called jesus christ i heard the story of an old rugged cross and i believed in it and it took the weight of sin off my shoulders and delivered me from that can you say amen this is more than a theory this is something you experience this is not a 2 000 year old story i try to convince you to believe it's something you experience listen to me now and then after that happened there was two thousand six thousand denominations that held the same bible and said we're we're right we're the truth i said oh god what do i do and then behold i send you elijah the prophet god sent me a prophet remember this is just personal great cradle grave journey i met jesus christ and now in my journey i say lord what do i do and god rich in mercy before i was ever born had a promise written in the scripture had william branham that came and went and had a message stored up on tapes for me this is a personal thing this is i love us but this is me it's me on a journey from the cr and everyone you young people each one is brother johnson we're on a journey i'm just trying to make it from the cradle to the grave and while i was going through something came along to help me is that fair and i began to hear the revelation of jesus christ and the things and i said you know lord that makes sense serpent seed lord that makes sense the prophet says god didn't come to save the devil's children he came to save his children and lord i'm one of your children and he saves me and he changes me and so we're trying to get through this amen i gotta i think you're supposed to read a text before you start preaching but when you're a preacher you're just a preacher let's just stand together and maybe read over in the bible if you have your bibles revelations chapter 3 i'm going to try to be short i know we have a couple people that wanted to be prayed for we're going to try to do that in just a few minutes amen let's pray father we just asked now as we read your word that you would help us lord we're totally dependent on you we have no ability of ourself we surrender ourselves to you and pray that you would speak to us in jesus name amen revelations chapter 3 verse 14 i'm just going to read a couple of verses here revelations 3 verse 14 the bible says i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou were cold nor hot so then because thou art lukewarm i will spew and neither cold nor hot i will spew the out of my mouth just for the sake of time let's go to verse 20. actually let's read verse 19. as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent so contrary to our culture that says if you correct your child in an abrupt way you don't love them the bible says if i chasten you and i rebuke you it's because i do love you it's one of the greatest evidence that you're a son of god so if we open the bible and something just smites you and corrects you don't run away from it embrace it say lord i must be your child and we're not talking about an opinion of man but we're talking about the bible jesus if it is what's correct as a minister i i what we teach comes from the bible and if it corrects us then just say lord i'm your child you're correcting me verse 20 behold i stand at the door knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will that grant to sit with me and my throne even as i overcome and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath the near let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches amen you may be seated may god add his blessing to the reading of the word i want to just speak for a few minutes this morning on revival in me revival in me and i could have said revival in us but there's something about coming to the house of the lord that i feel like that we need to you know i preach so much against selfishness but when you come to the house of the lord it's time to be a little bit selfish and say lord i need a touch from you i need a filling of the spirit lord i need encouragement i need uplifted and i believe you know when you go to the doctor it's nice when he's taking care of other people but it comes to time like hey i'm here i need you lord and that's what i believe as we come to the house of the lord i want to speak on this revival in me and i was thinking uh you know because there's many messages i went in my office the other day and you're going to arizona and i'm old school just for some different reasons and so i have a lot of sermons there's probably three or four hundred sermons on my my my office there and i look like so i just went through a few of my like well maybe i would speak on those so i brought maybe ten stuck them in my bag and i'm coming down here i'm sitting on the plane and the holy spirit just starts dealing with me and i pull a bay out of my bag and i just start writing and holy spirits and everybody's around me we're flying 30 000 feet and i'm writing down lord i think that this is what you want to say this is what you want to say it'd be so easy just to go grab my notes and preach a two-hour sermon but maybe that's not what god wants the bible says as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god do you want to be a spirit-led church lord let the holy spirit that's why a lot of people don't want the holy spirit in the church because they don't want him to say whatever he wants to say but we don't want to be like that we want to be like ananias and sapphira lord say it lord help us and if there's sin in my life lord don't call it out in the church just come and talk to me first and lord i'll repent of it i'll make it right lord i you know and so i was just thinking about that i was writing on the plane and the holy spirit gave me this little thought and i was reading in the message how can i overcome brother branham said i was crossing the log the other day down a little wash or outside and i jumped up on a log on and i looked and it was a good old beach log but when i jumped on a big hunk of it fell off and it was rotten and dodie and i said that's the way christians are becoming this is a prophet he's out in the woods just hunting and he's getting a sermon by jumping on a log and his log collapses he said that's the way christians are becoming i know there's some that aren't that way i sister sarah sat in a parking lot the old day the whole night the friday night and i'm sure she was praying while we were sitting in a car not knowing the future but now we're not dody christians we don't want to be like that log we want to be like a strong tree how david say it in psalms 1 he shall be like a tree planted a strong tree that amen it has substance it's not dead a doty log but the brother man said this is the way christians are becoming they are dead and sin and trespasses so long till they become doty they can hold no weight at all they don't know what the overcome means i begin to think on this text overcome he said keep life in you keep life in you when life goes out that what brought the log to that condition it was made worse than it ever when it was laid in the branch where the water was and then there you take a christian that's supposed to be a christian and let the life of god go from him and the experience and the joy of serving christ and living in a church where such is going on he rottens twice as quick living right under it and you've seen people like that they come to church and then the devil comes in to create something and they cut their life long and they fall down and they just lay in the water the holy spirit maybe with the grudge and they rot twice as quick right in the church but brother ram gives us this thing he said now if we're trying to follow the message of the hour at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ so it's not a matter of being in the water it's a matter of the water the life being inside of me so i love you all and i'm just i'm speaking as one of you it's not to me it's not a preacher up there i'm one of you i have a job and i go to work and i work and i struggle through a pandemic and we had a business and it went from here to nothing and and and then my son started a business i said well i'll go work for my son i work for him and and and you know we're just trying to get through this thing but here's the thing is if you're a christian i was talking to somebody the other day i said you know here's the difference between me and the other guy maybe we're going through a pandemic i got a bologna sandwich he's got a baloney sandwich i got five gallons of gas he's got five gallons of gas i got three gallons of water he's got three gallons of water the difference is when my bologna sandwich runs out and my gas runs out and the water runs out i still have the creator with me all things were created by him and for him and jesus said i'll never leave you daniel and i'll never forsake you lo daniel i am with you always so when he runs out he has nothing when i run out i have the creator with me do you believe that that's what we have as christians we have christ with us david said though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for you're with me you can't have a shadow unless there's a light somewhere in the darkness can you say amen to that it doesn't matter what have you probably told that story when they come and told me my son had been in a car accident i don't remember where i tell stories but told me it was in a terrible accident and and and his head had a head injury and they just told me that i said okay but i got to go pray and i went in a little bathroom i said lord i don't understand i don't know where this is taken but i commit my life is in your hands like the song lord my life is in your hands every day we dedicate it i don't know what today holds but i know who holds today and my life is in his hands and long story short i went to one hospital just went right in the emergency room up and down where's my son where he's not here and so i just drove to louisville it's over there and the other one i said where's my son he said he's not here they're bringing him in on the helicopter so i stood and watched the helipad on the monitor right there waiting for my son not knowing what the injury was and then i waited and then directly they brought a gurney in and they had got the information mixed up it wasn't my son it was another brother's son and he brought him in but i just say that to say god knows everything amen how'd he say it psalms 91 i will not be afraid for the terror by night or an evil report or those things we have christ with us let me if you're a christian now if you're not a christian you have nothing you have no hope you could walk out of here and some 16 year old person texting across the center line and you go and meet your creator and answer to god and either go to heaven or you go to hell i don't want to hear fire and brimstone i'm sorry that's my job i'm not going to hear and tell you how to make donuts tell you how to sell stuff on etsy i'm here to tell you as a minister there's only heaven and hell we don't and so we're here to make our hearts right with god and so i say i'm i don't take chances i'm going to tell you a little bit i don't like chances i don't take chance i don't gamble i want to be sure about my soul i want to be sure i want to be sure remember the little boy with the kite going up there man said a string going up there he's in the clouds you can't see it he says what are you doing he said i'm flying a car he said i don't see no kite how do you know he said i know there's a guy who said how do you know he said i got this string and every once in a while i feel a tug on it and that's the way the believer should be not an experience we had 20 years ago or 30 years ago or five years ago there should be a tug in your heart there should be a pulsating of the holy spirit that echoes down in your heart amen and if you don't know what i'm talking about you can know what i'm talking about it's not just stories that brother branham told on a tape it's a living jesus christ well touch my brother dan that's in the hospital when i can't go there and i'm texting him dan i'll come and pray for him he said they won't let you come i said but i can get on my knees and i can pray for you and we prayed and god touched him and he's continuing touching and he's continuing to touch your situation in my situation it's all in his control we have a healer with this he said i'm the lord that heals all of your sicknesses and all of your diseases can you say amen to that the devil's desire is that you'd get a little sniffle that would go into an infection a fever would rise and your your life would be taken from you that's the devil the devil comes to seek kill and destroy and the only if you had coveted and you got over it there's only one person that caused you to get over and that's jesus christ can you say amen to that jesus said i am the way i am the truth and i am life brother man preaches a message called life is the healer is this okay life is a healer and they said well people say well medicine's a healer brother i'm saying well then cut cut my coat and put some medicine on it and it should heal it right if no it won't heal it oh well no it you got to be alive to then oh so then and then so uh you know brotherham said take a corpse and cut it and then pour the medicine on it said no it's gotta it said oh so life is the healer medicine is a poison that goes into your body that kills the bad germs so the good germs can regenerate and continue to grow and overtake the bad germs jesus christ is our healer it's everything is in jesus christ say well we got some good doctors out there but jesus christ gives them the heartbeat that keeps them alive and gives them the wisdom to know what to do isn't it good to know the lord isn't it good to place your life in his hands lord i place my life in your hands it's a song maybe we'll sing tonight i was thinking about that and and our thought this morning is is uh keeping revival in us and i i was reading this quote yesterday brother ram said i was called in on something the other day a group in arizona that's right here where we are and so there was something that happened way back in arizona uh this isn't questions and answers in 1964 it's at a ministerial meeting and they they were talking to brother and i said the only thing we got against you brother branham is one of the things is people that comes out here with you we can't get them to go to church anywhere now brother bam teaches us that spirits don't die they just change the person that dwells them in so here we are many years later and i would say that that was probably still the case because spirits don't die and even people around our message brother random said that there was something that followed the trait around this message that people wouldn't go to church and said they got children and everything and they won't go to church and well we told them they were welcome to come to our church and so brother abraham says well i know they put pressure on you and want you to join he said and he's talking to his people he said you don't you don't have to join but put them kids in sunday school somewhere this is brother ray i'm talking to his people put those kids in sunday school somewhere and he said you go to church don't sit at home go fishing and hunting and things like that on sunday and he said you say well i'm not a legalist so he beats to the punch to those people that are going to say well i'm not a legalist brother branham says well you better be in that manner for a while dishonoring the resurrection of christ that's good admonition isn't it that's a prophet diagnosing the situation around our message and telling us the solution to that i'm so thankful for that and i was thinking about that because many people left israel they left egypt if you have your bibles let's go back in the bibles to the book of joshua and i just want to read through these very quickly um through the book of joshua because there was many that left egypt and then they disbelieved the word of god and they roamed in the wilderness joshua chapter 5. if you're around me you're going to read your bible okay you're going to have your bible with us brother branham came to turn our hearts back to the bible not to this cloud of vapor i mean some people want to believe that brother ram just came on the earth and there was nothing before him and nothing after him it just no brother branham was one of the seven church age messengers now we believe and give respect to the to the church age messenger in our day but paul was a messenger and martin and ireneus and columbus and and all of those men were messengers so brother branham he said i'm on the platform that those pentecostal people built for me so we can't come along and rip the platform off and have him just standing in the air no we got to come back and know that what we believe is founded in the bible and so we come here to joshua the first chapter and it says and it came to pass i'm sorry joshua chapter 5 verse 1 and when the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan went westward and all the kings of canaanites which were by the sea heard that that the lord had dried up the waters of the jordan from before the children of israel until they were passed over that their heart melted neither was there any spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel now stay with me here i know i'm reading a little bit but at that time the lord said unto joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time so stay with me as we go through this story they were all in egypt for 400 years god said by prophecy i'll bring them out with a mighty hand they spoil the egyptians they come out to cross the red sea and now they're with this prophet messenger in a wilderness and they're traveling just as we've left many times our denominations our churches wrote fulfilling revelations chapter 18 come out of her my people we're following a message but a lot of people have died in the wilderness in the last 40 years can you say amen to that and they're not in church today maybe the church was packed at one time but now it's not packed what happened to the people they died in the wilderness so now they come to a time where god said i want to do something else. and joshua comes on the scene and joshua means jehovah's savior brother ram said it's the holy spirit jesus christ that's bringing us so now they come to a time where god was wanting to move his people a little bit farther so he comes here and he said we need to circumcise them again the second time and joshua made them sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskin and this is the same cause why joshua did circumcise listen to this all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt and all the people that came out were circumcised now circumcision is a type of the holy spirit to cut off circle surplus flesh i'm going to talk to you as adults if that's okay our world that the internet has taken away all innocence from the world and we think about bringing people up can you say amen to that so i'm glad that the prophet of god and the bible just brings the facts of life right before us and we talk about those things and it's written is there anything wrong with reading any verse in the bible okay so we're continuing now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness or on this journey by the way as they came forth out of egypt them they had not circumcised those people had maybe never had a separation from the world i would say this a lot of the people around our message have not never had a personal encounter with the supernatural i was talking to brother um brother aaron in the back and he was describing i don't know some people that have came in and they were in brother branham's meeting in 1961 and they he said that at the church they were kind of over on this side and brother branham was saying now this message is for them because these people wouldn't accept it and those people saw the supernatural the discernment maybe sister yarber or some of you other ones were there and saw the discernment and it triggered your heart and you followed the messenger didn't matter what they say you were there when the discernment and all those things happen and you're following a message because you saw a supernatural god and the vindication of it and it held your heart and now for many many years people have just joined the message they've just come among us they've just married in and they've never been circumcised from the things of the world brother henry you know what i'm talking about they've never separated or had an identification from the world had a real experience with god to know that this message was sent by god brother ram talks about that the baptist man comes to brother branham says brother branham he said all abraham could do is believe and brother ram said yes but god gave him the sign of circumcision he cut him away from the world and cut the world away from him and made him a separated people and now joshua's god is getting ready to do something and joshua says look we have to do this again verse number six for the children of israel walk 40 years in the wilderness to all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord what is the voice of the lord it's the word of god and you see people that are not serving the lord today because they would not obey the word of the lord this is really simple this is not rocket science this is obey the word of the lord and walk in him and keep revival in you keep life inside of you that takes some effort that takes some energy in this day we read over there in revelation chapter 3 where it was lukewarm neither hot neither cold it's just lukewarm i'm just around the message i'm just and jesus said i would that you were cold or i would i would you were hot hey i'm just kind of hanging out to kind of like a spectator you know i'm just going to vent a little bit right here is that okay we had to go they shut everything down we had to go to total streaming you know it is what it is so we were streaming there and so we got to talk and we realized people were becoming spectators and not participators and that's not what we want spectators we got enough spectators around here we need participators that's what happened around us people like man what are you crying for why are you these trials where are you going like man you're just sitting up in the bleachers as a spectator you got to get down into battle one time and run on the field and fight in the battle and get some sweat and some blood on you then you'll understand all about it and that's what we find with the streaming people just like oh that was pretty good i'll switch over to this that's pretty good um about a five sometimes we get church like that it's like ah pretty good i'll put some money for it's just like a show you know yeah go ahead and put some money in the box that's pretty good maybe a little extra this week and i'll come back next time see if you got something better what's on the show and and it just because and we don't become participators in it and so i asked the people i said now hey and they were streaming and i said all right let me ask you when we just said let's stand and read the bible did you stand up are you still sitting on the couch you're sitting on a you're a spectator you're not participating our goal in the streaming is not to spectate and people just spectate it's no it's to become take the church if we have we don't know tomorrow it might all change we all be back to that and then you're there but we should be participating i'm a part of this thing i'm praising the lord i'm worshiping virtually if i have to but i'm a part of a body of christ and if we have to go to that we have to go to that but the bible says david said i was glad when they said let us go into the house of the lord that's a whole other sermon isn't it we'll get to that but it's in the bible forsake not the assembling of yourselves together that much more as you see the day of fortune paul said i write these things unto you that you might know how to behave yourself in the house of god so where did the institution of the church come from came from the bible it's a whole another sermon my brother preached a whole sermon called church order and he tells us what the church should look like as an example i hope that's okay so we go on to say here verse number six and unto the lord and unto whom the lord swear that he would not show them the land which the lord swear unto their fathers that he would give them the land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom he had raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way verse number nine and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from you what was egypt but type of egypt was the type of the world and so there was a circumcision that rolled away the the how do you say the reproach of the world and that's what we need we need the reproach of the world separated from god's people we need to get out of the world and stop dabbling in the things of the world and that's what happened to the church we've lowered the standard down so far and the world has become religious and we all just sit together and we're just one and that's not the way it should be because the bible says in psalms 1 that the unrighteous will not stand in the congregation of the righteous and really it falls back on a preacher's job to preach hell hot and heaven high and separate there is a difference between a sinner and a saint can you say amen to that just because you sing these modern praise songs doesn't mean you're a christian you're a christian because you bear the life of the word of god out that's hard preaching isn't it but it's the word of god and that's what i as a minister um just you know he doesn't have the right to to preach his own opinion he has to preach the word of god and that's what we're trying to do we're trying to keep life in us we're trying to keep life in the church so we're not just a dead formal church i was reading over in the book of joel uh you know sometimes people just i was tempted to put in my ipad i thought no it'd be good thing if we read it in our bibles i'm big about the bible joel chapter 2 it has in the old testament joel amos obadiah jonah micah mayhem book of joel chapter 2 verse 12. the bible says therefore also now saith the lord turn ye even to me with all your heart that's what we're talking about revival in me with all of your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and wrench your heart and not your garment so there was a time when samuel and saul had done wrong and the bible says samuel rempt rent his garment he ripped and just like oh god and now joel is saying look don't rip your coat rinse your heart i think it's the thing this morning it's time to rend our heart from anything of the world the bible says if you love the world of the things of the world the love of god's not in you and say lord just rend anything of the world it's not like you take it away from me lord they come to jesus what is the greatest commandment he said thou shalt love the lord with all of your hearts with all of your soul with all of your mind and with all of your strength i got a sermon i want to talk about that tonight about brokenness jesus said this is my this bread is my body that was broken for you broken for you and i want to talk about a lot of the talented people in the world and how that they're not broken and the only thing they serve is themself and they have no service to the uh we'll talk about that tonight i was laying in bed this morning i wake up about five o'clock and i'm sitting there all right lord i you know now we got the pretty sermons and the holy spirit's taking me what about the seven visions that brother branham went and he saw the america all just nothing but craters where's your 401k and all your education and all your degrees and all that when it's nothing but craters those are prophecies that are going to come to pass the google car that drives you know the prophet 1933 has the vision he sees it the woman in purple and we see that being fulfilled and we see now lord is all of this kind and it's coming to pass he said when you see all these things happen what do you say go into depression get you some pills just uh no he said lift up your head for your redemption is coming your redemption draweth nigh it's time to leave how was it brother arnie were standing around the fire last night he said you know the bible says that knowledge shall increase and now you've got your iphone there's more computing power on an iphone than there is on the original capsule that went to the moon and now kids at 12 years old think i gotta have it i gotta have really you gotta have all that if we would just see it as the scripture being fulfilled and the last days knowledge shall increase lord help us rend your heart not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious oh i love this i don't like to preach about judgment but as a minister i have to preach about judgment but i like to preach more about mercy you know we're coming to a white throne judgment and the bible says the saints will judge the earth but we're not there right now jesus said you go and be my witnesses of mercy and forgiveness and drawing power and the blood of jesus christ cleanses that's the time that we're living that could change overnight the bible says there coming a time when let him that is filthy be filthy still let him that is holy be holy still and i don't know when that's going to be it might be by noon today it might be by four o'clock but i'm going to preach while i believe there's mercy that there is mercy because i feel something drawing in our hearts can you say amen to that jesus said no man can come except the father draws him and we're all over the place tonight this morning but i feel the holy spirit just taking us so i was dealing with a young person he said i'm just going to go do my thing and you know when i get i'll come back to the lord i said hey you know what you know what what you have your idea about jesus christ is not right you think christ is like this light switch i don't even know what this goes to i said you think you turn it on and you think you turn it on you need to get a grip on life because the bible says no man can come except the father draws him you can't even have a desire unless god gives you that desire oh blessed be the name of the lord if you have a desire this morning for god you ought to just be so thankful say lord i thank you for that desire how many people are still in bed this morning but something came in your life said get up and go to the house of god i want to talk to you i want to speak to you i can tell you that's not the devil that is jesus christ amen that wants to bring you close to him that wants to forgive you of all of our sins that wants to heal all of our sicknesses he wants to bind up the brokenhearted blessed be the name of the lord i love to preach about him he's all that we have in this world amen rend your heart he said he is gracious he's slow to anger and of kindness and repenteth him of evil blessed be the name of the lord so i was thinking about that and i was thinking about the brotherhood talks about the welch revival there were some men that went over to wales and they were trying to find the welch revival and they were there was a little policeman there swinging his baton and they said ah he's singing a song let's go talking like hey do you know where the welch revival is he said yeah the wealth revival is in me i said no no where's the building where they're having the welterweight he said no you don't understand the welch revival is in me it's inside of me and that's the christ should be in you how paul say christ in you the hope of glory he's my hope he's my life amen sister as we grow older i want to feel that tug on the other end paul said if the same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken your mortal body i want to feel the quickening power of the holy ghost i want to hear an amen from down on the inside when the word of god is quick and i want to hear the when it's quoted the holy spirit inside of you will say hey you say amen that's my word i'm stuck down inside i have no voice but your voice say amen and then brother graham said god will make your body obey your confession amen the power how's the scripture say the power that worketh in you there's a power that's working in a son and daughter of god do you believe it or do you did you just stumble into this thing just dad mom had me i'm here yeah i can't wait till i'm 18. that's what paul says you need to go work out there and say you know there was a lot of nicer better people in that bar than me that day but god found me and he chose me and he picked me up from the gutter and he brought me to where i am and maybe all i have is a desire for god you might your life might be broken in the devil you say brother daniel i don't know they didn't preach it hard enough and i went out and got entangled amen we can't change yesterday we just need to you know sometimes i like simplicity i can't change yesterday good bad and different it is what it is but i'm not going to let my yesterday determine who i am today let me say that again i'm not going to let my yesterday determine who i am today i made mistakes yesterday but i'm not the man that i was yesterday i'm a different man as the one man said a lady said you know what i'm not what i i want to be and i'm certainly not what i ought to be but i thank god i'm not what i used to be can you say amen to that i'm not what i used to be god is doing something in my life oh that's what i love to see god is doing something god is moving among us i want to see where will we be without him god i want to see you move i want to see you the doctor say look we're going to do emergency surgery but what did god say god said no not yet let's just wait a little bit and saints begin to pray amen and these signs shall follow them that believe and then the report comes like no it's changed it's not going that way it's going this way god is working prayer changes things whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe it believe it brother daniel i don't know if i believe or not faith cometh by hearing and you're in church and all of a sudden you hear the word of god and it begins to lift you up it begins to change your mind from looking from doubt and unbelief to faith then you start looking up to jesus christ faith cometh by hearing blessed be the name of the lord we've got many things written here but i don't you know i don't know how to preach but he knows how to preach he's the preacher the holy spirit is the preacher but i can tell you we need an old-fashioned revival a sin killing revival amen and i believe we want it i believe people really want to see god move in their life they want to see them in their families they want to see god heal the sick they want to see god touch people and break a heart to so hard and watch it break and watch the spirit of god move i believe i want that but the only way we're going to get is we got to get away from the world the things of the world i was one of my friend called me the other day yesterday he flew into phoenix and he's there and he said man we just played 18 rounds of golf and man it's just there and man why doesn't people just forsake everything and just move out here he's having some challenges and and that and he's got two three little girls to raise and i said look brother i said look don't lay down your cross just because they got a nice golf course up there you get away and you think you're in heaven brother man said that about florida he said i went to florida he said they take more care better care of their lawn then i do my hair and he said what they're trying to do is create a millennium listen to me trying to create a millennium without the return of jesus christ so my brother i encourage him look don't lay your cross down you have children to raise you have a family amen you have these things don't lay your cross down because the devil creates lady osea are you with me today creates a an eden satan's eden and you pretty soon want to live in satan's eden oh my let his help have vision the bible says young men shall see visions listen to me young men you're here some of you creed sitting here he's getting ready and then brother matthew and these young men sitting here i believe we should be young jesus said except you become like a little children so no matter oh how this body gets there's a spirit inside of us amen the bible says young men will have a vision the vision i want to have the vision the prophet had when he saw america all laying in craters i don't want my millennium to be in craters amen jesus said lay not up for yourselves on earth where moth and rest doth corrupt but lay up here for yourselves and treasures where moth and rust doth not corrupt and where thieves do not break through and steal there's another supernatural land it's called the kingdom of god there's a sermon about that thick that i i don't think i don't know if i brought it with me and i'd love to preach that one right the kingdom of god jesus said if my kingdom were over this world i would fight but my kingdom he said the kingdom of god is within you it's inside of you it's a kingdom i love it back in the bible how's the way when the they're talking about the angels coming to mary and said of his kingdom there shall be no end there's not going to be an end to this kingdom so i say young man let's get a real vision not 50 60 and a million dollars in the bank in a nice retirement that's all going to be ashes no let's think about 100 years from now 200 years from now on streets of gold and amen we're in a new body travel with the speed of thought walk through a wall like jesus remember he he come he appeared to his disciples he ate some bread and fish and then he walked through the wall is that what the bible says he ate the fish and he went and you know what and when he went through the wall the fish didn't hit the wall and slide down somehow when he ate it the fish became supernatural and went through the wall too oh brothers and sisters that's not science fiction the bible says we doth not we do not know yet what we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him we're going to be like and we're going to have a body that's changing like his glorious body i believe it my bible says it i tell you when i believe the bible things change in my life oh blessed be the name of the lord isn't he good praise the lord page one you all just keep pulling in so many different directions i don't know why the lord put this on my heart but i just was thinking about this and they asked brother branham this question just about sunday i'm watching the clock back there what time do you all close i'm not one of those revelation 10 preachers that believes in time shall be no more but i do believe that this is the most important thing in our lives is our walk with christ because the doubt the bible says the devil come to steal kill and destroy he wants to destroy every one of your homes he wants to destroy your faith in jesus christ and how brother ramsey your attitude towards the word of god will determine your eternal destiny and your attitude towards the word of god will determine where you are a year from now your attitude towards the word of god will determine where you are a year from now like i don't care about that i'm going to go do my thing and then the lord comes and you find yourself in hell remember the rich man he just wanted to drop a wire amen this is how we do this in sunday school remember he went to hell he only wanted one thing i want a drop of water that's all i want to cool my tongue from these flames it's been almost a year and a half since i've been here so if i tell a story and i tell it again you forgive me but that's reality and if you know me i don't like i am a salesperson and i don't like salespeople because i don't like the pressure like you just tell me what is the truth and i'll make a decision based on the truth and so when i come up here brother bran tells us that about scaring people and emotions he said don't he tells me as a minister don't do that just preach the truth and you'll know the truth and the truth will make you free bible says as many as believed him to them gave he power to be a sons of god so i'm not here to scare you i'm here to tell you a truth if you want to see you know think nearsighted and make a million dollars be a great name and have a plaque and all that stuff and just live and die and go to a devil's hell you do it but if you want to realize that there's something that told you to come to the house of the lord and god is pulling at your heart and saying look why don't you repent of your sins and if you've never been baptized i'm not here to encourage you here i'm here to provoke you because the bible says provoke one another unto love and good works because the bible says in mark 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and i want to see every one of you save that's my desire to see every one of you saved and if you're not baptized i want you to get baptized is that fair oh brother daniel that's just selfish well i don't know i just want you to be saved i want you to be with me i love you you know as a shepherd that's and i quoted it last night we're in the back room praying jesus said greater love hath no man that a man laid down his life for his friends how do you know i am genuine because i love you how did jesus tell peter he said if you love me feed my sheep so that's what genuine life for god so loved that he gave i only have so many heartbeats i'm 52 years old the end is in sight and i'm not on a beach today i'm standing here giving my heartbeats for you because i love you and i love your children and i was thinking about that i don't know how to get through these notes let's just skip them i was thinking about that because some people don't know what a shepherd is and they think and it kind of like a a pastor is like a shepherd he's uh he's you know so some people change and they've in this day and age they've made it a good organizer a socialite uh a um a talented person maybe even a good speaker that makes a but that's a lot it can be that but that's not necessarily the case a shepherd is one that keeps sheep on the path to a destination is that simple shepherd is someone that keeps sheep on a path to reach their destination this is really simple but revelations chapter four john said after the church ages the seventh church age we live in revelation chapter three we read it right there but the next verse is i heard a voice as a trumpet from heaven and i saw a door open saying come up higher which was the rapture program says it was the rapture so if this is the door and our goal we're in revelation 3 to make it to revelation 4 which is come up hither there's a rapture to go through that and that's our goal is to get sheep to go in the rapture then that is everything that a shepherd does is to keep people on the path how david say thy rod and they staff they comfort me they nudge me in the right way what is the staff it's the word of god we were kidding about that the other day because david said thy rod which is the word of god and thy staff and we did that like this the ministry staff and the rod of the word of god and the staff all the people around you their job is to help you keep you on the path and as a minister we have a goal to reach a rapture can you say amen to that i was talking to the brothers yesterday now if we change the goal post and we change that and say our goal is not to make the rapture it's just to build a big church let's all be friends everybody love everybody and just have and just fill and we'll play basketball and oh man we'll just dude but wait wait wait we've missed the goal the goal is to go in a rapture to get our hearts ready for jesus christ doesn't matter if a person's ball-headed and can't speak and doesn't know their abcs if he can be a shepherd that tries to get sheep to stay on the path and reach the goal and go into the rapture i say brother daniel that's really simple it is simple but sometimes simple helps us sometimes we make life so complicated and so we see kind of where we are and we see that a shepherd when you're all in the valley it's all green who needs shepherd right but now when you start navigating on the side of a cliff and then you hear the coyotes roaring over here and roaring over here then you say where is the shepherd to lead me through this treacherous time that we live in and waterfalls and lions and all those things and then but we've got to stay on the path because if we follow the path we're sure to meet the goal right we follow the word of god we're sure to meet the goal but there's so many things that want to pull us off the path to glory we had to go to a seminar the other day for roofing we were in minnesota and they were talking about google it's all right to talk about a couple of the wolves and the lions and the waterfalls and the cliffs that are right around us and says the number one site that people visit is google the second site that most visited in the world is youtube everybody used to google how do i fix this and now they don't want to read about it they want somebody to show them and they're showing how youtube will come to become the number one number one site visited in the world and you don't think that's a cliff you look at something innocently and then all the other suggested stuff and then you're like how did i end up here you don't have to say man just look at me all right how did i fall all the way down here and then god brings a man from indiana that screams at you and says shake yourself what are you doing and the prophet screamed against tv i don't have a tv but now he talks start talking about hollywood and all the things of hollywood and now the glamour and all this and and what is the three things that usually get a man money women and popularity what is all the social media about how many likes is that popularity and people get people that dislike them i don't like it and then they go commit suicide what about those lions that are there and the roaring and the cliffs that are all around us powerful powerful things kingdoms kingdoms we have a president of the united states and all of a sudden instagram and google and facebook says hey you can't be on our platform and they shut the mouth of the president showing that they are more powerful kingdoms than even the president of the united states and some of us get captive by these things and and and and we and we're out here i think i said that probably last time i found facebook in the bible james 4 4 he that is a friend of the world is an enemy of god so when you see something that's wrong and you know you shouldn't do it but you go ahead and click like on that you have just become an enemy of god you said i like that i'm a friend of that may god shake ourselves i don't know why we're going down this road maybe just the holy spirit is the great shepherd right he's the shepherd trying to keep us all in the sheep it's not a man it's the shepherd trying to keep us on the ship on the straight and narrow road and get away from the world and the things of the world brother daniel did you say we couldn't have faith i didn't say that i said but there's a screaming coyote in a lion that's trying to destroy your family and trying to destroy your soul the bible says we are not ignorant of his devices i got another sermon about that thick on the devices of the devil so you come back to church all right i'll say it like this um christ is a mystery of god right at the beginning brother branham said if god's in you god goes to church remember that he said it and it's bitterness he said and you get that in your heart you don't have the desire to go to church he said your place is at the altar go back and listen to christ the mystery of god so where does it put all this roaming in the wilderness people that haven't been circumcised from the world and they love the world and the things of the world more than the love of god wow lord help us the devil has an agenda it's to get the people off the road my son william he he does business and different things and he had a facebook thing he said dad all i did was was was um quote a scripture and post the scripture on there and facebook banned me from that area of facebook because i just posted a scripture you don't think they got a database with every bible verse in there and when you put a bible verse up there why because the bible says the word of god is quick and it's powerful powerful blessed be the name of the lord actually let me just say this the very first time god spoke out of the mountain the people said well we can't handle the voice of god let dumb it down a little bit and go through moses and bring it to us in a human way because the word of god is so powerful oh may god help us say lord speak to me and he'll speak he's speaking today that's what revelation chapter or hebrews chapter 4 says the word of god is quick and powerful and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart the word of god is a law goes he's going down and some of you are just looking at me with the eye your eyes because it's not brother daniel speaking to you it's the holy spirit speaking to you he is still discerning where we live i maybe didn't even get in your closet didn't get out there under that thing that you buried out in your garage but the holy spirit got there we don't need a list of do's and don'ts we just need the holy ghost we just need the holy ghost and i want it i say lord help me lord i want to go in the rapture that's my desire is to go on a rapture and anything that's around me that's not like christ i want to get it away from me blessed be the name of the lord i just want to read this quote brother and we went through this the other day in church but iran was talking about he said you see in a church a pastor he's going through the five offices and he said the pastor that pastor is a special person he's built to where he can put up with the fusses of the people he's a burden bearer he's the ox of the team he's a man that can sit down with uh somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them two families and take neither side and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness he's a pastor he knows how to do things he knows how to do things and i'll just leave that at that let's talk about another thing about a shepherd sometimes a shepherd as sheep gets sick and the shepherd knows his sheep he has to live with the sheep he smells with the sheep they go in the thing and they close the door and he lays down and he becomes the protection of the sheep the wolves don't come in but there's another thing about a shepherd when he knows that a sheep's sick and sometimes there's a rock that has a mineral that that sheep needs and and that he needs to get the mineral out of that rock inside of that sheep but sheep just don't like the word of god sometimes they don't so what he does is he takes honey and he smears it all over the rock and that sheep just goes up starts licking that nice sweet honey and after he gets through the honey then that mineral that's in that rock begins to be absorbed into the sheep sometimes we get sick in our body and everything we need is in jesus christ the word of god and that shepherd will just maybe just a nice little kind text maybe a little song on the piano you come into the presence of the lord and the great shepherd is putting a little honey on that amen can you say amen to that a little word here a little kindness there how much love heals sometimes somebody just says hey i love you i shook somebody's hand the other i said god bless you friend brother sent me a text back he said you don't know how much that meant to me it's a cold world out there brother branham in the last brother said in the last day the love will be he said the love will only be among the bride the elected amen i say we start loving one another i said it's time we start loving one another we need love only perfect love is going to be there and we have the stigma you know i'm 52 years old i got a few miles behind me we got this stigma when i say i love you we think that we have to agree with that person i love my wife and we disagree so much on so much stuff and you know what we do we're adults we agree to disagree i think i'd ought to be over there and when you get together all you can see is that needs to be over there forget about that over there let's just be adults and get above the one percent we disagree on just be brothers and sisters and look at the 99 we do agree on is that good is that wisdom i say lord let's just amen and so what the persecution has always made the church stronger and i don't want the persecution i'd rather just say lord what's the persecution it puts all the little nonsense away from us and we start agreeing on the things that are important jesus christ the blood of jesus christ the message of the hour so much that we have in common young people appreciate that about adults right stop your fussing and let's get together and be christians lord help us i'm just to skip over a lot of this so samson he got in the place he made a mistake like all of us uh sons of god they don't make mistakes yeah they do there's samson called by god he was one of the judges he goes out there and he had a problem with women he got caught by delilah not because he wanted to he just had a weakness and all of us have a weakness and so here he is and he's fallen to this place and he's grinding at the mill going through the grind of life why because he had he had got away from christ how many people are roaming in the wilderness because they got away from the great fountain filled with blood they got away from this holy spirit and the presence of god they were enticed by the world out there and it was a real enticement and here's samson up there and his eyes are out he's just grinding through paying alimony or paying his bills and life means nothing and oh brothers and sisters i don't want to be there but sometimes we can go there and the devil will tell you look at your end you're just this is the end you ever been there in your life i feel like man i just made a mess of this thing but it wasn't the end because his hair started to grow back he had a covenant with god so they bring him to hold him to the pillars and he's standing there at the pillars and brother ram said he could reach back and feel his hair growing back and knew he had a covenant he knew god had touched him you go back we don't have time to preach those sermons the bible says and the spirit of the lord began to move on samson at the camp you ever been to a youth camp and the holy spirit began to move on you maybe you went and made mistakes but that doesn't change the fact that god moved on you one time and god is not an indian giver if he moved on you one time there's a channel amen that's there and if you just move all the junk out away from it say lord i want to get back to my first love i think it says over there amen do your first works over and get back to your first love and here's samson they bring him to the pillars he said bring my my i put my hands on the pillars and and he prays he said lord remember me can you say that today wherever you are say lord remember me remember those times experiences i had with you and i'll say if you're not closer to god than today than you ever were you're backslid brother dan you just make this analogy so simple yeah we're climbing this hill and if you're not farther up that hill than you were before you've slid back in your christian life but that's not the end samson was there too i love the bible i love it it's written for our example so there was people before me that made mistakes and so he comes to a place he knew he had a covenant with god and he said lord remember me and he said lord strengthen me we need strength can you say it lord i need strength today lord i need the strength of the holy ghost and then he said lord avenge me of my enemies said lord let me die with my enemies amen we need to die to those things that have tried to pull us aside can you say amen to that you know whatever it is that you in your life you say look i want to die to this thing lord let me die to it maybe it's a hidden sin maybe it's a sin that so easily beset you it's like sam says lord remember me lord strengthen me right now that i can pray the next part of the prayer lord avenge me of my enemies let me destroy this thing the bible says he died but he killed more in his death than he did in his whole life amen i want to talk about that a little bit tonight about dying when we think we die to ourself we think it's the end but really it's not it's only the beginning blessed be the name of the lord i was just thinking about that because revelation chapter 3 14 there at the 20th verse in there he said if any man hear my voice and will open the door i will come into him you feel that little gentleness of the holy spirit here i'm not screaming i'm just trying to talk really soft because the holy spirit is speaking when he speaks then we just get real quiet because he's knocking and he said if any man can hear my voice it's not an auditory some of you all are scientists and you understand but it's it's beyond that it's a sixth sense it's when that sixth sense starts speaking to your heart knocking he said if any man will hear my voice i stand at the door knock if he'll open up his heart i will come into him oh i love the promises of god sometimes people you get lied to in the fine print and all that stuff but the word of god said if you hear my voice and you open the door i the creator will come into you and i'll sup with you and i'll fellowship with you and if you're fellowshipping with the god of mercy and the god of forgiveness why would he ever send you to hell i want to fellowship with you that's what we're coming for to communion tonight it's called communion because i want to talk to my creator maybe you've got a problem that's so big maybe you're sick in your body and say i want to go to the great physician and i want to talk to him i want to commune with him and say lord what about my sickness what about my sins or what about this situation what is and let's have a communion service tonight with the lord it's more than just a form i need to go up there and do this and this no it's a communion with jesus christ i tell you what i want to be hot for the whole for the lord jesus i want everything else in the world to be secondary to my love to jesus christ can you say amen to that i want to love him if i get sick he's there to heal me if i do wrong he's there to forgive me and i believe it's there i want to be baptized with the holy ghost i also want to be baptized in water if you haven't been baptized in water we've got a pool and i don't know how it all works but we'll get you baptized just like listen to the prophet's message if you're here today and you're not listening to the prophet's message and you want to you come see me or the elders and we'll figure out a way for you to hear god's prophet god sent a voice in this day the voice of god's prophet to guide us to to keep us in the path that we can go in a rapture today i don't have time to preach the whole rapture message but the first phase of it was a shout right brother iran said it's the living word of god to gather the people together and that's what this church is about it's the living word of god has come through a prophet and we're gathered together rallying around the son of man ministry that came in our day and what's the next part of it is the next part is the dead in christ will rise first we're looking for a resurrection looking for the saints to rise and brother green and the different ones that have gone on maybe you've got loved ones and the bible says the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive shall be changed in a moment and twinkling of an eye and then we'll be caught up to meet the lord in the air so if i throw out theology i want to see jesus that's all great but the bible says that the dead in christ will rise first and we'll be caught up with them to meet the lord in the air so don't throw those other people return ministry under the bus they have a truth see how people put little tags on people and then we throw people under the bus no we need to get back to the bible they look at us say look you got long hair skirt prophet you're a cult long hair skirt prophet called like paul said in the way that's called heresy so worship by the god of our fathers you can put whatever label on you i'm a christian i believe the bible what we believe is comes from the bible that's what's a matter or a message sometimes we get what we believe out here in the stars somewhere we need to say we believe the bible amen there's a lot of tags and we want to know the scripture amen you'll know the truth and the truth will make us free i believe we're gathered in the first phase of the rapture the message has come and this day have gathered us together and the saints are going to rise we're going to see him then we're going to be caught up to meet the lord in the air is that what the bible says that's not what brother daniel says is what the bible says i want to believe what the bible says and i believe that i believe god heals we were talking about that my wife thinking about that my wife last fall got really sick and really sick in her body we didn't know if we were going to have her around but we anointed her with oil and prayed for her and god healed her she's a he god's a healer i was thinking about that and my friend the other day i don't think i give the testimony here he's seven years with chronic pain in his back took pain medicine came together and there was some sin in his life and he he he confessed his sin we anointed him with oil and prayed the prayer of faith and he walked in my warehouse and i walked in there and he was down on his knees praying he come back out he said i haven't had a pain he said god completely healed me my god is a healer some of you probably heard the testament i think you all were there at the your dad was there up at the funeral or the you know the wedding when wesley got married up in up in pennsylvania and the little boy they had him on his shoulder and they dropped zachary's tears off his shoulder and they were holding him and he fell off and he hit the floor and landed on the concrete and and uh he's about six foot tall and dropped her off somebody did and dropped her and she and so brother um jonathan said when i walked up or what russell was telling brother russell was telling me i come up here when i was looking this way and when i was looking this way he said i knew it was serious and so they just called us brother jonathan we're at the reception the wedding because the bible says he's a very present help in the time of trouble when i get in trouble i go to jesus christ brother arnie i think you were there and we came together brother mcfadden came together and the different brothers we came and we just laid our hands on that little baby and prayed the prayer of faith and the bible says and the lord shall raise them up the next morning we were sitting and then we had a little place we all got together there and we're together and jonathan if you know he works in the emergency room draw the jonathan singer and he calmly was playing with the little girl had her up on his lap and i was watching what he's doing he did the the sight test he snapped his both eyes just went the other one on this side both eyes perfectly warm do it up top down god had completely healed the baby our god is a healer he's a deliverer he's a savior he's a holy ghost baptizer he's the same yesterday today and forever does the holy spirit witness you that in your life because that's his word i'm quoting and something inside of you is saying i wrote that word i wrote that word that's me that wrote that word amen the bible says the word of god holy men of god were moved by the holy ghost and they wrote the word of god and so when you quote the word of god the holy spirit inside you say that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth you as a person may not even believe in the holy spirit say i believe it i wrote it i want to surrender to the power that doth already work in me amen i want to have a revival in me i don't want to say where's the message the message is right here amen and where's that church brother madam is trying to get a church turned back to the faith of our fathers we should be that church amen we should be that church it's a challenge it's a challenge to me do you have to take up your cross how'd jesus say and that's what i told brother brother when he called yesterday he's like all the things and i said brother don't lay your cross down jesus said who whosoever is not willing to take up his cross and follow me he's not worthy to be my disciple whole other sermon jesus wasn't looking for followers he was looking for disciples people that were willing to be disciplined by jesus christ i want to be disciplined by christ is it a cross yeah do you have to forfeit some of your natural goals and all those things but the bible says what would a man give in exchange for his soul what would a prophet a man if he gained the whole world and lost his soul you see we're the church of god we're the presence of god sometimes men we get out there and we get their ambitions and we get there in this and then we come to the church of god and holy spirit says wait just a minute what's your priorities to live 80 years and have a million dollars or live eternally with a new body a glorified body becomes more real as we grow older and we we know you're closer to 20 than i am brother amen amen that new body just one how's the bible say if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved there's one already waiting for me and i just step right over into that new body and we're young again oh that's the reality of the word of god i want to know him in the power of his resurrection hallelujah how many want that revival inside of you amen how many men would raise your hand and say i want the revival in me hey man you know i think it would be good if we as brothers just consecrated ourselves to the lord where does it start it starts with men that are willing to separate from the world and say i'm going to take a stand you ever heard that song take a stand take a stand for christ it starts with men have a backbone holy spirit comes over man i want to be one of those men how many men would raise your hand and say i want to be one of those men holy ghost phil i wonder if we could do this is a little different i don't have a form i didn't print a form up 20 years ago and pass it out but i wonder if the men that really say i want revival in me would just come and stand and let us pray together if you just come and be on musicians coming amen brother matt if you lead us in a little song how many men would say i want to dedicate my life to the lord brother daniel what you're saying i want revival in me just come on up front brothers we'll make i don't know how we'll do this but let's just consecrate ourselves to the lord that's real men to say i want to take a stand for jesus christ yes hallelujah amen how are we going to do this let's turn let's just make a circle right here isn't this good sisters have watched real men they're taking a stand let's have the brothers on that side look this way and this brother's this side look this way and let's just form a circle we might have to go up that way where's my deacons at go and just have them make a double row around that way just come right here brothers and face that way if you will amen let's just be christians amen blessed be the name of the lord that's it all your sisters ought to be that's my dad up there that's my husband that's my grandpa up there he's taking a stand for jesus christ he loves jesus christ some of you wanted that for years to see your husband or your son get out of his chair and stand make a step for jesus christ say i want to be on the side with real men with a backbone amen hallelujah i believe god's doing something today man amen let's just stand like this i don't know the covet i don't know how your maybe we just put our hands on one another's back and man well brother aaron come over here beside me amen hallelujah where's brother peter at brother peter come here amen where's brother you're

we'll just put our hands each brother on the back little buddy if you'll stand right there amen each one just go and we'll just go all around amen let's join together in prayer the bible says where two or three you agree is touching anything let's pray that god will make us real men of god amen you pray in your own way pray like you pray [Music] [Music] is [Music] thank you [Music] and his presence is wonderful amen there's a little song we sing in the name of jesus in the name of jesus we have the victory do you know that song amen let's sing it together oh in the name of jesus in the

believers do we have will you raise your hand say i'm a believer amen we need you okay we've got some sick people among us but the bible says these signs will follow them that believe in my name they'll cast out devils they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover says over in another place in james don't you love the word of god god brother ram said how was it job didn't even have a bible noah didn't have a bible just heard god 120 years just being on a boat out there he said but god knew that in this day our mental capacity would be diminished in the hybrid food and our faith we didn't know so he'd give us the bible when daniel's faith gets weak he just goes to the scripture and says i don't know and you go to james 5 14 the bible says is any sick among you let him call let him pray is any mary let him sing psalms if any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith can you say the prayer of faith the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up can you say amen to that how many have had that happen to him and say it's happened to me look at the look at the hands raised hey man you know it's one of those things you try and it work you do it again it works and it works after a while you become a believer lord this works lord it works i'm a believer this works amen and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him the bible says confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed and then this such a powerful thing in the bible the bible says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much you may not think that you're doing much in the world but the bible says the fervent prayer of a righteous man and avails much in the kingdom of god there's been a request some that are sick here and so we're just going to change that can we sing that song the great physician now is here amen let's sing it together if you're sick in your body i'm going to ask the ministers the deacons to come amen we're going to anoint you with oil and pray the prayer of faith amen i believe god will raise you up god will heal you he healed my wife and healed that little i think it was tears of wallace the other day amen he'll hear him heal you today and then he'll start he said how jesus he went and prayed and they said from that hour they begin to amend the man tells us that ten percent of of healing is miracles and the other ninety percent is divine healing when that power that works in you begins to work and it begins to change the situation and go a different direction we gotta believe it how long does your faith last how long does your healing last as long as your faith lasts brother branham how long are you saved as long as your faith lasts i don't believe i'm saved then you're not saved how long does your healing last as long as you confess i'm healed by his stripes i'm healed he's an intercessor based on your confession we need to confess by his stripes i'm healed lord i believe your word lord i believe your word by his stripes i'm healed i'm getting better lord i believe i'm getting better they prayed for me i'm getting better amen sing it brother matt [Music] is [Music] um [Music] jesus [Music] is [Music] sweet

amen i was just wondering where brother peter was i wanted him to dismiss us in prayer did he come on up here brother he keeps disappearing i appreciate men of god that want to give their life and these elders brother aaron johnson and brother peter and each one brother ed and brother arnie brother jordan they've given their life to help have us a place we could worship aren't you thankful for that today men of god give their life that we could have a place amen come back tonight we're going to try to have communion have a real communion with the lord jesus you know we brother said the catholics have are closer to the scripture than we are he said every time they came together they broke bread maybe we have a tradition this covets kind of pushed it out in the bible they broke bread every time they come together oh i'd tell you do us good we get together people get together for bridal showers and birthday parties and sports and all those things but in the bible when they got together they had communion and they realized yeah we're here for this and this but the main thing that brings us together is the death of jesus christ you see how the church gets mixed up in the world instead of the church being the church we're together as christians because we are christians it's time we let the church be the church of god and let the cross of jesus christ and the blood of jesus christ be the thing that joins us all together not our fishing trip and our hunting trip and the status and is everybody with me sometimes we get our eyes out here in the world instead of what the church of god really is it's full of power it's full of glory it's without spot it's without wrinkle there's a church that christ is coming back for it's a holy ghost filled church it's a blood washed church i want to be part of that church i want the revival to be inside of me i don't want to look back say well back in brother branham's day and i appreciate all those stories but i want the god of william branham to live in our hearts today and i believe he's the same yesterday today and forever i got to stop preaching amen brother peter [Music] isn't he good to us amen let's pray father
