[4:30] prayer
[4:31] celebrating Mother's Day today
[4:34] I thought
[4:36] I looked up in the scriptures I said how
[4:38] many times the word mother is mentioned
[4:41] and it's many many many times come on up
[4:44] brother Ronnie
[4:45] I was trying to find one that was
[4:47] something sweet and soft and
[4:52] most of the time I was saying if you
[4:54] dishonor your mother you're in trouble
[4:56] I found that quite a bit
[4:59] but today it's it's good to know thank
[5:02] God for Godly mothers who raised us who
[5:05] watched over us who kept us
[5:07] did this a few times because we needed
[5:09] it
[5:10] appreciate that
[5:11] [Music]
[5:18] Mother's Day I
[5:19] for myself I'm giving an opportunity
[5:21] here so I'll take it
[5:23] I appreciate my mother
[5:26] and uh you know Mom
[5:29] I was not an easy child
[5:32] I hear a rough way to go
[5:35] and uh but you know she she prayed for
[5:37] me
[5:40] and just a little testimony that I'll
[5:41] pray
[5:42] my uh I had met my wife Susan and we
[5:46] decided we were going to go to Houston
[5:47] Texas and
[5:49] try it out there and uh so I let my hair
[5:53] grow and got an ear ring and you know
[5:56] did the whole thing
[5:58] and I got a little job and
[6:00] one morning I was going to work
[6:04] it was off the Hempstead Highway
[6:05] northeast Houston
[6:07] and I had the FM radio on and I was just
[6:10] living the good life you know
[6:13] had the rock and roll and
[6:15] turned it off and
[6:18] until the presence come in the car
[6:23] and something inside said
[6:27] your mother is praying for you
[6:30] how about that
[6:32] I wasn't seeking it
[6:34] you know God seeks us
[6:38] and
[6:40] I was I remember I was crying
[6:44] and I knew my mom was praying for me
[6:48] you know God is mindful of us and those
[6:51] of us that have mothers that
[6:54] have taught us about the Lord and and
[6:56] taught us the right things
[6:58] oh my how blessed we are
[7:01] if we could just go to our Lord this
[7:04] morning in prayer
[7:06] Heavenly Father
[7:07] I come to you and so do these people
[7:09] with grateful hearts for the wonderful
[7:12] gift you've given us children as our

[7:16] and Lord those that weren't as fortunate
[7:18] father
[7:20] who said you are our mother our father
[7:22] our sister and our brother so those that
[7:25] did not have Mother's Lord you were the
[7:28] mother and we thank you for that father

[19:52] today how many love them for that tell
[19:54] them you love him say Lord I love you I
[19:56] appreciate you thank you Lord and as I
[20:00] think about it I'm Amazed that he loved
[20:03] me I look at myself sometimes I say why
[20:06] would he care for something like that
[20:08] is
[20:14] [Music]
[20:25] I
[20:27] [Music]

[21:12] [Music]
[21:21] it is amazing that care for somebody
[21:24] like me and I appreciate
[21:27] I way back when we were first dating
[21:31] and marriage you know how how the wives
[21:34] have to raise the husbands most of the
[21:36] time and strain them out and teach them
[21:38] hopefully over time we learn
[21:41] on the bottom of a card I used to say
[21:43] your little boy
[21:45] because I needed another mother
[21:47] today when I gave her a card that's what
[21:49] I reminded I'm still your little boy
[21:51] still take care of me but I appreciate
[21:54] that he loves us
[21:56] we have a prayer request
[21:58] written I didn't see another here
[22:02] and when I glanced at it
[22:04] I'm glad I read it twice
[22:06] [Music]
[22:07] because I read it and don't get this
[22:10] spread around but this is what I read
[22:12] that brother John Hall had passed away
[22:13] but it says brother John has two very
[22:17] important prayer requests
[22:19] and I'm glad that's all it is
[22:21] because when I first read it it shocked
[22:23] me for a moment then I read it again
[22:25] if we'll stand together
[22:28] you have a need
[22:30] a desire
[22:31] sometimes we raise our hands and maybe
[22:34] not something specific or intention but
[22:36] we just I'm raising my hand Lord I need
[22:39] you
[22:40] I need to hear from you Michelle let's
[22:42] just bow our hands Lord you've seen the
[22:45] hands raised in the hearts here each one
[22:48] represented and you know what it is
[22:51] maybe to one it would seem like just
[22:53] something real simple and Lord would you
[22:56] really be concerned about something like
[22:58] this it's just
[22:59] maybe it just seems real light
[23:02] and to others Lord there's some heavy
[23:04] burdens as my brother John Hall very
[23:06] important prayer request and
[23:08] some things that were saying Lord we're
[23:09] going to commit it completely to you I
[23:11] there's nothing I can do about it Lord
[23:13] but commit it to you and trust in you
[23:15] Lord
[23:16] would you bring comfort and peace Lord
[23:18] healing or healing to needed Lord
[23:20] answers to questions that they might
[23:22] have Lord that maybe it's troubling them
[23:24] Lord
[23:25] a mother a father Lord calling out as
[23:29] brother Ronnie said his mother was
[23:30] praying for him maybe they're praying
[23:32] for a loved one a son a daughter a close
[23:35] one today Lord that is not serving you
[23:37] hasn't given their heart to you Lord
[23:40] send that prayer over there to their
[23:41] hearts Lord today if he goes to you to
[23:43] them Lord
[23:45] and Lord and draw them back to you Lord
[23:47] is our prayer Lord and we thank you for
[23:49] that
[23:49] for your grace and your mercy Lord above

[32:48] said there was very little music at home
[32:51] when when he was a young man

[39:01] when he saw the armies of the Lord
[39:06] surround and sometimes I feel like Jonah
[39:14] when he looked toward the temple there
[39:19] was no longer bound
[39:22] and sometimes I feel like
[39:26] Lazarus and he walked on out of that
[39:32] grave
[39:34] and sometimes I feel God's arms around
[39:40] me when he tells me be not afraid
[39:46] for he's the god of Elisha and his
[39:51] armies right there the god of Jonah and
[39:58] I know he cares
[40:04] you must come forth he can't say peace

[41:31] come back to life and you just remember
[41:37] young David
[41:40] as he ran out
[41:44] the face Goliath and you just remember
[41:51] Jesus
[41:53] when he told her your sins are all gone
[41:59] that very same Jesus is saying today
[42:05] that there are none to
[42:09] unworthy to come for he's the god of the
[42:15] Ezekiel he could bring in
[42:18] life
[42:20] the god of David for you he will fight
[42:26] The God Who will give living water to
[42:32] drink and his blood will make worthy
[42:41] of yesterday
[42:44] and he still got today

[56:48] it reads like this
[56:50] for the preaching of the Cross is to
[56:53] them that perish foolishness but unto us
[56:56] which are saved it is the power of God
[56:59] for it is written I will destroy the
[57:03] wisdom of the wise and will bring to
[57:05] nothing the understanding of the
[57:07] prudence

[57:10] where is the Scribe where is the
[57:13] disputer of this world hath not God made
[57:16] foolishness the wisdom of this world
[57:19] for after that in the wisdom of God the

[58:40] relax and enjoy the Tucson Tabernacle we
[58:44] got some really good people here God
[58:47] bless you all and and welcome
[58:50] we had a uh we had a youth event
[58:53] um
[58:54] on Saturday or Friday night
[58:57] and uh it was really a blessing to me
[59:00] and maybe I got the most out of it but
[59:02] there was we had we had a bunch of
[59:04] um we had the younger ones here and and
[59:06] I surprised the kids with uh I rented a
[59:10] lamb like a real one
[59:13] and uh so so we I guess it was a sister
[59:16] Angela I guess it was a two-for-one
[59:17] offer so we got two Lambs that came and
[59:20] and the family they were uh kind of some
[59:22] Rancher type people the 4-H people so
[59:26] they they came in and and I was telling
[59:29] the story
[59:30] at the beginning because I wanted to
[59:32] surprise the kids and I wanted to make
[59:34] this lamb I wanted them to know what
[59:36] this meant so I was talking about the
[59:39] Book of Leviticus and how that when
[59:43] an offering was made
[59:46] that it had to be something had to give
[59:49] its life something had to pay
[59:51] for our sins it had to be something that
[59:54] was innocent that had no sin
[59:58] because you can't pay a bill if you
[1:00:00] don't have money in the bank
[1:00:02] and that's how that's that's I described
[1:00:05] it a little bit and I said so what would
[1:00:07] happen
[1:00:08] is this person that wanted to make a
[1:00:10] sacrifice he would take this defenseless
[1:00:12] lamb
[1:00:13] and he would put his head his face to
[1:00:16] the Lamb's face his head to the Lamb's
[1:00:18] head and he would say that I give my
[1:00:22] sins over to this little lamb
[1:00:27] and then because God required death for
[1:00:32] sin
[1:00:33] and then this um this little lamb
[1:00:38] the priest would take it and he would
[1:00:40] cut this Lamb's throat
[1:00:43] and this little lamb would die for the
[1:00:46] sins of this person that lied or that
[1:00:49] cheated or that stole
[1:00:51] and it's funny the little guy I don't
[1:00:53] know if they're here this morning are
[1:00:56] they
[1:00:57] it's a neat family the kids you know
[1:00:59] they were just
[1:01:00] um like farmer kids neat little kids uh
[1:01:03] probably shouldn't say this
[1:01:05] but I'm going to say it anyways the uh
[1:01:07] the the little the little guys look like
[1:01:09] you ever see the little kids in uh Mad
[1:01:11] Max a long time ago with the long hair
[1:01:14] and run around they look like that man
[1:01:17] they were just there's these these tough
[1:01:19] little guys and
[1:01:21] they came in they they were listening
[1:01:23] they were listening as I was as I was
[1:01:25] talking about this and I was talking
[1:01:27] about that that the sins of this man
[1:01:29] that that lied or cheated would come on
[1:01:32] upon this lamb and the little guy goes
[1:01:35] that's not fair
[1:01:39] and I was like huh you're getting it
[1:01:42] you're getting it that this lamb had to
[1:01:45] die
[1:01:46] for the sins of this man
[1:01:49] so then I went to to John chapter one
[1:01:54] and I said now
[1:01:57] there was John the Baptist who was a
[1:01:59] prophet of God and he's there in the
[1:02:02] Jordan River and he sees this man
[1:02:06] walking up to him
[1:02:08] and he looks at it he looks at this man
[1:02:12] and he says these words he says Behold
[1:02:17] the Lamb of God that takes away the sins
[1:02:22] of the world
[1:02:25] and the little guy
[1:02:27] I noticed he looked at me
[1:02:29] and I asked the kids I said
[1:02:33] so what do you think happened
[1:02:37] to this man Jesus and I said Behold the
[1:02:41] Lamb of God that takes away the sins of
[1:02:44] the world
[1:02:45] and the little guy with the long hair
[1:02:49] he said they killed him
[1:02:55] he got it
[1:02:57] that simple little that simple little
[1:03:01] message he understood that this lamb
[1:03:05] that had no sin
[1:03:07] in the Old Testament they would
[1:03:08] sacrifice that and then Here Comes This
[1:03:11] one Jesus who had no sin
[1:03:15] and they he was killed
[1:03:18] for the sins of others and I told the
[1:03:21] little guy I said I said brother you
[1:03:22] know now you know more than 90 percent
[1:03:24] of Christians in the world
[1:03:26] that you understand that so we went out
[1:03:29] and and saw the Lambs uh remember their
[1:03:32] names
[1:03:37] and tinkle
[1:03:40] I think it was tinkle jelly and tinkle
[1:03:43] because tinkle tinkle lived up to his
[1:03:44] name
[1:03:45] yeah
[1:03:50] they're very cute so what was neat is
[1:03:53] these Lambs come out and they were big
[1:03:55] you think it's this little lamb you
[1:03:57] think of this little this little thing
[1:03:58] you know you always see pictures of
[1:04:00] Jesus and he's always holding a lamb and
[1:04:01] it's this little tiny thing well
[1:04:04] these were bigger
[1:04:07] and I was like I first saw him I was
[1:04:08] like well that's not a lamb
[1:04:10] that's a that's like a sheep well it was
[1:04:14] a lamb
[1:04:15] and it brought my mind back to Leviticus
[1:04:19] and it said that this lamb will be of
[1:04:22] one year old
[1:04:23] and without spot or blemish
[1:04:26] and I was so blessed I was looking I was
[1:04:28] saying okay this isn't how I had my
[1:04:30] picture this is this lamb right here is
[1:04:33] it's it's grown kind of
[1:04:36] and and as I was looking at it without
[1:04:38] spot or blemish I said I wonder
[1:04:41] I said
[1:04:44] did you have these in 4-H and then I
[1:04:46] don't know Sister Angela one of them
[1:04:47] said this is the Pima County champion
[1:04:52] so I thought wow here is this lamb that
[1:04:56] is about it and they said it was 11
[1:04:58] months old
[1:04:59] so this lamb was the exact same age as
[1:05:03] the Lambs were that were brought to
[1:05:04] slaughter and this lamb was the Pima
[1:05:07] County Champion so it was without
[1:05:10] spotter blemish I got the chills
[1:05:12] thinking about it we thought they got
[1:05:14] them chills right now thinking about it
[1:05:15] so that was exactly
[1:05:18] the type of lamb that would have been
[1:05:21] offered
[1:05:22] for for the sins and it just it was it
[1:05:26] was blessed me it blessed me so much and
[1:05:30] I I thought about this lamb and I
[1:05:31] thought about how this lamb he's really
[1:05:34] defenseless he didn't have a way he
[1:05:36] couldn't the kids were messing with them
[1:05:38] and and he was just he was he was trying
[1:05:40] to kind of get away but he didn't have
[1:05:42] any defenses he couldn't kick he
[1:05:43] couldn't bite he couldn't couldn't do
[1:05:45] anything all he could do was kind of
[1:05:47] move away defenseless
[1:05:50] and I was
[1:05:51] thinking on that and I was thinking on
[1:05:53] that during the week and I just kind of
[1:05:54] thanking the lord over yesterday and and
[1:05:58] thinking about how
[1:06:01] that
[1:06:03] to give your life for something else
[1:06:07] and I thought about
[1:06:09] this is really this is this is the role
[1:06:13] of a mother
[1:06:15] a few years ago Stephanie and I were out
[1:06:17] walking
[1:06:18] and in Jeffersonville and we were we had
[1:06:21] this just a beautiful place by our house
[1:06:22] that was it was a park and it was a
[1:06:25] pretty Lake and trees everywhere and and
[1:06:27] we'd go out there and we'd walk
[1:06:29] and I saw this young lady
[1:06:32] she was maybe I don't know 30 years old
[1:06:34] or so
[1:06:36] pretty girl and she had
[1:06:39] a a baby
[1:06:41] it's about five or six years old maybe
[1:06:43] seven
[1:06:44] and this baby obviously was down
[1:06:46] syndrome
[1:06:48] and I looked at her and and I looked how
[1:06:53] much she loved that little baby
[1:06:56] that little boy
[1:06:58] and she put him on the swing and he'd
[1:07:00] swing and he'd laugh and he'd he'd come
[1:07:02] back he'd be like Mommy Mommy and he'd
[1:07:05] come running to his mom and she would
[1:07:06] she was sitting on the on the bench
[1:07:09] there and he'd go running and he was
[1:07:10] just having so much fun and it was in
[1:07:12] the middle of the day during the week
[1:07:14] and I thought
[1:07:16] it just touched me so much to see that
[1:07:19] mother and how much she loved that
[1:07:22] little boy
[1:07:23] that was her that was her whole life
[1:07:27] was this little kid
[1:07:28] and she he would he would run and she
[1:07:32] would show him how to do stuff and she'd
[1:07:33] let him in the water and he'd he'd kick
[1:07:35] the water and come back and I thought I
[1:07:38] thought Lord
[1:07:39] how beautiful it is for this this little
[1:07:44] mother and that child
[1:07:48] the bond that they have and I thought
[1:07:53] I even told my wife I said I said honey
[1:07:55] I said I said that's me
[1:07:58] I said that little boy
[1:07:59] I said I
[1:08:01] I feel like I can't do anything I feel
[1:08:03] like I'm just I'm just so dependent
[1:08:06] on on on my father you know he's my
[1:08:09] father my mother my sister my brother
[1:08:11] and and I was just I just as I was
[1:08:14] seeing that love I just saw thought how
[1:08:17] beautiful that is
[1:08:19] that Bond
[1:08:21] I was talking to a brother the other day
[1:08:23] and his son is uh handicapped and and um
[1:08:30] he was telling me he said he says you
[1:08:32] know he says we're just waiting for the
[1:08:34] Lord to heal him
[1:08:36] and I said brother I said wait a minute
[1:08:39] I said you're trying to put your son in
[1:08:42] this box that you've created
[1:08:45] I said
[1:08:47] he's a happy young man
[1:08:50] I said he's he's got a good life and he
[1:08:53] goes through life and he's got a lot of
[1:08:55] Joy I said would you want and it may be
[1:08:58] the Lord may want to change him I said
[1:09:01] but but would you would you want to
[1:09:03] change
[1:09:04] something that God has said and set
[1:09:06] forward
[1:09:07] and try to judge it according to your
[1:09:10] judgments I said maybe the Lord wants
[1:09:13] him like that to save him for all the
[1:09:15] nonsense and garbage that we go through
[1:09:19] all the stuff that we have to live with
[1:09:22] yeah and you know he said
[1:09:24] he said well brother I said I never I
[1:09:26] never thought about that
[1:09:28] Abraham Lincoln
[1:09:30] he said this he said
[1:09:33] The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is the
[1:09:36] hand that rules the world
[1:09:39] even Abraham Lincoln way back there he
[1:09:41] saw the importance of a mother and
[1:09:45] motherhood in in our society and the
[1:09:49] influence there's no one that influences
[1:09:51] a child more than a mother
[1:09:54] he said this also
[1:09:56] he said all that I am
[1:09:59] or that I ever hoped to be I owe to my
[1:10:03] angel mother
[1:10:05] now if you know Abraham Lincoln's story
[1:10:08] this Angel mother he's talking about
[1:10:10] died when he was nine years old
[1:10:14] she made such an influence on his life
[1:10:17] in those nine years
[1:10:20] that he says he says everything that I
[1:10:22] ever was everything that I hope to be
[1:10:24] and this is a man that changed the world
[1:10:26] one of the greatest greatest men that
[1:10:28] have ever walked the Earth Abraham
[1:10:29] Lincoln one of the most Gallant men and
[1:10:31] he said that everything that I am I owe
[1:10:35] to my angel mother
[1:10:37] who did this before I was nine years old
[1:10:39] influenced me so much
[1:10:41] and then so after this lady this
[1:10:46] mother died
[1:10:49] there was another
[1:10:51] um Abraham Lincoln's dad married another
[1:10:53] woman a couple years later
[1:10:57] and and she says this her name is Sarah
[1:10:59] Lincoln she said this she said Abe was
[1:11:02] the best boy I ever saw
[1:11:05] this is his stepmother
[1:11:07] she says this she said this when Abraham
[1:11:09] Lincoln was assassinated after he died
[1:11:13] Abe was the best boy I ever saw
[1:11:15] I can say what scarcely one woman a
[1:11:19] mother can say in a thousand
[1:11:22] and it and it is this Abe never gave me
[1:11:25] a crossword
[1:11:28] or even
[1:11:30] he never gave me a crossword or a look
[1:11:33] or never even refused in fact or even an
[1:11:36] appearance to do anything that I ever
[1:11:39] requested of him
[1:11:43] he said he never told me a lie in his
[1:11:46] life
[1:11:47] he never evaded never equivocated and
[1:11:50] never dodged
[1:11:53] and then that man says
[1:11:56] I owe everything to my angel mother
[1:12:00] wow you think of the influence that our
[1:12:03] our moms have and
[1:12:06] a mother is one that she's willing
[1:12:11] to
[1:12:12] sacrifice everything for her babies
[1:12:16] and it's just inner you know for for for
[1:12:19] many of us it's a lot more difficult to
[1:12:22] do that
[1:12:24] I was I was saying that I was going to
[1:12:26] give the testimony of what happened last
[1:12:28] week at Jericho Tabernacle and and it it
[1:12:31] was a it was a failure on my part
[1:12:34] to to do what what so many mothers that
[1:12:38] I say that I'm just talking about right
[1:12:41] now that they do which is just sacrifice
[1:12:43] everything
[1:12:45] now there's there's a few people here
[1:12:47] that were at that that service
[1:12:49] last week so I got up there and and I
[1:12:54] was ministering
[1:12:55] and it started okay and then I got down
[1:12:59] to a scripture that I really wanted to
[1:13:01] minister on
[1:13:04] and and I started reading this scripture
[1:13:08] and and I read a quote and and there was
[1:13:12] something that just wasn't right
[1:13:16] it was something that wrong that was
[1:13:18] wrong and I was just trying to I was
[1:13:19] just trying to push and and the problem
[1:13:21] was there was no anointing there
[1:13:24] there was no God wasn't with me
[1:13:27] and it really it scared me
[1:13:31] so I said well Lord I can just push on
[1:13:34] whatever
[1:13:35] would I do so I just stopped
[1:13:38] in the middle of the service
[1:13:40] and I said I said there's something
[1:13:43] wrong
[1:13:45] I said I said friends I said and
[1:13:47] something on the order of I don't know
[1:13:48] if I've grieved the spirit or or what's
[1:13:50] going on but I just don't feel the
[1:13:52] Lord's pleased or he wants me to go in
[1:13:54] this direction
[1:13:56] so I bowed my head
[1:13:58] and I said let's pray
[1:14:01] and we prayed and I said Lord if I've
[1:14:03] done something
[1:14:05] but I just asked that you'd forgive
[1:14:08] and that that you would take control now
[1:14:12] and sometimes we have to stop
[1:14:15] if we've been wrong
[1:14:17] you know the old saying is is when
[1:14:19] you've when you realize Heath you've dug
[1:14:21] yourself a hole what's the first thing
[1:14:23] you do
[1:14:24] stop digging
[1:14:26] and that's how as as I stopped and I
[1:14:28] said okay Lord I'm sorry and we prayed
[1:14:31] and then after I said amen
[1:14:34] something happened there was a strength
[1:14:37] that just came down
[1:14:39] and immediately just started ministering
[1:14:43] from that point
[1:14:45] so so we were the the the service and
[1:14:49] what was so strange is is I was
[1:14:51] ministering brother Jeremy you were
[1:14:52] there I was ministering on the
[1:14:53] scriptures that I had read earlier but
[1:14:55] earlier there was no anointing God
[1:14:57] wasn't with me but now he was there
[1:15:00] and things started changing and things
[1:15:02] started moving forward
[1:15:04] so we finished and it was just it was it
[1:15:07] was a wonderful service people were
[1:15:09] standing and and then I left and I went
[1:15:12] in the back and I went to the ministers
[1:15:15] area
[1:15:16] and I got down on my knees or maybe I
[1:15:19] leaned up against the the desk
[1:15:22] and
[1:15:23] I started weeping
[1:15:26] started just
[1:15:27] just crying to the Lord
[1:15:31] and then the brother that that was with
[1:15:35] me that was the translator he started
[1:15:37] weeping
[1:15:39] and and we were just the spirit of the
[1:15:42] Lord was there and and I and I just said
[1:15:45] I said Lord
[1:15:46] sorry
[1:15:48] I'm sorry that that failed you and I'm
[1:15:52] sorry that that I I did this and in my
[1:15:56] mind
[1:15:58] I said Lord thank you for being there
[1:16:02] but I just embarrassed me I I feel bad
[1:16:06] for what I did
[1:16:08] I feel like I got up there and and I
[1:16:11] just it did it didn't look good
[1:16:14] then the question came down to me
[1:16:19] now it may have been just my mind
[1:16:20] thinking it I don't know what it was but
[1:16:23] that question came into my mind and said
[1:16:25] oh so it's about you huh
[1:16:28] oh
[1:16:30] no
[1:16:31] Lord
[1:16:33] it's all about you and I'm sorry for
[1:16:35] even even thinking that
[1:16:38] and I remember thinking if I have to
[1:16:39] jump up and down and do jumping jacks
[1:16:41] and stand on my head to get the people
[1:16:44] to recognize the Lord Jesus I'll do it
[1:16:46] if I have to make a complete fool in
[1:16:49] myself I'll do it
[1:16:51] and I was thinking this and then
[1:16:54] the door opens up
[1:16:56] now this is just within a minute or two
[1:16:58] after I left the pulpit the door opens
[1:17:01] up and here comes this young man and he
[1:17:04] is bawling crying I assume he was some
[1:17:07] sort of an official in the church
[1:17:08] because he was able to get in the back
[1:17:10] and he was just crying and he says
[1:17:13] brother he says he says I need to be
[1:17:14] prayed for I got to get rid of these
[1:17:16] feelings that I have and he was he was
[1:17:18] struggling with something that not not
[1:17:19] something that was unclean but just a a
[1:17:21] weakness that he had
[1:17:24] so we prayed and he was just weeping and
[1:17:28] and he left and another one came in
[1:17:33] and and he was he he was asking Lord I
[1:17:36] just brother can you pray for me
[1:17:40] we prayed and then one of the deacons
[1:17:42] comes in brother Daniel you need to get
[1:17:44] out into the congregation
[1:17:46] you need to get back out there
[1:17:48] walk out there and ever there was the
[1:17:52] the the uh platform the the the
[1:17:56] um the altar was packed with people
[1:18:00] just crying out to the Lord and
[1:18:02] worshiping and I thought oh Lord this is
[1:18:05] this is just beautiful and people were
[1:18:07] coming up they were praying we were
[1:18:09] praying for the people and it was just
[1:18:11] it was just a tremendous experience but
[1:18:14] it took having me having them what I
[1:18:17] said having to make a fool of myself
[1:18:21] but I'm admitting it
[1:18:23] and saying Lord I was wrong
[1:18:25] and then the Holy Spirit was free to
[1:18:29] move
[1:18:30] and I think that is the that is the
[1:18:34] trait
[1:18:36] of a mother
[1:18:38] and how mothers they don't care they are
[1:18:41] going to you see these Mama Bear moms
[1:18:44] they're going to protect that baby no
[1:18:46] matter what you know every every mama
[1:18:48] bear as I've always said thanks every
[1:18:50] thinks her baby's the blackest you know
[1:18:53] they they all think that that they're
[1:18:56] the the best baby in the world my kids
[1:18:59] are
[1:19:00] so
[1:19:01] as this mothers as these mothers go
[1:19:04] through we see some just tremendous
[1:19:07] mothers in the Bible
[1:19:09] there was a lady that we all know about
[1:19:12] is very famous
[1:19:15] her name's Hannah
[1:19:18] and Hannah
[1:19:19] she had a desire
[1:19:21] to have a child
[1:19:24] in first Samuel chapter one
[1:19:26] she had a desire to have a child and she
[1:19:28] wanted this child so badly it was just
[1:19:32] everything that that she could that that
[1:19:34] she could be a mom
[1:19:37] and she had a husband not much is said
[1:19:39] about this husband but I want to talk
[1:19:41] about this man
[1:19:42] for a minute
[1:19:44] his name was Elkin
[1:19:46] and elkina was a good husband
[1:19:50] he was a great man
[1:19:52] so she would she would go with her
[1:19:55] husband to worship and then the the
[1:19:58] there would be people that would make
[1:19:59] fun of Hannah
[1:20:01] put her down
[1:20:02] and this elkana he was he was so honored
[1:20:06] that she was his wife she he would bring
[1:20:08] her with them and and he would just he
[1:20:11] just felt so bad for that she couldn't
[1:20:13] have children and he said he said this
[1:20:15] he said he said honey
[1:20:17] he says
[1:20:18] am I not better than ten Sons
[1:20:22] won't you love me just trying to comfort
[1:20:25] his little wife the sweetest sweetest
[1:20:29] thing
[1:20:31] but Hannah she she still was steadfast
[1:20:34] let's turn I want to read to you
[1:20:38] about how we should act as families
[1:20:40] let's turn to Ephesians chapter 5. verse
[1:20:43] 21.
[1:20:45] says this
[1:20:47] Paul is addressing the family unit here
[1:20:50] he says submitting yourselves one to
[1:20:52] another in the fear of God
[1:20:54] he says wives submit yourselves unto
[1:20:58] your own husbands as unto the Lord
[1:21:00] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:21:03] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:21:06] and he is the savior
[1:21:09] of the body how much the husband love
[1:21:12] his wife
[1:21:13] he's comparing this relationship of a
[1:21:16] man and a woman between Christ and the
[1:21:20] church how much do we rely on Christ and
[1:21:23] how much should our how much should the
[1:21:25] dads and the husbands how much should
[1:21:27] they represent Christ to the family
[1:21:32] therefore
[1:21:33] as the church is subject under under
[1:21:36] Christ so let the wives be unto their
[1:21:38] own husbands in everything
[1:21:43] when he says everything
[1:21:45] there's no other translations
[1:21:47] it means everything
[1:21:50] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[1:21:53] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:21:56] for it that he might sanctify and
[1:21:58] cleanse it with the washing of the Water
[1:22:01] by the word look at how Paul here is
[1:22:05] showing the nucleus the the nuclear
[1:22:08] family the mom and the dad and the
[1:22:10] children and he's saying put this word
[1:22:13] first in your family and you husbands
[1:22:16] you husbands you act like Christ to your
[1:22:21] family
[1:22:22] you love them like Christ love the
[1:22:24] church how many times have we got on our
[1:22:26] knees and said Lord help me
[1:22:28] so how much should that husband in the
[1:22:30] family that father
[1:22:32] how should he act
[1:22:34] how he should he should represent the
[1:22:37] Lord to the family and just do anything
[1:22:39] that he can
[1:22:41] we should have it says washing of the
[1:22:43] Water by the word we should have in our
[1:22:45] families we should put the word sinner
[1:22:47] in the middle
[1:22:49] studying the Bible as a family
[1:22:53] teaching our children these Bible
[1:22:55] stories and telling them about it the
[1:22:58] love of Jesus and telling them about
[1:23:00] these Heroes of old so that this word
[1:23:03] won't depart from them
[1:23:05] later on it'll come back I promise you
[1:23:10] that he might present it to himself a
[1:23:13] glorious Church
[1:23:14] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:23:17] thing but that it should be holy and
[1:23:19] without blemish so what men to love
[1:23:22] their wives as their own bodies
[1:23:24] he that loveth his wife
[1:23:26] loveth himself
[1:23:28] the husband and the wife are perfectly
[1:23:30] one
[1:23:32] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:23:34] but nourishes it and cherished it
[1:23:36] even as the Lord the church
[1:23:40] for we are members of his body of his
[1:23:42] and of his flesh and of his bone
[1:23:45] for this cause shall a man leave his
[1:23:47] father and mother and shall be joined
[1:23:48] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:23:50] flesh
[1:23:51] this is a great mystery but I speak
[1:23:53] concerning Christ in the church
[1:23:56] nevertheless let every one of you in
[1:23:58] particular so love his wife even as
[1:24:01] himself and the wife see that she
[1:24:03] reverence her husband
[1:24:05] Paul here he's commanding us
[1:24:10] to love each other as Christ has that
[1:24:13] relationship with the church
[1:24:15] he's saying that that this family
[1:24:18] is a reflection of the relationship
[1:24:20] between Christ and us
[1:24:23] so if this family if there's something
[1:24:26] wrong here we need to get it right we
[1:24:29] need to we need to love and and have
[1:24:32] this unity and it doesn't say it does
[1:24:36] not say here that well if she's Worthy
[1:24:40] or if he's worthy he said do it
[1:24:44] I'll go to uh First Peter chapter three
[1:24:47] this will answer those questions First
[1:24:51] Peter chapter 3 verse 1 says likewise
[1:24:53] you wives being subject to your own
[1:24:54] husbands that if if any obey not the
[1:24:57] word they also May without the word be
[1:24:59] won by the conversation of the wives
[1:25:03] so so he's saying here that that you can
[1:25:06] be such an example you can love your
[1:25:09] husband or your wife so much that
[1:25:10] they're going to be one to Christ just
[1:25:13] because of the way that you treat them
[1:25:16] well they behold your Chase conversation
[1:25:18] coupled with fear
[1:25:20] English Standard Version says this when
[1:25:22] they see your respectful and pure
[1:25:25] conduct
[1:25:26] verse 7
[1:25:28] . likewise your husbands dwell with them
[1:25:30] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[1:25:32] the wife as under the weaker vessel and
[1:25:35] as being heirs together
[1:25:38] of the grace of life that's your prayers
[1:25:39] be not hindered
[1:25:41] look how important again that
[1:25:43] relationship is with the husband and the
[1:25:44] wife that it's not if if there's a if
[1:25:47] you're doing your wife wrong if you're
[1:25:49] not acting like your husband if you're
[1:25:50] not representing the lord well your
[1:25:53] prayers your very conversations with God
[1:25:56] are hindered
[1:25:58] so if if there's a if there's a dispute
[1:26:00] in the family or if there's there's some
[1:26:02] sort of of conflict our prayers are
[1:26:07] hindered
[1:26:10] you can't get around
[1:26:13] the family unit
[1:26:15] it's very very important the
[1:26:17] cohesiveness
[1:26:19] of the that nuclear family
[1:26:22] the mom and the dad
[1:26:25] back to Hannah
[1:26:27] and elkanah
[1:26:30] Hannah goes to the Altar and
[1:26:33] she was praying
[1:26:36] and she wasn't even saying anything out
[1:26:38] loud
[1:26:39] she was just moving her lips
[1:26:42] so the priest there Eli he looks down
[1:26:44] and he thinks that she's drunk or he
[1:26:46] thinks that there's something wrong and
[1:26:48] and he rebukes her and he says what's
[1:26:50] what's the matter with you you're
[1:26:51] drinking wine or whatever and she says
[1:26:53] no
[1:26:54] she says I'm just praying
[1:26:56] I just I just I just have something on
[1:26:59] my heart and as she was praying it's
[1:27:01] very important she said she said Lord if
[1:27:03] you will give me this child I will give
[1:27:06] it back to you
[1:27:07] I'll dedicate it back to you
[1:27:11] so then later on
[1:27:13] God hears Hannah's Hannah's Prayer and
[1:27:15] he gives her this child and she made the
[1:27:19] commitment to give this child his name
[1:27:21] is Samuel one of the greatest prophets
[1:27:24] in the whole book
[1:27:27] she made the commitment that once he has
[1:27:30] weaned that I'm going to give him to the
[1:27:33] temple I'm going to give him to the
[1:27:34] Lord's service
[1:27:35] so just this short amount of time
[1:27:40] that mom had with this baby
[1:27:43] that was that time that she had to build
[1:27:47] his character into this great man of God
[1:27:50] and she did it
[1:27:52] she she accomplished that goal and like
[1:27:54] I said he became
[1:27:57] the greatest
[1:27:58] one of the greatest of all the prophets
[1:28:01] because of the influence of Hannah
[1:28:04] just when he was just a little baby
[1:28:06] remember remember Abraham Lincoln
[1:28:08] until nine years old and his mom
[1:28:11] teaching him we have a another lady of
[1:28:14] course named jacobed
[1:28:17] Moses's mom
[1:28:19] they were the situation was they were
[1:28:22] killing all of the children that Pharaoh
[1:28:24] was he wanted to wipe out all of these
[1:28:28] Hebrews because there were too many of
[1:28:30] them they were they could raise up an
[1:28:32] Army against him so he started killing
[1:28:33] all the all the boys and they would take
[1:28:36] these midwives these evil women would
[1:28:38] would take these these babies and they'd
[1:28:40] kill them and throw them out in the
[1:28:41] river and and it was just it was a
[1:28:44] terrible time and here is this jock a
[1:28:46] bed with her little baby
[1:28:48] and she doesn't know what to do
[1:28:52] they come by knocking on the doors
[1:28:55] searching the house I heard you have a
[1:28:57] child
[1:28:59] and you know the women who try to hide
[1:29:00] them they take the babies they kill them
[1:29:02] so what she did she goes and and of
[1:29:05] course they were I'm sure they were
[1:29:06] praying all the time jacobit takes and
[1:29:08] she builds this little basket and makes
[1:29:10] it to where it's waterproof and she
[1:29:12] takes her baby and she puts that baby
[1:29:15] into this basket closes it up and puts
[1:29:18] it out into the Nile River trusting God
[1:29:23] trusting the Lord
[1:29:25] that he'll take care of this baby
[1:29:27] I see so many mothers today and so many
[1:29:31] fathers
[1:29:32] and how we we pray for our children we
[1:29:36] should that
[1:29:38] home that family should always be a
[1:29:42] place that they feel welcome
[1:29:44] so jockey bed takes this baby and she
[1:29:48] puts them out
[1:29:50] into the into the river trusting God
[1:29:53] and that's how what we do we dedicate
[1:29:55] these children to the lord it's the best
[1:29:57] that we can do
[1:29:59] we say Lord I'm going to do the best
[1:30:01] that I can until
[1:30:04] I can't do any more and I'll give this
[1:30:07] baby to you and I just pray Lord that
[1:30:09] you take care of it
[1:30:10] and it did and and
[1:30:13] Pharaoh's daughter picks it up out of
[1:30:17] the river and starts raising it and then
[1:30:19] as you know you know the story Miriam
[1:30:21] was going on and and she says hey I know
[1:30:23] somebody that can nurse the baby so they
[1:30:25] give the baby back to the mother and she
[1:30:28] had just a short amount of time again
[1:30:32] she didn't waste any time
[1:30:34] Hannah back to Hannah as she was nursing
[1:30:38] this baby as she was taking care of this
[1:30:40] baby her own baby before she gave it to
[1:30:42] the priests she wouldn't even go worship
[1:30:45] she wouldn't she wouldn't go with to
[1:30:48] make the sacrifices with her husband she
[1:30:50] wanted to spend every moment with this
[1:30:52] baby
[1:30:53] because the time was limited and here's
[1:30:55] Djokovic she's doing the same thing
[1:30:57] she's spending every moment
[1:31:00] this baby Moses it's strange to me the
[1:31:03] two of the greatest prophets that have
[1:31:05] ever lived Samuel and Moses it talks
[1:31:08] about their mothers
[1:31:10] and how important mom was
[1:31:13] so
[1:31:14] Moses grows up as you know
[1:31:18] and delivers
[1:31:20] Egypt who delivers the Hebrews from
[1:31:22] Egypt
[1:31:24] then we see in Jesus's time
[1:31:29] we see that there's there's a lady that
[1:31:31] that came to the Lord
[1:31:34] she was a Canaanite
[1:31:36] she wasn't even a Hebrew
[1:31:38] she comes she comes to to Jesus and she
[1:31:42] bows down and she says Lord she says
[1:31:44] Thou son of David she says my daughter
[1:31:47] has a demon
[1:31:50] my daughter is suffering
[1:31:52] and it may be something like
[1:31:54] schizophrenia or maybe something like
[1:31:55] drug addiction and maybe maybe it could
[1:31:58] be a million different things but there
[1:32:00] was a demon that was that was hurting
[1:32:02] this her little girl
[1:32:04] and she comes to this man who she she
[1:32:07] knew about him she comes to Jesus and
[1:32:10] she says she says son of David
[1:32:13] she says my my daughter
[1:32:17] Jesus ignored her
[1:32:20] foreign
[1:32:21] about someone that's willing to make a
[1:32:24] fool of themselves for their daughter
[1:32:26] Jesus ignored her
[1:32:29] and she stayed on and the disciples like
[1:32:31] get out of here
[1:32:34] we don't we don't need you here and
[1:32:37] Jesus Jesus says yeah you go he's he
[1:32:39] says I'm not sent to you people
[1:32:45] did not matter to her
[1:32:47] she was willing to make a fool of
[1:32:49] herself
[1:32:50] she says Lord
[1:32:54] but I need you
[1:32:57] and he looks down at her again
[1:33:00] and he says you know what he says it's
[1:33:02] not right for dogs like you
[1:33:08] to come in here
[1:33:09] and to be with us
[1:33:12] what would you have done
[1:33:14] how dare you
[1:33:16] but she had her daughter first
[1:33:20] she makes this statement she says Lord
[1:33:24] but
[1:33:26] still the dogs
[1:33:28] can get the crumbs from the master table
[1:33:31] master's table
[1:33:32] humbled herself again
[1:33:35] and then Jesus looks down at her
[1:33:37] he's as great as your faith
[1:33:40] great is your faith
[1:33:44] he says this moment
[1:33:46] your daughter is made well
[1:33:48] what if she wouldn't have done it
[1:33:51] what if she wouldn't have brought her
[1:33:53] problems to the Lord
[1:33:56] you know it's it was everything to her
[1:33:59] this little baby
[1:34:03] I remember remember my mom you know I
[1:34:07] all of us we love we love our moms I
[1:34:11] remember Mom would
[1:34:13] we didn't have there's we had times of
[1:34:15] Plenty and then we had times of very
[1:34:17] very little
[1:34:19] and I remember that uh
[1:34:21] I like to play when I was I like to play
[1:34:23] marbles with the kids at school
[1:34:26] and uh
[1:34:28] I um you know I'd save up my money and I
[1:34:31] get my marbles but I didn't have
[1:34:33] anything to put it in put them in and
[1:34:35] Mom
[1:34:37] she uh she took an old pair of jeans
[1:34:39] that I had and she sewed she she sewed
[1:34:42] up the the bottom and she made a she
[1:34:45] made a little uh drawstring around the
[1:34:47] top and put a shoelace in there to where
[1:34:49] I could I could put my marbles in there
[1:34:51] and I could close up the bag and and I
[1:34:54] was like
[1:34:55] I had the coolest marble bag in the
[1:34:57] whole school
[1:34:59] because my mom she loved me
[1:35:01] and I said I liked maybe I shouldn't
[1:35:04] mention marbles it's kind of like
[1:35:05] gambling
[1:35:06] for kids but uh sorry I have to I want
[1:35:11] to get emotional
[1:35:13] but
[1:35:19] she loved me
[1:35:21] and I remember I remember one time I was
[1:35:23] this kid that I always wanted people to
[1:35:25] like me and then I was kind of a
[1:35:28] maybe not in the popular crowd when I
[1:35:31] was little and and
[1:35:33] it was kind of I guess it just wasn't
[1:35:36] attractive to the girls and I wanted I
[1:35:39] wanted to I wanted the girls to like me
[1:35:41] you know and just like everybody does
[1:35:43] we're all human beings and
[1:35:46] I felt so so so bad and and I remember
[1:35:49] I had a notebook
[1:35:52] that I used to go to school in my
[1:35:54] backpack and and I took my backpack out
[1:35:57] I took my notebook out and I was in
[1:35:59] class and and I looked on the front of
[1:36:02] the notebook and all the other kids when
[1:36:03] they had girlfriends and stuff they'd
[1:36:05] write little notes to each other in the
[1:36:07] notebook well I looked on my notebook
[1:36:10] and there was this heart
[1:36:13] and it said I love you
[1:36:15] I was like
[1:36:18] it was in girls handwriting
[1:36:21] and I set that Notebook on the corner of
[1:36:23] my my desk
[1:36:24] you know and and and I was proud and
[1:36:27] even to my friends like that's not your
[1:36:28] handwriting I was like nope
[1:36:34] I didn't tell them it was my mom
[1:36:38] but
[1:36:40] but I think that that you know with all
[1:36:43] with all the everything that was going
[1:36:45] on in all school and everything that
[1:36:47] that you know I wasn't I wasn't anything
[1:36:49] special but I had a mom that thought I
[1:36:53] was special
[1:36:54] I had a mom that loved me more than
[1:36:56] anything in the world and and she always
[1:36:59] made it to where I felt like I was
[1:37:02] important
[1:37:04] and I just I think back about
[1:37:06] about the times growing up and and how
[1:37:09] many times when I got older
[1:37:11] unfortunately I got more popular as I
[1:37:14] got older
[1:37:15] bad I'm not I'm not uh
[1:37:19] and uh remember staying out late and
[1:37:22] coming home
[1:37:24] and seeing my mom with the swollen eyes
[1:37:26] and and
[1:37:28] seeing her they were waiting for me and
[1:37:31] she'd been crying and praying for me her
[1:37:34] Wayward Son
[1:37:35] and I wish I could take all of that back
[1:37:37] I wish I would never have done anything
[1:37:39] like that
[1:37:40] to her
[1:37:42] she loved me
[1:37:43] but I did
[1:37:46] but she was there for me no matter what
[1:37:48] no matter how
[1:37:50] bad of a kid I was or how much I
[1:37:52] disrespect her mom was always there
[1:37:56] Isaiah 66 says one as one who a mother
[1:38:00] comforts
[1:38:02] so will I comfort you
[1:38:04] the Lord speaking how much how much do
[1:38:07] our mothers comfort her but then Comfort
[1:38:09] us but
[1:38:10] we see that
[1:38:12] that God is so much even greater than a
[1:38:17] mother
[1:38:17] and now I look back and all the mistakes
[1:38:19] that I've made and and how the what I
[1:38:22] put my mom through the anxiety and
[1:38:24] everything I did the same to the Lord
[1:38:26] Jesus
[1:38:28] and how much greater is the Lord than
[1:38:30] Mom
[1:38:31] how much more does he love us the the
[1:38:34] Bible says it says I as he says a woman
[1:38:37] can forget her suckling child
[1:38:41] but I could never forget you
[1:38:44] that's how much that's how important our
[1:38:47] lord Jesus is and how much he loves us
[1:38:50] and he's there and I never ever want to
[1:38:52] hurt him again
[1:38:54] how many times have I have I failed him
[1:38:57] but but even as I fail them on third on
[1:39:01] Saturday last week even as I failed him
[1:39:04] he was still there and I was like Lord
[1:39:06] I'll make a fool of myself I don't care
[1:39:08] Oh do whatever you want
[1:39:12] to lift you up
[1:39:14] Paul said we are fools for Christ
[1:39:17] and we should be we should be willing no
[1:39:21] matter what it takes I will stand for
[1:39:24] that man
[1:39:25] I'll stand for that man that died on the
[1:39:27] cross
[1:39:29] oh Lord whatever you require
[1:39:33] I wanna
[1:39:35] I Wanna Be There
[1:39:36] I want to stand I want to stand for you
[1:39:41] or see
[1:39:42] of course I think it's she's probably
[1:39:44] the most special lady
[1:39:47] in the whole Bible
[1:39:49] is this young lady named Mary
[1:39:53] and what Mary went through
[1:39:56] she was
[1:39:59] she
[1:40:01] was obviously a good girl we don't know
[1:40:03] much about her we just we know her
[1:40:05] lineage but we don't know much about
[1:40:06] this this young lady and this Angel
[1:40:09] comes to her and
[1:40:11] says that you're going to have this
[1:40:13] child and all that she suffered
[1:40:16] the rumors that went around her that
[1:40:18] that not that she had an affair and
[1:40:20] got pregnant but that she had an affair
[1:40:23] with a heathen
[1:40:24] and got pregnant
[1:40:27] the rumors went around that that she
[1:40:29] slept with this Roman soldier and and
[1:40:31] and that dogged her her whole life even
[1:40:34] as Jesus was growing up
[1:40:37] it was with her
[1:40:39] but she stood
[1:40:42] for God
[1:40:43] and as he was growing up I'm sure Mom
[1:40:46] was so proud of her little Jesus
[1:40:51] how that he was just this the best kid
[1:40:53] that you could ever have I think about
[1:40:57] how this Abraham Lincoln's stepmom
[1:41:01] how proud she was of Abraham Lincoln and
[1:41:04] how proud that Abraham Lincoln's mother
[1:41:05] must have been and and the the influence
[1:41:08] that she had on him
[1:41:10] Jesus made Abraham Lincoln look like the
[1:41:13] most vile sinner that's ever lived
[1:41:16] growing up and
[1:41:18] her being just so proud of this this kid
[1:41:22] and loving him and and and raising him
[1:41:25] up and the bond that Jesus must have had
[1:41:30] with his mom
[1:41:31] is just
[1:41:35] he never failed her
[1:41:37] you know
[1:41:38] he never did something wrong
[1:41:41] I was thinking about that this morning
[1:41:43] and last night as I was laying in bed I
[1:41:45] was like oh
[1:41:47] that's the one I want to be like
[1:41:50] this man that never failed
[1:41:52] this man that that she is a mom that
[1:41:55] that she could always count on him
[1:41:59] so if uh it's just a little if you'd
[1:42:01] come get ready to close and the
[1:42:03] musicians
[1:42:05] thinking about
[1:42:07] this man Jesus and and as he grew up and
[1:42:10] and she saw him up there preaching and
[1:42:13] all the sick people would come in and
[1:42:15] she saw him heal every single one she
[1:42:18] saw him stand before the Pharisees and
[1:42:20] the Sadducees and preached the gospel
[1:42:23] standing up up against everyone a real
[1:42:27] man
[1:42:28] the most perfect man that had ever lived
[1:42:31] and then she as things go on she sees
[1:42:34] them right into Jerusalem on this donkey
[1:42:37] and the people singing Hosanna and
[1:42:38] throwing their clothes their coats in
[1:42:41] front of the donkeys about how blessed
[1:42:43] this man is
[1:42:45] coming in and then all of a sudden he's
[1:42:48] betrayed him he's taken
[1:42:52] imagine Mary
[1:42:54] imagine you know
[1:42:56] thinking about how much our moms worry
[1:43:00] about us and think about us
[1:43:04] imagine
[1:43:06] she felt the same thing about her son
[1:43:09] and here he is
[1:43:12] carrying this cross
[1:43:14] and she was there she saw him walk by
[1:43:17] and she was with these these sisters and
[1:43:18] they're weeping and then he goes up and
[1:43:21] he he's nailed to this cross and he's
[1:43:24] lifted up in front of the people and
[1:43:26] there is her little baby
[1:43:29] there is her little baby that she loves
[1:43:32] so much
[1:43:33] and there he is suffering embarrassed
[1:43:37] he's up there
[1:43:40] and is the most beautiful thing
[1:43:42] in the world you want to see the
[1:43:43] relationship between a mom
[1:43:46] and a baby
[1:43:47] and a young and her child
[1:43:49] Jesus is up nailed to the cross and he
[1:43:52] looks down and he sees married his mom
[1:43:54] down there
[1:43:56] [Music]
[1:43:58] and he's up there and he sees his buddy
[1:44:00] John
[1:44:02] he looks over and he says
[1:44:06] basically says John take care of my mom
[1:44:10] he says take care of my mom
[1:44:12] he says he says mother behold your son
[1:44:16] son behold your mother
[1:44:20] take care of her
[1:44:21] and from that moment on the Bible says
[1:44:23] that he treated like her like his own
[1:44:25] mom and he took care of her the one
[1:44:28] disciple the one person that was never
[1:44:31] killed
[1:44:32] for his beliefs of all the disciples it
[1:44:36] was John that lived to be an old man and
[1:44:39] he was always there no matter how long
[1:44:42] Mary lived that man was there to take
[1:44:46] care of her how important was Jesus's
[1:44:49] mother I'm not saying that that's the
[1:44:51] only reason
[1:44:53] that John lived so long but it's a
[1:44:56] reason
[1:44:58] so he's up there and
[1:45:01] he had just said as he's on the cross
[1:45:03] the day before
[1:45:05] he had just said that if I don't go
[1:45:11] then this Holy Spirit this comforter
[1:45:14] he's not going to come down to you
[1:45:16] and there he is with his mother and he's
[1:45:19] there and on the cross and he's and he
[1:45:20] sees her crying and and it's like he
[1:45:24] didn't say this but Mom
[1:45:27] if I don't go
[1:45:29] you're gonna go to hell
[1:45:31] so is everybody else now look how the
[1:45:34] rolls switched
[1:45:35] now who's taking care of who
[1:45:38] there's Jesus up there and he's looking
[1:45:40] down and he sees his mom and he's
[1:45:44] if it was just Mary he'd have done it
[1:45:45] Keith it was just you bro you'd have
[1:45:48] done it
[1:45:49] if it was any of us he would have done
[1:45:51] it
[1:45:52] but he's there and he's on the cross
[1:45:55] and he gives up by his own choosing
[1:45:59] gives up his life
[1:46:01] so that not only his mom
[1:46:04] but that all of us
[1:46:06] could be saved
[1:46:10] there's all these mothers
[1:46:13] in this room and and I don't believe
[1:46:15] that any of of you all love your
[1:46:18] children any less than Mary loved her
[1:46:19] babies her son Jesus
[1:46:24] and the love of a mother I just think is
[1:46:26] so
[1:46:27] so beautiful and it just it touched me
[1:46:30] so much to see that young lady and her
[1:46:34] child
[1:46:36] and how much she loved him
[1:46:38] just taking care of him and and watching
[1:46:41] over him and just seeing the joy and him
[1:46:44] running around I wouldn't change that
[1:46:46] child for nothing
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:49] he was a good boy
[1:46:53] and he was just so happy love the Lord
[1:46:56] I don't know if he loved the Lord but I
[1:46:59] know the Lord loved him
[1:47:01] give him a mom like that
[1:47:04] think about
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:08] think about that lamb on Saturday
[1:47:12] and it wasn't their fault like the
[1:47:15] little boy said
[1:47:17] it wasn't his fault
[1:47:19] But Here Comes the sins upon that
[1:47:23] little animal
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:28] for our sins
[1:47:30] greater than the love of a mother
[1:47:34] and here comes the Lamb of God
[1:47:36] as the Book of John says and he says oh
[1:47:39] this is all of it
[1:47:42] all the way from Genesis when Abel was
[1:47:45] making sacrifices at the altar the very
[1:47:48] first people that lived making
[1:47:50] sacrifices here all the way back and
[1:47:54] then through Leviticus and Moses and all
[1:47:56] of them they'd come down through this is
[1:47:58] the Fulfillment he says Behold the Lamb
[1:48:01] of God
[1:48:02] that takes away the sins of the world
[1:48:03] and from that moment on
[1:48:06] it was over
[1:48:08] and if we could just accept that Lamb of
[1:48:12] God
[1:48:13] if we could just accept a love that's
[1:48:16] far greater a love for me personally
[1:48:19] that's far greater than my mom ever
[1:48:21] loved me
[1:48:23] is that love that Christ has for me
[1:48:25] friends it's
[1:48:26] it's
[1:48:27] beyond measure
[1:48:31] I love him
[1:48:33] do you love him a
[1:48:42] there's nothing we could ever do that
[1:48:45] would warrant what he did for us
[1:48:48] but we can do our best
[1:48:52] we can thank him
[1:48:55] I would never
[1:48:57] [Music]
[1:48:58] I'd never forsake my mom
[1:49:01] you know I would never say I don't know
[1:49:03] that lady I don't I don't want to be any
[1:49:05] part of that woman
[1:49:07] um
[1:49:07] I would never do that to my mom
[1:49:10] neither would you
[1:49:11] [Music]
[1:49:13] but yet it's so easy to do it to our
[1:49:15] Lord
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:18] let's make sure brothers and sisters
[1:49:20] make sure
[1:49:24] that we're putting the Lord Jesus in the
[1:49:27] place that he should be in our lives
[1:49:31] this Mother's Day
[1:49:34] you don't have to
[1:49:36] can if you want
[1:49:39] you don't have to come to the altar
[1:49:42] the Lord knows
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:48] dedicated
[1:49:52] the one that was up there

[1:59:53] this step to serve the Lord

[1:59:58] heaven
[1:59:59] now when when we're baptized and if if
[2:00:01] y'all will listen to this when we're
[2:00:03] baptized
[2:00:05] this water it's cold
[2:00:09] today and this water represents the
[2:00:12] grave
[2:00:13] so when you go down into this water
[2:00:17] it represents going down into the grave
[2:00:21] and being dead to your sins
[2:00:24] and then coming up
[2:00:27] out of the water it represents a new
[2:00:30] person that's that's coming up it's a
[2:00:32] choice that you have to make

[2:00:47] you I want to serve you and I want a
[2:00:49] life that is that is dedicated to
[2:00:53] serving the lord Jesus that's what these
[2:00:56] Waters represent
[2:00:58] with me
[2:01:00] there's no reason
[2:01:02] to come into these Waters if that is not
[2:01:04] your moment
[2:01:07] oh Leonard
[2:01:08] stand here my friend
[2:01:12] now as the Apostle Paul taught
[2:01:16] he said whatever you do in word or deed
[2:01:19] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:01:23] the Apostle Peter he commanded they they
[2:01:25] wanted to have that same spirit and he
[2:01:28] commanded he said repent every one of
[2:01:30] you
[2:01:31] means go back
[2:01:33] and say Lord I don't want to sit again
[2:01:36] repent every one of you and be baptized
[2:01:40] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:01:43] remission of your sins for the taking
[2:01:44] away of your sins
[2:01:47] and then he made a promise
[2:01:49] you know any problems he said for you
[2:01:52] shall
[2:01:53] receive the gift amen and he said in
[2:01:58] This Promise is unto you and to your
[2:02:00] children and
[2:02:01] in them that are far off even as many as
