[9:17] At the cross.
[9:46] Alas, and did [music]
[9:48] my Savior bleed and did my [singing]
[9:54] sovereign die?
[9:58] could [music and singing]
[9:58] heal
[10:00] that sacred
[10:03] head for such a worm as I
[10:09] at the cross. At the cross where [music]
[10:13] I first saw the light and the burden
[10:17] [singing] of [music] my heart rolled
[10:19] away.
[10:22] It [music and singing] was there by
[10:24] faith. I received my side. And while I
[10:30] [music] am happy all the day,
[10:34] was [singing] it for crimes that I have
[10:39] done? He groaned upon the tree.
[10:47] Amazing [singing]
[10:49] pity grace unknown at [music]
[10:54] the beyond
[10:57] grace.
[10:59] At the cross at [music] the cross where
[11:03] I first [singing] saw the light and the
[11:06] burden of my [music] heart was rolled
[11:09] away.
[11:12] It [music and singing] was there, but
[11:15] I receive my sight. [singing] And now I
[11:20] am wrapped all the way.
[11:25] Well, might the sun in darkness
[11:30] hide and shut his glory [music] sing.
[11:37] When Christ the mighty
[11:41] maker
[11:44] for man the preacher say
[11:50] at the cross at the cross where I first
[11:55] saw
[11:56] and the [music] burden of my heart was
[11:59] [singing] rolled away.
[12:03] It was there my faith. I received my
[12:08] [music and singing] side. And now I am
[12:12] happy all the day.
[12:16] Oh, but drops of grief can
[12:21] repay the debt of the
[12:26] own.
[12:29] Dear Lord, [singing and music]
[12:31] I give myself
[12:34] to
[12:36] all that I can do.
[12:42] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[12:46] saw the light and the burden [singing]
[12:50] of my [music] heart was rolled away.
[12:55] It [music and singing] was there by
[12:57] faith. I received my [music]
[13:00] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[13:06] [music]
[13:07] Oh, at the cross. At the cross where I
[13:12] first saw the lamb and the burden of my
[13:16] heart was rolled away.
[13:21] It was there by faith. I receive my side
[13:27] and [music]
[13:28] now I am happy all the day.
[13:34] Amen. Even when I'm not happy, I'm
[13:37] happy.
[13:38] That's the attitude I want to have.
[13:40] Lord, I just appreciate what you done
[13:41] for me. You may be seated. So, Amen.
[13:45] That's good to know that he cares for us
[13:48] and that he loves us. I was talking with
[13:51] brother Lyle just a little bit before
[13:54] service here or just thinking about the
[13:55] goodness of God
[13:58] the questions that that Adam and Eve had
[14:01] to have after they were cast out and be
[14:04] into question and begin to wonder. But
[14:07] God had already made a way. God was
[14:10] already doing that to restore back the
[14:13] fellowship.
[14:15] And because of that, we love him. And
[14:18] the greatest expression of our love to
[14:20] him is how we treat one another and how
[14:22] we show our love for one another. I love
[14:25] Jesus, but I can't say I'm my neighbor.
[14:28] That's a contrary statement. You know, I
[14:30] love the Lord because he first loved me,
[14:32] and I can love you, too. Amen. So, I've
[14:35] anchored in Jesus the storms of life
[14:39] brave.
[14:43] Let's start with the first verse. Upon
[14:46] life's boundless [music]
[14:47] ocean where mighty billows roll, I fix
[14:52] my hope in Jesus. Blessed anchor of my
[14:56] soul. When trials fear assail me as
[15:01] storms are gathering on, I rest upon
[15:05] [music and singing] his mercy and trust
[15:09] him.
[15:11] I've anchored in Jesus. The storms of
[15:15] life I pray. [singing]
[15:17] I've anchored in Jesus. I fear no wind
[15:22] or wave. I've anchored in Jesus [music]
[15:27] for he had power to save. I've anchored
[15:31] in the rock of
[15:37] keeps my soul from evil and gives me
[15:41] blessing.
[15:43] His voice has stealed [music] the waters
[15:45] [singing]
[15:47] and bid their tum sea. my pilot [music]
[15:51] and deliverer
[15:53] to him. I hope all confine
[15:57] there always when [singing and music] I
[15:59] need him. He's at my side. Oh, I've
[16:04] anchored in Jesus. The storms of life
[16:08] fall.
[16:10] I've anchored [singing]
[16:11] in Jesus. I fear no wind or wave. I've
[16:17] anchored in Jesus.
[16:20] For he had [music] the power to say,
[16:23] I've anchored in the rock of aes.
[16:30] He is my friend [music] and savior. In
[16:33] him my [singing] anchor can. He drives
[16:37] [music] away my sorrows and shields me
[16:41] from the land. By faith [music] I'm
[16:44] looking upward [singing] beyond life's
[16:48] trouble seeing. There I [music] behold a
[16:52] haven prepared for me.
[16:56] I've anchored in Jesus. The storms of
[17:01] [music] life all brave. I've anchored in
[17:05] Jesus. I fear no wind or wave. [music]
[17:10] I've anchored in Jesus for he [music]
[17:14] had power to save.
[17:17] I've anchored in the [music and singing]
[17:19] rock of aes.
[17:23] I've anchored in Jesus. The storms of
[17:28] life are brave. I've hankered in Jesus.
[17:33] I'll fear no wind or wave. I've anchored
[17:38] in Jesus for he had power to say
[17:43] I've anchored in the rock of aes.
[17:51] That's the only anchor that holds.
[17:54] Amen.
[17:56] Amen. It's the only one that holds.
[17:59] I've anchored my soul in the haven of
[18:03] rest.
[18:05] those last words, the haven of rest
[18:08] where we can rest. I've anchored it
[18:11] there. I'm not afraid of it.
[18:14] And the waves come. Uh sometimes I'll
[18:17] I'll turn YouTube on and I'll watch
[18:20] um I guess cuz I'm a guy still
[18:23] uh boats being flipped in the water and
[18:25] and all those kind of neat things.
[18:28] But you know,
[18:30] I I also look at the other ones that
[18:32] make it through the storm.
[18:35] And you know, he said, "I'll be with you
[18:37] even and you'll never leave me."
[18:40] My soul
[18:43] in [singing] sad exile
[18:46] was out on
[18:49] sea.
[18:51] all burdened
[18:54] with sin [singing] and distress. [music]
[19:02] Till I [singing and music] heard a sweet
[19:05] voice say,
[19:08] make me your choice.
[19:13] And [music] I entered [singing]
[19:16] the haven
[19:18] of breath.
[19:24] I've anored
[19:26] my soul
[19:29] in the haven
[19:32] of the west.
[19:34] I'll sail the [singing] wide seas
[19:39] [music] no more.
[19:45] Oh, the [music and singing] tempest
[19:48] may see
[19:50] for the wild,
[19:56] but in Jesus
[19:59] I'm safe.
[20:07] Oh, I yielded [singing and music]
[20:10] myself
[20:12] to his tender
[20:15] embrace
[20:17] and faith [music]
[20:20] taking [singing]
[20:21] hold of
[20:23] the word.
[20:28] My feathers
[20:30] fell off
[20:33] and [music] I anchored
[20:35] my soul.
[20:38] Oh, [music] the haven
[20:41] of rest
[20:43] is [music] the Lord.
[20:48] I've anchored [music and singing]
[20:51] my soul
[20:53] in the haven.
[20:59] I'll s
[21:09] Oh, the tempers [music]
[21:12] may
[21:14] for the wild
[21:17] for me.
[21:19] Oh Jesus,
[21:22] I'm safe [music and singing] for ever
[21:25] home.
[21:30] Oh, [music and singing] the song of my
[21:33] soul
[21:35] since the Lord
[21:38] made me whole
[21:40] has been
[21:43] the [music] old story. [singing]
[21:45] So blessed
[21:51] of [singing and music] Jesus
[21:53] who save
[21:59] will have
[22:01] a [music] home
[22:04] in the haven
[22:06] of grave.
[22:11] I've anchored [music]
[22:14] my soul
[22:16] in the haven
[22:19] of grace.
[22:22] I'll sail [music]
[22:24] the white seas
[22:27] no more.
[22:32] Oh, the tempest
[22:34] [singing] may sweet
[22:37] or the wild.
[22:42] And Jesus, [music]
[22:45] I'm safe
[22:47] and we're one more time in the chorus.
[22:51] Sister
[22:53] anored [singing] my soul
[22:58] in the haven
[23:00] of west.
[23:03] I'll sail the wide seas. [music]
[23:14] The tempest
[23:16] may see
[23:18] all the wild [music]
[23:25] Jesus.
[23:47] Y'all can sing this with me.
[23:53] Dear Lord, I'll be a witness.
[24:06] I know that I'm not worthy
[24:13] of you.
[24:19] My eyes of faith I see thee
[24:25] upon the cross of
[24:31] dear Lord I cry let me thy serve
[24:43] Jesus
[24:46] [music] Surely
[24:56] there's a work that I can do
[25:06] and
[25:09] it's
[25:11] Lord help me to crumble.
[25:17] For the cost,
[25:21] I'll
[25:29] stand for you, [singing]
[25:32] dear Jesus. [music]
[25:40] I'll spread this [singing and music]
[25:44] to the
[25:46] world.
[25:52] But if it be threw
[26:07] into
[26:14] Jesus [music]
[26:17] Surely
[26:25] [music]
[26:27] there's a
[26:44] to come.
[26:50] Great.
[26:59] He's
[27:02] the family.
[27:10] He's the best of
[27:21] He's the
[27:24] sharing.
[27:27] He's all
[27:30] to me.
[27:32] But best of all, he is my
[27:49] Oh Lord, please don't
[28:06] Even though it's [music]
[28:11] help
[28:33] for thee.
[28:45] The last words to the chorus, though the
[28:47] cost be great,
[28:49] he paid the greatest cost
[28:52] for us to be able to to serve him to
[28:55] love him. If we'll stand
[29:00] as brother L makes ready to
[29:03] this evening and
[29:06] continue with the
[29:08] the the message there teaching of the
[29:11] temple
[29:13] and just got a chance. I know that those
[29:15] of you who have ministered the study
[29:17] processes,
[29:19] do I include this? Do I not include
[29:21] this? I should have added this. Maybe I
[29:23] shouldn't have put that in. It's a
[29:25] constant. Which one?
[29:27] If we'll pray and ask the Lord, minister
[29:29] to us, God will give us give it to us.
[29:33] That's really the key to that. I claim
[29:35] the blood Jesus shed. You know, the the
[29:39] reason for the temple was really so that
[29:43] they could come to a place where they
[29:44] could have fellowship with God again.
[29:47] And God had to make a way to the shed
[29:50] blood.
[29:53] Let's start with the first verse.
[29:57] I have a soul
[30:01] of strength when I
[30:11] have a source
[30:15] of strength [music and singing]
[30:16] when I am weak.
[30:20] [music]
[30:23] and chase me.
[30:27] When life is [music] pressing,
[30:35] I have the sun
[30:41] of [music] power
[30:43] from above.
[30:48] [music] I'm [singing] covered
[30:51] over
[30:54] by a [singing and music] shield of
[30:57] blood.
[31:01] I claim the blood
[31:06] [music] Jesus shed on Calary.
[31:15] Preious
[31:16] blood [singing] stain
[31:19] were made there just [singing]
[31:22] for [music] me.
[31:26] For [singing] all my sins,
[31:31] my sickness
[31:34] and my pain.
[31:39] When I need him,
[31:44] I [music] claim [singing]
[31:46] those preious
[31:48] blood.
[31:52] I
[31:54] love
[31:57] how others [singing]
[31:59] take
[32:07] [music]
[32:10] Caling
[32:24] to yourself
[32:29] with peace at home.
[32:33] [music]
[32:35] his redeemed [singing]
[32:38] candle.
[32:41] [music]
[32:42] I claim the blood
[32:46] Jesus shed.
[32:54] Those preious
[32:57] blood
[32:59] were made there just for me.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; [music]
[33:12] &gt;&gt; my sickness
[33:14] and my pain.
[33:19] When I [music] need healing, [singing]
[33:24] I claim those [music] preious
[33:28] blood stains.
[33:32] I [music]
[33:32] claim the blood
[33:36] Jesus shed [singing]
[33:38] on [music] Calary.
[33:44] Those [music]
[33:45] preious blood stains
[33:49] were made [singing] there [music] just
[33:52] for me.
[33:56] for all my sins,
[34:01] my sickness,
[34:04] and my pain.
[34:08] When I need healing,
[34:14] I claim those preious
[34:17] blood stains.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you so much.
[34:26] Good evening.
[34:29] Tonight we'll continue exploring the
[34:32] tabernacle in the wilderness.
[34:35] Last time we observed the tabernacle and
[34:38] its courtyard from the perspective of a
[34:40] person approaching the tabernacle
[34:42] complex for the first time. What did he
[34:45] or she see? What questions formed in the
[34:49] mind of the observer?
[34:51] What answers might there be? What what
[34:53] was symbolic about those things
[34:55] observed?
[34:57] Let's continue in the same way for part
[35:00] two of our encounter with the tabernacle
[35:02] in the wilderness. Before we begin
[35:04] exploring this evening, let's join our
[35:06] hearts together one more time in prayer.
[35:10] Lord Jesus, it's such an honor to be
[35:14] gathered here with those that have
[35:16] claimed those precious blood stains.
[35:19] Lord, that you have taken away our sin.
[35:21] You've given us healing. You've given us
[35:23] strength. You've Lord given us a part of
[35:25] yourself, Lord, that we can unite with
[35:27] one another, Lord. We pray, I pray this
[35:31] evening, Lord, that you would grant
[35:33] forgiveness. And Lord, that you'd grant
[35:36] unity. And Lord, that you'd guard my
[35:39] lips. And if I misstate something, that
[35:42] you guard the ears of anyone that might
[35:44] hear this tonight or stream it at some
[35:46] other time.
[35:47] Because Lord, we do all of this to
[35:50] glorify you, to look into your word, to
[35:53] find you, to find those things that
[35:55] you've told us and showed us. We love
[35:59] you, Lord Jesus, and we thank you. In
[36:02] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[36:10] We ended last time just inside the
[36:11] courtyard. We noted the main item in the
[36:14] courtyard, apart from the tabernacle
[36:16] itself, was the altar of sacrifice.
[36:19] It was centered on and located a
[36:21] reasonable distance back from the gate.
[36:24] It was where the worshipper would bring
[36:26] his or her sacrifice. The priest would
[36:30] then kill it in accordance with the
[36:31] rules for that particular class of
[36:34] sacrifice.
[36:36] The Lord gave Moses detailed
[36:38] instructions regarding the design and
[36:40] fabrication of this altar.
[36:42] Let's eavesdrop as God describes it to
[36:45] Moses in Exodus chapter 27.
[36:51] And thou shalt make an altar of
[36:52] shitwood. That's that's acacia. In case
[36:56] you don't remember from last time, this
[36:58] is acacia.
[37:03] Even if you do remember from last time,
[37:04] it's still acacia.
[37:08] It's five cubits long, five cubits
[37:11] broad. The altar shall be four square.
[37:14] That's not the name of a church. It's
[37:15] describing the shape. And the height
[37:18] thereof shall be three cubits. A cubit's
[37:21] about 18 inches
[37:24] or a foot and a half.
[37:28] So there's two cubits in a yard. So this
[37:31] that you think of as being a yard stick,
[37:33] it's a cubic cubit stick and it's two
[37:36] cubits. If I break it in half, it'll be
[37:38] one, but Heather might not be happy if I
[37:40] break it in half. So I I won't do that.
[37:45] Thou shalt make the horns of it upon the
[37:47] four corners thereof. His horns shall be
[37:50] the same, that is of acacia wood. And
[37:53] thou shalt overlay it, the the altar,
[37:55] including the horns, with brass.
[37:57] Actually, it it's copper. I'll explain
[38:00] this shortly. And thou shalt make his,
[38:03] that is the altars, pans, to receive his
[38:06] ashes, and his shovels and his basins,
[38:09] sprinkling bowls, and his flesh hooks,
[38:12] like meat forks, and his fire pans.
[38:15] What's a fire pan? They didn't have
[38:17] matches or lighters in those days. So,
[38:18] they'd have an implement that they could
[38:21] put a small amount of fire or coals on
[38:23] and take it someplace to light something
[38:25] else. All the vessels thereof, thou
[38:28] shalt make of brass.
[38:31] And thou shalt make for it a great of
[38:35] network of brass. And upon the net thou
[38:38] shalt make four brazen rings in the four
[38:40] corners thereof. And thou shalt put it
[38:43] under the the compass. That means under
[38:45] the border or or the rim beneath that
[38:48] the net may be even to the midst of
[38:50] reach halfway up into the altar.
[38:54] Thou shalt make staves carrying poles
[38:57] for the altar. staves of acacia wood and
[39:00] overlay them with brass. And the stave
[39:03] shall be put into the rings of the
[39:05] great, and the stave shall be upon two
[39:07] sides of the altar to bear it to enable
[39:11] carrying it.
[39:13] Hollow with boards shalt thou make it.
[39:16] As was showed thee in the mount, so
[39:19] shall they make it. In Exodus 38,
[39:22] there's the account of the construction
[39:23] of it, which is the same items and in
[39:25] the same order.
[39:28] Okay, you can be seated now. Thank you.
[39:34] If I were to hand you a pencil and a
[39:37] sheet of paper
[39:40] and asked you to make a crude sketch of
[39:42] the altar,
[39:44] what would it look like? How would you
[39:46] draw it?
[39:50] Make a top view and a and a side view
[39:52] and an end view. And be sure to include
[39:54] a drawing of this brass grate.
[39:58] Do you think the one that you draw will
[40:01] be a close match to the one drawn by
[40:03] somebody nearby?
[40:06] The altar is to be hollow. Does that
[40:09] mean it's like an empty box and fire
[40:11] will be on top of it or like an open top
[40:14] box with a sealed bottom or just four
[40:16] sides and no top or bottom or or
[40:19] something else entirely?
[40:22] If you Ponder for a moment. You realize
[40:25] you don't know if the altar sits flat on
[40:28] the ground and therefore needs some sort
[40:30] of a cutaway along the bottom edges for
[40:32] air to get to the fire, the altar to act
[40:34] as a chimney, a way to get the ashes
[40:37] out?
[40:39] If it does, does it need a gap on all
[40:42] four sides or just one side? How large
[40:44] should the gap be so that wood can be
[40:46] added and ashes removed?
[40:49] How is the the great of network of brass
[40:53] with four rings constructed? Is it
[40:56] suspended within the altar halfway up or
[41:00] formed to set on the ground and be
[41:02] shaped a bit like a a modern basket
[41:04] you'd use to deep fry foods but turned
[41:06] upside down?
[41:08] And if so, what are the rings for?
[41:10] [snorts] Or is it suspended from the top
[41:12] with the rings going over these
[41:13] mysterious horns of the altar?
[41:17] And what are these horns all about? Are
[41:20] they intended to suspend the brass
[41:22] crate? And in that case, how do you
[41:24] transport the altar since no other rings
[41:27] are mentioned?
[41:30] Are these details important? Or does the
[41:33] person making the altar have the the the
[41:35] freedom to interpret the words on a best
[41:37] effort basis?
[41:40] As I think you can see, while there's a
[41:42] lot of information given in the words of
[41:44] the text, there are many details that
[41:48] are lacking.
[41:52] Verse eight settles these issues. As it
[41:54] was shown thee in the mount, so shall
[41:56] they make it. In other words, Moses
[41:59] would be supervising, explaining, and
[42:02] generally ensuring that the design
[42:03] matched exactly what the Lord showed
[42:06] him.
[42:08] Unfortunately,
[42:10] no one made drawings that survived the
[42:12] millennia. So, we don't know any more
[42:14] about what it actually looked like than
[42:16] what the text says.
[42:29] That that drawing is not showing.
[42:32] Use your imagination. Here's one concept
[42:35] drawing. The ultra walls are one
[42:38] thickness of acacia wood boards covered
[42:40] on both sides with brass. The grate sits
[42:42] on the ground and is formed upward. Uh
[42:46] but it would need to sit on something to
[42:48] allow air to get in.
[42:51] Uh
[42:52] not too sure. Let's go to one we can
[42:54] see.
[42:56] [snorts] Here's another concept drawing
[42:58] here. The word hollow is taken to mean
[43:00] that the sides
[43:03] are hollow. So this sketch shows the
[43:04] altar has hollow walls several inches
[43:06] thick. Uh the grate sits on the ground
[43:10] and is formed upwards and loops around
[43:12] the base of the altar to then form the
[43:14] carrying rings for the poles. The brass
[43:17] network is shaped to allow air in for
[43:19] the fire, but would still be hard to
[43:21] load wood and remove ashes.
[43:29] Here's a concept drawing from Orthodox
[43:32] religious Jewish texts. The the altar
[43:35] includes a pedestal five cubits tall.
[43:38] The altar top surface is now nine cubits
[43:41] high with a one cubit high square horns
[43:44] that are also cubes. The hollow walls
[43:48] are one cubit thick. The wood pile for
[43:51] sacrifice is in a one cubit square space
[43:54] on top of the altar.
[43:56] The top surface forms a place for the
[43:58] priests to walk. And here's more of that
[44:02] one. Um, this shows the altar with its
[44:05] rings and rods and an illustrator fire
[44:07] burning on top.
[44:11] It's a pretty heavy structure. An earthn
[44:14] ramp some 30 cubits, 45 ft long, allows
[44:17] the priest to reach the top of the altar
[44:20] to sacrifice.
[44:23] I doubt any of your imagined drawings uh
[44:26] look like this concept. The convoluted
[44:29] reasoning behind these startling
[44:31] dimensions is
[44:33] interesting. We we won't go into it.
[44:36] This is a view of the model built at
[44:38] Timna. As mentioned last week, it's
[44:41] another concept with the altar sitting
[44:43] on four small rock piles. This allows
[44:47] making it level if the tabernacle is
[44:49] erected on ground that's not perfectly
[44:51] smooth. And it also in this case shows
[44:54] it's spaced high enough to add wood to
[44:56] and remove ashes from the fire.
[45:01] The sides almost look like bricks or
[45:04] blocks, but they're copper plates
[45:05] averaging about 8 in high and 12 in
[45:08] wide.
[45:10] You're probably thinking, "Wait a
[45:12] minute, Brother Lyle. The Bible clearly
[45:15] says brass or bronze and you're saying
[45:18] copper.
[45:20] Please explain.
[45:23] The tabernacle was fabricated at Mount
[45:26] Horeb by people who had lived in Egypt
[45:28] for many generations. The Egyptians made
[45:32] tools and weapons and so forth of copper
[45:35] which they could mine. Brass or bronze
[45:38] is an alloy of copper and zinc, which
[45:42] means you need a ready source of zinc.
[45:45] Egypt didn't have zinc. So, the people
[45:47] Moses was bringing from Egypt could not
[45:49] have been carrying brass or bronze.
[45:52] There wasn't any to bring, but they
[45:54] could be bringing copper. In fact, many
[45:56] of them had likely worked in the
[45:58] Egyptian copper mines located in the
[46:00] Sinai. The biblical Hebrew word used is
[46:04] variously translated copper, brass or
[46:08] bronze. The key here is translated.
[46:12] We're reading an English translation
[46:15] from some 400 years ago of this Hebrew
[46:19] word from some 3,400 years ago.
[46:22] Jewish sources say the metal used was
[46:25] copper and the altar you see here is
[46:27] therefore covered in copper rather than
[46:29] alloy to create brass or bronze.
[46:33] I may use the word brass or copper in
[46:35] this lesson, but the meaning in Moses
[46:38] time was copper, but if you're more
[46:40] comfortable with brass, when I say
[46:41] copper, think brass. Otherwise, when I
[46:44] say brass, think copper.
[46:48] Okay, let's see if we can go a little
[46:50] further. Uh, two of the tools mentioned
[46:53] for the altar are leaning against its
[46:54] side, a shovel and a meat fork.
[46:58] The staves go through rings, and if you
[47:00] look really closely,
[47:02] you'll see copper rods that form the
[47:05] rings to go to the bottom of the altar.
[47:07] They then wrap around the bottom edges
[47:09] near the corners and attach to the
[47:11] grate.
[47:13] Here's a view of that particular grate.
[47:15] There's a small amount of firewood
[47:17] centered beneath it. The walls of the
[47:20] altar are hollow with an internal
[47:22] spacing of maybe four inches.
[47:25] If you think about it, this is a copper
[47:28] clad, brassclad wooden structure.
[47:33] The fire has to be away from the edges
[47:35] or the wood will turn to charcoal inside
[47:37] the copper make meaning the altar would
[47:39] have to be continuously rebuilt if a
[47:42] large fire were regularly burning in it.
[47:46] Would a wooden core altar like this
[47:48] actually work?
[47:50] Would it survive for very long with a
[47:53] fire in the middle of it? How many of us
[47:56] here have a wooden barbecue grill?
[47:59] I didn't think so. It's not as crazy as
[48:02] you might first think or as I first
[48:05] thought. Think about a campfire. You
[48:08] have a place where you're burning wood,
[48:09] usually with some rocks around it, and
[48:11] you've got some additional wood to toss
[48:13] into the campfire.
[48:17] What is the safe distance for the wood
[48:19] pile from the fire?
[48:22] I mean, the safest near distance,
[48:23] ignoring sparks and so forth. The wood
[48:25] can be pretty warm without it being in
[48:27] danger of igniting. 3 feet or so is
[48:31] probably going to work.
[48:34] This is the edge of the fire. Your wood
[48:36] pipe, I've had campfires about that
[48:38] close and the forest didn't catch on
[48:41] fire.
[48:44] the wood can get pretty warm. So looking
[48:47] at it this way, a metalclad wooden
[48:50] chimney is practical. And in essence,
[48:52] that's what the altar is, a metalclad
[48:55] wooden chimney with a grate for holding
[48:58] the food being cooked, or in this case,
[48:59] the animal remains being burned.
[49:02] The nearest part of the altar would be
[49:04] about three feet from the edge of a
[49:05] reasonable fire in the center. The
[49:07] corners would be nearly five feet away
[49:09] with copper sheeting drawing the heat
[49:11] from the nearer harder areas towards the
[49:13] corners
[49:15] and acting as a chimney. Outside air
[49:17] would be drawn up inside the altar
[49:19] bringing oxygen for the fire and cooling
[49:22] air flowing up the sides
[49:27] reducing the temperature of the overall
[49:29] structure.
[49:31] Thus, the wooden core of the altar would
[49:34] survive the heat.
[49:36] And that's likely the reason it's so
[49:38] large. Large because it would burn if
[49:41] too close to the heat of the fire, yet
[49:43] small enough that its weight could be
[49:44] carried by four or maybe eight people.
[49:50] This view gives you an idea of how large
[49:52] this altar was. This is a group of
[49:54] tourists at the Timna Tabernacle site.
[49:56] The altar is pretty big. Um Ava, if I
[50:01] could uh have you come up here and help
[50:04] me with something. And I I'm going to
[50:06] need uh three more people to volunteer.
[50:10] Brother, Dan, and sister, I see that
[50:12] you've got some of your kids here. You
[50:14] think we could get three of them to come
[50:15] up and help me?
[50:18] I'm not going to embarrass you. The the
[50:20] requirements are simply that you're
[50:21] strong enough to hold a piece of this
[50:24] and that you can reach about this high.
[50:29] One, two, three. Okay, fourth one is
[50:33] coming. If I didn't get this tangled up
[50:35] too much,
[50:37] if you'd be so kind as just as to hold
[50:39] that, we'll consider that as a as as
[50:43] something for you to hold. Um, let's see
[50:45] if I can get this untangled. If you can
[50:47] take that one
[50:50] and and and
[50:52] you can take that one. Okay.
[51:01] In this case, I'm not the priest. on the
[51:03] clutch.
[51:04] If you take that one. Okay. Now, here's
[51:07] the trick.
[51:10] Need you to hold that. So, that's kind
[51:11] of straight. And if you could walk
[51:12] towards the edge, you don't go over the
[51:13] edge.
[51:15] Yeah. Okay. And if you hold it up just
[51:18] high enough that the bottom of that is
[51:19] just touching the carpet. Just just
[51:22] touching the carpet. Okay. So, this is
[51:25] five cubits by five cubits by three
[51:29] cubits. That's the size of the altar.
[51:32] And if I don't get burned,
[51:34] I'm about the size of the fire. I think
[51:36] that's far enough away. You wouldn't
[51:37] want it any smaller. It's going to turn
[51:39] to charcoal. You don't want any bigger.
[51:41] You can't pick it up to carry it.
[51:44] Thank you very much. You've been a very
[51:46] great help. [applause]
[52:01] Well, for our purposes,
[52:03] we'll go with this altar at Timna.
[52:08] This is a view a worshipper entering the
[52:10] courtyard might see as he brings his
[52:12] sacrifice. The altar, as we just saw, is
[52:15] five cubit square, about 7 and 1/2 ft.
[52:18] The columns for the horns add a bit, so
[52:20] call it eight feet on a side. It's 4 and
[52:23] 1/2 ft, three cubits high. It maybe sits
[52:26] a foot off the ground. So, you saw how
[52:28] high it was with our volunteers, and
[52:30] again, thank you. It would be maybe this
[52:33] much higher to allow room for the wood
[52:36] and the ashes and so forth.
[52:39] Now, people in ancient times weren't
[52:40] very tall. Goliath is an exception. If
[52:44] the average person was 5 to 5 and 1/2 ft
[52:47] tall, their eyes would not be able to
[52:49] see behind the altar, just like this
[52:51] view here. But the tabernacle was 15
[52:54] feet high or so, so the worshipper could
[52:57] see it over the top. Again, very much
[52:59] like you see on the screen. But one
[53:02] other thing,
[53:04] notice the dimension of five cubits. The
[53:07] value five is associated with the
[53:09] concept of grace. Sometimes defined as
[53:13] unmmerited favor. You don't earn it. It
[53:16] was given to you or granted in spite of
[53:19] the fact that you didn't earn it. So
[53:20] here we see the grace of God in the
[53:24] dimensions allowing one's sins to be
[53:26] judged with the copper or brass speaks
[53:28] of and the punishment is passed to a
[53:31] surrogate to pay the penalty. Hence the
[53:34] sacrificial altar.
[53:36] The brass speaking of judgment, the
[53:39] dimensions speaking of grace. Now,
[53:42] inside the courtyard, look at the outer
[53:44] wall curtain. You see the right of the
[53:46] altar here. I'll help you a bit. Yeah,
[53:48] there we go.
[53:50] In this view, it's near the right edge
[53:52] of the image on the screen. What size
[53:55] are those panels, the individual
[53:57] hangings which form the wall of the
[54:00] courtyard?
[54:02] In Exodus 27 verse 11
[54:08] we read likewise
[54:11] for the north side in length shall be
[54:14] hangings of 100 cubits long talking
[54:16] about the outer wall and it's 20
[54:19] pillars. Ah do the math 100 divided by
[54:22] 20 equals five. So each panel or hanging
[54:26] is five cubits in length. And skipping
[54:29] to verse 18, the height five cubits of
[54:32] fine twined linen. Twin means the fibers
[54:35] make the cloth have been twisted or
[54:37] woven. So the linen panels that comprise
[54:40] the outer wall of the courtyard are also
[54:43] five cubits by five cubits. God's
[54:46] righteousness, the white linen says,
[54:49] "Keep out.
[54:51] If you come in, you'll die."
[54:54] However, God's grace
[54:56] and the dimension of each panel says,
[54:59] "Look, I've made a way for you to enter
[55:02] into my righteousness where we can
[55:05] meet." We see nothing but grace extended
[55:08] to us, even in the symbol of God's
[55:11] righteousness.
[55:12] One wall of separation,
[55:15] but composed of many panels of grace.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[55:24] &gt;&gt; And the brazen altar says, "See, it's by
[55:28] grace your sins can be judged and the
[55:31] consequences removed.
[55:34] Enter and let us commune."
[55:37] As the prophet wrote Isaiah 1 verse 18,
[55:40] "Come now, let us reason together,
[55:44] sayaeth the Lord. Though your sins be as
[55:47] scarlet, they shall be white as snow.
[55:50] Though they be red like crimson, they
[55:53] shall be his wool.
[55:55] No wonder the psalmist could write in
[55:57] the hundth psalm, "Enter into his gates
[56:01] with thanksgiving,
[56:03] into his courts with praise. Be thankful
[56:07] unto him and bless his name."
[56:15] Among the various sacrifices and
[56:18] offerings, there was a continual daily
[56:22] sacrifice to the Lord. In Exodus 29, we
[56:25] read, "Now this is that which thou shalt
[56:28] offer upon the altar,
[56:31] two lambs of the first year, day by day,
[56:35] continually.
[56:36] The one lamb shalt thou offer in the
[56:38] morning. The other lamb thou shalt offer
[56:40] it even. And with the lambet one/tenth
[56:43] deal, about a gallon of flour mingled
[56:46] with a fourth part of an hen, which that
[56:48] fourth part's a bit over a quart of
[56:51] beaten oil. That would be olive oil. And
[56:53] the fourth part of an hint of wine,
[56:55] about a quart for a drink offering. And
[56:58] the other lamb shalt thou offer it even,
[57:00] and shalt do thereto according to the
[57:02] offering of the morning, and according
[57:04] to the drink offering.
[57:06] Why?
[57:10] For a sweet savor.
[57:13] This means a pleasant fragrance, a
[57:15] pleasing aroma,
[57:17] an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
[57:22] This shall be a continual burnt offering
[57:25] throughout your generations at the door
[57:26] of the tabernacle of the congregation
[57:28] before the Lord where I will meet you to
[57:32] speak there unto thee.
[57:36] A sweet savor.
[57:38] We may not think of it as pleasant, but
[57:40] we're told it pleased God.
[57:44] Why is that important?
[57:47] In the culture of the time, the nose
[57:52] was equated with anger. In fact, in
[57:57] biblical Hebrew, the same word off is
[58:00] used. From context, you know, whether
[58:02] it's nose, nostrils, or anger or wrath.
[58:08] It's the same word. Recall that when his
[58:11] sons butchered the men of Sheckchham,
[58:13] Jacob's comment was
[58:19] Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "Ye have
[58:23] troubled me to make me stink among the
[58:26] inhabitants of the land, among the
[58:29] Canaanites and the Parizzites. I being
[58:32] few in number, they shall gather
[58:34] themselves together against me and slay
[58:36] me. I shall be destroyed. I and my
[58:39] house.
[58:42] Anger and wrath are associated with a
[58:45] bad smell.
[58:47] In contrast, then peace and tranquility
[58:51] would be associated with a pleasant
[58:53] smell or odor. And the Lord wanted to
[58:56] associate a pleasant aroma with his
[58:59] people continually.
[59:07] Israel was commanded to always provide
[59:11] this pleasant odor, this sweet smelling
[59:13] savor day in day out, every day,
[59:18] including the Sabbath forever.
[59:22] What constituted morning and evening for
[59:25] these offerings? According to the 1906
[59:28] Jewish Encyclopedia,
[59:31] which was the latest version I found a
[59:33] complete one of online, it talks about
[59:35] these burnt offerings and it says the uh
[59:38] the standard offerings, occasional
[59:40] offerings, the stated offerings. Number
[59:42] one, the daily burnt offering presented
[59:44] at the time of the morning and evening
[59:46] prayer, the the third and ninth hours.
[59:48] The victim was a lamb or kid a year old
[59:52] and so forth. the the third and ninth
[59:55] hour of sacrifice
[59:58] roughly 9:00 am and 3 pm. So this altar
[1:00:02] also reminds us of that day that day of
[1:00:06] days that day on Calvary. We read in the
[1:00:10] gospel of Mark and they bring Jesus unto
[1:00:13] the place Goltha which is being
[1:00:15] interpreted the place of a skull and it
[1:00:18] was the third hour and they crucified
[1:00:21] him. At the very moment a lamb was being
[1:00:25] sacrificed nearby on the altar in the
[1:00:27] temple for a sweet smelling savor. A
[1:00:30] lamb that perhaps was born in the very
[1:00:32] manger where Jesus was born. One where
[1:00:35] sacrificial lambs were born and cared
[1:00:38] for.
[1:00:39] When the sixth hour was come, that would
[1:00:41] be noon, there was darkness over the
[1:00:43] whole land until the 9inth hour. And at
[1:00:46] the ninth hour, at the very moment,
[1:00:49] another lamb was being sacrificed on the
[1:00:52] altar in the temple, Jesus cried with a
[1:00:55] loud voice, saying, "Eloy, Aloy, Lama,"
[1:00:59] which is being interpreted, "My God, my
[1:01:02] God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[1:01:06] Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave
[1:01:10] up the ghost.
[1:01:15] Lamb on the brazen altar, Jesus on the
[1:01:18] cross.
[1:01:20] We see that the altar though covered in
[1:01:23] copper was a wooden structure
[1:01:27] as was the cross.
[1:01:30] The four horns of the altar remind me of
[1:01:33] four nails on that cross. Three that
[1:01:36] secured Jesus to suffer and die. The
[1:01:39] fourth to bear testimony, holding up a
[1:01:43] sign that I combined from all four
[1:01:45] gospel accounts. The sign that said,
[1:01:46] "This is Jesus of Nazareth, the King of
[1:01:50] the Jews."
[1:01:52] There's so much here. If we take time to
[1:01:55] stop and look,
[1:02:01] what else would we see here in this part
[1:02:04] of the courtyard?
[1:02:07] The priests.
[1:02:09] How would we recognize them?
[1:02:16] Oops.
[1:02:20] Excuse me. We have a technical
[1:02:23] difficulty.
[1:02:36] Almost there. I'm sure you've all read
[1:02:38] that, so you've refreshed yourselves.
[1:02:40] Here we go. The priests.
[1:02:43] How do we recognize them? By their
[1:02:44] uniforms.
[1:02:47] Same way we might recognize a police
[1:02:49] person or a captain or first officer of
[1:02:51] an airliner.
[1:02:54] The Lord gave Moses specifics for the
[1:02:56] priestly uniform. In fact, there were
[1:02:59] two uniforms. One designed for the
[1:03:00] regular priests and a special uniform
[1:03:03] for the high priest. In the courtyard by
[1:03:07] the altar, you probably would not see
[1:03:08] the high priest, but would see one or
[1:03:11] more of the regular priests.
[1:03:14] But let's take a look at these uniforms.
[1:03:17] Exodus 28. And take thou unto thee Aaron
[1:03:21] thy brother, and his sons with him from
[1:03:23] among the children of Israel, that he
[1:03:26] may minister unto
[1:03:28] who
[1:03:30] is a priest ministering unto the people.
[1:03:33] No. May minister unto me, the Lord in
[1:03:37] the priest's office. Even Aaron, Naab,
[1:03:41] and Abaiu, Elizar, and Itar, Aaron's
[1:03:44] sons. And like them,
[1:03:48] we serve our Lord by serving his people.
[1:03:53] Thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron
[1:03:55] thy brother, for glory and for beauty.
[1:03:57] Aaron would be the first high priest.
[1:04:00] Thou shalt speak unto all that are
[1:04:02] wisehearted and and that means skilled
[1:04:04] with with good judgment whom I have
[1:04:07] filled with the spirit of wisdom. God's
[1:04:11] already prepared them ahead of time for
[1:04:13] their work of service to him.
[1:04:16] I have filled with the spirit of wisdom
[1:04:18] that they may make Aaron's garments to
[1:04:21] consecrate him that he may minister unto
[1:04:24] me in the priest's office.
[1:04:27] The the uniform is important.
[1:04:30] And these are the garments which they
[1:04:34] who the wisehearted shall make. a
[1:04:38] breastplate and an ephod that's a a
[1:04:41] ritual vest and a robe and a embroidered
[1:04:44] coat. This doesn't mean embroidered with
[1:04:47] colorful thread as we think of
[1:04:48] embroidery today. It means the linen
[1:04:51] cloth was woven with a pattern texture.
[1:04:54] Many translations call it a checkered
[1:04:56] tunic suggesting the pattern not colors.
[1:05:01] a miter, often translated as a turban,
[1:05:04] and a girdle, a sash or belt.
[1:05:08] And they shall make holy garments for
[1:05:10] Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he
[1:05:12] may minister unto me in the priest's
[1:05:14] office.
[1:05:15] And there follows a long description of
[1:05:17] high priest specific items. We're going
[1:05:19] to get to the regular priests. So, we
[1:05:21] skip down to verse 39.
[1:05:24] Thou shalt embroider the coat, weave the
[1:05:26] patterned tunic of fine linen, and thou
[1:05:29] shalt make the minor the turban of fine
[1:05:31] linen. Thou shalt make the girdle the
[1:05:33] sash or belt of needle work decorated.
[1:05:36] In this case, it's a work of a weaver.
[1:05:38] It it it has colors.
[1:05:41] And for Aaron's sons, thou shalt make
[1:05:43] coats,
[1:05:45] tunics shown here is woven checker work
[1:05:48] of fine linen, the same as for the high
[1:05:51] priest. And thou shalt make for them
[1:05:53] girdles, sashes, the same as for the
[1:05:56] high priest, and bonnetss, not not not a
[1:06:00] miter, but caps or hats. This is a
[1:06:02] simpler hat than the turban for the high
[1:06:05] priest. Thou shalt make for them for
[1:06:07] glory and beauty, dignity, splendor.
[1:06:11] And thou shalt put the the high priestly
[1:06:14] uniform upon Aaron thy brother, and his
[1:06:17] sons, which will wear the uniform of the
[1:06:19] regular priest with him. and shalt to
[1:06:22] anoint them and consecrate them and
[1:06:23] sanctify them that they may minister
[1:06:26] unto me in the priest's office.
[1:06:29] And thou shalt make them linen breaches
[1:06:31] to cover their nakedness. From the loins
[1:06:33] even to the thighs they shall reach. And
[1:06:35] the English Standard Version says, "You
[1:06:37] shall make for them linen undergarments
[1:06:39] to cover their naked flesh. They shall
[1:06:41] reach from the hips to the thighs,
[1:06:45] and they shall be upon Aaron and upon
[1:06:47] his sons, when they come in unto the
[1:06:50] tabernacle of the congregation,
[1:06:52] or when they come near unto the altar to
[1:06:55] minister in the holy place, that they
[1:06:57] bear not iniquity, and die. It shall be
[1:07:00] a statute forever unto him and his
[1:07:02] descendants after him.
[1:07:05] There's a serious penalty for not
[1:07:07] wearing the priestly garments whenever a
[1:07:09] priest is inside the tabernacle
[1:07:11] compound.
[1:07:13] This is a pretty comprehensive and
[1:07:15] detailed description of the uniform.
[1:07:18] Four items for the regular priest down
[1:07:20] to specifying even their undergarments.
[1:07:23] In this picture, we see a sketch of a
[1:07:26] regular priest and a mannequin dressed
[1:07:29] as a regular priest.
[1:07:33] Yeah, there's some things missing on
[1:07:34] that.
[1:07:37] Note the sash or girdle.
[1:07:40] Was it white for the regular priests or
[1:07:42] multicolored as shown here? In Exodus
[1:07:45] 39, when the garments and other items
[1:07:47] are being made, we read, "They made
[1:07:49] coats of fine linen of woven work for
[1:07:52] Aaron and for his sons, and a miter of
[1:07:55] fine linen, that that turban for the
[1:07:56] high priest, and goodly bonnets of fine
[1:07:59] linen, hats for the regular priests, and
[1:08:02] linen breaches of fine twined linen for
[1:08:04] both. and a girdle of fine twined linen
[1:08:08] and blue and purple and scarlet of
[1:08:10] needle work also for both priestly
[1:08:13] uniforms as the Lord commanded Moses.
[1:08:16] So, so they were colored. We see the
[1:08:18] sashes of linen woven with purple, blue,
[1:08:22] scarlet threads.
[1:08:25] Blue, as we mentioned last time, often
[1:08:28] signified the heavens and by extension
[1:08:30] the divine presence. Scarlet, a bright
[1:08:33] red, represented the blood of sacrifice,
[1:08:36] the penalty for sin.
[1:08:39] Purple dye was rare and expensive. It
[1:08:42] represented royalty and wealth. As we
[1:08:45] discussed last week, if you think about
[1:08:47] it, purple is a combination of red and
[1:08:52] blue.
[1:08:54] White, as we said, represents
[1:08:55] righteousness. So, back to the image of
[1:08:57] a regular priest. If I ask you what you
[1:09:00] don't see, you'd probably say, "Well,
[1:09:03] duh, Brother Ly, you don't see those
[1:09:06] undergarments."
[1:09:08] Yeah, that's true. But but what else
[1:09:11] don't you see?
[1:09:14] Shoes or sandals?
[1:09:17] The sketch and the mannequin are both
[1:09:18] barefoot.
[1:09:20] They have no shoes.
[1:09:23] Moses was not given direction to make
[1:09:25] shoes or sandals for the priest who
[1:09:27] would be spending a lot of time walking
[1:09:29] on the raw desert floor of the
[1:09:31] courtyard.
[1:09:34] This is intentional
[1:09:37] was not an oversight. The priests and
[1:09:39] the service at the tabernacle compound
[1:09:42] went barefoot performing sacrifices and
[1:09:45] other rituals.
[1:09:50] You may be thinking, why would God want
[1:09:52] the priests to be barefoot in the
[1:09:54] compound?
[1:09:55] Are you sure about this, Brother L?
[1:09:58] Maybe God didn't care what they wore on
[1:10:00] their feet, so he didn't bother to
[1:10:01] specify it.
[1:10:04] Are you sure? Well, I'm pretty sure
[1:10:07] 99.9999%.
[1:10:12] Why?
[1:10:13] Inside the compound is considered holy
[1:10:16] ground, a sanctified space. The outer
[1:10:20] wall signified righteousness
[1:10:22] and this is inside that wall.
[1:10:26] Consider this from earlier in Exodus
[1:10:30] chapter 3.
[1:10:33] Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his
[1:10:35] father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And
[1:10:37] he led the flock to the backside of the
[1:10:39] desert and came to the mountain of God,
[1:10:42] even to Horeb.
[1:10:44] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[1:10:46] Moses in a flame of fire out of the
[1:10:49] midst of the bush. And Moses looked, and
[1:10:53] behold, the bush burned with fire. And
[1:10:57] the bush was not consumed.
[1:11:00] And Moses said,
[1:11:02] "Huh, I will now turn aside, see this
[1:11:06] great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
[1:11:10] And when the Lord saw that Moses turned
[1:11:13] aside to see, God called unto him out of
[1:11:16] the midst of the bush and said, "Moses,
[1:11:18] Moses."
[1:11:20] And Moses said,
[1:11:23] "Here am I."
[1:11:26] And the Lord said, "Draw not nigh
[1:11:29] hither. Don't come any closer. Put off
[1:11:32] thy shoes from off thy feet. For the
[1:11:35] place whereon thou standest is holy
[1:11:38] ground.
[1:11:40] If Moses had to take his shoes off on
[1:11:43] what the Lord said was holy sanctified
[1:11:46] ground, it seems reasonable this would
[1:11:49] be the case wherever the Lord designated
[1:11:51] a space as holy. And Mount Orb, where
[1:11:55] Moses saw the bush, was the same place
[1:11:57] where the tabernacle compound would
[1:11:59] initially be erected.
[1:12:05] One thing we haven't talked about yet is
[1:12:08] the use of linen.
[1:12:10] Not its color, but the material itself.
[1:12:14] Why not cotton
[1:12:17] or material [snorts] from some other
[1:12:18] plant like agave?
[1:12:20] Well, let's take a look.
[1:12:24] Linen is made from the fibers of a flax
[1:12:26] plant.
[1:12:29] Flax yield seeds that are nutritious or
[1:12:32] can be crushed to extract linseed oil.
[1:12:34] But each stock contains many long,
[1:12:37] sturdy fibers that are ideal for weaving
[1:12:40] into cloth. As you see in the image, the
[1:12:42] fibers are light colored. They're also
[1:12:45] long, often three feet or more, and
[1:12:47] strong. The flax fibers are two to three
[1:12:50] times stronger than cotton fibers, for
[1:12:52] example.
[1:12:54] Linen made from flax was commonly used
[1:12:57] for priestly garments even in Samaran
[1:12:59] Egypt. But but there's more to it than
[1:13:02] that. According to the rabbis, quoting
[1:13:05] and paraphrasing a bit, the uh
[1:13:08] tabernacle outer court wall hangings
[1:13:10] were made of linen because flax from
[1:13:13] which linen is made differs from other
[1:13:16] plants in that only a single stock grows
[1:13:21] from each seed.
[1:13:23] Since the Jew is distinguished from
[1:13:26] other nations by virtue of his absolute
[1:13:28] monotheism, it's appropriate that the
[1:13:31] curtain separating the tabernacle from
[1:13:33] the surrounding world was made of this
[1:13:35] material.
[1:13:37] In addition, the flax plant alludes to
[1:13:39] our mission to spread knowledge of God's
[1:13:41] oneness to the world at large. Our sages
[1:13:44] tell us that flax depletes the land, the
[1:13:48] soil of its nutrients and land signifies
[1:13:51] the earthly materialistic consciousness
[1:13:53] that opposes the faith in one God.
[1:13:57] They go on to say, "We Jews are a people
[1:14:00] who bring awareness of God's oneness to
[1:14:02] the materialistic world."
[1:14:05] One stock proceeded, symbolizing the
[1:14:08] oneness of God.
[1:14:11] So, moving along,
[1:14:15] as we now walk around the north end of
[1:14:18] the altar, we get a better view of the
[1:14:20] east end of the tabernacle itself.
[1:14:24] There's something between the altar and
[1:14:26] the tabernacle.
[1:14:28] What is it?
[1:14:31] In this example, it looks a bit like a
[1:14:34] really large bird bath, but that's not
[1:14:37] what it is. So, what is it? Exodus 30
[1:14:41] beginning at verse 17.
[1:14:44] The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, "Thou
[1:14:47] shalt also make a lav, a basin of brass,
[1:14:50] at his foot also of brass to wash with
[1:14:52] all, and thou shalt put it between the
[1:14:54] tabernacle of the congregation and the
[1:14:56] altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
[1:15:00] For Aaron and his sons shall wash their
[1:15:02] hands and their feet there at
[1:15:06] when they go into the tabernacle of the
[1:15:08] congregation, they shall wash with water
[1:15:11] that they die not. And when they come
[1:15:13] near to the altar to minister, to burn
[1:15:15] offering made by fire unto the Lord, so
[1:15:18] shall they wash their hands and their
[1:15:20] feet, that they die not. and it should
[1:15:23] be a statute forever to them, even to
[1:15:26] him and his descendants throughout their
[1:15:30] generations.
[1:15:33] We don't know if this was the shape of
[1:15:35] it or not. This is we don't even know
[1:15:38] the size. This is the only major item
[1:15:40] inside the tabernacle compound for which
[1:15:43] no dimensions are given.
[1:15:45] All we know is that it was a copper or
[1:15:48] brass basin with a separate foot or or
[1:15:51] stand and that it is only to be used by
[1:15:54] the priests
[1:15:56] and that they must use it.
[1:16:00] Personal hygiene was something that God
[1:16:02] cared about. The Jewish nation was
[1:16:03] certainly far ahead of their time in
[1:16:05] this regard. The barefooted priests
[1:16:08] offering sacrifices were regularly
[1:16:11] exposed to blood as they killed the
[1:16:13] animals being offered. The dying
[1:16:15] creatures would expel various body
[1:16:18] wastes which ultimately had to be
[1:16:19] cleaned up.
[1:16:21] You can be sure the priests had dirty
[1:16:24] feet. Washing their hands and feet
[1:16:27] before every sacrifice helped to keep
[1:16:28] them safe in human terms, sanctified in
[1:16:32] spiritual terms.
[1:16:38] The lava was used over and over again
[1:16:41] every day by the priests as they offered
[1:16:43] sacrifices and as they had occasion to
[1:16:45] enter the tabernacle. It's likely they
[1:16:48] use some sort of cups or scoops to get
[1:16:50] the water from the lav and use the water
[1:16:52] taken with which to wash. It would be
[1:16:55] important to keep the water in the lav
[1:16:57] pure. The point isn't to get wet, but to
[1:17:00] get clean.
[1:17:03] How might this apply to us? We're We're
[1:17:05] not priests, are we?
[1:17:13] In First Peter 2, we read, "But you are
[1:17:16] a chosen generation, you, we, us,
[1:17:21] a royal priesthood,
[1:17:24] an holy nation, a peculiar people, that
[1:17:27] you should show forth the praises of him
[1:17:29] who hath called you out of darkness into
[1:17:31] his marvelous light.
[1:17:35] Like the priests in the days of the
[1:17:36] tabernacle using the lather, we need to
[1:17:39] constantly cleanse our hearts, our minds
[1:17:42] of the impurities and dirt that we're
[1:17:45] exposed to and in which we walk and work
[1:17:49] every day.
[1:17:55] There's another unique thing about the
[1:17:57] lavver.
[1:17:58] Not only that we don't know its shape or
[1:18:00] size.
[1:18:02] It's the only object whose material
[1:18:05] source was specified. Not not just the
[1:18:09] material, brass or copper, but
[1:18:12] specifically
[1:18:13] who donated it.
[1:18:16] When the design was finished and the
[1:18:18] components of the tabernacle compound
[1:18:20] were being manufactured by the
[1:18:22] Israelites at Orb, we read in Exodus 38,
[1:18:29] "And Moses made the lavver of brass and
[1:18:32] the foot of it of brass of the looking
[1:18:34] glasses that is the hand mirrors of the
[1:18:38] women assembling which assembled at the
[1:18:40] door of the tabernacle of the
[1:18:42] congregation."
[1:18:45] Egyptians used polished copper to create
[1:18:48] a mirror.
[1:18:50] These were used for, among other
[1:18:51] purposes, by the ladies to be sure they
[1:18:54] were looking their best. This is an
[1:18:56] ancient Egyptian mirror. It's between
[1:18:58] 800 and 100 BC. So, it doesn't quite
[1:19:01] date back to the time of the tabernacle,
[1:19:04] but I don't think the designs change
[1:19:06] significantly then. The exact age of
[1:19:08] this particular beer that's I believe in
[1:19:11] the Louvre is uncertain.
[1:19:14] The rabbitical commentary on this
[1:19:16] sourcing says that the women were
[1:19:17] assembled at the door of the entrance of
[1:19:19] the tabernacle of the congregation for
[1:19:22] the purpose of donating their mirrors.
[1:19:28] In other words, this gathering wasn't a
[1:19:31] common thing. They were there
[1:19:33] specifically
[1:19:34] to donate something that was important
[1:19:37] to them.
[1:19:40] How important? Why? Why do you say
[1:19:42] important, brother Low? Remember, they
[1:19:45] fled from Egypt. They didn't have time
[1:19:47] for the dough to rise on their bread.
[1:19:49] They had to go and go in a hurry.
[1:19:52] When they fled, they were only taking
[1:19:54] the necessities they could carry. They
[1:19:57] didn't have pickup trucks. They lived in
[1:19:59] mudbrick places in Gan.
[1:20:02] And most of them didn't have animals or
[1:20:04] carts. So, you've got to leave. You've
[1:20:07] got to leave in the morning. And you can
[1:20:09] only take your carry-on. You can't check
[1:20:10] a bag. It's only your carry-on.
[1:20:14] These mirrors made the cut.
[1:20:18] They must have been somewhere near the
[1:20:20] top of the list in importance.
[1:20:23] The rabbis say God instructed Moses to
[1:20:25] use this copper from the mirrors to melt
[1:20:27] down to cast the labor.
[1:20:31] This is the only time listing all the
[1:20:33] uses of brass or copper for the
[1:20:35] construction of the tabernacle compound
[1:20:37] that a specific source is given.
[1:20:41] We'll later see that many of the
[1:20:43] Israelite women also worked in making
[1:20:45] the tabernacle itself.
[1:20:49] I see such a parallel in the Gospels.
[1:20:54] In Luke 7, it ends, we're being told of
[1:20:57] a woman who washed Jesus' feet with her
[1:20:59] tears.
[1:21:01] We then read in Luke 8,
[1:21:04] it came to pass afterward
[1:21:07] that Jesus went throughout every city
[1:21:09] and village preaching and showing the
[1:21:12] glad tidings of the kingdom of God. And
[1:21:15] the 12 were with him?
[1:21:18] The 12?
[1:21:21] Any other disciples?
[1:21:23] Who besides the 12?
[1:21:27] and certain women which had been healed
[1:21:29] of evil spirits and infirmities,
[1:21:32] including Mary called Magdalene, out of
[1:21:34] whom went seven devils,
[1:21:37] and Joanna, the wife of Kusa, Herod's
[1:21:41] steward, and Susanna, and many others,
[1:21:46] which ministered unto him of of what?
[1:21:51] Their substance,
[1:21:53] their valuables.
[1:21:55] They supported him financially.
[1:21:58] In effect, they donated their mirrors.
[1:22:02] If the worship team would please return,
[1:22:06] notice just like the bronze lavver is
[1:22:09] uniquely identified as being sourced by
[1:22:12] many women of the congregation. Here we
[1:22:15] see that Jesus ministry was also
[1:22:17] supported by many women, more than 12,
[1:22:21] more than the 12 guys.
[1:22:24] And they were faithful followers to the
[1:22:26] end.
[1:22:28] Mary Magdalene, for example, was the
[1:22:30] first one to the tomb that Easter
[1:22:34] morning, the first to report his
[1:22:36] resurrection to the scoffing male
[1:22:39] disciples.
[1:22:41] Joanna was part of the next group that
[1:22:44] went and told of his resurrection.
[1:22:49] I'd like to encourage all of the sisters
[1:22:51] here know that what you do and who you
[1:22:55] are are vitally important.
[1:22:59] Nothing goes forward without you. No
[1:23:02] lyver so the priests can't minister.
[1:23:07] No witness of the resurrection and the
[1:23:09] time of Jesus.
[1:23:12] Back to the tabernacle compound. What
[1:23:15] else do we see? Oh, just beyond the lava
[1:23:19] of tabernacle itself.
[1:23:21] Oh, let's take a good look and go inside
[1:23:24] next time.
[1:23:27] As we close this portion of the service,
[1:23:30] let's stand, please, and and let's sing
[1:23:33] together a a song [music]
[1:23:35] based in part from Psalm 100, which we
[1:23:38] read earlier.
[1:23:40] I will enter his gates with
[1:23:42] thanksgiving.
[1:23:46] I will [singing] enter his gates with
[1:23:50] thanksgiving in my heart. [music] I will
[1:23:54] enter his courts with praise.
[1:23:59] I will say this is the day that the Lord
[1:24:04] has made. I will [music] rejoice for he
[1:24:09] has made me glad.
[1:24:13] He [music and singing] has made me glad.
[1:24:17] He has made me glad.
[1:24:20] I will rejoice for he has made me glad.
[1:24:24] [singing]
[1:24:27] He has made me glad.
[1:24:30] He has made me glad.
[1:24:33] I will rejoice for he has made me glad.
[1:24:39] I [singing and music] will enter his
[1:24:41] gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I
[1:24:46] will [singing and music] enter his
[1:24:48] courts with praise.
[1:24:52] I will [music] say this is the day that
[1:24:56] the Lord has made. I will rejoice for he
[1:25:02] has made me glad.
[1:25:06] He has made me glad.
[1:25:10] He has made me glad.
[1:25:12] I will rejoice for he has made [music]
[1:25:16] me glad.
[1:25:20] He has made me glad.
[1:25:23] He has made me glad.
[1:25:26] I will [music] rejoice for he hath made
[1:25:29] me glad.
[1:25:32] I will enter his gates with thanksgiving
[1:25:37] in my heart. I [singing] will enter his
[1:25:41] courts with praise.
[1:25:45] I will say this is the day that the Lord
[1:25:50] hath made. I will rejoice for he hath
[1:25:55] made me glad.
[1:25:59] He hath made me glad.
[1:26:03] He hath made me glad.
[1:26:06] I will rejoice for he hath made me glad.
[1:26:12] He hath made me glad.
[1:26:16] He hath made [music and singing] me
[1:26:17] glad.
[1:26:19] I will rejoice for he hath made me glad.
[1:26:25] I will rejoice for he hath made me glad.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; He did it all. He took care of it all.
[1:26:31] He lays out a plan, a perfect plan, a
[1:26:34] drawing. And not only does it, but he
[1:26:37] gives them the inspiration, the desire
[1:26:39] to do what what he wanted done. There
[1:26:42] was not a Lord, I don't want to do it
[1:26:44] that way. God said so. And that's the
[1:26:46] same. Our hearts should be the same way.
[1:26:49] This is what the Lord has asked of us.
[1:26:51] Then that's what I want to do. Bless the
[1:26:54] Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within
[1:26:57] me, bless his holy name.
[1:27:02] Oh, bless the Lord, [singing]
[1:27:06] oh my soul,
[1:27:09] and all [singing] that is within me.
[1:27:15] Bless his holy
[1:27:20] name.
[1:27:23] Bless the Lord,
[1:27:27] oh my [singing] soul,
[1:27:30] and all that is within me. Bless his
[1:27:36] [music]
[1:27:37] holy
[1:27:40] name.
[1:27:43] For he has done great things.
[1:27:50] He has done great things.
[1:27:56] He has done [singing] great things.
[1:28:01] Bless his holy
[1:28:05] name. He has done.
[1:28:08] Oh, he has done great things. Can you
[1:28:12] testify that? That he's done great
[1:28:15] things in your life for you. great
[1:28:18] [singing] things.
[1:28:21] He has done great things.
[1:28:26] Bless his holy.
[1:28:30] One more time. He has done great things.
[1:28:33] Oh, he has done great things.
[1:28:40] He has done great things.
[1:28:46] He has done great things.
[1:28:51] Bless his holy
[1:28:56] name. Just keep playing that. Could you
[1:28:59] imagine walking on your on your journey
[1:29:02] to do on your way to do your job?
[1:29:05] Moses was on his way taking care of the
[1:29:07] sheep and that burning bush of fire.
[1:29:11] Maybe at a glance he had seen a fire, a
[1:29:13] bush burning before, but something
[1:29:16] catches his attention because it's
[1:29:18] burning, but it's not being consumed.
[1:29:21] But you know, Moses could have said,
[1:29:22] "You know what? I've got sheep to attend
[1:29:24] to. I've got things I need to go do. So,
[1:29:28] we'll just go on and do our job."
[1:29:31] But something called him to that. He
[1:29:33] says, "I've got to go see what that is."
[1:29:38] and he met God in that place. Same with
[1:29:41] me and you. Sometimes God will get our
[1:29:43] attention, but Lord, I'm busy right now.
[1:29:47] I got things I got to do. Take a moment
[1:29:49] and see if he's not wanting to talk with
[1:29:52] you and just bless his holy name.
[1:29:56] Oh, bless the Lord,
[1:30:00] oh my soul,
[1:30:03] and all [singing]
[1:30:05] that is within me. Bless his holy
[1:30:13] name.
[1:30:16] For he has done great things.
[1:30:23] He has done great things. [singing]
[1:30:29] He has done great things.
[1:30:34] Bless his holy
[1:30:39] name. I will serve thee because I love
[1:30:43] thee.
[1:30:44] I will serve
[1:30:47] thee
[1:30:50] [singing] because I love
[1:30:54] thee.
[1:30:56] You have given
[1:31:01] life
[1:31:02] to [singing]
[1:31:04] me.
[1:31:08] And I was [singing] nothing
[1:31:14] before you found me.
[1:31:20] You have given
[1:31:25] life
[1:31:26] to me.
[1:31:32] There were heartaches, [singing]
[1:31:38] broken
[1:31:39] pieces.
[1:31:44] Ruined lies
[1:31:48] are why [singing]
[1:31:50] you
[1:31:51] die [music]
[1:31:53] on Calary.
[1:31:57] And your touch
[1:32:01] was what I long [singing] for.
[1:32:07] You have given
[1:32:12] life
[1:32:13] to. Now sing this song as a [music]
[1:32:16] pledge to him.
[1:32:18] Oh, I will serve thee
[1:32:24] because [singing] I love thee.
[1:32:30] You have given
[1:32:34] life to me.
[1:32:41] Oh, I was nothing
[1:32:46] before you found me.
[1:32:52] You have given
[1:32:56] life to me.
[1:33:04] were [singing] hardached
[1:33:09] and broken piecees.
[1:33:14] Ruined lives
[1:33:18] are [singing] why you
[1:33:22] died
[1:33:23] on Calary.
[1:33:27] And your [singing] touch
[1:33:31] was what I long [singing]
[1:33:34] for.
[1:33:37] You have given
[1:33:41] life to me.
[1:33:46] Brother Josiah, you have enough voice to
[1:33:48] come up and pray. Come on. I was glad to
[1:33:52] see him when he walked in because
[1:33:53] brother Dan had said he wasn't feeling
[1:33:55] well.
[1:33:57] Amen. Come on up.
[1:34:01] Thank you.
[1:34:03] Can we all say happy birthday to brother
[1:34:05] Aaron?
[1:34:06] [applause]
[1:34:12] I don't have much of a voice otherwise
[1:34:13] I'd sing it. But let's pray. Lord,
[1:34:16] you've been so good to us. Thank you
[1:34:18] that we have this tabernacle here today
[1:34:20] that we can gather together and worship
[1:34:23] you and read about how it was back in
[1:34:26] the day, Lord. We can only imagine what
[1:34:27] it'd be like to walk, walk into that
[1:34:31] place, Lord, and see the way you
[1:34:33] designed it.
[1:34:35] Thank you, Lord, for brother Lyall, for
[1:34:37] him sacrificing his time and his effort
[1:34:41] to present this to us tonight. I pray
[1:34:42] that you'd bless him, and I pray that
[1:34:44] you bless everyone here tonight, Lord
[1:34:46] Jesus. Pray tonight everyone would walk
[1:34:49] out those doors better Christians than
[1:34:50] when we came in. Thank you for this
[1:34:53] service, Lord. Give you our hearts
[1:34:56] tonight. Ask that you'd keep everyone
[1:34:58] safe on the drive home in Jesus name.
[1:35:00] Amen.
[1:35:04] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[1:35:07] the Lord. It's
[1:35:10] He's so good to us. Sometimes we wonder
[1:35:13] why. We ask him why, Lord.
[1:35:17] And sometimes he doesn't say nothing. He
[1:35:19] just asks you to trust me. Keep walking.
[1:35:22] Keep going. There's a purpose in this.
[1:35:25] You know, uh if we got answers to
[1:35:28] everything, if we understood everything
[1:35:30] and knew everything, it it wouldn't be a
[1:35:32] walk by faith. It would just, well, I
[1:35:35] know, so I'm going to go. But you know,
[1:35:37] when I get up in the morning, I just
[1:35:39] want to say, Lord, thank you for life.
[1:35:41] guide me, direct me, and and when I make
[1:35:44] a mistake or take a wrong step, because
[1:35:46] I will, Lord, just help me to quickly
[1:35:48] get on the path and keep going the right
[1:35:51] way. Let my life be be something that
[1:35:54] someone could say, "Hey, what is it
[1:35:56] about you? What is it about you?" Just
[1:35:59] like Moses was drawn to that that pillar
[1:36:01] fire. Well, that's a pillar of fire
[1:36:03] living in you. The same one. And it draw
[1:36:06] should draw somebody say, "What is it
[1:36:08] about you?
[1:36:10] I need that. I want that. Amen. You ask
[1:36:13] me why I'm happy and I'll just tell you
[1:36:16] why as we go. My sins are gone. How many
[1:36:18] say amen to that? My sins are gone. Now
[1:36:21] I can go into and meet him. I don't have
[1:36:25] to send the high priest in there to go
[1:36:28] talk with him. He said you can come in
[1:36:30] now.
[1:36:32] You asked me [singing] why I'm happy. So
[1:36:36] I'll just tell you why. recall.
[1:36:41] My sins [music] are gone.
[1:36:45] And when I meet [singing] the [music]
[1:36:47] scoffer who asks me where they are, I
[1:36:52] say
[1:36:53] my sins are gone.
[1:36:57] There underneath the blood on the cross
[1:37:01] of Calvary.
[1:37:03] As far removed as [music] darkness is
[1:37:06] from dawn
[1:37:09] in the sea [music] of God's
[1:37:11] forgetfulness.
[1:37:13] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[1:37:17] [singing and music]
[1:37:18] My sins are gone.
[1:37:22] was at the old time [singing] altar
[1:37:25] where God came in my heart and now
[1:37:31] my sins are gone.
[1:37:34] The Lord took full possession.
[1:37:37] [music and singing] The devil did
[1:37:39] depart. I'm glad
[1:37:43] my sins are gone.
[1:37:47] There underneath the [music] blood on
[1:37:50] the cross of Calvary
[1:37:53] as far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[1:37:59] In the sea of [music and singing] God's
[1:38:01] forgetfulness, that's good enough for
[1:38:04] me. Praise God, [singing]
[1:38:08] my sins are gone.
[1:38:12] was at the old time altar [singing]
[1:38:15] where God came in my heart and now
[1:38:20] my sins are gone.
[1:38:24] The Lord took full possession [singing]
[1:38:27] the devil did before. I'm glad
[1:38:33] my sins are gone.
[1:38:36] They're underneath [singing and music]
[1:38:38] the blood on the cross of Calvary.
[1:38:43] As far removed as darkness is from dawn
[1:38:47] [music and singing]
[1:38:49] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:38:52] That's good enough for me. Praise
[1:38:55] [music] God. [singing]
[1:38:57] My sins are gone.
[1:39:01] When Satan comes to tempt me and tries
[1:39:05] [music and singing] to make me, I say
[1:39:10] my sins are gone.
[1:39:13] You got me into trouble, but Jesus
[1:39:17] [music] got me out. I'm glad
[1:39:22] my [music] sins are gone.
[1:39:25] There underneath the blood [singing]
[1:39:29] on the cross of Calvary.
[1:39:32] As far [music] removed as darkness is
[1:39:35] from dawn [singing]
[1:39:38] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:39:41] [music and singing] That's good enough
[1:39:43] for me. Praise God.
[1:39:47] My sins are gone.
[1:39:50] I'm living [singing and music] now for
[1:39:52] Jesus. I'm happy night and day because
[1:39:57] [singing]
[1:39:59] my sins are gone.
[1:40:02] My soul is filled with music with all my
[1:40:07] heart. I say, I know
[1:40:11] my sins [music] are gone.
[1:40:15] There underneath the blood on the
[1:40:18] [music and singing] cross of Calvary.
[1:40:21] as far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[1:40:27] In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[1:40:30] [music and singing] that's good enough
[1:40:32] for me. Praise God.
[1:40:36] My sins are gone.
[1:40:40] You can keep playing that, but God bless
[1:40:42] you. God with you. You know he will.
[1:40:48] You just make sure in the morning you
[1:40:50] talk with him. Make sure during the day
[1:40:52] you talk with him. Make sure in the
[1:40:54] evening you talk with him. He's not one
[1:40:57] of those, well, you know, I'll talk to
[1:40:59] him when I got time. There should always
[1:41:01] be time. He's willing to come. So, God
[1:41:04] bless you as you go there underneath
[1:41:07] your [music] blood on the cross of
[1:41:10] Calvary.
[1:41:11] As far [music and singing] removed as
[1:41:13] darkness is from dawn
[1:41:17] in the sea of God's [singing]
[1:41:19] forgetfulness. That's good enough
[1:41:21] [music] for me. Praise God. [singing]
[1:41:27] I'm living now for Jesus. I'm living now
[1:41:30] [singing and music] for Jesus. I'm happy
[1:41:34] night and day because
[1:41:38] my sins are gone.
[1:41:41] My soul is filled with music. With all
[1:41:45] my heart I say, I know
[1:41:50] my sins are gone.
[1:41:53] There are
[1:42:06] Heat. Heat.
