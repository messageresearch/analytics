all israel amen and maybe for brother david when you actually turn the plane off and you've landed and it's down okay and you can breathe but in god he's our refuge just a couple of announcements just reminders this coming sunday lord willing brother joe adams will be with us both services and this thursday friday and saturday from 6 to 8 p.m here at the tabernacle it's open for prayer and that's all it's going to be just a prayer time open at six and i'm talking with brother jordan he said if someone's still praying at 8 30 we'll still be here it's not going to say hey you got to get up it's six o'clock you're done or eight o'clock whatever the lord leads and we'll always have at least two folks two brothers brother and sister so that they don't end up with somebody alone a brother and sister alone here and be a little uncomfortable but take your burdens to the lord come and talk with him let him answer back to you he is faithful to do that now brother dan evans i spoke with him on tuesday this past week he was coming back from jeffersonville and i called him early and he didn't answer and he realized he was on flying back home then but he talked in the afternoon and he said brother aaron even if you asked me to minister this wednesday i'm so tired i couldn't so we had asked brother lyle and then today he was going to be in flagstaff ministering a flash flagship tabernacle with brother steve robson in the church up there and this coming wednesday he'll be ministering for brother osorio from jerusalem tabernacle here in town they've been invited to him and he's gone out i spoke with brother robert figueroa because he's been in my heart to have a minister but him and sister dahlia have been struggling in their health some sister delia they thought she might have had bronchitis they took her into the hospital or the emergency and she was didn't have bronchitis but not doing well and was being brother robert yesterday and he didn't have much of a voice and he said tell the saints that i'm not ignoring them or in any way don't want to be there he said just it's been physically hard in there they've moved out of their house and they moved into with their daughter betting son-in-law brother jude they're in the property and they're staying in the little apartment place that they have there while they prepare their house being paid and clean up they're going to sell it move closer to tucson be on this side a little closer and it's been a lot of work for them so he just said remember them in prayer and we told him we would do the acting see the lord would strengthen them and they're staying in the apartment there or the house i'm not sure exactly what they call it but it's where ruth was living at the end and he said the memories have been hard to deal with so he said just keep us in prayer and until you've gone through that you really don't know what it is but we can keep them in prayer and we can say lord comfort them strengthen them and i told them we would do that so [Music] trust in the lord to lead us along to go with us to guide our steps so we would let him have his way and this evening brother peter mcfadden's with us and i've i had asked him the other day and he's got a young family and busy and they're doing work at the house and it's quite busy at the time but he said if the lord will give me something we'll plan on sunday evening he called me yesterday afternoon he said the lord laid something on my heart so we can do that so if you'll stand with me and see what the lord has for us if you have a need god knows it and he take and take a minister and i've heard it many times from different ministers they said i had this and this and god pulled me this way and took me that way because somebody out there had a need and go administered so there's a song i was thinking the longer i serve him the sweeter he grows you know how how it is as as you get to know or enjoy something and you would think you would get tired of it but if you love it you enjoy it you don't get tired of it [Music] the more that i love him more love each day [Music] the longer i serve him [Music] the sweeter the more that i [Music] my heart oh the longer i serve him the sweeter he goes sing i love him [Music] i love him i love him [Music] because he first love me and purchased my salvation [Music] god bless you it's good to see everybody here let's just pray father we're here trusting in you lord if this was just me to speak lord i wouldn't even come and these people they wouldn't come for that lord they've come to hear from you lord your words are the words of life they're healing words lord their their words of wisdom and truth and their light that we need to guide our footsteps today and in the morning when we wake up so father i pray that you would take total control total preeminence of this service lord and shut my mouth from saying any thing that's not of you lord i pray that you would anoint my lips anoint the ears of the hearers and father let us just sit at your feet and learn of you [Music] that you bless us lord with your presence open this book that only you can open pray lord believing that we can have what we've asked for we're asked according to your word give you thanks for it lord in jesus name amen all right somebody's being loud in church i don't know who that is it could be oh it's my son nevermind all right let's let's turn to the book of daniel chapter five thank you musicians appreciate our musicians daniel chapter 5. we know there's i'm gonna be speaking a little bit about current events it's an interesting time and we know there's two books that are really helpful when you're looking at current events or daniel and revelation so we're going to read a little bit of each of those this is daniel chapter 5 and verse 25. and this is the writing that was written many many tackle eufarsen and this is the interpretation of the thing many god hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it tackle our weed in the balances and are found wanting perez thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians and then let's skip down to verse 30 and we'll read 31 in that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain and darius the median took the kingdom being about three score and two years old and now while you're standing let's go to revelation chapter 11 and we'll read the 15th verse and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever amen you may be seated give your feet some rest this is um i don't know if this is part two of two but this is the the second installation in a short or long series on feet so last time i spoke about feet and tonight i want to speak some more about feet and current events so don't think i'm too strange it's in the bible so it's it's good for instruction and encouragement and correction amen and we all have feet so might as well just stone up to it okay so current events are interesting right now i don't know different people are engaged to different degrees some people look maybe [Music] a lot at that some people look a little but unless you've been living under a rock you probably know there's there's war and rumor of war and conflict and over in ukraine especially there's there's this fighting and um it's especially interesting to us this war because there's always these these wars and things and some people say well why why doesn't everyone get all um pay as much attention when there's a war in africa or and part of asia or something well this this conflict is especially interesting to us because we've been told to watch russia and so when when russia does something now we know things are interesting something's going on and um so what's happening you could you could ask that to a lot of different people and you maybe get a lot of different answers and you could ask that to different preachers and you get different um different answers to that probably a lot of correct ways that you could answer that from different perspectives what's going on but i think that the [Music] one way to answer that question of what's going on is this world is falling apart i think that that's kind of a short way to answer it and there's a sermon that brother branham preached entitled that this world is falling apart and so i was listening to that and i got a lot of um encouragement out of that and so if you want to when you go home and listen to that i think you would be blessed by it but it's like the the song that my friend john borland sang he got up and he's saying this world is in trouble and we really do need you and i believe that i believe this world is in trouble and we really do need the lord but i want to talk about current events and sometimes you like you kick back and you're like well that's that's across the world um what about me and and this monday that's coming but i want to i want to kind of bring it down home and talk about this world is in trouble if i get away from the leading of the lord and and these things that you can read in daniel in revelation they make sense of of the whole world but then also they can make sense of this world that there's a there's a major application of it in a minor application and sometimes the minor application because it's personalized can be very meaningful to the individual to myself and so i want to say i really do need you lord in in this age that part of the anointing for this age is this spirit that says i don't need anything i'm rich but there's a people that are hearing this word they're hearing this voice that's saying come out of her my people and there's a people that are have their eyes opened to what's going on and they realize when your eyes are open you realize that you really do need the lord that you really do need the spirit of the lord to survive in in this day of current events um you know there's all this economic trouble and unrest within the country and unrest outside but god has always made a way for his people and that's that's one of the great things that we see in the book of daniel see it's it's this pair right there's the book of daniel and the book of revelation and they talk a lot about the same things you can find the same beasts and horns and powers and a lot of it is a little bit difficult to understand because it's in types and shadows and now we have we're blessed that we had a prophet that could unpack a lot of this to us but still a lot of times it's kind of hard just reading you know the second half of daniel and revelation it's kind of hard to say okay well what does that mean for me and the lord the lord will show it to us so we don't just give up on it and say well uh i'm not even gonna try if we'll seek the lord he'll open that to us but also what's really nice is that daniel is split into two hats if you look at the book of daniel and it's actually i found out read and written originally in two different languages so it's written in aramaic and hebrew and and there's kind of this um multiple aspects to the book of daniel and what's really nice is that the best kind of textbooks they'll give you the theory and then they'll give you some practical examples say okay here's here's the big picture here's what's going on now here's what this looks like in practice in application and that's kind of what is go to me that's kind of what's going on in the book of daniel is you've got the first half about of daniel are these beautiful and simple stories that even our children can can understand daniel in the fiery furnace and they're not danging on the fire furnace but she had cracked me shack and a bend to go in the fiery furnace and daniel and the lion's den and i'm so thankful for those stories because what we're finding out looking at these these prophecies and daniel in revelation is the the powers of the earth and and this this system of man and this um big image that started in babylon and and weaves all through history but then we see examples in these stories of how individuals just like you and me can overcome living in babylon and i thank the lord for that because i believe that there in this last day i believe there's going to be an overcoming people by the by the blood of the lamb by the word of their testimony and i so want to be part of that within me there is a desire there to be part of that and and so i'm so happy for these examples that show that to live and overcome in life it's not necessarily understanding everything but it's being obedient to the things that you do understand and overcoming can be as simple as choosing not to eat the king's dainties choosing your diet the things that you consume in your body and your mind maybe that that can be a way to overcome that just refusing to worship in a way that everyone else is worshiping that can be overcoming that praying directly and only to god with no mediator other than christ jesus that that can be overcoming i'm so thankful for these these simple stories that we have so we what kind of sparked me to think about this i was talking to a man just came came by to do some work at my house and we just got talking about things and so of course you make make some joke about world war iii because that's what you do these days and um and ish we shouldn't joke about that i'm that's uh that's my american spirit showing itself that that frivolous spirit but uh i believe the lord will help me with that but i made a joke and and so we were talking about things and he mentioned um something that he recommended i look at and i actually plagiarized the title of that for the title of my sermon so if you read the title of my sermon it's i'll have to have a citation there and what his what he recommended that i look at was this video by a man and named ray dalio and he's a hedge fund man manager and his video is called principles for dealing with a changing world order kind of an interesting title right um and so i watched it and it's it's like a cartoon kind of thing to promote his book i haven't read his book so i don't know maybe his book is great or not great but it was interesting and it got me thinking and basically what he's trying what his opinion of what's going on right now and this is this is a a new video this is current he mentions covert in the video and things but basically he's looking at the world he's an investor and so he's trying to see what's going to happen next investors are very interested to know the future so they can make money on it and so he's looking okay where have we been where are we now where are we gonna go and so he's looking at history and and the patterns there and what he is talking about is in the title it says a world order and what he's referring to there is that for the last several hundred years the political system of the world has been such that there's usually one dominant power and that goes back all the way to daniel right we see in the times of daniel that around that time was the birthing of this way of global politics where there would be one power that would be above the other powers and what's interesting that this man looking back could see what daniel looking forward could see is that there's these changes in power so you have the um what we had what we read there you know your weight in the balance and found wanting well that was this change in power that you had the the king of the chaldeans and they were the supreme power in the world and then below them you had other powers so you had a certain order of powers you had first place second place third fourth fifth and then on this night that daniel interprets what's written on the wall there's a change in the world order number one is no longer number one and there's a new number one and we've we've seen that throughout history daniel salt looking forward this man ray saw looking backwards and so he he's looking back at it and and this man ray he could say okay back in the 1600s it was the dutch there was this east india trading company and they were really powerful and then they lost their position because the english took over and then britain was ruling the world britain was the major superpower for a long time through the victorian era and then after that around the time of world war ii there was this switch again where the united states there was a change in the world order and then the united states was number one and that's all that we've most of us have known in our lifetimes back around the 40s has been the united states as as number one in the world and what's interesting is people these things take so long to change that everyone just assumes that this is the way it's always going to be that you know because it's been this way since the 40s this is just the way the world is but if you zoom out and you look at the bigger picture you can see that you go through these cycles of of powers being strong and then there's moral corruption and and then powers start to decline and you can kind of see there's signs of these these powers declining before they they decline and before another power takes over you can you can see signs of that and so this man ray is looking okay let's let's look at those signs historically how is the united states doing are we are we strong in our values and our education and our innovation no no no no we're we're on the down uh so this is this is troubling for him because he's got a lot of money in the united states right i don't have that problem i don't have a lot of money in the united states isn't isn't that great um our treasures aren't here on earth the treasures are somewhere else wherever our heart is though so if our hearts here bad news the united states goes goes down your treasures might go down too but so this man ray is looking and so his his way of looking at things is okay the united states is is probably gonna drop out in the next couple years and china looks really strong china's probably gonna take over and china will kind of the way that he's talking about china will be the new world power right and china looks really strong and every time there's a change in the world order people generally die and there's this time of turmoil and power is not usually given up freely it's usually these bad times that cause this change of power and so what this man ray is teaching is basically look out things are about to fall apart the the world is falling apart get your money out of the u.s and figure out something some way to save your wealth and your your skin basically and so okay that's nice parts of that makes sense but let's look in here let's do some fact checking let's um let's see if it's fake news or let's see if if it's right let's see is um does this book say china is going to take over let's see so let's let's start with um before we try to look and see if his predictions are right let's see if his current assessment is right because that's easier right his prediction is kind of china's going to take over because the us is is the dominant world power and the us is slipping and so must be china's next so is it true that the united states is the dominant world power well who is the current world power and you know you could say well christ is is all-powerful and so you could say well christ would be the world power and in a sense that's right because if he wanted to he could do anything but his will and and what he's what his purpose what he's prophesied is not that he is controlling the world in that way he's allowed this world to be under the control of satan and we can look through there in when jesus was on the work on the earth and he was being tempted of satan we can see that satan offered him the kingdoms of the world if he'd fall down and worship him so we could actually see that and then when jesus was was being questioned before his crucifixion he said my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should be not be delivered unto the jews but my kingdom is not from hens and we can see in the book of revelation like we read at the end that there's coming a time after this seventh trumpet there's coming a time when the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our god but that's not happened yet so right now we're living in satan's eden actually and you don't have to go very far to see that's true as as you go outside you don't have to go all the way to ukraine to see that this is not a world that reflects jesus christ being in control but this is a world that reflects a fallen sinful condition this is a world that people are suffering people are dying people are selling each other for a little bit of profit i had a sad thought the other day you see these these homeless people that are in such a pathetic situation and you see that their life is just so ruined a lot of times by drugs and alcohol you think well they did that to themselves they had a choice and maybe part of that's true but in a sense i had the thought these people were sold into slavery by somebody else somebody made a couple bucks selling them their first drugs somebody made a couple bucks selling them their first drink and giving them their first cigarette see we do this to each other the reason that there's these sad broken lives is because of the evil that's in man's hearts that would know that that's going to happen to a man to a woman to a family but a couple bucks is worth more to them than say no i'm not gonna sell that tobacco that liquor what evil we see in this world in that that this world is being controlled by the devil but that's been allowed of god because he wants to show his attributes right in this great drama this great story of redemption what kind of overcomers would it be to overcome in the garden of eden oh well you know a tree fell the other day and i just spoke to it and it moved out of the way so i overcame that problem and some of the animals were fighting so i just went and talked to them and worked it out that wouldn't be much of an overcoming but what god wanted to show is that this little seed that he's put in our hearts this little bit of himself like he showed in in the hebrew children it wouldn't bend it wouldn't break it wouldn't burn it would overcome even in the worst of the worst he even took that same seed and he put it down in hell and rose up triumphant it'll do the same thing in this hell that's around us it'll overcome there's got to be something for the overcomer to overcome and so we've uh we must fight if we must win but let's let's keep fighting so we know that zooming out that this world is not directly the united states is not directly in control because this is satan's kingdom but satan is powerless except moving through men we talk about we're we're the hands and the feet of jesus right sermon last one and there's other people that are the hands and the feet of satan and they're they're the way that this evil is worked in the world and so looking now in this vision of dan in this dream of daniel you're familiar with the story i think if we go back and there's this king nebuchadnezzar he had a dream and he forgot it and he um he told the wise men you're going to die unless one of you tells me the dream and interprets it and they couldn't do it but daniel could and so he tells the king the dream and this is like one of the one of the major dreams of all time because it tells the whole gentile dispensation and it's this image of a man and there's this head and shoulders of gold and it goes down to brass and iron i miss silver there's gold and then silver and then brass and then iron and the fourth one is iron mixed with clay right so we want to fact check this this man ray and he says whatever was going on right now the united states is going down and then china's coming up well just counting the numbers i already have suspicions because we've been told that right now we're already in this time of iron and clay right that's where we're at right now we had a vindicated prophet tell us that so i don't need to second guess that i can check it with the word and see that it's true but i'm i'm convinced that that's where we're at and i look at the number that's four out of four there's not a fifth world power this um doesn't say and he's wearing this this man is wearing chinese flip-flops no that it's just four kingdoms so we don't see that lining up with with what's in the word and we can look at what brother brother branham says and he says in the greatest battle ever fought he says see don't worry about russia see we're looking at russia and china are they going to join together and are they the next superpower together he says si don't worry about russia russia is a small pebble on the beach don't you worry about communism you watch romanism when it's united with the churches there's nothing written in the scripture about communism ruling the world and i go by the word regardless of what any thing else goes it's the word i believe it's romanism that takes the world right so we've been living in this roman age we know that that that goes all the way back to this when rome took over the world we can see all through history it's been this roman spirit that's been controlling and this goes down you can look at those two legs as um there was this great split of the roman church back a thousand years ago and they split into the the roman catholic church in the orthodox church so that could be the two legs or brother branham talks about protestantism and catholicism being the two legs there but you see it's broken down into all these different toes these ten toes and there's all these these little churches but basically you can see that what's controlling the world the power that's controlling the world it's not the united states but it's this roman spirit that's in the form of many toes and it's in the form of iron and clay it's in the form of things that are not mixed together and it's ready to fall apart so if we're if we're getting ready to deal with the changing world order we're not going to go put all our money in china or russia we're going to say oh this whole thing is about ready to collapse because the next thing that happens once you get down where we're at to these toes this mix of iron and clay the next thing that happens is this stone that's cut without hands and comes and smites these feet and breaks it to pieces and um but let's let's just read in daniel 2 let's read 31 to 35. let's read this this is important it says thou o king saw us this is daniel telling him the vision the dream thou o king solaced and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible the image's head was a fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands and smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken in pieces together and become like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth and then let's drop down to verse 44 and see it says and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever so that's what happens next we don't have to guess and say okay what's it going to be this world is falling apart and the next world order is an everlasting world order it's one that's not going to last 250 years and fade out it's not one that's going to start out real good gold and then by the time it gets the end it's these nasty clay and iron feet no this is a perfect kingdom this is the kingdom of christ so we have good news is that you never know are you going from a when everything switches up are you going to be better or worse at the end of the switch-up well you've got to be on the right side but as long as you're on the right side this is the best change in world order the world has ever seen see when god comes and brings order it's a beautiful thing you can think he's been foreshadowing this all the way back in genesis when the earth was without form and void darkness was upon the face of the deep there was no order there was disarray just like was in this world that was in trouble but then when the spirit of god moves starts to separate the light the darkness the land from the water starts to bring life and if if this beautiful creation that we see is god bringing order before and he says that having seen this we can't even fathom what's next it's going to be something awesome it's going to be something beautiful and this stone that's breaking this system of the world to pieces this stone is is a living stone the stone is christ he's the stone that the builders rejected has become the head of the coroner it says in in matthew 21 and 42 to 44 jesus saith unto them have you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore i say unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder so there's two options there's people that fall on this stone and they're broken but they're not destroyed and there's there's others that don't fall on this stone and they're broken to powder so let's let's see how we can prepare for this changing world order what's the what's the personal application of this what what can i do well if things are changing [Music] god always provides a way for his people though what's coming is everything falling apart in in a previous time when everything was falling apart the flood god provided an ark there's a way of safety but we always we overlook things a lot of times that god's doing because he does them simply his ways are are so simple that they're they're hidden the wise and the prudent and a lot of times the we know that what we've been given is god's word to hide behind that's our fortress that's our safe place and we know that this word is powerful but what we see a lot of times just like jesus said is that our tendency as humans is to make the word of god of no effect by our traditions and like like matthew 15 9 says but in vain do they worship me they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so what are our traditions do we see this word show in power in our life or has it become ineffective because we've fallen for this spirit that's ruling the world so what you'll hear if you take my recommendation and listen to this sermon the world is falling apart is brother branham doesn't spend a lot of time talking about world politics and it doesn't say what part of the country to get to and how to stock up canned beans and water he doesn't spend his time on that but what he talks about is what jesus was talking about is that word effective in your life is this gospel that you've received this way of escape is it doing what it's supposed to in your life because we could see this what this roman system is that rules the world is it something that mixes ideas of man with the word of god it mixes in traditions and paganism and it kills the power and that spirit it's not the united states it's not just in russia and it's not just in china it's so pervasive it's moving trying to get into every church trying to get into every home trying to get into every heart trying to kill the power but just like the three hebrew children just like daniel there's gonna be overcomers in this day there's gonna be a people that they don't understand everything they can't explain everything they don't they can't tell you what every verse in daniel in revelation means maybe but they believe it and they don't mix it and they're ahead of their time in that they're already living in that next world order in this this world that's in trouble that system that's coming down is still the major power that's still number one out there but in here can be different for you that stone can be effective to tear every idea of man down in your life to break all that to power powder and in in your heart and in your life the kingdoms of this world can already become the kingdoms of our christ so brother branham his whole ministry come out of her my people be not partakers of our sins he's not talking to people necessarily to say come out of the roman catholic church he did but that's not his main audience he's talking to pentecostals and if he was still here he'd be talking to us to say watch out for that power that lying roman spirit that mixes in ideas of men that tries to look so good to the mind that looks you know it's golden up here this system man golden up here seems so good to the mind but the practical application of it the feet where the rubber hits the road is corrupt it's brittle it's weak see the devil can make a good mental deception but he can't walk this walk he can't have the feet that we talked about last sermon that carry the gospel that proclaimed good news by the way that we live that we've become this we've eaten this we speak this that's what the devil is fighting the battle is not in ukraine greatest battles were fought it's right here it's in a in our minds in our hearts so what brother branham is preaching against he's preaching against the things that we deal with on a personal level when he preaches this world is falling apart he preaches against sin he preaches against worldliness not because not because your salvation is dependent on whether you smoke a cigarette but because your life tells whether this word has been made of no effect through your traditions because this original word if it's not mixed you won't be living like the world you won't have the same appetite to eat the king's dainties you'll say no i've got a different food that i'm feeding on it won't make your worship the same cold dead worship and don't just think singing songs think of the worship of how you act when you're all alone what you think what are you meditating on is is that a true worship or are the meditations of your hearts worshiping the same image that this world has of somebody kicked back retired early easy life what are the meditations of our hearts are they worship to god are they pure or have we can been caught up with all this music the sound of all these instruments in the in in that sermon brother branham says we want everything just everything so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy he says life wasn't intended to be easy life is a struggle anything that's got life is a struggling look at the trees how they struggle look at everything that's got life it's a struggle and when we try to get some kind of a system that takes it easy then we're wrong and we know there's something wrong so when he's preaching against the world falling apart he's preaching against these spirits these lies that come in and try to mix mix the spirits of this world the spirits of babylon into the christians lives we're not to be conformed to the image of this world or to be transformed or to have a new mind the mind of christ jesus where to be different would it be peculiar we're the only ones eating oatmeal and everyone else is eating babylonian things he see when he preaches against sin he preaches against you know makeup and cutting hair and i believe that but he also preaches against weak preaching you know this kind of preaching that tells you oh everything's okay never preaches against sin god help us god help us not to compromise with this word because we can we can fall to that even within the message that it's easy to preach only part of the word but we want the whole counsel of god i want to come to church and i want to know when i'm wrong i want to have that knife of the word cut away this this sin for me these where this babylonian spirit's trying to grow into my heart cut that away if you only come to church and and leave more puffed up something's wrong but what should be made magnified is christ the cross the blood that's what should be magnified in our lives when we leave church that we don't look to ourselves but we just look to that sacrifice anything else see on either side the devil try to pull you either to look at yourself so much and to be so legalistic and to be so just trying to do trying to save yourself and that's a lie or on the other side he'll try to just tell you well god loves you it doesn't matter what you do no sin sin that's a lie too see the truth is i can't do anything to live a holy life but if i'll let that life of christ live in me and if i won't mix anything with that but if i just let that original power come through that will kill sin in my life that will let me rise up above the world and so we don't look at our at these things of sin as the final you know that's all we're looking at but we look at those of markers to see what kind of fruits are our lives bearing have we been made unfruitful every vine that bears not fruit is cut off and thrown in the fire that original life will bring forth the original fruit in luke 6 26 jesus says woe unto you when all men speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets and you know what i'm what i'm talking about here it was inspired by what by what brother branham said about preaching how are we preaching this are we preaching easy are we preaching the full thing but what you hear in church is not just the responsibility of whoever is here because what can happen is you know brother aaron can preach the whole gospel but if your ears are only open to hear selectively you're going to get weak preaching even if it's real holy ghost preaching you can dilute it yourself can dilute it in the way you live you can come here and you can say amen then you go home and you compromise you mix it and now you're the weak preacher you're the one that's mixed the word you said amen to it in church and i'm preaching to myself here god help me but we can be weak preachers in the way that we're walking around as those feet let's not mix this word let's just take it and say lord help me i can't live this but oh there was a price paid for me at calvary i believe in that transfusion of power i believe in that holy ghost baptism anything outside of that romanism it's cursed it's dead and it's coming down that's crumbling but let that be crumbled totally in my life let this rock cut out without hands let it just destroy every bit of that in me that i can be already in that next world order where there's a mountain a mountain of god this this mountain made me think of the statue of a perfect man that's got a wide base of faith and it's built up all the way up to perfect love we can live there we don't have to you know we're we're in babylon just like shadrach meshach and abednego they even got babylonian names but they were in babylon babylon wasn't in them that's the difference it's not the water around the boat that's the problem it's the water in the boat see before them there were people in jerusalem the holiest of cities living [Music] really good lives they had babylon in here and that's why they were scattered that's why they became slaves that's why their their sons and daughters were taken they let it in here though they were in the right place you know you can be in church you can let babylon get in here you can let that worldly system come in here and it's death but oh there's still that rock i could take that down if we just say lord have mercy on me oh lord this world is in trouble this world and we really do need you but the great thing is when christ has come and destroyed the works of the devil that's why he came didn't he say that he came to destroy the works of the devil not just out there but in in here that's where i really want him to destroy the works of the devil well once he comes and does that once we'll fully surrender as brother arnie says that's when he'll fully fill us amen and we can read in daniel in revelation that there's this terrible mark of the beast but there's a protection against that in these current events where the world's falling apart there's death everywhere and more death coming there's a place of perfect peace that once you've fully surrendered once you've said lord i don't want any systems of this man of my own thoughts of my own image of what a christian life should look like see it's very religious it's not just you know worldly roman catholic catholicism but it's it's peter mcfadden's idea of a perfect christian life that's death i don't want my idea of a perfect christian life but once once we can get rid of that once we can say lord i don't want my ideas i want your word i want your spirit i want to be fully surrendered once that's been torn down and once that mountain of righteousness has taken its place it says you're sealed until the day of your redemption that now though you're still in babylon the world is still falling apart all around you you're set your salvation you've received the earnest you've got the down payment we've got a god that's going to finish the good work that he started and we ought to be so happy over there we ought to dance like miriam when she crossed the red sea oh thank you thank you lord for saving me once i was lost now i'm found amen don't let the devil steal that joy from you but also in that same scripture where it says we're sealed it says grieve not the holy ghost so let's while we rejoice in this salvation let's still keep an eye out for anywhere that that spirit's trying to to come it can't steal your salvation but it can hurt your testimony it can it can grieve the lord you know shadrach meshach and abednego they would have still been jews if they were eating the king's dainties but they were blessed for what they did they received wisdom they overcame i believe there's i believe we're part of that people that's not just gonna survive this but we're gonna overcome we're gonna live above this not by figuring it out but just by his grace by his blood because he chose to do this so let's just keep saying lord open my ears that when i hear the word i won't water it down i won't make excuses in the choices that i make and when i come into the presence of god i won't leave puffed up but i'll leave say woe is me i've sinned i don't want to be this way holy ghost preaching it pricks our hearts not tickles our ears says oh i can i can surrender another part of my life i've let something come in i've let the world come in about something start to make me a one of those fountains that's sometimes giving bitter water and sometimes sweet don't let our speech be like that don't fall for that trick of the devil see holy ghost preaching it doesn't bind you with burdens but it sets you free it says i don't have to live like that i don't have to talk about my brother and my sister that way but i can love them and i can talk good things about them and just stay stay straight that all our confidence is in christ all our confidence is in calvary and then we can we can prophesy again we can speak that same pure word we can be a blessing to those around us amen when we when we live this way we separate ourselves from the world it says in james that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world as the enemy of god so if we're really hearing that really taking this word it's going to separate us it's going to make us different notice it didn't make them hated for good reason they didn't hate daniel because he was bad at his job and lazy they hated him because he prayed so if the world hates you because you're not doing good you know the bible talks about that that's that's not the way it should be but just carry on we're not of that world order we're of a different world order brother branham in the sermon he talks about yes the lady are you a christian she said i burn a candle every night and that sounds so silly to us who would answer the question that way but is that how we kind of answer the question are you a christian well i did go to church three times last week and i tried to pray three times a day and i did listen to tape it's romanism friend not gonna get to heaven by how many tapes you listen to we should be listening to the tapes but keep your eyes on calvary keep your heart in love with him be transformed by the renewing of your mind i believe the coming of the lord is at hand that's um i've got a lot of notes but i feel like we're maybe towards the end here if musicians would come let's let's go to let's go to romans chapter eight verse nine i want to end with that the other thing that came to my mind is we want to want to see the supernatural we want to have all the promises of god moving as they should and when they'd come to brother branham they'd say why are you hollering against sin why don't you teach these these people how to see visions and be real spiritual you know he'd tell them how can the spirit teach us algebra if we won't learn our abcs i believe if we'll just be obedient to what we've what we know to do who's right if we'll just surrender and let the lord tear down everything that's of that other world order that we'll see the prophesy and we'll see the wonders the signs because obedience is better than sacrifice let's um romans chapter 9 8 verse 9 and we'll read down to 17. romans chapter 8 verse verse 9 says but you're not in the flesh the systems of man but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of god he is none of his see we need to be very sure we need to make our call in an election sure once once you've been sealed you're sealed don't let the devil shake you from that but if you let a man talk you into oh i'm saved i've got the holy ghost then another man can talk you out and you're always going to be in one way out the other day back and forth but you settle that with god make sure and then once once you've gone and and worked that out if you just um maybe play jesus be the lord of all the kingdoms of my heart make sure make sure you've got that oil in your lamp everything's falling apart it's not a time to just live haphazardly make sure that what's what's being manifest in your life shows that that the spirit of god is moving in your life it says if if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh these systems of men for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit that's the key through the spirit you mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live there's a way of escape there's safety now this verse 14 is is really important it says for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god that's what we need we'll say this world is in trouble i really do need you that's how i need him i need him as lord like brother lyle preached jesus is lord i need my life to preach that by the way of these feet walk by the things these hands do by the meditations here let it all be led by the spirit of god because that's how sons are verse 15 says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage begin to fear fear not little flock amen but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father [Music] the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children than heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him then we may also be also glorified together amen so his spirit in us it's leading us it's bringing us to adoption to that place that the power of god is able to operate through us if we'll just surrender so just let go of all our ideas of how this ought to be done all our best intentioned ideas it's all romanism that's what's ruling out there well let's skip into that next world order [Music] where these kingdoms have become the kingdoms of our god i was thinking of that we started out with about being weighed in the balance and found wanting and when we really start to hear that our ears can be anointed to hear this word we can be pricked in our hearts that we can be convicted i can say oh i'm wanting when i when i add up my life when i count up my life it says you've been numbered that's the first part many is you've been numbered second part is you've been weighed third part is division you've been divided [Music] and i thought the only thing that can balance that balance that can bring me to where i need to be that i wouldn't be found wanting the only thing that can balance that scale is that rock that living christ that spirit of god oh i really do need him amen but he's here he's never left us it says we haven't received the spirit of bondage again to fear this word that comes doesn't come to put you in terror and put you in chains find heavy burdens on you that you can't carry it comes to say son daughter you're free go bearing that blood the two doves the one killed his blood is sprinkled on the other one that's us we can just go it's not my blood it is it's not my righteousness it's his it's not my life it's his let's just stand and bow our heads and my head bowed to if there's anybody here that's maybe been convicted [Music] and would just say in their heart this world myself i'm in trouble lord and i really do need you just lift your hand to him i'm not looking don't be looking around but just raise your hand to him and say lord help me god come and tear down these systems of man let me worship you in spirit and in truth oh god we're here [Music] believing that you help us believing that you've made a way of salvation lord a way that we can not just be saved but that we can overcome at these feet that used to walk in sin and used to be bound in chains that these feet would walk out on the ashes of the wicked here in our own lives lord that i could walk out on the ashes of the sins in my own life i could live above that lord that your holy fire would just come and purify my life in the lives of these people lord that we wouldn't sin against you that we wouldn't grieve your spirit lord but seal us all father help us to be totally empty of our own thoughts lord of our own righteousness of our own ways lord and would you just come and help us i'll have mercy on us lord we know you have you know father that [Music] you longed to fill us more than we could even desire to be filled so lord open our eyes that we can see what we need to do to follow after you to be obedient do you open our ears that we can hear you leading us lord we believe your word that as we're led by you or even your sons and lord [Music] we can't be proud in that because we know that we had nothing to do with that was just your mercy on us lord that you chose us in you before the foundation of the world it's your god [Music] father you're above every power of the world you're above all the powers of satan of every kingdom of this world and one day we know that you're gonna rule and reign father that your kingdom is a kingdom everlasting without any end father let that kingdom come let that will be done here in this earth in each one of our hearts this week lord help us to walk a little closer to you father to love you a little bit more to be a little more surrendered to you father that day by day we could draw near to you father we know that it's your spirit drawing that we can't even walk towards you without you pulling on us lord so thank you for pulling on us give us love one for another father help us to be tender and sweet and loving for one another lord to preach your true gospel lord by the lives that we live pray father and give you thanks in jesus name amen oh jesus be hello jesus be the lord of all [Music] jesus be the lord of all the kingdoms [Music] my heart but here's where it is jesus i ser under all oh jesus i surrender lord help us oh jesus i [Music] surrender all [Music] the kingdoms of my heart jesus be one more time as a brother aaron comes oh jesus be the lord of all jesus jesus [Music] for if you're not lord of everything then you're not lord at all oh jesus i sure [Music] jesus [Music] my i asked brother peter to stay up here someone would desire prayer someone say sometimes somebody just praying with us helps us brother peter would do that god gave him the inspiration to minister this god can use him to inspire to encourage someone because all of us at times have come to a place where he said oh lord i need your help a hard time search me oh god and know my heart today [Music] search me oh [Music] know my thoughts i [Music] somewhere [Music] from [Music] and [Music] comes from [Music] that [Music] claims [Music] our blessings sir me [Music] know my god [Music] from every sin and through [Music] through the blood jesus christ [Music] through [Music]

as you can make it right say forgive me say i'm sorry don't let the roots of it linger and down get down inside so much harder to undo it then but as quick as as you can lord forgive me i'm sorry and he does and the peace of god then settles in your heart and you can travel you can go on because this world's not our home we're just passing through we're just going through don't don't let that hold you don't let it anchor you you know and and and we're all at times saying oh lord if i had a little bit of more of this i just had a little better finances by just trying to make ourselves a little more comfortable here but lord let us just look to you above all things let's pray lord i don't think there's a one of us here today that examine ourselves closely and say lord i fell short here i need some help here lord i'm a little weak on this side i failed you there lord but you come and said hey there's a way to be restored i'll draw you back to myself just confess and say i'm sorry and let me come in and minister the peace or through the blood to the very shed blood lord you can draw us the very life of it coming to live in the believer lord and giving us that overcoming power today help us i pray in jesus christ's name amen thank you brother peter when i talked to him yesterday afternoon he said i'm not too sure i don't know if i have anything yet but i'll pray to the lord and i
