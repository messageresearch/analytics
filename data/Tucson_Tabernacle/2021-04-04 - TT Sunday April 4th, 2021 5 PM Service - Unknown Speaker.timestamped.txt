[58:01] bless you and
[58:02] i want to thank all the people that did
[58:04] all the work to make this possible
[58:06] i know brother jordan said he had 32
[58:08] hours in this week
[58:09] amen just getting ready trying to stay
[58:11] up with me i feel bad sometimes i feel
[58:14] like i'm wearing everybody out but
[58:16] hey man i appreciate our musicians i
[58:17] wonder if we could give them a handclap
[58:22] amen and all the singers everybody that
[58:24] sing
[58:25] sang and all that they did and
[58:27] appreciate william flying out here to be
[58:29] with us in the meeting and
[58:30] he's my son by the way
[58:34] somebody asked me about that said dude i
[58:36] said no that's william my son i
[58:37] appreciate my brother john
[58:39] he's my little brother
[58:42] hey man i appreciate john
[58:45] hey man brother john sister sharon she's
[58:47] a wonderful person if you haven't got to
[58:49] shake sister sharon's hand shake her
[58:50] hand she's a
[58:52] saint we call her saint sharon amen
[58:54] she's a wonderful person
[58:56] now the catholics believe you have to
[58:57] die to be a saint
[58:59] but we find out in the book of ephesians
[59:01] paul wrote and said to the saints that
[59:02] are at ephesus
[59:04] so they had to be alive and they had to
[59:05] be able to read his letter so we believe
[59:07] saints can be alive so it's not bad it
[59:09] means a sanctified one right
[59:11] so we ought to be able to look at

[59:41] amen come closer brother up in canada
[59:45] they opened the service

[59:51] who could come and who couldn't they had
[59:52] one service then they had a lady
[59:54] official i don't know if it's over the
[59:55] whole country the providence come in and
[59:57] shut the whole thing down
[59:58] done with all the churches and

[1:00:01] know what could
[1:00:02] a year ago people have oh that won't
[1:00:04] happen in america and then all of a
[1:00:05] sudden it turns and they're telling you
[1:00:06] when you can
[1:00:07] have church and when you can't have
[1:00:08] church if you're going to wear something
[1:00:09] on your face or
[1:00:10] not wear something on your face and you
[1:00:12] know and they were we lived in indiana
[1:00:14] and across the river was kentucky and
[1:00:16] the governors had opposing ideas so the
[1:00:18] laws were all completely different from
[1:00:20] one just driving across the river and so
[1:00:22] i said look just tell me if i got to
[1:00:24] wear a mask or not wear a mask or sit
[1:00:25] six feet apart or what i got to do i
[1:00:27] don't

[1:00:54] through the red sea whatever it is as
[1:00:55] long as he's with us i feel okay about

[1:05:25] jesus loves the little children
[1:05:30] there was a time in the bible there was
[1:05:32] a time in the bible elijah
[1:05:34] when all the adults wanted to find out
[1:05:36] about marriage and divorce and a lot of
[1:05:38] deep things like that and jesus took up
[1:05:41] a little child in his arms
[1:05:44] and said unless we become like one of
[1:05:46] these we're not going to enter in
[1:05:49] amen sometimes we grow up and we get too
[1:05:52] old
[1:05:53] and we forget about little boys like
[1:05:55] elijah

[1:06:10] your daddy
[1:06:11] go back to your daddy back there amen
[1:06:14] and he jumps good too
[1:06:16] amen i think that's important for us to
[1:06:19] to recognize our little children and
[1:06:21] especially those that
[1:06:23] might be needy among us or seem small
[1:06:26] i also wanted to make note of brother
[1:06:28] perry green how many know that
[1:06:30] it was brother perry green that started
[1:06:33] up the phone hookup
[1:06:34] who knows that back in the 60s
[1:06:38] we would have called it like modern
[1:06:40] connection it was something that wasn't
[1:06:42] very popular
[1:06:43] is that right brother and brother perry
[1:06:45] greene
[1:06:46] a younger man in the message
[1:06:50] a younger minister but he wanted to let
[1:06:52] that voice
[1:06:54] go to as many people that desire to be
[1:06:56] connected
[1:06:57] and i just looked in the back study all
[1:06:59] the way back into the 60s and you know
[1:07:01] right up
[1:07:02] through the late 65s there it was
[1:07:05] brother perry green
[1:07:07] that had that kind of a vision today
[1:07:09] we'd say well the internet's horrible
[1:07:11] and it's evil and all of that but
[1:07:13] i still believe there's the voice of the
[1:07:14] bride that there's others that deserve
[1:07:17] to be connected
[1:07:18] and i think what happened right in this
[1:07:20] building of tucson tabernacle
[1:07:23] has just continued on it's a bride's
[1:07:25] revival
[1:07:26] but i wanted to remind you that your
[1:07:27] previous pastor brother perry
[1:07:29] was on the cutting edge and uh of
[1:07:32] technology he just wanted to make that
[1:07:35] available
[1:07:35] and i thank god for that amen sister
[1:07:38] laurie
[1:07:39] and sister melissa wasn't that a
[1:07:41] wonderful song
[1:07:42] i think brother jordan um called uh her
[1:07:45] auntie and cousin i'll just call her
[1:07:48] like my mother and my sister
[1:07:51] we go way back to the into the 90s
[1:07:54] and back in phoenix we knew them the
[1:07:57] snow family from
[1:07:58] way back in the 90s and shared some
[1:08:00] years together in phoenix and then
[1:08:03] and then in cloverdale and in washington
[1:08:04] state here we are again tonight
[1:08:06] and we just thank the lord for that you
[1:08:08] know we're having our easter
[1:08:10] afternoon dinner today and i'm so
[1:08:13] thankful for that
[1:08:15] well i promise you tonight i'm not going
[1:08:17] to be long
[1:08:20] and we're just relaxed and i'm going to
[1:08:21] let you go a little earlier we have a
[1:08:23] baptism tonight brother joseph
[1:08:25] is going to be baptized and so we just
[1:08:27] want to give time for that
[1:08:29] you know there's one thing about having
[1:08:31] the service at five
[1:08:32] and sometimes you leave the morning you
[1:08:34] go eat and then you rush back
[1:08:36] everybody's just kind of ate and all our
[1:08:38] food's kind of settling down
[1:08:39] so let's let's just be strong and finish
[1:08:43] strong
[1:08:45] can we agree if i promise you i'll be
[1:08:47] short
[1:08:48] you promise me that you'll just stick it
[1:08:50] out there and on the edge of your
[1:08:52] seat amen it was a it was on a sunday
[1:08:54] night of easter
[1:08:57] that uh some believers were walking down
[1:08:59] a road
[1:09:00] and all of a sudden someone appeared out
[1:09:02] of the shadows
[1:09:04] and by the time they got done with that
[1:09:06] little walk
[1:09:07] their eyes were open
[1:09:10] and what took a few miles of a walk
[1:09:13] they ran back to jerusalem maybe tonight
[1:09:16] you feel a little sluggish or
[1:09:18] it's been a long weekend and it's been a
[1:09:20] little bit you're tired
[1:09:21] but maybe by the end of tonight you can
[1:09:23] just say god
[1:09:24] you as we heard your word my heart was
[1:09:27] burning within me
[1:09:28] so let's turn to that scripture as we
[1:09:30] stand together luke chapter 24.
[1:09:35] i wanted to thank the trustees of tucson
[1:09:37] tabernacle and the elders that
[1:09:40] allowed my wife and i to come this
[1:09:42] weekend and also for the room that you
[1:09:44] provided and
[1:09:45] the meals that you've provided and so
[1:09:48] we haven't had a lot of time to be able
[1:09:50] to see you because we've just been
[1:09:52] preparing but after the service and when
[1:09:54] our little fellowship there's a little
[1:09:55] fellowship tonight right
[1:09:57] everyone invited maybe we'll get to say
[1:10:00] hi to some of you tonight
[1:10:01] luke chapter 24
[1:10:05] i'm just looking at my time but before
[1:10:08] we read this scripture let's just bow
[1:10:10] our heads and pray
[1:10:12] our dear heavenly father lord you're
[1:10:15] made known in the opening of your word
[1:10:18] sometimes it may be loud sometimes it
[1:10:20] might be quiet but lord
[1:10:22] still waters run deep and i pray on this
[1:10:25] sunday night father on easter sunday
[1:10:28] night that you would step
[1:10:29] out of the shadows step out of the
[1:10:32] shadows of the scripture step
[1:10:33] out of the shadows of just this evening
[1:10:36] time it's almost six o'clock
[1:10:38] but i pray father the same lord jesus
[1:10:41] that revealed yourself
[1:10:42] two thousand years ago would come into
[1:10:45] this
[1:10:45] building of tucson tabernacle and just
[1:10:48] make yourself known
[1:10:49] to us tonight we acknowledge your
[1:10:52] greatness
[1:10:53] in simplicity tonight open our lives and
[1:10:56] give us strength
[1:10:57] in jesus name amen
[1:11:01] luke 24 verse 1 to 12 is again the
[1:11:05] resurrection of jesus christ this
[1:11:07] happened on sunday morning
[1:11:10] and our title tonight is our easter has
[1:11:13] arrived
[1:11:14] so when we look at um luke 24 verse 1 to
[1:11:18] 12
[1:11:18] that is the resurrection of the lord
[1:11:20] jesus and
[1:11:21] verse 10 verse 10 talks about mary
[1:11:24] magdalene and joanna and mary the mother
[1:11:27] of james and the other women so there
[1:11:29] was
[1:11:30] quite a few of the sisters that were
[1:11:32] first to the
[1:11:33] tomb now let's look in verse 13 as we
[1:11:36] come into
[1:11:37] easter afternoon this is sunday
[1:11:42] and behold two of them went that same
[1:11:46] day
[1:11:47] luke 24 13
[1:11:50] to a village called emmaus which was
[1:11:54] from jerusalem
[1:11:55] about three score furlongs
[1:11:58] i believe that's about six miles is that
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:02] i think it's about six miles and they
[1:12:05] talk together of all these things which
[1:12:08] had happened
[1:12:08] on friday and on saturday
[1:12:12] and now they hadn't heard that jesus
[1:12:15] they didn't know where jesus was it's
[1:12:17] and here it is the afternoon time but
[1:12:19] they were talking about it
[1:12:21] and it came to pass that while they
[1:12:23] communed together and reason
[1:12:26] jesus let's all say jesus
[1:12:29] himself drew near and went with them
[1:12:32] but their eyes were holding that they
[1:12:34] should not know him
[1:12:36] and he said unto them what manner of
[1:12:38] communications
[1:12:40] are these that you have one to another
[1:12:42] as you walk
[1:12:43] and are sad and the one of them whose
[1:12:46] name was cleopas answering said unto
[1:12:49] them art thou only a stranger
[1:12:51] in jerusalem and has not known the
[1:12:53] things which are come
[1:12:54] to pass there in these days and he said
[1:12:58] unto them
[1:12:58] what things and they said unto him
[1:13:01] concerning jesus of nazareth
[1:13:03] which was a prophet mighty in deed and
[1:13:06] word
[1:13:06] before god and all the people and how
[1:13:09] the chief
[1:13:10] priest and our elders delivered him
[1:13:13] to be condemned to death and have
[1:13:16] crucified him
[1:13:17] here they're talking about the man that
[1:13:20] had just went through all of this
[1:13:23] and we trusted we had hoped we had
[1:13:26] believed that it had been
[1:13:28] he which should have redeemed israel and
[1:13:31] beside all this
[1:13:32] today is the third day since these
[1:13:35] things were done
[1:13:37] yay and certain women also of our
[1:13:39] company made us astonished
[1:13:41] which were early at the sepulcher and
[1:13:44] when they found
[1:13:45] not his body they came saying that they
[1:13:48] had also seen a vision of
[1:13:50] angels which said that he was
[1:13:53] alive and certain of them which were
[1:13:56] with us went to the sepulcher
[1:13:58] and found it even so as the women had
[1:14:00] said but him
[1:14:02] they saw not
[1:14:05] then he said unto them o fools and slow
[1:14:08] of
[1:14:08] heart to believe all that the prophets
[1:14:12] have spoken
[1:14:13] ought not christ to have suffered these
[1:14:15] things
[1:14:16] and to enter into his glory and
[1:14:19] beginning at moses
[1:14:21] and all the prophets he expounded
[1:14:24] unto them in all the scriptures the
[1:14:27] things concerning himself
[1:14:29] they weren't bored they weren't confu
[1:14:32] they but as god begin
[1:14:34] to talk to them jesus their hearts begin
[1:14:36] to burn
[1:14:37] and i pray tonight just for the next few
[1:14:39] minutes that while we're sitting
[1:14:41] at tucson tabernacle that the lord jesus
[1:14:44] would step out of the shadows
[1:14:46] and may our hearts start burning within
[1:14:47] us god bless you you can have your seats
[1:14:50] tonight
[1:14:54] just keep your bibles open because i had
[1:14:56] you seated
[1:14:58] because we just finished half of their
[1:15:00] walk just their
[1:15:01] half of their walk from toward emmaus
[1:15:04] but i want to speak tonight on our
[1:15:06] easter has arrived
[1:15:09] we talked friday about how what jesus
[1:15:12] went through
[1:15:12] and the crucifixion and things we spoke
[1:15:15] about
[1:15:16] saturday and how it was dark and how we
[1:15:19] just don't understand what is
[1:15:21] happening and then now sunday morning
[1:15:23] and i'm so thankful we heard the message
[1:15:25] this morning
[1:15:27] on the surge the surge at easter wasn't
[1:15:30] that wonderful just
[1:15:31] to know the holy ghost the spirit
[1:15:33] raising jesus from the dead
[1:15:36] what a resurrection that was but to not
[1:15:39] look back 2 000 years ago and
[1:15:41] try to make a drama and a hollywood
[1:15:44] passion about it
[1:15:45] and and not just to focus on history but
[1:15:48] to be able to know that right now
[1:15:50] what god is doing in our hearts now what
[1:15:53] a resurrection this is
[1:15:55] hello tucson tabernacle don't don't
[1:15:58] miss what god is doing some are missing
[1:16:02] what god is doing
[1:16:03] and jesus is walking with us and they
[1:16:05] don't even know it
[1:16:07] they don't even know that jesus is doing
[1:16:09] these things
[1:16:11] and i'm glad that we didn't stop in
[1:16:13] verse 27 because
[1:16:14] a lot of us have heard about moses and
[1:16:17] all the prophets and
[1:16:18] you can put that up brothers luke 24
[1:16:21] verse 27 how the
[1:16:23] beginning of moses and all the prophets
[1:16:25] let me ask you tonight
[1:16:26] who would have liked to have taken this
[1:16:28] walk with jesus
[1:16:32] i mean we don't understand
[1:16:35] we don't understand how it could be like
[1:16:37] this
[1:16:38] what happened friday what happened
[1:16:42] saturday and then you know we've heard
[1:16:44] some of our sisters have told us
[1:16:46] remember it was the sisters that that
[1:16:48] saw the empty tomb first
[1:16:50] it was a lady in the church that
[1:16:52] actually heard the voice of jesus in the
[1:16:55] garden
[1:16:55] mary mary and you know she she believed
[1:16:59] it was joanna it was some of the maybe
[1:17:02] it was a musician
[1:17:02] maybe it was one of the sisters their
[1:17:05] heart was so happy
[1:17:06] he has risen and the brothers didn't
[1:17:09] believe it at first
[1:17:11] some of us are slow of heart now we're
[1:17:14] walking down a road and we're sad we've
[1:17:17] heard about all this but we haven't seen
[1:17:19] jesus ourselves it's like a story
[1:17:21] it's like uh it's like a dream it's like
[1:17:24] we've heard about all these things but
[1:17:26] now
[1:17:27] someone is talking to us about the word
[1:17:30] of god
[1:17:31] and something's happening in our hearts
[1:17:34] that's more than a story
[1:17:37] verse 28. if you have your bibles it
[1:17:40] would be good to just follow along the
[1:17:41] brothers are
[1:17:42] putting it on the screen but if you
[1:17:44] follow as they were talking and walking
[1:17:47] these six miles
[1:17:48] my they got some good exercise that day
[1:17:51] i didn't get my afternoon walk today
[1:17:53] as they were getting in some exercise
[1:17:55] and walking with jesus down the road
[1:17:58] they
[1:17:58] drew nigh to a village with her they
[1:18:01] went
[1:18:01] and he made as though he would just keep
[1:18:04] on going further jesus
[1:18:06] had brought him through these great
[1:18:08] times in this moment of resurrection
[1:18:11] talking now about the scriptures and
[1:18:13] talking about their day
[1:18:15] and but he made like he was just going
[1:18:17] to keep on going
[1:18:21] and maybe that's where tucson tabernacle
[1:18:24] is tonight maybe
[1:18:25] god has done great things among us and
[1:18:27] talked to us along the road and
[1:18:29] it makes it look like he's just gonna go
[1:18:31] on his way
[1:18:33] but verse 29 says they constrained him
[1:18:37] that means with strong desire they loved
[1:18:40] what they had been hearing what had been
[1:18:42] happening
[1:18:43] as he talked to them along the road they
[1:18:45] constrained him maybe they grabbed a
[1:18:47] hold of him and said we don't want you
[1:18:49] to
[1:18:50] leave us would you come with us to our
[1:18:53] emmaus meal
[1:18:54] come and have some more fellowship we
[1:18:56] want to spend some more time with you
[1:18:58] jesus
[1:18:58] i want you jesus i love this presence
[1:19:03] i love this atmosphere i loved how he
[1:19:06] just talked to us
[1:19:07] wasn't that so good it made it come
[1:19:10] alive
[1:19:10] it wasn't like the scribes and pharisees
[1:19:13] and
[1:19:14] and you know we weren't bored at all it
[1:19:15] was just like those minutes went by so
[1:19:18] fast
[1:19:18] but my it made it so real to us our
[1:19:21] hearts
[1:19:22] are burning and and then he made it like
[1:19:24] he was just gonna go and they said no
[1:19:26] we want more of this
[1:19:30] i hope there's some here tonight that
[1:19:31] are like that abide with us
[1:19:35] for it is toward evening
[1:19:38] it's sunday how many know this is sunday
[1:19:42] in the bible the the evening after the
[1:19:45] resurrection
[1:19:47] and here we find ourselves in april 2021
[1:19:51] on the evening time of easter the same
[1:19:54] time
[1:19:55] i just think it'd be amazing if the same
[1:19:58] lord jesus that did it for them
[1:20:00] would do it for somebody in this
[1:20:01] building
[1:20:03] maybe tonight's crowd is the least of
[1:20:05] the whole weekend
[1:20:06] but god reveals himself to just a few
[1:20:11] maybe we're just enjoying the few that
[1:20:14] god can now focus down on your heart and
[1:20:16] your needs and it's not the sunday
[1:20:18] morning crowd and
[1:20:19] it's not the easter morning crowd it's
[1:20:21] just you tonight and
[1:20:23] us and just a few of us before we go
[1:20:25] have a little fellowship
[1:20:27] and god is just it wasn't planned that
[1:20:30] jesus meet these men cleopas and his
[1:20:33] friend
[1:20:33] hadn't made this appointment they're
[1:20:35] just walking along kind of kicking the
[1:20:37] pebbles brother aaron saying how can all
[1:20:39] this
[1:20:39] be and we don't understand and their
[1:20:41] countenance is falling they didn't see
[1:20:43] the nail scarred hands
[1:20:47] they didn't know that this man that was
[1:20:49] walking with them was jesus
[1:20:52] they just thought it was another man but
[1:20:55] something was happening
[1:20:56] to them and they constrained him it was
[1:20:58] toward evening
[1:21:00] and the day is far spent and he went in
[1:21:03] to tarry with him
[1:21:06] and it came to pass brother jeremy as he
[1:21:08] sat
[1:21:09] at meet with them he took bread
[1:21:13] and blessed it and break it
[1:21:16] and gave to them something was happening
[1:21:19] beyond a man
[1:21:21] breaking bread and having fellowship and
[1:21:23] let's have a meal
[1:21:25] their eyes were open
[1:21:28] verse 31 and their eyes came open
[1:21:31] they said there's only one man that can
[1:21:34] do that
[1:21:34] and that is jesus hello believers of the
[1:21:38] message
[1:21:39] surely this far down the road there's
[1:21:41] only one man that can open
[1:21:43] our hearts like that and that is jesus
[1:21:47] when he had done something that was
[1:21:49] familiar to them the same
[1:21:52] voice that had called them from a little
[1:21:54] girl sister laurie
[1:21:57] the same god that called you as a little
[1:22:00] boy when you didn't understand
[1:22:02] the same one that broke it to your heart
[1:22:06] when you first gave your heart their
[1:22:08] eyes come open
[1:22:09] it was the same jesus but their eyes
[1:22:11] come open
[1:22:13] and they knew him
[1:22:17] what does the bible say that next he
[1:22:20] vanished out of their sight
[1:22:23] he's in a new body that's why he told
[1:22:26] mary don't touch me yet i've not
[1:22:27] ascended
[1:22:28] yet to my father but now he's coming and
[1:22:30] he's in a new body he just
[1:22:32] he he can walk through a wall he can
[1:22:34] appear in another city which we're going
[1:22:36] to find out he did
[1:22:37] it's the same quickening power that was
[1:22:39] on jesus
[1:22:40] was on philippine and the book of acts
[1:22:43] that in a great revival in samaria
[1:22:45] god calls him to go baptize one
[1:22:48] one colored brother one man that was
[1:22:52] writing in a chariot and reading
[1:22:54] the bible of isaiah but he didn't
[1:22:56] understand and all of a sudden
[1:22:58] there's a man walking on the road that
[1:23:00] had just come from a massive
[1:23:01] message revival demon spirits cast out
[1:23:05] and
[1:23:05] hundreds of people in it and then now
[1:23:07] he's just walking along a road and there
[1:23:09] comes a chariot
[1:23:10] it was for one it was just for one
[1:23:15] hello tucson tabernacle god will leave
[1:23:19] the thousands
[1:23:20] for you tonight and by the end of that
[1:23:23] story
[1:23:23] they're walking out in the water he's
[1:23:26] getting baptized the colored brother
[1:23:28] he rises him up out of the water and
[1:23:30] philip disappears
[1:23:34] speaking bible right now and he appears
[1:23:36] in another city
[1:23:37] that's between 150 and 200 miles away
[1:23:42] he was translated and brother branham
[1:23:45] said he never
[1:23:47] went back to samaria again
[1:23:50] he didn't go back to the revival he
[1:23:52] didn't go back to those believers that
[1:23:54] had given their heart to
[1:23:56] the lord and been filled with the holy
[1:23:57] ghost and he didn't go back
[1:23:59] but god had another plan he had another
[1:24:02] vision
[1:24:03] friends who would like to get translated
[1:24:05] just caught up and just
[1:24:07] forget about everything of work and my
[1:24:09] boss and the school and
[1:24:11] the money and the politicians and the
[1:24:14] virus
[1:24:16] hallelujah just get caught away
[1:24:20] and now jesus now we're coming back to
[1:24:23] our scripture
[1:24:23] he just vanishes out of their sight
[1:24:27] wow did you see that brother did you see
[1:24:30] that
[1:24:34] and one might have said i knew it was
[1:24:36] him all the time
[1:24:37] no you didn't
[1:24:42] y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:24:43] somebody say something it's kind of a
[1:24:45] riddle a riddle a riddle and
[1:24:47] oh we don't know tell us the answer and
[1:24:49] you say i knew it
[1:24:51] it was on the tip of my tongue and
[1:24:53] cleopa says no you didn't
[1:24:58] i got some of you to smile amen now
[1:25:01] watch this they had just been
[1:25:03] breaking bread and having some
[1:25:04] fellowship with a person
[1:25:06] and just when he began to speak to them
[1:25:08] and break the bread their eyes come open
[1:25:10] that's jesus oh jesus
[1:25:14] but he disappeared it's sunday night
[1:25:19] we talked about friday we talked about
[1:25:22] saturday
[1:25:23] all of us were looking forward to sunday
[1:25:25] morning now this is right in line sister
[1:25:28] melissa with your song
[1:25:29] because a lot of believers and a lot of
[1:25:32] churches and a lot of
[1:25:33] ministers they really look forward to
[1:25:35] easter sunday morning
[1:25:37] is this the morning is the resurrection
[1:25:39] going to happen
[1:25:40] is sunday morning the red what my the
[1:25:42] greatest day of the whole
[1:25:44] year you would think that would be the
[1:25:46] day for the great resurrection
[1:25:49] but it didn't happen like that this
[1:25:51] morning now we're already in the
[1:25:53] afternoon
[1:25:56] i'm not talking 2 000 years ago i'm
[1:25:57] talking about tonight
[1:25:59] easter has just kept moving god must
[1:26:02] have something for us
[1:26:03] down the road so the general
[1:26:06] resurrection didn't happen this morning
[1:26:10] i'm talking about tonight you all
[1:26:12] understand
[1:26:13] so there must be a work for us to do
[1:26:16] there must be a work for us to do
[1:26:18] down the road 2 000 years ago the
[1:26:21] resurrection
[1:26:22] took place but i'm talking this morning
[1:26:24] april the 4th
[1:26:25] the resurrected saints didn't come
[1:26:27] walking into tucson tabernacle
[1:26:29] and that surge oh my that's so and so
[1:26:32] and that so and so we're still
[1:26:34] here in fact we're fewer in number
[1:26:37] there's more room for the angels to be
[1:26:39] social distance
[1:26:40] all the social distancing angels that if
[1:26:43] the lord would open our eyes
[1:26:46] i tell you what brother jordan if there
[1:26:48] was already a sudden be a light
[1:26:50] over and just come down and go back to
[1:26:52] brother arnie and just kind of the
[1:26:54] pillar
[1:26:55] of fire just like amber back there and
[1:26:57] brother brother
[1:26:58] jordan looked back and saw his father
[1:27:00] just his face aglow
[1:27:02] and there was like a pillar of fire over
[1:27:04] his he'd probably grab his little cell
[1:27:05] phone and
[1:27:06] take that photo and i wouldn't mind just
[1:27:08] sharing it with this that'd be
[1:27:09] incredible
[1:27:11] if all of a sudden angel started
[1:27:12] appearing on your pew and you looked
[1:27:15] down
[1:27:16] looked down and there was an angel
[1:27:18] sitting there
[1:27:20] just pulsating with light and pulsating
[1:27:22] and god opens your eyes
[1:27:24] to the angels that are in this service
[1:27:26] you'd get excited too
[1:27:29] and don't tell me you wouldn't we all
[1:27:32] would
[1:27:35] but i believe the the pillar of fire is
[1:27:37] in this building right now
[1:27:39] i believe the angel of the lord is in
[1:27:41] this building right now
[1:27:43] i believe he's here the holy ghost is
[1:27:46] here
[1:27:47] jesus is here part of the bride of
[1:27:50] christ is sitting
[1:27:51] right in this building right now
[1:27:54] some of you brothers have been faithful
[1:27:56] years keeping the standard and holding
[1:27:59] the church together and being faithful
[1:28:01] you've taken care of the bride
[1:28:04] you've kept the standard god's going to
[1:28:06] honor that
[1:28:07] god's going to honor that verse 32
[1:28:11] and they said one to another did not our
[1:28:14] heart
[1:28:15] burn this is cleopas and his friend did
[1:28:18] not our heart
[1:28:18] burn within us while he talked with us
[1:28:23] by the way
[1:28:24] while he scriptures
[1:28:28] it was like the scriptures came alive
[1:28:32] it's like what brother branham said in
[1:28:34] entombment and
[1:28:36] that's what brother john was quoting out
[1:28:37] of yesterday if you want to know
[1:28:39] where we got that inspiration and just
[1:28:41] the word we're talking about what jesus
[1:28:43] was doing on saturday morning
[1:28:45] saturday night it's in the message i was
[1:28:48] listening to it
[1:28:50] on friday and on saturday this morning
[1:28:53] and my wife can tell you i was listening
[1:28:54] to
[1:28:55] the next sunday morning of the mighty
[1:28:57] conqueror
[1:28:58] then sunday night of the same weekend
[1:29:00] brother branham
[1:29:01] spoke a message and their eyes were open
[1:29:05] so literally what you've heard this
[1:29:07] weekend is just the message
[1:29:10] it's quotes of brother branham i might
[1:29:12] not have been saying brother but i'm
[1:29:13] saying brother but i'm saying but i but
[1:29:15] i was speaking to you the message
[1:29:18] some of your children and some of your
[1:29:19] young people their hearts were burning
[1:29:21] within them
[1:29:27] as he opened to us verse 33 and they
[1:29:30] rose up the same hour
[1:29:31] and returned to jerusalem and found the
[1:29:34] eleven
[1:29:35] gathered together remember judas went
[1:29:37] out and hung himself so the twelve
[1:29:39] disciples became eleven
[1:29:41] and they were gathered together in them
[1:29:43] that were with them saying the lord
[1:29:45] is risen indeed hallelujah and hath
[1:29:47] appeared
[1:29:48] to simon that was simon peter and they
[1:29:51] told
[1:29:52] what things were done in the way and how
[1:29:53] he was known of them
[1:29:55] in the breaking of the bread how many
[1:29:58] would like to see that more and more
[1:30:00] in your life in your devotion in the
[1:30:03] hearing
[1:30:03] just the lord's making himself known
[1:30:08] he was made known to them in the opening
[1:30:10] of the word
[1:30:11] in the breaking of the bread the same
[1:30:13] lord jesus
[1:30:15] is making himself known to the elect
[1:30:17] bride today
[1:30:18] our easter has arrived
[1:30:23] so where do we go from here
[1:30:26] it's going to be easter now and some of
[1:30:29] us are flying away monday
[1:30:31] some are leaving you on tuesday you are
[1:30:33] maybe going back to work or school
[1:30:35] and we see from the emmaus road cleopas
[1:30:38] and his friend
[1:30:39] and all the things that happen remember
[1:30:42] it wasn't just
[1:30:43] jesus that uh resurrected on sunday
[1:30:46] morning
[1:30:46] the bible says that the graves were open
[1:30:49] and the old testament believers
[1:30:51] were walking around and were seen of
[1:30:54] many
[1:30:55] how many believe the bible so it's not
[1:30:57] just jesus walking around
[1:30:59] it's the saints of old we're walking
[1:31:02] around jerusalem
[1:31:04] and that's a good question when did they
[1:31:08] go up to heaven
[1:31:10] when did those believers go up to heaven
[1:31:12] that's a good question
[1:31:13] well it's right in the message too i was
[1:31:15] listening to brother branham this
[1:31:17] morning he took
[1:31:18] he said they went up when jesus went up
[1:31:20] 40 days later so they were walking
[1:31:23] around jerusalem for 40 days and when
[1:31:26] jesus ascended
[1:31:27] up into heaven that's when those others
[1:31:29] had and the bible says he led captivity
[1:31:32] captive and gave gifts unto men that's
[1:31:35] the scripture brother branham used
[1:31:36] that those disciples of jesus from they
[1:31:39] ascended up also
[1:31:41] some of you didn't know that well it's
[1:31:43] time to get back in the message
[1:31:46] let's go to this western town just for a
[1:31:49] moment
[1:31:51] this western town i see is
[1:31:54] the buildings are along the side of the
[1:31:56] road and there's a horse carriage
[1:32:00] and in the horse carriage is a little
[1:32:02] baby boy
[1:32:05] and for some reason there's a shot in
[1:32:08] the western town
[1:32:09] a shot of a gun and it scared the horses
[1:32:12] that were carrying the carriage and they
[1:32:15] started running down the street toward
[1:32:17] the cliff toward a drop off because they
[1:32:19] had been spooked they had been scared
[1:32:21] by the gunshot and
[1:32:24] a young man saw all this happening and
[1:32:27] he ran out into the
[1:32:28] middle of the road and he stopped those
[1:32:30] horses just before it went over
[1:32:32] and saved the little baby boy
[1:32:37] years went by in this town and the story
[1:32:41] goes and it's not just a story it's the
[1:32:45] truth a young man took the wrong road
[1:32:48] and he got to drinking carousing and he
[1:32:51] actually
[1:32:51] shot a man and now they're in court and
[1:32:55] now
[1:32:55] he's before the judge and he's standing
[1:32:59] there
[1:33:02] this is the inspiration from this whole
[1:33:04] weekend i kept saying
[1:33:06] it's friday but sunday is coming it's
[1:33:09] saturday
[1:33:10] but tomorrow sunday where we're standing
[1:33:12] on sunday
[1:33:13] are we just all supposed to get confused
[1:33:16] and disillusioned and go back monday and
[1:33:18] be the same
[1:33:19] no years went by and this young man took
[1:33:23] the wrong road and murdered someone
[1:33:25] and he's standing in the court
[1:33:28] and the judge is there and he sentenced
[1:33:31] this man
[1:33:32] to death for murdering someone
[1:33:36] and that young man he broke the whole
[1:33:39] court procession and he jumped over the
[1:33:41] rail and he
[1:33:42] and he fell at the judge's feet and he
[1:33:44] said judge judge
[1:33:45] don't you recognize me don't you
[1:33:48] recognize me
[1:33:49] and the judge was a little bit uh just
[1:33:51] taken back by this
[1:33:53] huge outburst in his court he said no
[1:33:55] son no i
[1:33:56] i don't reckon don't you recognize me
[1:33:59] years ago
[1:34:00] when i was a little baby in a carriage
[1:34:04] with some horses and there was a gunshot
[1:34:06] that scared them they ran
[1:34:08] down the r and it was going toward a
[1:34:09] cliff and it was you
[1:34:11] judge when you were younger
[1:34:14] you stopped those horses and you saved
[1:34:17] my life
[1:34:19] and the young man has pleaded and he
[1:34:21] said judge
[1:34:22] judge you saved me then can't you save
[1:34:26] me now
[1:34:30] and the judge just kind of said he's
[1:34:33] just still shaking a little bit from the
[1:34:35] outburst and they
[1:34:36] but he made the statement and he said
[1:34:38] young man
[1:34:40] that day i was your savior
[1:34:44] but today i'm your judge
[1:34:49] that day i was your savior but today
[1:34:54] i'm your judge and brother bradham is
[1:34:56] the one that spoke this story
[1:34:58] he actually is the one that gave this
[1:35:00] illustration
[1:35:01] in a service and he's bringing the
[1:35:04] reality
[1:35:05] that today god is dealing in your life
[1:35:08] today god is your savior today
[1:35:11] you have grace today you have mercy
[1:35:15] today we're feeding from the
[1:35:16] resurrection but to reject
[1:35:19] our day of grace is to stand before the
[1:35:23] judge
[1:35:24] and hear the same words that day
[1:35:27] i was your savior but today i'm your
[1:35:30] judge
[1:35:31] and friends that's the reason of tucson
[1:35:34] tabernacle
[1:35:35] that's the reason it was even started
[1:35:37] back in 1965
[1:35:39] and it still exists today in 2021 is
[1:35:42] that
[1:35:43] lives could be saved lives could be
[1:35:46] healed
[1:35:46] lives could hear the message declared
[1:35:49] over the pulpit
[1:35:50] and by that the new generation could
[1:35:53] rise up
[1:35:53] and their hearts could burn within them
[1:35:56] as they walk along the road
[1:35:58] and their eyes when they come open they
[1:36:00] see jesus
[1:36:02] we don't see a man we don't see just a
[1:36:05] family
[1:36:06] we don't just see the walls we we don't
[1:36:08] just see
[1:36:09] the fans turning in the rocks we're
[1:36:12] looking beyond that brother joseph
[1:36:14] beyond the water the water doesn't save
[1:36:17] brother joseph
[1:36:18] it's his confession of faith and now you
[1:36:22] tonight in a few minutes are going to
[1:36:23] see a dry
[1:36:25] a man that is dry go down into the water
[1:36:28] it's a type of the grave
[1:36:31] and come up and we don't want to see him
[1:36:33] go down down a dry
[1:36:35] center and come up a wet center
[1:36:38] it's a type that the water is like the
[1:36:40] grave
[1:36:42] you only put dead people in the grave
[1:36:44] somebody say man tonight
[1:36:46] we don't put live people in the
[1:36:48] graveyard
[1:36:50] and i don't think in tucson in your
[1:36:52] cemeteries you'd go by
[1:36:53] and see you know feet's hanging out and
[1:36:55] hands lifted out and
[1:36:57] skulls lifted out you put them totally
[1:36:59] under the water
[1:37:01] it's like our whole life we went under
[1:37:03] the water that we would rise
[1:37:06] in newness of life
[1:37:09] the same spirit that gave you
[1:37:12] old-timers and i'm middle-aged myself
[1:37:16] that joy and that thrill and the ecstasy
[1:37:20] of knowing
[1:37:20] jesus the new generation deserves to
[1:37:23] have that too
[1:37:25] we had our revival the older generation
[1:37:29] had our revival and brother bradham
[1:37:32] talked about this and spoken word is the
[1:37:34] original seed and
[1:37:35] other messages he said but the new
[1:37:37] generation deserves their chance at the
[1:37:39] word
[1:37:40] this is their time for their revival
[1:37:44] oh how our hearts burn within us when we
[1:37:47] heard the word
[1:37:48] is that true brothers and sisters you
[1:37:50] that are older know when the message
[1:37:52] came by your way it just was an
[1:37:54] excitement it was a joy
[1:37:56] you wanted to be there where god help us
[1:37:58] now in
[1:37:59] 2021 to allow the same jesus
[1:38:05] to step out of the shadows and make
[1:38:08] himself
[1:38:08] real in this generation that day
[1:38:12] i was your savior but today
[1:38:16] i'm your judge i don't want any person
[1:38:20] under the sound of our voice or ever has
[1:38:22] heard a message from this tabernacle
[1:38:25] to be standing that day and hear the
[1:38:28] judge
[1:38:35] our easter has arrived
[1:38:38] our time of the resurrection has arrived
[1:38:43] back in february i told you this already
[1:38:46] i brought the original piece of paper
[1:38:48] right here that god dealt with us
[1:38:50] in our office and home not knowing that
[1:38:53] we would be in tucson this weekend and
[1:38:55] i had written down in my notes token
[1:38:58] resurrection
[1:38:59] and the quickening power of rapture
[1:39:03] and rapturing quickening power and i've
[1:39:05] been studying that on the quickening
[1:39:07] power and how we've been elected
[1:39:09] for a resurrection but there was one
[1:39:11] quote of brother branham that
[1:39:13] i've kept here and i put it in my notes
[1:39:15] all the way from february
[1:39:18] can i share it tonight brother branham
[1:39:21] said it was easter morning
[1:39:24] i heard a chaplain from the first world
[1:39:26] war he said this right in arizona
[1:39:29] 1965 a chaplain from the first world war
[1:39:33] and the chaplain said he had to go down
[1:39:35] to the hospital
[1:39:36] said so many boys were laying in the
[1:39:38] tent and had just come
[1:39:40] from the outside and he went so he went
[1:39:42] in there and one of the officers said
[1:39:44] chaplin we want to ride out and take a
[1:39:47] look at the fields out there
[1:39:49] they had throwed he's talking about
[1:39:51] world war how they had thrown the
[1:39:53] mustard gas
[1:39:54] and the chlorine gas as they did in
[1:39:57] those days it just killed everything
[1:40:00] i said uh i got out there brother
[1:40:02] branham this is a
[1:40:04] chaplain's first-hand account i got out
[1:40:07] there that morning
[1:40:09] there wasn't bark on the tree there
[1:40:12] wasn't a sprig of grass
[1:40:14] and it was on easter morning he said
[1:40:17] there was some old
[1:40:18] wrecked tanks down there and the officer
[1:40:21] had to get a record of them to see if
[1:40:23] there was anything
[1:40:24] could be done for them this is near the
[1:40:27] argeon
[1:40:27] forest and he said i was standing there
[1:40:31] by myself
[1:40:32] and i i looked up and i said oh god
[1:40:36] here's a man looking out over a field
[1:40:40] there was no grass there was not even
[1:40:43] bark on the trees
[1:40:45] and he said oh god is this the way
[1:40:48] it's all coming to
[1:40:52] it was all burnt up no life nowhere at
[1:40:56] all
[1:40:56] just grass burn off the tree that
[1:40:59] gases the trees were killed everything
[1:41:02] was killed
[1:41:03] twisted hanging down where bulletin
[1:41:06] thing had
[1:41:07] riddled it and brother branham was
[1:41:09] applying that to the spiritual condition
[1:41:12] of the church are you listening i know
[1:41:14] it's friday evening
[1:41:16] i know many of you are weary
[1:41:20] but here's something that was already
[1:41:22] reserved for tonight
[1:41:23] back in february brother branham was
[1:41:26] looking out over
[1:41:28] the spiritual condition of the church
[1:41:30] how it had been
[1:41:31] riddled with gun shot and tanks were
[1:41:33] destroyed and
[1:41:34] no grass no bark on the trees which is
[1:41:38] a type of of the religion had been able
[1:41:41] to
[1:41:41] hold things together no the trees the
[1:41:43] bride tree
[1:41:45] he would say he said it's a picture of
[1:41:47] today where satan is spraying
[1:41:49] his unbelief and his hybriding of
[1:41:52] science
[1:41:54] and his knowledge until when it was at
[1:41:57] the beginning when
[1:41:58] god put adam and eve in the garden that
[1:42:01] beautiful paradise
[1:42:02] without death without sickness
[1:42:06] without sorrow everything was perfect in
[1:42:09] order
[1:42:10] look at what satan's ddt
[1:42:14] has done he's talking about look what
[1:42:16] satan's poison
[1:42:17] has done to this generation
[1:42:22] brother branham said she's in chaos
[1:42:25] there is nothing left in it and i think
[1:42:28] we could all agree
[1:42:30] this global pandemic has brought the
[1:42:33] world to
[1:42:33] its knees financially
[1:42:37] emotionally mentally
[1:42:41] just chaos and this man is looking out
[1:42:45] over this field and he's just started
[1:42:46] crying this chaplain
[1:42:49] just started crying and i walked back
[1:42:51] just started walking back to the tent
[1:42:54] but i was attracted to something that
[1:42:56] was there
[1:42:57] to a certain rock so i just went over
[1:43:01] there
[1:43:02] i just went over to this rock i was
[1:43:04] attracted to it
[1:43:05] i just went over there
[1:43:09] i looked at the rock and then i pushed
[1:43:12] it over
[1:43:13] and down beneath that rock was a little
[1:43:16] white
[1:43:17] flower growing the only living thing
[1:43:21] left because it had been sheltered by a
[1:43:24] rock
[1:43:26] he said god my rock shelter us today oh
[1:43:30] god
[1:43:31] when these poisons are flying everywhere
[1:43:34] in the name of science and education
[1:43:38] here's a prophet saying shelter us
[1:43:41] keep me until that day o god is my
[1:43:44] prayer
[1:43:45] i hope that we each one are under that
[1:43:48] rock which is christ hello believers
[1:43:52] tonight
[1:43:55] on easter evening
[1:43:58] god is getting our attention to what's
[1:44:01] under the rock
[1:44:02] stop looking at the death stop looking
[1:44:05] at the brokenness
[1:44:06] stop describing the ddt and the chaos
[1:44:10] and the poison and the numbers
[1:44:11] brother branham said it's science and
[1:44:14] education
[1:44:15] let god show you a revelation
[1:44:18] and as you look at the revelation as you
[1:44:21] ponder
[1:44:21] these things just go over there and
[1:44:23] start moving things around a little bit
[1:44:26] and under that rock brother jeremy
[1:44:28] was a white flower the only
[1:44:31] life in the whole field tucson
[1:44:35] tabernacle
[1:44:36] we need to look at the word we need to
[1:44:38] move around in the word
[1:44:39] let our hearts burn within us and see
[1:44:42] the white flower
[1:44:43] speaks of new life new growth the power
[1:44:47] of god
[1:44:48] moisture got down there but it had been
[1:44:50] the rock that had been
[1:44:52] sheltering it from all of this poison
[1:44:54] and all of the world
[1:44:56] friends all of you that make the rapture
[1:44:58] are gonna say
[1:44:59] thank god for the rock and this rock is
[1:45:03] jesus he's the only one
[1:45:10] i hope tonight as we leave these easter
[1:45:13] meetings
[1:45:15] that you'll start turning over the rocks
[1:45:17] in your life and looking for the rose
[1:45:19] looking for the
[1:45:20] white lily white flower just after
[1:45:24] tonight and you go home
[1:45:26] and then it's going to be they call it i
[1:45:28] think brother aaron easter monday
[1:45:30] because it's the monday after easter
[1:45:33] it's the time when many people they just
[1:45:37] okay we had a great crescendo and it was
[1:45:39] a wonderful time and it was a
[1:45:41] great surge and my the meetings and we
[1:45:44] were clapping
[1:45:45] we were rejoicing and we had three
[1:45:47] specials we had four specials and my
[1:45:50] it was incredible but you are gonna have
[1:45:52] your monday
[1:45:54] after the revival
[1:45:58] but i pray that we would all be able to
[1:46:00] say my easter
[1:46:03] has arrived christ that made himself
[1:46:07] known the sunday before on palm sunday
[1:46:09] when they were all shouting hosanna
[1:46:11] hosanna
[1:46:12] and by friday morning those same ones
[1:46:14] that were shouting hosanna hosanna
[1:46:16] were saying crucify him crucify him they
[1:46:20] had been so
[1:46:20] influenced by the religious spirit of
[1:46:23] the city
[1:46:26] i hope you're listening they were so
[1:46:29] influenced
[1:46:30] by the division in the city that they
[1:46:33] one sunday they loved him by the next
[1:46:36] friday morning they wanted to destroy
[1:46:38] his character
[1:46:40] they wanted to speak negative things
[1:46:42] that were twisted
[1:46:43] about the messiah about the word
[1:46:48] that was being made flesh and was so
[1:46:50] evident right before them
[1:46:52] they nailed him to the cross oh you say
[1:46:56] brother john
[1:46:56] those scribes and pharisees didn't nail
[1:46:58] him to the cross well
[1:47:00] they said his blood be upon us and on
[1:47:02] our children
[1:47:03] and for all of these years the jewish
[1:47:06] catch this tonight
[1:47:07] the jewish race their eyes has been
[1:47:10] blinded
[1:47:10] from the messiah but one day friends
[1:47:13] when the bride
[1:47:14] leaves this earth the same message that
[1:47:17] you have received
[1:47:18] is going to be revealed to the jewish
[1:47:21] people
[1:47:22] oh you ought to be excited right now and
[1:47:25] 144 000
[1:47:26] are going to be saved
[1:47:31] you all know revelations 10 right christ

[1:47:35] earthly s messenger which was william
[1:47:38] branham now he's

[1:47:42] reveal the mysteries but what's
[1:47:43] revelations 11

[1:47:48] back to the jews they're delivering a
[1:47:50] word
[1:47:51] the same jesus that you have crucified
[1:47:54] you crucified 2 000 years ago it's going
[1:47:57] to be a global thing they're going to
[1:47:59] kill moses and elijah publicly
[1:48:02] and when the bible says in revelations
[1:48:04] 11 that the world will gaze on this
[1:48:07] the only way the world will gaze on that
[1:48:10] all the
[1:48:10] news and all the major stations are
[1:48:13] going to be showing this
[1:48:14] globally while the bride is in another
[1:48:16] place

[1:48:20] little bit of something that
[1:48:21] the message has made very clear the
[1:48:23] jewish people their eyes are blinded

[1:48:28] open
[1:48:30] are you serious we killed the messiah

[1:50:51] certain amount of
[1:50:52] funds or property or benefits i give to
[1:50:54] you
[1:50:55] you friends we have been made heirs
[1:50:58] of all of these promises
[1:51:02] and you don't have to be weary and
[1:51:04] depressed
[1:51:05] and allow these spirits to walk all over
[1:51:07] your mind and your spirit and
[1:51:10] i don't know if i'll ever be invited
[1:51:12] back here to speak again but
[1:51:14] this morning i actually wrote a note
[1:51:17] brother arnie in my notes
[1:51:19] because after all of the ones that were
[1:51:21] coming for prayer last night i
[1:51:22] i realized we can say we're in the
[1:51:25] message all day long
[1:51:26] but we still have wounded ones among us
[1:51:30] we have wounded ones among us and we can
[1:51:33] spend all our services dealing with the
[1:51:35] soul realm
[1:51:36] getting people saved getting them filled
[1:51:38] with the holy ghost
[1:51:39] then we can have prayer lines and prayer
[1:51:42] meetings and we can go in that direction
[1:51:44] but there are individuals that have been
[1:51:46] neglected in their spirit realm
[1:51:48] and they sit right in our message pews
[1:51:51] and they are wounded
[1:51:54] and god raised up ministries that know
[1:51:56] how to deal
[1:51:57] in that realm brother branham did he
[1:52:00] talked about menopause
[1:52:01] he talked about nervousness i know we
[1:52:03] don't like to talk about those things
[1:52:05] publicly but a prophet did
[1:52:07] he talked about things that happened in
[1:52:09] a person's life and you're saved
[1:52:11] you have the holy ghost and he talked
[1:52:13] about that in masterpiece and
[1:52:15] and the sister that came to she was
[1:52:17] struggling and he went back in her life
[1:52:20] he went back in the life of one person
[1:52:22] and said it was a dog
[1:52:24] that was chasing you when you were a
[1:52:26] young girl i see you running from a dog
[1:52:29] another person fell down into a whale
[1:52:31] and it dislodged their insides

[1:52:35] demons and all that but it's going back
[1:52:37] into a person's life
[1:52:38] and having a gift and being able to deal
[1:52:41] with that thing
[1:52:42] it'll give our sisters victory give our

[1:53:46] him out we said you're true lord

[2:07:04] the order of the service and have this
[2:07:06] baptism
[2:07:07] we're gonna have a little food outside
[2:07:09] after words i don't like to say
[2:07:11] things about food before because i've
[2:07:13] had some scars in my life
[2:07:16] i'll tell you about that one time i was
[2:07:17] having a youth thing they were in this
[2:07:19] barn and it was just man we were having
[2:07:21] this the holy spirit was getting ready
[2:07:22] to fall
[2:07:23] i said let's bow our heads and like
[2:07:25] right there in this other room i heard
[2:07:27] all the chip bags opening
[2:07:32] you talk about a preacher plowing man we
[2:07:34] plowed right through that thing we had
[2:07:36] a prayer line a people just the holy
[2:07:38] spirit fell at the end and man just the
[2:07:40] holy spirit and everybody praising
[2:07:41] worshiping god at the end the pastor
[2:07:43] come up and said pray for me brother
[2:07:44] daniel the next day he said have you
[2:07:46] never seen the book of acts
[2:07:47] he said you should have been there last
[2:07:48] night when young people there in the
[2:07:49] holy spirit
[2:07:50] falling down amen so i never like to let
[2:07:53] the natural few
[2:07:54] distract us from the spiritual food we
[2:07:56] want to make sure we keep our attention
[2:07:58] on the important things in life
[2:08:00] and that's the word of god man shall not
[2:08:02] live by bread alone but by
[2:08:03] every word that proceeds out of the
[2:08:05] mouth of god it's okay to
[2:08:07] go do without a little bit of food here
[2:08:09] and there but we don't want to do
[2:08:10] without the spiritual food we need it
[2:08:12] i think it was brother john saying last
[2:08:14] night as we get deeper and deeper into
[2:08:16] this battle we see christians getting
[2:08:18] weaker and weaker and people are
[2:08:19] canceling their church services like
[2:08:21] i just don't understand that why in the
[2:08:23] world would you do that when the battle
[2:08:25] has never been raging
[2:08:26] and christians are getting weaker and
[2:08:27] weaker we're like oh we just give up
[2:08:30] my goodness god help us not to be like
[2:08:32] that say lord when they are training and
[2:08:34] they start getting new tactics
[2:08:36] let's come to church get in the presence
[2:08:37] of god and say holy spirit reveal what
[2:08:39] this
[2:08:40] is how's the devil getting us how's he
[2:08:41] coming against my mind and amen let's
[2:08:43] just raise up a standard against the
[2:08:45] devil let's not just roll over and
[2:08:47] pull our anchor up well it's all over
[2:08:49] and let him turn our ship
[2:08:50] amen we need to be fighters and warriors
[2:08:53] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[2:08:55] we're going to change the order of the
[2:08:56] service i don't know
[2:08:57] where brother joseph go did they already
[2:08:58] whisk him away
[2:09:00] all right they're up there hope he can
[2:09:02] hear me amen we're going to have a
[2:09:05] a baptismal but everything we do
[2:09:08] we do it because of the bible when a
[2:09:11] little baby's born
[2:09:12] we don't baptize that baby because the
[2:09:15] bible tells us
[2:09:16] to repent and be baptized and a baby
[2:09:19] cannot repent it's not cognitive enough
[2:09:21] to know what
[2:09:22] right and wrong is and that's why we
[2:09:23] don't baptize babies
[2:09:26] but the bible says that jesus did take
[2:09:28] up little children and bless them
[2:09:30] so we do have baby dedications where we
[2:09:32] bring children and we bless them and we
[2:09:34] give them back to god
[2:09:36] but a baptism i want to if you have your
[2:09:38] bibles i want you to turn in some
[2:09:40] scriptures
[2:09:41] acts chapter 2 what we do comes from the
[2:09:44] scriptures and we say amen in churches
[2:09:46] because the bible
[2:09:48] they read the scriptures and they said
[2:09:49] amen we call people brothers because in
[2:09:51] the scripture they called them brothers
[2:09:54] amen and so acts
[2:09:57] the second chapter verse 38 we went
[2:09:59] through these scriptures last night
[2:10:01] after the service brother joseph and i
[2:10:03] and brother daniel
[2:10:04] we went and in the we were talking about
[2:10:06] the death burial and resurrection of
[2:10:08] jesus christ
[2:10:09] and so in acts chapter 2 verse 36 peter
[2:10:12] has just been filled with the holy
[2:10:13] spirit
[2:10:14] now he comes and preaches the gospel the
[2:10:15] death burial and resurrection in chapter
[2:10:17] 2
[2:10:18] and in verse 36 therefore let all the
[2:10:20] house of israel know assuredly
[2:10:21] that jesus had made the same jesus whom
[2:10:24] you have crucified both
[2:10:25] lord and christ now when they heard this
[2:10:28] they were pricked in their heart
[2:10:29] and said unto peter and to the rest of
[2:10:32] the apostles men and brother and what
[2:10:33] shall we do in other words we're lost
[2:10:35] we've disobeyed god we just hung the
[2:10:37] savior
[2:10:38] we crucified him what are we going to do
[2:10:39] to be saved well how do we rectify this
[2:10:42] brother ram said this is when peter gave
[2:10:43] the eternal prescription remember he was
[2:10:45] given the keys to the kingdom
[2:10:47] whatsoever you bind on earth i'll bind
[2:10:48] in heaven whatever you loose on earth
[2:10:50] i'll loose it in heaven
[2:10:51] so jesus gives him the key brother i am
[2:10:53] said this was the eternal prescription
[2:10:54] for salvation
[2:10:56] he said then peter said unto them repent
[2:10:58] which means make an about
[2:10:59] face you're going this way to repent you
[2:11:02] turn and you go this way
[2:11:04] asking forgiveness does not mean
[2:11:06] necessarily repentance sometimes people
[2:11:08] just repent or they say i'm sorry
[2:11:10] because they got caught
[2:11:12] a repentance is a lifestyle change
[2:11:15] and you say i've done this and i was
[2:11:17] wrong and i'm sorry and you repent say
[2:11:19] god forgive me
[2:11:20] and you turn your life and go the other
[2:11:22] way
[2:11:23] and be baptized every one of you in the
[2:11:25] name of jesus christ for the remission
[2:11:27] for the
[2:11:28] washing away and the cutting off your of
[2:11:30] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[2:11:32] of the holy ghost for this promise of
[2:11:34] the holy ghost is unto you
[2:11:36] and to your children he's talking to the
[2:11:37] jews and to all that are afar off even
[2:11:40] as many as the lord our god shall call
[2:11:43] and with many other words he did testify
[2:11:45] and exhort saying save yourselves from
[2:11:47] this untoward generation
[2:11:49] then they that gladly received the word
[2:11:52] were baptized in the same day they were
[2:11:54] added unto them about 3 000
[2:11:57] souls amen go to romans chapter 8.
[2:12:00] we're going to find this in the bible
[2:12:01] when somebody asks you about baptism we
[2:12:03] say well what we believe comes from the
[2:12:05] scripture was there anybody sprinkled in
[2:12:07] the bible
[2:12:08] there was no one that was sprinkled
[2:12:10] water over in the bible brother john
[2:12:12] talked about the eunuch and the bible
[2:12:13] says that
[2:12:14] philip came and he preached jesus unto
[2:12:16] him you go back and look at it i think
[2:12:17] it's
[2:12:17] acts 8 said he preached jesus unto him
[2:12:21] and as he was traveling in the chariot
[2:12:22] all of a sudden the next subject was the
[2:12:24] eunuch said well hey here's water i want
[2:12:25] to get baptized
[2:12:27] because jesus said go and teach them all
[2:12:28] that i've commanded you he that
[2:12:30] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[2:12:32] so to preach jesus to someone the next
[2:12:34] thing that follows that is a repentance
[2:12:35] and a water baptism is that what the
[2:12:37] bible teaches us
[2:12:39] so if you've never been baptized you
[2:12:40] need to be baptized in the name of jesus
[2:12:42] christ for the remission of your sins
[2:12:44] amen so in in romans chapter six verse
[2:12:48] one
[2:12:48] what shall we say then shall we continue
[2:12:50] in sin that grace may abound
[2:12:52] god forbid how shall we that are dead
[2:12:54] and sins live any longer therein
[2:12:56] know ye not that so many of us as were
[2:12:59] baptized
[2:13:00] into jesus christ were baptized into his
[2:13:03] death
[2:13:04] therefore we are buried with him by
[2:13:07] baptism
[2:13:08] into death so that's what brother john
[2:13:10] was trying to say is
[2:13:11] the water is a symbol of the ground when
[2:13:13] you go past the cemetery there's not
[2:13:14] parts of you sticking out
[2:13:16] that's what happens to a lot of people
[2:13:17] they don't die to everything
[2:13:19] they say i want to be buried with christ
[2:13:21] but hey i don't want my wallet to get
[2:13:23] converted
[2:13:25] i don't want my day timer and calendar
[2:13:28] to get converted that's why there were
[2:13:29] so many people here this morning they're
[2:13:30] not here tonight
[2:13:32] they got their cat part of their their
[2:13:34] sunday morning converted but not their
[2:13:35] sunday night and god
[2:13:36] this is a holy day we dedicate this day
[2:13:38] to the lord
[2:13:40] so brother ram tells us everybody has a
[2:13:41] thirst he said the indians they came
[2:13:43] over here and they had a thirst to
[2:13:44] worship they
[2:13:45] put up a totem pole and they were she
[2:13:47] said everybody has a thirst to worship
[2:13:49] and there's something in them made in
[2:13:50] man to worship and they go to church
[2:13:51] they say oh i've done my religious duty
[2:13:53] for the week and they just go back home
[2:13:54] and they just go
[2:13:55] and live but that's not the christian
[2:13:57] the christian is dedicated to christ
[2:13:59] brotherhood tells us that christ the
[2:14:00] mystery of god revealed every time the
[2:14:02] door is open that christian is there to
[2:14:04] line up online word upon lord
[2:14:05] word and they're dedicated to christ and
[2:14:07] so we're buried
[2:14:09] unto death that like as christ was
[2:14:11] raised up from the dead
[2:14:13] by the glory of the father even so we
[2:14:15] should walk in newness of life
[2:14:17] for if we have been planted together in
[2:14:19] the likeness of his death we shall
[2:14:21] also in the likeness of his resurrection
[2:14:24] knowing this that our old man is
[2:14:26] crucified with him
[2:14:28] paul said i die daily i am crucified
[2:14:31] with christ
[2:14:32] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[2:14:34] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[2:14:36] for he that is dead is freed from sin
[2:14:40] now if we be dead with christ we believe
[2:14:42] that we shall also live with him
[2:14:45] knowing that christ being raised from
[2:14:46] the dead dieth no more death hath no
[2:14:48] more dominion over him
[2:14:50] for in that he died he died unto sin
[2:14:52] once but in that he
[2:14:54] liveth he liveth unto god amen so we're
[2:14:57] going to take brother joseph
[2:14:58] and we're going to bury him in water
[2:15:00] which is a symbol of of
[2:15:02] the grave we'll bury him and then when
[2:15:04] he raises we'll raise the newness of
[2:15:05] life
[2:15:06] amen i'm glad we can witness this now
[2:15:09] the water doesn't save you
[2:15:11] amen it's a symbol it's an outward act
[2:15:14] of something that's happened on the
[2:15:15] inside
[2:15:17] it's an outward sign of an inward work
[2:15:19] something that's happened and we had
[2:15:20] prayer here the other night he was
[2:15:22] here and we just had prayer in the back
[2:15:24] room i appreciate his parents sister
[2:15:26] sarah god bless you you've done
[2:15:27] something right in your life
[2:15:29] see this boy get baptized amen brother
[2:15:32] dan and
[2:15:32] doing something right with that's not an
[2:15:34] accident
[2:15:36] i mean i forget what brother adam said
[2:15:37] is 80 86
[2:15:39] 80 percent chance better a child of
[2:15:42] being saved if it's raised in a
[2:15:43] christian home
[2:15:45] they've done something right to see this
[2:15:46] young boy walk into the water
[2:15:48] amen and give his life to christ amen i
[2:15:51] wonder if we could sing that song just
[2:15:52] as we change the order of the service
[2:15:54] and then
[2:15:55] brother william if you'll just lead some
[2:15:56] songs there and then
[2:15:58] dismiss in prayer and then we'll gather
[2:16:00] over here and and
