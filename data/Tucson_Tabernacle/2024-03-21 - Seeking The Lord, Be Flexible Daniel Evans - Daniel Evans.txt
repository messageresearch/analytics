[44:31] she was in the neighborhood it's been a
[44:33] long long while since she was on this

[44:55] here and they were walking around and
[44:56] they were trying to reminisce with

[48:01] up I think it was a couple times she
[48:03] invited me and I had it in my heart to
[48:05] come especially after I'd seen you know
[48:07] the video of him and stuff and I seen
[48:09] the direction of how he wants the church
[48:10] to go
[48:12] but I just things just weren't in place
[48:14] for me to come
[48:16] then Tuesday night rolls around
[48:18] and I ended up having a dream
[48:22] and in my dream I was speaking to a
[48:24] family member that I hadn't seen in a
[48:26] long long time
[48:27] and uh we had a really good visit it was
[48:30] in the morning time
[48:33] and then he left my house
[48:35] and later on that night something
[48:36] happened something happened it was
[48:38] something bad happened he got killed or
[48:40] something really bad but it was one of
[48:42] them dreams that were so realistic
[48:45] that you were just so happy when you
[48:47] woke up that it was a dream wow that was
[48:49] just a dream
[48:51] and then when I woke up I was thinking
[48:53] about the dream and I and I kept
[48:56] thinking he was wearing a shirt that
[48:57] said Sunnyvale
[48:59] Sunnyvale stand a little closer yeah
[49:01] he was wearing a a shirt I'm sorry are
[49:04] you a little closer
[49:05] so he's wearing a shirt in my dream and
[49:07] it said Sunnyvale
[49:09] Sunnyvale twice on the shirt
[49:12] so I woke up and I thought well
[49:14] if something did happen to his family
[49:16] member I would have gotten a call to
[49:17] text or something already and you know I
[49:19] didn't get no text someone
[49:21] but then I started thinking what is
[49:23] Sunnyvale where what is Sunnyvale where
[49:25] is Sunny what does that have to do with
[49:27] this dream
[49:28] so I pulled my phone out and uh here's
[49:30] an interesting thing you know we got all
[49:32] our modern day gadgets electronics and
[49:35] everything else but
[49:36] one thing that we need to realize is all
[49:39] of the components that go into this all
[49:41] of the materials and all the things that
[49:43] comes from this Earth and this is God's
[49:45] Earth so all of the components and parts
[49:48] and metals in whatever may be into these
[49:51] guys such as these iPhones and things
[49:52] computers whatever those are all
[49:54] elements that come from the earth that's
[49:56] God's Earth so
[49:58] it's it's a strange thing to think about
[50:00] hey could God be in control
[50:03] and and could use these Electronics in a
[50:06] strange way to get a hold of somebody
[50:09] I say yes he could you know those those
[50:11] are his to begin with
[50:14] um so anyway in the dream Sunnyvale
[50:16] Sunnyvale I get up I grab my front my
[50:18] phone and I said you know what I'm just
[50:19] gonna hit a random search
[50:21] just a random search Sunnyvale see where
[50:24] is Sunnyvale what is it
[50:26] hit a random search it comes up
[50:28] Sunnyvale California
[50:30] Wine Festival
[50:32] first caught my my uh attention wow
[50:35] Sunnyvale is a town in California
[50:38] and uh you know I've seen that they were
[50:39] having a wine fest it was just an
[50:41] advertisement from the Chamber of
[50:42] Commerce or whatever
[50:44] and uh
[50:46] I realized Sunnyvale was near a place
[50:48] where I'm from I'm from originally from
[50:50] the East Bay near Oakland California and
[50:52] I said wow Sunnyvale of all places in
[50:54] the United States it's kind of near it's
[50:56] in the Bay Area you know a town that I
[50:57] didn't never knew that it's a town near
[51:00] near where uh you know where I was born
[51:01] where I used to live
[51:05] okay yeah those are the slides okay
[51:07] right here yeah so Sunnyvale right there
[51:08] okay keep that on Sunnyvale that was the
[51:10] first thing that I hit on the phone and
[51:11] uh
[51:13] yeah I said okay well Sunnyvale is a
[51:15] place in California but it's strange
[51:16] that it's where I was originally from
[51:19] so then I said okay well if Sunnyvale is
[51:21] in California what does that have to do
[51:24] with Tucson Arizona so then on the next
[51:27] slide I just hit a search I just put
[51:29] Sunnyvale space Tucson
[51:32] and then uh this pulls up and it was a
[51:35] map
[51:36] and I said wow this is strange because I
[51:38] didn't go to MapQuest or nothing I just
[51:40] went to a regular search Sunnyvale
[51:41] Tucson so a map pulls up with a with a
[51:45] marked out highlighted route
[51:47] and I look and I said wow okay this is
[51:49] from Sunnyvale and I look at I said okay
[51:51] it's coming it's mapping me to Tucson
[51:53] Arizona
[51:54] so I say uh
[51:56] wow this is a
[51:58] you know why is it coming to Tucson
[52:00] Arizona
[52:01] and uh
[52:05] first of all let me just stop here for a
[52:07] second this just came to my mind right
[52:09] here um
[52:11] I wasn't gonna tell this testimony but
[52:13] uh
[52:15] uh I was speaking to brother Arnie
[52:18] Peterson
[52:20] and it was a Wednesday night and um
[52:24] after church
[52:26] and he mentioned the Bay Area we were
[52:28] talking about horses and stuff so then I
[52:31] said okay well I think I might need to
[52:33] say this to some somebody so I'm here
[52:35] today you know based on whatever and
[52:37] I'll get back I'll get back to that part
[52:39] in a second but anyway here
[52:42] I mapped it out okay Sunnyvale
[52:45] California Tucson Arizona and then I
[52:47] zoom in if you go to the next slide
[52:50] okay there's the uh there's the route
[52:52] right there so I zoom in I see it's from
[52:54] California I want to know where it ended
[52:56] now so if you go to the next one
[52:59] okay
[53:00] go to the one before that one
[53:04] oh yeah okay now go back just go back
[53:05] one I'm sorry about that okay right here
[53:08] that route ended or Castro and Jacinto
[53:10] Street from Sunnyvale California to
[53:12] Castro and Jacinto that's the
[53:14] intersection just west of this church
[53:16] here so I said wow you know my daughter
[53:19] had invited me here the events that led
[53:21] up that led up to her uh coming here was
[53:24] already I think something of God and
[53:27] then he Maps me out on my phone to this
[53:30] very spot this was Wednesday morning at
[53:33] about nine o'clock in the morning when I
[53:35] found that
[53:36] so then if you go to the next slide now
[53:39] okay there's the church that's just east
[53:42] of uh Jacinto and Castro Street okay so
[53:45] now Castro Street and the brother Peter
[53:48] said I said well
[53:50] I'm gonna come to church Wednesday night
[53:51] now because my daughter invited me but
[53:55] now God is telling me to come here now
[53:56] so I'm coming Wednesday night and if you
[54:00] speak to my family they thought it was
[54:01] the strangest thing you know because a
[54:03] lot of times they'll invite me you know
[54:05] to go play some Churches or or whatever
[54:07] it may be and uh but then on Wednesday
[54:09] night I came by myself
[54:11] and I had to do a little explaining to
[54:13] him you and I just said hey you know
[54:15] what I'm going out you know I was
[54:16] procrastinating throughout the day I
[54:18] said hey I'm gonna go to church that's
[54:19] it I got in the car and I came I
[54:21] actually came by myself but when I came
[54:23] in and I was speaking to uh brother
[54:24] Peterson
[54:26] uh first I came in and said okay this
[54:28] happened I'm just gonna go to church I
[54:29] ain't gonna make no big deal about it or
[54:31] nothing but uh
[54:33] you know if I'm just gonna see what
[54:35] happens why was I directed to come here
[54:37] after church I'm speaking to Mr Peterson
[54:39] about horses and uh you know Mr
[54:42] Peterson's I don't know how much you
[54:44] know of him he's a horse man he's a
[54:46] farrier in things and
[54:49] um while we were talking he brings up
[54:52] the Bay Area because he also is from the
[54:54] Bay Area originally and we started
[54:57] talking about horses
[54:58] and he says
[55:00] well when I was up in the Bay Area and
[55:03] you know I used to work with horses
[55:04] there was a lady that had 35 horses and
[55:07] she lived down in Castro Valley
[55:09] and I said wait a minute
[55:12] did you just say Castro and he says well
[55:15] yeah Castro Valley I said okay stop
[55:17] right there here I got something to tell
[55:18] you and that's when I pulled out my
[55:21] phone I said okay it's meant for me to
[55:22] tell this story
[55:23] pulled out my phone he told him the
[55:25] story and then after that he uh he uh
[55:29] asked me you know he was uh he was
[55:31] pretty blessed by the story and he says
[55:33] hey uh
[55:34] would you like a case of tomatoes but
[55:36] before you leave and I said
[55:38] well yeah you're giving out Tomatoes
[55:40] I'll take me some
[55:41] you know I was getting ready to go out
[55:42] the front door of the church and I had
[55:45] he he came up and introduced himself to
[55:47] me when I was sitting in the back but
[55:48] that was it but I'm getting ready to
[55:49] walk out the front door of the church
[55:51] so brother Peterson takes me in the back
[55:53] to give me a case of tomatoes and uh I
[55:56] ended up with uh 75 percent of them
[55:58] because I think uh brother Peterson must
[56:00] have ate the top half or something but
[56:02] they're very good with salt they just
[56:04] plain tomatoes with salt but yeah but
[56:07] anyway I'm just kidding he's a fine man
[56:09] brother Peterson
[56:11] but anyway because he took me to the
[56:13] back I was then I ran right into the
[56:15] pastor uh Evans here and then he started
[56:18] telling me his account of my daughter
[56:19] coming to the church and I said well
[56:21] that's funny that you mentioned all this
[56:22] because
[56:23] I got a story as to how I got here today
[56:26] too and then I started telling him my
[56:29] story and um
[56:30] that's when he said hey can you can you
[56:33] uh come on Sunday morning and tell this
[56:35] story I said well do you think it'll
[56:38] bless anybody you think anybody would
[56:40] like to hear this that God directed
[56:42] somebody to this church somebody he
[56:45] directed on me well yes they will and I
[56:47] said okay I'm coming so that's how I
[56:49] ended up here but uh
[56:51] if you look at
[56:53] the way that God works
[56:56] um
[56:56] go back to the children of Israel when
[56:58] they come up out of Egypt he didn't just
[57:01] send them off into the desert and say
[57:03] hey go find your way
[57:04] he mapped them out a way to get over to
[57:08] the Mount Sinai to get the law and
[57:11] ultimately into the Promised Land
[57:13] and let me tell you a little bit about
[57:15] the way that he chose it was a pillar of
[57:19] it was a cloud to Lead the Way by day in
[57:23] a pillar of fire to Lead the Way by
[57:25] night okay now that was the same Pillar
[57:29] of Fire that was on the bush that got
[57:31] Moses's attention to begin with
[57:33] and that was the same Pillar of Fire
[57:35] that landed on their heads on the day of
[57:38] Pentecost so they could also guide them
[57:40] and lead them
[57:42] so they could spread the gospel
[57:44] throughout the world
[57:45] and it's the same Pillar of Fire that's
[57:48] here today in this church in this city
[57:50] inside the hearts of his children you
[57:53] you are the children of the Church of
[57:55] the Living God and you got that same
[57:57] fire in you it was a promise that he
[57:59] gave you to you and to your children and
[58:01] your children's children and as many as
[58:03] far off will come it's a promise to you
[58:06] now you got that fire in you
[58:09] there's people in this city that needs
[58:11] that fire yes amen and God is going to
[58:14] blow the wind to spread that fire
[58:17] throughout this city and it's going to
[58:19] start it could start and it will start
[58:21] right here inside this church right here
[58:24] with a man with Direction
[58:26] so go and tell your family if you have
[58:29] it in your heart tell your family tell
[58:31] your friends this is a new day this is a
[58:34] new day that Holy Spirit that the Bible
[58:36] speaks about is not dead it is alive and
[58:38] it is working and if you don't believe
[58:40] me here's a little bit of proof that
[58:42] Holy Spirit went and got somebody it
[58:44] mapped him out of the way on Wednesday
[58:46] and he showed up to this place and it
[58:48] wants to bring more people to this place
[58:51] and I'm just proud to be a part of this
[58:53] I'm proud to know you all
[58:57] thank you brother I'm going to leave you
[58:59] with that I'm gonna let him get back to
[59:01] to his message here today but I just see
[59:03] it as a blessing that I was able to
[59:05] speak with you all and uh I'd like to
[59:07] just say God bless you in in uh I ask
[59:10] that he keep you safe for the rest of
[59:11] the day
[59:13] [Applause]
[59:19] amen
[59:23] he said
[59:25] do you think that they'd be blessed
[59:28] by me giving that testimony are you
[59:30] blessed
[59:34] can you can you believe
[59:37] it didn't map him to his house where he
[59:40] was sitting with his phone
[59:42] but it mapped him all the way from his
[59:45] hometown way way up there all the way to
[59:49] this place right here
[59:51] that's to me that was just what a
[59:54] tremendous Miracle do you remember I
[59:56] told you when the young lady is there
[59:58] when they stopped by the church
[1:00:01] I said that night I said God's doing
[1:00:04] something special
[1:00:07] and I said I just felt this I forgot it
[1:00:09] was Sunday morning or Wednesday I said I
[1:00:12] felt this heavy feeling all day that God
[1:00:15] was doing something and I was talking
[1:00:17] about
[1:00:18] about reaching out and I went to the
[1:00:20] subway and I was reaching out to those
[1:00:21] people and and it was just like Lord
[1:00:23] you're doing something I don't know what
[1:00:25] it is and brother you said it better
[1:00:27] than I did he's using this place to
[1:00:31] reach out
[1:00:32] to other people to bring them in to get
[1:00:35] them to Christ one day there'll be a
[1:00:38] last call
[1:00:40] and we want to be up and doing we want
[1:00:42] to be in the Lord's work so so he can
[1:00:45] use us to be that call for the people
[1:00:49] uh so it's just so so blessed and and
[1:00:54] hearing our brother and he put up the uh
[1:00:56] the Chamber of Commerce there and
[1:00:58] instead of wine fest
[1:01:00] you know and I was
[1:01:02] you you can't you can't make this stuff
[1:01:04] up my message this morning
[1:01:08] it part of it is about putting new wine
[1:01:10] in Old bottles
[1:01:13] and it's just it's it's just tremendous
[1:01:17] to see just to see brother Jonathan and
[1:01:20] you giving giving that note on Wednesday
[1:01:22] night and and the little things and
[1:01:24] these little things I believe it was in
[1:01:27] uh
[1:01:29] Ezekiel somewhere in the prophets it
[1:01:33] talks about this water starting to rise
[1:01:38] and it starts to come up and and he says
[1:01:41] it's it's a it's a place that you could
[1:01:43] Wade through
[1:01:45] and then the water the water continues
[1:01:47] to rise and then it's it's a place that
[1:01:49] you can barely get through and then and
[1:01:51] then the water comes up so high it's a
[1:01:53] place that you can never go through and
[1:01:54] that's how the gospel it's a Revival
[1:01:56] starts it just builds and builds and
[1:01:58] builds and builds moves forward
[1:02:01] and that's I believe and I pray that is
[1:02:05] the direction we are going as a church
[1:02:08] I don't think there's anybody more
[1:02:10] blessed
[1:02:12] amen oh I don't think there's anybody
[1:02:15] more blessed to hear that testimony
[1:02:16] brother Lionel than I am oh tremendous
[1:02:20] and nice to see is that your wife there
[1:02:22] sis God bless you welcome it's good to
[1:02:25] have you and I know your daughter this
[1:02:27] is good to see you too he's doing God's
[1:02:30] doing something
[1:02:32] and
[1:02:34] my my message this morning
[1:02:38] is about seeking God
[1:02:43] and be flexible
[1:02:45] I was yesterday I was
[1:02:48] really doing the best that I could
[1:02:53] in seeking him the the best that that I
[1:02:57] know how to get the Lord's attention is
[1:03:00] is to get away and and hike up in the
[1:03:02] mountains where there's nobody there
[1:03:05] and and maybe sit in the shade and and
[1:03:08] um
[1:03:09] and just pray
[1:03:11] and ask the Lord if he has anything for
[1:03:14] me brother Gabriel God bless you my
[1:03:16] brother it's good to see you another man
[1:03:18] searching for the Lord
[1:03:20] wanting wanting to get closer to God
[1:03:24] wanting to hear that voice brother
[1:03:26] Gabriel raise your hand
[1:03:27] God bless you my brothers good to see
[1:03:29] you it's good to see you here
[1:03:32] but
[1:03:33] so I was up there and and I was I get to
[1:03:36] this this little saddle and there's a
[1:03:38] place and I sit under sit next to this
[1:03:41] lean up against this rock and the shade
[1:03:43] of the tree and
[1:03:45] I was praying and I opened my eyes and
[1:03:48] and I looked across the Little Valley
[1:03:50] there and over on the hill I saw I saw a
[1:03:53] deer
[1:03:54] and I was watching this deer
[1:03:57] and then
[1:03:58] I see that that it was a doe and she had
[1:04:01] she had two fawns with her
[1:04:03] and I'm watching watching these three
[1:04:05] deer and just just enjoying it and and
[1:04:08] praying and and and seeking the Lord and
[1:04:12] I was like Lord
[1:04:16] you care about those deer
[1:04:19] those are your deer those are those are
[1:04:22] your little babies I said and I'm
[1:04:25] Apprentice I think that you care
[1:04:27] about them I think they matter to you
[1:04:30] and then the thought came to me well
[1:04:33] Jesus said that he cares about The
[1:04:35] Sparrows
[1:04:37] and if a sparrow Falls from from the sky
[1:04:41] God knows it
[1:04:43] and then Jesus said but how much more
[1:04:47] are you than a sparrow
[1:04:50] and I was I was praying on that and I
[1:04:53] was just I was just thanking the Lord
[1:04:54] that he let me see these these deer and
[1:04:56] and praying and then the thought came to
[1:05:00] my mind
[1:05:02] about a brother who asked that I pray
[1:05:06] for him a friend of mine not from here
[1:05:09] and he said he said I'm taking a leave
[1:05:12] of absence from work
[1:05:14] he says I'm going to go away and he says
[1:05:16] I'm going to turn off my phone
[1:05:19] and he says I'm Really Gonna seek God
[1:05:23] about some decisions that I have to make
[1:05:27] so I started I started praying for him
[1:05:30] and I thought that's that's just a good
[1:05:32] thing
[1:05:34] to to set aside
[1:05:36] all the world
[1:05:39] and just get quiet before God and seek
[1:05:43] God
[1:05:45] want to talk to him
[1:05:48] and I I think and as I was up there
[1:05:50] praying I was I was thinking Lord how
[1:05:52] great it would be
[1:05:55] the desire of my heart and it's been for
[1:05:58] a long time to sit down with God
[1:06:04] and talk with him
[1:06:07] maybe sit across the table and have him
[1:06:10] speak to me it's just it's the greatest
[1:06:13] desire I've ever had think of the
[1:06:14] creator of the universe one to set all
[1:06:17] the stars in orbit and set this Earth in
[1:06:20] rotation around the Sun and and he's
[1:06:23] surrounded by his ever is thrown by
[1:06:26] millions of angels that that he would
[1:06:29] sit down and talk to me
[1:06:32] I thought oh Lord that you would just
[1:06:36] talk to me
[1:06:38] that you could be there
[1:06:40] and I was thinking on some things that's
[1:06:42] been the desire of my heart for for such
[1:06:45] a long time on Friday evening
[1:06:49] Daniel and I were here and and um
[1:06:52] we were doing some things and brother
[1:06:55] Harney came by
[1:06:56] and we were sitting there and we were
[1:06:58] talking Daniel was picking his guitar
[1:07:00] and and brother Harney were and I were
[1:07:03] talking about the Lord and and brother
[1:07:04] Arnie said he started to weep
[1:07:08] it was just tenderhearted
[1:07:11] and he said he says he said brother
[1:07:13] Daniel he says I just I've always just
[1:07:15] wanted to sit down across from him and
[1:07:17] talk to him
[1:07:20] and he said but maybe that's just not
[1:07:22] God's way and I said brother Arnie it's
[1:07:23] the same thing I desire
[1:07:26] more than anything in the world I desire
[1:07:28] to talk to him to be with him
[1:07:33] and to have him talk back to me and Lord
[1:07:36] I just I just want to see you
[1:07:39] we had
[1:07:40] a few years ago Daniel and I were going
[1:07:44] to visit a friend of mine here at Tucson
[1:07:47] Medical Center Banner hospital his name
[1:07:50] is Chris Ayers
[1:07:51] many of you know the Ayers family and
[1:07:54] Chris
[1:07:56] got a a bacterial infection
[1:08:00] I don't know if it was in his spinal
[1:08:02] column or in his brain I forgot exactly
[1:08:05] where it was but he was paralyzed
[1:08:08] he's paralyzed he could move one arm
[1:08:12] and everything else was paralyzed
[1:08:14] because of this infection
[1:08:17] Daniel and I went to the hospital to
[1:08:20] pray for him
[1:08:22] this is I don't know what four or five
[1:08:24] years ago buddy something like that
[1:08:26] and and we go in there and his mom
[1:08:28] sister Ayers was there
[1:08:30] and
[1:08:32] I I knelt down and I got my I believe I
[1:08:35] had my Bible I opened my Bible to Mark
[1:08:38] chapter 16.
[1:08:40] and I said I said I want to read
[1:08:41] something to you Chris
[1:08:43] is an old childhood friend of mine and
[1:08:45] we've known each other since we were
[1:08:46] little kids I said I want to read
[1:08:49] something to you Chris and I turned to
[1:08:50] Mark chapter 16 verse 15 that they shall
[1:08:53] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:08:55] recover
[1:08:57] and I I opened the Bible said Chris do
[1:09:00] you believe that
[1:09:02] Chris said yes
[1:09:06] stayed there for a moment
[1:09:08] I said Chris I said in the name of Jesus
[1:09:11] Christ raise up your arm
[1:09:14] he raised his arm up
[1:09:16] you remember Daniel
[1:09:19] pretty soon he was he was sitting up
[1:09:23] in his in his bed a man that was just
[1:09:26] paralyzed
[1:09:28] we continue talking everybody was kind
[1:09:31] of rejoicing it was it was just a good
[1:09:33] feeling
[1:09:34] and before Daniel and I left Chris said
[1:09:38] this Chris said Mom
[1:09:41] he said I want to go home
[1:09:45] sister Pat said well Chris she said
[1:09:47] honey well we'll get you discharged and
[1:09:49] sound like the Lord it looks like the
[1:09:50] Lord's healed you and he said no Mom
[1:09:54] he says I want to go home
[1:09:58] oh
[1:09:59] So Daniel and I left and we were walking
[1:10:02] across the parking lot of the hospital
[1:10:04] Daniel was excited
[1:10:06] it's like wow dad did you see that yeah
[1:10:10] I saw it I was there you know and and we
[1:10:13] were both excited he said he said Dad I
[1:10:15] just I can't believe I was there
[1:10:18] and I said but buddy I feel like the
[1:10:20] Lord's gonna take him
[1:10:23] did you hear what he said
[1:10:26] I want I wanna
[1:10:28] go home
[1:10:31] time past Chris got out of the hospital
[1:10:33] he went into a rehab center
[1:10:37] the Lord Heal them of the whatever the
[1:10:39] bacteria was
[1:10:40] and then he took him
[1:10:42] a man about my age
[1:10:45] the Lord
[1:10:47] he just took him
[1:10:49] and he wanted I saw that desire and
[1:10:52] Chris I want to go home
[1:10:56] I wanna I wanna see him
[1:11:00] and thinking on that and how that desire
[1:11:02] should be in us but there's many of us
[1:11:06] there's most of us that don't even have
[1:11:08] that desire to see God
[1:11:10] that don't have that burning desire to
[1:11:13] sin as brother Arnie said to sit across
[1:11:16] from him and talk with him
[1:11:18] that desire is so rare in the world
[1:11:22] today
[1:11:24] Revelation chapter 3 it says behold I
[1:11:28] stand at the door and knock Jesus
[1:11:31] speaking
[1:11:33] and if any man will hear my voice he's
[1:11:36] pleading he's knocking
[1:11:39] and if any man will hear my voice I will
[1:11:42] come to him
[1:11:44] and I will sup with him and he with me
[1:11:47] brother Ernie he'll sit across the table
[1:11:49] with us
[1:11:50] have supper with us
[1:11:53] but it's so rare in the world today
[1:11:56] there's Jesus he wants he desires that
[1:12:00] Fellowship even more than we desire it
[1:12:04] but so few
[1:12:06] so few really want it so few that it's
[1:12:09] written
[1:12:11] here in this Revelation chapter 3 which
[1:12:13] is this age that we live in
[1:12:16] behold I stand at the door knock
[1:12:20] how many of us are seeking God on a
[1:12:23] daily basis Isaiah 55 verse 6.
[1:12:30] the Lord Isaiah the God's Prophet says
[1:12:33] this
[1:12:34] he says seek ye the Lord while he may be
[1:12:38] found
[1:12:40] call ye upon him while he was near
[1:12:44] while he is near what do you mean
[1:12:47] what do you mean when he's near
[1:12:49] there is a time that this time will pass
[1:12:53] that we are not able to call upon God
[1:12:56] we are given an opportunity and if we
[1:12:59] keep spurning that opportunity and he
[1:13:02] keeps knocking and knocking nothing
[1:13:03] that's pretty one day that knocks gonna
[1:13:05] stop
[1:13:08] and then there won't be any more
[1:13:09] opportunity but Isaiah says here seek ye
[1:13:13] the Lord while he may be found
[1:13:16] look at let the wicked forsake his way
[1:13:19] and the unrighteous man his thoughts and
[1:13:21] let him turn to the Lord and He will
[1:13:24] have mercy upon him and to go and to our
[1:13:27] God for he will have and he will I'm
[1:13:30] sorry let the wicked forsake his way and
[1:13:33] the unrighteous man his thoughts and let
[1:13:35] him return unto the Lord
[1:13:37] and he will have mercy upon him and to
[1:13:40] our God for he will abundantly pardon
[1:13:43] now listen to this
[1:13:46] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:13:50] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[1:13:54] Lord
[1:13:55] for as the heaven Heavens are higher
[1:13:57] than the earth soar my ways higher than
[1:13:59] your ways and my thoughts than your
[1:14:02] thoughts God is sovereign
[1:14:06] he has his way of doing things and our
[1:14:10] desires should be to get into his plan
[1:14:14] rather than making God fit into our plan
[1:14:19] it seems like when we when we call out
[1:14:20] to God when we're when we're seeking
[1:14:22] God's when we get in trouble
[1:14:25] but we should be seeking God all the
[1:14:28] time
[1:14:29] to have that fellowship with him but
[1:14:31] then there comes a time when we get
[1:14:33] hardened
[1:14:35] the things of God
[1:14:37] we get hard
[1:14:40] and then we will drive God so far away
[1:14:44] that we'll never see him again
[1:14:49] first John chapter 3.
[1:14:52] we we have to be careful we have to be
[1:14:55] flexible
[1:14:57] because remember our way of thinking is
[1:14:59] flawed
[1:15:01] we think that well Lord if I do this
[1:15:03] then you'll do this and then if you do
[1:15:06] this and all this is not a negotiation
[1:15:08] it's not a business deal we have with
[1:15:10] God his ways aren't our ways we don't
[1:15:12] understand the way that he does things
[1:15:16] but first John chapter 3 verse 1 says
[1:15:18] behold what manner of love
[1:15:21] the father has to bestowed upon us that
[1:15:24] we should be called the sons of God
[1:15:27] therefore the world knows us knoweth us
[1:15:30] not because it knew him not
[1:15:33] beloved now we are the sons of God
[1:15:38] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:15:41] be
[1:15:42] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:15:46] shall be like him
[1:15:48] for we shall see him as he is
[1:15:51] think about that word that we are now
[1:15:54] the sons of God
[1:15:57] what an honor what a thought
[1:16:00] that we would be his son
[1:16:04] and I think about I'm a father I'm a dad
[1:16:08] I've got two kids
[1:16:11] and I think about my son Daniel who's my
[1:16:14] best friend in the whole world
[1:16:16] we just we love each other we spend all
[1:16:18] the time we talk all the time we're
[1:16:20] together what If Daniel didn't want to
[1:16:22] be around me
[1:16:24] said I don't have time for you
[1:16:28] I mean how would that make me feel
[1:16:31] then my own my own son
[1:16:34] would would say I don't have time
[1:16:37] for my dad
[1:16:40] we are made in the image of God
[1:16:44] imagine how it makes him feel
[1:16:46] when we don't have time for him
[1:16:49] I'm too busy
[1:16:51] I have I have this going on you know
[1:16:52] what I don't even want to talk to you I
[1:16:54] don't like maybe what I read or what I
[1:16:58] hear from this book
[1:17:01] it doesn't fit my way of life dad
[1:17:05] you know it's old-fashioned it doesn't
[1:17:07] work today
[1:17:09] dad we've got a new way this is God's
[1:17:12] Eternal Word
[1:17:14] in this book it says that we are his
[1:17:17] sons
[1:17:18] and we should treat him like a father
[1:17:22] we should treat him
[1:17:24] like Daniel treats me he's always
[1:17:27] calling me and talking to me
[1:17:30] and wanting wanting fellowship with his
[1:17:33] dad
[1:17:34] and how much more should we want
[1:17:37] Fellowship
[1:17:38] with our lord Jesus
[1:17:41] we should diligently seek Him the Bible
[1:17:44] says Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 says
[1:17:46] this but without faith it is impossible
[1:17:48] to please him
[1:17:50] for he that cometh to God
[1:17:52] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:17:56] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:18:00] him
[1:18:03] we must seek God
[1:18:07] with all of our hearts it's so important
[1:18:11] because I'm going to talk about a group
[1:18:12] of people here
[1:18:14] that they're most of the people that
[1:18:17] have walked this Earth
[1:18:19] and Jesus describes these people
[1:18:22] and it's a very it's one of the saddest
[1:18:24] stories that you could ever read
[1:18:27] Matthew Chapter 7
[1:18:30] verse 1.
[1:18:33] says this it says judge not
[1:18:36] she be not judged
[1:18:39] for with judgment you judge you shall be
[1:18:42] judged
[1:18:44] with what judgment you judge you shall
[1:18:46] be judged and with what measure you meet
[1:18:48] it shall be measured to you again be
[1:18:51] careful what you say about other people
[1:18:54] because it might come right back right
[1:18:57] back on you
[1:19:01] and why behold us thou the moat that is
[1:19:04] in thy brother's eye but considers not
[1:19:05] the beam that is in thine own eye
[1:19:07] or how wilt thou say to thy brother let
[1:19:09] me pull out the moat
[1:19:11] of thine eye and behold the beam is in
[1:19:15] 909 thou hypocrite
[1:19:18] First cast out the beam out of thine own
[1:19:21] eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to
[1:19:23] cast out the moat out of thy brother's
[1:19:25] eye give not that which is holy unto the
[1:19:28] dogs
[1:19:29] neither cast ye Pearls Before Swine
[1:19:31] unless they trample them under their
[1:19:33] feet and turn again and Rend you now
[1:19:36] remember I want to set the stagers he's
[1:19:38] talking about religious people here
[1:19:41] and he's talking to religious people
[1:19:45] ask
[1:19:47] and it shall be given you
[1:19:50] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[1:19:55] shall be opened to you for everyone that
[1:19:57] asketh to receiveth and he that seeketh
[1:20:00] findeth and to him that knocketh it
[1:20:02] shall be opened
[1:20:04] knock ask the Lord Lord I need you
[1:20:09] Lord I want to talk to you Lord I want
[1:20:13] to fellowship with you
[1:20:15] and if he doesn't if you don't hear back
[1:20:17] keep knocking
[1:20:19] he that knocketh continually keep
[1:20:21] knocking Lord Lord what about me
[1:20:24] Lord I need to talk to you hey Hear Me
[1:20:28] Lord
[1:20:30] you say well is that disrespectful Jacob
[1:20:32] did it
[1:20:33] Jacob wrestled with the Lord all night
[1:20:36] long
[1:20:36] he said I'm not going to let you go
[1:20:39] until you bless me
[1:20:42] skip to verse 13.
[1:20:44] enter ye in now here is where it gets
[1:20:48] serious the whole time but this is where
[1:20:49] it gets really strong inner ye in at the
[1:20:53] Straight Gate
[1:20:54] for wide is the gate and Broad is the
[1:20:57] way that leadeth to destruction and many
[1:21:00] there will be that go in there at
[1:21:03] because straight is the gate and narrow
[1:21:06] is the way which leadeth unto life
[1:21:10] and few there will be that find it
[1:21:14] notice it's far fewer that find that
[1:21:18] life
[1:21:20] then go that broad way to destruction
[1:21:24] verse 21 skip to verse 21.
[1:21:29] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[1:21:33] Lord
[1:21:35] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:21:38] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:21:41] which is in in heaven
[1:21:45] that's it they say to me
[1:21:47] Jesus is Lord and they confess it
[1:21:51] they're going to come before me and
[1:21:53] recognize are they going to come before
[1:21:54] me and recognize me at the as lord
[1:21:56] they're going to know that I jesus am
[1:21:58] the Lord speaking for Jesus that they're
[1:22:02] going to recognize him that he is the
[1:22:04] Lord
[1:22:06] but not all that do that are going to
[1:22:08] enter into the kingdom
[1:22:11] many will say to me in that day
[1:22:15] Lord Lord
[1:22:17] have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:22:21] and in thy name there remember Jesus
[1:22:25] name
[1:22:27] and in thy name have cast out devils
[1:22:30] and in thy name done many wonderful
[1:22:32] works
[1:22:34] have we not done these things in your
[1:22:37] name
[1:22:38] have I not preached the gospel in your
[1:22:41] name
[1:22:42] have I not prayed for the sick in Your
[1:22:45] Name Lord
[1:22:46] have I not brought people into church
[1:22:48] Lord
[1:22:50] have I not done all of these things in
[1:22:52] your name
[1:22:55] and then I then will I jesus profess
[1:22:59] unto them I never knew you
[1:23:03] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:23:08] the Amplified Bible says this
[1:23:11] and then on if you keep that scripture
[1:23:13] up and then will I declare to them this
[1:23:17] is a another translation of that and
[1:23:20] then will I declare to them publicly I
[1:23:23] never knew you depart from me you are
[1:23:27] banished from my presence
[1:23:29] you who will act wickedly disregarding
[1:23:32] my Commandments
[1:23:35] I read that yesterday
[1:23:38] I was in my in my chair yesterday
[1:23:40] morning
[1:23:41] I was reading my Bible
[1:23:43] and I went to the trans other
[1:23:45] translations
[1:23:47] and I said oh Lord
[1:23:50] I immediately I got up
[1:23:52] and went into the to the bedroom and I
[1:23:54] got on my knees
[1:23:56] and I said Lord forgive me
[1:23:59] I said I don't want to be one of those
[1:24:01] people
[1:24:03] and it doesn't matter I've cast out
[1:24:05] devils in your name I preached the
[1:24:06] gospel in your name I prayed for the
[1:24:09] sick in your name and they were healed I
[1:24:11] I listened to tapes I passed out tracks
[1:24:13] I pastored a church and taught about you
[1:24:16] I raised good kids I told everyone I was
[1:24:19] a Christian and I recognized your
[1:24:21] profits when you're when you sent them
[1:24:23] and yet he still say depart from me you
[1:24:25] that work iniquity
[1:24:27] because I never knew you
[1:24:32] surely
[1:24:33] I can you and I I can know sister
[1:24:36] Shirley I can know about her I can know
[1:24:39] that that people say that that she's a
[1:24:41] prayer Warrior that that she's a good
[1:24:44] woman that she's she's always in church
[1:24:45] and I can hear all of these things
[1:24:48] about her but until I sit down and I
[1:24:52] fellowship with her I don't know her
[1:24:55] I just know what other people have told
[1:24:57] me about her
[1:24:59] and it's the same thing with God
[1:25:03] that he says I could come before him and
[1:25:06] say all these things he said who are you
[1:25:09] I've never talked to you
[1:25:12] I've never had fellowship with you
[1:25:15] I never knew you'd get out of here
[1:25:18] you're coming to me in my name and I
[1:25:21] don't even know you
[1:25:23] how do we know him
[1:25:25] we fellowship with them we seek his will
[1:25:29] we pray we talk to him
[1:25:32] we get to know him and then when we come
[1:25:36] on that day Lord I know you
[1:25:39] and he says son
[1:25:41] I know you too there's one thing I don't
[1:25:44] know about you is any sin you ever
[1:25:46] committed
[1:25:47] anything that you've ever done wrong no
[1:25:49] I don't know that I know you are my son
[1:25:52] I know that I love you because we've
[1:25:55] talked
[1:25:57] we've been together
[1:25:59] I know with Daniel we we talk and we we
[1:26:02] Fellowship all the time my my wife and
[1:26:06] my kids know me better than anyone else
[1:26:08] in the world why because they've spent
[1:26:09] the most time with me
[1:26:11] and it's the same with this scripture
[1:26:15] depart from me you the work iniquity I
[1:26:18] never knew you
[1:26:19] I don't care if you preached my gospel I
[1:26:22] don't care what you did I didn't know
[1:26:24] you
[1:26:26] you didn't spend the time with me
[1:26:27] fellowshipping
[1:26:29] what a disappointing day that is gonna
[1:26:33] be
[1:26:34] for many many people on that day
[1:26:39] I was
[1:26:42] talking to a
[1:26:43] a brother I just met him and never met
[1:26:46] him before
[1:26:50] recently
[1:26:52] and
[1:26:54] we were talking about some other stuff
[1:26:57] and then
[1:26:58] we started talking about the Lord
[1:27:02] and he said he said brother and came up
[1:27:05] in a different area and then I then I
[1:27:07] came up and as I said we never met
[1:27:10] and he said
[1:27:12] he said brother he says he said people
[1:27:16] in this message speaking about brother
[1:27:18] Brown's message
[1:27:21] if there's new people here if there's
[1:27:23] visitors here
[1:27:26] William Branham the one when I when I
[1:27:28] call when I call Brother Branham William
[1:27:30] Branham was a man that had the biggest
[1:27:35] Ministry
[1:27:37] in the whole world
[1:27:39] in the 1950s in the 1940s I'm talking
[1:27:42] carnally I'm talking just just naturally
[1:27:46] he would go to a city and fill up the
[1:27:49] largest stadiums in the city he was such
[1:27:52] a Gifted Man that that people would come
[1:27:55] and he could discern he could tell them
[1:27:57] what was wrong with them and millions
[1:28:00] thousands at least were healed in his
[1:28:03] meetings
[1:28:04] a great man of God and he stood against
[1:28:08] a denominational system
[1:28:11] he said you separate yourself God
[1:28:14] doesn't want you separated
[1:28:16] he said come out of that
[1:28:19] he used the scripture and pertained to
[1:28:22] do his ministry in Revelation that said
[1:28:24] come out of her my people
[1:28:27] come out of that mess that exclusive
[1:28:31] mess
[1:28:32] get out of that it's just going to lead
[1:28:34] you to hell you think because you're a
[1:28:36] Methodist or a Baptist or anything you
[1:28:38] think you're saved
[1:28:40] Jesus will stand there say depart from
[1:28:41] me
[1:28:42] I never knew you I don't care where you
[1:28:45] came from you didn't come to me
[1:28:48] you went to you went to your church your
[1:28:50] denomination
[1:28:52] when I talk about him that's the man I'm
[1:28:55] talking about I came up I gave my heart
[1:28:58] to the Lord listening to his sermons
[1:29:01] it's very special to me
[1:29:04] so this man he came from a a sect of of
[1:29:09] brother Brandon's Ministry
[1:29:12] and he said brother he said people were
[1:29:13] mean to me
[1:29:15] people were mean to our family
[1:29:17] he said they discriminated against us
[1:29:20] because we were part
[1:29:22] of the return Ministry Doctrine
[1:29:27] a return Minister you're meeting brother
[1:29:29] Branham is going to return and have
[1:29:30] another Ministry
[1:29:31] he says we were part of that and we
[1:29:33] believed that and people hated us for
[1:29:35] believing that
[1:29:38] I said well
[1:29:39] I said brother I said I know I said I
[1:29:42] was from the tapes only denomination
[1:29:46] I said denomination
[1:29:49] I was from the tapes only group and we
[1:29:52] believed that if you had a minister that
[1:29:55] you had to only listen to Brothers
[1:29:56] random States because if you listen to
[1:29:58] anybody else that was like Janice and
[1:30:00] Jammers withstanding Moses
[1:30:02] and you shouldn't you you shouldn't
[1:30:05] listen to anybody else but brother
[1:30:06] Brianna
[1:30:07] because he was the only he was the
[1:30:10] unadulterated word of God and if if you
[1:30:13] listen to anybody else it's like
[1:30:14] committing adultery
[1:30:15] I said that was my denomination
[1:30:18] I said that's your denomination brother
[1:30:20] Bram said I was Baptist
[1:30:22] and he says you're Pentecostal and
[1:30:24] you're Methodist he said but we're all
[1:30:26] Christians
[1:30:27] and I asked him I said all of these
[1:30:29] doctrines brother all of these doctrines
[1:30:32] that have gone around all of these
[1:30:34] decades I said what good have they done
[1:30:39] what good have they done except separate
[1:30:42] the people
[1:30:44] and cause that Division and caused that
[1:30:46] hatred that he has experienced
[1:30:49] and he said brother he says he says
[1:30:52] that's right and he's probably listening
[1:30:53] right now
[1:30:55] he said that's that's the truth
[1:30:58] he says done no good
[1:31:01] when we grow up in a certain way
[1:31:08] let me read let me read a quote from
[1:31:10] Brother Branham here
[1:31:13] brother Branham is talking about putting
[1:31:15] new wine in Old bottles and old wine
[1:31:18] skins it's their leather
[1:31:20] and and he was talking about I'll get to
[1:31:23] this in a minute but here's what he said
[1:31:25] he said if you say the baptism of the
[1:31:27] Holy Spirit was promised on the day of
[1:31:28] Pentecost to you and to your children
[1:31:31] and them that are far off even as many
[1:31:32] as the Lord Our God shall call which you
[1:31:34] quoted this morning my brother
[1:31:37] he said the old dry skin just bursts
[1:31:39] open
[1:31:41] and you lose your sermon
[1:31:43] that's right it doesn't do any good
[1:31:45] listen to this I'm ashamed
[1:31:49] that Pentecostal Skins are drying like
[1:31:52] that
[1:31:54] that's right come back to the word
[1:31:58] notice
[1:32:00] he said new wine is put into new bottles
[1:32:04] and the new skin has oil in it flexible
[1:32:07] and when the Holy Spirit comes down and
[1:32:10] says the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:32:13] the same today as it ever was Divine
[1:32:15] Healing is the same as it ever was that
[1:32:18] new wine begins to spread out and the
[1:32:21] skin gives with it every time the word
[1:32:24] of God is preached in its power the new
[1:32:26] skin will holler amen
[1:32:31] I'll give it right away so you see the
[1:32:34] wisdom in a new bottle
[1:32:37] for new wine on the day of Pentecost
[1:32:39] there was 120 new wine skins laying on
[1:32:42] the floor
[1:32:43] there you'll find out the old skins was
[1:32:45] cast out but when God came from the
[1:32:48] Heavens to fill the new skins they got
[1:32:50] new life and began to bounce all over
[1:32:52] the floor and bounce out the door and
[1:32:55] Through the Windows and into the streets
[1:32:57] and the new skins with new bottles new
[1:32:59] wine Holy Ghost wine poured out full of
[1:33:03] life just stretching and giving
[1:33:06] Oh Brother John I don't care what
[1:33:08] denomination you belong to I love you
[1:33:10] anyhow
[1:33:12] there you are I don't care whether your
[1:33:15] Oneness twoness threeness fiveness we
[1:33:18] are brothers
[1:33:20] that's the new skin
[1:33:22] whether we're assemblies Church of God
[1:33:25] these are denominations that were there
[1:33:29] whether we are assemblies Church of God
[1:33:31] Foursquare whatever we are you got to
[1:33:34] quote up there good so I'm gonna add I'm
[1:33:36] gonna so you know this is me whether we
[1:33:38] are a return Ministry or tapes only or
[1:33:40] seven Thunders whatever we are
[1:33:43] that new skin
[1:33:46] stretch Plum out and take in every
[1:33:49] brother there is around
[1:33:52] but the old cowhide won't do that
[1:33:55] that's right it won't do it
[1:33:58] somehow it just won't do it it's all
[1:34:01] dried and set and it'll burst
[1:34:05] Mark chapter two let's read about
[1:34:08] these wine skins
[1:34:12] says this Mark chapter 2 verse 18.
[1:34:17] and The Disciples of John
[1:34:19] and of the Pharisees used to fast
[1:34:22] and they come and say unto him why do
[1:34:26] the Disciples of John and the Pharisees
[1:34:28] fast but thy disciples fast not
[1:34:31] now look what happens this is the
[1:34:33] prophet
[1:34:34] of the hour this is the one that was
[1:34:37] spoken of by by Malachi the Prophet this
[1:34:39] is the one that was spoken of by Isaiah
[1:34:41] to come and introduce the Lord Jesus a
[1:34:45] great prophet in fact Jesus said the
[1:34:47] greatest Prophet that ever lived
[1:34:50] and these are the people they're saying
[1:34:52] well we learn this
[1:34:54] John taught us that we're supposed to
[1:34:56] fast
[1:34:59] this is a doctrinal issue that's
[1:35:02] separating the people even in this time
[1:35:06] and Jesus said unto them can the
[1:35:07] children of the bridechamber fast while
[1:35:10] the bridegroom is with them as long as
[1:35:13] they have the bridegroom with them they
[1:35:15] cannot fast
[1:35:16] but the days will come when the
[1:35:18] bridegroom shall be taken away from them
[1:35:20] and then shall they fast in those days
[1:35:22] remember now it's very important who
[1:35:24] he's talking to he's talking to
[1:35:26] religious people no man also soweth a
[1:35:29] piece of new cloth and uh on an old
[1:35:32] garment else the new peace that filled
[1:35:35] it up taketh away from the old and the
[1:35:38] rent is made worse
[1:35:41] and no man
[1:35:44] put his new wine into Old bottles else
[1:35:49] the new wine does birth birth the
[1:35:51] bottles and the wine is spilled and the
[1:35:53] bottles will be marred
[1:35:55] but the new wine must be put into new
[1:35:58] bottles
[1:36:00] so what he's saying my brother Adam used
[1:36:04] to make the communion wine
[1:36:06] in Jeffersonville and he had his he had
[1:36:10] like a lab set up and everything was
[1:36:11] sterile and and perfect and he showed me
[1:36:14] the different stages of making the wine
[1:36:18] and when the wine is just put in as it's
[1:36:21] fermenting there's life in it
[1:36:24] and it's just what the Bible calls new
[1:36:26] wine
[1:36:28] and and brother Lionel it's degassing
[1:36:31] it's moving there's life in that wine
[1:36:34] and
[1:36:35] it's it's it's
[1:36:36] it'll bubble
[1:36:38] and froth
[1:36:41] and once it's once it's ready they
[1:36:44] bottle it but it's still undergoing a
[1:36:48] reaction
[1:36:50] it's still it still has that life in it
[1:36:54] it's got that seed it's got that germ in
[1:36:57] there and it's it's still moving and you
[1:37:00] bottle it and back when they had the
[1:37:02] wine skins they would put it in these
[1:37:03] wine skins and they'd seal it and that
[1:37:05] wine skin would have to swell
[1:37:09] with this new wine
[1:37:11] because there's that life and it's still
[1:37:13] moving it's still it's still going it's
[1:37:15] still fermenting it would have to swell
[1:37:18] and that's when you open a you open it
[1:37:19] up because pop
[1:37:22] because there's still it's still
[1:37:24] fermenting in there
[1:37:27] and if you put it in an old skin that
[1:37:29] can't move it
[1:37:31] blows
[1:37:33] and that's what Jesus Is Telling he's
[1:37:35] telling he's like listen you have all of
[1:37:38] your doctrines you say that John the
[1:37:40] Baptist that he fasted and all this he's
[1:37:42] like listen
[1:37:43] be flexible
[1:37:46] don't put God in a box and make him
[1:37:49] agree make him fall under your way of
[1:37:53] thinking you seek God
[1:37:56] and be flexible and and move with it
[1:38:02] move and it's like talking with his
[1:38:04] brother well they don't worship like we
[1:38:07] do
[1:38:08] Flex
[1:38:09] it's all right
[1:38:11] well they don't look like we do Flex
[1:38:13] move
[1:38:15] it's all right well they're not
[1:38:16] preaching the same thing we are Flex
[1:38:19] let it let it move let God put that new
[1:38:24] wine into this vessel and let it let it
[1:38:28] accept it don't burst say I'm finished
[1:38:30] with it I'm done I don't want any more
[1:38:33] no
[1:38:34] check it with the book
[1:38:38] don't interpret it
[1:38:40] don't just look for something to condemn
[1:38:42] it check it here
[1:38:45] check it with Christ
[1:38:48] and if it doesn't disagree with that
[1:38:50] just wait
[1:38:52] maybe that's that new Holy Spirit Wine
[1:38:55] that's coming down
[1:38:57] it's not dead it hasn't been sitting
[1:38:59] there for a long time it's moving it's
[1:39:01] still fermenting
[1:39:05] the Bible doesn't tell us that we need
[1:39:07] to speak with tongues
[1:39:09] it doesn't tell us that we need to do
[1:39:11] Miracles it doesn't tell us that we have
[1:39:13] to listen to tapes the Bible doesn't
[1:39:14] tell us that we need to join a church a
[1:39:16] certain denomination or a certain sect
[1:39:18] of Christianity the Bible tells us that
[1:39:20] we need to believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:39:24] that is everything and then what what
[1:39:27] our brother was saying this morning he's
[1:39:29] reach out he says God's going to do
[1:39:31] something in this church I think that we
[1:39:33] can see it happening
[1:39:35] God's doing something but let's be able
[1:39:38] and I think that's why he's doing it
[1:39:40] brother Matthew is because we Flex
[1:39:43] we can move
[1:39:45] with it
[1:39:47] but when you're you're set in your ways
[1:39:50] and you say it has to be this way
[1:39:53] can't do anything he can't pour that new
[1:39:57] living wine into our into us because we
[1:40:01] can't handle it we'll burst
[1:40:07] oh yeah
[1:40:12] I better uh I got a lot more here but
[1:40:16] we'll uh we'll we'll maybe put it off
[1:40:19] into it into another day
[1:40:22] but think about
[1:40:25] this new wine this what a beautiful
[1:40:29] aren't you glad that Jesus used parables
[1:40:32] aren't you glad that that he he made it
[1:40:35] to where we can understand it
[1:40:37] and he's like listen you're stiff Don't
[1:40:41] Be Stiff
[1:40:42] well we have to have it this way and and
[1:40:45] I know I I was like that
[1:40:48] right buddy
[1:40:51] but I still live my do my best to live
[1:40:54] my life
[1:40:55] a holy life and and righteous before the
[1:40:59] Lord I want to I want to do things
[1:41:01] according to his will
[1:41:04] and
[1:41:05] um I'll tell a story of me and Stephanie
[1:41:07] over
[1:41:08] last week
[1:41:10] we went up uh we gotta got a way up in
[1:41:12] the mountains just to relax and and um
[1:41:15] kind of try to come down to earth a
[1:41:17] little bit
[1:41:18] um but it was saying that this guy's
[1:41:20] always moving he wants to he wants to
[1:41:22] get stuff done I do and I want to do
[1:41:24] more but sometimes you got to recharge
[1:41:26] the battery it's charged so we got to
[1:41:28] get back to work
[1:41:30] um
[1:41:31] so we're up there and and I said uh I
[1:41:34] said honey I said uh
[1:41:37] I don't know why I said it but I was
[1:41:38] like
[1:41:40] I want to go see a movie
[1:41:42] you know but I said I said I'd like to
[1:41:45] I'd like to go see a movie so Stephanie
[1:41:47] gets on her phone and she's going on
[1:41:49] there and and she says this she says
[1:41:52] um honey well
[1:41:54] I know you
[1:41:55] and this is the only one that you would
[1:41:58] probably consider seeing
[1:42:01] and it was a movie called
[1:42:04] is it thy only son
[1:42:08] his only son
[1:42:09] is about Abraham
[1:42:11] and Isaac
[1:42:13] and we looked at I said yeah I said we
[1:42:14] can go see that I think I think it would
[1:42:16] be
[1:42:17] acceptable and so so we go and we we see
[1:42:21] we sit down and we see this movie and
[1:42:24] and I'll recommend it
[1:42:26] if you can see it it's it's really it's
[1:42:28] it's just a it's a good accurate movie
[1:42:32] there's there's not much written about
[1:42:34] Abraham
[1:42:35] but this one I think it it
[1:42:39] paints a good picture of who this man
[1:42:41] was
[1:42:42] and there was kind of the one of the bad
[1:42:44] guys or kind of bad guys in in the movie
[1:42:47] and he asked Abraham he says
[1:42:51] he says you know he says why you went
[1:42:57] and you conquered those kings
[1:43:01] he says and these Warriors are with you
[1:43:03] he says no no these aren't Warriors
[1:43:05] he says these were just Farm hands these
[1:43:09] were just normal people
[1:43:11] and he says you went to battle
[1:43:13] and you fought
[1:43:15] these people to save this city called
[1:43:20] Sodom
[1:43:22] he said he says you win and and
[1:43:26] you fought this battle just and then you
[1:43:30] go and you
[1:43:32] bargained he didn't say Bargain but but
[1:43:34] you go and you bargain with God
[1:43:37] if you could just find a few souls in
[1:43:40] there would you save it
[1:43:43] and he says then God destroys that City
[1:43:47] he says why would you do that
[1:43:50] and I can't remember the exact wording
[1:43:53] that he said but he said something on
[1:43:56] the order of
[1:43:58] talking about the people of Sodom he
[1:44:00] said they're just like we are
[1:44:02] he said they put themselves
[1:44:04] first before God
[1:44:08] I thought
[1:44:09] oh
[1:44:10] that's what we do
[1:44:13] we put ourselves first
[1:44:16] and God will wiped the Slate clean he's
[1:44:21] done it before and he'll do it again
[1:44:24] can you imagine
[1:44:27] coming
[1:44:28] before God on that Judgment Day
[1:44:32] say I'm good
[1:44:34] I went to church never missed a service
[1:44:37] I I I I paid my tithes never missed
[1:44:40] never missed paying my ties
[1:44:42] I let a lot of people I I brought them
[1:44:45] to church I did all of this and him
[1:44:47] looking down at you
[1:44:49] say depart I never knew you
[1:44:52] how how do you know me I've never talked
[1:44:55] to you
[1:44:57] how would I know you
[1:44:59] and it's gonna happen friends
[1:45:02] God forbid
[1:45:05] that there'll be people in this room
[1:45:07] that face that
[1:45:09] chances are I will
[1:45:12] God forbid
[1:45:14] that
[1:45:16] but we have to as the Bible say knock he
[1:45:18] that knocks
[1:45:20] Lord I want to talk to you
[1:45:23] I wanna I wanna I Wanna Be There Lord I
[1:45:25] want to I want to talk I want to see how
[1:45:27] you are like brother Arnie was saying I
[1:45:29] want to sit across the table from him
[1:45:32] and that's the only way
[1:45:35] these others were casting out Devils
[1:45:37] they were doing Miracles they were doing
[1:45:38] all of these things
[1:45:40] and yet
[1:45:41] how could how could Jesus say but
[1:45:43] they're not going to say I never knew
[1:45:45] you
[1:45:46] such an odd thing but it's gonna happen
[1:45:48] it's written
[1:45:49] here
[1:45:51] the musicians would come and I'll close
[1:45:53] with
[1:45:55] a story for me
[1:45:58] it happened to me
[1:46:02] this new wine
[1:46:05] make sure that these are vessels
[1:46:09] that can take
[1:46:11] this Holy Spirit
[1:46:14] that the new wine often represents that
[1:46:16] spirit it's alive
[1:46:18] and it comes into this vessel makes sure
[1:46:21] that these vessels are able
[1:46:23] they're able to take it
[1:46:25] I was
[1:46:27] as I said I've always
[1:46:29] live my life
[1:46:31] kind of legalistic
[1:46:33] and and I still do I don't judge others
[1:46:35] but I I try to live try to try to toe
[1:46:39] the line
[1:46:41] I um
[1:46:44] let's go to Acts chapter 23 I mean
[1:46:46] chapter 26.
[1:46:50] something happened when I was
[1:46:53] leaving
[1:46:55] my old job
[1:46:58] I had quit resigned
[1:47:01] and I made up my mind I was going to
[1:47:03] move to Tucson
[1:47:05] and
[1:47:09] quit and then the next morning
[1:47:12] I was sitting
[1:47:14] sitting in my chair
[1:47:16] and I was reading
[1:47:18] the book of Acts
[1:47:20] and it says this Acts chapter 26 verse
[1:47:23] 13.
[1:47:25] this is Paul
[1:47:27] Paul when he's on trial
[1:47:30] before this King he says at midday and
[1:47:34] he's telling the story of what had
[1:47:35] happened to him he says midday O King I
[1:47:38] saw in the way a light from heaven
[1:47:40] above the brightness of the sun shining
[1:47:43] round about me and then which journeyed
[1:47:45] with me
[1:47:47] and when we were all Fallen to the Earth
[1:47:51] I Heard a Voice speak unto me
[1:47:53] and say in the Hebrew tongue
[1:47:56] Saul Saul
[1:47:57] why persecute us thou me I relate it to
[1:48:02] this man Paul
[1:48:05] very strict
[1:48:08] in his doctrines very strict in the way
[1:48:10] he thought not able to to move
[1:48:14] with the Holy Spirit
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:20] saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul
[1:48:22] why persecute us thou me it is hard for
[1:48:27] thee to kick against the pricks
[1:48:30] and I read that
[1:48:32] I said Lord There's Something About This
[1:48:35] Here I Am it's like five o'clock in the
[1:48:37] morning I I just left and I'm making
[1:48:40] these big changes Lord I don't know am I
[1:48:43] right in doing this have I made a big
[1:48:45] mistake
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:49] and I read that scripture
[1:48:51] saw saw why persecuted on me
[1:48:54] maybe it was Daniel Daniel why do you
[1:48:56] persecute me
[1:48:58] it's hard for you to kick against the
[1:49:00] pricks
[1:49:02] I was like well I don't know what that
[1:49:04] means seems odd it's hard for you to
[1:49:07] kick against the Pricks that that's is
[1:49:09] that like kicking it's a cactus or
[1:49:11] something and it pokes me back what is
[1:49:13] that
[1:49:14] and I looked and there was a note
[1:49:16] in my Bible
[1:49:19] and it said it said kick against the
[1:49:22] goads g-o-a-d-s
[1:49:25] I was like what is that
[1:49:27] well what's what's a goat
[1:49:30] and I did a little bit more research and
[1:49:32] I found that and I thought about shamgar
[1:49:36] and he took this Ox goat and he beat
[1:49:38] down all of these these Invaders with it
[1:49:40] and I said I said oh that's the same
[1:49:42] thing that that sham go used and it's a
[1:49:44] it's a it's a pointy
[1:49:47] thing
[1:49:48] that has a hook on it and you use it to
[1:49:53] push the cattle
[1:49:55] and if they don't go where you want to
[1:49:57] go you poke them
[1:49:59] and if you've ever had cattle
[1:50:01] when you give them a poke like that you
[1:50:04] better be standing back because they'll
[1:50:05] kick and it hurts if they hit you then
[1:50:08] hit
[1:50:10] then they're real quick with that but
[1:50:12] but you you poke them and they kick
[1:50:14] and if if you just go where I want you
[1:50:17] to go the end the end is inevitable
[1:50:22] they're gonna go through that shoot
[1:50:25] but they could save themselves a lot of
[1:50:27] grief if they wouldn't get poked
[1:50:30] and yet
[1:50:32] you kick against them and I thought oh
[1:50:36] Lord maybe that's what I've been doing
[1:50:40] that I've gone through my life and said
[1:50:43] it has to be this way and every time the
[1:50:45] Lord has tried to steer me or move me
[1:50:47] I've kicked against him and said no
[1:50:49] that's not the way I think it's supposed
[1:50:50] to be which is exactly what Paul was
[1:50:53] doing here kicking against God no no
[1:50:56] that's not this is this is the way I've
[1:50:58] learned this is the way it's got to be
[1:51:00] kicking fighting
[1:51:05] Paul says this
[1:51:07] I said who out there who out there Lord
[1:51:09] and he said I am Jesus
[1:51:11] whom thou persecute us but rise and
[1:51:13] stand upon thy feet for I've appeared
[1:51:15] unto thee for this purpose to make thee
[1:51:17] a minister and a witness both of these
[1:51:20] things which thou has seen and of those
[1:51:22] things in which I will appear in the
[1:51:25] which I will appear unto thee
[1:51:28] delivering me from the people and from
[1:51:30] the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee
[1:51:33] to open their eyes a love love this
[1:51:37] scripture
[1:51:38] to open their eyes and to turn them from
[1:51:41] Darkness to light
[1:51:42] and from the power of Satan unto God
[1:51:46] that they may receive forgiveness of
[1:51:48] sins and inheritance among them which
[1:51:52] are Sanctified by faith
[1:51:54] that is in that is in me
[1:51:57] I love this part
[1:51:59] whereupon O King Agrippa
[1:52:02] even though I've done all this stuff in
[1:52:04] the past
[1:52:06] and I was of this unflexible vessel
[1:52:09] the way that I was
[1:52:12] whereupon O King Agrippa was not
[1:52:14] disobedient to the heavenly vision
[1:52:17] and now things are changed and I look at
[1:52:22] us friends
[1:52:25] be flexible
[1:52:27] be flexible with each other
[1:52:29] be understanding
[1:52:32] be flexible also don't forget be
[1:52:35] flexible with God
[1:52:37] because his ways aren't our ways
[1:52:40] but he wants to fellowship with us he
[1:52:43] wants to fill this vessel with his new
[1:52:46] wine
[1:52:47] [Music]
[1:52:48] let's make sure that we can
[1:52:52] take that new wine let's be flexible
[1:52:55] let's stand
[1:52:59] [Music]
[1:53:07] it's good friends
[1:53:09] it's good to hear the word of the lord
[1:53:11] it's good to read his word and to see
[1:53:14] that that Jesus that he the reason
[1:53:17] probably because
[1:53:20] he went to so many sinners
[1:53:22] is because the other ones wouldn't
[1:53:23] accept him
[1:53:25] they had those Stony hearts
[1:53:28] but he went to those that would
[1:53:30] that would take his correction that
[1:53:32] would love him
[1:53:33] and let's make sure that we are that way
[1:53:36] it's Bower heads brother Jonathan my
[1:53:39] friend if you come and close
[1:53:45] think about
[1:53:48] think about my conversation friends with
[1:53:50] that with that brother that said he was
[1:53:52] returned Ministry
[1:53:55] these things they may be right they may
[1:53:58] be wrong I don't know
[1:54:01] but
[1:54:03] if they separate us they're not right
