[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] I am a friend of God. He calls me
[0:04] friend.
[0:06] [Music]
[0:07] Amen. We could we come.
[0:11] [Applause]
[0:14] Yeah. There's a great man in the
[0:17] Bible that was called a friend of God.
[0:20] And we all believe that we are sons and
[0:22] daughters of that man Abraham. Let's bow
[0:25] our heads. Our heavenly father, we are
[0:28] grateful to come here this morning in
[0:30] the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[0:33] Christ. Father, we pray that you would
[0:36] continue your blessings today as we read
[0:40] your word, Father, and we worship you.
[0:44] And Lord, we pray that you would open up
[0:46] this word to our hearts, to our minds
[0:49] that we might
[0:51] understand better. And father when we
[0:54] leave we pray that we would be like the
[0:57] ones on the road to
[0:59] Emmas and say did not our hearts burn
[1:02] within us as he talked with us by the
[1:06] way. Bless our congregation. Father
[1:09] bless our service this morning we pray
[1:11] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless
[1:14] you all. You can take your
[1:19] seats. Apologize about the
[1:23] uh our technical difficulties. It's just
[1:26] part of it when we're under
[1:27] construction. Appreciate I've seen
[1:30] brother Jordan. He's running back and
[1:32] forth and to and fro and here and there
[1:35] trying to get everything to where it's
[1:36] to where it's working good. Um it's uh
[1:40] it's probably gonna we're going to run
[1:41] into problems over the next month or so
[1:43] as we um get this all this work done.
[1:48] Um, welcome to our
[1:50] visitors. It's It's good to have It's
[1:53] good to have a group. I uh Where's
[1:56] Rihanna's family? Where's Where you at,
[2:00] sis? God bless you. Proud of your little
[2:02] girl. She did a good job this morning.
[2:05] I'm proud proud of her. She's got a
[2:07] really nice spirit. She's a She's a Oh,
[2:10] there she is. She's hiding behind
[2:13] there. God bless you, sis. Good job. We
[2:15] appreciate it. Um, welcome to all our
[2:19] other visitors. I see a couple faces
[2:22] that
[2:23] um that I don't know. Welcome to those
[2:26] in the back. God bless you all. Thanks
[2:28] for joining us. It's it's always an
[2:30] honor that you would come and fellowship
[2:32] with us and worship. It's good to see
[2:34] brother Bobby, Sister Ca here,
[2:37] Figureroa, and your family. God bless
[2:40] you, bro. We've prayed for you.
[2:47] Let me tell you something
[2:49] that these hardships that we go through,
[2:52] God's ways are not our ways and his
[2:54] thoughts are not our thoughts. He knows
[2:57] what's best for his people. And as I've
[3:00] been ministering on the past couple
[3:01] weeks that it's in the lowest times in
[3:05] our lives that God really speaks to us.
[3:09] And sometimes we suffer and and we don't
[3:12] maybe understand why, but we have to put
[3:15] it in back into God's hands and say,
[3:17] "Lord, you have a plan in all of this."
[3:20] And though my suffering might be great
[3:23] right now, Lord, I I would rather suffer
[3:27] and be in your perfect will than to be
[3:30] perfectly well and be outside of your
[3:33] will.
[3:34] So these times of suffering and they
[3:37] just, brother Bobby, they make us
[3:38] appreciate the good times so much more.
[3:41] Sister Cam, I know that you've been
[3:43] through it too. God bless your heart and
[3:46] thank you for your stand on our Lord and
[3:49] Savior Jesus. God God bless you. Is that
[3:51] the Johnson family back there? God bless
[3:54] you. It's good good to see you all. It's
[3:57] um it's just good. It's a good it's a
[3:59] good day to be in the house of the Lord.
[4:02] Also, um I didn't put in a prayer
[4:04] request, but when we pray, remember
[4:06] Sister Roseanne. Many of you know her.
[4:07] She's lives in Israel. Um hard time
[4:11] right there right now. Not only just
[4:13] with with the dangers as far as the war
[4:15] that's going on, but also she asked that
[4:18] we would also pray for her son. Um I
[4:21] guess employment's getting a little bit
[4:23] more difficult there. So, keep them in
[4:26] prayer also. Um it's a strange thing
[4:30] that's going on in Israel right now.
[4:32] Actually, I had a sermon
[4:35] uh that I felt on my heart to preach
[4:38] this morning and and
[4:39] then the um this we had this mel
[4:43] meltdown over in the Middle East again
[4:45] yesterday and I felt it would be best to
[4:48] talk about what's going on over there.
[4:51] And it's it's a serious time. We've been
[4:55] talking in our Bible studies on
[4:57] Wednesday night. We've been going
[4:59] through 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1
[5:02] and 2 Chronicles. Now, uh, brother
[5:03] Josiah went through Ezra and now I will
[5:05] minister or teach on Nehemiah on
[5:09] Wednesday and then we will go on to
[5:11] Esther. This is a period of time that's
[5:13] very very important that we understand
[5:16] because it has implications today. We
[5:19] need to know the history of what has
[5:22] happened in that part of the world which
[5:24] is basically the epicenter of any
[5:26] problem that ever happens. It always
[5:29] seems to come back to that little place
[5:32] called Israel and that little city
[5:35] called Jerusalem. That's why I believe
[5:38] in the psalm that David said, "Pray for
[5:42] the peace of Jerusalem."
[5:45] Because if peace is there, it seems like
[5:47] it just spreads everywhere. But if there
[5:49] is conflict there, it also spreads
[5:52] everywhere. So when we're praying for
[5:53] the peace of Jerusalem, we're also
[5:54] praying for the peace of the world. And
[5:57] remember, when this Messiah came, this
[6:00] Jesus, he was the prince of peace. He
[6:03] brought peace. And if we could just get
[6:05] back to him
[6:08] um in going through this Bible study and
[6:12] brothers and sisters, I would encourage
[6:14] you to come on Wednesday night. It's
[6:17] it's a blessing. We're we're learning
[6:19] some very very important things. We're
[6:21] getting really we're getting an
[6:23] understanding of the Bible and it's
[6:25] building this foundation and we've
[6:30] seen a cycle of sin that goes on in
[6:35] Israel. These sons of Jacob, as the
[6:39] Bible says, the sons in Jacob's name was
[6:41] changed to Israel. And we see how
[6:45] they're just beloved of God. That this
[6:49] man Abraham was promised this this
[6:51] promised land, this area that we call
[6:53] now Israel. And then that that promise
[6:57] came down through the
[6:59] ages and we see that it went through
[7:03] Isaac his
[7:05] son, Jacob, and then Jacob has these 12
[7:09] sons and that is what this this uh
[7:12] country of Israel is built on. And
[7:15] they're just God loves them. He just
[7:19] holds them to his bosom. And he still
[7:22] does to this
[7:23] day. And what has happened throughout
[7:27] history and we've seen it in our Bible
[7:29] study is we see a cycle of God's
[7:33] blessings and then the people become
[7:35] complacent and they they lose their zeal
[7:38] and then they start falling into sin and
[7:41] then the curses of God come upon them
[7:45] and then God will send a messenger to
[7:49] them and shake them up and get them
[7:51] right and then they will come back and
[7:52] they will start serving the Lord again
[7:54] and then they will cycle back again into
[7:58] into um sin and it just happens over and
[8:01] over again. And it comes back to I'd
[8:04] like to read out of Deuteronomy chapter
[8:06] 4. I think we're going to have to do
[8:08] this old the oldfashioned way and open
[8:09] up the good old
[8:11] book. Deuteronomy chapter
[8:16] 4 verse
[8:18] 25. It says this, and this kind of
[8:21] describes what has happened over the
[8:23] years.
[8:26] 4:25 For the Lord thy God is a consuming
[8:29] fire, even a jealous God, when thou
[8:32] shalt begget children and children's
[8:35] children, and ye shall have remained
[8:38] long in the land, and shall corrupt
[8:42] yourselves, and make a graven image or
[8:45] the likeness of anything, and shall do
[8:47] evil in the sight of the Lord thy God to
[8:50] provoke him to anger. I call heaven and
[8:52] earth to witness against you this day,
[8:55] that ye shall soon utterly perish from
[8:57] off the land, where to ye go over Jordan
[9:00] to possess it. Ye shall not prolong your
[9:03] days upon it, but shall utterly be
[9:06] destroyed, and the Lord shall scatter
[9:08] you among the nations, and ye shall be
[9:13] left few in number among the heathen.
[9:15] That word heathen is
[9:17] Gentiles. be left few among the heathen
[9:20] whether the Lord shall lead you.
[9:22] Amen. So we see that right there is this
[9:25] promise that God said like as long as
[9:27] you'll serve me then you will be blessed
[9:30] but when you stop serving me then you
[9:33] will lose those blessings of God. And it
[9:36] says here that it will scatter you among
[9:39] the
[9:40] nations. And going through our Bible
[9:44] study we have seen this happen.
[9:47] So what happened in around 7:20,
[9:51] 7:30 before the Lord Jesus came, the
[9:55] Assyrians came into the northern Israel
[9:58] and destroyed those 10 tribes. Took them
[10:02] out, took them into captivity, brought
[10:06] them out of their
[10:07] homeland, and scattered those people all
[10:11] throughout the Assyrian country.
[10:13] the
[10:15] scattering and
[10:17] really they never returned.
[10:20] They left and and one by one they came
[10:24] back in this modern day. And then after
[10:26] that, a couple hundred years after that
[10:28] happened, then we know the Babylonian
[10:30] exile when Nebuchadnezzar, this king
[10:33] comes in and he
[10:34] invades
[10:36] Jerusalem and these those 10 tribes were
[10:39] scattered. There these two tribes left.
[10:40] Now they're going to go and he takes
[10:42] them captive and brings them to Babylon.
[10:46] takes them out of their homeland and
[10:47] scatters them there even
[10:50] further. We know that we're going
[10:53] through we'll we'll start on Wednesday.
[10:55] Brother Josiah talked about Ezra. We'll
[10:58] talk about Nehemiah that they were able
[11:00] to return to their homeland. But this
[11:03] scattering
[11:04] continued all the way past Jesus. And
[11:08] then in AD70 really the final blow was
[11:11] dealt to Jerusalem when they had
[11:14] forsaken
[11:16] Jesus. And then in
[11:18] AD70 over a million Jews were
[11:22] killed in Jerusalem. So much so that the
[11:25] blood ran down the
[11:27] streets. This emperor Titus came in and
[11:31] and destroyed the city and killed all
[11:33] the people. And they they scattered
[11:35] again and they
[11:38] went around the world and settled in
[11:40] different
[11:42] places and that is what started what we
[11:47] call the gentile
[11:49] dispensation. So God had been with these
[11:52] Jewish people for all of this time. He
[11:54] blinded their eyes about
[11:57] Jesus and it allowed the message to come
[12:02] in to what the Bible says the heathen,
[12:05] the gentile people. And it started this
[12:08] period of
[12:09] time that the gospel was
[12:14] taught to a different people that were
[12:17] never really good in the Bible, that
[12:19] were never even noticed in the Bible.
[12:22] And that is this gentile dispensation.
[12:25] There's seven ages and it lasts for
[12:28] about 2,000 years. And now we are seeing
[12:32] the closing
[12:34] time of this dispensation. I know I'm
[12:38] I'm speaking to people that already know
[12:40] this, but I think that it's going to
[12:42] it's a very good review for what I'm
[12:44] going to say about what's going on in
[12:46] the Middle East right now.
[12:49] So what we see in the late
[12:52] 1800s, remember the dispersion had
[12:56] happened. What we see in the late 1800s
[12:59] is we see this movement called Zionism
[13:03] start to take place. And what that was
[13:05] was these people had been persecuted all
[13:08] the time, these Jewish people. and they
[13:10] wanted to come back to a safe place
[13:13] where they could raise their families in
[13:15] safety and not worry about persecution.
[13:20] Ezekiel 11:16 says
[13:23] this, "Therefore say thus sayeth the
[13:26] Lord God, although I have cast them far
[13:29] off among the heathen," again that means
[13:31] the Gentiles, "and although I have
[13:33] scattered them among the countries, yet
[13:36] will I be to them as a little sanctuary
[13:38] in the countries where they shall come.
[13:40] Therefore say, thus sayeth the Lord God,
[13:43] I will even gather you from the people
[13:47] and assemble you out of the countries
[13:50] where you have been scattered and will
[13:53] give you the land of Israel. A prophecy
[13:58] of what would happen in the last days.
[14:02] Ezekiel 36:24 says this, "For I will
[14:05] take you among the heathen and gather
[14:07] you out of all countries and bring you
[14:10] into your own
[14:12] land." Amos 9:14 says this, "And I will
[14:17] bring again the captivity of my people
[14:20] Israel, and they shall build the waste
[14:23] cities and inhabit them, and they shall
[14:25] plant vineyards and drink the wine
[14:27] thereof. They shall also make gardens
[14:30] and eat the fruit of them. and I will
[14:32] plant them upon their land, and they
[14:34] shall no more be pulled up out of the
[14:36] land which I have given them, sayeth the
[14:39] Lord thy God. Once again, a prophecy
[14:43] that they are going to return to their
[14:45] land after they have been
[14:48] dispersed. So, we see that this
[14:53] persecution starts on these Jews.
[14:57] Remember
[14:59] that sometimes many most of the time God
[15:04] will bring a persecution upon
[15:06] us because things are just too easy.
[15:09] He'll bring that persecution on us to
[15:12] get into his will because we're not
[15:15] praying enough. We're not spending
[15:16] enough time in the Lord. We're not
[15:18] really in his word all the time. So what
[15:21] he does as an act of kindness, he'll
[15:23] bring persecution upon us. So then we
[15:27] will seek the Lord and he will get us
[15:31] back into his will which is what started
[15:33] to happen there in the early 1900s. We
[15:36] see the
[15:38] Holocaust with World War II. We've seen
[15:42] six million Jews being killed and they
[15:45] had to run away from this. We see in
[15:48] Russia with Stalin and him killing
[15:51] millions of Jews. Also, we see that the
[15:55] God used the enemy to push these people
[16:00] back to their homeland because prophecy
[16:02] had to be
[16:04] fulfilled. Matthew chapter
[16:07] 24. I'm going to be here for a little
[16:09] bit so you can turn there in your Bible.
[16:12] Matthew chapter 24, verse one.
[16:22] And Jesus went out and departed from the
[16:25] temple. And his disciples came to him
[16:28] for to show him the buildings of the
[16:30] temple. And Jesus said unto them, "See
[16:32] ye not all these things. Verily I say
[16:34] unto you, that there shall not be left
[16:36] one stone here, one stone upon another
[16:40] that shall not be thrown down." So Jesus
[16:42] right now is prophesying something that
[16:44] was going to happen about 40 years
[16:45] later. All these beautiful temples that
[16:49] you see, all these beautiful buildings
[16:50] that you see, all these beautiful walls,
[16:52] Jesus is there was with his disciples.
[16:54] He he says they're all going to be torn
[16:57] down. And he sat upon the Mount of
[17:00] Olives. The disciples came to him
[17:04] privately, saying, "Hey, tell us what
[17:06] when shall these things be, and what
[17:08] shall be the sign of thy coming and the
[17:10] end of the world?" And Jesus answered
[17:12] and said unto them, "Take heed that no
[17:14] man deceive you, for many shall come in
[17:16] my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall
[17:18] deceive many, and ye shall hear of wars
[17:21] and rumors of wars, that you see that
[17:24] you be not troubled, for all these
[17:27] things must come to pass, but the end is
[17:30] not yet."
[17:32] So right here, Jesus is is kind of
[17:35] warning us, kind of slipping, slipping
[17:37] in, saying, "Every time you see
[17:38] Jerusalem and Israel go to war. Don't
[17:40] think that the sky is falling and this
[17:42] is the end and everything's about about
[17:44] to go, there's these things are going to
[17:46] happen. Israel has been war torn since
[17:49] they first started. So every time we see
[17:52] something happen over there, it doesn't
[17:54] necessarily mean that this is the end."
[17:59] But Jesus goes
[18:02] on, they, as I said, they've fought all
[18:05] of these wars in Israel. In 1948, as
[18:08] soon as Israel became a country, as soon
[18:11] as they were independent, the next day,
[18:15] all of their Arab neighbors attacked
[18:19] them. And God fought for Israel. They
[18:23] didn't have a They were just They were
[18:24] brand new. They didn't have a real army.
[18:26] They didn't have anything really. They
[18:28] were just excited to get going and all
[18:30] of their neighbors attacked them and
[18:33] they won the battle. God fought for
[18:36] Israel. 1967, the six- day war, same
[18:39] thing happened. 1970 war, 1973, Yam
[18:42] Kapour war, again going to battle
[18:45] against all of their Arab neighbors. The
[18:48] wars in Lebanon, the wars in Gaza that
[18:52] we've seen recently.
[18:54] But today we're seeing something over
[18:57] the past couple days, yesterday, we're
[18:59] seeing something that hasn't happened
[19:01] before really
[19:03] ever. And this is a new enemy that
[19:07] Israel is
[19:09] facing. Verse number
[19:11] seven, for nation shall rise against
[19:13] nation and kingdom against kingdom, and
[19:16] there shall be famines and pestilence
[19:18] and earthquakes and diverse places. All
[19:20] these are the beginning of sorrows.
[19:22] Then shall they deliver you up to be
[19:24] afflicted, and shall kill you, and you
[19:26] shall be hated of all nations for my
[19:28] name's sake. Then shall many be
[19:31] offended, and shall betray one another,
[19:33] and shall hate one another, and many
[19:36] false prophets shall
[19:37] arise and deceive many. These are very
[19:41] serious warnings that Jesus is saying.
[19:43] And a false prophet, friends, doesn't
[19:44] have to be something that you we think
[19:47] of like the pope or some great man.
[19:49] False prophet is anyone who will deceive
[19:53] you into following himself rather than
[19:57] following Jesus Christ.
[20:00] Don't get in your mind that a false
[20:02] prophet is some great man on a throne. A
[20:06] false prophet could be just a person
[20:08] within just a small group. Anyone that
[20:11] will lead people to themselves can fill
[20:14] that role.
[20:16] And because iniquity shall abound, the m
[20:18] love of many shall wax cold. But he that
[20:20] shall endure unto the end, the same
[20:22] shall be saved. This is it right here.
[20:25] This is what I want you to keep in your
[20:28] heart as we go through this morning's
[20:31] service. And this gospel of the kingdom
[20:34] shall be preached in all the world for a
[20:36] witness unto all
[20:38] nations. What is the gospel of the
[20:41] kingdom? The gospel of the kingdom is
[20:42] that God's Messiah arrived. Jesus Christ
[20:46] is God's Messiah. He is the savior. He
[20:50] fulfills all of these prophecies that
[20:52] were that were going to happen. And he
[20:55] is it and tell the world about me. That
[21:00] is the
[21:02] gospel. And this is what
[21:06] Satan, the enemy of God and the enemy of
[21:10] all of us, this is what Satan hates more
[21:14] than anything in the world. It's because
[21:18] Jesus will pull the
[21:21] people to himself and out of the claws
[21:26] of Satan. We see it all the time. We see
[21:29] it in this church how people are living
[21:31] down and and and not living right lives
[21:34] and Satan just has a hold of them. He's
[21:36] ruining their life through through
[21:38] addiction or or through marital problems
[21:40] or whatever it might be. And then we see
[21:43] people start coming to Christ and their
[21:45] lives change and they he brings peace in
[21:48] their lives and love and he brings
[21:51] happiness.
[21:53] Satan doesn't he hates that. That is the
[21:55] thing he is the most against in the
[21:58] world. All of his guns are focused
[22:01] against Jesus Christ and the
[22:06] gospel. And watch his tactics. Tactics.
[22:09] He'll put anything between you and
[22:11] Jesus. Satan
[22:12] will. When ye therefore shall see the
[22:15] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[22:19] Daniel the
[22:20] prophet, stand in the holy
[22:23] place. Whoso readeth, let him
[22:28] understand. Very important. Jesus,
[22:31] remember he's talking to his disciples
[22:32] here and he says, "Whoever reads this,
[22:36] let him understand." I believe he was
[22:37] probably talking about the book of
[22:39] Daniel. When you read that, you got to
[22:41] understand it. And he was also probably
[22:44] prophesying that these words are going
[22:46] to be written down and we are all going
[22:47] to read this. So let us understand what
[22:51] the Lord Jesus is is talking
[22:54] about. So so
[22:57] Daniel when Daniel was praying this
[23:02] prophet remember Daniel was in the
[23:04] captivity I talked about the dispersion
[23:07] the two of them how the first one's with
[23:10] the Assyrians and the second with the
[23:11] Babylonians. Daniel was a young man and
[23:14] he was brought into Babylon and Daniel
[23:18] prayed and what he did he prayed three
[23:22] times a day. He was he's a prayerful man
[23:24] and Daniel asked the Lord for
[23:28] understanding and
[23:30] wisdom. The book of James it says that
[23:33] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[23:36] God that giveth to men all men liberally
[23:40] and abrath them not. doesn't doesn't
[23:41] correct them and it shall be given to
[23:44] him. Ask the Lord for wisdom and it
[23:47] shall be given to you. So this is
[23:49] exactly what Daniel did way back here in
[23:51] the Old Testament. It's exactly what
[23:53] Solomon did. They asked for wisdom to
[23:56] give to the people. So when we are
[23:59] reading our Bibles, brothers and
[24:01] sisters, let's ask for wisdom that God
[24:02] will help us to understand it because it
[24:05] doesn't do us any good just to read it.
[24:08] The Holy
[24:09] Spirit should give us the understanding
[24:12] and that's what we long for. That's what
[24:14] we ask for. So let's skip to verse 32
[24:17] here. Jesus says this. Now learn a
[24:20] parable of the fig tree. And remember
[24:23] he's prophesying. These are things that
[24:25] are going to come to pass. Now learn a
[24:27] parable of the fig tree when its branch
[24:29] is yet tender and putteth forth leaves.
[24:32] Ye know that summer is nigh. So
[24:35] likewise, when you shall see all of
[24:37] these things, know that it is near, even
[24:41] at the door. So what the Lord's saying
[24:44] is that when you see these things come
[24:46] to pass, then the end is at the doors.
[24:49] And that is when you will see this
[24:52] second coming of Christ that's been
[24:53] talked about since Peter started talking
[24:55] about it way since Jesus ascended the
[24:58] first time. They started looking for him
[25:00] to return return. Now, most scholars
[25:04] believe that this is a parable. The fig
[25:07] tree represents the nation of Israel
[25:10] returning to their
[25:11] homeland, growing as trees grow and
[25:15] putting out leaves and and flourishing.
[25:17] Now, it was depicted also in a parable
[25:20] that the olive
[25:21] tree and when this olive tree was was
[25:26] growing, these are the Jewish people.
[25:28] This olive tree was cut off. When I
[25:31] talked about the beginning of the
[25:33] Gentile dispensation and the end of the
[25:36] Jewish dispensation there when Jesus,
[25:38] remember they were all Jews that
[25:39] accepted Jesus, they had this olive tree
[25:42] represented them. It was cut off and
[25:45] then God took another olive tree and
[25:50] grafted it into that stump of the olive
[25:54] tree and then that tree started to
[25:56] growing and that's us.
[25:59] We are we are represented by that that
[26:02] grafted in tree that has grown now for
[26:05] 2,000 years and the gospel has spread
[26:07] across the world to the gentile people.
[26:11] That's about to change because now this
[26:14] tree is going to give out a new
[26:17] branch. And Jesus is saying that he's
[26:20] saying that when you see this tree start
[26:24] to give out its branches start to bloom
[26:27] on its own. Now you see that the end is
[26:31] nigh. Brother Brandham said this. He
[26:33] said, "The Holy Ghost is the word of God
[26:35] in you that identifies." Remember I'm
[26:37] talking about the fig tree
[26:38] here that identifies itself by accepting
[26:41] that
[26:43] word. That's a good statement. The Holy
[26:45] Ghost is the word of God in you that
[26:48] identifies itself by accepting that
[26:51] word. Outside of that, it can't be the
[26:55] Holy Ghost. If it says it's the Holy
[26:56] Spirit and denies one word of the Bible,
[26:59] it cannot be the Holy Spirit. That's the
[27:01] evidence of whether you believe or not.
[27:05] No, not notice another great sign. The
[27:08] Jews are in their
[27:09] homeland, their own nation, their own
[27:12] money, a member of the United Nations.
[27:14] They got their own army. They got
[27:16] everything. They're in their homeland,
[27:17] which Jesus said, learn the parable of
[27:19] the fig tree.
[27:21] They are right back in their nation this
[27:25] day. This scripture is fulfilled. The
[27:28] Jews in their homeland.
[27:31] So we
[27:33] see
[27:35] through pretty much everyone we see that
[27:38] this fig tree and through the prophet
[27:41] brother Brandham, this fig tree
[27:43] represents Israel. And as it starts to
[27:46] grow and put out its leaves, that is the
[27:48] fulfillment of this prophecy that I just
[27:51] said from Jesus that when you see this
[27:53] happening, know that the end is
[27:56] nigh. Zechariah, let me read one more
[27:59] scripture. Zechariah
[28:01] 12:1 says this, "The burden of the word
[28:04] of the Lord for Israel, sayeth the Lord,
[28:06] which stretcheth forth the heavens and
[28:08] layeth the foundation of the earth, and
[28:10] formth the spirit of man within it."
[28:13] This is God
[28:14] talking. Behold, I will make Jerusalem a
[28:18] cup of trembling unto all the people
[28:20] roundabout, when they shall be in the
[28:23] siege both against Judah and against
[28:26] Jerusalem. And in that day will I make
[28:28] Jerusalem a burdensome stone. It's a
[28:31] heavy stone or an unmovable
[28:34] rock for all people. All that burden
[28:37] themselves with it shall be cut in
[28:39] pieces.
[28:41] though all the people of the earth be
[28:43] gathered together against it. So he's
[28:47] saying that if you mess with Israel,
[28:48] it's going to be a
[28:50] mistake, though all the people are
[28:54] gathered against it. So ask
[28:57] congregation, what's the deal with the
[29:00] United
[29:01] Nations? They have condemned
[29:04] Israel more than all other countries
[29:08] combined.
[29:11] Why does this this group called the
[29:13] United Nations, why are they always
[29:15] against this little democratic country
[29:19] in the Middle
[29:20] East? Could it be maybe fulfilling this?
[29:23] This this United Nations is supposed to
[29:25] represent all the countries of the earth
[29:27] and all the people of the earth.
[29:31] But it says right here, though, all the
[29:32] people of the earth be gathered against
[29:34] it. So we see this this United Nations
[29:38] always condemning God's people there in
[29:42] Israel. We see Arab countries executing
[29:45] people in the streets. We see Russia
[29:47] murdering anyone that desissents against
[29:49] the government. We see China and the
[29:51] slave labor and the child labor and all
[29:53] that. Why don't they condemn all of
[29:54] that? But they they shoot for Israel and
[29:58] they condemn them for defending
[30:01] themselves
[30:03] when they're attacked and thousands of
[30:05] their people are raped and murdered,
[30:09] children burned in their
[30:11] cribs. And then they condemn Israel.
[30:18] says, "And in that day I will make
[30:19] Jerusalem a burden burdensome stone, a
[30:21] heavy stone, for all people that burden
[30:24] themselves with it, and all people that
[30:26] burden themselves with this stone shall
[30:27] be cut in pieces, though all the people
[30:29] of the earth be gathered together
[30:31] against it." So all of these things,
[30:33] brothers and sisters, the way I'm lay
[30:35] I'm laying this foundation to say that
[30:37] all of these things have happened in our
[30:39] generation. All of those scriptures have
[30:42] been fulfilled when most of us have been
[30:44] alive.
[30:47] really all the way back. I mean, like
[30:51] with me, I was born in 1971. Many of
[30:53] these things have happened since then.
[30:55] Many of these wars in Israel, some
[30:56] people were all the way back to when
[30:58] Israel became a nation in the 40s
[31:01] fulfilling scripture. We are seeing
[31:03] this. This is the greatest time in all
[31:06] of history. And sometimes we just sit
[31:08] around like, "Oh yeah, they're getting
[31:09] attacked again. Boy, this could be it."
[31:11] One day it will be it.
[31:13] All of us are seeing the end times
[31:16] fulfilled before us
[31:20] with our own eyes and we don't get
[31:23] excited about
[31:24] it. Seems like the world just doesn't
[31:27] care. It's like, "Oh yeah, that's every
[31:29] church in the country, pretty much every
[31:31] Christian church says, "Oh yeah, this is
[31:32] prophecy fulfilled.
[31:37] Get
[31:37] out. Change our
[31:40] lives." If these things are happening,
[31:43] then we should be excited about them.
[31:45] That's right.
[31:47] So, what about
[31:49] Iran? We were It's always the Arabs that
[31:53] surround Israel that are coming against
[31:56] this country and constantly picking at
[31:58] them and and and terrorists and all
[32:01] these things. But Iran is quick to tell
[32:04] you, we are not in the Arab
[32:06] League. We are not Arab. We're not part
[32:10] of all of these people. We are
[32:13] different. So, who are these
[32:16] Iranians that are now attacking Israel?
[32:20] It's something that is far more serious
[32:22] than we might
[32:25] think.
[32:27] Remember Josiah's
[32:29] lesson on um
[32:33] Ezra a couple weeks ago? how the king of
[32:37] Babylon,
[32:38] uh,
[32:39] Belshazar was there and they took the
[32:41] cups out of out of what they had stolen
[32:44] from the from the Jews and they were
[32:46] mocking it and then this handwriting
[32:49] comes on the
[32:51] wall and it scares this Belshazar, this
[32:54] this king of Babylon to where his knees
[32:57] were knocking
[32:58] together and he couldn't even control
[33:01] his bowels as brother Josiah so
[33:03] eloquently stated.
[33:07] was
[33:08] afraid. So who came in? So he was seeing
[33:11] this handwriting on the wall and at the
[33:13] same time this foreign country came in
[33:17] and attacked Babylon and took over the
[33:19] country that was these people that we
[33:22] call the Persians,
[33:25] the ancestors to the Iranians. The
[33:27] Iranians are very quick to tell you, we
[33:29] are not Arab, we are Persian.
[33:32] So we see them come
[33:35] in and take over this
[33:38] country.
[33:40] And there was a I was I wanted to see
[33:44] show a picture of it. But when I was in
[33:46] Israel, I was I was sitting on the Mount
[33:49] of Olives and I was looking across the
[33:50] valley at the eastern wall of Jerusalem
[33:54] and I saw that it looked kind of
[33:57] strange. There was there was what what
[33:59] used to be a gate.
[34:01] um there
[34:03] and the
[34:05] um it was called the Golden Gate and
[34:08] what happened was this man this Ottoman
[34:11] from the Ottoman Empire back in
[34:14] 1541 they're not Persian but they were
[34:17] heavily heavily influenced by the
[34:20] Persian rule by the Persian
[34:23] um way of life. So what he did is he
[34:27] knew these prophecies of this eastern
[34:30] gate is where that the Messiah was
[34:33] supposed to come into Jerusalem as a
[34:35] high priest. So what he did is he just
[34:38] walled up the
[34:39] gate. You know that's going to keep him
[34:41] out. And then they planted a graveyard
[34:45] there. So I was sitting there I was
[34:46] looking and I was like what's going on
[34:47] here? So this guy comes up to me. He has
[34:50] a Make America Great Again hat on.
[34:55] Why is that
[35:00] funny? Um, and a
[35:03] USA Israeli pen. Turns out he's a taxi
[35:07] driver. And uh he uh he starts he starts
[35:12] talking to me and I was like holding on
[35:14] to my wallet and
[35:16] um and he turned out to be a great guy
[35:20] and and he he starts telling me he's
[35:22] he's a tremendous historian and he says
[35:25] that do you see the the bricks in that
[35:27] gate across the valley? I said yeah. And
[35:28] he tells me the story about how this
[35:32] Ottoman ruler bricked it up and then he
[35:35] planted the graveyard there in front
[35:37] because the high priest he said couldn't
[35:39] walk across the graves, walk across the
[35:42] dead people. So as he was telling me
[35:47] that it's it's it's amazing there's a
[35:51] spirit that's against this Messiah.
[35:56] So, the Persians way back, the Persians
[35:58] invaded Babylon
[36:01] um after Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazar
[36:03] and then the prophet Daniel, he's there
[36:05] and he's seeking the Lord. Now, this is
[36:07] what I want to get to. This is my lesson
[36:09] this morning. Let's all turn to Daniel
[36:11] chapter
[36:14] 10. One of the most amazing stories in
[36:17] the
[36:19] Bible. Daniel chapter 10 verse one. The
[36:23] third year of Cyrus the king of
[36:26] Persia, a thing was revealed unto
[36:29] Daniel, whose name was called Bel
[36:32] Beltazzer, and the thing was true. But
[36:34] the appointed time was long, and he
[36:36] understood the the thing and had
[36:39] understanding of the vision. Now we're
[36:40] on trans. Now we will transition from
[36:43] third person to now first person. Daniel
[36:46] himself is going to be telling this
[36:47] story. In those days I, Daniel, was
[36:50] mourning three full weeks. I ate no
[36:52] pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor
[36:55] wine in my mouth. Neither did I anoint
[36:57] myself at all till three weeks were
[36:59] fulfilled. That's 21
[37:02] days. This great sadness was upon
[37:05] Daniel. He had a burden.
[37:09] And in the fourth and 20th day of the
[37:11] month, as I as I was by the side of the
[37:15] great river, which is called which is
[37:16] Hiddakel, then I lifted up mine eyes and
[37:20] looked, and behold, a certain man
[37:21] clothed in linen, whose loins were
[37:23] girded with with fine gold of
[37:27] Ufaz, and his body also was like the
[37:32] like the barrel, and his face as the
[37:34] appearance of lightning, and his eyes of
[37:36] lamps of fire, and his arms, and his
[37:38] feet like in the color of polished
[37:40] brass, and the voice of his words like
[37:42] unto the voice of the multitude. And I,
[37:44] Daniel, alone, saw the vision. For the
[37:46] men that were with me saw not the
[37:48] vision, but a great quaking fell upon
[37:51] them, so that they fled to hide
[37:53] themselves. Now, this angel is coming to
[37:56] Daniel, and just his
[37:58] presence is so full of power. Therefore,
[38:02] I was left alone, and I saw a great
[38:04] vision, and there remained no strength
[38:07] in me, for my comeliness was turned in
[38:10] me to corruption, that everything good
[38:12] about me was turned into corruption, and
[38:16] I retained no strength. Yet I heard, yet
[38:20] heard I the voice of his words. And when
[38:22] I heard the voice of his words, then I
[38:24] was in a deep sleep upon my face, and my
[38:28] face toward the ground. and
[38:30] behold a hand touched
[38:33] me which set me up on my knees and upon
[38:36] the palms of my hands. So this present
[38:39] this presence of this angel is so
[38:41] powerful. Daniel just loses
[38:43] consciousness and he's lay laying on his
[38:45] stomach and this angel comes up and
[38:48] picks him up and brings him to where
[38:49] he's on his hands and his knees. I'm
[38:51] sure he's
[38:52] quivering and what's going on right
[38:54] here. And he said unto me, "Oh Daniel, a
[38:59] man greatly
[39:00] beloved, understand the words that I
[39:02] speak unto thee, and stand upright, for
[39:06] unto thee am I now sent." And when he
[39:08] had spoken this word unto me, I stood
[39:11] trembling. Then said he unto me, "Fear
[39:13] not, Daniel, for from the time that thou
[39:16] didest set thine heart to understand,
[39:19] and to chasen thyself before thy God,
[39:22] thy words were heard, and I am come for
[39:25] thy word." So three weeks ago, Daniel,
[39:28] when you started fasting, when you
[39:30] started praying, three weeks ago, I was
[39:33] dispatched to come to you.
[39:37] Didn't matter to
[39:38] Daniel. He was going to wait for however
[39:40] long it took.
[39:42] He was praying and seeking wisdom and
[39:45] seeking understanding from the
[39:47] Lord. God knew all that was going on,
[39:51] but he allowed it so that we could read
[39:53] this today about this formidable
[39:56] opponent that I'm about to mention.
[40:00] So then Daniel goes on or this angel
[40:02] that's speaking to Daniel goes on, "But
[40:05] the prince of the kingdom of Persia
[40:08] withtood me one and 20
[40:11] days." But lo, Michael, one of the chief
[40:14] princes, came to help me, and I remained
[40:17] there with the kings of Persia. So this
[40:19] angel would have come to Daniel the
[40:21] first moment that he started praying. He
[40:23] went out and notice that this this
[40:27] adversary that Daniel that Daniel's
[40:30] saying, he calls him a
[40:32] prince. All right? He's talking about a
[40:36] demon here and a very very powerful
[40:40] demon. This prince of
[40:43] Persia, this prince of Persia is so
[40:45] powerful that Gabriel had to call out to
[40:48] another prince, Michael, to help him.
[40:55] Then Michael comes to his
[40:59] aid. So then Daniel goes then the angel
[41:02] goes on to Daniel. Now I am come to make
[41:04] thee
[41:04] understand what shall befall thy people
[41:07] in the latter days for the vision is for
[41:11] the for yet the vision is for many days.
[41:16] So
[41:17] why is it important for this prince of
[41:21] Persia, this demon? Why is it important
[41:24] to stop this angel from getting to
[41:27] Daniel? I believe that we're going to
[41:29] see that why we are seeing
[41:31] Iran so strongly against Israel
[41:37] today. And when he had spoken such
[41:40] words, I set my face toward the ground
[41:42] and became dumb.
[41:45] And behold, one like the simultude of
[41:46] the sons of men touched my lips. And
[41:48] then I opened my mouth and spake. And he
[41:50] said unto and said unto him that stood
[41:52] before me, "Oh my Lord, by the vision my
[41:54] sorrows are turned upon me, and I have
[41:56] retained no strength. For how can the
[41:59] servant of this my lord talk with this
[42:03] my lord? For as for me, straightway
[42:06] there remain no strength in me, neither
[42:08] is there breath left in me." Then there
[42:10] came again and touched me one like the
[42:14] appearance of a man and strengthened me.
[42:17] And said, "Oh man greatly, beloved, fear
[42:20] not. Peace be unto thee. Be strong. Yay,
[42:22] be
[42:23] strong." And when he had spoken to me, I
[42:26] was strengthened and said, "Let my Lord
[42:29] speak, for thou hast strengthened me."
[42:32] Then said he, knowest thou, wherefore I
[42:35] come unto thee, and now will I return to
[42:38] fight with the prince of Persia? And
[42:41] when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of
[42:43] Grecia shall
[42:44] come. So there are things going on
[42:48] behind the scenes. Then the angel
[42:50] continues on, but I will show thee that
[42:52] which is noted of the scripture of
[42:54] truth, and there is none that holdeth
[42:56] with me these things, but Michael your
[43:00] prince.
[43:03] what just happened? So, let me summarize
[43:07] this. So, Daniel, he has this burden on
[43:10] on his heart. He says, "Lord, I need to
[43:12] understand your scriptures. I need to
[43:13] know what's going on." So, he starts
[43:15] fasting and he starts praying. And then
[43:18] 21 days later, this angel comes that is
[43:22] so powerful that it just knocks him out
[43:25] and he's laying out unconscious on his
[43:27] on his face. And the angel picks him up
[43:30] and he gets up on his hands and knees
[43:32] and he and he says, "Daniel, I would
[43:34] have come. I would have been there. But
[43:37] this this angel, this
[43:40] prince, he withtood
[43:45] me." The power of this angel that was
[43:48] talking to Daniel and then this prince
[43:49] of Persia was just as powerful. Brothers
[43:53] and sisters, there's things going on in
[43:55] our lives. There's things going on in
[43:57] this world where we don't understand
[44:00] them. There's powers that are fighting
[44:03] against each other. Ephesians 6 says,
[44:05] "We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[44:08] but we wrestle against
[44:10] principalities, against spiritual
[44:12] wickedness in high places." That is
[44:14] what's going on here.
[44:17] Daniel was this angel was wrestling
[44:19] against this prince of Persia, this
[44:22] demon fighting. One is for God and the
[44:25] other is against
[44:27] God. So we have to look and say, well,
[44:30] what was the message that was so
[44:32] important that this angel was going to
[44:34] give Daniel that this prince of Persia
[44:37] came and fought him against fought
[44:39] against him to prevent him from coming?
[44:42] And we look and we see that he didn't
[44:44] even really deliver a message. What he
[44:48] gave Daniel was what he prayed for,
[44:51] which is understanding.
[44:55] Understanding
[44:56] is way better than just getting the uh
[45:01] one simple answer. If you are given
[45:04] wisdom and understanding, then you can
[45:07] open this Bible and you can pray about
[45:09] it. And it's not just one answer you
[45:11] receive, but you will continue to get
[45:12] answers and answers and answers if you
[45:15] have that same attitude that Daniel had.
[45:18] So this angel brings this message to
[45:20] Daniel fights with this this
[45:23] demon over and and and Michael comes to
[45:26] help him, another powerful angel.
[45:28] There's things going on, brothers and
[45:30] sisters, right now that we have no idea.
[45:33] I have we're not we don't understand
[45:36] those things. And they're going on in
[45:38] the Middle East right now. And they're
[45:39] going on for a very specific purpose.
[45:42] So what what is that purpose? Here comes
[45:45] this angel. Daniel gets this
[45:48] understanding and then Daniel brings a
[45:51] message to his
[45:53] people. That message Daniel 11 was
[45:57] here's what's going to happen right
[45:58] away.
[46:00] And
[46:02] then in Daniel 12, and here is what's
[46:05] going to happen way down the
[46:10] road. The whole
[46:13] thing is Daniel is prophesying in 12
[46:18] about a
[46:19] deliverer, about a Christ that is to
[46:22] come. Daniel 12:1, we'll read a little
[46:24] bit of it. Daniel 12:1 says this, "And
[46:28] at that time Michael shall stand up, the
[46:31] great prince which standeth for the
[46:33] children of thy people, and there shall
[46:34] be a time of trouble such as never was
[46:37] since there was a nation even unto that
[46:40] time at that time thy people shall be
[46:43] delivered, everyone that shall be found
[46:45] written in the book." Amen.
[46:51] Familiar verse to us because we read it
[46:54] out of Revelation chapter
[46:56] 5. And many of them that sleep in the
[46:58] dust of the earth shall awake, some to
[47:01] everlasting life, and some to
[47:02] everlasting contempt. And they shall and
[47:05] they that be wise shall s shine as the
[47:07] brightness of the firminant. And they
[47:09] shall and they that turn many to
[47:12] righteousness as the stars forever and
[47:14] ever. But thou, oh Daniel, shut up the
[47:17] words and seal the
[47:19] book even to the time of the end, and
[47:22] many shall run to and fro, and knowledge
[47:24] shall be increased. So he's saying, seal
[47:27] this up, this
[47:29] book. And then later on, this book would
[47:32] be broken. And you can see why this
[47:34] prince of Persia was fighting this angel
[47:37] because he didn't want these
[47:41] Jews to receive redemption.
[47:44] He didn't want to see them receive their
[47:46] Messiah. Now we come all the way down to
[47:50] today
[47:52] Iran. This
[47:54] Islamic teaching that they have, this
[47:58] crazy
[48:00] violent way that they have, these people
[48:03] 50 years ago, they supported the Jews.
[48:06] There was many Jews that lived in Iran.
[48:09] They supported the United States. And
[48:11] now we see it looks like this same
[48:16] spirit, this powerful spirit is doing
[48:19] the same thing because as I said, the
[48:22] fig tree is ripening. It's time for the
[48:25] Jews to receive their
[48:28] Messiah. It's time for the Gentile
[48:30] dispensation to end. And now we see the
[48:33] prince of Persia coming in and fighting
[48:36] with everything that he can to destroy
[48:39] this place. So they don't receive this
[48:42] Messiah. It's coming pretty soon. Our
[48:45] time is going to be over. Amen. The
[48:49] Gentile dispensation is going to
[48:51] cease very plainly and then that spirit
[48:56] is going to come to the
[48:58] Jews and then they are going to accept
[49:01] their
[49:02] savior. And we see the same thing. It
[49:05] looks like the same thing is happening.
[49:07] Now, this prince of Persia, he is going
[49:09] to battle. Now, there's a spiritual
[49:11] battle going on that I don't claim to
[49:14] understand. I don't I don't know what's
[49:15] going on, but I know that it's there
[49:17] because the Bible says that it's
[49:19] there. And these spirits are influencing
[49:23] people on earth. And it's not just us.
[49:26] We're not the only ones on earth.
[49:30] It's things going on around the world
[49:33] that these influences are happening.
[49:37] and the love of God's
[49:40] life, his
[49:43] his
[49:44] friends song about that um about being a
[49:48] friend of God. His friends are there and
[49:50] he wants them to receive their
[49:52] salvation. He wants them to receive this
[49:54] Messiah. He blinded their eyes for a
[49:57] space of time so that we might receive
[49:59] it. But now it's time to go back to them
[50:01] and look, the enemy hates it and he is
[50:04] going to fight with everything that he
[50:05] can to prevent it. Even if it means
[50:07] destroying that country,
[50:11] it's all about Jesus.
[50:13] As I always say, it all comes down to
[50:17] Christ
[50:19] and the enemy is fighting against it
[50:21] right now.
[50:24] Revelation chapter
[50:26] 5,
[50:29] John was a
[50:32] Jew and he understood these things that
[50:36] Jesus taught. He understood that Jesus
[50:39] was the Messiah, that Jesus was the
[50:41] savior. But here in Revelation chapter
[50:43] 5, when John is on the aisle of Patmas
[50:45] after everything had happened and here's
[50:47] the old man, he remembered Jesus and and
[50:50] and he knew all of these these blessings
[50:53] and and he saw Jesus rose from the dead
[50:55] and now he is on this aisle of Patmas
[50:57] and he has this
[51:01] vision of a very very hard
[51:05] thing. It looks like I don't know that
[51:07] it is, but it looks like it's the same
[51:09] book that Daniel was talking
[51:13] about. Very simple. It's probably just a
[51:15] book of
[51:17] names. Those names are written on the
[51:19] lamb's book of
[51:21] life. But they're
[51:24] sealed. And they can't be there can no
[51:26] salvation can come until they are
[51:28] unsealed.
[51:30] And I saw in the right hand of him that
[51:33] sat on the throne a book written within
[51:36] and on the backside sealed with seven
[51:38] seals. And I saw a strong angel
[51:40] proclaimed with a loud voice, "Who is
[51:42] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[51:44] seals thereof? And no man in heaven nor
[51:46] on earth, neither under the earth, was
[51:47] able to open the book, neither could
[51:49] even look
[51:51] thereon." And I wept much.
[51:54] John, this beloved disciple that was
[51:57] with Jesus. And I wept much because no
[51:59] man was found worthy to open and to read
[52:02] the
[52:03] book, neither even to look on
[52:06] it. What a sad
[52:09] thing. Of course, he
[52:11] wept. All that he stood for was
[52:14] lost. Everything that
[52:17] John believed had all come to not.
[52:22] believe Jesus was the Messiah and the
[52:24] savior. But still, there's nobody worthy
[52:25] to open the
[52:27] book. There's no redemption without this
[52:30] book.
[52:33] Everything he had preached, salvation
[52:36] was lost. There was no
[52:38] redemption. You can see what a letown.
[52:40] That's this is like the ultimate
[52:43] letdown in all of history. And there is
[52:46] John like I thought we had it.
[52:51] There's nobody that's worthy of opening
[52:53] this
[52:55] book. My
[52:57] name might be in there. My children's
[53:00] name, my loved ones, my mom, my dad.
[53:04] It's in that book and no one can open
[53:06] it. We're
[53:09] lost. He wept
[53:11] much. One of the elders saith unto me,
[53:14] "Weep not."
[53:18] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[53:21] the root of David, hath prevailed to
[53:23] open the book, and to loose the seven
[53:25] seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in
[53:29] the midst of the throne, and of the four
[53:31] beasts, and of the midst of the elders
[53:33] stood a lamb,
[53:35] as it had been slain. It was a bloody
[53:37] lamb and it was someone that looked very
[53:39] familiar to
[53:41] John having seven horns and seven eyes
[53:44] which are the seven spirits of God set
[53:45] forth into all the earth. And he came
[53:47] and took the book out of the right hand
[53:49] of him that sat upon the
[53:51] throne. This was that Jesus Christ. This
[53:55] was the one that had
[53:58] redemption. These are the prophecies,
[54:00] brothers and sisters. These are the
[54:02] prophecies that are being fulfilled
[54:03] before our eyes that this man Jesus
[54:07] Christ, he took the book, he broke the
[54:10] seals. There is the the the book of life
[54:14] there. Our names. John said, brother
[54:16] Brandham said, John probably looked in
[54:18] there. He probably saw his name in there
[54:20] and he shouted so loud that all heavens
[54:23] heard
[54:25] him. But here we are. This man, Jesus,
[54:28] he's everything.
[54:30] And here's the prince of Persia. He's
[54:33] trying to hinder Daniel. He didn't want
[54:36] he didn't want this understanding to go
[54:37] out. And he's doing it looks like he's
[54:40] doing the same thing over there in
[54:43] destroying. Where did this hatred come
[54:46] from of Israel? Iran's not even a
[54:49] neighbor. It's over there a
[54:51] ways. But it's it's it's this death to
[54:54] Israel, death to the West. Kill them.
[54:57] Destroy them. Why? It's it's influenced
[55:02] by a very powerful powerful demon.
[55:06] And let me tell you, there's still a
[55:07] Gabriel standing there. There's still a
[55:10] Michael and there is a Jesus Christ. And
[55:13] he'll let it go as long as it he has to
[55:17] until they receive it.
[55:19] So, in
[55:23] closing, I want to
[55:25] read a little bit about what's going to
[55:29] happen with these
[55:32] Jews. There's um as we in our Bible
[55:35] study, we we understand
[55:38] that the gospels were written in the
[55:40] book of or were written in the language
[55:43] of Greek so that everyone could
[55:44] understanding understand it. Or there's
[55:46] also this book of
[55:48] Hebrews. And this book of Hebrews was
[55:50] not written to the
[55:52] Gentiles. It was pinned probably in the
[55:55] original tongue of Hebrew and sent to
[55:58] these people that the apostle who
[56:02] probably was Paul wanted them to realize
[56:05] that this Jesus Christ is your savior.
[56:08] Don't throw him away. I know you
[56:10] crucified him, but he's real and he can
[56:13] save you like he saved all of us.
[56:17] Let's read a little bit in Hebrews as we
[56:20] close. It's beautiful. Written so
[56:25] eloquently, the most beautifully written
[56:28] book in the entire Bible. God who at
[56:30] sunundry times and in diverse manners
[56:33] spake in times past by the
[56:38] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[56:41] unto us by his son whom he hath
[56:43] appointed heir of all things by whom
[56:45] also he made the worlds who being in the
[56:47] brightness of his glory and the
[56:49] expressed image of his person and
[56:51] upholding all things by the power by the
[56:53] word of his power when he had by himself
[56:56] purged our sins sat down on the right
[56:58] hand of the majesty on high. Being made
[57:01] so much better than the angels.
[57:05] Wow. All of that power going
[57:08] on. Being made so much better than the
[57:12] angels. As he hath by an inheritance
[57:15] obtained a more excellent name than
[57:17] they. For under which of the angels said
[57:19] he at any time, "Thou art my son. This
[57:22] day I have I begotten thee." And again,
[57:24] I will be a father, and he shall be a
[57:26] son to me. He's quoting the Old
[57:27] Testament. And again, when he bringeth
[57:30] when he bringeth the first begotten into
[57:32] the world, he saith, "And let the angels
[57:34] of God worship him, and the angels he
[57:36] saith, who maketh his angels, spirits,
[57:39] and his ministers a flame of fire, but
[57:41] unto the son he saith, thy throne, oh
[57:46] God that throws away any type of Jehovah
[57:50] witness doctrine." In fact, they change
[57:52] it in their Bible. They don't have this
[57:54] verse there.
[57:56] But he saith, but unto the Son he saith,
[57:59] "Thy throne, oh God, is forever and
[58:02] ever. A scepter of righteousness is the
[58:05] scepter of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved
[58:08] righteousness and hateth iniquity.
[58:09] Therefore God, even thy God, hath
[58:11] anointed thee with oil of gladness above
[58:14] thy fellows." The apostle goes on and
[58:18] he's
[58:19] describing this Messiah that's to come
[58:22] and he's trying to introduce his own
[58:25] people to the Lord
[58:28] Jesus. I think one day the musicians
[58:32] could come. I think one day
[58:34] maybe
[58:36] that there might be
[58:40] someone man of great
[58:44] authority in Israel, maybe with the
[58:47] spirit of Moses on him or maybe the
[58:49] spirit of Elijah. I wonder if you might
[58:52] read this book, this book of Hebrews,
[58:55] and maybe be inspired to bring this
[58:58] Messiah to his people. I don't know if
[59:00] it's going to come that way, but I read
[59:02] this book and you can tell it's written
[59:04] to the Jewish people. It's written very
[59:09] mysteriously. Talks about some of the
[59:11] most beautiful things that have ever
[59:14] been spoken
[59:15] of. It's going to
[59:20] happen. We believe the seven seals. We
[59:23] believe the ages. What's going to happen
[59:26] at the end is it's going to get so bad.
[59:29] There's a there's going to be a
[59:31] persecution start to
[59:33] brew. A
[59:35] spirit will come upon two men in
[59:38] Revelation 11 with the spirit of a Moses
[59:41] and the spirit of Elijah and they will
[59:43] start to do these mighty
[59:46] works. The
[59:49] bride will go up. The antichrist that is
[59:54] now condemning us, accusing us before
[59:57] the father will come down and be
[59:59] incarnate in a man. The tribulation will
[1:00:04] start. The message will go to the Jewish
[1:00:08] people. And it looks
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:12] like it's going to happen soon. Hebrews
[1:00:16] 4 said
[1:00:17] this. Hebrews 4:12.
[1:00:21] For the word of God is quick and
[1:00:23] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:00:25] sword, piercing even unto the dividing a
[1:00:28] sunder of the soul and spirit and the
[1:00:32] joints and marrow and is a
[1:00:35] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:00:39] the heart.
[1:00:41] Can you
[1:00:42] imagine if a if a Jewish brother and and
[1:00:46] he's really believing on this
[1:00:51] book and he starts to seek this gift of
[1:00:55] the Holy Spirit.
[1:00:57] Can you imagine what he would do if he
[1:01:01] saw or heard a
[1:01:06] minister the end of service a prayer
[1:01:08] line come say your name is
[1:01:12] this you're suffering with this things
[1:01:16] that no one could ever know. Can you
[1:01:20] imagine if someone was really reading
[1:01:22] this book and they
[1:01:25] heard that discernment
[1:01:29] ministry? Wow. This is this has really
[1:01:33] happened. I preached last Sunday night
[1:01:36] on the spirit of
[1:01:39] Elijah. The
[1:01:41] Jews, Elijah was a Jew. John the Baptist
[1:01:44] was a Jew.
[1:01:47] Can you imagine what they would say? Is
[1:01:49] this Messiah has come? But we thought
[1:01:52] that Elias that Elijah was supposed to
[1:01:54] come
[1:01:55] first and brother, he's come
[1:01:59] already. We didn't know
[1:02:01] him. But he came to this group over
[1:02:05] here. And he showed that this Hebrews
[1:02:08] chapter 4 is true. For the word of God
[1:02:10] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[1:02:12] any two-edged sword, a discerner of the
[1:02:15] thoughts and intents of the heart. He
[1:02:17] showed these things. These things
[1:02:19] happened. We are living in this last
[1:02:23] day. The fig tree is
[1:02:26] ripe. All nations, including the United
[1:02:29] Nations, are against Israel.
[1:02:34] Persia has now set their sights to kill
[1:02:38] this
[1:02:39] country. Is this the start of it? I
[1:02:42] don't think so. I think this is a
[1:02:43] political move. They sent some stuff out
[1:02:46] there that they knew were going to get
[1:02:47] shot
[1:02:48] down just as as a retribution for
[1:02:51] killing their guy that planned the the
[1:02:54] attack. But one day it will happen. One
[1:02:58] day it will be true and it will start a
[1:03:01] turn of events. And let me tell you us,
[1:03:04] we will have no
[1:03:07] excuse. These things have been plain for
[1:03:09] all of us to see. The Jews are in their
[1:03:12] homeland. It was prophesied. All nations
[1:03:15] will be against Israel. It was
[1:03:16] prophesied. We've seen
[1:03:20] it. The discerner of the thoughts and
[1:03:22] intents of the heart. Elijah, we've seen
[1:03:24] it.
[1:03:26] We've seen great powerful works. We've
[1:03:28] seen it. We will have no excuse.
[1:03:31] We won't. No excuse on that
[1:03:34] day. And our time is running out. And
[1:03:38] pretty soon that message is going to go
[1:03:41] over to the Jews as Daniel prophesied,
[1:03:45] as the book of Revelation prophesied, as
[1:03:47] Jesus prophesied. It's going to go over.
[1:03:50] The bride is going to come up. But we
[1:03:52] just have a short amount of time. If
[1:03:54] it's to
[1:03:57] today, have I told everybody about
[1:04:00] it? Have I said my peace? Have I done
[1:04:03] everything that I
[1:04:04] can? I always go
[1:04:07] back to there has to be some dedication
[1:04:10] in the church. There has to be some
[1:04:13] people that really believe this. This
[1:04:16] isn't me preaching. I've been reading
[1:04:18] scriptures mostly this this service.
[1:04:20] It's not me.
[1:04:22] These things are very, very
[1:04:25] plain. And these attacks on Israel are
[1:04:28] prophesied to come to pass. And one day,
[1:04:31] they're going to turn around and they're
[1:04:34] going to say, "Enough is enough." It's
[1:04:36] not even going to be them that does it.
[1:04:38] It's going to be Jesus Christ himself
[1:04:40] saying, "Enough. These are my
[1:04:43] children. Stop it."
[1:04:45] Just like you, brother Bobby. There's a
[1:04:47] time that's comes that he's going to
[1:04:49] say, "Enough with your persecution of my
[1:04:53] son. Enough with your
[1:04:56] sicknesses. Enough with these spirits of
[1:04:59] torment. Enough. These are my
[1:05:02] children and I'll have no more of it.
[1:05:06] It's not us. It's Jesus
[1:05:10] Christ. He's going to do it.
[1:05:14] It's going to be time very
[1:05:17] soon that this
[1:05:19] demon that is so
[1:05:23] powerful that this angel is probably
[1:05:27] Gabriel this this angel even had trouble
[1:05:29] with
[1:05:31] it
[1:05:35] that I don't understand
[1:05:38] it. There's spiritual wickedness in high
[1:05:40] places. There are things going on that
[1:05:42] you and I don't understand. But I thank
[1:05:44] God that there is a Gabriel. I thank God
[1:05:47] that there is a Michael standing for
[1:05:50] us, standing on the other side. And when
[1:05:53] these demons come in, they draw that
[1:05:56] sword. Say, "This is my child. This is
[1:05:59] God's child. I'll stand against you."
[1:06:03] of
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:09] Josiah. We have this song in the little
[1:06:12] spiral book in front of your bench. If
[1:06:16] you go to song number
[1:06:17] [Music]
[1:06:20] 77, turn your eyes upon
[1:06:23] Jesus. Song number 77.
[1:06:28] Turn your
[1:06:29] eyes upon
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:34] Jesus. Look
[1:06:37] full in his
[1:06:40] wonderful face.
[1:06:45] And the
[1:06:47] things of
[1:06:49] earth will grow
[1:06:52] strangeely
[1:06:54] dim in the
[1:06:57] light of his
[1:07:00] glory and
[1:07:02] grace. The chorus again.
[1:07:06] Just turn your
[1:07:09] eyes upon Jesus.
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:15] Look
[1:07:17] for in his
[1:07:20] wonderful
[1:07:24] face, and the
[1:07:26] things of
[1:07:29] earth will grow
[1:07:32] strangely
[1:07:35] dim. The
[1:07:36] light of his
[1:07:40] glory and grace.
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:46] Brothers and
[1:07:47] [Music]
[1:07:50] sisters, the signs of the times are in
[1:07:52] front of
[1:07:54] us. God places God places a
[1:07:58] gift and then he says, "Now here is my
[1:08:02] gift as I gave to Daniel. Now what are
[1:08:05] you going to do with
[1:08:07] it? Here is
[1:08:10] understanding. Now what are you going to
[1:08:12] do with it? Here are signs of the times.
[1:08:15] Now, what are you going to do with
[1:08:18] it? There is no sin that is
[1:08:23] worth being left out on that great day.
[1:08:27] It's not worth it, brothers and
[1:08:29] sisters. That's what church is
[1:08:32] for. We come here
[1:08:35] and we pray for more understanding. And
[1:08:38] I pray all the time, Lord, give me more
[1:08:39] understanding. Give me w more wisdom. I
[1:08:42] want to be able to help other people,
[1:08:45] Lord. I want to know what's going on
[1:08:47] because if I can just see my place in
[1:08:50] this this great
[1:08:53] plan, then I'll be able to help. Then
[1:08:55] I'll be able to do more like Daniel did,
[1:08:58] like Moses did, like the disciples
[1:09:02] did. And it's all about Jesus Christ.
[1:09:08] I really
[1:09:09] believe that that prince of Persia was
[1:09:12] hindering that angel because he knew
[1:09:15] that Daniel was
[1:09:17] prophesying of the book of
[1:09:20] life and about the Messiah to come. And
[1:09:24] he was giving understanding to the
[1:09:29] people. God doesn't change his ways and
[1:09:32] neither does the devil. And here he is
[1:09:36] today trying to hinder the gospel from
[1:09:39] going to the Jewish
[1:09:41] people. One day they're going to get it
[1:09:45] and it's going to be a glorious day. But
[1:09:48] we might not be
[1:09:49] here. We're going to be up having
[1:09:54] supper. It's going to be a It's going to
[1:09:56] be a wonderful time. Brothers and
[1:09:57] sisters, let's all
[1:10:00] stand. When he takes me by the hand and
[1:10:05] leads me through.
